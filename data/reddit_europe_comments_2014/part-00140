Any country can devalue their currency to any arbitrary degree they like. You decide what (lower) price point you want your currency to trade for, and you simply have your central bank buy up foreign currencies until that's where it's trading. China's done it for years, although they're scaling back now.

Why *don't* countries such as Australia/Canada/US/etc do that? Because exports are a *real cost* for a nation, imports a real gain. That is, exports are your people working for foreigners and sending the fruit of their labour off-shore. Imports are your people getting stuff you didn't work yourselves for. Normally, exports are how you pay for your imports - you send stuff off-shore so that you can receive imports in trade.

Devaluing ones currency means you're stuck exporting more than you're importing, meaning you produce more widgets for foreigners than you get in exchange. That's the position Germany finds themselves in today, and they could have just as easily done that under their own Deutsche Marks. So I *really* don't buy that just because the Euro's done that for them that this has been good for Germany. For one, they don't get to keep the currencies their central bank would have been buying had they been explicitly devaluing. For two, these continual trade surpluses have left their trading partners broke, and are slowing growth across the EMU. So I just don't buy it at all.

Guck dir mal die Karte an: [click](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Israel_relief_location_map.jpg/330px-Israel_relief_location_map.jpg)

und sag mir, wie man sich gegen einen massiven Überraschungsangriff im Zweifrontenkrieg verteidigen will? Blitzkrieg an zwei Fronten gegen einen Küstenstreifen mit nichtmal 100km Durchmesser? ""Treibt die Israelis ins Meer!"", oder was? xD

Schon im Jom-Kippur-Krieg ist nämlich exakt das passiert, was Ich oben geschildert hab: Israel hat nicht genügend Hinterland und wird erstmal komplett überrollt. Im J.-K.-Krieg konnten sich sich -glücklicherweise- nach ein paar Gegenoffensiven wieder freikämpfen.

Das wäre ohne die große Unterstützung der USA, die innenpolitischen Unruhen von Ägypten, Ägyptens wirtschaftliche desaströse Lage und Syriens Überheblichkeit nicht möglich gewesen. Israel ist da nämlich auch nur knapp mit einem [blauen Auge davongekommen.](http://www.zeit.de/2013/37/jom-kippur-krieg-israel-1973)

Ich sags mal so: Wenn die Nachbarländer einen Vernichtungskrieg gegen Israel durchziehen wollen, dann schaffen die das mit konventionellen militärischen Mitteln auch. War damals halt Glück für Israel, dass die Ägypter und Syrer sich so amateurhaft dranstellten, Israel hatte in mehrfacher Hinsicht sehr viele Vorteile.

Und wer sagt, dass das beim nächsten Mal auch so ist?

true,RamblinRambo,FINL,Finland,"Because I think it weakened the union. It brought in countries that are culturally, politically and socio economically too far away from the rest of Europe. It doesn't mean that I have anything against the countries as such but from a union perspective it was in my and probably many others opinion a bad decision.

If we take me as an example, I used to be very much pro EU. I did see a bright future for the union and there was a time where I was even for a federation. That is all gone, nothing left of that sentiment anymore. I feel that the EU went from being something promising to a slowly fading candle. The recent developments haven't given rise to anything that would point to anything else.

We have gypsies begging on our streets, we're suddenly more entangled with the fall out of USSR politics, we have more corruption in the union from member states that joined where EU money is going to the pockets of corrupt officials or organised crime. Sure we had problems with that in Italy and Greece as well but it was still manageable.

There is no simple answer to your question as it is a result of many things. I genuinely believe the EU lost a lot of its internal support for an even stronger union through the expansion. The fact that we're still talking about further expansions just goes to show that the leaders aren't on level with the sentiment of the people, further deepening the hatred towards the EU. This upcoming election will show us exactly how deeply rooted and spread these feelings are. Especially in key member states.

For the long term survival of the union there's a few things that could save it:

1. Exclusion of member state and a complete stop to further expansion. Will never happen.
2. Exclusion of member states. Will never happen
3. Exit of member states. Which will start the slow decay of the union

I cannot see the EU surviving and I will eat my hat if the EU exist 20 years from now.

My prediction is that we'll start seeing moves from countries towards alternatives fairly soon. This through looking at it objectively from just the political changes in member countries.

&gt;Research published by University College London in July 2009 found that, on average, A8 migrants were younger and better educated than the native population, and that if they had the same demographic characteristics of natives, would be 13 per cent less likely to claim benefits and 28 per cent less likely to live in social housing.

&gt;When we examine the effect of flows
associated with the A8 accession countries or with those entering with work
permits or Tier 2 visas, we find significant negative effects on property crime (and
no effect on violent crime).

immigrants are more likely than natives to commit
crimes, and that rising immigration thus leads to rising crime.
This belief is remarkably resilient
to the evidence that immigrants are no more likely than natives, and in most cases much less
likely than natives, to commit crimes.

true,khthon,PORT,Portugal. Exit. EU. NOW.,"This chart is bullshit. It should account for the allocation of those funds to private sectors. Where do those go? Show nationalities. Show  the names of the consortium's and banking institutions involved.

Everyone should know that to receive EU funding, countries must meet a big part of that funding financing themselves, from 50% to 2/3 of the project. Somebody please show me that information. It'll be hard because it's very well kept, I'm to bet.

Not only freedom to choose whoever carries out the project, be it large scale infrastructure or military assets, we often get it (forcefully) from EU partners at higher costs. We're doing worse deals than resorting to American, Russians or Chinese. It's corrupt because weaker countries have no such leverage when competing with EU ones. In my country, most have given up and turned to Africa, because the EU is taken for by cronyism's and sinecures. And if we take it up to ourselves, then the EU fines and demands we get in line. So, we're giving up farming, fishing and other key areas because they're promised to others. 

Add to that the order from Brussels up to 2008 to spend big time in infrastructure, even if unneeded. Complete non sequitur. It catalyzed the sovereign debt crisis and precipitated profits by those same corporate and banking institutions.

If we're such a poor investment, then by all means, let us leave. I'd love to exit the EURO and the EU. Bunch of corrupt xenophobic hypocrites. Making it seem like magnanimous aid to some poor country. It's not! It's blood sucking that's what it is. There are no free lunches.

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"Herr Schmidt liegt insofern sehr richtig, als dass die EU viel zu weit in ihren Angliederungsversuchen ging. Ordentliche Handelsbeziehungen hätten fürs erste gereicht um die russischen Geopolitiker nicht direkt so sehr zu provozieren!

Allerdings darf man der EU in der Richtung keine Schuld zuweisen, als dass -grundsätzlich gesehen- Russland einfach keine Berechtigung hatte in souveräne Nachbarländer (-&gt;Krim) einzumarschieren. Russland missachtet gekonnt die Souveränität der ehemaligen Sowjetländer und meint wohl, diese politisch bevormunden zu müssen - notfalls mit Gewalt. Geht ja mal gar nicht.

Wenn die Ukraine irgendwann mal in ein westliches Bündnis will -wobei eine neutrale Außenpolitik politisch un kurzfristig gesehen wie gesagt wesentlich cleverer wäre- dann hat Russland das verdammt nochmal zu akzeptieren. Und wenn sie das nicht tun und militärisch eingreifen, dann kann das selbstbestimmte Nachbarland doch nichts für den (""""Präventiv"""")Angriff.

Die Krim war dementsprechend mal wieder pure Muskelprotzerei, ein ordentlich Referendum -wenn auch kanpp- eh an Russland gegangen. Hauptsache man unterdrückt dann noch militärisch und lässt die ""örtlichen Selbstverteidigungskräfte"" auch noch die Wahlen manipulieren. Das ist mittlerweile ja klar und überrascht auch nicht in Anbetracht der kürzlichen Historie des Wahlbetrugs in Russland. Darüber macht sich ja inzwischen locker 140% der Internet-community lustig.

Hoffen wir also, dass Russland -insbesondere Putin- nicht so größenwahnsinnig sind und auch noch erwägen irgendwann mal die Ostukraine zu besetzen. Das wär dann die Krönung des Ukrainekonflikts.

Und wenn Russland wegen der Westannäherung der Satellitenstaaten Angst vor Isolation hat, dann sollen sie sich doch auch in die Weltgemeinschaft eingliedern, bzw helfen diese zu gründen. Nur das würde ja dann bedeuten sich mit dem ""Westen"" zusammenzutun und die politischen Einflussgrenzen nicht mehr zu bekämpfen, sprich: Geopolitik hätte ein wohlverdientes Ende gefunden. Ärgerlich, da ""der Westen"" (=der ""westliche"" Geist) mit seinen Werten wie Demokratie, Freiheit und  Gleichheit schon mehr als die halbe Welt beeinflusst hat und durch seine wirtschaftliche (-&gt;politische) Potenz weiter wird.

An der Einsicht, dass diese Werte für **alle** (=nicht alle westliche Werte, aber sicherlich einige grundlegende) Menschen gelten müssen führt aber nichts vorbei, wenn man endlich die verbliebenen Spannungen aus dem was aus den Blöcken übrig blieb überwinden will.

Leute wie Putin mit ihren autoritären, antidemokratischen und nationalistischen Strukturen sind es (und das ist der gemeinsame Nenner fast aller Staaten des Ostblockgeistes: das geht an die Prorussischen Kräfte da draußen!), die Russland immer weiter in die Isolierung treiben.


Nicht der Westen. Wir wären froh, wenn wir nen ordentlichen Handelspartner hätten, mit dem man friedlich den Wohlstand der gemeinsamen Bevölkerung mehren kann. Mehr wollen wir doch gar nicht. Kriegshetze hab ich bis jetzt nur aus Moskau gehört, aus dem Westen noch nicht. Nur am Rande.

Meiner Einschätzung gibt es da einfach eine kleine bekackte autoritäre und korrupte Machtelite -das Überbleibsel des Ostblocks-, die unbedingt eine vollständige Demokratisierung und Liberalisierung ihres Einflussbereiches verhindern will, was die Einheit der Weltregierungen doch in wenigstens den **grundlegendsten** Werten behindert. Kurz: Geo- und Machtpolitik statt politische Reformation. Dieses Defizit der Weltpolitik geht mit wirklich so gehörig auf den Sack, das kann Ich hier gar nicht in Worte fassen.

Wird also Zeit, dass die Länder in Ost und West eine Außenpolitik machen, die Bündnisse wie NATO überflüssig macht und Einheiten wie zb eine ""Nachfolge-UN"" an deren Stelle treten lässt. Aber bis sich Ost und West aufhören gegenseitig mit Dreck zu bewerfen ist man leider auch im Teufelskreis gefangen, denn dadurch brauch man ja wieder die NATO.

Second, the WTO is a paper tiger. If, and I'm stressing if because I don't think they would, the EU wanted to raise tariffs on British goods they could. Large countries routinely do it, because the only punishment mechanism is a lengthy case before the DSM which can take up to a year and a half, and even then countervailing duties are the only things that can be imposed - that is, tariffs to equal the amount of damage being caused by the ones imposed by Europe. Even there, there are tricks to get around that. Any number of objections to goods based on health or safety standards can be used as arguments for blocking aspects of British trade, which would undoubtedly get shut down eventually in the WTO, but would stand to hurt their trade in the meantime.

Further, how would the financial markets devastate European economies? Markets follow the money, and if they think the UK would lose in a trade war with Europe (which it would), then they'll side with Europe. British finance isn't some monolithic institution that works in the interests of the UK. It's a collection of millions of people from across the globe with disparate interests trying to make money.

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia—Montenegro's prime minister said he hopes the country will get an invitation this fall to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization despite new tensions between the West and Russia, which views NATO's eastward enlargement as a strategic threat.

After five years of talks, Montenegro, which emerged largely unscathed from the war following the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s and has a population of 650,000 people, could become the first new NATO member since Croatia and Albania joined the alliance in 2009.

""For very clear reasons of our own, including achieving stability in the Balkans through integration, we want to be part of NATO, and this isn't a result of anti-Russian positions,"" Montenegro's prime minister, Milo Djukanovic, said in an interview. Montenegro also hopes to be the next ex-Yugoslavian republic after Croatia and Slovenia to join the European Union

Moscow has criticized previous enlargements that moved NATO's eastern borders to those of Russia and has tried to force former Soviet republics back into its geopolitical sphere of influence.

After protests urging closer ties between the West and Ukraine led to the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych in February, Russia annexed Crimea and voiced support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.

This month, a member of Russia's lower house of parliament, nationalist Mikhail Degtyarev, said Montenegro could become ""a legitimate target of Russian missiles"" if it joined the alliance.

The 28-member NATO alliance said it remains committed to seek allies in the western Balkans.

""We see [Montenegro's] future in the Euro-Atlantic family,"" said NATO's Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen after his recent meeting with Mr. Djukanovic.

He didn't say whether a formal invitation to join the alliance would be made to Montenegro at a NATO summit to be held in September in Wales.

The Montenegrin prime minister said that Russia's stance against NATO expansion won't stop Montenegro from ""choosing its own path to the future, and that NATO should allow new members to join regardless of Russia's objections.

""I believe that NATO should adhere to its policy of [keeping] its door open and all countries that wish to join and meet the necessary requirements should be able to become members of this club of countries which share a system of common values,"" he said.

Mr. Djukanovic has held senior government posts for the past 24 years,navigatingthe country through the dissolution of its 88-year federation with Serbia in 2006.

To join both the EU and NATO, the country has been under pressure to step up its fight against corruption and organized crime, centered on seaborne smuggling of untaxed cigarettes to Italy.

To promote his country's NATO bid, Mr. Djukanovic met U.S. Vice President Joe Biden in Washington last month. Before traveling to Slovakia this week, Mr. Djukanovic met Mr. Rasmussen and visited Poland.

""It seems to us that due to a number of global issues, including the Ukrainian situation, there may be a lack of attention in key NATO capitals about Montenegro's aspirations,"" he said.

""At one point we all became too relaxed and [it] seemed like the job was done and then came Ukraine that woke us up,"" he said, adding that by building bridges among countries in the Balkans, including through the NATO enlargement, Montenegro seeks to ensure security and stability in the region.",0,1400339275,null,0,false,0,chkblba,t3_25slxn,t1_chkblba,t3_25slxn,null,1433837097,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

Financial institutions have enormous leverage compared to any other industry in todays world. If say the EU would set barriers for any trade from the UK to the EU the UK could do the same with financial instruments and that would be an enormous blow. The one who controls the financial centre is the one that dictates the terms in todays world and we've seen this happen more than once.

Anyhow... I know that whatever discussion I start with you it always runs down to an endless beating once head against the wall so I won't even bother.

I genuinely wish the UK would exit the EU so that for once all these pro-EU fanatics would see that their little union isn't all that mighty. The UK will do more than well without the EU.",0,1400339278,null,0,false,0,chkblcx,t3_25r571,t1_chkblcx,t1_chkaz20,null,1433837098,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,schaumamal,ASTR,Vienna,"Ok, Huntington tries to define the current civilizations. And that's already a problem for many people, why do this at all, isn't that just dividing? (Somebody in this thread already called it racist.) But he tries nonetheless.

The border between a Japanese and a Chinese civ? Easy, Japan is an island. No problem there. 

OK, Western/European civ. Here the tricky question is the eastern border.

Where does Europe end in the east? It's clear where it ends in the north, south and west, but where is the eastern border? Is Vladivostok a European city? Is Moscow? 

Huntington postulates that there is a Russian Orthodox or Eastern Orthodox civ that is distinct enough from the Western civ to be, well a civ of its own. It has its own religion, traditions, culture, languages and history.

Huntington says that those two neighboring civs have influenced each other heavily over the centuries and that the borders are very blurry. He also states that there are a lot of similarities between those two civs and that the border sometimes run right through modern nation states. Ukraine is the prime example here.

So Huntington basically goes back in history to the breakup of the Roman Empire into East and West and claims that from this moment on two distinct civs developed. 

He never states that one civ is superior to another, he just tries to make a meaningful distinction between them. 

If you go to Wikipedia and look up Europe you will find a definition of Europe that includes parts of Russia. Huntington say Moscow is not just another European city, it's the center of a whole distinct civ. 

And I think he is right. I find the current official definition of Europe extremely eurocentric and arrogant! (European arrogance is nothing new, I think we can both agree on that.)

Discussing this right now is of course politically very touchy. One starts with a harmless discussion about civs and ends up in no time with issues like EU and NATO enlargement and the crisis in Ukraine.

There was a substantial decline in the Protestant population in the Free State between 1911 and 1926, which suggests there was some level of exodus. Some of that may have been down to discrimination from the Catholic majority, some of it may have been down to unionists not wanting to live in a ""foreign"" country and moving to the UK, and some may have been economic migration as the Free State was a bit of a basket-case.

After that point, the decline was more gradual and can be explained by the fact that Catholic families tend to have more children, and the Ne Temere doctrine encouraged mixed marriages to raise their children Catholic. Protestants kept their heads down at first so as not to attract unwanted attention, but eventually were accepted by the Catholic majority.

Is that why the highest ranking US defense official said the US could withdraw from NATO unless European members integrated further or stopped their spending cuts. He stated he understands increasing spending is politically or financially impossible for many members currently, but stressed collaboration and integration could help them do more with less. That doesn't really support the divide and conquer mentality you think exists. 

Militarily, the US wants to leave Europe, and has been incredibly clear on this point. The US has pumped massive amounts of money into the support of the Euro (at its inception) and the European banking system (during the crisis). It even offered to pay for part of a pipeline that would help diversify the EU off of Russian gas years ago citing European energy independence as a vital US interest.

true,coolsubmission,null,null,"&gt;Vor den Referenden auf der Krim und in der Ostukraine wurden die Wähler mit Horrorszenarien vor faschistischen Verbrechen der Kiewer Regierung gewarnt, die ihnen angeblich drohten, wenn sie nicht für die Abspaltung stimmen. Wie schafft es Putin, dass die Menschen solche Propaganda glauben?

 
&gt;Der tiefste Grund liegt in den dreißiger Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts, als Josef Stalin eine manichäische Weltanschauung entwickelte, worin es nur zwei Seiten gibt: die Faschisten auf der einen und Antifaschisten – die das Monopol auf alles Gute haben – auf der anderen Seite. Der zweite wichtige Aspekt: Seit der ukrainischen Revolution in Orange von 2004 arbeiteten die Russen hart daran, ukrainische Reformer, Westukrainer und die ukrainische Idee im Allgemeinen mit der Geschichte des Zweiten Weltkriegs zu verkoppeln. Insbesondere betonten sie die Verbindung zum ukrainischen Partisanenführer Stepan Bandera, der zeitweise mit den Deutschen kollaborierte. Diese Kampagne wird seit einem Jahrzehnt geführt. Der dritte Grund ist sicher, dass viele Menschen einen echten Schock erlitten haben. Die Bevölkerung der Krim fühlte sich stets sehr weit von Kiew entfernt. Der Regierungswechsel infolge des Majdan war fremd für sie und hat sie wahrscheinlich zugänglicher gemacht für diese Propaganda. Zynischerweise betreibt Russland diese Spekulation mit der Geschichte, ein Regime, das sich selbst klar in die rechtsextreme Richtung bewegt.

Hat natürlich nichts mit der realen Verehrung von Bandera, dem Einfluß von Swoboda und rechter Sektor etc. zu tun. /s

true,Mugros,,Niedersachsen,"""Allgemeinbildung"" is common knowledge. Common sense is ""gesunder Menschenverstand"".

""Handschuhschneeballwerfer"": uncommon word if you ask me. Never heard it. Sounds like the typical weak insults like ""Sitzpinkler"" or ""Warmduscher"".

""Torschlusspanik"" is explained wrong. It's not the feeling you have when your career isn't on time. There has to be a specific final quality to it. Women get Torschlusspanik when they approach menopause and don't have kids. At some point the door is shut and they can't have children any more. If you're behind on your career plans, there is nothing final to it. Let's say there is a deadline of any kind and you get jittery as it approaches. That's Torschlusspanik.

Overall one has to keep in mind that it is normal in German to fuse words into bigger words. But there is a difference between a word like ""Weltschmerz"" which has nothing to do with the ""pain of the world"" and ""Vergangenheitsbewältigung"". ""Weltschmerz"" is a word with its own meaning that has to be learned. The meaning of ""Vergangenheitsbewältigung"" can be derived. Just because there is a single German word for it, doesn't mean that there isn't a valid equivalent English translation like ""coming to terms with the past"". But there is no translation of ""Weltschmerz"".

Really depends on how the whole thing is set up. It's no secret that with a lot of guest workers a lot of money just leaves the country. And our countries are led by people that should represent their voters, so it should be expected that they try to defend their livelihood.

Free movement between the East and the West means a lot of good things for both involved regions but again it seems to be the expected that the West  has to just swallow the negative aspects of it because of the mindset  ""you were lucky to be born in xy anyways you don't get to complain"".

Computers talk to each other using IP addresses. So if you type in ""google.com"" and hit enter, your computer will look up what IP is associated with the DNS name google.com, and connect to that IP.
However, you could map google.com to any other IP using your hosts file. For example, you could map google.com to 127.0.0.1 (your local machine), so that any time your computer tries to connect to google.com, it'll be actually be connecting to 127.0.0.1 instead of the 'real' IP it would have gotten from DNS.

That is where I see the problem though, and where it largely falls apart. One of Germany's biggest criticisms about the last attempt was that it was becoming too much of an anti-google campaign. I dont think you could get all EU nations to contribute to an anti-google.

You are right, geography doesn't help here. [Cool video about continents]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uBcq1x7P34)

My argument would be that the Turks have developed their own distinct civilisation. They are not European, they are Turks! With there own religion, traditions, culture, languages, area of influence and history.


The Turkish and the European civilisations are two neighbouring civilisations which have influenced each other heavily over the centuries and the borders are therefore blurry. 

Also, there are a lot of similarities between the two. But they are distinct, which is not a bad thing!

 
And about the EU thing. If there where only 8 million Turks (like we Austrians), you would have joined the EU years ago. But Turkey is a big, scary country!!! :)

&gt; &gt;    So no adapted hospital hygiene rules

&gt; What exactly is the harm in disposable sleeves, so long as hygiene is not compromised?

We could discuss potential problems (e.g., added costs, more difficult to control for compliance, possibly less compliance in practise because it could be annoying to change them sometimes,etc.). But that's not the point. Copy pasted from my comment:

&gt;  This may look like of little importance, but in practise lately we've been adapting ourselves to be more welcoming of those who are more extreme and are unwilling adapt themselves, and feeding their sense of entitlement. 

Here's what the Chief Nursing Officer had to say about the new rules:

&gt;  ""Balancing infection control measures with cultural sensitivities is challenging but this revised guidance provides helpful direction to services in how they can achieve this without compromising patient safety.”

I don't want it to be challenging. I don't want healthcare specialists spending their time trying to reach compromises that appease to every crazy belief out there. Because it's a waste of their valuable time. Because it provides those religious with a sense of entitlement that others have the duty to adapt. Because I don't trust a process that is unnecessarily complicated and where specialists feel pressured to reach some sort of compromise.

&gt; Again, why the hell not? As long as the kids learn to swim, who cares what they're wearing?

Even in the article the parents say ""the garment is clumsy"".  But again, that's not the issue here. If a non-religious person tried to use this in one of their classes just because he thinks it's cool, he'd be laughed off. Believing in super-buda shouldn't give you a special privilege. Again, as above, I don't want rules to have to be debated with Wiccans, Muslims, Catholics,  Furries , Bronies and whatever the hell exists out there. They are defined from a secular perspective. If your religion has a problem with it tough luck, you need to adapt.  

Having to adapt means you can't be extreme about your religious practise. We've been applying these principles to ourselves and they have have served us well so far.

&gt; British Law is the only legal framework that is valid in Britain. 

Not different from what I posted about Ontario. It's irrelevant.

It's completely disingenuous. You have people so extreme about their beliefs they demand their own courts courts that follow their customs. Yet you expect there to be no bias or abuse (even when I post a link to a BBC 1 Panorama report showing otherwise).

There should be no religious based para-legal system. Period.  There's no reason for it to exist and it's prone to be problematic. Their religious practise is a private matter, and not one that should be infecting society to accommodate them.


&gt; What exactly do you propose would be the benefit of a discussion of national identity in a debate about crime?

If 98.7% of rapes have been coming from Fugland, maybe you want to tighten restrictions on who is allowed to migrate from Fugland. If you realise refugees have been big source of crime, and that it's becoming unsustainable maybe you need to cut back on accepting refugees.

&gt; Are you seriously proposing that skin colour has a causal effect on how much of a criminal you are?

No.

&gt; False. Denmark is one of the most xenophobic countries in Europe in terms of immigration policy.

By ""neighbours"" here just meant Swedish people, which is who I was talking about in that paragraph.

Does the decision require the removal of material for a whole range of reasons including mere embarrassment or does it only require the removal of information that is provably incorrect or very old? If its the former then the court has clearly gone too far but if it's the latter then it sounds like it would be helpful to people who are still unable to get on with their life because of lies told about them or mistakes they made decades ago. With some clarification it could be a victory for privacy advocates. 

Also I don't buy for a second that Google is a passive processor of information. If the last year of news has taught us anything it is that any information processed by a US tech company is explicitly made available (sometimes, apparently, without the company's knowledge) to the US government and any intelligence agency in any other country that it might see fit to give it too with no genuine oversight or limitation just in case they or someone else might want to use it against you. To say Google's collection of information is passive (i.e not using the information for it's own purposes) is like saying a newspaper is a passive relay for news and information and it has no interest in whether or not they can collect the news information or whether they can use that information to their advantage monetarily and politically. They couldn't be more active in obtaining news then twisting it to fit their personal prejudices. 

The fact is we live in a world where a large part of the online services we use like Google, Facebook, Twitter etc don't actually sell us anything and yet are worth billions as companies. They don't sell a product; it's users and their attention and the information that surrounds their lives is the product and all of that stuff is hugely useful for other companies that do want to sell us things. Having your personal information exploited for cash can be useful sometimes because we get useful apps and websites for free but whatever it is you can't call it privacy or 'the free flow of information' because the information only flows one way. It is in fact the express giving up of privacy in exchange for online products. If human rights law is going to work for citizens then it needs to try and limit the negative effects of the exploitation of your private information while still allowing online products to be available and allowing citizens to bargain with Facebook to give it up should they wish to. It's your responsibility to only put information online that you don't mind being used but if it get out of control you should have some remedy. If certain types of private information get online without your knowledge/permission or if untrue information is spread or if the information is very out dated and if any of this information is or has been extremely damaging to your private and family life you should be able to get it taken down.

It can get pretty bad, but it used to be much worse to be honest.

It has, however, been dying down in the last few years. The government really stepped up with security; at rivalry games, several thousand riot police stand at the ready, and form a barricade around the ultras of the away team once the game is over, escort them like sheep to subways/buses/trains, and wait for them to leave before the home fans can leave the stadium.

I live in Champigny for the moment, just next to Les Boullereaux, another of those ""cités chaudes"", check it on google and you'll get a few results about gun traffic, weed smuggling and so on. My own neighbourhood is very quiet and when I take the train in Les Boullereaux where the station is, I never have any problem. It's rare for someone to witness the bad guys in those estates, even for people living in. They just deal with their own shit.

That being said, I like to watch more documentary-esque programs, which in my experience tend to be a lot easier to understand.  Also, you can learn about whatever the topic of the documentary is in addition to improving your Spanish.  

A Spanish television program I really like is called 'Redes'.  Each episode explores a different science-related field whether it is technology, psychology, biology, physics, or something else.  The host, Eduard Punset, does a really good job interviewing experts in these various fields.  If you are interested in it, just Google ""Redes"", there are many full episodes on YouTube, RTVE.es, and redesparalaciencia.com.  

Edit: Also, whatever you pick, I suggest watching with Spanish audio and Spanish subtitles rather than Spanish audio and English subtitles.  It is harder at first, but it's worthwhile to try to learn any foreign language without introducing your native language into the equation (or doing so as little as possible).

__Fyra__ (pronounced [fiːraː]) was an international [high-speed rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail) service between the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) and [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium) using the [AnsaldoBreda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AnsaldoBreda) [V250](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V250) train. The service used the [HSL-Zuid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL-Zuid) and [HSL 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_4) railway lines to connect [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam), [Schiphol Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiphol_Airport), [Rotterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam), [Antwerp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp) and [Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels).  Continuous technical difficulties suspended the service, and it was eventually permanently halted due to reliability and safety concerns.

&gt;The high profile project was a collaboration between [NS Hispeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NS_Hispeed) (subsidiary of *High Speed Alliance*, a joint venture of [NS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nederlandse_Spoorwegen) and [KLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLM)) and [NMBS/SNCB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMBS/SNCB).

&gt;A Dutch domestic service also using HSL-Zuid was branded under the same name. Despite using the tracks built for high speed trains the service between [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam) and [Breda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breda) uses conventional trains propelled by a [TRAXX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAXX) locomotive. Its name was changed into [Intercity Direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercity_Direct) to avoid confusion with the failed international service.

This is where me and I differ. I think setting up another institution that is integrated in the international online monitoring apparatus would mean every single Euro invested into it would be a waste. France's program is the least integrated, and it seems like all any other government had to do was file a request for information and France would hand it over no questions asked, and vice versa.

As you said, European politicians are ignoring what their own governments are doing. The US populace, politicians, courts, are all examining the NSA programs. Even publicly funded television in the US did a very critical piece on the NSA with more to come. With how things are going, I personally expect the US to make changes to its intelligence programs before European nations, aside from possibly the UK. 

So in my opinion, I would say that its not only not a step in the right direction, but a gross waste of European taxpayer money unless it is unquestionably separate from the intelligence apparatus. Obviously this is within question, regular judicial oversight to investigate crimes is ok. But judicial oversight is the key term. This would likely take a change in the law, not a corporate charter. Because they can be forced to turn over information and are not permitted to say anything. So it might look secure but only because executives are not allowed to talk about it.

Prussia won the war against (the German Federation lead by) Austria, which pretty much settled this question. Then Bismarck used funds of the House of Hanover that had been confiscated during the war to bribe the indebted king of Bavaria (incidentally about as much as what Neuschwanstein cost him) into signing a letter of support for a German nation state with a Prussian emperor, and finally he managed to unite Germany by [baiting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ems_Dispatch#Results) the French into declaring war.",0,1400365646,null,0,false,0,chklbt4,t3_25t7yc,t1_chklbt4,t3_25t7yc,null,1433841815,18,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,18

I don't think most Eurosceptics are against European integration, because we all know, and have come to fear, what happens when Germany and France can't get along. The problem is that the EU is clearly headed towards a federalized state (the ""USE""), which I don't like. I don't think we have to become a federation for things to work out well in the long run. It does, however, seem to be inevitable.

If we are to force the issue, I would start reform by making the Council to be elected through popular vote, like the Senate of the Americans is. Currently, each state gets one council member, usually a foreign minister appointed from the states. I think each state should get two members and they'd be elected directly. This is to reduce the democratic deficit which has plagued the EU for decades.

The EU is a great idea in my opinion. It has managed to keep the continent, relatively, at peace. My state should only, however, remain a member within until the last bit of sovereignty states have is eroded away. I don't like this sneaky, slow disappearance of national power while EU politicians maintain that ""the EU is not a federation"". There should be a drastic, one-step vote for a new treaty to see what's what. A treaty about making the EU into a federation. The people should know that that's the ultimate goal and that it's happening. Member states will individually decide either to stay or leave, but that the EU would become a federation.

I don't have a problem with certain states and EU bureaucrats pushing for a federation; if they want that, then that's fine.

Well economically at the moment the sort term economic integration doesn't look good, GDP growth being about 0.1% in 2013 and -0.2 to -0.4% in 2012. However interesting currently the EU as a whole is [exporting more than it imports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Imports,_exports,_balance_of_EU_trade_in_goods.JPG) which looks like a promising indicator. So in the long term it's possible the economy will grow a lot more, especially as we're just coming out of a recession. 

Politically well overall it looks like the pro-EU [EPP](http://www.epp.eu/) will win the [majority of seats](http://www.electio2014.eu/pollsandscenarios/polls#country)(over other parties) in the European Parliament so it looks like a good long term outcome.

*  ""The copyright in a book is not a “monopoly” in the antitrust sense. It does not give the author control over the market in books, or the business of publishing them.

Imagine if you sent around a questionnaire asking the general public on how the economy should be managed, whether quantitative easing should be continued, whether we should pursue trade negotiations with Iraq, whether green taxes should be levied, and where, whether VAT should go up or down and by how much. The economy would fall apart in days. The electorate necessarily does not know everything about every issue. How could we? There's fierce debate between different fields of economics and political theory that people have dedicated their lives to. How could one be expected to be up to date on all that, and have their own career and their own friends, family ect and then learn even more about political issues on top of that? The electorate doesn't know about everything and should never be expected to.

This is why the electorate should recognise that its primary functions are as a check to those in power, and making *value judgements*. By value judgements I mean 'do I think a strong economy is important?' 'To what extent do I think that equality or the economy is more important than the other?' 'what should animal rights be?' et cetera. 

UKIP is selling the United Kingdom a populist message which cannot be achieved. UKIP claims that we can somehow leave the European Union proper, and then get all of the benefits we want without making any concessions, whilst citing Norway and Switzerland, despite those two countries making *huge* concessions to the European Union. We simply cannot pursue the model that Norway and Switzerland have because those agreements were fostered in an earlier time. The political circumstances are different now, and such positions will be impossible to be reached. Furthermore, the British Commonwealth is not a viable substitute to the European community as they have no great wish for further association with the United Kingdom. 

This is why people talk about 'appeasement' in such a negative way. It may be democracy, but it is one of the worst elements in democracy short of a tyranny of the majority (where a democratic majority unfairly persecutes a minority, like Catholics in Northern Ireland). It is because UKIP is a populist party which sells unobtainable policies to the electorate and shifts the entire political spectrum based on these borderline lies. He is using the electorate's lack of comprehensive knowledge (and there's nothing to be ashamed of about not knowing everything: everything is a lot) to gain power and change the political landscape for the worse.

true,kronosya,NETH,The Netherlands,"Personally, I'm a strong believer in a Europe in which nations come closer and closer together, a Europe that will have the power to together have an impact on affairs in the rest of the world. I truly think the European Union is something unique in both peacefull as well as economic affairs. 

However, I think the EU is currently heading in the wrong direction. With the elections coming in 5 days, I think most people don't know what they'll be voting for. People are voting for national parties, which form international alliances in the European Parliament, but the average European citizen doesn't know anything about the international alliance their party of choise is in, or their beliefs. 

That said, I also think that the European Union should work WAY more democratically. Yes, we vote for the parliament this week, but that said there's little left. In 2006 the EU tried to press for a European Constitution. A part of the member states held a referendum (by far not all of them), and the biggest part of the French and Dutch population voted against it, and the Constitution wasn't passed. Moving on a couple of years, the EU invented the constitution for the biggest part again (I believe it was 6% of the text that was changed or something like that), and named it the Lisbon Treaty. This time it was ONLY Ireland helding a referendum, and the first time the Irish population rejected the  treaty. Another referendum was held and the Irish population accepted the treaty. All other member states only passed it in their nation's parliaments. 

I think this development is absurd. The treaty of Lisbon was a major change of the way the EU functioned, and greatly increased it's power. However, only the Irish were consulted by referendum. I personally really think that in something as crucial as the Lisbon treaty, the people should vote per referendum in favor or against it, as it's a major revision of the balance of power between nation states and the EU.

I also think that the balance of power internally in the EU is too vague for the citizens. We have a President of Parliament (Schulz currently), President of the European Commission (Barosso currently) and a President of the European Council (van Rompuy currently). Although I don't have official statistics, I don't think the average European Citizen knows all three of them. Technically they voted for Schulz and Barosso, although it doesn't even say their name on many citizen's voting tickets, because of the weird system of Nation parties being included in internation alliances. van Rompuy wasn't even elected, but appointed by the European Council, which consists of the president of the European Commission and the nation's respective presidents. 

All in all, I'm not against more coöperation and centralization of politics in Europe, but I fear the de-democratization of Europe as a result of the growth of power of the current European Union. I think the way the European Union functions should be revised, as it should be the people choosing what they want, and not the European bureaucrats. 

**EDIT:** I don't think I have really answered the question yet, so here I go.
Given what I wrote earlier in this comment, I don't think the EU will work in the long term in its *current* form. Many people are unaware of what the EU already does for them, and how much control the EU has over the nation states (again, I don't necessarily think this control is a bad thing), and I think that as the EU continues to grow in power, there will come a point when many (could even be a majority) of the EU-citizens will think 'Hey, I don't want this'. It's that point I'm afraid of ever reaching, as I think when this part of the EU-citizens want change, they'll find that with the current EU-system, it's gonna be very hard to get their voice heard in Brussels. And although I don't necessarily think that giving more power to the EU is a bad thing, the EU should remain as democratic as possible. And therefore I think the *current* EU will not the work in the long run, as it's not democratic enough for the people to sustain it's growing power. 

**TL;DR:** I personally believe in the coöperation between the European countries, but I fear the loss of democracy it may bring. I think the current EU-system won't work, and has to be revised, or there may come a point at which people lose confidence in the EU, and we will be set decades back in the achievements of the EU.",0,1400371016,null,0,1400412000,0,chkn5oq,t3_25smrp,t1_chkn5oq,t3_25smrp,null,1433842678,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

In that case, the couple had signed an ante-nuptial agreement to raise their children Catholic, a requirement at that time for mixed couples seeking to get married in a Catholic church. The court didn't rule that the children must be raised Catholic, but that the father's rights as head of the household (as was his legal position at the time) did not entitle him to change their religion without the consent of the mother.

It's an interesting case. The father was clearly in the wrong, taking his children and sending them to an institution is way out of line, and if such a thing had happened today the mother would almost certainly have been awarded custody. But that wasn't the legal position at the time, so the ante-nuptial agreement was used as a way of invalidating the father's legal right to do whatever he wanted with his kids. The ruling certainly wasn't intended to dick him over for being Protestant. In fact, one of the justices pointed out that the ruling could be used the other way in future, should a mixed marriage have an ante-nuptial agreement to raise their children Protestant.",0,1400371526,null,0,false,0,chknbqt,t3_25qlah,t1_chknbqt,t1_chke6um,null,1433842756,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

[**Firstly**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Supervisory_Mechanism):

""The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is a new system which gives the European Central Bank (ECB) the power to intervene in any bank within the eurozone.""

""Division of labour[edit]
A division of labour has been established between the ECB and national supervisors. Banks deemed “significant” will be supervised directly by the ECB. A bank is deemed significant when it meets one of the following 5 conditions:

1. The value of its assets exceeds € 30 billion.
2. The value of its assets exceeds both € 5 billion and 20% of the Gross Domestic Product of the member state in which it is located.
3. The bank is among the three most significant banks of the country in which it is located.
4. **The bank has large cross-border activities.**
5. The bank receives assistance from a eurozone bailout fund.""

This basicly amounts to the ECB taking direct supervision of many UK based banks and changing them as the ECB sees fit for the benefit of the EU as a whole rather than for the benefit of the UK people.

**Secondly**:

""One of the underlying issues that stand in the way of monetary union is the structural difference between the UK housing market and those of many continental European countries. Although home ownership in Britain is near the European average, variable rate mortgages are more common, making the retail price index in Britain more influenced by interest rate changes.""

**Thirdly**:

As a country, being in charge of interests rates is important in the face of financial crises like that of 2008. Allowing the depreciation of your currency which in turn decreases the cost of that countries produce and therefore increases exports meaning increased growth.

I didn't read much of this thread yet, but I've have seen it mentioned once: Austrian national identity is very young, it started after WWI, I would almost say in an top-down approach. Hallstatt culture was used for example, for some time I believe Austria celebrated it's Celtic heritage :)

The German speaking people in the Habsburg empire always considered themselves German, the area then and the first republic were called ""Deutschösterreich"".

After WWI literally everybody was for unification: ideologically the conservatives and also the Socialists, because they thought it would be easier to make a Socialist republic out of Germany than of notoriously conservative Austria.

Then there were more pragmatic reasons, Austria was reduced from one of the biggest European empires to a dot on the map, the Habsburg's industrial center was in Czechia, the agricultural center in Hungary, so Austria was a country without work and nothing to eat, especially Vienna looked impossible to keep alive.

Of course there are also more romantic reasons, the empire was gone, Austria was nothing to be proud of anymore.

So when you ask why Austria is not a part of Germany it was because it didn't join back then. Why? Because it was **verboten!** by the Allies.

Afterwards it turned out that Austria was able to survive on it's own, Austrians got used to not being Germans, [""Red Vienna""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Vienna) turned into a huge success. From then on the Socialists had nothing to gain from a unification, only empire-wanting folks and a subset of conservatives (with a socialist Vienna now more than before) still dreamt of Germany.

Talking about the about the Israel - Palestine conflict. Israel has done many atrocities which are covered in the news and Palestine has perhaps done some but it's not covered in the news as extensively.

&gt; If Swedes really want to help the little guy, maybe you can take an interest into Swedish Jews specially the ones in Malmo, who live in conditions approaching that of medieval Europe.

Studies show that for instance 39% of muslims have anti-semitic views. The thing is people are afraid to criticize Islam or muslims because people counter the argument by ""well not all are so such as all aren't terrorists"". We have an extreme party in Sweden called Swedish democrats who wants to ban burqa and niqab. They want to have a zero tolerance policy towards immigrants basically and are generally very anti-islam. A somewhat controversial statement was made by a Sweden democrats politician when he said

&gt; Raping and abusing women who dislike Islam is deeply rooted into the Islamic culture.

which in turn led to a 32,000kr fine. Wether the statement was true or not didn't matter because it offended muslims.

Over 70,000 muslims are also part in SMF who wants, and I quote:

&gt; ...demanding special legislation for Muslims in Sweden, including the right to specific Islamic holidays, special public financing for the building of Mosques, that all divorces between Muslim couples be approved by an Imam, and that Imams should be allowed to teach Islam to children of Muslim parents in public schools.

This was met by a lot of criticism (both inside and outside) however, but the fact that it had supporters is scary.

We recently had a **state employed** radiohost who said ""Can't Janne Josefsson just come out as a nazi once and for all?"" when Janne Josefsson made a report on how much the autonomous left causes anarchy and all around disturbance and violence. I just want to note that this is like saying ""Can't Churchill/Gandhi just come out as a nazi once and for all?"". Also worth noting is that he made a report on nazism a week earlier but the radiohost obviously didn't take that into account.

It's only going to get worse because the ""anti-racists"" (read as supporters of the autonomous left) wants to ""dare to not take the discussion"".

""For example, the mortgage industry of the United Kingdom has traditionally been dominated by building societies.

""In my opinion, an order of the court designed to secure the fulfilment of an agreement peremptorily required before a mixed marriage by the Church, whose special position in Ireland is officially recognised as the guardian of the faith of the Catholic spouse, cannot be withheld on any ground of public policy by the very State which pays homage to that Church.

this was impossible. The agreement to raise Children Catholic was LEGALLY REQUIRED, the early Irish state handed everything from Hospitals to schools to the Church. 

Signing the agreement requires your children be raised Catholic, this is a state forcing religion onto children, 

Not signing the agreement means you cannot get married. ergo the children are born out of wedlock and Ireland was Notorious for having bastard children taken by the Church and sold on. ",0,1400375073,null,0,false,0,chkoius,t3_25qlah,t1_chkoius,t1_chknbqt,null,1433843322,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Do you have any proof of that? Because I've been searching for a while now, and I can't find anything. To get married in a Catholic church, mixed couples had to sign such an agreement, but that was a requirement made by the church, NOT the state. I know we all like to joke that the church and state were the same thing in Ireland, but there's a pretty important distinction there. A mixed couple that didn't want to raise their children Catholic could have gotten married in a Protestant church, or have a civil marriage.

&gt; Signing the agreement requires your children be raised Catholic

No it doesn't. [Read through the judgement of the Tilson case](http://www.parentalequality.eu/knowledge-sharing/landmark-judgements/guardianship-tilson-1951/), the three key points are as follow:

* 1. Under the Constitution both parents have a joint power and duty in respect of the religious education of their children and if they together make a decision and put it into practice it is not in the power of either parent to revoke such decision against the will of the other.
* 2. An ante-nuptial agreement made by the parties to a marriage, dealing with matters which will arise during the marriage and put into force after the marriage, is effective and of binding force in law.
* 3. The former rule that the father has a right to break an ante-nuptial agreement as to the religion in which children of the marriage will be brought up has no place where the power of control over the religious education of the children of the marriage has been exercised; such a power is a joint power and is not revocable by one of the parties alone.

So, if both parents had agreed to disregard the ante-nuptial agreement and raise their children Protestant, that would have been perfectly acceptable. Ne Temere, though widely practised, was never a part of Irish law.",0,1400385354,null,0,false,0,chkrzec,t3_25qlah,t1_chkrzec,t1_chkoius,null,1433845020,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Russia is quite literally the last nation on Earth I would expect to oppress the Tatars.

 I get it, we are the bad guys now, but Jesus Christ, we're not Nazi Germany. At least not to Tatars, hah. Russians can be quite racist, but really, Tatars are not in the hit list of Russian neo-Nazis, that would be the Central Asian illegal migrants usually, sometimes Jews. Also gays recently, it's really sad because the homophobia became one of the new bad things that rose up after the USSR fell. My father spent the 90s in Ukraine as did I when I was a kid, his best friend was gay and was murdered, contrast this to his experience in the Soviet Army during the late 70s, early 80s when he remarked that there were openly gay couples in his barracks who literally had sex there in the nights. 

Now things suck for the gays -- there are districts in Russian cities where it's still nice, but overall the less cosmopolitan cities aren't so great for gays.

&gt;__Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line 2__ (__VDSL2__) is an access technology that exploits the existing infrastructure of copper wires that were originally deployed for [traditional telephone service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service) as a way of delivering very high speed internet access. The main high-speed link (e.g. a fibre optic connection) terminates at a hub near the customers' location. The existing copper wire infrastructure is then used to carry the high speed connection for the short remaining distance to the customers. It can be deployed from central offices, from [fiber-optic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber-optic_communication) connected [cabinets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure_(electrical\)) located near the customer premises, or within buildings. It has been defined in standard __ITU-T G.993.2__ finalized in 2005.

A better alternative is to put the the Spanish subtitles on while the movie/show is in Spanish. This is much easier to do (but of course you need to already be relatively good at reading it). That's how I perfected my English.

I have no suggestions for shows but you can simply pick any movie (or show) with an audio track in Spanish. Maybe pick one of you favorite movies that you want to see again, this way you already know the plot and it will be much easier for you to guess/understand what they are saying.

If you still need to learn more vocabulary, an alternative is to read Spanish comic books or just normal articles on the internet while using some plugging to translate the words you don't understand (I use to do that to learn English.)

[Lingoes](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/index.html) is free and use to work pretty well. You just install it and when you read in Spanish and don't understand a word, you jut click  it to translate.



Good luck.

You need to get the master of education and you will get a paper that it is the same as 1.Statsexamen, after getting your Master you have a combination of practice and theory called ""Referendariat"" for 18 month (in this phase you have less theory and a lot of practice). The Referendariat is payed, but you wont get alot of money as far as i know just about 1000€. After Refendariat you have to take a 2nd examination. It is called ""2.Staatsexamen"".

Sometimes the ""2.Staatsexamen"" is not needed if School needs really badly a teacher for a subject,they are in need for math, chemistry, physics,computerscience...

In the above mentioned sciences there are good chances, to get a job in a school even if  you have not studied teaching, but you have to take courses where you learn how to teach.

Hmm there are just a few private schools and there are a lot of people with 2. Staatsexamen searching for a job,especially with such subjects like yours, so the chances are low.

 Tutoring agencies for english is maybe a chance, especially because you are a native speaker, but there are also a lot of native speakers searching for a job here in germany.

Teacher in germany is a job you will get from a state of our country, normaly you will be a ""Beamter"" after a few years in the job and nobody can fire you, or lets say you have to to do very bad things, like sexually abusing children to lose your job.

I don't see how that's kool-aid at all, what is so strange about that logic? If Russia treats its own Tatars better than Ukraine treated its own Tatars, then what logic is there to resisting Russia. *Nobody* treats anybody in this world perfectly, every country has its downsides, the 'not well enough' is bullshit because there are no absolutes, only relatives and relatively to Ukraine, Russian Tatars got far more out of their minority status than the Ukrainian Tatars did. Crimean Tatars only had two lands the lived in: Ukraine and Russia. As far as I am concerned, modern-day Russia is a much better place for Tatars. Which is why I do not understand them.

 I am Ukrainian on my mother's side (Ukrainian Jewish since my grandmother on my mother's side was Jewish) and yet you don't see me blaming modern-day Russia or modern-day Germany for the Holodomor or the Holocaust. What is done is done, both nations denounced the leaders that caused that to happen. 

The antipathy of the Ukrainian Tatars is groundless as far as I see, and if that antipathy is truly strong (which I don't know if it is or it isn't) they may be digging their own hole, as it will only cause the locals to distrust them. Russia may not persecute Tatars, but the local Russo-Ukrainian populace in Crimea is now in a semi-war mode, they're jingoistic as fuck and at times like those, it's not wise to rile them.

In my country, owning land does not mean being able to limit where people may or may not move through. We have a thing called ""allemansrätten"", which safeguards people's right to trespass. It's a typically American notion that because you have the privilege to use something to make money, you have the right to limit other people in their actions.

When website after website is being taken down and people are being thrown in prison for sharing information, that's censorship.

I know how copyright works. It is a _monopoly_ on distribution. Someone who farms land has a monopoly on selling his commodities, because they are scarce, physical resources that are limited whether you like it or not. Information is only artificially scarce. It should not be limited.

The big corporations are the ones who benefit, whatever you say about the matter. If a poor but hardworking author tries to sue a big corporation, it doesn't matter who is right. The corporation wins.

Quoting the laws I was criticizing doesn't amount to an argument, since I am against said laws.

""Information"" is not bullshit rhetoric. We have seen in past years how copyright has been used as an excuse to silence dissent.

But I want to point out the thing that people always use as an argument, even though there is no conflict there: I don't have a problem with people making money! I have a problem with people infringing on the most basic human right (the right to a free flow of information), _in_ _order_ _to_ _make_ _money_. I buy things all the time.

Ti dico quello che ho fatto io. Ho usato un sito tipo quelli che citi tu per confrontare varie offerte (credo fosse facile.it). Ho salvato un po' di preventivi e poi sui siti delle varie compagnie ho controllato le opzioni aggiuntive che mi servivano. Nel mio caso: assistenza stradale e copertura spese legali.

Quando fai quest'operazione e la confermi sul sito anticipando l'importo con carta di credito* (ma puoi anche chiamare i numeri verdi), la compagnia ti inoltra la proposta di polizza per e-mail. Tu la sottoscrivi e inoltri via email documenti della macchina, polizza firmata e attestato di rischio. Subito ti arriva il tagliando provvisorio da stampare e tenere in macchina.

Dopo due giorni ricevi via posta una busta con gli originali del tagliando + carta verde e una preaffrancata per mandare via posta l'attestato di rischio.

Per qualsiasi problema, c'è sempre assistenza telefonica o via mail. Io mi trovo bene.

*Importante: l'importo non viene scalato subito dalla carta. Succede solo a finalizzazione polizza.

Esatto, come dici tu, la franchigia è quell'importo minimo che la compagnia non paga comunque e che devi pagare tu in caso di danni.

Inoltre: non solo dovrai pagare la franchigia (e ovviamente anche l'eventuale somma che eccede il massimale), ma anche i soldi che servono per le spese legali, perizie, ecc. poiché l'assicurazione di base copre solo il danno in sé.

assicura
Nei limiti delle somme indicate in polizza e
ferme restando le seguenti esclusioni, l’assi-
curazione è prestata per gli infortuni subiti da
chiunque si trovi alla guida del veicolo assicu-
rato. La garanzia è operante dal momento in
cui il conducente sale a bordo del veicolo al
momento in cui ne è disceso. Più precisamente
Genialloyd indennizza, le conseguenze dirette
ed esclusive di un infortunio che comporti:
•	 l’invalidità permanente accertata entro due
anni dal giorno dell’infortunio anche se so-
pravvenuta dopo la scadenza della polizza;
•	 la morte dell’Assicurato, avvenuta entro
due anni dal giorno dell’infortunio anche
se sopravvenuta dopo la scadenza della
polizza;

Quindi mi paga solo se rimango sciancato o se muoio? Se mi rompo una gamba o mi faccio male al collo niente? Niente diaria, niente rimborso fisioterapia ecc?

Sometimes parking with two wheels on the sidewalk (and two wheels on the street) is allowed, especially in tight streets. It has to be explicitly allowed, though (with a blue, rectangular sign, car from behind, half on the sidewalk, half on the street).

Also, sometimes parking at night or on Sundays is free. You will encounter white signs under blue parking signs with text on them that explain the situation. „Werktags“ usually means that a limitation on parking (having to buy a parking ticket, for example) only applies Monday through Saturday. Something like „8-20 h“ means that the limitation only applies from 8 am to 8 pm. 

It’s probably best to ask locals, though, whether or not and for how long you will be able to park.

(Also, hint for the next time, relying more on public transport in Munich would probably have been a good idea. It always depends on exactly what you want to do – if you want to drive around a lot, also outside the city, then that’s probably not a good idea – but there is enough stuff in Munich for three days to see and taking public transport right from the airport can be quite relaxing.

The biggest difference that surfaced was on austerity, with Keller (Greens), Schulz (Socialists) and Tsipras (United Left) emphasizing that it has been a total failure, and Juncker (Center right) stressing the need for fiscal discipline. Guy Verhofstadt was somewhere in between advocating a growth strategy in the short term, and fiscal discipline in the long term. 

I'm very biased, but being as objective as I can I'd have to say Verhofstadt won this one (again). He's the only one (apart from Keller) who has a lot of charisma and passion when he speaks, and he knows how to actually make his point. Interestingly enough there was a poll by europedecides.eu on who won the debate with Tsipras coming out on top (Tsipras 50%, Verhofstadt 33%). I don't know how that happened but that seems ridiculous to me, especially considering Tsipras did not make any good points, and he did everything in Greek.

The first one was called Flickering Lights (Blinkende Lygter, 2000) and it's a violent and tragic comedy film about a small gang of criminals from the capital, who has to lay low in the countryside to hide from their boss, after they stole a large amount of money from him. The style of the movie is pretty similar to the film In Bruges.

Another of these movies was Adam's Apples (Adams æbler, 2005), where three released convicts has to live and work at a church for a rehabilitation program. The church is run by a priest who delusionally refuses to see anything bad around him, and is oblivious of the fact that the criminals aren't really improving.

Here is my story. I used to be pro-EU and there was a time I considered that a federation would even make sense. The eastern expansion took all that away. It was the move where EU lost a lot of internal support in many key states. Once that happens, even the smallest things will spur on the negative feelings. Beggars on the street is one thing that hits you in the face each morning you go to work. Now we are also more entangled with former USSR politics which is something that takes energy and focus away from the EU becoming stronger and more politically powerful on the international stage.

We have more corruption and EU funding is going to the pockets of leaders mainly in the east. Organised crime has woken up to the EU scam  way of getting its hand on cash and the list goes on.

As I said in some previous thread. Sure we had issues with corruption and organised crime before the expansion, but that was limited mainly to Greece and southern parts of Italy. It was manageable, now its out of control.

I don't know what the truth is, but with the eastern expansion it feels like we also got more countries dependant on Russian gas. I might be wrong but anyhow. What it has done, is that even if continental Europe was dependant on Russian gas before, now we have to balance a good relation with Russia while having nations in the union that have tense relations to Russia all while securing our energy supply.

I support free trade and cooperation within the union but it has evolved out of that. I myself don't see EU as it is today working longterm and I think it is time for us (at least in the Nordics) to think of alternatives. 

For us in the North we have everything to win from exiting the EU and going ahead with a Nordic Union. We'd be less bound by policies formed in Brussels, our economies could develop much faster with regards to the key competences and the natural resources we have at our disposal. We'd also be able to develop our trading relations with Russia and boost our economies. We're not dependent on Russian gas or oil, we'd be on a level playing field with them where trade and development would be of mutual interest rather than being involved in some post USSR political game.

Russia is back as a key player in the world and it's time we recognise this. The EU expansion to the east took away our strategic advantages and made the union much more of a Russian lap dog.

Anyhow. I'm in a bit of a hurry, but wanted to comment before I forgot about this thread as it is an interesting question. So if something is unclear I'm more than happy to clarify :)

In conclusion I could say: No I'm not against European cooperation. I am agains the new EU. I was supporting of the EU before the eastern expansion. Now we just need to find a new way to move forward and for me that means a separation from the EU for the Nordic countries at least. The other solution would be that the EU excluded some members which will never happen, so the only thing left to do, it to go at it on our own.

The key to much of the Nordic success has always been that we've been fast to adapt. We're very pragmatic countries, if we see an issue we adapt to it as quickly as possible instead of wasting time in a political debate, wishing for dreams to come through. I feel that the EU has become a dream instead of being a viable option and that is why it is time to move on.",0,1400407012,null,0,1400407598,0,chkwrr8,t3_25tgrw,t1_chkwrr8,t3_25tgrw,null,1433847277,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

But even before WWII the country was split, Austrian nationalists were a force that could not be ignored, during Austrofascism the leading parties didn't support the Anschluss anymore. Chancellor Dollfuß', who was assasinated by an Austrian National Socialist in a failed coup, goal was to ""out-Hitler"" (""überhitlern"") Germany in an attempt to keep Austria independent. Another phrase you could hear back then often was that Austrians were the ""besseren Deutschen""/""better Germans"". Austrofascism had no or less racial ideology because of it's multicultural heritage. Catholicism played a big role in it as well, which provided another reason to stay away from predominately protestant Germany.

This is exactly it. The Nordics are western, but we're also Nordic. We've always been different. Especially Finland with it's insanely long border with Russia. We've had to go at it from our own perspective. We're western but as big countries (land mass) with few people we've simply not had time or energy to be involved in what many of us consider superficial politics. Good example is the whole Brussels/Strasbourg debate. We traditionally don't have time to mess about pointless things like this. I mean the only reason this exists is french pride. It is a simple example but still exemplifies the whole issue. The continent is so full of old historical BS that just slows progress down.

Then we have the east. We cannot be kidding ourselves and say that there is no difference between the east and the west. There are major differences. The east has a completely different set of issues (mainly old USSR fallout) than the west.

So even imagining some federation at this point will never work. The leaders of such a federation would mainly come from the western parts of the union.

French lawyer here. Well, as the others just said, this is a juge d'instruction and the trial is leaded by another judge.

Also I haven't seen Engrenages but as someone said here, when there is an important case which is taken over by the Medias, usually it attracts  the big dogs lawyers and sometimes they work for free when the suspect don't have enough ressources to pay them. This happens a lot in criminal case. For instance, if OJ Simpsons was french and poor, his defense would have be done by a great french lawyer for free since this was damn famous.

Also, as in the U.S.A, you can charge someone before the criminal Court then if he is found guilty he might end up in jail or pay a fine to the state, usually both, depend what of he has done. As for the victim, you need to wait for the civil to ask for compensatory dammages ( punitive dammages are not allowed by the french law). Please be aware than the main difference with the USA is that if you are not found guilty in the criminal trial, you can't start a civil procedure against the defendant, except for some exceptions ( this means that OJ Simpsons would have not been to the civil trial).

Anyway, this is civil law v. common law ( which means our law is mostly written while the common law system uses the precedent)  and there are a lot of differences and unfortunately for us, the common law is winning the game since the 1950's !",0,1400408172,null,0,1400408643,0,chkwxtq,t3_25tewx,t1_chkwxtq,t3_25tewx,null,1433847356,9,false,france,t5_2qhjz,9

Die EWG/EG/EU gibt es seit über 50 Jahren, und zu mehr als einer demokratische Fassade hat es in dieser Zeit nicht gereicht.

Wo bitte ist der politische Wille, eine wirkliche Beteiligung der Menschen an den Entscheidungen der EU zu ermöglichen?  

Das Gegenteil ist der Fall: demokratisch einwandfreie Volksentscheide mit nicht genehmen Ergebnissen wurden entweder umgangen, oder bis zum erwünschten Ergebnis wiederholt.

Von der Eurokrise betroffenen Ländern wurde diktiert, wer Ministerpräsidenten wird, und welche Finanzpolitik sie auszuführen haben. Das Volk zahlt die Zeche, siehe Griechenland als Beispiel.

Auf Zypern ging das bis zur Massenenteignung von Bankkunden unter der absurdesten Propaganda von wegen ""Geldwäschern"" und ""Spekulanten"". Als ob es nicht Firmen gäbe, die zur Bezahlung ihrer Angestellten und Lieferanten jeden Monat große Summen auf ihren Kontos haben müssten.

Und bevor jetzt wieder jemand auf die Idee kommt, solche traurigen Tatsachen bequem als als 'AfD-Propaganda' und ''Rechtspopulismus abzutun: 

EU-Kritik ist nicht neu und nicht auf 'Rechtspopulisten' beschränkt. Beispiele:

&gt;Die ""Denkpause"" bis 2007 wurde seitens der EU-Institutionen nicht genutzt, um einen solchen Dialog mit den Bürgerinnen und Bürgern zu führen. Stattdessen zogen die politisch Verantwortlichen die Vertragsreform ohne breite Konsultation mit hohem Tempo durch.

Sounds even worse in writing, and I was even semi- aware of it before it happened. The guy was really slick, I must admit, and it happened so fast that I didn't realize what was going on until afterwards.

We were buying metro tickets from a machine, and a guy with a badge around his neck came up, directly in front of a metro employee, and started using the machine for us, asking which passes we were going to buy. He punched in 3 of the 3 day passes, and the total was about 120  euros. When I went to pay with my credit card, he informed me that the machine was broken and we would have to use an adjacent machine. All was good up until this point, we thought he was a helpful metro employee. As we were walking toward the other machine, I even told my friend that this was very suspicious, but my friend noticed the badge and said that the guy works for the metro. At the other machine, we punched in our selection, and as I was paying with my card, the guy said that my American credit wouldn't work at the machine (true), so he  aid he would pay and we would jut have to pay him in cash. We informed him that we had no euros, but he put in his credit card, and out popped three tickets. he handed them to us, and walked to the metro turnstyle. The tickets worked, and the guy walked away. My friends and I were a little dumbfounded, but the station was very chaotic and we were trying to get out of the way. As we were on the opposite side of the turnstyle, the guy came back, to the gate and asked for the money. I told him we didn't have any euros, but my girlfriend being very naive had already pulled out 100 euros and was paying him. we went on our way, as did he, and sure enough, at the next station we checked the cards and they were one use passes, valued at around 1.50 euros each. 
I feel sick about the whole thing, not only because of the lost money, but the fact that I was aware it was a scam, but still allowed it to happen. 
Now, I know exactly what the guy looks like, and I know he is there again, however I don't know if it would be dangerous to confront him. I would really like to get the money back. Are they violent? Do they work in groups? 
I should ad that there were numerous police officers and employees around and they didnt seem to care. Will they be of any help? 
Can I just walk up and grab his wallet or something? Thank you again.

Queste sono tutte controllate di grandi assicurazioni tradizionali che hanno deciso di lanciarsi nel mercato dell'assicurazione low-cost online. Per esempio, Quixa è una controllata del gruppo AXA, che è una compagnia francese di servizi finanziari che fattura quasi 90 miliardi all'anno.

Finché ti limiti ai prodotti tradizionali (assicurazioni obbligatorie, conti correnti), con i servizi finanziari puoi sempre stare sicuro: sono ultra-regolamentati proprio perché li devono usare tutti. Se uno vuole aprire un'assicurazione o una banca, tradizionale o on-line che sia, deve operare entro i requisiti di legge, non ci sono cazzi.

Le uniche cose da controllare per evitare ""fregature"" sono i costi accessori (eventuali canoni annuali, spese di gestione pratica ecc.) che ovviamente non vengono pubblicizzati. In ogni caso è sempre obbligatoria la presentazione di un documento riassuntivo che specifichi tutti gli oneri (fissi ed eventuali) a carico del contraente.

In pratica stai sereno e assicurati con chi ti conviene meglio. La mia famiglia è ancora assicurata con un operatore tradizionale perché sono amici di lungo corso e ci fanno delle condizioni di favore (anche perché non abbiamo fatto neanche un incedente in diversi decenni), se non fosse così saremmo tutti con assicurazioni online.

Maefuckingeri is the voice of reason here. Your mentality seems to be one of 'can't we all just get along?"", which I wish we all could, but the world just doesn't work that way. Not everyone wants to get along. Some people's national cultural values are very different from some of the core Western cultural values and are perpetuated by dogmatic and all-encompassing doctrine.

As much as I want to save other people's lives, sometimes you just need to be realistic. Offering sanctuary to a great amount of people who do not take kindly to your cultural values - as I said, values (which include the tolerance of violence and oppression of others) perpetuated by dogmatic and all-encompassing doctrine, making it harder for those thoughts and values to die out over generations - will, in the long-term weaken the resolve of your own country's values. I also strongly believe that these cultural 'values' are the cause of a lot of the conflicts that cause such massive influx of refugees.

Klar. Wenn du bereit bist zu arbeiten, oder davon ausgeschlossen bist durch starke bzw. teilweise körperliche/geistige Behinderung.

Passend dazu auch der Absatz aus dem Wikipediaartikel:

Verdeutlichung der Stammform nach der Rechtschreibreform[Bearbeiten]
Seit 1996 gilt im Zuge der Rechtschreibreform der gelegentliche Gebrauch des Apostrophs dann als richtig, wenn er die Grundform eines Personennamens vor der Genitivendung -s oder dem Adjektiv-Suffix -sch verdeutlicht. Die amtliche Regelung der deutschen Rechtschreibung führt dazu die Beispiele Carlo’s Taverne und Einstein’sche Relativitätstheorie auf (§ 97 E). Der Duden nennt weitere Beispiele, u. a. Andrea’s Blumenecke; diese Schreibweise soll verdeutlichen, dass die Grundform des Namens „Andrea“, nicht „Andreas“ ist.[2] Die Unterscheidung wurde vor der Rechtschreibreform nur über den Stammformapostroph vorgenommen: Andreas Blumenecke (die Blumenecke von Andrea) bzw. Andreas’ Blumenecke (die von Andreas). Aber auch dann, wenn eine Verwechslung der Grundformen eigentlich nicht möglich ist, kann die Form mit Apostroph deutlicher sein; das dokumentiert der Duden durch sein zusätzliches Beispiel Willi’s Würstchenbude.

Diese Neuregelung stieß in der Presse auf Kritik.[3][4] Mitunter wird falsche Apostrophsetzung als sich ausbreitendes „Virus“ beschrieben.[5][6][7] Kritiker des zusätzlichen Apostrophs sind der Meinung, dass er die Lesegeschwindigkeit verringere. Er erschwere das Überfliegen von Texten, da die Aufmerksamkeit von den sinntragenden Wörtern weg zu sinnarmen Syntaxzeichen hingelenkt werde. Zudem führe das Herausragen aus den Buchstabenzeilen und der zusätzliche Leerraum zwischen den Buchstaben zu einem unruhigeren, zerrissenen Schriftbild.",0,1400414472,null,0,false,0,chkxvt8,t3_25s800,t1_chkxvt8,t1_chkxnjx,null,1433847801,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

true,diodi,FINL,Finland,"While the attack took the west by surprise, there is nothing surprising in the Russian determination to fight over Ukraine.  Controlling Ukraine one way or another is fundamental for  Russian geopolitics and has noting to do with Putin being a dick (Yeltsin and Gorbachev had same ideas about Crimea and Ukraine). Now is the last time for Russia to act. It either takes what it can, or Ukraine will fall into the western sphere of influence forever.  Baltic states are in the Nato and Russia has lost them for good. Russia can only use them  as pawns to get what it really wants. 

Here is what  Zbigniew Brzezinskin wrote in his book [The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives, 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Chessboard)

&gt;*The states deserving America's strongest geopolitical support are Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and (outside this
region) Ukraine, all three being geopolitically pivotal. Indeed, Kiev's role reinforces the argument that Ukraine
is the critical state, insofar as Russia's own future evolution is concerned.* ...


&gt;...*Ukraine, a new and important space on the Eurasian chessboard, is a geopolitical pivot because its very
existence as an independent country helps to transform Russia. Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian
empire. Russia without Ukraine can still strive for imperial status, but it would then become a predominantly
Asian imperial state, more likely to be drawn into debilitating conflicts with ....However, if Moscow regains control over
Ukraine, with its 52 million people and major resources as well as its access to the Black Sea, Russia
automatically again regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state, spanning Europe and Asia.
Ukraine's loss of independence would have immediate consequences for Central Europe, transforming Poland
into the geopolitical pivot on the eastern frontier of a united Europe.*

The assumption that Russia is equally interested with confrontation with EU or NATO countries is absurd. France and Germany know that this is part of the larger geopolitical competition between US and Russia over Eurasia.

&gt;Einflusz der Reservisten zunaechst geleugnet hattest

Nein. Ich hab den Einfluss relativiert, aber nicht geleugnet. Keep your facts straight.

Übrigens war meine Aussage die, dass die Reservisten bei der Verteidigung des Hinterlandes nach dem Fall der Bar-Lew Linie schon kampfbereit waren und wohl auch eingesetzt worden sind. **Also ist Israel erstmal trotz voller Kampfstärke weiter zurückgedrängt worden**, mit enormen Materialverlust, dazu aber unten mehr.

Mein nachfolgender Argumentationsansatz dürfte klar sein: Man darf es der Blödheit (lies: Arroganz und Überheblichkeit) der syrischen Militärstrategen und der innenpolitischen Probleme (=wirtschaftliche, massive politische Umwälzungen) in Ägypten verdanken, dass diese beiden Länder nicht mit voller Kapazität aufgetreten sind.

Übrigens: wäre es nicht zu dem USA-UDSSR erzwungenen Waffenstillstand gekommen, **wie lange denkst du, hält Israel -ein ca. 100km schmaler Küstenstreifen- eine Belagerung von 2+ Ländern durch?** Ungefähr so lange wie Polen gegen Nazi-D. und Russland schätze Ich.


&gt;lies doch bitte die Artikel, die du verlinkst vorher durch, ja?

Sicher gibt es in meinen Quellen auch Belege für die militärische Kompetenz und partielle Überlegenheit der israelischen Verbände (besonders bei den Gegenoffensiven), dennoch ist mein Eindruck und Abwägung beider Argumentationen eindeutig. Was ist also dein Problem? Ist ja nicht so, als wär meine Argumentation nicht stringent, auch wenn du das gerne so hättest.

Was dir auch hätte auffallen sollen, ist die Unterstützung der USA, die die Unterstützung der Umländer ausgleichen musste:

&gt;doch der militärische Durchbruch wollte selbst nach knapp einer Woche nicht kommen. Vor allem, weil Waffen fehlten: Die Israelis hatten zuhauf Panzer und Flugzeuge verloren und brauchten dringend Nachschub. Erst als US-Präsident Nixon beschloss, die Israelis zu unterstützen, wendete sich das Blatt. Am 12. Oktober setzte das Pentagon eine Luftbrücke in Gang, die die Israelis täglich mit Tonnen von Kriegsmaterial versorgte. 

Und [das](http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/40-jahre-jom-kippur-krieg-angriff-von-syrien-und-aegypten-auf-israel-a-951278.html) stützt wieder exakt meine These:

Israel nur mit konventionellen Waffen ohne Atomwaffen als letztes Durckmittel auszustatten ist

1) überaus riskant

2) ""arsch""teuer, wenn Israel auch tatsächlich ohne großes Risiko standhalten soll.

3) Und um mal von dieser Diskussion wegzukommen: auch *unnötig*, wenn man bedenkt dass Friedensverhandlungen für einen dauerhaften Frieden auf keinem *so* schlechten Weg sind.

**tl;dr**

Nice, dass du historische Beispiele schön einseitig nach deinem Sinn darlegst. Ich bemüh mich ja wenigstens eine Synthese einzugehn.

Leider verfehlst du damit  nämlich die militär-strategische Realität welche gegeben ist durch die geographische Lage, zahlenmäßige und finanzielle Überlegenheit der Umländer und die militärische Kompetenz und Kapazität von Syrien &amp; Ägypten, die mit fortlaufender Zeit sicher nicht schlechter wurde. Ob du das wahrhaben willst oder nicht, der J.K.-Krieg war alles andere als eindeutig entschieden und es gibt wegen o.g. Zahlen absolut keinen Garant, dass Israel das nächste Mal den selben Erfolg verbuchen wird.

Marrying in a protestant church. -This is basically a stupid idea, In a time when converting ends you up disappearing, probably best not to sign your own death warrant, but hey! who does not want their house burnt down.

Marring in a civil service  - No converting everyone is happy, except, where can you do this? In large cities like Dublin sure but most of Ireland was (and I suppose still is)  rural, the only place to get married is in a church. 

Cool so conversion or conversion it is.

If that Ante-nuptial, That was written by a priest, that was signed as part of a religious ceremony, was at no point was at no point co-signed by a legal representive, it should have as much legal binding as any other non legal document.

Militärstrategische Fehler können behoben werden und technologische Nachteile aufgeholt werden, zahlenmäßige Unterlegenheit lässt sich aber nicht ändern. So einfach ist das - und das ist relevant für heutige und künftige Überlegungen bezgl des israelischen Militärs.

true,Quazz,BELG,Belgium,"The assumption is that the money is used on local workers and companies thus being completely beneficiary. 

Not only does that ignore the consequences of that (eg increased traffic -&gt; increased maintenance and cost), but it's an incorrect assumption to begin with. 

Sure, for some projects mostly local workers might be used, but when it's used for EU institutions, then you can't tell me that local workers are exclusively involved in it. It's just not true. As such, it doesn't actually benefit you. In fact, it's even worse, because you're making expenditures without receiving tax on it. Furthermore, you need to subtract what they get out of the EU by what they put in first to see how much they actually receive. 

I'm not sure about the next bit, but I believe the hosting nation also needs to pay for the people working there. (obviously comes out of EU budget)

While this doesn't necessarily sound like a negative, it's people from all across Europe working there and how much of that do you think they'll spend in that nation? Close to nothing. Of course, it originally came from the EU budget anyway, but regardless it's not really beneficiary. 

It also makes you more of a target and results in graphs like in OP's image where you look like ""a leech"", while reality tells a different tale.

I completely agree. This is also one more reason why I do not, myself, see any reason for us to be in the EU.

&gt;You say it like we don't waste time on democratic ways we just act.

Never said that. I said that we are pragmatic in general. Look at Finnish foreign policy since the war, it has been very practical. At many times a balancing act, but instead of getting too deep into a hole where we cannot get out of we opted for the most logical solution. The whole issue if Finland wanted to be bailing out Euro countries in need, was actually a very pragmatic discussion. We had to think about the practical implications rather than just jump on the bandwagon to save the Euro.

An example of lack of practical thinking is exactly what you say here:

&gt;Well when communism fell it was 'promised to ''countries of eastern expansion'' that they would join EU. If they weren't promised that I doubt communism would have failed or that they would distant themselves from Russia.

It was a very emotionally based decision to just promise anything. If the countries would have really wanted to progress they'd opt out of communism anyhow. So if there is/was a genuine want to move forward and into the future then no promises would have ever been needed.

Having worked with a lot of spanish and other southern European people this just doesn't say anything.

I come in and leave exactly when my time to come in and leave is. During that time I do all my work so that I have time to spend doing what I like and not just working.

I can with confidence say, from having worked with almost every nationality there is, that some cultures work slower than others. In other countries you go in, do your stuff and go home. In others there is more importance placed in ""being there"" even if you're not doing anything. In others it is important to stay late, very late or until your boss goes home (Japan is one of them).

Generalement, lorsque le soleil commebcait a se coucher, nous toquions a la porte des gens et demandions si nous pouvions plabter notre tente dans leurs jardins. Il y avait toujours des nons, mais il nous suffisait d'un oui!  Et les gens etait tres sympathique, on nous a souvent propoé de prendre une douche, de manger avec eux ou de dormir chez eux.

Une 60aine de kilometres

J'adore les pates! Je crois que nous etions les voyageurs qui cuisinait le plus. Bien sur c'etait souvent des pates, mais la garniture qui allait avec etait tres souvent renouvelé. Et ma mere est une tres bonne cuisiniere!. Ensuite, je pense que lorsque l'on voyage en famille on est plus poussé a cuisiner dietetiquement. Mais il nous est deja arrive de cuisiner par exemple des hamburgers avec seulement un rechaud!

Jen'ai pas trop d'inforlation sur les velos. Niveau bagages, j'avais 30, ma soeur 20 et mes parents 40. On avait des bagages a l'arriere, mes parents a l'avant et l'arriere, et une sacoche de guidon pour ranger quelques affaires. Le plus dur a été lorsque ma soeur s'est cassé le bras, on a tous du porter elle, ses affaires et son velo.

On se douchait quand on pouvait. Lorsque nous n'avions pas trop possibilité,  c'etait aacroupi sous la tente avec des gourdes, et donc deux litres par personnes. Mais on avait aussi des vaches a eaux que nous pouvions remplir pour improviser des douches. Pour les habits, lavage a la main!

L'anglais! Nous avons tous du nous mettre a l'espagnol en amerique du sud, et nous avions quelques phrases sous le coude en indonesie. Sinon, on se debrouillait comme on pouvait.

Mon pere est assez bricoleur. Le pire etait une jante detruite, mais on a juste changé la roue. Sinon, on a du faire reparer le siege du petit frere chez un artisan argentin.

J'adore lire, donc je me suis toujours procuré des livres quand je pouvais. Mais pas que je sache. On avait deux baches, c'est vraiment super pratique, ne serait ce que pour s'abriter ou manger par terre. 

10€ parjour et par personnes. Sujet a des changements selon le pays et l'endroit.

On savait ou est ce qu'on allait, sachant que nous avions des avions a prendre, mais c'etait aussi au jour le jour.

En avion!

Il faut se lancer! Mais pas de conseils comme ça,  meme si je suis pret a repondre a n'importe quel question. La partie velo n'est pas du tout la plus dur, on s'habitue vite et on ne va pas trop vite. On ne faisait pas de velo avant, on a tout pris sur le tas.

&gt; BEREC supports the promotion of and the clear commitment of the European Parliament to the principle of net neutrality.

&gt; BEREC recognizes that guaranteeing an open internet is a challenging objective, not least given its complex and dynamic ecosystem. Yet, the Commission’s original proposal would turn a flexible and progressive regulatory regime (under the 2009 Framework) into a rigid regulatory system and the European Parliament has generally retained this approach.

Roaming:
&gt; First, BEREC recognises that the set-up of a retail obligation should be carefully accompanied by the wholesale measures ensuring that this obligation can be met by the operators, without excessive competitive distortions or potential domestic retail price increases.

&gt; BEREC is concerned at the deadline envisaged by Parliament for the Commission’s report to Parliament and Council on wholesale charges and other arrangements (30 June 2015). Since the review and adjustment of those charges and arrangements might be necessary in order to enable a sustainable implementation of RLAH on retail market, coming as it does only six months before the introduction of “roam like at home” pricing (RLAH) (15 December 2015), BEREC is concerned this timetable would not provide legislators with enough time to consider these very important new legislative provisions. Operators would  also need sufficient time to develop and introduce systems to implement the agreed fair use criteria, to adjust domestic tariff schemes and – if needed – to adjust their wholesale arrangements in line with what the legislators eventually adopt. BEREC would therefore urge legislators to carefully consider the timing of these various provisions, to ensure that both binding fair use criteria and relevant wholesale charges or other arrangements are in place by the time RLAH comes into effect.


**TL;DR:** 

Net neutrality:Yes, support all the way.

Freedom of religion is and always has been constitutionally guaranteed, and civil marriage was always an option for anyone. The constitution is extremely conservative on social issues, but the Irish people at the time, North and South were very conservative themselves, so you can hardly claim that this was something shoved onto the people by the church. 

The Protestant community in the Republic has always been a privileged minority - they continued to dominate certain professions, including the legal profession, and the State has also provided extra money for protestant schools which would otherwise be too small to survive on normal state funding.

There has also never been any systematic discrimination against protestants in the South. The cases that did happen, such as in Fethard-on-sea, or the Mayo librarian case were hugely controversial among the catholic population at the time. This is starkly contrasted with the North, where anti catholic discrimination was open, uncontroversial and omnipresent.

The main reason for the large decline in the Protestant population in the south was simply that a huge number of them were members of the British civil service and British army, and   when their jobs in Ireland were done, they simply left. Being wealthier and more educated than the catholic population, they were also more mobile, and had the resources to move to Britain to improve their prospects. Coupled with huge economic migration due to the Republic being an economic basket case, and a very low birthrate naturally led to a sharp decline in the protestant population.",0,1400426654,null,0,false,0,chl0vjr,t3_25qlah,t1_chl0vjr,t1_chky8ke,null,1433849283,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

* Contrairement à ce que tu dit, la fusion nucléaire n'est pas propres. En effet c'est une fusion deutérium tritium. La fusion deutérium tritium est la suivante :  D + T donne 4He (3.5 MeV) + n (14.1MeV) tu as donc un neutron qui se balade et va irradier les matériaux autour du réacteur. Sans parler du fait qu'en cas de catastrophe on va avoir du tritium, béryllium, plomb, et lithium.

* Pour une fusion rentable au niveau industriel il faudrait maintenir les fusions longtemps, on va dire une dizaine de minute. Dans les tokamak on a une phénomène que personne ne comprend, à savoir les disruptions. Une disruption est une explosion d’énergie avec perte de confinement du plasma. Le plasma chauffé à plusieurs millions de degrés et évoluant à grande vitesse peut donc aller à ce moment là heurter les parois et faire de gros dégâts.

&gt; Since when is nationalism fed to Europeans? Last time I checked, since the end of WW2 people in Western Europe have only been told to be ashamed of their heritage.

It's never stopped. In many countries nationalism is very alive as a political instrument. For instance, in Spain, many parties (and specially the two major ones) center a significant part of their discourse around the exaltation of national pride; in areas with strong pro-independence movement, some parties also use nationalism in their discourse. I am honestly not familiar with any political parties with apologetic discourses about national heritages. The only country that I can think of that is specially careful to use explicitly nationalistic arguments is Germany, but even then some successful political discourses in there circle around creating a certain self-image in contraposition to other countries' perceived image, which is one of the pillars of nationalism.

About European nationalism (weird concept as it may be, due to few people considering Europe a single nation), it's been intensifying since people started perceiving Russia as an outside enemy. I consider it positive when we Europeans focus on our similarities and work together, and when we voice our disapproval towards policies or actions by other governments when certain rights we consider basic are under attack (like recent events with the USA or Russia). Still, sometimes there is a push by governments and the media trying to define ""us"" in contraposition to ""them"", not in concrete, reasoned matters but in general. In my opinion, one of the most pathetic recent examples showing the current nationalistic climate happened during the last Eurovision contest, when a couple of singers were booed for representing the musical scene of a country which people dislike for totally unrelated reasons.

&gt; Sadly, that is and has always been how the world works. If the EU doesn't sell someone else will. You may not like how the world works but you have to get used to it.

That's how the world works, and if we want to change the world then the first step is to not play ball; to democratically voice our opinions and punish our governments with our votes when they act (in our name) in ways that we consider immoral. They will buy their ships from other people? probably, and then it's up to those other citizens to act upon it. I could be offered money and a guarantee of immunity if I murdered a person, but I wouldn't do it even if I was certain that they would find another one to take that job. The same applies here, if we are to change the world the first step is to set an example (specially if you are eager to vocally criticise the actions that you are later supporting through yours).",0,1400428892,null,0,false,0,chl1nbo,t3_25ui9d,t1_chl1nbo,t1_chl0bco,null,1433849643,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

So I'll just list some big things which you may or may not know are Dutch. It's not exactly a complete list though:

* Most of the best/most popular DJ's in the world - amongst those being Hardwell, Tiësto, Armin van Buuren, Afrojack and a ton more - are Dutch. [Here's a list of 50 famous Dutch DJ's](http://thedjlist.com/world/netherlands/djs/). If you hear a popular trance/house/techno song - there is a very good chance it's made by a Dutch DJ.


* Due to the electronic music talent in the country, there's also a bunch of big festivals/events that either originate from The Netherlands or are organised by Dutch people. One example of this is [Sensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensation_%28event%29).


* Then there is the world famous [André Rieu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Rieu), who tours around the world with massive Waltz concerts.


* Also very popular worldwide is the symphonic rock band [Within Temptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Within_temptation).


* The tv show [Big Brother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_%28TV_series%29) is a Dutch concept, as is [The Voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice_%28TV_series%29) and [Deal or No Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_or_No_Deal). [Fear Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_Factor) was also a Dutch production. Pretty much anything produced by/created by [Endemol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemol) can be traced back to The Netherlands.


* [Paul Verhoeven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Verhoeven) is a Dutch director/screenwriter/producer. He's made quite some big films, such as Robocop (original), Starship Troopers and Total Recall.


* [Carice van Houten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carice_van_houten) is a Dutch actress who, amongst things, plays Melisandre in Game of Thrones.",0,1400429227,null,0,1400438392,0,chl1rps,t3_25uq0w,t1_chl1rps,t3_25uq0w,null,1433849706,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

Renting is uncommon in Italy, but the most common household type in countries like Germany, Denmark, and Sweden.

Not sure if we're getting screwed by being so eager to rent here. It's just a cultural thing, I guess. I don't personally want to invest in a flat just now, it's too geographically limiting.

I know that in Italy it's common to live with your parents until your mid-to-late twenties when you buy your first house or flat and that could just never work here.

- GENEVA: Swiss voters on Sunday rejected a proposed hourly minimum wage of $25 -- which would have been the world's highest -- in one of the planet's priciest nations, a polling agency said.

- People working in sales, services and farming, or as hairdressers and flight attendants, for instance, generally earn far less than the proposed minimum wage.

- ""This minimum wage would put jobs in danger and would make accessing the labour market even more difficult for youths and those with few qualifications,"" Bern has warned.

- Only 23 per cent of Swiss voters came out in favour of introducing a minimum wage in Switzerland so high it could pass for mid-management pay elsewhere, the gfs.bern polling institute said in a projection of Sunday's referendum results.

- Much of the national debate ahead of the referendums, which are held every three months in Switzerland as part of the country's direct democratic system, has focused on the pros and cons of introducing a minimum wage.

Even if the fares are cheaper than the other Europeans country, sometimes, you must also consider that according to recent estimates 16% of the gigantic Italian public debt has been created by Trenitalia (the Italian public Railways service) operating at a loss.

So, a little back-of-the-envelope calculation:

Italian public debt = GDP * 125% = 1838 bln €

Amount on interest on the debt created by Trenitalia: Italian public debt * 16% * 3.5% / (italian population)

where 16% is the percentage of the debt created by Trenitalia, and 3.5% is the interest rate at which Italian bonds are sold.

So, each Italian citizen pays (with taxes) 171€ just in interests on the debt created by Italian Railways. That debt is not going away, Italians pay that amount just to maintain it constant.

Do you still think that our public transportation service is cheap? ",0,1400430761,null,0,1400436218,0,chl2bw5,t3_25usf5,t1_chl2bw5,t1_chl1zwv,null,1433849963,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,TheGodBen,IREL,Ireland,"&gt; The special position of the Roman Catholic Church effectively made the Vatican canon legally binding. as was ruled in Dozens of cases.

Care to name cases? Because I'm unable to find anything about them. What I have found is that the courts recognise Catholic canon law as a valid legal system to be respected, but in the same way that American law or Japanese law are. I can find no evidence that canon law was ever legally binding in Ireland.

&gt; Such as the Fethard-on-sea boycott.

Forgive my ignorance, but which court case? The only reference to a court case I found relating to that incident took place in Belfast.

&gt; Marrying in a protestant church. -This is basically a stupid idea, In a time when converting ends you up disappearing

Firstly, I'm unaware of any cases where people in the republic ""disappeared"" due to converting to a Protestant faith, although I wouldn't be hugely surprised had it happened at some point. Secondly, Catholics did not need to convert in order to get married in a Protestant church, they allowed mixed marriages and without all that ante-nuptial agreement nonsense. It may not have been socially acceptable, but social conventions are a separate thing from the law.

&gt; You can go on claiming that the Church and the state were not the same thing

Nobody denies that the two were far too close, and that the Catholic church was granted undue power and deference by the civil authorities. That is to this country's eternal shame, and it left a mess we're still trying to deal with. But the two were not always in lockstep. Look at the Fethard-on-sea incident you referenced, for example, de Valera opposed the church in that instance and was critical of the boycott.

&gt; You cannot claim that Ne Temere was not legally enforced and then claim the ante-nuptial signed without legal representation within a church are.

That's a fair point. I am not saying that those ante-nuptial agreements should have been legally binding, nor am I seeking to defend the bigotry that underscored the Ne Temere doctrine. But the Tilson case was much more complex than you made it out to be. It did not enshrine Catholic canon law or the Ne Temere doctrine into Irish law.

&gt; It is why the Unionist whack jobs could use the cases so effectively,

The Unionist whackjobs lied and exaggerated all the time, and they had a sizeable audience that were more than willing to listen. The same is true of the Republican whackjobs.
