false,belnui,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Pre-war Warsaw was sprawling, a beautiful city filled with layers of buildings from different ages that gave the city a truly unique look among European cities. It was the polish capital for centuries and withstood countless wars and rebellions.  

The city was bombed early in the war in 1939, when several buildings where hit during the siege, the Royal Castle burnt down and many more houses were destroyed or damaged beyond repair. 

http://i.imgur.com/kCY8Jna.jpg

The city would then be the scene of fierce fighting during the uprising in the summer of 1944. The Red Army refused to cross the Vistula and helped the partisans because they were supported by the exiled government in London. 

Since out of all the cities, Warsaw happened to be  the most troublesome, partisan active capital, it would not only be cleansed of the enemies of the Third Reich, but also be set and example for other occupied major cities. 

Other cities faced similar scorched earth tactics, but Warsaw would be faced with systematic destruction. Several buildings were damaged, palaces houses, administrative centres and urban squares were destroyed by special demolition groups, so by January 1945 the city was a complete ruin.

The reconstruction began after the war and from the 50s it continued in some sections of the city until today. The Old Town was completely restored as the pre-war image. Not all plans were found for all the buildings in the Old Town and some facades were remade after 18th century paintings, and pictures from the 1930s. 

The will to rebuild managed to give the historic centre a new life. Not all the town was remade in its pre-war image and some buildings could not be reconstructed. In these cases new modern houses and building blocks were built, sometimes in a social realist style other times in the international style of late modernism.

The rebuilding took many years and even today some houses are still being rebuilt or renovated, some are being now brought up to their original image by adding details and finishing touches which during the 60-70 were impossible due to lack of funds, the reconstruction effort being a state initiative until the 90s.

Yes, there is.

No, I don't think it would in German culture. If I were to go to Germany, for example, and someone asked me where I was from then I would say ""I am from America."" Saying that I was German in that context wouldn't really make any sense, since I was not born there. America is a country of immigrants, nobody except for Native Americans are ethnically ""American"". I am American by nationality, but I am not a ""real American"" in a sense. Native Americans are ""real Americans"". I say it with quotes, because it has more to do with where your family originates from. To me, it is disingenuous to say that I am American in that way, because I am not Native American. America is an amalgamation of many different people from a countless number of countries who came to this land with many different beliefs, cultures and under wildly varying circumstances. A lot of people who come here tend to remember their roots, so to speak. We see ourselves as being Americans by nationality, but not as an ethnic category. 

It's a different cultural perspective, I guess. I'm having a lot harder of a time explaining it than I thought I would. It's just normal to me. It's just more common here to find out where people's families came from since there is such a huge amount of people who have come from all over. It comes up a lot in friendly conversation with new people and claiming that your family comes from America in a lot of ways implies that you are Native American. I am not Native American, so if people asked where my family came from, I would say ""Germany."" I identify as a German, but not in the same way that someone in Germany identifies as a German.

In terms of teaching, I did a TEFL course while I was out there but honestly, it didn't really matter. It mattered in the sense that it gave me a guideline and the basic principles of teaching, but no one I ever interviewed with ever asked to see my TEFL certificate. If you already have teaching experience then you should be fine.

One thing to worry about is your legal status. I don't know how much you have thought about that but for non-EU, it's a bit of a pain in the ass, especially if you plan on outstaying your tourist visa of 90 days.

I lived in Malasaña, which is a pretty lively place. Lots of bars and restaurants in the area. It's very busy, especially on the weekends. That could be an issue when it comes to noise so be careful about that. If you start looking for a place, I'd take a look at how many bars/clubs are on your street since clubs don't close until 5-6am on the weekends. I made that mistake and lived next to two clubs, one adjacent and the other across the street. Not to mention, the brothel that the prostitutes took their Johns was literally right across the street from me. There were many sleepless nights in the beginning. But not every street of Malasaña is like that so just be sure to look out for those things.

I had a friend who lived by Opera, which is a very nice neighborhood and pretty quiet for the most part. It was a few minutes walk from my place but still centrally located, close to Gran Via and Puerta del Sol.

La Latina is another lively neighborhood. It's south of Puerta del Sol, maybe about a 15 min walk from my old place. But again, lot of bars and neighborhoods. One of the things to do was to go to La Latina on Sunday for afternoon drinks. Every bar pretty much has tables outside on the street where people just enjoy food and drinks.

I guess just find out what suits you. When I moved there I was just shy of 29 but because of my TEFL course and teaching, I was hanging out with a wide range of people anywhere as young as 22 to 43. But that's also when I figure out that age was nothing but a number. I didn't look at these kids as kids and my older friends didn't look at me that way as well. We were all pretty much in the same boat, living in a foreign country just wanting to experience a different side of life. So I partied like I was in college but also maintained some semblance of an adult life by working as well. It was a balance I couldn't really maintain back in New York at that point in my life so really, it's all up to you to have that right mindset going in.

Most likely due to not being familiar with what The Left is like up close. As a lefty (I was rooting for you getting independence), a red green coalition does appear natural. But the SPD, for incomprehensible reasons, keeps inching towards the right to the point at which they're almost indistinguishable from the CDU now and have lost their identity. Might amount to nothing else but political corruption or fear of turning into The Left/pressure to portray themselves as a choice not bound to other parties (Greens). Hard to say.

The Left however, to use /u/Bau_haus's words ^[[link]](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2lgzgp/german_left_party_might_win_first_state_since/clv57ma) , didn't

&gt;put enough distance between themselves and their past. Their officials support Putin, send birthday wishes to Fidel Castro, refuse to deal with former Stasi-members within the party, refuse to openly deal with their past, get fits if forced to call the GDR a Unrechtsstaat... I don't think that they are a threat to democracy now. But if it was for them we'd still live in a dictatorship. The Linke still has a loooong way to go before I can forgive them for what they have done.    
And besides all that, Ramelow is totally not likeable. 

They also want to abolish the Bundeswehr. Again, as a lefty I'm totally fine with reducing military spending and using the money for more constructive things. But there has to be at least some semblance of perspective applied here... abolishing the Bundeswehr while Putin happily annexes parts of eastern Europe is crazy to me.

They want to shut down all German weapons manufacturers. Again, limiting the extent to which people can benefit from the demise of others? Great!

Which was an **absolutely standard modus operandi** for a majority of ""relevant"" countries during that era. Stop looking at things from 21st century perspective and realize that this was a time of Empires, war crimes, covert operations, illegal coups, struggles for independence and so on and so forth. Some citizens of some countries can argue that not much has changed for them in the next 70 years and things remain the same, with countries arbitrarily embargoing them or bombing into oblivion and throwing them into chaos of civil war, while ""NOping the fuck out"" in regards to holding responsibility for their actions.

Poland attacked all of its neighbors? I can only think of minor conflicts for Polish parts of Lithuania/Ukraine . Pilsudski's idea wasn't the reason of this war and Polish government didn't even like the idea of Intermarium so they didn't take whole Belarus and Kiev when signing the Treaty of Riga (Russians weren't against it, it was Polish officials' choice). 
BTW Intermarium wasn't a bad idea, it could have prevented the WW2 (this wiki fragment even mentions it).

&gt;How was Ukrainians and Lithuanians treated in ""Greater Poland"" at the time and prior to that during Commonwealth? 

Ukrainian peasants were treated the same way as Polish peasants in Western Poland during the times of Commonwealth. Lithuanians had their own Duchy during Commonwealth and there weren't many of them in Poland after WW1. I can ask how the life of Ukrainians looked on the Russian side after WW1?

Your country took Eastern parts of Poland during partitions and then after the WW1 you complain that Poland wanted to create little Empire? Then why Russia took this land earlier?

Russia doesn't need any special ""capacity"" in this case. You've confused the countries, as usual. It's not the US whose servicemen are getting expensive training and are paid high wages while they are performing their duties on the other side of the planet.

Have you seen the photos of results of the first fighting for the Donetsk airport? Where a pile of dead boides lying in a small room? I read the story about it in RuNet. Volunteers, who participated in the battle, were hired in the office in Rostov for about $1k per week. Let's count. If a random unemployed dude decides to make some money (why not, right?) killing enemies of mother Russia, how much it would cost?

 - training: may be none or a couple of weeks in the camp. Bless the conscription!
 - equipment, weapon, ammo, ration packs, meds: from the warehouse.
 - transportation: a bus or train ticket ($10-200)
 - wages: ok let it will be as high as $1000 a week, good money, btw.

The country really should consider granting passports to more of the displaced residents, but the requirements for naturalization are not that hard, such that any long term resident who can pass a history treat, and a language test can pass.

The issue is a battle between a nationalist agenda, to protect the Latvian sovereignty and culture, versus the rights of immigrants who have lived there for a long time, often most of their lives. While it is easy to understand the feelings of betrayal, when your government tells you that you have to prove you're citizenship, it is also easy to understand a government's objective to keep people who still don't see the country as independent from voting. To be clear, we are talking about Russian ethnics, who might vote for reunification.

Some key points:
- it is difficult to travel with the alien passport
- it is degrading to suggest that someone has to prove their identity
- it could subvert someone's identity to pass a history test that they don't agree with
- an alien does not officially get representation (vote)
- aliens are well cared for, with access to all other rights and services (other than voting)
- aliens can easily apply for a passport, if they can speak the language

Ukrainians and Russians can do well as neighbors. Orthodox, cyrillic alphabets, similar cuisines and all that. But for fuck sakes, you guys need to get over the whole ""fuck you you no real you belong to us"" bullshit.

Native language is Russian, live all of an hour and a half from the border, and a good 1/5-1/4 of my friends are ethnic Russian. Won't deny we can get along. But the Russian mentality of ""subordinate nations"" has to change. And putin needs to die a long and painful death before any kind of friendly relations can be a reality again.

Belarus honestly are the ones that we feel closest to. Aside from the languages (seriously, mutually intelligible, not even close to Russian-Ukrainian similarities) and history virtually almost identical (until recent days), they are the orthodox, east Slavs that don't have any open hostilities toward us.

The military intervention should start with allied air operations against Russian forces in Ukraine. Russian positions should be pounded barrage of air to surface and cruise missiles to enable Ukrainian forces to capture the Russian held territories. Together with air operations, allied forces should sent military advisers and special forces to the ground to assist Ukrainians in their take down of invading Russian forces.

In the same economic sanctions should be extended to embargo Russia. All items with dual use or ability to enhance Russian capacity to wage war should be embargoed.

I have no doubt you would put up a spirited resistance, and I (along w/ most of the West) would be cheering for you. But infantry doesnt defeat combined air/armor power. Not on the open plains of eastern europe.

And yes you could attempt to pull an afghanistan/iraq and wage a bloody insurgency. Bloody the Russians in a meat grinder. But you have to remember what happens to get to that point. It means your cities have been conquered and people subjugated. A prolonged insurgency against the russians would likely be far more brutal than against americans to the local population. Iraq will take a quarter century to rebuild, even with oil to fund it. And the meat that goes in the grinder is as much your own population, as it is the Russian soldiers.

I wish you all the best if you feel you can go it alone. But the Poles had a fighting spirit as well in WWII. It didnt save them. It alone wont save you.

&gt; Russia, the country you support intervening, has more neo-Nazis than any other country.

What a ridiculous comparison.

Russia has never given Neo-Nazis tanks, machine guns, and attack helicopters and ordered them to kill people with different views. Russian Neo-Nazis have never occupied any governmental posts in Russia, whereas a Ukrainian Neo-Nazi, Andrey Paribiy, was given total control over the armed forces after the Euromaidan ""revolution"". The far-right People's Front, which defeated Poroshenko at the recent elections, was founded, among others, by Andrey Parubiy and Andrey Biletsky, the commander of the Neo-Nazi Azov batallion. Here are some of his goals as a Ukrainian politician:

&gt;""to prepare Ukraine for further expansion and to struggle for the liberation of the entire White Race from the domination of the internationalist speculative capital""

_____

&gt;""to punish severely sexual perversions and any interracial contacts that lead to the extinction of the white man""

Here is another quote by Biletsky:

&gt;The historic mission of our Nation in this watershed century is to lead the White Races of the world in the final crusade for their survival: a crusade against semite-led subhumanity... The task of the present generation is to create a Third Empire -- Great Ukraine... If we are strong, we take what is ours by right and even more; we will build a Superpower-Empire...""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Battalion

When have people openly espousing such views ever been elected to the Russian parliament, much less by the most popular party in the country, according to the recent elections?

A quote from an article on the subject:

&gt;The open incorporation of a Nazi like Biletsky into the party of Yatsenyuk and Turchynov shows that it is no longer possible to separate “liberal democrats” from fascists in the Ukraine. Any lines of distinction have now been blurred. Platforms are shared, political parties are shared, etc.

2/ Le racisme est anecdotique en France. Je ne comprend pas que cette remarque remonte en permanence contre toutes les évidences et les statistiques sur le sujet : la France fait parti du petit club des pays les moins racistes du monde (avec le Mexique, la Belgique ou l'Inde, mais à l'inverse de l'Angleterre et surtout de l'Allemagne et de la Suisse justement).

Pour la xénophobie, en France je n'en connais aucun exemple, même dans les journaux pourtant friands de ce genre de fait divers. Bref, à partir de quelques skinheads désespérés et 10x moins nombreux que les antifas, je ne vois pas de quoi faire une généralité.

Mariage pour tous : tu résumes ça trop facilement à un droit au mariage. Si j'ai bien compris les manifestants (il y en a à mon boulot), ils n'en sont pas contre le mariage en tant que tel, mais contre le but du mariage, c'est à dire les enfants. Et ils sont contre ce qu'ils appellent le ""droit à l'enfant"". En tout cas ce qui est sûr c'est qu'ils ne sont pas homophobes. Mais là encore, si je ne connais pas tous les manifestants, j'ose espérer qu'ils sont les représentants d'une majorité.

Et puis les homosexuels sont égaux devant le droit depuis 2 siècles en France sans interruption. Quel pays sur Terre peut se vanter de seulement la moitié de ça?

Problem is though, any intervention against Russia is unlikely to meet these parameters, and quite possibly would doom us all. A few possibilities:

* Direct west/Russia conflict: likelyhood of nukes being used, high
* Russia would have the lead for the start of this, being next door and all. Annex bits o ukraine before direct contact, threaten nukes. Cold war 2, only this time brinkmanship combined with annexation of territory is allowed.
* Russian defeat. Replacement of putin with government that makes him look moderate and liberal. Or just nukes again
* you get the idea. Seriously though, can you think of any scenario where we go and shoot their sons and this situation get calmed down?

The United States was waging a war across the ocean, in a heavy jungle area which restricted ""traditional"" warfare. The logistics to even land and supply troops for that was a monumental undertaking itself. Russia is directly on your border. You lay upon the the Eastern European plain, its practically BUILT for the kind of warfare that great powers excel at.

I'll admit that I may be underinformed on this next part. However the Ukrainian army has been unable to recapture significant portions of Eastern Ukraine against even the current rebel forces. Granted there are Russian troops involved, but NOTHING resembling full scale moblization. If your forces cant stand and defeat them, I see no way you could imagine them standing against the full might of the Russian army. The current territorial losses were achieved without the large russian air force constantly bombing your forces, and cutting off supply lines.

What in the past several months suggests your army could face the challenge of the **full** Russian army, if you struggle to fully defeat the relatively minor rebels and the russian proxies? 

&gt;an economy in freefall and fighting a nation that of the same ethnicity and religion as you won't rally the support needed. 

Historically the exact opposite is true. Foreign adventurism is often seen and undertaken precisely when a distraction is needed from ailing domestic affairs.

C'est comme ça que je l'ai pris aussi. Parce que ça va complètement à l'encontre de ce que la société nous apprend, et à l'encontre de l'idéal qu'on vise, qu'on souhaiterai obtenir.

Je t'invite malgré tout à persévérer, et à lire jusqu'au bout. A ne pas tout réfuter en bloc et à maintenir, même un tout petit peu, la porte ouverte. A ne jamais totalement rejeter la question ""Putain, et si, au fond, tout cela était vrai ?""

T'es dans une relation en ce moment. T'es heureux, et ça me réjouis. Je suis au lendemain d'une rupture, et dans un sens, il est normal que je cherche des réponses lorsque tu ne souhaites que profiter de la vie. C'est donc aussi normal que je sois potentiellement plus ouvert à cette remise en question, et plus à même de l'accepter.

Cependant, j'ai souvenir de par nos discussions qu'on est passé à peu près par les mêmes choses, et je crois que les réponses à nos questions résident dans ce que ces écrits nous offrent...

Je vais donc t'offrir de prendre la pilule rouge. Il est possible que tu la recraches. Ce n'est pas grave. Tu la recracheras dans ta main, et elle sera toujours à portée de toi. Si, plus tard, dans ta vie, tu en as besoin, elle sera là, à portée de main.
L'important, c'est que tu as à disposition ce savoir. Dans tous les cas, tu es libre de l'embrasser ou de le laisser dormir.


Place aux liens...

La pilule rouge, et l'ensemble de ses connaissances, peut se trouver ici : http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/

Reddit, c'est ce gros forum un peu célèbre. Et TheRedPill, c'est un  sous-forum qui regroupe tous les mecs plus ou moins éveillés. Conseils, témoignages, astuces, théories... Il y a vraiment de tout, et ton chemin pour avaler la pilule passera par un certain temps dans ces lieux : c'est une pilule longue à avaler, et qui nécessite un certain temps de mise en pratique avant de passer complètement.

Ensuite, voilà le ""bouton"" initiateur, l'option nucléaire, l'espère de résumé global qui te fout un gros kick dans le bide, qui te balance une claque dans la gueule. Qui va te pousser à tout rejeter en bloc. C'est la thérapie de choc.

Maintenant, tu lis. Tu lis toute la sidebar de TheRedPill, parce que la majorité des questions que tu te poses sont dedans. Tu lis les exemples. Tu reportes ce que tu lis sur ton passé, sur ce que tu as vécu. Si tu te sens de le faire, tu le reportes sur ce que tu vis maintenant, parce que tu pense qu'elle fera une bonne épouse et qu'elle vaut le coup de la garder près de toi. Ou alors tu te concentre sur toi, tu la laisses évoluer autour de toi, mais tu ne fais plus évoluer ta vie autour d'elle. Tu poses des questions, tu travailles sur ton développement personnel. Tu apprends à être heureux sans avoir besoin d'une femme. Tu deviens un homme. Tu deviens un roc. Tu deviens un pilier de marbre, immuable dans la tempête de l'esprit des femmes auxquelles elles rêvent toutes de s'accrocher. Tu abandonnes tes rêves de garçon de trouver une fille qui t'aimera inconditionnellement, comme maman, et tu deviens un homme, conscient que toi seul peut aimer inconditionnellement, et que l'amour de ta femme sera toujours soumis à un jugement. Que jamais tu ne trouveras de repos, ailleurs que dans tes frères, et que ta femme ne sera jamais le refuge que tu imaginais.

Tu pleures, parce que ça fait peur. Et tu ris, parce que ça y'est, tu sais. Tout ne repose que sur toi, et c'est tellement facile. Le monde est à tes pieds, et tu ne reposes sur plus personne pour être heureux. Bienvenue chez moi.

Well, Native Americans. But if you look back far enough, you can't actually say whether someone is from Germany. We weren't colonized from another continent in recent history though, but there was lots and lots of population movement anyway.

&gt; American is simply just a nationality and not an ethnicity

For me, being American *is* an ethnicity. If your ancestry is Italian and Irish, you scan as:  
*ethnicity*: White US American. *meta-ethnicity*: US American.

It seems that the word ""ethnicity"" means different things to us. I think for me it's largely about a sense of belonging to the same cultural group, shown in shared identification and intermarriage. As soon as Americans start speaking about ""the American people"" or saying ""I'm American"" and it's not uncommon for, say, an American of Irish origin to marry an American of Italian origin -- Americans start being an ethnic group or meta-group.

This is really a very different cultural perspective, and I also find it difficult to explain. I also think it's interesting that you make the comparison to Native Americans. I guess indigenousness is something I just don't really get. Of course I do get the meaning of the word, but dividing people into ""indigenous"" and ""non-indigenous"" just feels alien. In Germany, it simply doesn't exist as a social category. There was a lot of population movement, but a lot of it was restricted to specific areas and as far as I know there was never an extreme difference in technology between the ""old locals"" and the ""newcomers"" as there was in the Americas. Some people have been in their area some centuries longer than others (e.g. Sorbian culture is oder in East Germany than German culture), but then the older culture usually just replaced yet another even older culture.

&gt; I'm sure I've just made it more confusing, but that was my best attempt for now.

I think I do understand, sort of. I get the concepts, but it just feels foreign to me. Well, no surprise... that's the point between the term ""culture"", of course. Thank you very much for your attempt :)!

Edit: I want to add something about this:

&gt; Saying that I was German in that context wouldn't really make any sense, since I was not born there.

By the way, you know which country in Europe is ruled by a multi-billionare who never invented anything or improved a business, and who simply ""privatized"" his wealth from the people to enrich himself? The answer is: 0. 

At least Igor Kolomoysky, who was appointed governor of Dnepropetrovsk after your glorious ""revolution"", does business like a true European gentlemen:

&gt;Kolomyski has used Privat's ""quasi-military forces"" to enforce hostile takeovers of companies, sending a team of ""hired rowdies armed with baseball bats, iron bars, gas and rubber bullet pistols and chainsaws"" to forcibly take over a Kremenchuk steel plant in 2006,[24] and has used ""a mix of phony court orders (often involving corrupt judges and/or registrars) and strong-arm tactics"" to replace directors on the boards of companies he purchases stakes in.[25] Kolomyski was criticized by Mr Justice Mann in a court case in London involving an attempted hostile takeover of an oil company, with the judge stating that Kolomyski had ""a reputation of having sought to take control of a company at gunpoint in Ukraine"" and that there were ""strong grounds for doubting the honesty of Mr Kolomoisky"".[26]

Coach, as /u/YourMindsCreation and /u/Silberschweif have mentioned. However, as cheap as they are, bear in mind that they do take longer. Hamburg, luckily, isn't all that far away from Berlin, but you could still get an extra half-day or even an extra full day in Berlin if you take the train. Also, the train takes you directly into the centre of Berlin, while the coach station is several miles out (but really handy for the Trade Fair, if that's where you're heading).

Another alternative might be car sharing; google ""Mitfahrzentrale"". However, I'm not sure how easy it is to find someone with space for four passengers and their luggage.

€45 isn't a colossal fortune. However, the train drivers have recently been staging some really vindictive strikes, which more and more people are beginning to think have very little to do with pay and conditions and much more to do with a power struggle between competing unions. Whether that dispute will be over by December is by no means clear, but the train drivers' union is doing a good job of timing the strikes for maximum inconvenience to passengers. If you book a train and it's cancelled due to strike action, DB will refund you, but it will still be a real pain. If you decide to go by coach, I'd suggest you book well in advance, in case the threat of strike action creates more demand.

It's one of those pieces of irony: only recently has the law been changed to allow coach companies to compete directly with the railways, and now the train drivers are on strike.

Blaming Vladimir Putin for low oil prices, U.S.-imposed sanctions, and the neo-con orchestrated destruction of Ukraine makes about as much sense as blaming the Easter Bunny.

The sanctions are intended to intimidate and sow mass panic.  It seems facile to say that something good might come of them -- e.g., that they will help Russia to combat waste, inefficiency, inertia and corruption.  But look at how other countries have benefited from sanctions:

* On 19 Oct 1960, the U.S. imposed a ""commercial, economic, and financial embargo"" on Cuba.  What was the result?  Did the government of Cuba collapse?  Was it overthrown?  Did Cuba abandon its independence?  Did Cuba capitulate to U.S. dictates?  No.  The embargo forced the government to become stronger, more resilient, and more resourceful.  Cuba became an innovator in urban argiculture -- see ""Organopónicos"" at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Cuba#Urban_agriculture

* On 06 Aug 1990, the U.S. imposed ""a near-total financial and trade embargo"" on Iraq, a small third-world country with a population of 24 million.  What was the result?  Did the government of Iraq collapse?  Was it overthrown?  Did Iraq abandon its independence?  Did it capitulate to U.S. dictates?  No.  Sanctions led to hundreds of thousands of deaths, while making the government stronger.   After thirteen years of this, U.S. strategists predicted that the take-over of Iraq would be a ""cakewalk"".  Instead, the U.S. met stiff resistance and withdrew after eight years. 

* In 1979, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Iran.  Today, ""Iran sanctions are the toughest the world community has imposed on any country."", according to wikipedia.  What was the result?  Did the government of Iran collapse?  Was it overthrown?  Did Iran abandon its independence?  Did Iran capitulate to U.S. dictates?  No.  The sanctions have made the country more resourceful.  Iran has become a pioneer in science sand alternative energy.

Reuters wants us to believe that sanctions will destroy Russia in a matter of months.  It's up to Russia to prove Reuters wrong.  If far smaller countries have survived far worse sanctions for decades, then surely Russia can survive the next few years.

You should study history better. In the winter war Soviets lost 323 thousand men compared to Finnish loosing 70 thousand men. What ended the war wasn't Finnish defenses collapsing, it was inability to get support from France and UK, and Germans persuading Finns to make peace with the USSR. 

In the end winter war ended to a negotiated peace. Soviets abandoned their aim of taking over Finland and didn't anymore require surrender. Do remember that in the first stages of the war, Finns had already captured Russian transport with Russian language street signs for the soon to be captured Helsinki. To get the peace Finns had to give up Karelia and Vyburg that the Soviets hadn't been able to capture.

I would like to add that after the second world war, there were only three capital cities of countries who had participated to the war that had not been at any time been occupied... These capitals were London, Moscow and Helsinki... Finns don't surrender.

&gt;  I dont mean to be cynical or bash on your pride/patriotism, but you are going up against Russia. Even in their historically weakened current state, they are a top tier military power.

Russia is a third world state with an army and technology that goes with it.

Reason 1: it's not just a cemetery. It contains some of the weirdest and at the same time most impressive tombstone sculptures. I know this kind of artwork is quite peculiar to Italy, as in other countries tombstones are kept really simple. Most of the statues/sculptures are by well known artists and many famous people are buried there.

Reason 2: it's not just a cemetery, it's practically a museum. If you can get a guide, or read something in advance, you will be able to learn the recent history of the city. This association: www.amicidelmonumentale.org can be contacted for guided tours (I'm sorry, the website is in Italian only). They will be able to tell a lot of curious and interesting facts.

Reason 3: in Italy we remember our deads at the beginning of November. People visit the cemeteries and bring flowers to their family tombstones. At the moment the Cemetery is full of flowers and colours, so it's not a dim place. It's also quite relaxing, as it's obviously quiet.

&gt;The __Cimitero Monumentale__ (""Monumental Cemetery"") is one of the two largest cemeteries in [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy), the other one being the [Cimitero Maggiore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimitero_Maggiore_di_Milano). It is noted for the abundance of artistic tombs and monuments.

&gt;Designed by the architect [Carlo Maciachini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Maciachini) (1818-1899), it was planned to consolidate a number of small cemeteries that used to be scattered around the city into a single location.

&gt;Officially opened in 1866, it has since then been filled with a wide range of contemporary and classical Italian sculptures as well as [Greek temples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_temple), elaborate [obelisks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obelisk), and other original works such as a scaled-down version of the [Trajan's Column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan%27s_Column). Many of the tombs belong to noted industrialist dynasties, and have been designed by renowned artists such as [Giò Ponti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gi%C3%B2_Ponti), [Arturo Martini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arturo_Martini), [Lucio Fontana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucio_Fontana), [Medardo Rosso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medardo_Rosso), [Giacomo Manzù](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Manz%C3%B9), Floriano Bodini, and [Giò Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gi%C3%B2_Pomodoro).

Les juges pourraient remettre en question les arguments du gouvernement, demander une enquête, voire même, horreur suprême, exiger un débat contradictoire où les parties seraient représentées par un avocat. En plus, les tribunaux et les parquets surchargés par 20 ans d'inflation législative constante pourraient décider d'allouer leurs maigres ressources à d'autres priorités !

La décision administrative est donc la voie idéale: l'administration sous les ordres de l'exécutif est juge et partie, sans possibilité de débat contradictoire et sans présomption d'innocence. J'imagine qu'à moins d'un artifice particulièrement osé la décision de l'administration de bloquer un site restera attaquable devant le tribunal administratif, mais dans ce cas le délai de procédure pèse sur la victime.

Evidemment que nos députés sont dans leur grande majorité complètement ignorants d'internet, du terrorisme et des réseaux djihadistes. Mais il faut aussi placer cette loi dans un contexte plus large où les politiques qui tiennent les pouvoirs exécutif et législatif affamment et surchargent la justice pour mieux la déclarer inapte et la contourner en se donnant des pouvoirs de sanction au nom de la protection de la population. Aujourd'hui c'est les terroristes, mais simultanément sur d'autres fronts on nous explique qu'il faut se passer de juge pour mieux sanctionner les pédophiles, les fraudeurs au fisc ou les réseaux qui blanchissent de l'argent. Le tout pour votre bien.

What really bothers me [about Germany] is the kind of racism I notice almost on a daily basis.

It's so vastly different from the racism I encountered in the US. In the US, it was just the run-of-the-mill racism you might expect. Like a guy who was claiming that black people kept stealing his stuff when he was in the Army, which was obvious proof that they're a tribal, less civilized race. Or the ""fucking Mexicans take our jobs!"" bullshit that people keep spewing. It's bad, of course, but it's racism at its most basic. It's easy to avoid those people because they don't really attempt to hide their idiocy.

In Germany, there's none of that 18th century ""XYZ people are a lesser people"" stuff; we pretty much got rid of that in 1945. But it's a kind of racism that's almost, well, ""casual"". Like a co-worker who was talking about how, in the movie theater in her neighborhood, a woman could never feel safe because of all those people who walk around wearing turbans. Fuck, she even prefaced it with the stereotypical ""Well, I don't have anything against foreigners..."" Or the adults who horizontally pull on their eyelids while chanting ""ching chang chong!"" after deciding to order Chinese food. Or the ubiquitous ""Those lazy/poor/uneducated Südländer (""Southerners"" = people from Spain, Italy, the Middle East, Northern Africa, you name it.) just don't know any better"". Or the ""you might be able to do that in the streets, but not here!"" after a Ghanaian player committed a basic foul on a German player during the World Cup this year.

Maybe it's less Racism (with a capital R) and more plain ignorance and not knowing just how out of place that sort of shit it.

false,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; Interesting, was this outcome desirable or has it happened accidentally?

It's certainly not desirable. The desired outcome of the threat of sanctions was that Putin gives in and they never come into force. He didn't give in, so there had to be sanctions or the West would have lost all remaining credibility not only in this conflict, but in future ones.

The way I see it, the problem was/is that Putin didn't have a way to take a step back without losing face domestically. He's a populist. The economy has been stalling for years now, so there's nothing he can build his support on but on the ""Russia is strong"" line. Giving in to the threat of sanctions would not exactly support such a statement, and what would he have left then?

This kind of automatism goes back further. The West had to react when Russian soldiers entered Ukraine. Whether that itself was a ""necessary"" action when Yanukovych fled after the Maidan protests is up for debate, but the point is that we've entered a spiral of events that more or less inevitably lead to the next without either side having much influence on the trajectory.  
Needless to say, this is dangerous, because there's a certain risk that Russia ends up as an all-out dictatorship in which Putin has to ensure stability by force, or worse, even as a failed state.

At this point, we're quite far from the original goal of more or less integrating Russia into the West economically and politically. ",0,1415353824,null,0,false,0,clvlpvf,t3_2lifqi,t1_clvlpvf,t1_clvdi4p,null,1426147040,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

In my part of Germany (somewhere in between southern Germany and northern Germany), there aren't any stereotypes about Austrians that I know of, except maybe that Austrians care a lot about titles. Austria simply doesn't get much attention.

My impression from reading Austrian news and other things written by Austrians is that Austria deals with the Nazi heritage quite differently. And if I'm right about this, it might be very important because -- my personal impression, again -- having to somehow deal with that heritage is the core content of modern German identity. It seems like in Germany there was a big cultural break in the 60s/70s or so and in Austria there wasn't, or to a lesser extent. There seem to be more lingering issues with neo-Nazism. (But I think this is not just due to differences between German and Austrian society/culture/whatever. I think other countries also play a large role. Germany is usually associated with the Nazis much more than Austria, and I think the consequences of WW2 were also harsher for Germany than for Austria. So Germany had a lot of help with the ""cultural break"" I mentioned above.)

Introduction

Oil and gas currently play a crucial role in Russia’s political and economic development. The energy sector currently accounts for approximately two-thirds of Russia’s exports, around 30 percent of Russia’s GDP, and almost half of the Federal Budget revenues (Gromov, 2011).

In a few years, the combined population of Russia and its Eurasian cronies will be less than Bangladesh's. In a decade, I can't see Russia being anything other than a country with an economy on par with Moldova's (while the former communist EU countries like Poland and Slovakia and the rest of the world continue to rise), its already sickly demographics fleeing to the likes of China, Germany, and Canada.

The very left will probably vote either for the main left candidate (if it isn't holland and he's somehow popular) or Sarkozy otherwise (and probably anyway at the second turn), to block the FN ('cause they are neo nazi sympathizer and love the invasion of crimea).

Basically :

- PS (""standard"" left wing) : Holland is out. Dunno who they'll push out as of now. 

Maybe Valls, he's basically the left wing's sarkozy that gets shit done (while not selling his soul), and that's well received. 

Aubry and Montebourg are somewhat liked left but i doubt they'll manage to make a majority enough country wide to get elected.

- Very left wing : they know they have little chance to get anyone in post so they'll try blocking the FN by voting sarkozy or whoever is the second on the polls and not insane/FN. Or maybe vote PS.

- Centrists (modem) : Bayroux, but too much like hollande; which will probably keep him out

- UMP (pseudo moderate right wing, think the GOP but less batshit crazy. Maybe the clinton era) : Sarkozy (known as a bit corrupt but they got few other candidates...)

UMP Cope got tossed out for being insanely corrupt and blackmailing people putin style; 

and UMP Fillon will most likely leave the sit to his boss Sarkozy without too much fuss. 

UMP Chirac was very liked by the country (despite stealing *a bit* of cash the guy was mostly honest) but is just way too old :(  Doesn't have the health for another mandate, so the guy retired.

Maybe Jupe, i dunno. He isn't burned but doesn't seem to make big waves either.

- FN : Le pen (half her staff is known or suspected neo nazi sympathizers).

First of all this shows my precise point. Fins DID surrender. They lost significant territory because without foreign intervention from the UK and France, finland could not hold out against Russia. The same is true in Ukraine which is the point of this thread.

Secondly, on the subject of history, the Russians were not attempting to initially annex all of Finland, they wanted a buffer region around St Petersburg, since the border was only around 20 miles from the city. When Finland refused they declared war. At the negotiated settlement they got their initial demands plus more. Finland gave up Vyborg and significant territory in the Southeast,  precisely where the USSR initial demanded. The lost territory consisted of around one third of Finlands economy. That isn't a draw.

In the end, like in finland, without foreign intervention,  I don't think there is a high chance of success. Unlike finland, Ukraine won't likely have the winter to guard them. Secondly putin hasn't just purged a huge portion of his officer corps like stalin did. Third a small but significant portion of East Ukraine sympathize with russia. Finally Ukrainian forces have shown to be unable to push back rebel forces let alone a full invasion. That isnt promising.

And if you think the rich should pay even more, what is your suggestion then? Basically bring all wages to the same level?

There is a middle ground between full-blown marxism (and even in marxist theory not everyone gets the same wage, BTW) and letting the richest get away with not paying their dues.

When the Soviets demanded from Baltic countries that they allow USSR to house troops there they actually did consent to that. There even was military parade in middle of Tallinn together with Estonian and Soviet troops. Unfortunately for the Balts, Soviets were not there really to protect USSR, they were there to take over and annex these countries.

In case of Finland, because Finnish government didn't assent to Soviet demands, the Soviets set up a puppet government and started a war against Finland. The aim was to take over whole Finland, put a puppet government in place to make plea for the newly ""liberated"" Finnish socialist republic to be admitted to be part of the Soviet Union. Luckily for us, Soviets failed on this.

The thing is that Molotov-Ribbentrop treaty enabled Soviet Union to wage war of aggression against its neighbors, occupy them and annex them.

false,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; First of all this shows my precise point. Fins DID surrender. They lost significant territory because without foreign intervention from the UK and France, finland could not hold out against Russia. The same is true in Ukraine which is the point of this thread.

You might want to check the meaning of surrender...

* to yield to the power, control, or possession of another upon compulsion or demand &lt;surrendered the fort&gt;
* to give (oneself) up into the power of another especially as a prisoner 

&gt; Secondly, on the subject of history, the Russians were not attempting to initially annex all of Finland, they wanted a buffer region around St Petersburg, since the border was only around 20 miles from the city. When Finland refused they declared war.

That it is Soviet propaganda. Originally Baltic countries admitted Soviets to house troops there to be as an protection. However it only took short time for those Soviet troops to turn against their host countries, occupy and annex them to be part of the Soviet Union. There is no question that the aim of the Soviet Union wasn't to occupy and annex Finland.

&gt; Finland gave up vying and significant territory in the Southeast, precisely where the USSR initial demanded. The lost territory consisted of around one third of Finlands economy. That isn't a draw.

I never claimed it to be a draw. We lost both wars, but kept our independence and most importantly Finnish as nation didn't die out. If we would have lost Winter War, Soviets would have committed extermination of our intelligentsia and tried to erase our culture and language. In case of the Continuation War, again, if we would have surrendered, we would have had the same destiny as Crimean tattars, extermination and relocation to Siberia.

&gt; Unlike finland, Ukraine won't likely have the winter to guard them. Secondly putin hasn't just purged a huge portion of his officer corps like stalin did. Third a small but significant portion of East Ukraine sympathize with russia. Finally Ukrainian forces have shown to be unable to push back rebel forces let alone a full invasion. That isnt promising

Ukrainians haven't been fighting against rebels, they have the whole time been fighting against Russian armed forces.

Try to get a public tranport ticket for the whole week or whatever time you are there. you will need the transportation and single rides are awfully expensive. You can also use those tickets on the ferries to avoid paying for tourist tours.

You have grocery stores everywhere available, even in the center of the town. Buying stuff there is pretty cheap, actually Germany has one of the lowest relative food prices in the EU.

Eating in restaurants can become costly pretty quickly.

If you go out, try the Reeperbahn, clubs are often free so you can hop from one club to another, especially on the street ""Große Freiheit"".

In reality Russia has been doing all it can to encourage eastern and northern European countries to request NATO cooperation or membership.

------------------------------------------

When perceiving Russia's post-Putin political future, I make two assumptions:

1. There will not be a democracy.

This doesn't seem viable for a nation like Russia- your wealth is in resources, this naturally gravitates towards oligarch systems and oligarch systems prefer autocracy. The absolutely massive leap you'd need in institutions / corruption-fighting / civil society can only be realised by EU membership, which is nigh impossible. *(maybe a bit better if the UK leaves, but then Western Europe would still have to convince Eastern Europe.)* 

2. The next leader will likely be worse. 

Russia has had a history of *horrific* leaders, Putin is a bastion of restraint and compassion relative to many a previous leader. The likelihood of a worse leader is further expanded due to Europeans being unlikely to want to aid the Russian population after 2008 and 2014. 

So who would be your next leader? A different oligarch with more charisma? A different hardline Soviet? Someone who will give free market capitalism another go in your country, right after Putin has severely damaged the ability of Russian society to engage in it?

(1) The attitude of the British public to the EU is different from the attitude of the Dutch public to the EU. Dutch people are more proEU than British people are.

false,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Aren't the falling oil prices a byproduct of one kind of economic sanction, though?

No, they're the result of the global supply and demand. There's many factors at play in that. Here's some of those.

The global demand has been growing slower than expected. This puts downward pressure on the oil prices for oil exporters. For example, China's demand for oil imports hasn't been growing as expected, and the US domestic production has been growing rapidly at the expence of imports.

On the supply side you have things like:   

1. The price cartel OPEC had planned their production expecting greater demand for their exports.  

2. Big exporters have been fighting to maintain their market shares.  
For example a month ago first Saudi Arabia announced a  price discount for exports to Asia and Iran quickly followed causing an additional drop in benchmark prices: [Iran, Saudi Arabia offer massive crude oil discounts to Asia](http://www.timesofoman.com/News/41020/Article-Iran-Saudi-Arabia-offer-massive-crude-oil-discounts-to-Asia)  

3. Rapidly growing new production especially the US tight oil: [check out this graph](http://i.imgur.com/MCYY7Q2.png)    
The US exports only very little crude oil (Why? See this: [History of controls on U.S. oil exports](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/23/usa-oil-export-controls-kemp-idUSL6N0SI37X20141023)). But it is a big consumer and also a big importer. As the domestic production has been rising rapidly there's less demand for imports.   
Hence this week Saudi Arabia, fighting to maintain its market share in the US, announced price cuts for exports to the US: [U.S. Oil Falls to 3-Year Low on Saudi Price Cut](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-04/wti-extends-fall-on-saudi-price-cut-as-u-s-supply-seen-rising.html)  
Needless to say the announcement caused the benchmark prices to drop to record lows: WTI Dec futures $75.84, Brent Dec futures $82.08, and [OPEC Oil Basket Price Falls Below $80 to Least in 4 Years](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-05/opec-oil-basket-price-falls-below-80-to-least-in-4-years.html)    
The move can also be seen as a price battle between the US tight oil producers and Saudi Arabia. Producing tight oil is a lot more costly than drilling it in Saudi Arabia. When the prices fall the tight oil producers make less profit, or some even losses. But apparently the US tight oil producers were not impressed by the Saudi price cut, some even seeing it as an opportunity: [Saudi Flexing Met With Crickets by U.S. Shale Frackers](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-05/saudi-flexing-met-with-crickets-by-u-s-shale-frackers.html)

4. Sooner than expected returning production, such as Libya after having had production disruptions ([see graph](http://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YahARAMSC6JRNazFtZq21EWtjQA=/700x0/filters:no_upscale%28%29/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2332936/iaee4.0.png)) was suddenly up by 280,000 bpd in September.   

etc.

There are many factors behind the falling oil prices during recent months, but basically it's just supply and demand at work. There are also some conspiracy theories about the US and Saudis running the show as complicits, but they're rather silly as things in the real world are much more complex than that.",0,1415360410,null,0,1415369969,0,clvmwkk,t3_2lifqi,t1_clvmwkk,t1_clv89ax,null,1426146486,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

Gli esempi che hai postato usano degli intent per avviare l'attività di riconoscimento. Un conto è far partire esplicitamente un'operazione che dura qualche secondo, un altro è processare di continuo i segnali, c'è una differenza abissale.

Il mio ""credici"" era rivolto all'affermazione ""che il riconoscimento vocale viene fatto su cloud  e quindi non consuma cpu"": la CPU lavora e consuma.

Tu hai parlato di sostiutire un sistema che fa riconoscimento continuo con un cellulare da 100 dollari: a mio modesto avviso, un cellulare da 100 dollari oggi non ha le capacità per fare quel tipo di lavoro.

Inoltre, confermo che per me uno smartphone da 100 dollari è uno smartphone di merda.

Ci sono prodotti a basso costo che nella mia umilissima opinione rendono da un lato accessibile delle tecnologie ad utenti che altrimenti non le utilizzerebbero, ma dall'altro danno un'idea distorta di tali tecnologie non potendo competere qualitativamente con prodotti di fascia superiore: nei primi tempi del touchscreen, c'è stato un fiorire di dispositivi di fascia bassa con display resistivi, mentre fasce più alte usavano i capacitivi. 

Si è formata negli utenti che utilizzavano i display resistivi l'idea errata che il display touchscreen facesse cagare. Ora, tu mi dici che il tuo telefono è una bomba, io ci credo ma non posso fare a meno di pensare che per le mie esigenze non andrebbe bene. Vuoi per un display a risoluzione bassa, vuoi per una fotocamera con pochi megapixel, customizzazione di Android e via di seguito.

Oggi c'è un sacco di persone che fanno foto dei figli con smartphone da 100€, foto da 5 megapixel viste su schermi da 800x600: poi te le fanno vedere e non riconosci neanche che si tratta di un essere umano. Ora, va benissimo se prendi un telefono per quella cifra e lo usi per telefonare e messaggiare; poi però non pensare di sostituire la macchina fotografica, il lettore mp3, il navigatore satellitare con quello, perché sono tutte cose che farà, ma male o molto meno bene di quanto non potrebbe fare una fascia anche di poco superiore; e ai meno ""tech-savvy"" il messaggio che arriverà sarà nuovamente quello di una tecnologia inadeguata, scomoda, superflua.

I'm sure they pay more than €0 - I said they didn't pay their fair share.


&gt; Not every single one of them is in Luxemburg, a lot of them are, but not every single business is. And STILL those that aren't involved in the tax evasion business, they rail in a huge amount of money for the government + creating a whole lot of jobs in the meantime.


That's irrelevant, isn't it? Who decides when to stop, then? Do they get to stop paying taxes when they feel they've done enough? 


Or do we set up some sort of exchange rate where we can break laws compared to how many jobs we create? I mean - the accountancy firm I am one of the owners of IRL employs 26 people. What does that entitle me to, then? Do I get to hit three people in the face for free?

Income taxes in Belgium are comparable to the rest of Europe, especially for the highest incomes. The highest progressive income tax bracket is, actually, at a historic low - it used to be 65%, and it was even higher before. But the highest income *still* dodge taxes. 

You know why? Because they can. And they will continue to dodge them as long as they are able - even if you lower the tax bracket for the richest to 5%. 


You shouldn't feel sorry for the 1% richest people in society. They, after all, don't give a fuck about you, or a fuck about society. They got theirs.

However a harmonisation of tax legislation could be a good idea, there of course would still be some room for adjustments. Optimally all the corporations would be taxed similarly, but this might in part disadvantage places like Luxembourg. But it's important to see that these countries aren't the only ones that do this. The UK and the USA have countless loopholes in their tax codes, yet nobody puts them on the stand, because they are too powerful. 

The main argument by small places is that this is the only way to compete with bigger countries, but I think that argument is only a small part in why a company moves to a place. The availability of infrastructure, qualified personnel, ease of doing business, stability, rule of law and many other factors are just as fundamental.

Man kann sich als Christ eben NICHT heraussuchen, ob man bei einer Sache dem AT oder dem NT folgt. Alle schlechten Dinge hat Jesus aufgrund Gottes Auftrag revidiert. Wenn also das AT sagt, dass ich dem, der mir Schaden zugefügt hat, denselben Schaden zufügen darf, steht das NT dem gegenüber und sagt, dass ich ihm lieber verzeihen soll, bevor die Sache in Blutrache ausartet. Wenn im AT steht, dass ich Zauberer/Hexen umbringen soll, dann macht sich das NT vor dem AT breit und erinnert mich an Jesu Worte im Fall der Ehebrecherin, die gesteinigt werden sollte (Wer ohne Sünde ist, werfe den ersten Stein). Du kannst dich nicht ""Christ"" nennen und Christus ignorieren.

Klar gibt es auch Menschen, die sich so nennen und sich nicht an Jesus halten. Das hat aber weniger mit dem AT zu tun, als mit der Tatsache, dass jeder Mensch ein Sünder ist. So ist das nun mal. Außerdem: Wenn ein christlicher Afrikaner sich entscheidet mit einer anderen/fremden Frau zu schlafen, dann ergibt es auch keinen Sinn, dass er sich gegen ein Kondom entscheidet. Erstere Sünde wurde von Jesus persönlich erklärt. Meiner Meinung nach wäre diese Situation für den afrikanischen Mann in dem Fall ein wenig seltsam, wenn du verstehst: Die einzige den ""Leib Jesu"" beschmutzende Sünde begehen, dann aber auf ein Stückchen Gummi zu verzichten halte ich für eine kaum in Anspruch genommene Praxis. Das alles gilt natürlich nicht unter Ehepartnern.

Nochmals zum Verhältnis AT-NT: Dieses ist in der Bibel, natürlich im NT, klar geregelt. Paulus erklärt z.

Russia doesn't see Baltic countries as a threat to their security. Russia does see NATO as a threat to their security. Hence in any security considerations they will always see it as NATO expansion instead of Baltics joining NATO. 

e.g. Imagine you own a local shop, and there is another smaller shop nearby which doesn't really offer you too much of a competition. One day this shop was bought out by a giant supermarket chain and greatly expanded so it now cuts into your profits. Now on your next directors meeting you will probably be discussing the threat of this giant supermarket chain expansion instead of thinking how it was probably a good deal for that small shop owner.

Competition is not inherently good. It can improve things as it can force everyone to do and be their best. But only according to the rules of the competition.

Competition also leads to hostile work environments, proliferates selfishness, greed and other bad behaviour. It advantages socia-paths, marginalizes the disadvantaged and hole host of other problems. And lastly it always produces winners and losers. And often the number of winners is much smaller than the number of losers.

Cooperation on the other hand requires trust, but overall leads to a better and more equal society. 


As for tax competition: Tax competition is of course is not inherently bad. Bureaucracies tend to bloat and require more and more money. Tax competition tries to  counter this development by letting bureaucracies compete against each other for the funds. 

This can become problematic, because at some point a country can no longer cut taxes without slashing the budget and ending policies. These are often social welfare, education, research and other necessary expenditures.

Hier versucht man nun wieder mal eine besondere Gefährlichkeit auf Hörensagen herbeizufantasieren, in der Hoffnung der Lucke möge doch endlich mal von einem so richtig rechtsextremen Deutschen abgelöst werden, am besten Udo Vogt. 

Dann wäre das Weltbild endlich wieder in Ordnung. 

Wird nur nicht passieren. In der AfD gibt es eben auch unterschiedliche Flügel, natürlich ist das bei ihr ein Skandal sondergleichen. Dümmliche Stimmungsmache in der Hoffnung auf Rettung von oben.

Die AfD wird 2017 mit der CDU eine Regierungskoalition bilden und dann darf der EUropean weiterhin zetern und unter #NichtMeineRegierung weiterhin aus seiner Fantasiewelt berichten.

Ich frag mich ja wieso die linksgrüne Presse es nicht rafft, dass je inflationärer sie mit dem Rechtsextremismusbegriff um sich schmeißt und je breiteren Bevölkerungsgruppen sie das unterstellt, desto stumpfer dieser Vorwurf wird.

Jemand fordert ein Zuwanderungssystem wie in Kanada? Rechtsextrem!
Ein Einschränken des Asylmissbrauchs um Asylberechtigten besser zu helfen? Rechtsextrem!
Mehr Polizei? Rechtsextrem!
Ende der Bankenrettung? Rechtsextrem!

Mittlerweile ist es ja rechtsextrem sein Kind in den falschen Kindergarten zu schicken. Dieser Vorwurf zieht einfach nicht mehr.

Zudem hat dies auch einen sehr negativen Effekt. Jene, die wirklich dem rechtsextremen Spektrum zuzuordnen sind, die Ausländer jagen und Asylantenheime anzünden, deren Tun wird damit relativiert. 

""Ach die waren nur rechtsextrem? Werden nur so hart bestraft weil die sich ein gerechteres Asylsystem wünschen."" 

Aber so ist das eben mit allem, ob Nazi-, Rassismus-, Patriarchat- oder welcher anderen Keule auch immer, die linksgrüne Presse hat diese so oft genutzt anstatt in einen Dialog einzutreten und ihre eigenen Ansichten zu verteidigen, dass es heute niemanden außer die Linksgrünen mehr kratzt ob in der AfD nun Rechtsextreme rumrennen oder nicht. Für den Großteil der Bevölkerung sind das nämlich normale Menschen wie der Lucke, so weit ist der Begriff mittlerweile gefasst.

Let me add a little something to this. The EU is strictly forbidden from running a deficit. Its power has significantly expanded in the past few years, notably in economic governance. Cameron still forced a reduction in its budget last year (which MEP fought vigorously) already as a matter of principle based on national politics. But the budget was planned by integrating back payments that the EU is now requiring from a few of its members.

So to sum up: If the UK doesn't pay, as the budget is already tight (mostly because of the UK), the EU will risk running a deficit and will thus be forced to shut down some of its programs (e.g. Erasmus).

I understand the importance of national politics but there is such a thing as a European general interest. I think that's the real issue here.

They've used Russia's weakening economic state to price gouge them on that big fuel deal a few months back, but that's about it. Ukraine's not a big enough issue for anyone to get super involved in. 

I have no idea why you think that they'll matter in this conflict though. They might be the wave of the future, but at the moment that's basically theoretical. These countries don't agree on much of anything as it is, and the big three (Russia, India, China) all consider each other as rivals and potential threats. The idea that China (or really anyone else) is going to side with Russia over the West is a little silly, seeing how deeply tied the Chinese economy is to the American one. And of course, Brazil and South Africa aren't exactly superpowers, and have almost no stake in the game whatsoever, so their ability to apply much pressure in either direction is pretty negligible. 

Further, I'm also not quire sure why you think that Putin will be running the show. Even if the BRICS solidify into a major power (instead of a hypothetical boogyman), Russia's going to be a junior partner.

If a war between two major nuclear powers is not a limited one, it would inexorably move towards total defeat for one side - bringing in strategic strikes - or ever increasing steps, such as tactical strikes - in themselves seeming likely to lead to strategic strikes. This is the so called nuclear escalation theory.

Presumably Russia would be more likely to use them, as the hypothetical conflict would be on the doorstep to their heartland, and so any conventional force losses would pose an existential threat to them. A western forces loss would be pretty serious though, essentially destroying NATO's credibility and so could possibly incur strikes.

The west is only offering mild support (intel, training, nonlethal supplies, possibility of direct arms) to keep it a vague proxy war - because direct intervention would be a ridiculous escalation.

If Russia is able to escalate an international conflict to a point where the majority of the planet's population considers Russia the morally superior player against an evil imperialist West, this will have grave consequences in the long term and is something Western leaders will feel the pressure of. 

'The West' has been working fairly hard in recent years to integrate other valuable nations into its systems- I think we'd actually like South America to become part of 'the West', and China seems to be maturing into a healthy state as well. *(Not all that sure about India, they freak a lot of people out.)* A change from cooperation-oriented to aggression-oriented, no matter how the scales are balanced, would be a big problem.

The main threat is not so much if BRICS will hit the West economically- this simply won't happen, Russia is insignificant, they won't do it. But how will they **feel** about the Ukraine-Russia conflict? Their emotions, their persuasions, their thoughts. These things matter more than us 'rational' humans are willing to admit.

Germany, chose to invoke the transitional measures to block the

The family invited you, so they probably know you. Just be yourself. Don't be late, a bit early (but not too much) is fine.

In this instance it's about not taking in more debt, which in big enough quantities weakens an economy as well. Beyond that the main component in austerity that can be argued to work against economic recovery is spending, and you can make that easier by targeting your taxes differently, for instance. 

Austerity has its place and time and currently it's a top contender in Europe. Many countries have taken in more debt to boost spending, but the amount of growth gained has not been enough to justify it in many eyes. In part it's because of the volatile situation of the economy, but what follows is still the same. After a certain point you can't afford to take in more debt. It's better to react sooner than later.

Many of the measures revolving around austerity give the economy room to adjust. Granted it's not always in the better direction, but during a longer time period it'll average itself out.

was basically the way things were during the Cold War. However, things have changed dramatically since then, especially in the last decade. China, for instance, is and independent country who clearly don't need no sphere of influence. South American countries that have been firmly under the thumb of the U.S. for decades have become rightfully bolder about telling the U.S. to go fuck itself. Turkey certainly isn't run by the hard-line secularist that the US would prop up in the past. Vietnam is doing fine on its own.

Sostituendo il meccanismo attuale (registratore di cassa) con una soluzione integrata, è possibile risparmiare in costi di gestione e offrire un sistema più sicuro e comodo ai clienti.

Il tutto si svolge con un registratore di cassa collegato a Internet a cui è aggiunto uno schermo LCD.

Questo permette al cliente di decidere se effettuare la transazione in modo tradizionale (pagando in contanti, e ricevendo uno scontrino) oppure in modo elettronico, mostrando sull'LCD un QR Code che può essere scansionato e pagato direttamente dal cellulare(1).

In questo modo il venditore mette il dato di vendita a disposizione del programma dell'Agenzia delle Entrate, che calcola in automatico l'importo delle tasse da pagare sull'attività, mentre il cliente può scegliere se essere identificato nell'acquisto (ad esempio per il recupero dell'IVA) o se rimanere anonimo.

Il tutto si può integrare con un sistema di tracciamento della filiera che ho gà sviluppato con mySQL, e fornire una esperienza di vendita senza precedenti in mercati ad alto valore aggiunto (ad esempio la vendita di un culatello o di un paio di scarpe)

The EU council agreed to cut the EU budget, at a time that EU member states are cutting their own national budgets. The UK was one of a group of countries (including notably The Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark) that wnated the EU budget to be cut.

When the EU council agreed to cut the EU budget, they already decided what programmes should be cut and agreed contributions based on that budget.

The recent set of adjustments are not currently needed by the EU.

false,TheAppleManSam,UNSA,Dirty South,"**Against (*in the case of intervening to oust Russia from all of Ukraine*)**.

For one simple reason: *Conventional superiority of NATO &amp; the almost guaranteed use of tactical nuclear weapons by Russia because of it.*

If we intervene in Ukraine, we will win, we will route the Russians, and I have no doubt that the Russians *will* deploy tactical nuclear weapons to cover their retreat and/or force a stalemate because of that. Then we'll inevitably return the favor in kind until escalation to ICBMs or deescalation into a stalemate. 

*Best Case Scenario:* Only big chunks of Ukraine become radioactive wasteland.

*Worst Case Scenario:* Huge chunks of the entire world become radioactive wasteland as we escalate to ICBMs &amp; wide-spread thermonuclear warfare. 

I think we should be supplying the Ukranians with as much aid, both military &amp; civil, as we can. Even training them in neighboring NATO countries. We should step up intelligence sharing &amp; perhaps even send in covert special ops teams conducting black ops in support of the Ukrainian government. Not to mention keeping up the pressure with economic sanctions against Russia.

But Ukraine is not in NATO. It is not even in the EU. While I would be okay with going nuclear over the Baltics, pissing blood &amp; loosing my hair because of it, we have to draw the line somewhere. And in my opinion, that line is NATO, and possibly the EU in general. But NATO is the only one who deserves unshaking support in such a scenario. 

**However (*in the case of intervening in only Western Ukraine to deter Russia*):**

If we were to intervene in Ukraine, our best bet would be to stop at the border of East Ukraine. It'd split Ukraine in two, kill any chance of reunification for generations, if not a century or more, but West Ukraine would be safe at the expense of Russian domination in East Ukraine, while probably avoiding the above nuclear confrontation. Although any chance of Ukraine being a single, cohesive &amp; united entity would be dead in the water with such a move.

&gt; But when you meet a person of obviously migratory background in germany it is pretty rare that that person's use of the german language is perfect and eloquent.

May I ask where you live? I live in the Ruhr Area, and my experience here has been very different. It's relatively common for people of such a background to speak German like a native speaker (maybe they actually *are* native speakers), and there are many others who sound like native speakers in grammar etc. and just have a slight accent. ""Accent stereotyping"" does exist here, too, but I think it's somewhat less linked to ethnicity.

By the way, I think German might really be hard to learn. I'm currently learning Turkish and I see a big difference: Turkish grammar is relatively uniform, at least the parts of grammar you learn as a beginner, while German is full of irregularities and rules with a pretty narrow scope (e.g. different adjective inflections depending on whether there's a definite or an indefinite article).

I don't understand why Cameron is putting so much at stake. From what it appears, he's now shoving his biggest allie on this matter (the Netherlands) aside, making any political succes practically impossible. The postponing of the payment is a reasonable compromise, for now. I think he's overplaying his hand by demanding more. He could have used this matter to create a coalition of countries that want extensive European reform. He is now making demands out of selfinterest that cannot be fullfilled. 

Because, let's not fool ourselves, Cameron is completely right to complain that this adjustment is ridiculous and counterproductive. His speech is spot on. There is something terribly broken with the current method of delivering the adjusted contribution *one month* before it's due to be paid. But he won't create much support against this by merely focusing on Britain's problems with it. There are many people that would like a less intrusive, more practical form of European government in countries like the Netherlands, France, and Italy. Who all have their own UKIPs to deal with, because Eurosceptiscism isn't something unique to Britain. Why doesn't Cameron appeal to those people? Why is he under the impression that the EU can't be changed?

Perhaps it's a sign of poor diplomacy, since the UK's reputation within the EU hasn't improved in any way over the past few years. Perhaps it's nothing more than pandering to the nationalistic voters. However one thing is certain to me, Cameron could have created something more positive out of this issue, something that would have changed the way the EU operates. If he continues to act like this, he will achieve nothing but a broad grin on Farage's face.

Once you begin expanding, where are the borders? 

You must always see this development in time. Now NATO seems to revert to having an enemy: Russia and terrorism-harboring regimes. In the nineties there wasn't an enemy, it was more of a gathering of Western countries, a group the Eastern Europeans wanted to belong to. 

The expansion towards Georgia brought upon by geopolitical reasons showed that the NATO's identity was reverted, as well under renewed pressure from Russia. 

You can construct multiple narratives. Russians might say Western-Europe and the US encroached upon their sphere of influence. People from the West may claim that those countries joined their flag because it invokes liberal values and a sense of security.

Ich muss das mit den Regulierungsbehörden besprechen. Aber wir müssen die Profitabilität solcher Investitionen erhöhen, indem wir etwa den Anbieterwechsel für eine gewisse Zeit untersagen. Ich rede nicht von Monopolen auf ewig, sondern über einige Jahre, in denen man als Investor Planungssicherheit hat. Ähnliche Ausnahmen gibt es auch bei den Energienetzen.

Schon lustig. Weil die Kunden auf eine mglw. langjährige Vertragsbindung keinen Bock haben muss man sie also dazu zwingen? Man hat doch jetzt schon kaum die Wahl als sich für 24 Monate an ein Unternehmen zu ketten und bei Angeboten mit monatlicher Kündigungsfrist gibts den 'Treuenachlass' mit dem man sonst geködert wird nicht. Wenn die Unternehmen davon ausgehen könnten, dass 2+ Jahre Vertagsbindungen vom Kunden angenommen werden würden, würden sie das doch schon längst tun, aber niemand ist so bescheuert sich freiwillig so einen Vertrag an die Backe zu kleben.  
Und ihr wollt nicht, dass die Kunden bei jeder Gelegenheit zur günstigeren Konkurenz wechseln? Dann lasst Bestandskunden z.B. mal an Angeboten für Neukunden teilhaben.

false,Lelien,Normandie,Normandie,"&gt; Pour le mariage pour tous, ce que je n'ai pas aime, c'est qu'ils revendiquent le fait d'avoir un enfant mais veulent empecher les autres d'en avoir. Une femme celibataire, ou droguee ou alcoolique a tous les droits sur un enfant, mais un COUPLE de meme sexe ne peut pas. Btw je suis enfant d'homo, et un parent est un parent, leur vie sexuelle ne nous concerne pas.

Si j'ai bien compris leur concept central de ""droit à l'enfant"", ce que je ne peux pas garantir, ils pointent du doigt qu'un couple hétérosexuel fait des enfants naturellement, et que la PMA sert à palier un handicap. Or pour une fois - ils ne sont pas à une contradiction près tu notera - ils considèrent que l'homosexualité n'est pas un ""handicap"" mais un choix, et que donc les couples homosexuels n'ont pas de ""droit à l'enfant"".

Pour ma part, je n'ai pas d'avis anti ou pro mariage homo. Je trouve que les pro mariage-homo et les manifestants anti sont finalement tous deux aussi réactionnaires, le mariage étant de toute façon une institution réactionnaire. Du coup pour moi la critique qui consiste à conspuer les anti mariage-homo pour leur conservatisme tombe à l'eau. Je t'épargne les arguments en faveur du mariage homo, vu que tu dois déjà les connaitre par coeur étant donnée ta situation personnelle.

Cause I think not wanting to associate with foreign people by limiting their existing rights to access your neck of the woods ""due to a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity"" is pretty much the definition of xenophobia. 

Just to clarify: do you think there should be open borders all over the whole world? No limits on immigration anywhere at all?

Wanting there to be limits on immigration from the EU can have a variety of reasons though, many of which can be nothing to do with xenophobia. Reasons could be: (i) impact on salaries, (ii) impact on infrastructure, (iii) impact on countries from which the immigrants have come, (iv) impact on housing shortages etc.

The reason for the bill was the change in the way GDP is calculated across the EU. The new system includes things like drugs and prostitution. Including these things has lead to many EU economies seeing their GDP rise a sizeable amount overnight.

There is actually a very good reason why many EU countries would want their GDP to look bigger than it actually is.

Governments of European Union members are not supposed to let their annual deficits exceed 3 percent of GDP or accumulated debt exceed 60 percent of GDP. They can suffer fines and penalties if they do.
This is the real reason black market economies are now being included, there are many EU countries in dire financial situations, and they want their economies to look bigger to avoid these penalties. The inclusion of unregulated economies makes the GDP of many European nations look higher, and makes Europe look like it is in a better financial position than it actually is.

false,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; I think that closed borders throughout most of the world is an unfortunate reality of current world politics - the emphasis being on ""unfortunate"".

Essentially, you're saying that you think that there should be some limits on immigration currently and your reason is not a xenophobic one. 

Given this, I think it is somewhat odd that you think that others who thing that should be limits on immigration must be xenophobic.

&gt; I think the current situation is the product of centuries of tribal-thinking that eventually resulted in the formulation of the nation state: i.e. an entity that, in placing greater value on its members than on outsiders, is by definition xenophobic.

The nation state is not be definition xenophobic. It doesn't place greater value on its members than outsiders.

&gt; It is sad that people would oppose this huge step forward.

People's motivations for opposing the EU are varied. They might include, for example, that it does not represent greater governance or democracy.

&gt; As far as I know there haven't been any studies measuring xenophobia in the UK per se. However, there has been plenty of documentation measuring the rise in negative feeling against immigrants under the label of other euphemisms, such as ""concern about immigration"". See for example 

I find your argument circular, as follows: 

- You are arguing that people who want there to be limits on immigration are xenophobic. 

- My argument is that they might have another reason for wanting limits on immigration which is not xenophobic (and you yourself have just shown that this is possible). 

- Therefore you cannot argue that an increase in concern about immigration means that there is increased xenophobia. 

&gt; "", the ""reasons"" you give for limits to immigration do not apply to intra-EU immigration at least, which, as recent reports have explained, actually add to the UK's finances

These aren't my reasons (I personally am very pro-immigration) they are just reasons that others might give that are not xenophobic. Even if these reasons are wrong, they still don't demonstrate xenophobia. They just demonstrate that someone is wrong or misinformed. Also, the adding to the UK finances (which I don't dispute) is not conclusive. Not everyone in the UK is impacted in the same way by an addition to the UK's finances. And it also does not address the impact on the countries from which the immigrants come.

That put a bunch of jobless military men &amp; organizers on the streets with no hopes of advancement in many cases other than joining the insurgency, which only helped rip open sectarian strife.

FYI there was a very well sourced thread on askhistorians about that one. 

France wasn't ready when they declared war, but they had a plan ready with the poles: roughly put, the poles were to slow the german down and move toward their eastern border (keeping their army able to put a fight to force Germany to stay there) and after readying up France was to push into Germany - still not ready to fight them head on, but banking on the two fronts advantage and forcing the germans on the defensive westward. A lot of german industry was on their western part and they planned to take it quickly before Germany could re-mobilize properly.

What happened is that once the poles got east, the soviets came in against them. They were trapped and folded quickly. War wouldn't be two fronts anymore, Germany had no threat east, and France was not able to take them head on, so they abandoned the offensive plans and prepared for defense, the rest is history.",0,1415376299,null,0,false,0,clvsmi0,t3_2lk62x,t1_clvsmi0,t1_clvkunv,null,1426143748,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

I don't know why.

This does not mean people are all unemployed, it means they try to make a living selling each other things and building each other houses. But there is no real job, like a factory, that would ""export"" products outside the town so it would bring outside money into the town.  Imagine a 20K tiny island nation without any exports and you can see why it would suck.

How does this work in Austria? How what does a small town like Kapfenberg ""export"" in the sense of making products and selling them outside the town so to bring in money to the town and its citizens?

You're missing the point. Russia *had* a multi-party democratic  system after the February revolution. In fact, it had *two*: The Duma, and the Soviets, that were competing.

It was first after the Bolsheviks didn't get the support they thought they were due that they first wrested control from the Duma and vested it in the Soviets (EDIT: this is the point of the October Revolution; the Czar was overthrown in the February revolution), and subsequently started restricting the participation in the Soviets, initially by introducing all kinds of rules designed to exclude groups that did not support them.

Once they'd gotten rid of enough opposition that way, their hands were free to get far more brutal.

&gt; Change will only take place if supported by 80% of the population in open and fair elections.

Saddam Hussein insisted he got upwards of 98% in what he insisted was open and fair elections. the DDR regime insisted it was elected in open and fair (multi-party) elections. Never mind that the other parties ""voluntarily"" joined an electoral block with them and ""voluntarily"" accepted a formula for allocating seats that left the SED in absolute control.

If you think this will prevent anything, you are hopelessly naive.

That is false, btw. China is very defensive of what it considers its sphere of influence. It's why China is so protective of its borders and economic zones. It's why North Korea is still around: China props up the regime so the US can't get a foothold so close to it's border. It still inflames resentment of Japan whenever possible.

Now the key difference between China and the Soviet Union is that China so far has not shown any interest in playing political games outside of areas that border it. They do not do excursions in south america to destabilize governments and other shit like that. But don't mistake that as a lack of desire to have a sphere of influence, because they very much have one.

Edit: I just also wanted to add that China's enforcement of its sphere is also much less blunt than the USSRs ever was. Vietnam (traditionally antagonistic toward China) doesn't have to worry about China invading, for example.

1. After the Soviet Union fell apart, the US was seriously considering ending NATO as its purpose seemed moot.
2. This terrified the eastern nations who saw NATO as the only guarantee of security, and they lobbied extremely hard to repurpose NATO and join it.
3. The timing of all of this was such that they were able to get (though various means) Yeltsin to agree publicly and in writing that Russia is OK with them joining NATO, even though they weren't.
4. Russia's elite was and is still very sore about this, and at the end the Russian policymaker ominously said that there will be a price for doing this (this was made in 2011).",0,1415378139,null,0,false,0,clvtme6,t3_2lkgqa,t1_clvtme6,t3_2lkgqa,null,1426143282,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

So don't worry about visiting Germany with your GF. I don't get stared at, I have never in my life had a stranger come up to me wanting to touch my hair or so.

I'm am very disappointed of this part of reddit. I thought this was a place based on reason and thought.
Never the less, I got into the topic a little bit deeper and found a scientific article about the issue. It is stated there, that even though many politicians on both sides stated, that a pledge about a NATO expansion to the east has been constituted, after a revelation of then declassified documents of the time it was shown *""unmistakenly that no such pledge was made""*. So this acticle says I was wrong, and since I don't know it better, I accept this of course. But I really would have liked to be proven wrong not by myself, but some of the downvoters..

Let's say we intervene. It's damn well guaranteed NATO will route any Russian forces in Ukraine. And since [Russia considers limited nuclear strikes to be *""de-escalation""*](http://thebulletin.org/why-russia-calls-limited-nuclear-strike-de-escalation), it's pretty much inevitable that they'll deploy tactical nukes to not only cover their retreat, but force a stalemate. And it's almost inevitable we'll respond in kind.

So now we have situation where if we deescalate, parts of Ukraine are radioactive wastelands, and if we escalate to ICBMs, large chunks of the globe are radioactive wastelands. 

And Ukraine still remains divided. 

The only hope NATO has of intervening in Ukraine without setting off a nuclear confrontation is if we stop at East Ukraine's border &amp; allow Ukraine to be divided, *ala* East-West Germany or North-South Korea. Of course this would make any chance of Ukraine remaining a united, cohesive entity being dead in the water.

Half-of-me actually thinks that's what Putin wants, since it'll give him the *cassus belli* to flood East Ukraine with troops and keep it in Russia's sphere-of-influence.

But if we want Ukraine to remain united, if we want Ukraine to remain a single country, all the hope we have is to stay on the sidelines, play Russia's game of limited warfare, and hope through enough military/civil aid, perhaps even training missions in NATO countries &amp; even CIA or covert spec ops missions in aid of Ukraine, as well as the intelligence sharing that goes with it, Ukraine will be able to throw off he yolk of Russian occupation independently.

People tend to forget just how scary nuclear warfare is, and just how long Western leaders will have to think of it's cost if, for say, Russia launches a lightening strikes on the Baltics and deploys tactical nukes there with the threat of using them if the EU tries to dislodge them conventionally.

Wars like that will be decided in their opening moments, and a Russian offensive would have to be repelled in a quickly &amp; timely manner before they could establish control &amp; begin to dig in.

An things like that require power projection &amp; speed of response. Two things Europe is severely lacking in comparison to America. The wars of tomorrow, in my opinion, are going to be quick, limited &amp; decisive for those very reasons, hence why you have countries like China focusing on those very things in their military doctrine.

Luckily America would never allow a NATO country to fall because it'd undermine every other alliance we have on the planet. We also have the largest reserve of expeditionary forces &amp; most expansive power projection capabilities on the planet to prevent that very type of thing from happening. 

But who knows where NATO, or America, will be in twenty years. Who knows what will happen if America has to fight something like that while simultaneously dealing with the same type of war in South China Sea. One or the other could end in full-blown nuclear war if Russia is confident enough in starting it *(especially if America looks distracted by China &amp; has less power projection assets in Europe)*, but America is committed to finishing it should, for example, we actually loose the Baltics in those opening battles &amp; move to take them back no matter the cost *(which I very well could see us doing)*.

I don't think it's something that we should be seriously concerned about now, but in a generation or twenty years it could be a very real possibility if Europe doesn't up it's military spending and/or strengthen EU military integration.

false,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Yes they have been fighting a small FRACTION of Russian armed forces. And they are losing, or at the very least not advancing. Russia isnt using tens of thousands of infantry. They arent using full tank columns (only a dozen tanks here or there) to smash deep into Ukraine. They arent using air power. They arent launching ballistic missiles. They arent using the full massive barrages of artillary they are capable of. And despite this Ukraine is struggling.

Ukraine also isn't fighting with its full power. If they would, they could just pound Donetsk with artillery fire until there would be no Russian soldiers nor anybody else living there. However they aren't doing that because they are still fighting to protect the people of area. However that could change if the Russian army continues its invasion.

And in case of the Russian military power. They had quite much people fighting in the eastern Ukraine with casualties that haven't been small compared to the size of the fighting force. If casualties would be no problem, Kremlin wouldn't be hiding the numbers. 

Just for reference, in 2003 invasion of Iraq, US and UK lost total 172 persons, and they successfully took over a whole country. When you compare the whole operation in Ukraine to what US &amp; UK did in Iraq, you get the real sense of fighting ability of the Russian army. 

&gt; I mean its not a national embarrassment that Ukraine would need help to defeat what is likely the 3rd/4th most powerful single military in the world. Is it really that outrageous or offensive to think Ukraine couldn't stand against such a force who is on their border without help? Most countries would lose a land war with Russia

It is not national embarrassment for Ukraine as they are fighting their hands tied. And yes, eventually Russia could take over Ukraine, but not without 10s of thousands of killed and wounder soldiers, and that is the key. Would the Russian people really accept their boys coming in body bags in their thousands? Again for reference, in the first Chechen war Russian losses were 5732 killed, and this just after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the Red Army still had good better moral and newer weapons.

A swift and decisive end to the insurgency-cum-invasion of Ukraine so that the region may begin to stabilize and rebuild.

&gt; Let's say we intervene. It's damn well guaranteed NATO will route any Russian forces in Ukraine. And since Russia considers limited nuclear strikes to be ""de-escalation"", it's pretty much inevitable that they'll deploy tactical nukes to not only cover their retreat, but force a stalemate. And it's almost inevitable we'll respond in kind.

I'm going to cut your post in half here because it's dealing with pure speculation and empty threats.

An autocratic regime spouting propaganda about burning all infidels with nuclear fire is one thing. Actually acting on that and thus initiating the first nuclear war in history is quite another. As much as Putin uses jingoism to shore-up support at home, at the point that he's actually deploying nuclear deterrents he becomes a danger not only to the rest of the world but every Russian citizen living under him. It would be absolute madness for him to use his tactical nuclear arsenal, so he won't.

&gt; Half-of-me actually thinks that's what Putin wants, since it'll give him the cassus belli to flood East Ukraine with troops and keep it in Russia's sphere-of-influence.

There is no end-game where Russia initiates World War 3 and gains Ukraine, and *certainly* not one where Ukraine remains a productive member of RuFed. It simply doesn't exist.

&gt; But if we want Ukraine to remain united, if we want Ukraine to remain a single country, all the hope we have is to stay on the sidelines, play Russia's game of limited warfare, and hope through enough military/civil aid, perhaps even training missions in NATO countries &amp; even CIA or covert spec ops missions in aid of Ukraine, as well as the intelligence sharing that goes with it, Ukraine will be able to throw off he yolk of Russian occupation independently. 

Allow me to refute this very succinctly; I don't see why we should remain on the sidelines if a sovereign nation is being outright invaded by another, especially when that nation was non-aggressive and has made sustained good-faith motions for EU and NATO application. You've bought Putin's narrative that if you stand up to him then only nuclear death will follow, and if you want to bend to Cold War era thinking then that's your cross to bear. I don't buy it for a damn second.

If Russia formerly invades and Ukraine requests our help, the only sensible thing to do to protect EU interests and show a beligerent state that imperialist nonsense won't be accepted on our borders is boots on the ground and a decisive end to this absurd struggle.

As you can probably tell, I much rather a unified EU force be this military than NATO, but since I support both organizations I'll support either going on to end this farce.

&gt; It really just comes down to if we think there's still a chance of Ukraine staying united &amp; Russia not going in full-force.

Ukraine has no more issuies of secession than many other EU nations, their narratives have just been exacerbated and framed for them in a scenario where you are either in a box saying RUSSIAN or RUSSIAN-HATING, a narrative instigated by Russia's actions and worsened by the actions of both participants. I'm not sure why Russia ""going in full force"" would put you *off* international intervention - preventing just that sort of large-scale atrocity is what intervention is *for.*",0,1415382306,null,0,false,0,clvvwfk,t3_2lkn0y,t1_clvvwfk,t1_clvv3q8,null,1426142219,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The verb to stand is quite different in meaning from to stand out, to stand by, to stand back, or to stand in. And the verb to call is very different from to call up, to call out, to call for, or to call off. The major difference between the two languages is that in English an additional word(s) are used to complete the meaning of the verb, while in German these words are prefixes attached to the verb's infinitive form.

These youths were not trained by some third world military, they were trained by men who were the former top brass of the mighty Soviet armed forces. Due to its integral role in the Soviet Union, Ukraine is home to some elite, world class military academies. As such, the professional soldiers and their officers are highly knowledgable about military strategy. If Russia invades, Ukraine's highly trained, professional armed forces will blend with the militia to create a strong, formidable and disciplined insurgency.

put something **forth**

put something **away**

put something **up**

put **up with** something

Both the English verb ""become"" and the German verb ""bekommen"" -- although they now mean different things -- are related to the Old High German ""biqueman"", which means ""to obtain"".

In Old English, it replaced the word ""weorðan"" (related to modern German ""werden"").

In German, however, the sense of ""to become"" evolved: ""to be bestowed"", ""to receive"".

It is true that ""become"" is, essentially, ""come"" with a prefix; but the ""be"" in ""come to be"" is a different verb. The English infinitive ""be"" and the past participle ""been"" originally come from a Proto-Indo-European root, \*bheue, ""to exist"" or ""to grow"". The same root also gives us the German forms ""ich bin"" and ""du bist"", as well as similar words in languages like Russian ""byt'"" (""to be"") and even Persian ""būd"" (""was"").

The idea that Russian actions are legitimate reactions to the interference of “outsiders” in a region seen as “Russian” is nothing but a 2.0 expression of the same imperialist mentality with which Europeans empires split the Middle East. This is all the more surprising as it often comes from people who embrace ostensibly anti-imperialist positions in any other context. In their writings, Eastern Europe is a passive object on which Moscow is the only one actor (in the Latin sense of “doer”) entitled to operate, with no concern for smaller, local figures.

How to explain, otherwise, the way in which Russian ethno-historical arguments about Crimea or Eastern Ukraine are being accepted without any criticism? Commentators have accepted Putin’s ridiculous historical argument that Crimea was a sort of a Russian Jerusalem, or that Ukraine is some kind of lost Holy Land of the Russian nation.[2] The Ukrainian version of the same events has never been seriously considered, or was downplayed as an expression of nationalism of a gang of history-less peasants.

It does not mean that the German economy is strong. The growth forecasts for Germany have been steadily falling to under 1.2 percent this year, down from well over 2 percent in the Spring. 

The main reason that trade has rebounded is because the Euro crashed by over 5% vs the US Dollar during the month of September, and over 10% since May. So you would expect the trade to increase, but you will also see the value of you exports in trade-weighted terms fall. 

Basically, this was to be expected, and does not mean that Germany is on the right track. For an economy the size of Germany to be dependent on exports for over 50% of GDP is very, very risky in the current global economic environment.

Plattenbauten are one thing, but they aren't really built that much anymore. Much of the Grunderzeit terraces which we see in Leipzig today were actually built for the working class. I don't see any reason to believe why the edgy modern rubbish we see in our cities today would be less expensive than modest, vernacular old architecture.

Take a look at the reconstruction in Dresden. The neumarkt is beautiful, but there are a few blemishes. For some reason modernists have to stick their nose in everywhere and build their bland boxes in otherwise baroque areas.

See here for example:

https://www.lopp.de/cms/tl_files/fachbereiche/gebietserschliessung/Dresden/Sanierungsgebiet_Dresden-Neumarkt_016.jpg

(Black roof building on the left)

Structurally the building is almost identical to the adjacent buildings. The main difference is the windows are different, reflective, and any form of ornamentation (i.e attempts to make the building look nice) have been removed.

I don't think the cost is really that different. Rather the deciding factor was that we aren't allowed to rebuild a city in an aesthetically pleasing way, we have to add modernist rubbish because of some modernist architect rhetoric about how we can't be stuck in the past or something (please if you don't build those horrible buildings my job will become obsolete)

Another nice example is the Bundeswehr museum in Dresden:
http://s1.germany.travel/media/gcb_1/mice/kongresse/staedte_1/dresden_5/d48034_museum_1024x768.jpg

This building was perfectly preserved through WW2, and if I might say it looked quite nice:

(During addition of the glass tumour: maybe someone else has a better picture)

Ce que je veux dire c'est que plus on réussit et on contribue à la société, plus on se fait fouetter par le fisc. Par conséquent, cela n'incite pas à réussir car on sait que par la suite on va en baver et notre travail acharné n'est pas récompensé.

Au contraire, il incite les gens qui réussissent à se barrer du pays car ils savent qu'ailleurs ils garderont une plus grosse partie de leurs revenus.

Tout cela va de paire avec la belle mentalité d'une partie de la population française incitant à diaboliser les gens qui ont réussi financièrement (là ce n'est pas une opinion, c'est un fait).

The average customer needs to feel safe and informed at all time when in a shop and even the smallest and seemingly less important factors can cause distress. That's why a big retailer has to keep everything under control to provide a safe environment for the business.

Despite several scenarios where inadequacies in defenses have been made apparent, only Poland and Estonia took it upon themselves to do anything to remedy the situation. Most NATO members continued to cut their budgets despite these inadequacies. The US has spent $1 billion in the first few months of this conflict reinforcing Eastern European nations. I am not sure the figures for the UK and France, but I am sure they are significant as well. You can see how it can be frustrating for the countries who have been telling other NATO members their defenses are inadequate for two decades.

In negotiations with the European Commission in recent days, they say, Britain was able to obtain confirmation that it would do, with a slightly different formula applied on account of the calculations that went into producing the original surcharge. (Officials were unclear on the details of this point.) The final bill would be around £850m ($1.35 billion), roughly half the original demand. (EU officials put it at €1bn, which is actually slightly less.) And unlike in normal years, when the rebate is paid a year after the budgetary contribution to which it applies, on this occasion it would be paid in the same year.

So I am just trying to imagine a normal situation based on this article and not surreal nightmare like you present it. So I go to the store, I am looking at the goods, 3 Polish workers are going to their lunch break. They pass by me, and while they are passing by I can hear them speaking Polish. They don't even look at me, they are just walking by, minding their own business and speak Polish. Would I feel threatened? Would I feel unsafe? Would I go to complain to the manager, cause some Poles are speaking Polish to other Poles? If I would, I would be a paranoid chauvinist.

Another situation. I go to the store, I am checking out goods I am interested in something and go to the store clerk to ask him something. He answers my questions, he speaks my language with an accent, but it's OK, we could communicate perfectly. I go away, and as soon as I turn my back another customer comes to the same clerk and starts speaking Polish to him. Would I feel threatened? Would I feel unsafe? Would I go to complain to the manager, cause some Poles are speaking Polish to other Poles? If I would, I would be a paranoid chauvinist.

So you know when you present it like a normal, every day situation, you see how ridiculous and chauvinistic the whole situation is.

Building a system capable of stopping ICBMs can only be targeted at Russia, China, Israel or India, since they're the only ones with ICBMs not counting the US.

All of the other nuclear powers have IRBMs and lesser, which can be stopped just fine with the ABMs allowed under the treaty.

This isn't every conflict. This is a conflict in our backyard.

&gt; More people die and are injured in Syria per hour than have been killed or hurt in the entire Ukrainian conflict, should we intervene there too? How about in the half of Africa that are constantly having civil wars? Should we invade Hong Kong to release them from China?

In those places we don't have strategic interests to protect. Ukraine is big European country that is very near to us. It has bigger eastern neighbor that is threatening it and its neighboring countries. If we don't stop Russia now, it will be Poland and Baltics next. Not to mention that letting Russia have its way with Ukraine will make sure that Ukraine as a country will become unstable and fall actually to a civil war. Something that hasn't happened yet.

&gt; It's like people don't understand the consequences of starting a land war with fucking Russia - how long do you think Finland is going to last in that scale of conflict? Be real.

Russia is a third world country that puts some of its resources to arms. Soviet Union was third world country with allies that invested most of its GDP to armaments and was an existential threat to West. Soviet Union would have lost both conventional and nuclear war against west. Russia accepts that it can't win a conventional war against west, that is why they have practiced in their military exercises on using nuclear weapons on Russian soil to stop enemy advance.

And in case of Finland, if there would be another great war in Europe, meaning west vs. Russia, we would do just fine.

Ça me suffit pour considérer les US comme une menace bien plus sérieuse que la Russie qui n'a finalement que l'intervention militaire ciné moyen d'action. Militairement, la Russie n'a aucune chance de menacer la France ou un de ses alliés. Ce n'est le cas des US.

Oui. Intervenir à l'étranger c'est de l'ingérence par définition. Quand ça mène à une révolution c'est purement de la déstabilisation.

En Crimée la Russie a empêché un massacre alors...

C'est une augmentation sensible, conforme aux instructions du Département d'Etat »*

If we hadn't joined after USA invoked article 5, NATO would have fallen apart. Sending a few hundred or thousand troops to police a distant country was a very small price to pay for keeping the alliance around.

On the other hand, that same kind of pressure would not work if, for example, USA wanted to invade Russia. Getting involved in unprovoked offense against Russia would not be a sensible decision by any European nation.
Getting in a military conflict with a nuclear armed state and a very big and capable conventional military is far and away from an agenda of European states.

Which makes me stand by my point, NATO by itself is not a threat towards Russia. It has the capability to attack it but no way to actually exercise that capability.",0,1415388739,null,0,false,0,clvzg7o,t3_2lkgqa,t1_clvzg7o,t1_clvy7r0,null,1426139176,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

It's absolutely biased, but this is the stated plan of the current party in government in Moldova. There is strong support from European Union politicians. There is a clear roadmap towards this goal.

It depends far more on the internal politics of Moldova, that is, whether the PLDM wins re-election, than any other condition.

The fact that many countries have taken longer is not at all relevant to Moldova's situation. Those countries have not been anywhere near as dedicated or consistent in their approaches. Furthermore, there is a major strategic value in securing Moldova for the European Union rather than rebuffing it and pushing it to be in Russia's sphere of influence.

For instance, the Association Agreement signed this year: it could've been argued by these same naysayers that there was no chance that Moldova could get that.

No worries, but why strange? The reparations played a large part in the Gründerboom. 

I live in Dresden. The reconstruction is neither cheap nor uncontroversial. To save on costs there is either fake architecture or a total lack of decorative elements, like the new Swissotel opposite the palace; plus the other examples you mentioned. The problem here is more a lack of cohesive urban planning oversight, afaik the building owners have much license as to what they can build. 

With the Bundeswehrmuseum, I have to disagree, I think it's a nice combination of tradition and modernity. It's certainly provocative, but in a positive way.  

I really get your frustration with the lack of aesthetics in many modern cities and modernist architecture, and I feel the same when I look at many of our cities, but I think you are underestimating the cost factor. A Plattenbau that houses a specific amount of people is a) cheaper in building material, because all of it is pre-fabricated and mass-produced and requires no artisan masons, stuccateurs, metalworkers, roofers, carpenters and so on, and b) it requires much less space since it is higher. Cost and speed of building were the major factors, so much living space had been lost, there were refugees that needed housing, rural flight and so on. 

I'll agree that prevailing ideologies in urban planning (Le Corbusier f.e.) were partially to blame. 

Re-reading your post I think you're talking about today, too, in which case I have to agree more, because with many contemporary buildings cost isn't as much as a limiting factor anymore as it was when the cities had to be rebuilt from the war.

Because for most of Europe's history, they managed to build mostly nice buildings, not just countries that were enjoying war reparations. I would hold that the war reparations did not really have a large effect on the architecture for the most part.

&gt;&gt;I live in Dresden. The reconstruction is neither cheap nor uncontroversial. To save on costs there is either fake architecture or a total lack of decorative elements, like the new Swissotel opposite the palace; plus the other examples you mentioned. The problem here is more a lack of cohesive urban planning oversight, afaik the building owners have much license as to what they can build. 

&gt;to save on costs

Do you have some evidence for this? I'd be interested in seeing how the costs of the plainer buildings is compared to the modern ones.

&gt;With the Bundeswehrmuseum, I have to disagree, I think it's a nice combination of tradition and modernity. It's certainly provocative, but in a positive way. 

It's not just provocative, it's intrusive. The nice, aesthetic pleasantness and symmetry of the old building is destroyed. It would be hard to look at that building anymore and proclaim ""What a nice, beautiful building"". Now all one could honestly say is ""What a provocative building"", and I don't think provocativity alone makes a building nice. I mean, something like Sanssouci in Potsdam is provocative because of how beautiful it is, this is only provocative because of how abnormal and unnatural it is.

And yes, I am talking about more contemporary stuff. Of course Plattenbauten filled their purpose in extremely poor communist countries where money was limited, as well as in immediately post war Germany which had a lot of destroyed buildings as well as a large amount of refugees from annexed German land.

Not on the design itself, but on the ability to build expensive, decorative buildings on a large scale:

&gt; The payment, and the speed with which it was paid off [...] produced an extraordinary boom in Germany - the so called *Gründerzeit*. [Watson, Peter: The German Genius, London 2010. p. 374.]

See also Winkler, H.A.: Der lange Weg nach Westen. Deutsche Geschichte 1806-1933. p. 226:

&gt; ...in Germany, where the French war indemnities of five billion Francs had fueled a special business cycle (Sonderkonjunktur, i.e. boom).

My translation.

&gt; Do you have some evidence for this? I'd be interested in seeing how the costs of the plainer buildings is compared to the modern ones.

Well, I'd say that painting decorative elements on the facade is cheaper than having them made and built in, but I have to admit that I lack any objective numbers on that. 

I get what you're saying about the Bundeswehrmuseum, but I'd say it's more than fitting for a museum that's dedicated to chronicling the military history of Germany. If I look at it, I see the nice, historistic Arsenal of the Albertstadt, split by something like shrapnel. I find it highly symbolic, and like I said, fitting. War is ugly.

I dont blame them given the US' past there, but today there is quite a bit of cooperation with the US in South America. The most outspoken is probably Venezuela and even so quite a bit of its oil goes to the US for refining. Many South American countries have opened up to US investment and have benefited substantially. 

&gt;Vietnam is doing fine on its own.

As of now, it is doing fine, but it is definitely concerned about its neighbor. When everyone was caught up with Crimea, China built an oil rig in disputed waters with Vietnam and several other nations. China damaged 7 Vietnamese ships and said Vietnam would not do anything if it ""knew what was good for it"" (or along those lines). Subsequently, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Vietnam is a powerful member, invited the US to a summit on regional security. 

The Philippines increased the legal maximum number of US troops allowed to be stationed there and their president made it clear it was not a show of solidarity, but rather, he expected the maximum to be met. US troops enjoy substantial support from South Korea and Japan (both public and official). I dont even have to go into Taiwan. China's neighbors are very concerned with China's aggression as well.

I am not quite as worried about him. South American countries are favorite locations for US investment. It has fueled much of the growth there.

Historistic styles are inherent to Gründerzeitarchitectur, which includes design elements that are more expensive than buildings where you forego such things. I won't be so sure that the Gründerzeit buildings were mostly for the working class, much of it were representative living spaces for the middle and upper middle class, as well as representative office spaces or salesrooms. How about you come up with some numbers to back your claims?

I rather imagine they are better off than their Russian counterparts who from a quick glance at their military's wiki pages seem to be composed of mostly soviet-era equipment and the only major combat they've seen has been a short invasion of Georgia.

King Boris III refused to contribute troops to the invasion of Yugoslavia. Bulgarian troops were only deployed there after the invasion.

Bulgaria refused to declare war on the Soviet Union. In fact, King Boris III also refused both Bulgarian army support and volunteers to Germany in the Eastern Front.

Boris III, with the help of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, was also able to save the 50,000 Jews in the borders of pre-war Bulgaria.

As a concession to Germany for refusing to declare war on the Soviet Union, Boris III declared war on Britain and the USA. He hoped that this 'token' declaration would satisfy Hitler, and would not bring reprisal against Bulgaria, as Bulgaria was no threat to either Britain or the USA.

However, throughout 1943-1944, the British and American air forces launched continuous bombing runs on Sofia. Over 35,000 bombs were dropped, destroying over 4,500 buildings.

Y = C + I + G + (X − M)

Y= GDP
C= Domestic Consumption
I = Investment 
G = Government expenditure
X = Exports 
M = Imports 

You also sometimes see (X-M) written as Net Exports. 

So, let's make a hypothetical scenario: 

Sealand Economy: 

* Consumption = 40 (Sealand residents buy food and clothes)
* Investment = -10 (business moved away)
* Government = -30 (Austerity) 
* Exports = 30 (gotta sell memorabilia) 
* Imports = 10 (have to import food and clothes)

Put this into the equation and you get the follow: 

40 +(-10)+(-30)+(30-10) = Y = 20

So GDP (Y) = 20 in Sealand, but exports equal 30, which means that exports comprise 150% of GDP.

But the Valencian language is not a big deal. A much lower percentage of people speak it than they do in Barcelona. My main interaction with it was on street signs and the like. You hear people speak it from time to time, but it isn't an issue at all.

But I don't know anyone who went to study in Valencia and regretted it. The weather is pretty great, although it does get chilly in the winter. But it's sunny almost every day of the year. There's a neighborhood where all the students live and there's a huge Erasmus community there too. Valencia is a perfect size. Just under a million people. You can walk across most of the city in under an hour.

So, a ""frozen conflict"" is how it is likely to be for a while. Unless Russia decides that it wants more.  If Russia makes any moves to ""more"" then I imagine that we will see a serious increase in NATO/EU military involvement.

Per esempio, metti che ci sia da trovare una soluzione per un determinato tipo di giunto: Leonardo, conoscendo l'anatomia umana e animale, potrebbe trovare soluzioni a cui l'ingegnere überspecializzato potrebbe arrivarci solo dopo molto tempo.

España, durante los últimos años del franquismo estuvo muy cerca de completar la bomba nuclear lo cual habría dado bastante voz al país en asuntos internacionales. Evidentemente la comunidad internacional se opuso  y presionaron para que este proyecto no llegara a puerto. Proyecto que tras la muerte del dictador y de su principal valedor Carrero Blanco quedo en el olvido.

Durante la democracia, todos nuestros presidentes, de izquierda o derechas han tenido como prioridad la ""amistad"" con USA.
Aznar apoyo la guerra de Irak y Zapatero el ataque a Libia.

Will you still argue like that when the party outlived ""their founding fathers"" and only consists of people that formed their political opinion in our (democratic) Bundesrepublik?

But I'll have to accept that anyway, yet lack the understanding especially people from the former GDR seem to have, for me as a ""Wessi"" it's just another party by now.
I don't see their communist wing having much say, but I never was a member or in any other way involved, so I have no clue if the inner structures are different from what I see.

On the other hand I wonder how you see Merkel then, as she was almost definitely not working against the system while she was a GDR citizen. 
This is honestly quite a big part speculation, but from what I've been told by former (age 50+, the younger ones never say so) GDR citizens, you most certainly would not even get higher education/a ""government job"" (kinda weird as they all were somehow) if they had the slightest hint of you being a ""subversive element"".
