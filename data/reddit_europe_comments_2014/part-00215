true,Politus,UNSA,Enable Kebab,"This isn't the expansion of Western influence so as the tail end of the collapse of Soviet influence.

Lemme put it this way. When the Soviet Union fell in the early 90s, one by one its satellite states broke off -or tried to- in spite of everything Russia tried to do. The only states that really couldn't were Belarus and Ukraine, and to a lesser extent Georgia/Moldova. Belarus and Ukraine were not, as such, independent nations strictly speaking - they were the last remaining vestiges of the Russian Empire, which by then had gone through two major changes of paint. The Ukrainian economy was exploited brutally by an incestuous cohort of Ukrainian-Russian oligarchs working in concert, and a political elite formed that worked together in large part.

What we're seeing now is not some strange revolution out of the blue, or a Western coup in Russia's near abroad. More aptly, EuroMaidan and the events ensuing have more in common with Solidarity in Poland, and in the case of the Russian intervention, the January Events of [Lithuania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_Events) and [Latvia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1991_events_in_Latvia) in 1991, albeit on a larger and more desperate scale. More explicitly, the Russian intervention here is directly analogous to the Soviet intervention in Moldova resulting in the formation of Transnistria. In every case, the goal was to thwart the attempted independence of vassal states, or at least in the case of Moldova prevent their further drift. Likewise, Putin isn't some new type of Russian politician - he's former KGB, a holdover from the Soviet Union, inculcated with KGB methodologies and ideology. He's just Gorbachev in 2014, trying to keep together what little remains of his decaying Empire, declaring the independence movements of his vassal states to be illegitimate usurpers like Gorbachev did for Lithuania and Latvia. The difference here is that Putin's domestic support is sufficient, and his desperation equally so, that his tenacity in trying to hold onto Ukraine is much greater.

tl:dr this isn't the West expanding so much as the Ukraine trying to emulate every other former Soviet state in escaping Russian Imperialism",0,1406431793,null,0,false,0,cj8v5hl,t3_2boqwc,t1_cj8v5hl,t1_cj7wkif,null,1434918627,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Yes. We are in for the long-term solution, not the short-term solution. And if we want to go there, we must start right now. 

&gt; Anyway I don't see why Germany has taken such an anti-nuclear stance when 4 out 5 of the greatest energy disasters have been due to coal plants and dams and coal and gas are known polluters when nuclear is just potentially dangerous. 

I'm not sure where you get the ""4 out of 5 disasters have been due to coal plants and dams"". We've been using nuclear power for about 60 years now. Nuclear plants are bombs in slow motion, by design. If anything goes wrong, they go boom. The engineers ensured us that this is so improbable it's next to impossible to happen. But by now, it's been happened 3 times: Three Mile Island, Cernobyl, and Fukushima. That's one incident every 20 years, so I'll expect the next one to happen in another 20 years. 

And *if* such an incident happens in Germany, a substantial part of Germany will be inhabitable for hundreds of years. This might not matter much in the US where you can build plants far away from populated areas, but in Germany, we can't do that. Look at the population density of Germany compared to the US. So it's just too dangerous. The risk is not worth it.

Coal and gas plants can't explode. We don't have really large dams here, the flooding catastrophies we get usually involve rivers like the Elbe. Solar and wind plants can't kill a large number of people, or contaminate the land they are on.

And paying France to bury our nuclear waste has not worked for some reason, even though they already process it.

Yes, coal and gas are known polluters. We have filters in our power plants, you know, and we're trying to get rid of both coal and gas in the long run. We still need them in the short run, though. No way around that, unfortunately.

What *I* don't get is why so many people in the US are such staunch supporters of nuclear. I mean, it's nice that they suddenly realized climate change is for real after denying it for a long time, and paying no attention to environmental issues at all before that. But to exchange devil for beelzebub doesn't really help. Maybe in 20 years the next nuclear incendent happens in the US, and if it's big enough, they Americans will go all hysterical and throw out nuclear very quickly. In that case, we'll be happy to sell you all the technology you need to switch to regenerative energies. :-)

That's the illusion, and the sole reason why operations like Novaya Gazeta and Ekho are allowed to exist – to maintain the покажуха. In reality, the media landscape is extremely skewed. Were either of the aforementioned sources to gain a sizable audience _internally_, they'd be taken care of quickly. Just look at what happened to Dozhd when it got too popular – the 'alternative' sources are being carefully marginalized, kept out of sight of the general public.

You may recall that Lenta.ru got neutered in March. What was the excuse? They published an actual alternative fucking viewpoint. Moscow Times is in English, so it doesn't matter vis-à-vis the general population. Inosmi survives because it's an extremely marginal project - now even in top 200 visited sites in Russia.

Saying that US/UK geopolitical aims have nothing to do with oil is like saying that British colonialism had nothing to do with the East India Company and pretending that it is by pure coincidence that Iraq and Libya are oil producing countries. All major Western companies are multinationals (that is part of Anglo capitalism), that doesn't mean that the interests of BP are not dear to the British government. Was it not the British PM himself who talked to Obama about settling the damages from the BP gulf oil disaster?

The historians correctly stated that it is the business of historians to interpret history and that politicians are not to decide how history is taught at school.

It was the British and French that bombed Libya. Anybody stationing ground troops in such a place must have a death wish.

Iraqi WMDs were a pretext fabricated by UK and US secrete services to create a pretext for invading the country. Saddam told the truth when he said there were no WMDs (which was confirmed by the UN), and the US, despite searching occupied Iraq for years, never found a shred of evidence.

The quote above translates to:

&gt;The US President has talked repeatedly about how his country is ""soaked"" in cynicism and it's the cynicism of the financial system in particular that must be fought. Before 2008 this would have been a dangerous statement to make, according to Orbán. POTUS has also spoken openly about national patriotism. He speaks openly about (the nation) having to support companies that employ Americans.


Basically, it's about economic policies that support average Americans, such as bringing back jobs that had been outsourced, as opposed to cynically making money using foreign cheap labor while unemployment is high in the US.

These thing Orbán says clearly in every speech, this aren't some hidden messages. At every speech he makes inside of the country he says these things to gain votes, and it's working.

No one in this fucking country understands that **WE ARE HERE BECAUSE OF OUR OWN ACTIONS, AND ONLY WE HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE IT.** It's just easier and it brings you votes to blame on foreigners and on the international conspiracy.

Many say ""don't hate the nation, they are never at fault as a group"". I fully disagree. I can't find any excuse when a nation becomes a threat to others because it sunk in isolation and misinformation, becoming a manipulable mass, in a world where any information is a click away and anyone can learn how to get to it.

I'm reading about the way MH17 information is presented in Russian media and my mind clicks into berserk rage mode at just how retarded those people have become. They are now at a level where conspiracy theories worthy of a bad SF movie have become things that you can see in the news.

The turnout was 60 %. Out of them 44% voted for Fidesz (yes with the current laws this government put in place you can get 2/3ed majority without forming a coalition). That makes about 27% of the people eligible to vote, voting for Orbán. And many, I can say at least 1/3rd of them only voted for him, because in their opinion the left is not better (insanely corrupt). I understand them.

Lot of the young poeple who voted for the extreme right jobbik voted for them because of the criminality we have inside the country. Amost 50% I would say. Not because of the minorities, or because they like nazism.

The majority of the population doesn't represent this governement, nor it's opinion. In Budapest the party barely, or didn't recieve the majority even. It's in Budapest where the educated you people are.

The Hungarian minority in Romania which voted for Fidesz voted for them because they gave them passport, absolutely not because because they agree with their political views. A Hungarian living in Transylvania pointed that out in a previous comment as well. Most of them live in villages or small town, and are old. I don't think much of them use internet for example.

A minority is getting manipulated, they're not bigger or smaller than in most other European countries. Hungarians are democrats. Romanian-Hungarian relations can become very good in a few years.

&gt; **per colpa consistita in negligenza imprudenza, imperizia**;

&gt; **fornendo**, in occasione della detta riunione, informazioni incomplete, 
imprecise e contraddittorie

&gt; **affermando** che sui terremoti “non è possibile fare previsioni”, “è estremamente difficile fare previsioni temporali sull’evoluzione dei fenomeni sismici”, “la semplice osservazione di molti piccoli terremoti non costituisce fenomeno precursore” e al contempo l’esatto contrario ovvero “qualunque previsione non ha fondamento scientifico”

&gt; **ritenendo** che “i forti terremoti in Abruzzo hanno periodi di ritorno molto lunghi. 
&gt; Improbabile il rischio a breve di una forte scossa come quella del 1703, **pur se non si può  escludere in maniera assoluta**”; 

&gt; **ritenendo** che “non c’è nessun motivo per cui si possa dire che una sequenza di scosse 
di bassa magnitudo possa essere considerata precursore di un forte evento”;

&gt; **qualificando** lo sciame sismico che interessa L’Aquila da circa tre mesi come un 
normale fenomeno geologico;

&gt; **affermando** che allo stato attuale, non vi è pericolo, la situazione è favorevole 
perché c’è uno scarico di energia continuo

&gt; **venendo così meno ai doveri di valutazione del rischio** connessi alla loro 
qualità e alla loro funzione e tesi alla previsione e alla prevenzione e ai doveri 
di informazione chiara, corretta, completa;

&gt; **cagionavano, in occasione della violenta scossa di terremoto, la morte 
di (...)**

Che nelle motivazioni della sentenza si legga piu' volte ""Nel capo di imputazione, infatti, il P.M. non contesta agli imputati la mancata previsione del terremoto"" importa una fava, se quelli sono i capi d'accusa.

*Politics*

* The highly criticized WWII memorial, that is interpreted by many as putting all the blame on Germany and none on us, [was finished last Sunday](http://www.politics.hu/20140720/government-makes-midnight-move-to-finish-controversial-wwii-memorial-following-court-decision/). At 1am in secret, because the government didn't want any trouble. Naturally trouble came the next day and they announced there will be no unveiling ceremony of any kind as they are aware of the ongoing debates. So instead they just put it there. [The monument is getting egged since](http://www.thejc.com/node/120834) and also received criticism because the Hebrew part of the memorial text is grammatically incorrect. 

* [Orbán delivered his annual semi-crazy speech](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2bsqdq/hungarys_prime_minister_viktor_orb%C3%A1n_has/) at the 25th Tusnádfürdő Summer University, a noted gathering of ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania where lectures and events are held, mostly along the political-nationalistic-asskissing lines by lecturers from Hungary and the ethnic community. The deputy PM [have called for autonomy as usual](http://www.politics.hu/20140725/ethnic-hungarians-entitled-to-voting-rights-autonomy-says-deputy-pm/). While Orbán's words (prompting for an 'illiberal democracy' centered around the workers and collectivism instead of liberal values and individualism) are troubling, this is mostly for the Transylvanian crowd, predominantly elderly and middle-aged. Their way of thinking is always considered odd, generally uninformed, fan-like and very rural for Hungarians visiting the region, so [Orbán's words are at least part for show](http://hungarianspectrum.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/viktor-orbans-hungary-an-illiberal-democracy/). He's been saying things like this for quite a long time at this event. One perfect example of this was when he thanked the crowd for securing him victory in the elections, as their votes constituted for a single mandate - and a single mandate was the margin of victory of Fidesz... But my personal favorite was when he mentioned the impending impeachment bill by Republicans toward Obama.
&gt; What do you think, how long could I stay in office if parliament could sue me for overstepping our authority?   
   
 Gee, Viktor, that would indeed be truly terrible, to be able to held accountable for your actions. Better joke about it one quick!

* The new ambassadorial nominee to Italy was found to have written about Jews calling them the 'agents of Satan' and other very crazy things in the past. After the domestic and international uproar about his writings, his non-existent diplomatic experience and lack of knowledge of Italian, [he ultimately declined to take the position.](http://www.enca.com/ambassador-who-called-jews-agents-satan-steps-down) 

* [Municipal elections will be held on October 12](http://www.politics.hu/20140723/ader-sets-date-of-2014-local-elections-for-october-12/)

* To the entertainment of the opposition, [Orbán will not include D.C. in his USA visit in October](http://www.politics.hu/20140724/orban-to-visit-us-in-october/) as he would not have been received in the White House, and only on a deputy assistant state secretary level at the State Department. The other planned event of his in Washington would've been a lecture at Georgetown which he declined after the organizers did not sway from their planned program - which included a Q&amp;A at the end. Nah, unfiltered questions, can't have that. 

---
*Economy*

* [The government have purchased MKB bank](http://www.politics.hu/20140724/bayernlb-to-sell-hungarian-unit-to-state/) from its German owners that used to be in government hands before. If I recall correctly it is the loss leader in the market by far. It was also announced that by autumn [the government will set up a 'bad bank'](http://www.portfolio.hu/en/economy/hungary_to_rid_banks_of_toxic_loans_bad_bank_to_be_ready_by_sept-oct_cbanker.28128.html) to buy up toxic assets from the other players, so they might just to what with this one (purely my own speculation).[ Here's a chart of the government acquisitions since 2011](http://www.portfolio.hu/en/equity/chart_of_the_day_this_is_how_the_hungarian_state_is_extending_its_grasp.28131.html), quite a lengthy one. It includes both banks and 'strategical' companies in the transport, utility and media market. 

* [The National Bank have announced its 24th and final easing of the main policy rate](http://online.wsj.com/articles/hungary-ends-two-year-easing-cycle-1406037712), down to 2.1% from 2.3. The rate was 7% in 2012. They plan to keep the current rate until the end of 2015 and then move it either up or down as needed. 

* Following the end of June mayhem/celebration by FX-loanees where it was finalized that the government will bail them out by putting the debts on the banks in part, the [Minister of Economy confirmed that this will only be done in 2015](http://www.portfolio.hu/en/economy/hungary_fx_loan_conversion_to_come_only_next_year_varga.28105.html) with small 'advances' being handed out earlier. The June decision of the Supreme Court was that the banks are responsible for non-sufficiently informing their clients of the danger of the FX-loans and also that they unlawfully used the market spread for their own profits. The regulating government order entered into force yesterday. 

* Despite restarting the talks, Hungarian state oil company [MOL did not succeed in negotiations](http://bbj.hu/business/no-progress-at-mol-croatia-talks-over-ina_82866) with the Croatian government to purchase Croatian state oil company INA.

*Misc.*

* The Great Leader will take the place he truly deserves (and covets for a long time), in the Castle of Buda as the [Prime Minister's Office moves there by 2016](http://www.politics.hu/20140721/pmo-moving-to-buda-castle-by-2016/). 

* Hungary announced the closing of its embassies in Estonia and Cyprus quoting reduced need for political presence. In return [Estonia have also announced the closing of its Budapest embassy](http://www.politics.hu/20140725/estonia-closing-budapest-embassy/). New embassies will be opened in Quito, Ecuador and Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, while new consulates are to open in Germany. 

* The very Hungarian national sport of ours, waterpolo is in the spotlight recently as the Waterpolo European Championship is drawing to a close in Budapest. The women's team have finished 3rd yesterday while the men's are going for the gold today against archrival Serbia. 

* More as a matter of laughter, Hungary is also hosting the UEFA U-19 European Championship. The Hungarian team played absolutely terribly in the first two games, losing them 1-3 and 1-6 against Austria and Portugal, but have managed to secure a win against Israel in their last game, which in turn secured them qualification to next year's U-20 World Championship in New Zealand, which was the minimum expectation. Nevertheless the players looked terrible and this event was considered the first major test of the Hungarian football academies - they clearly failed. 

* The only player from the Hungarian football league to play at the World Cup, Bosnian Muhammad [Besic of Ferencváros is set to sign with Everton](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/24/muhamed-besic-everton-transfer-bosnia) for 4M GBP to play in the Premiere League. 

* The Formula-1 Hungarian GP is also held this weekend and people who care about it are flocking to the grounds. The remaining 99% of people have their annual petty-but-still-fun entertainment from the event: to look at prices of food at the location online and act shocked as they are generally 4-6 times of the standard price. A single kebab is nearly 10€ (usually 2), and you can have a whole grilled chicken for just 20 (usual price 4€).",0,1406451605,null,0,false,0,cj90whl,t3_2bu60o,t1_cj90whl,t3_2bu60o,null,1434921470,37,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,37

Section 28. [**Italy (Type L)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets#Italy_.28Type_L.29) of article  [**AC power plugs and sockets**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC%20power%20plugs%20and%20sockets): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;Italian earthed plugs and sockets are defined by the standard CEI 23-50 which superseded CEI 23-16, this includes two models rated at 10 A and 16 A that differ in contact diameter and spacing (see below for details). Both are symmetrical, allowing the line and neutral contacts to be inserted in either direction. This plug is also commonly used in Chile and Uruguay.

&gt;The 10 A plug has pins which are 4 mm in diameter, the centres spaced 19 mm apart. The 10 A socket can accept Europlugs. The 16 A plug has pins which are 5 mm in diameter, the centres spaced 26 mm apart. The 16 A socket used to be referred to as *per la forza motrice*  (for electromotive force, see above) or sometimes (inappropriately) *industriale* (industrial). Large appliances are usually sold with Schuko plugs, so 16 A non-rewirable plugs are usually used only in adapters and power cords. Those appliances are always earthed, so unearthed 16 A plugs are now very uncommon, and only a few brands still sell them in rewirable version. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;The dual standards were initially adopted because in Italy, up to the second half of the 20th century, electricity used for lamps and that used for all other purposes was at two different voltages (220 V single or split phase and 127 V single phase), sold at different tariffs, charged with different taxes, accounted with separated electricity meters, and sent on different wire lines that ended with different sockets.  Even though the two electric lines (and respective tariffs) were gradually unified beginning in the 1960s (the official, but purely theoretical date was the summer of 1974 ) many houses kept twin wires and twin electricity meters for years thereafter (in some zones of Lazio the 127 V network was provided for lighting until 1999). The two gauges for plugs and sockets thus became a [de facto standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto_standard) which is now standardized under CEI 23-50. Older installations often have sockets that are limited to either the 10 A or the 16 A style plug, requiring the use of an adapter if the other gauge needs to be connected. Numerous cross adapters were used.

&gt;Das schließt kurze Zitate ebenso mit ein wie bloße Hyper-Links. Blogs können davon ebenso betroffen sein wie praktisch alle Webseiten, die in irgendeiner Form auf Nachrichteninhalte verweisen. Dabei sind nicht nur Nachrichten, sondern auch Inhalte zu Unterhaltungszwecken oder Meinungstexte eingeschlossen. Die Abgabe kann damit von jedem, der auf eine spanische Seite verlinkt, verlangt werden.

Nein, es ist de facto dekriminalisiert. Legalisiert wäre es nur dann, wenn ich meinen Anspruch auf meine Drogen aus einem Kaufvertrag durchsetzen könnte. Kann ich aber nicht, § 134 BGB. Und diese de fact Dekriminalisierung wirkt sich aber nur zu Gunsten des Beschuldigten aus, die Polizei muss trotzdem erstmal ermitteln - im Ergebnis für den Papierkorb, weshalb eine Dekriminalisierung sogar von den Polizeigewerkschaften gefordert wird.

&gt; Das Problem in diesem Sektor ist die nachgelagerte, extralegale Verfolgung durch die Führerscheinbehörden. 

Nein, daran ist nichts extralegal und es ist entgegen allgemeinem Sentiments auch keine Bestrafung. Die Führerscheinbehörden sind nämlich an Recht und Gesetz gebunden, weshalb sie hier gefahrenabwehrend tätig werden müssen. Und wie dir diverse Urteile zu dem Thema beweisen werden, gibt es Studien zu dem Thema, auf die sich die Behörden beim Vollzug der Gesetze berufen. Daher sollte man sich lieber an diesen Studien abarbeiten anstatt das rechtmäßige und nicht zuletzt auch oft gebundene Verhalten der Behörden zu kritisieren.

&gt; Da könnte man mit einem reinen Verwaltungsakt problemlos Gras komplett legalisieren.

Nein, denn selbst wenn man die FeV ändern würde, steht § 134 BGB noch im Raum, der aufgrund anderer Vorschriften als jener der FeV greift, nämlich BtMG und AMG. So einfach ist es dann doch nicht. Zumal, wie gesagt, auch noch die Studien im Raum stehen, auf die sich die Fahrerlaubnisbehörden berufen.

Right after the Orbán took power in 2010 these things happened in ""index"": In 2010 Bodóky Tamás investigative journalist left, and shortly after the leading publicist Bede Márton. In 2011 september the editor in chief left, because of the growing political influence (pursued by the owners). I found this on the Hungarian wikipedia page of the site, which used [this](http://index.hu/belfold/2011/09/05/uj_peter_tavozik_az_indextol/) and [this](http://www.kreativ.hu/media/cikk/mi_folyik_az_indexnel) as sources. In no way is Index a Fidesz mouthpiece, it is very critical of both the government and the opposition. I look at it the way Facebook manipulated the news feed negatively without people noticing. 

Just a month ago many people at Origo, including the editor in chief left, after they tried to uncover a corruption scandal by a powerful member of the Fidesz party. You can read about it [here](http://www.freehungary.hu/index.php/56-hirek/2939-politically-motivated-sacking-of-origo-editor-in-chief-triggers-protest-in-downtown-budapest), found an article in English. Origo and Index are almost exactly the same.

The journalists who left Index have already set up a quite independent website which is gaining strength, and the origo staff who left are doing the same thing. 

I think internet society is quite powerful in the country, most demonstrations are organized on Facebook as well.

It may be an interesting subject of a historical debate, but to bring this up in a popular forum in which current affairs are typically discusses will undoubtedly lead to accusation of revisionism from the Polish side. This forum simply does not allow a thorough historical debate and there is nothing worse than using a one-sided and popular historical interpretation for distorting current political debate.

From a political point of view, the current borders have to be recognized no matter who lived in what area at some remote period in the past.

Cette baisse du nombre de mort est dû bien plus à l'amélioration des équipements, ou à une meilleure formation, qu'à une réduction de la vitesse. La vitesse n'est quasiment jamais responsable d'accidents (hormis ceux roulant à +50km/h au dessus de la vitesse autorisée, qui eux, de toute façon, en ont que faire des radars).

That story you linked:

During the ongoing invasion (17 July 2014) of Gaza during Israel's Operation Protective Edge, numerous human rights groups have documented the IDF's use of flechette munitions, and declared this use to be against international humanitarian law, due to the imprecise nature of flechettes. According to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, IDF tanks fired six anti-personnel munitions at the village of Khuzaa on July 17, resulting in the injury of one Palestinian woman.

From what I see, they(pathetic human right groups) declared that they are illegal, however they are not. Americans use them, Russian use them , Israel use them, any military with a sense in their head should use them. Moreover don't give me crap about 1 casualty, which may have been dead in any way.

German Confederation and Empire

Following the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna convened in 1814 and founded the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund), a loose league of 39 sovereign states. Disagreement with restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Metternich. The Zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity in the German states.[36] National and liberal ideals of the French Revolution gained increasing support among many, especially young, Germans. The Hambach Festival in May 1832 was a main event in support of German unity, freedom and democracy. In the light of a series of revolutionary movements in Europe, which established a republic in France, intellectuals and commoners started the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement.[37]

Conflict between King William I of Prussia and the increasingly liberal parliament erupted over military reforms in 1862, and the king appointed Otto von Bismarck the new Minister President of Prussia. Bismarck successfully waged war on Denmark in 1864. Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 enabled him to create the North German Confederation (Norddeutscher Bund) and to exclude Austria, formerly the leading German state, from the federation's affairs. After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the German Empire was proclaimed in 1871 in Versailles, uniting all scattered parts of Germany except Austria (Kleindeutschland, or ""Lesser Germany"").



The German Empire (1871–1918), with the dominant Kingdom of Prussia in blue
With almost two-thirds of its territory and population, Prussia was the dominating constituent of the new state; the Hohenzollern King of Prussia ruled as its concurrent Emperor, and Berlin became its capital.[37] In the Gründerzeit period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as Chancellor of Germany under Emperor William I secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances, isolating France by diplomatic means, and avoiding war. As a result of the Berlin Conference in 1884 Germany claimed several colonies including German East Africa, German South-West Africa, Togo, and Cameroon.[38] Under Wilhelm II, however, Germany, like other European powers, took an imperialistic course leading to friction with neighbouring countries. Most alliances in which Germany had previously been involved were not renewed, and new alliances excluded the country.[39]

The assassination of Austria's crown prince on 28 June 1914 triggered World War I. Germany, as part of the Central Powers, suffered defeat against the Allies in one of the bloodiest conflicts of all time. In total, approximately two million German soldiers were killed in World War I.[40] The German Revolution broke out in November 1918, and Emperor Wilhelm II and all German ruling princes abdicated. An armistice ended the war on 11 November, and Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919. Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating and unjust and it was later seen by historians as influential in the rise of Hitler.[41][42][43][44]",0,1406462991,null,0,false,0,cj92tjo,t3_2bupm6,t1_cj92tjo,t3_2bupm6,null,1434922487,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2
true,New-Atlantis,EURO,European Union,"If it wasn't a military alliance, than I don't know what it was. The Russian/French alliance was clearly aimed against Germany and Austria-Hungary. That is also why Russia supported Serbia and France bankrolled the Serbian military with the Black Hand actively planning terrorist acts against the Hapsburgs. The Franco-Russian agreement went so far as to specify exactly how many troops of what type each side had to make available in the event of a conflict with Germany.

The British joined later and left a creative vagueness in their relations with the French. While the politicians claimed in public that GB was under no obligation to assist France in case of war, there were confidential agreements between the foreign office and the MOD with their French counterparts that assured the French of assistance. It is exactly this duplicity which created the atmosphere of uncertainty that facilitated the war, since the Germans weren't sure that the British would enter the war. If it had been made clear at the start, the war might not have happened.

&gt;I moved back 2 years after Orbán took the power. At 20 years old living abroad, apart from visiting a few times I could only read the news, and I supported him, I believed in him.
&gt;But coming back, and living here showed me the true nature of this regime. Democracy is at stake here.

I must admit, I chuckled a bit reading that. Rich kid travelling the world, returning to his poor home country to tell us things are bad. I'll try to not make further snide comments, we'll see how that goes.

&gt;""that's what Putin would say"". That's what Putin says about internal opposition as well (foreign funded people), read any of his speeches. Don't understand why you have to pick on that. I doubt there is a single EU leader who has said anything like this so far.

I pick on that because it's meaningless. It's cosmetics compared to the meddling with the constitution and governmental powers. Weak arguments like this only draw attention from real issues and provide easy-to-deflect, softball attacks that make the Orbán government's job easier.
The opposition parties are doing the same, focusing on trivialities, like statues that can be misinterpreted and derailing serious discussion about funding and background studies of Paks II with wild green anti-nuclear activism. Things like the pushing of state religion and the constitution are already out of the public discourse.

&gt;I didn't call him dictator, I called Orbán a ""nationalistic politican with dictatorial tendencies"". He is not a dictator, but in my opinion if it were only up to him he'd much rather have the powers Putin has than Merkel. Prove me otherwise of the things he has done, or said so far, in any of his speeches inside Hungary.

""The Moon's made out of cheese. Prove me otherwise!"" That's not how arguments work. ""in my opinion, if it was up to him..."" yeah, that's gonna make a strong case.
It's true that you didn't (directly) call him a dictator, and I apologize for attributing that line to you.

I agree with the rest. I was gonna make some more snide comments about internet activism and raising awareness, but frankly I agree. But please refrain from accusing the government with blatant falsehoods, that only plays in their narrative of ""Us against the world"".

I'm sorry for being mean, we're probably on the same side. But frankly, at this point I'm more angry with the opposition's utter incompetence than Orbán's power grab.

true,Aluhut,TEXT,der einzig Echte,"&gt; Das Gehirn hat eine bestimmte Größe, der Geist nicht, das Gehirn ist elektrisch geladen, der Geist wiederum nicht usw.
&gt; Es ist also nicht nur so, dass es einzelne Eigenschaften des Geistes gibt, die mit denen des Gehirns nicht übereinstimmen, es scheint im Gegenteil so, dass wir überhaupt keine gemeinsamen Eigenschaften finden, dass hier also gewissermaßen das Gegenteil von Identität stattfindet. 

Wenn ein Text so anfängt, weiß man gleich wessen Kind es ist und auch schon was das Ergebnis sein soll. Dem folgt dann die Begründung.

Was ist den ""Geist""? Woher weiß der Autor den was er ist oder was er nicht ist? Woher will er wissen, dass eine Maschine nicht einen ""Geist"" entwickelt wenn man durch sie ein Gehirn nachbaut?

Wir können ja mal an dieser Stelle kurz über die Motivation eines Institutes dessen Name schon paradox ist: ""Insitut für Glaube und Wissenschaft"" sprechen. Sollten es Menschen schaffen einen Cyborg zu bauen, der fähig wäre den Menschen nachzuahmen, wären die Religionen am Ende. All die schönen Geschichten über die Besonderheit des Menschen. Den ""Auserwählten"" in der Natur wären erst einmal dahin. Man müsste sich neue Geschichten ausdenken um das Problem zu umschiffen. Sie wäre jedoch ihrer Wurzeln beraubt. Es gäbe keinen Grund mehr für eine Religionswissenschaft außerhalb der Literatur und Geschichte. Harte Zeiten für das Institut.

Das ganze geht aber noch weiter: wäre ein noch ziemlich dummer Cyborg nicht schon der bessere Gläubige? Wenn ich diesem dummen Cyborg sage, er solle nach den 10 Geboten leben, wird er es tun. IMMER. Das kann kein Gottesgeschöpf nachmachen. Es gäbe keinen Grund ihm irgendwelche Sünden zu vergeben und er wäre ohne Erbsünde geboren. Es wäre eine bessere Schöpfung als das was Gott geschaffen hat!

An dieser Stelle könnte man noch über die Gründe sprechen warum man dem dummen Cyborg nicht die Ganze Bibel als Gesetz einprägen sollte z.B. usw. aber kommen wir zurück zu den Rechtfertigungen:

Der Autor fährt fort indem er die Vielfalt der metaphysischen Theorien einfach mal ignoriert und sich statt dessen zwei aussucht die am besten geeignet sind durch ein selbst gesetztes Axiom entkräftet zu werden um das schon am Anfang beschriebene Ergebnis zu erzielen. 

Dann die Computer:

(Anmerkung: meiner Meinung nach hat die ""Unser Gehirn ist wie eine Maschine""-Theorie diverse Probleme und Widersprüche. Er geht aber nicht auf die relevanten ein weil die oft eine andere Prämisse mitbringen, die dann aber auch voraussetzt, dass man etwas anderes akzeptiert was der Autor nicht akzeptieren will.)

&gt; So bestechend, wie eine solche Position auch wirkt, auch sie hat einen Pferdefuß. John Searle hat darauf aufmerksam gemacht, dass der Computer gar nicht zu wissen braucht, was er tut, um seine Leistungen zu vollbringen. Er ist eine rein syntaktische Maschine. Die Semantik, d.h. die Bedeutung seines Programms, bleibt ihm unbekannt. 

An dieser Stelle müsste ich mal googlen aber da ich nicht weiß ob der Kommentar eine brauchbare Diskussion schafft, spare ich es mir erst mal. Der Punkt den ich hier nachsuchen müsste waren Untersuchungen die gezeigt haben, dass der Mensch (das Gehirn) Entscheidungen fällt bevor die Person/der Geist bewusst die Entscheidungen getroffen hat. Was in diesem Fall nicht nur die Computer-Theorie speisen würde, es unterstützt z.B. Theorien wie die des Selfish Gene.

Er geht im Weiteren Verlauf darauf ein. Also so semi:

&gt; Doch was ‚Egoismus' ist, wissen wir nur vom Menschen her. Diese Eigenschaft projizieren wir dann in die Gene hinein (die sie nicht haben und nicht haben können) und ,erklären' daran den Altruismus des Menschen aus dieser fiktiven Eigenschaft. 

Das ist richtig. Der Mensch hat dem einen Namen gegeben ""Egoismus"". Daß der Mensch den Egoismus kreiert hat den wir auch im Tier- und Pflanzenreich beobachten können würde ja bedeuten, daß es den nicht gab bevor der Mensch den Gedanken hätte. Alles klar? 

Ich bin mir an dieser Stelle irgendwie sicher, daß der Autor auch ein Problem mit der Evolution insgesamt hat.

Weiter im Text:

&gt; Nur wir, die wir das Gerät gebaut haben und bedienen, deuten
seine Leistungen in Sinnzusammenhängen. Für den Computer existieren diese Zusammenhänge nicht. Er rechnet nur. 

Och wir sind ja so doof ;) Dieser Einwurf ist so...komisch. Warum ist er da? Oben schreibt er noch von neurokybernetischen Maschinen, später sind es alles IO Dummbatzen. Schon mal von lernenden Maschinen gehört? Da tut sich was. Wir sind noch recht weit am Anfang. Wir sind auch nicht dumm. Als das erste mal jemand das Gehirn mit einem Computer verglichen hat, meinte er sicher nicht die Röhrenschränke im Rechenzentrum des Mathematikgebäudes.

Weiter gehts:

&gt; So plausibel, wie auch dieses wiederum klingt, es verbirgt sieh dahinter ein gravierendes Problem: Menschlicher Geist ist als Input-Output-Maschine nicht hinreichend interpretierbar.

Ach so. Das ist ein Kriterium? Merkwürdig. Oben hat er noch geschrieben wie doof wir sind. So doof, dass wir schon die simple ""KI"" eines NPCs in einem Spiel nicht verstehen. Weiss der Autor warum der NPC so reagiert wie er es tut? Er kennt den Code nicht. Qualifiziert sich der NPC dadurch dann nicht schon als human? Nur weil der Autor nicht ""interpretieren"" kann warum er tut was er tut? 
Was ist mit Schrödigers Katze? Was ist mit Zufallsgeneratoren? Gottes Werk? Ich kann einen Zufallsgenerator schreiben der unvorhersehbarer ist als der Autor. Ich habe sein Programm schon nach den ersten Absätzen erkannt. Er hat bisher nicht enttäuscht. Ist der Autor eine Maschine? Ein seelenloser Textgenerator der religiösen Algorithmen folgt. 

&gt; Vor Jahrzehnten hat man im psychologischen Behaviourismus versucht, den Menschen als Reiz-Reaktions-Maschinerie zu
begreifen. 

Wieder die gleiche Strategie. Der Autor greift sich eine Theorie raus, ignoriert den Rest um dann sogar soweit zu gehen das zu äußern:

&gt; Dieser Versuch gilt allgemein als gescheitert.

Können wir ja die Geisteswissenschaften gleich insgesamt einstampfen. Philosophie des Geistes? Zeitverschwendung. Geht net. Der Fehlschlag des ""Behaviourismus"" hat das bewiesen!

An dieser Stelle ein kleiner Einwurf:

es gibt eine Theorie die besagt, dass man ein System nie vollkommen aus diesem System heraus beschreiben kann (ich schreibe ein Buch darüber wie ich das Buch schreibe). Was wäre wenn der clevere Cyborg **uns** erklären könnte? HORROR! ;)

&gt; Ein Computer, wie er auf dem Tisch steht, ist eine tote Maschine. Er funktioniert nur mit Nutzer. Wer ist dann aber der Nutzer des Menschen? 

Gott? Die Matrix? Höhere Menschen die mit uns experimentieren? Niemand mehr? So viele Möglichkeiten. So ein enges Weltbild. So vorhersehbar.

Ich sage vorher, es wird noch absurder.


&gt; Nehmen wir an, wir hätten einen Roboter gebaut, der in seinen Reaktionen vom Menschen ununterscheidbar wäre, wir würden uns z.B. mit ihm unterhalten und könnten keinerlei Differenz zum Menschen feststellen. Hülfe uns dies weiter? 

Wenn wir annehmen einen Roboter zu konstruieren der ununterscheidbar wäre, wäre es dann so abwegig, dass wir einen konstruieren der BESSER oder ANDERS ist? Welche Roboter würde der Roboter konstruieren? Der Autor hört einfach auf zu denken. Einfach so.

&gt; Eine Simulation ist keine Erklärung! 

Wie wahr. Was ist den mit den Simulacra die die heutigen religiösen Vorstellungen darstellen? Was ist mit diesen ganzen Grenzen in denen der Autor hier arbeitet? Wie viel wert sind die den heute noch? Abbilder von Abbildern. Legenden die eigentlich irgendwo im simplen Kreislauf der Sonne und des Mondes münden. Im simplen Kreislauf der Geburt und des Todes. Aufgeblasen. Fern von dem eigentlichen Sinn und Zweck. In sich unschlüssig und widersprüchlich. Ich schweife ab...

Ich bin aber auch nicht der einzige. Nachdem der Autor nun diesen Haufen, auf begrenzter Wahrnehmung basierender Axiome gesetzt hat kommen nun die ""Schlussfolgerungen"".

&gt; Ob ein solcher Roboter technisch möglich ist, ist ungewiß. Sicher ist, dass wir keine Ahnung haben, wie wir ihn bauen sollten und sicher ist, dass wenn wir diese Ahnung hätten, wir ihn garantiert nicht herstellen
würden. Ein ,freier' Roboter müsste z.B. streiken können. Welches Industrieunternehmen würde nun die kostspielige Entwicklung eines Roboters finanzieren, der im Grenzfall nichts tut? 

Ach so. Weil Menschen streiken können funktioniert ja auch nichts auf der Welt. Hat noch nie. Weil Menschen streiken können. Meine Güte Mann...

Es folgt ein weiterer Abschnitt zur Freiheit wo der Autor zum dritten Mal die gleiche Strategie fährt. Eine Theorie. Die geht nicht also gehen alle nicht. Ich erspare mir die Ausführungen dazu weil ich hier gleich an die 10k-Grenze stoße und wir fahren fort zu der Stelle an der er Aufzeigt wie die Story ""Wissenschaft"" (ein schönes Bild. Kann ich mit leben) sich entwickelt und macht sich darüber lustig. Wie ich oben schon geschrieben habe, sind religiöse Vorstellungen genau so eine Story. Die Art und Weise in der sich jedoch Religionen verbreiten entsprechen eher dem Stummen Telefon Spiel. Von diesem **Geist** her über die Wissenschaft zu richten ist lächerlich. Bestenfalls.

Wie oben schon vorhergesagt, wird es noch Absurder denn am Ende folgt natürlich die leicht zu merkende Verschwörungstheorie:

&gt;  Damit lässt sich Geld machen und die Philosophen, die diesem Trend ihren Segen geben, machen sich bei den Mächtigen beliebt. 

Wir kommen zum Ende des Tunnels:

&gt; Der Philosoph und a fortiori der Theologe sollten solchen Tendenzen widerstehen, denn hier geht es um alles.

Ja. Es geht vor allem um alles für das Institut für Glaube und Wissenschaft. Sowie für ""Wissenschaftler"" wie den Autor. Denn der clevere Cyborg würde ihn zuerst wegrationalisieren.

But let's ignore that for a moment just to see how deep the absurdity of your argument goes. 

First of all, Ukrainian separatists are the ones who probably shot the plane down, not Russian militia. If you're going to call all of them Russians exclusively, maybe you also consider all the Syrian rebels killing Christians as Americans, since they were armed by the US. Btw, no sanctions there for the USA. Hurrah for hypocrisy.

Second of all, if you want Europe or the EU to be any different from those you consider your enemies, you should wait for proper evidence instead of accusing people without proof. Interestingly enough that evidence has been handed over by the separatists' themselves in the form of the airplane's black-box. Separatists are more interested in the truth than you, and all the gullible people like you, are.

Third of all, look at the real values of the West in this issue: the only form of justice the West wants is a big fat check from Putin. It's all about money once again. Putin give Obama's Change^TM, and everything will be back to the usual business.

The seperatists dad hand over the black box, but they're still blaming Ukraineans for firing at the plane. They know the international community would not let them keep the black box and get away lastly.

Lastly, the monetary compensation to the families of the victims is standard practice. When the US shot down the Iranian plane, they had to play the victims' families, when Ghadaffi shot down that plane over Lockerbie, years later he had to pay the families of those killed. Same will go for whomever is responsible and I guess we wait for the courts to make that decision. Nothing unusual there either.

Flat income tax was introduced by a right-wing government (2002-06) that preceded Fico's first term (2006-10). Unfortunately, his second term government [cancelled it back in 2012](http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/48438/3/the_end_of_slovakias_flat_tax.html).

The process of Slovakia's entry to Eurozone was [also initiated by the 2002-06 government](http://www.slovak-republic.org/eu/) - Fico's government only confirmed it because almost everyone wanted it (except of his political party which tried really hard to stop us from joining EU back in 2003).

I can't wait until he's finally gone from politics.

You're just making the generalizations I said you were making. They're not all Russians or ""interchangeable"", whatever that's supposed to mean regarding nationality of people. 

Yes, Russians aid Ukrainian separatists with weapons and personnel. But they're two distinct groups. Ukrainian separatists carried out the shooting of the civilian plane with weapons they acquired to shoot military planes. Russians didn't aid them in the condition they would shoot commercial airplanes. Russia didn't say ""we only aid you if you shoot a commercial airplane down"".

Countries deal weapons left and right all the time. Hell, even France and Germany sell weapons to Russia. This does not mean France and Germany are responsible for Russia's aid to Ukrainian separatists. 

&gt; ISIS weren't armed by the US, the FSA were, an entirely different entity.

ISIS is armed by Saudi Arabia, which is armed by the USA. This has been the procedure for decades now when the US wants to arm groups without being directly connected to them.

Anyway, FSA killed innocent Syrians too. Are you saying Syrian innocent people don't deserve the respect innocent Europeans deserve? Or are you saying the weapon dealer isn't responsible for the weapon user's actions and thus agreeing with me?

&gt; The seperatists dad hand over the black box, but they're still blaming Ukraineans for firing at the plane. They know the international community would not let them keep the black box and get away lastly.

I see you don't think they have the right to defend themselves of your accusations with evidence they consider that corroborates their claims.

&gt; Who's more believable anyway? Us saying rebels shot down the plane by accident, or the Russian saying the Ukraineans shot it down willingly, the Ukraineans tried to shoot down a plane Putin's on, someone loaded the civilian plane with dead bodies and some other stories. We're not calling anyone the devil here: the Russians are involved in a nasty fight with the Ukrainean authorities and made an error and will pay for that error. 

See, there you are again. This time you even start by saying Ukrainian separatists did it, but in the last sentence you're blaming Russia for the Ukrainian separatists' error.

So you're either really convinced Russia told the separatists to shoot down a commercial airplane, or you realize Russia didn't do that but you think countries that do business in their interest are at fault whenever those interests go against yours. 

I don't know which one is worse.

&gt; Vast different language than the fascist gay jews we're seen for.

Subtle propaganda isn't any better than crude propaganda. It is only subtle because the people it's aimed at are more educated or have a more sensible approach to the subject.

true,StoneCall,SACH,Leipzig,"&gt; Does Germany have provinces, states, districts? How have those evolved over time?

As you probably already know, Germany wasn't a state until 1871. Before that time, there existed several German states which often changed (wars, inheritance, ...)

From 1871 to 1918/1919, Germany consisted of [monarchies](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Kaiserreich#Gebietsgliederung) (with the exception of three cities and one state directly under the emperor) under an emperor. The states offered different degrees of democracy. The borders were historical and often quite confusing, with enclaves and exclaves galore. Provinces were parts of Prussia, by far the largest state.

In the Weimar republic, until 1933, the states were mostly carried over from the monarchy, although some changes were made (for instance, the state of Thuringia was formed from several small states). They were now democracies under the federal government.

During Nazi rule, the states still existed in theory, but became irrelevant. The Nazi party was organized in Gaus which sometimes followed historical borders and sometimes didn't.

After 1945, the occupation powers reorganized the states in pretty much what we have now. Enclaves and exclaves were mostly removed and Prussia was dissolved into several smaller states. In West Germany, the states persisted; in East Germany, they were dissolved in 1952 to make room for districts. With reunification, the districts were regrouped in states.

So, the answer to your question is: Germany had provinces, states and districts, but at different points in history.",0,1406466752,null,0,false,0,cj93mvb,t3_2bupm6,t1_cj93mvb,t3_2bupm6,null,1434923018,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

Present tense also works most of the time, albeit it might have a slightly different meaning or vibe than the future tense.

In spoken German, it does not matter which past tense you use, as long as you don't jump around too much. In Southern Germany, Austria and Switzerland the Präteritum is basically not used very much in the spoken language, so stick with Perfekt and as long as you don't mess up the irregular verbs  too much, you should be fine.
In written German, when telling a story, stick with Präterium (as you would when using English with the past simple).

And when we talk about Plusquamperfekt (past perfect) and that stuff, there's enough native speakers who are not capable of correctly using that themselves, so you should be fine, really.

It is even worse with the Konjunktiv. Many people just don't use the Konjunktiv I at all when in informal situations. Konjunktiv II you can also avoid by replacing it with a ""würde + Infinitv"" structure.

I went to a different school but i had friends who went there when i was in school who i met through mutual friends, these guys were all Brits though.

Ce serait quand même assez triste de faire un programme parfaitement bien écrit sous Word et de ne pas comprendre pourquoi le compilateur vomit quand on le lui soumet.

Un argument en faveur de cette position radicale est que l'informatique est un domaine extraordinairement vaste. Le point de vue utilitariste se heurte quand même au fait que les futurs mathématiciens, biologistes, physiciens, économistes, etc. ont des besoins parfois très différents, et devront utiliser des outils et des paradigmes également différents.

Corruption was huge before as well you're right.** 

I can give a specific example here that would be impossible to happen in any country in the Euopean Union, and unprecedented in Hungary.

Orbán is a big football fans. Stadiums are being built and renovated by tax payers money. He built a football academy in his own village, which now has a team in the first division. The stadium he built by the ""many supporters who gave money"" looks like this: [1688](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felcs%C3%BAt) (in 2004) people live in the village (including Orbán and his family. The stadium has [4500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_Arena) spectator places.

The investors built a brand new training ground as well, that was completely funded by tax payers money. Felcsút is now the center of Hungarian football.

In my opinion this is state sponsored corruption, at least the Gyurcsány clan tried to hide it. The money flowing to them were maybe equal to what goes today to Orbán and his friends, but at least they were scandals when Gyurcsány was in power.

Es geht doch im Grunde um folgenden Konflikt: Die Wertebasis unserer Gesellschaft hängt von Annahmen ab, die sich nur noch durch Tradition begründen lassen: Dass der Mensch eine Würde besitzt oder heilig ist oder was besonderes, geht ja auf den Monotheismus zurück, der dem Menschen eine besondere Stellung im Kosmos zuweist. Auf der anderen Seite lassen aber immer mehr Indizien an diesen Annahmen zweifeln: Mensch und Nicht-Mensch (ob Tier oder Sache) lassen sich nicht empirisch klar voneinander abgrenzen.

Eigentlich sind es dann zwei Dinge, die auf dem Spiel stehen: Erstens die ""Stellung des Menschen im Kosmos"", und zweitens die Beziehung des Menschen zum Menschen. Das erste ist das, was im Transhumanismus verhandelt wird: Die Symbiose von Mensch und Technologie, die darauf hindeutet, dass wir ""neurokybernetische Maschinen"" sind und dass die ""Materie"" in gewisser Weise lebt oder das Potential besitzt, lebende Strukturen zu bilden. Das zweite wird eher unter dem Begriff ""Posthumanismus"" verhandelt und betrifft ethische und politische Aspekte: Ohne universalen Menschenbegriff, ohne Menschenbild, geht uns auch sowas wie ein emanzipatorisches Menschheitsprojekt verloren, und Begriffe wie ""Gerechtigkeit"" verlieren jeden Sinn.

Eines habe ich mit manchen Christen gemeinsam: Mich beschäftigt der scheinbare Verfall ""humanistischer Werte"" ziemlich, und ich frage mich: 1) Handelt es sich überhaupt um einen Verfall, d.h. war es jemals besser als heute? 2) Warum tun sich manche (mich vielleicht eingeschlossen) so schwer mit dem ""Tod Gottes"", dem Nihilismus oder dem Materialismus? Der eigenen Freiheit? Warum scheint es so evident, dass man einen Gott braucht, weil sonst alles erlaubt/sinnlos/nichtig ist? (alte Frage, siehe Kant) 3) Wie sieht denn eine linke(?) oder gutmenschliche oder humanistische Ethik aus, wenn absolute Werte nicht mehr glaubhaft sind? Lassen sich emanzipatorische Projekte noch als solche verstehen, oder gibt es nur noch unterschiedliche Interessen? 4) Wo zwischen konservativen (Post-)Modernisierungskritikern auf der einen und progressiven ""Transhumanisten"" auf der anderen Seite stehe ich eigentlich? - Ich suche nach Antworten.

P.S. ich hätte besser [Über den Transhumanismus zur „posthumanen Gesellschaft“?](http://www.linksnet.de/de/artikel/25018) als Link eingereicht. Und ich möchte noch auf [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthumanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthumanism) verweisen.

It started centuries ago with something called ""the Enlightenment"". But really universal it became only after WWII.

&gt; So it's in other places, but more secretly.

Not in Europe. Nobody can just put a police light on their car, no matter how rich they are or if they are the best friend of the president. 

As an example, in Germany our president resigned about a year ago. Because there were allegations that, about 20 years before, he may have helped a friend to get a loan from a bank, using his position as governor of one region at that time.

He was now president. But still, he resigned over this.

Its not acceptable in Europe when people in power misuse that power. No questions, no discussions. They have to resign.

Allowing somebody to misuse a police light would be a major scandal. Even only one case. I can't even imagine what would happen. Definitely there would be more than only one high-up person kicked out of office.

That's what the *independent press* is for. They usually find out about these things. And that's why in Russia, all newspapers, TV channels, and web sites now belong to friends of Putin. So he can control information and protect the Rich.

&gt; But improvements are not something that just come with some alliance or pact.

You are right. And the economic treaty that Ukraine signed with Europe therefore is not exclusive. Ukraine is free to sign other economic and trade treaties with other countries. Also with Russia. But unfortunately, that's not Russias plan. Russia wanted to force Ukraine into dependency.

* uno è collegato al motore termico (a benzina). Usato come motore avvia il motore termico, usato come generatore quando il motore termico è acceso fa da ""cambio"": se la velocità del motore termico è superiore a quella delle ruote, quella in eccesso finisce a ricaricare la batteria. Può anche essere lasciato spento ma collegato, per fornire freno motore alle ruote.

* uno è collegato alla batteria. Usato come motore fa girare le ruote e viene utilizzato in avviamento (i motori elettrici vanno bene da fermo, quando invece i motori termici proprio non vanno), usato come generatore fa appunto da kers (ma il guidatore non se ne accorge, l'effetto è quello di un limitato freno motore, diciamo come se fossi in terza sulla base dei 2 km che ho fatto durante il test drive).

Semplicemente se sono scariche userai il motore termico quasi sempre e consumerai di piu. Appena schiacci l'acceleratore parte il motore termico, che ricarica le batterie, che azionano il secondo motore che muove le ruote.

Il risparmio viene:

* dal fatto che il motore è dimensionato non sulla base della potenza richiesta in accelerazione, ma sulla base della potenza richiesta in crociera. In accelerazione usi la batteria.

* dal fatto che il motore è progettato per essere più efficiente a spese della coppia (che serve solo in accelerazione).",0,1406471109,null,0,1406472558,0,cj94uq3,t3_2bsk0d,t1_cj94uq3,t1_cj927jg,null,1434923496,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think the concepts of acquaintances and friends are the same everywhere in the world. We just give them different names. I'm not from the US but i understand what you're referring to. I would also call a guy i met for the 2nd time my friend, but he and i know that we dont know each other enough to borrow each other's car or sleep at each other's place.

But that isn't my problem. The problem is that breaking the barrier of acquaintances with Germans and becoming their friends is REALLY HARD. The social culture here is completely different from other parts of the world. I've been to German pubs and i've been to Spanish/italian/portuguese/greek pubs. The difference is just staggering.

Let me give you one example. We were at a local pub in Germany. They were closing down and had begun to clean up and we were the last ones. It was one of our friend's birthday and i went to the barkeeper, asked them if they could play the one last song while they clean up and while we finish our last drinks. She outright refused. I requested again and she refused, as if it was something outrageous or impossible for her to do.

Now, in comparison, we went to a portuguese pub. We were pretty drunk by then. The place was half full. I went to the DJ in my drunkenness, and asked him if he could play any song from the Doors at any time. He said its difficult but i'll try to fit it in. And he did end up playing that song.


This is a massive difference in people's mentality. The Portuguese pub had more people, was more central, had a running list of songs to play. The local pub in Germany was empty, had MP3s playing and was a much smaller pub.


I've come to the point where i accept it as a part of German life. I hate this part of my German life though but i cant change it because i cant make any German friends to begin with.",0,1406472092,null,0,false,0,cj955zc,t3_2bup3a,t1_cj955zc,t1_cj94rzy,null,1434923667,-8,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,-8

""Norwegian Iranians: A Model Immigrant Community""

&gt; SUMMARY. Iranian immigrants in Norway are some of 
the country's most successful and best-integrated non-Western 
minorities. There are currently over 15,000 first and second 
generation Iranians in Norway, making them the tenth largest 
immigrant group. The community is highly educated, secular, 
and has many examples of successful and prominent individuals 
but is split into various segments and does not possess a 
coherent identity. Any risk of radicalization is considered 
to be minimal, although there are indications that the 
Iranian embassy in Oslo has significant negative influence on 
other Muslim immigrant communities. END SUMMARY.

&gt;The Iranian community is a very successful and highly 
integrated group in Norway. Most Iranian-Norwegians have 
lived here for 15-20 years or longer and can be said to 
contribute more to the fabric of Norwegian society than 
Norwegian immigrant society. There are numerous examples of 
high-profile, successful individuals, and many have married 
Norwegians and others outside of their nationality.

&gt;Immigrants from Iran are the least religious group of 
any in Norway. When first and second generation Iranian 
immigrants were asked if they still belonged to the religion 
they were brought up with as children, only 50% answered 
""yes,"" while the combined number for all other immigrants is 
closer to 90%. Not surprisingly, the importance most Iranians grant 
religion in their lives is correspondingly low. When asked 
to rate this on a scale of 1 - 10 with ""1"" being ""not 
important at all"" and ""10"" being ""very important,"" the 
Iranians' average score is around 3.9--again, the lowest of 
any immigrant group. The total immigrant average is a much 
higher 6.9. Forty percent of Iranians actually answered this 
question with a ""1,"" meaning religion is not at all important 
to them. This is telling, as it reveals that not only have 
most Iranians left the religion in which they were raised 
(Islam), but that they have also not converted to another; 
religion simply is not a part of their lives.

&gt; Iranians are some of Norway's most educated 
immigrants. A remarkably low 16% have just a primary school 
education or less (including those with no education at all), 
making it the lowest of any immigrant group. Only the 
Chileans have a similarly low percentage of those with such a 
minimal education, at 18%. The average across all immigrants 
is over 30%. Turks, for example, have a staggering 51% 
getting by with only a primary school education or less.  University education is very high among Iranians, 
with an average of 43.5% either currently in school or having 
already attained a university degree (including those with a 
degree from Iran). This percentage dwarfs that of all other 
immigrant communities with the exception of the Chinese, who 
post numbers above 50%. The total immigrant average is only 
around 26%.",0,1406473875,null,0,1406474631,0,cj95r81,t3_2buywb,t1_cj95r81,t3_2buywb,null,1434923978,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

true,Aluhut,TEXT,der einzig Echte,"Wir haben schon mehrmals in der Geschichte die ""besondere"" Stellung verloren. Das ""besonders"" war dann mehr oder minder eine romantische Vorstellung von der eigenen Größe. Zuletzt ganz populär als es sich herumgesprochen hat, dass die Sonne nicht um die Erde kreist. Ich glaube wir können das gut verkraften.

Ganz im Gegenteil. Ich finde, dass dieser Fortschritt uns die Möglichkeit eröffnet ganz neue Wege zu suchen Meta-Antworten zu finden. Auch wenn sie nicht so neu sind. Man denke an die Sci-Fi Kultur. Sie werden die Chance bekommen die teilweise sehr versteiften akademischen Rahmen zu sprengen und sich in ernsthafter Betrachtung zu beweisen. Ich finde das klingt großartig. Ich wünschte ich wäre später geboren um mehr davon sehen zu können aber wer weiß, vielleicht wird die Entwicklung noch schnell genug sein ;)

""Verfall"" ist relativ. Zerstörung kann auch eine Chance für etwas neues sein. ""Verfall"" urteilt nach bestehenden Maßstäben. Vielleicht sollte man die aber auch überdenken? 

Zu:

1) Ich denke nicht. Die Werkzeuge waren anders aber vor allem war die Verteilung der Informationen nie so umfangreich wie heute. Man bekommt wirklich viel mit heute und erfolgreiche Ideen reisen mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit. Auf der anderen Seite denke (hoffe) ich schon, dass wir uns irgendwie weiter entwickeln. Evolutionäre Prozesse brauchen halt eine Weile und immerhin schleppen wir unsere Weiber nicht mehr an den Haaren in die Höhle und wir entwickeln Dronen damit wir dem Feind nicht mehr in die Augen schauen müssen wenn wir ihn töten. Das macht uns nämlich krank auf die Dauer. 


2) Warum nicht? Ist es nicht eine schöne Welt in der man da geboren ist? Alles läuft. Ignorance is a Bliss. Es ist viel einfacher vorgefertigte Antworten anzunehmen als selbst nach Antworten zu suchen. Rahmen in denen man denken ""darf"" sind auch super. Man kann sich immer sicher sein wohin es geht und wohin es ganz sicher nicht gehen wird. Erspart einen Haufen Enttäuschungen. Und die gehören wie nichts zur Suche nach alternativen Erklärungen. Religionen machen es sich einfach indem sie einfach eine Annahme voraussetzen die ultimativ ist. ""Gott wars"". Ende. Da ist nichts mehr dahinter. Bedenkt man wie oft Religion schon falsch lag kann man vernünftigerweise davon ausgehen, dass dieses Konstrukt nicht dazu befähigt ist ultimative Antworten zu formulieren.

3) Kann ich dir nichts zu sagen. Das was heute unter ""links"" fällt oder sich dafür hält, ist so vielfältig und auch widersprüchlich, dass da ein Pauschalurteil nicht wirklich zielführend wäre. Ich bin auch nicht wirklich der Spezialist für die.

Ich glaube, dass viel Potenzial in der Gleichgültigkeit der Menschen ist im Moment. Es ist eine Atmosphäre in der Systeme/Storys/whatever die Möglichkeit bekommen sich auszuprobieren. Erfolgreiche kommen weiter. Nicht erfolgreiche verschwinden. Das funktioniert am besten mit einem grenzenlosen ""Geist"".

So gefährlich das auch sein mag...gehört halt dazu wenn man erwachsen wird.

&gt; Der Ruf nach einer Entkriminalisierung von Cannabis sorgt bei der Gewerkschaft der Polizei (GdP) für Skepsis. Als Berufsvertretung der Polizisten, die tagtäglich auf der Straße mit den Problemen des Drogenkonsums und der Drogenkriminalität zu tun haben, setzt sich die GdP zwar für eine Versachlichung der teilweise hitzig geführten Debatte ein, ist aber klar gegen eine Freigabe von Cannabis. „Anstatt sich Gedanken um eine Legalisierung zu machen, sollte es ein Hauptanliegen der Politik sein, die Drogenprävention zu verbessern"", sagt GdP-Pressesprecher Rüdiger Holecek. Mit einer Freigabe sieht er massive Probleme auf die Gesellschaft zukommen. Zwar würde, wie bei jeder Legalisierung einer Straftat, die statistisch erfasste Kriminalität logischerweise sinken, dafür geht Holecek von einer Zunahme der Verkehrsunfälle unter Drogeneinfluss aus. Außerdem befürchtet man bei der GdP, dass nach einer Legalisierung mehr Menschen Haschisch rauchen würden. Gerade die Werbemöglichkeiten eines legalisierten Rauschgiftmarktes sorgen bei der Gewerkschaft für Bauchschmerzen. Zumindest theoretisch könnten sich die Produzenten und Händler offener Marketingmethoden bedienen und so Absatz und Konsum ankurbeln. „Mit einer Steigerung des Rauschgiftkonsums ist in jedem Fall zu rechnen - mit allen gesundheitlichen und sozialen Folgen"", so der GdP-Sprecher.

BTW, about this part:

Then Russia could ship all their goods to the EU through Ukraine and avoid all customs, thus creating a situation where there are no customs between Russia and EU. It makes sense for EU to decline this.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"In its current form, free trade can be pretty detrimental. I think low income nations being pressured into joining WHO can be detrimental to their economies. Especially isolated countries. 

The Caribbean is the perfect example. They have to rely on ships, so their factories are not directly connected to the US rail network and roadways like Mexican ones. On the flip side, much cheaper US and Canadian produce have flooded their markets, largely killing off their farming industries. 

That is a perfect example of a group of countries that were not ready to join WHO. They wanted to join, and used IMF loans as an excuse (at least that was what happened in Jamaica according to the retired government officials). They did gain factory jobs, but then we have to weigh the pros and cons of whether local farming is preferable to factory jobs. Farming, obviously, also has national security concerns as well. 

So I agree with you, especially when economies are so vastly different. I should have specified free trade between similar economies is almost always good. Because I am very aware of problems free trade can cause between vastly different economies. I think the old system of mercantilism would be very detrimental to everyone's standard of living, but would agree with allowing developing countries to implement safe guards for a certain number of years to allow their important industries to survive when they join WHO or sign a free trade agreement.

The Ukrainian army definitely isn't innocent, do have civilian blood on their hands, but aren't there to reek terror on the locals and push ideology, unlike the ""rebels"". A lot of people have resentment against the Army, but understand that they are the only ones who can end this conflict, and begin the long and painful transition back to normal life in the region. In liberated cities like Slavyansk, a fair presentage greet them as heroes, some are less enthusiastic, but practically all appreciate the fact that the Army is there to stabilize the region, and offer aid. 

The politicians in both Kiev and Moscow are seen as evil at this point. Regardless of who is ""responsible""; the people are the victims. It depends on what news they listen to in determining who they think are responsible. 

But almost everybody understands that the only way to end the conflict and get back to normal life is for the Army to win. People realize that only as part of Ukraine is there any hope of restoring order. Not as a ""People's Republic"" with war-hardened, ultra-nationalistic/violent leaders, and not as a disputed territory in Russia with years of integration and bullshit to follow.
Political concerns come after the gunshots end. Not to mention the humanitarian catastrophe that will follow.

Of course, if you're the kind of person who feels threatened and insecure by reason, to the point of mocking it like you did in this paragraph, there's no way you're going to understand your inflammatory comments just remove credibility to the side you think you're supporting by posting them.

From my neutral perspective, it's pretty obvious that your contributions in this thread are far more trollish and far worse than anyone else's, even though it's a fact that there are trolls on the other side too.

&gt; I am indeed being inflammatory like a petty troll, but it's for a good goal: Keeping this subreddit one of the few that hasn't been largely taken over by pro-Kremlin trolls.

I for one would rather not have any trolls from any venue. While you're just contributing for this sub to become infested with pro-Eu trolls instead. That solves nothing. That just makes this sub equally inadequate for intelligent debate. 

If indeed you want to make this sub a better place, you should always fight inflammatory discussions with reason, not with more inflammatory comments. I have my doubts those are your intentions though. It's very obvious that all you want is to turn this sub into a pro-Eu echo chamber/circlejerk where everyone agrees with you and makes you feel safe. Intelligent debate is the opposite, it takes you out of your comfort zone. Learn to not be a troll when you're uncomfortable.

&gt; Call me all you want. 

You just admitted repeatedly that you are a troll. I don't need to call you a troll anymore.

&gt; I am not stopping being a 'petty troll' until others stop pushing the Kremlin agenda on this subreddit. 

It's very sad that you can't see that any form of propaganda is bad and the fact that you agree with one type of propaganda is part of the problem. It breeds your type of behavior. You're fine with an agenda or propaganda as long as it makes you think you feel safe.

&gt; So if you want to stop me from being inflammatory

I don't want you to stop. You're free to do as you please. 

&gt; Be ACTUALLY neutral like you're pretending to be, by not supporting pro-Russian trolls on this subreddit like you have been doing in this thread.

The inflammatory accusations continue, I see. But this time you're being very specific, so allow me to demand a quote proving your accusations that I support Russian propaganda.

In failing to do so, I hope you realize what being neutral means, and I hope you may rid yourself of your petty need to rush into blindly supporting a side just to feel safe.",0,1406484826,null,0,false,0,cj9abyg,t3_2buk27,t1_cj9abyg,t1_cj99shk,null,1434926265,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I actually become hungry while writing this, though I just ate.

Edit: as for recipe:

1. Bigos — well, every house has it's own recipe and sometimes it's actually well protected family secret. The base is sauerkraut, meat and sausage. And to it you can add: wild mushrooms, prunes, honey, red wine, tomatoes, garlic, onion, and many, many more things. And you stew this for hours. The best thing? You can cool down bigos and reheat it infinite number of times, and it get's better every time. Popular proverb says „bigos tastes better on the second day”
2. marinated wild mushrooms: step one is the most fun — go to the woods (or meadow, or near a lake or stream — depends on the species) and pick some wild mushrooms (protip: edible are the best), step two is the least fun — wash the mushrooms and check them for worms, step three pick the small and firm ones (big and soft aren't good when marinated), boil them for a while in salted water with a bit of an onion, put in a jar with a few grains of pepper, allspice, juniper and a small leaf of bay laurel, then fill the jar with hot mixture of spirit vinegar 10% and water (I use 1:2 ratio, some people prefer milder 1:3 ratio), store for at least 2-3 months (though it's best to eat them before next season)
3. Buy vodka in a store. Keep it in your freezer. Drink. Rinse and repeat.

PS
I wouldn't be myself if I didn't show you this little fellas: http://imgur.com/a/19vEh (yep, boletus edulis)

true,sbstnb,SVAK,Slovakia,"&gt;I am aware of all the negative stereotypes and all the bad consequences that derived from Romania's accession to the EU (Gypsies running amok all over Europe). However, why do you dislike Romania ? Have we been bombing and killing Palestinians and I haven't heard of it yet ? Are we financing terror groups ? Are we trying to annex Slovakia ? Do we smell ? Wtf ?
Saying that we should have not been accepted in the EU is OK with me as it would be a valid opinion. Saying that you simply dislike Romania is not. For what reason ? We've made lots of progress since we joined and that trend seems to be continuing.

**I know you probably assumed that I only have a brief amount of knowledge/experience with Romania and that my opinion is based on nothing coherent/logical, but unfortunately it's not true.**

And no, my opinion has nothing to do with Gypsies etc. 

I actually lived in Romania for 2 years. And I just really couldn't bring myself to like most things about living there even though I tried. 

It might be that I'm used to something else, but Bucharest/Romania just seemed like a not very nice place to live. 

First of all the practical point of view:

- The transportation is awful. (This includes the city transport, **taxis**, **airport**, traffic., lack of motorways, terrible roads throughout the country)

- Bucharest is dirty. + Wires casually hanging everywhere.

- A lot of streets in Bucharest with normal housing don't even have pavements. Come on, that's the capital city. I don't even want to know what's it like in the most distant areas.

- Compared to other European cities I've lived in, there's a lot less places to spend free time at/less activities

- Corruption

- Literally would have a power cut for almost for a whole day at least once per month.

- The vast poverty - 3 year olds casually begging for money, attempts to steal it etc.

- The ridiculous amount of stray dogs and no apparent effort from anyone to lower it.

- General sense of disinterest from the majority of people to negative things around them. An evidence of this would be practically no improvement in any negative aspect over the the period of two years. Only slightly positive development was a new shopping centre in the area I lived.


And second of all, my subjective opinion/experience:

- Many of the people seem quite rude/ignorant.

- Personally experienced straight up racism multiple times. - Hardly ever happened to me elsewhere in Europe.

- Generally is not a foreigner-friendly place. (such as people charging me more just because I'm foreign etc.)

- And yes, I don't think Romania should have been accepted into the EU.

- Most of Bucharest and Romania in general looks very unappealing: 
The (whole country/most cities) especially Bucharest look very gloomy, unpleasant. Lots of communist buildings 
everywhere, not many nice things to look at. 

- I'll stop here but the list would definitely go on.


And it's not just the straight up negative aspects/experiences. It's the sheer lack of anything that would stand out to me; if I stayed for 2 weeks, my impression would be that the country/city of Bucharest is mostly dreary, grey, unfriendly with not much to do. Combine that with the many negatives and you get my opinion.
And I want to add: Before I moved there, my opinion was pretty neutral. I had nothing to do with Romania in the past so I was neither excited nor annoyed that I'd go and live there.

I admit that a lot of my dislike towards Romania was accumulated through all of those over the period of two years, and the fact that I personally didn't expect that I would find so few things I like about the country in such a long period of time. I based my expectations on living in plenty other European cities/countries. Romania was simply put my worst experience of them all.

And I don't think there's any need for you to get annoyed; this is my personal opinion and I understand that to someone else, most of the things I found negative might be unimportant or even pleasant. But it's my right to create my own opinion about a country after living there for 2 years. It wasn't the first foreign country in Europe I've lived in, and certainly isn't the last.
I based my opinion when I compared it to other places I've lived in.

The only place in Romania that I'd see as prevailingly positive is Brasov. And yeah, the nature, it's very pretty once you get out of the towns.",0,1406486442,null,0,1406486673,0,cj9b256,t3_2bvc2a,t1_cj9b256,t1_cj99viw,null,1434926663,19,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,19

So you spend decades dependent on coal and gas because you guys just close your eyes to what the real cost of your energy is.  Go it.

Nuclear plants are not nuclear bombs at all.  Its not even close to a realistic comparison.  Three mile island and Fukushima haven't caused any deaths and the Japan has a much higher population density than Germany.  Also most of the US power plants are actually near population centers as well, because that is where the power is needed.

Coal pollution with scrubbers and emissions control will still kill thousands.  And yes coal plants do explode.  Not to even count coal mining where thousands more die every year.  Here are some introductory sources.

Your political class also does not reduce this fear, corruption and primitivity seem to dominate. Finally our right wing people in the rich north/west need a concept of the enemy, and they have an instinct to build upon said fears.

Of course I feel threathened. The past few months more and more subreddits have been getting more pro-Russian. I don't want this happening to subreddits I visit.

&gt; there's no way you're going to understand your inflammatory comments just remove credibility to the side you think you're supporting by posting them.

Oh I understand them. I don't care if they remove my credibility. As long as this subreddit doesn't become the billionth subreddit to lose it's 'somewhat' neutrality, I don't care how much credit you think I have.

&gt; From my neutral perspective

Ahaha.

&gt;  for one would rather not have any trolls from any venue.

Me neither, but pro-Russian trolls have sadly made it a necessity.

&gt; While you're just contributing for this sub to become infested with pro-Eu trolls instead. That solves nothing.

It does solve something if it prevents it getting infested by pro-Kremlin trolls. Pro-EU troll &gt; Pro-Kremlin troll.

&gt; That just makes this sub equally inadequate for intelligent debate.

No, what's making this sub inadequate for intelligent debate is the increase in pro-Russian rhetoric. There's a lot of bullshit in favor of the Kremlin flying around the internet these days. Banning it is more  free speech than allowing it. This is a European subreddit, banning non-European opinions will always be preferable to European opinions being banned.

The best way to prevent this subreddit from swinging to the Russian side, is by preventing Russian trolls form spewing their propaganda around here. You might think that banning anything will result in one sides debate, but it's actually the fact that we're allowing Russian bullshit that's threatening reasonable debate.

&gt; If indeed you want to make this sub a better place, you should always fight inflammatory discussions with reason, not with more inflammatory comments. I have my doubts those are your intentions though. It's very obvious that all you want is to turn this sub into a pro-Eu echo chamber/circlejerk where everyone agrees with you and makes you feel safe. Intelligent debate is the opposite, it takes you out of your comfort zone. Learn to not be a troll when you're uncomfortable.

Than you're mistaking. I want to allow every single opinion. But what I do not support is Russian propaganda. I'd rather have this be a pro-EU cirle-jerk than the next subreddit to be taken over by Russian trolls. What you and another mate of yours are doing is spreading Russian propaganda. So don't act all innocent talking about allowing opinions. What you've been saying here aren't innocent opinions, they're propaganda.

&gt; It's very sad that you can't see that any form of propaganda is bad and the fact that you agree with one type of propaganda is part of the problem. It breeds your type of behavior. You're fine with an agenda or propaganda as long as it makes you think you feel safe.

Indeed any form of propaganda is bad, that's what I'm doing. I am cancelling out pro-Kremlin propaganda by reacting to those pro-Kremlin propaganda comments with EU propaganda.

&gt; I don't want you to stop. You're free to do as you please.

You say that in a debate that's basically all about me being inflammatory. If you don't want to prove me wrong: Don't debate me.

It's funny how much inaccurate conclusions you pull about me from one comment thread. I have actually debated opinions here completely opposite of mine. When the other was being reasonable, so was I, I am willing to debate anyone fairly. I never really downvote or anything because of opinion. But if you're downright lying, propagandising, making bullshit excuses and coming up with other dumb rhetoric, I do not owe you any 'intelligent' debate. 

Intelligent debate will be answered with intelligent debate. Propaganda will be answered with propaganda. Non-serious bullshit, will be answered with non-serious bullshit.

&gt; The inflammatory accusations continue, I see. But this time you're being very specific, so allow me to demand a quote proving your accusations that I support Russian propaganda.
In failing to do so, I hope you realize what being neutral means, and I hope you may rid yourself of your petty need to rush into blindly supporting a side just to feel safe.

Alright let's roll.

&gt; Your two comments in this thread are exclusively inflammatory (ad hominem on the first comment) and focused on derailing the conversation (OP didn't say anything about this ""change"" you mention absurdly in your second comment). You're not here to have a conversation with people who would rather remain skeptical of the intentions from both sides of this story. You're here just to add to the echo chamber others want to comment in.

You're defending a pro-Russian troll here at all costs. I was making fun of someone spewing propaganda. Now you may say: But he was just giving his opinion! You're spreading pro-EU propaganda!

Let's run his comment down:

&gt; I'd argued the US intelligence services are just as much culpable if this sort of illogical blame-game is being played by childish propaganda.
This is as serious as when the EU was warned about the damage escalation of geopolitical wargames would cause before the Ukraine crisis started. And so it has come to pass. Since then /r/europe has been overwhelmingly a hotbed of propaganda supporting the EU against Russia. This is the latest absurd bias in embracing an unreality that has spiralled out of control and become extermely dangerous causing innocent loss of life.

The only thing he does is talking about how Western powers are conspiring against Russia. Making up stuff, being biased and not getting in touch with reality. He gives zero proof of this, while there is tons of prove that it's Russia that's spreading propaganda. I am not denying the West doesn't have propaganda, but thinking Western propaganda is actually less closer to reality is incredible. 

There is tons of proof that both sides use propaganda, but Russia's propaganda is completely spiralling out of control. I could agree to the statement that everyone uses propaganda, but Russia is going wild with it. What's completely backwards is the statement that Western propaganda is actually larger than Russian propaganda. 

I know the West uses it, but you literally have to be retarded to think that the Russian propaganda is actually less than Western propaganda.

OP of the original comment is being far from neutral, I am responding to this by being far from neutral myself. If OP was actually neutral it could've been a nice debate, but instead he acts as if Russia is completely innocent. And you are defending it. If you are actually such an example of neutrality, attack/defend both sides or neither, not like you do now defend one side in a full blown tirade about 'open discussion'.",0,1406488114,null,0,false,0,cj9bsso,t3_2buk27,t1_cj9bsso,t1_cj9abyg,null,1434926942,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Je ne sais pas où tu es est thésard, si comme moi tu l'es en France (et attention, pas en SHS (Sciences Humaines et Sociales)), effectivement, la thèse c'est le pied. Perso mes directeurs sont géniaux, on s'entend bien ensemble, bosse bien ensemble, on s'éclate (je fait aussi des maths).

Après j'ai eu l'occasion de bosser avec des thésards américains : le statut est un peu compliqué, d'une part ils n'ont en général pas de bourse pour leur travail de thésard comme nous en France, mais un mi-temps (en temps qu'étudiants ils n'ont pas le droit à plus), soit en temps que teaching assistant (TA) où ils doivent donner des TDs, soit en temps que Research Assistant (là c'est plus pour les travaux de recherche, mais souvent sur un sujet qui n'a rien à voir (ou presque) avec leur thèse). 

Ensuite globalement leurs directeurs-rices de thèse se foutent un peu de ce qu'ils font, ils ont 25 thésards, ne leur parlent quasiment pas (une ou deux fois par an), mettent à la fin leur nom sur le papier (une fois j'ai rajouté le nom d'un encadrant une semaine avant la soumission, je n'ai jamais parlé à cette personne et ait juste bossé avec son thésard rencontré lors de conférences !). J'ai même deux exemples où les directeurs de thèses ne bossaient pas dans la même ville que le thésard (et pas de co-encadrement) !

Donc ouais, il y a cent fois des raisons de se plaindre.

Pour imaginer peut-être ce que c'est, tu peux aussi essayer de discuter avec des thésards en SHS. Pour ma part, j'ai eu l'occasion de bosser avec des profs de philo et de russe sur la ré-écriture de la charte de thèse de mon université. La meilleure illustration est ces deux phrases issues des discussions :

 * [Contexte : On débattait sur le fait qu'il est important de vérifier que les gens qui commencent leur thèse aient un financement (soit une bourse de thèse, soit des parents, soit un boulot à côté (en général prof de lycée chez les SHS..))]
**""Pourquoi on devrait s'intéresser à comment le thésard va financer ses études : au pire le thésard ira bosser chez macdo en parallèle""**

 * [Contexte : On débattait sur le fait qu'un nombre de thésards max par directeur de thèse devait être imposé dans la charte des thèses]
**""Un nombre max de thésards par directeurs de thèse ? Mais vous n'y pensez pas, moi en ce moment j'ai 20 excellents doctorants qui bossent sur Spinoza, imaginez qu'un 21è excellent doctorant vienne me voir et me demande de faire une thèse avec moi sur Spinoza, je ne vais quand même pas lui dire non ?!""** (au passage, après discussion avec certains de ses doctorants, il ne les rencontrerait que une à deux fois par an...

Souvent en SHS (comme aux US), les thésards n'ont pas de bureau, donc ne peuvent pas ""échanger des idées avec leurs collègues"". Là je dois partir en postdoc aux US dans un labo de recherche (et pourtant réputé) avec une bourse française, on m'a prévenu que tous les thésards et les postdocs qui n'avaient pas un financement directement du labo avaient leur bureau dans les couloirs, qu'il allait falloir que je m'achète de bons écouteurs parce que sinon c'est compliqué de bosser avec tous les passages... Et je serais en postdoc !

true,[deleted],null,null,"I LIVE IN EAST GERMANY! I know a lot of people who were here in the eighties (as adults, I mean...) and actually most of them support Putin now, so your argument kind of sucks.
The thing is, what do you reasonably expect of Germany? Our politics have to be peaceful, there is simply too much historical responsibility for anything else.
Germany is in the unique situation of having been literally separated by the iron curtain, with the former Eastern part still being politically very socialist and leftist (seriously, check out the voting results).
So on the one hand, you have Putin, who supported the economy, who has shown again and again greatest respect to our head of state Angela Merkel (they talk in German, too, even though she's fluent in russian) and to the German people and on the other hand you have ""the West"" which is basically the US, who were caught spying on us three times in the last year (Merkels phone plus two American spies in our intelligence)...  then there is TTIP, which literally nobody but the lobbies support and which people here are very wary of, which means the sentiment is not exactly pro-American PLUS the fact that an insane amount of coverage of the Ukraine conflict is very clearly manipulative (from both sides). 

So people know they are uninformed at best (at which point they say ""let's wait and actually get some proof who shot down planes/bombs the cities etc."" - because conclusive proof is one of the things notably lacking in this conflict) or plain mistrusting of the governments...

Also everyone knows nobody actually gives a rat's ass about the Ukrainian people, least of all the EU (who really can't afford another unstable country) or Russia or the US (who are both just trying to protect their influence spheres)

The NATO has really expanded far beyond the borders they promised Russia, so its no wonder there was going to be retaliation. Everyone knew that.

So what do you realistically want to do? 
Have the US, who think they are cops of the world, invade Ukraine? Because that would surely stabilize the country like it did in Iraq and would leave Putin so many choices to protect his own borders...I dont know bout you but i could live without a second cold war

Have EU countries invade? The EU dont have an army, no single countries would want either the risks or the costs (least of all germany who have been very wary of military intervention over the last years)

Send UN troops? (Because they were so useful in Srebrenica and because that totally wouldnt be a direct aggression against Putin?)

Keep sanctioning Russia? Apart from the fact that that would be really stupid and random (we never sanctioned the US for Iraq or Guantanamo), it would be unsustainable for the economy and really unjustified since Putin has actually always been very approachable for Germany

Also Russia hasnt fucking invaded Ukraine...Yeah, they supported the rebels but that is far from a fucking invasion. (btw the US supported rebels in Syria etc. too so calling it an invasion because it suits the west now would be hypocritical as fuck) and no party is interested in East Ukraine becoming part of Russia...

TBH I believe it would be best if Donetsk and so on became autonomous because they pretty strongly opposed the Euromaidan (which is totally understandable)..yeah they would be under Russian influence (like they literally always were), but why the fuck would that be so bad? There are a lot of countries that were supported by the US (among them multiple violent dictatorships in Latinoamerica) which everyone was fine with...that would not be the perfect solution but I believe it would be best for the people actually living there",0,1406491234,null,0,1406491535,0,cj9d73l,t3_2bslgg,t1_cj9d73l,t1_cj9bhhq,null,1434927597,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

I am not saying they ""won't work"". I'm saying that the Ukraine has no reason to feel safe only because the EU establishes sanctions. They'll still want to arm themselves against perceived agression.

Actually, we can test your theory. It has been decided to add economical sanctions to the sanctions that are already in force, only the details are missing. So as soon as the details are decided on and the sanctions are in effect, the Ukraine should say ""all right, we are safe now, we no longer need nuclear weapons."" Correct? After all, it's you theory that only the missing sanctions force the Ukraine to arm themselves with nuclear weapons.

&gt; It seems to be more looking out for the short term economic concerns than anything else.

You noticed that economical sanctions have been decided on? But of course any move that hurts yourself as well as the opponent isn't a particular good move.

true,dirkt,null,null,"&gt; So you spend decades dependent on coal and gas

Germany has always used coal and gas, in addition to other energy sources like nuclear. No change in principle here. Also, most nuclear power plants are not shut down. They will be shut down in the long run.

&gt; Nuclear plants are not nuclear bombs at all.

Yes, they are. Read up on how a nuclear plant works. It has to slow down the nuclear reaction (a process called ""moderation""). When it is not able to do that anymore, the reactor becomes critical, the core melts and lots of radiation and radioactive substances are produced. That's the same process as in a nuclear bomb.

Let me repeat: All existing nuclear plants are bombs in slow motion, by design. They have to be *stopped* from running away. This is fundamentally unsafe, and no amount of technolgy can make that safe.

There are alternative constructions like molten-salt reactors who don't suffer from this problem, but we're not talking about these, because the existing plants are not of this kind.

&gt; Fukushima haven't caused any deaths 

""Deaths"" are a poor measure of the consequences of a radiactive incident. The relevant consequences of a nuclear incident are the radioactivity that lingers in the environment, which causes cancer and makes people die earlier, often decades after the exposition. Read up on the ""liquidators"" of Cernobyl. None of them died directly after the accident.

Fukushima is close to the coast, and a substantial part of the radiactive fallout went into the sea. And the problem is not that people died there, the problem is that people won't be able to live in this area for a long time. Japans population is much more concentrated in centers like Tokyo. 

&gt; Coal pollution with scrubbers and emissions control will still kill thousands.

What? Oh, come on. What kind of propaganda have you been reading? Germany has been using coal power plants for a long time, and other power plants the burn e.g. garbage. I've been living nearly next to one for 10 years. Nobody has died from that. The problem with coal power plants is that they increase the CO2 and cause climate change.

This is now really getting ridiculous.

&gt; http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/

Wrong problem, this is about air pollution, especially in third world countries that *don't* filter air when burning stuff. 

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_accidents

Coal mine != coal power plant. Yes, coal dust can explode. Also, coal dust affects lungs when the workers are unprotected. We had that problem like 50 years ago, but that's long past.

Also, from this article (Wikipedia is constantly edited by people with an ideological agenda, so it's not a reliable source, but just as illustration): 

&gt; Benjamin Sovacool says that while hydroelectric plants were responsible for the most fatalities, nuclear power plants rank first in terms of their economic cost, accounting for 41 percent of all property damage. Oil and hydroelectric follow at around 25 percent each, followed by natural gas at 9 percent and coal at 2 percent.[1",0,1406492690,null,0,false,0,cj9duro,t3_2bslgg,t1_cj9duro,t1_cj9b56q,null,1434927971,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

The reason for military law is generally to be able to punish infractions by serving soldier in relation to things you couldn't and wouldn't want to against civilians. It isn't (usually) intended as a full on replacement of civilian law, but an addition - that is reasonable when you consider things like being a bit late for work, or wearing the wrong kit has different implications for someone going out on a fighting patrol in Afghanistan, compared to say, someone repairing cars in Hampshire.  

The usual thing with military law in any case is that you first suffer the normal consequences (say for a driving offence) then a military one (for having been convicted of a driving offence). So whilst it is a different standard, it is generally a higher one that people voluntarily sign up for as a condition of their service.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"This is something that lawyers and philosophers debate about. The conventional debate is between (to massively simplify) legal positivists, who argue that the only laws that exist are those laws that a society enacts, and natural lawyers, who argue that there is a natural justice that overrides unjust laws. A natural lawyer might argue that human rights legislation is part of the natural law that exists indepently of what society has enacted, whereas a positive lawyer would argue that human rights only exist to the extent that they have been enacted.

While I like the natural law theory, which has had a massive impact on the development of the English common law and the tradition of liberties within the English common law and derivative legal systems, ultimately I find the positive law theory more convincing and better describes what actually happens and has happened in different societies over the ages.

Personally I am not a massive fan of a lot of human rights legislation as I find it somewhat vague and very open to different interpretations and thus judicial activisim. Also, rather than setting out a list of positive rights that individuals have, my preference would be for the starting point for humans having a right to do everything, other than those few things that society takes away from us. I guess I therefore prefer the term ""human liberty"" to ""human right"". Attitude towards rights is something that separates English lawyers from our American cousins.

 * The Costa Concordia completed its last voyage, having being towed from the Giglio Island to Genoa where it will be dismantled. Genoa was selected after harsh competition between several harbors, all wanting to take home the substantial payout for the job. This was of course a good occasion for a photo op, with politicians patting themselves on the back for the 'mission accomplished' party, and apparently also a form of rebuttal to France, who was expecting the Concordia to fall apart and pour crap all over the sea. [HuffPo](http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2014/07/27/costa-concordia-genova_n_5624266.html?utm_hp_ref=italy)

 * Since it's somehow 'HAHA FRANCE TAKE THIS' day, for some reason, the Tour de France was won by an Italian. This was mysteriously connected with the Concordia not falling apart. [HuffPo](http://www.huffingtonpost.it/2014/07/27/vincenzo-nibali-vince-tour-de-france_n_5624549.html?utm_hp_ref=italy)

 * Someone configured July as November, so we're getting rain and storms all over the place, with floodings and landslides.

 * Renzi's government is trying to pass a Senate reform, which should harshly reduce the number of senators and their roles and also change the way they are elected: mayors will also be senators, but only sometimes, or something like that. Well, lots of people don't like that, so they registered something like 8000 amendments for discussion in the attempt to foil this evil plan, mostly similar to ""paragraph 2, line 3: add one space"". Renzi is threatening to use the Special Secret Power of Amendment Mass Destruction to do away with all this. Cue the ""AAAH DICTATORSHIP"" cries, even though such a law will still have to pass a referendum, being a change to the constitution.

What you see in that video tho is what an artillery battalion looks like: artillery, an escort consisting of BMP's, infantry, short range AA (usually intended against helicopters since they fly too low for systems like the BUK and tend to use the terrain to their advantage) and supply trucks. This doesn't look like some scavenged vehicles, this looks like a unit from a well organized military. That's not hardware that you just happen to stumble upon. The only plausible means by which rebels could acquire such hardware (without russia doing a generous donation) is if they overran an Ukrainian army base.


Now you might think that the civilian trucks transporting soldiers indicates somehow that the vehicles might be scavenged, but this is not necessarily true: The swiss army for example has merces sprinter's to transport soldiers (as well as other types of cars).

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"The 'discovered' conception of human rights doesn't necessarily imply a believe in a high being. It's been a while since I studied philosophy, but IIRC one of Kant's major achievements was coming up with a justification for morality and human rights independent of God. He was religious and usually factors God in right at the end, but the core of his argument was that humans were essentially rational beings and that as rational beings we have obligations to behave in a certain way generally and their are certain rights that we have in return for being rational agents. It's worth noting that Kant believed in order for a human to be rational they had to be 'free' and for Kant that meant being independent of their desires and intuitions. You had to have restraint in order to be 'free', which for Kant is what separated us from animals. For Kant, free beings (I think rational agents was the word for it in his lexicon IIRC) both had moral responsibilities (for instance, never to treat another being as a means to an ends) but also rights which would be fulfilled by other rational agents. It's interesting as well that Kant believed people had rights *to* things rather than rights *from* things. For instance, in a lot of American conceptions of human rights centre around things are *freedom* ***from*** *government oppression* in other words other entities *won't* do certain things to you. You have the right *not* to have certain things done to you. But Kant would go so far as saying things like education were rights. He would say that we have a right *to* an education, because education was necessary in order for a being to become a rational agent. So I think rights, for Kant, aren't so much things we all have a right to, but things that everybody else has an *obligation* to fulfil for you, just like you have an obligation to fulfil it for them. 

edit: I also feel it pertinent to say that [Jeremy Bentham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham), the founder of Utilitarianism and godfather to John Stuart Mill, also had an interesting conception of God independent rights.

You also need to consider the distinction between having a *right* to do something, and simply being *allowed* to do it. The example that comes to my mind immediately, is a recent Irish Supreme Court decision on 'the right to die'. The Court held that the Constitution permits people to take their own lives, but it doesn't give them the *right* to do so. Thus, if they are incapable of doing it themselves, the State is not under an obligation to step in and help. So, to say that we should all have the *right* to do everything (other than that which is prohibited), would be going too far (specifically in a jurisdiction that acknowledges the right/allowance distinction.

La région qui correspond actuellement à l’Algérie n’était qu’une entité du Maghreb où vivaient des habitants d’origine phénicienne, berbère ou romaine. Cette population d’essence chrétienne a été convertie de force par les Arabes venus du Moyen-Orient.

Puis vinrent les Turcs, qui ont contribué à maintenir un climat de guerre civile larvée entre les différentes tribus, tout en continuant à prélever l’impôt. Cette absence de maintien de l’ordre a permis le trafic d’esclaves chrétiens. Une partie de ces esclaves étaient d’ailleurs français. Beaucoup d’entre eux ont été rachetés à la fin du XVIIIème siècle par l’Ordre de la trinité.

Au XVIème siècle, trente mille esclaves chrétiens laissaient encore traîner une chaîne derrière eux à Alger. Avec l’arrivée des Français en 1830, les esclaves ont été libérés et les Ottomans chassés permettant aux tribus arabes et berbères de se libérer d’une oppression certaine.

Contrairement au mythe du colon français sanguinaire, les Français ont apporté la médecine, fertilisé les sols, créé des canaux d’irrigation, un réseau routier, alphabétisé la population et n’ont interdit ni la pratique de l’islam, ni de la langue arabe.

L’Histoire constitue une totalité qu’on ne peut rabaisser à un bon et un mauvais côté. Si Maurras avait raison dans sa lutte contre la colonisation, la stupide repentance contemporaine laisse à croire que les Français n’ont perpétré que des atrocités en Algérie, alors que les faits rappelés ci-dessus démontrent le contraire.

What we have are not human rights, just rights granted by the government. The perception of them being 'human rights' gives them a higher status (I suppose akin to a constitution, though being from the UK and without a codified constitution perhaps others may think different) as it may mean that governments are more reluctant to fuck with them because of the social expectation of the protection of these rights, but the government can fuck with them nonetheless.

I suppose I agree with the last line of your first post. They are real because we say they are real, but this also gives them a vulnerability where they can be taken away.

Yes, they are. Read up on how a nuclear plant works. It has to slow down the nuclear reaction (a process called ""moderation""). When it is not able to do that anymore, the reactor becomes critical, the core melts and lots of radiation and radioactive substances are produced. That's the same process as in a nuclear bomb.
""
I am aware that both use a fission chain reaction.  There are no moderators or safety systems in nuclear bomb and nuclear bombs are designed to never be contained or slowed down.  Nuclear reactors are designed with multiple redundant systems to not produce a runaway nuclear chain reaction.

Yes I a talking about molten-salt reactors and Generation 4 nuclear reactors  .  Also it might be possible to switch to a thorium fuel cycle.  Yes they are designed to relax to sub critical in the event that infrastructure of the reactor fails.  I am talking about transitioning to those designs in Europe and the US.  Transitioning to generation 4 nuclear and renewable energy sources while eliminating coal and natural gas.  

Transitioning to new generations of nuclear reactors is no less realistic than increasing the efficiency of renewable energy sources, I would suggest it is even more.  It mostly requires the political will to do so.  

""
""Deaths"" are a poor measure of the consequences of a radiactive incident. The relevant consequences of a nuclear incident are the radioactivity that lingers in the environment, which causes cancer and makes people die earlier, often decades after the exposition. Read up on the ""liquidators"" of Cernobyl. None of them died directly after the accident.
""
http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-03-10/fukushima-radiation-proves-less-deadly-than-feared

I am aware that Fukushima has left an exclusion zone of 15 miles.  While this is not good, it still is no reason to get rid of nuclear power...it is more of a reason to make sure that new reactors get put into place.  Japan is more dense than Germany everywhere.  (850 people/sq mile vs 600 convert that square kilometers it doesn't matter)

I know all about the ""liquidators"".  Many suffered acute radiation poisoning and died horrible deaths.  Probably no worse though than the Bhopal disaster of 1984.  The long and short of this is that industrial disasters are a tragedy no matter if it is nuclear, chemicals, dams, coal or natural gas.  Overall the safety record of nuclear is much better than any other form of energy production.

""Coal mine != coal power plant.  ""

You have to mine the stuff before you can use it.  The main sources of coal for the world are in China, US, India, and Russia (especially for the EU).  Now you import a ton of coal and you just shift the problem from your borders to other borders.

http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303417104579543814192542586

Coal ash can be filtered out somewhat but would always affect those vulnerable to asthma and cardiovascular problems.  If Germany is going replace nuclear it will likely be with more coal and gas, so it will only increase the amount of combustion byproducts put into the atmosphere for energy production in German.

I think if you look at Brazil and Portugal, Cuba and Spain, Canada and the USA and (finally) the UK and Ireland you can see that distinct cultures can exist quite easily in a globalised world without having their own, individual, languages. The countries I've mentioned aren't ideal examples, because they have such a huge level of shared history and were (in every instance) governed from combined place until just a few hundred years ago. But unfortunately we have no current examples of separate cultures that adopted the same language, without having significant shared history. But we are about to start seeing that, and we will very likely see that, for instance, all of the Nordic countries retain their distinct cultures despite becoming increasingly English speaking. 

Additionally, I'd like to get the point across that it is extremely likely that we could have English as a European second language, which everybody learns and knows, whilst the various regional (national) languages still exist and are used. Catalonia is a good example of this. Everybody in Catalonia knows and can operate in Spanish (however much they don't want to, but that's a political rather than cultural issue) but lives their daily lives in Catalan.

true,MoreGott,,,"As you seem somehow frustrated with us Germans, maybe I can help by giving you my perspective. It's of course only based on me and my experience.

The foreign friends I have, I met through German friends who happen to know them and introduced them to me. This isn't because I don't like to talk to ""those foreign people"" but if I get to know someone it's not just like ""hey he/she looks interesting, I'm gonna talk to him/her"" or just because we have a project for one week. I usually have to hang out with them in a non-serious matter (read: not for classes, not for projects etc.)

Now even with all new people - even Germans - there is this kind of barrier for me: when I meet someone via a friend, I'm not jumping right in, because

a) I don't want to talk only to my friend and make the new person uncomfortable, because he/she has nothing to pitch in on our friendship, as we usually know each other longer.

b) I'm not familiar with how those two interact with each other. It's like group dynamic, if you know, what I mean. Every person has his way of interacting with others and more often than not you are slightly different when around different people - because of your history together and because you know what's funny to him/her etc. For example: with you, your friend can make jokes about how his last shit looked like an actual ""?"" and you both laugh. For another person that would be utterly disgusting. 

So I am personally a bit more cautious and try to ""read the room"" and their relationship... what's funny for all of us, what is taboo (I mean: making jokes about let's say black people can be funny, if the other person knows you are in fact joking and not a racist. But that can really blow up in your face if the newly introduced person is a fourth black and you can't see it etc. And before this argument, I often hear, about ""making jokes about minorities is in fact racist"": no it's not. If you can only make fun of the majority living in a country, aren't you actually pushing others even more into the ""exotic, not part of regular society"" thing? If you accept other cultures into yours, you should be allowed to make fun of them as well).

Basically I try to not exclude the new person. Which may seem distant.

The next big part of that is: if you are learning German, I'm usually sure you want to practice it with us German guys when you come to a party etc. But I'm a bit uncomfortable with it, as you are still learning and could be feeling excluded if you only understand 30% of what we are talking about. And maybe you just pretend to  understand because it's also pretty uncomfortable to ask every few seconds ""what does that mean"". It's unreasonable, as you are trying to learn, but when I was in Japan, I really felt dumb when asking all the time. Now do I use English? I could, but usually the foreigners ask me to switch to German again, because they want to practice it. After encountering this situation a few times, I just kept silent for a while, as to see how well your German is, as to not make you feel excluded... which then again could be read as ""I don't like you, that's why I don't talk to you!""
