His arrogance is off the charts. No matter how powerful someone is (or thinks they are), Merkel's time is very valuable. For fun lets assume Obama, Cameron or Hollande is more powerful than Putin.

false,-_-Nope,BRUX,Brussels,"&gt;Most of the Socialist Party still supports him

The number of militants collapsed in the past two year, the general state of mind of those staying [is a big ""wtf""](http://www.franceculture.fr/emission-l-atelier-du-pouvoir-ps-le-blues-des-militants-2014-11-09), every election since 2012 show that the PS doesn't manage to rally a large part of its electoral base anymore, and the MJS (PS' youth movement) has been openly and drastically criticizing some of the government's decisions. 

&gt;most of its militants support his Prime Minister

Well, the only way to actually know that, apart from polls, would be an election. And so far the Prime Minister still is Mr. 5%.

&gt;The Greens are far-Leftists

Then what are the communists? Extreme-far-left?  And to left of the communist (anarchists, trotskyists...)? Ultra-extreme-far-left? 
No, the left-wing has always been divided between the reformists and the revolutionaries. Only the latter is far-left, and they're not much people left in there (L.O, NPA etc). No need to change academically-accepted typologies to fit your analysis. 

&gt;Their opinions have no credibility, their candidate, Martine Aubry, lost the primary, it's Hollande the center-Left moderate who was elected, and now that he's been elected they just turn against him because they're huge idiots who only care about themselves instead of their party.

Or, maybe, it is because the socialist MPs feel like they haven't been elected to do the same things as Sarkozy did, after 5 years of opposing him in every way. Unfortunately, they do care for their party. It is mainly because of their ""party discipline"" that they haven't voted *against* critical projects (such as the budget law, or european austerity treaties) but only *declined* to vote, which allow those projects they don't agree with to be adopted. 

&gt;His only really Leftists propositions, outside of gay marriage, were just stunts, and were received as such by everyone.

They were stunts, that is a given. I don't think at all that they were received as such by everyone. The fact that he managed to rally the radical left on the second turn in 2012 show that those stunts worked.  The faith the greens or some intellectuals put in him for the first two years, despite everything, was pretty amazing too.  And, also, [this gem](http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/election-presidentielle-2012/20120304.OBS2872/emmanuel-todd-je-parie-sur-l-hollandisme-revolutionnaire.html) :-)

&gt;No one who wasn't delusional believed Hollande, a moderate nobody that had been incompetent at the head of his party and was dubbed Flamby, would suddenly head the anticapitalist crusade those who hate him for not being Leftist enough want.

Oh dear, yes, yes, many people were delusional about this.  I swear to you that I've talked to numerous intelligent people actually *believed* that he would have a left-wing agenda. They didn't think he would be radical, nor that there would be a *anticapitalist crusade*, but they genuinely believed he would be a true left-wing alternative to Sarkozy, not the continuity of Sarkoz's politics. 

&gt;Hollande was elected because people were tired of Sarkozy, not for his propositions or personality, and in the end he simply sucks just as much, period.

And why do you think people got tired of Sarkozy? Because they didn't like his face? They didn't like his style? Voting for someone else is just a cosmetic change? No, let's be serious, people who got tired of Sarkozy did so because of his politics, and his lack of results. You don't change president because you don't like the guy, you change president because you don't like what he does (or what he is not doing) to your country. People (or just above 50% of them) wanted a change, not just a new face. They didn't get it. 

&gt;By business, I meant small companies more than huge corporations, but they absolutely need to be supported,

Everyone will agree with that, but massively cutting spending and supporting small businesses are pretty much two opposite things. You're not doing any good to small business if you freeze public servants salaries and reduce welfare, it only ends up in people benefiting from it to consume less. It is a vicious circle. By now, with the dramatic examples of Greece and Spain, (and before them, Latin America), it should have been understood: austerity never works. 

&gt;The state represents a ridiculous 58% of national spending.

And the private sector [represents 200% of national spending](http://blogs.rue89.nouvelobs.com/chez-les-economistes-atterres/2014/05/07/calculee-comme-la-depense-publique-la-depense-privee-depasserait-200-du-pib-232861). We should be ok. 

&gt;the country's image in business around the world is terrible

Yet France is always very well ranked in the world's top FDI destinations, it still attracts hundreds of thousands of immigrants every year, and its decisions are always carefully observed by the rest of the EU. Not bad for a country with a terrible image around the world. 

 
&gt;Not only does France spends enormous amounts of money, but a large part of it is wasted on an outdated, super-heavy administration, with multiple useless layers, such as those on the departmental scale, instead of being focused on healthcare or education, and even when it's spent where it should, it's so mismanaged it ends up being wasted anyway

The money France spends is money for *public services*. Public services are here for the people, to help them, to create good conditions of living. Spending big amounts of money is not a problem in itself. It becomes a problem when you can't afford it, i.e when there is too much deficit. Thing is, we could afford it. Holland cuts into public services so he can save 60 billions euros, roughly. If he wants 60 billions euros, there are other methods than slashing much needed public budgets. Tax fraud only is [60 to 80 billions euros](http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/economie/20130521.OBS0016/combien-coutent-l-evasion-et-la-fraude-fiscales.html).

Murder where a shockingly low number of dead bodies are even properly medically examined even if there are quite clear signs of violence from a second party.

&gt; Some heroin dealers mix fentanyl powder with heroin to increase potency or compensate for low-quality heroin.

With about 30% of the vote counted, the pro-Russian Socialist Party was in the lead with about 23%, election officials said.
 
&gt; Ahead of the vote, analysts said poll ratings of the Socialists, who want Moldova to turn its back on the EU and join a Russia-dominated economic bloc, had been boosted by its populist campaigning, including concerts by Russian pop stars.

&gt; The main opposition party - the Communist Party - was running a close second with 20%. The party is a Soviet-era survivor that still uses the hammer and sickle as its symbol.

&gt; Pro-Moscow forces were also expected to pick additional votes after the ban of the Fatherland party. It was barred from the elections on the grounds that it had illegally received foreign funding. The party - whose leader has fled to Russia - denies the claim.

well obviously.

I admit I do not know much about them.

and I bash Russia because it is the immediate threat to me, my family, my country. not US or Israel. do you understand where I am coming from? would you feel differently in my situation?

&gt;Oh wait... you aren't even bashing Russia. You bash the USSR. A nation that doesn't even fucking exist any longer.

no, I bash Russia. leave the fucking USSR alone, the place it belongs -in the history trashcan, just besides the Nazi Germany. 

&gt;The US did significantly worse things than Russia over the last decades. Israel is doing the exact same shit in Palestine that Russia is doing in Crimea. In fact, Israel is by far worse than Russia in that regard and all major human rights groups agree with that simple fact

This is about you not caring about reality because all you care about is how well off you are. You are scared of Russia and don't care about what needs to be done to stop what you consider your enemy.


&gt;how do you know it is only tip of the iceberg if you don't know what exactly more US has done? maybe it's 99% there is?


Because we know for a fact that the US is covering up most of its crimes. What we know are only the things the US can't cover up.


&gt;maybe it's 99% there is?

Maybe everything you believe about Russia is a lie?

&gt;and yet, you are just repeating same thing over and over again. can you deliver OP?

What else would I need to say? I have already proven my point and I'm most definitely less biased than you.

I stick to the facts. Russia isn't a direct threat to me, neither is the US. Both are major trade partners of my country and we have amicable relations with both.

I simply acknowledge the fact that the US is a far bigger criminal than Russia and far more destructive and dangerous. In literally every fucking regard except for the spread of religious bigotry (which I believe is a self-containing disease and can easily be eradicated with higher standards of living and education).",0,1417396756,null,0,false,0,cmhgzfw,t3_2nu3pi,t1_cmhgzfw,t1_cmhgkyp,null,1425747578,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

This is why I don't understand why Europeans get so butthurt when Americans claim heritage from where their family immigrated from. Of course we aren't claiming to be from Ireland, we are claiming that our grandparents came from there and handed down traditions and stories from there.

&gt; Last winter, for example, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dimitry Rogozin ominously told Moldovans, “I hope you don’t freeze,” a reference to the nation’s complete dependence on Russian natural gas for heating.

Yes, and so Moldova and Romania have built a gas pipeline. [Although apparently they didn't reach a deal yet.](http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/romania-moldova-gas-pipeline-still-not-operational) [They did get a lower price from Russia in renegotiations though.](http://en.itar-tass.com/economy/759140)

This subproblem is emblematic of the overall Moldovan approach, which as usual has been thoughtful and balanced. Moldova is strengthening its ties with Europe, in particular Romania of course, while working not to antagonize Russia, despite its over-sensitive nature.

And the elections today/yesterday (depending on your timezone) have apparently confirmed a pro-EU coalition, and yet with strong representation by Socialists and Communists, the former which have close ties to Putin, and the latter which actually don't.

Moldova is slowly and methodically escaping Putin's grasp, while remaining in a position to keep its close ties with Russia (a very large percentage of adult Moldovans are working abroad in Russia, along with the economic ties of import and export as well). Its future, I hope and expect, is as a bridge between the East and the West, an Eastern European Switzerland, sharing its neutrality but with tasty wine in place of tasty chocolate.

This is an excellent article though. It points out at least the surface of Russian machinations, which are in fact quite deep and truly regional. In Moldova, for instance, there has been evidence as reported in this subreddit of extremists being armed for possible action after these elections.

This is the time for the European Union to stand together strongly, and to invite in the friendly nations who will otherwise be inevitably taken by Russia. Moldova will apply for membership to the EU next year, in hopes of becoming a candidate nation by 2017. I hope that Europe will not turn its back on Moldova and force it to ultimately become a Russian puppet like Transnistria already is. The fate of not only millions of Moldovans depends upon this support, but also the security of Romania and the rest of the European Union, as well as access to tasty wine.",0,1417397330,null,0,false,0,cmhh993,t3_2nw8ch,t1_cmhh993,t3_2nw8ch,null,1425747451,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

false,WorldLeader,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; WW2: The country was ruined after the first war, and was so much in debt that the condition was right for a dictator to emerge with promises of salvation. The desperation was total with hyper-inflation and loss of hope for the future.

You know, for being a European you are woefully misinformed about your own history. First off, nearly none of the fighting from WWI occurred in traditional German territory. The Western Front was almost all in France and Belgium, and the armistice was signed prior to a full invasion of Germany. As a result, the economic and manufacturing regions of Germany were left untouched and they were ready to continue producing. For this reason, many Germans this led to a feeling of anger and resentment when they were forced to pay huge reparations by the French because they weren't truly ""defeated"". 

Second, the Weimar Republic didn't start off in debt, and while there was a period of super high inflation in the early 1920s, the currency was revalued and the inflation was under control by late 1923, a decade before Hitler was in power. While Germans certainly remember the episode well, it's not a clear cause and effect. 

Third, mainly France alone wanted to punish Germany with the huge reparations - Britain and specifically Keynes argued instead that the bill should not be nearly as high so that the German economy could function and therefore pay back the reparations and rebuild.

When that Allies broke through into Germany in WWII, General Eisenhower knew that they needed total defeat first, to crush the entire German nation and specifically the Nazi party, and then afterwards show humanity and rebuild the nation via the billions of dollars of aid (Marshall Plan). This proved to be a much more successful formula.

&gt;I never said the US has done worse than the USSR (although genocide and slavery most definitely are pretty bad, we can see this through and compare the nations by their worst deeds if you like).

do you think Russian nation exist only for 25 years? do you think atrocities done by Soviet regime cannot be attributed to Russians?

anyway, we are getting derailed here. 

once again: if we want to compare current political systems, we have to take last 25 years from both sides.

if we want to compare nations by their worst deeds then we have to acknowledge genocide done by Soviets (and Soviets were by far margin mostly Russians), behaviour of Tsarist regime, etc., then we can talk about US genocide of Native Americans, slavery and stuff like that. it just seems to me that you want to compare last 25 years of Russia's history vs everything US have ever done since Columbus discovered that bloody continent. 

&gt;I said the US had done worse than Russia.

so which is it? are you claiming US has done worse in past 25 years or not? yes or no, and then we can go somewhere from there.

&gt;I also don't care about people who lived in the the past. I care about people who live now and in the future. 

it is said one has to know the history to have the future. 

&gt;no, Germany does not pose any imperialistic threat.
&gt;Neither does Russia.

well, I disagree. actually, I know full-well it does, I know how, I know why, I know how much of a threat it is. compared to you, who doesn't know nothing about Russia and its mentality. that's where our conversation started. you knowing nothing about Russian media started claiming it is not as bad as the American one.

&gt;So you are a US sympathizer.

I'm realist. and obviously my own well-being is far more important to me than someone's in Pakistan. is your well-being equally important to you as someone's in Pakistan?

&gt;Maybe everything you believe about Russia is a lie?

maybe. We could all be in a turtle's dream, in outer space! 

&gt;What else would I need to say? I have already proven my point and I'm most definitely less biased than you.

you proved nothing. I just admitted I am biased, you didn't. you just say you are less biased. well, anyway, let's assume that you are indeed less biased. you did not win the argument either way. someone having or not having a bias is not winning an argument. do you follow me? cause sometimes it really seems I'm talking to 14 yo. btw you didn't answer my question how old are you.

&gt;I stick to the facts. 

can you provide these facts? can you provide anything? facts, sources, links, anything? everything you do now is just repeating yourself. do you see that? ""US is evil, US is worst, Russia is not imperialistic, Israel is bad"". that's all you do. do you think the one who says it the most wins or something?

&gt;Russia isn't a direct threat to me, neither is the US. Both are major trade partners of my country and we have amicable relations with both.
I simply acknowledge the fact that the US is a far bigger criminal than Russia and far more destructive and dangerous.

Les congrès, c'est comme le nouvel an ou la fête de la musique. Tu crois toujours qu'il va se passer quelque chose, mais en fait il y a trop de monde et c'est nul.

&gt;au passage, tu nous donnerais ton avis d'expert sur les résultats de l’élection du comité central? ca m’intéresse

Alors il y avait deux lignes au FN : la ligne Philippot (au niveau économique elle est étatiste, et au niveau sociétal elle est pour une réconciliation nationale et une certaine ouverture sur l'islam, principalement dans le but de nouer des alliances avec d'autres partis et d'avoir une capacité de gouverner avec une potentielle majorité au parlement) et la ligne Aliot (plus libérale, clairement de droite, et viscéralement anti-islam, voulant une alliance, impossible selon moi, avec la droite de l'UMP).

Les résultats de l'élection montrent avant tout un renouvellement de génération, avec la disparition complète des vieux proches de Gollnisch etc.

Ensuite, c'est clairement la ligne identitaire / Aliot qui a gagné contre la ligne Philippot. Le compromis sera donc étatisme identitaire. 

C'est bien dommage mais c'est logique vu les derniers mois avec Daech et la forte médiatisation des thèses anti-islam (Chauprade ou Zemmour). Il y a un an on parlait encore de supprimer tout objectif chiffré d'immigration (dans le programme de 2012 c'était 10 000 par an, j'ai personnellement convaincu pas mal de cadres sur la suppression ce point), il est évident que cette idée n'est plus d'actualité.

Bref, c'est une stratégie de l'échec sur le plan politique (la capacité à gouverner) à mon avis, vu que ce sujet ferme la porte à toute union des souverainismes. Par contre, ça ouvre la porte à beaucoup de déçus de l'UMP sur la question de l'immigration, en particulier ceux qui ne peuvent pas saquer la mollesse de Juppé.

Bref, on fera peut-être un meilleur score en 2017, mais le FN restera un parti d'éternelle opposition en cavalier seul tant qu'il ne s'ouvrira pas aux autres partis.",0,1417398796,null,0,false,0,cmhhykg,t3_2nvgz0,t1_cmhhykg,t1_cmhhdkq,null,1425747124,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

The idea of *Lebensraum* was part of a far right ideology that was older than Hitler, but never embraced by many people before. 

There were other arguments for expansion, most notably the fact that Germany was a country surrounded by strong, imperialistic countries. *Fear* was a driving force behind Germany's expansion plans. Otto von Bismarck was quoted on this on multible occasions, for example at his worst about the polish minority:

Well for one thing the country is in a massive amount of debt because it's supporting a huge population of old people without enough young working people paying taxes. This leads to higher taxes on those who are working which stifles consumption. Japan actually has a very low unemployment rate, and yet nobody has any money, and this is a pretty big reason for that.

What's more, the agriculture industry is slowly dying because most Japanese people don't want to do physical labour outside. The average farmer is like 65 years old. There's a serious labour shortage on the *very* near horizon in agriculture.

false,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"We don't necessarily love her, but we *don't not* like her. What's not to like about here? What *is* there, at all?

I never voted for her party, and I don't always agree with her politics, but I do believe she's a good chancellor, personality wise. There's not much of an ego that could get in the way of finding a compromise, and she actually thinks before she speaks, which is a rare quality. Sometimes she thinks for too long, but that's better than the reverse.  
You have to look at her in contrast to her predecessors (I personally remember Kohl and Schröder, which already takes us back all the way to 1982) and the opposition candidates (although I still maintain that Steinmeier would have made a good chancellor). Blandness can be a good thing.

Also, we don't vote for chancellors directly, but for parties. Yes, I know, *technically* the US doesn't elect the president directly, either, but it's still very different. This helps her in several ways.  
First of all, there's no term limit, and there's the same habitual rule of letting the sitting head of government run for another term unless s/he's compete shit as there is in other countries. She has also purged her party of potential internal competitors, something she has learned from Kohl (whom she brought down).  
The opposition, which in this case means the SPD, lacks viable candidates and is simply too weak. Their Agenda 2010 reforms were seen as treason by the political left, which is how Merkel won against Schröder. Those reforms also worked so well that Merkel presided (chancellored?) over a time of rapidly falling unemployment and economic growth during her first term, which is how she won against Steinmeier.

To the right of Merkel's CDU/CSU are only crazies (AfD, and they're a recent phenomenon) and neonazis, while Germany's left is fractured between the SPD, the Greens and the Left (capital ""L"", successor of the successor of the GDR's state party, and an actual political force in the East). Merkel has taken her party to dead center, which puts the SPD in an awkward position -- no credibility (or voters) on their party's left wing, and indistinguishable from the CDU on their right.  
In a ""grand coalition"" between SPD and CDU/CSU (what we have now) the SPD will always be the junior partner. Their way of dealing with it now seems to be to try a coalition with the Greens *and* the Left, which they just did in a state, helping the Left to their first minister president (""governor""). This isn't ideal, either, because is pisses off people like me who don't want the Left in government, period.  

CDU/CSU also has other options than the SPD as a coalition partner, even after the self-destruction of the FDP.

---
HE HAD annexed Crimea and sent his forces into eastern Ukraine, but the moment when Angela Merkel finally became convinced that there could be no reconciliation with Vladimir Putin was when she was treated to his hardline views on gay rights.

The German chancellor was deep in one of the 40 conversations she has had with the Russian president over the past year — more than the combined total with David Cameron, Francois Hollande and Barack Obama — when he began to rail against the “decadence” of the West.
Nothing exemplified this “decay of values” more than the West’s promotion of gay rights, Mr Putin told her.

It was then, said sources close to Ms Merkel, that she realised Europe and America should abandon all hope of finding a common language with the Kremlin and instead should adopt a policy of Cold War-style containment.
“The chancellor has come to believe that Putin is driven by an ultra-conservative mindset that is shared by his inner circle and is based on a belief that Russia’s values are superior and irreconcilable to those of the West,” said a source.

Ms Merkel understood that “there will be no deals with Putin, unless they are on his own terms, and that is neither acceptable nor possible”.
Since the eruption of the crisis over Ukraine at the end of last year, Mrs Merkel has played an increasingly pivotal role in Europe’s — and the West’s — policy towards the Kremlin, coming to act as chief negotiator with Russia’s leader.

Initially she had adopted a conciliatory stance, dictated in part by the $135 million a year in trade between Germany and Russia. She also had to take account of the pro-Moscow stance followed by her coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD).
Under the party’s former leaders Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt, the SPD had normalised relations with the then Soviet Union in the 1970s in a policy known as Ostpolitik.

Gerhard Schroder, SPD chancellor from 1998 to 2005, went further: since leaving office he has worked as a paid lobbyist for a company linked to the Kremlin, even celebrating his 70th birthday with Putin in St Petersburg in April.
As Mr Putin escalated the situation in Ukraine, however, and repeatedly told Mrs Merkel “blatant untruths” about his intentions, her policy towards Russia has hardened.

Mrs Merkel has now become the toughest proponent of a new containment strategy and believes the West must be “mentally prepared” for another escalation that would lead to even harsher sanctions.
After confronting the Putinversteher (Putin apologists) in her coalition and in German industry, Mrs Merkel is now working to build a united European Union front against Kremlin aggression.

“Changing borders by force in Europe today is unacceptable: Putin needs to be made to pay for what he has done and the price will have to be high,” said a source familiar with Mrs Merkel’s strategy.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, her SPD foreign minister, was accused of drifting from Mrs Merkel’s tough line and running a “parallel foreign policy” after a recent meeting with Mr Putin in Moscow, but a Merkel aide insisted there was “total consensus” between them.

Squaring some of her fellow EU members could prove more difficult for Mrs Merkel: several governments oppose further sanctions for fear they will damage their own economies, including Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria, all of which have close financial and business ties to Russia.
While Germany’s economic and political might may eventually prevail in bringing them into line, Mrs Merkel faces a still bigger challenge from Rome.

Italy obtains 30 per cent of its gas from Russia and the two countries have dozens of trade and investment agreements. Matteo Renzi, the prime minister, is thought to be sceptical about the effectiveness of sanctions — even if he does not enjoy the same close personal relationship with Mr Putin as Silvio Berlusconi, the disgraced former leader.
Sources close to the Italian government said that the crisis could have been averted if Moscow’s “legitimate” national and security interests had been taken into account — in particular its virulent opposition to Ukraine joining NATO.

Mrs Merkel’s own personal history informs her dealings with Mr Putin. Now aged 60, she grew up in the communist former East Germany and speaks Russian. In her youth she travelled across the vast Soviet empire and, according to people who know her well, has a deep understanding and appreciation of Russian culture.
Mr Putin, 62, who served as a KGB officer in Dresden, is a fluent German speaker and also knows the country well.

According to people who have witnessed their encounters, the dealings of the two leaders have never been cordial, but the relationship between them has become “very familiar” during the nine years since Mrs Merkel became chancellor.
Mr Putin, they say, respects his German counterpart’s “power and success” and understanding of his country. For Mrs Merkel’s part, she is the only leader who has always been able to challenge Putin openly.

In 2012 she told him during a televised event in Moscow that it had been wrong to imprison members of Pussy Riot, the iconoclastic punk protest group, and that such a prosecution would never have taken place in Germany.
Behind closed doors, sources claim, the tone of their exchanges becomes even “harsher”. A source said: “The only thing he understands and respects is the language of strength.”

Mr Putin has attempted to humiliate Mrs Merkel on several occasions. At a meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi in 2007, he allowed his black labrador Koni into the room in the presence of journalists, knowing she is afraid of dogs.
Mrs Merkel remained composed, however, and later told German reporters that the Russian leader had to do such things to “prove he is a man”.

Last month Mr Putin made her wait for hours for a scheduled meeting in Milan. Unfazed, she spent the time instead having a leisurely stroll through the city.
Mrs Merkel, say aides, has never been intimidated by the Kremlin strongman and journalists recall her amusing impersonations of Mr Putin’s macho posturing.

Since her exposure to the Kremlin leader’s views on the decadence of the West, Mrs Merkel has continued to meet Mr Putin — spending several hours with him at this month’s G20 in Brisbane — but she has also pressed ahead with building the coalition against him.
As was the case during the euro crisis, aides say Mrs Merkel believes that Germany has no alternative but to play a leading role.

“Cameron is beleaguered at home, Hollande is the weakest French president in history and Obama is a lame duck,” said Joerg Forbrig of the German Marshall Fund think tank.
“The German chancellor is the only undisputed leader with the legitimacy to take the lead in dealing with Russia, which is becoming a threat to Europe.”

I guess it could be. That was Snowden when he was a commenter at Ars Technica. It's taken out of context a bit:

&gt; “Sure you do,” he replied. “I went to London just last year … It's where all of your Muslims live … I didn't want to get out of the car. I thought I had gotten off of plane in the wrong country.”

&gt; Snowden said the experience was “terrifying,” adding the Muslims “just seemed awfully … orthodox.”

&gt; “I mean it wasn't like, ‘Hi, we're your friendly neighborhood Muslim community. welcome to our main street,” he wrote. “It was more like, ‘SUBMIT TO THE WILL OF ALLAH. SHARIAH REGULATIONS POSTED AT ALL CORNERS.’”

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/06/27/snowden-thought-leakers-should-be-shot-in-200-chat-logs-reveal/

I've been to some of those neighborhoods in London and they are rough. If you look at demographics, there's hardly anything like that in the U.S., save for Dearborn, MI.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dearborn,_Michigan

Yeah, we have fundamentalists, jihadists, Al Qaeda supporters, radicals and pro-Islamic State groups in the Netherlands too. Have a look, this is the Hague:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2aGWDe4i5Q

I've seen similar images from Luton my buddy from London showed me. So Snowden's view isn't totally without merit. When I were to look at all the things you've ever posted online, I'd probably find something controversial somewhere sometime too. This is also something Snowden said:

&gt; By April of that year, a few months into his appointment in Switzerland, Snowden reported to the chatroom about his time in the country, saying it was like “living in a postcard” and that prostitution was legal.

&gt; “It's just nightmarishly expensive and horrifically classist,” Snowden continued, according to chat logs. “I have never, EVER seen a people more racist than the Swiss. Jesus god they look down on EVERYONE. Even each other.”

Snowden also said that leakers should be shot in the balls:

&gt; “Moreover, who the [expletive] are the anonymous sources telling them this?” Snowden continued. “Those people should be shot in the balls.”

&gt; The messages by Snowden, who was 25 at the time and reportedly stationed in Geneva by the Central Intelligence Agency, are in sharp contrast to his more recent views regarding executive secrecy, which he claims prompted him to go public with the federal government's snooping tactics.

&gt; “I wonder how many hundreds of millions of dollars they just completely blew,” he continued, in reference to The New York Times. “It's not an overreaction. They have a HISTORY of this [expletive].”

&gt; But the logs of the Internet Relayed Chat (IRC) server associated with Ars Technica don't necessarily show a 180-degree shift in Snowden's worldview, according to an article that accompanied release of the logs.

&gt; “It's hardly a perfect parallel,” Ars Technica wrote in the article. “Snowden was upset about leaks over U.S. covert operations in Iran, which is different from the domestic spying and offensive cyberwar programs he felt compelled to make public.”

This:

Because I already covered this above. You apparently refuse to acknowledge the difference and continue to pimp a false equivalency between the EU and the U.S.

The ""everybody spies"" excuse is old, tired and debunked. It emerged in the context of the diplomatic spat between Germany and the U.S. due to the Snowden leaks.

The U.S. predominantly, but also Britain, go way, way, way too far with their activities.

This also means the victimization of U.S. citizens. The driving force behind all this is the NSA, not Germany or the EU. Germany is both a partner and a target.

The sooner you understand this and stop pimping the ""everybody spies"" false equivalency excuse, the better. It is the NSA which is the alpha dog, the NSA which pioneered the ""collect it all"" philosophy and the NSA which then imposed their mission on their partners after 9/11.

&gt; The sources said that while the US, Russia, China, Britain and France are well-known to engage in aggressive cyber espionage, including against allies, **many other countries do not have anywhere near the same surveillance infrastructure – and concentrate their more limited resources on counter-terrorism and serious crime.**

Sad part is i think the idea isn't entirely wrong about having a job program : They could easily offer them more usefull jobs to replace those i think. There's no shortage of need for workers for everything and if the state is willing to pay them and them to work it could do something good. Maybe they could restart some form of subsidized industry locally or offer them posts as volunteer abroad; retrain them to do more usefull jobs (people are generally willing if you keep paying them while they train); etc.

Ciò significa che, negli ultimi anni, la contribuzione alle confessioni religiose ha superato i due terzi delle risorse destinate per la conservazione del patrimonio artistico del paese».

Maddai? Peccato che il patrimonio artistico, in questo paese, è quasi esclusivamente composto di chiese.

| Tanta generosità nei confronti della religione è un unicum in tutta Europa. «In alcuni paesi, come Francia, Irlanda e Regno Unito», spiegano i magistrati, «le confessioni religiose non fruiscono di contributi pubblici e devono ricorrere esclusivamente all'autofinanziamento. In Germania le confessioni ricevono proventi di una tassazione aggiuntiva a carico dei contribuenti».

Maddai? E ci sono altri paesi in europa dove la chiesa attrae _MILIONI_ di turisti l' anno? Turisti che vi ricordo sono l' unica risorsa rimanente che ancora non abbiamo venduto a cinesi o americani.

Overall crime rate is a bit of a difficult statistic, so if it's alright with you, let's look at the [world's countries by homicide rate.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#UNODC.27s_global_study) The next lowest country after Japan is Singapore, whose population is 23% foreign born. Closely following Japan is Kuwait (population is over 40% immigrants), Indonesia (over 300 distinct ethnic groups), and Sweden (~27% of population is not ethnically Swedish). 

Then on the opposite side of the spectrum we have Lesotho, which is 99.7% ethnically Basotho (that's more homogeneous than Japan, if you're keeping score) and has one of the highest murder rates in the world. 

It seems to me you're ascribing Japan's low crime rate to a certain aspect of its culture - namely, its focus on harmony, conformity, and group cohesion. Which is probably true. But I don't know where you get the idea that foreigners will be unable to comprehend that (it's really not that hard), or the idea that an influx of foreigners will cause Japanese society to fall apart, or the idea that this trait of Japan's is related to its homogeneity.

&gt;Not unique to Japan. Sorry, I am European. I rather pay ""through the nose"" for my social security, guarantee or not, than having North American conditions. The Japanese seem to think likewise.

Europe has immigrants to offset the aging population. Immigrants work and pay into social security. In Japan, the number of people paying into social security is rapidly decreasing, while the number of people drawing on social security is rapidly increasing. They accept very few immigrants, so there are relatively fewer taxpayers than there otherwise would be, so the problem is much worse than it needs to be. This is a summary of what I wrote in my first post, and you've somehow avoided addressing it entirely, by saying that Japanese people are richer than Africans so there's no problem or something.

Let me say that one more time because obviously your reading comprehension isn't too good. *My problem is not with social security.

If you look at your crime rate examples, it is noteworthy that the top countries are those with draconian measures for non-conformity - Singapore and Kuwait being the best examples. If you can force conformity, the immigrant percentage doesn't play a role. Sweden is an example where you can also argue the other way round. The problems they have with their immigrant areas might support my argument, even if the numbers still reflect a Sweden from the past.

But Sweden is very close to Japan in the groupthink issue. The society is based very much on cooperative values. It should be interesting to look at Sweden as a foreshadowing for Japan with more immigrants.

Your last paragraph sums up my sentiment very good. I am in tune with the Japanese majority there, even if you say that there is no need to worry. I don't see the foreign population in Sweden pick up the cooperative values as much as needed, for example.

Very cooperative societies are vulnerable against exploitation. This is my main point here. It's not that immigrants couldn't do it - but do they want to?

It probably helped saved millions of Soviet lives by hastening the war's end and diverting German resources West, not to mention prevented the Iron Curtain from extending all the way to the English Channel. Without it, I doubt the EU would exist as we know it today, that Western Europe in general would exist as we know it today or that the Soviet Union would've even collapsed. Instead I can quite honestly see the present situation being replaced by Soviet Republics &amp; satellite states. You only need to compare Eastern Europe to Western Europe, or hell, Eastern Germany to Western Germany to see what the result of that would've been. 

And let's not forget Lend-Lease; it provided the vast majority of the Soviets railcars so those absolutely huge offensives could actually be supplied and managed, not to mention it provided other critical equipment, most importantly trucks, but also tanks &amp; other weapons in the early part of the war when the factories beyond the Urals hadn't fully started chugging out equipment &amp; the war looked like it could still pivot any which way.

&gt; 'Bei vergleichbarer Erzeugung elektrischer Energie geben Steinkohlekraftwerke mehr radioaktive Stoffe an die Umwelt ab, als Kernkraftwerke bei störungsfreiem Betrieb, so Prof. Dr. Claus Grupen. Es würde wohl einen Sturm der Entrüstung auslösen, wenn die permanent von Kohlekraftwerken ausgehende Niedrigstrahlung von kerntechnischen Anlagen ausginge, so der Siegener Wissenschaftler. Auch der Chemiker Prof. Dr. Günter Henze bestätigt, dass die radioaktiven Emissionen von Kohlekraftwerken um ein bis zwei Größenordnungen größer seien als die von Atomkraftwerken.

That is not very surprising in a country of immigrants. Anything else would mean the only ""true Americans"" were native Americans which is harly a stance I'd expect many Americans to take.

For the very same reason.

Here's the video that shows how aggressive Russian fighters are off the coast of northern Norway.

The video is filmed from the cockpit of a Norwegian F-16 aircraft, and is taken up in international airspace last year.

It shows how a Russian MIG-31 fighters suddenly folds into front of one of the Norwegian F-16 aircraft from 331 Squadron.

The spontaneous reaction from the Norwegian pilot says it all about the drama:

""In hell!"" He exclaims - before he pivots plane left in a tight evasive maneuver.

- We have seen some cases of behavior in the air from the Russians to show that they did not like that we are there, says Lieutenant Colonel Goran Hoel, commander of 331 Squadron in Bodø, TV 2, which first publicized the video.

- Closer than 20 meters
To VG estimates Hoel that the Russian MIG aircraft were ""less than 20 meters"" from the Norwegian F-16 machine.

- This is an example of how fast it goes when you're sitting in the cockpit of a fighter plane, and that we must be prepared for anything. This is something that can happen and that could potentially be dangerous, says Hoel VG.

- Why did the Russian pilot this?

- We do not know. We know that Norwegian Orion aircraft has had some challenges with that Russian planes have come very close. Whether this is a deliberate act, or he miscalculated total, and had control, says squadron leader.

Three important developments

Norwegian F-16 aircraft from 331- and 332 Squadron stands on days readiness for NATO in Bodo. So far this year, the Norwegian planes come out 42 times to show strength against Russian fighters. That's about as previous years.

But several sources pointing to VG in three important developments:

** The Russian planes are becoming newer and more sophisticated.

- There is a replacement and renewal of Russian assets and capabilities in all areas, both on land, at sea and in the air. This is a clear example, says Brynjar Stordalselva, pressevakt of Defense operational headquarters (FOH), VG.

** The number of Russian planes that fly together increases.

- We see that the flights are more complex than before. Now we often meet reconnaissance tanker, tactical bombers and eskortefly together increasingly. It did not happen as often before, says Hoel.

** And as the video top of this article is an example: The Russian pilots are more aggressive and aggressive than before, according to several sources.

- General meetings with the Russians disposition and quiet. But we've had some episodes, like the one in the video, says Hoel.

Many Doubled in Europe
Although the Russian air traffic off the Norwegian coast is stable, it is not so in the rest of Europe.

If one collects all NATO figures as a whole, the number of so-called ""scrambles"" - that NATO planes must scramble to intercept Russian fighters - many doubled during the year.

Earlier in the month let the London-based think tank European Leadership Network presented a report showing how the Russian Armed Forces acting far more aggressively this year compared with previous years.

The report lists 40 serious incidents, many of them in the Norwegian vicinity. Among the events are submarine hunt in the Swedish archipelago, and the dramatic minutes when a Russian patrol was only 90 meters from a SAS aircraft of Malmo, on the way from Copenhagen to Rome.

Also Russian planes along the Norwegian coast is mentioned in the report.

New aircraft along the Norwegian coast
&lt;p&gt; NEW RUSSIAN: This was the sight that met the Norwegian pilots off the coast of Finnmark in late October: Brand new SU-34 Fullback fighter, the very latest and most advanced weapon in the Russian Air Force. &lt;/ p&gt;

As VG wrote in November, the new SU-34 Fullback aircraft for the first time observed off the Norwegian coast in late October.

- The aircraft have been observed and identified by other NATO countries elsewhere earlier. But we have never seen them in the northern areas and off the coast of Norway before, says Stordalselva VG.

The highly advanced fighter bombers are the latest in the increasingly robust Russian air force, and is built to carry nuclear weapons.

L'arrogance, le mépris de la France et des gens qui y restent, un esprit toujours vachement fermé (illustré par le fait que tous ces types te disent TOUJOURS la même chose, c'est marrant d'avoir le discours sur l'ouverture à une culture pour au final entendre toujours les mêmes choses)...

Sincèrement, c'est un des trucs qui m'a refroidi à l'idée de travailler à l'international. J'ai pas envie de devenir comme ces gens là.

Edit : j'ai lu l'article. Et j'aime bien le coup du choc culturel inversé, avec l'argument du mec ouvert aux cultures qui a lutté pour son intégration et qui a du mal à revenir.

What basics of economic forecasting? Please be explicit. I didn't know there was a trick that guaranteed predictions like this will come true.

&gt; Terrible analogy, don't compare personal finances to finances of a country unless you are a complete idiot, just for future reference. 

That depends on the context. My point was simple: Any organisation can have a primary surplus by reducing expenditures enough. It is not, in itself, a sign of economic prowess. 

&gt; I don't care about ""Great leader"" Samaras, I don't care who leads the country as long as they keep bringing in foreign investment deals. If Tsipras could make a single economic plan that wasn't built on dreams I would like him . .but he is just your standard socialist commie with big dreams and absolutely no touch in reality. 

You missed my point. My point was not ""Samaras evil right-wing, Tsipras good left-wing"". My point is that politicians always say ""things are very bad right now but good things are just around the corner"". It's an easy way to pacify idiots, because idiots don't have the memory span necessary to remember all the times they have been promised ""good things are just around the corner"" that were never delivered. 

&gt; The Great Depression pretty much officially ended this week with the 3rd quarter report and 2015 forecasting. IT will take at least another 5-10 years to see a huge change. Like I have told you multiple times, I don't think there will be a visible change until around 2020 when all the pieces come together. 

There is no economist that would be able to make predictions about the state of an economy five years in the future with such certainty. But I guess you have your ""sources"". I wonder what you will think in 2020 if nothing changes. Will you move the goalpost to 2025 or what? 

All in all: quit living in fantasy land and join reality with the rest of us. No matter how many times you post about these gas deals and idealise them, they will never become the panacea that your wishful thinking demands.

In other words: they react pragmatically to a less than ideal situation, because reacting in a more 'principled' manner would make the situation only worse.

super heroes are not a typical subject of german comics. you find more so called ""graphic novels"", e. g. look for [matthias gnehm, ""die kopierte stadt""](http://www.hochparterre.ch/nachrichten/hochparterre/blog/post/detail/die-kopierte-stadt/1395743057/) (ok, that's a swiss comic, not a german one) or funnies like /u/cs_tiger mentioned one. walter moers is great, but he made mostly strips. if you look for more story-based funnies have a look at ralf könig (be warned, he's gay and his comics are about gays and often nsfw), lewis trondheim's ""herr hase"" (he's french, but the german translations are very nice) or a more weird, not so funny one you might like: guido sieber ""engels letzter fall"" (not suitable for strict christians)

false,CharginTarge,LIMB,Limburg (NL),"&gt; For me it wasn't a waste of time. Latin and Greek taught me a lot about language, analytical skills and understanding of texts. This is useful while learning other languages. With French and Latin, I could read Italian or Spanish.

True, but how many people go on to learn a third foreign language (or fourth in case of both Latin and Greek are taught)? And how many of those choose Italian or Spanish such that this skill becomes useful? Not a lot I recon. Plus, I recon that knowing any related language would help you lean Italian or Spanish, not just Latin. 

It seems kind of backwards that we have to teach a skill to 1000 students that is useless for 999 of them and only marginally beneficial to 1. Makes more sense to me to teach those 999 something more useful and have that 1 guy go to university if he really needs that skill.

&gt; I tend to believe Latin and Greek taught me more than just a language. To be honest, the basic high-school German or French taught me just that language, and I can't speak it at all anymore.

So, you're saying that all your Latin and Greek skills didn't help you at all to retain your skill in the languages you already knew? Wouldn't it have been better to have invested your time in such a way that you can speak German and French properly instead thinning your time out so that you can speak German, French, Italian and Spanish poorly?

Forgetting a language has more to do with the time spent learning it and your average level of exposure than whether or not you know Latin or Greek. I had 4 years of high school French and now I'm barely able to give directions every time some poor Walloonian crosses the border and gets lost.

Sorry to come across so negative, but this discussion is symptomatic of what I think to be a bigger problem of the general education system. Lots of content of the last 2, maybe 3, years of high school is targeted at people who want to make a career out of the subject matter, forcing most of the students to learn something that is not catered to them. Latin and Greek are the odd ones out since they require more time to acquire a basic understanding of. Does the majority of students need to know advanced Calculus? No. The details of specific chemical reactions? No. Music theory? No. The brown coal topology of South America? God no. But the few that want to make a career out of it do, and hence it is taught. 

Don't get me wrong, students do need a general education such they can become well rounded people (plus it helps them decide what they might want to do in life), it's just that I think that the school curriculum goes way beyond what I'd deem as general knowledge. Teaching widely spoken languages as part of general knowledge makes sense, since these skills are often handy. Latin and Ancient Greek on the other hand, not so much.

&gt;The impact differs among Member States: (1) In Ireland, continental Portugal, Latvia, Slovenia and Bulgaria, sugar beet production has disappeared totally; (2) In Italy, Spain, Greece, Slovakia,
Hungary, Finland, Lithuania and Denmark, production decreased dramatically (between 35% and 75%). And in the remaining States, mostly (but not exclusively) located in the “beet belt”, production
has decreased moderately (Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Sweden) or even increased (France, Austria and Romania). [...]


&gt;The changes in quantities led to further geographical concentration of sugar beet production in the “beet belt”, **where pedo-climatic conditions are the best suited for growing beets**, while
significant drop in beet quantities occurred mainly in
Italy and Spain : the share of France, Germany,
the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Austria, Belg
ium, the Netherlands and Poland in the EU-27
quantities increased from 74% in 2005 to 86% in 2010.[...]

&gt; in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and
Italy, farmers who have continued to produce sugar
beet have on average higher yields than those who
have stopped.

Honestly, why is the the EU's fault that beets grow better in the damp north? There still is significant sugar production in Italy anyway.

&gt;These changes have also modified the geographical distribution within the EU, with the
appearance of refining structures in Member States, where the refining activity was non-
existent prior to the reform (e.g. Denmark, Italy and Spain) [...]

&gt;Member States located in the sugar belt (F
rance, Germany, the United Kingdom, the
Netherlands, Poland, Belgium, etc.), account
ed for more than 40% of the decrease in the
EU. 

&gt;For example, 240 companies in France received CAP support, at
least 140 in Germany, 44 in the United Kingdom, and around 500 in Italy. 


It seems it wasn't all bad for Italy, nor bad for Italy only.

&gt;Among the six case study Member States, only It
aly used the possibility included in the
Council regulation to impose further requiremen
ts on the undertakings and compelled them
to present a conversion plan for closed factor
ies as well as for redevelopment projects for
alternative economic activities in regions impact
ed by the restructuring. This is intended to
create 777 jobs when fully implemented. [...]

&gt;At the company level, with the exception of Italy, companies received the restructuring aid subject only to the obligation of presenting a social plan 214 to the authorities and to complying with their respective national labour market legislations. [...]

&gt;The choice made by the management authorities in mo
st Member States, except Italy, to restructure
the sector on a voluntary basis was highly relevant with regard to the objective of improved
competitiveness

Well, it seems that the additional requirements (closing and destroying refineries) you cite were **imposed by the Italian government**. So it seems that we have a typical case of national governments scapegoating the EU.

For instance, in Italy there are many romanians and albanese. I don't see a problem with them coming here, trying a better life and such (see, I'm not talking about gypsies). They easily adapt to our lifestyle. It is even good because some of them provide a kind of labor force that is willing to do some works italians aren't.

Now, talking about the islamists that come here, unfortunately I have to agree. They simply don't want to adapt! Why? I still am to know and would like. In this case I don't know a good option to deal with them that would be humanitarian and ethical at the same time that is practical. Maybe your options would be a good one.

&gt;Else - assuming it's your, and not mine definition which is correct, why bigamy is illegal then? Why it seemingly it's alright to ""discriminate"" people who happen to have more than one partner? Why it's legal for one group of people (those with only one partner) to be married to someone they love, but for other group (those with two or more of them) it's illegal to be in a legally sanctioned union with their partner? Inequality. Simple.

You're right, there is inequality against those who wish to practice bigamy. And if this argument lived in a vacuum and the only thing we were talking about was ""inequality"" then you'd be right. It'd be ""simple"" inequality. But collectively as a society, inequality is not the only concern. Yes it's a great rallying cry to things like gay marriage and civil rights. But the real issues are more complex. But the reality of any societal question is about equality, economics, morality etc. And sometimes, these things are in conflict with one another. Yes, most people could theoretically imagine a perfect bigamist family in which all members love each other equally. But this ignores the historical context of bigamy which involved harems, sexual abuse, and misogyny. So yes, it's unfair to those who want to practice bigamy, but it's a decision that society has made to hopefully avoid the problems of the past. 

Gay marriage does not have these hang ups. There was time when people thought there were moral issues with homosexuality. People often falsely cite things like child abuse, sodomy, and godlessness. But evidence has shown that except for the biblical stuff, none of this stuff is true. As such, society has deemed that he inequality of gay marriage should be fixed. 

Obviously ""societies"" decisions are more complex due to the politics, but the main point I'm trying to point out is that your ""inequality"" argument is missing the full picture. 

There is numerous other examples of this. Drug laws are an obvious example. People can smoke tobacco and drink alcohol but almost all other recreation drugs are banned. Society seems to have started to think that this is unfair for marijuana and laws have started to change. Would you make the same bigamy argument for meth? I assume not. I assume you'd inherently know that inequality is not the only issue. You'd see that beyond equality, there are significantly more public health concerns with meth then there would be with weed.

false,esbio,null,null,"&gt; Honestly, why is the the EU's fault that beets grow better in the damp north? There still is significant sugar production in Italy anyway.

For two reasons:

1) because beet production is just one factor of sugar production.
2) because when it's time to do things that are more efficient to do in Italy, like electricity production via solar panels, the German state prefers to flood the market with incentives for solar production in Germany (a very sunny state /s) instead of delegating this production to Italy.

&gt; It seems it wasn't all bad for Italy, nor bad for Italy only.

My point is that these quotas should not even exist to begin with. This is not free market.

&gt; Well, it seems that the additional requirements (closing and destroying refineries) you cite were imposed by the Italian government. So it seems that we have a typical case of national governments scapegoating the EU.

Probably because nobody actually had the money to invest in repurposing those refineries into energy production.

false,my_baby_ate_dingos,IDF,Ile-de-France,"Ce sont les idées de Madelin qui m'ont fait passer libéral. Déjà, ce passage est de la beauté pure:

&gt; Les coupes salariales et l'austérité combinées forment une politique qui ne peut qu'échouer, et beaucoup la remettent en cause. Lorsque vous arrosez l'ensemble des entreprises avec un pacte de responsabilité de 50 milliards, les entreprises applaudissent ce qu'elles voient comme une reprise des impôts supplémentaires qu'on leur a fait payer. Dans les faits, on arrose le sable: la Poste ou la grande distribution sortent gagnants, alors que le problème de la compétitivité est celui de l'investissement dans les entreprises innovantes.

Même si je suis plutôt pro-austérité par idéologie, on est forcés de reconnaître aujourd'hui que ça ne marche pas - ou trop peu pour justifier les sacrifices requis - après les expériences des autres pays européens. Filer de la thune aux entreprises OK, mais encore faut-il que cet argent soit réinvesti quelque part pour ramener la croissance - Augmenter les profits de X ou Y groupe, en soi, n'a jamais rien fait.

C'est comme le faux problème du coût du travail. Oui, le travail coûte cher en France. Non, une simple baisse des charges ne va pas relancer la compétitivité. D'ailleurs, Madelin en parle plus bas.

Il faut le rappeler, **la grande majorité des patrons en France ne sont pas libéraux**. Ils sont tout à fait pour un protectionnisme, voire un interventionnisme étatique, juste celui qui les arrange.

Ce qui tue réellement la compétitivité du travail français, je l'ai déjà dit, c'est la rigidité du marché français. Le modèle CDI-CDD-Intérim est à exploser, en gardant juste ""Staff-Contractor"" comme dans beaucoup de boîtes pétrolières. Bien sûr, ça signifie un changement social beaucoup plus profond (Je parodie: Si y'a plus de CDI, que peut-on exiger pour empêcher ces salauds de pauvres de se loger?)

&gt; S'il n'est pas dans le pouvoir de l'Etat de fabriquer la croissance, il est en son pouvoir de la libérer. (...) L'outil de la compétitivité de l'Etat n'est pas la hache budgétaire mais la restructuration et la délégation de gestion pour réinventer l'Etat.

Et voilà, vous avez en deux phrases ce que c'est que le libéralisme. Un Etat qui n'intervient pas directement dans l'économie, mais trace les lignes du terrain sur lequel les autres acteurs économiques joue. Un Etat qui ne va pas s'évertuer et gesticuler à tenter de sauver des hauts-fourneaux d'acier qui datent de Germinal et sont aussi pertinents que la prose de Zola dans un cours d'anglais de CM2, mais qui va donner une direction et des incitations - autres que financières idéalement - pour que le privé se lance dans l'une ou l'autre des activités du futur que l'on veut développer. 

&gt; Quand le bateau menace de couler, c'est le moment où l'on attend beaucoup de la protection du capitaine.

Il a raison là aussi, c'est pour ça qu'on parle plus de Zemmour que de lui, comme il dit. Seulement là, le capitaine c'est moins Capitaine Picard et plus Capitaine Francisco Schettino. La meilleure chose à faire c'est d'apprendre à nager.

Enfin, à mon sens, le gros problème - et l'atout, au fond - du libéralisme c'est que ça n'a jamais été essayé. De toute la 4e et la 5e République, les idées libérales n'ont jamais touché, encore moins influencé, le gouvernement. Du coup, on ne sait pas vraiment comment ça marchera en France - l'exemple de nos voisins, au fond, ne peut pas être transposé puisque toutes les économies ont leurs spécificités, leurs réactions, leurs idiosyncrasies.",0,1417435621,null,0,false,0,cmhtp6a,t3_2nxhwe,t1_cmhtp6a,t3_2nxhwe,null,1425741564,5,false,france,t5_2qhjz,5

True, 226 vs 255.6 people per square kilometer, or *almost 12% less*. In 2012 (latest figures on Eurostat), Germany received 299k immigrants from other EU countries, for the UK this figure was 158k. Per square kilometer, that's 0.84, compared to 0.65 for the UK.  

But why restrict ourselves to those two countries, when we're talking relative figures? The Netherlands has a population density of 406.5 people per square kilometer, or 59% more than the UK. 51k people migrated there from other EU countries in 2012, 1.23 per square kilometer. An in the Netherlands' case, a relatively large proportion of that area is water. The figures are similar for Belgium.

I'm afraid you'll have to choose another metric, or maybe use a more narrow definition or make some assumptions.

1. people want drugs
2. the win margin with drug trafficking is so huge that cartels are extremely well equipped and capable of bribing anyone who is willing to take a bribe. Others can be threatened.

If the authorities increase the pressure these margins rise even higher. There is no direct way to control demand and supply. People are starting to understand this. Big institutions like the WHO are publicly stating that prohibition causes more deaths, more misery than any drug ever could. Namely former presidents from southern and central American countries are very outspoken against the war on drugs. We are at a point where even active politicians start to speak up against prohibition.

false,xelah1,UKGB,United Kingdom,"TL;DR: A lot of the problems are monetary (divergence of prices across the eurozone), and are being fixed the hard way (squashing incomes) instead of the easier way (inflation).

To add some subtleties and a contrast to monetarism:

- When the government borrows it goes to savings markets and competes for loans with other borrowers (eg, homeowners) and investments (eg, factories). So, unless these are in short supply, it can 'crowd them out' and can push up the interest rates people pay.
- The government doesn't have to borrow to stimulate with spending. It can use new taxes to take money from people who wouldn't have spent it for a while and then spend that immediately.
- Total output is the money supply multiplied by the number of times each year each bit of money changes hands (excluding some things, like gifts and loans). Keynesian stimulus tries to change the second half, the velocity of money. Monetary stimulus tries to change the first.

In the eurozone a big part of the problem was the countries didn't lose their inflation cultures when they joined currencies. So, prices and costs gradually diverged. Here's a graph of nominal unit labour costs over time: http://www.economonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wood1.png

Instead of Greek, Spanish, Irish, etc, imports within the EZ being balanced with exports, we saw the money leaving those countries to buy imports being balanced by loans going in (banks, government debt and TARGET2 balances).

So, within the EZ nothing will be fixed unless:

- Those cost/price levels come back in to line across countries
- They stay appropriate aligned

The first could be partly achieved by inflating the eurozone (ie, quantitative easing to meet a higher inflation target). Germans would have to put up with higher inflation for a while. Because this hasn't been done prices have to come back in to line the hard way: by wages and government benefits (like pensions) being squashed downwards, with much strife and unemployment.

The second needs cultural and legal reforms, especially to labour markets and give-away politics.

Le forze di polizia si occupano di ordine pubblico (alle dipendenze del MInistero dell'interno), le forze armate di difesa, alle dipendenze del Ministero della difesa - Stop.

In realtà ci siamo inventati (intorbidendo un po' le acque) i carabinieri che sono sia forza di polizia sia forza di difesa e la guardia di finanza che ha le stesse caratteristiche con in più una dipendenza dal ministero dell'economia. Ma se si va a vedere, anche all'interno di queste due armi, l'organizzazione interna distingue bene chi fa servizio territoriale e chi afferisce ad un corpo di caratere militare/tattico. Cioè chi fa il carabiniere-paracadutista non finisce mai su una volante, e viceversa.

La polizia militare è un'altra cosa ancora (compiti di polizia all'interno degli edifici delle FA, gestione dei reati militari) e non dovrebbe neanche entrare nel conto (come penso non ci entri la polizia locale).

E' vero che quasi ovunque si possono, in casi di emergenza, assegnare compiti di polizia alle forze armate ma l'occorrenza è ( o dovrebbe essere)  molto rara, fra l'altro perchè l'addestramento che nelle forze armate viene impartito per la gestione dell'ordine pubblico è pari a zero (fatta eccezione per i corpi come i Carabinieri). 

Negli USA, ad esempio, si ricordano  casi in cui è stato richiesto l'intervento della Guardia Nazionale (che è la riserva territoriale dell'esercito) ma per questo ci vuole un atto straordinario del Governatore dello stato.

So technically you could be fined if the police finds pepper spray in your bag. However, especially in cities the cop will understand that you may want to carry a spray for your protectio. If you are a girl alone at night in the subway and you're not causing any trouble, they will let you keep it.

Same goes for knives. It's illegal to carry one, except if you *have* to carry one (i.e. you are controlled on your way to go scuba diving, it's okay to have a diving knife on you. If you are going to the movie theater, it's not). Usually cops will

This article clearly states that that the Unemployment rate in London is 7.5% 

&gt;It’s worth bearing in mind the fact that employment in London is still doing a little worse than in the rest of Britain. London’s employment rate is 72.3 per cent, slightly below the GB average of 73.0 per cent and the unemployment rate is 7.5 per cent, slightly above the 6.6 per cent GB average. But London’s performance used to be substantially worse; these figures represent massive catching up.

false,xelah1,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; In the meantime, globalization happened. World is more open, logistics are getting better and better, and cheap labour is easy to find around the globe.

That's too simplistic - simply because there's an exchange rate between us and them. If all the production moves to places with cheap (in € terms) labour, how do we pay for our exports? Where do the yuan/pesos/etc come from if we can't sell anything to those countries? We can borrow from abroad and sell our assets for a while (a current account deficit) but not forever - sooner or later the exchange rates will change to make that labour less cheap in € terms.

To put it another way: every currency seller must match with a currency buyer for an exchange to happen, so if you add up all the reasons someone might buy a currency then it should match all the reasons someone might do the opposite, so roughly loans in + export revenue in + profits/repayments in + asset sale revenue in = loans out + import costs out + profits/repayments out + asset purchase costs out. (I may have missed some)

So, having government borrow from abroad may not be helping. The Chinese have long used this as deliberate policy: buy dollars and lend to the US government in order to keep the yuan cheap and build up China's export industry. The US fell right in to this trap, fueling it by borrowing during a boom with an incredibly low local savings rate.

false,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"NOTE: I am not a lawyer. Please don't take this as authoritative legal advice.

If you're in Germany, the usual (but not legally required) procedure is as follows:

**Zahlungserinnerung**

A friendly reminder: ""You appear to have overlooked the following payment."" The important thing is to set a specific date by which the outstanding amount is to be paid (two weeks is a reasonable period of time). You can also add a polite sentence saying that any further delay may result in your debtor having to pay additional costs.

**1. Mahnung**

The first demand: ""Unfortunately, we have not received any payment"". At this point, you can add the cost of sending the demand, plus interest on the outstanding amount. This should be itemized. A new deadline must be set.

**2. Mahnung**

The second demand. Now you put the pressure on: ""We urge you to pay the outstanding amount without delay.""

**3. Mahnung**

The final demand: ""If we do not receive the balance due by [date] at the latest, we will take legal action against you.""

**Mahnbescheid**

This is effectively a court order, which you apply for in a relatively painless manner (you can even apply for one online). There is a fee for this, but of course this gets passed on to the person owing you money. If the debtor does not contest the order but doesn't pay up within two weeks, you can then ask the court to send in the bailiffs. There's only an actual court case if the debtor contests it.

That's pretty much the usual procedure (although the number of Mahnungen may vary). However, you are not legally required to go through all the rigmarole of reminders and demands -- it's just considered reasonable and fair.

If you put a deadline on the invoice, you can, once the deadline has passed, go straight to the Mahnbescheid.

If not, then the payment is automatically due after 30 days, meaning you can, after that period, apply for a Mahnbescheid. However, if the debtor is a private person and not a company, the invoice should -- if it doesn't have a deadline -- include a notice that pursuant to §286 BGB, payment is automatically due 30 days after receipt of the invoice.

So, if the debtor is a private person, and you didn't include a deadline or a notification of §286 BGB on your invoice, then you should first send a reminder with a definite deadline clearly stated.",0,1417438540,null,0,false,0,cmhub1g,t3_2nxlvc,t1_cmhub1g,t3_2nxlvc,null,1425741279,8,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,8

And the remaining factories in Italy exploit that advantage, their lower productivity is made up for by their proximity to the consumers.

&gt;2) because when it's time to do things that are more efficient to do in Italy, like electricity production via solar panels, the German state prefers to flood the market with incentives for solar production in Germany (a very sunny state /s) instead of delegating this production to Italy.

That's their own internal choice. I don't understand why the Italian government didn't stimulate solar production themselves, they would have been able to sell it to the Germans when they were forced to close their nuclear plants too. The south would benefit immensely.

But it's still not too late: your latitude won't change, you retained your potential comparative advantage. Start a solar business in Southern Italy now, you'll be rich.

&gt;My point is that these quotas should not even exist to begin with. This is not free market.

They exist because otherwise the old plain production subsidies would cause overproduction. Abolishing the CAP would cause even more bankrupcies in the agricultural sector, and the remaining refineries would be in the north, not Italy.

&gt;Probably because nobody actually had the money to invest in repurposing those refineries into energy production.

In which case the result would have been the same anyway, and not the result of some conspiracy against Italy.

false,lordsleepyhead,NETH,In varietate concordia,"That's pretty cynical of you, and also not true. The Dutch government has long treated drug use as a health issue first and a law issue second. That's why there is a strict separation of soft drugs (marijuana) and hard drugs (coke, heroin, ecstasy, etc). The idea is that people are going to do drugs anyway, so better make it as safe as possible and make sure people are informed about it.

For decades, the city of Amsterdam has been trying to find a balance between freedom and safety. In the 17th century this was freedom of the press, the most important catalyst of the enlightenment, and freedom from religious persecution, which helped enormously in laying the foundation for the modern global market economy.

The Netherlands' famous tolerance is a practical application of the desire for personal freedom, which is really strong in Dutch society. But since we already have four centuries of experience with institutionalized personal freedom, we are also very familiar with its downsides and pitfalls. Freedom is both a right and a responsibility. Your freedom ends where it encroaches on another person's freedom.

Amsterdam's drug policy is based on minimizing health risks, reducing crime, and preventing personal and societal tragedy. The fact that this policy has led to drug tourism requires the policies to change and adapt. The city of Amsterdam not only feels responsible for ensuring the health and safety of its own citizens, but also that of the boneheads who visit Amsterdam to take advantage of its policies in an irresponsible way.

By allowing drug use and prostitution to exist relatively out in the open, policy makers are able to get a handle on things much easier. For instance, it is possible to investigate human trafficking in prostitution more effectively in the controlled environment of the Red Light District than if they were walking up and down a stretch of road in a bad neighbourhood at night. Amsterdam has received criticism from abroad about the problem of human trafficking, but this criticism can only be substantiated because the Netherlands is one of the few countries that is able to get reliable figures on the problem. Having these figures means the problem can be studied much more in-depth and policies can be made accordingly.

In the same vein, when you decriminalize drug use, and someone become ill from bad drugs, their friends will have no hesitation to call emergency services, which can save lives. The precious minutes where they are discussing whether or not to go to the hospital can mean the difference between full recovery and permanent brain damage.

There are hundreds of security cameras and other surveillance devices in the Red Light District. Sweeps and sting operations are being carried out daily. It's probably the safest ""vice"" environment in the world. Yes, there are dealers that sell crap, some of it dangerous, but there is a constant cat-and-mouse game going on between the dealers and the police. Heavier repression of drug culture would just push the problem out of the RLD to somewhere else, and it would be much harder to control.

So there you have it, the Dutch views on the balance between freedom, personal responsibility and safety that are at the basis of the Netherlands' drug policies.

Évidemment, le monde fonctionne sur des rapports de force. Il n'y a pas un seul pays de plus de 30 millions d'habitants qui joue le jeu du libéralisme, et [dès qu'un seul pays ne joue pas le jeu, il est plus intéressant d'opter pour le protectionnisme](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9orie_des_jeux_en_relations_internationales#Rapport_de_protectionnisme). Faire du libre-échange tant que les US et la Chine sont protectionnistes, c'est se tirer une balle dans le pied.
 
En plus, même d'un point de vue local, il n'est pas intéressant de s'ouvrir complètement tant qu'on n'a pas acquis un avantage comparatif par rapport aux autres pays.

&gt;Et voilà, vous avez en deux phrases ce que c'est que le libéralisme. Un Etat qui n'intervient pas directement dans l'économie, mais trace les lignes du terrain sur lequel les autres acteurs économiques joue.

Sauf que c'est faux. Le nucléaire, l'aéronautique et le transport en général, le culturel en France, tout ce qui est militaire partout dans le monde, l'électronique en Corée du Sud et à Taïwan.

&gt; But it's still not too late: your latitude won't change, you retained your potential comparative advantage. Start a solar business in Southern Italy now, you'll be rich.

Because you perfectly know that solar currently is competitive only because of State incentives, something that apparently germany is eager to throw away, but italy isn't. The proper policy would be for germany to throw incentives into buying solar panels that are then installed in Italy and Spain, and do 50/50 with the electricity.

&gt; In which case the result would have been the same anyway, and not the result of some conspiracy against Italy.

I never attribute to conspiracy what I can attribute to simple assholishness.

Along the lines that between Russia and Poland there's a nation that has influence from both, and at a time was split between the Russian Empire and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Hence the buffer zone. 

Jokes aside, Ukraine and Belarus are probably the 2 closest nations out of any else; they have a very much similar schism we had a few years ago between Russia and Europe. There is a significant portion of the population that is pro-EU and anti authoritarian rule (Lukashenko); who were probably the biggest minority at our EuroMaidan. The shitstorm we have in our east is surely a good wakeup call to the rest of Belarus that following putin/russia is a sure path to the grave.

No, there was no overspending of European governments (except perhaps Greece, but that was outright fraud), the problems only started when they had to bail out the banks when *their* irresponsible overleveraging scheme collapsed. That caused panic on the market until the ECB was allowed to play its role of lender of last resort medio 2012. In the words of Draghi: ""The ECB will do anything necessary to support the Euro."" Bam, the sovereign debt crisis stabilized. Now we only need to get the economy going again, and that won't happen unless we activate the money that sits idle.

&gt;and the current EU crisis which was caused by states spending way more than they can afford.

It's not because you keep repeating it that it becomes true.

&gt;Austerity is not some punishment, its an absolute necessity.

No, it's a punishment. It only makes sense in the moralistic framework of sin and punishment. When there is a crisis you need to *support* the population, otherwise there will be even less spending, less business, more bankrupcies, more layoffs, less spending etc.

&gt;The point is that these states have been living way beyond their means and austerity is a way to reform their unsustainable systems.

There was nothing wrong with the state budgets. The bubbles existed in the financial and real estate sector, so it's there that the austerity should happen if it's going to happen at all, not in the government and household budgets of common people.

""Poiché siamo sulla via delle confidenze, riconosco di aver assecondato il teppismo del lettore. Mi spiego: per la strada, quando scoppia un litigio o avviene un incidente della circolazione, scaturisce improvvisamente dalle viscere della terra un individuo che cerca di dare un' ombrellata a uno dei due contendenti, che generalmente è l' automobilista. Il teppista ignoto ha sfogato il suo rancore latente. Così nei libri: il lettore che non ha idee o le ha allo stato amorfo, quando trova una frase pittoresca, fosforescente o esplosiva, se ne innamora, l' adotta, la commenta con un punto esclamativo, con un «bene!», un «giusto!», come se egli l' avesse sempre pensata così, e quella frase fosse l' estratto quintessenziale del suo modo di pensare, del suo sistema filosofico. Egli «prende posizione», come diceva il Duce.

Mouais. Ce sont en grande partie les multinationales qui touchent le pactole. Voir les rapports du CICE par exemple.

&gt; Ce qui tue réellement la compétitivité du travail français, je l'ai déjà dit, c'est la rigidité du marché français. 

Faux.

&gt;Et voilà, vous avez en deux phrases ce que c'est que le libéralisme. Un Etat qui n'intervient pas directement dans l'économie, mais trace les lignes du terrain sur lequel les autres acteurs économiques joue. Un Etat qui ne va pas s'évertuer et gesticuler à tenter de sauver des hauts-fourneaux d'acier qui datent de Germinal et sont aussi pertinents que la prose de Zola dans un cours d'anglais de CM2, mais qui va donner une direction et des incitations - autres que financières idéalement - pour que le privé se lance dans l'une ou l'autre des activités du futur que l'on veut développer.

Faux. Peut-être un certain libéralisme colbertiste mais encore, ta définition est ultra simplifiée. De la part d'un atlantiste mondialiste, c'est assez contradictoire mais ca ne m'étonne pas de Madelin cela dit.

&gt;pour que le privé se lance dans l'une ou l'autre des activités du futur que l'on veut développer.

Ahhh, la glorification de l'initiative privée ? Qu'est ce qu'elle a apporté au juste ? Les plus grandes pontes industrielles francaises sont nées d'investissements publics: nucléaire, télécoms, transports (routier, aérien, sur rail), aérospatiale, service postal, sidérurgie, etc... 

&gt;Enfin, à mon sens, le gros problème - et l'atout, au fond - du libéralisme c'est que ça n'a jamais été essayé.

Faux. C'est le cas depuis la révolution conservatrice des années 80 et même depuis mai 68 pour certains aspects.

The parties

Fine Gael - government party, centre right - socially mildly conservative, anti gay marriage, anti abortion, fiscally shunting money to the wealthy.

Labour - government minor partner. Socially liberal, but tied to the unions so they block the downsizing of our public sector and make modernisation and cost cutting internally impossible, since the public sector unions have them on side.

Fianna Fail - former government majority party - a gang of rogues and corrupt bastards who'd say anything to reclaim power - they represent business interests, golden circles and all manner of cunts.

Sinn Fein - republican leftists, the political wing of the same republican movement the IRA represented. Now in opposition here with growing support.

Greens - self explanatory, I disagree with their position on nuclear energy

Independents - most are extreme conservatives or extreme leftists who show up to protest whatever moderate reforms are proposed.

The current political climate
-Shaky
The implementation of water charges has been plagued by protests, both at the idea of yet another charge, and at the establishment of a water company which spent so much on consultants, and is staffed by political insiders. In the recent October budget, there was a very moderate loosening of taxes and a little bit more to spend, reflecting growth in the overall economy. The government parties are anxious to crow this against the water opposition at every possible opportunity. The reality is the government has already backtracked on the costs of water and the junior partner Labour (which would be more comfortable opposing water charges were they not in government) is having a particularly hard time keeping supporters in line. Mindful of upcoming elections (1-2 years most likely) Sinn Fein have been engaging in theatrics in parliament and getting kicked out by the ceann comhairle (master of order). Meanwhile after huge protests and a climb down from the government, the left smells blood, on December 10th more water protests are planned, if they're big enough, they could destabilize the government completely.",0,1417442521,null,0,false,0,cmhvd1s,t3_2nuoi2,t1_cmhvd1s,t3_2nuoi2,null,1425740787,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Basically he isn't a ""Intensivtaeter"" (multiple offender) he happened to have broken the law several times before but usually it wasn't connected to bodily harm. Just stuff like the occassional stealing and burglary. Apparently this isn't enough to count as a ""multiple offender"". Please notice that this is just a translation.

He just turned 18. You are considered an adult at 18 in Germany but it's questionable to treat someone who just turned 18 as an adult. So he probably will face charges that are less strict for teenagers.
If they provoked him (especialy with racial slurs) then his sentence will be weakened as well so his defendant could use that even if it wasn't the case. If the two girls don't show up as witnesses then he could get away with a relatively easy sentence.


Currently he faces charges of serious bodily harm and depending on the autopsy it might turn into 'serious bodily harm with fatal consequences'. The witnesses who are more or less neutral would help.

No, the population wasn't supported. The banks were supported, and the population had to pay the bill when the ECB wasn't allowed to print money for the states.

&gt;They got masses of European government guaranteed loans (which they likely will never repay), and private investors took massive write downs.

That's not a favor, that's normal practice in times of crisis. Except that normally a central bank is allowed to do that for free, but now they used the occasion to profit from the weak.

&gt;That was about supporting them to stop them from going outright bankrupt, austerity is about them adjusting their spending to a level they can actually afford.

You keep ignoring the point that there wasn't any problem until the banks collapsed. The big money departments of the private sector couldn't afford their mad money games. If you were serious about your ""living within your means"" rhetoric, you would be against austerity for the people and their governments, and in favour of austerity for the banks and big capital.

&gt;È Ravenna la provincia italiana dove si vive meglio secondo la 25/a indagine sulla qualità della vita de 'Il Sole 24 ore', che assegna invece la maglia nera ad Agrigento. Napoli, ultima nel 2013, riesce a recuperare il 96esimo posto. Il Mezzogiorno, da quando si apprende dalle statistiche deve rassegnarsi alla parte bassa, dove prevalgono province siciliane, calabresi e pugliesi, mentre nella top ten prevalgono sia i centri montani del Nord Est sia le realtà emiliano-romagnole, con Modena, Reggio e Bologna nelle prime 10. Ma di quale qualità della vita stiamo parlando?. Se guardiamo ai servizi alla persona, reddito pro-capite e infrastrutture sicuramente lo studio de Il Sole24ore ha concretamente ragione. Il nord, ha saputo nel tempo, sviluppare un sistema, dirottando i fondi assegnati all'intero Paese, che oggi garantisce ai cittadini una qualità della vita superiore rispetto a molte realtà del meridione. Ma questo dato è solo di facciata perchè la qualità della vita è ben altro. Sulla criminalità non c'è più storia, l'Italia è unita in lungo e largo, attanagliata nella morsa della corruzione, delinquenza e malavita organizzata. Da Bolzano a Palermo il rischio di essere rapinati, borseggiati e aggrediti è ovunque, anche nella provincia perbene del nord est. quindi se la criminalità è un comune denominatore la qualità della vita su cosa dovrebbe basarsi? In barba ai parametri de Il Sole24ore , vivere con qualità significa anche poter far fede su un'alimentazione di qualità con elementi enogastronomici a chilometro zero e coltivati sotto il sole del mezzogiorno. Ricette tradizionali che non solo sfamano ma azionano il buon umore attivando impulsi positivi attraverso le papille gustative. Vivere con qualità significa continuare a potersi fidare delle relazioni sociali. Un quartiere, un paese una città diventa un'unica famiglia e la coesione sociale non si limita ad un buongiorno di facciata, ma al condividere parte della quotidianità. Saper di poter contare sull'amico o famigliare senza dover fare i conti con sconosciuti ben pagati anche per badare ai propri figli. Qualità della vita significa, sopratutto finire la propria vita con dignità, senza dover ricorrere a case di cura e ospizi lager. Basti pensare che in Lombardia ci sono circa 876 case di riposo (piene) a fronte delle 231 strutture in Campania. Gli anziani nel sud spesso diventano una risorsa per il reddito delle famiglie mentre al nord ormai il nonno di turno è solo un essere da parcheggiare nell'attesa che la natura faccia il suo corso. Qualità della vita, significa poter contare sulla natura smisurata, sull'assenza di una industrializzazione selvaggia, significa poter prendere un caffé in santa pace senza doverlo pianificare e incastrarlo tra mille impegni. Può sembrare un controsenso ma anche nella morte, il sud primeggia nella qualità della vita. Assistere ad una funzione funebre a Milano significa vivere due volte un lutto a causa di cimiteri saturi. Parametri che cozzano con numeri e statistiche ma che regalano ogni giorno un valore aggiunto alla vita dei meridionali. Se vogliamo tener conto di quanto asserito dal giornale economico... sì siamo gli ultimi di una lunga lista; ma se mettiamo nel calderone anche altri elementi, molto più vicini e molto più emozionanti allora quella classifica va ribaltata; anche perché nella vita non si campa di solo pane...

It isn't a good thing, and extracting rent on money is based on producing valuable things, as any money stored/invested is used to finance the production of value. That's the way our banks and funds work. 

Creating inflation will only cause a higher rent to be extracted by lenders, as interest is based on capital costs, risk and profit.

Windenergie wird bestimmt ein wesentlicher Teil des nachhaltigen Energiemix sein, und wir beim Enegiekonzern o.en wollen Ihnen helfen, indem wir Alternativen zur Kernkraft und zu anderen nicht erneuerbaren Energiequellen finden. Wir meinen -- nein, -- wir wissen, dass Windenergie einer der besten Wege ist, um aus der Kernkraft und aus unsauberer Energie auszusteigen.

&gt;Wir haben zwar Energiequellen wie Erdöl, Erdgas, und Kohle, aber solche Quellen sind nicht erneuerbar. Das heißt, dass es sie eines Tages auf der Erde nicht mehr geben wird.

&gt; Einen schönen guten Abend, meine Damen und Herren,

&gt; Wir haben nur eine Erde. Um sie nicht zu gefährden, müssen wir unsere Stromerzeugung auf nachhaltige Energiequellen umbauen. Wir beim Enegiekonzern o.en wollen der Gesellschaft bei diesem Umbau helfen, indem wir die Erfolg versprechendsten Alternativen zur Kernkraft und anderen nicht erneuerbaren Energiequellen finden. Wir meinen, nein, wir wissen, dass die Windenergie ein integraler Bestandteil eines jeden Mix aus erneuerbaren Energien sein wird. Die Errichtung neuer Windkraftanlagen ist somit unabdingar, um einen Ausstieg sowohl aus der Kernkraft, als auch aus der unsauberen Energieerzeugung durch Verbrennung fossiler Energieträger zu ermöglichen.

&gt; Bisher setzt die Menschheit zum größten Teil auf fossile Energiequellen wie Erdöl, Erdgas, und Kohle. Allerdings sind diese fossilen Energieträger nicht erneuerbar und werden eines Tages aufgebraucht sein. Irgendwann gehen auch die größten Lagerstätten zur Neige. Wind dagegen hat es immer gegeben, und es wird ihn auch in Zukunft immer geben. Wind gibt es überall, und nicht nur an wenigen ausgewählten Orten. Er ist die wahrscheinlich verbreitetste und am einfachsten verfügbare Energiequelle, die man sich vorstellen kann. Deshalb sollten wir den Bau neuer Windkraftanlagen befürworten, anstatt weiterhin auf Energiequellen zu setzen, die aller Voraussicht nach in absehbarer Zukunft nicht mehr zur Verfügung stehen werden.",0,1417449123,null,0,1417449332,0,cmhxuv3,t3_2nw6mk,t1_cmhxuv3,t3_2nw6mk,null,1425739623,1,false,German,t5_2qq51,1

&gt;And compensating the public sector by harming the private sector is a tit for tat business.

It only harms people who stockpiled money. Companies who actually invested won't be impacted, they just keep selling products for whatever price is normal - in fact, their debt burden will be reduced. Those who kept sitting on their money will have lost a percentage equal to the inflation, yes. Serves them right.

No, it's based on a position of power of owners over producers.

&gt;Creating inflation will only cause a higher rent to be extracted by lenders, as interest is based on capital costs, risk and profit.

On the contrary. If inflation is high, money owners will be *obligated* to seek investors to do something with their money, or lose a high percentage of it every year. That will increase the supply of money on the market, and make the interest rate drop. This will strengthen the negotiating position of entrepreneurs and encourage investment.

Printing money can serve as both at the same time.

There are billions of carrots! In July this year the ECB announced negative interest rates, to encourage banks to pump their large reserves into the economy,  which still isn't happening. You can make as much cheap money as you want as long as there is no place to put it, it won't help. We have seen the diminishing effect of expansionary monetary politics in Japan already.

The problem is that countries like Germany are overaged, well developed and her citizens simply don't want to buy more shit. As long as no new technological revolution is going to happen growth is going to suck, but economic growth is required for these monetary policies you're advocating to make sense. To stay with your analogy: Motivating the donkey is only possible if it's a young healthy donkey with a lot of improvement potential. Our donkey is old, fat and is happy with what he has, so we need to find new ways to deal with these economic realities.

---

&gt;

&gt;__Godwin's law__ (or __Godwin's Rule of Nazi Analogies__)   is an [Internet adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_humor) asserting that ""As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1"" ​ that is, if an online discussion (regardless of topic or scope) goes on long enough, sooner or later someone will compare someone or something to [Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler) or [Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism).

&gt;Promulgated by American attorney and author [Mike Godwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Godwin) in 1990,  Godwin's Law originally referred, specifically, to [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) [newsgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsgroup) discussions.  It is now applied to any [threaded online discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_threading), such as [Internet forums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum), [chat rooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chat_room) and [blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) comment threads, as well as to speeches, articles and other rhetoric.  

&gt;In 2012, ""Godwin's Law"" became an entry in the third edition of the *[Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary)*.

false,KegCrab,null,null,"&gt; You keep ignoring the point that there wasn't any problem until the banks collapsed.

And you keep thinking I'm talking about the financial crisis starting from the US housing bubble. I'm not. I'm talking about the *current crisis*. Banks did not collapse. What happened is that banks would no longer lend more money to certain states.

In simplified terms:

1. States spend tons of money on public sector salaries, tax cuts, infrastructure, military, and other things. Things that benefit many citizens, hence those citizens were more than happy to vote for the spenders (and therefore are not innocent bystanders like you pretend).

2. States don't collect enough taxes to cover this, so they borrow money. The way states borrow money is that they write bonds and then sell them to investors (i.e., big banks). This is done in big rounds regularly.

3. These bonds have various terms, but basically the state must pay money to the holders of the bonds. Since the governments are over spending, the way they raise the money to pay for previous bonds is to issue new bonds.

4. The crisis happened when the lenders (i.e., big banks) said that they would no longer be buying bonds at the rate some states were offering. They did this because they saw how much the states were over spending and didn't believe the states would be able to pay back their money.

5. The old bonds mature on regular intervals, and the states need to raise money to pay the bondholders. Since they couldn't sell new bonds, they couldn't pay back. This is called bankruptcy.

It's true that states going bankrupt would've caused many banks to collapse, since those banks were holding many of the bonds, which would've lost their value. However, the banks did not cause this. The states that over spent and borrowed caused this. The people who voted in politicians that over spent and over borrowed caused this.

Edit: So what was done?

The other states could've pumped money into their banks' balance sheets so they could withstand the bond writeoffs, and let Greece and others go bankrupt. That would've meant that the bankrupt Eurozone countries could not pay their public sector salaries including police, military, doctors, teachers, etc. etc. They would've had to leave the Euro and start printing their own money to pay the salaries. That money would have been basically worthless anywhere else. They would've also had to do everything possible to grab the money their citizens had saved, this can be done overtly (e.g., just take the money from the accounts and call it a tax) or covertly (e.g., though monetary policy). This would've left them as third world countries for decades with a worthless currency and nobody willing to lend them money.

The other option was for states to lend the money to the crisis countries instead. This is what was done. Other countries' tax payers effectively picked up the bill and bankrolled these failed states. *Of course*, this bailout is conditioned on these crisis countries actually fixing the underlying problem: over spending. This is what's called ""austerity"", and it's necessary since other countries' tax payers will eventually run out of money to throw at the crisis states too unless the over spending is fixed.",0,1417452992,null,0,1417454019,0,cmhzq95,t3_2nufia,t1_cmhzq95,t1_cmhwdmq,null,1425738749,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

false,Cats_Cars_Chemistry,null,null,"I have always bought my cars (about six or seven) from private persons, so maybe i can give you some advice.

First of all, you have to ask the seller BEFORE driving two or more hours whether the car is still registered.
If it is not, then you are not able to test drive it on open roads or get it home to your own place without plates.

There are two kinds of temporary plates. ""red plates"", ""Händler-kennzeichen"" or ""06er-Nummer"" are all the same and translate to ""car dealer plates"". You can sometimes lend them from a befriended car dealer for 10 or 20 euro for a few hours. Better lend the ""car dealer"" also to help you haggle the price down (10% off is always possible) or check for hidden accidents. These plates are also coupled with an universal car insurance, hence they are very expensive.

The second option is ""yellow plates"" or ""kurzzeitkennzeichen"" which translates to ""short term plates"". The plates cost about 20 to 40 Euro to print, about 15 euro fees and about 80 euro for short term car insurance which you often get deducted on your later ""real"" insurance contract. These plates are valid for 5 days. But if you buy them, drive two hours to find a heap of rust or junk and can't find another car in these five days, then your money is lost.

If the car is still registered, there are also two options.

One (the paranoid seller mode): after signing the contract, the dealer drives the car to the ""car registration department"" / ""Kfz-zulassungsstelle"" and lets his car get deregistered. Don't get mad, the registration and insurance of the car is still valid until midnight. So you have no problem driving your new car home. But you have to park it away from open traffic in a garage or closed parking lot. The police or ordnungsamt is very strict about unregistered cars. 

Two (the normal seller mode): after signing the contract, you sign a seperate paper stating ""I, crazycrazycatlady, have bought this car at December the First at 18:00 and will change the registration asap!"". With this waiver the seller can tell the police ""It wasn't me!"" if you are speeding on your way home and got ""blitzed"" at a speed camera.  Also the car is still insured by the sellers car insurance, but his premiums won't rise if you crash your new bought car.

Irrespective of registration status it is also common to pay a down payment (about 500 euro, usually in cash) to get the legal documents of ownership and, in case the car is still registered, the plates. With these plates, the legal documents of ownership, proof of insurance and proof of technical inspection (TÜV or HU-Bericht) you can register the car in the kfz-zulassungsstelle in your home town. Better get an appointment beforehand. After that you travel to the car AGAIN, mount your plates, pay the rest of the price and leave in your new car. The problem is, you have to travel TWICE to get your new car.

The highest price for a ""new"" used car for me was about 5000 € and was paid in cash. If you or the seller is uncomfortable with large amounts of money, it's helpful to sign the contract in a bank where the cash is thoroughly checked by the clerks and deposited at once.

To give you a tl;dr:
1.) You need insurance to drive a car on open roads.
2.) Germany is a country for cold hard cash

Les faits, c'est que l'euro a accompagné une baisse de la croissance et une hausse du chômage sans rien y faire. Au contraire aujourd'hui on se retrouve en situation de déflation et de manque flagrant d'investissements (mais il faut plus d'austérité pour sauver l'euro-religion).

&gt;L'angélisme de la gauche intellectuelle envers les immigrés crée aussi un décalage entre ce qui est perçu et ce qui est affiché, et même si le FN est aussi en décalage, comme ils n'ont pas de compte à rendre, et qu'ils jouent sur l'omerta, ils peuvent se contenter d'insinuer sans dire, comme ça chacun pense ce qu'il lui plait.

Complètement d'accord avec toi. Le FN comme les autres exagèrent. Simplement on sort de 40 ans de refus de la réalité de la part du pouvoir.

&gt;Il y a aussi le FN lui même affiches, tractages, veille médiatiques et interventions.

Pendant quelques semaines on s'est dit que ça devait être la lessive, l'eau, puis on est allé chez le médecin et le verdict est tombé : la gale. 

Sa copine vivait plus ou moins avec nous et on a du attendre qu'elle puisse venir un soir pour prendre chacun notre traitement et asperger toutes les surfaces tissu de spray A-Par. Malheureusement après une dizaine de jours, aucune amélioration. 

Suite à ça, je suis allé voir mon médecin traitant (je vivais dans une ville différente) qui s'est indigné du traitement ordonné par son collègue à savoir uniquement les cachetons censés d'après lui m'en débarrasser. Mon médecin m'a prescrit les mêmes (je ne me souviens plus de leur nom) et un traitement (à éventuellement renouveler) en spray : le Sprégal. 
C'est super désagréable parce que c'est un truc huileux dégueulasse dont tu dois te couvrir INTEGRALEMENT et hyper inflammable (dur quand on est fumeur) que tu dois garder 8 à 12h avant de te laver.

&gt; Then what are the communists? Extreme-far-left?

Seriously? The NPA, the Front de Gauche, and the Greens all belong to the far-Left. That is accepted by pretty much everyone, including themselves.

&gt; The fact that he managed to rally the radical left on the second turn in 2012 show that those stunts worked. The faith the greens or some intellectuals put in him for the first two years, despite everything, was pretty amazing too.

All of them far-Left or heavily Leftist people, who, much like far-Right or ""catho-fachos"", are disconnected from reality.

&gt; You don't change president because you don't like the guy

Yet that is largely what happened, there was a big problem with Sarkozy himself, not just with his policies, just like for Hollande who is seen as a problem himself because of his supposed weakness.

&gt; The money France spends is money for public services. Public services are here for the people, to help them, to create good conditions of living.

First, you're acting as if any cut to public spending immediately means we close all schools and hospitals, that is simply ridiculous. Secondly, like I said, large part of this money is wasted on a ridiculously heavy administration and even when it's used where it should be, education, healthcare, all the welfare system, it's mismanaged and ends up being largely wasted too. Are you actually denying that the French administration is too rigid, too heavy? Even the most Leftist people among the Socialist Party recognize the administration is too heavy and that it should be reformed, hence the territorial reform which ultimately won't be effective because the administrations that were supposed to be suppressed because they were too expensive will be spared, because Hollande is a coward.


Also, getting money from tax fraud seems to be the solution to everything, except 60 to 80 billions are not enough. Your solution is to keep everything as it is and and use the money from tax fraud to compensate? That won't work, France needs to be reformed. I'm not saying it should be done like in Britain which is turning into the dreamed society of ultra-liberal predators, but it still needs to be done. Also, what are your other options?

false,votapmen,SRPS,Република Српска — Republika Srpska,"&gt;I suggest you revisit Serb war crimes and compare them with ISIS war crimes. The similarities will be shocking.

I'm not suggesting there was no instances of IS-type crimes. There were such instances on all three sides. But attributing them to the collective is absurd. That is why I restrain myself from comparing the Bosnian army with IS, even though the comparison is much more suitable.

&gt;But, what's the you say? Serbs committed no war crimes and are always the victims?

When did I say that?

That is your response to, I quote myself, this:

&gt;Rounding up men of military age from an assuredly demilitarized area from which military excursions were repeatedly made into surrounding Serb villages, and shooting them on impulse **is a war crime**, but it's much different from a state level planning and organization of destruction of an entire ethnicity or a nation.

Meaning, Srebrenica massacre is a war crime, but it's not genocide.

The same goes for this comment of your:

&gt;Serbs kill thousands of non-Serbs in one massacre? Nope not genocide.

&gt;Non-serbs kill 10 Serbs? 100% FUCKING ANTI-SERB GENOCIDE

I never claimed that genocide was committed against Serbs in the 90's. Nor does anyone within Serb mainstream. Ethnic cleansing — yes. But genocide, no.

On the other hand, Bosniaks are quick to label any instance where a few people were killed, no matter who or where, or what the context was (which is the most important part) — as a genocide.

There was ethnic cleansing on all three sides of the 90's wars, but no genocide on either.",0,1417454902,null,0,1417455112,0,cmi0p1o,t3_2nu21w,t1_cmi0p1o,t1_cmh9ief,null,1425738298,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

false,MartelFirst,IDF,Ile-de-France,"&gt; 1) how much money can I spend? I am not poor but I'd like to spend as little as I can. Could I afford to live in Paris with 500 euros per month?

You can't afford to live with only 500 a month. You'd be lucky to find a small studio which goes for less than 500 a month, and then you'd have no money left to eat. Perhaps you can live in a student dorm, but I personally don't know how those work as I've never applied to live in one. Otherwise, if you live in the suburbs it's cheaper, and you can find good suburbs which are next to a train station for easy access to Paris.

&gt;2) how are the public transportations? Are busses and metro well organized?

Public transportation is excellent, meaning there's no place in Paris which is more than 10 minutes away walking distance from a metro station (if you walk slowly). Metros run every 2 to 7 minutes, depending on whether or not it's rush hour. The only problem with the metros, is that they close after 12:30 at night or so (I think they should stay open 24h).

&gt; 3) What are the unique things that Paris offers? 

I don't know about uniqueness. Apparently it's a beautiful city. I genuinely believe Paris has the best cultural offer in the world, in terms of sites and museums and whatnot. Also the food and bakeries and whatnot, but it's like that all over France.

&gt;  4) Is Paris IV a good university?

Uh, yes, Paris IV is a good university. It's the Sorbonne proper. It's probably the best public university in France, and it looks great on a CV.

&gt;5) Is Paris a safe city? Where would you advise me to live to avoid crime? 

Paris is quite safe. Worst areas are in the north east corner. I guess you can just avoid those areas at night, though in truth, it's not the ghetto either. It's fine.

&gt; 6) is Paris a good city for students and foregners? How so?

It's fine. It's not on the top of ""best cities for foreign students"" list, even in France (Lyon, Nantes..etc rank higher), but it could still be a good experience.

That means, for example, the word 'Bier' (""beer"") would be pronounced like 'be-uh' ['bi:ɐ], and 'Meer' (""sea"") like 'Mey-uh'
['me:ɐ]. I really hope you understand what I mean.

In your example, 'Max' and 'Marx' would sound almost identical, with the exception that the 'a' in 'Marx' a long one.

SyRI stands for *Systeem Risico Indicatie* or System Risk Indication. It basically inputs data of every citizen and enables the the government to come up with risk assessment profiles for every citizen ever. It's so thorough it can be used to predict future movement of subjects under surveillance. SyRi basically ended the privacy and personal freedom of all Dutch citizens living in The Netherlands.

Interesting piece to note: The laws required for this came through our parliamentary system without debate. Both through parliament and through the senate. 

Edit:

I found a more precise source with regards to data used. SyRI uses:

Employment data, fines and sactions, tax data, data regarding how much stuff you've bought and posses (ie.: how much is your house worth, how much valuable stuff do you have in your house or in a safe at the bank), trade data, housing data (where do you live now and where have you lived previously, how much did you pay etc), ""identifying data"" (edit2: Just read that this entails the use of and storage of ANPR video, cell phone tracking, internet usage, that kind of thing), *inburgering data* (don't know how to translate that), *nalevingsdata* (also don't know how to translate that properly + it's not specified), educational data, pension plan data, healthcare and health insurance data, debt data, social security data, every permit you've ever applied for.

The Oligarchy would have to be much less visible politically. Every country has a top tier and most of them will be on first name basis, Russia shouldn't have to be the exception but they should certainly be less prominently involved in politics.

Russia itself would have to abandon the idea of being *opposed to* Europe rather than being *part of* Europe. Russian foreign policy is still very Soviet Union-esque in that regard, viewing Europe as a geo-political rival rather than as a neighbour.

The Russian people would have to want it: I don't believe they do.

I think the best chance of this happening has passed us already. When Russia was still weak and laid low in the late 90s and early 2000s, the Russian people may have been able to be convinced.

You should really learn about abuse of (government) power in the history of Germany (both Reich and DDR) and why secret service kind intelligence doesn't need court warrants on the one side, but cannot spy on nationals on the other side.

There's a reason that power is divided between executive, judicative and legislative. Secret service kinde agencies spying on nationals without court warrants (or with warrants from secret, special-purpose phony courts like in the US) undermines this power division.

how did French feel about that part of Marshall plan to resurrect Germany? I bet there were those who were against, but general consensus is that it's better to have stable, democratic, wealthy ally, than angry, poor, and unpredictable enemy. it's one of the main things EU is about. let us be allies, resolve issues on diplomatic level, help eachother, communicate, trade, travel, etc. it's in everyone's interest in Baltic states that Russia would take a path on becoming EU member some day.

however, that's why I said it could only happen in a distant future. I know Russian society very well, I know how it is constructed, I know how they think. after the shock treatment they got in 90s they believe that ""democracy"" and ""liberasts"" are cancer of the world, and in its essence society is opposed to anything that resembles European democratic values. 

not to mention their imperialistic mindset and believe that they are better than anyone else. I know that it can be stumbled upon in every nation in the world, but it's different with Russians. their ""Orthodox-spirituality"" is being reinforced every day on every TV channel there is. I could only compare that to some muslim countries who believe their religion is the right one, and everyone around them are infidels, or subhumans even.

sadly enough the real Russian patriots who wish well for their nation and understand that it's better to live peacefully and wealthy are in such minority, that it's really scaring. most of Russians would rather not have butter on their bread, but at least *Krymnash*. 

I ramble too much already probably, though the main thing I want to say is - when Russians call Baltics (or Eastern Europeans in general) butthurt states, russophobes, etc., they do not understand that we are behaving like that not because we hate their nation per se, but because how they act, starting with their government, businessmen - [New Russians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Russians), their media, and that we are really afraid how masses of their population are just under direct control of state run propaganda with no critical thinking whatsoever. like some kind of zombieland.

 &gt;would there have to be a public apology, or have you already moved beyond it?

apology wouldn't hurt, but we really have moved passed USSR times. we do business, we invite Russian tourists, we go to concerts of Russian singers (bad and good), we teach Russian language. there's absolutely no indication that we have not moved on from the USSR times.

false,PrivateGG,null,null,"500€ a month is impossible in Paris, you cannot even pay the rent with that amount sadly. But, you can look for a few things : 
- Suburbs immediately around Paris, like Boulogne, Vincennes, Saint Mandé. The price are better here, and those suburbs are very well connected through public transportation to the city. 

- Public transportation in Paris is excellent : there will always be a metro inside Paris to take you somewhere, and a full metro line (from one end of Paris to the other) takes around 50min to complete. RER lines go farther away from the city, but those are really crowded. Ideally you want to be close to a metro line, because it means the whole city is easily accessible (in less than 40min). The annual subscription for public transportations (buses, metro lines, RER...) costs around 300€, but once you have your ""Navigo"" card as its called, you can use public transportation as much as you want. 

- Food is not so expensive for students, as there are many university restaurants (Resto U or CROUS as they are called), where you can eat for around 3€, and of course you can make your own food, which is definitely the cheapest. There are also a number of discounts which come along with the Navigo pass that you can use in a lot of places.

- Paris is a great city for students : there are plenty of bars and areas to hang out (Bastille/Panthéon). It is quite safe, even though you should stay away from some areas (north east/east of Paris for example) at late hours.

- Paris isn't the greatest city for foreigners, french people are not great at english and foreign languages in general, though students are generally better. French people like Italian people though, so no worries there :D.

- Paris IV/La Sorbonne is a very good university, and probably the most internationally recognized, however, it is not the best in some areas. There are lots of universities in Paris, and some have their specialties : for example, in law Paris II/Panthéon-Assas is the best, not Paris IV. If you are going to graduate and head to college/uni, then you must know that the first year in french universities is generally the roughest (especially in medicine), the french universities are very cheap (300/500€), and there are very few entrance requirements in term of grades, so tons of people attend them in the first years : the uni are crowded, especially during the first months. By the end of the year though a lot of people have dropped out or are simply skipping class so things get better. The first year is purposefully harder so that people who are not really interested in their studies just leave before the end of the year.

- I don't know what level you have in french, but you need to learn it. It is somewhat close to italian, so you can improve quickly with the right practice and efforts.",0,1417460299,null,0,false,0,cmi3l59,t3_2nybyp,t1_cmi3l59,t3_2nybyp,null,1425736878,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

&gt;Seriously? The NPA, the Front de Gauche, and the Greens all belong to the far-Left. That is accepted by pretty much everyone, including themselves.

Absolutely not.  Historically, academically, and politically the divide between the far-left (extreme-gauche) and the left is whether a party is reformist or revolutionary.
If they are reformists, they try to change things from within the institutions, through winning elections. This is what the PS, PCF, Front de Gauche, or Greens do. You will **never** find any of them accepting the designation of far-left / extreme-gauche. ""Gauche radicale"" for some at most, yes, but not extreme-gauche/far-left.  
The revolutionaries are the [far-left](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extr%C3%AAme_gauche_en_France). They don't believe a meaningful change can come from within the institutions and elections, but from, precisely a revolution.  This is the NPA, L.O, P.O.I... Not the greens....

&gt;All of them far-Left or heavily Leftist people, who, much like far-Right or ""catho-fachos"", are disconnected from reality.

So you're confirming what I said earlier, the ""leftist stunts"" were not received as such by everyone. 

&gt;Yet that is largely what happened, there was a big problem with Sarkozy himself, not just with his policies, just like for Hollande who is seen as a problem himself because of his supposed weakness.

Haven't heard anyone during the 2012 elections telling me that the real problem with Sarkozy and the main reason to kick him out was his ""style"" / personality (even if it also mattered). His policies and their non-surprising lack of results were the main issue. Please give some credit to the french voters. 

&gt;First, you're acting as if any cut to public spending immediately means we close all schools and hospitals, that is simply ridiculous

I'm acting as if public spending exist for a good and legitimate reason.

&gt;Are you actually denying that the French administration is too rigid, too heavy? 

French public administration is extremely heavy and rigid. But that is common problem to any big administration, public, private, french, belgian or mexican. It is in the nature of an administration. Sujet tarte à la creme.  Comparatively to many other countries around the world (most of them honestly), the mismanagement of public funding in France is far from dramatic. It can always be improved, and should be. You could always save a couple (a couple dozens?) billions euros by hunting down mismanagement, waste, corruption and redundancies. But do you genuinely think that most of public spending ends up in some blackhole and never reach the citizens? That is just ludicrous.

Engineering Trained Gintaras Rapalavicius from Lithuania has taken a job as a carpenter in Bodo. No Norwegian companies want to use Lithuanians expertise.

- Home in Lithuania, I worked as a structural engineer for nearly 20 years, but here in Norway I am a carpenter. It's a little funny, huh, says Gintaras Rapalavicius.

Before he took engineering in their home country, worked as a bricklayer and has carpenter.

- I know almost everything about the building industry, he says.

Gintaras Rapalavicius came to Norway in 2011 to give the family financial security. NRK he meets at work while he saws into planks in connection with building houses.

Home in Lithuania, he heard several times that there was a great shortage of engineers in Norway - and it's true. Statistics estimated in 2013 that it lacks 4,600 engineers in the country, but it does not help Rapalavicius.

- When I arrived here I understood that it was not so easy. I have searched 100 jobs, but not got one positive response. I think most people are a little skeptical of immigrants. To get a job without any recommendations or friends is difficult.

A big problem
On the Career Centre in Mo i Rana, they help immigrants get jobs. Here they see that some immigrants move out of the county because they are not getting a relevant job, says career coach Mariann Bratland.

- I know a bioengineer who moved out of Nordland because the only job he got was a locum job as health worker. These are the people we need.

- Early career is also important to get these people out of work. We can help migrant workers and refugees to get approved educations their homeland. We must also be improved to assist in the application process and writing a resume.

Bratland says that the number of immigrants who contact Karrieresenteret increases. She is happy. Different culture can help to make it extra difficult for foreigners to get out of work.

- We have examples of immigrants who have taken away education from their CV because they will not boast, says Bratland.

- Have a need for more

Today there are 11,000 workers of foreign origin in Nordland. Nationally, the figure is 358,421. And the need will only increase in the years ahead. NHO believes one must better prepare for that foreigners can get into working life.

- Without foreigners in the workplace, then Nordland halt today. We need more qualified, knowledgeable foreigners, and we need a policy that actively facilitates recruitment, says regional director Ivar Kristiansen.

NHO believes many employers are hesitant to hire people because they may not have the necessary expertise.

- There are unfortunately many individual cases and individual destinies, where foreigners are not released within your doorstep. There may be various reasons for it.

- It is not, for example added to ensure that an employer can test out people. The risk is that one ends up with personnel who are not qualified, which may have a financial risk as well.

- Need people with knowledge
Kristiansen believes to have countless examples of foreigners have been given a chance under strong doubts from the employer, and which has since proved to be a valuable asset for your business

Kristiansen believes therefore need public approval schemes, which ensures that a person with an exam taken abroad have the same qualifications in Norway.

- We are already missing professionals in a variety of work. If we are to exploit the opportunities that lie in the future, we need knowledge and labor from abroad, he concludes.

Consider traveling home
Rapalavicius has started a carpentry firm in Bodo. He believes Norway miss much good labor.

- If I do not get a job as an engineer during the next year, I must consider moving back to Lithuania. I will not work as a carpenter rest of my life, but use my experience and knowledge as a structural engineer.

- Would you recommend friends and acquaintances at home in Lithuania with high education to apply for a job in Norway?

- It's a good question. I have said to my friends that if they have a regular job in Lithuania, they should not move to Norway. It is difficult to establish themselves here.",0,1417460990,null,0,false,0,cmi3z1x,t3_2nyrx9,t1_cmi3z1x,t3_2nyrx9,null,1425736698,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Mon objectif final est, et je l'ai en tête depuis quelques années : enseigner les maths en prépa. Ou alors si pas en prépa, à un niveau équivalent. 
Actuellement, je suis en M2 pour préparer l'agreg de maths. 
On m'a dit, confirmé par mon directeur de master, qu'aujourd'hui il faut un doctorat pour les jeunes embauchés prof en prépa. 
Bon, moi, la recherche c'est pas trop mon truc, mais je sais que je pourrai me lancer dans trois ans de préparation de thèse s'il faut passer par là pour mon objectif. Les sujets qui m'interessent touchent surtout l'arithmétique, éventuellement la topologie. 

Mais je suis également interessé par l'histoire des mathématiques, et un ami m'a dit qu'il était possible de faire une thèse dans ce domaine. 
D'où mes questions, que je poserai aussi à mon directeur de master, mais que je pose aussi ici, au cas où certains d'entre vous auraient eu une expérience dans le domaine, et ou connaitriez des personnes en ayant eu : 
- Est-ce qu'une thèse en histoire des maths me permettrait d'enseigner en prépa ? Sachant que si j'ai bien compris, la condition ""doctorant"" est plus pour filtrer les agrégés que pour réclamer un réel niveau doctorant. 
- Est-ce que je pourrai réalistiquement avoir accès à une telle thèse, idéalement financée, sachant que je n'ai de l'expérience qu'en maths, et au final, quasiment pas en histoire ?

As a traveler you have the responsibility to respect culture of the country your in, whether it's the United State's, Spain or any other country on the planet.

Edit: I want to make clear that you certainly don't have to tip for bad service. One caveat would be that, in many restaurants you may be taking your anger out on someone besides the server. In some restaurants other workers get a cut of the tip also, such as hostesses, busboys, bartenders and expediters. These people may have done their job to perfection and would be unjustly miscompensated because of a bad server. In these situations the best approach is to leave a modest tip and show your dissatisfaction by simply not bringing repeat business to the restaurant and if you really must be vengeful, then share your bad eexperience in an online review and amongst your social circle.

The United States would probably lose its collective political mind.  One can hope that in a democracy sanity would prevail, but I wouldn't want to bet against some sort of military action completely out of proportion to the actual threat.

A much smarter move geopolitically would have been for both sides to create some sort of structure where they legally guaranteed the neutrality between Russia and Western Europe of Central Europe and the Baltic states, a greater Finland or Austria if you will.  Sure it might not respect the self-determination of the nations in question, but unfortunately that really doesn't ever enter into things except when it's politically expedient.  A stable alliance needs to be built on more than ideals.

Though there's nothing immoral about NATO expansion to the east but I do think it was poor judgement, it's certainly an example of political overreach and destabilization of a status quo.  This was a change in mission for NATO and one that has not been backed up with a strategic realignment that makes the new members safer in time of conflict.  Otherwise we wouldn't be worried and having this discussion in the first place.  By comparison West Germany was primarily concerned about a Soviet invasion as the beginning of a full blown war, there wasn't really any serious concern that Soviet tanks would cross the border just to rattle the sabre or to achieve some domestic political goal in the USSR.  The alliance was stable in that configuration and it was a credible threat since it would have been politically very difficult to peel off any of the members which bordered the Warsaw Pact in time of crisis.

The current configuration and world politics are very much less black and white and it's not at all certain that the United States or even France, Germany and the UK would throw in for WWIII over Russian aggression against, for example, Lithuania or Bulgaria.  This creates a pressure point that can be used against the alliance and can create additional strain.  I'm personally skeptical about NATO's current mission as it is not focused in the way that it was during the Cold War.  It's too much of a geopolitical club and not enough of a logical military alliance.  Since NATO is not purely defensive, either it's a dagger pointed at Moscow in which case Russia has every reason to be concerned even if it's not about to be attacked; or it's not, in which case it's a strange alliance made up of countries with widely divergent goals with no clearly discernible threat to justify its existence.

This was not a once off break either.

 The 2011 NATO offensive campaign against Libya is quite similar, in that Libya did not threaten any member state.

There may be more examples as well, but I think Serbia and Libya are pretty illustrative.

In the US, something like 4% of people who are executed are actually *innocent*. Can you imagine being hauled up into court, sentenced, and executed - *knowing* that you never even committed a crime?

This means that in the US, every year the state kills 2-3 innocent people.

It'd be great to know which 2-3 they were so that we could *not* execute them, but that's the problem - they all went through the same process and we don't know who they are. Statistically, however, they are there and they are being killed.

Regardless of if you think someone who can absolutely unequivocally be convicted of a crime should be sentences to death, in reality that never was, never is, and probably never will be the actual result of having a death sentence.

So, first of all, you need to be pretty sure what you wan't to study, then you need to categorize it (in france, we usually divide subjects in the following way : humanities, literature, law, arts and spectacles, medicine, science and technology).
With that in mind, you need to investigate which university is offering the subject you want.
Then make a list of choices, even though Paris IV looks nice on your CV, other universities can be equally good, or bette depending on the subject.

As you are a foreigner but EU citizen, for applying you will need to do so through [admission post-bac](http://www.admission-postbac.fr). If you also have the citizenship of a country which is not in the EU or member of the Schengen Area, you can also apply through DAP (procédure d'admission préalable).

All information necessary can be found in [campus france italia](http://www.italie.campusfrance.org/page/iscriversi-al-1°-anno). They have concellors that will help you through your application process, and will be able to answer you questions in a better way than I.

Also, you don't seem to be able to speak french, this will be a problem for you, as most courses offered at an undergraduate level are taught in french.
