Think about it this way, in terms of population, Economy, and Size, the baltic states are actually Smaller than Ukraine itself, I myself find that somewhat worrying.

http://www.cream-migration.org/files/FiscalEJ.pdf

ten countries joining the EU in 2004 are called A10.

Difference is in the period it seems, and when the immigrants in question came. Numbers cited in this article come from pg 25, which refers to table 6 on the following page. 

panel a is for the period of 1995 - 2011, numbers are Natives: -591.491b, EEA: 4.425b , non-EEA: -117.968b. this is counting the overall cohort of immigrants.

panel b is for the period of 2001-2011 and here we have the distinction: Natives -616.529b, recent A10 is 4.961b, recent other EEA is 15.255b, recent non-EEA is 5.207b, where recent means people arriving after 2001.

This is under the assumption that immigrants pay the average cost of public goods, rather than the marginal cost thereof, which gives more favorable results. 

&gt; Up until 2000, the relative fiscal contribution of natives was larger than the contributions of either EEA or non-EEA immigrants. However, since 2001, EEA immigrants have not only consistently had a higher revenues/expenditures ratio than natives but have often made positive fiscal contributions even in years when the amount of public expenditure on natives has been larger than natives’ fiscal payments. On the other hand, the fiscal contribution of non-EEA immigrants is slightly negative in all years, although the difference between their net cost and that of natives has been closing over time.

&gt; Overall, therefore, the figures suggest that immigration since 2000, in particular from EEA countries, has helped reduce the fiscal burden for native workers and contributed to reducing the UK’s fiscal deficit

Perhaps the situation is irreversable, yes. Still doesn't make it right, and it could be compensated for by making a large payment as reparation.

Yes, his decisions ultimately caused Crimea to be part of Ukraine, but that makes sense, because the main route to get there is via Ukraine in the first place.

If Crimea wanted independence, they could have tried for that; instead what we have here is annexation.

And I think this is what u/paravin is not counting in. The mindset of Russians were changed 180 in a month regarding separatism in Crimea. In situation of crisis Putin will first of all shoot his propaganda cannons that lays down the ground for next stage. 

So I think the overall question is million dollar question. Can Putin destabilize a Baltic country when he wants. Or does he even want that at all, as it might be too risky. 

I must add that last year I would never expect Putin to attack and invade Ukraine. But analysts were predicting Ukraine is next after Georgia all over the globe. And now everyone is talking about Moldova and Baltics. I don't know what to think of that. Definitely worrying.

Additionally, with all of these so called ""failed"" interventions (like Iraq and perhaps Libya) you have to ask yourself: What would have happened if we hadn't invaded?

Threats? Perhaps the threats of less scientific and military collaboration, but not *actual* threats of violence.

&gt; Putin and Assad haven't invaded peaceful nations

Putin has invaded several ""peaceful"" nations, most recently Ukraine and Georgia. He kills innocent people on a daily basis thanks to Chechnya, Abhkazia and South Ossettia, soon to be added to this is ""novorossiya"" or what the rest of the world calls (including China) Eastern Ukraine.

The most recent Assad has only been in this one civil war, but prior to Bashar, Syria had joined in a number of sectarian wars, mostly siding with baathist Iraq.

&gt; Bush did and he FORCED Blair into it, he had NO CHOICE!

No he didnt they where actually very good friends. [Blair is a Catholic and felt as though it was his religious duty to ""help"" Iraq.](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/dec/23/uk.religion2)

false,[deleted],null,null,"1. Shopping, you have Avenue Jean-Médecin, conveniently served by the tramway, from there you head south, south-east towards the beach and the old town, many pubs, and so on. There are going to be christmas decorations all over the city of course, and the ""christmas market"", which is just an excuse to dip churros in nutella while marveling at the artisan-made traditional provencal ""Santon"" dolls, takes place on Place Masséna. Visiting, I would recommend Eze-Village, it's a castle-city with an incredible view (20 minute drive east), Monaco (not just for the casino!), my favorite seaside town AND beach : Villefranche-sur-mer, like fifteen minutes east from nice-ville train station. If you enjoy art, Saint-Paul-de-Vence has the most galleries to the square kilometer, it's a very pretty fortified village a thirty-minute drive away due west, and well worth the visit. There is a ""castle"" hill in Nice, but the actual castle was destroyed centuries ago. On that hill, on a clear day, you can spot the neighboring island of Corsica. 

2. The best pizza in town can be found on the zone piétonne, at ""La taverne Masséna"", ""Le Québec"", or ""La Pizza Cresci"" (same owner), do try it out! If you're visiting the old town, find ""Lou Pilha Leva"" or ""La Socca"", ask for Pissaladière (onion tart) and Socca (chickpea flour.. crêpes?). Now in the old town is a large plaza one street away from the Promenade des Anglais, called Cours Saleya, you won't miss it, it's full of tourists, and the prices show. I would avoid visiting any of the restaurants there, as the quality doesn't scale with the price. There is one italian restaurant on the outskirts of the entire plaza where the prices are fair, La Voglia. It's still expensive but the plates are copiously filled! Don't feel bad about eating italian cuisine in France, Nice is french since only a century and a half! Deeper in the old town, both ""Lu Fran Calin"" and ""Le Gésu"" offer probably the most traditional experience in the old town, although if you really want hardcore regional delicacies, you will instead google the adress for Brasserie-Restaurant de L’Union, it's in a northern part of the city. Can't get more *Nissart* than this team. Be sure to ask for salade Niçoise (the ACTUAL recipe, not the one found at every hotel and restaurant in the world with silly ingredients), Farcis, Panisse, they usually have appetizer plates if you wanna try everything. If you ate at Lu Fran Calin, you're probably close to Place Rossetti, where a BUNCH of people are massed in front of ""Fenocchio"" for their wide variety of ice-cream flavors. Best ice cream parlor, hands down.

3. If you want to make the most of the climate, the ski resorts are an hour or two away, there are public bus rides to Auron (best), Isola 2000 (tackiest), and others, for cheap. Otherwise, you want to be as close as possible to Jean-Médecin, or Place Masséna, to do everything by foot or public transport. You want to be close to downtown, and far away from the airport.

It's *really hard* to be the people paying the highest wages on the planet, because it constricts the market for those products. For us, Europe is that place with higher wages. It is the massive market that we can sell things to.

That's *part* of why our sphere of influence is so large: We want customers, and the only way you can be a significant customer is to have a widespread decent standard of living.

We don't need more land(the US is largely empty), we don't need ports or access to this sea or that sea, and we don't need more political influence or allies.

&gt; But in the international media it looks like independents being repressed because the red mafia is very good at masquarading so. Like these AI-style human rights NGOs they have always been understood as belonging to the now defunct SZDSZ party and thus forming the ""liberal"" wing of the red mafia. It is largely about money, giving money to friends (Norwegian money in this case), because everything is largely about giving other people's money to friends here except that there was a claim (not sure if true) that there was something illegal about it, usury or something, so the police raided them. I guess at the end of the day the Fidesz wants this money to their friends instead. Because it is really what everything is about, does the red mafia get the money or the orange mafia gets the money.

Foreigners first must understand the nature of the Hungarian hivemind. With a history of many highs but more lows (and more importantly little middle ground inbetween), Hungarians tend to think themselves as the forever victims. Domestically that resulted in people's alienation from politics, critical thinking and general melancholy, a widespread opinion that nothing can possibly change because we are too down the rabbithole. That the ""common people"" are destined to be employees all their lives and to be exploited by the cheating employers, multinational corporations, etc. .

Internationally the very same applied but replace the people with Hungary and the oppressors with the evil West, teh gayjewchemtrailIlluminati. Many people think this Hungarocentric way when they legitimately believe Hungary is the main topic of discussion from Berlin to Brussels, from Tel Aviv to Washington. It's a coping mechanism. 

With mindset like this I'm well aware how foreign, otherworldly can the concept of charity and civil organizations can seem. Hungarians exercise their coping mechanism here as well as muscle memory and just assume that these organizations have a hidden agenda. That they are Socialist/liberal party cronies when they make statements that happen to be similar. They refuse to acknowledge that these are global organizations with offices present from Somalia to the Solomon Islands, from Belarus to Benin. That they speak out against Eritrean civil right offenses just as much as they do against Hungarian ones. That doesn't fit in the ""everyone is against us"" argument so they just disregard it. I agree that AI, TI, Freedom for Civil Liberties (TASZ) is generally understood to be leftist agents, but I have to ask: on what basis? 

People are so gullible they believe anything that they are spammed with. Jobbik chairman Vona said less than a week ago that the Internet-protest is basically a CIA-operation and that's practically canon by now on far-right websites. He said it out of the blue, just to further his anti-American agenda with retarded stuff and people believe him because...just.

This mixes up with straight up /r/conspiratard, /r/forwardsfromgrandma and /r/TheRedPill stuff when organizations with a feminist angle are attacked as agents of once again teh gayjewchemtrailIlluminati. I'm not talking about controversial FEMEN-like groups, but ones against family violence or supporting victims of rape (NANE). Recently, following a rape scandal at a university freshers' camp, a website started to publish anonymous accounts of rape victims which ultimately went unreported. A good 80% of the comments (hundreds) were discussing how the victim is probably lying, was asking for it, misinterpreted the situation and were crying out against the terrors of female-on-male violence (divorce and such).

All in all Hungarians are first and foremost suspicious people able to win Olympic gold with perfect 10.0s in the field of mental gymnastics any time of the day. We had to subsist under very peculiar circumstances that alienated a great deal of us from questoning the status quo on everything as long as it resulted in something tolerable/nice for us. Minority rights are crazy leftist-destructive ideas as long as they are about minorities in Hungary. If they are about the Hungarian minority in Romania then suddenly they are human rights.

These sort of double standards mixed with the huge cultural and socioeconomical differences result in us being so fucked up. We have a huge tendency to see everything black-and-white, when if someone does something questionable then that person/organization is written off from that point on, to be considered more evil than Satan's balls and anyone who opposes them is automatically 100% correct all the time. 

Critical thinking is something Hungarians are terrified of. So terrified they don't even dare to think about it. Because acknowledging that maybe, just maybe it is not 100% of the gayjewchemtrailIlluminati's fault that you have to live off of 400€ a month is a scary though. Admitting that even though adverse conditions do exist that make it much harder to ""make it"" than in other places, the gayjewchemtrailIlluminati's (and the state's, and the multinational corporations') fault in this still might not exceed 30-40% and the majority of your fate is decided by YOU. 

Nope, can't have that, we're forever victims who are faultless and perfect and the only reasons millions didn't make it is because the cartoonish evil forces acting against the nation. Until people realize the self-imposed, voluntary delusions many live with and act out to break down these barriers we'll be fucked.

Es geht beim technischen System vor allem erst einmal darum alle Fehler _nicht_ zu machen, die ein Lokführer i.d.R. _nicht_ macht. Wenn das läuft und du statistisch gleich oder besser bist als ein Lokführer - dann kann man das Nutzen. 

Ich bin mir sicher daran arbeiten momentan einige Leute und das man davon nichts hört hat vermutlich weniger damit zu tun, dass die Lokführer so toll sind sondern damit, dass es bis jetzt entweder zu Teuer oder eben noch nicht Alltagstauglich ist. 

Computer sind Werkzeuge und keine allmächtigen Überwesen. Es gibt einen Status-Quo der aktuellen Forschung (den ich - zugegeben - nicht kenne) aber ich kenn mich ein wenig Maschinellen Lernen und den dortigen statistischen Ansätzen aus und das ist von den Möglichkeiten, die man hat weniger Magic als man vielleicht gerne hätte. Und das kann ganz schnell völlig falsche Ergebnisse liefern. 

Vielleicht gibt es ja bald ein paar coole Ansätze, aber bei wechselndem Wetter ist Bilderkennung mit dem Computer ist noch nicht annährend so fähig wie ein Menschliches Auge und Gehirn mit Erfahrung.

&gt; le SNPL a conseillé à ses adhérents l’astuce suivante, particulièrement efficace pour les vols long-courriers. Un pilote qui doit par exemple faire pendant cinq jours des voyages allers et retours entre les aéroports de Paris et Tokyo, se déclare en grève seulement pour le premier jour ; son vol ne décolle donc pas, et comme l’avion n’est pas parti à Tokyo, il ne peut pas en revenir le lendemain. Le planning est ainsi perturbé jusqu’à la fin de la semaine. Le pilote, lui, n’a été officiellement en grève que le premier jour ; il va par conséquent demander à l’entreprise de le payer pour les jours suivants, même s’il n’a pas volé de la semaine. Le syndicat Alter (non représentatif) tenait le même raisonnement : le pilote en grève une journée, et officiellement au chômage technique les jours suivants, se tient « à la disposition d’Air France » et devrait donc être payé – même si la compagnie ne lui a pas proposé de vol, et s’il « ne sait pas s’il aurait accepté » ces vols de substitution…

On pose un ultimatum à une UE mondialiste qui joue les pays, puis les peuples les uns contre les autres avec son dumping fiscal, son dumping social, et ses frontières non contrôlées, alors que la plupart des autres zones du monde font l'inverse (protectionnisme et contrôle strict des frontières, que ce soit aux US, au Japon ou en Chine, ils font l'inverse de nous).

&gt;on ferme les frontières

On contrôle les frontières. Tu confonds une porte avec un mur.

&gt;on interdit le mariage gay

On interdit l'adoption gay, avec ses corrolaires que sont la PMA non médicale et la GPA. Et on remplace donc le mariage par une union civile qui donne exactement les mêmes droits que le mariage, sauf l'adoption.

I know this because in the 1998-2002 period I did believe 168 Óra and only later I realized this was just a huge fearmongering, presenting Orbán as totally Generalissimo Franco...

I would say it is not that Orbán for example is seen a saintly and in this sense uncritically supported. Totally not more like ""lesser of two evils"" kind of.

This is the question you're quoting with your 54% stat:

&gt; Should Puerto Rico continue its current territorial status?

This question has nothing to do with statehood. You're thinking of this question:

&gt; Which non-territorial option do you prefer?

Which got a 61% for statehood, without counting this major fact:

&gt; There were 515,348 blank and invalidated ballots counted alongside the 1,363,854 ballots which indicated a choice for one of the non-territorial alternatives

You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Like seriously, none. Statehood got less votes than the blank/invalidated ballots and the non-statehood options combined. You didn't even know what the questions for the referendum were, let alone the results and implications.

No, 54% do not want statehood. You'll find no article saying that, and you'll find no analyst agreeing with you. Stop pretending to understand matters to obviously know nothing about.

Damit Oma nicht überfahren wird nehmen wir einfach eine bauliche Trennung zwischen Gleis und Bahnsteig vor nach dem Asiatischen Modell. Zur kommt ==&gt; Türen gehen auf und die Leute können ein und aussteigen. Zusätzlich kann man alles noch mit Kameras und Bewegungssensoren überwachen.

Wenn Oma natürlich wild auf den Gleisen rumläuft hilft das natürlich nichts. Der Lokführer kann dann jedoch auch nichts machen wenn er mit 200 oder sogar weniger entlangrauscht. Denn bei dem Bremsweg von Zügen bleibt außer Drüberbügeln nichts anderes übrig.

Vandalismus und Sabotage ist ein generelles Problem. Signalanalgen sind auch teuer und sind genauso dem Risko ausgesetzt.

Und ich kenne auch einen einfachen Trick Züge aufzuhalten. Stell einfach einen Einkaufswagen auf das Gleis. Aber Pssst nicht weitersagen.

Technisch gesehen könnte man mit Sicherheit mittelfristig in 5-15 Jahren den führerlosen Zug umsetzen.

Das Problem liegt dabei jedoch ganz woanders. Zum einen natürlich wie schon erwähnt die Akzeptanz von einem autonomen System. Denn das darf natürlich keine Fehler machen (Das der Mensch wesentlich mehr Fehler macht siehe z.B. der jüngste Vorfall in Mainz oder der Unfall mit dem Transrapid interessiert natürlich keinen).

Und weitergehend natürlich die rechtliche Frage. Was passiert wenn es einen Fehler gibt und der Zug säbelt aus welchem Grund auch immer jemanden um? Wer ist dann schuld? Eine schwierige Frage.

I'm a British Catholic (though, unsurprisingly, with Irish grandparents...). 

I understand that there was a time that British Catholics were forbidden (under Canon law) from attending Guy Fawkes celebrations, but that ban was repealed generations ago. Across almost the whole of Britain, Guy Fawkes celebrations have lost any sectarian or anti-Catholic imagery or influence: the Lewes tradition is just a weird historical hang-over from a different age. Catholics across Enlgand and Wales (apart from Lewes) have therefore for a long time celebrated Guy Fawkes in the same way as Protestants.

Sectarianism in England and Wales hardly exists any more: even the last bastion of it in the Liverpool v Everton rivalry is now more or less gone. Even in Glasgow, it seems that sectarianism is on the decline. Catholics in England and Wales are politically and culturally almost interchangeable from non-Catholics and in this context it is very hard for Catholics to even summon up the energy to be annoyed by the Lewes goings on. I think we regard it as a bit of a curiosity.

the most important piece of the news, and the real reason.

I always try to approach these kind of topics from pure logic's side and above everything the ""emotions over facts"" attitude is pretty insulting to me, no matter if it comes from left or right-wing politicians and public players. My anger is against the general way of thinking, not anyone in particular. 

Definitely you are right that there is no political side of angels and no side of devils, that's sort of my point. We just have greedy politicians all around. But greed can come in many forms: some thrive for money, others for power or public approval, others have Messiah complexes and want to ""fix"" the nation according to their ideals and want to suppress any dissent. Sadly in our situation we have to find the lesser of many evils and hope that they'll improve.

By critical thinking I meant that people shouldn't just take things for granted and accept them the way they are just because they have been for a long time. It's not fair toward women to be sentenced to the lower half of the corporate ladder and to lower pay just because they are female. It's not fair to make immigrants, Jewish people, LGBTs, gypsies feel like second (third, fourth) class citizens, generalizing them when the accusers would never do the same to their (our) own group. I.e. a gypsy is exposed as a pedophile - ""That's their culture for them, subhumans, non-people, etc."" - people are wishing ill against gypsies in general, not only the person, but if an ethnic Hungarian is caught doing the same then people are asking for the execution of that one man, not the group and culture he is from.

Never questioning why things are the way they are is a terrible way to live and just copy our forefathers is a terrible way to exist. Acknowledging that not only the state, not only the foreign business conglomerates, Israel, the US and the EU are at fault but us as people, as individuals too would be a huge step forward, but you're familiar with our saying ""Másban a szálkát, magában a gerendát..."" as well. Our fault is different from theirs, but it's a fault nonetheless: the penetration of this malaise, thinking that we are forever sentenced to live under subpar conditions and that the ideal society (for arguments sake let's consider that as Australia, Canada, Norway, etc.) is something that never happen to us and because it won't happen, making efforts to move toward it is pointless. People think of everything as a choice of options: if Australia is an A and North Korea is a C then we are a B-. But the scale we can move on is much, much more detailed and moving up our ""score"" one percent is a lot more tedious and tiresome than dreaming of some day magically becoming a perfect society. 

So yes, I do mean the same under critical thinking as you do, but I don't think it's a Jobbik/far-right only tendency. Sure, it's most extreme and visible there, but I've noticed the same in more sophisticated ways among everyone. We got used to the very artificial Socialist welfare state (pre-1989) and consider things like owning your own home after a certain age a given right. Hungary along with Romania sports the highest home ownership rates with 95+% in Europe, whereas places like Switzerland, Sweden, Finland are on a scale, between 45-80%. It puts poor people in a financial downward spiral and ties them down hard. In the US people are willing to move thousands of miles for a job, for us taking one 50kms away is a huge obstacle and maybe a deal breaker for many.

Ultimately the two examples you wrote stem from the same root in my opinion, just this little guy (me, us) vs. the big guys way of thinking. People laughed and ridiculed László Kovács's statement ""Merjünk kicsik lenni"" (Dare to be small!) and they don't realize 90% of the country is subconsciously living by those words.  

Until not long ago I would've said that maybe our generation is a glimmer of hope and in a way it is, but sadly I'm seeing more and more of my friends and acquaintances choosing to adapt to the status quo as we are nearing 30.

Your comment suggested US companies were going to be able to ram US regulation down Europe's throat. I was providing a counter point, that often European companies sue under them. but an ISDS is not required to sue. Fujitsu recently won a $1.2 billion judgement against the UK's NHS, and German car companies sued the US state of California claiming its diesel particulate emissions standards were ""too strict"" and claiming it did not have the right to set more stringent regulations than the Federal EPA. None of these claims were brought though an ISDS. The ISDS would move these claims into an international tribunal, but without one it is not as if these causes of action will disappear. And if based on a contract, it is likely the company will win as is seen in the Fujitsu case. 

&gt;Evidence, what are you basing your claim on?

Your own link claims there have also links there has been criticism for it being too tough on industry. All government bodies get criticism.

3 Jahre normalerweise. Allein für den Führerschein 9 Monate. Nagut - hier kann ich dir im Zweifel Recht geben. 

&gt; Ist die Arbeit durch techniche Maßnahmen ersetzbar?

Hier ist der Status Quo im Moment ganz klar: Nein. Die längste Automatische Strecke ist etwa 70km lang und eine Metro-Linie. 
Zukünftig wird sich das ändern. Wann genau ist noch nicht abzusehen. 

&gt; Ist die Qualität der Technologie genauso gut oder besser?

Es gibt Weltweit noch keine längeren Zugstrecken die autonom fahren. Es gibt Forschung dazu und das wird sicher kommen (sicherlich zuerst für Güterzüge) und was in 30 Jahren wage ich nicht festzuzerren. Mein Tipp ist: Personenverkehr bzw. der überwiegende Bahnverkehr wird weiterhin per Mensch gefahren werden - dann aber mit Autopilot. 

Auch wenn Google und Co. und die Nachrichtenportale einen gerne glauben lassen wollen, dass wir schon in der Zukunft leben ist die Technologie noch nicht so weit, dass man damit _alle_ Lokführer abschaffen könnte. Das wird sicherlich kommen bzw. bei Neubaustrecken und Modernisierungen immer stärker berüchtigsigt werden. Aber momentan gibt es eine Alternative.  

Wie gesagt der Job ist nicht so einfach. Wenn du die Verantwortung für 200-300 Menschen hast und mit 200km/h fährst und mit Suiziden rechnen musst gegen die du nichts tun kannst... Es gibt Jobs die ähnlich gut bezahlt werden und weitaus weniger psychische Anforderungen haben.

Your predictions are meaningless.

&gt; it won't matter what American sanctions are in place if the EU reestablishes full relations with Russia 

We will move in unison on this issue.

&gt; That's BS - plenty of countries reject independence movements that are not backed by foreign powers. Catalunya was in the papers again this week - they've voted countless times to fuck off from Spain. 

I can't for the life of me understand what you're babbling about here - are you on drugs? You're not making any sense.

&gt; nobody gives a shit about international law

Incorrect. Instead, nobody in the international community or the UN cares about some ridiculous puny little Putin troll on the internet.

&gt; did anybody go to the Hague for the fire bombing of Dresden?

The ICC didn't exist yet. The framework of international law as we know it today didn't exist yet.

&gt; The Maoist purges? the Japanese massacres in China? Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Russia's atrocities in Chechnya? the US's atrocities in Vietnam? 

It's certainly true that due to the power balance in the world, sometimes greater powers escape punishment or judgment. Putin, however, as is apparent, currently cannot afford to stay the course and alienate a hundred countries around the world (the number that voted against the Crimean referendum as illegal), the entire EU and remain kicked out of the G8.

Russia is currently being punished, and Putin's circle of oligarchs are seeing their assets melt away.

&gt; again - the victors write the history books and make the rules 

And again - unless there is a third party taking notes - the UN.

&gt; there is a difference between me running somebody over with my car and the white collar crimes on Wall Street

Nah.

&gt; if you're powerful enough and have the right connections you're never punished for your actions 

Currently, Putin is being punished for his actions.

This involves erecting a tree with a wreath at the top. And of course there's also the Christmas Tree.

Odin/Donar is associated with the oak not only through the varios ""Donnereichen"", but there are also proverbs like ""Eichen sollst du weichen, Buchen sollst du suchen"" (shun oaks, seek beeches) during a thunderstorm.

Die Bewertung des Nandu als Brutvogel in Deutschland ist selbst in Naturschutzkreisen sehr unterschiedlich. So wird die Auflösung der Bestände, also Tötung aller Nandus, gefordert. Dies wird mit dem Vorsorgeprinzip begründet, da der Nandu sich als invasive Art erweisen könnte. Als invasive Arten werden nach Bundesnaturschutzgesetz (BNatSchG) § 40 solche Arten deklariert, die heimische Ökosysteme, Biotope und Arten gefährden. Dem Nandu wird Invasionspotenzial zugeschrieben, weil eine Gefährdung anderer Bodenbrüter und Bodenfauna nicht auszuschließen sei.[4] Andere Experten wollen den Nandu auf die Graue Liste setzen. Auf die Graue Liste sollen potenziell invasive Arten gesetzt werden, um diese durch die Behörden beobachten zu lassen. Bisher geäußerte Befürchtungen von einer möglichen Gefährdung von Bodenbrütern, Reptilien und Insekten haben sich bisher durch Feldforschungen und Magenuntersuchungen nicht bestätigt. Nach § 40 Abs. 2 BNatSchG muss vor Bekämpfungs-Maßnahmen erst geklärt werden, ob eine Art tatsächlich invasiv ist, also heimische Ökosysteme, Biotope und Arten gefährdet.[5]",0,1415210278,null,0,false,0,cltu7d9,t3_2ld4h1,t1_cltu7d9,t1_clts7v0,null,1426177426,4,false,de,t5_22i0,4
false,angry_spaniard,ESPR,Delenda est monarchia,"&gt; Out of interest, how accurate are opinion polls in Spain generally?

They are accurate to a certain point. They sort of agree in the raw data. But the cooking is varying a lot. And it's logic as we are in uncharted waters, from the government poll the one that favours more the ruling PP ([official 38 pages pdf in Spanish](http://cdn.20minutos.es/adj/2014/11/05/3009.pdf)):

* PP: 11% of the polled people answered that would vote them, 27.5% after cooking.
* PSOE: 14.3% of the polled people answered that would vote them, translated to a 23.9% in elections. 
* Podemos: 17.9% of the polled people answered that would vote them, translated to a 22.5% after cooking.
* United Left: 3,7% of the polled people answered that would vote them, translated to a 4,8%.
* UPyD: 2,1% of the polled people answered that would vote them, translated to a 4,1%.

It's hard to work with this material, the people that declares that will vote to the PP is disappearing at a pace even quicker than Podemos is growing; Podemos is mostly growing from the left and centrist mostly people that didn't vote in the last elections or PSOE or IU. It's hard to see what the conservative voters that declare that the won't vote again to the PP will do.

UPyD, that party founded by Rosa Díez, when she lost the internal elections to the PSOE, is trying to target them without the same level of sucess as Podemos.


&gt; When is the next real electoral test that Podemos will face? 

25th of May of 2015: Municipal elections in all the country. And regional elections in ten autonomous regions.

The party isn't going to trust its bases to participate in the local elections. But, it's going to encourage the participation in voters associations candidatures. In fact the mentor of the leader, may become the candidate to the municipal elections in one for Madrid. [Pablo Iglesias announced that he would back him](http://www.publico.es/552290/iglesias-propone-a-monedero-como-alcalde-de-madrid)

[The party got 200,000 members in almost no time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podemos_%28Spanish_political_party%29#Membership_history), becoming the second biggest party in Spain by membership. However, the leadership doesn't trust them; they don't have to pay membership fees and many come from other parties with their own agenda. They had problems in Galicia with the influx of left wing nationalist(mostly former members of Anova and BNG) that took over local circles and ignored the official party line

&gt; the success of Podemos was extremely surprising in that election, to outside observers). 

There is a lot of left leaning people at Spain, and the official left is corrupt, pro-austerity and disorganized since the lost of the 2011 elections.And United Left was in a bad situation, with a very unpopular candidate that later was discovered using Luxembourg for tax avoidance(legally).

false,tmore,SLOV,Slovenia,"You do not understand the concept of socialism which needs centralisation if it should work the way it is supposed to. It necessarily warrants a power concentration in a political centre as it is unable to manage the economy (i.e. redestribute wealth) without  stemming from a few individuals who are deemed the central planners. You either control the economy from a centre or you let the market run. No middle ground. And let me stress again, there is no other way to impose socialism today but by authoritarian measures. Do you think you would convince factory owners and capitalists to just hand over what many have not inherited but worked extremely hard (much harder than a normal factory worker) for. And stop being condecending, not every super-rich person is evil personified nor have all of them inherited their wealth (see above).

Why would technology necessitate socialism? That is an oximoron. If anything, socialist countries today are technological backwaters and the countries deemed neoliberal are the ones who lead in the technology race.

The fault in redistribution lies in this: To redistribute ""fairly"" someone always suffers. And when someone decides who suffers, it is normally the ones who differ from someone's world view, who do. Even if, someone has good intentions, he must take from one to give to the other. Redistribution is thus never fair. And when man's selfish nature is involved, the one doing the redistributing will always look after himself first. A capitalist system hasn't a rule-bending system like this integrated in it, though I admit, it is far from perfect and people with more money tend to find loopholes. That being said, capitalism is aware of it's imperfection, socialism is not. Socialism also predicts all people are good and altruistic, it blatanly refuses to see most people for who they are, selfish and self-serving (not all people are like that). I shall demonstrate this in the following paragraph.

As for not being able to climb on the social ladder you are false again. There has never been a better system for rewarding dilligence as we the system we have now. True, you could jump from a worker to the head of state in a matter of months in socialism, if only you wore the right colours. Some people were not like this, and even if they worked hard, they couldn't climb the social ladder and were many times (because of their political views) even pushed down. Today, despite many leftist arguments, we might not start with the same predispositions, but we all have the means to achieve almost anything we wish for, provided we work hard for it. I have to stress, that while writing the last sentence I have not taken into account some features like personality traits of individuals and or just their bad luck, that play a crucial role in the afore-mentioned process. But you must see the clear difference, in socialism a person decides your future, in a capitalist system your future is decided by yourself or by unforseen forces. And as long as there is a person involved in your life like that, they have all the power to make you rich or poorer then you ever were.

So it is either funny or disturbing, I chose funny. 

As for the comment that high percentage of articles in Serbia is related to Albania, I really haven't noticed that. Of course if we don't consider articles about Edi Rama's visit and these recent things on the football game, there is no or very little news about Albania and Albanians in Serbian media. News that have Albanians in them are usually from Kosovo, and this is due to constant incidents there, corruption, civil disturbances etc...So...yeah...

And you quoted the comment that said:""Koço Danaj is known ONLY for his outings on the Serbian media."" I don't know man, I searched for that name on Google and found interviews with him in Albanian language. 

And lastly you say that no one in Albania talks about Great Albania, sure, I believe you. No one in Serbia during the '90s talked about Greater Serbia or I don't know, I guess no one in Russia is talking about Imperialist Russia etc. Also there is a fact that some Albanian politicians talked openly and publicly about that, like Sali Berisha for example. My point is: that idea exists as a concept and there are people who take that concept seriously. So you know, lets talk about that. Why not? Why get all defensive about it?

Germans typically order dishes at Asian restaurants by numbers, not by names (and there is even a recent play that pokes fun at the matter - Roland Schimmelpfennig's Die goldene Drache).  

I think there might be a market for authentic Asian food in the Frankfurt area, just because there are so many bankers and stuff who have moved around, spent lots of time in Asia, etc., but I don't know if the food truck idea would work so well there.  Maybe at lunchtime, but even then, lunch is traditionally the hot meal of the day.

Korean food could work well, just because of the huge focus on umami flavors that Germans love so much and the fact that there are many excellent teas, but the ""I don't know much about Korea or Korean food"" hurdle is going to be a big one.  North Americans get spoiled just because of the fact that America and Canada are so diverse, so even as a little kid, you get exposed to many different cultures and many different foods.  That's really not the case for a lot of Germany, and in many cases, I am the first foreigner that a lot of my friends have gotten to know on a personal level.  

Heck, even when I am visiting my fiancé's family in Niederbayern, if we want to go out for *Italian* food, we have to drive 10-15 minutes; the only option in their village or the two or three closest villages is traditional German food.  Even in the US, my mom, who is in her mid 60s, ate pizza for the first time in the 1970s, and the town closest to where she grew up in in Iowa didn't get a McDonald's until the late 1980s or early 1990s.

This is not sham marriage legislation. It is legislation setting out the rights the spouses get in the context of genuine marriages.

In the UK we have the following legislation:

&gt; [A marriage (whether or not it is void) is a “sham marriage” if—.
(a)either, or both, of the parties to the marriage is not a relevant national,.
(b)there is no genuine relationship between the parties to the marriage, and.
(c)either, or both, of the parties to the marriage enter into the marriage for one or more of these purposes—.
(i)avoiding the effect of one or more provisions of United Kingdom immigration law or the immigration rules;.
(ii)enabling a party to the marriage to obtain a right conferred by that law or those rules to reside in the United Kingdom.](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/22/section/55/enacted).

It is designed to ensure that people don't use marriage purely as a way of circumventing immigration laws.

**Prague**

 - every place is within 5 minutes of walk from bus station.
 - During rush hours Metro every two minutes, 20 minutes in the late evening
 - through the night there are night buses and trams


**Bigger Cities**

 - every city above cca 15 000 people has its own public transportation
 - usually buses/trams. cca 10 min intervals (bigger cities, rush hours)
 - night travel could be difficult(except Brno and Ostrava). You would need a taxi.
 
**Innerstate transportation**

- Small story: I was in south France during September and I wanted to visit Gordes(small, turistic village). There was no public transport except for summer months. I haven't encountered something like this here.

- you can get literally anwhere. Every city(&gt;30 000) has its own main railway station. If not, It will have bus terminal.

- I haven't seen a village without a bus station. But it might be sometimes difficult(no weekend service)

- transport between close cities (&gt;50 000, ~70km far) is usually every one or two hours(by train). Closer-&gt; more frequent
- to get to small villages could be tricky. Cca every two hours and usually by bus.
 
**Summary**

- I used to have car, I have moved to Prague and I don't need it anymore.

- It is sometimes difficult(in border areas especially) but you can plan your trip ahead on

You make a very compelling argument. America *is* fascist, much thanks to Putin for trying to stop them. Where would the world be without Russia providing freedom to the oppressed? I certainly dont want to live in that world. 

* Lets do a little exercise. Lets take the average Human Development Index score for the countries recognizing Crimea. Now lets do the same for the ""fascist"" coalition against ISIS. 

* Exercise two. Lets do the same for freedom of press. You can pick what index you want to use. Despite being far more countries in the ""fascist"" coalition, lets add up total murdered reporters as well. 

* Probably a good idea to use World Bank statistics to do the same for economic freedom and rule of law indexes as well. 

* Given poverty is often associated with fascism, lets do average wages as well.

When you're trying to pinpoint Hitler - he crafted a nationalist alternative to socialism, (""Nazi"" instead of ""Sozi"") anti-semitism was a core belief along with white European superiority. (I don't believe Aryan really covers it, imo)

Anti-semitism also correlated closely with his so-called ""socialism"": the ""evil Jews"" supposedly held all the capital and the assets, causing massive resentment. To an extent, yes, the Jewish diaspora in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands - the diamond trade, banking, etc. did wield a large influence. 

Along with the humiliation of the First World War and the financial crisis of 1929; there you have the ingredients for Hitler's ascenscion.

Anti-multiculturalism doesn't necessarily mean feelings of racial superiority. It could be directed against Poles or Italians. It simply means you have a national culture which you wish to preserve in the face of mass immigration.

We have very good news, investigative formats(Monitor, Frontal 21 etc) and documentaries that are in many regards a lot better than pretty much anything on TV in the US. But large amounts of GEZ money are wasted on shows that have been outdated for 20 years and no one under 40 watches. However! I have not lost hope, for example the ""ZDF neo"" channel has a number of interesting/entertaining shows (joko and klaas had a show there which Circus halligalli is based on and was much better. Also ""Neo Magazin"" is great in my opinion). 
There are also little pearls like ""Tatortreiniger"" on NDR. So over time ARD/ZDF might come around with the entertainment site of things and pull of a ""Luther"" or a ""Sherlock"". 

However, the problem remains that most young people who care for quality TV shows watch (very few select) US/British shows anyway so they might have lost many people there already. I hope they orient themselves more towards the BBC, which seems to be able to pull of both high quality news, information/documentaries and excellent entertainment shows (although they might be overdoing the panel shows a bit?). 

Schlag den Raab is decently entertaining if watched together with friends because Raab is so easy to hate, so you root for the candidate, however in recent episodes they always picked a women who was clearly incapable of winning, so that ruined it for me.

What do you think delayed the new ICE trains and their replacement, the ICX? It's the security systems that are different in every country (and the different power systems there to a small amount). It's largely because there is no standard for the infrastructure in europe, and these trains have to work with every system, there must not be any moment when crossing borders where the train is not monitored. That caused a huge headache to the engenieers and software developers. 

&gt; the locomotives only, to be precise. 

There are almost no locomotives + unpowered wagons anymore, the front end (the part that is usually called 'locomotive') usually contains the cockpit+safety electronics+power electronics, but the 'wagons' also contain power transformers and especially engines, [picture](http://www.haertle.de/out/pictures/master/product/1/piko-40202-triebwagen-talent-2-db-2-tlg-spur-n_p1.jpg). So the whole train has to be changed. Also a license for a regular train lasts a few years until it is allowed to be on the track - so even if a driverless system was available now, it would take at least 4-5 years till you would be able to drive with it.

Ce sont tous ces chercheurs (parfois médecins également, on trouve des professeurs avec deux voire trois doctorats dont celui de médecine) qui font avancer et tendent à expliquer le corps humain.

Par exemple, ce sont bien des chimistes, biochimistes et biologistes (et encore d'autres) qui vont s'intéresser à comprendre le pourquoi d'un symptôme pathologique, ou bien les conséquences d'une mutation sur la physiologie cellulaire et/ou corporelle (entres autres), et aussi de trouver un moyen de régler le problème en synthétisant par exemple un inhibiteur d'une protéine maligne (ici les chimistes entrent en jeu).

Autre exemple concret, la tomodensitométrie (Scanner X), extrêmement utilisée en médecine pour analyser la densité des tissus, a été inventée par deux ingénieurs (Hounsfield et Cormack) et leur a d'ailleurs valu le prix Nobel de médecine, alors qu'aucun n'est médecin.

Pareil, l'IRM, ultra utilisée et une des techniques les plus puissantes aujourd'hui utilisées en médecine, a été inventée par un chimiste et un physicien (Lauterbur et Mansfield), et leur a aussi valu le Nobel de médecine.

Le corps fonctionne d'une manière ULTRA logique et ULTRA régulée, et la seule limite qui nous empêche de tout comprendre, ce sont nos moyens.

Aussi pour ce qui est de la vie extraterrestre, la plupart des scientifiques (qui étudient/dont les compétences permettent d'étudier ou de comprendre ce domaine) s'accordent à dire que la vie est absolument possible ailleurs que sur Terre, d'ailleurs, elle le serait même dans notre système solaire sur Titan (très connu), mais aussi sur d'autres satelittes comme Europe ou Encelade, pourraient abriter la vie (attention, un organisme vivant ne signifie pas forcément un monsieur, une simple cellule comme une bactérie est un organisme vivant par définition).

En gros, il y a ""éduqué"" et éduqué, dans le sens ou oui, on peut très bien être éduqué, mais si on n'y connait rien à un domaine, on y connait rien, et du coup on affirme des choses qu'on croit véridique, alors qu'elles ne le sont pas du tout (et on s'auto-persuade que l'on est intellectuellement capable de poser des conclusions, alors que ça n'est clairement pas le cas).

Par exemple, tu crois que c'est la médecine qui étudie le cerveau humain ou les bactéries du système digestif, alors que ça n'est pas du tout le cas.
La médecine c'est, grossièrement, soigner des gens à partir de savoir eux complètement scientifiques et clairement démontrés et établis.

EDIT: Et il y a aussi une différence notable entre croire en quelque chose de plausible mais non démontré et quelque chose de totalement abhérent (type passer sous une échelle donne la poisse).
En soit la croyance peut tout aussi bien être corrélée avec l'ignorance (car moins les moyens d'infirmer des choses farfelues).",0,1415216690,null,0,1415226848,0,cltxzw6,t3_2lcn34,t1_cltxzw6,t1_cltl4c2,null,1426175608,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

     obyczajów pogańskich - Dziadów, czyli przyzywania zmarłych oraz zaspokajania ich potrzeb cielesnych.
     Na grobach stawiano wówczas pokarmy, którymi mieli posilić się zmarli. Palony ogień miał natomiast odstraszać
    zjawy oraz upiory, a także wskazywać naszym zmarłym drogę do domów, a następnie w zaświaty. Wierzono także
    w ogrzewanie się dusz przy palonych dla nich płomieniach.""


this translates into something like this:

    ""The symbolism of grave candles we light is a bit different. Custom of starting a fire on graves originates from
     pagan tradition - *Dziady*, that is the summoning of dead and meeting their bodily needs. 
    During *Dziady*, people used to put food, that the dead were supposed to eat, on the graves. Fire lit then was on                     
    the other hand supposed to scare off wights and vampires (there is no translation for their ""earlier version"" in our 
    culture, even wikipedia uses ""vampire"". *Upiór* is more of a general word for scary undead folks or something like 
    this, while *wampir* is a vampire nowadays), and show our dead the way home and afterwards - to the 
    netherworld. It was also believed that souls warmed themselves by the fire lit for them.""


Jeez, translating culture stuff is hard, so sorry if I messed something up. The author of article also used some constructions that have no equivalents in English (or I'm just too stupid to know them). If you want to know more, google up things like *Zaduszki* or *Dziady*.

If that's what you mean I agree with you. Pasteurisation changes the taste a lot. Back when I was still living in Germany I used to have milk in glass bottles. This milk was only slightly heated and for a shorter time and then bacteria were removed with some microfiltration. But here in Scotland there is no milk like this. But I was still quite fussy about milk in Germany because when I was wee I drank lots of milk straight from the farm.

false,votapmen,SRPS,Република Српска — Republika Srpska,"&gt;For the last two years, some Bosniak parents in the Serb-dominated Republika Srpska (Serb Republic) have boycotted state schools — demanding that their children be taught separately and according to an explicitly Bosniak curriculum.

Contrasted with the rest of the article, this pretty much sums up the self-carricature that is modern day Bosnia and Herzegovina.

In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosniaks are advocating a single curriculum, where there are different ones in place. E.g. Bosniak children follow a Bosniak curriculum, while Croat children follow a Croat curriculum (of course, a Croat kid could follow a Bosniak curriculum if it wanted too, the same way a Bosniak kid could follow a Croat curriculum).

However, in Republika Srpska, where there's a single curriculum, Bosniaks are protesting that their children aren't allowed to follow a separate curriculum from the Serb children — i.e. their right of their children to be segregated in schools is taken away from them.

I guess what would be the best is for there to be a single curriculum on the state level, which could be dictated by Bosniaks as a dominant group.

**EDIT:** Just to clarify, the decision was not made by the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, second-highest court at the state level, after the Constitutional court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but rather by the Supreme court of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia and Herzegovina is comprised of two entities — Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (51% of territory) and Republika Srpska (49%), with a District of Brčko existing as an entity shared between the two ""main"" entities.",0,1415218862,null,0,1415219499,0,cltzah3,t3_2le4ns,t1_cltzah3,t3_2le4ns,null,1426174980,-6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-6

Et lorsque tu prendra une décision, fais attention à ce qu'elle soit prise pour développer ton activité et non pas pour te faire plaisir. Lorsque l'on monte sa première boite on a en général une idée très arrêté de ce qu'il faut faire notamment parce qu’on a envie de le faire. Ce qui compte c'est de faire ce qui fera vendre et malheureusement c'est parfois à l'opposé de ce que l'on pensait faire.

Why not make fun of silly people regardless of nation? 

&gt; I think last time i visited /r/Serbia even talking about Kosovo's recognition was off the table .

Sure. But don't hold me responsible for someone else's behavior.

You want to know what I think? Here it is: I think people from Kosovo are same as people like in any other place. I think all or most of them want simple things, that anybody would want: a job, enough money to live comfortably, have a nice home, have friends and family and generaly to enjoy life. And I think they have every right to that and I wish that every person in Kosovo can lead a life that they think is worth living, if it doesn't include hurting others of course. I also think that Serbia should recognize independence of Kosovo, like, right away. If we look at things practically, disregarding any ""emotions"", nationalism and all that bullshit, and just look at things practically: people of Kosovo would live better if they stayed within Serbia, but people of Serbia as a whole would live worse. 

So those are my thoughts, hopes and wishes, but unfortunately reality is very bleak. Kosovo is kinda like Europe's orphaned child. USA got a military base there, they got what they wanted, and now nobody really gives a fuck about lives of ordinary people. Corruption is rampant, criminals are running the show, politicians are ""in bed"" with mobsters, horrible deeds go unpunished. EU put the EULEX mission there to secure the rule of law, but as we see they also got corrupted. That's what really bugs me. That it looks like bad guys won, and nobody gives a fuck. And when I say bad guys, I don't mean Albanians of course, I mean criminals.

And that notion that all people of one nation should live in one country is ridiculous and so backwards to me. We saw to what it leads, if '90s weren't enough for some people to learn that, I really don't know what should happen...

For anyone out there that actually cares about what's happening here:

- ""2 schools under 1 roof"" is a bizarre practice left over in a few places from right after the war where it was supposed to be the first step to integration but never moved past it. In essence it ended up being 2 schools with their own full blown administration sharing a single building with kids separated by ethnicity. 

- The solution here has been implementation of the so-called ""national group of classes"" in places where there is interests from parents and enrolled students. This means that students attend all but few of classes together (think math, physics, arts, PE, etc) but are allowed to study their own language, literature, history and religion. 

- What the liar above is trying to imply is that Bosniaks are somehow against a single curriculum in one place and for it in another. This is not true. Serbs are disallowing the above-described ""national group of classes"" and forcing Bosniak children to study serb language, history and religion even in places where they form an absolute majority let alone sufficiently large minority. 
One of the examples being the schools in Konjevic Polje - Bosniaks form 55% of the students yet 15% of staff are Bosniaks, Bosnian language or other classes from the national group of classes are banned by serb hardliners. Even the serb run court in Srebrenica ruled in favor of the Bosniak parents.

- Contrast this with the treatment of serbs elsewhere where special classes were formed for as few as 10 children (regional school in Ivanjica in Ravno municipality) with other countless examples in dozens upon dozens of schools in (Bosanska Krupa, Bosansko Grahove, B. Petrovac, Sanski Most, Lukavac, Drvar, Glamoc, Ravno etc etc etc)

&gt;Sure. But don't hold me responsible for someone else's behavior.

Yep all you did was call Edi Rama ugly :D.

I have no clue of whats happening with EULEX and Kosovo's government but i think we all hate our current governments in Balkan.

Since this is just you and me talking here now , i think you're not living up to your pacifist words just by talking a look at your link submission history consisting of mostly Albanian related links . Now i know most of us Balkanics are only here to promote our country but that's not how you do it . That way you give me the impression that you don't really want peace and consensus .

I'd rather argue with someone who disagrees with me but is sincere than agree with someone who secretly doesn't feel the same way i do.

Nah, there is a flaw in your thinking. Look at those links again and tell me what they are talking about. EULEX corruption mostly. Why is posting things about EULEX mission corruption case ""anti-Albanian""? Albanian criminals are good simply because they are Albanian? Or they are bad because they are criminals? EU should help people of Kosovo. But how does it do it? Very badly in my opinion. Letting criminals free won't make anybody happy, Albanian or Serb. Look at that case that I posted, killers of **Albanian** man were released for 300 000 euros.
If you want to talk about Serbian war criminals, fine by me. But don't suggest to me that we shouldn't talk about those things simply not to offend somebody.

If you think I am not honest, that's OK. I will not going to try persuade that I am. But you should not feel obliged to defend criminals simply because they are Albanian.

-That event you just said. We were about to go to war with the greatest empire at the time. Literally. 

So...long ago, by order:
- Reconquista, Vimara Peres went bezerk and conquered a lot of land,  helping create the first County of Portucale.
- D. Afonso Henriques , our first king, gave no f*cks. Fought his mother and conquered everything up to Lisbon, and then took Lisbon.
- We decided to go around Africa because why not to steal the trade benefits from Venice and the Arabs. We managed to do that, and we just a few ships with cannons we gained control of the entire trade network of the indian and arabian seas.  
- Our clearly idiotic king Sebastian the first, decided that it was pretty cool to invade Morocco with no heir. He died and we went to Spain.
- Spain destroyed our armada and we didn't like them so revolution anyway even though we could be destroyed. Got lucky.
- Napoleon decides to invade Portugal. Our king is a pussy and runs to Brazil. Our british friends help us fight them, they tried three times, the only thing they like to remember is our francesinha when they visit us.
- The episode you refered of the pink map. So pink we decided our king needed to paint it red. With is blood. And his son's blood.Viva a republica? 
- Republicans think world war I is for cool people. We send loads of troops with barely a shirt on. They die like flies. Proud anyway?
- Salazar. Oh man that guy was nuts. He basically played with Hitler, put Franco in power (he hoped to break Spain), then supported the west at the same time, then decided we should go full fascist and have a massive colonial war with 5 countries at the same time. Then he fell of a chair. The regime lasted a bit and we had a revolution.

In /r/frankfurt hat letztens ein Ausländer danach gefragt, wo der beste Puff in Frankfurt ist; er kommt aus einem Land, in dem Prostitution verboten ist und wollte es mal ausprobieren. Da war ich erstmal etwas schockiert. Ich hatte da eher die schwedische Haltung (Prostitution ist dort verboten, aber nur die Freier müssen mit Strafe rechnen.) Ich habe mich dann gefragt, wieso Schweden und Deutsche da so unterschiedlich denken. Meine Hypothese war, dass die Schweden mehr von ihren Männern erwarten. Schweden hat eine der höchsten Rate von [Casual Sex](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casual_Sex) in Europa (neben Norwegen). Und ich muss sagen, spontaner Sex, den beide Parteien genießen, gefällt mir deutlich besser als Prostitution.

Aber dann dachte ich, das was mir an Prostitution nicht gefällt, ist die Tatsache, dass die Frauen keine Alternative haben. Prostitution ist quasi die letzte Möglichkeit Geld zu verdienen, wenn man sonst nichts kann. Prinzipiell habe ich nichts dagegen, wenn jemand für Sex bezahlt. Insbesondere, wenn es guter Sex ist (in der heutigen Situation ist das allerdings fraglich). Und dieser Artikel hat mich darin bestätigt.

Wie sähe also meine perfekte Welt aus? Prostitution ist ein anerkannter Beruf für Männer und Frauen, für den es eine mindestens dreijährige Ausbildung gibt, in der man Techniken lernt, aber auch Umgangsformen. Das Ziel ist es, einen umfangreichen Service anzubieten, wie eine Wellness-Klinik.

Ein von Männern oft gefragter Service ist dann vermutlich eine Kurtisane, die sich im Liebesspiel unterwürfig verhält. Ich denke darauf soll dieser Satz abzielen:

&gt; Was wir an Hörigkeit den Erwartungen der Welt gegenüber lernen, als Kinder in diesem Schulsystem und später in der Welt aus Studium und Ausbildung, bereitet dich perfekt auf den Puff vor.

Aber ich sehe das nicht als Problem. Unterwürfigkeit ist nicht gleich Schwäche. Das Internet hat mich gelehrt, dass [Frauen dominante Männer sehr anregend finden](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/13uqk2/my_howto_guide_for_men_on_how_to_dominate_a_woman/) solange es sich auf das Liebesspiel beschränkt.

So, yes, fines have been enforced, and money received, and this according to the Catalan government itself. The parliament archives are unfortunately not online, but there isn't any reason not to believe that the precise amounts quoted in that El Mundo article aren't correct.

&gt; Also, choosing elmundo as a source speaks lots about how we'll never agree on what's true or fale.

I choose all sorts of different sources and I take them all with a pinch of salt. But in this particular case El Mundo quoted an official answer of the Catalan government to a parliamentary question, and that sort of thing, as I've just shown, can be easily cross-checked.

Of course, you can continue believing what government officials or other politicians say at face value and without questioning it, and dismissing newspapers just because those politicians tell you to...",0,1415226099,null,0,false,0,clu3oul,t3_2l9irl,t1_clu3oul,t1_cltvhrr,null,1426172927,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

false,MonsieurAlbert,S971,Guadeloupe,"Des heures de soutien absolument. Aide aux devoirs, méthodologie, aide à la recherche documentaire etc. Je trouve ça complètement fou qu’en dehors des heures de cours les élèves soient laissés à la charge de la vie scolaire. Là où je me trouve actuellement, on a chacun notre salle (top !), ce serait donc non seulement envisageable mais sans problème du point de vue logistique.

Sinon concernant les temps de prépa / corrections / réunions / rencontre avec les parents etc., avant de faire mes 18 heures en collège, j’en faisais 27 en conservatoire, sur 3 structures différentes (tu ajoutes les temps de transport et tu multiplies par 3 les examens, bulletins, carnets, réunions, auditions, concerts de fin d’année etc.). Hé ben je ne vais pas te mentir : en ce moment j’ai l’impression d’être à mi-temps.

Des cours de 50 minutes avec 10 minutes de battement… On n'enchaine jamais plus de 4 heures de cours… Interclasse toutes les deux heures… Deux heures et demie de pause le midi !! Pour moi c’est l’hallu. Pour te donner une idée, le mercredi je donnais 10 heures de cours d'affilée avec une unique pause de 45 minutes pour bouffer, et comme tout le monde je faisais ma prépa à la maison. Par contre c'est vrai que je n'avais pas de corrections (mais les profs de formation musicale si). Cours particuliers d’1/2 heure (suivi personnalisé d’office, 5 heures de cours = 10 cours différents), aucun interclasse… Plus les cours de musique d’ensemble… Plus l’entretien et le suivi du parc instrumental, gestion des commandes, appels d’offre, devis… Et au quotidien on doit continuer à travailler son instrument et à vivre sa vie de musicien avec ses répétitions, concerts, jury etc. Pour moi c’était déjà la belle vie (pas mal de travail mais autant de vacances et le boulot est super). Là, je trouve qu'il y a quand même de la marge.

Alors certes j’ai 20 ans de métier, je suis bien rodé et c’est vrai que je suis d’un naturel efficace, mais bon. 18 heures, je trouve ça franchement à l’aise, même s’il y a de temps en temps des coups de bourre. En plus avec l’informatique c’est vraiment relax de s’organiser aujourd’hui ! Et pour enfoncer le clou, en éducation musicale on n’a pas de manuel, je dois donc rédiger tous mes cours. Mais quand tu compares ça au boulot que demandent les classes de primaire par exemple, ça reste vraiment super méga ultra tranquille. Après je n’ai jamais été en lycée, c'est peut être plus difficile. Peut être aussi que si les profs étaient eux-mêmes mieux formés à des méthodologies de prépa / correction / organisation avant d’être jetés devant une classe, ça leur ferait globalement moins peur d’envisager faire plus d’heures ?

En tout cas ce que je constate actuellement c’est que mes élèves ont des journées plus chargées que les miennes et sont objectivement plus fatigués que moi.

Après je concède que les photocopies sont un point noir. Si ton établissement n’a pas plusieurs machines rapides ou un service de reprographie à disposition, ça devient vite un gouffre temporel + source de stress, y compris entre collègues. Mon conseil : imprimante laser et frais réels. Tu peux aussi demander une ramette aux élèves en début d’année avec ta liste de fournitures.

Pour conclure, la seule fatigue réelle que je ressens c’est celle liée au temps perdu à faire de la discipline, et je pense que si on était plus impliqués, concrètement, dans la réussite des élèves au-delà de nos propres cours, et qu'on les côtoyait un peu plus, on aurait aussi moins de soucis de ce côté là.

There are micro- and macro-factors to it - see the link (German). The terms are standard - you can ask realtors or go to the IHK (chamber of commerce) to find out where they are. Cross-check the location of potential stores to make sure this is really what you want. You don't need German for this. If your gut tells you the location is right, go for it. But this needs to be an informed decision after some days of thinking all aspects over.

Broaden your search - try to get 1A regardless of the city, instead of accepting worse locations in a specific city. 2A is the minimum to accept, never a 1B or 2B location. Better 1A in Heilbronn than 1B in Berlin. All rising stores follow this principle. This [elite burger chain](http://www.hig-hn.de/) is a good example. Very, very strong growth.

[This guy here](http://www.hotalo.com/locations.html) could be your role model. Started in Stuttgart in a tiny place, but excellent location. Even before he had several stores, he had a Rolls-Royce with driver.

&gt; I personally dont believe there will be large scale military intervention on a NATO member like in ukraine, my thoughts are more on building enough public discontent or at least the illusion of one to cause some sort c

Well there are multiple theories why all this is going on. My personal favorites.

1) Putin's own ambition. He is one of those types that simply likes the 'Me against windmills' idea and fight.

2) Russian national economy. Russia likes to create frozen conflicts to keep nations tied to Russia, kind of like a bargaining chip for political and economical play. They are like a really bitchy wife. 50% divorce split is not enough and she still tries to scratch your car and take your dog. Another problem being if one nation leaves others might as well.

Realistically in case of Estonia the only fear is, as usual, stupid people. Stupid people who believe Kremlin propaganda and follow it. Thankfully our economy is slightly above Russia itself and most see through any kind of ""Estonian fascists!"" ""Russians second rate citizens!"" BS Russia goes for. So no real incentive or drive to rile up those who feel they belong among Slavs.

Having said that we saw with our Bronze night where moving a statue did manage to rile up plenty of people who gobbled up the Russian viewpoint. It became more or less Russian views vs Estonian views with Russia throwing their media and some politics behind their guys.

Precedent galore and strong handed political play. This is what Russia is and probably will be in the near future.

We still have plenty of Russian minded people with their St.George ribbons everywhere. Though they are more about expressing their freedoms and less about protesting against the state, at least that is what I feel.

Then again Putin is 62. He will either go out with some sort of blast (if Ukraine wasn't already it) or slowly start fading away from politics due to general age.

They have a lot of assets, investments and get help from the state. Smaller and independent Churches are in the same position as Mosques. They're not organised with a large institutions behind them and they are run by local communities usually from immigrant communities from Africa or Asia. Just like Muslims they also depend on foreign benefactors helping them especially religious American organisations.

I personally have a solution to this, it might be controversial though. Why not sell off empty Church buildings two both communities.

2 - the vast majority of EEA migrants do not work in *job-creating* fields like tech and science which have the ability to GROW the economy. This report just looks at their net tax receipts.

3 - given that almost all EEA migrants are presently of working age it is not all that impressive that there is a net tax gain of £4bn. As economists *should* know, people take from the system whilst children or retired, and contribute to it greatly whilst of working age. The per worker contribution must therefore be extremely low (which is not surprising given that most EEA migrants are in low-pay, low-value added jobs).

L’onorevole Marco Di Stefano, che secondo “Il Messaggero” di oggi è indagato per corruzione per le tangenti Enpam, era presente alla Leopolda in pompa magna. Ha coordinato il tavolo numero 4, sabato 25 ottobre, dedicato ai “pagamenti elettronici”.
 
Ovviamente si spera che sia innocente e non abbia preso alcuna mazzetta. Ma se dovesse, per coerenza ci si aspetta che non l’abbia presa in contanti alla vecchia maniera.

Una maxitangente da oltre due milioni di euro per la vendita all’Enpam di due immobili a Roma. E a finire sotto inchiesta per corruzione è un parlamentare del Pd, Marco Di Stefano, ex assessore al Demanio della giunta Marrazzo. Di Stefano, secondo due testimoni, avrebbe intascato un milione e 800mila per aver assicurato alle società dei costruttori Daniele e Antonio Pulcini due contratti d’affitto a sei zeri per conto della Lazio service, controllata dalla Regione.

Altri 300mila, invece, sarebbero stati consegnati al suo braccio destro. E’ una vicenda molto più complessa contestata dai pm Corrado Fasanelli e Maria Cristina Palaia ai vertici dell’Enpam e ai due imprenditori che, grazie a quei contratti, sono riusciti a vendere all’ente di previdenza dei medici due immobili acquistati pochi mesi prima, facendone lievitare il valore e realizzando plusvalenze rispettivamente del 100% e del 62%.
 
La compravendita aveva già portato nel 2012 a una serie di perquisizioni e all’iscrizione sul registro degli indagati per truffa di Eolo Parodi, ex presidente della Fondazione Enpam. Adesso a Luigi Antonio Caccamo, direttore del dipartimento immobiliare dell’ente che, in cambio dell’affare, avrebbe ottenuto dai Pulcini l’uso di una casa di sei stanze a Trastevere, invece, è accusato di corruzione.
 
Ma gli atti depositati dai pm, dopo gli arresti per un episodio di corruzione legato a una concessione dell’Agenzia del Demanio del Lazio, raccontano rapporti trasversali e disinvolti degli imprenditori con politici ed esponenti delle forze dell’ordine, pronti a velocizzare le pratiche per il certificato antimafia.

Secondo i militari del nucleo di polizia valutaria della Finanza, nell’agosto 2008 Di Stefano, «al solo fine di soddisfare gli interessi economici degli imprenditori Antonio e Daniele Pulcini», avrebbe promosso e autorizzato la ricerca di una nuova sede per Lazio service spa, società partecipata al 100% dalla Regione facendo in modo che la gara fosse aggiudicata alla Belgravia invest srl, riconducibile ai Pulcini, nonostante non avesse né la proprietà né la disponibilità dell’immobile in via Serafico 107 «come richiesto dal bando di gara e altresì che il prezzo pattuito ammontasse a 3milioni e 725mila euro, del tutto esorbitante e fuori mercato».
 
Di Stefano è accusato anche di «avere fatto in modo che venisse documentata la necessità e l’urgenza, contrariamente al vero, di locare un altro immobile attiguo, ubicato in via del Serafico 121 per il trasferimento di altro personale di Lazio service spa, immobile locato anch’esso a un canone esorbitante e fuori mercato da altra società riconducibile agli imprenditori Pulcini, denominata Coedimo». E i pm aggiungono: «Si faceva dare e promettere da Antonio e Daniele Pulcini una somma di denaro pari a un milione e 800mila euro nonché una somma pari a 300mila euro, quest’ultima versata a un suo collaboratore».

E’ il 14 ottobre del 2008 e la commissione patrimonio dell’Enpam prende in esame l’acquisto dell’immobile di via Serafico 107, proposto dalla Belgravia srl dei Pulcini. Ma solo una settimana dopo gli imprenditori firmano un contratto preliminare per comprare il palazzo, prezzo 29 milioni di euro, ma versano solo 2 milioni. Il giorno successivo la Belgravia partecipa al bando della Lazio service per l’affitto, il 15 gennaio 2009 arriva il contratto con l’amministrazione per 3 milioni 725mila euro l’anno. A marzo l’Enpam acquista l’immobile per 58milioni di euro.

It was a bit more than that: it was the obsession with buying and owning property, and it wasn't limited to Irish people just buying property in Ireland, but abroad too. I fear that we haven't quite learned the lessons we ought to have about the construction and property sectors and that we may end up having another property bubble some time in the not so distant future. It's an ultimately destructive drive that I hope we grow out of as a nation.

The one _good_ thing to come out of it though was the infrastructure projects, even if I'm not a big fan of the way they were ran: there was far too much of a dependency on public-private partnerships.

The market in Berlin is overflowing with native speakers of English in your exact same shoes, which has pushed the local freelance market for editing and English teaching down to 8-12€ an hour, pre-taxes.  

In some cities in the east, due to the dearth of native speakers of English, you easily make 25-30€ copyediting and between 30-60€ translating (pre-tax).  In terms of ""any old menial job,"" Germany currently does not have a minimum wage, and there has been a lot of debate over something called a ""Minijob,"" which leaves you with 450€ take-home, but you and your employer work out how many hours you'll work for the pay.  Some low-income workers string together as many as three or four of these to make ends meet.

A few more points: If you have no German address and no emotional or personal connection to the country that a potential employer knows about, then that comes across as a red flag when applying.  (Are you even submitting your job applications in the German style?  It's a bit different than in English-speaking cultures.)  It would make an employer question if you have cultural competence to do OK in the workplace, and the lack of connections means that it will be much harder for you to build up social networks outside of work - meaning that you might not be as happy and will quit.

I think that similar dynamic will effect Europeans. 

Also, studies have come our recently that indicate that [TTIP may lead to large job losses](http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/TTIP%20Jobs.html).. 

Examples:

One study [indicates that up to 600,000 jobs will be lost in the EU as a direct result of TTIP](http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/policy_research/TTIP_simulations.html)


 a recent [review of TTIP studies](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2014/528798/IPOL-JOIN_ET(2014)528798_EN.pdf) by the European Parliamentary Research Service states:

&gt;*""The regulatory core of TTIP makes it extremely difficult for economists to come to grips with the expected economic meaning of the negotiation outcomes. NTBs [Non-tariff barriers] and mere regulatory heterogeneity create ‘trade costs’ for market access, both ways, but it is exceedingly hard to assess authoritatively what the trade costs are, and what consequences they have, whether for goods or services. Yet, without good proxies of those costs and the scope for their reduction, an empirical economic analysis with proper modeling is basically impossible or mere sophisticated ‘guess’ work.”*

 John Hilary of War on Want - [analyzing the CEPR study](http://www.thebrokeronline.eu/Blogs/Employment/TTIP-don-t-mention-the-job-losses):..


&gt;*""at least 1.3 million European workers will lose their jobs as a direct result of the agreement. In addition, over 715,000 US workers also stand to lose their jobs under this scenario, giving a total of over two million job losses in total.'""*

-----

""A [report by ÖFSE,](http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/OFSE%20Study.html) the Austrian Foundation for Development Research, released in April this year, analysed four reports on TTIP [Ecorys (2009), CEPR (2013), CEPII (2013) and Bertelsmann/ifo (2013)] in an attempt to answer some of these issues. It found that:""

&gt;*Costs of unemployment, including long term unemployment, might be substantial, especially during the 10 year transition period of TTIP. Based on projected job displacement in one of the studies of 0.4 – 1.1 million, our rough (and conservative) calculation suggests implied costs of €5 – €14 billion for unemployment benefits, excluding costs for re-training and skills-acquisition. In addition, foregone public income from taxes and social contributions from unemployment might accrue to €4 – €10 billion.*

Ah ben je me disais bien aussi que c'était particulièrement cool dans mon bahut. Ici les gamins commencent à 7h00 du mat' à cause de la chaleur, c'est peut-être pour ça qu'il y a une plus grande pause à midi ? Et pour le coup 10 minutes d'interclasse c'est sûr que c'est mieux que 5.

&gt;Je trouvais personnellement moins fatiguant d'enchainer 8h de traduction que de faire 4h de cours

Itou, enchaîner 8 heures de répét c'est toujours moins crevant que 4 heures de cours (ce que peinent à envisager ceux qui n'ont jamais enseigné). Mais bon, c'est tout aussi vrai qu'avec l'expérience, tu gagnes en efficacité et tu apprends à mieux gérer ton énergie, comme tu maîtrise mieux tes cours et gagnes en autorité etc.

Là je suis particulièrement à l'aise parce que j'ai toujours enseigné la musique, dans des contextes différents et souvent plus exigeant. Mais je ne doute pas que lorsque j'enseignerai enfin l'anglais, j'aurai bien sûr un travail de fou à fournir pendant 3-5 ans avant de trouver à nouveau un rythme de croisière. Comme je sais d'expérience qu'après ça, toute cette énergie sera de nouveau disponible, donc autant la diriger vers les élèves. J'ai assez de temps libre par ailleurs.

Tout ça pour dire que je trouve parfaitement dans l'ordre des choses que les jeunes profs qui s'investissent et bossent énormément avalent un peu de travers quand on leur suggère que 18 heures c'est pas tant que ça. En revanche, je tique quand j'entends quelqu'un qui enseigne depuis des années se plaindre qu'il est toujours charrette et qu'il ne pourrait jamais envisager ajouter 5 heures à son emploi du temps au bénéfice des élèves. À un moment, ça ne devrait pas être tabou de s'interroger sur sa propre efficacité, de la même façon qu'on peut et doit interroger l'organisation des établissements, des programmes, des cours etc. pour essayer de faire un peu avancer le schmilblick.

false,SlyRatchet,null,null,"Well, there's only three major political parties in UK politics, so 2 out of 3 ain't bad. Additionally, the Libs and Labour aren't any worse at campaigning than the Tories are. And whilst UKIP can drum up a lot of support amongst a far right, conservative minority, they're even more polarisng than the Tories, whom 40% of the electorate have indicated they would never even consider voting for, regardless of policy or platform. UKIP is very successful, but there's only so much support they can drum up. 

So the pro union side has Labour, the Liberals, the Greens, the SNP, Plaid Cyrmru, most of British business, including the banks, and all of the 2 million odd EU migrants who live in the country who are eligible to vote and half the press (the Guardian, the Independent, i, the Daily Mirror)

The anti union side has half or less than half of the Tory party, UKIP and the BNP and a couple of rich donors who dare not say openly that they're funding the Kippers and a few other EU critical papers [who might change their mind when the time actually arrives to put their money where their mouth is ](the Telegraph and the Daily Mail).

There are a few other uncertain entities though. The left and centre of the Conservative Party (the bit which Cameron is a member of), the Economist Newspaper and the Murdoch Empire (which owns Sky, The Sun and the Times). 

All in all I think it is heading for a repeat of the previous referendum, where the only people who supported exit were Tony Benn, Ian Paisley (crazy, hateful Northern Irish Unionist), and Eonoch Powell (who was considered to be a racist, even by the standards of the 60s). And on the other hand the leaders of the Conservative Party (Heath), The Labour Party (Wilson) and the liberal party (Thorpe) all supported staying in. 

Oh, and the ""in"" camp outspent the ""out"" camp by 10 to 1. 

And the PM that called that referendum (Wilson) said he would go to Brussels to try and hash out a fairer deal, of which he earned non of it x and then campaigned for ""in"" anyway.

* Nibelung is masculine, so the article des is used, and
* Nibelung is a [""weak noun,""](http://coerll.utexas.edu/gg/gr/no_04.html) so it takes an ending in the genitive form, and Nibelung becomes Nibelungen.

It's the same way that [Mensch becomes Menschen](http://canoo.net/inflection/mensch:N:M) in the accusative, dative, and genitive.  It looks the same as the plural form, but if you pay attention to the article, you can see that it is not.

2: Denounce calling Russians who voted for Russian as a second official language -  ""Marginals"" (30% of the population, cmon).  
3: Accept the ""Russian"" parties into the coalition. This will allow Russians to feel like they are able to express their will.

5: Integration not assimilation. Russians will never assimilate. (Assimilate means replacing their groups values/culture with the set of an another group)

Or something that will never happen - give all non-citizens (not citizens of other countries) citizenship. No tests no nothing. This will generate a massive amount of goodwill.

Just remember that the vowel that comes **second** determines the way you pronounce the word — so in the word *frei*, the **i** comes second, so you pronounce the word with a long i, like the English word *fry*.  Conversely, in a word like *Sie*, where the **e** comes second, you pronounce it with a long e, like the English *see*.  

Remembering this will help your spelling a lot, because there are loads of ie/ei words in German, and they always tripped me up when I was starting to learn.

Other than that, I would just say to keep practicing the other facets of the language and the spelling skills will develop naturally, because pretty much everything in German is spelled the way it sounds.

Though not just in the US; I'm doing a Masters in France in PoliSci (European Governance) and I'm pretty sure it's the foundation of rigorous PoliSci academia everywhere. It seems to me like he's had a healthy dose of that but is applying it interlaid with some other sparse familiarity he seems to have of current international affairs / the end of the Cold War and fall of the Berlin Wall. I say this because his comment above stinks of vocabulary commonly used:
&gt; those concerns were necessarily rational

&gt;tenets of neorealism 

&gt;normal state

&gt;perceptions of intentions

&gt;isolationism

All of those are near word-for-word phrases you hear in university polisci courses. Your professor (as mine did) may even apply them to 'explain' examples such as the balance-of-power during the Cold War but this is supposed to be sort of taken with a grain of salt because they are in fact political theories: there are numerous contending theories on any one subject and none apply everywhere without fail (with the exception of the theory of democratic peace, but that still doesn't make it deterministic).

Problem is, this guy seems to be applying these theories all willy nilly as if they are fail proof and give him ultimate reason and truth just because he has a sort of framework or basis for his argument. Also, he is a complete fucking ignoramus when it comes to what he's applying these ideas to. 
&gt;Unfortunately, the prosperity of the US is directly linked to the prosperity of Europe, so Europe will likely never know what the would would be like if the US returned to strict isolationism, and as such will never give the US the credit it deserves. Europe thinks it exists in a space within which war is an impossibility today, and furthermore, it seems that Europe thinks that was made possible without any effort on the part of the US.

Like what the fuck does that even mean? Why is it unfortunately that the prosperity of the US is linked to the prosperity of Europe? ""US returned to strict isolationism..."" Isolationism is usually discussed to described parts of US 19th century and 1930s foreign policy but that literally has nothing to do with the US and European relations today. What the fuck are you even trying to claim? ""Europe thinks it exists in a space within which war is an impossibility today, and furthermore, it seems that Europe thinks that was made possible without any effort on the part of the US"". Tell me, who exactly is ""Europe""? Is that a person, one country? How can the whole continent think that. Tell that little remark to Ukrainians or surrounding countries you asinine twat. 

Last (and for me the most cringe-worthy) part is of course the nationalism mixed in. His argument (and those elsewhere in this thread) all somehow lead back to how Europe should venerate the United States and fucking thank us for chriss sake. 

Last personal note: I understand why this is perfect /r/shitamericanssay material because its a classic melange of ignorance and nationalism that somehow resonates with my fellow countrymen. I can't explain why some (many) of us are so fucking stupid and it makes me cringe /ashamed (especially when its directed towards other countries, like towards Germany in this case).

Pour finir tu évoques le Likoud, je te rappelle que la charte du Likoud NE reconnait PAS le two state solution, ni même le droit d'auto-détermination des palestiniens mais au contraire, considere que la judée, la samarie et gaza font partie de l'état israelien:

*La charte du Likoud ne reconnaît pas l'existence d'un État Palestinien. Au contraire, cette charte stipule que les communautés juives de Judée, de Samarie et de Gaza sont une concrétisation des valeurs sionistes ; que l’implantation est l’expression du droit irréfutable du peuple juif à disposer de la terre d’Israël ; et que Le Likoud s’attachera à renforcer et à développer ces communautés et s’opposera à leur démantèlement.
D'autre part, la charte du Likoud rejette fermement la création d’un État arabo-palestinien à l’ouest du Jourdain et précise que les Palestiniens peuvent vivre librement dans un contexte d’autonomie mais pas en tant qu’État indépendant et souverain*

You don't need to assume my figures are correct - you can simply look up the net contributions of the member states. Take away the UK's net contribution and divide it amongst the remaining 27. 

It averages out at €277 million per country, but Slovenia wouldn't be asked for that - it would be divided proportionately. All the other countries already pay about half of that for the UK's rebate, so it wouldn't even come as a novelty, really.

&gt;It also means the EU gets proportionally smaller. Given that the Brussels euro-elite rely on giant economies of scale to provide massive salaries and perks to themselves it would likely cause some consternation.

I doubt that, given that only something like 6% of the EU budget goes on administration, and that includes other stuff besides salaries. It might well be one of the most cost-efficient bureaucracies in the world.

EU officials are certainly *well* paid - I assume that's who you mean by ""the euro-elite"" - but ""massive salaries and perks""? Compared to who exactly? Salaries range from €32,000 at the bottom to €200,000 at the top - about the same as a mid-range corporate scale or the UK or Ireland's civil service pay scales, and with similar perks. It's good, but hardly ""massive"".

Would the bureaucracy shrink? Probably a bit, but then all the current British EU officials would no longer be eligible for service, so some of that would be supplied by that natural wastage.

Like I said, I'm not in favour of the UK leaving (partly because I'm a UK national by birth, living in Ireland), but I don't think you should pretend to yourself that the EU will find the UK's absence all that hard to get over. Aside from anything else, it looks uncannily like ""I'll leave, and *then* they'll all be sorry, oh yes"". Not very dignified.

Ireland will certainly find it a bit weird - I mean, we're used to you being there, and not having another English-speaking country in the EU will definitely be a little unsettling. But I suspect that the FDI advantages of being the *only* English-speaking country in the EU (as opposed to just in the eurozone) might well help us get over that - I see some UK companies are already sniffing around for HQs in Ireland in case of a Brexit.

Pas du tout.

&gt;quel est l'intérêt de ta matière ? 

Idéalement, donner aux élèves l’opportunité et les moyens de porter une oreille et un regard différents, plus savants, attentifs, curieux, critiques, joyeux ! Sur le monde de la musique, les musiques du monde et leur histoire. Leur donner confiance en eux, les amener à développer leur goût propre. Qu’ils s’autorisent à se laisser toucher par la musique et qu’ils se l’approprient, sans préjugé esthétique, historique, culturel ou social. Ce n’est pas qu’une ouverture d’esprit qui leur est proposée, c’est aussi un rendez-vous - une respiration bienvenue, dans un emploi du temps chargé, lorsque les autres matières évoquent d’autres enjeux (d’orientation, de réussite ou d’échec…). Quand on n’a pas eu la chance d’une rencontre enrichissante avec la culture, elle devient discriminante ou n’est plus perçue que comme un produit, un bien de consommation - on essaie de planter un petit quelque chose dont on espère qu’il portera d’autres fruits.

Concrètement, dans notre phase de préparation pré-Caraïbes, alors que j’explorais des pistes possibles de reconversion, j’ai opéré un petit sondage informel auprès de mes élèves. TOUS, sans exception d’âge ou de niveaux, m’ont dit avoir trouvé plus ou moins barbant les cours de musique tels que dispensés au collège. Venant de gamins à fond sur la discipline, lui consacrant volontairement plusieurs heures de temps libre chaque semaine sur plusieurs années (parfois même post-Bac), forcément, ça interpelle.

I hardly have a disdain for the UK. It's the populist forces taking it hostage at the moment I have such disdain for. I have similar disdain for the populist nincompoops in my own country.

Staying in the internal market is better for the City of London. [EU internal immigration is a net plus](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-29910497). (And that's the BBC)

So can you tell me what it is what Farage really wants here? 

Wait.. how can I not get this.. Why haven't I seen this before!

The UK simply wants more control over the EU, and the only way to get it is to terrorize the EU leadership, isn't it? The UK isn't worried about internal EU immigrants. The UK is worried about African and Asian immigrants. It's just a good bludgeon to try to gain more control over the EU with.

... and the strategy is backfiring! 

And who ultimately controls Cameron? The City, of course!

Edit: Jesus Christ... I'm on to something here

&gt; **His father was a stockbroker who worked in the City of London financial district.** A profile on BBC Radio 4 said he was an alcoholic[14] and he left the family home when Nigel was five years old.[12]

&gt; Farage was educated at Dulwich College, a public school in south London.[16] **On leaving school in 1982, he decided not to go to university, but to work in the city, trading commodities at the London Metal Exchange.**[14] Initially, he joined the American commodity brokerage firm Drexel Burnham Lambert,[16] transferring to Credit Lyonnais Rouse in 1986.[16] He joined Refco in 1994, and Natexis Metals in 2003.[16]
