UKIP may well attract racists and people who have voted BNP, but they've never held an official platform of anti-semitism, holocaust denial or repatriating non-whites. (which were all part of the FN programme in the past).

Oh yes

&gt;Lo bevete a cazzo o con criterio?

Moderato criterio. So come prepararlo decentemente e cerco di evitare il the da discount, ma non sono di quelli che se non lo bevi rigidamente amaro e senza gusti aggiunti sclerano, e se sono in casa altrui e l'unico the disponibile è quello del LIDL mi adatto.

&gt; Qualità preferite?

Tendo a preferire the dal sapore forte.

&gt; Quanto ne bevete?

In stagione fredda un 2-3 al giorno, in stagione calda... zero. Troppo caldo per fare le infusioni e non mi piace il the freddo.

&gt; Tè migliore mai bevuto?

Twinings Lapsang Souchong, che preferisco anche ai the sfusi di qualità ben superiore.

&gt; Tè peggiore?

Un the sfuso, se non ricordo male di provenienza russa, ""leggermente"" affumicato il cui nome non mi sovviene. Le virgolette sono d'obbligo: più che the sembrava di mettere in infusione della pancetta. Quando un'amica mi ha detto che a lei piaceva non ho perso l'occasione per sbarazzarmene rifilandoglielo tutto (lei era contentissima :) )

&gt; Frequentate sale da tè? 

Probabilmente lo farei se ce ne fossero dove vivo e i prezzi fossero decenti. Ma qua l'unico posto che si chiama ""tea room"" è una specie di discobar, e ovunque tu chieda del the caldo di fanno pagare cifre assurde (2.5 euro, 3, 3.5...) per dell'acqua calda e una bustina che gli sarà costata 20 centesimi se è vero.

Jo. Kann ich verstehen. Sport ist Sport. Also eine *alles ausser Fussball* Policy fänd ich für /r/de_sport schon gut. Die Fussball Bundesliga ist das Letzte was mich interessiert. Dafür gibt es schliesslich ein dickes Subreddit mit über 3000 Karteileichen... Das Subreddit jetzt in Sachen Motorsport zu drehen, fände ich jetzt nicht ganz die glückliche Wahl... Fänd es eigentlich gut als Sammelbecken für alles andere... Golf, Hallenhalma, Radsport (MTB, BMX, Trial etc.), Extremesport etc. wie Du es schon angedacht hattest. Das Sub war mir nicht bekannt, ist aber schon abonniert und wird demnächst ""zugespamt"" ;-)

Motorsportmäßig gilt mein Fan-Interesse hauptsächlich dem Langstreckensport auf vier Rädern... FIA WEC, VLN und die ganzen 24H Klassiker... Darüber hinaus natürlich auch alles andere was Räder und nen Motor in irgendeiner Form hat! Bergrennen, Rally, MotoX... F1 hab ich aufgehört zu gucken, als Häkkinen aufgehört hat. Ich verfolge das nur sehr locker. Die DTM fand ich früher unheimlich toll... Habs seit ende der 80er Live und auf 3Sat verfolgt. Von dem Remake der Neuzeit bin ich ziemlich enttäuscht. Das hat schon lange nix mehr mit beinharten Tourenwagensport zu tun... Werde mich dann mal in dem Sport Sub dementsprechend betätigen, wenn ich was interessantes habe. Vielleicht kriegt man ja doch etwas Leben un die Bude.

It is a famous example of [constrained writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_writing). The sentence ""[Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo)"" is an example of this type of writing in English.

There's the fact that no one would come to our aid because the west considers us second class humans in all aspects. But we don't even have to go that far. NATO leadership seems to be...retarded? I mean, you have Breedlove openly admitting that they had no plan for a Russian annexation of Crimea. That's like a pilot saying he had no plan for the takeoff of his own plane. It's borderline absurd. And to openly say that in front of the world is skull-splittingly moronic.

Anything this guy does is bound to fail. I refuse to believe that someone who doesn't even grasp basic human psychology and is seemingly unaware of even the bare minimum requirements of his own job is going to successfully orchestrate my protection from the 20th century's biggest terrorists and savages.

There is also the ""trite"" fact that Europe doesn't have an eastern border that can be realistically maintained in the face of Russian aggression.

Pour l'Irak : Mensonge international sur les armes de destruction massives. Invasion unilatérale avec un avis contraire de l'ONU. Déstabilisation totale de la région avec pour effet un regain du terrorisme (que l'invasion était censée combattre). [Au moins 188 000 morts](https://www.iraqbodycount.org/), dont encore 59 hier (certains parlent de [500 000](http://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/500-000-nombre-victimes-accumulees-depuis-invasion-irak-en-2003-happy-hour-timetosignoff-872715.html) morts).

Bien joué.

En Lybie, à peine mieux (80 000 morts). Deux gouvernements se disputent le pouvoir, le niveau de vie a drastiquement baissé alors que c'était le pays le plus développé d'Afrique (IDH).

Pourquoi le non interventionnisme serait une erreur ?

&gt;Et la Russie n'a pas de base militaire en Abkhazie, Arménie, Azerbaïdjan, Biélorussie, Kazakhstan, Kirghizistan, Ossétie du Sud, Ouzbékistan, Syrie, Tadjikistan, Transnistrie

Compare [cette liste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Russian_military_bases_abroad) avec la [liste des bases américaines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_military_bases). Les US ont plus de 500 sites sur tous les continents. C'est sans commune mesure avec la Russie.

&gt;Ils ne sont pas mieux que les USA, et peut être même pire

Je ne vois pas comment on peut dire que les Russes sont pires que les US. Vu le nombre de dictatures sanglantes que les US ont installé au cours de leur histoire, et les guerres ou invasions qu'ils ont menées. Ils sont responsables de plus de morts à l'extérieur que n'importe qui depuis la fin de la seconde guerre mondiale. Leur appétit de pouvoir est insatiable.

&gt;Mais il a raison sur un point. De Guaule. L'homme qui à dit non à la Russie, et au USA. Cependant, je pense qu'il faudrait un ""De Guaule de l'Europe"" et non pas une ""Marine de la France"" à l'heure d'aujourd'hui. Le monde à changé depuis le temps

C'est trop tard. On aurait pu dans les années 60, mais l'Allemagne n'a pas voulu. Ensuite, depuis qu'il y a le cheval de Troyes britannique rien n'est possible. Maintenant, même s'ils s'en vont, il restera encore le petits pays de l'Est. À autant de pays si différents, il sera impossible de se mettre d'accord. C'est foutu et les US ont gagné. Le seul moyen est de recommencer plus petit, avec moins de pays.

Yes. And local beers at that. You don't get the same experience wherever you go, that's the *point*. Life gets boring if you have exactly the same selection wherever you go.

&gt; I never saw any IPAs and rarely any porters and stouts. Why is that?

They're not German beers. Also, they're served at warmer temperatures than German beers (i.e. lightly chilled or, in the case of pale ale, hardly chilled at all), which Germans find disgusting. And they don't have what a German would consider to be a proper head, very important to a German. Germans regard ales in particular to be about as appetizing as warm dishwater, and an affront to all those who claim to love beer. Also, the German beer purity laws, in force since 1516, mandate that beer must contain only hops, malt, water and yeast, and nothing else at all.

Oder sollen die gleich den faschistischen Rest der Ukraine ""befreien"" mit diesen Sprüchen auf ihren Plakaten? Meinst du das bringt irgend etwas??

Janukowitsch ist der Präsident der Ukraine. Er wurde nicht abgesetzt. Wenn die meinen Krim und Donezk sei noch immer die Ukraine kann man nur entgegensetzen dass Janukowitsch noch immer der Präsident ist. Man kann doch nicht einfach auf die Verfassung scheissen. Und mit ihrer neuen Ordnung kommen die im Osten nicht sehr weit.

Meine Heimatstadt ist auch für Janukowitsch gewesen und wenn es darauf ankommen werden sie eher auf die Affen aus dem Westen schiessen als auf die Russen. Jetzt kämpfen die nicht weil es eben nach Krim danach aussieht als hätte Putin vor uns aufzufressen. Für Unabhängigkeit hätte man durch und durch gekämpft.

Als man sie bei lebendigem Leibe in Odessa abfackelte, war das deine «Humane Lösung»? Oder meinst was der Rechter Sektor in Kiew gemacht hat, mit ihren Scharfschützen - war das deine «Humanität»? Warum erwartest du von uns eine bedingungslose Kapitulation und nicht von der illegitimen Regierung in Kiew?

1st one was a reply to another comment asking about another for what he meant. I just replied to what the other user implied. As you can clearly see in the link you just provided. It's like me calling you a racist for quoting the word arab.

2nd.

&gt;How come, one group of people are so universally hated no matter where they are, whatever country they are in. At what point do we ask us the logical question, is it us or them? Might it be so, that they, their culture and ways just aren't adapted to any form of civilised society anywhere.

I am asking a question on when we shall ask the question why gypsies seem to be universally hated wherever there is a significant minority population of gypsies. What's racist about that. Are you denying that they aren't seen as a problem in almost every country that has a gypsy minority?

If you mean my comment about them pissing in corners etc. Well that's just what they seem to do around here at least. Digg in trashcans, steal from stores and the police have even had to set up their own little gypsy task force.

&gt; It's clearly beyond all doubt that you're a stormfront style neonazi.

I've made it very clear that unlike you I'm neither a leftist or socialist of any sort. So nazism doesn't really fit my political bill at all.

This has to be the third time I've made that clear to you and I'll leave it to be the last. As I honestly don't care about you, people like you who see everything as racist or fascist nor do I care if you call me a racist. If that makes you feel better, so be it.

If you give 1000 people 1000 euros, people will probably save some of it and spend the rest, thus boosting service sectors and retail. The net increase of money in the economy is 1,000,000 euros. 

Now let's give that same 1m euros to a bank with a capital requirement of 10%. They will keep 100,000 euros in their vault, and then loan out the other 900,000 to another bank. That bank then keeps 10%, then loans out 810,000 to the next bank, who keeps 10% and loans out 729,000. To stop there, we see that the 1m Euros that were put into the bank became 2,710,000 euros in the economy. 

Velocity also matters. If you are a coffee shop, you need to buy inventory ahead of time in order to meet demand for the day. Say that you need 1m euros per week to operate. A bank can easily float this amount to you if they are well-capitalized, and you pay the interest on the loan while buying enough stock to grow aggressively. You can't really grow if all your capital comes from retail purchases, no matter how much money the consumers have. It's certainly a chicken and egg problem.

Drive on the right all you want, and keep the Imperial units, I consider it a gift for being a major player in getting rid of Napoleon. He's the major reason we're doing metric after all. I mean, we have to thank him for that and laying the ground work for our legal system, but good riddance after that. Talking about the French, I wqould ridicule them as well for stubbornly holding on to the outdated system of subsidised agriculture, the Greeks and Italians for not understanding the basics of government economy, the Belgians for not being able to decide whether they want to be one or two countries and form a national government, and my own country for not being able to deal with our national idiot in politics. I would rip on the Germans as well, but they are just too powerful in Europe these days, and we all know what happens when their pride gets hurt. 

But yes, it really seems that the British want the benefits and not the costs. My country is a major net contributor as well, but our PM doesn't promise a referendum on the issue of staying in the Union. Or that Farage guy screaming bloody murder on anything the Union does. So yes, on the issue of really being committed to the Union your representatives don't seem to be very enthousiastic about it to say the least. 

I don't really care whether you change any of the mentioned things. But the Schengen one. That one I think is central to becoming a proper Union. I will give you that it can cause problems, but I think that is not due to the nature of Schengen, but poo regulation surrounding it, and those issues can and should be fixed. 

But I would not kick the British out for that, never said I agree with that. Just that I understand the general sentiment. On the other hand, if the British were to decide thay want to leave and become like Norway I wouldn't stop them either.

---

&gt;Unisex names have been enjoying a decent amount of popularity in English speaking countries in the past several decades. Masculine names have become increasingly popular among females in the past century but feminine names remain extremely rare among males. Examples of masculine names which have been widely given to females and thus have become unisex include Ashley, Beverly, Evelyn, Hilary, Jocelyn, Joyce, Kelly, Lynn, Meredith, Shannon, Shirley, Sidney, Vivian, and Whitney. Modern unisex names may derive from nature (Lake, Rain, Willow), colors (Blue, Grey, Indigo), countries or states (Dakota, India, Montana), surnames (Jackson, Mackenzie, Murphy), and politicians (Kennedy, Madison, Reagan).

*Selon un sondage Ipsos, le vote « non » était surtout tourné contre ce que les opposants voient comme la dégradation des conditions de vie actuelles (une des raisons invoquée par 52 % du « non ») et le trop grand libéralisme contenu dans ce projet de constitution (une des raisons pour 40 %).

A lot of the preconceptions of the EEA are built on myths created by Pro-EU's to discredit this option, for example:-

[Anne Beathe Tvinnereim](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiUkyAb2L7o#t=00h31m00s) about the lies the Pro-EU's used in 1994 Norway:

* *""No-one would listen to us.""*
* *""Not possible to have a normal bi-lateral relationship""*
* *""Locked outside the world, become an outside non-existent country in the internaitonal community""*
* *""Innovation and business would lose out.""*

To paraphrase.

And further another Norwegian:-

&gt;*""They really lied and exaggerated, we'd lose 00's of 000's of jobs... which have been proven false... all of them.""*

&gt;**They must have known they were lying...""**

=

&gt;*...you must adopt the common rules all of which are made or conceived at EU level.*

You can learn a lot more about ""Global Governance"" reading these blogs on the topic:-

REF &amp; Attrib.: Dr. RAE North.

&gt;*""This commentary underlines the fact that world trade agreements are no longer primarily – or even at all - about tariffs, but about harmonisation of regulation.""*

IE CONVERGENCE at a global level (similar/analogous to the telecomms industry if I may say so).

There is a substantial amount of information here. What people lack is information in this subject. It's conveniently summarized here, but for a full understanding a good read of the links is required.

Coming back to Norway with it's EEA = 80% of the EU's Single Market/Single-regulatory-regime acquis (100%) and Switzerland is about for sake of argument with it's bi-laterals 40%.

The reason we'd not take the Swiss option is it would take too long &gt;5+ years to achieve and Article 50 gives up to 2 years, hence the EEA which we're allready ""privy"" too is an (ref: Dr. RAE North) ""Off-The-Shelf-Solution"" that is expedient. It is also a staging-post on the journey towards the ""Real Top Table"" at Global Level (Geneva) not Regional (Brussels) level.

This finally does not point out the intractable problems of the EU/EZ where a 2-speed EU is being created that is disadvantageous for the UK, besides the doomsday debt/deficit of the GIPS... But that's an entirely different push factor to the ""pull"" factor of The Norway Option.

The left picture features a person that has his face turned towards the camera at a 10-20 degree angle. On the left picture you can see, for example, his righter eye socket, while with the right picture the face would have turn by a lot to see the left eye socket (remember, it is flipped). You can also see it by the lips, of which more width is shown in the left picture, the weird shape the left chin has, his face beyond his nose/mustache in the left picture (absolutely not visible on the right) and, lastly, in the neck you can also see how he has his head turned. There are moments in the execution video when this person faces the left entirely and is not turned away/towards the camera. Why did you not use such a picture? One of the benefit of using a similar picture is that you can see they share similar nose and chin structure (in my strictly non-professional opinion).

It appears that you have made this picture comparison, or are the only one it has been given to, since there appear no copies elsewhere. Thus you are entirely aware of these obvious issues but have decided to not let that bother you.

Una disgrazia. Howard Lederer e Ray Bitar dovrebbero essere in galera.

Non è un problema per il momento, un bot non è assolutamente capace di giocare a Texas Hold'em vincendo. 

&gt; La segregazione dei giocatori italiani

Croce e delizia. Da un lato ha rallentato il dissanguamento delle finanze dei pokeristi italiani, che giocando su .com a limiti più alti e contro gente più forte si sarebbero prosciugati ancora più rapidamente. Dall'altro lato ha impedito un processo di selezione naturale che avrebbe potuto portare alcuni giocatori italiani a essere nel top mondiale: ora sono forti, ma se la gavetta l'avessero fatta su .com sarebbero fortissimi.

Maurizio è un imprenditore di successo. E' un giocatore di poker di livello medio. Quando sta dietro al microfono fa volutamente lo scemo; è una persona di finissima intelligenza nel campo del business e del betting. Fabio non lo conosco ma è un grande professionista, e poi si è preso la Parodi quindi beato lui :)

&gt; 2p2 ( two plus two )

Un punto di riferimento per la comunità pokeristica internazionale. L'unico luogo dove scrivono davvero tutti, dal primo scemo ai più vincenti del mondo. Magari ci fosse un forum del genere per gli italiani: comunque anche dal nostro Paese lo leggono in molti, spesso lurkando senza scrivere nulla.

Good. Now move on already. 

&gt; I engaged in this pointless discussion not because I would like to see ""Wilno return to the Fatherland"", but because Lithuanian rethoric of ""the evil Poles invaded the 100% Lithuanian city of Vilnius which totally had nothing in common with Poland and was belonging to this exact Lithuanian Republic from the dawn of time"" is both completly untrue and pisses me off.

Lithuanian nation started to form again in late XIX after being mostly polonised for few hundred years. People to call themselves Lithuanians at that point had to decide that they are not Poles first. Ergo Lithuanian nationalism was formed almost solely in opposition to Polish one. That's not something that simply vanishes without a trace. I'm sure that a lot of rethoric used in late XIX to distinguish themselves as note Poles is still in history books etc. making people inherently wary of us. 

Also there are only 3 millions Lithuanians and on the other side of the border they have 39kk of Poles. And some of those Poles like to yap about how they deserve to own Wilno. Sure, they agreed on borders as they are but havin;t they done with in 1920 too?

Those were different times but from todays perspective Żeligowski Mutiny is clearly an asshole move, hardly a page in history books to be proud of. 

Now imagine that there are 500 millions (same population difference as between Poland and Lithuania) Germans leaving next to Poland and some of them aggressively claiming that Polish western lands should belong to them. Do you understand now why Lithuanians are a bit twitchy about us? We are hardly in a possition to be afraid of anything so how about cutting them some slack? Let's just give them few decades, they'll get over it. 

&gt; Katowice was in Poland before WWII. 

Since 1920 and before those lands were German since 1330.

No it is this specific user. Since the Snowden case dropped, his vitriol towards all Americans has been vicious. He doesn't just stop with the government, or the intelligence he just spews hatred towards Americans. Seeing as he blames all his hatred of Americans on the NSA scandal I responded to him with information about Germany's own spying program and he became snide and dismissive. My issue stems from his promotion of hatred against Americans in many of his comments. I did lose my temper, but especially since the NSA scandal (maybe even before) there are very few interactions with Germans that I've had where it didn't seem like there was a noticeable air of condescension. [Most of the time it is more subtle than this but this is basically the tone for the majority of the American/German interactions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/265qyf/man_cooked_to_death_in_scalding_shower_as/cho7uo4) After awhile it gets annoying, especially given that your services are doing the same thing (even worse in the sense that you are demanding rights from the American government that your government will not extend to the US.) Germans have no right given Germanys own questionable intelligence tactics to take out your anger at the NSA on average Americans and American culture, you have no right to use the NSA leaks to incite hatred against all Americans.

Yes, mutiny was an asshole move, but then so was the earlier Lithuanian take over. What would be a difference between Lithuania taking over Vilnius, and trying to take over the rest of Belarus which was a part of GDL aswell? The truth is, the former GDL was quite clearly divided into three quite distinct parts, though with unclear borders: the western Lithuanian-speaking part, the central Polish-speaking one, and the eastern Belarussian-speaking one. That Lithuanian propaganda resulted in Lithuanians (the Baltic-language speaking ones) considering themselves the only true heirs of GDL and believing this legacy gave them right to somehow subjugate the rest of the former GDL. They (paradoxically, not without Soviet help, though that wasn't of course the goal of Soviets) succeeded with the Polish part which kinda saddens me.

Outside of trade, I see the EU as sucking in powers it doesn't really need simply for the reason that it wants those powers. The same with federalisation, the EU has created the circumstances with the euro crisis which requires it to be given more power in order to fix the problems it created, because its member nations (inside the euro) no longer have enough power to fix themselves.

That has been the lesson leaned by the British public, more EU integration isn't necessarily better, it may in fact be much worse.

true,TheEndgame,NORW,Norway,"&gt;  We do have tax brackets here, but the middle class pays about 25%. 

Most people i know here who earn middle class wages pay around 36% tax. 

&gt;And we also don't get much assistance from our government for things like school, parental leave, etc.

Doesn't this vary a lot by state and employer? Norway is very good for workers rights no doubt. But in the end we pay a lot for it. Owning a car here is a good example. It's expensive as hell. You pay $2.66 a liter for petrol and a regular family car with a small engine and almost no extras will set you back $50K. When you take in to consideration that we have the worst roads in Western Europe it hurts especially bad. Then you then factor in the cost of real estate you understand why we have some of the highest household debt in the world. For young people to enter the real estate market is pretty much impossible without help from parents. 

Also people must stop thinking everything is free here. School is free until highschool, but when you start studying you have to take out student loans to handle the high cost of living. Healthcare is another thing that isn't free. You have to use more than $350 a year on healthcare to get it free. Also the healthcare is pretty average and there are long queues for simple treatments. I had to wait over a month for a doctors appointment for example. After that i had to wait almost two months to get the treatment at the hospital. Sure enough it wasn't a serious procedure, but it's still very annoying. Especially considering the amount of taxes we pay.

And it's going to be an overnight waking up. Occupy Wallstreat was a powder keg and you are just playing with a match. 

Just look at greece or Spain. It's *bad*. Think i'm exagerating ? If we do the same and cut further just to fund the military, we are total *goners*. No fucking around, if you cut anymore welfare or pension or some associated funds to buy weapons , they'll (citizens) just take weapon, and kill their own gov. Austerity is reaching maximal limit. Then other states around might have ideas too. And it won't be peacefull euromaidan. It's a serious risk we have to account for, and we have to deal with it, and that mean *lots* of money in untouchable social programs. That's simply the price of stability for our continent.

Then germany might be ""the elephant in the room"", true. But 1°) Germany is busy paying the bills of a lot of people in Europe, as a nice european support gesture, so i wouldn't spit on them too much seeing as they are already shelling money by the busload on other things, 

2°) yes few people still trust them with weapons, and nobody will ever trust them with mass destruc weap. That's not going to change overnight, or at all. That's WWII legacy, and we european have to deal with it. It's the line in the sand they agreed not to walk over, to prevent half the continent from panicking, or really some future leader having grandeur delusions to try acting on it on some unstopable overnight nationalism folly. 

They're potentially the mass destruction state if they put their mind on it, and nobody wants to see that coming back. Ever. The US are far off and never had real nationalism risk, but to help you picture it it's akin to if texas had lost it just 60y agao and took half the weapon of the continent and started a war *massacring one by one half the USA citizens, litterally*. A bit of a nightmare.

Thankfully they love Merkel, but, no, the german are not going to rise as much of an army as they did in WWII for the current period of time.

true,doctorheredoctor,BELG,Belgium,"&gt;National governments are closer to the people they govern. A case in point, the Bank of England response to the financial crisis has been demonstrably better than the response by the European Central Bank because the BoE is dealing with a single country it can tailor interest rates and policy too and the ECB is trying to set policy for all the members of the euro, so the policy will always be worse.

This has everything to do with the ECB mandate and not at all with democracy.  ECB is not on par with BoE, not even close.

Why national government over NUTS-1 or 2?  I cannot agree with your reasoning unless you support a near total devolution of powers away from the national level which I personally find unwieldy enough.  The difference between us being I think some powers need to go all the way to the top others all the way to the bottom, not some unpleasant middle-ground like nation states.

This is what I would like to change.  Though I don't think it's going to be military spending that does us in, it's personal debt, more specifically school loans.  People are graduating into debt serfdom and won't ever buy a house, or a car anything, and deflation will take over.

I worked as an attorney in almost every aspect of the financial collapse you can think of.  All the scandals.  I was so sure we were going to implode, I was 5 minutes away from building a bunker with canned food and ammo.  And I got out of the market.  But I underestimated the almighty power of the Fed and the power of issuing the reserve currency.  We can fall back on that our country slowly grinds down, I don't see a revolution breaking out.

I know exactly how bad it is in Spain, my friend moved to Barcelona, and married a Catalan woman.  She INSISTED they move back here over his objections, because she literally believes her children would have no future there.  I think she was right.  Same with Greek friends who have moved their families here.

But now we are getting into the meat of it, you make some great points.  

&gt;yes few people still trust them with weapons, and nobody will ever trust them with mass destruc weap. That's not going to change overnight, or at all. That's WWII legacy, and we european have to deal with it.

If you do not trust a country in your union, the richest, biggest country, then how can it ever be anything more than a free trade/freedom of movement zone?  You can never have a legitimate EU force without massive German participation.  And I totally understand why the rest of Europe feels that way.  I'm not spitting on Gemrany, I'm saying if you are in a union and you can't trust another member of that union, it isn't a very strong union!


I think everyone in Europe forgot about history, and put their heads in the sand.  That was great for awhile, but now you are being threatened and cannot defend yourselves, because of historical reasons.  But why does America have to do it?

And most likely, you are going to be working a low end job that pays between $8.00 and $15.00 an hour if you only have a bachelors.

And I have been to Norway. Your roads are just as bad as the shitty freeways and surface streets in most of California. And yes, it is much cheaper for us to own cars, but in CA, we need them. We have virtually no public transportation. and our urban sprawl is hilariously bad. I can easily put 1000 km on my car in a week. And I have had many weeks where it's about 1500km.

The old city center (Centro Antico) rested between hill tops on the west and north side, swamps on the east (literal swamps) and the sea down south.

The city then expanded and many more neighborhoods were created to accomodate an ever growing population. Each of these parts of the city has a name which identifies its position, and means something for us inhabitants.

I'll try not to be too long, but let's try a list:

City Center (Centro Antico) as said before is the oldest part of the city. It retains the roman street organization, and here you will find most of the more ""Typical"" neapolitan views and most of the important monuments like Santa Chiara, the Cathedral, Cloisters and such. It's a nice place to stay, even if it can get a bit messy and  dangerous at night.

Ferrovia (railways) is on the East side of Centro Antico. Here is the biggest railways station of the city. A lot of hotels can be found here, but the area is not very well off. It's full of immigrants and houses are built on the cheap side. All in all not a nice place to spend your time.

Centro Direzionale (you would call it Downtown) is a quite recent eastern expansion near Ferrovia. Here you will find offices and shops. This part of the city was designed by Japanese designer Kenzo Tange. It's full of skyscrapers and mirrored window buildings that were meant to say that Naples is now in the future. Neapolitans find this quite amusing.

Municipio (City Hall) this part of the city includes the mayor's office, a Castle Called Maschio Angioino, the docks called Molo Beverello, and the biggest square in the city Piazza del Plebiscito shaped like Piazza san Pietro in Rome. Here you'll find a lot of nice churches, the Royal Palace and San Carlo Theatre. All of these are worthy a lengthy visit. From piazza del plebiscito you'll find yourself on Via Roma (also called Via Toledo) a street bustling with people and shops. If you like window shopping this is a nice place.

Chiaia (it's a name, it means Seaside) This is the most touristic part of the city. It includes a beautiful seaside promenade which is closed to traffic. Here you will find nice restaurants, the beautiful Castel Dell'Ovo, a castle built directly on the sea (a must visit) and a city park called Villa Comunale. It once was nice, but it is a bit ruined at the moment due to lack of maintenance and the proximity of the Underground line working site.

Over the city looms the Vomero Hilltop, this neighborhood is one of the more recent. It's a residential and commercial location full of clothing shops and restaurants. It isn't worth a visit per se, but it houses three major attractions: Castel S. Elmo (a castle that watches over the city center) near the Certosa di San Martino (a very nice Monastery which is open to visits) and Villa Floridiana a very nice park which is open but unfortunately cannot be visited entirely because lack of staff means you can only see the central avenue and the sight seeing spot which looks on to Chiaia.

Moving West from Vomero you will then find Fuorigrotta, a very recent addition to the city, notable only because it's the location of San Paolo Stadium, where Napoli Football Club plays.

Moving West from Chiaia, instead will take you to Posillipo, one of the most famous neighborhoods. This is where you will find rich villas directly on the sea, and nice views of Ischia, an Island near Naples. This is considered the ""posh"" side of Naples. Who lives there says it's the best part. All the other neapolitans (me included) think they are snotty.

Outside these places you'll then find places like Pianura, Scampia, Secondigliano and others. These are not nice places, housing is really on the poor side, and you will see here a lot of criminal activity. You don't want to visit these places unless you live there or if you have to. I have only ever been to Pianura because I have a friend there, but I haven't been in the other places, and don't count on going there anytime soon.

Speaking of Camorra, the simple answer is: Yes, it's still here. And it's not going away. Organized crime is a part of this city, and it always will be here. The nice thing is that you'll never see it. What you will see are people stealing purses and watches. People throwing garbage in the middle of the street like it's not their business. You'll notice cars and motorcycles speeding in the wrong direction of a one way street. You will see cars parked in strange positions and places. But that's the problem: you will see it. For us it's just another day in the town, and all these behaviors are taken for granted. Is this a direct consequence of the presence of Camorra? I don't know, but I can say that Camorra strives here because it finds a fertile ground.

To this day I have to still find something that got done, without Camorra's permission, or its direct involvement in the matter. It is a part of the city, and we just live with it.

I'm sorry if I sound a bit harsh, it's because I am. I tried to be as brief and clear as possible, but you can ask me more and for what I can do I'll try to reply.

There is a subreddit for naples though, you can find it here:

In spain we barely escaped from it, just because they had no income (*and they still have little debts*).

Maybe it does ring a bell, no ? Then tell them tommorrow they won't even eat because we cut pensions and watch the results. *What could possibly go wrong.*

Soo, yeeep, noop. Since we can't print cash and most of our ressources are already going where it should, that won't move. We have to make do with what we have, some help, some rise, and lots of refurbished/de-mothballed, but that's about it. But at least, if war comes from outside like the russians, we will be united against them. Unlike in an inner civil war rich vs poor, east vs west.

&gt; I worked as an attorney in almost every aspect of the financial collapse you can think of. 

Have you seen 1.5 Million angry people on a place asking for the president to GTFO and surrender or they'll take whatever weapon they can and run in ? That's the true face of society's collapse. Then when there is nobody around to pick up the parts because the entire EU falls at once in another ""spring"" , it gets darker.

&gt;  But I underestimated the almighty power of the Fed and the power of issuing the reserve currency. We can fall back on that our country slowly grinds down, I don't see a revolution breaking out.

Mostly because EU funded powers decided to force spain to keeps it act together, fight a bit corruption, and put back money where it was needed (the people and not their pockets). So it went back a bit. But as jobs goes off and automation ramps up, it'll go back to the opposite till we figure a new system. In the mean time, we simply can't afford to fight a (cold) war at the same time.

&gt; She INSISTED they move back here over his objections, because she literally believes her children would have no future there

I can only imagine :x

&gt; If you do not trust a country in your union, the richest, biggest country, then how can it ever be anything more than a free trade/freedom of movement zone?

I'd trust them with my life with a lot of things but a lot of people who lived throught WWII or saw their entire town built from glassed rubbles probably won't agree with what i say, and i can only understand that. You don't erase 100 million people killed and 15 million tortured-to death casualties over night. It's going to take the better part of a century.

Honestly, their current army structure and level don't really bother me, but if they'd went back to it you'd start seeing a giant line of german tank near the baltics again and then people (or russia) would most likely freak out.

We built the EU to *avoid* wars. not start new ones. We fucked up a bit recently (syria... :\\), i'm not sure making it worse would help either.

&gt; and you can't trust another member of that union, it isn't a very strong union!

We have a strong anti gun/anti military culture also. It's very different with the US. Carrying a weapon around will get you very strange looks and stop&amp;frisk every 100 meters by the police in the streets even if you have permit. We like to forget about those and tanks. It's not totally thinked through i'm aware, but we basically said we would forget a bit about weapons and build our union over common points we could build over, that is economy, diplomacy.

&gt; I think everyone in Europe forgot about history, 

Not really. We hide the scars, but it's still there. An entire generation will have to pass before that's possible. Nationalism is still extremely important. European feelings are typical of the &lt;30 years and the political class only, really. 

People agree because they don't see massive issues as of now (yes UKIP can rant but the londonians sleep peacefully at night and don't worry about getting bombed anymore); but really the last thing we want is to stir the lingering tensions. A strongly militarized germany would drive a huge wedge in the european agreement, while the best thing is to wait for it to heal. It would be a deal breaker for half the continent. You don't start with boxing when you just healed from broken bones days ago. So we wait it out. Probably 50 more years.

&gt; But why does America have to do it?

- Because they have boatloads of cash we don't have

- Because since they have the reserve currency, they can print cash while we can't really do it in the same proportions (we should in a limited proportion to limit deflation risks, but really we can't print billions and trillons on a whim to patch up the budget or for urgent needs like the US do)

- Because america keeping military suppremacy over the entire planet is the garrantee we're not trying to backstab them, so they don't try to strangle us while we are an emergent concurrent power. Watch how they strongarm China, in Asia. They're already here and in charge of most strategic things. We keep total controle over economic and inner politics, but as of geopolitics they have a major say. If something in Europe is a real issue to them, they can already voice it and be a total pain in the ass. We keep them in the loop.

- Because it's easier to have them foot the bills we don't want to (let's face it for a minute :P)

- Because it's easier to stay allied with them and therefore need pretexts too. Putting them in charge of defending the baltics throught nato gives us a great excuse to stay around them (and we need strong allies to survive as a super power who does not want a insanely large army. Also we simply can't anger the entire planet if we want to keep being a power).

- Because murica did so till now so we can keep them doing it without breaking the statut quo

- Because they're ~~born &amp; bred to break russkies~~ the natural ennemy of our current problem who keep harassing us while they can get away with it, russia

- And meanwhile we can focus on others issues like fixing our own fuck ups, deal with the inner crisis, building the futur federal europe of the next generation which will come after us, etc 

&gt;  and put their heads in the sand

I'm misquoting a bit, but yes we are burrying our heads in the sand on that one. But if we can keep doing it, it'll just costs us less on a long run to stall out the russians till they bankrupt than all out deal with them.

Soit, mais c'est bien pour ça que le code de TrueCrypt a été audité à plusieurs reprises par des comités d'experts!  Donc une fois de plus, je vois pas trop ou tu veux en venir (et je dis vraiment pas ça pour être désagréable!)

De plus, dire que ""le gros problème est la génération des clés"" trahi souvent un manque de connaissance dans le domaine.  Certes, c'est *un* des problèmes, mais c'est pas non plus ""le gros"" problème.  Il y a les questions du mode de chiffrement (*c.f.* le fiasco de Flickr qui à utilisé le mode ECB, permettant un ""chosen-boundary attack"" il y à qques années) et l'authentification des cryptogrammes (HMAC, etc...), pour en citer deux autres.

S'assurer de la qualité d'une implémentation de PRNG me semble être la base de tout audit sérieux.  Il s'agit la de méthodes publiés, donc ce n'est ni le plus difficil, ni la chose la plus apte à passer à la trappe.

Ce qui pose problème, c'est souvent (a) de bonnes méthodes utilisés dans de mauvais contextes (e.g., crypter 10 Tb avec un algo à bloc de 64 bits ou crypter une image en EBC) ou alors (b) des bugs de programmation (*c.f.* heartbleed).

&gt;Les standards sont une chose, et sont déjà douteux.

true,iisno1uno,LITH,Lithuania,"it will be done in the upcoming year or two. there are some reasons why there's been such a delay on this issue.

* our constitution is very strict. Poland's government thinks that this is just an excuse our politicians use, but it really is very strict. and in every matter, not only this one. and to change constitution parliament has to jump through hoops, they have to have 65% majority in the parliament, vote on it few times, and take breaks which can last up to a year. so realistically changing 1 article in constitution can take 2-4 years, WHEN there is strong political will to do so. 

* and that's another issue - political will. Lithuanians do not like what Poland's poles are talking, and you can see that kind of talk in this thread also. every time someone mentions Vilnius there's always a Pole saying *Wilno nasze* and claiming that Lithuanians and Russians stole it from them. ant this is programmed into nation's memory, and this mentality is kinda threatening for a Lithuanian. 

* Polish minority party itself do not REALLY want to do something about it. because now they can always play that oppressed minority card and win seats in the parliaments. if everything is resolved, there's no conflict and media attention they would be forgotten by Polish voters altogether. they have in the Lithuanian government for almost 2 years already, they kinda do not do nothing anything except trying to pass laws banning ""gay propaganda"". 

now there are some positive things too. after the recent Constitutional court decision month or two back there's finally basically no obstacles for the parliament to change the law and let Polish surnames in the passports. mind you, vast majority of Lithuanians support that kind of decision since that affects them too - now if Lithuanian girl would get married to Arnold Schwarzenegger, she couldn't write his surname on her passport, it could be changed to Švarcneger or something. and think about the kids. real mess. 

I believe this law could pass as soon as this autumn since major Lithuanian parties seemingly reached an agreement and only technicalities left to discuss.

true,TheEndgame,NORW,Norway,"&gt; I have many friends who are between $40,000 and $80,000 in debt after a bachelors degree. That's 239000 NOK to 479000

It's not totally unrealistic to have the same amount of debt when you graduate here as well.

&gt; And most likely, you are going to be working a low end job that pays between $8.00 and $15.00 an hour if you only have a bachelors.

I bet it depends a lot on which degree you have. You will not get a super high paying job here either if you have a degree in something that has no demand. Then you end up with a job that has no relation to your studies while having debt. It sucks.

&gt; And I have been to Norway. Your roads are just as bad as the shitty freeways and surface streets in most of California. And yes, it is much cheaper for us to own cars, but in CA, we need them. We have virtually no public transportation. and our urban sprawl is hilariously

I highly doubt your roads are just as bad. I have been to the U.S and the roads are much better. I haven't been to California, but i find it hard to believe how they can be much worse considering there isn't any ""winter"" there. 

Also it is only in the two or three largest cities you can rely on public transport here. Even there it has a hard time coping with rush hour. I live in a smaller town in Northern Norway and you absolutely need a car here. Distances are long and public transport is pretty much non-existent. The funny thing is that those places that have good public transport, usually have decent roads as well. The rest of us have to deal with the worst of both worlds.

&gt; We also have waits for the doctor. My brother has hepatitis C (his liver is damn near dead), and he can't get a doctors appointment until August.

If it's true then it is quite sad. But this doesn't really seem to be the norm. Americans who come here are often shocked that they can't get an appointment the same week.

&gt; Only the poorest of the poor get any kind of scholastic financial aid that isn't loans. And for those of us who are lower middle class? Those loans carry about a 6.8% interest rate.

I find it hard to believe you have to pay 6,8% interest. The fixed interest rate have gone down the last few years. If you have a floating loan i assume the interest can't be that high considering the low interest rate the central bank has set. Not to mention student loans are very risky to lend out and the terms are extremely flexible.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Technology_Wants

We don't decide that Europe is a common project. Its the way our economies has grown together, the technology which enables us to transport goods, people and interconnect. It's the tail that is wagging the dog. EU is not the result of politicians in post war Europe who designed and strived for a new Europe, it is politicians who are trying to reflect the changes which forces itself.

This is why the so called integration of Europe is at full speed, even if a lot, maybe most people are against it at some level. That is why it is so frustrating for people, that is why they feel this powerlessness in the face of Europe. Because they think this process stems from the EU as a large centralized entity, and they feel that they cannot control it, because they cannot, because the EU itself is under its control.

The integration of Europe is driven by capital, by technology, by the desire of people to make a better life for themselves by moving to another country within the EU, or use labour from another country, It is driven by the ease of falling in love with a woman from Portugal, or a bearded man from Austria.

Well yes, that the gist of the argument: to let more country in prevented the union from becoming tighter. It has grown wider but not deeper.

&gt;Lies, even among those who want to leave the EU, actual contempt is rare. 

The ""contempting party"" here is Cameron, and this is about him trying to appoint someone else than Juncker.

&gt;Yes threaten your allies and long term friends. 

You have to really want it to see that as a threat.

&gt;Ah, because not rushing the integration of 28 completely separate nations is so insidious.

That's exactly the point of the previous argument, that you refused to acknowledge: enlargement hinders integration.

&gt;Why did we not listen? Because the empire was released. 

And yet one of the most common argument of British Eurosceptic is ""without the EU, we would be able to capitalize more on our special link with the Commonwealth""

&gt;Because france doesn't get special treatment... we're still a huge contributor.

The difference is that France either flat out cheats on the rules (and gets fined for that) or proposes general rules (the most obvious example here is the CAP, which has a general purpose (food independence) and applies for all countries (as a result countries like Poland are starting to get more and more money while France has become a net contributor to the CAP segment of the budget), not opt-outs justified by nothing but self-interest  -- incidentally, the differences between British and continental agriculture structures was one of the major reasons for de Gaulle to blackball the UK)

&gt;I highly doubt your roads are just as bad. I have been to the U.S and the roads are much better. I haven't been to California, but i find it hard to believe how they can be much worse considering there isn't any ""winter"" there.

 
California does have winter. Just not the coastal areas. This state is as big as the whole country of Sweden. And we have the third worst roads in the country. There is very little upkeep, and the constant traffic and congestion has led to roads that as are incredibly deteriorated. Potholes are common, large cracks are prevalent, and the roads are really damn bumpy.

&gt;If it's true then it is quite sad. But this doesn't really seem to be the norm. Americans who come here are often shocked that they can't get an appointment the same week.

California has very few doctors compared to the need. And when they find out you are on medicaid (state sponsored health care for the poorest of the poor) they are much less likely to make room for you in their books. A few years ago there was very little wait time, but that is becoming the case less and less. I think many Americans have never actually had to book a doctors appointment for anything more than checkups or pediatrics (which seem to have much shorter wait times), so they don't realize just how hard it is to see a doctor 

&gt;I find it hard to believe you have to pay 6,8% interest. The fixed interest rate have gone down the last few years. If you have a floating loan i assume the interest can't be that high considering the low interest rate the central bank has set. Not to mention student loans are very risky to lend out and the terms are extremely flexible. This means that if you have trouble paying them of you can get a really low monthly payment.

Believe it or not, my interest rate on government loans are 6.8%, and I just finished school in December. And we can get our monthly payment lowered, but then that just means you will end up in debt for an even longer period of time. And we don't get floating interest rates for student loans. They are fixed at 6.8%, or occasionally, very rarely, 3.8%. I owe $10k at 6.8% and $3k at 3.8%. That was for only 2 years of school.

&gt;     (and again good luck taking a night bus around the GdN...)
&gt; Gare de l’Est, which is just next to Gare du Nord (and St Christopher’s hostel is between the two stations), is one of the five big hubs for night busses in Paris, so I don’t know what you are talking about…

See above.

&gt; Montparnasse and La Motte-Piquet are not very close to each other (4 metro stops on line 6), 

Both close to ""Commerce"" - my point. Anyone may google some RATP map to be sure (and four stations, that IS close).

&gt;and both offer less transportation options than Gare du Nord/Gare de l’Est, 0 RER line versus 3 for instance.

Did I say the opposite ?

&gt; Gare du Nord is a more popular and more culturally diverse area than the XVth arrondissement, 

This is not a problem of ""cultural diversity"", but rather a problem of chronic incivility (see above).

&gt; and from the general tone of your posts I think that’s the real problem for you.

the article begins with few basic details:
- On Monday Origo.hu’s editor-in-chief, Gergő Sáling was unexpectedly dismissed.
- As a consequence many employees of Hungary’s leading news website, practically all at the politics desk, quit.
- Both German economic interests and Hungarian politics have been deeply involved in the succession of events.
- The fate of Origo.hu as an independent news website had been sealed before the new editor-in-chief was appointed in November 2013.
- You can read the original Hunagrian article here [ http://444.hu/2014/06/05/a-telekom-mar-tavaly-atengedte-az-origot-a-kormanynak/ ]

In the Soviet Era, gay people didn't exist. Nobody knew any. They were just these mythical things that died from AIDS in America or something. Gay men were just mentally ill deviants/perverts, at best. Gay women were just confused and needed a proper man. Yes I'm sure someone will chime in with actual historical examples of commie homos, but that's my anecdotal experience.

Our current constitution was ratified in 1992, a time when only Denmark had ""Registered Partnerships"" whatever that is.

And as mentioned earlier it just defines marriage as a willing relationship between a man and a woman.

Anyway yeah it's sad and annoying, but I want to point out that there's little ill will in the matter. It's a cultural problem. If you ask someone on the street if gay people should get married, they'll probably tell you ""no"". If you ask them why, they'll stutter and struggle. Some don't even manage to grasp the concept of being gay. The country isn't that religious. Especially the younger population.

If anything, this issue just reflects the immaturity of our country, as a true western nation, and one of a slew of cultural and political problems that we managed to inherit from the Soviet Union.",0,1402017298,null,0,1402018031,0,ci0brk8,t3_27asux,t1_ci0brk8,t1_ci0bamy,null,1434113916,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The whole 'jealous of our freedom' thing is a bunch of drivel propaganda to try and rally the population because most of the population is apathetic to the actual political reasons, meaning it wouldn't get as much support or interest.

The only freedom related issue is that a lot of extremists want an international sharia law. But that's not directly why they're killing people.

true,iisno1uno,LITH,Lithuania,"that fear is also programmed into Lithuanian mentality, since we always were between major powers and felt always oppressed. 

even during our common Rzeczpospolita times, which Poland considers as good, Lithuania actually has negative connotations to it, since we were lesser brothers in the union, all the high born were speaking/slowly converting to Polish and Lithuanian was just language of the peasants. and after that we were sold to the Russians, who started real oppression. not such a bright thing to remember.

now about the figures itself, it is not as bad as it seems. it's very dependable of the phrasing of the question. if you would ask: do you think Poland is a threat to the Lithuania? I believe 10% at most would say yes and I'm being generous there. 

now I really don't care was Mickevičius Polish or Lithuanian (actually question is whom he was considering himself to be, which is question without any reasonable answer. of course *Litwo, ojczyzno moja* says it all:) or was Wilno more Polish than Lithuanian - it's the history. and that means it's the past. we live now, and we have to forget some stupid ghosts from the history which really doesn't matter now. what matters is that big brother from the East, which was a threat to all of us for centuries, - still is a threat, because neither their leaders neither common population do not want to forget their imperialistic ambitions. 

that's why Tomasevski has been called Kremlin agent numerous occasions. and there are some proof or at least reasonable doubts where he gets his money from. and right now his behavior openly supporting Russian aggression, anti-EU remarks and so on shows that he is more pro-Russian than pro-Polish. many here believes that all this Polish minority issues are being created out of thin air as part of Kremlin's *Divide et impera* tactics. 

and of course there's [Polish ultras]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWrP8PyZOjo who makes some noise every time they come to Lithuania. 1 time they totally destroyed stadion, two times just a friendly clashes between them and police, and actually the last time they were here (video) it was quite nice and peaceful, of course *Wilno nasze* and *Polskie Wilno* graffiti was seen in some places. however it just makes me smile, as the most Lithuanians.

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

Ich möchte mich hiermit für den Mastersstudiengang “Germanistik” mit dem Studienschwerpunkt Sprachwissenschaft, oder einen anderen, ähnlichen Studiengang, für das Wintersemester 2014/15 bewerben. *you're not interested in applying - you're applying. This is Germany after all so better get straight to the point* Mein Karriereziel ist es, Übersetzer mit A-Sprache Englisch und B-Sprache Deutsch zu werden.
__ - __ absolvierte ich meinen Bachelor of Arts an der ___ University. *this is just a suggestion and I'm sure you put in elsewhere but better give the name of your university and when you went there. Also I changed the time most of your text was written in from Perfekt to Präteritum, just because it sounds way more elegant* Ich begann in der neunten Klasse Deutsch zu lernen, und besuchte alle vier Jahre der High School Deutschkurse. Dazu gehörte ""Advanced Placement German"", wobei ich die Prüfungsnote 4 (von möglichen 5) bekam. *You used the word ""vertiefen"" twice. It doesn't work in this context unfortunately, so i tried to work around it* Des Weiteren studierte ich im Wintersemester 2009/10 und Sommersemester 2010 als Austauschstudent an der Universität Bonn.
Ich strebe diesen Studiengang an, da ich die deutsche Sprache und Kultur geliebt habe, seitdem ich begann Deutsch zu lernen. In der High School beschäftigte ich mich so viel wie möglich mit der deutschen Sprache: Ich wurde Vizepräsident des Deutschklubs, spielte Hänsel in dessen Darstellung von „Hänsel und Gretel“, und wurde in die National German Honor Society eingeführt. Ich beschloss zwei Auslandssemester einzulegen um meine Sprachkenntnisse weiter zu vertiefen. Während meines Studiums in Deutschland besuchte ich nicht nur Deutschkurse, sondern unter anderem auch Kurse über Deutsche Kultur, Business, und Geschichte. Ich wusste, um die kleinen Nuancen der Sprachen völlig zu verstehen, müsste ich mich mit dem geschichtlichen und kulturellen Hintergrund der Sprache vertraut machen. 
An meiner Heimatuniversität gründete ich einen Deutschklub, in dem ich bis zu meinem Abschluss aktives Mitglied war. Mein Zeil ist es, die deutsche Sprache völlig zu meistern, um zu helfen eine Brücke zwischen den deutschsprachigen und englischsprachigen Räumen zu bauen; mehr Verständnis zu schaffen und kulturellen Austausch zu fördern. *that last bit is just a bonus. I just thought it sounded good and fitted in well with what you were trying to say*
Ich hoffe mein Masterstudium in Deutschland zu absolvieren, denn ich finde, dass Deutschland der bester Ort für mich ist um die erforderlichen Fähigkeiten zu erlangen und Deutsch-Englischer Übersetzer zu werden, wie es schon lange mein Traum ist. Deutschland (ist eine wichtige politische Macht in Europa geworden und *personally I would leave this bit out even though it's gramatically correct, just because it's irrelevant in this context and seems a bit out of place*) bietet eines der besten Bildungswesen der ganzen Welt. Deutsche Universitäten sind weltberühmt und haben zu vielen der bedeutensten Entdeckungen der Geschichte beigetragen. Studenten können an deutschen Universitäten Theorie mit praktischer Anwendung verbinden, was ihnen hilft sich auf ihr zukünftiges Berufsleben vorbereiten. Deutschland ist das Land der Dichter und Denker und ist aus diesem Grund der beste Ort für mich meine Sprachkenntnisse zu vertiefen, mein Verständnis für die Deutsche Kultur und Lebensweise zu erweitern und als Übersetzter Verständnis und Offenheit zu schaffen um kulturelle Barrieren aufzubrechen. *Okay I may have gone a bit over board on that last bit. Sorry*

It's like 4am but I apparently my grammar brain isn't fried yet. If you have any questions pm me anytime you like. I tried to stay faithful to your original text but I just want to make everything to sound as pretty as I can :) 
Another thing you might want to consider is mention something about the particular university you want to attend and why you think they would be right for you, as opposed to just the german educational system in general. However your german is actually really good so I wouldn't worry too much. 
I hope I could help and again, pm me if you need anything. ",0,1402019566,null,0,false,0,ci0covz,t3_27feuy,t1_ci0covz,t3_27feuy,null,1434114352,2,false,German,t5_2qq51,2

Do you understand that if we would go from EU, that Russia would be our only and inevitable option? And Putin knows that.

The problem with the euro""skeptic"" Basic Finns is that only a minor part of the party is those nutheads that want to leave EU. And many of them are re-thinking that rhetoric. Looks like they have seen what goes on in Ukraine and what was the situation before 1939 Winter War. 

Also the most rascist part is also lowering their tone. Maybe they have understood that Finns are a very small nation in this global world and that to get help you must be ready to offer help.

The most radical Basic Finn party MP who got elected was Jussi Halla-aho:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussi_Halla-aho

&gt;Halla-aho is a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), having written his dissertation about historical nominal morphology of Old Church Slavonic.[7][43] Halla-aho studied at the University of Helsinki from 1995 to 2000. During his post-graduate period (2000–2006), he worked at the Department of Slavonic and Baltic Studies as a researcher and teacher of Old Church Slavic.[3] Halla-aho has published two articles in scientific journals, has been interested in comparative Indo-European linguistics, and has written Old Church Slavic Manual, which is used at the University of Helsinki.[3]

He was a rookie when he got elected to the Finnish MP, but time will tell is he really a ""patriotic"" type or a Russian Trojan Horse... By looking his body-language after he got elected, he was looking worried and confused. 

Finnish ex prime minister Paavo Lipponen said that he (Halla-aho) is a dangerous man to Finland. Don't know what he meant actually because Paavo Lipponen is working for Gazprom (also).

&gt;

&gt;___Die Brücke___ (English: The Bridge) is a 1959 West German film directed by Austrian filmmaker [Bernhard Wicki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Wicki). It is based on the [eponymous 1958 novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Br%C3%BCcke_(novel\)) by journalist and writer [Gregor Dorfmeister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Dorfmeister) (published under the [pseudonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym) *Manfred Gregor*). The story was based on an actual event, upon the personal report of a surviving veteran who in his own youth experienced a similar situation in [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II).

&gt;The film was timely in West Germany as the [Bundeswehr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundeswehr) had only recently been created in 1955 with [conscription in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Germany) beginning in 1956.

You need to consider all member-states equal if you want a federation to actually work. I personally, despite the shitty name it gets, actually prefer the American electoral college even though I think it needs reform in a couple areas.

Each state gets 2 electoral votes each for it's two Senators, and all are guaranteed at least 1 additional electoral vote for their guaranteed Representative *(plus all their additional representatives depending on their population)*. So while California still has 30 electoral votes to swing around, something like Wyoming is still guaranteed 3 *(the individual voter in Wyoming carries more weight than Cali in such a election, but that's the price you pay when you agree that states are somewhat equal in a union, even if they're dwarfed by others)*.

EU States could do it like Maine and Nebraska which use the ""congressional district method"", selecting one elector within each congressional district by popular vote and selecting the remaining two electors by a statewide popular vote.

This helps balance it out in my mind; giving the larger states the influence they deserve while maintaining the voice of the smaller states so they don't get boxed out &amp; disregarded.

After Scottish Independence, we won't have *one* ally in the EU, we'll have dozens, of which Scotland will be one. Let's not forget that we have major NATO allies in the EU.

Let's also not forget that Scotland and the US share huge international, cultural, and historical ties. Thanks to the Highland Clearances and the Irish Potato Famine, we have more people of various kinds of Gaelic ancestry in the US than we do people from England. 

Of the 43 presidents we've had, something like 25 of them have been Scottish-American or Scots-Irish. 

That's not going to go away just because the Union Jack loses its blue, and the Saltire flies alone.

And no.

No it is NOT true that Scotland can keep the UK in the EU.

Of every single election that the Scots have participated in in the 20th and 21st centuries, their votes would never once have changed the ultimate outcome, if subtracted.

This is true of referendums, of general elections, of everything. 

Scotland is not the linchpin of the UK.

In fact, a Scottish Exit is likely to cause a Labour party resurgence, as the UK blames the tories for the destruction of the United Kingdom. 

For the eurosceptics, it will be an unmitigated disaster.

But if Scotland stays in, there will be no left wing resurgence.

Second, I think that the mindset you are using, equating loans to a goods or service transaction is similar to the one that caused the recent banking crisis.

If you give some guy $10, he uses them to buy a meal, then at the end of the week the restaurant uses $8 of these to buy some ingredients, you added $18 of transaction to the GDP

If you give a bank $10, it loans $9 to another bank, which offers $8 of these as loans to people, there are effectively $19 in the books, but they were not used to produce anything, and if you look at it closely, only $8 are there to be used.

What you say about velocity is right though. There are situations where banks or investors need to have enough money to help companies produce.

This is the second time you are attempting to redirect your original claim, it makes for a needlessly frustrating conversation of me having to quote your original text and point out that you did indeed use the ECB vs BoE example as a direct comparison to national governments being more democratic (as stated in your OP):

&gt;""Lack of democracy"" when spoken by the British means ""power should be returned to national parliaments"".

Can we at least agree that you said this?  It is obvious that you are referring directly to democracy when you say  ""it's about at what level are the decisions taken.""

Have you now read up on the ECB mandate and why they are not capable of the same actions as the BoE?  You treat them as if they are identical entities making arbitrarily different decisions based on ""how close they are to the people"".  The ECB literally does not have the same privileges as the Boe in handling any form of crisis because of national governments scared of losing power, hence crippling the lot of us.  

&gt;Do you think we should deny the Scottish a referendum?
If not, why is it any different for the entire UK to have a referendum on leaving the EU?

Did you not learn in school the circumstances behind the Acts of Union and the difference with the British requests to join the EC?  **Martial law** had to be imposed in Scotland due to the wild unpopularity of their government's decision.  It is historical record that the English thoroughly bribed all relevant Scottish leaders to ensure a Union they had attempted militarily many times before, which was not wanted by roughly 75% of the Scottish population.  If you think these are not different, I see no further reason for discussion.  Scotland shouldn't even need a referendum, they should be granted their sovereignty unilaterally by the English, with the ability to rejoin only be referendum!

- Pensi in futuro di andare a lavorare in Cina? Nel caso ti considereresti un laowai o cercheresti di integrarti il più possibile?

I could ask you the same about you and reading what I stated for at least two comments now. My problem is not that they are opening this particular formal investigation. My problem is that they haven't done so in both cases a.) spying on citizens and b.) spying on the Chancellor.

Here's the question I've been asking: what makes case b.) different that they are sufficiently confident to find evidence?

It's the same organisation and government who allegedly did this in both cases a.) and b.). In case a.), the reasoning was that with such an organisation doing it, and no eye-witness present, they wouldn't find any eveidence.

How is this different from b.)? Why might there be evidence in case b.), but not in case a.)?

**That** is what I am asking. Because it seems like a great double-standard, and it gives the very real impression that the Chancellor's privacy is important, but not mine, or the one of my family, or any other citizen for that matter. Case b.) is, to some extend, even a subset of case. a.). You could at least take the *very same evidence* and get at least evidence for the NSA spying on one German citizen. Then look for more with the same procedure as you did in case b.). [Edit: Apparently they are at least planning on doing this. Added the quote in the edit. I only saw your above edit afterwards.]

I don't give a flying fuck about their PR-talk in how they're ""still looking into case a.)"". If there isn't any official investigation, there might as well be nothing done, because we can't hold them accountable legally. And if I read things correctly, there isn't an official investigation planned .. because we won't find any evidence. In a.). But we will in b.). Alright then:

How is b.) different?

Of course you don't get the full picture if you only go to one part of Germany, but the alternative is to spend your whole time on the road and then you still don't get to really experience Germany.

It's the same with every other country in the world, barring microstates like Monaco and Singapore. If somebody comes back from a city break in Beijing, are you going to tell him that he didn't *really* get to know China? OP never said he'd ""got to know Germany"", only that he visited Germany, which is absolutely true. He had a couple of questions, and if the answer is ""It's not like that everywhere in Germany"", that's a perfectly valid answer and I'm sure he'd be happy with it.

Besides, although all the places he visited were in the modern federal state of Bavaria, they weren't all in ""real"" Bavaria -- Altbayern, which is Upper Bavaria, Lower Bavaria and the Upper Palatinate. Swabia and Franconia don't count. Nuremberg and Rothenburg are in Middle Franconia. The Franconians aren't Bavarians, and actually resent the fact that the region is so badly represented in Munich.

It's also not true to say that you can forget everything you saw in Bavaria as totally unlike the rest of Germany. Sorry, but that's simply not true. There is great regional variation, yes, but ""even the language"" is taking regional pride to a ludicrous extreme. I know that Germans love to think that the various dialects are totally different languages, but the fact of the matter is that in the places OP went to, he'll have heard even most of the locals speaking standard German with a Bavarian lilt.",0,1402039810,null,0,false,0,ci0jdvj,t3_27elu8,t1_ci0jdvj,t1_ci06ude,null,1434117512,28,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,28

We might not like the people we put in power but don't forget *we the people put them in power.* I'm not sure how I feel about Iraq, but I know we fucked up there, and I know Afghanistan was justified, and we made a mistake by diverting necessary personnel, equipment and attention away from it towards Iraq.

That said, and the reason I say I'm unsure about Iraq, is because for all intents and purposes, Saddam was a murdering genocidal asshole but the *cassus belli* for the invasion was based on false pretenses and the occupation was mismanaged horrendously. But I believe greatest mistake was [we put this fuckwad in charge for the crucial first stage of the occupation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bremer#Criticism_and_controversies). 

There's not many incompetent cunts like Paul Bremer out there, but fuck if we didn't go and find one. Just like we managed to pick he one bullshit *cassus belli* from the mile-long laundry list of shit we could've justified action against Saddam for.

&gt;You're just being melodramatic here.

No, I'm not.

Right now the entire fucking military obligations for the continent are on America, Britain &amp; France's shoulder. France has recently had to cut spending below 2%, all while they're tied up in Africa in a number of different operations.

And you don't think Scotland seceding is going to have a domino effect on us &amp; France? We've been telling Europe to get it's shit together for years, but nothing, and now one of the foundations for it's security is about to have to do some serious fucking re-budgeting. 

We're pivoting towards the Pacific. We are stretched thin and this is going to stretch us thinner. France is barely able to manage militarily at the level it is, but now it has to spend more to compensate for reduced British capabilities?

Are the Scottish going to step up their military funding and deploy troops to Mali &amp; CAR? Is Scotland going to be able to handle something like Libya next time EU member-states want to call for some shit?

Or is it just going to fall on us &amp; France's shoulders? And what's left of the United Kingdom? You don't think this is going to effect any contingency planning in relation to Eastern Europe? You don't think us &amp; France are going to have to increase our commitments there as well?

You don't think that's going to be hurt? You don't think our closest ally loosing not only a good chunk of their hard power, but a good chunk of their soft power as well isn't going to adversely affect my country?

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is, as per Article V, a mutual defense pact.

But anyway, because of NATO, Austria is under a security blanket. Why? Well, because you joined the European Union which ALSO guarantees mutual defense.

And like I said, even though Sweden is doing the same, at least they've stepped up recently and shouldered a decent share of the burden given the pretty obvious change in reality.

Yes, moltissimo, da quando provai un Earl Grey comediocomanda in Inghilterra, a foglia libera e fiori di bergamotto...una rivelazione!


&gt; Lo bevete a cazzo o con criterio? 

Con criterio: acqua pura quanto si puo', temperatura dell'acqua appropriata (anche se a occhio), tempo d'infusione giusta, e no zucchero. E io sono pure una zucchero dipendente,ma nel té no.


&gt; Qualità preferite? 

The verde cinese, soprattutto. Di questi tempi un Moli Hua del Guanxi, al gelsomino, un the comunissimo e casalingo in Cina, ma a me rimette in pace col mondo. Amo quelli poco erbosi e chiari, ma un Lapsang Suching fortissimo e super affumicato m'ha aperto un mondo.


&gt; Quanto ne bevete? 

2-3 tazze al giorno, incoraggiata dal fatto che il mio ragazzo, irlandese, ne beve a oltranza: ma lui beve quella roba nera come l'inferno di Assam e Ceylon che bevono in Irlanda, che senza latte sa di crema di polvere da sparo.  


&gt; Tè migliore mai bevuto? 

Il Wing Hop Fung, anche detto Silver Monkey, un té bianco. Caro come la vita, ma sa di paradiso.


&gt;Tè peggiore? 

Di quelle schifezze ai frutti rossi: meglio un Lipton regolare a quel punto. E poi un the inglese col latte preso alla stazione dei treni a Londra....sapeva di risciacquatura di piatti!

&gt; Frequentate sale da tè? 

Magari, ma solo una a Maastricht che era davvero prodigiosa, ma un po' pretenziosa e cara!

It belonged to the old left-liberal mafia that had a strong grip on the country because of the contacts they inherited from the Communist system and the contacts they made internationally, and Fidesz was basically elected to break that grip. 

Anyway, the point is this. **It is not a conflict between a government and independents, it is just yet another battle in the left vs. right war, the power struggle between two large and entrenched elites.**

The point is for some reason in Hungary left-liberals like to disguise themselves as independent centrist. But it is usually a lie. Even the name Origo suggests center. This is just a trick. There is no center here, because the matters are so grave that it is impossible to take a neutral stance.

Why?

&gt;our Parliament is made up of our fellow countrymen

The EP is made up of your fellow Europeans.

&gt;who actually live here, not foreigners who live hundreds of miles away from British soil.

Funny, Brussels is about as close to London as Liverpool, York and Plymouth. They all live on European soil, anyway. Why should Yorkshire accept people that don't live on Yorkish soil to rule over them?

&gt;Wales has a devolved administration just like Scotland, if they wanted to become independent they could request a referendum from London which would be granted, just like Scotland. The reason there is no referendum on the horizon is because the vast majority of the Welsh electorate approve of the UK. Scotland will most likely remain the UK too, not once have the polls indicated Scotland will secede from the Union.

Woosh. I was pointing at your assertion that ""The England of 1707 cannot be held responsible for the actions of the England of 1284"".

&gt;If the majority of the international community recognised my collection of streets then, and only then would it be a nation. Why is this so hard to understand? Do you consider the Confederate States of America a nation? What about Afghanistan under the Taliban? Were they a legitimate state?

The point is that decision centers can and do change, and aren't unchangeably and eternally decreed by nature.

&gt;It's funny you should mention sovereignty when you're so in favour of it being taken away permanently from the countries of Europe.

It's not ""taken away"", it's being exercised by other means.

&gt;And they don't recognise Cornwall as a state because it has none of the features of a nation-state.

They don't recognize Cornwall because Cornwall hasn't asked them. But should Cornwall do what is necessary to claim independence, eventually they will be and it won't be unnatural either.


&gt;A single European nation encompassing all the current members of the EU.

You should be more careful with the distinction between nation and state. Obviously a single European nation is absurd. A single European state, why not? There's plenty of leeway in centralization and which powers are exercised where.

&gt;The abolition of my country

That's a dramatic hyperbole. It reveals that it's an emotional matter to you, while to me a state is merely a tool for the benefit of its citizens. Perhaps that explains while I'm more willing to redesign it if that seems useful.

&gt;in favour of rule by a centralised European government. 

The degree of centralization remains to be determined. The UK is much more centralized than eg. Germany.

I repeat: In any case, it's up to Britain to decide how their representatives in the EU will act. If that involves a referendum (or a mock battle, or a pie-eating contest), go ahead.

You can't. You either accept that secrets will be leaked or you do something unethical. The problem with this is we have an established system for dealing with these cases.

They'd rather destroy the principles of our system of justice than face the political fall out associated with such an affront.

They do it for free otherwise. It's not cheap. If you decide to bury him, shop around for caretakers. It's extremely disturbing and distateful I know, but some have outrageous prices.

Regarding an autopsy, I don't know because my grandma died of a heart attack in a hospital so nobody had doubts about what happened. Google tells me the family can request an autopsy at the local city hall within 24h of death. You need to tell the doctor who signed the death certificate that you don't want an inhumation. Then you have to go to the hospital to sign a bunch of forms, then they'll do it. You have to pay for everything.

If you oppose what the rest of the family has decided (cremation), you need to contact the city hall **TODAY** so that they don't proceed with cremation.

And learn how to use them as well: you can't just bash in a word and get a translation. Check *all* the entries, check back translations, and if there are forum posts on the subject, check those as well.

For professional translations, you also need a resource like linguee.de, especially for technical terms. This shows you how other people have translated those terms and how they were used in context: this is invaluable.

That still isn't always enough, though. I sometimes resort to searching the net for websites containing the term I need and hoping they have English versions of their own sites or documentation.

For very specific terms, especially scientific terms, Wikipedia can sometimes help. For example, if you have a word like ""Papageischnabelsperling"", you can look it up on German Wikipedia, look down the left-hand sidebar, click on ""English"" and it takes you to ""Parrot-billed sparrow"".

Because they are British.

&gt; The EP is made up of your fellow Europeans.

So? Sorry to break your delusion but there is no pan-European feeling in Britain. Quite frankly the vast majority of us don't give a damn about the politics of other nations. The British government exists solely for the interests of the British people, why is it so hard for you to understand not everyone supports internationalism? I don't care Europe is filled with fellow Europeans, they are not British and therefore I do not want Britain to be ruled by them.

&gt;Woosh. I was pointing at your assertion that ""The England of 1707 cannot be held responsible for the actions of the England of 1284"".

It can't. It's a fundamental part of our system of governance that Parliament cannot be bound by previous administrations. By your logic we should hold Mongolia responsible for Genghis Khan in a court of law. Hell, why not take Ethiopia to court for colonising the entire world with humans? Where do you stop? Is 423 years not enough to make a government not responsible? Where do you draw the line?

&gt;That's a dramatic hyperbole. It reveals that it's an emotional matter to you, while to me a state is merely a tool for the benefit of its citizens. Perhaps that explains while I'm more willing to redesign it if that seems useful.

There is nothing emotional about not wanting to be ruled by a foreign power the majority of our country want nothing to do with.

&gt;The degree of centralization remains to be determined. The UK is much more centralized than eg. Germany.

&gt;I repeat: In any case, it's up to Britain to decide how their representatives in the EU will act. If that involves a referendum (or a mock battle, or a pie-eating contest), go ahead.

You are still dodging my question. You federalists will sacrifice the right of self-determination to subjugate the people of Europe under a single government which outside of federalist circles the people do not want, do not need and are quite frankly disgusted by.

&gt;__Taxonomy__ is the practice and science of classification. The word is also used as a [count noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_noun): __a taxonomy__, or __taxonomic scheme__, is a particular [classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorization). The word finds its roots in the [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language) τάξις, *taxis* (meaning 'order', 'arrangement') and νόμος, *nomos* ('law' or 'science'). Originally *taxonomy* referred only to the classifying of organisms or a particular classification of organisms. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] In a wider, more general sense, it may refer to a classification of things or concepts, as well as to the principles underlying such a classification. Taxonomy is different from [meronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meronomy) which is dealing with the classification of parts of a whole.

true,Baxaxaxa,ANAR,☭ INTERNATIONALISM ☭,"&gt; good balance between capitalism and socialism

There is no sliding scale between capitalism and socialism like there is none between use value and exchange value. There can only be a sliding scale if you take capitalism for granted and simply think socialism is capitalism with more food stamps and nationalized industry, in which case socialism, the supercession of capitalism and the actual working class movement has simply been conjured away by ideology. The things people learn in high school history class today are so ideological it is unbelievable. Kids don't even know anymore what the Cold War was about, namely casual geopolitics in a bipolar capitalist world, between industrialized and industrializing.

&gt;SU stays behind because of communistic system.

In 1917 Russia went through an agrarian (capitalist) revolution in the same way as England and France did in the preceding centuries, except it had to develop wage labour and capital from the top-down because of imperialist interests from the already industrialzed world. (although all previous bourgeois revolutions had a kind of top-down character to begin with) The Soviet Union didn't stay behind because 'communism', it actually developed greatly but at the price of a lot of suffering and destruction (like in all periods of transformation from quasi late-feudalism to capitalist-industrialism) due to its top-down developmental model, which didn't have anything to do with socialism or communism, except if you think every country in the world is 'socialist' right now. The only way in which the communist revolution could have become something was if it had succeeded in the West, which actually had a mature working class which had a hundred years of headstart compared to Russia.

The same thing happened in China, and the same results were achieved. These countries were in their revolutionary transformation from pre-capitalism into industrial capitalism and there was nothing special about them. This also means that they were historically specific, and not the product of some ahistorical idealistic principles of 'totalitarianism' or 'greed', or whatever. The consciousness of dear leader matters nothing. It are the economic forces of production which dictate the general form of society, which is ironically what Marx was all about. Following the defeat of the international revolution of the 1917-1923 period, the Russian capitalist state which had crushed the soviets had to justfiy its existence, upon which it corrupted socialism and Marxism into some kind of idealistic-voluntaristic moral 'ideology' which attracted revolutionary adventurist types, college kids and most of all oppressed colonial subjects, which have nothing to do with communism which is the supercession of capitalism, and which is an objective movement within the economic structure based on exchange value. Thus was forged the greatest lie ever told namely that the the USSR, the antithesis of socialism, the state that was built on a failed revolution and was its necessary outcome, and which would even have a track record of crushing communist revolutions at home and abroad (Kronstadt, Ukraine, Hungary, etc), was 'socialist'. With that the real movement of working people who wanted nothing but a decent life and an end to the oppression of the state since the 19th century and which makes up the true heritage of almost all of us, was removed from the historical record in favour of more bourgeois elitism and top-down Metternichian history, in which anything done by the lowly proles, the *rabble*, is seen as dangerous or vulgar. 

So history teaching becomes religious. It becomes a matter of good versus evil. It can not adequately explain the Interbellum period or the Cold War. It can not teach from a class perspective or its hallowed liberal 'middle ground' which has been irrelevant and out of touch since the middle of the 19th century would lose face.

Yeah, this always strikes me as strange. If anything one of the great strengths of Marx is that he is not prescriptive in the slightest. His whole project is about how there are certain tendencies in capitalist society which are beyond human control and consciousness. Marxism is not about politics or Blanquist-Robespierrianism, except if you ask a Stalinist/inverse-Marxist.

It is also ironic when people accuse Marx of wanting to impose some kind of blueprint on society or of him being 'historicist', when Marx actually was the greatest critic of this kind of idealism. Marx revolutionized philosophy with his materialism, but people do not know what this means. They think he is an idealist because they are idealists themselves.

And that makes them say silly things like: 

&gt;There's something that makes me very critical to any sort of communism or other radical ideologies: history. This just don't end up well. Unfortunately, there's plenty of people who still argue, their version of it is good, leninism had some errors that won't be repeated this time etc.

Now that we're inside we can make a complete pig's breakfast of the whole thing: set the Germans against the French, the French against the Italians, the Italians against the Dutch.

The EU would be a parliamentary democracy. No strong executive. Since there is no EU populace there doesn't need to be a head of state. All power is derived from the member states that transfer it onto the EU.

Don't misrepresent what I wrote. In fact I purposefully didn't compare because the EU wouldn't have a president and therefore it bears no direct significance.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;Because they are British.

Obviously, it's the British parliament. Likewise all people in the European Parliament are European, and only a fraction of people in the British Parliament are Yorkish, or Welsh, or Kentish or whatever.

&gt;So? Sorry to break your delusion but there is no pan-European feeling in Britain.

I didn't know feelings were the only possible base of institutions.

&gt;Quite frankly the vast majority of us don't give a damn about the politics of other nations.

Neither do they give a damn about the politics of their neighbours. The fact of the matter is that we all are obliged to care because we deal with them at times, and how to deal with others is exactly what states are concerned with as an instution.

&gt;The British government exists solely for the interests of the British people

And?

&gt;why is it so hard for you to understand not everyone supports internationalism?

Why is it so hard for you to understand that the EU is essentially a pragmatic project rather than an ideological one?

&gt;I don't care Europe is filled with fellow Europeans, they are not British and therefore I do not want Britain to be ruled by them.

If you take that position then no state can exist ever, because a state by definition groups people of different regions together. It's irrational to pick out one arbitrary category as legitimate (British) and deny the same legitimizing status to other groups (inhabitant of Gropecunt Lane, Oxfordshire inhabitant, Welshman, European).

&gt;It can't. It's a fundamental part of our system of governance that Parliament cannot be bound by previous administrations.

So that means that the annexation of Wales isn't binding anymore to current people? The loans that were taken out by the previous administration don't count anymore? India is still a colony? Tax bills sent by the previous administration are not to be paid anymore? Please.

&gt;By your logic we should hold Mongolia responsible for Genghis Khan in a court of law.

There's no legal continuity between the Mongol Empire and Mongolia. They're both Mongol however, so according to *your* criterium - nation - they *would* be responsible.

&gt;There is nothing emotional about not wanting to be ruled by a foreign power the majority of our country want nothing to do with.

You're deliberately misrepresenting the issue. The EP is as foreign to Britain as the British Parliament is to Gloucestershire. You elect members of the EP, just like you elect members of the BP. On top of that you can veto decisions in certain areas in the Council, and are guaranteed a Commisioner. Arguable you're *better* represented as a citizen on the EU level.

On top of that, your reasoning is circular: ""we want nothing to do with it because we want nothing to do with it"".

&gt;You federalists will sacrifice the right of self-determination

No, for the third time: I repeat: In any case, it's up to Britain to decide how their representatives in the EU will act. If that involves a referendum (or a mock battle, or a pie-eating contest), go ahead.

&gt;to subjugate the people of Europe under a single government

Ignoring your tendentious choice of words, why would a single government be illegitimate in Europe and not in Britain?

&gt;which outside of federalist circles the people do not want

Circular reasoning: it's bad because they do not want it, they do not want it because it's bad.

&gt;The recent election of Euroskeptic parties to the European Parliament tells you all you need to know about what the people actually think about your grand plans for a federal Europe.

Yes, it tells me that Eurosceptics represent a small minority in Europe, populated by all varieties of neonazis and xenophobes, who are too obnoxious to even be able to cooperate amongst *themselves*, let alone with anyone else.

And it went on for a long, long time, just the thing is that when the ""right"" scores a hit, it is louder because it is a political hit. When the ""left"" scores a hit they often use background power like manipulation or money, so it does not have such a bang.

The Fidesz is not just one party. It is more like it contains in itself what a normal country is, and after these post-Commie fucks and Wall Street worshipping traitors can be kicked out from every echelon of power, can can split Fidesz into a social democrat, liberal and conservative party, but all normal responsible patriots not like the old ones, and then we can play normal democracy between these parts.

But the old ones must go by all means necessary. They are a plague.

To put it in French terms, you cannot play normal democracy when one side is the Resistance and the other is the Quislings.  Rather you kick out the Quislings, split the Resistance into 2-3 party and then play normal democracy. But the Quislings have to be simply repressed they do not deserve any influence.

AFTER these fucks are removed from every ounce of influence, AFTER we split the normal patriots (Fidesz) into left and right and center and liberals and whatnot, we can play normal democracy and yes not have government influence in the media, have completely free press and whatnot. Because then it will be made from normal people who deserve to be free because they can use it responsibly working for the future of the nation.",0,1402051138,null,0,1402051515,0,ci0l7u7,t3_27esi2,t1_ci0l7u7,t1_ci0kmhk,null,1434118376,-9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-9

true,itz4mna,UKGB,United Kingdom - England,"&gt;Why is it so hard for you to understand that the EU is essentially a pragmatic project rather than an ideological one?

Bullshit. It's entirely ideological, the whole reason it exists is to make the countries of Europe completely dependant on each-other so another European war is impossible. The ideology being security is worth more than sovereignty.

&gt;You're deliberately misrepresenting the issue. The EP is as foreign to Britain as the British Parliament is to Gloucestershire. You elect members of the EP, just like you elect members of the BP. On top of that you can veto decisions in certain areas in the Council, and are guaranteed a Commisioner. Arguable you're better represented as a citizen on the EU level.

Except that the people of Gloucestershire consent to rule by the British Parliament. The people of Britain did not consent to the monstrosity that the EU has become. Why are you trying to play pretend that nationality and patriotism don't exist? You want to push your internationalist agenda by trying to blur the very distinct lines between the subdivisions of a country. You are not even worth debating with if you don't know that if you're British a Frenchman is a foreigner.

&gt;it's bad because they do not want it, they do not want it because it's bad.

Apparently you don't understand democracy. If the people do not want it then it cannot be forced on them by a government with any moral compass, unless you are advocating a totalitarian government (ironically the very thing your beloved EU was built to avoid).

&gt;Ignoring your tendentious choice of words, why would a single government be illegitimate in Europe and not in Britain?

Because, for the fourth time our government is made up of British people who are elected by the British people, not by foreigners. There is no such thing as European as far as we are concerned. There is Britain and there are individual countries that are not Britain. A single European government would be illegitimate because *the people of Britain do not want to be ruled by a European government*. There should be no authority in Britain above the British Parliament, anything else is undemocratic. There is no European identity here.
 
&gt;Circular reasoning: it's bad because they do not want it, they do not want it because it's bad.

If the people do not want something it is the duty of the elected representatives to not do it, otherwise what are they there for? If the people do not want something in a democracy then it by definition is bad, that's how democracy works. Are you so blinded by the wet dream of a European superstate that you have forgotten that a government that goes against what the people want (in this case a smaller, less powerful EU) is the very thing democracy is supposed to prevent?

&gt;Yes, it tells me that Eurosceptics represent a small minority in Europe, populated by all varieties of neonazis and xenophobes, who are too obnoxious to even be able to cooperate amongst themselves, let alone with anyone else. And too lazy to show up for work 95% of the time.

I repeat, not wanting foreigners to be the sole authority over your country is not xenophobic. Am I a neo-Nazi because I find the likes of Juncker and other federalists making policy that my country is forced to write into law abhorrent? And they don't show up to work because their goal is *the destruction of the European Union*, not because they're lazy.

But what it means for Portugal? We built &gt; 6000 MW of wind power farms, and essentially need as many in continuous sources. This means we are building new fossil fuel plants; hydro and existing gas plants are not enough...

We can't even sell excess production: our neighbour Spain invested in exactly the same type of plants... When we have wind, so do they. :-(

E.g., Denmark can install as many wind farms as they want, because their neighbours, e.g. Germany, absorbs (buys) every MWh they can send. No such luck for us... A real European energy market would really help us.

Par ailleurs, cette fixation sur le cours de l'euro des politiciens français est bien évidemment idiote.

Ensuite, c'est un fusil a un coup : justement car l'effet d'une telle mesure est temporaire, on ne peut refaire le coup aux marchés tous les ans.

A ce sujet, il faut que cela se fasse par surprise pour que ce soit efficace. Ce qui est impossible, vu qu'il faudrait changer les mandats de la BCE.

Even though there's a 99% chance that the rest of the convo will have to be carried out in English no matter what, it can be seen as disrespectful not to begin with this formality.

Even when people claim to speak English and until proven otherwise, you should assume that locals aren't full-fledged bilinguals with 5 years experience with understanding NZ accents. As a consequence you want to speak slowly and clearly, with a reasonably simple vocabulary.

Don't insist on asking for directions someone who ostensibly looks busy (especially when in a large city). 

I don't know any thing about how people are expected to behave in NZ, but please don't take offense if most people turn out to be more stand offish than you expected. It's got nothing to do with you, although language barrier probably inhibits some people further, and everything to do with our culture. Generally we don't smile that much or act overtly friendly if we don't genuinely mean it. That being said the friendlier you are the better you'll be received, the more I smile at strangers the more they smile back at me.

As seems to be the case everywhere else in the world, politeness matters more in small towns than in big cities. ""Bonjour"" and ""au revoir"" when entering and leaving business are in order, as are adding ""monsieur"" or ""madame"" at the beginning or end of your sentence if you feel comfortable pronouncing these words.

Other than that I can't think of anything that could be drastically different in your culture, you don't strike me as the kind of person who'd walk in as if they owned the place, I'm sure you'll be more than fine.

&gt; How about advice when dining?

It won't be seen as offensive, but you may want to be using a knife and fork for pretty much everything except when dining in fast food joints or eating a sandwich. Even having pizza in a fancy place typically warrants using a knife and fork.

Keep special requests to a minimum when ordering and do not necessarily expect the same standards of customer service as you may be accustomed to, you'll only be pleasantly surprised then. You don't have to tip unless you want to and if service was above average.

You can drink wine but not just for dessert. Cheese is not dessert. The person that told you that must have made that mistake because in some restaurant you can choose cheese or dessert in the end of your meal.

Typical menu : Starter - Main dish - Cheese if you want with bread - Dessert (cakes, fruits etc)

Use the tableware the waiter gave you. 

**Being pleasant**

We Europeans are generally quieter in public. Try not to talk too loudly but even if you did, most people won't care as long as you seem nice. 

Say you make a joke about the French always surrendering in public. Most people will think ""Great, yet *another* asshole"" and then mostly avoid you.

Try to remember a few words. Bonjour, Bonsoir, Au revoir and Merci beaucoup. Most french people will really appreciate the effort and you probably be rewarded with big smiles :)

**Offensive behavior**

As /u/defcom5 said, you won't easily offend a French. I think it's cultural. Things tend to irritate us or anger us but rarely offend us in an american way. 

Don't expect everyone to speak english but don't say offensive things in english.

true,Affelar,DENK,Denmark,"You only need to go back to Libya or the recent French intervention in Northern Africa to see the effectiveness of European military might. The European countries might still spend a lot on their militaries, but they are chronically unable to project kind of sustained force without American assistance.

In Libya the European NATO countries ran out of munitions under a month into the campaign. And in Mali, the only way for France to airlift their troops into the country was on American transport planes.

On paper, the European militaries might still seem capable, but when it comes to taking actual actions there is very little they can do without American assistance. To change that, you don’t necessarily need to write bigger checks, but you do need a reallocation of military spending and properly also deeper integration of the militaries.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt; Bullshit. It's entirely ideological, the whole reason it exists is to make the countries of Europe completely dependant on each-other so another European war is impossible. The ideology being security is worth more than sovereignty.

I'd say that's a very pragmatic approach; much more so than placing the warm fuzzy feeling of national solipsism above real security concerns.

&gt;Except that the people of Gloucestershire consent to rule by the British Parliament. 

When did you last hold a referendum to that extent? In addition, if the UK elects to leave the EU, there's no one who will lift a finger to stop them, despite the your feverish nightmares. The EU has been consensual from the very beginning, and if your British representatives haven't done what is necessary to keep that consent, then it's their responsibility. The EU does not have any power to consult the inhabitants of Britain of its own volition, despite your feverish nightmares.

&gt;Why are you trying to play pretend that nationality and patriotism don't exist?

I don't. I just say that they needn't have the final word... and that an EU superstate with no regards for nationality is a fever dream.

&gt;You want to push your internationalist agenda by trying to blur the very distinct lines between the subdivisions of a country

Excuse me, it's *you* who pretends that the inhabitants of various British regions are somehow perfectly interchangeable, while other Europeans who live just as close are somehow fundamentally different.

&gt;Apparently you don't understand democracy. If the people do not want it 

Apparently you don't understand that arguing in favor of a point is perfectly democratic, nor do you understand that justifying your position by ""because it's my position"" makes it possible to justify *anything*.

&gt;If the people do not want it then it cannot be forced on them by a government with any moral compass, unless you are advocating a totalitarian government (ironically the very thing your beloved EU was built to avoid).

For the thirthy-eleventh time: only in your scaremongering propaganda is the EU going to force anything. If you haven't had a referendum, blame the ones responsible: the UK government.

&gt;Because, for the fourth time our government is made up of British people who are elected by the British people, not by foreigners.

And likewise the European governments will be made up of European people who are elected by European people, not by foreigners.

&gt;There is no such thing as European as far as we are concerned.

Prove to me that Europeans don't exist.

&gt;There is Britain and there are individual countries that are not Britain.

And there is the EU, and some of these countries are various tastes of decentralized themselves. These are all real, existing entities. Now you might not like them, but that doesn't stop them from existing.

&gt;A single European government would be illegitimate because the people of Britain do not want to be ruled by a European government.

If so it will not include Britain, because they will have started the exit procedure by then or have negotiated a lighter version of the proposed changes. How hard is that to grasp?

&gt;If the people do not want something it is the duty of the elected representatives to not do it, otherwise what are they there for? If the people do not want something in a democracy then it by definition is bad, that's how democracy works. Are you so blinded by the wet dream of a European superstate that you have forgotten that a government that goes against what the people want (in this case a smaller, less powerful EU) is the very thing democracy is supposed to prevent?

And yet again you fail to give a reason why it is bad. You just keep tantruming like a petulant child and expect to be taken seriously? Argue your case why being a constituent part of a larger political structure would be bad for the British inhabitants.

&gt;I repeat, not wanting foreigners to be the sole authority over your country is not xenophobic.

**YOU ELECTED EP MEMBERS JUST LIKE YOU ELECTED MEMBERS OF THE BP**
Foreigners are not the sole authority over your country. You have exactly the same rights as every other EU citizen.

No. They are neo-nazi because fascism is what those people often sympathize with, check their quotes and affiliations. I can't help it if their narrowly nationalistic policy matches yours so closely, whether you are a neonazi yourself or not. Find yourself better company.

&gt;And they don't show up to work because their goal is the destruction of the European Union, not because they're lazy. UKIP exists because democracy works.

Il y a 60% de Français en Wallonie ? Ah non. Ils sont Belges, depuis 1830. La Crimée est ukrainienne depuis quand déjà ? Ah merde, [seulement depuis fin 1992, après avoir dans un premier temps proclamé son indépendance](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crim%C3%A9e#La_Crim.C3.A9e_post-sovi.C3.A9tique).

La Wallonie est belge depuis la création de l'État belge en 1830, elle n'a pas été plus française que la Flandre.

D'autre part, si on se met dans la situation suivante (en supposant qu'il y a effectivement 60% de Français en Wallonie) :

0. Si pendant de nombreuses années, la Belgique a bafoué les droits de la ~~Flandre~~ Wallonie, allant [jusqu'à annuler unilatéralement sa constitution](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_de_la_Crim%C3%A9e)
1. Si la Belgique subit un coup d'État portant au pouvoir de manière illégale une oligarchie hostile à la France et aux Wallons.
2. Si ce pouvoir, composé en partie de néonazis, [appelle au meurtre](http://allainjules.com/2014/03/24/ukraine-ioulia-timochenko-il-est-temps-de-prendre-des-armes-et-de-tuer-ces-maudits-russes/) des Français
3. Si le nouveau ""gouvernement"" illégitime de Belgique, en contradiction une fois de plus avec les nations unies et sa propre constitution, annule unilatéralement son autonomie, le statut de sa population francophone et ses droits patrimoniaux
4. Si les Wallons prenant acte de leur séparation avec le pouvoir en place, choisissent plutôt leur rattachement à la France

Alors oui, ça me semblerait normal. Pourquoi pas toi ?

First time 52%, then second time 47% with gerrymandering... so they don't have the backing of around half of the country WHO VOTED. Obviously this, by your definition, would suggest that today 53% of the Hungarian population is unpatriotic and should have no power whatsoever.

&gt; Supermajority twice is no dictatorship.

It's not, however the kind of power centralisation they've been doing will lead them there. 

&gt; Fidesz does everything wrong, but if they just get one thing right and that is stripping the old elites of influence that is great. Then we strip them of influence as well if they get too bad.

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; in fact, Germany and France have been pretty clear on their stances. They don't really give a shit about Ukraine as long as Russian troops don't enter easter Ukraine

Because the USA is so involved in this. There's a strong argument that Russia didn't go further because of US threats. If the US decided to not get involved, that would change everything regarding whether France/Germany/UK cared more, or whether Russia decided to go further. Thankfully, we'll never know.

&gt; Second, European armies could take on Russia alone

A terrible idea for very obvious reasons. Your third point further contextualises why:

&gt; Third, when it come to cover operation, Germany france and England have everything they need.

Sure, if the other nations are willing to take whatever Germany, France and the UK want. If they don't care about defending Ukraine, then maybe goodbye Ukraine. If they don't want to risk it all defending a small nation next to Russia and with a sizeable Russian population then goodbye small nation. And for the record I agree, they should state they'll defend. But when push comes to shove are France/UK/Germany going to ramp up WWIII for the sake of this small nation? Again, thankfully, it seems we'll never know.

&gt; Now let's be serious, NATO account for 70% of the world military expenses. Those who ask us to spend more are crooks and thieves.

The overwhelming majority of that is concentrated in the United States. Take the US out and the majority is in the UK, France and Germany. A European defence would be whatever France, the UK and Germany want (and unless there's consensus, there's even more of a shortage, aka Libya). Remember France and the UK project across the world, not exclusively in Europe (South Atlantic, Indian Ocean, South Pacific, Africa and Southeast Asia) and ships etc. cannot appear overnight.

&gt; Those who ask us to spend more are crooks and thieves.

The way around this is to focus on which nations are not spending enough. NATO military spending is overwhelmingly disproportionate.

In diesem [Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/deutschland/comments/2164v1/hat_die_wissenschaft_gott_begraben_vortrag_von/cgah837) ging es um einen Buch-Vortrag von Lennox. Wir haben praktisch alle moeglichen Themen wie die Wissenschaftliche Methode und Ethyomolgie tangiert. Du hast dich ein wenig in Axiomatische Systeme verbissen, aber das ist okay.

Dann kam die Frage nach der Historizitaet des biblischen Jesus auf und Dinge wurden sehr seltsam. Du hast dich darauf beschraenkt, Vortraege (teils eher Predigten) zu posten, die mit null komma gar nichts an Evidenz aufwarten konnten, nur um im selben Atemzug die Theorien eines tatsaechlichen Schriftgelehrten ([Carrier](http://www.reddit.com/r/deutschland/comments/2164v1/hat_die_wissenschaft_gott_begraben_vortrag_von/cgah837)) mit dem [einzigen Satz](http://www.reddit.com/r/deutschland/comments/2164v1/hat_die_wissenschaft_gott_begraben_vortrag_von/cgajtgz) 
&gt; Carriers Meinung scheint wenig stichhaltig zu sein

abzutun. 

Trotzdem schoen, darueber geredet zu haben. Weiter entgegnete ich [deinem Argument](http://www.reddit.com/r/deutschland/comments/2164v1/hat_die_wissenschaft_gott_begraben_vortrag_von/cgagxzd)

&gt; Dir ist bewusst, dass Antworten auf ethische und moralische Fragen immer auf im naturwissenschaftlichen, mathematischen, logischen Sinn unbeweisbaren Glaubensüberzeugungen fußen. Das gilt übrigens auch für deine, dass die Sichtweise der katholischen Kirche zum Thema Verhütung Blödsinn ist.

[mit](http://www.reddit.com/r/deutschland/comments/2164v1/hat_die_wissenschaft_gott_begraben_vortrag_von/cgah0yz) 'The Moral Landscape', ein Werk von Sam Harris, in welchem er erklaert, auf welche Art Wissenschaft sehr wohl in der Lage ist, Moral zu evaluieren, uA. mit der Begruendung, dass Wertaussagen immer faktueller Natur sind. Du hast darauf nichts entgegnet, [dir](http://www.reddit.com/r/deutschland/comments/2164v1/hat_die_wissenschaft_gott_begraben_vortrag_von/cgaiy6n) schienen die skandaloesen Haltungen der katholischen Kirche zu Kondomen wichtiger zu sein. 

Ebenfalls okay, waere mir dann nicht das [hier](http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/260vka/religion_und_staat_ohne_glauben_ist_kein_staat_zu/chn2477) aufgefallen:

&gt; Auf alle Fälle ist es die beste Alternative zum Atheismus, der gar keine Möglichkeit bietet, Moral allgemeingültig zu rechtfertigen.

Das ist der Kernpunkt, der von Harris, erfolgreich, wie ich meine, bestritten wird. Und nicht nur von ihm - De facto weisst alles darauf hin, dass gesunde Moral eben nicht von Religion abgleitet ist. 

[Weiter](http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/261zyx/video_spiegel_%C3%BCber_montagsdemospinner/chn30dn): 

&gt; Wenn der Atheismus wahr ist, wieso sollten wir dann überhaupt einen Grund für irgendeine allgemeingültige Form von Moral und Werten wie Gerechtigkeit usw. haben?

Und [hier](http://www.reddit.com/r/deutschland/comments/1vuqts/petition_zum_bildungsplan_2015/chn3at6) hast du noch schoen eine Luege uber das Grundgesetz einfleissen lassen:

&gt; Der Staat und damit auch Bildung braucht ein Fundament für seine Werte. Auch die Macher unseres GG haben erkannt, dass nur durch ein christliches Fundament eine Verfassung wie wir sie haben möglich ist. Mit einer atheistischen Weltsicht kann man keine allgemeingültigen Werte begründen. Aus welchem Grund sind deine Moralvorstellungen besser?

Wir steinigen keine Homosexuellen oder vergewaltigte Frauen, die nicht laut genug geschrien haben, wir toeten Abtruennige nicht, wir loeschen keine Voelker aus, die nicht unseren Gott anbeten. Bis auf eine nominatio dei hat das Grundgesetz ueberhaupt keinen Bezug zur Religion. Aber das nur am Rande.

In diesem [Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/26rwic/moderner_glaube_warum_religion_gut_tut_panorama/) ging es ja auch um dein Fundi-Spam in /r/de. Du wolltest wissen, wieso man dich dort nicht gerne sieht, und sicherlich bekommst du eine [Antwort](http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/26rwic/moderner_glaube_warum_religion_gut_tut_panorama/chu6hc4):

&gt; Man sollte keinen Steinzeitfundamentalismus predigen, egal ob Religion oder Modelleisenbahnbau. Das kommt einfach nicht gut an.

[Du](http://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/26rwic/moderner_glaube_warum_religion_gut_tut_panorama/chu86qn), sehr erwachsen:

Grillo, who in theory should be a mere spokesperson for his party's internal democratic decisions, took the initiative to go and negotiate an alliance with Farage. This caused an internal shitstorm in the M5S, because many of its supporters lean somewhat left and really can't understand why they would get in bed with a right-wing conservative movement.

These same people have loudly proclaimed that the M5S is rather closer to the Greens than to UKIP, so Grillo has smartly taken them up on their word: he's extended an offer towards the Greens group, knowing full well they would refuse him, so he can go back to his people and tell them 'see? they don't want us, they are part of the system, we must band together with those who want to bring down this corrupt system'.",0,1402056831,null,0,false,0,ci0mc94,t3_27eq72,t1_ci0mc94,t1_ci0ke41,null,1434118904,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,MrKnot,EURO,European Union,"Guys, if you want to understand this move you need to look at it from Grillo's perspective. There is nothing dumb about this, it's actually pretty smart.

See, Grillo is theoretically supposed to be a mere spokesperson for the M5S and the party's internal democracy is supposed to be involved in all major decision. In reality, he completely controls the party's political direction and uses internal voting as a legitimizing tool to have his decisions approved after he's taken them.

This time, Grillo decided to go and seek an alliance with UKIP. On top of him once again acting as a political leader rather than a 'spokesperson', he angered that portion of his supporters which leans left, as they don't really see why they woud want to be in bed with a right-wing conservative movement.

Discussion around the issue quickly produced a consensus around the idea that the M5S should have instead sought an alliance with the Greens. And this is where Grillo's attempt comes in, and it's a pretty great move on his part. What he does is he goes and extends an offer to the Greens, knowing full well that they absolutely can't accept it after he aligned himself with Farage; so he gets refused, and now he can go back to his disgruntled supporters and tell them that the he did what he did because the Greens would never have accepted his offer, because they are part of the system etc. etc.

Of course, it would have been a very different situation if he had originally made the first offer to the Greens, but Grillo's supporters are not known for thinking deeply enough to understand this.

Why is it that messages that do not agree with that are just downvoted, as if they were toxic comments?

I don't understand. It's a pretty common hobby for people in western Europe to talk ill of journalists, of how the news are brought, of how information is selected.

- Both passed laws to limit the activities of undesirable elements in their society (Nuremburg Laws/ Gay Propaganda)

true,MartelFirst,IDF,Ile-de-France,"Don't just start speaking to strangers in English. That's very rude. However, to contradict what I just said, I think you can say ""do you speak English?"" first, in English. I don't think it's necessary for you to try to learn to say this sentence in French.

However, when in a café or something, you don't need to ask the waiter if he speaks English if you don't mean to have an actual conversation with him. Learn to say ""bonjour"" and ""merci"", because those are the only things you'll need to say to a waiter other than reading out what you want to order on the menu. If, however, you need to specify things, or ask a question about the menu, then naturally you will have to ask them if they speak English.

It's not that French waiters are trying to be cold, it's just that usually they don't have conversations with their clients, especially if they're going to struggle with the language barrier. It's just not really in French culture to be overtly friendly with strangers, even if it's a business to client situation. But this doesn't mean that you can't have friendly conversations with strangers - considering France is a Western country, you could surely detect the vibe in an encounter and determine for yourself if the situation is open for casual conversation given the other person's physical language.

When you are done eating your food in the restaurant, show it by placing your knife and fork on the plate, together and diagonally. This shows you're done, and also helps the waiter clear the table. I don't know if it's done elsewhere, but trust me, this is very common table manner in restaurants in France. I never finish my meal in a restaurant in France without placing my knife and fork on the plate.

You can eat some foods with your hands - those which are meant to be eaten with your hands, or those which are generally eaten with hands in the Western world. Like fries, hamburgers of course, bread, and perhaps pizza (unless it's in a fancy-looking pizza restaurant).

Ce référendum est-il exempt de tout reproche ? NON évidemment.

Les chiffres de participation sont-ils gonflés ? C’est probable.

**Le résultat est-il truqué ? Très probablement, NON.**

Il y a eu un oui massif. Tout simplement car il n'y a que très peu d'Ukrainiens en Crimée.

Que veut dire démocratique pour toi ?

Le *démos* a voté en Crimée. Tout le monde pouvait voter. Et tout le monde pouvait voter ce que le parlement de Crimée, démocratiquement élu, avait proposé.

This misses the point in so many ways. Almost all media companies distributing directly to the Russian market are under some direct control by the Kremlin. At the same time Russia banned Voice of America this year because it was polluting the airways. This is while cracking down on American NGOs. If Russia is banning any form of direct American communication into the Russian conversation than why the hell should we allow them to broadcast two state own radio programs and the multibillion dollar Kremlin controlled RT media empire? RT's is almost exclusively meant to demoralize Americans and promote Russia's foreign policy. When they aren't broadcasting news magazines about our crumbling civilization or 9/11 conspiracy theories they broadcast lies meant to justify Russia's foreign policy and mislead Americans. I know you hate America beyond anything else in the world, but try for a second to picture someone who is far less comfortable with a hostile foreign government trying to hijack the American conversation while it blocks any American influence. I'm sure there are some American shills on forums, but how can you not understand that I find Russia far more threatening as do most Americans?

Worst of all if the US stuck to it's ideals which you proclaim it does - in your post - then our eventual enemies like Russia and China would never have a moral equal ground. 

You're well aware that Fox News is allowed to lie on US TV due to a bizarre clause in your free speech? 

You're mad at RT because Russia finally realised that twisting versions of events is far better than outright lying. Fox news in the US, Daily Mail in the UK and the other murdoch papers in Canada and Australia which are the most read or watched by the population are just as bad with the shilling propaganda they put out. 

You talk about state owned media yet 90 percent of media in the US is published via 6 corporations. Whilst in the west our media is still fairer and more free it's worth noting the US comes in at number 46 in countries ranked for press freedom.

Whilst I agree Russia are shits - they've merely learnt the rules of the West and are now playing by them. 

I'm more sick of reading American propaganda than I am Russian. At least with the Russians it's usually fairly blatant and my countrymen aren't parroting it like the docile dumb arses they are.

Even when they Soviet Union was at the height of it's power it rarely ventured out the USSR and Eastern Europe. The only noticeable war it started was Afghanistan and Czecholsovakia

Compare that to the US (and NATO) and you're looking at US invading Panama, supporting the contra in Nicaragua, turned Mexico into a more dangerous country than Iraq or Afghanistan in the last 6 years due to the iInternational law on narcotics put out by the US, Vietnam, Guantanamo, Iraq Afghanistan, drone striking upwards of five countries off the top of my head (syria, yemen, pakistan, afghanistan, iraq), thebay of pigs invasion on cuba, overthrowing Irans democracy, Overthrowing Guatemala's democracy for nationalising land at the behest of United fruit and funding death squads across Guatemala, Overthrowing Chile's democracy and installing the fucking genocidal dictator Pinochet,  Funding Saddam Hussein and providing the chemical weapons he used to gas kurds in Iraq in the 80's, funding Osama Bin Laden and the Muhjadeen and providing glorified religious murder propaganda against the soviets in the 80's.

Sure they do not feel that way - MIC are big employeers. And it's a major barrier to making your military more appropriate.

&gt; Actually, air craft carrier groups are the best for of force projection, and are much more preferable to permanent bases. So I'm OK with that.

But do you need to ""force project"" against every country of the world at the same time? I guess not. OK, OK, I know that your war doctrine is to have forces 3 times bigger in any possible battle, but still - most of these countries are your allies (in fact all, excluding Russia nad China).

&gt; In the short term, sure we can go to the Eastern border of the threat. But long term, UK, Germany, France, Italy, etc. should step up and proctect their own continent and their own union.

Agreed.

&gt; But let me ask you, will the Poles let German tanks be stationed there? What other aspects of history are goingto make this difficult?

Right now: I guess not (ordinary citizens have no say about this anyway). In few years - yes. Yeah, there is extreme right and extreme left (mostly right), that will protest, as they always do, but they are minorities. In fact - if Luftwaffe sent some jets, as UK, France and US already did then it would be viewed in very positive light.

&gt; I just saw some big fight between a Pole and Lithuanian in another thread, over territory. These are EU members and NATO members. History is not over, even if you ignore it.

Link? There are no territory disputes between Lithuania and Poland. Maybe this was discussion about 1920s? You must know, that polish minority (or rather: loud minority of minority) in Lithuania is very nationalistic, but not in line with views in Poland. They are much closer to ordinary Belarusan with their anti-NATO, pro-Russia sympathies.

Anyway, to sum this up:

* US involvement in EU affairs on the eastern border: short term yes, long term no (but Poland still expects help in event of Russia invasion, that's the sole reason we go to fight US wars elsewhere).
* US military presence in counties of old EU: long term no, you are on your way out anyway.
* Will this result in cuts to social benefits in EU countries? No, because it doesn't affect it now. Spending in military has side effect of new jobs, new technology, etc. Overspending in military would be result in cuts (as we see in US), but Europe doesn't have oligarchy of few defence companies that can influence politics of EU (yet, and hopefully we won't have).",0,1402061830,null,0,false,0,ci0nszl,t3_27d7bo,t1_ci0nszl,t1_ci059q0,null,1434119595,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Also I would like to note that nobody in Turkey eats ""doner kebab"" like the ones in Europe. We rather have durum doner(doner wrapped with flatbread) or pilav ustu doner(doner with rice).  Doner means the meat that turns([pic](http://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosya:D%C3%B6ner_kebab_slicing.jpg), so that is why tourists might get disappointed in Turkey if you order ""doner kebab"" and get something different. I suggest a name change for ""doner kebab"" to avoid confusion. 

Also we have different varieties of kofte's which should be tried by everyone. There is Sultanahmet koftesi, Tekirdag koftesi, Inegol kofte, Kadinbudu kofte, akcaabat kofte... There are literally hundreds of different styles and each is different as well as delicious. Ekmek arasi kofte(basically meatball sandwich) can be also found in the streets of Turkey. Kokorec is also a popular drunk food in Turkey.

If you don't like kebabs, I suggest borek. Again there are many variations. Neighbouring countries will have similar meals. I suggest sigara boregi, su boregi(with either cheese,meat,pastirma...), puf boregi... 

Honestly we have many types of meals. You all need to check it out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_cuisine

Lastly you should drink Ayran with any kebab. That is the ultimate combination.

Rien à voir avec un circlejerk pro-Poutine. Simplement des précisons sur la volonté du peuple de Crimée.

&gt;Le référendum de Crimée n'est en aucun cas démocratique, peu importe que vous rêviez de Poutine en allant vous coucher ou non.

Quelle est ta définition de démocratique ?

Ce référendum est l'expression de la volonté du peuple.

&gt;De un parce qu'il n'est pas constitutionnel

C'est un référendum organisé en réaction au coup d'état contre Yanukovitch. Il n'y a plus de continuité constitutionnelle depuis ce coup d'état.

À ce sujet, je te conseille [cet article](http://russeurope.hypotheses.org/2116) de Sapir. Spécialiste des questions russes depuis 20 ans et très calé sur les questions constitutionnelles.

1. Il y a eu, à la suite de 21 février 2014, une interruption de l’ordre constitutionnel en Ukraine. Ceci est reconnu par les pays occidentaux qui qualifient le gouvernement de « révolutionnaire ».
2. À la suite de cela, les autorités de la République Autonome de Crimée ont considéré que cela créait une nouvelle situation, dans laquelle les droits de la Crimée n’étaient plus garantis, et ont décidé la tenue du référendum du 16 mars. Leur décision est donc une réaction à la rupture de l’ordre constitutionnel à Kiev. Elle n’est ni légale ni illégale dans la mesure où cet ordre constitutionnel n’existe plus. Qualifier le référendum d’illégal du point de vue de la loi ukrainienne est donc une profonde sottise et montre de la part des dirigeants qui utilisent cet argument une incompréhension totale des principes du Droit.

&gt;l'autorité qui l'a organisé (République de Crimée) n'est pas légitime, n'ayant pas été élue

C'est faux. Le Parlement de Crimée a été élu, et Vladimir Konstantinov, son président légitime depuis 2010 a bien acté que la Crimée n'était plus une région autonome ukrainienne.

&gt;de trois parce qu'il a été organisé dans un territoire occupé par des troupes étrangères 

Argument invalide : les élections en Afghanistan, en Irak, au Mali, en Côte d'Ivoire, et dans tant d'autres pays occupés par des troupes n'en sont pas moins démocratiques.

&gt;et où avaient lieu des violences proches de la guerre civile

Complètement faux. Voir à ce sujet [cette chronologie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2014_Crimean_crisis) de la crise de Crimée.

&gt;Même si on veut croire à la thèse selon laquelle la Crimée est culturellement une terre Russe comme pas d'autre, les résultats (tant la participation que les scores) montrent que l'élection a été truquée.

Ce qui ne remet pas en cause ni le résultat (oui au rattachement), ni le caractère démocratique du référendum.

&gt;l'apologie de Poutine

Il n'y a pas d'apologie de Poutine dans ce thread.

Le but était probablement de montrer la malhonnêteté de TF1 et plus globalement les manipulations médiatiques et la propagande anti-Poutine qui a lieu actuellement.

Par contre, il y a dans ce thread des énormités (comparaison avec une annexion de la Wallonie) et maints mensonges utilisés par les anti-Poutine.

We didn't do anything more than what we did, because we couldn't do much more. (By we, I mean the EU and the US)
Send troops ? Way to go to scale up the tensions. Also, it cost an awful lot of money. 

&gt;And this is the problem. It doesn't matter if the EU spends much more on military than Russia, everybody puts their interests first before thinking collectively. 

Wrong. We did think collectively. We decided to do sanctions. 
The EU need Russia's gas, and Russia need EU's gas money. We are too closely linked to do more sanctions. 

I'm pretty sure that here, you want to talk about the sell of the ship again. But we are not NATO's/USA's puppet. We agreed with Russia that we would sell them ship. NATO don't have a say in that. And remember that we agreed to that before the Crimean crisis, and that the EU is not federal yet... 

&gt; If Russia did something in Estonia, Lithuania or some other Baltic state I'm willing to bet France or UK won't do much to help (won't send troops) despite the fever on /r/europe about NATO's might (ignoring the US). 

Yeah, the UK and France are assholes ! What are we supposed to do in such circumstances ? Declare war on Russia ? Nope.
Also, if Russia tried to pull such a move on a NATO member, or a EU member, I'm pretty sure that it would make way more diplomatic fuss. 

Also, since Russia is using sneaky tactics, like the referendum, or the Pro Russia militia. I think it is a problem you have to solve on your own, like Ukraine's military is fighting the Pro russia militia.

Wenn das der Fall ist, was spricht dann gegen Veganismus?

&gt; Pauschale Allgemeinaussagen sind in der Ernährungsforschung nicht möglich, man muss immer den Einzelfall betrachten. Und da kann vegane Ernährung durchaus der Gesundheit schaden. Denn wer sich nicht akribisch mit tierfreier Ernährung beschäftigt und genau weiß, welche Nährstoffe in welchen Nahrungsmitteln enthalten sind, dem drohen diverse Defizite: Möglich ist beispielsweise ein Mangel an Eiweiß, Eisen, Kalzium, Jod, Zink, B-Vitaminen und essenziellen Fettsäuren - das wiederum kann zu Folgeerkrankungen führen. 

Totschlagargument. Wer sich allgemein nicht mit seiner Ernährung beschäftigt dem drohen Defizite oder Folgeeerkankungen. Das gilt auch für Leute die z.b. jeden Tag ein Kilo Pommes und ein Pfund Hack essen.

Mangel an B12 kommt auch bei Leuten vor die nicht vegan oder vegeratisch leben. 


Ansonsten sollte natürlich klar sein das die gesunde Ernährung des Kindes immer den Vorrang vor der eigenen Lebensweise haben sollte. Das muss nicht zwingend ein Argument gegen Veganismus sein.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; Portugal, Spain and Greece's issues were entirely unrelated to the Euro/EU. They were/are internal structural issues mainly linked with corruption.

These internal corruption issues in Portugal, Greece and Spain were among the main contributory factors to the eurozone crisis. There was nothing the UK could do about the internal corruption issues in Portugal, Greece and Spain.

&gt; The financial crisis on the other hand was created by investment banks, of which London has the biggest hub in Europe/the world. This happened in 2008. 

It is true that financial institutions in London contributed to the financial crisis. However, even if they had not done this, there would still have been a eurozone crisis. The debts accumulated by Portugal, Spain and Greece were always going to shut them out of the capital markets at some stage.

&gt; So yes, the UK is partly responsible for economic recession the world is currently observing.

Most of the world is not in economic recession - most of the world has been experiencing strong growth for a number of years. Growth has been terrible in Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain for a number of years and this is likely to continue. There is nothing that the UK can do about this unfortunately.

&gt; And the City has come out better than it was before so obviously there is a vested interest from the financial world in creating profitable situations like these, which are not what countries want.

The city did badly out of the financial crisis and also the eurozone crisis, with many people losing their jobs. The city is now booming again but this is despite the ongoing recessions in much of Europe. The UK and the city have no vested interest in this recession continuing or the eurozone crisis flaring up again. There is nothing that the UK can do to stop it though if it does happen.

&gt; This is what he was saying and it's correct. 

If you really think that the UK caused the problems with the euro and benefited from the problems with it, then don't you think it was a massive mistake to create such a vulnerable weak currency in the first place?

because this is a socialist country where the society pay the bill for the rich, banks should be let to fail and go bankrupt like on capitalist market

same should have happen to banks
 
&gt; millions of families have underwater mortgages

some investments go bad their own fault 

&gt; we have millions of long term jobless that only have worked in construction or picking oranges who aren't going to work in the rest of their life

they will and mane are working on the ""undeclared market""

if a market is unregulated there is no need to bribe officials in order to build since there are so many corruption cases do show that market is regulated and some builders use bribe to get their permits and papers 

&gt;We are going to end tearing down half of it sooner of later.

&gt;3 years of net emigration. We are expected to have a net emigration of 2 million of inhabitants the next ten years.
&gt;The birth rate is falling even more and we will have more deaths than births starting on 2017 according to the government
&gt;Higher taxes on property, expensive utilities. Lower pruchasing power of the population. Nobody is going to live in the new suburbs.
&gt;High unemployment that keeps the families together for sharing expenses
&gt;For the public administrations is also a waste to provide services and utilities to sparsely populated areas were almost nobody lives but that are full of houses, parks and stuff.

remove visa requirements for any immigrants, remove public health care by making no profit organisation outside political control, any social programs, lower the taxes, remove the vat, exit the EU, remove fractional reserve on banking, allow private money, use gold/silver/bitcoins/private money denominated accounts, fire 90% of public employees, remove any import export taxes and regulation, sell all public assets, sell streets, beaches, sea water areas, allow competing police departments, adopt Swiss militia system for defence, place private property above anything else... etc and is likely that the problem will be solved in 10 years

Worth also noting, as others have said, that you were in Bavaria, and actually there are completely different beers in other areas of Germany (though still not generally IPA, Stout or Porter).

One final note - I've been to America a lot in recent years, and had craft beer a lot, and often the flavour of your beer is quite different from the beers in Europe made in the same styles.

What I said was that nobody knew at the time (throughout the 90's and early 2000s) whether he had weapons or not, but he had refused some 12-14 times to allow neutral international observers to enter his country to ensure that he wasn't building atomic weapons. 

&gt; ""just"" occupation

What are you saying? Occupation =/= annexation in any way. I don't know how else to explain such an easy concept. The two are absolutely distinct. Iraq is not a US State now, but Crimea is now an Oblast of the Russian Federation. Nobody try to Americanize the Iraqi people, while Putin is beginning to Russify Crimea once more. The citizens of America are extremely critical of the invasion of Iraq. In Russia, Putin's popularity hit record highs once he conquered the peninsula.

&gt; The US, and NATO influence grows across Europe

NATO isn't going from province to province seizing territory. NATO grows by sovereign democracies joining a **defensive** alliance of their own accord. Russia's growth has been through military conquest. There's a massive difference. Sovereign countries can join alliances as they please. It doesn't matter that historically they were controlled by Tsarist and later Soviet Russia. They're sovereign now, and they can join alliances as they please. Russia has no right to dictate that.

&gt; Ukraine's situation is kind of a defensive move.

Absolutely not! Russia literally sent in troops and took a chunk of land from another sovereign state because they had already looted Ukraine's nuclear arsenal and the country was in political turmoil. How you can construe that as ""defensive"" is beyond me.

&gt; It is NOT an outright aggression towards western countries as a whole.

This is really your only point that could actually hold some merit. I still disagree, though. Ukraine began moving westward to finally start making progress at growing its economy and bettering the lives of its citizens instead of living as a satellite state of Russia. Seeing this, Putin attacked as soon as Ukraine was ""down"" in an attempt to sabotage the country and destabilize it. It was intended as a giant ""Fuck you!"" to the West to gain support domestically in Putin's own failed dictatorship, there's no doubt about it in my eyes.",0,1402070799,null,0,false,0,ci0rn8l,t3_27abta,t1_ci0rn8l,t1_ci0ncbi,null,1434121493,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt; Would Texas continue those socialist programs like medicare, medicaid, social security, and other programs?

Maybe reduce them, but not eliminate them. I have spent a decent amount of time in Texas, and even the most ardent conservatives I have met don't want to watch their fellow Texans starve. They would probably just make things like qualifying for unemployment a little more stringent (maybe something like mandatory drug tests or a shorter amount of weeks they can use)

&gt;If Texas cuts or reduces those programs on ideological grounds how much of the population would have to leave just because they would not be able to survive in Texas?

Texas has very low levels of unemployment and a heavily diversified economy, I doubt there would be many who couldn't survive in Texas.

&gt;If free from the feds how many hours would it take for Texas to further reduce their education standards leaving them unable to compete in the future?

Texas has mediocre k-12 schools, but they are very proud over their universities, some of them are among the best in the country. I don't know why redditors think Republicans don't like education. It's one of the most retarded memes I see on this site.

&gt;How many Texans are employed directly or indirectly because US military spending

Lots. But a lot more are employed in other sectors. Texas's economy would suffer if the military presence would be reduced of course, but I am sure they could rebound somewhat from this.

&gt;As for Texan agriculture it is a large sector but somewhat specialized. They have 8.4% of the population but 5% of the milk production. Fruit and vegetable production is more of a problem.

I agree, but Texans love their steaks, and that state raises a huge amount of cattle.

true,rewboss,advanced,advanced,"Well, I don't believe in a one-size-fits-all method that everybody would be able to use. Your method might work for some people, but not for others.

What you're basically doing is breaking the process of translation into two parts: first you apply the grammar, then the lexical translation. The difficulty with that approach is that it encourages people to think in English, then translate it into German, and that's actually what you ideally want to steer people away from because it's twice as much work as necessary. Ideally, you want people to get used to bypass their native language completely and actually think in German first.

Also, it would be very difficult to render all of German's grammar features -- especially case and gender -- in English. At best, you get a sense of the word order, but that's only a small part of the grammar.

For example, take this paragraph:

&gt; Wer viel reist, der kann was erleben. Er bekommt viel Interessantes zu sehen -- und viel Seltsames zu hören. Vor allem, wenn er mit dem Zug fährt. Lautsprecherdurchsagen der Bahn geben den Reisenden immer wieder Rätsel auf.

Now, a direct lexical translation into English (which is what you are proposing) would destroy most of the grammatical endings, so we would have to add a host of glosses, like this:

&gt; Who much travels, he can [+ 3rd person] something experience. He receives much interesting [adjective, + substantivated, + neuter, + accusative] to see -- and much strange [+ substantivated, + neuter, + accusative] to hear. Before everything [+ dative], when he with the [+ masculine, + dative] train travels·by·vehicular·means. Loudspeaker·through·that·which­·is·said [+ plural] the [+ feminine, + genitive] railway give [+ 3rd person, + plural] the [+ plural, + dative] travellers [+ dative] ever again riddles up.

So what you're suggesting is that people match the English original with that, then match that with the German translation. That's unlikely to make grammar any easier to teach or to learn, but if it helps you, then by all means do it that way.",0,1402073414,null,0,false,0,ci0swdf,t3_27gwem,t1_ci0swdf,t3_27gwem,null,1434122063,3,false,German,t5_2qq51,3

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"- I think French ""défiance"" is different from English ""defiance"". To translate French ""défiance"" into English I think you have to use ""disapproval"" or sometimes ""distrust"", depending on the context. To translate English ""defiance"" into French I think you can use either ""mépris"" or sometimes perhaps ""insolence"" or ""obtruction""?

- The English word ""contempt"" means dislike and scorn. The English word ""defiance"" means being obstructive and openly challenging a perceived authority. I think in this context Rocard was trying to describe this secont context.

- ""Disregard"" and ""contempt"" are really not synonymous in English, they are quite different. Disregard is to do with thinking that something has little importance or relevance. Contempt is disliking something strongly and being scornful of it. It is possible to be contempuous of both people and laws.

- I am certainly one of the people that Rocard is describing when he uses the word ""mépris"". I think defiance describes my own attitude to Europe rather than contempt! ",0,1402073450,null,0,false,0,ci0sx0u,t3_27e68h,t1_ci0sx0u,t1_ci0sbpg,null,1434122073,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

If I recall correctly (but I may be mistaken, I only have a very vague notion of the history of UK politics) he was against the decolonization movement and wanted to keep a strong commonwealth. Would have been in office, he would possibly have led UK into a war against India and tried to strengthen monetary ties with commonwealth states. Would we have a Canadian pound and Australian pound by now? In such a world, staying out of EU made a lot of sense.

If Churchill was the smart man we say he was, I suspect he would see EU as the broken institution that it is and ponder how to best use it for UK's interests.
