Although you are right on the centralization. The fact that everything is located in Bucharest provides an advantage.Moreover, the fact that authorities outside the capital must obtain approval from the Bucharest government for its policies and the fact that it depends on the central government for financial,legislative and executive aspects does hinder development of everyone else. 

As such, centralization is an obstacle to development, good governance and improved competitivity of the rest of the country,but not an essential aspect of the success of the capital.

La country manager italiana. Diciamo che il CEO di uber rappresenta lo stereotipo dello startupper maschilista, la società ha tuttora  dei grossi problemi di PR. Dai commenti sulle donne, alle sboronate su twitter su quanto lui scopasse (boober) grazie alla compagnia, alla debacle di questi giorni di Uber Francia (avevano lanciato un servizio con autiste  bone  puntando sugli abiti succinti, con tanto di foto delle tettone sul sito dell'app), fino a certi commenti abbastanza pesanti sullo stupro (questa settimana hanno difeso  fino allo stremo  e in maniera piuttosto aggressiva un loro autista reo di aver aggredito e molestato una cliente, la compagnia ha ritrattato solo  dopo aver  scoperto che l'autore del misfatto era recidivo, elemento che avrebbero dovuto  controllare nella fase di screening) e alle pratiche di recruiting. Quando si dice che c'è un problema di diversità  nel settore delle startup  o nel mondo del  VC in generale, è verissimo. 

&gt;Se lo stato non è in grado di mantenere regole aggiornate alle esigenze del mercato, le conseguenze sono queste. I tassisti sono solo un esempio, basti pensare alle farmacie. Davvero c'è bisogno di una laurea e di una licenza per fare sostanzialmente i commessi? But I digress...

Lo Stato mantiene le regole. Quelle che tu chiami esigenze di mercato andrebbero chiamate con il loro nome, ossia si tratta di operatori che queste regole vogliono violare per estrarne profitto. Non facciamo confusione. In primis ti faccio notare che l'attuale  struttura del mercato del trasporto non è qualcosa di immanente o naturale.  Lo stato di natura è l'anarchia, negli anni le varie esigenze si sono trasformate in una risposta da parte dell'operatore pubblico a quelle che erano richieste di tutela da parte di clienti e prestatori del servizio. Questa risposta sono le leggi, evidentemente se il mercato si è dotato di determinate regole è perchè molte di queste avevano effettivamente un'utilità, le regole inutili  sono invece frutto di interessi campanilistici (l'overhead insomma), non credere che Uber sia esente da queste pulsioni, non lo è affatto, anzi per certi versi è persino peggio dei tassisti tradizionali (ci vanno giù duro, guarda che hanno fatto con lyft o le consulenze che pagano).
Da questo punto di vista non è lo stato a dover rincorrere Uber, visto che uber non fa nulla di nuovo ma si limita a promuovere un ritorno ad  un passato privo di sovrastrutture, ritorno che si attua mediante la violazione della legge. 

&gt; Nel libero mercato (quello vero) tutti gli operatori mirano al monopolio, è per questo che l'intervento statale sancisce le regole della competizione (anti trust etc.).

Che Uber viola, dal poaching,  alle bugie,  alle campagne di smearing online, dal mettere i regolatori contro la concorrenza fino all'intasare di false richieste le compagnie concorrenti 

Dove pensi che venga estratto il surplus che uber distribuisce (nei casi in cui la prestazione abbia un prezzo inferiore dalla concorrenza?). Quello che tu vedi è un servizio a basso costo. Quello che lo stato vede è una esternalità negativa.
Perchè Uber cerca di non pagare l'assicurazione, perchè uber non si fa carico delle eventuali beghe legali degli autisti, perchè uber non rispetta le disposizioni in tema di lavoro (gli autisti di ubertaxi non sono dipendenti della società), perchè c'è un problema di origine tributaria (leggasi, quello che ti porta in giro fa nero), perchè uber ha protocolli di pricing non trasparenti, con il sistema di pricing via asta che è sostanzialmente illegale nella maggior parte dei paesi.
 


&gt; Questo è un esempio che non ci azzecca proprio nulla, perché non credo che la carne avariata sarebbe appealing per il mercato. Uber è sì ""illegale"", ma offre un servizio migliore a prezzi più bassi, incrementando l'utilità del consumatore a parità di prezzo. Perché assumi che la carne avariata avrebbe successo?

Era una citazione di The Jungle di Upton Sinclair (che oggi è ripreso nella questione della pink slime). Nello specifico, tu consumatore non puoi sapere che la carne che ti sto vendendo sia avariata o meno, un caso di credence good. Anche la carne avariata può essere commestibile se trattata, offrendo un servizio migliore a parità di prezzo, certo è illegale vendere la carne avariata, puoi beccarti la salmonella, così come puoi rischiare di fare un incidente sul taxi di uno che non è in regola.   Costa poco ma è illegale, anche  riempirsi di cocaina ed andare a taglieggiare i Giapponesi in San Pietro è fonte di grandissima utilità e divertimento, però è illegale.
Fortunatamente l'etica della legalità è ancora preminente rispetto all'utilitarismo spicciolo (dico spicciolo perchè se si fosse trattato di  utilitarismo pensato,  i costi impliciti sarebbero stati inclusi).

&gt;Puoi elaborare?

Si certo. Se si parla di libero mercato e di utilità, fa specie che venga presa a modello una società che allo stato attuale  delle cose  si regge in piedi grazie all'iniezione di liquidità  anche di fondi pensione e asset managers.
Del resto mirano ad una posizione di monopolio, e non nascondono di voler raggiungere lo scopo adottando qualsiasi tecnica (d'altronde il loro stesso business model è illegale in molto delle giurisdizioni in cui operano). Una volta che avranno raggiungo il loro scopo, smetteranno di limitarsi ad  estrarre valore dai propri autisti (che rischiano sanzioni in quanto operano nell'illegalità) o dalla semplice violazione di leggi che i propri competitor sono comodamente tenuti a rispettare, e passeranno a tosare me (consumatore), dopo che quella posizione dominante è  stata raggiunta grazie ai finanziamenti offerti da me (fondo pensione) o banca centrale (perchè la sharing economy si regge in piede oggi che c'è liquidità a costo quasi zero). E se questi sono allergici al codice della strada, figuriamoci alle regole a tutela della concorrenza.
Comunque tu la voglia mettere, non c'è nessuna meritocrazia da parte del mercato  o da parte dei consumatori. C'è un ente che ha il privilegio di essere supportato da operatori con le tasche larghe, e nonostante non sia il migliore può comunque permettersi di mandare fuori mercato la concorrenza (senza essere profittevole nella fase intermedia). Suona qualche campana? Dovrebbe, è esattamente la storia di Amazon.
Allo stato comunque deve interessare il benessere della collettività e l'integrità del mercato,  situazione che non necessariamente coincide con il tuo beneficio da singolo consumatore (se non altro, i singoli tassisti e le società piccole sono più facilmente tassabili degli uberdrivers e di Uber).  Quindi per cortesia smettiamola di fare confusione e di parlare di libero mercato, di libertà o di Ayn rand, perchè in questo caso sono solo specchi  per le allodole, non aggiungono nulla se non un po' di fumo negli occhi.

Secondo la tua logica prettamente utilitaristica, anche i boss della mafia sono imprenditori legittimi e di successo. Sono gli spacciatori i criminali, il boss mica si sporca le mani, sono i subalterni quelli che rischiano facendo il lavoro sporco.   Business model identico a quello di Uber,  e come Uber, occorre  essere gli unici a non rispettare la legge mentre gli altri sono obbligati, proprio per tenere sotto scacco la competizione, e chissenefrega dei poveracci in overdose.",0,1414116897,null,0,1414118936,0,cli5h38,t3_2k2wgf,t1_cli5h38,t1_cli28d3,null,1426378704,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

I am an outsider, so correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like the UK's bill is being retroactively raised because the EU has now decided that UK taxpayers should have to pay more due to the profits made by criminals within the UK's borders.

Sounds a bit outrageous to me, especially the retroactive application of a new rule.

Also, unlike progressive taxation of the wealthiest members of society, this cost will likely fall most heavily on the working class and the poor, because if this triggers more austerity in the UK or a cut to any government programs, they're the ones who seem to always get the short end of the stick.  I also wonder whether this recovery money will go the working poor and the needy in other European countries or to European bankers, politicians, and corporations.

1. The UK has made deep cuts and just barely started to see some recovery, which unfortunately has not translated in better pay for the Average Joe (yes, the unemployment rate has dropped but wages have not recovered to pre-recession levels; we have a somewhat similar situation over here).  This means that a host of public services have been canceled/scaled back AND that the government has to pay additional funds.  It won't sit well with many over the pond.

2. The recalculation factors in the ""hidden economy"" including prostitution and sales of illegal drugs.  These are not taxed as income.  Presumably, part of the revenue generated finds its way to the state coffers (VAT, for instance), but it's clear the government did not receive its full share.

3. The issue, from what I can see, is not about progressive taxation.  This  interpretation would assume a level-playing field where all EU members make similar efforts to jump start the economy and are ready to face public backlash when revisiting spending.  To give an example, France, which quite egregiously should receive a considerable rebate according to the new formula, has shamelessly dragged its feet on this topic.

false,Monkey_Paralysed,null,null,"&gt;David Garrahy will one day return to live in Ireland, he says, “but I’m not entirely sure when and at what stage of my life”. The 34-year old from Doolin, County Clare, who has a degree in law and European studies and a Masters in international relations, works in Brussels for the European Youth Forum.

&gt;Mr Garrahy is part of an exodus of young, highly educated people from Ireland. Persuading them to return is becoming an increasingly critical political issue as the nation contemplates the economic and social cost of the loss of its future workforce.

&gt;“We are going to see serious skills shortages,” says Marie-Claire McAleer, senior research and policy officer at the National Youth Council of Ireland, which recently sponsored a conference to look at how to encourage young people back.

&gt;“We’re losing our revenue base, and this is coupled with an ageing population,” Ms McAleer says, describing the outflow as “potentially catastrophic”.

&gt;Indeed, the issue is so close to the top of the political agenda that Ireland recently named its first minister of state for the diaspora, Jimmy Deenihan.

&gt;A look at the official numbers shows why this is such a pressing matter. Although net emigration has fallen to 21,400 in the year to April 2014, down from 33,100 the year before, more than 228,000 Irish nationals left the country between 2009 and 2013, the majority of them young and educated. More than 132,000 of them – nearly 60 per cent – had university degrees.

&gt;“Ireland had invested significantly in their education and we’re losing them to other countries,” says Ms McAleer.

&gt;The population aged 20-24 fell by 13.2 per cent between 2006 and 2011, an outflow not seen even in the depths of the recession of the 1970s, when Ireland’s overall economic base was far smaller than it is today.

&gt;The population aged 25-29 fell by 3.2 per cent in those years. And while some of the drop is due to recent immigrants – largely from countries that had recently joined the EU – returning home as jobs dried up, more than half of it was down to young Irish nationals leaving home.

&gt;A 2013 survey by researchers at University College Cork, found that 75 per cent of those questioned believed emigration is having a negative effect. The study also underlined that emigration is most likely among the well-educated. While 47 per cent of Irish people aged 25-34 have a university qualification, the figure for recent Irish emigrants is 62 per cent.

&gt;The exodus is generally held to be a consequence of the financial crisis, which led to soaring unemployment with younger workers most affected. Data from the OECD show that Ireland’s total unemployment rate rose from 4.4 per cent in 2005 to 14.7 per cent in 2012, although it had fallen to 11.1 per cent by last month

&gt;But among those aged 15-24, the percentage in work nearly halved since 2005, going from 47.8 per cent of that group to 27.9 per cent in 2012.

&gt;The effects of mass emigration are not limited to the economy; social reverberations are being felt, too. The University College Cork study found that at least one household in four in rural areas of Ireland has been affected by emigration of at least one person since 2006.

&gt;Moreover, the researchers noted, emigration is high when compared with Ireland’s unemployment rate. Greece and Spain, with higher unemployment, have not seen departures on the scale of Ireland’s.

&gt;Ms McAleer says that there is anecdotal evidence that, for example, a dearth of young people means that sports clubs in rural areas cannot find enough participants. Moreover, emigration often means the dissolution of intergenerational households, with attendant grief for parents.

&gt;“Not everyone has the means to fly over to see their children in Australia,” Ms McAleer notes.

&gt;In some professions – construction, nursing and teaching in particular – there are also concerns that highly trained workers will find careers and living conditions so much better abroad that they may never return, even if the economy picks up.

&gt;To this end, the government and employers are beginning to make efforts to encourage expatriates to come home. There are moves to create a database to keep track of emigrants and it has been suggested that notices of skilled job vacancies be posted to those living abroad.

&gt;But to listen to Mr Garrahy, who works as a policy and advocacy co-ordinator at the European Youth Forum in Brussels, Ireland faces an uphill struggle.

&gt;“Though I think there’s an instinctive desire in nearly all Irish people to ‘come home’, it would not make much sense right now in my career path to do that – the career opportunities are just not there,” Mr Garrahy says.

&gt;While conditions in Ireland would be better for him than when he left at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, this is not enough to draw him back.

&gt;“This balance is still missing in the jobs market, the housing market and the taxation system,” he says, adding that he has little confidence that the career path he is on in Brussels exists back home.

&gt;Ms McAleer acknowledges how difficult it will be to bring young people back. “This time around, there really is a sense that the young people have it easier when they emigrate.”",0,1414128904,null,0,false,0,cliagom,t3_2k67rm,t1_cliagom,t3_2k67rm,null,1426376250,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The Netherlands presumably have their legal services(prostitution, hash) calculated alongside their other services. Therefore equal treatment might demand that they be counted in the UK as well.

But the Netherlands taxes activities like prostitution and certain drug sales.  Those activities therefore help generate the revenue that the government uses to pay its EU dues.  They are helping to pay the government's EU dues. 

In the UK, those activities (drugs, prostitution) aren't taxed, so the working people and businesses who pay the taxes that fund the UK's EU dues have to pick up the tab for the criminals who pay no tax on their illegal transactions.  In other words, the total bill is calculated by including the economic activity of criminals, but the criminals don't contribute anything towards paying it.  In the Netherlands, they do contribute towards the bill, because their transactions are legal and taxed by the Netherlands.

&gt;I don't know much about the retroactively raised charge. I'd guess that this change in calculating economies, wasn't invented over night however. Some people in the UK government probably knew, that something like this would happen.

Cameron seems rather surprised by it.  It sets a disturbing precedent.  How can states plan their budgets if the EU can retroactively alter the way that it assesses its taxes?  If the EU ends up short on cash in the future, will it impose austerity on itself or make up and apply a new retroactive tax increase?

&gt;

&gt;A __world's fair__, __world fair__, __world exposition__ or __universal exposition__ (sometimes spelled *expo* for short) is a large public [exhibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition). These exhibitions vary in character and are held in varying parts of the world. The next World's fair will be [Expo 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_2015) in [Milan, Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan).

&gt;Since the entering into force of the 1928 *Convention Relating to International Exhibitions*, the [Bureau International des Expositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_International_Expositions) (BIE; English: International Exhibitions Bureau) has served as an international sanctioning body for world's fairs. BIE-approved fairs are of three types: *universal*, *international*, and *specialized*. They usually last from three weeks to six months.

Das Thema ""Freier Wille"", speziell die Libet-Experimente beschäftigten mich zu der Zeit sehr viel, ich hatte auch viel dazu gelesen.

Wir kamen ins Gespräch, und nach nicht allzulanger Zeit musste ich (widerstandslos) erkennen, dass meine Positionen sehr sehr wackelig und wenig durchdacht waren. R. Precht war sehr gut in das Thema eingearbeitet.

Have a look at the political realities: the country was occupied by the Soviet Union. More than 2% of the Latvian populace is deported in 1949 (http://www.mfa.gov.lv/en/policy/history/briefing-papers/briefing-paper4/), whereas multitudes of Russians are shipped in (army/factory work/etc).

The occupation ends with the collapse of the soviet union, but the Russians don't want to go back to Russia. They prefer it in Latvia.

Non-citizens were either born in an occupied country or were part of the occupation. The[ Geneva Convention](https://www.icrc.org/ihl/WebART/380-600056) states: ""The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.""

false,Rc72,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Firstly, the US ""states"" under the Articles of Confederation were never independent states except under legal fiction. 

I advice you study the early history of the US: the states' sovereignity under the Articles of Confederation was certainly not fictional, legally or otherwise. The states so jealously guarded it that the Continental Congress wasn't allowed to raise taxes [or even provide for its own safety](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Mutiny_of_1783).

&gt; They certainly were not long-standing states.

They stood long enough to ""kick some British butt"", as our American cousins would say. Also, those thirteen years ultimately gave rise to [one of the most interesting debates](http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24094) about federalism (among other subjects) in history.

Some EU states are not much more ""long-standing"" than those thirteen states at the time the US Constitution came into force, anyway.

&gt; The USA was actually created to fill the vacuum existing from the removal of the British Empire.

The USA were created, initially as a mere confederation, because, as the quote attributed to Ben Franklin memorably puts it: ""We must, indeed, all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.""

The British Empire left no ""vacuum"" behind it: thirteen well-organised colonies became thirteen well-organised states, which confederated themselves in face of a military threat. When the Spanish Empire collapsed in South and Central America a couple of decades later, the ""vacuum"" was not filled by a ""United States of Latin America"", despite the best efforts of Bolivar, but by a myriad of independent and eminently fissile states.

Anyway, you conveniently shove aside the issue of Texas and Hawai'i, two independent, sovereign and (especially in Hawai'i's case) long-standing states which subsequently joined the Union.

&gt; Secondly, the lander of the FRG were not ""re-established"". They were mostly entirely new states that did not previously exist. The government of the FRG was a direct successor government to that of Nazi Germany. It was not a new government layer created on top. 

I'm sorry, but the Länder were re-established. Some of their borders were re-drawn, but they claimed the same status as the pre-Nazi Länder. Much more to the point, the Länder were re-established **before** the creation of the FRG. The FRG was most certainly a new government layer created on top of the Länder, regardless of it being a successor entity to the German Reich. And again, you skirt the issue of the Saar, which was a long-standing partly sovereign state when it joined.

&gt; Thirdly, the UK also did not create a new state structure above that of England, Scotland and Ireland. It was the same government as that of England, with the same House of Commons, the same House of Lords and the same monarchy.

It wasn't the same Parliament, since it had to induct Scottish (and later, Irish) members. It wasn't the same monarchy either, since what was until then a [personal union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_union) became a permanent one. But anyway, if the legislative and executive branches of government were merged, the [judiciary branch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_law) was **not**, and remains separate to this day.

Appropriately enough, you seem to be applying the ""no true Scotsman"" fallacy here. But anyway, are you trying to argue that the Second German Empire was a ""superstate"" whereas the United Kingdom isn't because the latter is **more centralised** than the former was? That's an interesting argument, for sure...

&gt; Anyway, I'm guessing this debate has long ceased to be interesting to either of us.

Not at all. I'm **really** enjoying watching you trying to justify your loaded terms with outrageous fallacies and untruths.

&gt; So let's agree to disagree.

But don't worry about it - you'll make many other mistakes that you don't even realize, and Germans will just think it's cute.

I believe we currently EU trade is worth about £400bn..

But then there's also cuntish tax 'avoiding' companies which are *partly* enabled by EU free trade (irish double quadruple chocolate sandwich, or whatever), so maybe that amount of trade needed is actually higher. Also, don't rant about Jersey/Isle of man... I know we have our own tax havens.

false,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;Our entire system of capitalism involves an element of risk. Inherent in any stock exchange is the possibility that values can collapse quickly. I don't think it is possible to legislate against risk without legislating against capitalism.

There's a fundamental difference between risking a few million by investing in a shoe factory in times when the leather supply is unstable, or risking a few million by shifting money into some financial instrument. The first is investing in the real economy, the second is shuffling papers around. The financial sector should be focused on providing its services to the production of real goods and services, not to each other in an infinite recursive loop.

As an additional benefit this will reduce the risk of stock market collapses, because then stock value will be based on the supply and demand of real goods and services rather than fluctuations in the opinions of their colleague stock traders.

&gt;There are many places in the world which currently have investment banking as an activity that relates to risk (e.g. UK, US, Singapore, Hong Kong) which seem to have moved beyond the crisis. While those countries do have other problems, on crucial measures like jobs and growth they are doing better than the eurozone. I don't think that the eurozone can (or should) insulate itself from the global financial system.

That's just short term, and it stands to reason that the financial capitals will be the last ones to suffer: the whole point of the financial system is to shift profits towards the financial centers.

&gt;Here I think the opposite.

So do you think that it's impossible for a judge to judge fairly if he doesn't have ties to at least one of the parties in a case?

&gt;I think one of the reasons for the crisis was that there was not enough of an alignment between risk and reward. Banks knew that they could take risks for which they would get rewards and then be bailed out when all went wrong.

That's one more argument to reduce the size of the financial sector in relation to the real economy: they must be service providers to the real production, nothing more.

&gt; I also note that the whole direction of financial regulation in the last couple of years has actually tried to align risk and reward more closely - e.g. all the new regulations on risk retention or the new bail-in rules for investors.

I'm certainly not saying we have made *no* progress. We have to internalize the goal though, just making adjustments once will not be enough.

&gt;Whether or not boring banking is desirable or not, I think you are swimming against the tide. I saw that in Juncker's letter to Hill, Juncker has specifically mandated Hill with deepening the capital markets union in Europe. In my mind there was nothing in that letter which indicated that Juncker wants a radical rehaul of eurozone regulation in the way you describe.

That's hardly something that will change my POV. In any case this is just a way to increase liquidity to get banks to put money in the real economy, which is a good thing IMO.

And yes, they called themselves Lithuanian, in the same way people call themselves ""Masovian"" or ""Silesian"". Most of them wanted nothing to do with your petty nation state, using a foreign Baltic language, aggresive towards Poles and stealing the history of the Grand Duchy ignoring the fact that it was predominantly Old Ruthenian and Polish speaking country since 14-15th century.

What really happened in 1920 was that:

1. Poles were controlling Wilno and did so since the withdrawal of Germans at the end of 1918 save the Lit-Bel Soviet Republic episode.
2. Soviets took the city over in their July offensive of 1920.
3. Soviets have ""given"" the city they just conquered to Lithuania knowing it would damage relations between our countries.
4. In August Soviets were defeated by Warsaw and throughout the next month we managed to regain most of territory we held in 1919 - Wilno occupied by Lithuania being a notable exception.
5. To regain Wilno and Polish ethnic area around it occupied by Lithuania one month before, we have used the ruse with Żeligowski. Not our most honorable moment, I'll admit, but it wasn't something completely out of blue like your Lithuanian education could lead you to believe. We never wanted conflict and open confrontation with Lithuanians.

So yes, there were at least three occupations of Wilno/Vilna/Vilnius in 1920, all between June and October:

1. Bolshevik one (from Poland)
2. Lithuanian one (from Soviets)
3. Polish (Żeligowski's) one (from Lithuania)

What will happen is jobs that previously weren't needed at all will increasingly become the core of the economy. We are already seeing it with the ever increasing amount of money spent on film, games and music. This will expand in a more general sense. More people will eat out. More people will go to see films.

The absolute biggest barrier to this world emerging are the social expectations of the pre-information society. People see as unnecessary the things that will dominate the future economy.

eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32007D0436&amp;from=DE

In Article 2 it says: 

&gt;7.For the purposes of this Decision, GNI shall mean GNI for the year at market prices as provided by the Commission in application of the ESA 95 in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2223/96.

&gt; Should modifications to the ESA 95 result in significant changes in the GNI as provided by the Commission, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal of the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, shall decide whether these modifications shall apply for the purposes of this Decision.

ESA 95 is a regulation which defines how the GNI is calculated. This has been changed recently to include some illegal activities. The UK has agreed to this in the Council as they have a veto there.

With the new calculations the UK has to pay more and the UK agreed to apply this retroactively. 

Furthermore Article 4 of it is an entire article making special provisions just for the UK. And then there is this: 

&gt; If the ceiling of EU-10,5 billion is exceeded, the United Kingdom’s contribution shall be reduced accordingly.

So the UK can't pay more than 10.5 billion and the UK agreed to this.

And for all the Dutch complaining:

&gt; For the period 2007-2013 only, the Netherlands shall benefit from a gross reduction in its annual GNI contribution of EUR 605 million

I do understand the difference. The difference is whether the amount the UK has to pay is a relative amount compared to other EU economies or an abolute measure which relates purely to the size of the UK's economy. I've not read the Telegraph article, but the reporting in the FT indicates that it is a relative amount:

Trouver un boulot dans la ville où il habite, c'est déjà pas évident, et je veux pas être un poids pour lui (ou être contraint à faire de la sous-loc, ce qui est illégal). Chez mes parents, c'est paumé et c'est encore plus difficile de trouver du taff. Du coup, trouver un boulot, ça va requérir de ma part que je bouge quelque part, donc trouver un appartement, loyer, dépôt de garantie, coût de la vie, etc... Même avec un boulot alimentaire, ce que je vais faire, c'est me maintenir, or, je prévois une expatriation pour des raisons personnelles et sentimentales et donc j'aimerais à tout prix m'en sortir et rembourser mon prêt avant de quitter la France. Et malheureusement, c'est pas avec un salaire de 1700 brut que je vais sortir la tête de l'eau à moyen terme. Je souhaiterais vraiment trouver les fameux 30-35K€ auxquels je peux prétendre afin que je puisse redevenir confortable d'ici à quelques mois.

D'abord, le grand groupe ultra connu (Nike, etc.) arrête de produire du textile. À la place, il achète à des fournisseurs externes et se positionne comme un client. En tant que client, il n'est pas responsable des pratiques du fournisseur. Et comme tout client, le grand groupe veut toujours un prix le moins cher. Il ne fait rien d'autre qu'être un client normal, qui veut le mieux *pour lui* sans se préoccuper de comment cela sera rendu possible.

Bien sûr, le fournisseur est en concurrence avec d'autres fournisseurs moins chers. Et le grand groupe menace à tout instant de changer pour un fournisseur plus économique ailleurs. Le fournisseur a donc intérêt a embaucher des gens très pauvres, pas au fait de leurs droits, et à leur faire comprendre que s'ils mouftent, on les vire (et ils crèveront littéralement de faim). Bien sûr, au départ, le grand groupe ne cherche pas un fournisseur dans un pays riche avec des droits sociaux développés. Il va directement là où on trouve des pauvres dont on peut piétiner les droits facilement.

At that point deflation takes on a life of its own as more and more people withdraw and make mattresses out of their money. The government doesn't merely need to keep inflation up a bit. They now need to print enough money to cover all the money that has become bedding and then more to restore inflation to a more sane level.

The problem is once you break the back of deflation you suddenly get people turning their mattresses into money again. The flood of money the other direction causes higher inflation than was originally expected. This creates conditions in which people want to retract again. This brings about a cycle as government gets afraid to do the right thing. The right thing being to keep inflation up until the spectre of deflation is utterly ruined. By the time you've done this there are no savings or monetary wealth left in the nation. Anyone who kept their mattress now has only a mattress.

false,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; As has been pointed out Greece is also one of the countries that end up paying more to the EU and that's because their numbers are actually better than they were estimated, if the numbers were relative to everybody else in the EU that wouldn't have been the case, since Greece is in the shitter economically.

I don't think that is quite conclusive myself. 

The calculations could have a double-relativity in them. For example, the adjustment to the Greek contribution could be calculated by reference to both (i) how well the Greek economy has performed relative to expectations of how well it would perform and (ii) how well it has performed relative to the performance of other economies.

&gt; I'm going to be cynical and say that I doubt that was a mistake, blaming the EZ for Britain having to pay more is a much better narrative than saying ""Our economy is doing better than expected, as such the share of the money we have to send to the EU also went up.""

""Er ist der absolut Beste."" - Du sagst: Richtig!
  
""Es ist der absolut Wahnsinn."" - Sagst Du hier auch, daß das richtig ist? Kann ich mir nicht vorstellen.

Ich will also auf die Deklination von Adjektiven hinaus.

Wenn man ""beste"" zu ""Beste"" subsantiviert, dann ist ""Beste"" jetzt de facto ein Substantiv und sich darauf beziehende Adjektive sind entsprechend zu deklinieren.
  
Es müßte daher heißen:
  
""Er ist der absolut**e** Beste.""
  
Jetzt ist es aber so, daß man das so ja in der Regel nicht sagt; man sagt ""Er ist der absolut b/Beste.""
  
Wenn man nun auf die Großschreibung besteht, dann gibt es nur einen Ausweg, um grammatisch korrekt zu bleiben:
  
""Er ist der Absolutbeste."" - ähnlich zu ""der Schwerverletzte"". Allerdings sieht ""der Absolutbeste"" auch komisch aus und entspricht (anders als ""der Schwerverletzte"") nicht dem Gesprochenen, worauf auch die Betonung hindeutet:
  
- ""der Absolutbeste"" -beide Teile ungefähr gleich betont, ""beste"" vielleicht tendenziell stärker.
- ""der **Schwer**verletzte"" - Betonung auf ""Schwer""

Es bleibt also nur folgende, korrekte Schreibweise:
  
""Er ist der absolut **b**este."" - denn meiner Meinung nach handelt es sich hier um nichts anderes als eine Auslassung (Ellipse):
  
""Er ist der absolut beste *[Sänger, Busfahrer etc.]*.""

""The circumstances which led to an exclave of New York being located within New Jersey began in the colonial era, after the British takeover of New Netherlands in 1664.""

A colonial land grant outlined the territory of New Jersey as being ""westward of Long Island, and Manhitas Island and bounded on the east part by the main sea, and part by Hudson's river"".

""The federal government, which had bought the island in 1808, began expanding the island by landfill, to accommodate the immigration station opened in 1892. Landfilling continued in stages until 1934.""

""Nine-tenths of the current area is artificial island that did not exist at the time of the [original] interstate compact.""

""The dispute eventually reached the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled in New Jersey v. New York 523 U.S. 767 (**1998**), that New Jersey had jurisdiction over all portions of the island, all of them, created after the original compact was approved (effectively, more than 80% of the island's present land). This caused several immediate confusions: some buildings, for instance, fell into the territory of both states.""

You've essentially lost a lot of negotiating power and will be taking directions from them if you wish to continue trading with them.

Our export trade with other nations will face their regulation. Of course, that's not our ""domestic economy"" is it? 

&gt; You realize that import duties are taxes,right? Any tax won't make your food and clothing prices cheaper,but will make everything more expensive and a hell of a bureaucratic nightmare.

Indeed. And that's the situation we're in with the EU, where food and clothing imports from Africa and Asia respectively cost a lot more because of the tariffs the EU puts in them. Not to mention the price floors of the CAP to protect inefficient French and Italian farmers.

&gt; You've lost a lot of negotiating power. Access to a 500 million market + the free trade agreements the EU have signed and is looking to sign soon.

At the moment it is actually quite hard to find a flat here because the semster just started and there are about 5000 new students. The rent for a place live starts at around 250€ for a single room and about 20m². It also depends on which part of Göttingen you want to live (also on what you are getting your PhD in). The cost for heat, water and garbage are around 25€- 100€ depending on how large your appartment is. I'm paying 20€ for broadband at home and 30€ for mobile phone but there a many that are a lot cheaper. 

The closest airport to Göttingen is Hannover Airport (HAJ) it's about an hour with the DeutscheBahn. Göttingen itself has a pretty decent bussystem which you can use for free when you have your Student- ID- Card. You can also use this card to use almost any train in Lower Saxony (the Bundesland Göttingen is in).

It is no problem that you don't speak German because many people in Göttingen speak English (or try to) even some of the lectures are in English if i recall correctly. 

Göttingen is a pretty ""young"" city with almost 30k students so there is a really good nightlife with bars, pubs and discos.

Leider hat unsere Gesellschaft bei dem Thema noch viel Nachholbedarf. 

Was dein konkretes Problem betrifft: Bist du schon Beamter oder planst du eine Karriere im Staatsdienst? Wenn du schon Beamter bist, dann würde ich, so blöd das ist, die Lebenszeitverbeamtung abwarten, denn dann hast du weniger Grund zur Sorge. Was natürlich auch ginge ist alles selbst zu bezahlen, dann gibt es nichts, was man durch eine einfache Datenabfrage nachvollziehen könnte. Aber erstens ist das unheimlich teuer, und zweitens hast du dann trotzdem das Risiko, und damit auch psychischen Druck, daß alles rauskommen könnte.

Wenn du eine Karriere im Staatsdienst anstrebst, dann gilt, soweit ich weiß, daß nicht alle Therapien als Ablehnungsgrund gesehen werden. Das bietet die Möglichkeit mithilfe des Therapeuten das Problem kreativ zu umschreiben, um so das Problem zu umgehen. Aber auch wenn die Situation mehr als blöd ist, es sollte dich nicht davon abhalten dir Hilfe zu suchen, denn man kann, auch wenn das natürlich nicht optimal ist, auch glücklich sein ohne Beamtenstatus und mit einer Lebens- bzw. Berufunfähigkeitsversicherung, die schlechtere Konditionen bietet. 

Aber ohne Therapie wird man mit einer Depression nicht unbedingt glücklich... deshalb möchte ich dir folgendes nahelegen: Bitte keine Selbstmedikamentation, schon gar nicht ohne vorherige Diagnose. Möglich wäre es zwar, aber es kann ziemlich viel schief gehen. Wenn du Angst vor einer Aktennotiz des Hausarztes hast, sprich ihn entweder abstrakt darauf an, nachdem Motto: ""wie wäre es denn, wenn..."" oder geh zu einer Beratungsstelle, wie sie an Unis angeboten werden, und führe da mal ein unverbindliches Beratungsgespräch, damit du weißt woran du bist.

That said, German allows you to combine words to change their meaning, which is also a powerful way to vary and play with the language. Also, if you allow for obsolete words people don't really use these days, but tend to still understand, you vastly increase the vocabulary. German also often allows you to reformulate things by using different prepositions, which may make a sentence sound different to a native ear.

For example, I could make a sentence like 

""Nachdem ich gestern zuhause/zu Hause ankam, ging ich direkt wieder aus dem Haus.""

It should be noted that this does not sound very bad to a German because ""zu Hause"" has an additional meaning ""at home,"" which is enough to differentiate it from ""Haus."" If I were annoyed by the repetition, I could reformulate this in many ways. Just to give some examples

Ich kam gestern zuhause an und ging sofort wieder weg

Ich kam zuhause an und musste sofort wieder los

Ich kam nachhause, blieb aber nicht lange

Ich kam in meiner Wohnung an, ging aber sofort wieder aus dem Haus

Direkt nachdem ich ankam, ging ich auch schon wieder aus dem Haus

Nachdem ich gestern daheim ankam, ging ich direkt wieder aus dem Haus.

&gt; The kind of rationalisation a rich person would make to complain about his taxes. 

That doesn't really make sense, given that everybody above the poverty line pays far more in local income tax than in EU subsidies. Someone just looking to defend their bottom line would not be strongly defending the notion of their national tax in such a way.

Nobody is suggesting countries don't have cultural baggage, but it's hardly a big factor in how rich or poor they are today. Consider the UK, France, and Germany, all doing well (in global terms), despite having very different roles in WW2.

I concede that when you look at the ex-Soviet/Communist countries, then sure, they didn't get much choice in that particular matter and that is part of why their income is lower. I would argue they shouldn't have joined the EU yet, but I guess that's irrelevant.

* You could be EU citizen and insured by home country (go google European Insurance Health Card)
* You can either get a scholarship, get a part-time job or pay the costs of living from your savings. The rules differ in each case.
* You haven't told us for how long you want to have insurance

If you want to get the best reception and fastest speeds, I'm pushing you in the direction of Telekom. It's expensive but by far the best carrier.

Vodafone is kind of in between, it's not the cheapest option but it offers good coverage for a still reasonable price.

My experience with O2 is not the best, I'd avoid it if I were you. However, O2 can still be a good option where you live.

false,nepharan,native,native,"This is a continuing source of frustration for me as a native speaker. Always keep in mind that using ""Sie"" is seen as an attempt to create or keep distance. Conversely, using ""du"" reduces distance. When unsure, using the formal version is the safer option as it is considered rather rude to tell somebody ""mir wäre es lieber, wenn Sie mich siezen würden."" Here are some guidelines when to use which. Rules further up override rules further down.

You always use the informal if you talk to a child. Always, no exception. In school, most teachers start using Sie to address their pupils once most of the class is 18.

When you use somebody's first name, you use ""du"". When you use their last name, you use ""Sie.""

Family members, especially close ones, are always addressed informally. Of course, this stops at some degree, depending on the setting.

You generally use the formal if a person is of different status in the current context (unless a specific agreement is made ""Wollen wir uns duzen?""). You simply don't call your boss ""du"" unless he offers it to you. The same is true for customers, teachers, etc.

Similar allowance is made for older people even in more informal settings. They are supposedly venerable elders or some such. Old people are almost always addressed formally unless you know them well, or they are family. 

When you meet someone you don't know, you generally use Sie, but this is where it becomes complicated. If you are in a more informal setting, such as on the street, in a bar, in a lecture, when you want to appear friendly, or when a conversation is likely welcome given the setting, people below approximately 30 usually adress each other informally withouth prior explicit consent. The larger the age gap, the more likely it is that you start using Sie.

Even more complicated is that ""du"" has transitive qualities. Imagine that you go to a bar with a group of people. They all know each other and so they use the informal. If one of them is your friend, or somebody you call ""du"", you will also often use ""du"" if you know at least one person well enough to do so. If you had met one of these people on the street, you would normally use ""Sie"". This is true in general: if you meet a group of people, of which you know at least one, you generally address them informally if your friend does so ""Wo geht ihr hin? Was habt ihr heute noch vor?"" 


-------------

If this is all too much for you, don't worry. Unless your German is perfect otherwise, native speakers will generally not hold such things against you, but usually gently correct you. Sometimes they may start laughing (for example, if you address a two-year-old as Sie), but this shouldn't worry you, it happens if the situation gets a little bizarre.

The rules are actually not dissimilar to English, where you start calling people by their first name at some point, but in German this often happens at a much greater level of acquaintance than, for example, in the US.",0,1414153683,null,0,false,0,clifqbv,t3_2k6dz1,t1_clifqbv,t3_2k6dz1,null,1426373792,4,false,German,t5_2qq51,4

&gt; Ti posso assicurare che a via nazionale non gliene frega niente dei tuoi obiettivi reali

Non è questo che ho sostenuto. Condizione per il rilascio dell'autorizzazione e della successiva iscrizione all'Albo è la presentazione di un piano programmatico, dell'atto costitutivo e dello statuto oltre all'attestazione del rispetto dei requisiti di onorabilità da parte degli organi sociali.  Nel caso di Uber, dovrebbero costituire un patrimonio destinato (con le conseguenze del caso in merito al deposito sia della delibera costitutiva del patrimonio, che alla nomina dei revisori che alla comunicazione dell'atto costitutivo e dello stato). Il che di per se' esclude  che il controllo sia limitato alla mera questione tecnica, non è un controllo di merito ma formale di legalità (peraltro in deroga a quanto disposto nel caso dell'attività bancaria, l'autorità conserva un certo margine di discrezionalità). L'autorizzazione può essere revocata, ciò esclude dunque la natura dei requisiti sia limitata al solo momento di origine. 
C'è d'altronde il grandissimo problema che Uber non ha sede legale in Italia. E'  una BV (Besloten Vennotschap) una  holding  di diritto olandese con sede legale ad Amsterdam (ah le tasse, peccato che un istituto di pagamento italiano che operi in Italia dovrebbe pagarle  nel paese dove l'attività è esercitata). Quindi, allo stato attuale delle cose... già sai, ci arriviamo alla fine.


&gt; Basta che nella domanda dettagli esaurientemente le modalità con cui riceverai, conserverai e trasmetterai i soldi

Falso per quello detto sopra. Peraltro mi pare tu sia troppo riduttivo, l'art. 114  stila un elenco tassativo di attività strumentali e connesse, stabilendo che l'esercizio delle operazioni da parte di società imprese industriali o di istituti di pagamento ibridi può avvenire previa autorizzazione solo attraverso la predisposizione di un patrimonio separato,  atto  che avviene nelle società di capitali con una deliberazione da parte dell'assemblea (straordinaria) dei soci per un ammontare non superiore al 10% del patrimonio netto della società,  è questo limite effettivamente compatibile con le disposizioni  della Banca d'Italia in termine di patrimonializzazione?  La deliberazione deve essere iscritta per essere effettiva (il giudice può deciderne l'iscrizione anche prima della scadenza dei 60 giorni salvo prestazione di garanzia da parte della società ma alla Banca di Italia occorre che i fondi siano esistenti e certi). Dunque prima viene costituito il patrimonio a gestione separata e poi chiedi l'autorizzazione (o contestualmente a meno che non vi siano impugnazioni nel termine o nel caso il giudice proceda con l'iscrizione immediata).
Visto che nell'Albo ci sono perlopiù società finanziarie (gli istituti gestiti da società esercenti attività industriale sono pochi e quasi sempre società separate e che si occupano di ambiti attinenti),  torniamo alla questione di partenza.

Può uber diventare istituto di pagamento?
Risposta, allo stato attuale dei fatti no, per ora non dispongono della struttura adeguata (= non rispettano i requisiti), certo potrebbero dotarsene e costituire una controllata, ma per un'impresa  che intende abbattere  la concorrenza, tagliare l'overhead e lavorare sul margine  è un controsenso burocratizzarsi fino a questo punto,  soprattutto quando sono allergici alle regole, non trovi? Più sensato affidarsi a servizi esterni, come infatti.

---

&gt;The __Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment__,  abbreviated as __CEFR__ or __CEF__, is a guideline used to describe achievements of learners of foreign languages across [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) and, increasingly, in other countries (for example, [Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia) and the [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines)). It was put together by the [Council of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe) as the main part of the project ""Language Learning for European Citizenship"" between 1989 and 1996. Its main aim is to provide a method of learning, teaching and assessing which applies to all languages in Europe. In November 2001 a European Union Council Resolution recommended using the CEFR to set up systems of validation of language ability. The six reference levels (see below) are becoming widely accepted as the European standard for grading an individual's language proficiency.

Wir haben unter Merkel die tiefsten Eingriffe in die Marktwirtschaft gehabt, die es je gegeben hat. Gemessen an der Geldsumme und der Anzahl an Eingriffen haben wir die Sowjetkommunisten überrundet. Nichts in diesem Land ist mehr frei von staatlicher Regulierung und dies auch noch zugunsten der Wirtschaft, nicht etwas des Verbrauchers.

Um mal auf deine Beispiele einzugehen: 

Die Busse fahren erst nachdem ein aus den 30er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts bestehendes Monopol der Bahn zerschlagen wurde. Dank der FDP. Allerdings griff der Staat auch hier wieder tief ein, Busse dürfen keine Strecken unter 1h Fahrtzeit oder unter 50km anbieten. Von Teilliberalisierung kann hier bestenfalls gesprochen werden.

Wahl des Stromanbieters ist so eine Sache, wenn der Strompreis dank staatlichem Irrsinn wie EEG für den Verbraucher um 92% stieg, für die Unternehmen mit Zugang zu den Strombörsen aber um 4% fiel.

Das hat nichts mit Liberalisierung zu tun, sondern mit Planwirtschaft nach DDR Vorbild, die ausschließlich Geld aus dem Volk zieht und den Privaten in die Taschen stopft. 

Dazu kommt die Generalhaftung der Steuerzahler für die gesamte Eurozone und alle darin existierenden Banken, Staaten und Großkonzerne.

Was bleibt also? Unter Schröder und Merkel wurde das Land in eine Planwirtschaft geleitet, die ausschließlich dem Wohl der Wirtschaft dient. Der Staat zahlt Unternehmen mittlerweile Löhne(Aufstocker), legt einen Mindestlohn fest der direkt in die Altersarmut und damit in die staatliche Abhängigkeit nach dem Ausscheiden aus dem Arbeitsleben führt, sorgt über Hartz4 und andere Maßnahmen für ein Lohnniveau welches sich nicht nach den Regeln des Marktes bildet, sondern staatlich kontrolliert ist, ... Gott, das ist alles so zum kotzen, natürlich leben wir nicht in einem liberalisiertem Land. 

Wir leben in einem zunehmend unfreien Staat, in dem Wirtschaftsunternehmen dank staatlicher Eingriffe Gesetze und Regulierung einer Mehrheit der Bevölkerung aufzwingen, die gleichzeitig Zahlmeister für alle möglichen Eingriffe des Staates darstellt, seien es nun militärische Abenteuer oder die EU. Auch werden Märkte durch staatliche Eingriffe zunehmend monopolisiert, damit fällt auch die freie Preisbildung weg. Der ausufernde Niedriglohnsektor gestattet es vielen Deutschen zudem nicht mehr eine Wahl in den Konsumgütern zu treffen, sie sind schlicht auf die günstigste Ware angewiesen, was jeglichen Wettbewerb in Qualität und Innovation verhindert.

Die Zustände näheren sich also denen um die vorletzte Jahrhundertwende an, der Knall wird hoffentlich ebenso laut ausfallen.

Dazu empfehle ich diesen TED-Talk:

http://www.ted.com/talks/thomas_piketty_new_thoughts_on_capital_in_the_twenty_first_century

Wir brauchen dringend weniger Staat und mehr Wettbewerb. Der Bürger muss endlich in die Lage versetzt werden wieder Herr über sein eigenes Einkommen zu sein, die massiven Abgaben müssen gekürzt, sämtliche Subventionen an die Industrie sofort eingestellt werden.

The previous poster was disparaging as ""parasites"" people who risk their lives to come to countries where they believe that they'll be able to build a better future for themselves and their families. Apparently he believes that they should remain in ""their country"" so as to ""better"" it.

To which I answer that, if he feels that it is as easy to work to ""better their country"" as it is to ""better ours"", and if he's so disparaging of people who clearly think otherwise, he should give the example and move there instead of insulting people from the safety of his keyboard. As any ultimate badass like you would do.

I put it tersely but, I think, clear enough. Please reply to my suggestion if you disagree.

Why is it not a set amount a nation pays per year that is agreed every year (or every 5 years to cover the slow bureaucracy of Europe) and if you can't pay it then you negotiate it when emergencies happen, etc.

So what would happen if all Eurozone nations were in trouble? Is the UK suddenly asked to support the entire zone while money is distributed back to other nations to help reduce their debt? This mechanism literally rewards nations for not making the necessary changes to remain a competitive nation (see France).

If a national government paid for a service from a company and then half way through refused to pay and instead pulled their money back from the company or even if the company suddenly demanded twice the payment for the same product no one would ever do business with them because their is so much risk.

Indeed, it's the very fact that the UK is not dependent on coal that has peeved off some of our politicians. 

The main target being used is renewables as a percentage of total electricity generated, not CO2 emissions. That means that some countries have very high percentage of renewables but, to reduce the cost, also use a lot of coal.

This is a misconception that seems to be all over the place... 

Do you pay taxes? If you think about it, this is the exact same thing as your own taxes. During the year, you (or your employer) pays your taxes to the government as they pay your wage. At the end of the year (well, somewhere the following year, really) you then add together all you've earned, and check to see if the tax you've already payed covers it. If it doesn't, you pay the due bit. If you've payed too much during the year, you can demand that back from the government.

That's basically what's happening here. Only, it's a whole lot more complicated to calculate what a country ""earns"" than what a person earns. So they calculate it a bit further in the future, and over a larger period. This time, it was the period 1995 - 2007 (IIRC). And in this calculation, it turned out some countries payed too much (France, Germany, etc.), and some countries payed too little (UK, the Netherlands). 

Not that those countries payed too little or too much on purpose - they just didn't know how much they were going to have to pay at the time, because the numbers of their ""earnings"" weren't in yet. They are now.


&gt;Why is it not a set amount a nation pays per year that is agreed every year (or every 5 years to cover the slow bureaucracy of Europe) and if you can't pay it then you negotiate it when emergencies happen, etc.


The same reason the government doesn't tell everyone to pay £25.000 in taxes each year, but calculates it based on income. 

&gt; So what would happen if all Eurozone nations were in trouble? Is the UK suddenly asked to support the entire zone while money is distributed back to other nations to help reduce their debt? This mechanism literally rewards nations for not making the necessary changes to remain a competitive nation (see France).

No UK money is going to France's debts. Nor to Greece, Poland, or whatever. Debts are floated on the international market, and if help is needed it comes from the IMF or The World Bank - two institutions that have zilch to do with the EU.

Take the example of citizens again: your tax money isn't used to pay the house loan of your neighbour, nor does the government use the taxes of your neighbour to pay off your car loan. That's now how it works.

This is exactly what happens and it is ensured that you can pay it by making it dependent on the GNI.

The agreed amount from every member state is 1.24% of GNI. The GNI is calculated based on ESA 2010, which is an update from ESA 1995. This update has caused GNI's to change and the tax amount had to be adapted accordingly as defined here:

&gt;2.   The total annual amount of appropriations for commitments entered in the general budget of the European Union shall not exceed 1,31 % of the sum of all the Member States’ GNIs.

&gt;An orderly ratio between appropriations for commitments and appropriations for payments shall be maintained to guarantee their compatibility and to enable the ceiling pursuant to paragraph 1 to be respected in subsequent years.

&gt;3.Should modifications to the ESA 95 result in significant changes in the GNI that apply for the purposes of this Decision, the ceilings for payments and commitments as determined in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be recalculated by the Commission on the basis of the following formula:

Whether the UK government was informed a week ago or whether it was informed a day ago is neither here nor there. In either case it does not give the UK government time to find GBP1.7bn.

&gt; It is to be expected that the other governments have also been informed in time. 

Though it does make it a bit surpring that this only came to light now. If 28 governments were told this a week ago, it seems odd that this only came to light now. Personally I would have thought it would have been better had the European Commission simply published this, entirely transparently.

&gt; Once again, this is a ridiculous mechanism in place that needs to change.

&gt; Why isn't the money collected first and then it's agreed on what to do? The EU isnt collecting tax it's collecting a fee to provide a service, a fee which apparently isn't fixed and just guessed prior to actually providing anything.


The money is budgeted first and then the parliament votes about what they want to do with that money. That's how every government in the world functions (except dictatorships), including the EU. 

The UK works in exactly the same way, BTW. In fact, you could say that the English parliament was actually the place where this kind of thing really took root for the first time, historically!

The EU isn't asking this money because the EU is short of that money, BTW. The EU is in no financial difficulties, as far as I'm aware. They're asking this money because it's due. That's it.

Sobald Banken pleite gehen können, ändern die ihr Businessmodell. 

Sobald keine Subventionen mehr gezahlt werden, gehen diese ganzen Blutsauger pleite, die kein vernünftiges Geschäftsmodell haben.

Sobald jeder Kunde Zugang zu den Strombörsen hat und kein Staat mehr in den Preis eingreift, sinken diese sofort.

Sobald keiner mehr über Hartz4 zur Arbeit gezwungen wird, müssen Unternehmen wieder lukrative Löhne oder bessere Arbeitsplätze anbieten, denn sonst kommt keiner mehr arbeiten. Ebenso gehen alle die Pleite, deren Geschäftsmodell darauf aufbaut die Löhne vom Staat zahlen zu lassen. 

Wenn der Staat endlich den Nah- und Fernverkehr liberalisiert, fahren alle günstiger, siehe Uber.

Überall wo der Staat eingegriffen hat tat er dies zum Schutz von Partikularinteressen, praktisch als ausführendes Organ der Wirtschaft.

Die Wirtschaft selbst hat keine gesetzgebende Macht, die nutzen den Staat dafür. Wenn wir denn endlich da rausbekommen und uns wieder an die Grundsätze halten, dann wird in der Tat alles besser.

Ein Beispiel für so einen Grundsatz ist das Verursacherprinzip aus dem Umweltrecht. Wenn jeder einfach für den Schaden welchen er anrichtet aufkommen, bzw. diese Risiken absichern müsste, würde heute vieles anders laufen. Der Steuerzahler würde z.B. nicht 4-6 Milliarden Euro für die Bergung des radioaktiven Mülls aus der Asse zahlen. Dies würde komplett an dem Verursacher hängen bleiben.

Aber man hat sich ja gerade hier in Deutschland dazu entschieden, dem Staat sämtliche Verantwortung zu übertragen und zu hoffen der missbraucht diese nicht. Natürlich tut er das. Das liegt in der Natur der Sache. 

Was hier nämlich herrscht ist Wirtschaftssozialismus, nichts anderes. Während für das Individuum die Gesetze des Marktes inklusive Globalisierung gelten, dürfen Unternehmen tun und lassen was sie wollen, bekommen Gesetze sogar noch auf sie selbst zugeschnitten.

Diese staatlichen Eingriffe müssen alle weg. Im besten Fall macht der Staat keine Politik mehr, sondern kümmert sich nur noch um die Verwaltung der Allgemeingüter und die Durchsetzung des Rechts.

""I did not understand such a view held by Lithuanians, such a trauma at losing Vilnius. I am convinced that the source of today's Polish-Lithuanian conflicts lies in that history. While we react only to the symptoms, we give little thought to the underlying reasons,"" Gluza says.

""It seems that, if we seek a dialogue in the future, it is very important to look at the two decades between the wars through the eyes of Lithuanians,"" he adds. ""Lithuanians still recall how Poland broke an agreement made two days before the forces of General [Lucjan] Zeligowski entered Vilnius on 9 October 1920. The way they see it is that Poland first acknowledged that Vilnius Region belonged to Lithuania and then took it by force.""

Gluza concedes that Poland broke the 1920 Suwalki treaty.

""The contemporary Lithuanian state, deprived of its major city, declared the 9 October a day of mourning. The mourning only grew over the subsequent decades as did hatred towards Poland.""

""History is still a painful topic for both sides, something difficult to discuss. It is much easier to react to current issues - spelling of Polish names or street signs in Polish-dominated regions. But without turning back to the past it is impossible to understand the process and its consequences,"" Gluza says.

Should Poland make a formal apology to Lithuania over Zeligowski's occupation of Vilnius? Gluza thinks that such an apology would only be meaningful if Poles truly understood the Lithuanian position: ""Before uttering the word, Poles must study the history of the occupation of Vilnius, to listen to what Lithuanians say... For the words 'I apologize' to be meaningful, one must grasp the reason for the apology. On our side, the understanding is still lacking.""

""But I realize now that Lithuanians expect to hear Poland openly say that the occupation of Vilnius in 1920 was a mistake and it was Poland's fault that no Polish-Lithuanian dialogue was possible for the subsequent two decades,"" he adds.

Asked by Newsweek whether Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski should be the one extending the apology, Gluza replied: ""That would be best.""

""Especially since the president's family comes from Lithuania,"" he adds. ""If only for that reason, Bronislaw Komorowski could show more sensitivity about the issue than other Polish politicians. On the other hand, there's little doubt that many [in Poland] would see such a gesture as a betrayal.""

Gluza says that Poland is not yet ready to accept Lithuania's point of view on the events of 90 years ago.



""Decades go by and we continue to stand with our backs turned to one another. All this - because several generations refused to pay proper attention. In the end, we must join forces in order to overcome this obstacle. Events that might have been left to a few paragraphs in history books continue to incite discord between Poles and Lithuanians.

Add internet and electricity for together another ~60€ monthly. 
Most students travel around by bike (get an old one, many thieves!), but local trains and busses are included in your Semesterticket. So you can get around for free mostly. 
For shopping Göttingen is okay, but not great. You get most things you typically need at the Innenstadt. There's banks, a bigger electronics store (Saturn), clothing and so on. At night the Innenstadt becomes the place to hang out.  
Being a Universitätsstadt Göttingen has many bars and clubs. You will have no problem finding a place to go to and hang out in the evening. The prices are mostly reasonable (Beer starting at ~2€).

Edit: I also wonder if its a demographic trend as well. The UK (I believe) is infamous for its lack of political interest which is why I don't see much difference between men and women.

For Greece specifically it was the bookkeeping, they wouldn't have been able to borrow that much with correct bookkeeping, Euro or not.

&gt;Thats all true, but this isnt a ""discount"", its the devaluation of an economy to make it more competitive within the international community, any sales are better than no sales.

It's not because you call it ""devaluation of an economy to ..."" that it isn't a discount: you used to sell goods and services for 100, then you devalue and you sell them for 90: is that a discount or not?

&gt;Where is the evidence for this?

Take for example the situation in Argentina, or indeed southern Europe itself: devaluation is just a temporary measure.

&gt;But that in tern benefits the citizens which have money or assets saved in those very same financial institutions.

No, not at all. They're small fry, last in line for a share of the profits. Most people only have a pittance of savings in comparison to the big fish anyway.

&gt;Should the governments just let them fail, taking with them everyones savings saleries and pensions?

Of course not; they should be made to pay it back and be restructured to prevent another case like that.

L'architecture de cette époque, est notamment la naissance des grands ensembles, découle de la nécessité de maximiser et rentabiliser au maximum l'usage de la grue. (le fameux ""chemin de grue""). Encore aujourd'hui une grue coute chère, on rentabilise un maximum son temps sur le chantier. Et surtout on utilise pas de grue, ni de béton banché, pour faire une maison individuelle. Ca revient trop cher pour l'échelle d'une maison.  Les ouvriers qui font du béton banché (sans parlé du grutier) sont qualifiés et la location du matos n'est pas donné.   
  
Donc à part pour des villa de luxe, on reste sur du moellon (Donc sur des éléments qui se peuvent se déplacer par les mains de l'homme : parpaing, brique,...) car leur manutention ne demande aucune formation particulière et aucune machine à louée.   
Ce qui me fait penser que demain, pour une maison, on utilisera pas plus de maxi imprimante 3d que de grue. Il faut du personnel qualifié, de l'espace pour l'installer, sans parlé du cout de location de la machine...
  
  
On utilisera alors pour des chantier plus gros? Ben dans sa forme actuelle faudra une machine bien grosse avec plein de place autours... Ce qui n'est pas le cas dans les villes européennes. L'avantage de la grue c'est qu'elle couvre une grande surface avec peu d'emprise sur le sol. Donc on peut imaginer que l'imprimante à béton de demain serait une sorte de grue qui coule du béton à séchage ultra rapide sans banche. Bon. C'est pas non plus complétement fou. Puis le progrès technique vient surtout du matériaux utilisé.  
  

Pour ce qui est des réseaux... les ""imprimer"" sur place est un peu absurde. La plomberie et l'électricité sont des lots qui sont plutôt simples et  sont peu gourmand en main d'œuvre et matériel, notamment du fait que la plupart des éléments soient déplaçables par l'homme et rapide à mettre en œuvre.   
  
Pour conclure : Les petites entreprises de gros œuvre ne seront pas inquiète, c'est pas concurrentiel sur leur secteur d'activité. Les grosse boîte de gros œuvre s'équiperont si nécessaire, embaucherons des ouvriers qualifiés pour faire fonctionner, contrôler et entretenir la machine, puis il faudra toujours de l'ouvrier de base pour les fondations. Et les architectes ont bien des problèmes  qui menacent leur survie, mais c'est certainement pas l'imprimante 3d.

Lithuanians in Wilno were then too small a community to have its own representation. Throughout the 20 years of all of the disputes played out between Poles and Jews.

How is it logical to take issue with any raise? Taxes fluctuate based on income and by the same logic EU contributions do that too. To demand that your taxes should remain constant in nominal terms is crazy. 

&gt;  some take issues with any payments to the EU

Well, then this news story adds nothing to their plight. The payments existed since a long time ago. How does a small increase change anything? If you're pro-EU you want to pay the contribution to get the benefits, if you're against the EU you don't think the benefits are worth any contribution and wish to leave. Everyone here keeps saying ""this will add support for the UKIP"" but why? If the issue was ""any payment"" to begin with then these people were already with UKIP from before.

&gt; some people take issue where we're being taxed retroactively

That is a fair argument but it was agreed upon and I don't see why it's so important. It seems more like a technical side-issue to me. Would these people not complain if the title was ""EU makes Britain pay for recovery | demand for an extra £1.7billion because Britain has outperformed other European economies over this fiscal year""?

&gt; and some take issue that were being taxed on the basis of our ""shadow"" economy

Again, a fair argument but calculating GDP is a technical issue, I don't see why it matters. Would these people not complain if the old system included the ""shadow"" economy and the new system did not include it and the UK was asked to pay more because of some calculation?

I live in a part of the UK which has received a fair amount of EU funding (it's so poor that it qualifies for funding aimed at Eastern Europe)

Some of it has been given to some extremely useful projects, for example we got superfast broadband long before the rest of the UK decided to use public funding to do it (the EU contributed about 40% of the budget with the telco doing about 60%), and spending money on roads and railway improvement is never a bad idea. But there is plenty of questionable spending on projects with limited viability (for example, a mining heritage centre - which sounds okay, but will it create much economic activity for the local area once it has been built?) and there is likely to be just pure waste too.

Derrière les apparences et les conventions policées des sociétés d'aujourd'hui rôde le Mal, insidieux, qui n'a pas changé depuis les temps obscurs. Nous sommes vulnérables face à lui car il nous attaque depuis notre environnement familier.

 Nous ne sommes jamais en sécurité et encore moins si nous croyons pouvoir l'être.

Par exemple un de ses monstres les plus emblématiques, le clown de *Ça*, est insaisissable et peut attaquer n'importe où et n'importe quand dans la ville pourtant paisible de Derry. Les enfants sont seuls face à lui alors qu'ils sont entourés d'adultes qui ne voient rien. Le clown est l'incarnation d'un monstre sans âge qui se réveille à intervalles réguliers pour se nourrir des habitants. 

Dans *Shining*, une malédiction ancienne -déjà connue des Indiens- a contaminé l'hôtel Overlook depuis sa construction. Elle se saisit de Jack Torrance et l'utilise en s'infiltrant par les failles psychiques (sentiment de culpabilité là encore) et physiologiques (alcool, un problème connu personnellement par King). 

Dans *Simetierre*, c'est un père rongé par la culpabilité (il n'a pas pu empêcher son jeune fils de se faire écraser par un camion) qui fait de ce dernier un mort-vivant monstrueux, en se servant d'un cimetière ancien et maudit.

Dans *les Langoliers*, la pire menace que doivent affronter les passagers de l'avion perdu réside dans la folie meurtrière de Craig Toomy, un business man respectable qui aime déchirer des bandes de papier. Ils sont bloqués dans une dimension figée du Temps qui s'affadit jusqu'à la destruction. On imagine difficilement pire horreur.

Abstract:

&gt; The American Academy of Pediatrics recently released its new Technical Report and Policy Statement on male circumcision, concluding that current evidence indicates that the health benefits of newborn male circumcision outweigh the risks. The technical report is based on the scrutiny of a large number of complex scientific articles. Therefore, while striving for objectivity, the conclusions drawn by the 8 task force members reflect what these individual physicians perceived as trustworthy evidence. Seen from the outside, cultural bias reflecting the normality of nontherapeutic male circumcision in the United States seems obvious, and **the report’s conclusions are different from those reached by physicians in other parts of the Western world, including Europe, Canada, and Australia.** In this commentary, a different view is presented by non–US-based physicians and representatives of general medical associations and societies for pediatrics, pediatric surgery, and pediatric urology in Northern Europe. To these authors, only 1 of the arguments put forward by the American Academy of Pediatrics has some theoretical relevance in relation to infant male circumcision; namely, the possible protection against urinary tract infections in infant boys, which can easily be treated with antibiotics without tissue loss. The other claimed health benefits, including protection against HIV/AIDS, genital herpes, genital warts, and penile cancer, are questionable, weak, and likely to have little public health relevance in a Western context, and they do not represent compelling reasons for surgery before boys are old enough to decide for themselves.",0,1414164810,null,0,false,0,clikidy,t3_2k7323,t1_clikidy,t1_clikbj5,null,1426371491,50,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,50

Hello,
                
Me and my best friend are visiting Germany from England, for my birthday in April. We have both loved Borussia Dortmund for many years, and have always wanted to see a game at the Westfalenstadion. We will be in Dortmund on the day of the match against SC Paderborn 07 (April 18th) and have already booked flights and accommodation. The only place we have found tickets for the game are on third part websites, selling the tickets for 500% of their original cost. We would like to purchase some tickets before we arrive, as we really want to see the game. I was wondering whether we could arrange some tickets via email, as the game is not very high profile (compared to a game against Schalke/Munich). 
                
Please let me know if this is possible. We'd love to see the Kloppo, the team, and the Yellow wall up with our own eyes.
                
(Apologies if my German doesn't make perfect sense, I am having to use Google Translate.) **This part can obviously be ommitted should someone be able to actually translate it properly.**
                
Thank you

LOL what?


On 7 October 1920, the League negotiated the Suwałki Agreement establishing a cease-fire and a demarcation line between the two nations. 

[Light orange line denotes the line drawn by the Suwałki Agreement.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Border-Lithuania-Poland-1919-1939.svg) 

On 9 October 1920, Shortly after the agreement was signed, the clauses calling for territorial negotiation and an end to military actions were broken by Poland. Polish general Lucjan Żeligowski, acting under secret orders from Piłsudski, pretended to disobey stand-down orders from the Polish military command and marched on Vilnius. The city was taken on October 9. The Suwałki Agreement was to take effect at noon on October 10. Żeligowski established the Republic of Central Lithuania which, despite intense protests by Lithuania, was incorporated into the Second Polish Republic in 1923. General Lucjan Żeligowski, commanding a Polish military force in contravention of the Suwałki Agreement, took the city and established the Republic of Central Lithuania.


After a request for assistance from Lithuania, the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops.

Piłsudski In a 1923 speech acknowledging that he had directed Żeligowski's coup, Piłsudski stated: **""I tore up the Suwałki Treaty, and afterwards I issued a false communique by the General Staff."" Żeligowski and his mutineers captured Vilnius, established the Republic of Central Lithuania, and after a disputed election in 1922, incorporated the republic into Poland.**",0,1414165227,null,0,false,0,clikqbk,t3_2k6q2d,t1_clikqbk,t1_clijcae,null,1426371389,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

That's like saying that we shouldn't allow black people in our country because that excites the racists and can be exploited by racist parties. Anything can be exploited. If anything, pandering to the populists' demands gives them the legitimacy they crave. 

&gt; this will actually hurt people because it will demand extra austerity measures, so to say that said parties will actually have no point in crusading against the EU would be inaccurate as well.

It's just 1.7 billion pounds, let's not exaggerate. 

That's about the same as the fiscal adjustment Greece will have to make in the next two years and keep in mind that as far as Greece's required fiscal adjustment is concerned, the worst part is over.",0,1414165391,null,0,false,0,cliktfv,t3_2k4uas,t1_cliktfv,t1_clik3od,null,1426371348,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

1st September 1939 at 05:45 on the Polish-German border.
German soldiers, assisted by border police from Danzig, break open the gate at a Polish checkpoint. The German bid for domination of the European continent had begun.
The German soldiers obviously posed for the photograph: they break the barrier from the Polish side of the border as is indicated by the Polish national emblem.

""At 4.45 the German battleship ""Schleswig-Holstein"" started shelling of Westerplatte, Military Transit Depot in the Free City of Danzig, defended by the crew under the command of Major. Henry Sucharskiego and Cpt. Francis Dabrowski. 7 days heroically resisted she repeated attacks of German sea, land and air, becoming a symbol of Polish resistance. A photograph that can say that without a doubt symbolises aggression in the Second Republic. Wehrmacht crosses the boundaries Polish - breaking the barrier of entry and the destruction of the Polish state symbols by German soldiers, photo taken at the border crossing in Sopot, 1 September 1939. Two weeks later, the Second Republic is attacked from the east by the Soviet army. So begins the greatest of wars that claimed millions of lives.""

Doch, denn vor einem Substantiv kann es gar kein Steigerungspartikel sein, sondern nur ein Adjektiv. Steigerungspartikel können sich nicht auf ein Substantiv beziehen - und ""Beste"" ist nun mal ein Substantiv; was es vorher war spielt keine Rolle. Du schreibst ""Beste"" groß, also ist es jetzt ein Substantiv! Man kann ja nicht sagen, man substantiviert ein Wort, aber die Regeln, die sonst für Substantive gelten, klammern wir jetzt mal aus, oder so.
  
&gt;absolut verhält sich zu Beste wie verdammt zu geil
  
""geil"" ist im Gegensatz zu ""Beste"" kein Substantiv, von daher hinkt der Vergleich. Man kann auch sagen, daß in diesem Beispiel ""absolut"" und ""verdammt"" Adverbien (Adjektivadverbien) sind. Und Adverbien beziehen sich auf Verben, andere Adverbien und Adjektive. Und Adjektive eben auf Substantive.
  
Ausnahme: Adverbien können sich dann auf Substantive beziehen, wenn sie hinter ihnen stehen:
  
- ""Der Film **gestern**""
- ""Das Auto **dort**""
  
Selbst der Duden hält sich nicht an solch grundlegende Regeln und sagt z. B. ""gestern **M**orgen"" wäre richtig. Hier bezieht sich also ein Adverb auf ein Substantiv und steht dabei vor dem Substantiv. Das ist schlicht und einfach grammatisch falsch! Es kann nur ""gestern **m**orgen"" oder ""gestern **am M**orgen"" heißen.

Es läuft also alles auf die Frage hinaus:
  
Ist ""Beste"" ein Substantiv... ja oder nein?
  
Nur ein bißchen Substantiv oder zu 50% geht nicht.

Aren't you being extremely simplistic? Obviously no redditor has the solution to the Palestinian conflict. The question at hand is whether normalisation of Palestinian statehood (which includes both international recognition and withdrawal of Israel from the West Bank, but is not exhausted at those two), will eventually create conditions for peace. 

I happen to believe that yes. A peace settlement is easier to reach when you do not have one side of the conflict forced into locked militarised enclaves with an enemy army outside and domestic extremists inside (that's Cyprus in 1964-1974 btw).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suwa%C5%82ki_Agreement

''The most controversial issue – the future of the city of Vilnius – was not explicitly addressed. When the agreement was signed, Vilnius was garrisoned by Lithuanian troops and behind the Lithuanian lines.[25][26] Yet this changed almost immediately when the staged Żeligowski's Mutiny began on October 8. Soon after the mutiny, Léon Bourgeois, **President of the Council of the League of Nations, expressed strong disapproval, asserting that Żeligowski's actions were a violation of the engagements entered into with the Council of the League of Nations, and demanding the immediate Polish evacuation of the city.**
In Piłsudski's view, signing even such a limited agreement was not in Poland's best interests, and he disapproved of it.[21] **In a 1923 speech acknowledging that he had directed Żeligowski's coup, Piłsudski stated: ""I tore up the Suwałki Treaty, and afterwards I issued a false communique by the General Staff.""[2]** Żeligowski and his mutineers captured Vilnius, established the Republic of Central Lithuania, and after a disputed election in 1922, incorporated the republic into Poland.[28] The conflict over the city dragged on until World War II. In the 21st century, the Vilnius Region (Wileńszczyzna) is the major center of the Polish minority in Lithuania.[29]''


Sure not a occupation buddy.Definetly not /s It doesn't matter what the ethnic make up was at the time, what matters is that Vilnius was part of Lithuania, and you broke agreement to wich your goverment agreed to.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suwa%C5%82ki_Agreement

The most controversial issue – the future of the city of Vilnius – was not explicitly addressed. When the agreement was signed, Vilnius was garrisoned by Lithuanian troops and behind the Lithuanian lines.[25][26] Yet this changed almost immediately when the staged Żeligowski's Mutiny began on October 8. Soon after the mutiny, Léon Bourgeois, President of the Council of the League of Nations, expressed strong disapproval, asserting that Żeligowski's actions were a violation of the engagements entered into with the Council of the League of Nations, and demanding the immediate Polish evacuation of the city.[27]

''In Piłsudski's view, signing even such a limited agreement was not in Poland's best interests, and he disapproved of it.[21] In a 1923 speech acknowledging that he had directed Żeligowski's coup, Piłsudski stated: ""I tore up the Suwałki Treaty, and afterwards I issued a false communique by the General Staff.""[2] Żeligowski and his mutineers captured Vilnius, established the Republic of Central Lithuania, and after a disputed election in 1922, incorporated the republic into Poland.[28] The conflict over the city dragged on until World War II. In the 21st century, the Vilnius Region (Wileńszczyzna) is the major center of the Polish minority in Lithuania.[29]''

What?During World War I, Vilnius and the rest of Lithuania was occupied by the German Army from 1915 until 1918. The Act of Independence of Lithuania, declaring Lithuanian independence from any affiliation to any other nation, was issued in the city on 16 February 1918. After the withdrawal of German forces, the city was briefly controlled by Polish self-defence units which were driven out by advancing Soviet forces. Vilnius changed hands again during the Polish-Soviet War and the Lithuanian Wars of Independence: it was taken by the Polish Army, only to fall to the Soviet forces again. Shortly after its defeat in the battle of Warsaw, the retreating Red Army, in order to delay the Polish advance, ceded the city to Lithuania after signing the Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty on 12 July 1920.[12]

Before that, it was part of Russian empire, and not Poland, before that it was part of commonwhealth, and before that it was part of LDK.

Also : ''In most cases historians tend to summarise the issue by saying that the agreement assigned Vilnius to Lithuania and Polish attack violated it''

The name of the city originated from the Vilnia River.[2] The name of the river derives from the Lithuanian language word vilnis (""a surge"") or vilnyti (""to surge""). The city has also been known by many derivate spellings in various languages throughout its history

Cameron's mistake is that he is way too aggressive in his approach to this news. He was furious and baffled by it. And the latter is a little bit silly. Rutte, the Dutch PM, said he was aware that this extra payment was possible, but that he was a somewhat surprised about the amount. He calmy stated that he would try to fight this outcome. The difference with Cameron is that Rutte is fully aware that it is likely that he will not get a discount.

Let's get this clear: *They all agreed to these new calculations and the possibility of an extra payment.* They all knew this was about to happen.

I don't believe Cameron can negotiate a discount because aside from the UK: The Netherlands, and to a lesser extent Italy and Greece, also have to pay. If the UK gets special treatment, the others will also want special treatment. If they all get special treatment on this, Italy will want special treatment on their budget. France will want special treatment on the 3% norm. 

Basically, special treatment will put a bomb on the current economic restictions, making the EU once again vulnerable. Thatcher might have pulled this off in the eighties, but Cameron lacks the charisma, negotiating skills and political climate. In the eighties, Thatcher was the conservative hardliner. Currently, Cameron is fighting the conservative hardliner. He is afraid, she was feared.

By the way, this saddens me enormously. I find it terrible that the UK doesn't consider it's role in EU vital for it's succes. There is constant talk about France and Germany both deciding for all of the EU.

I.E. we wouldn't take what X country is doing or what Y culture dictates we should do. We'd only look at the medical evidence available.

2 months later, I regret this. I wish I had looked into more information on the subject. We took at ""well, I'm cut and the current medical advice is supporting it"". Though, in fairness, I'm cut and I don't feel I was mutilated. Our son healed up in 5 days and even during the procedure and subsequent healing process he wasn't in any pain.

&gt;the city was briefly controlled by Polish self-defence units which were driven out by advancing Soviet forces.

&gt;Vilnius changed hands again during the Polish-Soviet War and the Lithuanian Wars of Independence: it was taken by the Polish Army, only to fall to the Soviet forces again.

&gt;Shortly after its defeat in the battle of Warsaw, the retreating Red Army, in order to delay the Polish advance, ceded the city to Lithuania after signing the Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty on 12 July 1920.

12 July 1920. That's the very first time Lithuanians have ever controlled the city - and very few inhabitiants of it wanted them to at the time. Bolshevik ruse was to give the city to Lithuania to avoid Poland reconquering it, Polish ruse was prepared by gen. Żeligowski. In the end we were all fucked 20 years later.

&gt;Before that, it was part of Russian empire, and not Poland, before that it was part of commonwhealth, and before that it was part of LDK.

Exactly. So what would be the reason for it to belong to Lithuania? It was already mentioned countless times that the ethnic composition was Polish-Jewish. Should Aachen be a part of France only because it used to be Charlemagne's capital?

&gt;The name of the city originated from the Vilnia River.[2] The name of the river derives from the Lithuanian language word vilnis (""a surge"") or vilnyti (""to surge""). The city has also been known by many derivate spellings in various languages throughout its history

Yes, that's what we're always told; and it's impossible to verify. It may even be a myth.

What counts as a word? Is ""bolt"" one word? Consider this:

* a bolt for the door
* a bolt of lightning
* she wanted to bolt the door
* the horse tried to bolt

Does this mean that ""bolt"" is two words (a noun and a verb) or four?

In German, you have, theoretically at least, an infinite number of compound words. How are they counted? The title of that meat labelling regulation that was repealed a little while back: is that a word? If not, why not? If so, what's to stop anyone inventing as many new words as they please?

There's a few places you should avoid, mainly the ""Groner 9"", which is an apartment complex at Groner Landstraße 9 and Hagenweg 20 (and anything in the close vicinity). These are areas I would avoid living in (and being alone in at night). The rest should range between just a bit shady (some parts of Grone) to really nice (the city center, Weende, Geismar etc)

If you have any questions about a particular address, feel free to send me a PM and I'll try go give you some info on the area. Finding an apartment is not going to be easy, probably. The students association actually had to set up a camp for freshmen since some weren't able to find a place. Again, depends on how much money you have. 250-300€ is probably the minimum for an apartment (with flatmates) + utilities. Unless you get a place from the ""Studentenwerk"", there you can live for 200-250€ including heat, electricity and internet. You can find out how to contact them here: http://www.studentenwerk-goettingen.de/74.html?&amp;L=1 But getting a place there *might* be difficult/impossible short term.

http://www.wg-gesucht.de/ is probably the biggest website for finding rooms.

The ""Asta"" (students committee) offers free classes in German (though I'm sure there are other options as well), the website asks you to call them, which isn't the most convenient option, but I'm sure if you send them an email they'll help you out: https://asta.uni-goettingen.de/?page_id=480

More general university contact stuff:
InfoLine: +49 551 39-113
infoline-studium@uni-goettingen.de

They should be a decent starting point for any questions regarding university stuff and with a bit of luck they can help you out with other things as well.

As for the social stuff.. the English department has a ""Stammtisch"", basically a regular meetup for people who speak English, both learner and people from English speaking countries. Info: http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/stammtisch/202515.html

In general, most young people here should at least speak some English so if you're lost somehow, just approach them. There used to be a pub for expats here but sadly it closed a couple of years ago and I don't know if any other pub has ""taken over"" that kinda thing. My favorite pub is the 'Trou' (Burgstraße 20) which is in an old cellar, has pretty good beer at fair prices and down there you don't get any signal, so people aren't looking at their smartphone all the time.

You'll also probably want to get a bike, but.. i find getting a cheap, reliable bike to be a difficult thing, especially if you don't know anything about them. I wouldn't trust the ""Uni-Bike Center"" as I've heard bad things about them, but that's not really much to go on. On the other hand, your student ID also works as a bus pass, so if you're okay with that, you don't need a bike. But it's still nice to have one, especially if you don't live in the city center, you're just more flexible that way, especially in the summer.

That's all I can think of right now, feel free to send me a message if you have any questions.

&gt; Non direttamente, la mia specializzazione è nel diritto bancario/dei mercati finanziari-fondi e delle procedure concorsuali/M&amp;A societario. 

Mi piacciono le risposte da ~~consulenti~~ avvocati bancari che iniziano così. Certo che con la compliance ci fate un sacco di dindini, eh! :-) :-P

&gt; Non è questo che ho sostenuto. Condizione per il rilascio dell'autorizzazione e della successiva iscrizione all'Albo è la presentazione di un piano programmatico, dell'atto costitutivo e dello statuto oltre all'attestazione del rispetto dei requisiti di onorabilità da parte degli organi sociali. 

Been there, done that, license received.  :-)

&gt; Nel caso di Uber, dovrebbero costituire un patrimonio destinato (con le conseguenze del caso in merito al deposito sia della delibera costitutiva del patrimonio, che alla nomina dei revisori che alla comunicazione dell'atto costitutivo e dello stato). Il che di per se' esclude che il controllo sia limitato alla mera questione tecnica, non è un controllo di merito ma formale di legalità (peraltro in deroga a quanto disposto nel caso dell'attività bancaria, l'autorità conserva un certo margine di discrezionalità). 

Quindi chiunque, presentando l'""estratto conto"", le carte giuste e indicando i nomi giusti, può ottenere un patentino parabancario.

&gt;L'autorizzazione può essere revocata, ciò esclude dunque la natura dei requisiti sia limitata al solo momento di origine. 

Questo è vero, ma è un evento rarissimo: per motivi ""sostanziali"" e non ""formali"" la Vigilanza preferisce commissariare gli enti da essa vigilati e avviarli o al risanamento o all'inglobamento in altre istituzioni più solide. Come è successo recentemente a Spoleto e come accadrà prossimamente a Siena.

&gt; C'è d'altronde il grandissimo problema che Uber non ha sede legale in Italia. E' una BV (Besloten Vennotschap) una holding di diritto olandese con sede legale ad Amsterdam (ah le tasse, peccato che un istituto di pagamento italiano che operi in Italia dovrebbe pagarle nel paese dove l'attività è esercitata). 

Esiste il c.d. ""passaporto europeo"", ovvero chiunque abbia ottenuto una licenza bancaria o parabancaria può esercitare l'attività nei paesi dell'Unione, previa comunicazione alle autorità di vigilanza locali.

In ogni caso, Sisal Group SpA è sia holding che istituto di pagamento, per cui la cosa si può ripetere, causa esistenza di precedenti. :-)

My wife and I only considered medical advice. Medical benefits, potential issues, etc. I'm circumcised (both parents are ardently non-religious and made their decision more on what was culturally normal at the time) and I have never felt at any point that I was mutilated nor have I ever felt bitter towards my parents. Anyway.

So we only considered medical journals and scholarly articles. All of the ones we sourced were stating that the benefits outweigh the negatives. Our OB reiterated the same findings as did our Pediatrician. My wife and I, as is our OB and our Pediatrician are all non-religious. 

Everything we found, again, non-religious, also supported the procedure. So we had it done. Son was in no pain at any point and healed fully within 5 days. 

I didn't really think about it until I was reading about breastmilk and came across the shitshow that is debate about circumcision. I hadn't really thought about how it is approached in Europe or other places. 

At this point, my wife and I kinda regret our decision. It seems most people just don't have a ""well, it is what it is"" but instead if you're cut then your parents are mutilating barbarians?

false,JasonYamel,UKRA,Ukraine,"&gt; I just want Ukrainians to stop pretending that L'viv is an old and ancient Ukrainian city, always Ukrainian for the last 50000 years and totally has nothing in common with Poland nor it never had. Because that describes how most of my experiences with Ukrainians regarding the city were.

I haven't experienced that. Most people I know who are actually from Lviv recognize the city's rich Polish history. It *is* an old and ancient Ukrainian city, but it has been under Polish rule and had a majority Polish population for far longer.

&gt;since the city was relocated in 1356,

Relocated? Interesting, haven't heard about that. From what I know, Lviv was founded in 1256 by Danylo of Galicia and hasn't been relocated at any point. Perhaps you could add some mention of this to the [wiki article on the history of the city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Lviv#Early_history)?

At any rate, Lviv had sizeable Ukrainian and Jewish minorities (in the first half of the 20th century, these two minorities constituted half of the city's population). So while it is correct to say that the city was culturally Polish, it wasn't anywhere close to mono-ethnic. So was it a ""Polish city"" like Warsaw or Krakow? Certainly in some ways, certainly not in other ways.

&gt;And perhaps stop worshipping scum and criminals like Bandera.

If all you retain from reading about Bandera is that he's scum and a criminal, you'll never understand why so many Ukrainians ""worship"" him (i.e. ignore the crimes). Now, if you're not interested in understanding, that's fine - but then why should anyone try to understand your point of view?

Légalement parlant et (à mon avis) moralement parlant, rien ne peut sanctionner le fait de ne pas se mettre en danger soi-même pour essayer de protéger autrui, surtout quand la police est déjà alertée.

Sinon, derrière le raisonnement selon lequel ne pas s'interposer directement (apparemment même prévenir la police ne suffit plus...) est synonyme d'indifférence voire d'égoisme (sic) se cache l'idée selon laquelle ""*on*"" doit intervenir. Se pose la question de qui on désigne par ce ""on"" collectif. J'imagine sans prendre trop de risque que personne ne s'attend à ce qu'une femme isolée prenne part au pugilat contre 3 filles violentes. 

Donc comme l'article ne fait pas mention d'un large groupe quelconque de femmes qui seraient là au moment des faits, on voit bien que la responsabilité d'intervenir tombe en fait ici (encore et toujours) sur un ou quelques hommes au plus. 

Encore une fois on fait appel à des mécanismes vieux comme le monde de ""shaming"" des hommes qui n'accomplissent pas leur ""devoir"" de ""protecteur"", un devoir archaïque, patriarcal qui dans notre société égalitariste n'a pas de raison d'être récompensé (et ne l'est pas). C'est sous-entendu lourdement dans le cas présent à Roubaix, c'est pratiquement dit dans l'autre cas à Lille mentionné par l'article ""*je me suis assis à côté d'un homme et il a rien fait !*"", et c'est comme ça que c'est directement interprété par les gens qui ont commenté l'article.

Autre raison (non sexuée, cette fois) qui me froisse et qui fait que je ne peux que dissuader autrui de sauver la veuve et l'orphelin : l'article cite un autre précédent datant d'il y'a seulement quelques mois qui avait déjà fait polémique pour la même raison. Le ministère public aurait conclu lors du procès de l'affaire que ""cette société l'inquiète"". Mais ce qui aurait aussi inquiété le ministère public, c'est évidemment que quelqu'un fasse justice soi-même. Le même ministère public aurait aussi sanctionné un passant qui détient une arme illégalement (seul moyen de pouvoir protéger autrui seul contre quelqu'un plus fort, ou en infériorité numérique), et le même ministère public n'en a rien à carrer si tu te fais péter la gueule par les cousins venus en renfort.

false,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"For what it's worth, here's my brief story:

I'm 28 and was born in the US to American parents. Both of their families are British/Canadian by origin (my dad's is also part Croatian), but my father was circumcised as is tradition. Being born in the US, my parents told me they opted to have me cut basically for the purposes of fitting in, since that's what my dad was and there was no reason to break the cycle, so to speak.

When I was just entering my teens, I moved to the UK with my dad for a few years. Two years later, we moved back to the US for a few years, and after I graduated from high school, I went back to the UK on my own to go to uni, and I've lived there ever since.

I do get looks and comments as a result. Encounters turn into a mini biology lesson, coupled with explaining that no, I'm not Jewish, it's how most guys born in the US are (or were in the 1980s). I feel misplaced and it has hit my self esteem dramatically in trying to find someone in Europe. 

I confronted my parents about it a few years ago and my mother's basic response in her defence was: ""How was I supposed to know I'd have an international penis to deal with?"" In other words, by not fitting into her expectations of how my life would go, her decisions would make impacts that she couldn't have possibly taken into account when she made them (when I was just days old). 

So the issue to me is less about what my personal feelings about it are (and if I were to ever have a son, I'd opt not to cut them for sure), but rather me coming to terms with something that was done when I was so young that I'm virtually powerless to change it even if I wanted to. It's not like a healthy diet and exercise, or some other lifestyle change, will make my foreskin grow back - it was tossed into a medical waste bin in 1986. 

In general, this speaks to an issue that I think *all* people have to one extent or another: how to make choices for your child when you have no clue what their future will hold, and what path they will decide to take? You can make all the best decisions based on the evidence available to you (family wisdom, cultural convention, national test scores and research) and still never quite know. You can get your kid into the best high schools in the US, but unless they're taking internationally-recognised secondary qualifications like A-levels, IB, Cambridge Honours or something else, their chances of direct entry into a British university is effectively closed. Now what if they've suddenly decided that they would give anything to study in the UK? How were you supposed to know when they were 13 which type of education to opt for? What if you were born in a different country, and thus your child is eligible for another passport that would make moving to the EU a breeze, but you didn't pay attention and now they're older than 18 and no longer able to register? How were you to know they'd ever want to? I mention this because I work in a primary school and have been having this conversation with several parents recently, trying to light fires under them to get their kids other passports if there are time limits. 

You never know what the future holds, and some times we all make decisions that close doors well into the future that we didn't know existed until we found they had already been shut.

Maintaining  the  course  would  require a significant volume of water, which is in short supply in the region, as well as intensive use of plant protection products, which would pollute groundwater.""

Everything good that happens is because of the national politics, and everything bad is because of Brussels. That's how they spin it everywhere, not just the UK. The main reason is that the media thinks (and rightfully so) that European politics are boring. So in each country, the focus lies on national politics, and they get to shift the blame and use the EU as a scapegoat. However, at the same time the most important and influential people within the European government are the leaders of each memberstate. So whenever a national leader is pissed at the EU, it is very much likely they share a part of that responsibility.

[According to Duden](http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/sehen), the standard German reference (scroll down to find ""Aussprache""), the standard German pronunciation of ""sehen"" is two syllables, but the ""h"" is not pronounced.

The ""h"" in this position is often referred to as a ""Dehnungs-H"" -- an H which makes the previous vowel sound longer -- but technically it's a ""Silbenfugen-H"" -- an H which is used to join a long vowel to a second vowel while still keeping them distinct. Thus ""Seen"", ""lakes"", is one syllable, but ""Sehen"" is two.

Both the ""Silbenfugen-H"" and the ""Dehnungs-H"" should not be pronounced; but although no native speakers ever pronounce the ""Dehnungs-H"", some do pronounce the ""Silbenfugen-H"" when reading texts aloud. This is considered to be incorrect, however; the German word for this phenomenon is ""Überlautung"", which means something like ""over-pronunciation"".

According to all the references I can find, Duden's pronunciation is the correct formal pronunciation. Of course, in natural speech, most speakers will swallow the second vowel, pronuncing ""sehen"" like ""Seen"".",0,1414174711,null,0,false,0,clipw2o,t3_2k7ox1,t1_clipw2o,t3_2k7ox1,null,1426368933,9,false,German,t5_2qq51,9

You do not pronounce the ""h"", so the word is not pronounced the way it's spelled. A transcription of the correct pronunciation for ""sehen"" would be [ze:.ᵊn], so your ""guh-zane"" definitely comes closer to the real deal than ""geh-zeh-hen"" does. Still, it's an easy mistake to make and even natives are prone to pronouncing it that way when trying to justify the spelling (""Schreib, wie du sprichst."" - Yeah, right!).

Now, if you're wondering why spelling and pronunciation differ: In Old High German (around 500-1050), the word &lt;sehan&gt; was still pronounced *with* the ""h"", so spelling it with one made a lot of sense. In Middle High German (1050-1350), though, the ""h"" in this case wasn't pronounced anymore due to processes of sound change. Still, variations in spelling that excluded the letter never really took over and we stuck with ""sehen"". 

So while the ""h"" might offer you an insight into etymology, you'll just have to disregard it when speaking.

Edit: for the downvoters, actually read about FGM: **http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/**

&gt;No health benefits, only harm
FGM has no health benefits, and it harms girls and women in many ways. It involves removing and damaging healthy and normal female genital tissue, and interferes with the natural functions of girls' and women's bodies.

&gt;Immediate complications can include severe pain, shock, haemorrhage (bleeding), tetanus or sepsis (bacterial infection), urine retention, open sores in the genital region and injury to nearby genital tissue.

&gt;Long-term consequences can include:

&gt;recurrent bladder and urinary tract infections;
cysts;
infertility;
an increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths;
the need for later surgeries. For example, the FGM procedure that seals or narrows a vaginal opening (type 3 above) needs to be cut open later to allow for sexual intercourse and childbirth. Sometimes it is stitched again several times, including after childbirth, hence the woman goes through repeated opening and closing procedures, further increasing and repeated both immediate and long-term risks. 

Edit 2: The reason I take this personally is because FGM is so barbaric and terrible. Absolutely deplorable in modern society. When anyone points to it and says ""what about circumcision??"" it detracts from the main issue and causes a ton of debate over a topic that should be perfectly clear.

&gt; Esiste il c.d. ""passaporto europeo"", ovvero chiunque abbia ottenuto una licenza bancaria o parabancaria può esercitare l'attività nei paesi dell'Unione, previa comunicazione alle autorità di vigilanza locali.

Il mutuo riconoscimento non si applica nel caso in questione, non essendo Uber un istituto di pagamento già  autorizzato in alcuna delle giurisdizioni comunitarie. Se intende essere riconosciuto in Italia le alternative sono due: l'ottenimento della licenza nei Paesi Bassi e la richiesta (eminentemente formale) successiva di  autorizzazione  da parte della Banca d'Italia, oppure la costituzione di una società ad hoc   di diritto italiano con sede legale e  direzione generale in Italia dotata di  un patrimonio adeguato e successiva richiesta di licenza.

Uber è attualmente organizzato come una società a responsabilità limitata olandese che fa da holding (esercente attività commerciale, quindi non pura) avente sede legale in Olanda. Per la legge italiana, Uber olandese non può nemmeno destinare un patrimonio separato ed ottenere l'autorizzazione ma  è  tenuta alla costituzione di una controllata (società di capitali)   incorporata italiana che sia patrimonialmente autonoma. Come puoi perfettamente comprendere, non è una posizione fiscalmente ed industrialmente  pianificata ed ottimizzata.

&gt; Vero invece, per quello detto da me sopra: esperienza diretta. Se sono stato troppo riduttivo è perchè i sordidi dettagli procedurali non interessano a tutti. :-)

Ti ho spiegato sopra perchè no, e perchè Sisal è un caso differente.

&gt;per cui la cosa si può ripetere, causa esistenza di precedenti. :-)

Veramente no, è proprio in questo che si sostanzia la discrezionalità del regolatore. Non è detto che il precedente apprezzamento rilasciato a favore di un operatore debba necessariamente implicare un omogeneità  nell'esito  dei controlli preventivi  aventi come oggetto richiedenti successivi (d'altra parte uno stesso operatore può essere autorizzato all'esercizio  incipiente di  una determinata attività ma risultare successivamente inidoneo, così come si può essere autorizzati ad offrire determinati servizi ma non altri,  è la manifestazione della discrezionalità tecnica dell'organo amministrativo).  Se così fosse non vi sarebbe necessità né del regolatore né di una valutazione sulla congruenza organizzativa né di un atto specifico ma si  limiterebbe la procedura ad un semplice form online. D'altra parte la consegna di una copia dell'atto costitutivo è indicazione  proprio di ciò, va da sé che se l'oggetto sociale è implicitamente contrario ad una norma...

Similmente, la concessione della licenza bancaria a Unicredit non implica che il controllo su Banca Poggibonsi debba necessariamente avere esito positivo (a prescindere dalla verifica dei requisiti specifici). 
Con ogni probabilità ti sei spiegato malissimo. 


&gt; Secondo me invece potrebbe scegliere questa strada, se - come prevedo - qualcuno cercherà di spostare la cosa sul piano della gestione delle transazioni, che mi pare il loro più grosso punto debole: i rischi legali principalmente sono a carico dei driver (bravi! a roma direbbero ""fare l'omosessuale con l'ano altrui"").

A me sembra sia molto più efficiente esternalizzare ad un provider terzo. Che sia Apple Pay o Stripe o altri.

Though this isn't a direct medical source, it does cite the basics that we did our research on.

Just about any and all medical advice we found advocated it or at least echo'd the benefits. Some of the critics of it were also groups that criticized medical immunizations and other modern medical techniques. Long story short, as the article states, from ~1999-2012 the AAP did not have a stance on circumcision. The AAP simply said ""do it if you want based on cultural applications"". So the rate of circumcision in the US dropped steadily. Then, in 2012, after a compendium of data on health benefits and drawbacks had been reviewed, the AAP and medical personnel in the US generally took a pro-circumcision stance. 

See where this is going? At least here in the US, when you're trying to make the decision, you have academic and medical sources citing benefits. And when we asked our OB and Pediatrician about long-term benefits of the foreskin (outside of any mutilation talking points) they didn't cite any as long as the procedure was not botched. Which, of course, we had total faith in our OB to do it well and she did. 

So it was basically a decision that boiled down to:

Medical benefits of removal versus any medical benefits to keeping it on. 

It was a difficult decision that we made and we've rethought it. I stated elsewhere that there was a regret due to the almost vitriolic responses people have given. 

I don't think I mutilated my child but I can also see how it could be seen that way from people where it's not a common practice and is especially given a poor light due to circumcision being a religious practice.

So in the end, we made the best decision we could make having placed a great amount of faith in the medical community in the US. Had my wife and I had our children in 2010, based on medical information available we likely would not have circumcised. This was purely a medical decision and, again, the short-term drawbacks (i.e. any pain for the child) was extremely minimal.

EDIT: And I do appreciate the way you phrased your response. You're not deriding while also giving your firm stance but you're also querying for my rationality on my decision.

But that's fact. Lithuanian government banned polish language from street names, to schools, which led to lithuanization and expulsion of Poles from this Polish-Russian-Lithuanian city. Kids in schools were punnished by beating for speaking polish

&gt; Please tell me when have Poland held Vilnius before braking Suwalki agreement (two days after signing it)?

Lithuania never had this city. It was formed and didn't have borders. Official borders were signed in the treaty of Versailles where no one from West Europe had any dispute that the 90% Polish and Jewish city will be in Poland. And the Suwałki agreement was a temporary agreement that doesn't even lined borders. 
And Poland technically did not broke the Suwałki agreement, because this agreement did not included that the Polish city will be Lithuanian, it just included the small demilitarized zone, just that. And Polish army was in Wilno during Polish-Soviet war. Noone even thought that it ""might"" be lithuanian, because it was clearly polish

No hate, but as you said: ""Wtif is this shit?"" I mean WTF is that what you just wrote. It's just an ignorant comment nothing more. Just typical idealistic lithuanian version

false,escaday,null,null,"&gt; Da questo punto di vista non è lo stato a dover rincorrere Uber, visto che uber non fa nulla di nuovo ma si limita a promuovere un ritorno ad un passato privo di sovrastrutture, ritorno che si attua mediante la violazione della legge.

Non è proprio così, le regole sono nate in un epoca in cui l'unico modo per tutelare il consumatore era quello di creare la categoria dei tassisti. Al giorno d'oggi c'è il GPS, ci sono le app, è molto più facile il background check, puoi leggere i feedback in real time, etc. Venirmi a dire che il principio alla base della tutela legislativa per i tassisti sia ancora attuale solo perché è legge mi sembra un po' miope.

&gt; Che Uber viola, dal poaching, alle bugie, alle campagne di smearing online, dal mettere i regolatori contro la concorrenza fino all'intasare di false richieste le compagnie concorrenti

Se così fosse, Uber sarà destinata a perdere quote di mercato a favore di un concorrente che operi in maniera migliore. A differenza del monopolio dei tassisti in un mercato ""deregolato"" potrebbe emergere il fornitore di servizio migliore, o quantomeno si potrebbe creare una sana concorrenza che alla fine comunque beneficia il consumatore finale.

&gt;  Perchè Uber...

Tutti questi perché (se veri) finiranno inevitabilmente con il suicidio di Uber sul mercato. Guarda cosa pensa Reddit di Comcast, più o meno così.

&gt; Anche la carne avariata può essere commestibile se trattata, offrendo un servizio migliore a parità di prezzo, certo è illegale vendere la carne avariata, puoi beccarti la salmonella,

Si ma tu assumi sia che il mercato non si self-regolerebbe, cosa che invece io credo, soprattutto con la possibilità di informarsi che esiste oggi; sia che il servizio sia migliore, cosa che non è. È sicuramente un servizio più economico, ma non migliore. Invece Uber è un servizio migliore a tutti gli effetti.

&gt; Se si parla di libero mercato e di utilità, fa specie che venga presa a modello una società che allo stato attuale delle cose si regge in piedi grazie all'iniezione di liquidità anche di fondi pensione e asset managers.

È vero anche per le early stage di qualsiasi colosso a crescita ultrarapida, è impossibile crescere a certi ritmi senza iniezioni di liquidità. Non è che i founder dan via equity così per divertirsi, c'è un esigenza precisa (crescere).

&gt; Una volta che avranno raggiungo il loro scopo, smetteranno di limitarsi ad estrarre valore dai propri autisti (che rischiano sanzioni in quanto operano nell'illegalità) o dalla semplice violazione di leggi che i propri competitor sono comodamente tenuti a rispettare, e passeranno a tosare me (consumatore), dopo che quella posizione dominante è stata raggiunta grazie ai finanziamenti offerti da me (fondo pensione) o banca centrale (perchè la sharing economy si regge in piede oggi che c'è liquidità a costo quasi zero).

Quando e se passeranno a tosare te perderanno tutti i clienti a favore di un competitor, dato che lo switching cost per l'utente è praticamente zero. Esattamente come Taxi oggi vs Uber. 

&gt; C'è un ente che ha il privilegio di essere supportato da operatori con le tasche larghe, e nonostante non sia il migliore può comunque permettersi di mandare fuori mercato la concorrenza (senza essere profittevole nella fase intermedia). Suona qualche campana? Dovrebbe, è esattamente la storia di Amazon.

Amazon **è** il migliore, ed ha incrementato l'utilità dei consumatori in maniera incredibile. Mi dispiace per la libreria di 30 metri quadri sotto casa, ma ""evolve or die"".

&gt; Secondo la tua logica prettamente utilitaristica, anche i boss della mafia sono imprenditori legittimi e di successo. Sono gli spacciatori i criminali, il boss mica si sporca le mani, sono i subalterni quelli che rischiano facendo il lavoro sporco. Business model identico a quello di Uber, e come Uber, occorre essere gli unici a non rispettare la legge mentre gli altri sono obbligati, proprio per tenere sotto scacco la competizione, e chissenefrega dei poveracci in overdose.

Qui l'argomento è delicato, ma come potrai immaginare non credo nel proibizionismo, quindi trovo che gli spacciatori non facciano altro che colmare le esigenze di un mercato che per quanto illegale, esiste.

Il business model non è uguale e l'esempio non calza, un esempio più corretto sarebbe quello del contrabbando di sigarette. Lo stato le vende tramite i tabaccai a 5€, il contrabbandiere a 2€. La differenza però è che mentre il fumatore crea un danno sociale e quindi deve pagare per il delta di spesa sanitaria che crea (e quindi il cliente del contrabbandiere arreca un danno a tutta la società), il cliente di Uber non penalizza nessuno, essendo il prezzo dei taxi maggiore solo per un principio di domanda ed offerta.

The British electorate voted for the government that got them into the EU (Edward Heath) and they also voted for the government that created new treaties, like the Maastrich Treaty (Thatcher, John Mayor's government),  or the agreement on the current financing of the EU of 2010 (Brown, Cameron). 

Btw, the EU is not a Republic of Europe. Granted there are talks about that, which require further treaties and contracts negotiated by the heads and members of EU governments. These are again voted by the electorate of each country. It might be that the government only has a small majority and they are not representing the political view of the entire population of the country (quite healthy for a democracy though). But in our current system that gives them the power to make decisions for the entire country.    

Ok, personal experience now. So I might be utterly wrong. I was in the UK during the latest EU parliament election. I gave up the right to vote in my home country and therefore was allowed to vote for the EU parliament in the UK. When researching which party I wanted to vote for I found it quite difficult during election time to find the views of Labor or the Conservatives on the EU. There also didn't really seem to be an election campaign except for the UKIP. Farage was quite clear on UKIP views and actions on the EU. Granted it might just have gone over my head; election posters and such might not be that big during election campaigns in the UK and maybe I need to be knocked onto my head with a large ""it is election time""- hammer to gather information, but I thought that the UK parties were rather quieted about their ideas of shaping the future of the EU.

Più in generale c'è il solito problema del cinema italiano, nel suo rapporto con il genere. Non si riescono a fare film di genere che ai accontentano di essere tali (l'unica eccezione recente che mi viene in mente è Zampaglione, con un horror puro, anche se italiano solo per metà). Il genere deve sempre significare qualcos'altro. Deve essere un simbolo, una metafora. Il cinema italiano non riesce a divertirsi, se non con le scurregge o Zelig.

E anche qui, i supereroi sembrano palesemente da subito la metafora di un'altra cosa di cui non mi frega nulla.

Nope. They were mostly antagonizing Vietnam which does not have a US military presence (although it does have a Russian one). Vietnam and ASEAN subsequently invited the US to a summit on regional security after China's aggression there. Keep in mind, the US does not have a presence there yet, but China's actions caused ASEAN to reach out to the US. Vietnam has not exactly been the most pro-US place in the world, but China's actions are making it more and more so. 

&gt;Few years of same level of media pressing and you'll be ready and justify even military actions against Russia.

If Russia tries to pull what it did in Ukraine in a NATO country, absolutely. Not against Russia proper, but certainly against Russian forces in NATO countries. 

&gt; I wonder what if Russia start to invite Latin America, North Africa countries in own military (of course just for defence!) block. You'll whine loudly for sure.

Many South American countries have a stronger relationship with Russia than they do with the US. Russia can feel free to see if those nations want to host its bases. I doubt they would but it can certainly feel free to try. If the US was still acting as it did in the 50s and 60s toward them I would not blame them if they wanted Russian bases there.

false,itz4mna,UKGB,United Kingdom - England,"&gt; The British electorate voted for the government that got them into the EU (Edward Heath) and they also voted for the government that created new treaties, like the Maastrich Treaty (Thatcher, John Mayor's government), or the agreement on the current financing of the EU of 2010 (Brown, Cameron). 

I don't think they were particularly open about their intentions. Nobody would have voted them in based on ""give more powers and taxpayer's money to the EU"". To be fair back then it wasn't openly loathed as it is now, Euroskepticism has only become a major force thanks to recent events like the election of Juncker, not wanting to get dragged down with the Eurozone after the crisis and all the free airtime the BBC has given politicians like Farage to draw attention to and criticise the activities of the EU.

&gt;Btw, the EU is not a Republic of Europe. Granted there are talks about that, which require further treaties and contracts negotiated by the heads and members of EU governments. These are again voted by the electorate of each country. It might be that the government only has a small majority and they are not representing the political view of the entire population of the country (quite healthy for a democracy though). But in our current system that gives them the power to make decisions for the entire country. 

It's been the plan from the start, even Churchill wanted a Republic of Europe (albeit one that did not include Britain). I don't think anybody would declare a Republic of Europe at once, they know it would be deeply unpopular so they'd use the treaties and contracts you mention to build it bit by bit. I don't think the national governments would see fit to bother with asking the people either, we certainly haven't been asked specifically since the 1970s. You can argue that we voted in Europhile politicians but there's never really been a viable alternative until UKIP and even then they won't form a majority regardless.

&gt;Ok, personal experience now. So I might be utterly wrong. I was in the UK during the latest EU parliament election. I gave up the right to vote in my home country and therefore was allowed to vote for the EU parliament in the UK. When researching which party I wanted to vote for I found it quite difficult during election time to find the views of Labor or the Conservatives on the EU. There also didn't really seem to be an election campaign except for the UKIP. Farage was quite clear on UKIP views and actions on the EU. Granted it might just have gone over my head; election posters and such might not be that big during election campaigns in the UK and maybe I need to be knocked onto my head with a large ""it is election time""- hammer to gather information, but I thought that the UK parties were rather quieted about their ideas of shaping the future of the EU. 

Yeah, they're deliberately vague because an open Europhile is not going to get a majority in the UK any more. It's shameful the amount of participation in the European elections, we're really disengaged from our political process. We'll rail against the system all day but nobody wants to work with it to either reform it or in the case of the EU hold a referendum on leaving altogether, not until UKIP started gaining ground anyway. Farage is no better, his campaign is good because the entire reason his party exists is opposition to the EU.

&gt;“The system of international relations needed some changes, but the USA, who believe they were the winners of the Cold War, have not seen the need for this.”

Actually, many things have changed. China is one of the US' largest trading partners. In the 50s and 60s the US was acting the way Russia is today in South/Central America. It has also substantially changed its approach. Now it seems to feel trading with its neighbors is a preferable approach to a heavy fist. 

This is a lesson China and Russia have yet to learn. While everyone was captivated by the Crimea situation, China built an oil rig in disputed waters with several countries. It damaged 7 Vietnamese ships there in protest and said Vietnam should not do anything if it knew what was good for it. Subsequently ASEAN (of which Vietnam is a powerful member) invited the US to a summit on regional security. Seems as if countries military alignment with the US *is* predicated on their neighbor's aggressiveness, regardless of how many times Russia claims NATO is the aggressor. 

&gt;Putin also touched on the issue of the growth of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, and also accused the West of, ""turning a blind eye,""

Probably good to remember Russia vetoed any action against the Islamic State at the outset. And then threatened the US with the use of force should it hit ISIS targets inside Syria.

&gt;Perhaps Putin's harshest criticism was reserved for the West's creation of color revolutions and ""controlled chaos,"" which he a likened to ""letting the genie out of the bottle,"" with particular reference to Ukraine.

Russians like to talk about the Nuland call so much but never tell the full story. Yes, she was talking about who the relevant opposition could be. That was to get them to the negotiating table with Yanukovych. They also conveniently leave out the fact that she said the US needed to reach out to Russia and get the UN there as soon as possible. Coup tip number 107, dont get the UN involved before the ""coup"" has even occurred, and certainly dont try to mitigate the situation with all of the participating parties. She said ""fuck the EU"" because they would not contribute any meaningful party to mitigate between the UN, opposition, Russia, and Yahukovych's government. 

Sorry Russia, your unilateral demands on Ukraine is what caused this, not the US.

false,Genematrix,bookworm,,"&gt; Non è proprio così, le regole sono nate in un epoca in cui l'unico modo per tutelare il consumatore era quello di creare la categoria dei tassisti. Al giorno d'oggi c'è il GPS, ci sono le app, è molto più facile il background check, puoi leggere i feedback in real time, etc. Venirmi a dire che il principio alla base della tutela legislativa per i tassisti sia ancora attuale solo perché è legge mi sembra un po' miope.

Guarda che l'unionizzazione dei tassisti non è un fenomeno che si perde nei meandri della storia. E' abbastanza recente, è nata  quando si sono poste le esigenze di costituire organi che nei fatti esercitassero una sorta di controllo sui singoli prestatori di servizio.
Perchè occorreva qualcuno che operasse dei background checks, perchè occorreva uno standard tariffario unico, occorreva disciplinare la competizione in modo che gli autisti non  si ammazzassero tra loro (mettendo a rischio l'incolumità del cliente), perchè  era necessario  che gli autisti si dotassero di assicurazioni per i propri clienti ed in ultima istanza era opportuno un controllo sui veicoli che venivano immessi in strada e che offrivano un servizio quasipubblico, erano necessarie regole che disciplinassero il rapporto di lavoro e definissero i profili tributari dell'attività.

Ovvio che per il  singolo consumatore Uber sia conveniente. La società può offrire lo stesso  servizio ma a costi competitivi, e lo fa tagliando l'overhead. Il punto è  che  la sovrastruttura è esattamente tutto ciò che ho elencato di sopra,  non è un'innovazione, non rispettano le regole mentre i competitor si, quindi è ovvio che siano più reattivi, d'altronde nemmeno devono preoccuparsi dei profili di legalità, la questione è scaricata sui propri dipendenti... oops, non sono dipendenti, va bene, l'importante è che hai capito.
Lol technology non è una risposta intelligente, perchè certe tesi vanno argomentate con i fatti, le prove empiriche.

&gt; Se così fosse, Uber sarà destinata a perdere quote di mercato a favore di un concorrente che operi in maniera migliore. A differenza del monopolio dei tassisti in un mercato ""deregolato"" potrebbe emergere il fornitore di servizio migliore, o quantomeno si potrebbe creare una sana concorrenza che alla fine comunque beneficia il consumatore finale.


Io penso che ci sia una sterminata letteratura nel campo dell'economia industriale, dalla definizione  di  vendor lock-in  alla descrizione dei fenomeni di regulatory capture da parte del monopolsita. Letteratura alla quale non rendi giustizia. Non solo perchè il mercato deregolato tende al monopolio, ma soprattutto in quanto non è una scelta ottimale da parte dell'operatore pubblico. Mi sembra una visione rose tinted.

&gt; Tutti questi perché (se veri) finiranno inevitabilmente con il suicidio di Uber sul mercato. Guarda cosa pensa Reddit di Comcast, più o meno così.

Reddit è una piccola isola, d'altronde  il tuo stesso  esempio  ti da' torto. Comcast è un monopolista e continuerà ad esserlo indipendentemente dal disprezzo degli internettiani, perchè nei fatti ha distrutto la concorrenza a colpa di lobbying, non c'è proprio alternativa. Se il merger con Time Warner dovesse andare in porto,  le cose non potranno che peggiorare.
A tutti gli effetti è stato proprio il laissez-faire del regolatore  statunitense a determinare questa incresciosa situazione.  Il risultato è che i supplysiders degli anni 80 hanno messo gli statunitensi nella situazione di operare con alcune delle peggiori connessioni per rapporto qualità/prezzo di tutto il   mondo occidentale.  D'altra parte lo stesso Coase considerava l'esistenza di esternalità  non direttamente prezzabili.
Quindi grazie per l'esempio di Comcast, godono di perfetta salute mentre il consumatore è impotente, mi hai dato ragione.


&gt; Si ma tu assumi sia che il mercato non si self-regolerebbe, cosa che invece io credo, soprattutto con la possibilità di informarsi che esiste oggi; sia che il servizio sia migliore, cosa che non è. È sicuramente un servizio più economico, ma non migliore. Invece Uber è un servizio migliore a tutti gli effetti.

Domanda,  non hai studiato economia? Ti rimando al concetto del mercato dei limoni. 
Sinteticamente esistono delle frizioni nel mercato, delle asimmetrie che  impediscono al prezzo di formarsi in maniera chiara. Il mercato è incapace di  autoregolarsi, tanto più che la stessa ipotesi dei due teoremi di Pareto  (quelle che stai  inavvertitamente ripetendo) fa perno sull'esistenza di un mercato libero, concorrenziale e privo di monopoli.  E' un modello e poco più, nei fatti quei presupposti sono irrealizzabili. E' un mito, di scientifico non c'è nulla,  che il mercato puro e  anarchico non funzioni è una delle prime cose che si insegna nelle facoltà di economia (dopo la legge di Okun). Puoi crederlo come i religiosi vanno a messa, ma ai fini di questa discussione non  ha valore argomentativo.  Oramai  solo una sparuta minoranza  ha fede nel mercato perfetto, lo stesso Fama (il padre dell'EMH) ha riformulato la propria ipotesi in senso debole.


&gt; È vero anche per le early stage di qualsiasi colosso a crescita ultrarapida, è impossibile crescere a certi ritmi senza iniezioni di liquidità. Non è che i founder dan via equity così per divertirsi, c'è un esigenza precisa (crescere).

Ahi ahi ahi, sono puntiglioso lo so, ma lo faccio di mestiere.  Le valutazioni di una growth company, rappresentano il valore attuale di una compagnia  tenendo conto  anticipatamente dei flussi  di cassa futuri. Come puoi ben immaginare è un'arte più che una scienza (non l'ho tirata in ballo così, per gioco), chi ti assicura che domani uber continui ad essere monopolista, chi ti assicura che uber non venga dichiarata illegale. Come fa notare un mostro sacro come Damodaran, la compagnia è effettivamente overvalued ed è abbastanza insolito che investitori istituzionali come i fondi pensione operino  iniettando liquidità in società rischiose e non quotate. La causa naturalmente è la ZIRP.
Grazie comunque del tentativo di spiegazione. ;)

&gt; Amazon è il migliore, ed ha incrementato l'utilità dei consumatori in maniera incredibile. Mi dispiace per la libreria di 30 metri quadri sotto casa, ma ""evolve or die"".

Non parlavo della libreria sotto casa. D'altronde ho come l'impressione che tu abbia poca tolleranza per le regole della concorrenza, a te interessa il prodotto a basso costo,  la legalità è un optional (d'altronde stai difendendo una compagnia che opera come opera nei confronti dei competitors).
Nel caso di Amazon facevo riferimento alla strategia attuata da Bezos di  tagliare i costi dei beni fino al sottocosto, strategia attuabile grazie ad investitori particolarmente leali, la società ha quindi potuto sostenere delle perdite anche per periodi  lunghi fino al collasso della concorrenza. E' una strategia che è stata adottata anche per convincere targets particolarmente restii ad un'acquisizione (accanto ad esempio alle influenze sui fornitori comuni).  
E' abbastanza scontato che il fine di Amazon sia quello di raggiungere una posizione di monopolista assoluto fino a poter comandare i prezzi in assenza di concorrenza. Una volta raggiunta quella posizione, l'incumbent è indistruttibile, visto che il challenger è eliminato o acquisito prima che possa divenire una minaccia (lo fanno già ora, figuriamoci tra qualche anno).  E' per questo motivo che esistono lo stato e le leggi, il consumatore magari non può percepire il problema, per fortuna però che  nei secoli il sistema ha creato degli anticorpi e li ha codificati.
Sempre parlando di Amazon, avrai sentito dello scontro con i publishers e di come amazon abbia sospeso la vendita dei libri di determinate compagnie ree di essersi opposte ai termini pattizi precedentemente negoziati. Ecco questo è un abuso di posizione dominante, se il mercato fosse lasciato libero da ogni ingerenza dello stato, Amazon sarebbe libera di distruggere qualsiasi operatore non di suo gradimento, come eliminare commercialmente un autore sgradito.  La libertà economica di un operatore non può mai essere in contrasto con  le esigenze  di utilità sociale, soprattutto quando quell'operatore ha delle dimensioni consistenti del mercato. Quindi no, il mercato libero non è necessariamente più efficiente.

&gt; Qui l'argomento è delicato, ma come potrai immaginare non credo nel proibizionismo, quindi trovo che gli spacciatori non facciano altro che colmare le esigenze di un mercato che per quanto illegale, esiste.

Lasciamo perdere il proibizionismo, sostituisci droga con racket.


&gt; Il business model non è uguale e l'esempio non calza, un esempio più corretto sarebbe quello del contrabbando di sigarette. Lo stato le vende tramite i tabaccai a 5€, il contrabbandiere a 2€. La differenza però è che mentre il fumatore crea un danno sociale e quindi deve pagare per il delta di spesa sanitaria che crea (e quindi il cliente del contrabbandiere arreca un danno a tutta la società), il cliente di Uber non penalizza nessuno, essendo il prezzo dei taxi maggiore solo per un principio di domanda ed offerta. 

No, è proprio lo stesso. Uber fornisce la struttura e capitalizza su di una condotta illegale di un soggetto altrui (l'autista), dipendente economicamente ma formalmente estraneo.
Il boss fornisce la struttura (il clan ed il territorio) e capitalizza su di una condotta illegale di un soggetto altrui (il guappo), dipendente economicamente (la mesata) ma formalmente estraneo.
Se tolleri il primo  sulle note di viva il free-market allora per coerenza devi difendere anche il secondo.  Non si scappa.

Se le leggi sono un orpello, allora  l'autista di taxi ha tutto il diritto di spaccare la faccia e l'auto dell'uber driver.
Guarda che la libertà di violare le leggi è una cosa pericolosa, ti si può ritorcere contro, è per questo che loro non vogliono rispettarle, ma gli altri si'.

My point is: mutilating a person, be it by cutting their finger or nob, is a heinous crime that should be met with sever consequence.

L'autobus in questione e' uno solo (la linea 69 per l'esattezza) il quale collega Borgaro con la parte nord di Torino. Da li' io prendo altri mezzi per arrivare al Politecnico di Torino, siccome studio li'. Il problema con i zingari - non tutti, ci sono eccezioni - e' che in sostanza se ne fregano degli altri. 

Puzzano, fanno rumore e parlano a voce alta, mangiano cibo e buttano la spazzatura per terra (non fuori, dentro il pullman, e preferibilmente sopra le sedie), sputano alla gente. Se sono in tanti, e ci sono anche studenti che vanno/ritornano dalla scuola, li insultano e li dicono di tutto e di piu'. Di solito li danno anche qualche schiaffo. Mi e' successo a volte di intervenire (onestamente lo faccio con molto timore, che non si sa mai come possono reagire). A me personalmente non e' mai successo niente di grave (qualche sputo l'ho beccato anch'io), ma ho sentito di almeno un ragazzo che avevano picchiato.

Non uso mai il cellulare quando ci sono anche i zingari nel pullman, cerco sempre di sedermi piu' lontano che posso da loro, e se questo non e' possibile, mi siedo con la schiena contro la finestra, cosi posso vedere tutto il pullman. E' sempre una situazione di allerta, anche se sono quasi sicuro che non mi succedera' niente, quasi.

Allora, traete voi stessi le vostre conclusioni perche' non saro' io a dirvi come vi dovete sentire. Il fatto sta che il consenso generale dei cittadini che usano quel pullman e' che sarebbe meglio se i zingari non ci fossero. Sinceramente e' molto difficile spiegare questa situazione e lo stato d'animo di qualcuno - che a differenza mia - non si puo' neanche minimamente difendere, sopratutto i ragazzi delle superiori o le femmine in generale.

Das ist so als wenn der im Gerichtssaal DNA Spuren seines Mandanten vorlegt, ein unterschriebenes Geständnis, CCTV Aufnahmen und Fingerabdrücke, um am Ende zu sagen: Mein Mandat war es nicht.

Dass es eine Mainstreammeinung gibt, welche die Presse allen einflößen will(und äußerst allergisch reagiert wenn dies nicht funktioniert) sah man noch einmal in aller Deutlichkeit im Ukrainekonflikt. Der Bürger wollte sich einfach nicht für dumm verkaufen lassen, also wurde er erst herabgewürdigt, dann auf heftigste zensiert und später als Teil einer bezahlten russischen Trollarmee gebrandmarkt.

Die Mainstreammedien scheiterten kläglich bei dem Versuch ihr Meinungsdiktat aufrecht zu erhalten, mitunter machten sie dem Postillion mit ihrer Berichterstattung Konkurrenz, in der Hoffnung jetzt müsse doch endlich mal jemand sehen wie böse und schlimm der Russe ist. Der Deutsche indes wollte nichts mehr davon hören.

Genau das selbe auch mit dem Bildungsplan zur Zwangssexualisierung. Damit sind die wenigsten glücklich, die Menschen würden sich wünschen es gebe auch dort eine Wahlfreiheit. Dennoch berichten die Massenmedien unisono wie toll doch Zwangssexualisierung ist, welche Vorteile sie hat etc. Alle die anderer Meinung sind werden wie immer als Nazis, fundamentalistische Christen oder Schwulenhasser gebrandtmarkt.

Ich selbst hatte mal auf einer Podiumsdiskussion zu dem Berliner Bildungsplan zur Zwangssexualisierung 2010 oder 11 mal gefragt wie es denn mit der wissenschaftlichen Grundlage für solchen Quatsch aussieht und man warf mir wirklich vor, ich würde nur versuchen das Projekt schlecht zu reden, weil ich Homosexuelle hasse. 

Genau hierin liegt das Problem dieses Meinungsdiktats. Man darf den Wahnsinn nicht in Frage stellen, ohne nicht schlimmer zu sein als Hitler. Selbst berechtigte Kritik wird immer in einen Topf geschmissen mit völlig unberechtigten Forderungen. 

Das geht durch alle Themen. Die Massenmedien geben eine Meinung vor und die meisten Dummen geben diese wieder. Da man keine wissenschaftlichen Argumente für seinen Schwachsinn hat, ist jeder der daran Kritik übt eben mit der Nazikeule zu bekämpfen.


Aber allein die Tatsache das der Autor sich für ""böse Links"" entschuldigt sagt alles.

Heh, after discussing with many Lithuanians today I really do wonder what *you* are being taught in school.

Returning to topic, that's what you can learn by checking every single census done in that city before Lithuanians occupied it in 1939 - they were done by Russians, Germans and Poles and all brought similar results, so we can assume there was no falsyfying results on a large scale.

&gt; Is it justified? Are putin's actions in crimea justified? Are they right? 

If Crimea was taken from Russia in January 2014 by Turkey and given to Ukraine, and then in late February 2014 Russians did their stealth invasion then maybe your comparison would be justified. Oh, and some very important to Russians city like St. Petersburg would have to be located in Crimea as well.

Tough luck though, you have to find some different analogy.

&gt;but poland held Vilnius for 20 fucking years.

Oh yeah, that 2% of Lithuanians in Wilno. I wonder what would happen if we considered every city with a 2% ethnic minority to be somehow ""occupied"".

&gt;Now that i think about it, you guys got everything you deserved in ww2.

Now that I think about it, you guys got everything you deserved during your 50 years of Soviet occupation. Feel even now?

&gt;But still, to many people in Vilnius (which is almost purely Lithuanian now

Congrats on successful colonisation. We did similarly on areas of former eastern Germany. 

And there are still 20% of Poles there. And when I was a few years ago, everyone seemed to understand Polish. Seems that even after 70 years not everything about Wilno was dissolved in Vilnius.

&gt;you are not welcome.
