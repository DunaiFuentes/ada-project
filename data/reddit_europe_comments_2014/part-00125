You're talking about a loss of influence in a single regulatory regime: Not any of the above to be specific.

Secondly to correct what you mention, namely: Influence, Cost of Membership and CAP:

* Influence: [Better off out of the EU -- Norwegian Centre Party clip explaining Norway influence via EEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8GpzDDurR8) &amp; [No Government By Fax. Norway Has Right To Veto](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsz7gIfALpU) quoting Norwegian politicians.

Comparing to the UK's so-called influence in the EU:

1. UK Percentage of the Vote in the Council of Ministers under QMV = 8.2% (down from 17 in 1973)
2. The Number and UK Percentage of the Vote in the European Parliament = 73/751 ; (down from 19%-9.7%)
3. Number and Percentage of UK appointed Commissioners = 1 (down from 2), 3.6 (%)
4. FOI documents reveal that, since records began in 1996, Britain has opposed 55 measures in the Council of Ministers, and been overruled 55 times ~ BusinessForBritain

Those are facts. We can also look at more facts (Switzerland is more successful at negotiating FTA's than the EU or the number of times the UK has successfully disputed 

* Cost comparison of the EEA vs EU memberships:

&gt;*""Norway only had to make a few changes to its laws in order to make its products eligible for the European Union marketplace. In 2009, the Norwegian Mission to the EU estimated that Norway’s total financial contribution linked to their EEA (European Economic Area) agreement is some 340 million Euros per year of which some 110 million Euros are contributions related to the participation in various EU programmes. However, this is a fraction of the gross annual cost that Britain must pay for EU membership which is now £18.5 billion, or £50 million a day.""*

* Powers not applicable to the EEA members that are applicable to the EU members (ie sovereignty):

* Common Agricultural Policy
* Common Fisheries Policy
* Foreign &amp; Security (Defence) Policies
* Justice &amp; Home Affairs Policies
* Customs Union
* Monetary Union (not applicable to the UK)

&gt;*You get an illusion of self-determination.*

If you read the above I think you can reconsider that conclusion.

Seeing how they lied about being in Crimea, and that we're talking about a former KGB who is now a politician, I see zero reason to think that Putin is telling the truth when he says Russia doesn't have troops in the eastern Ukraine already. So the question is, when will Western governments have to stop pretending that it's just Russian ""supporters"" but in actuality the Russian military that's stirring shit up in the East. 

Of course, the Russians have their own people convinced of this bogus nonsense as well. The old `they need our help! They're being oppressed!` they'll yell. They told the Czechoslovaks that in '68 as well.

The morale's or rights of the situation are not comparable however because the act of Union (between Ireland and the UK) happened in 1800 and the Crown of Ireland act in 1542, and Ireland had been invaded before that. Unless of course you mean to say the worlds morales have not moved on since then.

If we were living in the 1800 or 1500s both acts are just your run of the mill imperialism, looking at them in 2014 they are totally unacceptable and morally repugnant.

The situation in regarding the rights of the people living in the place is comparable I think. In Northern Ireland you have the ethnic Irish and then descendants of people who were placed their from the UK (this is probably a simplification), in Crimea you have the Tartars and the Ethnic Russians.

This situation is a tricky one because you have to decide whether the 'natives' get more of a say than the others, but the people there now are the descendants not the actual people who moved.

This situation is dealt with these days by the Geneva Convention wherein you may not move your people into territory that you are occupying or forcibly deport the people of that territory, of course the Geneva Convention did not exist back when the UK invaded Ireland, and I'm not sure if the USSR was a signatory of the Geneva Convention (and the specific article) but if they were they broke it when deporting Crimean tartars from Crimea in 1944.

true,Pwndbyautocorrect,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Which EU benefits ? How much is that valued ?

[This publication](http://marker.to/p2O0xD) states 3.5 million British jobs are linked, directly or indirectly, with EU trade.

&gt; Fiscal competition costs at least 36 billion €  in France.

That figure is highly debatable or misleading for several reasons:

* [it varies wildly from one estimate to the other](Fiscal competition costs at least 36 billion €  in France.)
* it includes money that is locateed in the British Virgin Islands, the [Cook Islands](http://taxjustice.blogspot.be/2013/12/cook-islands-trusts-poster-child-for.html), Monaco, [Singapore](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-singapore-banking-sector-is-a-tax-haven-that-now-faces-reform-a-930998.html), etc. which the EU (nor any country or institution except the tax havens themselves) can't do anything about as it's outside their juridiction. It's one thing to evade taxes in Luxemburg (or Switzerland, for that matter, which has been unusually cooperative in recent months/years) and another to do so with bank accounts in some Pacific Islands.

&gt; Overvalued euro (for France) costs around 0.3% of GDP  of growth.

From that same article:
    Le ministre s'est par ailleurs à nouveau félicité de la ""manifestation positive de confiance"" liée à cette appréciation. ""Il y a six mois l'euro était mort, maintenant l'euro est fort""

This implies France's borrowing rates and general investor confidence in its economy rely heavily upon the Euro. Another, weaker currency would make it less trustworthy and lack guarantees (e.g. those brought by rich countries such as Germany). Thus France's borrowing rates would rise, putting it even more in debt and hampering its growth.

&gt; It's very difficult to value the costs of social dumping  but you can see that the eurozone has a record unemployment rate , very low growth  (and no perspective of better days), and risks of deflation...

So what? Everytime there's a crisis we need a new currency and to leave the world's biggest integrated economic area? I disagree with your assumption that we have no perspective of better days: the global economy has restarted - although for now, it's mostly the U.S.A. pushing it forward - and states such as Greeece are now running primary budget surpluses, with unemployment on a [solid downwards trend](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/unemployment-rate), reaching [20%](http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/04/30/greece-sees-bigger-surplus-long-lasting-unemployment/) (still high but that was to be expected) by 2020. [Same goes for Spain](http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21600721-economy-improving-it-still-has-long-way-go-better-not-best): ""What saved Spain? The pledge in July 2012 by Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, to be a true lender of last resort removed immediate doubts about the euro’s survival."" Lastly, I very much doubt we'll see widespread deflation in the EU.

&gt; In the case of Switzerland it was because of overvaluation of the franc.

Overvalued? [Doesn't seem to be getting any better](https://fr.finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=EURCHF=X&amp;t=5y&amp;l=on&amp;z=l&amp;q=l&amp;c=). While models may consider the CHF not ""overvalued"", in the real world it doesn't seem to have weakened in the least.

&gt; It's also highly unlikely France would get terms as favorable as the Norwegian or Swiss ones

Why, you ask? First, those bilateral agreements were signed at a time where bilateral agreements were popular, as they were needed by the EU to expand its free trade potential. Nowadays, with so many countries covered by the EU free trade system, the EU holds much more bargaining power. Since a French exit would destabilise the EU, it can't be expected to favor French interests in negotiations, especially since they've voiced their [""no cherry-picking"" stance against the UK](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jan/23/david-cameron-europe-international-reaction). I'll say it again: it would be foolish to expect conditions as favorable as those offered by the EU, as it would contradict their ""no à la carte Europe"" stance. If there's one thing the EU can't back down from, it's this.

&gt; Why should France have different regulations ? Are EU regulations used as a way of protectionism or are they really justified ?

Because countries with different legal systems **inevitably** end up with (ever so slightly) different regulations, making manufacturers encur additional costs. An example can be found in the publication I linked to earlier, quoting the 1987 European Court of Justice ruling on the German beer market (relating to the beer's purity) that found local regulations incompatible with EU free trade laws. As a result, local regulations were overturned, opening up the market for other beer producers from EU countries. The only way for France to avoid having a different set of regulations would be to peg their laws to the EU's, which would be somewhat ironic, considering an EU exit would be sold as ""muh sovereignty"". That simply wouldn't fly.

EU regulations are often very sensible and consumer-oriented (e.g. roaming costs) compared to many other (big) markets. I'm not sure why you would mention protectionism, as all EU countries share those regulations and can thus export to other members very easily. Those same regulations are also quite accessible to foreign producers and match the quality and safety European consumers rightly expect from the products available to them.

&gt; Why more costs and not less ? For example, chicken or meat costs less in the US because they have less strict regulations.

So you're arguing for less consumer-oriented regulations? You would like France to lower its safety standards to the United States'? You realise that would be serving the chicken/meat producers' interests, not the people's, right? The last thing France needs is more entitled farmers looking for privileges. Their influence on French society is already way too big compared to other member states.

&gt; Anyway, with TTIP, regulations will be imposed by the US so I don't see what can be gained by staying in the EU.

""Let's just dismiss everything the EU has ever done for consumers by citing an obscure trade pact that's not even done being negotiated yet!"". 
That's ridiculous scaremongering. Don't judge a treaty that's being negotiated behind closed doors as you don't have all the information. This leads to prejudice and stupid assumptions. Do you seriously think European negotiators are such pushovers? Remember, the U.S. agricultural (read: GMO) industry is still butthurt to this day because of the EU's food regulations (which I support, as I fear we'd end up with more ""vache folle"" crises without strict rules).

&gt; Except the euro cannot survive without economic integration. And that integration means lowering salaries in France, raising taxes in Luxembourg, regulating the finance in the UK, reducing Germany's trade surplus etc. etc.

While I agree taxes in Luxemburg should be brought to more European levels, economic integration doesn't mean ""lowering salaries in France"" or ""reducing Germany's trade surplus"".

* If French salaries are deemed too high by the French government, it will take measures to reduce it to increase employment. It doesn't go much further than that. That has nothing to do with the EU as it'd happen in a global economy, regardless of EU membership.

* Germany's exports are doing well, helping its trade surplus. If other countries can achieve the same, good for them, but why do you think one should be punished for success? If your intention is to quote ""mini-jobs"" wages, remember that this isn't the only thing driving German exports. Who would want to buy a French car instead of a German one for the same price? Very few people would. German exports are known for quality and reliability. Whether that is true or not, their car exports to China have been remarkable, even more so than French wine exports (which have been doing well in the last few years).",0,1399068059,null,0,false,0,ch82yll,t3_24fx4d,t1_ch82yll,t1_ch7y2v0,null,1433625376,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt; What power do we have right now ? Any example ?


We're 500 million, with many of us originating from some of the world's wealthiest countries, which is why the EU is always being sought out for all kinds of free trade agreements by countries like the U.S.A, India, South Korea and so on. I find it hilarious that while the EU is constantly being criticised for the influence lobbyists hold over its system, you're essentially saying European companies can't make their voice heard in free trade negotiations.


&gt; Remember what was the problem with Argentina ? Its currency was aligned with the dollar. Because common currencies do not work for different economies with no integration.

Argentina's problem (right NOW) is that it [devalues, devalues, devalues its currency](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/02/04-argentina-currency-devaluation-vuletin) even further every time their flawed economic policies go wrong, hoping for that to magically make their companies export products by the million.

&gt; Why do Nobel prize winners like Krugman, Stiglitz, Sen, Allais, or Friedman

What ""Nobel prize winners"" say may matter to laymen, but what Krugman really does is politics, not economics. He is simply peddling the typically American economic rhetoric (i.e. Keynesian economics). None of his pieces of ""advice"" have been listened to by European countries, and [those that didn't have done well](http://www.slate.fr/tribune/80449/paul-krugman-erreur-europe) (e.g. Baltic countries). He is also a great proponent of the broken window fallacy, among other things. Nobel prize winners usually don't influence governments' decisions much.

Oh and I'd also like to add that Krugman sports an incredibly bad attitude when he's trying to argue a point. He frequently insults and demeans people who dare doubt his ideas and... calls them trolls. I swear, it's sometimes hard to believe this guy is serious.

I don't think there is an easy answer. What I've heard as explanation was that it came to distance yourselves from the ""evil atheist commies"". 

&gt;I constantly hear about some group picketing a funeral of a gay person or some politician saying If you're not a conservative christian you hate America.

The argumentation of our Conservatives towards gays is very different. We still don't have gay marriage, but they justify it by saying we need to strengthen marriage and family while clarifying that they mean no disrepect towards gays.
Openly condemning gays is almost unthinkable, I guess it would be like speaking about ""these stupid niggers"" in the US.

&gt;How is this handled in the media in Europe? Do you hear about the crazy American politics or do you not concern yourself with such nonsense and only stick to the facts?

America is certainly relevant enough to make it in our news but I wouldn't say we concern ourselves that much about your internal matters. We followed your presidental election but otherwise it's more about your external matters, your relation to us, your wars or NSA for example.

&gt;Also how are the more extreme political parties handled? Are they allowed equal airtime and equal platform or do you write them off as loonies?

Depends, most parties and people would like to see the Neonazi party banned. Other than that we don't really have an extremist party that gets any media attention or votes. You won't even see ads from most of them because you need 1%+ in the elections for public sponsorship.
The Party of Bible-abiding Christians got 0.04% at the last federal elections.

Fox News is sometimes shown on the media and its portrayed as being very right wing and very biased. Thats really all a typical French person sees of American far right

In France the most extreme political party is probably the Front National, which is at the moment likely the 2nd largest party in France.. so as you can tell its doing great. They are anti-EU, anti Immigration, want strong securtiy, and are anti-globalization. Its not that pro-Christian though, infact they are pro-Secularism in order to combat making exceptions to Muslims (such as having to provide Muslim people with Halal food, or allowing  swimming pools that have seperate sections for men and women)

There are also ""loonies"" that are less institutionalized than the Front National. This would be at the moment probably Civitas which is a very traditional catholic group that does protests. They were out in numbers during the anti-gay marriage protests and they have very extreme catholic views. Most people just think they are wierd extreme catholics.

And in total I would say all political ideals are allowed equal platform. For the general election, each candidate is guaranteed equal tv time. I remember last election there was some guy whose platform was based 90% on basing our economy to do space travel. That France setting up a base on the moon will make the country super rich.

true,chodechugging,ROMA,Romania,"Even though there's no one on reddit that hates Russia and Russians more than I do, I have to say that most of the claims they made about Romania, except the nonsense about nuclear missiles, are mostly true. 

Joining the EU has had little positive effect on Romania. Apart from small things like cheaper food (yes, it's a very small thing from where we're sitting right now), joining the EU has done next to nothing as far as vital things like infrastructure, rule of law, healthcare, defense, political climate, disavowing communism and especially people's mentality. I'd even argue it has actively hurt progress in those areas.

* Highways are just as much of an abstract concept as they were in the 90s, roads in general are just as bad. Railroads are worse than they were before WW2. There have been no efforts to do anything about flooding, or buying crop irrigation systems, literally nothing has been done since the 90s.

* Gypsies still feel like they own the place, even the most minute level of organized crime has yet to be stamped out. ""Small"" crimes like assault or burglary go unpunished at an alarming rate. No initiative has been taken, on Europe's side or ours, to make laws relating to self-defense or home invasion more permissive towards the would be victim. Or to give regular civilians the possibility to legally own fire arms or other weapons. Crime rates going down since the 90s had nothing to do with the EU. It naturally went down in Serbia or Albania at a similar rate.

* At the higher levels, jailing supposed corrupt officials with very questionable methodology and shady trials is useless as long as the person coordinating the ""justice system"" is a man with 3 files/cases that could even send Obama to life in prison instantly. Even if he was squeaky clean, it would still be useless since 90% of the high level arrests and convictions are politically motivated. Even if they weren't, the officials in question would be replaced by new ones within days since corruption starts at the bottom and things like bribery are so ingrained in the average Romania's mind that unless you can fill the *entire administrative landscape* with saintly characters like Ion Antonescu, corruption will continue to thrive. By the way, EU funds are still untouched. Don't you find it at least a bit odd that a president who literally had no opposition since 2007-2008, had complete freedom to remove adversaries at will, had EU's support, 7 secret services and like 10 ""anti-corruption institutions"" has not dared to touch EU funds and put EU money in what is essentially his own system? For 7 years? So much so that Romania is a net contributor. I wonder why. Corruption is the same as it was in the 90s. The only difference is it's now fully institutionalized. In the 90s it was a natural reaction to a power vacuum. Now corruption is *in* power. 

* Hospitals are particularly awful. Their lack of gear was understandable in the 90s, when there was no money and no relations with the west. There simply is no excuse for their current lack of equipment. If you're a fan of Basescu's ""justice system"" ask yourself when was the last time a health care union figurehead was sentenced for anything. Their protection of known butchers and murderers who masquerade as doctors should be enough for the convictions to flow freely. Where's the ""independent justice system"" now? You're just as likely to be maimed or die due to neglect in a hospital as you were in the 90s. No progress had been made there either.

* I don't think I need to make too many comments about our military. Though I suppose there's a certain metaphysical romanticism in surviving outnumbered and outgunned throughout 2000 years of history. But still, EU and NATO should've been 100 times more strict when it comes to their members' military. There should straight up be a law saying all members should have this many fighter jets and that many tanks. No reference to a percentage of the GDP or anything like that. Straight up you need to have at least this many missiles if you want to be in the EU or NATO. A *massive* failure on their part. Hard mandatory arming of the eastern border should have been a priority. This is immediately relevant to the current war in Ukraine.    

* Our political landscape is looking extremely bleak, perhaps more so than ever after '89. Who are you going to vote for president this year? I don't know either. I think even the most zealous Basescu disciple has to admit his effect on the political landscape has been nothing short of devastating. He hasn't even groomed anyone to be his successor. Even people in ""his party"" have only dared to appear as his humble servant or not appear at all. Ponta and Antonescu won't get 10 votes between them and there's literally no one else that anyone would want to vote for. The election might even be invalidated due to a low turnout rate. Having no viable presidential candidates in a semi-presidential republic while there's a war going on next door usually brings drastic things about. Maybe the EU anointing vassals and bailing them out of impeachment might not have been the best idea? 

* I'm still waiting for communism to be disavowed. I'm still waiting for people who represented the Socialist Republic of Romania at Antwerp to be blacklisted from the political scene, tried and convicted. I'm still waiting for 1 fucking political prisoner to be decorated. I'm still waiting for gulag wardens to be at least blacklisted from working in schools and to eventually die by firing squad. I think even that inane and pitiful speech that someone was going to make in Brussels a few years ago, something like *guys communism was like kinda bad*, was shot down by France. Lots of progress right there.

All of this ties into people's mentality. It never changed for the better since '89. It's still appallingly solipsist, self-centered, primitive, short-sighted, apathetic, etc. The only difference is most of these traits have been exacerbated and encouraged by the EU's open borders, austerity and ""entrepreneurial spirit"". Fuck me, the brain drain alone is enough to safely say joining the EU has had a devastating effect on Romania. 

I don't know about 30 minutes, but if something doesn't change in the next couple of months we're gonna be in a world of shit.

* Diversification - getting more sources of natural gas
* Unified buying price for russian gas for EU as whole

the latter being the new aspect, its rather optimistic that the final russian price would be the one that is currently the lowest one out of all countries.

Also I am not so certain that diversification would lower the price much if anything. People could do math before whole ukraine thing. If it would be worth investing in to other sources they would probably do it already. But the current idea of diversification is because of politics, because we dont want to be heavily dependent on russia. And ideas like these usually carry extra costs because the reward is not lower price, but more independence, though maybe there are some good deals... I dunno really...

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ok, your biggest problem are the Ukrainian nationalists (the biggest problems are Russians with guns but you can't do much about that so let's look at something that you can), remember that Putin still needs an excuse for invading (he needs a mass killing so that even world and citizens of EU and USA accept the invasion as necessary). So since there are probably 10 fools who will go on rampage in Ukraine (it's not like every individual in the nation is sane no matter what nation is that, even Norway had Breivik...) so there needs to be a guarantee that there would be no attacks and that all of the attackers would be prosecuted/sent to Russia (remember that there will always be civilian human shields in situations like this so attacking is out of question in these situations). There will be problem with Right sector since they would always push their democratic rights but seriously push them out, don't know how will you do it, they will make things much worse (they are on the leash by the USA now but I am not sure about what USA plans are). Also fuck OEBS, they are just war profiteers.

Now there will always be provocations by the Russians and that is a big problem (these are the Russian fools or maybe sent by Putin, doesn't really matter), so the big question will be how to save Ukrainians (we had this problem with Srebrenica and generally Kosovo, but please don't fix that the way we did that), maybe call in the Russians but I don't believe Russians alone so it would be better to call international community together with Russians (and please don't call the Dutch or French, they wouldn't even keep the goats from being stolen).

If everything up goes right then comes the negotiation. That's how I see the situation.

Edit: I know that inviting international community together with Russians seems like bad idea and it is bad idea because they don't give a fuck about Ukrainians and it will probably not work (also it looks like the loss of the sovereignty, that's how the WW1 started and I would probably say ""Fuck them, let's fight!"" as a Serb, but fuck it, don't know what to do) but I base the idea on that in this age there are a lot of cameras and everyone owns one so they will have to be good or else there would be no general support of the situation and I seriously hope that we are more smarter than the generations before us but looking at /r/europe I am not so sure.",0,1399075162,null,0,1399075838,0,ch85qwt,t3_24jmij,t1_ch85qwt,t1_ch82fj1,null,1433626690,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

And what has been recovered during communism was lost after '89. It took over 10 years for our GDP to climb back to its '89 value.

The Union has hardly had the massive negative impact. If anything, it was greatly positive, but things like brain drain are definitely an unwanted side effect. But gypsies becoming a growing problem ever since '07, as they claimed? Bitch please, if anything we're weeding out the lazy of the lower class (incl. gypsies), with their dream of living a better life in the West. Unemployment has went down not just because of foreign investment, but because people who were jobless by choice thought that moving westward would magically make life better for them.

As far as the political landscape looking bleak - that's precisely the fault of, us, the people and our indifference. It's sad to know the majority are completely uninformed and will most likely vote for whoever gives them a rusty bucket, or for whoever looks most handsome. Not to mention certain parties having certain regions in a chokehold through ""local barons"". It's bad, but uninvolvement in the political scene will not make it change.

And I still beg to differ about the 30 minute thing. As long as there's even one man putting up a fight, we're not out of the fight. But yes, it's stupidly optimistic for us to expect to hold off any Russian attack for any significant amount of time. Conventionally, without outside support, we'd hold up a week, tops.

true,umbigo,UNSA,United States of America,"I studied abroad in the Faroe Islands for a year in high school. It has a reputation as kind of a conservative, religious place, especially for a Nordic country. A couple of my teachers (including the biology one, although she taught evolution in class) were creationists and I met plenty of religious people. I encountered more American evangelical material (Left Behind books and such) than I probably would have in Denmark. The Faroese abortion law is stricter than Denmark's. I think it is (or was) illegal to buy porn (magazines) there, but hey, same in secular, progressive Iceland. I think smoking pot might be more of a taboo there than in the States, but that's only an impression I got from one person, so who knows? Maybe not. Apparently, [most people](http://www.vmf.fo/Default.aspx?ID=1835&amp;PID=6966&amp;NewsID=51480&amp;Action=1) support gay marriage there now.

While it's clear that America is more socially conservative and religious than much of (Western and some parts of Central) Europe, I wouldn't really say that goofy, ostentatious billboards are the best /only signs of conservatism. 80 percent of Czechs may say that homosexuality is acceptable, but [only thirty percent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_Czech_Republic#Public_opinion) of them approve of gay adoption. Support for gay adoption is also lower than support for gay marriage in France and Portugal (which has gay marriage, but not joint adoption). It's the exact opposite here (and in Brazil). Old world/new world thing? #freeassociation

Again, while I don't deny we're generally more conservative over here, I think Europeans sometimes have a distorted view of what life over here is like. I'm fine as a gay atheist in a moderately conservative part of the country. I also don't think we're more conservative than Poland or Greece (not that either country is *that* bad, in the grand scheme of things).",0,1399077013,null,0,false,0,ch86fgf,t3_24knco,t1_ch86fgf,t3_24knco,null,1433627012,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

For 7 years? So much so that Romania is a net contributor. I wonder why. Corruption is the same as it was in the 90s. The only difference is it's now fully institutionalized.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"All are progressing. Galileo is starting with great technology off the bat because it is a new system. GPS is being upgraded with GPS-III Satellites, the first of which go up in 2015. They are backwards compatible so nobody has to worry about losing functionality of their devices. The new GPS-III satellites will offer more accurate and faster results (likely similar to Galileo, but they're not operational yet). 

2-way functionality is expected to be in GPS-III, similar to Galileo, but that has not been confirmed yet. That would allow any smartphone to be a emergency beacon. Essentially making the SARSAT constellation obsolete (from what I can tell). That in itself is a pretty cool project, one of the few the West (incl. US) and the USSR collaborated on. 

Russia is launching an upgraded GLONASS-K. The new capability is supposed to be ""double"" the old GLONASS system's capability, but no specifics are given. Its also unclear when the new K system is supposed to be fully operational. 

China is developing Beidou. It was speculated it would be dropping Beidou for civilian use when it joined the EU Galileo program. It was eventually disinvited from the Galileo, but the return of its investment of €230 million was delayed (not sure if they got it back). After that it went full steam ahead developing Beidou, with global coverage planned by 2020. The capabilities are unclear though. 

India is developing a regional positioning system, but it isn't really a competitor on the global scale. 

Personally I dont see some of these gaining wide acceptance globally even if the technology is good, namely China and Russia's systems. GLONASS has been around for some time, but was only integrated in iPhones and the like when Russia made it mandatory for the Russian market. That is likely how users will be gained, instead of organically in my opinion.

They do all national pride demonstrations like having pictures of Spitfire planes as the backdrop to their speeches and whatnot.
 
On the other hand, we also have the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). These guys are a little less extreme in their views, but are generally regarded as closet racists and general bigots. Their policies basically revolve around removing the UK from the EU, kicking out immigrants, and closing the borders. They have been making the news quite a lot lately, for better or for worse- they seem to be garnering a worrying amount of votes, despite the amount of satire you see thrown around the internet on them.

However- neither of these parties have particularly strong ties to religion, their attitudes seem to be founded solely in politics, which is not like the US. UK politics does a pretty good job of keeping religion out of the picture, which I have a great deal of time for.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"Realistically, if the UK left, there would be two possible outcomes. One would be that the UK would remain in the Single Market, but still being subject to EU regulation would defeat the purpose.  
The other would be that there would be a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. In that case, existing trade links would initially persist, because the relevant regulations would still be in place and presumably certifications for existing products would be grandfathered. As regulations would change in both the UK and the EU over time, and therefore mutual compliance could no longer be taken for granted, trade would slowly decline. New trade links would become more difficult as lawyers and engineers would have to ensure compliance on the importing side, products would have to go through certification (e.g., CE mark), certificates and licenses from the other side would no longer be mutually recognized, and importers would have to keep track of changing regulations to ensure the products or components they import are still compliant. All of this costs time and money, which adds to the cost even if there aren't any tariffs, so companies would prefer trading partners from within their respective economic zone instead of dealing with the overhead that would come with importing from the outside -- but if you need a specialized product, that's not always possible.

Anyway, I had added the qualifier about nothing else changing in brackets for this very reason. :)

true,RomeVacationTips,null,null,"Hey there,

Thanks for contacting me and alerting me to these questions. Happy to answer them. I run a website offering [free independent advice for visitors to Rome](http://romevacationtips.com), especially first-time visitors. Here are my answers to your questions:

**Purchasing a SIM card:**

Both Wind and Tim offer *illimitato* (unlimited) SIM data deals, which are actually somewhat restrictive: they usually offer you 1Gb per month (or occasionally 2Gb) at full 3G speed, but then throttle your data down to GPRS speeds after that, which sucks and is almost useless unless you're in an emergency, or if you only want to leave it on so your email can arrive in the background. The best deal we have found so far is the [All Inclusive Wind Unlimited
Special Edition](http://www.wind.it/it/privati/tariffe_e_opzioni/ricaricabile/chiamate_messaggi_e_internet/all_inclusive_wind_unlimited_special_edition/), which gives you 1Gb at full speed for €10. You can top up at Wind stores (though there's usually a long wait to do so) or at tobacconists and some bars (in Rome, bar = café).

Also if you are using Google Maps on your smartphone for getting around, you can download maps for offline use by typing ""OK maps"" into the search bar of the app.

That said, many parts of central Rome offer [Digit Roma](https://digitroma.nuvolaitpeoplelinked.it) free WiFi. To access this you will need to register using your Italian cellphone number, after which you will be sent a password, and after that it's easily accessible, though you will have to log on via a browser every time (Chrome for mobile gives you the option of saving these details).

To get a SIM, it is HIGHLY recommended that you do this at the airport when you arrive. As with many things in Italy, interpretations of the rules can depend on the individual you deal with, and although visitors can indeed get a SIM card with a passport and address, many of the stores in the city do not know this, and may not be able to communicate with you. Whereas the stores at the airports are used to dealing with travellers, and should be able to fix you up easily. If you arrive at a time when the phone stores at the airport are shut or otherwise unavailable, try the stores in Termini Station, or failing that the many phone stores in Chinatown (the area around Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, a couple of minutes' walk south of Termini) where the staff can often be a bit more flexible. 

**Transport ticket**

You have done your research well: yes, the monthly card (which is actually referred to as a *tessera mensile* [TESS-err-ah men-SEAL-eh]) is the best public transport deal available, by an enormous margin. 

[Transport tickets in Rome](http://romevacationtips.com/how-to-use-romes-public-transport/) cover the Metro, buses, trams, and some extra-urban train and bus services. To break down the options:

A standard single-use transport ticket, available from machines at all Metro stations, costs €1.50 and works for 100 minutes (though they only allow you to make one Metro journey - you can change Metro trains as often as you want, but not leave the Metro network then return, though you can access any other means of transport as many times as you want during the time). Note that these machines only give a maximum of €6 in change, so use coins or small denomination bills or you might lose out.

A daily ticket from a machine costs €6. To make this cheaper than four 100 minute tickets it means that in one day you would have to take five journeys outside a period spanning 500 minutes, or just over 8 hours. Not recommended unless you're using the Metro several times.

A weekly ticket from a machine, at €24, is even worse value, meaning you'd have to take 17 complete journeys during the week to justify the expenditure. That said, you may feel it's worth the 'utility' expense of not having to worry about buying more tickets all the time. Note that this and the day pass expire at midnight on the expiry day.

For a mere €11 more than the weekly ticket, though, the *tessera mensile* allows you unlimited travel for an entire month. But hey this is Rome, so nothing's 100% straightforward: they are calendar-dependent. They only work from the 1st of the month to midnight on the last day. If you buy one after the last two weeks of the calendar month they will work out as less cost-efficient than the other options above. 

If you're arriving in the right time period, however, you can buy a *tessera mensile* at any train station that has a ticket office - Trastevere, Piramide, Termini, Flaminio, etc., or you can buy them at most [tobacconists](http://romevacationtips.com/how-to-buy-cigarettes-in-italy/). 

**Travelling outside of Rome**

The question is really too broad to answer well here. You can get to Florence within 3 hours, Naples in less than 2. There are many *extraurbano* commuter train services that can bring you (slowly) to Tivoli, Ostiense, Viterbo, various beaches, and many other interesting places around Rome. Suffice it to say that yes, your options are many. Note for *extraurbano* services, you can't use your Rome transport ticket, though it will work for *urbano*.

**Tipping waiters**

Tips are not expected, but are of course gratefully appreciated when they occur. In tourist traps, especially those frequented by Americans, a certain expectation has arisen, but in truly local places there is no expectation of tipping from either customers or waitstaff. We don't discourage doing it, but it's an oddity when it happens, and if you don't tip or only round up you won't be scorned in any way. Read more here: [How much should I tip in Rome?](http://romevacationtips.com/tipping/).

**Recommendations in Trastevere**

Trastevere is a seriously quaint neighborhood, though parts of it are overrun with tourists these days and it's gotten fairly gentrified. The far southern part of the district where you're staying is definitely more 'real Rome', though less aesthetically pleasing. If you want to check out a couple of areas within walking distance that aren't yet totally overwhelmed by tourism, instead walk across the river and head to the amazing traditional Roman restaurants and delis in Testaccio, particularly those embedded in Monte Testaccio (a hill made entirely of Roman amphorae) or hop on the Metro to the communist neighborhood of Garbatella, where you'll find a robust and welcoming culture, with some genuine, solid eateries, or stroll via Isola Tiberina (Tiber Island) to the amazing kosher restaurants of the oldest Jewish ghetto in the world. Try the *carciofi alla judea* (Jewish artichokes), which are amazing.

Given the amount of time at your disposal, I don't think there is any need to recommend too many other things, though I do have some specific recommendations in Trastevere if you're into history. The Basilica of San Crisogono, which most people walk past without looking at, is built on top of a 4th century church that is largely untouched, and you can go down into it and feel like Indiana Jones for a mere €2 donation. The church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, which is built atop a Roman apartment building, which you can visit too, has a strange but beautiful sculpture by Maderno of the martyred saint Cecilia, commissioned at short notice when her perfectly-preserved body was exhumed more than a thousand years after her death (according to legend anyway). Santa Maria in Trastevere is also interesting for its construction using recycled Roman pillars, and its beautiful mosaics.

**Any recommendations for places I should check out in the rest of Rome too?**

Again there are so many options it's impossible to list them all. I'll share my personal favorites though:

If you want an unusual tour that shows you how most Romans actually live - in the suburbs - follow my [Via Flaminia Antica](http://romevacationtips.com/off-the-beaten-track-to-see-the-beaten-track-via-flaminia-antica/) self-guided tour. 

Meanwhile going from the famous catacombs to the far end of the Via Appia Antica near Ciampino Airport is a fantastic two/three-hour hike (there and back) walking through fields on an actual Roman road lined with tombs. The nearby Parco degli Acquedotti has original aqueducts, some of which still carry mountain springwater into the city to the many [nasoni](http://romevacationtips.com/dont-buy-water-in-rome/) drinking fountains in the streets.

Another underground marvel is the Basilica di San Clemente, near the Colosseum, which descends not only into the 4th century church it was built on, but one level further down into an actual 1st-century Roman street, part of the gladiators' barracks, and a Mithraen temple and Christian shrine. If there was one ancient attraction I would recommend above all others, it is this one - though it's not for the claustrophobic.

**Shopping recommendations**

If you're looking to avoid the usual tourist tat, for gifts of food head to the local chain supermarkets. They often have inexpensive gift deals (e.g. a set of four espresso cups and a stovetop coffee machine for €10, as opposed to €50 in the tourist shops), as well as things like unusual pasta shapes, small bottles of truffle oil, genuine parmigiano, pecorino romano, pesto genovese and so on, for way less the price offered in tourist shops. For really weird and wonderful fresh food gifts, try the market near Circo Massimo, or the expensive but interesting food chain called Castroni. 

Final bit of advice: while the city is very safe, pickpockets can be a problem, but if you [follow these tips](http://romevacationtips.com/avoid-pickpocketed-rome/) you should be able to avoid having your vacation seriously inconvenienced.

* Though the Roma Pass gives you access to the Galleria Borghese (Villa Borghese is the park that surrounds it, and is free to enter), you absolutely must [book in advance](http://www.galleriaborghese.it/borghese/en/einfo.htm) or you will not be able to get in. I recommend you do this over the phone to explain you will be using the Pass.

* Secondly, though the Colosseum and Forum are administered together, they're counted as separate attractions by the Roma Pass, so leaving the Forum and entering the Colosseum will subtract two  attractions from your two free entries. 

* Finally, be aware that since the Vatican is a separate country, the Roma Pass does not count there.

* The best Italian teams compete in the ""Serie A"", which is the national top tier like Premier League in England, Bundesliga in Germany, Ligue 1 in France, etc. The prize for winning this championship is called ""scudetto"".
* The traditionally strongest- and most supported- teams are Juventus, from Turin, and AC Milan and Internazionale, both from Milan (usually called Milan and Inter). Juventus has won more national championships than the other two, and is the most supported team: however, they have a fierce rivalry with pretty much any other club. They usually have the strongest Italian players in their roster, while Inter has a nearly 100% foreigners team. AC Milan has been successful in Europe, as they are the overall 2nd team with most Champions League cups won. Both Milan teams have been struggling in recent seasons, while Juventus has dominated the last three Serie A seasons.
* Other teams worth mentioning are: Napoli from Naples, Fiorentina from Florence, Roma and Lazio from Rome. These teams have won a limited number of trophies in their career, but are always a dangerous opponents and enjoy a limited support outside their home cities. Most other teams, both in Serie A and in lower tiers, only enjoy hometown-wide support.
* As regards the Italian national team: they are usually one of the strongest teams in the world, having won four World Cups, the most recent in 2006. The South Africa 2010 WC was a complete disaster though, as they were eliminated from the group stage by losing against Slovakia (and drawing vs. Paraguay and New Zealand). They are nicknamed the ""Azzurri"" (""light blues"") because of their jerseys' color. The coach is Cesare Prandelli. Some players worth mentioning are: 
* Gianluigi Buffon, the goalkeeper and captain, plays for Juventus. He isn't really a likeable person (at least in my opinion), but is one of the best GKs in the world despite not being very young anymore.
* Mario Balotelli, the striker and current star, who plays for AC Milan. Balotelli is a very talented player, but has always had many temper problems. Sadly, he has often been the target of racist chants from supporters, as he is one of the first black players to play with our NT.
* Andrea Pirlo from Juventus, despite his age he is a valuable member of the midfield and is great at set pieces- free kicks, corner kicks and penalties.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt;  I would assume the US republican party would not do so well in Europe considering how far right they are.

They wouldn't, but you have to keep the FPTP system in the US in mind. This affects voting strategy, and therefore political strategy. Election systems in Europe differ, but I'll take Germany as an example here because I know it best and proportional representation is fairly common in Europe.

FPTP ensures that there effectively are only two parties, so you vote for a party because they either come closest to your political convictions, or because you just hate the other guys. This makes discrediting the other party a viable political strategy. In Germany/Europe, discrediting *a* party comes at the risk of appearing crazy yourself, and this might put off voters who would have normally voted for you if you went over the top, since they might find their opinions represented in another party as well, or were somewhere in between to begin with. There's a significant overlap in economic policies between CDU and FDP, for example, or an overlap in social policies between SPD and the Greens. But in the US, a secular or moderate conservative will still vote for the Republicans even if they go all fundamentalist Christian on the Democrats, because the Republicans would still be much closer to her/him in the relevant political areas (""they may be crazy, but they're *my* crazies""). In short, discrediting *the* (only) political opponent is a viable strategy in the US.

true,trycatch1,RUSS,Russia,"They didn't just took over Ukrainian institutions, they killed people -- that's why Ukrainians were so angry. Yesterday 200-300 of them attacked peaceful rally of ultras of Metallist (Kharkov),  Chernomorets (Odessa) and Euromaidan activists. (Note that it's not normal -- for example, nobody attacked pro-Russian rallies in Odessa on 1 May.) Pro-Russians were armed with bates, chains, military helmets, (presumably) airguns and _firearms_. **5 Ukrainians were shot dead.** Police sided with pro-Russians, doing nothing to disarm them: https://imgur.com/a/Q5aaw (notice the same red armbands). Ukrainians greatly outnumbered pro-Russians, they started to make Molotovs and dismantle the road for stones, stormed their barricades and pushed them back. Then Ukrainians went to the pro-Russian camp on Kulikovo, but the tents were empty -- pro-Russians already left them trying to hide in the seized trade-union building. Pro-Ukrainians attacked the building, pro-Russians were shooting in attackers, it seems that Ukrainian side also had firearms (or airguns?) at this point. Both sides threw Molotovs. The building was set on fire. When pro-Ukrainians realised the danger for separatists, they tried to save them [throwing ropes](https://imgur.com/SjKdW25), [moving constructions from the scene to the building](https://imgur.com/pGaonux), etc.

Attack on peaceful rally was a well-planned provocation by pro-Russians, it wasn't some spontaneous clash.

true,littlea1991,null,null,"&gt;What is coffee consumption like in germany? How do you guys typically serve your coffee?   
  
If you just order regular coffee, you mostly have to add the Milk for yourself. Or atleast say it, that you want it with Milk.  
  
&gt;Some websites said it was not socially acceptable to be very drunk in public. Is this true?  
  
it depends, if you go out at Friday Nights in a City. You often will see drunken People in Public. Also contary in America, you wont get stopped by the Police. If you drink Beer in Public. Just try to be discrete ;) just for starters, [germany has the laxest Alcohol Laws in the World.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_law#Germany) and the legal drinking age somewhat blurried.But you can get Beer and wine already, at 16. So you are good to go ;) if you want to know more about drinking. [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_laws_in_Germany) is a good place to start.                              
  
&gt;I read that watching TV shows in a foreign language is a good way to increase your comprehension. What German shows on Netflix would you recommend?  
  
maybe [This Guide](http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/german/guide/facts.shtml) from the BBC will help you. Watching German TV wont help much. Since the younger generations dont watch TV anymore, they cant really talk about this topic. Also most germans can speak english, so communications shouldnt be a big problem. But its always nice to hear someone, learning the language. But if you want to learn the Basics really Quickly. [Babbel](http://www.babbel.com/?locale=en) is a good place to start to. They even have [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.babbel.mobile.android.de) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/learn-german-with-babbel/id477151877?mt=8) Apps. Which i find, for learning. On the Go really usefull.  
  
&gt;How is meat typically cooked? (Mean rare, well done ect.)  
  
This completly depends on the Restaurant, that you are going to. The best thing to do, is just ask what you want. But generally we like our Meats good cooked. and not rare. But again, this depends.  
  
&gt;What is one thing I should try in Germany that I probably couldn't do anywhere else?  
  
I dont know, if you and your Family are the ""we just want to sightsee the City"" type. Or are rather the ""Explorer"" type. Bavaria is big and probably one of the best things to do. Outside of generally Sightseeing, is [visiting the Alps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Alps), its just a great view from there. And most big Mountains have lifts that take you to the Top ;) Also german has a vast amount of Breads and different types of it, maybe you like that, too.  
besides that in Bavaria there are many many [Castles](http://www.schloesser.bayern.de/englisch/palace/index.htm) to visit if you want. Of course [Neuschwanstein Castle](http://www.schloesser.bayern.de/englisch/palace/objects/neuschw.htm) is the most known one. And you will see hords of tourist going there.  
Just try to [familiarize](http://www.bavaria.by/) yourself with Bavaria and the Area you are residing in.  
  
  
  
P.S. Just one last thing. Germany has a very very good public Transport System. You mostly can travel distances with Buses or if you are in a City. The [Stadtbahn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadtbahn) will mostly get you, to your destination. Generally it is good to know which [Public Transport association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_transport_associations) or in german. ""Verkehrsbetrieb"" is running your areas. So you can look up on theyre website theyre tiket pricing. and also check where and when you have to be on the Station.  
In Munich and its sorroundings for example, its the [MVV](http://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/homepage/index.html) you see right on theyre website a Journey Planer, and also a section for pricing. Just google for the Public Transport association in your Area. The wiki page, will help you to find the one.  
Also all above that, there is an important difference. These Public Transport association, are just operating in **certain Areas** if you have to travel larger disctances. [Deutsche Bahn](http://www.bahn.de/i/view/DEU/en/index.shtml) is your friend and helper for that ;)  
since the pricing structure, sometimes there is a bit confusing. The best thing you can do, is to **ask someone at the Information Center** in nearly every bigger Rail station. They will guide you, and help to clarify where you have to go.

Now, 2 weeks is roughly equivalent with 4% GDP. Additionally, the state employees received the so called ""13th salary"", which is a kind of bonus at the end of the year.

Presumably they stepped back mostly for fear of a negative blowback on their own economies, or possibly also to leave more room to maneuver in case of a full blown Russian invasion of Ukraine. In any case, the message Russia received is that the West is unwilling or unable to effectively confront its blatant disregard for international law, and so they have simply continued on the course started in Crimea (and in some ways before then).

La coincidenza di sindacati dei lavoratori e dei pensionati. Sono due categorie con interessi molto diversi, non dovrebbero essere rappresentate dalle stesse associazioni.

true,ifuseekbryan,null,null,"I moved here a month ago and can try to summarize what I have done.

Phone service:  I went with Free.  My reception is so-so and my data connection is not very good, even in the city center.  But it's only 20 euros a month, so it's hard to argue against it.

Groceries:  There are shops all over and I've found it best to try all of them to find the items that you want and also to find the best prices.  Carrefour, Franprix, Casino, ...  It can be overwhelming.  Grocery stores are generally closed on Sunday (mornings are an exception for some), so buy an extra bottle of wine on Saturday.

Bank:  I went with LCL just because that's what I was recommended.  If I had to do it again, I probably would find another bank because they have very high fees.  Someone else might be able to make a recommendation.

Life-things:  I bought a lot of things at Conforama - very inexpensive and good-enough quality.  If you have more expensive tastes than I do, Habitat is a good place to check out.  It's easiest to live here with few things, in my opinion.

Other things:  I hope you know French.  I know nothing, and it has made my experience a lot harder.  Luckily, I have friends that speak French that were willing to accompany me to the OFII (well, to the door, as only applicants are allowed to enter) or to the clinic for vaccinations.  

I've been told that, as an American, I'm very impatient and want things done quickly.  That's not so in France, so be prepared to wait for... everything.  There have been several situations for me where there is a clear solution but I've had to dance around in order to get anything done.  These situations have been frustrating at times.

It's a great city and you'll love it, but it does take some getting used to.  I haven't been here long, so take my advice for what it is.

Cell phones:
are a pain. Unless you have an unlocked phone like google's nexus line you'll probably have to buy a French phone to go with that sim card. SFR and Orange are the French equivalents to AT&amp;T and Verizon so they may not have the best deals but coverage is guaranteed. 


Groceries:

Internet can be a huge hassle. They don't send someone to set up your box, you just get in the mail. It's normally fine, except my SFR box didn't work, and it took two weeks of phone calls to get a technician to come out, and he rescheduled twice, and expected me to be available from 8am to 7pm.

Groceries are easy. You just go to the Franprix or Monop' or Carrefour that's nearest to your house.

Where are you going to school? That will mostly define where you're going to eat and what not. Make friends with whoever in the school handles your OFII stuff. That can save a ton of headaches.

When you start missing America, there's a few good American restos in town. Blues Barbeque is run by a lady from Dallas, and HD diner seems to be everywhere. Plus Breakfast in America serves the largest omellettes on the planet.

When you first arrive just get a week long Museum Pass, and get that out of your system. Go to Versailles, the Louvre, and all that junk. Both the Arc de Triomphe and the Pompidou are doing some construction, so you should save them for later in your stay.

Phone service is easy. Buy an unlocked phone at FNAC, Darty, or before you come, and get a sim card at Orange or B and U.

Craft Brew places are becoming good hang outs to meet interesting people. Try Demory near the Pompidou or Supercoin.

How do you come to this conclusion? The US and EU have a huge trade relationship. If the EU grows, the US grows, and vice versa. That is the entire motivation behind both sides coming to the table to form a free trade agreement. They both assume it will be mutually beneficial.

The actual relationship is ""tax revenues that a government could sustainably control in the long-run"" = ""spending that a government can afford in the run long"".

The distinction shows itself most obviously in the fact that it's easy to raise revenues in the short-run and simultaneously destroy your production base. Even though tax revenues rose, the country's financial position actually deteriorated because future tax revenues are now guaranteed to fall.

That's why your original position was wrong: it ignores the fact that current levels of tax revenues aren't always sustainable. You could have a 10% budget surplus but if you have declining production and a  near-maximum-revenue tax rate you're still fucked. You could also have a 10% budget deficit but if you your tax burden is low and you have increasing ouput then you're fine

That's why GDP is a better measure - it gives a stronger hint as to the sustainability of current spending and taxation.

Greece was fucked because it overspent relative to its production.

true,Seldon_,null,null,"I mostly agree with the article. Sanctions are not the optimal course of action here. Diplomacy backed with the very obvious threat of force is, and the West has proven to be absolutely unwilling to do that. The point is not to go to war, it is to be *willing* to do so, or at least appear like you are. By taking that option off the table they have already shown their hand.

The only sanctions that would have a meaningful effect are one that causes the Russian economy to implode in the short term, and that would require a complete cessation of their energy exports. But even that is an inferior option, as its destabilizing effect might backfire. And as the author points out, it might push Russia towards autarky.

&gt; First, the transformation of what was a military-diplomatic dispute about Ukraine’s borders into an economic confrontation between the West and Russia is likely to tempt other powerful countries, such as China and Israel, into taking military action to settle their territorial disputes.

Is there anything particularly wrong about settling disputes with military action? That has been the classical state of international relations once diplomacy fails.

&gt; Instead, they laid down simplistic and non-negotiable principles — that international boundaries were completely sacrosanct and that only the national government in Kiev could have any democratic legitimacy.

The fact that the West was entirely unwilling to negotiate on these, or even the status of Crimea within/without Ukraine, was somewhat disconcerting. The West should have pushed for an independent Crimea which was guaranteed by both Russia and Ukraine, with a renewal on the lease to Sevastopol. A solution like that would have satisfied most or all parties. 

Not leaving room to compromise gives Russia only two courses of action: back down or continue to destabilize Ukraine. They're not going to back down, for nationalistic and ""prestige"" reasons. It would make them look weak and they won't have that.

Meanwhile, the West seems to be lost in this idiotic delusion of 21st century utopianism. It won't negotiate because it feels like it doesn't *have* to negotiate. ""It's 2014 and we should be over such petty differences like borders and ethnic boundaries and whatever,"" they say, ""by the way, why are you still persecuting all those poor gay people?

And I arrive at this conclusion not by looking at anyone's words but by looking at modern history since 1945 regarding the most important armament ever invented (the one that makes earth shattering kabooms):

- First the US invents the bomb, and shares the know-how with UK.

- Then the CCCP reinvents the bomb, and cold war starts.

- Suddenly France gets the bomb too and everyone gets scared, because they aren't really aligned.

- Then China gets it too, and then everyone who already has the bomb decides to consider themselves masters of the world: creating the NPT under the false pretence of nuclear disarmament (really it was signed in 1968 and up to today not a single ""nuclear weapon state"" has disarmed itself).

Since then every single country that has pursued the bomb outside of the NPT has become an international pariah: (South Africa, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, India and Pakistan) or has had its program indefinitely postponed (Italy, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Turkey or Spain). Also, US wilfully violated the NPT by selling Tridents to UK, demonstrating its commitment both against denuclearization and for keeping nukes under their control. Because that has always been US's intent regarding nukes: to control them and to ensure that no-one can ever use them against US soil (and really, I can't fault them for that, but from a non-nuclear actor it's a scary situation).

And finally, with the current events in Ukraine everyone has finally seen how much the word of Russia is worth, and how no country can truly be independent without the ability to nuke Moscow and Washington. 

So, really, who cares if some country has 50 or 100 F-35s as long as it can't defend itself against the real dangers of WW3?

Any data for France ? I didn't give you figures about the UK. I don't care about the UK, they always played solo and still have their Thatcher rebate, yet another example of how the EU can never achieved a political union.

&gt;This implies France's borrowing rates and general investor confidence in its economy rely heavily upon the Euro.

Yeah, that's why [foreign investment is leaving France and going to fiscal paradises](http://www.lesechos.fr/29/01/2014/lesechos.fr/0203277295773_investissements-etrangers---la-france-disparait-des-ecrans-radar--ruee-sur-les-paradis-fiscaux.htm).

Basic macroeconomics : euro is going to get higher because Germany has a gigantic trade surplus [which is hurting the eurozone very bad](http://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2013/bulletin_93_js_st_article2-8164.pdf). That's why [Germany may face fines](http://www.forexlive.com/blog/2014/04/11/germany-to-feel-the-wrath-of-eu-sanctions-if-current-account-surplus-grows-aep/) because it doesn't respect European rules, Germany is playing [beggar-thy-neighbor](http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/18/world/europe/opinion-schelkle-germany-beggar-my-neighbor/) with the eurozone (because you know, EU states do not share a common interest). Moreover, ECB is not adjusting its monetary policy to correct that so there's no reason to expect any change.

This has nothing to do with confidence, trade balance surplus and conservative monetary policy means higher currency.

&gt;France's borrowing rates would rise, putting it even more in debt and hampering its growth.

You're talking in nominal rates, which is a total nonsense. You need to talk in real rates, taking into account the [inflation France needs](http://europeansting.com/2014/03/18/why-eurozone-needs-a-bit-more-inflation/). By the way, ECB is not even close to its goal of a 2% inflation.

&gt;So what? Everytime there's a crisis we need a new currency and to leave the world's biggest integrated economic area?

Let me repeat : Eurozone is the biggest unemployment area, it's  the [worst performing economic zone](http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2014/february/weak-eurozone-growth-lags-us-and-uk/79722.aspx) and will [stay so for the next decade](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/qr_euro_area/2013/pdf/qrea4_section_1_en.pdf).

Congrats for your eurozone. Let's continue this way ! Let's do more of it !

&gt;states such as Greeece are now running primary budget surpluses

What a joke. Greece has in 2013 a [12.7% deficit](http://www.marketall.eu/economy-and-politics/6114-eurostat-confirms-2013-govt-deficit-at-127-of-gdp), [classic Greek statistics](http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2014/04/24/greek-statistics-are-back-primary-deficit-presented-as-surplus-with-eurostats-seal-of-approval/) !

I don't know where you get your numbers, cause on a year to year basis, [unemployment is still rising](http://fr.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idFRPAEA1C04B20140213), and Greece is on its 13th month of deflation in a row. Sure with [more emigration](http://www.enetenglish.gr/?i=news.en.article&amp;id=1631), unemployment rates will drop !

&gt;Same goes for Spain

[Same goes for Spain](http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2014/04/29/hausse-du-taux-de-chomage-en-espagne-au-1er-trimestre_4408825_3214.html)

&gt;Lastly, I very much doubt we'll see widespread deflation in the EU.

I very much doubt that the eurocrisis is over. As long as euro is there, economies of the south and France won't recover.

&gt;Nowadays, with so many countries covered by the EU free trade system, the EU holds much more bargaining power.

Nowadays, with so many countries in the EU, it's impossible to get a common policy and to agree on strong decisions. That's why the US always favoured European construction, because they knew it would weaken us.

What bargaining power ? What was the bargaining power during the redaction of the ACTA agreement ?

ACTA was negotiated by the same people that are negotiating the TTIP, is was signed by the EU representatives. Only because of a huge popular campaign the parliament had to refuse it, after EU messed up.

&gt;Because countries with different legal systems inevitably

Why ?

If regulations are in consumers interest, there's no reason for this. If EU regulations favour French consumers, there's no reason that they won't be applied.

&gt;I'm not sure why you would mention protectionism

http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/regulatory-protectionism-hidden-threat-free-trade

That's what behind the TIPP. Hormones in beef and chlorine in chicken is what's next for us.

&gt;So you're arguing for less consumer-oriented regulations?

You're arguing that different regulations means more costs. In that case it means less costs. I'm in no way arguing for hormone beef or chlorine chicken.

I'm arguing for general interest oriented regulations. A lot of the regulations are unnecessary and simply used to forbid some foreign products. For example regulations on cheese in the US.

EU is not different from any other regulating power : it's [infested by lobbies](http://corporateeurope.org/power-lobbies) especially the financial lobby, instead of being concerned about the people.

EU should concentrate on unemployment, fiscal, social and financial regulation. Not on more free trade. It shouldn't forbid state intervention and subsidies which is how we created Airbus, ESA or Eurotunnel. It shouldn't forbid market protection when an economy is not ready to market liberalisation.

France gives 7 billion euros to the EU each year. What we need from the EU is results. Right now, the results are unemployment, 0,5% inflation, weak growth and no policy to improve competitiveness or investments.

&gt;The last thing France needs is more entitled farmers looking for privileges. Their influence on French society is already way too big compared to other member states.

You don't know shit about French farmers. They work a lot more than anyone to feed the EU and earn way less money than what they deserve for securing our food supplies.

&gt;Don't judge a treaty that's being negotiated behind closed doors as you don't have all the information.

Experience of ACTA and the other treaties with the US are sufficient to judge of what is being negotiated.

&gt;Do you seriously think European negotiators are such pushovers?

Yes. Why was the US **always** favoured more European integration if it was to create an independent and possibly a rival ?

&gt;the U.S. agricultural industry is still butthurt to this day because of the EU's food regulations

They're pissed off because they want everything. Like François Mitterrand said :

*La France ne le sait pas, mais nous sommes en guerre avec l'Amérique .
Oui, une guerre permanente, une guerre vitale, une guerre économique, une guerre sans mort apparemment. Oui, ils sont très durs les américains, ils sont voraces, ils veulent un pouvoir sans partage sur le monde.
C'est une guerre inconnue, une guerre permanente, sans mort apparemment et pourtant une guerre à mort.*

&gt;If French salaries are deemed too high by the French government, it will take measures to reduce it to increase employment

You mean internal devaluation that only hurts the poor ?

&gt;why do you think one should be punished for success? 

A huge trade is not success, it's a very bad commercial unbalance. I already put links explaining why it was bad.

There no many youth living the, as most of them immigrate and are the only source of income for entire families. Many cross the Border to Ukraine, and often fall in the chains of mafias, other get more lucky and get s job somewhere. In Odessa for example, construction  work takes them as cheap labor, where they make an average of $25/ week. 

Since the pro-Russian movements started appearing in Odessa, many could be easily identified to be from Transnistria, as Odessa is a multicultural city where people are used to easily identify the origins of people around. 

A thousand dollars can easily buy dozens them to spread unrest for a whole month. 

Since last December money has been flowing to spread chaos break Ukraine in pieces. From the Tituski in Maidan, vilagers and unemployed in the east, disbanded Berkuts in Crimea, and Transniestria in Odessa, as well as locals willing to cash with their cause.  

Police is knows to always been deeply corrupt. 
Many Policemen have been showing unwillingness to enforce order to pro-Russians, making it highly questionable what makes them avoid to carry their orders. The cause? Or money in their pockets?

There have been reports of captured pro-Russias admitting that they were being paid, as well as there were people detained, traveling from Crimea to the east with hundreds of thousand dollars.

And where is this money coming from?

Yanukovich has stolen dozens of Billions until he fled to neighbor Russia. The east was the bed of his support. As well as his ""family"" and other corrupt politicians and oligarchs to whom the reforms and regulations demanded by agreements with EU  which boost transparency and sweep corruption  are not suitable for the ways that these people like to do business. 

If they can easily buy people to spread chaos and oppose Kiev, they can easily come back and carry on with their former lives if such chaos achieves the division of Ukraine. They have the support of the Kremelin for intelligence and to spread propaganda, and that's enough to bring everything to the point that we see today.

In the end, all this is a country divide, where on one side we have a government with no money, infiltrated and undermined by Russian intelligence, and politicians with this dirty money in heir pockets, trying to do things right in order to get and maintain support from the Western world which hasn't been more than diplomatic efforts and promises, struggling to contain armed separatists and keep its territorial integrity. ON the other side we have a band of thieves, funding a chaos to trip Ukraine in half, and continue with their corrupt businesses which is pretty much is OK for Russia as it serves to what the Putin wanted to do with the whole, keep it as a zombie state with a puppet government, infested with corruption from top down lead by a bunch of thieves covered and protected by the Kremlin, kept in the edge of poverty and serve as a buffer zone between Russia and the west.

In the case of the Donau-Schwaben-Straße where the pictures where taken, there are always two people sharing one bathroom. It is just a small bathroom with a shower, toilet and sink. You arrange yourself and keep it clean together. The same goes with the kitchen. Other places may have other flat layouts where everyone has his/her own bathroom. That depends on where you end up.

EDIT: [I've just found a statistics here](http://www.uni-passau.de/universitaet/universitaet-im-ueberblick/zahlen-daten-fakten/#c57138). 6,8% foreign students, most of them from Russia, China and France. We've got 10 Brazilians here at the moment! But I can not believe those numbers. I always get the impression, that we've got much more foreigners here.

Mhm, what would I have wished to know before coming here? That Passau doesn't let you go again? Haha. I planned on staying three years and I've been here for nearly seven years now! The university is a small one, but it really is beautiful and everybody is open-minded and enjoys Passau. You'll see!

Sure, insanity is quite different in both countries, but its impact is quite comparable. For example, in the U.S. there is a big stigma attached to the word 'atheism' and public figures, especially politicians, are reluctant to idenitfy themselves as atheists. In Poland, the word 'abortion' is similar in this regard. It's uniformly claimed to be something evil. At best, some people perceive it to be a 'lesser evil' in some situations. And if I remember correctly, a couple years ago the parliament seriously considered a bill to ban abortion altogether, even if the pregnancy is a result of rape or the baby is going to be born dead. There are many other differences, e.g. antisemitism or racism, but in general Polish right-wingers are no worse than their American counterparts.

La tutela del lavoratore e' indispensable, ma purtroppo i sindacati coprono solo certe categorie lavorative. Oggi abbiamo centinaia di migliaia di lavoratori che non si conformano piu' con la categoria da tutelare sotto un sindacato. Troppi sono precari o con partita iva anziche' con contratto che non sono tutelati e sono in un limbo eterno del menefregismo politico.

I sindacati dovrebbero ammodernarsi e capire il lavoatore 2.0 nella sua situazione ed essenza. Io personalmente, sono stufo di vedere scioperi a destra e sinistra che danneggiano il lavoratore italiano e nessun altro; basti vedere quando nei capoluoghi scioperano il venerdi i mezzi pubblici.

Ci sono storie di successo dei sindacati che hanno aiutato il paese a sviluppare un senso pie' etico sul lavoro. Purtroppo, pero', chi e' salito ai vertici dei sindacati si sta comportando come i politici: vanitosi, capricciosi, e distanti dal popolo.

http://www.yggdrasil.fi/2014/04/varannan-svensk-och-finlandare-redo-att-lamna-eu-for-ett-nordiskt-forbund/

Google Translate:

&gt;A new poll shows that 49 % of Swedes and 50 % of Finns are willing to go out of Europe and into the Nordic unions. A previous study in Denmark showed that 47 % of Danes are ready to do the same.

&gt;The opinion poll conducted by TNS Gallup in late March the following question to 1051 Swedes and Finns in 1013 :

&gt;Suppose there could be established a Nordic federation consisting of Denmark , Finland, Iceland , Norway and Sweden , with common policies in a wide range of areas , such as environmental policy , justice and foreign affairs , and trade agreements with the EU and other countries. If you had to choose between that Sweden would be included in this Nordic covenant or be a member of the EU. What would you have chosen ?

&gt;• A Nordic Association
• Swedish EU membership
• Do not know / no

&gt;Of Swedish respondents chose 28 % continued membership of the EU , 23 % said do not know / no and 49% chose to be part of a Nordic federation. 

&gt;Of those surveyed Finns chose 31% continued membership of the EU , 19% do not know / no and 50% chose to be part of a Nordic federation.
In Finland , the support for a Nordic Federal greatest among Social Democratic voters (73% ) and lowest among Coalition Party voters ( 29%).

&gt;Iceland has already earlier this year withdrew its EU application and for Norway's EU membership is not current .

&gt;The survey results show that there is a great openness for a Nordic alternative to EU membership among Finns and Swedes. The previous Danish findings indicate the same for Danes' part . The issue of a Nordic federation should be taken seriously in the Nordic policies and discussed without reservation in and between the Nordic countries .

&gt; The need for redistribution between member states arises partly because the process of economic integration, which may confer net gains in the aggregate, does not necessarily raise the economic welfare in all areas. The changing pattern of production and exchange that characterizes an integrating Community typically brings gains to some but loses to others. To make integration acceptable to all participants may thus require an explicit redistributive mechanism to divide the gains from integration in a politically acceptable way.

Well, right if everyone plays ball but Putin evidently *isn't* playing ball. 

Thing is Putin has made the far bigger mistake. Eastern and Western Europe are going to cannon-up as fast as fucking possible, and we have the money to do it. It's also driving ALL the rest of Europe into close military alliance because we are now collectively shitting a brick over Russia. Ditto strengthening alliances with the USA because an aggressive Russia is a threat to all of us. 

Europe is now very sensibly looking to ditch Russian gas and other hydrocarbons as fast as possible. They represent dam near 20% of Russia's economy. Big own goal there. That's even before the other sanctions bite and new investment gets scared off for years to come. 

Nobody's going into Russia's territory, because nukes. Russa isn't going into NATO territory for exactly the same reason. NATO membership is now inevitable over the next year or two for the rest of Eastern Europe because of Putin. 

Russia manages to gobble up the Crimea and possibly some of Eastern Ukraine because people assumed wrongly they'd learned to play nice. Big deal (though kinda sucks for the Ukraine) However in doing so they've united  Europe against them, done massive damage to their economy and are not going be trusted again for a couple of decades.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I have taken a skim through the comments, and I'd like to make a respectful response to the criticism. I would like to note that on some of the non-central points (what country is being merged with what, some ideas for the constitution) I am merely brainstorming. I wanted to show this to the community so we could brainstorm and maybe hypothesise on how a United States of Europe would best look; to that end, I don't appreciate being called names.

&gt; Complaints with country mergers

* After a review of the top comment, I admit that the Greco-Turkish and Benelux/German would not be a good idea, perhaps those particular mergers could be re-worked. I'd like to defend what has been dubbed the 'neo-Yugoslavia' idea; with a thorough peace process, I'd like to hope that the people of the Balkan nations could come to treat each other better, and one day unify, to achieve more than they would be able to as individual nations. It is a similar wish I have for my own country, Northern Ireland, for a shared society where British Protestants and Irish Catholics are not so bitterly divided.

* I believe that, in the long-term, there could be a revolution to overthrow the Russian oligarchy; perhaps a liberal democracy could be established, and Russia could be a compatible participant in our continent. Obviously, I'm not saying we merge Russia into every other country in Europe as is.

* I fully accept the criticism regarding the names; consider them placeholders, for a lack of any better ideas.

* I believe the 'Westlands' union could work, not as is, but under a reforged shared national identity, based not on tradition, but the ideas of freedom and liberty. The reason I listed the resulting as federation as so fragmented was to allow all communities to co-exist.

* I think the idea of /u/Greyzer to split up larger countries in order to successfully federalise Europe is great, and actually a much better approach than what I thought of!

Apologies to anyone I offended through senseless merger suggestions, national identity in Eastern Europe isn't quite my strong point.

I urge anyone who wishes to comment to suggest ways in which a United States of Europe could be achieved, rather than simply criticize me for why certain mergers couldn't work. Above all else, I am an idealist, and will remain as such. :)",1,1399151142,null,0,false,0,ch8rp94,t3_24ms3d,t1_ch8rp94,t3_24ms3d,null,1433637228,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

3)  The Right Sector thugs then joined the hooligans and together they viciously attacked the pro-Russian tent city: the tents were torn down and the anti-regime demonstrators viciously beat up to a pulp.  The local cops stood by and watched.
4)  The anti-regime demonstrators ran literally for their lives towards the building of Unions which had been their normal rallying point at which point they were surrounded and the building set ablaze.
5)  Those attempting to leave the building were severely beat up and many murdered.  Many were shot while standing in the windows to flee from the flames.
6)  The neo-Nazis did not let the firefighters through.
7)  With each jumping demonstrator or each person shot in the windows the crowd would scream ""Glory to the Ukraine!  Glory to he heroes!""  Many took souvenir videos.  For them, this was a joyful, liberating event.
8)  The Ukrainian social networks flooded with joyful messages congratulation the ""heroes"" in Odessa and promising more of the same to the accursed Moskals.
9)  The Western and Ukie press reported the events as a ""clash"" with ""casualties"" but with no reference to any one party causing this massacre.

The reason I listed the resulting as federation as so fragmented was to allow all communities to co-exist.

You're from Northern Ireland and you think a ""Westlands"" Union would work or even happen? 99% of the (Republic of) Ireland are not for re-unification with the UK nor ever would be any time soon. Even ignoring nationalism, you still have logistic issues, the fact that Irish issues would be democratically negated (due to Britain's larger population and due to the fact that there are more British constituencies than Irish constituencies). You need only look at history to see how this never worked well, just take when Ireland was part of the UK. In Westminster, it was difficult to push all Irish issues in the time allocated for these to be discussed, also the fact that time was allocated to Irish issues meant that there was less time to discuss issues effected other parts of the UK at that time. Independence made sense in that way. 

As for your plan to re-draw the borders of Europe for this hypothetical USE, why can't you just leave the national borders the way they are now and incorporate them the way they are but as state borders inside this hypothetical USE. Doesn't that make more sense? Most borders in Europe up until now since the end of WW2 have stood the test of time, and messing them around again has the potential to cause a heck of a lot of problems and even unrest.

L'ultrà sarebbe Gennaro De Tommaso, detto ""Genny 'a carogna"", noto alle autorità per precedenti reati. Sarebbe inoltre figlio di Ciro De Tommaso, ritenuto affiliato al clan camorristico del rione Sanità dei Misso. Sulla maglietta nera di Gennaro la scritta ''Libertà per gli ultras'' sul retro, e ''Speziale libero'' davanti.

true,stevecf17,null,null,"This section of the article is an example of the rejection of Putin as representative of groups gangsters. The WSWS and ICFI have supported the working class from a socialist and international prespective. From Peter Schwarz the Secretary of the International Committee of the Fourth International founded in 1938 by Leon Trotsky and the chairman of the World Socialist Web Site International Editorial Board David North: [The crisis in Ukraine and the historical consequences of the dissolution of the Soviet Union](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/03/07/pers-m07.html)



&gt;Prior to the breakup of the USSR, the linchpin of Stalinist foreign policy was “peaceful coexistence” with imperialism. The Kremlin used all of its influence to suppress the international working class struggle against capitalism in return for an imperialist accommodation with the USSR.

&gt;In the final years of its rule, as it completed its repudiation of whatever remained of the legacy of the October Revolution, the Kremlin bureaucracy under Gorbachev acted as if imperialism was a Marxist fiction. As they dismantled the Soviet Union, the bureaucrats peddled the illusion that a capitalist Russia would be allowed by the United States and its European NATO allies to live in peace, as the new Russian biznismen grew ever richer on the plundered wealth of the old USSR.

&gt;But imperialism is not a fiction. It is a brutal reality, and its geopolitical and economic interests rule out peaceful coexistence with Russia. The opposition of the United States to the Soviet Union was based not only on the non-capitalist structure of the USSR. The United States could never reconcile itself to the fact that the Soviet Union, the creation of the October Revolution, deprived American imperialism of direct control over the vast natural and human resources of such an immense country. Even though the USSR no longer exists, the appetites of US and European imperialism remain.

&gt;Thus, a weak capitalist Russia confronts the threats of American and European imperialism. Leading a regime that rests on an utterly corrupt elite—which has deposited a substantial portion of its ill-gotten riches in US and European banks—Putin relies on the reactionary mechanisms of military maneuvers and Great Russian chauvinism. Bereft of a coherent strategic vision—let alone one that would find support beyond the borders of Russia—he is looking for an avenue of retreat that will not leave his regime utterly humiliated and discredited. But it is not at all certain that the United States will ease the pressure, and the danger exists that the crisis may escalate out of control.

&gt;In The Sleepwalkers, a recently published book on the July 1914 crisis that led to the outbreak of World War I, historian Christopher Clark calls attention to the recklessness of the European diplomats whose miscalculations produced a disaster. But compared to Obama and his European allies, the actors in the 1914 crisis seem almost models of restraint!

&gt;Even if a way is found out of the present impasse, it will be only of short duration. Another crisis will soon follow. The crisis of February-March 2014 should leave no doubt that the imperialist system must lead to war. The only means by which this can be prevented is through the unification of the international working class in the struggle for socialism.

That's is also true, but more as a local identity and mostly due to its uniqueness inside Ukraine and its multiculturalism. But you can't fully separate it from Ukraine as it is when looked at the state level. But that pretty much happens in any big country with areas with similar circumstances, where government are corrupt and fail to unify the people. So far in Ukraine governments have only cared for the interests of its members. Now the hope comes from the fact that now people are awaken and watching, and anyway there's no much there to steal, so, who's will get there now can only care to rebuild the country. 

&gt; Most or practically everybody I know in Odessa is against the current government and consider them criminals.

I understand the basis of that, however, elections would solve this, and people in odessa know it, that's one of the reasons why they were keeping calm.

&gt; Who goes on these meetings/protests? Probably very few odessits...

Well... I know pretty many Odessits who go as pro-Ukraine, many because they support a unified Ukraine, but some more because they are against the pro-Russians that are popping up from nowhere and bringing instability and insecurity to the city. 

Odessa in my opinion is the only region that reunites some motives and certain conditions for federalization, but still! As for any other region I don't see reasons and it could be bad specially due to corruption. 

In my opinion, and you maybe will disagree with it, but Ukraine should be kept united as we are already in the 21st century when borders are no longer overthrown due to cultural differences, and people, in the western world specially, have learned to live with each other despite the differences. That can be seen seen in Odesssa that could be a good example for Ukraine and even for Russia, when in Russia the distinction and division of ethnics and cultures is still cultivated to be used as a toll of control. 

Joining the EU would be a big step for Ukraine and would bring significant improvements at all levels. I was born and raised in a country that in the early 80's was pretty much as Ukraine is now, and than joined the EU. I saw all the evolution and improvements that it brought that would never be possible in any other way, and how life is way much better now. When I'm in Ukraine, specially Odessa, it reminds me a lot how it was in my country in the 80's, and I see everywhere a huge potential to evolve. 

&gt; but nobody wants to accept immigration from Ukraine (I checked US/Canada).

That's not necessarily true, but I understand your way of thinking about it, as there you are used to struggle in order to get any document without bribes or get any governmental institution to do anything in a straight and consistent way. I speak for Canada where I've been living for the past 10 years. You just have to find one Immigration ""program"" that can fit your case, and follow the procedures. You wont be stuck because some bitch in the Immigration office is having a bad day, or because somebody is lazy or waiting for a bribe. Things work as they are supposed to, and you can do EVERYTHING on-line.
You should hear what my wife (an Odessite) has to say about government departments here, sometimes I think she loves them more than me! /s

I'm currently taking the first steps on helping a couple from Odessa in the process of immigrating here, and another one to immigrate to Portugal. If you are seriously thinking about trying Canada, I can definitely give you some guidance and help you with anything I can. Send me a private message, and we can discuss it further.

Then there is the question as to how well it will actually do against a strong opponent. The US Navy has not faced anyone even close to their calibre in 70 odd years and when they went up against the Japanese it was simply superior numbers that in the end carried the victory (read: the supply chain).

So no, I am not so sure that the US would carry that one away, and forget the Navy as any kind of power in the area. The only way this would work is if the US manages to move all the supplies over land or ignores the Turks and just sails through, but that would probably not be received well.

&gt; the B-2 stealth and b-52 heavy bombers (both of which can circumnavigate the globe, with little concern for supply lines, so long as the Midwestern US is secure and two airborne fuel tankers are flying in friendly airspace),

Again, these have not been up against a full formed military in their existance really. North Korea managed to take down B-52s and I have no doubt the Russians can accomplish that as well. B-2? We'd have to see, but there were some reports that put doubt into the stealth capability of the planes.

UK? Sure. The rest? We'll have to wait and see. Because the moment they do this Russia will turn off gas and oil shipments to central Europe. Just a hunch, but the Ukraine is not worth it to that degree to most of Europe.

&gt; the US Military has been waiting for this and has been preparing for it.

Is that why they just pulled their last tanks out of Europe? You're also forgetting that the US just ""finished"" a decade long war on two fronts which, at best, could be described as a phyrric victory. How well do you think the US could hold out / secure the area right now? Because the Russians wouldn't just sit there and twiddle their thumbs.

The government was appointed by a freely elected parliament, much like the last one.

The acting president wasn't, of course - but then the Ukrainian government did immediately write out new presidential elections. It's the Russian government that's now calling on the Ukrainians to cancel those elections.

Point worth mentioning: in the [last parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_parliamentary_election,_2012#Results), Yanukovych's Party of the Regions and the Communists pooled 43.2% of the vote. The pro-Maidan parties (Fatherland, UDAR, Svoboda, Ukraine – Forward! + Our Ukraine) pooled 52.7%. The only reason why it was the former two who got to pool a majority of seats, helped by a couple of independents, was because the electoral system was not kind to the opposition's divisions. It's also worth mentioning that those elections, and the vote counting in particular, were [decried by the OSCE](http://i.imgur.com/4AyvYsA.png) as having been biased in favour of the government.

This is 100% accurate.  I think that they can afford the price, because the US has been turning the police forces into a paramilitary force.  They will use this to subdue any kind of soft resistance and ignore anything that doesn't present a real threat to the leadership and elites.  You see how much pistol ammo the US Federal Govt has been hoarding along with extra emergency supplies and the new bunkers they've been constructing?  It's pretty clear who that's for.  So long as the bourgeoisie are safe, they don't care about the rest.

&gt; You're also forgetting that the US just ""finished"" a decade long war on two fronts which, at best, could be described as a phyrric victory. How well do you think the US could hold out / secure the area right now?

I've considered this.  I've actually made this same argument, but I was convinced by the counterpoint that 'terrorists' are a faceless, nationless boogieman and only a volunteer military (1% of the population) has been fighting them.  In a conflict with Russia (a concept that raises all kinds of imagery in the American mind), there would necessarily be a draft.  The people would have to fight the war.  With the US on a wartime footing and economy, every person would be 'fighting a great patriotic war'.

The US could do it.  The American people would come along, not without standard anti-war protests, of course and routine opposition, but they would, because of 100% employment and a 'booming economy'.  It would have the same kind of effect that the *New Deal* followed by WWII had - a massive federal spending plan to end a depression.

The only question remaining is: would they do it?  I don't know if they would.  A booming economy is good inspiration, but I don't think it's enough to take on the Russians in full force.

They don't usually hire under such circumstances if they don't see and talk to the person, that's why it should be done here and not through a remote request. 

Usually the jobs that which companies give such opportunity are mostly for general labor, construction, cleaning, restaurants, but sometimes there's one or another opportunity for specialized fields. Most of them usually don't require english if its is not a specialized job.
