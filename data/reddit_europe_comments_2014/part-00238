This was also essentially a treaty between the NATO states of France, UK and the US that prohibits us from asking Austria to join NATO, so even though Russia as successor to the USSR doesn't have a great reputation of abiding by treaties (e.g. the Budapest Memorandum guaranteeing Ukraine's territorial integrity), the reputation of the west is also on the line.

OECD almost never comments on policy and they even said the ECB needs to take a much more aggressive policy. This has been echoed by the IMF, World Bank, German ex-Finance Minister, and countless other organizations. Most of it has fallen on deaf ears.

I was super fortunate in the fact that my parents substantially helped me offset the cost of my flights to and from germany (they covered 50%). That being said, I also had a 4k opportunity in the states and I am SOSO glad that I did the DAAD Rise program instead. 

I think that the rise program gives you so much more than the monetary compensation. Immersion in a different culture, meeting new people from all over the world, the chance to grow your perspective and a chance to do something completely different. I think these things and more! make the program well worth the difference in monetary compensation. That being said we do not live in a perfect world and money is (unfortunately) an important factor to consider.

Here are somethings that I got out of the program: free 2 week language course and homestay in Munich where I met 10 new friends, 6 of which I keep in contact with a year later, I met a girl who I dated for 8 months, I had a chance to participate in novel imaging research which resulted in a publication and a letter of reference for graduate school, I improved my german (I took german for 2 years in Uni), I met 4 german people who I am still friends with today, gave me the courage to apply to graduate school in germany (I'll be at the charite next year in Berlin), the chance the travel through europe and much much more!

in short, participating in the program was one of the best decisions I made during my undergrad!

So at the beginning, Russia said that it was shipping 2,000 tons of humanitarian aid. Divided evenly among 280 trucks, that comes to a little more than 7.1 tons (metric, since it was Russia announcing it), or (7.1mt * 1000kg * 2.2lb) 15,600 lbs of cargo PER truck (again, assuming that each truck was equally loaded).

According to the stories I've been able to read, reporters were granted access to any truck they wanted. Most of them had 10 or less boxes, or 2 pallets of food, or so on. According to Russian reports, they were shipping food, medical supplies, sleeping bags, and so on.

Now, I'm not a trucking expert, but we can do some very elementary math and see if we're anywhere in the ballpark.

Out of everything that was listed, water or packed ""survival"" food would likely be the densest. You can imagine that 15,000 pounds of sleeping bags or foam mattresses would take up quite a bit of space. But water? That's heavy.

Quick google search, and the most common max pallet loads for bottled water is right about 2,000lbs per pallet. however, I haven't seen ANY trucks loaded with water. In reality, I saw a couple trucks that had food loaded on them.

I don't know how much the foodstuffs the Russians are using actually weight, but lets use MRE boxes as a rough analogue. I chose them because each MRE is a fully contained meal, packed very tightly and containing heavy foods ot provide about 3,000 calories per meal. It's also what we're distributing in Iraq to them dudes on the mountain, and what we eat in the Army.

Quick look on the website for the MRE distributors shows that the standard pallet load for MREs is 12 meals per box, and 40 boxes per pallet, and the total weight is 1,000 pounds. So, 2 pallets of MRE equivalents puts you at 2,000 pounds. Now imagine how much space 15,000 pounds of bandages, sleeping bags, and other lighter supllies must weigh!

So there's already a pretty major discrepancy between how much weight Russia said it was sending, and how much we are seeing. They offered two different explanations: 1) the reporters are simply only showing the empty trucks and ignoring the full trucks. But, if this was the case, Russia surely would have announced that this sort of bias was going on - they have so far been extremely vocal very quickly about EVERY complaint lodged against them - why no comment that reporters are ignoring trucks that would already be right there? Because they aren't. That leaves 2) that some of the trucks are loaded lightly to allow for crossloading of supplies in the event of a breakdown. However, this still doesn't make any sense, because so for not a single truck has been seen that is concievably carrying even half of the amount of aid that it's supposed to!

How much is each truck capable of carrying? Well in the US, trucking limits are about 40-45,000 lbs. I don't know what the load limit is for these trucks, but it must be comparable. Of course, capacity is one thing, but you can't load something up with 40,000 of ""stuff"" if that stuff takes up more space than you can physicially fit inside the trailer. So I can concede that. But, so far, each truck has been carrying 5-10% of its capacity, with clearly tons of room to spare.

So both claims are bunk.

But here's what's really interesting. Russia made the claim that they were sending aid, and then the trucks left Moscow for Ukraine. Now, Moscow is about 10 hours from the border with Ukraine. Less than a day's drive for any decent trucker.

Russia even negotiated with Ukraine to cross through a Ukraine-controlled border crossing. Then, when Ukraine announced that they were absolutely goign to inspect the trucks, the convoy made a detour south to cross a border spot that was controlled by rebels. When Ukraine announced it was sending border guards there, too, the convoy stopped for the night in a Russian town. Now, here they are, 'ready for inspection,' and all the trucks are almost empty? All of these trucks have just about enough ""legit"" supplies to cover up the area around the trailer door to make it look full, with plenty of space and weight capacity for other cargo. Remember, these trucks are CAPABLE of carrying about 20 tons each, or 5,600 tons of cargo for the convoy, and they claimed they were carrying 2,000 tons of aid and in reality we've seen what averages out to about 300 tons of actual cargo.

If you can't see that there is clearly something else going on, it's because you have your blinders on.

Also, the ""we need redundant empty trucks"" thing is bogus. This is a 1000km trip. Seriously, everything that has been seen so far could be transported in 20-25% of the trucks. When I was in the Army and we did mass movements, every truck was loaded to the absolute brim with everything we could fit - no space for any spares or breakdown plans. And our trucks, I guarantee you, were more prone to breakdown than civilian, dedicated trucking vehicles

Why are you living in the past.The Ukraine (oh ya, I went there) is gone already.

There was some shenanigans over a warm water naval base. Somebody, somewhere said, that instead of a Russian flag on that naval base, it could be changed, to a non Russian one. 

Fuck you and anyone else who calls me a coward/appeaser.
There are ways and means of going changing flags over naval bases. In fact there is a whole sector of readily available historical material available on the matter.

Politics is like theatre, and the displacement of the Original Ukrainian guy, was like the theatre burning down, with not only those who were burning inside, but the whole world tuned into watch the nightmare scenario unfold.

It's the lunatics that are running the asylum.
A certain strata of EU, US, and Ukrainian political institutions are equally as responsible for this fiasco that exists today in the region. 

Now, how about we displace these guys (we all know it's mostly power hungry men we're talking about here, my sympathy levels for these fuckers wouldn't be much) instead of gunning for a war?

It is totally legitimate to say that Russia is still in the clean up phase from the theatre that burned down, destroying families.

So while they are doing that, The EU and US should be busy little bee's developing , hiring, little institutional changes of ethos, and the like,

The Economist thoroughly destroyed them earlier this year: http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2014/03/britain-and-ukraine

And by elite peshmerga I meant the elite troops within the entire peshmerga. As a whole they aren't very elite since a huge portion are just militiamen/women with only basic training and much of the ""professionals"" are really just armed political operatives of various Kurdish parties. Thankfully all the Kurds have been in peaceful coalitions for a decade now so the factions don't fight anymore, but they're still not really a professional army. Only a smallish subset are actually apolitical troops operating directly for the KRG, and these are mostly English-speaking, western-trained, and extremely well-armed (by the CIA). They're the ones who do the sporting for US jets/drones and who actually take the offensive, while the rest are mostly local defense units.

&gt;__Sati__ ([Devanagari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari): सती, the feminine of *[sat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sat_(Sanskrit\))* ""true""; also called __suttee__) [(https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_(practice\)#endnote_spelling) refers to a [funeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral) practice within some [Asian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia) communities in which a recently [widowed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widow) woman [immolates herself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation), typically on the husband's [funeral pyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_pyre).

&gt;Mention of the practice can be dated back to 4th century BCE. While evidence of practice only appears from the 5th - 9th centuries CE. Practice is considered to have been originated within the warrior [aristocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy) on the [Indian subcontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent), gradually gaining in popularity from the 10th century CE to other groups and becoming generally sanctioned/recommended by the doctrines around the 12th century CE. With the military expansions outside of Indian subcontinent, the practice has been attested to have been practiced in a number of localities in Southeast Asia, such as at [Bali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali) in present-day [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia).

&gt;The practice was outlawed by the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) in 1829 within their own territories in India (the collected statistics from their own regions suggesting an estimated of 500–600 instances of *sati* per year), followed up by laws in the same directions by the authorities in the [princely states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princely_state) of India in the ensuing decades, with a general ban for the whole of India issued by [Queen Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria) in 1861. In [Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal), *sati* was not abolished as legalized practice until 1920. The Indian [Sati Prevention Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sati_(Prevention\)_Act,_1987) from 1987 further criminalizing any type of aiding, abetting, and even the glorifying of *sati* practice.

Of course there are, it's a town. Though I don't know about rice cookers, they're not really used here.

Are you sure you want to buy all of that? I don't know about that particular dorm, but from my experiences in Skopje, none of the dorm rooms had kitchens. Basically, they were just rooms with a bathroom (and in some cases, there were communal bathrooms). You'll probably have meals in a mess hall. 

A small fridge could be useful, but don't expect to be doing much cooking, I doubt there will even be plumbing outside of the bathroom.

Just a note - in general, dorms are pretty terrible in Macedonia...though you get used to it.

""Gar keinen"" is sort of ""not even the tiniest amount of"" which wouldn't really be what we want.

All of my examples were intended to be followed in GERMAN by the follow-ups I used in English. In those cases (only) would the really be used, I admit. And they are sort of stretching the limits. But they aren't grammatically ""wrong,"" just ... awkward as hell, and as you said, unidiomatic.

As for the ""nicht nur einen,"" well, that's the same sentence with an extra adverb. 

It's the difference between someone saying, ""Not only do I have a dog, I have three,"" and saying, ""I don't have *A* dog, I have three."" The second one is more smart-ass-like, but still valid.

E  che tu creda che noi occidentali dobbiamo pagare il fio della nostra opulenza subendo situazioni indesiderabili, tipo dover accogliere chiunque e sopportarne la presenza in qualunque angolo delle nostre città dovessero decidere di sostare. ""Com'è umano lei!""

Il problema è che lo Stato lavora per servire chi è già suo cittadino, non per fare la Onlus ed usare il Paese come campo profughi. Come cittadino non sono tenuto a fare della beneficenza o a pagarla coi miei soldi. Lo Stato non può chiedermi di sopportare situazioni di degrado. Non sono solo ""immigrati che bivaccano"". CI sono anche quelli che si incazzano e fanno rivolte, per non parlare di quelli che, mossi dal disagio, scendono nell'illegalità.

Non è razzismo, è semplice proprietà privata.

Furthermore, the German government ordered to spy on a NATO partner. According to *""Süddeutsche Zeitung""* (SZ), NDR and WDR, this is the result from documents handed over to the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by a BND spy. Markus R., who was arrested in July, confessed in the meantime to have forwarded at least 218 documents to the USA within the last two years.

&gt;The German government is by now aware of the sensitive nature of parts of these documents and the dimensions of the damage caused. Thus USA have now started to use the information provided by Markus R. in the current dispute on US spying activities in Germany. They consider Clinton's tapped phone call as prove that Germany also spied on the US. The US Foreign Minister John Kerry is said to have confronted the German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier with this matter.

The report states that she wasn't the only US politician who had a phone call picked up by BND when they passed through/over an area where it conducts surveillance, and that until about a year ago policy was that such recordings had to be placed on the desk of BND's head before deletion. We know about this because it was among the documents passed on by the BND/CIA double agent, who's job was to delete the recording, ironically.  
Another one of the documents was the list of countries BND was instructed to target and its objectives in them, including one NATO country (which is interesting, but all the report says is that it wasn't the US -- my money is on Turkey).

About the 'mental loops'. Just happened to read a spot on comment over here: http://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/2dmxgs/this_may_have_been_asked_before_but_is_there/cjr1455

&gt; Sorry, there's really no compelling evidence either way, alas.
&gt;
Many of the first round of separatist leaders were allegedly Russian citizens, but you'd probably have to take their word for that.
&gt;
There have been intercepted phone calls released by the Ukraine government suggesting some of the rebels are reporting to Russian military commanders, but those could be faked by any teenager.
&gt;
There are numerous photos of Grad rocket launchers and other Russian military vehicles geo-located within Ukraine, but those could easily be faked.
&gt;
Reporters have documented heavy weapons in separatist hands whose accompanying paperwork showed them as having very recently been in Russian military stocks, but mumble mumble CIA forgery duplicate serial numbers nazis, or something like that.
&gt;
Separatists have admitted receiving tanks from Russia, but they might have been captured Ukrainian ones from Crimea that went into Russia without anyone noticing, or they could just be a shared mass hallucination; and why on earth should anyone trust a separatist, anyway?
&gt;
Separatists have hinted very strongly to reporters that Russia is providing them material aid, but they did so in Russian, I think, so God only knows what they really meant.
&gt;
Reporters have allegedly witnessed Russian military vehicles crossing the Ukraine border into separatist-controlled areas, but we all know journalists never tell the truth.
&gt;
Several foreign governments have accused Russia of arming the separatists, but all those pro-Israeli nazi governments clearly can't be trusted to tell the truth, also Syria, or maybe Iraq, I forget what the whataboutism for this talking point is.
&gt;
Several dozen Russian citizens, reportedly active-duty military personnel, died in the battle for Donetsk airport, but for all we know the Ukraine military kidnapped them and were using them as human shields or sex toys or something, because ruthless nazi sheep-buggerer war crimes junta.
&gt;
There were photos of a Russian Buk supposedly just inside the Russian border, then supposedly inside Ukraine, then supposedly back inside Russia again but missing a missile just after MH-17 was shot down by two Ukrainian ground-attack aircraft, one of them invisible to radar, but that's the easiest sort of Photoshop trick there is, really. (The photos, not the invisible SU-25. Though I guess an invisible plane is pretty easy to Photoshop too, come to think of it.)
&gt;
tl;dr: Baseless accusations, zionist conspiracy theories, nazi slander, unskilled fakery, Syria, Benghazi, Photoshop. Really.

Que finalement, Maximilien, c'était un type bien ? Que la Terreur était un accident de parcours ?  Qu'un homme opposé à la peine de mort en 1791 ne peut pas être membre du Comité de salut public en 1793 ?

Oui, le rôle et les responsabilités exactes de Robespierre pendant la Terreur sont fortement débattues aujourd'hui, et il y a largement de quoi nuancer tout portrait qu'on pourrait dresser du grand homme.

Ce qui me gêne plus, c'est que ce lien provienne du site officiel du Parti communiste français. [On en parlait pas plus tard que mardi dernier](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/2d8p3a/good_history_books_about_the_french_revolution/): l'historiographie communiste de la Révolution française est à prendre avec des pincettes. Robespierre n'était pas assoiffé de sang, mais les communistes français ont trop tendance à le présenter comme une simple victime des circonstances et de son idéalisme trop exigeant. Heureusement, on a fini par se détacher des parallèles entre révolution française et révolution russe, où pour justifier l'une, il fallait forcément justifier l'autre. Robespierre a été érigé en proto-Lénine pendant pas mal de temps... D'où l'intérêt de minimiser ses torts.

La dernière fois que j'ai entendu une apologie de Robespierre, c'était lors d'une conférence d'Alexis Corbière, professeur d'histoire du secondaire et accessoirement secrétaire national du Parti de Gauche. Et ses responsabilités politiques prennaient rapidement le pas sur son métier d'enseignant. Vous avez peut-être entendu parler du membre du Conseil de Paris qui a voulu déposer en 2012 une motion contre la promotion de *Métronome*, le livre de Lorànt Deutsch. Et bien, c'était Corbière. 

Deutsch fait de l'histoire avec des sources périmées et orientée façon ""Ces rois et reines qui ont fait la France"". Je le reconnais volontiers. Mais le raisonnement de Corbière était qu'il fallait à la fois barrer la route à une récupération de l'histoire par la droite... tout en adhérant au récit de la gauche sur un éventuel sens de l'histoire. Toute sympathie pour le bouquin de Deutsch étant considéré comme de l'anti-républicanisme.

Bref, la conférence était écœurante de malhonnêteté intellectuelle, avec un ""deux poids, deux mesures"" flagrant que Corbière trouvait normal. 

Ici, le site du PCF ne fait que citer Robespierre. Mais en étant posté dans ce contexte, ce discours de Maximilien nous en dit beaucoup plus sur le PCF que sur la personnalité de l'homme d'Etat.

*Real talk:* I must note that there is no exact date of the initial settlement of the city, because many cultures went through these lands, which makes some historians go all bonkers and declare Plovdiv the oldest city of Europe, thus creating tensions with the Greek historians. I believe we all could do without those tensions. So, instead of working together to try to preserve and find out more about the history of the whole peninsula, if you will, we distance from each other. Takes time, I guess.


Also, not much of Plovdiv’s center (where supposedly is the place to find new sites and objects from Antiquity) has been researched. Heck, it is said that if 2 soldiers didn’t hid between the rocks of  one of the hills of the city during WWII and thus found the Roman theatre you see on the picture in the gallery, we may have never found out  about its existence there. Excavations are taking place, but they’re rather few and sometimes the project get abandoned like [this one here](http://4coolpics.com/pics/0673/230920673711.jpg), which once was the Eastern gate of Philippopolis and looked something [like this](http://skribezium.blog.bg/photos/33146/original/1681_4%281%29.jpg).

And I'm sure that was collected with the full knowledge of the German government and in full cooperation of it's intelligence agency. 

I'm also confident we're not the only ones in Europe who are doing it.

[**Germany's Deep Cooperation with the NSA**](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-german-bnd-and-american-nsa-cooperate-more-closely-than-thought-a-975445.html)

&gt;The NSA, apparently, did not perform the highly sensitive operation on its own. All signs indicate that the agency had help from Germany's Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), the country's foreign intelligence agency. The code name Wharpdrive appears in a paper drafted in preparation for a BND delegation's visit to NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, and which instructs NSA leaders to *""thank the BND for their assistance with the trilateral program.""* It also makes clear that the German agency plays a leadership role in the Wharpdrive program, with the NSA providing only technical assistance.

&gt;------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;German intelligence agencies, for their part, consider their cooperation with the NSA to be indispensable -- for counter-terrorism efforts, for the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and for the battle against organized crime. According to a classified paper created by the government in response to a query from the opposition, the BND does not keep official statistics on the amount of telephone, email and text message metadata that is shuttled to American agencies. *""All metadata""* collected at the NSA site in Bad Aibling in Bavaria *""is made available,""* the response states. In 2012 and 2013, some 3 million items of content data, or intercepted conversations and messages, were sent to the United States each month.

&gt;These facts and figures, until now available only to select parliamentarians, offer a window into German-American intelligence cooperation. Documents SPIEGEL has seen from the archive of whistleblower Edward Snowden, when combined with SPIEGEL's own reporting, open up a much broader panorama.

&gt;---------------------------------------------------------

&gt;In any case, internal documents indicate that the NSA is pleased with the Bad Aibling facility. *""Two exciting joint ventures""* are carried out there. One involves teams for working on joint surveillance (referred to as ""Joint SIGINT Activity"") and the other for the analysis of captured signals (Joint Analysis Center or JAC). Snowden's documents hint at what precisely the trans-Atlantic allies were collaborating on. In 2005, for example, five NSA employees worked *""side-by-side""* with BND analysts on a BND operation called Orion. Its targets lay outside NATO's eastern border.

&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;One document, though, reveals something else. Stemming from 2009, it includes a list of companies and organizations with domain endings such as .com, .net and .org that are explicitly to be removed from the surveillance efforts because they are German web addresses. Among them are basf.com and bundeswehr.org, but also such domains as orgelbau.com and feuerwehr-ingolstadt.org.

[**Mass Data: Transfers from Germany Aid US Surveillance**](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/german-intelligence-sends-massive-amounts-of-data-to-the-nsa-a-914821.html)

&gt;German intelligence sends massive amounts of intercepted data to the NSA, according to documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden, which SPIEGEL has seen. The trans-Atlantic cooperation on technical matters is also much closer than first thought.

&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;The Americans, though, were quietly replaced by telecommunications experts from the German military, part of the *Fernmeldeweitverkehrsstelle der Bundeswehr*. They moved into the Mangfall barracks, only a few hundred meters from the abandoned NSA structures, laid cables to the radomes and secretly took over the NSA's large-scale surveillance of radio and satellite communications.

&gt;The supposed military site is in fact a secret facility operated by the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), Germany's foreign intelligence agency. NSA surveillance specialists also moved onto the grounds of the barracks, into a windowless building that had been erected within just a few months. Because of its metal shell, German BND agents refer to the building, with a mixture of affection and derision, as the ""Tin Can.""

&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;Day after day and month after month, the BND passes on to the NSA massive amounts of connection data relating to the communications it had placed under surveillance. The so-called metadata -- telephone numbers, email addresses, IP connections -- then flow into the Americans' giant databases.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;The fact that massive amounts of metadata reached NSA databases from German soil is likely to ratchet the discussion over the role of the BND and its cooperation with the NSA even further. New documents from the Snowden archive also show that there is much closer cooperation than previously thought in relation to the controversial XKeyscore surveillance program. SPIEGEL reported on the delivery and use of the program two weeks ago.

[**Germany admits Europe's spy agencies cooperate on surveillance**](http://www.dw.de/germany-admits-europes-spy-agencies-cooperate-on-surveillance/a-17200903)

&gt;Germany's foreign intelligence agency has confirmed it swaps information with European counterparts that carry out mass surveillance. However, it denied that it was working with the British to change and circumvent laws.

&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------

&gt;The Guardian newspaper reported on Saturday that spy agencies in Germany, France, Spain and Sweden were carrying out mass online surveillance and wiretapping.

&gt;The organizations were working in collaboration with Britain, according to documents the paper said had been obtained from US whistle-blower Edward Snowden.

&gt;Britain's electronic surveillance center GCHQ was reported to play a leading role in helping countries across the continent to circumvent laws that limit spying activities.

[**EU Parliament on Mass Surveillance**](http://publicintelligence.net/eu-mass-surveillance/)

&gt;In the wake of the disclosures surrounding PRISM and other US surveillance programmes, this study makes an assessment of the large-scale surveillance practices by a selection of EU member states: the UK, Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands.

[**The German Prism: Berlin Wants to Spy Too**](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/berlin-profits-from-us-spying-program-and-is-planning-its-own-a-906129.html)

&gt;What is surprising about the NSA's program is its size and professionalism. The objective here is also shared by agencies in other countries, above all the BND, Germany's foreign intelligence agency, which is currently significantly extending its capabilities. Last year, BND head Gerhard Schindler told the Confidential Committee of the German parliament, the Bundestag, about a secret program that, in his opinion, would make his agency a major international player. Schindler said the BND wanted to invest €100 million ($133 million) over the coming five years. The money is to finance up to 100 new jobs in the technical surveillance department, along with enhanced computing capacities. This may sound like a pauper's version of the Prism program, but it represents one of the most ambitious modernization projects in the BND's history, and has been given the ambitious German name *Technikaufwuchsprogramm* (literally ""Technological Coming-of-Age Program"").

&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;By the end of 2018, the German agency intends to become a kind of mini-NSA and finally be able to compete in the global espionage business. Legislators have already approved €5 million for 2014, but are still wrangling over the rest of the funding.

&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;German law allows the BND to monitor any form of communication that has a foreign element, be it a mobile phone conversation, a Facebook chat or an exchange via AOL Messenger. For the purposes of *""strategic communications surveillance,""* the foreign intelligence agency is allowed to copy and review 20 percent of this data traffic. There is even a regulation requiring German providers *""to maintain a complete copy of the telecommunications.""*

&gt;However, Clinton is supposedly not the only one: apparently, phone calls by US politicians and from other friendly nations have been repeatedly recorded and submitted to the respective BND President as instructed. 

[**Germany's Deep Cooperation with the NSA**](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-german-bnd-and-american-nsa-cooperate-more-closely-than-thought-a-975445.html)

&gt;The NSA, apparently, did not perform the highly sensitive operation on its own. All signs indicate that the agency had help from Germany's Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), the country's foreign intelligence agency. The code name Wharpdrive appears in a paper drafted in preparation for a BND delegation's visit to NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, and which instructs NSA leaders to *""thank the BND for their assistance with the trilateral program.""* It also makes clear that the German agency plays a leadership role in the Wharpdrive program, with the NSA providing only technical assistance.

&gt;------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;German intelligence agencies, for their part, consider their cooperation with the NSA to be indispensable -- for counter-terrorism efforts, for the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and for the battle against organized crime. According to a classified paper created by the government in response to a query from the opposition, the BND does not keep official statistics on the amount of telephone, email and text message metadata that is shuttled to American agencies. *""All metadata""* collected at the NSA site in Bad Aibling in Bavaria *""is made available,""* the response states. In 2012 and 2013, some 3 million items of content data, or intercepted conversations and messages, were sent to the United States each month.

&gt;These facts and figures, until now available only to select parliamentarians, offer a window into German-American intelligence cooperation. Documents SPIEGEL has seen from the archive of whistleblower Edward Snowden, when combined with SPIEGEL's own reporting, open up a much broader panorama.

&gt;---------------------------------------------------------

&gt;In any case, internal documents indicate that the NSA is pleased with the Bad Aibling facility. *""Two exciting joint ventures""* are carried out there. One involves teams for working on joint surveillance (referred to as ""Joint SIGINT Activity"") and the other for the analysis of captured signals (Joint Analysis Center or JAC). Snowden's documents hint at what precisely the trans-Atlantic allies were collaborating on. In 2005, for example, five NSA employees worked *""side-by-side""* with BND analysts on a BND operation called Orion. Its targets lay outside NATO's eastern border.

&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;One document, though, reveals something else. Stemming from 2009, it includes a list of companies and organizations with domain endings such as .com, .net and .org that are explicitly to be removed from the surveillance efforts because they are German web addresses. Among them are basf.com and bundeswehr.org, but also such domains as orgelbau.com and feuerwehr-ingolstadt.org.

[**Mass Data: Transfers from Germany Aid US Surveillance**](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/german-intelligence-sends-massive-amounts-of-data-to-the-nsa-a-914821.html)

&gt;German intelligence sends massive amounts of intercepted data to the NSA, according to documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden, which SPIEGEL has seen. The trans-Atlantic cooperation on technical matters is also much closer than first thought.

&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;The Americans, though, were quietly replaced by telecommunications experts from the German military, part of the *Fernmeldeweitverkehrsstelle der Bundeswehr*. They moved into the Mangfall barracks, only a few hundred meters from the abandoned NSA structures, laid cables to the radomes and secretly took over the NSA's large-scale surveillance of radio and satellite communications.

&gt;The supposed military site is in fact a secret facility operated by the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), Germany's foreign intelligence agency. NSA surveillance specialists also moved onto the grounds of the barracks, into a windowless building that had been erected within just a few months. Because of its metal shell, German BND agents refer to the building, with a mixture of affection and derision, as the ""Tin Can.""

&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;Day after day and month after month, the BND passes on to the NSA massive amounts of connection data relating to the communications it had placed under surveillance. The so-called metadata -- telephone numbers, email addresses, IP connections -- then flow into the Americans' giant databases.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;The fact that massive amounts of metadata reached NSA databases from German soil is likely to ratchet the discussion over the role of the BND and its cooperation with the NSA even further. New documents from the Snowden archive also show that there is much closer cooperation than previously thought in relation to the controversial XKeyscore surveillance program. SPIEGEL reported on the delivery and use of the program two weeks ago.

[**Germany admits Europe's spy agencies cooperate on surveillance**](http://www.dw.de/germany-admits-europes-spy-agencies-cooperate-on-surveillance/a-17200903)

&gt;Germany's foreign intelligence agency has confirmed it swaps information with European counterparts that carry out mass surveillance. However, it denied that it was working with the British to change and circumvent laws.

&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------

&gt;The Guardian newspaper reported on Saturday that spy agencies in Germany, France, Spain and Sweden were carrying out mass online surveillance and wiretapping.

&gt;The organizations were working in collaboration with Britain, according to documents the paper said had been obtained from US whistle-blower Edward Snowden.

&gt;Britain's electronic surveillance center GCHQ was reported to play a leading role in helping countries across the continent to circumvent laws that limit spying activities.

[**EU Parliament on Mass Surveillance**](http://publicintelligence.net/eu-mass-surveillance/)

&gt;In the wake of the disclosures surrounding PRISM and other US surveillance programmes, this study makes an assessment of the large-scale surveillance practices by a selection of EU member states: the UK, Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands.

[**The German Prism: Berlin Wants to Spy Too**](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/berlin-profits-from-us-spying-program-and-is-planning-its-own-a-906129.html)

&gt;What is surprising about the NSA's program is its size and professionalism. The objective here is also shared by agencies in other countries, above all the BND, Germany's foreign intelligence agency, which is currently significantly extending its capabilities. Last year, BND head Gerhard Schindler told the Confidential Committee of the German parliament, the Bundestag, about a secret program that, in his opinion, would make his agency a major international player. Schindler said the BND wanted to invest €100 million ($133 million) over the coming five years. The money is to finance up to 100 new jobs in the technical surveillance department, along with enhanced computing capacities. This may sound like a pauper's version of the Prism program, but it represents one of the most ambitious modernization projects in the BND's history, and has been given the ambitious German name *Technikaufwuchsprogramm* (literally ""Technological Coming-of-Age Program"").

&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;By the end of 2018, the German agency intends to become a kind of mini-NSA and finally be able to compete in the global espionage business. Legislators have already approved €5 million for 2014, but are still wrangling over the rest of the funding.

&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;German law allows the BND to monitor any form of communication that has a foreign element, be it a mobile phone conversation, a Facebook chat or an exchange via AOL Messenger. For the purposes of *""strategic communications surveillance,""* the foreign intelligence agency is allowed to copy and review 20 percent of this data traffic. There is even a regulation requiring German providers *""to maintain a complete copy of the telecommunications.""*",1,1408145251,null,0,1408145721,0,cjrgznj,t3_2do2mj,t1_cjrgznj,t1_cjrgf1n,null,1435258892,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

C'est avec ce genre de débilités qu'on pousse les gens en dehors de la recherche : arrivé à pratiquement 30 ans, il est plus que légitime d'attendre un peu de stabilité en terme de vie sociale.

Perso j'étais plutôt heureux à l'idée de bouger (pas de SO, moyennement antisocial, ...), de rencontre des gens, etc. mais en gros j'ai fait 2 ans de prépa à Paris, 10 mois d'étude à Lyon, 2 mois en stage sur la côte d'azur, 6 mois d'étude à Lyon, 6 mois en stage en Angleterre, 6 mois d'étude à Paris, 6 mois en stage en Autriche (avec un déménagement au milieu parce que ma coloc arrivait à sa fin). Bon ba après ça tu commences à avoir envie de te poser, de pouvoir souffler un peu entre deux déménagements. Un contrat de 3 ans, c'est un peu le minimum vital.

Alors si après ce contrat, l'idée c'est de s'enchainer 1 an à X, 1 an à Y (avec X et Y sur différents continents) et qu'on trouve encore des types pour dire que ça fait pas assez, il faut pas s'étonner que les gens se tirent vers une vie plus stable. J'ai **un** exemple de quelqu'un qui a réussi à s'en tirer avec un poste permanent après seulement 1 an de postdoc et c'est parce qu'il a eu un parcours plus que parfait (sa liste de publis est longue comme ~~mon bras~~ mes deux jambes mises bout à bout) et c'est à comparer avec des gens très brillants qui se sont tous cassés dans l'industrie faute d'opportunité.

The source of this directive, that is, if it was from within BND or elsewhere, is not specified, but a new directive that such instances should be deleted immediately was issued ""last summer"" (read: after Snowden) by the government/Cabinet. 

Also, the parliamentary committee in charge of the spy agencies has requested the leaked documents that the double agent had passed on, but the government seems to be thinking about withholding the the mission list (countries to target, objectives) from said control committee on grounds of national security.

We're not going to disintegrate like the Soviet Union. 

We're not going to shrink down to the size of a country a little bigger than Washington state with a population/economy closer to California than Japan. 

I don't give a damn what Europe does in relation to Asia/Pacific, and I fully accept China's rise. I have no illusions that America will continue to be a superpower into the future, but we will remain a VERY influential great power with heavy sway in international relations even in a multi-polar world.

I mean shit dude, we're actually projected to surpass the EU economy between 2016-18 IIRC.  An don't forget, as of our economic health NOW, [America came out of the recession five years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Great_Recession), the European Union did as well, but had [a double-dip recession](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/15/eurozone-double-dip-recession) shortly afterwards, [which it only exited from last August](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/13/eurozone-exit-double-dip-recession). In short, we *(America)* still have years of growth while Europe as a whole still has years of recession/loss looming over it's head. We've reached pre-2008 levels last year IIRC, but Europe still has a long way to go before it regains the ground it's lost.

Plus, America had a 2013 [GDP growth of 2.8%](https://www.google.com/search?q=u.s.+gdp+growht&amp;oq=u.s.+gdp+growht&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65l2j69i60j69i61j69i60.9043j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8#es_sm=122&amp;espv=210&amp;q=united+states+gdp+growth&amp;safe=off), compared to the European Union's 2013 [GDP growth of .1%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_European_Union) *(remember, the E.U. was in recession in 2012 &amp; the first half of 2013)*.

Not to mention the fact that the Union is on the [verge of deflation](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/09/can-anything-halt-european-deflation/), with [Italy falling back into recession](http://online.wsj.com/articles/italy-slips-back-into-recession-in-second-quarter-1407318527), [France having serious economic problems](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101862294) &amp; [Germany's economic growth slowing down](http://online.wsj.com/articles/germany-warns-economy-slowed-in-second-quarter-1405000058). America, on the other hand, just found a fuckton of natural gas &amp; oil, with us recently over-taking both Russia &amp; Saudi Arabia as the largest oil producer. 

That said, we can't afford to shore up Europe because of the mentality people like you have. You want EU integration, but then act surprised when nobody wants to fucking do it with Germany after France, the UK &amp; Eastern Europe don't trust you with maintaining European hard power and standing up for EU interests in Eastern Europe, even in soft power, as Germany's reluctance for sanctions and agreement to build Nordstream go to show. 

An if you don't want to be World Police, tell EU countries to withdraw from the United Nations Security Council &amp; stop trying to become a integrated global power with heavy international sway, as hard power is essential for both of those roles whether you like it or not. An that's just a reality pill you gotta swallow.

Also, Russia is pretty fucking threatened by the EU's expansion into Eastern Europe and it's influence in Ukraine as well *(remember that trade agreement which coincided with the start of this shit?)*. Plus, you're in NATO. 

Don't just push that shit on us. Germany and a number of other European countries pushed for Eastern EU expansion, an now your reaping what you sow just as we are as well with NATO *(not sure how Germany felt about that, but they're still in NATO regardless)*. Although I'll get back to you after I get done shedding some tears for how bad Russia gots it after it lost the Soviet Union's oppressed client states &amp; Republics from it's sphere-of-influence...you know...after they WILLINGLY JOINED A DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE. Because fuck Lithuania, Estonia &amp; Lativa...amirite guise? You know...the EU member-states you want to INTEGRATE WITH YOU. lol

Armenia is located in a region place of astonishingly rich culture. Not many countries have such a continuous history of cultural prosperity, let alone in Europe (Romans being the main people responsible for most of Europe's oldest cities, actually; Greece and the UK being exceptional cases, of course).

Other old places can be fairly dated back to BCE times because of trade routes. This is the case with Lisbon, to give an example, which was a settlement-port a thousand years before it became a proper city as we define them with stone buildings organized under specific political and commercial principles. During these thousand years, Lisbon was a group of settlements that happened to be visited regularly by trade boats of much more advanced peoples from the Mediterranean coast. Lisbon was a port in a trade route that went from the Middle-East to Ireland. What's peculiar about these Lisbon settlements, and one of the reasons why it's then fair to say Lisbon is as old as these settlements, is that their territorial disposition and hierarchy of importance is still the same to this day and was so throughout history (same case as Yeravan, actually). 

A counter-example would be Marseille, which even though was already a settlement before the Romans got there, it was mostly an isolated region and not the economic center it became under Roman rule.

Aspetta, apri ""il Fatto Quotidiano"" (concordiamo che sia praticamente l'organo di partito del M5S ormai?) e apri un articolo a caso, ma veramente a caso.
Ora guarda i commenti, preferibilmente quelli più votati.

In un articolo su crisi ucraina o ISIS troverai con certezza al primo posto i negazionisti della verità ufficiale (""Ah ma se lo dice la NATO/gli yankee/i poteri forti allora c'è da crederci!!""), gente che per dare contro a quello che vede come ""il potere costituito"" riesce a far passare Putin o l'ISIS per onestissimi filantropi.

 Se poi invece la notizia tratta di qualsiasi altro argomento, sarà facilissimo trovare il ""eh ma tutto questo per non parlare della EU che con biddebergh ce lo vuole mettere in quel posto!!"".

Assolutamente naturale poi che la base del partito sia quella, il leader dello stesso (a meno che tu non abbia il coraggio di guardarmi negli occhi e dire ""Beppe non è il capo del partito"") si è fatto un seguito denunciando il complotto dei produttori dei detersivi, che nascondevano la biowashball, sostenendo che l'AIDS non esista, che i vaccini causino ogni male, che la cura Di Bella funzionasse, che i cellulari cuocessero le uova, che ogni volta che qualcuno, da qualche parte, dice qualcosa contro di lui c'è il ""Golpettino"", il ""colpetto di Stato"".

Lungi da me sostenere che non ci siano membri validi, molto probabile, ma le opzioni che restano a queste persone sono due - prendere le distanze da Grillo (e vedersi espellere dal partito) oppure stare zitti, ingoiare e macchiarsi della colpa di aver ignorato le bestialità dette dal loro capo.

Le idee e le proposte che portano avanti, per quanto potenzialmente buone, affogano in un'identità di partito nata per portare bailamme nel parlamento, sono le due parole sagge in bocca ad uno stolto sbraitante che nessuno prenderà mai sul serio.

L'unico futuro per chi davvero crede in un MoVimento senza padroni dove la discussione e la civiltà la fanno da padroni è cercare di allontanare il vecchio milionario delirante dalla direzione, ma naturalmente chiunque ci abbia provato è stato scacciato all'ironicamente complottistico grido di ""pagato dal PD"".

My officemate and my best friends wife are Russian (my friend just returned from three weeks over there, he was scarred!).  Where my grandmother lives in Brooklyn, there aren't even signs in English, only Russian. Their mindset is often not taken into account by Westerners who assume they want what we want.  I'm not saying things can't change, but it will be a while in my opinion.  Oh, and you think Americans are annoying about WWII, ever speak to a Russian about the Great Patriotic War?  They are still fighting it!

Well, I wouldn't say resistance isn't an option anymore, civilians can legally arm themselves to the point of the police.  And there are many more civilians of course.  It would really be crazy if the military got involved.  Obviously I hope it doesn't come to that, but if it did, I think  more than a few Americans getting killed would stop any nonsense right away.  The option to resist and lose would probably end up being a win.

I do think we are turning a corner though, surprisingly even a lot of Republicans are against militarization now.  Couple that with gay marriage and weed legalization, and things look like they are improving.  In the late 1800s, the corporations and robber barons had even more power than they do today, and Teddy Roosevelt reformed all that.  Of course that has all been undone, but I think we are getting to the point where major changes can be made again.

The argument the US went to war with Iraq because they wanted to trade in Euros is idiotic. 

Lets take a look at the facts here since this seems to be a fairly widely held conspiracy.

* The 15 largest oil exporters hold, in total, [1.4% of US dollar reserves](http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfh.txt)
* Even though countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela own far more treasuries than Iraq, for simplicity, lets take Iraq's share as 1/15 of this amount (which is *highly* favorable to your argument)
* That puts Iraq's holdings at 0.08% of all US holdings
* Even this far into the calculation, worst case scenario, even if Iraq stopped trading in dollars all together (which is unlikely) it would not cripple the US economy. Many nations already accept alternate currencies for energy, Iran is one and Venezuela is another.
* Lets assume the US thought Iraq was going to triple their dollar holdings over a 20 year period (Again very unlikely, and *very* favorable to your argument)
* **With your argument in the best light, the first 4 months of war in Iraq easily erased any sustained benefit the US would see from Iraq using dollars. Keep in mind this is with statistics that are *very highly* skewed in your favor.**

I wouldn't be surprised if whoever edited wikipedia (though age at least seems to be correct according to [princeton encyclopedia of classical sites](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0006%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DI%3Aentry+group%3D1%3Aentry%3Diader) ) was being partisan but the broad point should stand. 

map of our (its my hometown :D ) tiny sea empire, a while after its conquest by romans: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadar#mediaviewer/File:Liburnia_1st_AD.png 

Even though a settlement seems to have existed in modern Split in earlier antiquity as a colony of Issa(Vis), Salona, some 5km away, is the more important center in that region until the modern settlement develops around Diocletian's palace - only in 4ct AD.

What does that have to do with anything? The fact is a ton of countries accept alternate currencies for energy. The US does not want to ""invade"" Iran ""badly"".

Your ex-Chancellor went against the interests of many of his European partners and oddly took an executive position at the Gazprom subsidiary he created when he lost an election. 

The US is attempting to deescalate the situation in Iran, and it imports and refines a significant amount of Venezuelan oil. Also, it is worth noting, the EU took the lead on Iranian sanctions. Perhaps it also has concerns about the Iranian nuclear program.

The federal states of Germany are responsible for education, so the laws and fees differs from state to state.
A few years ago there were tuition fees of up to 500€ per semester in many states. But most of them are gone now.

Regarding the costs: Sure, a university has higher costs for each student. But usually the amount of students for each degree is fixed beforehand. If more people apply, there will be a selection. If there aren't enough people applying, they might consider to reduce the amount of students in the upcoming years. The basic idea is, to allow the ""best"" applicants to study.

Universities used to look at such things from a scientific point of view, in that they wanted to accelarate the generation of knowledge. The nationality of a student is not important in this context.

Dans cette historiographie, Danton est le représentant des bourgeois et Robespierre du peuple. Ils sont tous les deux clairement révolutionnaires et contre le régime féodal, mais s'opposent sur la nouvelle distribution des pouvoirs, que Danton veut réserver à une élite. Quel crédit donner à cette hitoriographie ? Elle a clairement des biais, mais elle a un mérite: celui de rétablir certaines vérités voire même de dénoncer certains mensonges. Robespierre était pour l'égalité des sexes et des races (il dénonçait l'esclavagisme) et contre la guerre. Il avait des idées résolument modernes au sujet de la démocratie et des droits de l'homme. La liste des causes avant-gardistes qu'il a soutenu est réellement hallucinante.

Du point de vue de l'extrême gauche, la révolution française a été confisquée par la bourgeoisie. Les héros réellement populaires, réellement démocrates, ont été traîné dans la boue et on a pour eux inventé le mot [""terroriste""](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorisme#Histoire_du_mot).

Nota: j'expose le point de vue mais je ne suis pas sùr d'y adhérer.

The thing is, the French revolution is at the core of the French political identity. In the 19th century, it was first written by nationalists to explain how great and superior the French are and how our ideas should spread everywhere. 

The marxists disagreed and pointed (rightly so) a few lies and propaganda in the official history. However, the interpretation they propose (or rather, claim as the correct one) can also be criticized: they see the revolution as an episode of class warfare between the people who grabbed power in 1789 (the bourgeois) and those who did in 1792 (the people). The bourgeois were largely presented as the good guys in official history, and the marxists argue it is the other way around.

My advice would be to read something positive about Danton and something positive about Robespierre, who were two influential politicians of the time.

My personal opinion is that the marxist version corrected some lies and biases but probably left the one it liked.

I don't sympathize with the Russian position on the current crisis...at all... but some people view the conflict like this:

""People felt that the coup overrode the democratic process and they feel their voices were ignored. People who identify as Russians were suddenly made strangers in their own country. So what they do is rebel against the government coup to take control over their own lands and join the team they agree with.""

Some people view the ""DPR"" as people resisting fascism. I don't agree with it, because I view it the way the West has framed it. Whenever some group arises in armed rebellion (especially with support from external powers) it will create a divisive issue.

Basically: of course /r/Russia is completely on board. Look at /r/europe for fuck's sake, it's really not much different here. We just view our information as correct, and their information as insane propaganda.

And I still don't follow you on the relative wealth argument, as far as I can see, statistically, the levels of GDP and GDP per capita in the countries of my graph were relatively similar. Back then and right now.

I totally agree with the notion that poor countries see higher relative levels of GDP growth, simply because their 'baseline' is lower and thus a rise in GDP shows up as a larger difference in percentages. But you cannot make this argument if you want to compare the UK to France and Germany (or even Italy). All of them were wealthy 15 years ago and all of them are wealthy now, there was no significant 'catch up' to skew the stats.  But for argument's sake, let me run the numbers.





 | GDP 2000 | GDP 2013 | Diff % | GDP P/C 2000 | GDP P/C 2013 | Diff P/C %

France| € 353,977.00 | € 512,745.00 | +44.85% | € 22,600.50 | € 43,000.00 | +90.26%

United Kingdom | € 398,457.10 | € 479,577.10 | +20.36% | € 25,415.30 | € 39,567.40 | +55.68%

Source: [Eurostat](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=namq_gdp_c&amp;lang=en), [IMF World Economic Outlook 2014](http://knoema.com/pjeqzh/gdp-per-capita-by-country-1980-2013)

If you look at GDP Per Capita and growth, you'll find very similar numbers in 2000 and in 2013. 

And now my argument, again, is that during this period the 'swings' up and down of GDP were higher (inherently) for the UK than they were for France, Germany and Italy. And because of this volatility the UK saw more periods with higher growth (and more were periods where GPD shrunk more). 

Thus, when we see quarterly growth rates like +3.2% for the UK and +0.8% for Germany, in the larger context you cannot conclude that this is inherent to the fact that one is in the Eurozone and the other is not, because both saw a high level of growth during the larger time period.

Now, for final food for thought, look at this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_growth_1980%E2%80%932010

You can see that Italy, Germany and France grew more than the UK in 2000-2010 in **absolute** terms. Even Spain did.

Professionally, German isn't very important. Half the people at our institute speak very little German, and most of the papers and literature are in English anyway (as you certainly know). Everyone will just switch to English if someone is present who doesn't speak German.

That being said, I agree with /u/maisels, you need a sensible command of the German language to get around. Most people with a higher education background speak at least enough English to communicate, but outside that, with people who don't have a higher education, the ability to use English decreases rapidly, as will the willingness to switch to English for you. So for your social life, and for simple things like getting your hair cut or grocery shopping, you will need to know some German.

Another, possibly more important area you need German for is the legal realm. In particular, your work contract will be in German, as are all the pertinent laws. And being unable to understand either might easily get you in trouble.

So, in conclusion, you will be able to get by without perfect German at first, but I don't recommend coming here without knowing any German at all. During your stay here, however, it is imperative that you immerse yourself in the culture and speak German as much as you can, and only fall back to English if you have no other choice, and take an active interest in improving your language skills.

but this EU doesn't work. for me, it doesn't represent the people, be them italians, germans, polish or whatnot. it's a mirror of faulty policies that were problematic already in theory and turned out to serve only a minority, both economically, and culturally.

we don't have a european culture more than we did in the 1950s. we not only don't have a linear foreign policy (in democracy, discussion and different ideas should always be welcomed, but then there should be one outcome, or there's simply no decision), but more often then not, the EU is non existent or we actually act like countries, individually, not as a union. we don't have common degrees (I'm *still* waiting for my UK degree to be accepted in italy, after 4 years.........). we don't have a common stance on social security, work, development, environment.

one could say that we don't have many of those things on a national level either, but at least there is more cohesion. in europe, other than empty words and basic concept (""we want to grant everyone a job, and gear towards progess"". wow, i can't name one politician that has never said that!), we have too little, in the wrong way.

Concerning marginal costs: It's just that, the cost of adding another student to the existing system, not dividing the total cost through x+1.

Have you ever been to a German university? Our auditorium hosts more than 1000 students and has bolted in chairs and desks (Average occupation is ~30%). There is one professor talking for 1,5h and then just leaves. Computers? How about a sheet of paper and a pencil, our library has about 100 computer desks for ~40k students. Many universities don't have a campus either, they just buy random houses (or decomissioned power plants) in the city and renovate them to host lectures. 

The main costs of universities that result in the 9000€ number are fixed costs not related to teaching, while of adding another student is fairly inexpensive.

Conerning language: There is of course nothing wrong with learning German. However B2 requires alot of effort just to get to the minimum level so you can apply. Then you have to actually move here and get you degree... Which is certainly a challange! (or crazy!)

Lo sai qual è la differenza tra un complottista/grillino e un'altra persona con altre idee? E' proprio come la ""religione"", (che poi al capitolo ""religione, complotti e grillismo"" possiamo scrivere un libro, ma andiamo avanti), ma religione in maniera ottusa, del tipo che chi non crede che Renzi sia al servizio degli economisti massoni va tolto, eliminato, è un idiota, è un colluso, è uno che non ci arriva, è uno che ha qualcosa in cambio dal sistema, è religione del tipo ""guerra santa"", del tipo jihad.
E' proprio questa ricerca dello scontro sia tra poveri cristi (chi di voi non ha mai discusso con un grillino?), che poi è una guerra in senso lato, ma anche un po' invocata da qualcuno (''*prendiamo i fucili, i forconi, serve una bomba in parlamento, diamo fuoco a Roma e vedi poi, italiani pecoroni*""), ma cercherei sempre una posizione dialogante e conciliante. 
Cioè quello che io vedo che manca al mondo grillino (dal capo -vedi messaggio di auguri a Bersani- al commentatore del FQ) è la capacità di riconoscere nell'altro, un fratello e non un nemico.

People who (vocally) opposed the oppressive government and suffered for it on the other hand probably don't appreciate those (often unrealistic) views.   

 A short anecdote to illustrate this : A few years ago I was at a tattoo convention. One of the tattoo artists, who was from the former GDR, had jokingly decorated his booth with a gigantic GDR flag. He (and many others) thought it was hilarious. My tattoo artist, also from the former GDR, was so pissed off he nearly got into a fight with him. He had spent the last three years of the GDR's existence in jail, a lot of it in solitary confinement, for being a 'social deviant'. For him seeing the flag of the dictatorial government under whose rule that happened displayed in such an ignorant and almost proud manner was extremely offensive.

Many Germans expect you to be humble if you asked something and got an answer that goes beyond Yes or No.

Anyway:

* Yep education is a basic human right, we want educated people for an educated society. Personally I prefer paying for foreigners coming here to learn something rather than unemployed Germans, but in essence the concept of social market economy worked very well for us, so why change anything about it.

* Germany is part of the EU and Schengen, so usually no checkpoints at our borders. However the US is a lot bigger than Germany, so for us moving to France is a shorter trip than from Houston to Atlanta... Think of countries in the sense of states in the EU. I can't visit Dubai without going through passport inspection either.

* The US and Germany are both offering opportunity... While the means may differ the general idea of attracting people from other countries is not so different. Also very few people go to the US to study at public universities, everyone want's to go to the private ones and they don't care where you are from as long as you provide the cash!

They probably are, but you need to understand that not everybody agrees with them. You're used to one particular way of thinking: you have been brought up in one culture with one basic set of values, and so you have been taught to think in this specific way. Now that you are, as the Germans say, ""looking over the edge of the plate"" -- that is, looking beyond your own culture -- you're having to deal with the fact that different cultures have radically different values and different priorities, because they have been taught differently. If you then crash in with the firm belief that your particular way of thinking is the *only* ""legit"" way of thinking, you will be judged to be arrogant, intolerant and ignorant. That's why you're being downvoted.

&gt; Germans seem to believe education is a basic human right

Correct; they do. And so do many, many other cultures.

&gt; [foreigners] don't pay taxes

Actually, foreigners do pay taxes and support the local economy. Hopefully, once foreigners have completed their education, they stay on and start earning money. Even if they don't, there are enough Germans doing the same in other countries, so it roughly balances out. As long as the German economy can take it, there's no need to deny foreign citizens some of the benefits.

&gt; going to a neighbour country is no big deal

You're thinking of the Schengen Area, which comprises most of the EU member states plus one or two other countries. These countries have signed an agreement which allow greater freedom of movement, which also means harmonizing immigration and customs regulations. In point of fact, if you do cross one of the borders, you still have to take a passport or government ID with you. The checkpoints still exist, they're just not usually manned. But there are still strict controls on entering and leaving the Schengen Area, just as there are for other countries. The system can be compared to the US, which is basically a confederation of 50 states, and you have complete freedom of movement between states. You are likely a citizen of a US state as well as being a citizen of the US as a whole. In the same way, a German is a citizen of Germany as well as being a citizen of the EU as a whole.

&gt; USA can force you to stay if redflag your passport and ban you from leaving ports or airports.

The same is true of Germany. I am a British citizen living in Germany, and even as an EU citizen I could in theory be forceably repatriated to the UK; or I could be ordered to remain in Germany. Of course, I could just drive over the border, but the next time I book myself into a hotel (in many countries I have to show ID to do that), or use a credit card or ATM -- they've got me.

&gt; no.1 country in the world

And here is where your downvotes are coming from: this attitude. If you've been spoonfed this and swallowed it without even having left the US to see for yourself, you'll be regarded with contempt from every non-US citizen in the entire world. There is no ""number one"" country in the world. In terms of wealth distribution, economic performance, crime rates and access to health care, Germany outperforms the US. In terms of taxation and personal freedoms, the US is probably better than Germany.

A possible source of confusion that you should be aware of is the names given to some of the notes. In German, the scale of C major traditionally goes like this: C - D - E - F - G - A - H - C.

That is to say that the note we call B natural is known to Germans as H. And the note that we call B flat is known to Germans simply as B. However, on the actual stave the notes are written exactly as you'd expect, so he'll be able to read the music without any problem.

Also, rather than writing ""C♯"" or ""G♭"", Germans write ""Cis"" or ""Ges"". This shouldn't be a problem, as any German will immediately grasp what ""G♭"" means, but for reference the chromatic scale in German goes:

C Cis D Dis E F Fis G Gis A Ais H C

or:

C Des D Es E F Ges G As A B H C

true,pharmaceus,null,null,"There's nothing inherently wrong with a federated Europe any more than there's with any other state (state=legalized violence).

The current argument against it is nothing else than (typically large) **nation-states trying to hold on to as much power over the people as possible**. The conflict is between nation-states and the EU and not between ""the people"" and the EU. **The nation states do not represent the people any more than the current bureaucracy in Brussels** the exception - to some extent - being Switzerland. Anyone who claims otherwise clearly has no idea about their own political system.  

Europe had a short nationalist period in its history typically between 1800 to 2000 and never one that encompassed the whole of Europe at the same time until European integration started after WW2. Those ""national"" structures also forcibly integrated smaller political entities so any argument that the EU is ""illegitimate"" is completely idiotic from the historical perspective.  

The issue with federal Europe is the foundations of the political system. The current  EU is an international organization set up by treaties. As such it is ill-designed to run a day-to-day affairs of a large political entity. It needs to be gotten rid of immediately. Federal Europe needs to be a democratic process with accountability to the people through transparent structures and safeguards against popular stupidity. It needs to avoid the trappings of executive power so no single individual should have power in Federal Europe. I would think it needs a *large* democratic parliament and an elected federal council which collectively acts as a ""president"" (Swiss-style). 

There are dangers of federated government - most notably the **centralization of power** (which is true for *every* government) at the expense of smaller bodies which will wipe away any benefits **just as it happened in America** where the states are little more than traditional structures with all the important decisions taking place almost entirely at the federal level.  The Us government started out as a limited one and grew to an entity of gargantuan proportions in a process that is very well analysed and described. Europe needs to learn from that. IMO Europe needs a Swiss model of highly decentralized federal government with clear but limited federal function delegated from the state level and *not* from the people *directly*. People delegate powers to the states and *then* from the states to the federation (and can withdraw their consent) but supervise through elections and referenda *directly*.

Second big danger is foreign policy - a huge political entity will immediately fall victim to corrupting influences of the banks and big business which will most likely lead to wars. Wars are the best instrument of wealth and power transfer from the people to the elites. That needs to be counterbalanced by hard limits on campaign financing and large elected body at a federal level. **There should be a MEP for every 50-70k citizens**. It seems like a lot but that's the price for keeping more power with the people as opposed to the corruptible few. The MEPs with a parliament that is purely representative and does not engage in too much bureaucratic procedure will be cheaper than the current EU commission even with 10 000 representatives.  And think how difficult it would be to corrupt 10000 politicians. Lobbyist have budgets too....  People complain that 10000 is too much for a coherent single political position but here's the catch. **We don't need any**. We only need enough consent to take care of things important to the EU as a whole - which can be dealt even through pan-European referenda because believe me for those things there will be a majority.  Anything else - commonly misunderstood by ignorant people as ""governing a country"" is essentially screwing people over and lying about it. Just check the recent American history for confirmation. *Every single time*

Federal EU should have no monopoly on anything within Europe. It should have no army of its own - only a command over national forces, no federal legislation other than coordination of national legislation. Ideally it should have no single monetary system because euro is just an unsustainable scam like most of modern banking.
It should have no power to incur public debt - national debts are bad enough already. **But it should have a common voice of the people so that the people of Europe could override the shenanigans of national governments when they refuse to play along**. 

That's the main idea behind federal Europe - a political entity to **check the powers of national governments in their unending thirst for more power, more money and more influence... just as national governments should be a check and balance of the federal Europe**. We need to remember why EU was thought to be a good thing initially - it was because it were **national governments** which caused death and destruction in Europe. Such divided system requires *consent* to rule - rather than smartly circumventing the rules and public opinion. It was the removal of such system of checks and balances over time ( most notably around the two major wars - Civil War and WW1) which introduced modern, police-state America for the rich and the powerful. With the above principles in place Europe has a good 100-150 years ahead of itself before everything starts going to hell.  By which time the world will be long overdue some other major socio-technological revolution which will obsolesce current political systems.

Nessuno studio di nessuna autorità prevede un calo dei consumi rispetto all'attuale in nessun Paese da qui al 2030. Nessuno, e proprio nessuno, prevede che ridurremo i consumi e le libertà individuali da qui al 2030, in particolare per questioni di ""diritti"".

(e.g. https://www.entsoe.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/_library/publications/entsoe/So_AF_2013-2030/130403_SOAF_2013-2030_final.pdf ,pag. 7)

&gt; E perché ignori che, per esempio, alle grandi fabbriche europee è fatto obbligo di limitare le proprie emissioni (un esempio di come la produzione è limitata da una decisione del governo).

Sbagli per una serie di motivi. Non è la produzione ad essere limitata ma l'emissione di CO2, questo vuol dire che nessuno obbliga nessuno a consumare meno petrolio, o cacao o grano o altre materie prime, solo ad emettere meno CO2 qui. Chiediti se emettere meno CO2 qui in europa voglia dire

&gt;  una sana politica di limitazione dei consumi e delle richieste.individuali, o saremo costretti a scontrarci in futuro con una seria ""carestia"".

Perché non inquinare il fosso o l'aria circostanti l'azienda mi sembra il minimo che si possa chiedere.

Fino a prova contraria la domanda di cellulari, vestiti alla moda, consolle, carburanti,ecc... ha seguito, segue e seguirà la domanda del mercato, ed è pure incrementata globalmente. Quindi nessun riequilibrio.

&gt; Tutti quelli che hai.citato, Rand a.parte prevedevano regolazioni del libero mercato, perché riconoscevano le storture dei rapporti di forza. 

Io il capitalismo so cos'è. Allora, per me capitalismo è teoria del valore soggettivo, proprietà privata e incontro domanda-offerta. non è necessario avere l'anarchia capitalista per avere il libero mercato.

Ora i tizi di sopra afferiscono alla scuola austriaca, che si è sdoppiata poi in Scuola di Chicago (www.cato.org) e Misesiani (www.mises.org). I primi non li conosco benissimo ma so per certo che del tuo amico Malthus se ne fregano (e.g. http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/president-obamas-malthusian-new-deal-recovery-not) . Gli altri sono ancora più per il libero mercato, al limite dell'anarco capitalismo (e.g. ""If the State takes the power of disposal from the owner piecemeal, by extending its influence over production... then the owner is left at last with nothing except the empty name of ownership, and property has passed into the hands of the State."" L. von Mises - Socialism p. 45). Ma se non mi credi, cerca pure diversamente.

Il fatto è che io ti ho citato i Kiss, gli Slipknot, i Rammstein e tu mi hai risposto che anche loro preferiscono la techno in discoteca, mica come quella cogliona della cantante dei Sonata Artica!. Epic Fail

&gt; Ignori anche che al ministero degli esteri frega cazzi se io metto o no il cappotto, tanto pago io: gli interessa di dover meno partecipare alle accaparramento di risorse.

Infatti le politiche economiche ed energetiche le fa il ministero dell'economia, non quello degli esteri o quello dell'interno.


Cosa fa il ministero degli esteri per CO2 e ""accaparramento risorse""???

Illuminami: ci sono disposizioni anche per il consumo di terre rare, combustibili,ecc o solo per la produzione di CO2? Dove sono? Perché finora hai addotto questioni che possono sembrare correlate solo ad un profano.

Rispondi a questo:

&gt; sono disposto a darti fiducia. Dimmi cosa sarebbe l'economia e la società nel tuo mondo ideale, perche io non vedo come portare qui pochi milioni di disperati e abbandonarli a se stessi risolva il problema.

.

&gt; Vedi, non sei razzista perché fai il finto capitalista: 

Talmente finto che so chi propone il capitalismo e chi no. 

&gt; sei razzista perché affermi che.salvare vite umane sia minimamente da mettere in discussione, che lo stato potrebbe anche non fare l'""onlus"". 

Il problema non è decidere se salvare vite umane, ma quante e come. E lo Stato non può dedicare tutto a fare la onlus perché ha già il dovere di fare i miei interessi. Le risorse pubbliche sono per me cittadino, non per salvare vite umane al di fuori della nazione.
Il che vuol dire che mi può andar bene fare cooperazione internazionale e yadda yadda, ma non voglio mettere a disposizione qualunque risorsa necessaria.

Per te invece dovremmo fare ""tutto il possibile"" (deciso da chi? quanto? continui a non rispondere). Bene. 

Tornando a bomba: tu chi sei per dire che lo stato deve fare l'onlus coi miei soldi? Lo so, ci si sveglia la mattina, si nota il proprio motivo geometrico e si deduce di essere unici e ganzi. Ok, agli altri non frega un cazzo. Non è che siccome tu hai delle belle idee forti allora lo Stato, che esiste per fare i miei interessi, si deve piegare al tuo volere. Tu non comandi nessuno.

Secondly, we require all government ministers to be elected members of parliament, again a principle that the EP does not apply.

Thirdly, the European Council are not elected on the basis of who they'd nominate for the Commission. They are free to pick and choose who they want well after they have been elected (or even elected by second degree).

""I do not think the E.U. should federalise itself. We [European Union] have done many bad things, like allowing countries as Poland, or the whole of Eastern- and Mediterranean-Europe for that matter! The best thing to do is to build a wall from the borders of Germany and Poland, down to Austria, excluding Italy, Eastern-Europe and France. Then we may be able to save this Union.""

However, the part of me that agrees with a Federal Europe says:

""Yes, centralise the government! This is a good idea! Now we are all equal, we share common Foreign Policy, Economic Policy and so forth! We become more united as a Europe Union, rather than Polish, French and German!""

Yet the part that disagrees with a Federal Europe is:

""No, no, no! We Dutch do not share all interest, morals and ethics with Polish people, or Greek people! We want our culture to live on, and the German, British and everyone's too! We have fought so many years to establish this, and now we must abandon it?

Dicono che ing. inf. sia più difficile e abbia orari più pesanti, almeno da me. Il punto è che poi, finita l'uni, hai le stesse identiche possibilità e capacità. Diffida da chi ti dice che l'inf fa questo mentre l'ing fa quell'altro. Cazzate.

Europe is not ready for a federal state and there's still countries that haven't made up their minds fx. the UK.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt; In our country, we have such a thing as shadow cabinets. Parties in opposition must nominate the people that they would have assigned to be ministers would they have formed the government. Typically ministers are challenged by their shadow counterparts.
&gt; 
&gt; This informs the public on the direction that opposition parties could provide.
&gt; 
&gt; In the European Parliament, there is no compulsory expression of alternate policy. There is only the ruling coalition and no information on the opposition.

If the opposition parties wish to organize their opposition in such a way they can do so. The reason that it doesn't happen is likely that the EP is based on forming coalitions between a number of parties, so you don't know which coalition will make the bulk of the compromises next time, so it has little predictive value. If I was a diplomat, I'd say that it's just a different equivalent way to organize opposition. But actually I consider coalitions superior because they can more flexibly adapt themselves to current problems and they have less polarization and demonization compared with first-past-the-post systems. They don't force you to pick the second worst, but you can vote for the party that most closely matches your priorities and then the system'll pick up the signal.

&gt;Secondly, we require all government ministers to be elected members of parliament, again a principle that the EP does not apply.

Rightly, IMO. A good parliamentarian is not necessarily a good minister. Parliamentarians shouldn't see their stay in parliament as an unfortunate but unavoidable prelude to their career goal to become minister. Ministers or commissioners are, after all, just executives commissioned with running a certain department, Parliament is the ultimate arbiter of policy and it's a good that the legislative power remains critical of the executive power. 

It also allows us to pick experts in their domain who are otherwise not interested in or not capable of party politics to complete certain tasks.

&gt;Thirdly, the European Council are not elected on the basis of who they'd nominate for the Commission. They are free to pick and choose who they want well after they have been elected (or even elected by second degree). Similarly, the Parliament is not elected on the basis of which standard Commissioners they would approve or disapprove of.

In this case too, I consider it a good that elected representative houses have a separate dynamic and aren't just waiting rooms for candidate ministers/commissioners.",1,1408186541,null,0,false,0,cjrtowv,t3_2dpkg8,t1_cjrtowv,t1_cjrtg3u,null,1435265116,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

This doesn't apply if the prepositional phrase is on first (focused) position:

true,votapmen,SRPS,Република Српска — Republika Srpska,"&gt;Western political influence of human rights, rule of law, democracy and prosperity 

If you're talking about the U.S. which has the biggest influence on the politics of the Western world, mentioning human rights, rule of law, democracy and prosperity is absurd.

If you're talking about EU, the situation is better when it comes to those things, however on the economic front, the EU is devastating to the sovereignty of small nations in the long run, simply because they can't economically compete on the free market with the much stronger and more advanced economies of countries like Germany and Britain.

They do see what appears to be a growth of GDP and personal living standard, but people often disregard is the growing debt of those countries.

Take for example the ""success story of EU"" -- Poland. They've seen their GDP grow, but their [external debt has risen from ~35% of GDP in 2000 to ~70% in 2014](http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?SERIES_KEY=118.DD.Q.PL.BP_EXTD.PGDP.4F_N).

This means that if Poland is unable to pay off it's debt, their loaners will be able to dictate their internal policies, which they will obviously use for their personal benefit.

This means loss of sovereignty, loss of national identity, less influence on politics by the country's citizens and more by some outside entities, like IMF, foreign governments, etc., and soon enough the country is in debt slavery which leads to austerity measures and decrease in living standards of average citizens.

This is a never ending cycle, because the country now needs foreign investment to get back on its feet, which creates foreign dependency and leads to new increase in foreign political influence, which is always beneficial to the foreign entity.

All this leads to growing materialism and individualism at the expense of national identity and spiritual values (not in a religious sense).

Add to that the possible federalization of the EU, and you have full-blown Americanization of Europe -- which means consumerism, quasi-democracy, rule of the € instead of the rule of law, corporate influence on politics, money as a goal instead of money as a means, prosperity for the rich and possibly the poor that are unscrupulous enough, debt slavery for the rest, loss of personal rights, etc.

Russia is at least independent from the foreign influence, and when the Russians become dissatisfied with the situation in their country and realize that it's caused by the oligarchs that rule it, they will get rid of them, and install true democracy, but that democracy will not be dictated by some foreign influence so that it benefits that foreign entity, but rather by the people of Russia so that it benefits them.",0,1408188505,null,0,1408188781,0,cjru17h,t3_2dphbk,t1_cjru17h,t1_cjrt7po,null,1435265276,-8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-8

The EU uses 1% of GDP while on average 40% of GDP is taxed in the EU. If you want to look for excess government expenditure, you ought to look at the states because they use 39 times more and provide less legislative services.

Because EU member states have veto rights on many issues in the name of sovereignty.

And what it actually was: http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/03/world/europe/ukraine-luhansk-building-attack/

«The authorities in Kiev denied its planes had been involved. Initially, the anti-terrorist operation said the explosion originated from inside the building, then that an anti-aircraft missile operated by the separatists had misfired, reacting to heat from an air-conditioning system on the outside of the building.

But a CNN investigation in Luhansk has found clear evidence that whatever detonations hit the building and the adjoining park came from the air. The tops of trees were splintered, and a series of small craters -- about a dozen -- had been blasted in a straight line, starting in the park and reaching the walls of the building, blowing out many of its windows and spraying the area with jagged shrapnel. That's what appears to have killed most of the victims and injured 20 more.»

The problem is that it didn't stay within the rich countries who had all the high tech and huge resource supplies, it then became convenient to include smaller countries because that would facilitate trades to the buyer countries and from the '80s or so until now only the dimension of the 'convenience' has changed - richer countries would 'invest' in poorer countries like banks do and hoping to profit from both the sales they make to them but also from the interest - until the debt was so huge and the money simply so impossible to unobtain that the subprime crisis was the perfect trigger.

EU prouds itself to be a pylon of mobility and opportunity but that would only truelly happen in a transnational centralized model of government but that implies making sacrifices - everyone would have to be ENTIRELLY dependent of the surplus of capital from the richer countries which would then be sent to the ones in debt and thus dim the deficit (much like the relationship between east coast and california), we would have to build a TRUELLY european identity among countries that have only known rivalry between them (of course the ukranian conflict would be perfect for that like the American Civil War was - to unite everyone under one banner - but it seems too 'cruel' for anyone to admit it). 
But on the positive side there would be less clashes between the countries (hypothetically) since we would all have to agree with each other while still having to find a way to make policies that fit each country's needs and current tech and human resources.

Another problem to this visionary idea is that there's a hidden rivalry between the countries, each other battling to the one that all will depend upon, with everyone still clinging to their own history even if all the past conflicts are somewhat forgotten.

No forse la tua visione è miope. Ci sono dei trattati internazionali e umanitari da rispettare. Paesi come la germania e l'inghilterra hanno subito fenomeni migratori peggiori del nostro.

&gt;Ora una visione aggregata, si potrebbe dire keynesiana o socialista, direbbe che lo Stato e la società hanno bisogno di più giovani, che contribuiscano, ovvero sgancino soldi.blalbalblalbalbalbalblalba

Wow eri attento all'università. Chissà se nascevi sulla sponda sbagliata continuavi a fare il liberale. Da come parli non segui una linea politica/economica perché la ritieni la migliore o la più GIUSTA, ma quella che conviene più a te. Scusami perché non emigri in america se ti piace così tanto il liberalismo? Ah, aspetta...senza la carta verde non puoi rimanere. Chissà se i tuoi studi sono abbastanza utili da poter essere sfruttati lì. Il massimo che puoi fare e farti un giro a new york da buon turistidiota inneggiando discorsi esterofili e qualunquisti sull'american dream dal basso contentuo attuale. Ah...se ti tengono però...ANCORA MEGLIO.

&gt; In entrambi i casi il problema non è della popolazione. Se nessuno vuole raccogliere pomodori (http://www.internazionale.it/news/inchiesta/2014/06/26/il-lato-oscuro-del-pomodoro-italiano/) o compri una macchina o chiudi bottega. Non sei nessuno per decidere di voler assumere schiavi di cui ti occupi solo nelle 8 ore in cui lavorano nella tua azienda del menga, lasciando il resto ai contribuenti italiani. Se non bastano i contribuenti attuali per mantenere lo Stato allora lo Stato chiede troppo e amministra coi piedi.

Mamma che populismo da 4 soldi. Dici ai tuoi genitori che hanno buttato i soldi per la scuola. Non è vero che gli ""italiani"" non vogliono lavorare nei campi. I lavoratori italiani ""costano troppo"" e allora per lavorare i campi viene utilizzata della manodopera semischiavizzata in modo che l'azienda sia sempre competitiva con i prezzi (ragionamento in puro stile capitalista).

&gt; Se non bastano i contribuenti attuali per mantenere lo Stato allora lo Stato chiede troppo e amministra coi piedi.

SSTAto-Stato e mmbuti su Rieducation Channel (scusami c'erano troppi Stato nella frase). Sul fatto che amministra con i piedi sono d'accordo con te ma per i motivi che ho precedentemente esposto: non combatte questo sfruttamento della manodopera straniera.

* It, like all governments, doesn't know how to fix the new economic problems we're facing.

* It makes it harder for citizens to make real change in their countries. A citizen's involvement in democracy gets progressively more insignificant the larger the country/population.

* Looking at all the European parties in the EP, I feel pretty sad at the thought that those are our political future. They all seem pretty much the same to me, as evidenced by the fact that the so-called Socialists are working with the so-called Conservatives. It, like all governments, will be another race to the centre of the spectrum.

No, any definition of ""liberal"" is fine. Conservatism is one tendency of liberalism.

&gt; Again, you make a claim but have nothing to back it up. RT is fabricating stories left and right - white phosphorus in Donetsk, thousands of Ukrainian refugees on Russian borders - with the singular aim of improving Russia's PR (sometimes by lowering ""The West's"").

And the West fabricates stories about the DPRK (which I'm not a fan of) left and right as well. It's exactly the same thing, but western news sources are unapologetic about what they write. Basically anything you read that's pertinent to the DPR Korea is most likely false. This is clearly to discredit the north Korean State as some kind of ""hermit kingdom"" or whatever and at the same time alters the US' behaviour towards the DPRK to look as if they're doing the right thing (which they aren't).

&gt; I do not see an akin corroborated effort from the ones you mentioned, or from the media of the western world, so I'm just gonna assume you're just being edgy until you provide sources for your claim.

Do you want me to show you examples of this type of thing in relation to the DPRK? Okay then. What you're missing here is just because RT is linked officially to the Russian State doesn't mean that the links between said western news agencies are just as strong. I just gave you a link demonstrating these extremely close ties between western states and their agencies, but you've ignored it for some reason. What does ""corroborated effort"" even mean? Do you mean ""collaboration""?

[Here is a left well-sourced article regarding the outright lies told about the DPRK](http://anti-imperialism.com/2014/08/14/western-dprk-propaganda-the-worst-occasionally-hilarious-and-often-racist-lies/). You can take it with a grain of salt if you want, but the point is to demonstrate that things like RT are no better or worse than the western agencies that get revered on this subreddit, not to say that the DPRK is fantastic.

Of course they do. Your vote has more power if its's 1 from 30 000 000 possible than when it's 1 from 350 000 000 possible. And most countries are even smaller than Poland, and you get only 5 000 000 voters or so.

The political debates in differen EU countries aren't even ABOUT THE SAME THINGS. If you had one huge country instead of 25 small ones most of these debates would cease to exist (but the underlying problems wouldn't) - you can't have elections with 100 political parties with reasonable time dedicated to each of them. The most important problem for Irish people won't matter for all the rest, same with problems of MOST of the EU population.

In the end the whole EU will only talk about what's important for France and Germany, and maybe a few fringe parties from other countries would get some time. All the others would be ingnored and their problems unsolved forever.

This is the exact opposite of what we need to make democracy better. We need more local democracy not less.

Unfortunately though, the media outrage has shifted from governments collaborating in wholesale spying operations on ordinary people to governments spying on other governments.

&gt; Over one million people in Spain - the eurozone's fourth largest economy - haven't had a job since 2010, according to a report by Spain's National Statistics Institute. Although this number continues to rise, the government says it's witnessing recovery.

&gt; The numbers, published on May 23, show that “very long-term unemployment” in the country has risen by more than 500 percent since 2007. That year, about 250,000 Spaniards were unemployed after losing their job at least three years prior. That number drastically rose to 1.27 million in 2013 - 234,000 more than in 2012.

&gt; Generally, long-term unemployment includes jobless workers who have not been employed for more than 27 weeks. The recent study shows that this category in Spain has transformed to very long-term unemployment, with hundreds of thousands people without a job for at least three years, and is now represented by over 23 percent of the total jobless population in Spain.

&gt; The number is much higher than in other countries in the region at the same economic level, with another recent study showing that 26 percent of the country's population is on government benefits in Spain - the second highest total in the EU after Greece.",0,1408192241,null,0,1408192626,0,cjrurqy,t3_2donjs,t1_cjrurqy,t3_2donjs,null,1435265624,4,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,4

It doesn't matter if it's satire or not. It serves the same purpose. The ""Kim-Jong-Un"" haircut pop-fact jokes still become a thing whether or not they were originally satircal. That's the point.

If ""International Business Daily"" isn't the most western-sounding news agency/magazine/journal/whatever I've ever heard then I must be missing something. You asked me to give examples, and I did. 

KTAR: ""the voice of Arizona"". Yeah, pretty fucking western.

I gave you three different examples of both local and extremely popular western agencies doing exactly what I described and you've brushed that off as ""competing to be the first to bring the news"". Incredibly dishonest, and it just goes to show how shit markets (or state agencies) are at distributing the truth. Why might that be? Oh, that's right, that's not even what their goal is.

In the Netherlands, when a politician or the government does something that the majority doesn't like he is forced with soft power to change it. 

This 'soft' power is media, the internet, unions, important people/organisations. And of course the 'hard' power is voting someone out. 

But there is no European media that checks the EU commission. There are no European Unions (labour unions) that speak for *all* Europeans. Everyone in Europe fights for his own. 

So in conclusion:

* Too far away from the people they suppose to represent.
* Everyone will fight for his own interests.
* There is no European media that checks the EU. All media check the part that affects the country they are from. (Media = crucial for a democracy)
* No one feels 'European'. And that is not a bad thing. We are not one culture, and we shouldn't pretend to be. 
* No more benchmarking between countries. (Here in NL we *always* compare ourselves to how Germany is doing and then adjust our actions. Keeps everyone sharp.)
* A Federal EU would be a heaven for lobbyists. Just like in the US you now need to lobby only one government to affect 500 million people. We mustn't want that.

While I agree that in the long run liberalization of commerce and a strong united front are the way to go, there's the fact that the results of the preliminary phases aren't encouraging to all.

While the EU may have beneficied some countries greatly, there are others that have resulted greatly impoverished (I live in Italy, and I testify that our prices doubled with the introduction of the Euro and that the Austerity measures just worsened the crisis, since they were the opposite of what our economy needed) and they found -still do- most of their tries to change the situation blocked by a three monkeys union who can't seem to understand that what measures worked for Germany may not necessarily work for different economies.

There's also the little fact that when the USA formed, the first thing they did was put together their debt. This has been tried in the UE but vetoed more than once by Germany and supported by other northern countries.

The Eurosceptics aren't opposed to the concept of an united europe, they're opposed to an Europe where a few countries can influence all the others without a way of fighting back (just a few weeks ago the Juncker-led party coalition decided to do away with the rule and not give opposition even one commission presidency, for example), and who want all the benefits of it but none of the dues (like with immigration, where the general rule seems to be to leave everything to the mediterrean countries and sanction them when they don't have the resources to properly handle it, when the solution is to stop these trips from even happening and that can't be done by a country on its own).",0,1408194248,null,0,false,0,cjrv8lk,t3_2dpkg8,t1_cjrv8lk,t3_2dpkg8,null,1435265871,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Adesso ho un collega di 19 e uno di 23 anni che sono entrati come stagisti (poi assunti per 3 anni come me) mentre facevano il CCNA.

Quanto costa? Se ne trovano a tutti i prezzi. Dai 200 ai 2000. Ma come al solito, se uno costa X e un'altro 10X, c'è un motivo. Io ho fatto entrambi i corsi a suon di 2000€ l'uno. Tre settimane dopo averli finiti avevo uno stage che me li ha ripagati tutti e due, sei mesi dopo un contratto. Ripeto, ho due colleghi che hanno trovato lavoro durante il corso. Io ammetto che non ci avevo nemmeno provato.

Forse ho avuto culo. Quello ci vuole sempre. Però boh... dopo aver buttato due anni all'università dietro analisi e geometria 1 a ingegneria informatica ti posso dire che, almeno finora, non m è servita proprio a nulla.

Certo, ho colleghi ingegneri usciti dal politecnico, alcuni con la lode. Ma... cos'hanno in più di me? Forse una gran determinazione, se hanno finito la laurea. Non mi sembra di aver ancora incontrato nulla cui loro potessero arrivare e io no. E quando sei lì davanti al rack a tenere su 30 kg di router mentre l'altro li avvita o ti devi calare nel pavimento flottante a cercare i cavi giusti non c'è laurea che tenga. Ci vuole senso pratico.

Non lo dico per criticare le università o le lauree. Anzi. Tanto di cappello. Ma le lauree informatiche in italia non valgono un tubo. Esci e... ""Sai cos'è l'handshake TCP?"" sguardi vuoti. ""172.16.0.0/29, primo e ultimo host, subnet mask."" ""Che stai a dì?""

Sure, there are some parts where the train could go 300, but it has to pass mountains, restrictions, ... 160 km/h is an average we could aim for.... while moving at top speed. However, a train has to slow down for stations, have a 10min stop...

Say we have a fictional railway with about 17 stops between Constanta and Lisbon (Bucharest, Craiova, Belgrade, Osijek, Zagreb, Ljubljana, Trieste, Venice, Parma, Genova, Nice, Marseille, Montpellier, Toulouse, Bilbao, Valladolid, Salamanca).
Assume an average cruising speed of 160km/h, an average deceleration of 5m/s^2 and an average acceleration of 3m/s^2.
Each stop would require 90s, say 2 minutes of slowing down while covering 2 to 3 km and 150s or make it 3 minutes of accelerating to 160 km/h while covering about 4 km.

All this decelerating, stopping and accelerating adds about 4 to 5 hours to your total trip, for a total of about 24 hours. Meanwhile Google Maps tells me that by car the car takes about 40 hours. The train wins without contest.

However, say there is no direct train (seems very unlikely actually), so you have a few stops, waits for a few hours, slow trains etc...

true,iisno1uno,LITH,Lithuania,"again, you are talking rubbish. reading delfi much?

the purpose of RailBaltic is not to connect Baltic countries with each other, rather to connect Baltic region to the Western Europe. 

that's why RailBaltic I is being built in Poland and Lithuania. Poland is upgrading current rail network, because infrastructure nowadays allows only 80km/h speed or something in that range. Lithuania is building 160km/h gauge upto Kaunas.

RailBaltic II is part of RailBaltic project, however it is kinda separate, cause it needs cooperation of our 3 governments (till this point Estonia and Latvia has not spent a single Euro for RailBaltic I project), that's why there are talks of creating international corporation, etc. 

&gt;Rail Baltic in Estonia means double track high-speed railway connection from Tallinn to Polish border with top speed of 240km/h

if by Estonia you mean ""dreamland I live in"" then yeah. in the real world no one will build that kind of network cause it's just a waste of money, and if seriously some Estonian government officials are pushing for it, it's obvious why more practical Lithuanians are not agreeing on that.

&gt;There already were problem that Lithuania wanted to change their previous decision so it would go through Vilnius instead of Kaunas

nope. everything Lithuania wanted was to include Vilnius into the technical project as was agreed before by all the governments. Lithuanians wanted to build Kaunas-Vilnius branch simultaneously while building Kaunas-Panevėžys-Tallinn, Estonians wanted to remove Vilnius altogether, which is obviously unreasonable since Vilnius is kinda biggest city in Lithuania, and capital too, if you forgot it. anyways, now it was agreed to postpone Kaunas-Vilnius connection till the very end.

&gt;There will be NO connection of Kaunas-Tallinn separately like the one currently being built in Lithuania (European gauge, single track, 160km/h). Kaunas will be the end of it.

don't even know what you mean by that. yes, now only Poland-Kaunas connection is being built. after it is finished Kaunas-Tallinn should start, however it's not looking very optimistic in the near future.

&gt;Okay, it may be called Rail Baltic I in YOUR country, but definitely not here. 

it is called like that in official documents, check it out. if you don't even know that I am not surprised you are so misinformed and talking BS.

&gt;And why should it? How is connecting Kaunas with Poland anything to do with Latvia or Estonia?

as I said, without connecting Kaunas-Poland you wouldn't have connection to Western Europe. so it's kinda important for Estonia and Latvia... don't you think so? also, while we will have connection to Europe in 1,5years tops, why should we hurry about connecting Latvia and Estonia? yeah, it would be beneficial for us too, however it's your problem to push it, and not ours. it's kinda understandable.",0,1408198588,null,0,false,0,cjrwgxl,t3_2dpqpg,t1_cjrwgxl,t1_cjrw6bt,null,1435452665,-6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-6

Vedi la mancanza di anarchia capitalista e deduci che il libero mercato non esiste. 

Adesso al ministero, dove sei de casa, altroché, siccome ""discutono di economia"" salta fuori che c'è un piano, condiviso dalla parte sana del paese, mica il popolino leghista con la 2a media, per redistribuire risorse e accogliere, che mica possiamo farne a meno.

It relies on several factors you should take into consideration. First of all it is small and only caters short distances (Switzerland is small, along the major tracks maybe 5 hours). Second they value punctuality and actually included longer breaks at every major station ( 3-8 minutes) and even long breaks for small stations (up to 2 minutes). Due to this method a delayed train can catch up around 20 minutes for every hour it runs. I am not saying it is a bad system (it is awesome because you have very reliable transportation), but if you want to cover distances on the continental scale, you get a very slow train.

Here in Germany, regional culture is on a constant decline due to people becoming more international and losing touch with their roots. That's fine if someone consciously wants to do so, but I'm afraid we will slowly and subconsciously lose our internal cultural differences regardless of European developments.

That's something I just find sad - I love learning about the unique traits that people in a specific region have; my grandmother used to even be able to tell what village someone was from due to their dialect. It's awful that people are becoming more and more the same the world over - I _want_ differences between them, I _want_ that they have something unique. That's what gives the world its salt, else we would just be one bland, inoffensive, contourless mush.

But modern PC culture mistakes equality for identity in the literal sense; hence such moronic ideas as ""blindness to race"" in the US. People can - and should! - be vastly different, but equal; and that's just not something that will happen with increasing globalization. No EU government would be able to accommodate a country's specific traits in its legislation. Being German and looking at privacy, for instance, I wouldn't want to have a government that doesn't respect German sensitivities towards the topic. And I bet that pretty much every topic will be unique to some country in some way, so if you'd want to give autonomy in all those areas, a common government wouldn't de facto exist.

Agree with this point you make. That's because Cameron is talking out of the side of his mouth about reform in the EU, because it's impossible and it's also dishonest of him to suggest it.

Carswell is in the same UK political party (Conservative) but he is a genuine eurosceptic ie he's not sceptical of the EU, he's now Anti-EU, having concluded it's beyond reform. That is to distinguish the two points of view of these two politicians.

As for the article, I'm not entirely sure I agree with all Carswell says about the Single Market, certainly in the short-term it's an important trade partner for the UK.

As our economies are relying on consumption (unfortunatly), the easiest way to achieve economic growth is to give the people more opportunities to do so.

Sorry, but how are you going to connect Baltic region to *Central Europe without connecting them first? You know, Lithuania alone doesn't make up Baltic region.

&gt; that's why RailBaltic I is being built in Poland and Lithuania. Poland is upgrading current rail network, because infrastructure nowadays allows only 80km/h speed or something in that range. Lithuania is building 160km/h gauge upto Kaunas.

This is happening, yes, but this will not reach Latvia nor Estonia.

&gt; RailBaltic II is part of RailBaltic project, however it is kinda separate, cause it needs cooperation of our 3 governments (till this point Estonia and Latvia has not spent a single Euro for RailBaltic I project), that's why there are talks of creating international corporation, etc.

Whatever you call them, Rail Baltic I and II are absolutely separate projects. I am talking about the 240 km/h double track one. The 160 km/h will not reach Latvia/Estonia.

&gt; if by Estonia you mean ""dreamland I live in"" then yeah. in the real world no one will build that kind of network cause it's just a waste of money, and if seriously some Estonian government officials are pushing for it, it's obvious why more practical Lithuanians are not agreeing on that.

Dreamland?!? Lithuania has already accepted it and is part of the project! That's why we want to move on already, but Lithuania suddenly wanted to change their route.

&gt; nope. everything Lithuania wanted was to include Vilnius into the technical project as was agreed before by all the governments. Lithuanians wanted to build Kaunas-Vilnius branch simultaneously while building Kaunas-Panevėžys-Tallinn, Estonians wanted to remove Vilnius altogether, which is obviously unreasonable since Vilnius is kinda biggest city in Lithuania, and capital too, if you forgot it. anyways, now it was agreed to postpone Kaunas-Vilnius connection till the very end.

Nope, still not true. There were talks about taking Kaunas out of the project. And yes, Estonians didn't like that Lithuanians are adding some random project to Rail Baltic - making it more expensive and difficult -&gt; more difficult to get money from EU. Finally it was decided by EU that Vilnius can be added to the project, but not to the original Rail Baltic. Which means Estonians were right.

&gt; don't even know what you mean by that. yes, now only Poland-Kaunas connection is being built. after it is finished Kaunas-Tallinn should start, however it's not looking very optimistic in the near future.

Nope, nobody here even mentions anything like that. This is a Lithuanian-only project that is not even considered here. We talk about a high-speed network here.

&gt; it is called like that in official documents, check it out. if you don't even know that I am not surprised you are so misinformed and talking BS.

Official documents in Lithuania? Definitely not here.

&gt; as I said, without connecting Kaunas-Poland you wouldn't have connection to Western Europe. so it's kinda important for Estonia and Latvia... don't you think so? also, while we will have connection to Europe in 1,5years tops, why should we hurry about connecting Latvia and Estonia? yeah, it would be beneficial for us too, however it's your problem to push it, and not ours. it's kinda understandable.

And again, Lithuanian superiority complex kicks out. For god's sake, this is a cooperation project, not ""who's got bigger"" contest. Remember Visaginas NPP? We were supposed to build a new nuclear reactor to Lithuania so you'd be energy independent. Whoops, Lithuania ruined that and now you have to import 3/4 of your energy.

&gt; Turkey has been added to BND's mission statement, BND's objectives and list of countries to be targeted for surveillance, in 2009. Renewal was due for last year but has been delayed after the Snowden leaks.  

&gt; Kerry's phone call was recorded when he was travelling in the Middle East, similar to a call by Clinton to Annan a year earlier that was on frequencies used by suspected terrorists under surveillance by BND. At the time, the protocol was to inform BND's president of such occurrences, and he ordered the call to be deleted, which somewhat ironically was the job of the BND/CIA double agent who then made a copy for the Americans.  
Since last year (read: Snowden), the protocol has been changed to have such calls deleted without going through BND's upper management first, however Spiegel questions if and how this new directive can even realistically be applied in spy agencies' everyday practice.

Okay, there *are* [different definitions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail#Definitions) for high-speed rail depending on context and who you ask.

Here's the EU definition:
&gt;The European Union Directive 96/48/EC, Annex 1 defines high-speed rail as a set of three elements with precise criteria:
&gt;
- Infrastructure: track built specially for high-speed travel or specially upgraded for high-speed travel.
- Maximum Speed Limit: Minimum speed of 200 km/h (124 mph) on lines specially built for high speed and 250 km/h (155 mph) on existing lines which have been specially upgraded. This must apply to at least one section of the line. Rolling stock must have a maximum speed of at least 200 km/h (124 mph) to be considered high speed.
- Operating conditions: Rolling stock must be designed alongside its infrastructure for complete compatibility, safety and quality of service.

So yes, 220 km/h really counts as high-speed rail provided it fulfills the criteria.

&gt; ""Proper"" high speed trains travel at 300+ km/h.

People have got different opinions; if everyone was to go around and get all worked up over anyone who says something they disagree with, the world wouldn't be a very nice place, eh?

Second of all, I never said that **it just won't happen and there is no way consequences in the year 20XX won't lead to a federal European state**. This is how you interpreted my comment.

My comment was to suggest that I personally **don't think** that a federal European state will be formed in the next 50 years. Hence the **""I don't see it happening""**.

You're comparing two very different things. You're comparing world wars and dissolved empires with forming a federal state with 20+ countries of often completely opposite opinions, cultures, religions etc. Large empires have always been around, but not in the form of dozens of nations forming a federal state, with all of the nations having equal rights. Any time there was a federal state of some sort, it was based by no more than a couple of nations. Not 25+ different nations. One of the reasons I think it would be particularly difficult to establish a federal European state.

Why I don't think it will happen? Look at how many new countries have been formed in Europe since 1989. And many regions in Europe still have the desire to become independent states. Of course, this doesn't mean that the situation will be the same in 20+ years, but in my view, this dividing attitude will still prevail for some time.

To form a federal state, not only does it need to be heavily prepared in terms of justice, economy etc; but the people have to want it as well. Currently, large groups of people in some countries don't even want to be in the EU, let alone in a federal state. Furthermore, large groups of people in some regions aren't even happy being a part of their current country, let alone a federal state.

What I said was my personal opinion. I was not making an undisputed prediction of the future, but you interpreted it that way.
And on the other hand, your comment sounds a bit like you're expecting it to happen. But you can not predict it either.


So yeah, no need to go around shouting and screaming just because I have an opinion that you don't agree with or you believe that I made a *""bullshit assessment.""* I have reasons I believe in my opinion and they're well justified.

Just for the sake of ""better safe than sorry"", here you go:

true,iisno1uno,LITH,Lithuania,"&gt;Sorry, but how are you going to connect Baltic region to *Central Europe without connecting them first? You know, Lithuania alone doesn't make up Baltic region.

Lithuania do not have burning desire to be connected by high-speed European gauge rail network with Latvia and Estonia. what actually matters is to be connected to Western Europe. so yeah, while I agree that every country should work on this together, to say that all countries should be connected with each other first and only then to build a connection to Poland is ridiculous.

&gt;Whatever you call them, Rail Baltic I and II are absolutely separate projects. I am talking about the 240 km/h double track one. The 160 km/h will not reach Latvia/Estonia.

so now you accept the existence of Rail Baltic I? cause just few post ago you said there was no such thing. that's why I call you living in a dreamland. your posts sound more like 14yo's wishful thinking than actual understanding of the subject. where do you get your information may I ask? cause sure as hell it doesn't sound like you have anything in common with rail transport. 

&gt;Nope, still not true. There were talks about taking Kaunas out of the project. And yes, Estonians didn't like that Lithuanians are adding some random project to Rail Baltic - making it more expensive and difficult -&gt; more difficult to get money from EU. Finally it was decided by EU that Vilnius can be added to the project, but not to the original Rail Baltic. Which means Estonians were right.

yes, there was talks about cutting Kaunas out. because what was agreed 10 or so years ago by the governments was to include all the capitals into the RailBaltic network. then there were discussions about exact routes (Kaunas-Panevėžys+branch to Vilnius)/(Kaunas-Vilnius-Panevėžys)/(Kaunas-Šiauliai+branch to Vilnius) etc. last year Estonians starts demanding cutting Vilnius out completely cause the time and the price is the factor, deadlines are near (to get the EU money), and so on. however, thankfully we agreed to build Kaunas-Vilnius branch in the distant future and not to delay the actual project anymore. 

&gt;Nope, nobody here even mentions anything like that. This is a Lithuanian-only project that is not even considered here. We talk about a high-speed network here.

again, what exactly do you mean by that? are you suggesting someone will build another route from Kaunas to Poland with 240km/h and double tracks? you are really delusional then. don't even know what to answer exactly, just another example of 14yo's wishful thinking. 

&gt;Official documents in Lithuania? Definitely not here.

official EU documents. just use google ffs. you are denying what is absolutely black on white all over the internet. don't act like some Russian propaganda troll.

&gt;And again, Lithuanian superiority complex kicks out. For god's sake, this is a cooperation project, not ""who's got bigger"" contest. Remember Visaginas NPP? We were supposed to build a new nuclear reactor to Lithuania so you'd be energy independent. Whoops, Lithuania ruined that and you have to import 3/4 of your energy. Want same things to happen again?

how dafaq did you get to that? Lithuanian superiority and complex in the same sentence? you are truly hallucinating dude. 

&gt;Remember Visaginas NPP?

what exactly about it? it was denied by referendum by popular vote by Lithuanian citizens. what exactly has it to do with anything? man you are seriously fucked up in the head. get your facts straight.

&gt;Want same things to happen again?

as I said, we don't really care about the connecting ourselves to the Latvia and Estonia by rail. cause we already have that connection using Russian gauge and no one is using that, because there are a lot of disagreement between Lithuanian Rail company and Latvian Rail company. I could go in deeply into that but clearly there's no point to do that while you are still using some delfi-like rhetoric.

I really don't see it. When looking at other governments, to call the E.U. a bureaucratic nightmare is a little bit too much, don't you think?

&gt;with an unstoppable penchant for centralisation, giving it absolute power over all of our nations would create situations where citizens of individual states were forced to go along with things against their will, in situations where individual national parliaments would not have had that outcome.

Aren't you thinking of a unitary government, not a federal one? 

&gt;the detraction you don't like within the EU right now is what keeps it in check, federalism would just remove that entirely and let it act cart blanche.

#

&gt;Even with full devolution (everything but foreign policy and defence) the only thing that would change is other nations being able to obligate mine to start wars it otherwise wouldn't, and commit troops it otherwise wouldn't. 

That detraction would always exist as representatives are weary of the consequences their constituencies (and their colleagues constituencies) don't like. War is usually one of them.

&gt;The US is prosperous but I don't think its federal system is what we want at all.

I don't think anyone is proposing a U.S. style federalism.

&gt;Would you really have been happy if the dominant nations in the EU had been able to force the smaller nations to invade Iraq back then?

No, but the counter-argument is that a federal E.U. wouldn't have been a push-over for the U.S. like individual states have been in 2003, and wouldn't have participated in the invasion Iraq at all.

&gt;the fact that you're saying that individual states would only get a ""relatively large amount of devolved power"" is also terrifying

Could you elaborate?

&gt;because it essentially shows that you want to offshore our democracies.

true,toreon,ESTO,Eesti,"&gt; Lithuania do not have burning desire to be connected by high-speed European gauge rail network with Latvia and Estonia. what actually matters is to be connected to Western Europe. so yeah, while I agree that every country should work on this together, to say that all countries should be connected with each other first and only then to build a connection to Poland is ridiculous.

Lithuania, at least on official level, has agreed to build Rail Baltic high-speed connection. Your opinion doesn't change this.

&gt; so now you accept the existence of Rail Baltic I? cause just few post ago you said there was no such thing. that's why I call you living in a dreamland. your posts sound more like 14yo's wishful thinking than actual understanding of the subject. where do you get your information may I ask? cause sure as hell it doesn't sound like you have anything in common with rail transport.

I've never denied the existence of ""Rail Baltic I"", I just never agreed (and still don't) with the name. And if you need to know, I get my information from media. Of course, you can say that official media channels lie and only you know the best, but that's already your decision.

&gt; yes, there was talks about cutting Kaunas out. because what was agreed 10 or so years ago by the governments was to include all the capitals into the RailBaltic network. then there were discussions about exact routes (Kaunas-Panevėžys+branch to Vilnius)/(Kaunas-Vilnius-Panevėžys)/(Kaunas-Šiauliai+branch to Vilnius) etc. last year Estonians starts demanding cutting Vilnius out completely cause the time and the price is the factor, deadlines are near (to get the EU money), and so on. however, thankfully we agreed to build Kaunas-Vilnius branch in the distant future and not to delay the actual project anymore.

Huh? Rail Baltic's route was decided on national levels - that means Lithuania decided it to go through Kaunas. Only later, they started to doubt about it. Estonians didn't like that already made decisions were suddenly put under doubt.

&gt; again, what exactly do you mean by that? are you suggesting someone will build another route from Kaunas to Poland with 240km/h and double tracks? you are really delusional then. don't even know what to answer exactly, just another example of 14yo's wishful thinking.

Well, that's the problem. Rail Baltic should be 240km/h double track railway, but if Lithuania is building something else already, I don't see them actually wanting to build the high speed network too. Officially, Lithuania is still going on with the project. 

Oh, and stop with the 14yo BS, I'm talking from an Estonian perspective.

&gt; official EU documents. just use google ffs. you are denying what is absolutely black on white all over the internet. don't act like some Russian propaganda troll.

What? How has Russian propaganda anything to do with it?

&gt; how dafaq did you get to that? Lithuanian superiority and complex in the same sentence? you are truly hallucinating dude.

Sorry if you got offended, but really, the fact that you have border with Poland, and Estonia/Latvia don't, doesn't give you the excuse to block your neighbours' projects.

&gt; what exactly about it? it was denied by referendum by popular vote by Lithuanian citizens. what exactly has it to do with anything? man you are seriously fucked up in the head. get your facts straight.

I'm saying that cooperation and Lithuania just don't seem to work out. You understand that Estonia and Latvia had also their interest in the project as we funded a large part of it? Just cancelling it out of the blue isn't something a good partner does.

&gt; as I said, we don't really care about the connecting ourselves to the Latvia and Estonia by rail. cause we already have that connection using Russian gauge and no one is using that, because there are a lot of disagreement between Lithuanian Rail company and Latvian Rail company. I could go in deeply into that but clearly there's no point to do that while you are still using some delfi-like rhetoric.

You know, whatever problems you have with Delfi, is not my concern. Oh, and here should I understand that yet again, Lithuania is unable to cooperate with Latvia?

I wouldn't call them liars, however most often than not they are misinformed themselves, do not understand technical details, rely only on the word of politicians.

what strikes me the most how passionately you are discussing it and denying my words, like ""maybe it's called RailBaltic II in your country but not in Estonia"" and stuff. 

so, to keep it short, misinformed delfi readers can downvote my posts as much as they want, I know the stuff I'm talking about cause I've been railfan myself since forever, and keep following the development of RailBaltic since before it began. that's why I am not optimistic, seeing how much obstacles it has to overcome and how much delayed it was before. 

&gt;I've never denied the existence of ""Rail Baltic I"", I just never agreed (and still don't) with the name. 

that's your problem, not mine. official EU documents talk about RBI PL-Kaunas, RBII Kaunas-Tallinn(Helsinki).

&gt;Rail Baltic's route was decided on national levels - that means Lithuania decided it to go through Kaunas.

not true. everything till this point were only suggestions, calculations, propositions. the only official agreement regarding the route that was reached I believe in 2007 by the governments was to include all three capitals in the network. 

on a work-group level Lithuanians wanted to include Kaunas too, and there were discussions going how should it be done. last year (cause the time to get the project approved by EU was running out) Estonians said ""hurry up, cut Vilnius out, lets go"" to what Lithuanian government responded by ""fu, Vilnius stays"". there were discussions about cutting Kaunas out etc, and finally it was agreed on Kaunas-Panevėžys +branch to Vilnius later on. once again, info is from inside sources and not what media reports.

&gt;Well, that's the problem. Rail Baltic should be 240km/h double track railway, but if Lithuania is building something else already, I don't see them actually wanting to build the high speed network too. Officially, Lithuania is still going on with the project.

nowhere in the documents it is said that there should be 240km/h double track since it's highly expensive and not very rationale. right now everything is still in work-group and calculation stage. 

if by ""Rail Baltic should be 240km/h double track railway"" you mean ""I wish Rail Baltic to be 240km/h double track railway"" than it's understandable. I wish so too. however, it's only wishful thinking and personally I do not see that happening.

&gt;Sorry if you got offended, but really, the fact that you have border with Poland, and Estonia/Latvia don't, doesn't give you the excuse to block your neighbours' projects.

no one is blocking nothing. Lithuanian Rail company obviously wants to build it, government wants to build it, society wants it too. if your media reports otherwise then I guess we are boogiemonsters of Estonia, the evil cousin who doesn't let Estonians to evolve then so be it. 

what I am saying, that Lithuania wants to build the network (free European money for builders, railworkers, etc), but it's not the life-or-death question for us, and it's significantly more important to you guys.

&gt;I'm saying that cooperation and Lithuania just don't seem to work out. You understand that Estonia and Latvia had also their interest in the project as we funded a large part of it? Just cancelling it out of the blue isn't something a good partner does.

just in your previous post you suggested that we stalled or something, and you (Estonia) punished us and now we are losers who have to import our energy. now you are saying that we canceled it out of blue. once again, if your media portrays Lithuania as evil cousin so be it, but the fact is that our politicians did say that firstly they need approval by the popular vote to go through with it.

&gt;Oh, and here should I understand that yet again, Lithuania is unable to cooperate with Latvia?

as I said, there are quite a few sides to the story. main thing is Lithuania/Latvian rail companies are competing since independence (and even before), on who's gets to transport Belarusian and Russian stuff from the Klaipėda/Riga ports etc. both companies are punishing each other with massive fees for using the infrastructure etc. as a railfan I am very displeased with the situation, however I doubt that it has anything to do with your chauvinistic accusations about not being able to trust Lithuanians or something in that light.

I think you strike close to a good answer to the OP's question. One of the things people can do to understand something is to be able to know it's history accurately. This only goes up to the mid-noughties, but it starts and covers much/most of the EU's history, if you have not personally already read it?

Full Book: [The Great Deception](http://www.eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=85035) A history of the EU:-

&gt;*The purpose of this book is to tell for the first time the real story of how, through what had come to be known to its insiders as ‘the project’, the continent’s politicians had for half a century been seeking gradually to construct and to impose on their peoples a unique system of government. Not the least remarkable feature of this political experiment had been how few people really understood its real nature, aims and origins.*

&gt;*The form of government it created was unique because it was designed to place the nation states which belonged to it under a ‘supranational’ power, unaccountable to any electorate, ruling its citizens through the agency of each country’s own national authorities. Although the nation states and their institutions of government remained outwardly intact, all these institutions, from heads of state and parliaments to civil services and judicial systems, in reality became increasingly subject to the decisions and laws of the new power that was above them all.*

&gt;*It was because the system worked from behind the scenes through the familiar landscape of existing national institutions that so few people recognised the immense scale of the change which was taking place.*

&gt;*As we drew on thousands of books, documents, academic papers and other sources, there was scarcely a single episode in the story which did not emerge in a new light. The historical record revealed a picture of the story so radically different from any previous account that we were sure anyone remotely concerned with this hugely important subject might, like us, find it both startling and illuminating.*

Therefore it's not surprising so few of the posts on this thread to this most interesting of political questions can provide a true answer.

true,toreon,ESTO,Eesti,"&gt; I wouldn't call them liars, however most often than not they are misinformed themselves, do not understand technical details, rely only on the word of politicians.

Sorry, but internet is also media. Therefore, I can't seem to understand why you think you're better informed than me.

&gt; so, to keep it short, misinformed delfi readers can downvote my posts as much as they want, I know the stuff I'm talking about cause I've been railfan myself since forever, and keep following the development of RailBaltic since before it began. that's why I am not optimistic, seeing how much obstacles it has to overcome and how much delayed it was before.

And why do you think I have not been following Rail Baltic myself? 

&gt; that's your problem, not mine. official EU documents talk about RBI PL-Kaunas, RBII Kaunas-Tallinn(Helsinki).

No they don't, no Kaunas-Tallinn mentioned anywhere, it's always Tallinn-PL border

&gt; not true. everything till this point were only suggestions, calculations, propositions. the only official agreement regarding the route that was reached I believe in 2007 by the governments was to include all three capitals in the network.
&gt; on a work-group level Lithuanians wanted to include Kaunas too, and there were discussions going how should it be done. last year (cause the time to get the project approved by EU was running out) Estonians said ""hurry up, cut Vilnius out, lets go"" to what Lithuanian government responded by ""fu, Vilnius stays"". there were discussions about cutting Kaunas out etc, and finally it was agreed on Kaunas-Panevėžys +branch to Vilnius later on. once again, info is from inside sources and not what media reports.

Vilnius was not included in the first project, it was added later. Why would I be against Vilnius? More people - more users of RB. Adding Vilnus at the last moment was very suspicious to Estonia.

&gt; nowhere in the documents it is said that there should be 240km/h double track since it's highly expensive and not very rationale. right now everything is still in work-group and calculation stage.

Yes it does, for example, Estonian Wikipedia says it.

&gt; if by ""Rail Baltic should be 240km/h double track railway"" you mean ""I wish Rail Baltic to be 240km/h double track railway"" than it's understandable. I wish so too. however, it's only wishful thinking and personally I do not see that happening.

Why are you so convinced it's only in my head? 

&gt; no one is blocking nothing. Lithuanian Rail company obviously wants to build it, government wants to build it, society wants it too. if your media reports otherwise then I guess we are boogiemonsters of Estonia, the evil cousin who doesn't let Estonians to evolve then so be it.

Why would we randomly want problems with Lithuania? Of course we don't. 

&gt; what I am saying, that Lithuania wants to build the network (free European money for builders, railworkers, etc), but it's not the life-or-death question for us, and it's significantly more important to you guys.

Doesn't seem like that here. It seems more like some Lithuanian Railway oligarchs are afraid to lose competitiveness and want RB to fail. That way, Lithuania is the only one who gets railway connection to Central Europe.

&gt; just in your previous post you suggested that we stalled or something, and you (Estonia) punished us and now we are losers who have to import our energy. now you are saying that we canceled it out of blue. once again, if your media portrays Lithuania as evil cousin so be it, but the fact is that our politicians did say that firstly they need approval by the popular vote to go through with it.

What? Estonia punished you? What the hell? My point was that if you fail on such massive cooperation projects, it has negative effect on everybody, but mostly on Lithuania.

&gt; as I said, there are quite a few sides to the story. main thing is Lithuania/Latvian rail companies are competing since independence (and even before), on who's gets to transport Belarusian and Russian stuff from the Klaipėda/Riga ports etc. both companies are punishing each other with massive fees for using the infrastructure etc. as a railfan I am very displeased with the situation, however I doubt that it has anything to do with your chauvinistic accusations about not being able to trust Lithuanians or something in that light.

Si les charges baissent et que, du coup, tu ne coute plus que 1500 euros a la boite, tu n'en vaux pas moins toujours 2000 pour elle.

Oui mais, ton entreprise a des concurrents.

Naja zuerst sollte man mal schauen, wofür das Geld der Kirche überhaupt verwendet wird. Und welche Illusion hatte man denn? Dass die Priester/Bischöfe etc keine Menschen sind, also unfehlbar?

&gt;Dementsprechend könnten diese Menschen zu der Gruppe gehören, die zwar glaubt, dass die kirchlichen Glaubensgrundsätze gut/wahr sind, aber von der Kirche nicht zur genüge umgesetzt werden.

Und wie kann man gleichzeitig glauben, dass die kirchlichen Grundsätze usw wahr sind, und dann austreten? Das würde ja irgendwie gegen die Grundsätze gehen...

then you denied that Poland-Kaunas connection is of importance to Latvia and Estonia and stated that this is not part of RailBaltic. in your most recent posts you plead us (Lithuanians) to not to act like a-holes and let you connect to the Europe. you are not being very consistent. 

&gt;Vilnius was not included in the first project, it was added later. Why would I be against Vilnius? More people - more users of RB. Adding Vilnus at the last moment was very suspicious to Estonia.

we can argue till we are both old, it was/it wasn't. I know for one that it was, in around 2007, before the crisis. it was agreed that Vilnius should be the part of European gauge network, however everyone also kinda agreed and talked about that main route should go through Kaunas and then to Šiauliai/Panevėžys. btw, Panevėžys was decided not so long ago, IIRC last summer.

about the 240km/h and what Estonian wiki says... what if I edit it know and change it to 360km/h? does it have any sources? there might have been some suggestions (I remember reading them myself) to have such a high speed, however realistically price is over the roof, and I can bet the cow I don't have that max speed will be 160km/h. maybe since you guys are so progressive and stuff in some parts of Estonia it will reach 240. I can guarantee however this is not the case in Lithuania and Latvia.

&gt;Doesn't seem like that here. It seems more like some Lithuanian Railway oligarchs are afraid to lose competitiveness and want RB to fail. That way, Lithuania is the only one who gets railway connection to Central Europe.

it's not like if Germany can't export to Estonia through RB they will not export at all or will choose Lithuania instead. on the contrary, Lithuania will gain the most because of being the transit country. adding Vilnius on the last minute... is just a myth my dear. it was always on the agenda. 

&gt;But is there any reason I should believe otherwise? You are already accusing me of having illusions of some made up project, which is actually a real deal.

are you talking about 240km/h here? I encourage you to find who and then agreed on building double track network with capabilities of that speed. if that's a done deal shouldn't be so hard, should it.

So it's a giant leap of faith, to give out the task of providing for themselves into the hands of central European government. And lately there was a lot of ""it's not problem"" in the air, which does not help.

The main thing, aside those two, is the people who need to feel Europeans first. Once this happens EU is already federalized, and like in case of marriage the formalities come second. And like in case of marriage, if you formalize it first then the outcome could be opposite to what you're hoping for.

But I think we will do it, maybe my grandchildren will see it. Because other than different market needs what is there that stands in the way? Sure, we annoy each other a lot, and we did some nasty things to ourselves in the past, but that's normal in any family. There is rivalry and mockery, still very normal.

And I think that we like that. Being able to feel at home anywhere on the continent. Meeting people very unlikely to us, that share this identity with us - still vulnerable though. Being amazed how similarly we think, using similar logic, even when it stands behind different conclusions. That we share this care for other human being, which made us to believe in EU in the first place - to stop all wars, at least here.

Maybe I idealize, but there's also the fact that if we want Europe to matter in the international arena, we need to be able to react much quicker than now and send one firm signal at a time.

true,toreon,ESTO,Eesti,"&gt; RailBaltic I and RailBaltic II are official and widely used names, that's why I feel being more informed than you, when you admitted you didn't even know these names existed.

Actually, not in Estonia. There's even an [article](http://uudised.err.ee/v/majandus/821213ef-c3bb-4416-9767-617343578a85) that explains these different names (in Estonian).

&gt; then you denied that Poland-Kaunas connection is of importance to Latvia and Estonia and stated that this is not part of RailBaltic. in your most recent posts you plead us (Lithuanians) to not to act like a-holes and let you connect to the Europe. you are not being very consistent.

The Poland-Kaunas link currently being built does not have any importance to Latvia/Estonia indeed. What I was talking about was the high-speed one.

&gt; we can argue till we are both old, it was/it wasn't. I know for one that it was, in around 2007, before the crisis. it was agreed that Vilnius should be the part of European gauge network, however everyone also kinda agreed and talked about that main route should go through Kaunas and then to Šiauliai/Panevėžys. btw, Panevėžys was decided not so long ago, IIRC last summer.

Okay, Vilnius probably was part of some very general agreements that it 'belongs to some European corridors' and so on, but I'm strictly talking about high-speed Rail Baltic railway link.

&gt; about the 240km/h and what Estonian wiki says... what if I edit it know and change it to 360km/h? does it have any sources? there might have been some suggestions (I remember reading them myself) to have such a high speed, however realistically price is over the roof, and I can bet the cow I don't have that max speed will be 160km/h. maybe since you guys are so progressive and stuff in some parts of Estonia it will reach 240. I can guarantee however this is not the case in Lithuania and Latvia.

The Wikipedia mentionig 240km/h does have a valid source. Here in Estonia, there're many arguments about whether Rail Baltic is useful enough etc. We are talking ONLY about 240km/h here. BTW, in the article I linked above, a Lithuanian professor talks about 160km/h being an outdated 20th century project and 240km/h should be the priority.

&gt; it's not like if Germany can't export to Estonia through RB they will not export at all or will choose Lithuania instead. on the contrary, Lithuania will gain the most because of being the transit country. adding Vilnius on the last minute... is just a myth my dear. it was always on the agenda.

Not according to Estonian minister, who even called some Lithuanian government characters 'fools' for that.

&gt; are you talking about 240km/h here? I encourage you to find who and then agreed on building double track network with capabilities of that speed. if that's a done deal shouldn't be so hard, should it.
