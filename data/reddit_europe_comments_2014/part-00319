false,funkalunatic,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; Oh shit, you've solved this whole problem. Why didn't we think of that earlier. Thanks so much for this great idea. 

You're welcome, but I seriously don't understand why sufficiently strong enforcement + punishment are not fully implemented. I know it doesn't fully tackle root causes, but proximate public safety is important.

&gt; Every other underclass would be ungrateful when you give them free houses and services to improve their situation?

In most cases (Perhaps I shouldn't have said ""every""), probably, if such gifts are given by the class which they perceive to be oppressing them, and for what they may perceive to be ulterior motives.

&gt; if you would provide free education, housing and other free shit... you could solve the ghetto problem in a few decades.

Free education, housing, and other social services have been provided to the very impoverished and underprivileged in the US for many decades - not to the same cushy extent that it is in much of Europe, but it's there nonetheless. Such families in the US can expect to receive health care, some food funding, housing subsidies, educational scholarships, and more. The problem is that even with all of these, there are still hurdles like bigotry, cultural inertia and lack of social capital, lack of employment, perception of no opportunity, early life developmental problems, vicious cycles of broken families or substance abuse or violence, etc. It's not just the poor non-white areas of inner cities either, but rural areas where some of these cycles persist as well.

&gt; Now my question to you: what do you propose there'd be done?

As I said above, a law and order approach is a must. Beyond that, I think there are probably a few things that parts of Europe need to come to terms with about their societies. One is that liberalism and multiculturalism are fundamentally at odds with an ethnic/cultural national identity. If you have a lot of people in your country whose national identities run along ethnic, cultural, or religious lines, they will constantly see and be seen by out-groups as a threat. If you give the ethnic/cultural nationalists anything more than a fringe space in your public sphere, their existence will poison any potential for good will between groups, regardless of the material gifts you shower on those involved.

That is, the outcry by those demanding assimilation (usually meaning a process in which an out-group member relinquishes their out-group identity and joins the in-group as a second-class citizen) is the very thing which prevents actual assimilation (which can only happen in civic/participatory terms, and on an egalitarian basis).

In Italy, then, the solution is to take a law and order approach while continuing to actively create pathways for Roma participation in civic life, but then also to shun and disparage those voices in the Italian world which are either racist, or say words only for the purpose of veiling racist intent.

Despite the presence of politicians calling Obama a monkey and stuff like that, and despite all the negativity I've been spewing here, I am optimistic that Italy has the ability to solve such problems, and the outcry about the segregated busing policy is indicative of that.",0,1414361744,null,0,false,0,clkkb76,t3_2kd7xe,t1_clkkb76,t1_clkjb7r,null,1426337283,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

but if educated in Lithuania, speaking Polish in Kresy dialect, being part of Polish literary tradition, consuming and creating Polish culture is not weird at all. Maybe that is why I did not understand why it was ""fair enough"". There is no problem in Lithuania to get education from kindergarten to Masters degree (with some limitations) totally in Polish.

Yes, education is the key. Provide them with better options. I can't speak on US ghettos, don't know much about them, but I think it's a different set of issues. The biggest problem with Roma is when they choose nomadic way of life that is actually segregating them from people where they live. They put up a camp, live there for some time and move on .....

Concerning making new friends; I don't think having an ""Indian"" appearance will make a difference to you, compared to other what-ever-race Americans coming to Germany. There should be plenty of great comments about how making friends in Germany is like for Americans here on Reddit, from people who actually came over and experiences it first hand :)

I've got the impression that you may also be slightly concerned about racism; let me be honest, there's racism in America and there is racism in German as well. Whether and if yes how strong you will experience racism will depend hugely on where you work, what your job is, what your personality is like and also pure luck. I'm not able to compare it to the US, but I would GUESS and judge from my PERSONAL EXPERIENCE (as a non-minority) that we are pretty accepting and tolerant; I don't think you will have any  problems exceeding potentally very few and single individuals. Again, there are assholes everywhere on this world, sadly. But chances that you will have to for example work with one should be fairly small. 
Regarding girls; if you are a good looking guy I don't think you will be rejected just for your race; again, this hugely interacts with what kind of woman you're looking for. I have to admit that if you're just looking for casual hookups (which is fine) the ""Indian look"" (not ment to be offensive, I just don't know how to word it) probably won't be the most ""fancied"" or ""fashionable"" one by the girls; but again it depends on how you actually look like, how much effort you put into presenting yourself and what your SELFCONFIDENCE is like. If you are looking for ""the woman""; don't worry, interracial partnership is no issue at all in most (almost every) families I would say. ""Für jeden Topf gibt es einen Deckel"", if  you are looking for the right one, she's looking for you too ;)

If such a curriculum is common in the US, and has been proven to be futile, when why try it here?

EDIT: I thought I should be more constructive. If you want to pupils to see the other point of view, then do it the german way: directly. Present them a current political topic, e.g. the Russians in the Crimea, or german weirdheads fighting for IS. Now ask them about their opinion first. And then, ask them directly if they can see arguments of the other side. If you do this repeatedly, then your pupils will already know what you expect from them. It will come much easier to them, then artifically pretend (!) to have a different meaning than they have. I'd even say that this approach is a better way for your goal.

I don't about your school, but at government schools there is a psycholic service. As school matters are different from Bundesland to Bundesland, I can't you give exact information, but here is [one example](http://www.schule-bw.de/lehrkraefte/beratung/beratungslehrer/beratungsstellen). On that page you see that they can be contacted in the case of ""Verhaltensauffälligkeiten im schulischen Umfeld"".

Really, your school must be a weird one if such basic things aren't known amongst the teachers.

In the grammar school (""Grundschule""), where one of my daugthers is, such a person is working for 50% of time. In the High School (""Gymnasium"") of my other school, such a person is working for 100% of time.

In case of anorexie there are ""procedures"" (basically you contact the ""Psychosoziale Baratungsstelle""].

I know (personally) the Polish *honor*, but can you, for some moment, imagine that UPA is something bigger than anti-Polish actions?

false,Louis_de_Lasalle,ITAL,Italy,"&gt; I'm surprised you put Ireland in the same category as Italy, Spain and Greece. Ireland's problems were very different from those of the Mediterranean. 

I put Ireland in there because they have similar problems of endemic corruption and crippling bureaucracies.

&gt;While I agree that Italy's problems were not caused by the EU, they were an inevitable consequence of the euro. At the time the euro was formed, it was known that Italy would not be able to keep up with Germany. Outside the euro, Italy would have more economic and monetary options available to it. At the time Italy joined the euro, it became certain that Italy would have an economic disaster.

My argument is that Italy's economic woes do not really have to do with being able to control their fiscal policy. We have roughly 50% youth unemployment, every business is shutting down, selling, or moving. Wages are stagnating or even declining, which in turn coupled with high unemployment means limited demand and a further failure of businesses. What Italy desperately needs is investment. Fiscal policy does not create investment. A civil law suit in Italy takes on average 2 and a half years. In the UK it takes 3 months and 4 in France on average. A permit for a business license takes on average 1 year and a half, in Germany it takes 3 weeks. The state agencies are notoriously corrupt and unless you have 'friends' it is impossible to do business. We are not a meritocratic society we will operate on patron/client relations as the Romans of Ovid's times. Last but not least we have the highest taxes in all of the EU to hire employees. The truth is only an idiot would invest in Italy with our current social-political-economic system. Fiscal policy is a minor concern, but the politicians want to blame the EU because doing something to actually change the system is either against their personal interests, or too much hard work. Also, we have a large mass which can easily be convinced to vote against their own interests, it's sad but I suppose part and parcel of Democracy.

&gt;Big business in the UK is much more pro-EU than small business. (Go figure - I work in big business myself and obviously we love all the regulation that comes from the EU that stops our competition being able to compete with us).

Could it not be that small businesses rely solely on a local customer base and thus are indifferent to the EU, while large businesses conduct commerce with nations in the EU and thus stand to loose a lot from an EU exit.

&gt; Economists are actually very divided on the question.

Economists have plenty of criticks against the EU, as do I, but advocating for a major nation such as France or Italy or the UK, to leave the EU is not something I have heard any economist come close to advocating. There is not need to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

just doesn't pay for them to stock up on stuff nobody ever buys, but if they know you come every week to buy it or pay up front (get some receipt), they will make it happen if they can.

As to the proposing of legislation, that is the prerogative of the Commission (the Government). That is the only institution that can table legislation. I agree that it's odd and undesirable to have a Parliament that can't table its own legislation. The Parliament does have a much better success rate in passing amendments (as compared to national parliaments) though (~83% success rate if memory serves) so it still does get to shape legislation in reality, and it can petition the Commission to introduce new legislation too.

Fiscal compact was one example of a fairly elegant overturn of such a veto. 

Current opt-outs are a different beast than renegotiation, since they were introduced concurrently with the rest of the countries integrating in that area, not retrospectively.

I don't think further opt-outs are out of the question in principle though, but given any would require revisions to the EU treaties and automatic referenda etc, highly unlikely to happen by the end of the decade. Pretty much impossible to do even technically by 2017, even ignoring how nobody would touch the treaties already again.

What? The US is awful for racism, so bad their black population has created it's own identity to stand out.

It's certainly getting better but the fact remains the serious racism in the past is what pushed the black population into the situation they are in today.

I think the nature of how such an agreement was negotiated in the first place is enough to classify it as 'harmful' to the democracy.

Of course it is. That's a part of what happens when ""free trade"" happens. You will most likely lose some ability to regulate the market.

I think we should certainly be worried that such a big deal is kept under such secrecy.

As for your sources, I am not into postmodernism that discredits everything as social constructs (in fact I despise it), but there are very strong objections regarding the very definition of race [Source](http://medicine.yale.edu/labs/kidd/www/440.pdf). Not to mention the controversy regarding the IQ as a measurement of intelligence. Even if you take for granted that both race and IQ are meaningful, there are problem with the statistical analysis. Controlling for bias effectively in statistical analysis is the wet dream of every empirical economist or social scientist and this case in no exception.

The second source you mention tries to address some of these problems with a control experiment. Even in that case the authors themselves state:

&gt; As Scarr &amp; Weinberg (1976) note, transracial adoption studies only control for family environment, not social environment. For example, children who are socially identified as black may still be subject to racial discrimination despite being raised by white parents.

&gt;The UK would be the EU's largest export market

After TTIP is signed whatever the terms will be the US will far outweigh the UK as an export market for the EU. Equally if we begin to change our regulations in areas previously regulated by the EU we will make it harder for EU countries to export to us pushing all European companies out except the big ones who can afford to deal with the higher cost of trade thus reducing our importance to the majority of EU businesses as an export market. It possible we will be a top export market for the EU at first but that will slowly decrease over time and within a few years we will be in the same position as any other country. EU trade will represent ~50% of our trade but only about ~5-10% of EU trade making our negotiating positions unequal and we will probably be forced to accept unfavourable terms because the deal will be so much more important to us than the EU.

Gypsies have only themselves to blame, and people rightly realize it's their genes that cause their low IQ and subhuman behavior. In Slovakia and Serbia, they did IQ tests of gypsy kids and got IQ of around 70. That means about a half of them are mildly mentally retarded.

It really depends on which Christians we are talking about. The Roman-Catholics and Protestants kept very thorough records afaik, but the Orthodox Church (to which most Romanians belong to) were way worse at keeping records, especially in smaller churches, and especially before the 19th century.

The [Courts](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Canada_Court_System.svg) are independent, but the  Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada, the federal courts, the appellate courts and the superior-level courts are appointed by the Governor-in-Council (by the Governor General on the advice of the Federal Cabinet, meaning the PM).  Meanwhile, judicial appointments to judicial posts in the so-called ""inferior"" or ""provincial"" courts are made by the local provincial governments.

The central bank is an independent body operating at arms-length from the government with a mandate to ""promote the economic and financial well-being of Canada."" The Minister of Finance doesn’t have a seat on the Board of Directors, and while the Deputy Minister of Finance does, he or she doesn’t have a vote. Since the creation of the central bank in 1935, the Minister of Finance has never dismissed a central banker or been forced to redirect central bank policy.

false,Reilly616,EURO,European Union,"&gt;What are the functions and difference between the parliament, commission, and council? 

The European Parliament is the Lower House. It is directly elected every five years. It has 751 members (including its President) which are apportioned between the Member States via degressive proportionality. Members sit according to political Group, not nationality. It represents the People in the legislative process.

The Council of the European Union is the other legislator, the Upper House. It represents the Member States in the legislative process. Its membership changes depending on the topic. Where the topic is related to justice, for example, it will be composed of the 28 Justice Ministers of the Member States. So, its membership changes, but it is always composed of one member per Member State, and that member will be a Minister in his or her national Government.

The European Commission is the EU's Executive. It is composed of one Commissioner from each Member State, nominated by the European Council (Heads of State and Government) and elected by the European Parliament. Since the Lisbon Treaty, its President has been the lead candidate of the European Party that wins the most seats in Parliament and/or can form a majority in Parliament (like a national Prime Minister). This means that the nomination of the Commission President by the European Council is now a formality, and the final decision is with the Parliament, and thus depends on the will of the People in the preceding election. The Commission is responsible for tabling legislation (but it is up to the two Houses to pass, amend, or vote against that), upholding the Treaties, and the day-to-day management of the EU.

&gt;Is there a head of gov.? 

As noted above, the Commission is the executive and its head is the President of the Commission. This is essentially the same role as Prime Minister.

&gt;Head of state? 

There is no Head of State per se. The European Council is composed of the 28 Heads of State and Government of the Member States (whichever one holds all or most executive power, ie the Chancellor of Germany, PM of the UK, but President of France and Cyprus, for example). This also elects its own President. One might consider this President alone, or the European Council jointly, as being the EU's unofficial Head of State.


&gt;Which is the executive? 

The Commission is the EU's executive, but the European Council also has a role to play in regards to the EU's general political directions and priorities.

&gt;Is the executive part of the legislature, or are they separated like in the US? 

The Commission is separate from the Parliament and the Council of the EU. If a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) or of the Council (a national Minister) is elected to to the position of European Commissioner, he or she must resign the other post. 

It is, however, a parliamentary system (unlike the US). The Commission is elected by a majority of the Parliament. The Parliament can force the resignation of the entire Commission by passing a motion of censure (essentially a vote of no confidence). This must pass by an absolute majority of the Parliament *and* a two-thirds majority of votes cast. Thus, the Commission needs the support of the Parliament, but to  slightly lesser extent than in most national parliamentary systems. No motion of censure has ever been passed, but in 1999 the Party of European Socialists withdrew its support from the Santer Commission and stated that if the Commission did not resign on its own accord, PES would support a motion of censure. This was enough to force the Commission's resignation.

&gt;What are the responsibilities of the EU gov. and the responsibilities of the National Govs? 

There are three types of EU competence: exclusive, shared, and supporting/coordinating. All other competences (those not conferred on the EU by the Treaties) remain with the Member States.

Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union sets out the exclusive competences of the EU:

&gt;1 The Union shall have exclusive competence in the following areas:

&gt;(a) customs union;

&gt;(b) the establishing of the competition rules necessary for the functioning of the internal market;

&gt;(c) monetary policy for the Member States whose currency is the euro;

&gt;(d) the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy;

&gt;(e) common commercial policy.

&gt;2 The Union shall also have exclusive competence for the conclusion of an international agreement when its conclusion is provided for in a legislative act of the Union or is necessary to enable the Union to exercise its internal competence, or in so far as its conclusion may affect common rules or alter their scope.

Article 4 TFEU sets out the competences that are shared between the Member States and the EU.

&gt;1 The Union shall share competence with the Member States where the Treaties confer on it a competence which does not relate to the areas referred to in Articles 3 and 6.

&gt;2 Shared competence between the Union and the Member States applies in the following principal areas:

&gt;(a) internal market;

&gt;(b) social policy, for the aspects defined in this Treaty;

&gt;(c) economic, social and territorial cohesion;

&gt;(d) agriculture and fisheries, excluding the conservation of marine biological resources;

&gt;(e) environment;

&gt;(f) consumer protection;

&gt;(g) transport;

&gt;(h) trans-European networks;

&gt;(i) energy;

&gt;(j) area of freedom, security and justice;

&gt;(k) common safety concerns in public health matters, for the aspects defined in this Treaty.

&gt;3 In the areas of research, technological development and space, the Union shall have competence to carry out activities, in particular to define and implement programmes; however, the exercise of that competence shall not result in Member States being prevented from exercising
theirs.

&gt;4 In the areas of development cooperation and humanitarian aid, the Union shall have competence to carry out activities and conduct a common policy; however, the exercise of that competence shall not result in Member States being prevented from exercising theirs.

Article 6 TFEU sets out the EU's supporting/coordinating competences:

&gt;The Union shall have competence to carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement the actions of the Member States. The areas of such action shall, at European level, be:

&gt;(a) protection and improvement of human health;

&gt;(b) industry;

&gt;(c) culture;

&gt;(d) tourism;

&gt;(e) education, vocational training, youth and sport;

&gt;(f) civil protection;

&gt;(g) administrative cooperation.

The specific limits of the above competences are set out in more detail throughout the Treaties.

&gt;Do their responsibilities overlap? 

Yes, in relation to shared competences (Articles 4 and 6 TFEU above).

&gt;Is there a single document that sets out these responsibilities? 

The Treaties are the 'Constitution' of the EU, its highest legal documents. There are two: The Treaty on European Union (55 Articles long), and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (358 Articles long). Annexed to these Treaties are 37 Protocols, two Annexes (just technical lists), 65 Declarations, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

The Protocols and Annexes form an integral part of the Treaties, and the Charter is given equal legal standing as the Treaties. The Declarations are explanatory in nature. All told, including Declarations, the Constitutional document of the EU is around 400 pages long.

&gt;Have there been arguments over jurisdiction? 

Yes. It's only natural in any federal system really. Disputes over competences go to the Court of Justice.",0,1414372337,null,0,1414449110,0,clkpolq,t3_2kdch2,t1_clkpolq,t1_clkn8pm,null,1426334708,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

The citizenship test isn't that hard, and we even encourage them to do it. But they don't even care enough to know the baisic facts of history about Latvia.

There are ofcourse good russians who are born here, who wen't to our schools, who know the language and respect our country. Even one of my best friends is infact a russian.

Please don't think you know what it's like to be Latvian, we have every right to hate Russians who still think that this is their country.

- Stevens (stevensbikes.de), Hamburg-based brand known for well balanced, rocksolid bikes and good customer-support.
- Gudereit (Gudereit.de), same as above but mostly hybrids, commuters and trekking bikes
- VSF Fahrradmanufaktur (www.fahrradmanufaktur.de), very good and nice looking hybrids and commuters, often with a Cro-Mo frame.
- Cube (cube.eu) is quite big in Germany, which can be an factor concerning availability, but the component mix and geometry can be strange at times (one of these brands that combine an XT-derailleur as ""eye-catcher"" with an Alivio front-derailleur to hit the price target)
- Bergamont (bergamont.de) and Winora (winora.de) for affordable hybrids and trekking bikes.
- Rose (rose.de), German based bike-shop with excellent custom bikes. Might be well above your budget, but keep that URL if you need an excellent online-shop for bike parts.
- Bike-Components (bikecomponents.de), same as Rose, but their custom bike shop (Vortrieb) disappeared :(
- Radon (radon-bikes.de), very affordable store brand, but geometry and component mix can be weird
- Pepper-Biker (pepperbikes.de), same as Radon, less fancy but the bikes tend to be better.

You can trust all these brands. Rule of thumb: The frame is usually okay. Maybe not as fancy as a Cannondale, but the quality-wise there is usually nothing to complain about. The component mix is far more interesting, and as implied above I would avoid a weird compnent-mix between ""Deore XT"" and ""Alivio"" components.

Shimano is very big in Germany. Deore components have a three-digit number in its model classification starting with the number 5, for example ""Deore RD-M**5**92"" for the current Deore Shadow rear derailleur (Alivio components start with the number 4). I would make sure that the hubs, rear derailleur and crankset are Shimano Deore or at least Alivio quality or better. Everything else can be upgraded later on, but you will always regret having bad hubs or a low quality rear-derailleur (and you don't replace these parts that easily).

I don't ""think"". It's a fact.

&gt; Also the first study claims 10% inflation is good for reducing unemployment rate 2 % and gaining less than 1 percent in GDP

10% depreciation, not inflation. And 1% in GDP is a lot (We have 0 right now.), there's also about 100 000 jobs at stake which means a lot less deficit. 

&gt;Such a high inflation has a massive effect on income, deposits and credit that it would make you a health risk for all foreign credit.

How massive ? That's all the question.

Evaluate this please, take into account the decrease in real debt rates. And again a 10% depreciation increases inflation by 2%. Not so massive.

&gt;The relative benefit from trade which you would get would be limited compared to the bonus you currently get from not paying ANY CUSTOMS or having to work around exchange rates.

Evaluate this. Which exchange rates ? Which customs ?

Cost of exchange rates is marginal and you'd have to explicit which customs you think we'd have to pay. South Korea has been using customs for decades and that has not prevented it from constantly growing.

I think you're just talking to scare people with no real study behind this.

&gt;But unless you close of the borders and become self sustainable internally you do not want inflation and cheap exports, China and even the US will outsell us easaly.

Nope. We need jobs and cheaper exports. French economy just needs a 3-4% inflation rate. It's its structural inflation. You really think all EU countries behave the same do you ?

Just look at the different partial inflation rates between different euro countries. The common currency increased the differences between countries because we don't have the same economical structures.

&gt;We compete with Japan, not india, and it's not a pride thing, it's just common sense, we can not affort their labor costs.

It's not black or white... We compete with them on some sectors and products. That's what was proven in the studies I gave you and why French economy IS price sensitive.

&gt;The UK is fucked, QE basically signed them up for at least 20 years of constant inflationary pressure they can not get rid of.
Norway literally has the money to print money and not feel a sting.

""The UK is fucked""... I'm not even going to discuss this with you.

Switzerland intervene specifically because of exchange rates for trade issues.

&gt;Why?

Because of economic structures. Demographics, job market, level of education, housing, industrial specialization etc.

We have a relatively young and growing population so we need a lot more investments than for example Germany. Just look at these age pyramids : [France](http://www.alternatives-economiques.fr/__TRAVAIL/graphique_legends/img.php?id=61706) vs [Germany](http://www.alternatives-economiques.fr/__TRAVAIL/graphique_legends/img.php?id=61707).

Germany has an old population looking to secure its money. We have a very different situation.

&gt;Economic stagnation is a consequence of lack of vision and developement. European leaders have a long tradition of that. The EU is just a easy target for national politicians to point at.

The EU is a consequence of a lack of vision made by European leaders.

&gt;Please explain why does deflation bother you?

http://snbchf.com/economic-theory/deflationary-spiral/

&gt;The political issues of the EU are not for me to argue against, we both want to dismantle the EPP and create a real democracy at the european level not a luxembourgian plutocracy powered by national politicians greed.

Agreed. I just don't think it's feasible because there's not such thing as a European people.

&gt;All of europe has a tradition of submiting to US interests

No. France does not.

&gt;I would argue that as a united front we stand a better chance of saying no, than as individual members.

The fact is that we are not united. I don't think that we'll ever be. So we are divided, and weaker than if we were able to make our own decisions independently.

&gt;Again imigration is a national issue that is just passed onto the EU.

Nope, freedom of movement means immigrants in any EU country can come into another.

&gt;Your fight is with local liberals. 

It's also with local liberals, but not only with them.

&gt;Blame feminism for demographic stagnation, women happen to have better things to do than have babies in modern societies.

There's no ""better"" thing than to have a baby. It's a complex issue so I won't spend more time on it here.

&gt;That is just plain stupid, they get money from taxes and are propped up by local goverments that are payed for by taxes. They want your taxes, a lot of them.

Freedom of movement and different tax legislations allow this. It's again a proof that we are not united but divided. We are not allies but competitors. The stupid ting was creating a union with no fiscal harmonization. The stupid thing is the EU.

&gt;I don't understand that one, how is there a increase in competition and why on earth would that be bad?

In any case, this just goes to show that the liner right/left model of political beliefs is very flawed. Even on economic issues there are huge problems with the extremely watered-down left/right spectrum. For instance, many leftists in Sweden (a country with a strong tendency to the Left) oppose a minimum wage, while ""leftists"" in America almost exclusively support them. There are plenty of parties in Europe that support a free and simplified business environment while providing protections for workers, which straddles both sides of the economic left/right. Then there are social issues like immigration that proponents of the welfare state are divided on.

Ultimately, while the left/right system is pretty flawed, it does have some credibility in certain circumstances.

Quintiles are without a doubt larger in the US. 

If you take the 400 richest Americans, over 2/3 earned their wealth based on Forbes statistics. Their rankings go from 1 to 10. Nines grew up low income and tens grew up low income and endured additional hardships such as sexual abuse. The trend is moving away from inherited wealth to earned wealth for the richest group of Americans.

That is part of the reason some immigrant groups are the highest income groups in the US. 

Social support isnt as strong, but I have a feeling if quality of life (or PPP income) measures were used instead of simplistic quintiles the outcome would be different.

Fianna Fáil are the corrupt bastards that ran Ireland into the ground. Fine Gael are the corrupt bastards that took over and managed a regime of cutthroat austerity. Labour were the ineffective and two-faced accomplices of Fine Gael.

What we've had here is a string of successes for the radical left and the populist left across council elections and by elections. It'll only be a matter of seeing whether they can translate that into the national level. If they do, then we could well see a Sinn Féin government, and while Sinn Féin is not exactly establishment, they're a household name due to the fact that they were the political arm of the PIRA during the war in Northern Ireland, and they're also horribly corrupt.

What we're seeing here across the board is a massive level of disillusionment with the parties in general and that has lead to a radical increase in support for left and far left candidates, as Ireland is traditionally a rather right wing country both socially and economically(With the exception being the bloated welfare handout system). Socialist Party, Socialist Workers Party, and Sinn Féin have been winning a lot quite recently, and at the expense of government parties, though the government was successful at squeezing the radicals out of European Parliament(mostly due to People Before Profit Alliance running against the Socialist Party in the same constituency, which was considered an incredibly sectarian move).

Now, my personal assessment is that it'll be one of two things;

1. An unstable centrist coalition with Sinn Féin with the keys to power

2. An unstable right wing populist coalition in an attempt to keep Sinn Féin out of power

Either way, I predict a great deal of political instability here in the future if current trends continue.",0,1414383501,null,0,false,0,clkvbwl,t3_2kes8c,t1_clkvbwl,t3_2kes8c,null,1426332073,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

 - Do you think it is going to be beneficial in general?

No, I think its quite deceptive, I think that these FTAs represent an attack on the gains which were made in the latter part of the 20th century, and an attack on democratic rule of law by a few very large corporations. I think they are being presented in an quite intentionally deceptive way, and the media has basically decided to not cover them intentionally, because the less people know the more likely they are to go along with them.

 - Or is it going to a threat for the sovereignty of European people?

Yes, and for the US too, thats their intent. They are a power grab which attempts to put corporate interests above those of the people of the world. ISDS is the worst but by no means the only example. they claim that the goal is to privatize and that privatization is good, however its often a huge failure. they attempt to make all privatizations one way and irreversible, which is a mistake that is often regretted. They attempt to pretend that the lessons of the 2008 GFC never happened and continue with deregulation when deregulation in the financial context has proven to be the worst possible thing for the people of a great many countries. 

They - meaning almost all FTAs are really bad policy.

 - Do we have to worry just reading what have been already leaked?

People should read other web sites (a good place to start is http://bilaterals.org ) and documents because all FTAs are intentionally written so as to be almost incomprehensible to normal people, also they reference one another so, when a person says ""well that wont be in XYZ document"" that may technically be true, its just going to be in this other ""agreement"" that you don't know about, old or new. ([Like TISA](http://www.world-psi.org/sites/default/files/documents/research/report_tisa_eng_lr2.pdf), which is almost completely unknown) 

Additionally, their FTA goals, their ""value system"" is at best amoral and backwards to what most people think of as good and bad.. 

This document is a [good short introduction](http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/nafta.pdf) to some of them. Its about a US-Canada FTA which was the prototype of a great many others (the other similar prototype is GATS) 

They are not most peoples goals nor are they the goals of the electorate in any country. They are an under the radar coup. 

 - What is the coverage of the demonstrations, if any, in your country?

Zero. Months go by that not a single story is published in the mainstream media. When i try to tell people about the existence of these FTAs, people- since they have never heard of them, think I am lying. 

 - Are there a huge movement in your country?  No, as I said, the government and media are going to great lengths to prevent most people (meaning 99.99%) from even knowing about them. 

A previous ""free trade"" ""agreement"", GATS, [is the reason](http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/Nick%20Skala%20GAT%20and%20Health%20Reform.pdf) why US health care is so horribly bad. Ultimately, the goal is to make European healthcare as profitable - and the FTAs [make any change towards ""liberalisation"" (privatization) irreversible..](https://web.archive.org/web/20140329000158/http://boell.org/downloads/HBS-TTIP_2.pdf)

But, nobody here in the US realizes that, which is what they want.   that way, politicians can make vague promises which they have no intention of keeping - and get away with it.

U can find their shows pretty easily, even with english subs, many people have uploaded ""Die Anstalt"" to youtube, because the channel (ZDF) isnt allowed to store them on their website for people to watch online.

Why?

Because they are/were sued by news papers/news organisations, after showing that many journalists and high ranking guys sit in/have high positions in different organisations they are supposed to be critical of (like organisation that propose actions to the government, the question was, can they write actually critical stuff and inform about government action their bosses or they themself proposed to the government)

so you would prefer to loose 10 bn in exports just to reduce imports?

Look at the dip imports took during the recesion that is caused by consumers not having enough money to buy foreign , reducing consumption, customs would do the same thing(at least on foreign products, it would make them more expensive than the demand can afford). At it's lowest point you still had a trade deficit. It's a structural problem, you don't export enough. Also those 10 bn in exports will hurt the economy more than your deficit, because you are crippling the exporters, the exact same people you need to encourage to resolve your trade balance issues.

10% depreciation implies ALL assets loose 10 % of their value, you become funtionally poorer by 10 %, compared to the rest of the world, any investor looses 1/10th of his money. You loose tens of thosand of euros on your property value. And no,10% depreciation is not 2% inflation, maybe per quarter, cumulated with the natural inflation.

It depends on how used to instability the investors are, this contraction is about as hard as the recession, but it would e voluntary so fewer people will stick with you.

&gt;Cost of exchange rates is marginal and you'd have to explicit which customs you think we'd have to pay. South Korea has been using customs for decades and that has not prevented it from constantly growing.

Cost of echange is quite high actually, think of this, to prevent a +-2 cost over a 30 day period most traders pay between 0.2 and .5 % exchange rate insurance. It is a massive hindrance to trade. If you had the industry profile of south korea you would not complain, when you have strong companies you can be north koreea and still make a profit.

Jobs for what?

Can you produce a iphone? No, you produce expensive cheese. Can a french man pick up the drop in demand that consumers of expensive cheese dropped. You're wages are to high for internal production to pick up the slack of imports and to low to absorb the excess production of your goods.

I know countries are different, but isolating yourself does not promote growt, it's like arguing that putting a child trogh military school makes him more mature. You can asses your structural issues within the EU(and with the whole of the EU as market), proactively, inflation and isolationism just kicks the can into the future, and you avoid adressing the fact that you aren't competitive and you protect yourself from becoming so. Yes reducing costs and making you a richer version of italy does have some advantages, but guess what, there are a couple of Italy's in the EU already and tens arouund the world. It's crowded in that sector.

The common currentcy increased velocity(a side effect of a increase in transactions) and that increased inflation diffirences. Again, it's not the euro. High velocity rates frustrate interventionists all over the world.

&gt;We compete with them on some sectors and products.

Tell me ONE. Those studies are cripplingly subjective and short sighted. This micromanaging strategy is aplied quite often fron nicaragua to argentina, the latter of which isn't all that healthy. The human race does not understand human behavior well enough, so that we can enforce a paradigm that will ensure our long term prosperity.

&gt;We have a relatively young and growing population so we need a lot more investments than for example Germany. Just look at these age pyramids : France vs Germany.

that is a tower, not a piramid, you need restructuring not more jobs. You need to slowly cut out ineficient jobs and replace them with more productive jobs.

&gt;The EU is a consequence of a lack of vision made by European leaders.

I disagree, they had a lot of vision to make this one up, they just didn't really know what they where doing and had put to little foretough on the economic side. But despite this we are growing, slow and steady and as us easterners catch up, the EU will run increasingly well.

&gt; I just don't think it's feasible because there's not such thing as a European people.

I think political systems are trans national. I think having a common currency among structurally different coutries is more out there than having a single political system span across cultures.(as long as it is limited in funtion, interventionism would not work)

&gt;No. France does not.

good point

&gt;I don't think that we'll ever be. So we are divided, and weaker than if we were able to make our own decisions independently.

You underestimate the importance of propaganda. If there would by a separate electoral system we would develop a european identity and a sense of solidarity. Yes goverment interest would still b a source for pety conflict but we would at least be unified against the outsiders(if you ask me, this should have been the first pillar of the EU, but with egos like france and the UK it was more than unfeasable)

&gt;freedom of movement means immigrants in any EU country can come into another.

No, it means criminals can come and commit crimes, for honest people there are limitations like real estate costs, language barriers and qualifications. It's like arguing Parisians come and steal all the jobs in Ajacion. Some do, but it's far from systemic.

&gt;There's no ""better"" thing than to have a baby

then have one, a young woman will kindly disagree and keep her uterus to herself.

&gt;We are not allies but competitors

again, what, how?

Fiscal harmonisation is tricky, on the one hand your economy will explode and overheat with german laws, on the other germany would slump into regresion with yours. And we would stop paying taxes altogether under both.(the german one is to lax and the french one is overbearing)

Also again, you would take a political tol from the politicians. What would politicians argue about if taxes where fixed?

&gt;The perfect example is the issue of posted worker. Do I really need to explain why it's bad ?

No you need to explain how do you believe that shit. Standards have gone up across the board, there isn't a labor auction, you could argue that there was and still is in outsourceable industries but most industries are immobile. Also most industries that can aford to relocate do so only when there is a massive economy of scale to profit out off.

Well, I'm not in your shoes and haven't been there, but from the examples you gave it looked like it:

&gt; I've tried to set up in-class debates and split the class into groups,

&gt; ""yellow is a great color"" as a topic.

and so on. In all these cases, I feel I would show the same reaction as your students did. And I'm trying to tell you why that is.

&gt; Then what do you suggest?

There are usually two kind of situations where you'd look at both sides: (a) When you already have an opinion, and want to anticipate possible arguments of an opponent so you know how to react to them, and (b) if you don't already have an opinion, so you want to look at the case from all sides to form an opinion. There may be more than two sides in this case, and a possible conclusion is ""well, it's fine either way"".

So don't split the class arbitraily. Let people pick their side (if they have one). Then ask them if they could think about counterarguments from a possible opponent (and explain why it's valuable if they think about those before their opponent does). Collect arguments, counter-arguments, and counter-counter arguments, brain-storming style. Ask those who are neutral to come up with arguments, too. One can always ask questions to hint at more possible arguments. Use a proper topic that is an actual problem that is familiar to the students.

Maybe you have already tried that, I don't know. But if you do it in this or a similar way that doesn't arbitraily assign ""sides"", you remove at least on mental obstacle. It still might not work for other reasons, but at least there's one less obstacle.

&gt; If the students want a career in academia, they have to keep doing it, period. 

When I was at university, I was an assistant, and involved in teaching first years several times (not in arts, like the field you see to be in). One of the most common question was ""in an exam, do we have to solve the problem in exactly that way?"" And the answer always was ""no, you can do it in any way you want, as long as you describe your solution in enough detail so the corrector (me) can understand it and verify if it's correct or not."" 

In any field, there are always certain forms and techniques that are ""traditional"", but they are used because they make sense, and you have to justify them and explain why they make sense. If one cannot justify them anymore, in my opinion they have become dead ballast and shouldn't be used. As a teacher, you should never have to say ""you have to do it that way because that's the way it's done, and you will fail the test if you don't do it that way."". Especially if you are teaching logical and critical thinking.

By the end of 2009 the Cypriot banks had gotten rid of their of their toxic Greek bonds, as recommended, and they had only a small exposure to Greek sovereign debt. They passed that stress test but then they had started to purchase Greek bonds en masse even hiding them from the balance sheets. Which was an insane idea, and when the Greek debt haircut happened it caused huge losses to the exposed Cypriot banks.

That's where I was going: before 2013, there was a close to 50%-50% divide between the pro Russian and the pro EU vote, so when Putin accepted Crimea into the Russian Federation he altered that %, both directly by reducing the number of voters of the Party of the Regions in Ukraine (literally by removing Crimean voters from the Equation) and indirectly by disenfranchising part of the Ukrainians who care neither for Russia nor for Ukraine (but who didn't want a war).

&gt; este año han acudido solo 40% como mucho en estas regiones para manifestar su voto.

Well, they are at war, so it makes sense that many either couldn't vote, weren't allowed to vote or didn't want to vote, both in the rebel held areas and in the frontier zones (places like Kharkiv or Dnepropetrovsk). 

&gt; Entonces 3+5+2,86=10,86 o 36% - que sería el % típico del partido de los regionales + comunistas.

You cannot simply assume what any of them would have voted (specially by extrapolating from pre war data), as both the borders and the situation has changed (I'm sure that many people in the East wanted to speak in Russian, but did most of them want a war?

So a bit of background info: in early September last month, I posted the question “What do you think of Dutch Cuisine?” on  /r/Germany, /r/UnitedKingdom, /r/Belgium, and /r/France and compiled all the responses into a Wordle.


I was very pleased with the results, as was my project coach, and I thought reddit would like to see the results of some reddit based research! 


For those interested: 

We are 5 hospitality students studying in the Netherlands, and our project’s objective is to define the current culinary image of the Netherlands from the perspective of German, British, Belgian, and French tourists, and ultimately use the research data and results to design a culinary image improvement campaign for the Netherlands. 
If you are German, British, Belgian, or French, and have a few minutes to spare, we would truly appreciate it if you could fill out the questionnaire below and share it with a couple of friends!

&gt; how are you linking Germany? 

Feels like home. I changed the kind of groceries I buy and what I cook and now I get upset if I can't find the same stuff when traveling. I like the cold weather. I like the thick walls and the central heating of German houses. I love to take off my shoes at every home I visit. I like to have parks all around town, the calm streets and the always running public transport.

&gt; are you satisfied with your life? 

Yes. My job here is much better than any job I had back in my home country. My SO likes it here too. My only problem is the language, it is still a too-step barrier for me for integration, but I got used to not to understand everything exactly, I hope this improves in the future.

&gt; how was the adaptation period, and what happened after the initial ""honeymoon phase"" (assuming there was one)? 

I would say first year was OK, but not better than before at my home country because the starting salary was pretty bad, but I saw that as an invesment to improve my life in the future. I was OK until the first Winter and my first apartment change, then it was bad. I had to find a new apartment because the first one was temporal and that was a NIGHTMARE. That and my first Winter, were hard times. After that it was much better, found a nice apartment (even far from where I lived before) and things got calm, started enjoying vacation again, got salary raises, etc. I don't feel I had a nice honeymoon, rather, the best times are after 3 years here.

&gt; What you don't like about the place?

At the end, you can complain about everything, everywhere, but these are some of the things that makes me say ""WTF Germany!"" that just came to my mind: Apartment hunting is over complicated. People seems to be OK with wasps and flies flying around food. Popular restaurants are not necessary the ones that offer the best food or the best service. Wage taxes are high. Public transport is expensive. And sometimes people likes to patronize/treat condescendingly too much...

Sometimes the role of king of Moors is played by a black person. But this also leads to some awkwardness, since the play is medieval, and there's a line where Herod asks the king of Moors why he's black. Then the king of Moors sings some cringy lines about his skin colour.

Avec ce mode de pensée, tout gain de productivité équivaudrait à un accroissement du chômage. Or, ce n'est pas le cas ; le début des gains de productivité quasi-exponentiels liés à des machines datent de la première révolution industrielle. 

Ce que l'on peut espérer, par contre, c'est qu'on va arrêter avec ce fétichisme du travail. Oui, il y a de nombreux individus qui sont rapidement dépassés par la production de machines. Non, ce n'est pas grave s'ils ne peuvent travailler et s'ils touchent plutôt une partie des gains générés par ces machines. 

L'histoire économique de la plupart des pays développés, c'est partir d'une situation où quasiment toute la population devait être employée à un effort de production de masse (enfants compris), des droits réduits, et une productivité basse. Et au fil du temps, un resserrement du poids des travailleurs sur le reste de la population, avec une part croissante des individus qui n'ont plus besoin de travailler pour vivre. Tout simplement parce que d'autres individus seront plus productifs ou mieux choisis sous contraintes (droit du travail contraignant, impossibilité de payer en-dessous d'un certain niveau, etc).

De nos jours, on peut se permettre que les enfants, les gens trop âgés ou même ceux n'ayant pas les capacités de bosser au niveau demandé par le système productif puissent tout de même se nourrir, avoir un toit, et même consommer des produits qui étaient autrefois considérés comme du luxe (santé, Internet, high-tech, etc). 

Même en tant que méchant ultra-libéral, je trouve ça magnifique qu'on puisse ainsi permettre à de nombreux individus de vivre leur vie sans se soumettre au salariat. La vraie tragédie, c'est de leur faire croire qu'ils sont des poids, qu'ils sont inutiles, qu'ils ne peuvent rien produire, rien échanger, rien créer, juste parce qu'ils ne sont pas ""insérés"" dans le système productif avec un statut.",0,1414400554,null,0,false,0,clkznh3,t3_2kd19o,t1_clkznh3,t3_2kd19o,null,1426329987,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

Spazzatura in acqua e sulla sabbia, con gli operatori spagnoli del settore che si affannano a pulire mentre teenager inglesi bevono rum a garganella e lanciano la bottiglia sotto l'ombrellone del vicino.

Se vuoi premiare un lavoratore italiano devi farlo a un livello più personale, tipo spostare l'orario di lavoro di mezz'ora che così non è costretto a svegliarsi &lt;6:00 per prendere i mezzi o fargli usare il parcheggio aziendale che la mattina deve accompagnare i reghezzini a scuola o spostarlo dall'ufficio perchè ha scazzi con quello accanto (ancora meglio spostare l'altro) o avviarlo a una nuova mansione perchè si è rotto il cazzo di fare quello che fa o, al limite, dargli un aumento che è già percepito più come valorizzare la persona del lavoro che fa.
Perchè l'italiano si sente più sicuro conoscendo meglio le persone ed avendo con loro rapporti più stretti, che non accumulando più soldi in banca.
La cosa assurda è che sono tutte cose che fino agli anni '70/'80 si facevano, i lavoratori erano soddisfatti e l'economia andava bene.

Theresa May is not well liked by many outside of the Tory party and is positively detested by lots of people online and the generic left, as well as large numbers of foreign nationals. The result has been that her position seems artificially weak as what matters is the Conservative party who are actually going to vote. They tend to lie about who they would vote for dependent on how they feel about Boris relative to Cameron now, not their real intentions in a leadership contest.

Tories tend to do well when they can plausibly claim to be right wing, anti-union and pro-referendum and pro-reform of the EU (despite wanting to remain in to appease business and trade people) while having the air of competence. Theresa May is not obviously more incompetent than Osbourne, Gove or others and appears more competent and boring than Boris. Boris has said a lot about TFL, but May went to the Police Union and ambushed and berated them for an entire speech. Furthermore, Boris might have nominally the advantage on the EU, but May got rid of Qatada and can be more convincing on the actual problems of the thing.

Boris is an adulterous, socially liberal populist with few real principles and many vices. May is boring, right wing but 'sound'.

Sort a like, what if you were actually educating people about the issues they are supposed to be engaged with, instead of separation - ""they have their lives, we have ours"" (and we have a right to be stupid!). 

The problem with that is that the people selecting the two issues and the experts defending them have a lot of power. But political discussion shows are a tv staple already and often enough live footage from plenary parliamentary sessions is available, so I think we have that covered. Most parliamentary work happens in commissions though, not the plenary sessions.",0,1414402343,null,0,false,0,clkzxzv,t3_2kdch2,t1_clkzxzv,t1_clkbogg,null,1426329850,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

false,Kordian,emilia-romagna,,"That's right. To learn a perfect italian pronunciation you have to learn which *zeta* is used in every word.

For instance 

calza (sock) 

zappa (hoe)

use *zeta dolce* d͡z



whereas



stazione (station)

Tiziano (a given name)

use *zeta dura* ʦ



Anyway, many local dictions (not the ""official"" one) use a different pronunciation.


For instance in Emilia-Romagna (where I live) we tend to say ""calza"" with *zeta dura*.



A nice resource I've just discovered could be [this](http://www.dizionario.rai.it/ricerca.aspx) dictionary from RAI (Italy's national public broadcasting company) can help you with the right pronunciation even with an audio support.

&gt; An estimated one million people poured into the streets of Rome on Saturday to protest Prime Minister Matteo Renzi ’s modest efforts to reform Italy’s notoriously labyrinthine labor laws. Led by the country’s largest union, the Italian General Confederation of Labor, or CGIL, the activists want to preserve Italy’s job guarantees as they are. Call it Italy’s economic suicide movement.
&gt; 
&gt; Italy’s labor-market rules have remained largely unreformed since the modern Italian state was established. Spread over some 2,700 pages, the labor code divides the labor force into two parts. Older workers benefit from the full weight of the law, including ironclad protections against being laid off, fired or disciplined, whether for performance or economic reasons. That leaves the remainder of the work force, predominately young, to make do with temporary, freelance and other forms of itinerant work.
&gt; 
&gt; Then there is the Cassa Integrazione Guadagni. Under this income-assistance scheme, businesses that need to downsize can put some workers on “standby,” and the government will cover a significant share of the normal salary until the company can hire back the worker. The program strains the state’s budget, discourages workers from seeking other jobs, and prevents struggling companies from downsizing to stay competitive.
&gt; 
&gt; Need to fire a worker for poor job performance? To do so, businesses must persuade a judge that no alternative short of termination was available—a process of administrative hearings and litigation that can take months and drain company resources. The World Economic Forum in its 2014-15 assessment of labor-market efficiency ranked Italy 141 out of 144 countries for hiring and firing practices, just above Zimbabwe.
&gt; 
&gt; Intractable national unions, which are quick to strike and slow to compromise, exacerbate all these problems. Italy has the largest number of small businesses in the European Union not because companies don’t want to grow, but because they fear growth will mean having to negotiate with the militant national unions like CGIL.
&gt; 
&gt; The unsurprising result of all these barriers to firing and efficiency is that businesses are reluctant to hire. The official unemployment rate stands at 12%, and half of Italy’s young people are unemployed. Given the scale of the problem, Mr. Renzi’s proposed reforms are a start but far from enough.
&gt; 
&gt; The Prime Minister wants gradually to phase out the dual system with the introduction of a single contract that will eventually cover all workers; shift the employment protection from the workplace to the individual employee; and reduce the red tape required to form temporary employment contracts. For this, CGIL boss Susanna Camusso has accused Mr. Renzi of abandoning “social dialogue” to a degree “only seen once before, with Mrs. Thatcher.”
&gt; 
&gt; Italy should be so lucky as to have an Iron Lady. The people protesting this weekend weren’t marching for reasonable workplace protections. They were demanding guaranteed unemployment for millions of their fellow citizens. For the sake of all those out-of-work Italians, and especially the young, Mr. Renzi should stand firm for reform.",0,1414402968,null,0,false,0,cll01qn,t3_2kg7ad,t1_cll01qn,t3_2kg7ad,null,1426329802,16,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,16

We are 5 hospitality students studying in the Netherlands, and our project’s objective is to define the current culinary image of the Netherlands from the perspective of German, British, Belgian, and French tourists, and ultimately use the research data and results to design a culinary image improvement campaign for the Netherlands.

Non percepivo un euro e davanti a me avevo quasi 3 anni di praticantato (sì, 3 anni perché per fare l'esame di abilitazione ci vuole quasi un anno) senza la certezza di passare l'esame al primo tentativo. Aggiungi che odiavo la vita di tribunale (pur amando moltissimo il diritto).

Così dopo 6 mesi di pratica ho deciso di fare un master in corporate law e provare ad entrare in uno studio d'affari. Per fortuna ce l'ho fatta ed ora, più o meno, ho una carriera davanti e faccio un lavoro molto più stimolante ed economicamente gratificante.

Letta was meant to be a placeholder to keep the government while PD would face a congress and resolve the internal strife between Renzi and the old leadership that ""won-but-lost"" the elections.
Enrico Letta is the most traditional centrist politician, like the one tha dominated the political scene before the 90s, his uncle Gianni Letta was the right hand of Berlusconi and both the Lettas are known for being capable of compromise. Enrico Letta successfully managed to form a coalition government with Berlusconi's man (but without Berlusconi).

The problem was that this government lacked the energy and the motivation to do anything and was really just here waiting for PD to decide for his future.

meanwhile Renzi managed to win the internal elections for becoming leader of PD, he managed to create consensus around his proposal of a modern reformist open party and not a closed rigid socialist party like the one that the 'old guard' was leading.
he managed to win the election, and initially though of influencing the goverment by standing outside of it.

but in early 2014 he understood that the Letta government was actually incapable of doing anything and that the European elections could go bad for PD and then another internal fight could erupt.
with that risk in mind he (with the total support of PD) decided to replace Letta with himself and to manage to start a reform process and gain enough popularity to resist to the european elections.

the european election were a suroprise, M5S and Berlusconi went bad and PD got the record result of 40%, thus giving Renzi a popular approvation to his government and leaving him without real opposition within the party.
until now when the new labour law lead to the more left wing members of the party to side with the trade unions against the government.

How German kids are taught is to use Akkusativ when you can ask ""Wen oder was?"" You are correct in that ""einen"" is the Akkusativ for the indefinite article.

Ex: Ich sehe den/einen Lastwagen. 

There is a very closely related case, Nominativ, which is a case for the subject of a sentence. This is probably throwing you off, because the only difference in the articles used for Akkusativ and Nominativ are in masculine singular. If you could ask ""Wer?"" it's Nominativ. 

Ex: Der Lastwagen fährt an mir vorbei.

As for the other **declinations** 

Femininum: Singular die/eine, Plural: die/"" "" (indefinite Plural is  without article)

Maskulinum: Sing. den/einen, Plural: die/"" ""

Neutrum: Sung. das/ein, Plural: die/"" ""

**Nominativ:**

Femininum: Singular die/eine, Plural: die/"" ""

Maskulinum: Sing. der/ein, Plural: die/"" ""

Neutrum: Sung. das/ein, Plural: die/"" ""

So in early September last month, I posted the question “What do you think of Dutch Cuisine?” on the German, British, Belgian, and French subreddits and compiled all the responses into a Wordle.


I thought reddit would like to see the results of some reddit based research! 


For those interested: 
We are 5 hospitality students studying in the Netherlands, and our project’s objective is to define the current culinary image of the Netherlands from the perspective of German, British, Belgian, and French tourists, and ultimately use the research data and results to design a culinary image improvement campaign for the Netherlands. 

If you are German, British, Belgian, or French, and have a few minutes to spare, we would truly appreciate it if you could fill out the questionnaire below and share it with a couple of friends!

All the German parts of the HRE except Austria have been unified. Nobody even considers going back to the earlier principalities. That's only possible when the differences are very small.

&gt;In fact; a whole bunch of states didn't speak primarily english before they joined the states.

You really can't compare the mostly empty colonial states with densely populated European states with a history of centuries if not millenia. Their cultural makeup was very recent and still malleable, like cement that still hadn't dried.

&gt;Don't be mistaken of my sentiment; Vermont and Maine are, for all intents and purposes, pieces of Canada that we took from them, and it's immensely clear that they are more American than they are Canadian. Them being on our side of the border has defined them much more solidly as part of the US than as part of Canada. This isn't Civilization, after all.

The differences between Canada and the USA aren't that big, and the border could have been drawn elsewhere without much problems. They're like Germany and Austria in that regard.

Is that correct?

Do you believe it is right to sacrifice the rights of even 3 Romas because the large majority of them behaves like that?

If for you the majority principle goes as far as that, well sir.....I wonder what laws would you have written in Alabama or Detroit in the 50s. And I am convinced you will declare yourself against racism, against apartheid, against racial discrimination in America, which gave birth to the civil rights movement. Am I correct?

And yet, if you looked at the crime rates back then, or even today (but I do not have data on that) you would have seen how most criminals in America belonged to racial minorities, and people had lots of reasons to believe that if they saw an African American man alone in a certain neighbourhood, he would have been a danger.

Still, Rev. King's movement was not to protect ""only good honest working African Americans"". It was to make sure that nobody would be discriminated as an individual on the base of his/her color. It was to give African American people a chance. It was to make sure that EVERYONE IS JUDGED AS AN INDIVIDUAL.

I am well aware that if you see the majority of a category behaving in a certain way, you male sure to be careful, since you do not trust them on the base of experience. But the moment in which laws are based on personal perception and the rights of individuals don't count anymore, you have to deal with the consequences.

What about special laws for the South of Italy. With tax evasion, mafia and petty crimes rate, I can presume a lot about a southerner. What about ""special laws"" to prevent them from harming the rest of Italy?It's discrimination against the North to allow them to steal State money and keep half the country in a failed State situation. Tough shit for the honest ones.

In german https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salafismus_in_Deutschland

""Hooligans gegen Salafisten"" - ""Hooligans against the salafi movement"" is the name that ""hooligans"" (meaning: violent right-wing extremists who usually chose football matches as their fighting ground) from all over Germany chose, to unite rivaling clans and every right-wing extremist and neo nazi outside of the hooligan millieu. And that's what every german newspaper is writing about. Yesterday's demonstartion isn't portrayed as something it isn't. It's a demonstration led by hooligans and joined by other Nazis.

* Tagesspiegel writes (GOOGLE TRANSLATE):
""The driving force behind the riots in Cologne on Sunday were in the opinion of constitutional advocates violent football hooligans. Right-wing extremists would have connected the movement, but it is not controlled, said the head of the North Rhine-Westphalia Constitution Protection, Burkhard Freier, on Monday in the WDR. The authorities were not surprised in the rest of it.
Police and Protection of the Constitution would have had advance knowledge, ""that here demonstrates a group that consists of different trends: namely violent hooligans, hooligans then overlaps with the right scene,"" Stringer said. Added were violent right-wing extremists from all over Germany: ""parties, the NPD and the party's rights, but also skinheads and the music scene."" Together they had all the violence and an ""aggressive stance against extremist Salafism"".
From the hooligan scene groups had come together, fighting each other, Stringer said. Now believed but to have found a target with which they could show their own strength outwardly and exert violence."" - http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/hooligans-gegen-salafisten-verfassungsschutz-treibende-kraft-waren-nicht-die-rechten/10890360.html

In german https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salafismus_in_Deutschland

""Hooligans gegen Salafisten"" - ""Hooligans against the salafi movement"" is the name that ""hooligans"" (meaning: violent right-wing extremists who usually chose football matches as their fighting ground) from all over Germany chose, to unite rivaling clans and every right-wing extremist and neo nazi outside of the hooligan millieu. And that's what every german newspaper is writing about. Yesterday's demonstartion isn't portrayed as something it isn't. It's a demonstration led by hooligans and joined by other Nazis.

* Tagesspiegel writes (GOOGLE TRANSLATE):
""The driving force behind the riots in Cologne on Sunday were in the opinion of constitutional advocates violent football hooligans. Right-wing extremists would have connected the movement, but it is not controlled, said the head of the North Rhine-Westphalia Constitution Protection, Burkhard Freier, on Monday in the WDR. The authorities were not surprised in the rest of it.
Police and Protection of the Constitution would have had advance knowledge, ""that here demonstrates a group that consists of different trends: namely violent hooligans, hooligans then overlaps with the right scene,"" Stringer said. Added were violent right-wing extremists from all over Germany: ""parties, the NPD and the party's rights, but also skinheads and the music scene."" Together they had all the violence and an ""aggressive stance against extremist Salafism"".
From the hooligan scene groups had come together, fighting each other, Stringer said. Now believed but to have found a target with which they could show their own strength outwardly and exert violence."" - http://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/hooligans-gegen-salafisten-verfassungsschutz-treibende-kraft-waren-nicht-die-rechten/10890360.html

I know it's a bit condescending of me to link Wikipedia, but words have meaning and thesewords as you've used them are hardly a correct description of reality.

I would rather say that Renzi's PD is different, in policies rather than in words, for its openly pro-business rather than pro-labour attitude, as evidenced by the unprecedented set of concessions that Renzi has made to Confindustria in terms of labour reform.

Not for Europe.

&gt; Or is it going to a tread for the sovereignty of European people?

Of course it is, by the very nature of it being a treaty. But I don't think that it's going to be because of ISDS'.

I think the TTIP is dangerous for the quality of life of Europeans because it's going to pit us as workers right against the standard of American workers, and it's going to pit us as consumers right against the standard of American consumers. That's a conflict where economic forces will inevitably push us to adopt their standards rather than the other way around. 

To explain: the US is more competitive than every EU country for a variety of reasons, including a workforce that is much less protected and has many less legally-mandated benefits than us. To close the competitiveness gap we *could* work on strengthening our credit markets and investing as much in innovation as the US, but if our leaders do not have such foresight then inevitably the survival of European companies will come at the price of its workforce working more hours, taking less vacations and having less union rights. The same reasoning applies to consumer standards.

Now, some analysts say that the European economy would benefit from the TTIP, but the numbers I've seen are rather unimpressive. I don't believe in trickle down economis or any such nonesense, so I don't think that a small gain in economic growth that *might* in some way benefit the workers is worth sacrificing our quality of life.",0,1414409304,null,0,false,0,cll18gc,t3_2ke0xd,t1_cll18gc,t3_2ke0xd,null,1426329248,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

&gt;Polygraphy is widely criticized. Despite claims of 90% validity by polygraph advocates, the National Research Council has found no evidence of effectiveness.

&gt;[...]

&gt;In 2003, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) issued a report entitled ""The Polygraph and Lie Detection"". The NAS found that the majority of polygraph research was ""unreliable, unscientific and biased"", concluding that 57 of the approximately 80 research studies that the American Polygraph Association relies on to come to their conclusions were significantly flawed.

&gt;[...]

As an example, look at the transition from feudalism to absolutism, which took the better part of three centuries in (what is today) Germany - and that was a far smaller change than the transition from absolutism to communism/fascism/democracy, which basically involved destroying the organic state in its entirety and pretending demotism is an out-of-the-box replacement. Nobody cared about the outcome, it was inherently assumed that the new system is better. This is a classical example of whig history - the idea that all of history is the history of linear progress from wrong to right, worse to better, and furthermore that it's a ratchet-like process where any changes are improvements by definition and can't be rolled back. I reject that kind of political thought in its entirety.

&gt;Who knows what the future will bring? Only one thing is sure: The boundaries that define the nationstates we all live are vanishing, fast.

We agree on that, but it seems you are mistaking ""is"" for ""should"". Just because I observe something is happening doesn't mean I have to like it. I think the ""globalisation"" model of the Holy Roman Empire was the best we ever had - a close alliance and (mostly) open borders between rulers of ethnically related states, but with no ideological or religious obligations to each other except recognition of a central authority. Where there is no common central authority, there are no open borders either, because anything else undermines the authority. You could argue that the EU is a successor of a kind to the institution of the Holy Roman Emperor of the German people, but it at the same time does more and less than He was supposed to - it enforces political ideology (liberal democracy) on its members, but it fails to provide for their religious freedom in the sense of ""Cuius regio, eius religio"", and the defence from Islam.

My name is Joost De Cock, and I work in the Communication Service of the Directorate-General for Innovation and Technological Support at the European Parliament. (*)

First things first: Reddit.com is no longer blocked at the European Parliament.

No longer. It got blocked at one point because it was included on a list of sites known to distribute malware.
That list of sites is maintained by CERT-EU (the Computer Emergency Response Team of the European Institutions). Unfortunately I have no insight into how reddit.com ended up on the list in the first place.

While we acknowledge that sometimes false positives happen, we choose to err on the safe side, and block all sites on the list.
To make things transparent for the user, we show a specific error message to the end user that explains our reasons for doing so. (this is the message you see in the posted screenshot).

When one of our users raises an issue for a site that is blocked, we look into the matter. If the site is legitimate, we unblock it.


This seems to be what happened here. It's a false positive in what is a largely automated system, that was corrected after somebody complained.


For future reference, the European Parliament only filters sites when we believe they would pose a security risk. 
In other words, if a legitimate site is blocked, call the helpdesk to have it unblocked.

""Strawman"" is a bit like reddit's own ""socialist!"" accusation, it gets thrown out with no reference to what the word actually means.

&gt; the Job Act is reforming the labour market, the Contratto a Tutele Crescenti should prevent exactly what you pointed

Are you seriously saying that a labour reform centered on making it easier to *fire* people and an employment contract that removes labour protections for the first 3 years are supposed to make it easier to *find* a job, in a depressed economy especially?

&gt; so finding a new job at 50 is not impossible while I admit that it need some sacrifices

No, what it requires is having qualifications that can be adapted to working for different companies in such a way that you are competitive in the hiring process against younger people. Your father was in the position of having them, but try and see whether a 50 year old factory worker can 'reinvent himself' well enough to beat out the 17 year old fresh out of school; try and see whether the 50 year old payroll secretary can 'reinvent herself' well enough to beat out the 24 year old fresh out of university.

Exports would increase because of a lower currency. The euro is overvalued for French economy. Your data just proves that the trade balance has worsened.

&gt;Look at the dip imports took during the recesion that is caused by consumers not having enough money to buy foreign

1. There is not one single cause to imports. Basically you have price competitivity and cost competitivity. French exports are more sensible to price competitivity that German exports. I've got a study in French that proves it.
2. Exports would then be increased by a single currency.

&gt;customs would do the same thing

What customs ?

&gt;10% depreciation implies ALL assets loose 10 % of their value, you become funtionally poorer by 10 %, compared to the rest of the world, any investor looses 1/10th of his money. You loose tens of thosand of euros on your property value.

Exactly. It means French products are 10% cheaper. Thus increasing our competitivity and our tourism (do I need to explain the importance of tourism in France ?). It means French projects become 10% cheaper, increasing foreign attractivity.

Overall, depreciation will increase the activity and create jobs. That's exactly what we need.

&gt;And no,10% depreciation is not 2% inflation, maybe per quarter, cumulated with the natural inflation.

Yes it is. UK had a 25% depreciation. Now look at its [inflation](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/inflation-cpi).

&gt;Cost of echange is quite high actually, think of this, to prevent a +-2 cost over a 30 day period most traders pay between 0.2 and .5 % exchange rate insurance.

I'd need a source and example for this. Again, look at Switzerland, UK or Norway.

&gt;Jobs for what?
Can you produce a iphone? No, you produce expensive cheese.

Lol. We're the [6th exportator in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_exports)

We produce a lot more than cheese :)

http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/fra/all/show/2012/

&gt;Can a french man pick up the drop in demand that consumers of expensive cheese dropped. You're wages are to high for internal production to pick up the slack of imports and to low to absorb the excess production of your goods.

I'm not talking of producing iphones. I'm just saying something that has been proven : French economy is more price sensitive that German's economy. Which means a 10% depreciation would increase activity a lot.

&gt;You can asses your structural issues within the EU(and with the whole of the EU as market), proactively

Yeah, what was advised by the EU commission was to lower the wages and reduce social standards. I'd rather have a depreciation than this kind of internal deflation.

&gt;I know countries are different, but isolating yourself does not promote growt

It's not isolation. Is Switzerland isolated ? Is South Korea isolated ?

It's simply having a monetary policy that's compatible with our economy. Not having to change our structure to please EU commission.

&gt;inflation and isolationism just kicks the can into the future, and you avoid adressing the fact that you aren't competitive and you protect yourself from becoming so.

It does increase price competitivity. Increasing cost competitivity is not sufficient to get our economy in a better state. It's just a different model. We can't all be Germany or Luxembourg.

&gt;The common currentcy increased velocity(a side effect of a increase in transactions) and that increased inflation diffirences. Again, it's not the euro.

How is it not the euro ?

&gt;Tell me ONE.

Again :

http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/fra/all/show/2012/

&gt;that is a tower, not a piramid

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_pyramid

&gt;you need restructuring not more jobs. You need to slowly cut out ineficient jobs and replace them with more productive jobs.

So does everyone.

&gt;But despite this we are growing, slow and steady and as us easterners catch up, the EU will run increasingly well.

We are not growing. 

http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/gdp-growth

http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/64217ffa-2946-11e4-baec-00144feabdc0.html

&gt;I think political systems are trans national. I think having a common currency among structurally different coutries is more out there than having a single political system span across cultures.

Could you please elaborate on this one ? I don't really get what you mean.

&gt;If there would by a separate electoral system we would develop a european identity and a sense of solidarity. Yes goverment interest would still b a source for pety conflict but we would at least be unified against the outsiders

Which outsiders ?

That's a main problem. All countries in the EU have different allies. Just look at the mess with Ukraine. Just look at the mess with the war in Irak. That's just not feasible IMO.

&gt;No, it means criminals can come and commit crimes, for honest people there are limitations like real estate costs, language barriers and qualifications. It's like arguing Parisians come and steal all the jobs in Ajacion. Some do, but it's far from systemic.

Of course there are barriers and limitations. Still if you don't respect the freedom of movement there are sanctions. Just look at what happens with Switzerland's immigration quotas.

&gt;then have one, a young woman will kindly disagree and keep her uterus to herself

My point was to say that's it's not a question of ""better"". And I know many women that would happily have babies and take care of them instead of having to work shitty jobs.

&gt;again, what, how?

We compete on products (for example agriculture between Germany and France), we compete on fiscality (Ireland), we compete on geopolitical issues (Ukraine).

&gt;What would politicians argue about if taxes where fixed?

What taxes and fixed by who ?

&gt;Standards have gone up across the board

It's the opposite. In Germany, 1 euro jobs. I'm not even talking about Spain or Greece.

È vero che per la “vecchia guardia” della mafia siciliana (e stiamo parlando di, boh, fino agli anni 80?) c'erano cose che non si toccavano, per questioni etiche (tipo droga e prostituzione). È anche vero che detta vecchia guardia è stata progressivamente spazzata via/rimpiazzata (piú o meno violentemente), sostituita da giovani piú attenti all'aspetto piú prettamente economico dei “mercati”, allargando le linee d'azione (non solo a spaccio, prostituzione, traffico di persone, ma anche con un coinvolgimento diretto nell'imprenditoria, nella finanzia, nella politica) . È molto interessante a tal fine leggere le cose dette/scritte da alcuni pentiti (molti dei quali, appunto, della “vecchia guardia”).

La questione della “mafia buona” è anche questa storia vecchia: fino agli anni '70, la mafia era una questione principalmente della sicilia orientale (area d'influenza palermitana); è stato solo a partire dagli anni '70 che la mafia si è diffusa e rafforzata anche nella zona occidentale, e soprattutto nel catanese, in una forma che si cercò di pubblicizzare come “positiva”, perché “mafia imprenditoriale”, “portatrice di lavoro” (vedi anche la storia dei [quattro cavalieri dell'Apocalisse](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quattro_cavalieri_dell'apocalisse_mafiosa)).

A chi fosse interessato ad approfondire suggerisco caldamente non solo gli scritti di Fava (per chi riesce a trovare), ma anche (o soprattutto) i volumi di [Salvatore Lupo](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvatore_Lupo) (la cui storia professionale è anche abbastanza interessante).",0,1414415175,null,0,false,0,cll2u9b,t3_2kg6ti,t1_cll2u9b,t3_2kg6ti,null,1426328499,8,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,8

Also, if you got just by lexical similarities, there are plenty of common words between Latvian and Estonian due to common Livonian (the country, not the language) past, also grammatical structures are pretty close, despite there being absolutely no linguistical relationship - Estonian and Livonian(languages) are not even indo European.

Pronouncation rules in Latvian, Lithuanian and Estonian are almost identical... Until you get to stressing rules, yes. Lithuanian is weird about them, Latvian always stresses first syllable. Thus a Lithuanian would be able to read out a text in Latvian (or Estonian, Livonian or Finnish for that matter) without understanding it, but sounding about right, but it is not possible to do the same with a text in Lithuanian.

false,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Why are ""soccer hooligans"" in Europe politically active? 

The phenomenon varies a lot between countries and there is no single why to cover all of it. Not all football fan clubs are politically active. And the political activity is more pronounced in some countries.

But basically (and not in any way comprehensively, I hope others with expertise get bothered enough to add):  

1.What?  
In some European countries you'll find some football fan clubs clearly aligning either to the right or to the left, and some to the far ends of the spectrum. I don't know if there are moderate centrist football fan clubs, but if there are they sure don't seem to riot about it. And then there's also many fan clubs not particularly engaged in political activity, not clearly aligned politically, or with politically heterogeneous member base.

Ideologies vary a lot, it's a smörgåsbord from extremes of socialism to anti-racism to nationalism or even xenophobia, and ideologies do not always correlate on the traditional left-right spectrum. For example, I believe one can find leftist football fan clubs peppered with nationalism.

Most often the fan clubs are negligible as a political force, depending on the country, and most often their political messages are limited to good will activities such as raising cancer awareness, anti-racism, charities for the homeless, children's hospitals etc. 

But potentially, if the fan clubs unite behind a common cause, they could become a significant factor of political change - a recent example being Ukrainian ultras uniting against the Yanukovich regime. And vice versa, sometimes an authoritarian regime (e.g. in Belorussia) may abuse the fan clubs and guarantee their subservience to the regime by making them dependent on the current political elite by funding, favours, by not investigating their possible criminal activity, by abusing the judiciary system, or by seeing that the fan club leadership is regime's 'made men'.

2.How?  
The political stance or alignment of a football club may manifest in many ways. Sometimes just simply that a person identifies for example as a leftist and hence is more likely to join a traditionally leftist fan club, and this self-selection process tends to keep the fan base leftist even without any actual political activity by the fan club.  
And sometimes a political message is publicly shared between fan clubs such as public statements of anti-racism policies, and not exclusively European as also North American sports clubs share those.  
Some fan clubs are clearly engaged in political activity, making noise about it, and attracting new members by it. The political activity itself varies a lot between clubs from promoting election candidates to rioting. Often the more extreme the ideologies the more noise they make, and this is one of the reasons we often tend to hear about those subscribing to nationalism or even xenophobia.  
In some countries the political establishment may use some of the suitable fan clubs to further their goals, and OTOH the political activities by a fan club may be very much anti-establishment.

3.Why?  
Populism, opportunism, and especially history. Different European countries have a different past and that's one of the reasons the phenomenon varies so much between countries.  

Often it can be traced back merely to old class divisions which may or may not be relevant today. To put it simply: a long time ago a bunch of well-to-dos established a football club in a university and it became the club that the well-to-dos of the city supported. The workers in the same city couldn't join the well-to-do club and established their own competing football clubs the workers supported. The result was separate clubs with different fan bases with different political views. And over many decades that division became a tradition: even if the football clubs themselves are not politically aligned any more, and the actual players are hired millionaires not proclaiming relevant political opinions, a right-winger is more likely to support the traditional well-to-do's club and a leftist the traditional worker's club.

In some countries there have been traumatic events such as civil wars with deep divisions and some of those remaining either by continuous division or by tradition. For example, after the civil war in Finland also the sports clubs were divided along the 'whites' or 'reds' lines, and that tradition carried on for a long time with separate sports organisations even after the civil war division itself was mostly gone after the unifying effect of the Soviet invasion. Hence we still have two competing sports associations: The Finnish Amateur Athletic Association and The Finnish Workers’ Sports Federation with their respective remnants of political alignments and connections. But generally the football or hockey fan clubs are not engaged in political activity, albeit to some extent there's at least some tendency for a right winger and a left winger to identify with particular teams.

And some European countries endured under dictatorships or authoritarian regimes for decades during the 20th century. The extreme ideologies of those regimes, communism and fascim, saw sports as political activity of and for the masses, and they very much used it as such. In those countries the ruling regime made sports a political arena where also the fan clubs were supposed to provide their support for the regime.

&gt;&gt;*For a topical guide to this subject, see [Outline of the metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_the_metric_system).*

&gt;The __International System of Units__ (abbreviated __SI__ from [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): *Le __S__ystème __I__nternational d'Unités*) is the modern form of the [metric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system) and is the world's most widely used [system of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_of_measurement), used in both everyday [commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce) and [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science). It comprises a [coherent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(units_of_measurement\)) system of [units of measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_measurement) built around seven [base units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit), 22 named and an indeterminate number of unnamed coherent [derived units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_derived_unit), and a set of [prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix) that act as decimal-based multipliers. It is part of the [International System of Quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Quantities).

&gt;The standards, published in 1960 as the result of an initiative started in 1948, are based on the [metre–kilogram–second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mks_system_of_units) (MKS) system, rather than the [centimetre–gram–second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centimetre%E2%80%93gram%E2%80%93second_system_of_units) (CGS) system, which, in turn, had several variants. The SI has been declared to be an evolving system; thus prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses and the precision of measurements improves. The 25th [CGPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Conference_on_Weights_and_Measures) meeting in the final quarter of 2014 will consider a proposal to change the definitions of some base units, particularly the [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram). 

&gt;====

&gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/D8qNoUe.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SI_base_unit.svg) - *The seven SI base units and the interdependency of their definitions. Clockwise from top: kelvin \(temperature\), second \(time\), metre \(length\), kilogram \(mass\), candela \(luminous intensity\), mole \(amount of substance\) and ampere \(electric current\). The second of time, kelvin and kilogram are defined independently of any other base units. The metre is defined in terms of the speed of light, so depends upon the definition of the second. The definitions of the other base units are more complicated.*

No one is going to enforce them on any bus, or ban them from normal bus. That's against the law. But as they organize special trains for soccer hooligans, to keep them separated from normal, non drunk and noisy citizens, and no one call it segregation because of an idea, it's the same in this case.

&gt; I am well aware that if you see the majority of a category behaving in a certain way

A lion bites you once. Another lion bites you twice. After a while, you stop sticking your hand in random feline cages. Is that prejudicial, or just trying to keep your hands stuck to your forearm?

&gt; But the moment in which laws are based on personal perception and the rights of individuals don't count anymore, you have to deal with the consequences.

Every choice has consequences. People over there is already dealing with the consequences of fair play, and they don't like it. If they were italians, behaving like that, things would have been easier.

&gt; What about special laws for the South of Italy. 

In Naples, they have special laws for garbage disposal. Is that prejudice? No, simply those laws are not needed in the rest of Italy, because people doesn't burn it in the street. Is that prejudicial and racist too?

Not being racist means giving anyone the same OPPORTUNITIES, and letting everyone face the same CONSEQUENCES if they miss those opportunities. Those guys are missing them and they are fine with them. They will have to be fine with consequences. 

I respect and admire your politically correct stand, and in principle I agree with that. But when comes to finding an everyday solution to such problem, the problems are:

* there are people who piss on laws
* we have no money and political strenght to enforce them
* there is a conflict against rights, and no way of a catch-20

Giving an extra bus is just wasting other italian money to comply with people who often lacks the basic civilization and cooperation, and we are getting called racist for that.

Finding that 40% of the people agree with the CGIL position on the labour reform means, unsurpsingly, that they agree with the CGIL **on the labour reform**. I put it in bold, again, hoping you might stop forgetting about it.

&gt; according to 68% of voters have a negative opinion of Trade Unions

First of all no, that's not what the poll says, that's your interpretation of it.

&gt; that's what I was saying on them being less popular than Renzi, even on Labour Market issues

We have a poll that literally asked people what they would have voted on the labour market reform. You are trying to counter it with a poll that asked them about their opinion of labour unions. Do you not see the *non sequitur* here? even assuming that 68% of people have indeed said they have a negative opinion of trade unions (which is not what that poll finds, but let's assume it anyway), even forgetting that there are 3 major labour unions in this country and the CGIL is one of them (the largest and most popular), **it would still not mean that people disagree with it on the specific issue of labour reform**. We have actual, direct confirmation that a plurality of people agree with it on this specific issue.

&gt; Are you seriously thinking that as of today you have protections?

More than I would have under the Jobs Act, but more importantly if the problem is that some people don't have adequate employment protection then the solution is not to strip everyone of labour protection, it's to give labour protections to those that don't have them.

&gt; today the vast mojority of ""first jobs"" are done without any protection as internship, project contracts, partite IVA because work employer does not want to risk to hire new workers giving them straight away all of the protections that 'tempo indeterminato' gives you (among them the virtual impossibility to being fired)

Except it's actually already [very easy](http://i.imgur.com/5cHoVGJ.jpg) to fire people in Italy, and the country has [one of the lowest employment protection scores](http://i.imgur.com/8AFzpo0.png) in Europe, having done [more than anyone else](http://i.imgur.com/mRbog9z.png) to deregulate it. The idea that it's hard to fire people in Italy is a complete fabrication, especially since the Fornero reform eliminated the possibility of workplace reinstatement.

The *real* reason why employers are abusing temp contracts, internships and project contracts is that they afford the employer an immense amount of power over his employees, who are entirely at his mercy. Employees without any job security accept lower wages, don't unionize, don't speak up when their rights are being infringed upon and oftentimes are even less expensive in tax terms.

Zu den Argumenten: Die halte ich für daneben und vielfach nur für Schutzbehauptungen, um ihre Homophobie darin zu verstecken.

1. Es geht um Gleichbehandlung, nicht Bevorzugung. Aber Gleichbehandlung soll es in deren Welt ja nicht geben.
2. Nicht unsere Sexualmoral ist neu, deren ist nicht mehr zeitgemäß und hat dem gesellschaftlichen Druck nicht standgehalten. Diese Christenclubs geben sich in der Öffentlichkeit regelmäßig der Lächerlichkeit preis, wenn sie mit ihrem antiquierten Weltbild hausieren gehen.
3. Hat keiner etwas dagegen. Wir sollten unbedingt anfangen bei Theologie strengere Standards anzulegen.
4. Ich bin für Ehe und Familie. Aber wir haben hier eine institutionelle Diskriminierung homosexueller Lebenspartnerschaften, die immer noch keine Ehe schließen dürfen. Ich vermute die meinen hier aber nur die heterosexuelle Ehen und Familien. Ansonsten kann ich jedenfalls nicht erkennen, warum die Tatsache, dass Kindern mit gesellschaftlichen Realitäten konfrontiert werden, Ehe und Familie herabwürdigt.

false,[deleted],null,null,"This is highly optimistic and idealistic. Anti-corruption measures, who should be doing it, there is nobody who would not be corrupted enough that nobody would trust them. Would be just another way to punish the opposition of whatever party rules. The history of this country is that it can always get worse, and not doing things the worst possible way is already something, a good way is not really expected. The rich either hide their income or get it out of the country, and the middle class had similar avenues as well, while the brunt of taxation was born by the typical schoolteacher type person. For example the single-bracket, flat-rate tax was introduced largely because pretty much everybody can hide most of their income and report only a minimum wage. It was unfair to have those few who cannot or are too honest to, bear the brunt of it. 

The only possible way of soaking the rich would be luxury consumption taxes, but then they would only travel more abroad. 

For example a few years ago a wealth tax on expensive houses was levied. Of all Budapest two families reported and paid it. Everybody else just betted on that the government cannot figure out the value of their home.

Even if something like this would work, it would be still true that most owners are foreign corporations who remove profits and do not spend them here. But attacking them too much would not work, because we need another at least half million jobs, from foreign investors, as we have no money to invest. Besides, the very people who protest now would protest 10x as much, generally speaking the government is nationalist, the opposition is internationalist, globalist-capitalist so they would protest double hard.

Given these circumstances, the only possible improvement was to at least somewhat shift the burden from the lowest classes or the remaining few. One way was for example cutting the income tax, single bracket, as few people would have legal income in higher ones anyway they would cheat, and instead making the worlds highest VAT, 27% with 18% for food and even lower for utilities. VAT is normally regressive, but as the poor spend most of their money on food and utilities, not that much regressive, and the important aspect is at least shifting the burden from the honest to the dishonest, as VAT is much harder to cheat with. So this way at least the basic minimum of not fucking a small number of unlucky people but making sure more or less everybody including the richer  folks shares the burden.

It was a loose imperial federation. The institution of the Holy Roman Emperor of the German people was supposed to defend its subjects from external threats, but internal conflicts were either permitted, or the Emperor intervened by taking a side in them.

&gt;That's got to be the most perverted definition of ""religious freedom"" I've ever come across. It means that people are allowed to worship whatever they fucking please, not the freedom of the state to enforce it.

""Cuius regio, eius religio"" means that the ruler has the *duty* to enact and enforce an official religion, whereas his subjects have the *freedom* to move elsewhere in the Holy Roman Empire, to become the subject of a ruler who agrees with their religion. It's Exit-based political participation, and it amounts to more religious freedom than the present set-up, because people were free not only to believe in whatever religion (provided they went to live under a ruler that practiced it), but also to follow its dictates, which is not the case today.

The institution of a secular demotist government combined with all-out radical religious tolerance is more oppressive against any single Christian religion than the Holy Roman Empire was after the peace of 1555, by far.

Do you know anything about the current politico-economic climate?

Do you know how long it would take to ratify deals with India and China, much farther away from the Russian body workforce in the west, and the likely poorer nature of those deals for Russia given both state's history of dealing and Russia's own self-imposed pariah status? Do you know how long it would take to construct pipelines to these nations once those deals had been ratified, or the vastly increased cost and risk given the far less traversible terrain of Central Asia and the Himalayas?

&gt; Nuclear Energy isn't a solution because of the waste problem

Oh please, take your mind out of the tabloid rags and Walt-Disney era storytelling; nuclear waste has been safely and econmically stored for decades and this process is only going to get cheaper and safer with advancements, not *less* so.

&gt; and the supply with uranium isotopes

Explain to me what you *think* this means.

&gt; And don't mention a new technology producing more isotopes than needed. It's like the cold fusion a nice idea, but far from reality. 

Are you simply not aware that there are dozens and dozens of perfectly functioning nuclear plants dotted around the EU right now, at this very moment, as we speak? We're not talking about *inventing* some new technology here, we're talking about the long-overdue investment in a current, fully-tested and fully operating industry and the application of that industry to our benefit.

La prima volta che ho guidato su un'autostrada tedesca, dove ho portato una Chevrolet Orlando a 195km/h con i tergicristalli che fischiano e una bombola di ossigeno sotto il sedile che se per sbaglio faccio un incidente divento un fuoco d'artificio.

La prima volta che ho fatto l'ultimo pezzo della pista da sci Martinella Nord (nera) di Fondo Grande (altopiano di lavarone/folgaria) a uovo per non dover racchettare sul collegamento attraverso l'altopiano.

Quando un bambino mi è caduto davanti su un collegamento tra due piste da sci e per evitare di ammazzarlo sono finito per una decina di metri rotolando in un burrone senza neve. Giacca da sci con strappi sulla manica, un attacco dello snowboard distrutto, lama interna della tavola da buttare, fondo completamente graffiato, una delle due punte della tavola scheggiata, cellulare salvo per miracolo.

Il primo salto sbagliato sullo snowboard. Mi sono inclinato troppo e sono caduto sulla spalla. Ora mi hanno diagnosticato la Sindrome della Cuffia, che non è altro che i tendini della spalla lesionati a seguito di un trauma, e porta a una predisposizione per l'infiammazione, e se non ci sto attento, anche alla rottura degli stessi.

Il primo incidente in auto. Arrivavo a 50/h (avevo davanti uno che stava girando e auto dall'altra corsia), e una mi esce dallo stop senza fermarsi. La prendo in piena ruota posteriore, accartocciando la carrozzeria, distruggendo il semiasse e bloccando la portiera (era una opel corsa degli anni 2000, io guidavo la mia fida Polo III. ACCIAIO E LAMIERA). La mia macchina ha riportato solo qualche graffio sul paraurti, una listella della griglia del radiatore rotta e il cofano un po' sollevato rispetto a prima.

Prendiamo lo skylift per raggiungere la cima in mezzo al bianco, vedevo solo l'ombra del babbo davanti a me. Stiam salendo per circa 10 minuti e non siamo ancora arrivati per cui mi urla di sganciarci e gettarci sulla pista a destra e iniziare la discesa. Io lo faccio e parto, quando arrivo alla base mi giro e mio padre è sparito, la funivia che ci ha portato su è spenta e sono praticamente da solo sul bordo di un precipizio.

Più tardi incontro alcuni dei professionisti che son arrivati pure loro e mi chiedono cosa stia facendo lì. Spiego la situazione, uno di loro risale con lo skylift e un'ora dopo scende recuperando mio padre che era caduto in pista e non era riuscito a rialzarsi. Ci spiegano che siamo stati molto imprudenti perché in quelle condizioni era rischioso sciare e quella pista non era adatta ai dilettanti di per sé.

La funivia era stata fermata perché non sicura: per tornare giù in paese dobbiamo farcela a piedi con gli sci sulle spalle. Non ricordo ancora quanto ho camminato in mezzo alla tormenta, so solo che ho visto una bandiera austriaca in mezzo al niente e mi spiegarono che eravamo al confine con l'Austria. 

Un evento simile si verificò al confine svizzero, sempre con mio padre. Ricordo una discesa praticamente verticale, ghiacciata e non so come ho fatto a non ammazzarmi. Lo skylift per tornare indietro era un sedile monoposto su un percorso orizzontale, con baratro sotto di me, sempre nel mezzo di una tormenta. Ricordo di esser morto di paura su quel sedile, traballava tutto ed ero convinto che sarei caduto di sotto. Ho visto mio padre darsi coraggio sul sedile di fronte al mio bevendo una generosa quantità di grappa dalla fiaschetta omologata.

Exact. Face au problème des gains de productivité, il y a en fait deux façon de régler les problèmes économiques tout en évitant la déflation : 

* réduire le temps de travail (ou mettre les gens au chômage, c'est pareil).

* augmenter la richesse des travailleurs afin d'écouler les surplus de production : tout le monde travail autant, mais en devenant beaucoup plus riches. Le problème de cette solution est la limite des ressources auxquelles nous avons accès.

It's not politically correct. It's mostly informed by history. It's not by accident that the biggest remarks against these kind of ""solutions"" here have been made by Germans. They have been well educated about consequences of minority policy in history, unlike most of us in the rest of Europe.

&gt; But when comes to finding an everyday solution

That is the problem. Everyday solutions, as most italian solutions, are short sighted and do not aim at eradicating the problem, aiming just at putting a patch right here and now, and who cares about the future. The most cost-effective policy is a long term one.

&gt; Feel free to propose a better solution, and I'll try to explain why it is ineffective.

Now this is funny, and unvoluntarily ironic. You don't even care about other solutions, they are automatically ineffective to you!This solution sounds appealing to you, since it removes the bad smell from your everyday surroundings, and thus it's automatically the most effective policy.

I'm not even sure it's worth it to find the real, long term effective solutions in these conditions. No mayor will be thanked for that. For people it seems far more satisfying to apply the fastest, most Roma-free-humiliating-sectarian solution right now, and screw the rest. If one analyses public policy input and impact around the world, it's typical of less developed countries.

Both Akkusativ and Dativ use ""den"" as an article.

For Akkusativ, this is when the noun is masculine singular. Example: der Hase becomes den Hasen.

For Dativ, this is when the definite noun is in plural form. Example: den Wagen. 

Also, I understand Akkusativ usage to be applied when it refers to the direct object of the verb, and for Dativ, indirect object of the verb. 

In a normal sentence, it's pretty easy to figure out which is which. For instance, ""Ich kaufe der Frau *(indirect object)* die Karte *(direct object)*.""

But what happens when both objects are used with ""den""?

Let's use this sentence: Ich kaufe den Hasen den Wagen

How do I know the sentence means I'm buying the cars for the rabbit and not the other way round? Is it simply a matter of word order? Is it common sense? Or am I missing something?

Personalmente, studio Ingegneria Gestionale al PoliMI (con indirizzo orientato alla Data Analysis applicata al Marketing ed alla Business Optimization, quindi parliamo di livelli di statistica e ricerca operativa almeno pari a Ing. Matematica, se proprio serve confrontare) ed ogni volta che mi è stato richiesto di confrontare insegnamenti e programmi ho riscontrato sostanziale similarità tra noi ed altre facoltà nelle materie più ingegneristiche ed un approfondimento di gran lunga superiore nelle discipline economiche e di business. Per giunta, da noi lo stesso Rettore e gran parte del management della scuola provengono dalla Facoltà di Ingegneria Gestionale, mentre la School of Management genera una parte estremamente consistente delle revenue di tutta l'università, così come gli studenti sono molto ricercati nei rispettivi ambiti di studio (dall'ottimizzazione delle supply chain alla consulenza specialistica, dalla gestione di sistemi produttivi allo studio dei dati finalizzato al miglioramento delle catene del valore). C'è un motivo se le maggiori aziende del mondo, di ogni settore, investono miliardi ogni anno sia sulla Engineering Management sia sulla consulenza specialistica finalizzata all'ottimizzazione dove spesso i team di lavoro prevedono la presenza di Ingegneri Gestionali.

Io porto il massimo rispetto per qualunque ambito di studio affronti una persona, sia essa anche Scienze delle Merendine, ma se una persona non riesce a comprendere l'importanza di un ambito di studio e si sente per questo autorizzata ad insultare gratuitamente (se frequenti un Politecnico sai bene di cosa parlo), per me è solo mentalmente limitata e la sua prestigiosissima laurea in qualunque Ingegneria equivale veramente al nulla.",0,1414419412,null,0,false,0,cll4hal,t3_2k7o0s,t1_cll4hal,t1_cll01lh,null,1426327734,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

false,[deleted],null,null,"Not exactly an answer to your question and just in case you didn't notice yet:

Once you figured out when to use der, die, das, den, dem etc., it is very easy find out the corresponding indefinite article.

de*n* or ih*n* -&gt; eine*n*,
de*m* or ih*m* -&gt; eine*m*,
da*s* or e*s* -&gt; eine*s* (though mostly you just use *ein*),
di*e* or si*e* -&gt; ein*e*,

etc.

This also works vice versa, so if you have the sentence

&gt; Das Mädchen isst eine*n* Apfel,

you can conclude that you will need the definite article de*n* here:

&gt; Das Mädchen isst de*n* Apfel.

This works even if you use what looks like a male article (der) to indicate the dative of a female word:

Ich gebe de*r* Frau de*n* Apfel. -&gt; Ich gebe eine*r* Frau eine*n* Apfel.

So, there are quite a few forms, but you don't really have to remember all of them.

You will encounter this pattern a lot, e.g. when you are confronted with all the different words for this/these (dieser, diesen, dieses, diesen, diesem etc.):

di*e*/ein*e* -&gt; dies*e*,
da*s*/eine*s* -&gt; diese*s*,
de*r*/eine*r* -&gt; diese*r*,
de*n*/eine*n* -&gt; diese*n*,
de*m*/eine*m* -&gt; diese*m*,

etc.

And as for Mädchen: every word on the diminutive -chen is neuter. I think ""Mädchen"" was originally ""Mägdchen"", which translates to ""little maid"" (with Magd/maid being a feminine word in German). So Germans don't really consider girls to be objects, the neutral article is just because of the diminutive.",0,1414419945,null,0,false,0,cll4pvr,t3_2kfasi,t1_cll4pvr,t3_2kfasi,null,1426327623,2,false,German,t5_2qq51,2

Oui, on ne fait pas d'omelette sans casser des oeufs. Mais il y a des facteurs qui limitent cet effet, à mon avis.  
a) Si tu fais augmenter l'essence dans tous les pays d'Europe (progressivement, hein, pas d'un seul coup), il y aura forcément un effet inflationnaire et une répercussion sur les salaires aussi.  
b) Puisque l'État récupère des tonnes de fric par le biais de la taxation, ils peuvent en redistribuer une partie en aide social pour compenser la perte de pouvoir d'achat des plus pauvres.

It really makes the narrative of the anti-camp fall flat on its face. It's not a depiction of a slave by his colonial masters, it's the depiction of a small but plausible danger to European children to scare them with.

&gt;It's blackface, alright

No, it's not. That has a completely different context and you have to be willfully blind to ignore the difference between a person who is more of a type of clown ""Look, I'm dressing up like a nigger hur hur!"" on one side, and two persons who are dressing up to look like semi-historical figures, in this case a Turkish/Spanish bishop and a Moorish slaver. Shall we abolish the whole of the tradition while we're at it too, because a clergyman who invites children to sit on his lap and gives them candy must be a pedophile, right?

It's actually so ironic it makes my head spin. We have a cultural tradition that encourages children to * **cheer** upon the arrival of a boat full of people who look like Africans*, and people who pretend they are against racism and want more compassion with African immigrants arriving by boat in the Mediterranean are now *actively campaigning to destroy that tradition*. If there were no Africans among Sinterklaas' companions, they would probably be whining for quota.

&gt; and it's not something a society that wants to pretend to respect its racial minorities and colonial past should be uncritical of.

The main motivation of people arguing against Zwarte Piet is to feel better about themselves by posing as morally superior. They have no sense what the tradition means (both historically and socially), and it's no surprise that a lot of American identity group activists were involved from the start.

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I don't think you Europeans (#notAllEuropeans) understand how naïve you sound when you make posts like this.

Most theories of racism were made in America where black people behaved really much, much better. For example the fact that some phone companies in the 1950 made it official policy to discriminate and not to employ black people, which suggests quite some black people were qualified, learned and motivated enough to do an office job. Otherwise there would have been no point.

But how does this apply to a country where you get 0 Roma applicants to an office job?

There are racism tests made in America, Sweden etc. about office job applicants with minority sounding names. This would be unnecessary in Hungary or Romania: there are no office job applicants who are Roma. It is not tha they are not desirable: people cannot even decide if they would be desirable, you just don't see them applying at all. 

I think prejudice is still wrong but just try to realize how different it is, and how hard is to not be racist in a country where there are 0 Roma MLK type pastors, no Roma pastors at all nor priests, no Roma going to church in suits then demonstrating in said suits, no Roma accountants, lawyers, otherwise career working people, and even a blue collar worker draws a bit surprised remark?

We need to solve it somehow, but just try to appreciate the difficulty of it. The equivalent of the black ""elite"" that basically made everybody believe they can be useful members of society is missing and it makes making progress HARD.

Maybe we need to start from a step much, much behind than America started with blacks in the sixties. Boost up a few Roma to be teachers, policemen, accountants, lawyers so that we can at least make people believe they can work. Because currently, it is much worse. Even in the heydays of racism there were black shopkeepers and mechanics (in segregated black areas) in America, but there is literally zero Roma shopkeepers and mechanics here. Segregated black areas had barber shops and suchlike ran by enterprising blacks. Roma villages have nothing here, absolutely no enterprise.

And this is why it is so much harder to do something with prejudice. Prejudiced, racist people tend to generalize bad examples and ignore good ones. Here you often don't see a good example.

You know why? I think because racism can be addressed if a country has an improving quality of living. **If EVERYBODY is getting poorer then everybody will be more and more of an asshole.** And the non-Roma asshole will express the poverty generated assholeness with hatred, the Roma asshole will express the same with crime.",0,1414421925,null,0,1414422289,0,cll5mw4,t3_2kd7xe,t1_cll5mw4,t1_clkg6a8,null,1426327125,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Projections that go decades into the future are highly spurious, especially when they're about something fickly as economic growth.

&gt;Your antithesis towards population growth and immigration shows that you're implying that the few billions of poor people living off mostly subsistence agriculture are to be blamed for the industrialised societies' resource overhaul, and the fear that it will affect the climate and the future resource pool like freshwater, minerals, w/e.

They will. Either they reach a high level of prosperity, either by local development or migration, and then their resource demands will increase accordingly. Or they stay where and how they are and then they'll be forced to destroy resources in the long term to stay alive in the short term.

&gt;You can have an industrial comples run with 20 employees off in the northern parts of Canada poluting as much as 10million rural peasants.

Show me the numbers. Again, are you going to prevent those rural peasants from building industry?

&gt;Food can be grown sustainably for the peope who will inhabit earth for the next hundreds of years. Technological, scientific, and sociological leaps can achieve that. Logistics and organising factors have to advance, in order for the less-economically empowered people of developing world to have a sufficient food source, and in turn, their rise as economic powerhouses benefit everyone else aswell, as in the case of China.

Sure, and I guarantee you that those investments won't happen if we don't get the largest part of the population out of survival mode, and that won't happen as long as people will need to keep competing for scarce jobs. You cannot just assume that the necessary improvements materialize out of thin air just when we need them. That would belie a suicidal belief in divine providence.

those referenced to the dollar, european exports would plummet due because they would cost more compared with ""internal products"". Now if you are japan, you care about other markets, but I think most of France's exports don't leave the continent.

&gt;French exports are more sensible to price competitivity that German exports.

What? Explicitly what do you mean, in practice.

Also I was talking about imports, you import a lot of crap, so do we this is a unfortunate consequence of uninformed consumers and aggressive marketing in a globalised world. THe point is those people want iphones, if iphones become to expensive they will buy second hand iphones, they will not console themselves with alcatels. 

&gt;Thus increasing our competitivity and our tourism (do I need to explain the importance of tourism in France ?

Do I need to explain what a sorry industry it, it is higly volatile, it creates low end seasonal jobs  and it has no economic ramifications. It's a industry even grecce realised is pathetic to create a budged out of and you want to become poorer just so you can compete with grecce or portugal. Sorry but that is insane.

&gt; It means French projects become 10% cheaper, increasing foreign attractivity.

You know what will stop foreigners in their tracks, loosing 10% of the value in all their foreign assets.

&gt;Overall, depreciation will increase the activity and create jobs. That's exactly what we need.

No, it just kicks the bucket down the road, it makes credit harder to get and it focuses your efforts on the wrong issues, you need to become taiwan not Greece. Even greece is tired of being greece.

&gt;UK had a 25% depreciation.

when? what are you talking about?

&gt;I'd need a source and example for this.

would a quota suffice? http://www.atradiusdutchstatebusiness.nl/dsben/products/exchance-risk-insurance/index.html

&gt;Lol. We're the 6th exportator in the world

That doesn't matter if the customer wants a iphone, the cheese part was sarcastic, you preduce high end telecomunication and machinery and pharmaceuticals mostly, but those are still not iphones. People buy what they buy because they want those specific products, they won't buy french and they will not buy up the excees production that exporters didn't manage to sell.

&gt;Which means a 10% depreciation would increase activity a lot.

what can I say, try it out, we would only benefit from a drop in french wine exports.

&gt;was to lower the wages and reduce social standards. I'd rather have a depreciation than this kind of internal deflation.

You really don't get it do you. Your 2000 euros won't be worth 2000 euros after the depreciation, and the added systemic shock would only upset the economy more than negesary. If you would ONLY reduce wages by 10 % the rest of the system would be fine. Now the idea is retarded as lower wages don't negesaraly mean more jobs, but it's still more reasonable than a depreciation.

&gt;Is Switzerland isolated ? Is South Korea isolated ?

yes, and yes...look at how specialised both of them are compared to france, both in product and in markets. Exiting the EU does not make you switzerland, being switzerland makes you switzerland, and they would be fine even in the EU.(they would probably be amasing actually do to their very high productivity). And all that systemic reform you need to become a specialised country like switzerland can be done, easaly and more cheaply in terms of economic growth and social costs within the EU.(but that would require politicians to actually structure a long term strategy instead of just pointing to the shit in the middle of the room)

&gt;It does increase price competitivity.

So does adding VAT on top of your cost make your prices more competitive?

&gt;Stationary pyramid
A population pyramid typical of countries with low fertility and low mortality, very similar to a constrictive pyramid.

My remark was a joke, it means your population is not increasing you don't need more jobs you just need to make young people enter more productive sectors and not work in the same jobs their parents work in.

&gt;So does everyone.

I would argue the swiss(and soon portugal and estonia) don't. Once you have a higly profitable service industry you can stop and just wait until the next economic paradigm shift to occur.

&gt;We are not growing.

YES YOU ARE, stop being a idiot: http://www.tradingeconomics.com/france/productivity Structurally GDP means shit. 

&gt;Could you please elaborate on this one ? I don't really get what you mean.

Goverments do 2 things: protect citizens and politics(getting realected). When it comes to protecting citizens there is no debate, there is no national flavor. It can be done by the UN or it can be done at your local municipality. The difference is done by the amount of bureaucracy that happers the process rather than the language of your administrator. When talking politics we are debating abstract ideas, we have egos and ideological positions, fundamentally it's all bullshit and can be erased and nobody would loose anything. It's a pop news for intelectuals. Fundamentally we all want to have a system that offers a sustainable economic enviroment for people. We just come at it from different angles. This one can not be done without having a certain predisposition before hand, you need to be french to like french soft socialism or you need or you need to live in a disfuntional country that is basically a anarcho-capitalist system at the microeconomic level to be able to trust the market in fair and impartial distribution of revenue.

Outsiders= non europeans, this is the trend: muslims, russians and americans are bad because they don't share our liberal traditions. (watch it form slowly within 20 or so years, radical liberalism will be our plague in the next 40 years)

&gt;Just look at the mess with Ukraine. Just look at the mess with the war in Irak.

Really. I see only one side with a different degree of reluctance. That exists even in the US.

&gt;Still if you don't respect the freedom of movement there are sanctions.

I am not arguing that, I am arguing, that non residents that are repeat offenders get more severe punishiment and can be banned from entering the country for a certain period of time. Our criminals prefer to do it there because your police is weak and the rewards and bigger than ours. They don't dare pull that shit in hungary or austria, because they know that breaking the law hurts.

&gt;(for example agriculture between Germany and France), we compete on fiscality (Ireland), we compete on geopolitical issues (Ukraine).

Pick one(other than tourism), and be great at it. That is the whole point of a specialised economy. Specialisation creates the economy of scale negesary to be globally competitive and the needs of your citizens are taken care of imports(since you will have them anyway due to individual choice and the free market)

&gt;What taxes and fixed by who ?

in the case the national tax systems would be replaced by a german tax system(if I had to choose I would go german or dutch).

&gt;In Germany, 1 euro jobs

can you get away with that, god that would be amasing. 24 cents in tax and you get the rest under the table.

&gt;Of course there is. Look at Spain. Wages are decreasing.

because that is the retard's solution, like cutting spending. It's stupid governing and reactionary policies, it is pointless.

false,SomebodyReasonable,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; Northern Europe, which has no tradition of routine circumcision, has been struggling with the challenges of its Jewish and Muslim minorities. Finland is considering legislation to legalise male circumcision.^[99] Sweden in 2001 passed a law requiring traditional circumcisers to be certified and for the infants to be given a medically administered anaesthetic. The World Jewish Congress said that ""[t]his is the first legal restriction placed on a Jewish rite in Europe since the Nazi era.""^[100]

&gt; On June 26, 2012, a court in Cologne, Germany ruled that circumcision was ""inflicting bodily harm on boys too young to consent"", deciding that the practice contravenes the ""interests of the child to decide later in life on his religious beliefs"".^[101] The decision based on the article ""Criminal Relevance of Circumcising Boys. A Contribution to the Limitation of Consent in Cases of Care for the Person of the Child""^[102] published by Holm Putzke, a German law professor at the University of Passau.^[103][104][105] The decision of the court in the city of Cologne, that a child's right to physical integrity trumps religious and parental rights, applied only within the jurisdiction of that court. The ruling was condemned by Jewish and Muslim groups in Europe.^[106] A broad majority of German lawmakers passed a resolution asking Angela Merkel's government to clarify the ruling so as to allow Jews and Muslims to continue to practice their religion. On 12 December 2012, following a series of hearings and consultations, the Bundestag adopted a law explicitly permitting non-therapeutic circumcision to be performed under certain conditions by a vote of 434-100, with 46 abstentions.^[107]

Why saying it was a Su-25 whose service ceiling is 7,000 m and its maximum speed is 975 km/h, which makes it quite unbelievable that it was able to intercept and shoot down an airliner.

&gt; Everyday solutions, as most italian solutions, are short sighted and do not aim at eradicating the problem, aiming just at putting a patch right here and now, and who cares about the future. The most cost-effective policy is a long term one.

I TOTALLY agree with you, here. But, if you are starving, you cannot plant a tree. You have to eat the apple. That, of course, is a problem.

&gt; You don't even care about other solutions, they are automatically ineffective to you!

...or they have already been tried without result.

Let me pose a question. A guy enters your house, shit on your carpet, hit your wife, and sits on your sofa. When you demand that he behaves, he just flips you. Out of the window, people living in other houses are just waiting for you to kick him out of your house to scream you ""Racist!"" Instead you build a dependance and give him his own sofa (actually better than the one that you can afford giving to your son). He still sleeps on your sofa, because he sold his one.

What are you going to do?

Io sono nato li' e ci ho trascorso 18 anni della mia vita.  Ora ci torno qualche volta, perche' una parte della mia famiglia vive ancora li'. Per il resto del tempo mi divido tra Miami, Finlandia, Milano e Bologna, dunque, credo di aver constatato molte contraddizioni del mondo di oggi.

Ogni volta che torno a KR rimango sconcertato principalmente da due cose.

1) **L' indifferenza generalizzata dei cittadini verso i principali problemi della societa' Crotonese**: Disoccupazione, degrado ambientale, analfabetizzazione (si, nel 2014, a KR, esiste anche quella, ) delinquenza giovanile sono solo alcuni temi normalmente ignorati dai cittadini, che li percepiscono come parte della vita di tutti i giorni. Tutti accettano cose assurde come l' emergenza rifiuti, le strade sporche, la creolina gettata da giovani teppisti nelle scuole, i pazzi che camminano nelle strade, i cani randagi, i parcheggi in 2nda ( o 3a o 4a) fila, e cosi' via. 

Tra i giovani,  Il malumore 'e amplificato dal confronto con le altre citta' che si puo' anche solo percepire da notizie o storie colte da social networks. Risultato: tutti si lamentano delle scarse opportunita' che la citta' offre, di quanto la societa' viva senza stimoli, senza ambizione a migliorarsi. Inutile dire che alla prima opportunita' scappiamo tutti. Con la differenza che fino a 20 anni fa, scappava solo chi voleva studiare, mentre ora scappano anche i muratori o i baristi. Risultato: la popolazione conta 30K persone in inverno e quasi 70-75K in estate. Peccato che le risorse pubbliche, finanziamenti statali, investimenti nei trasporti non tengano mai conto di questo.

2) **Una profondissima crisi di valori sociali ed etici**:  L' ignoranza, la presunzione (quasi genetica), e la poca lungimiranza sono sintomo di una societa' malata. In questa societa' hanno trovato terreno fertile il mercato della prostituzione e del traffico di droga (gestita quasi interamente da ROM, in un villaggio abusivo, che si trova praticamente in pieno centro). Se penso alla politica recente, mi viene la pelle d' oca. L' ultimo sindaco (Peppino Vallone, ndr) 'e stato rieletto senza che nessuno battesse ciglio. Peccato che con chiunque io ne parli, non si risale a nessun intervento notabile del signor sindaco. Peraltro, in momenti chiave 'e sempre stato introvabile. Notizia di poche settimane 'e la sua elezione a presidente della provincia. Si salvi chi puo'. 

Credo che il disagio economico abbia ulteriormente amplificato dei problemi di base della societa' meridionale. Ma di certo, vi posso assicurare che la mancanza di disciplina, di educazione, di rispetto per il prossimo o per i beni pubblici sia una preoccupante realta'. 

(questa e' la mia percezione, e spero che qualcuno la confuti presto)

false,[deleted],null,null,"It's vital that people receive an overview and definition of what the fine tuned ""free trade"" PR tenor is supposed to mean. Trade itself is *not* something to be concerned about, hence the use (and repeat) of this phrase as opposed to the lack of details regarding other, much less euphemistic, ingredients.

Needless to say that the leaks regarding the TTIP draft helped enormously to raise awareness and also allowed non governmental players and interested citizens to catch a glimpse on what representatives of the European people are already negotiating, in their names.

**Benefits** from increased trade volume are expected to take place and I couldn't find a study leaving those out. Still, none of those studies included the effect the dreaded ""investor protection"" might introduce, so while trade volume indeed might go up, it comes at a cost: Ranging from simple monetary hurdles to the indirect prevention of e.g. elevated environmental protection measures or stressed consumer rights. Countries won't introduce them when they have to fear that they are getting sued. [Business first! 
](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/vattenfall-vs-germany-nuclear-phase-out-faces-billion-euro-lawsuit-a-795466.html)

Now, when looking at former large scope trade agreements, those very (trade) benefits arriving are not necessarily able or even intended to improve the life of the average person, which, as you might tell, differs from the mentioned PR tenor.

Taking the example of [NAFTA](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/north-american-free-trade-agreement.asp), you would for example look for increased job numbers, a fairer payment, more perspectives for [labour market](http://www.cfr.org/trade/naftas-economic-impact/p15790) participants. But it didn't turn out that way and, if it did, not at all in the range of the ""assumed"" (and initial) scales which got promoted.

So one key question might be: Who actually benefits from the increased volume and who, by design, does not? This is to address the naive hopes on ""economical growth"" as well as those for more jobs.

The **sovereignty of European people**, as the placative term it is, only is threatened if companies are allowed to not just improve their trade relations (which, by itself, is not something to object) but also their leverage on nations not playing by their terms. Which could already start when a country tries to inform/protect its citizens, as [Australia had to learn](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/philip-morris-international-threatens-to-sue-government-if-plain-packaging-introduced-9664968.html).

We should not forget that, in a democratic system, the government represents the people and makes sure that all of them are represented and protected equally. To establish supra-national courts acting above those democratic levels can *in no way* be in the interest of the population.

But what about the investors? Well, they experience the same thing every market participant has to face: The coll. term is risk. Same for all.

As a positive side note, it seems to me that the [representatives of certain countries](http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/march/germany-plans-to-block-isds-clause-in-transatlantic-trade-deal/) already got that message and are well able to pursue the reasonable goal of enhancing trade relationships without introducing ""investor protection"" elements, leading to the cases like the one with [Vattenfall vs. Germany](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/vattenfall-vs-germany-nuclear-phase-out-faces-billion-euro-lawsuit-a-795466.html).

**Do we have to worry just reading what have been already leaked?**

I'd say no since the fact that it was leaked and, now, is available, already lead to the benefit of being able to discuss certain items well before they get close to being ratified. 

This also exposes the PR tenors as the things they are, a tool for influencing public opinion. If you only get taught on what you are allowed to know (filtered approach), you will not be able to judge the impact let alone the potential of the while agreement. Therefore, and especially with the IT infrastructure allowing for fully informed citizens (since information can easily be spread to anyone showing interest), any attempt to sticking to to mentioned pre-filtering can either be called outdated or... foul play.

To be fair, the mechanics of the PR are the same for all participants, consumer/environmental/whatever protection and big business alike. It's just that the latter work 24/7 and with a decent payment while being well connected and sometimes even ""ex"" governmental.

When *z* is initial however, method number one is dominant. Also people from different parts of Italy may not always agree on how they pronounce their *z* in certain words.

But remember that when the dz, and ts sounds occur in the middle of a word their ALWAYS doubled, that is ddz and tts. here's a useful link to check how words are pronounced with both audio and written material http://www.wordreference.com/iten/grazie

So fact is, Islam and Judaism have *everything* to do with this subject.

However, if I move to your next argument, that won't necessarily hold either:

http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/01/anti-semitism-and-germanys-movement-against-circumcision/266794/

And:

&gt; Beyond fighting to protect Jewish rituals, there is a second dimension, which raises questions of a different nature. Were all PACE supporters of the anti-circumcision motion motivated solely by child welfare? Was what transpired merely a collision between two universal democratic values – the other being freedom of religion? One should not be naïve: there is a major, ongoing battle against religion as Europe moves toward secularization.

&gt; There is also a strong desire in some political circles to make life uncomfortable for Muslims.

&gt; Problems for Jews affected by these anti-Muslim actions are often considered collateral damage. Yet this means that anti-Semitism plays a role in the attacks on circumcision.

http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Whats-hiding-behind-attacks-on-circumcision-329454

&gt; The second factor in the radicalization of Muslim youth is the increase of discriminatory policies vis-à-vis Islamic practices in Europe, including the use of the hijab and regulation of mosque minarets, circumcision and halal food. All contribute to a growing sense among Muslims that they are not accepted as full members of European society. 

http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/08/28/how-to-stop-radicalization-in-the-west/europe-needs-to-embrace-islam

The anti-Islamist trend in Europe has something to do with this as well.

And I'm not even pro-Islamist.

If you follow the news, and understand shifting political sentiments, this isn't some great mystery, just denial on your part.

In the end, of course, the health concerns with male circumcision are minimal to non-existent.

""De gustibus et coloribus non est disputandum"". Personnellement je les trouve trop artificieux. Quant à l'""intérêt historique"", ces tableaux sont de la propagande et pas des plus subtiles...

Je considère que l'histoire de l'art a deux tournants: [celui-ci](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_M%C3%A9nines) et [celui-là](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontaine_%28Duchamp%29).

Quelle est l'importance des ""Ménines""? Eh bien, jusque là, la différence entre ""artiste"" et ""artisan"" était très tenue. Ce qui n'était pas un problème pour les peintres flamands, hollandais ou allemands, qui étaient respectés en tant qu'artisans, mais devenait bien un dans la société très stratifiée de l'Espagne des Habsbourg. Quelqu'un qui travaillait avec ses mains n'y pouvait pas prétendre à un statut social très élevé. En particulier, il ne pouvait pas espérer atteindre le statut de noble, qui avait des avantages (notamment fiscaux) très importants. Ceci agaçait tout particulièrement Velazquez, qui en tant que peintre de la cour devait côtoyer tous les jours de Grands d'Espagne qui le traitaient en domestique (domestique au sang juif convers, par ailleurs). Il a donc lancée une campagne de ""lobbying"" assez insistante pour qu'on reconnaisse la peinture en particulier comme une œuvre non seulement des mains, mais aussi de l'esprit, comparable à la musique et à la poésie, qui étaient bien ouvertes à la noblesse. Et il a réussi...il a été fait chevalier (il porte la croix de l'ordre de Saint-Jacques) et ose se mettre en scène sur son chef-d’œuvre avec les princesses, le roi et la reine...

Mais l'idée de l'art comme œuvre de l'esprit a continué à rouler, et là on arrive à Duchamp et ses ""ready-mades"", tels que la ""Fontaine"". Des œuvres d'art sans absolument aucun ""artisanat"", sans aucun effort et aucune technique, des pures ""œuvres de l'esprit"". On peut ne pas aimer (j'abomine, personnellement), mais Duchamp était un vrai génie.

I threw anti-semitism in there along with it.

I disagree with the idea that this is mostly about circumcision being a proxy for anti-islamic or anti-semitic prejudice. In that light, my clarification was meaningful and not a side-step.

I won't deny that there remain anti-semitic prejudices or that anti-islamic prejudice is on the rise in Europe, but to claim that they are the main source of the outrage against circumcision is a claim that I do not accept. 

Your op-eds do nothing to substantiate the claim, they merely repeat it in slightly different terms.

But I have for a while now noticed, that there is a place in our modern culture, which glorifies psychopaths and murderers. 

I'll bring a few examples to illustrate my point:

1) Take for example Heath Ledger's character The Joker. He was an obvious psychopath, yet the Internet loves him - memes, trivia, gifs, whatever.

2) Ever seen ""the red wedding"" episode of Game of Thrones? It's the most talked about episode and a lot of people praise it for it's shock value, even though a lot of good characters were brutally murdered there, including a pregnant woman being stabbed to death.

3) Let's take a video game - have you ever played Far Cry 3? Did you notice how the most popular character was Vaas, who was a psychopath, who murdered innocent civillians?

I could bring you a lot more examples, because I've been noticing this for some time now. To me it seems hypocritical how the Internet and society always readily condemns school shooters (they should be condemned), but doesn't notice it's own approval of fictional murderers.

- Avevo 10 anni, la mia squadra stava perdendo 2-1 nella semifinale di un torneo, mancavano circa 2 minuti più recupero alla fine dei supplementari, il terzino mi passa la palla (io giocavo come ala sinistra), dribblo due avversari, crosso e cado a terra stremato, la palla mi torna nei piedi e con le ultime forze la scalcio in mezzo all'area, non so come un mio amico segna. Io non riuscii nemmeno ad esultare dalla stanchezza. Ai rigori segnai il 5 e andammo in finale. Non ebbi nemmeno il tempo di girarmi che tutti i miei compagni mi saltarono addosso. Mi ricordo che mi misi a piangere dall'adrenalina che avevo addosso.

- Alle elementari ogni anno facevamo una gara che consisteva in una corsa a ostacoli, venivamo divisi in 3 squadre in modo casuale. Le regole della gara erano che ad ogni manche partivano 3 bambini (uno per squadra) e facevano il percorso, quello che impiegava il minor tempo si salvava, gli altri venivano eliminati. In poco tempo io rimasi l'unico componente della mia squadra quando gli altri team avevano ancora almeno 10 persone a testa. Una manche dopo l'altra iniziai ad eliminare gli altri bambini e all'ultima mi lanciai oltre il traguardo, vincendo. Non avevo più fiato ma tutti i bambini della mia squadra esultarono come per un gol al 90esimo (tutti sopra di me). Per poco non ci rimasi secco lol. 

- Ero a Ondaland con mio cugino e insieme andammo su uno scivolo aperto sul quale potevi andare solo se pesavi ed eri alto almeno un tot. Io ovviamente da testa di cazzo qual ero me ne fregai e lo feci comunque. A metà lo scivolo aveva una gobba (non so come altro chiamarla) che ti faceva fare un saltino. Io, che non avevo i prerequisiti per andarci, saltai almeno un metro sopra il bordo. Vidi il vuoto sotto di me e il tempo rallentò un sacco. Fortunatamente caddi ancora sopra lo scivolo e non fuori. Arrivato in fondo restai circa 2 minuti nella piscina senza fare o dire nulla, poi pensai che mi era andata bene ed era stata una cosa anche abbastanza figa.

One can speculate that Basque was spoken in its land in prehistory, in the Cro-Magnon era. Basque people could have inhabited Basque Country since thousands of years.

As a Basque speaker, I can understand written Basque of the 15th century.

Basque Country is not an island in the middle of the Atlantic. Basque Country is in western Europe.
Neighbouring countries all speak latin languages. A large majority of basque speakers (I would say more than 90 % of basque speakers; *Euskaldunen % 90 baino gehiago nioke*) is, at least, bilingual Euskara/spanish or Euskara/french.

Especially when we are talking about internationalized/globalized systems of government, national interests should take the backseat and the patriotic delusions of indoctrinated populaces even more so.

You seem to imply that democracy would solve Hungarian problems. That is not the case. Democracy is what is *causing* massive amounts of problems.

Enjoying morbid characters and stories doesn't negatively influence normal people. Most people realize that the things depicted in those shows are fantasy and are wrong in real life. In fact it gives them an even better understanding of what is acceptable and what isn't. Experiments have shown that violent children are much friendlier and more sociable if they play violent video games to lose their frustration. The amount of rape cases also dropped significantly when porn started to be more available.

Vorgeschichte, Katalysatoren, was eigentlich passiert ist, hätte man das verhindern können oder nicht, wie hat die Bevölkerung den Krieg wahrgenommen, etc. pp. Wir hatten Zeugen aus der damaligen Zeit, die uns im Geschichtsunterricht Erlebnisse ihrer Zeit erzählten und vieles mehr. Ich bin allerdings in einer eher rechten Ecke aufgewachsen(oben in Meck-Pomm), daher mag es sein, dass der Fokus dort etwas stärker auf dem Thema lag, oder möglicherweise war unserer Lehrerin das auch einfach sehr wichtig(sie kam mir immer sehr couragiert vor was das anging).

&gt; Einsatz von gefährlichen Verteidigungsmitteln ist eventuell je nach Intensität des Angriffs ein abgestuftes Verteidigungsverhalten zu fordern. So ist z.B. beim Schusswaffeneinsatz, sofern die Situation es zulässt, wie folgt vorzugehen: 1. Androhen des Schusswaffeneinsatzes
2. Warnschuss
3. Schuss in weniger gefährliche Bereiche
4. Finaler Schuss nur als ultima ratio

Yes, technocracy is a form of meritocracy and I agree that it is also a better system than democracy. Examples of at least semi-technocratic approaches would be Singapore in recent years or the fourth generation of Chinese leadership (i.e. the one that ruled from 2003 to 2012). They were highly successful and led even highly corrupt and ideologically divided nations to success. However, technocracy specifically refers to a government of... technocrats (i.e. technical decision making and running your country like a machine).

Then you should have picked your words more carefully, lest you load the suspicion of moving the goalposts on yourself.

&gt; I threw anti-semitism in there along with it.

Which is called a ""straw man argument"".

&gt; I disagree with the idea that this is mostly about circumcision being a proxy for anti-islamic or anti-semitic prejudice. In that light, my clarification was meaningful and not a side-step.

Straw man arguments, denial, racist profanity and a distinct lack of will to actually cite sources to validate *your* opinion don't really qualify as meaningful.

&gt; Your op-eds do nothing to substantiate the claim, they merely repeat it in slightly different terms.

You are in denial:

&gt; **Jocelyne Cesari is senior research fellow at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs at Georgetown University, and director of the Islam in the West Program at Harvard University.**

Her expertise qualifies as evidence, because citing her is argument from actual authority, rather than misleading authority. You overlooked that and continued to assert your unqualified *opinion* without evidence.

&gt; The argument that the health concerns are minimal is an argument that would suggest that we also legalise some forms of female circumcision

I already covered this ITT. There is no comparison, and I explained that explicitly multiple times. Sexual pleasure is a health issue as well, by the way.

&gt; There are very few arguments in favour of permitting male circumcision that do not also work for some forms of female circumcision.

Patriarchy is defined as a society or government in which men hold the power, where women are largely excluded, and where power is normatively used for male gain. 

--

Now such is true in places like Saudi Arabia; where women up until recently weren't even allowed to drive. But that is not true in the west. There is a difference between a man/woman holding power, and a man/woman using said power for the sole benefit of men/women. A small distinction, but an important one.

--

As to your last point. There has been a good deal of research into that area, although more is needed. There are a few things researchers have identified: Higher testosterone levels increase impulsivity and risk taking^1; difference in gray/white matter composition^3; relative genomic instability in comparative terms in relation between males and females^2.

&gt;INDUSTRIAL peace at Curtis Island near Gladstone has been won with huge pay rises for the workforce.

&gt;Tradesmen’s wages have jumped about $40,000 to about $200,000 a year.

&gt;Workers have also won a promise that construction company Bechtel will eventually give the fly-in, fly-out workers their own room at the camp and bring an end to the hated practice of “motelling’’ in which workers get a different room every time they return to the island.

&gt;The vote by the 8000-person workforce is expected to bring an end to the strike action initiated by about 150 CFMEU members that meant at one point 2000 workers were either not working or unproductive.

&gt;The vote on Bechtel’s third offer was finalised yesterday and endorsed by just 54 per cent of those who voted.

&gt;It came as the Australian Bureau of Statistics released average weekly adult full-time wages had risen 2.5 per cent in the past year to $75,600.

&gt;The acceptance of the deal may mean significant pay increases but will also mean the CFMEU’s push to reduce the fly-in, fly-out roster from four weeks to three has been defeated.

I think this may be due to the nature of the dictee which features quite lot of special &amp; uncommon words? Something which the Flemish might be able to excel in due to all the dialects featuring old Dutch and the loanwords in the language.

&gt;Your literary works are better too, your education system, your music, and so on.

Both sides of the low countries provided great stuff when it comes to writing and music. There's a slight discrepancy in terms of focus i think so which side you like most will probably depend on personal taste. As far as I know Belgium produces more thrillers, the Dutch are the kings of quite a few electronic music variants, etc.

As far as the education system goes I don't know. The higher tuition fees up north don't make it worse in essence and as far as I know the Belgian/Flemish system is simply more specialised &amp; varied which has both its down and upsides. In the end you guys still come a bit on top in the HDI education index I believe.

It is. The US typically does not get involved in internal conflicts where it is based. Philippine interest in the US being there is strictly because of China's aggressive behavior. The US can help with external issues, but they have to work on internal ones.

This theory got more then just a few flaws. You dont take the social norms into consideration, especially considering marriage. 
Back in these days you didnt marry for the looks. Not just in the noble circles ( they used to prefer inbreeding with cousins anyways. The beautiful princess is a lie, or better, a rare exception. Most of the nobles were horribly ugly and ridden by genetic disease) but also among the commoners. You really think even a mediocre trader would allow his son to marry a beautiful fishmongers daughter instead of that of the other wool trader? Sure, a beautiful maid was almost bound to attract the attention of the noble ( whether she wanted it or not ) who might have knocked her up, and might have, to certain extent (maybe enabled a career in the church or administration, maybe a combat education, but even making them a knight was unlikely, since that was highly expensive and far too much of a financial strain for lower nobility), cared for the child, but for the mother? Thats like claiming that every beautiful girl nowadays will become a model, actress or marry a wealthy man.

The publishers of course don't want that, so they remove anything that might cause that classification.

If you would actually educate yourself before talking about the topics, you would quickly understand that your definitions are too vague and that your preceonceived definitions related to the topic are nothing but your very own. The term scientocracy is as of yet not a clearly defined term. I obviously use it to refer to an independent system of government that is distinct from a technocracy. It should also be obvious that when I use the term technocracy I am referring to technocracy from a historical perspective, referring to [failed movements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy_movement) of the past that are very different from anything I propose (i.e. technocracy = *technological* elitism). 

Technocracies of the past and approaches that I support should be treated as clearly distinct forms of government. They should not be confused, the same way you shouldn't confuse Democracy in Switzerland with ""Democracy"" in North Korea.

You are trying to use technocracy as an umbrella term for all meritocratic systems. With scientocracy am specifically refering to a system that is ruled by scientists in general (i.e. people with academic merit who at the very least were objectively trained in the topics they have to deal with on their job; NOT technological elites that want to run society as a machine with the government holding total market control at all costs).  

So, when using the term scientocracy, I am not refering to a technocracy but a distinct form of government utilizing scientists. That can be described with the umbrella term meritocracy and you would understand my position if you were actually aware of the etymological meaning of the word scientocracy alone. The role ""technocrats"" play in a technocracy, ""scientocrats"" play in a scientocracy.

Refer to Wikipedia for further information. That alone should suffice to discredit you and your attempts of contradiction here. You know, you could really just read at the very least Wikipedia articles before commenting and it should be quite clear why I disagree with you:       
&gt;In 1933, Hugo Gernsback defined scientocracy as ""the direction of the country and its resources by Scientists and not by Technicians""

You know why he made that distinction? Because a society ruled by technicians is a technocracy. And he disagreed with it.

You *are* arguing semantics and if you aren't aware of that and instead believe you are actually contradicting my position in a valid manner, that's pretty sad.
