The welfare state has nothing to do with European integration. The welfare system depends entirely on a country's ability to generate revenue. And that depends on the competitiveness of your industry. I'm not familiar with Danish industry, but I fear that many Nordic companies are in the danger zone: Saab, Nokia, Volvo, etc.

It may get harder to maintain your little island of prosperity for purely economic reasons because global competition is getting harsher and because it is the big boys who decide the rules.

70% of Danish exports go to the EU, mostly to Germany. If you think that integration with your primary export market is a disadvantage, then I don't understand the world anymore.

We don't know what the future will bring. The only thing that is certain is that there will be a lot of surprises. Since a couple of weeks, the emerging economies, once the darlings of investors, have come under enormous pressure, starting with the free fall of the Argentine peso, it spread like wildfire, affecting most emerging economies, sending Turkey into turmoil and the Russian Rubel to an all-time low. Only the Euro (and the countries pegged to the Euro) is unaffected.

But Europe doesn't exist in a vacuum, neither does Ukraine and neither does Russia. When the only official statements from Russia have been either direct threats of violence or telling Yanukovych to man up, the world has to stop thinking in the a) invade Ukraine or b) don't invade Ukraine dilemma and start considering the a) invade Ukraine now or b) wait until Russia does it scenario. 

I don't think most people are willing to ponder what a serious hostile Russian military presence in Ukraine would mean for the world. Russian weapons moved a full meridian to the west, increased presence in the Black Sea, Moldova becomes an easy target, etc. Like I said, once that happens, I think war is inevitable.

Dont WORRY - Germany gives free money for everyone so here is the deal:


Go to germany - find a small apartment for 250-350 eur per month. Or get a room and life with roommates.


You are BY LAW eligible to get help from the german government. Because you dont have a job and you need health insurance and all that stuff.

The thing is: The government WILL pay your rent + health insurance + ~ 380 EUR per month for buying food etc.
I bet they are also going to pay you some german classes. (because they want you to learn german really quick in order to get a job)


The words you are looking for is probably ""ALG II"" or ""Grunsicherung""



Problem is: If you have more then 10 grand on your american bank account then you are required BY LAW to spent your money first before you can get those german benefits in germany. (You would commit a crime if you lie and say that you dont have anything, even if the money is in the usa)

true,yet-another-user,UKRA,Ukraine,"&gt; I'm not sure what will happen tomorrow, let alone a month.

A bit of update: when opposition told people about the fact that, by today's agreement, Yanukovych will be a president till December, people catcalled them and asked what the fuck. After it, guys from Right Sector came to the stage and told that it is a shame, and that they will not stop until Yanukovych resigns, and they put the ultimatum to Yanukovych that if he does not resign till 10am tomorrow, they will attack. Opposition leaders could not calm down the people and left Maidan. People called them back, but they didn't return. After a while, Klychko returned, almost crying, and asked Maidan for forgiveness for shaking Yanukovych's hand and told that he did it in order to save them from being murdered by Yanukovych. I don't think he was really convincing. He left, other opposition leaders didn't appear on Maidan again... They left Maidan in a very dangerous state: Right Sector is going to attack tomorrow and people are willing to support them. If Yanukovych's life will be directly put in danger, we can only imagine how much violence he will apply, it may be a suicide for Right Sector.

The opposition didn't even mention that the Parliament will vote the legislation about impeachment tomorrow... Oleg Lyashko (leader of Radical Party of Ukraine, he is probably the most radical of current Ukrainian politicians) tried to fix this gap and called people to peaceful demonstration in front of the Parliament tomorrow instead.

So now all my prognosis are nulled. There are three possibilities: people will attack, and tomorrow will be a peak of bloodshed, or people will not attack, impeachment will be accepted and it will be a solution, or people will not attack and impeachment will not be accepted and the dangerous situation will not be defused.

You've just seen an example of my inability to accurately predict the situation even for a few hours.

&gt; Do you think new elections can bring balance, or do you think Ukraine needs new institutions?

In short, power system needs huge changes and only then elections.

This is significant because both Volvo and Scania had, in their core markets, a market share of around 15% on average in the EEA (no problem here) but *nearly 50% each* in Sweden and 30+% in Finland, Denmark, and Norway. They also found that these strong market positions were relatively stable, and that any change for either of the two companies only really affected the market share of the other, i.e. if they merged, the resulting company would not have any competition. There were some other points as well, but the problem was not that they would form a monopoly in the EU, it was that the merger would break the market in specific states, first among them Sweden. [Source](http://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/cases/decisions/m1672_en.pdf) 

In the VW/Scania case, they found that these two companies were not active in the same markets. VW makes passenger cars, Scania makes heavy trucks. This meant the merger did not affect the structure of the market, no monopoly was formed, and the resulting company would still have competition.

I just feel that attempting simplicity distracts from real issues, and since we live in a democracy this means that political will concentrates on these distractions. Especially since by transcribing events into metaphor/allegory, you're not leaving it to the reader to reach a moral judgement but are already underlining expected moral judgement for him to make and ""staking the deck"", even unwillingly.

One of these elements for example is the talk of Putin as a decisive figure and his ""plan"", both glorifying the extent of his power and flanderizing his motivations, while completely ignoring the political and cultural machine he has to appease.

Another would be the creation of monolithic figures out of EU nations during the euro-crisis, demonizing, pitying and glorifying various events without due analysis of the motivations behind the reached consensus.

And one of the vilest ones, in my opinion: The binding of the Arab Spring 
with praise of corporate social media platform.

I do wish to believe that good journalism can exist, and issues can be accurately represented to the public in a narrative manner, for ease of understanding. But current experience says that what the journalistic attempt at translation and narration (as opposed to dry education and accurate reporting) does is lead to a false sense of understanding under-pinned by subtle easily-deniable manipulation of attention, not truly for the sake of malice but entertainment/view affirmation.

In short, when discussing events in a simplified manner, what we intentionally/unintentionally leave out creates a bias, but can be forgiven on the grounds of necessity. Taking artistic license unnecessarily creates further errors and ""loaded"" meaning.

true,irwigo,ZBTQuebec,Québec,"Depuis la crèche, ou la garderie, le Français est nourri aux airs de Marseillaise - en voici quelques notes : Baguette, Balzac, Droits de l'homme, Fromages, Rimbaud, Côte d'Azur, Résistance, Vin, les Lumières, Astérix, les châteaux, le saucisson.

Quelques fiertés pêle-mêle et touchantes, si elles n'étaient pas accompagnées de cette malheureuse touche de ""ça ne se discute pas"". Le jeune français s'en fout, au départ. Mais en vieillissant, cherchant à se situer par rapport à toutes ces cultures importées à coups de clics, le Français perpétue face à l'étranger les refrains que lui chantaient les plus vieux Français. Baguette, Balzac, Droits de l'homme, Fromages, Rimbaud, Côte d'Azur, Résistance, Vin, les Lumières, Astérix, les châteaux, le saucisson, parmi tant d'autres.

Il se rassure alors, plus que quelconque autre culture (sinon les britanniques peut-être), que sa culture est la plus riche - même s'il va voir les mêmes films qu'un milliard de ses congénères. Sa gastronomie : la plus raffinée. Même si comme la plupart, il n'a pas que ça à foutre de faire un carré d'agneau aux noisettes en croûte d'épice à la crème d'ail - toutes les semaines. Même si la queue est longue, un trio est plus rapide à engloutir.

Bref, quand le Français voyage, il se compare à l'indigène, comme tout voyageur qui découvre, sauf que le Français qui voyage se compare à voix haute, très haute même, et s'il a ingurgité quelconque breuvage local mais euphorique, il teinte la comparaison d'un ricanement qu'il est le seul à considérer complice, jovial, ""sans la moindre parcelle de condescendance post-colonialiste"". Alors le local se dit que c'est un con, comme il y en a partout après tout. Mais le local, semaine après semaine, année après année, qu'il soit serveur, businessman ou simple badaud, constate que les arrivages de Français se suivent et se ressemblent, à quelques exceptions près (mais rarement au-dessus de 35 ans, les exceptions). Le Québec le vit présentement, sur ce que vous appelez le Plateau. Belle image pour accueillir une bande de fromages. Malheureusement ces fromages ont des ancêtres très rapprochés qui avaient les mêmes élans de fierté face au Sénégalais, au Burkinabé, à l'Algérien... Les pommiers ne font pas des poires.

Tant bien que mal, le Français émigré depuis longtemps excuse auprès des locaux (s'il en reste par exemple sur le Plateau) les français nouvellement arrivés, ou de passage. Il parle aux locaux un peu froissés d'une fierté un peu forcée mais indispensable pour consolider l'identité dans un contexte de globalisation, il explique la nostalgie d'un empire déchu, une culture désormais abandonnée sous la poussière, une morosité nationale qui s'oublie encore à coups de vin et de saucisson, heureusement.

Pourtant, cette culture n'est plus qu'un fantasme. La morosité a gagné le vieux pays, la fierté est superficielle parce qu'à la maison, on ne croit plus en cette terre ancestrale. On rêve d'ailleurs (encore le Québec que tu connais : 50 000 inscrits au programme Vacances-Travail à chaque appel d'offres).

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt; Thanks about the Freedom of information links. As if I needed more ammunition for my case about EU corruption.....

Sorry for the double comments, but I was more floored by the fact the litigant has to pay for the Government's court costs if they lose. I am in law school so I have read countless statutes (mostly US). I have never once seen a statute requiring a litigant suing the government to pay the government's litigation fees, but many statutes require the opposite. For instance this is from the US Freedom of Information Act:

&gt;(i) The court may assess against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under this section in which the complainant has substantially prevailed. [5 U.S.C. § 552(4)(E)(i)](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/552)

There is no clause allowing a court to assess litigation costs against a complainant in favor of the US. 

The worst that can happen pursuing a Freedom of Information Act request in the US court system is you will have to pay your own attorneys' fees (and you will know how much it will cost). Having the threat of paying a substantially higher but unknown amount would have a very preclusionary effect on requests if a complainant had to take the complaint to court. 

For instance in this case, the ECB is by far the second most powerful central bank in the world. I would be willing to bet they are using lawyers that charge substantial fees. Considering whether a complainant wins or loses is largely arbitrary, I am not sure most journalists would want to expose themselves to such a large potential liability. 

For instance, assume an independent Danish newspaper became aware of these ECB reports instead of a large conglomerate like Bloomberg. It is unlikely that small newspaper could absorb the costs of ECB litigation through several court systems ultimately ending up in the highest court in Europe. Even if they could find a justice minded attorney to take their case pro bono, if they lost for an arbitrary reason, like in this case, they would have to pay exorbitant fees they themselves didn't incur. 

This loser pays system, in the case of freedom of information requests, has a very preclusionary effect for small companies or individuals and it certainly does not promote the transparency the EU seems to pride itself on. It prices out the little guy from the court process required for FOI requests. 

People will probably flip out for me suggesting this, but the standard practice in US statutes allows litigants to recover costs if they prevail against the United States or its agencies in court. If they lose they are responsible for their own litigation costs. I have never once, in the countless statutes I have read, ever seen one that authorized the US to collect litigation costs from a losing litigant. Fighting the government is hard enough, possibly having to pay their legal costs is borderline toxic to democracy.

For example, close to where I live there is a shopping mall. If a tourist go into one of the shops where they don't speak english, the shopkeeper phones the central office of the mall, where there is a person who can translate. 

 If you want to go to a place that doesn't look like it receives tourists in a regular basis (for example, one of the typical lousy dirty bars for old people) then probably you won't be lucky. 

Spanish people do a funny thing a lot: When they want to interact with someone who doesn't speak their language, they keep speaking spanish, but louder and slower. That works with someone who understands a little, but for the rest... not really. 

Anyways, the thing with language is kind of a lottery. The Spanish education system doesn't really care about students finishing school with a decent level of english, so whoever you find speaking english, probably made the effort himself/herself outside the regular school.

And the really random thing is that sometimes not even a touristic place guarantees the language interaction. How do I know? Well, I am spanish and some time ago I used to work in the reception of a quite popular hotel. Now and then I would get people coming in and asking me questions, and then they would add ""we are clients of the hotel next door, but we came to ask you this or that because they cannot speak english over there"", which was puzzling, because the hotel was located in a very touristic area.

Only when both France and the UK had denied help, the Republic accepted the Soviet help. Which caused a war within the democratic part of the conflict!

By the way, do you know which flag waves next to the French one when the anniversary of the Liberation of Paris? The Spanish Republic flag!! Fuck the rojigualda. 

The history of the Spaniards who first entered Paris during WWII has to be one of the most badass and epic stories of humanity. Cross the Pyrenees without nothing, put in concentration camps, given the opportunity to fight with the French army and ending liberating Paris. Wow.

It would have been the acquisition of MAN that would have been ruled out, since it came later. But the investigation found that no monopoly would be created. The biggest market share of the combined VW/Scania/MAN operations in the core market (heavy trucks) would have been in countries like Sweden and Norway - where MAN did not have a large share in the first place (3.4% and 7.5% respectively) and this was no big change from VW/Scania alone (which already had 42% and 39% respectively). The opposite case existed in Austria and Germany, where MAN was strong but VW/Scania wasn't. In the end the combined market share in any country was at most 47%, which is a far cry from the 90+% Volvo/Scania would have had in Sweden.

This article cites one single source and is about human trafficking in general. Nothing here suggests any grand scale human trafficking issues like you do:

I think this number should be zero, but like everything else you should put it in perspective.

In the US, in theory a kid could drop out of school, work as a plumber, go to Junior College at night, get a 4 yr degree, and then attend law school.


That's not quite correct. In most Bundesländer, the decision lies with the parents to which type of secondary school, i.e. after grade 4-6, depending on the Bundesland, children go. Generally speaking there are three types of degree you get out of a secondary school: The Hauptschulabschluss (after 9th grade, which is the end of the Hauptschule), the Realschulabschluss (after 10th grade), and the Abitur (after 12th/13th grade, depending on the Bundesland).

He isn't an example of the current laws, but instead the problems that could still occur and aren't possible to legislate. These sort of pimps function in a grey market. I'm not against prostitution, but I'm against pimps. How would you suggest to regulate this sort of activity with a law? Would a law be able to control if a prostitute gave her money to her boyfriend? Would there be a assistance network for women trying to leave the life?

There is a film called ""Very Young Girls"" about the GEMS program in New York. It's an organization of former prostitutes that aids women trying to transition out of prostitution into normal life. I'm aware it's a film about America, but I think it shows the ways pimps function and take advantage of vulnerable women. Most of the prostitutes involved are in relationships that can only be described as battered wife syndrome. Pimps are the real problem.

Please consider the following proof of the sort of incidents I was describing, even at a high profile legal brothel like Pascha.
""After a police raid of the brothel in April 2005, it was reported that a gun and some cocaine was found and 23 prostitutes were arrested, most of them because of suspected violation of immigration laws. Further it was reported that four of the prostitutes were between 14 and 15 years old.[9] The brothel was not fined however, since the girls, who were from Africa, looked older and carried fake documents showing an older age.[10]""

It's not the argument I was trying to make and as far as I know it isn't the argument anyone in favor of legal prostitution is making. At least I never heard it.

Completely outlawing any and all forms of prostitution is simply no functional way to regulate prostitution either.

That approach has already proven to work just as well as any other form of prohibition - it simply doesn't. It doesn't notably reduce demand, it barely shrinks the market, it simply moves it into back into the dark (and/or back out of Germany across its borders).

Germany currently fails to regulate the market, it fails to enforce existing laws and it's missing the tools to enforce them - those are issues that need addressing and the current government has already expressed their desire to address them.

1. Communists ""often bought national companies""? I can't agree with that and I ask you kindly to give examples. Elected politicians sold state owned companies. Sometimes they were from left wing parties, but in majority of cases privatization was conducted by liberal/right wing parties. Who sold PZU, TP, FSM, PeKao, BPH? Whose name is the brand name for privatization after transformation? Belka, Hausner, Kołodko? Kaczmarek? I think it is Balcerowicz. If you compare value and numbers of companies sold, then  Lewandowski, Balcerowicz, Bielecki and Wąsacz sold much more. And compare results. 27,52% of Orlen sold by post-communists is still owned by the state.

If the government isn't too corrupt, or is at least sensibly corrupt, a small country can make reasonable tax haven because they don't cost very much to to govern.

&gt; I live in Poland and I think your thoughts on forgiveness could be of great use to the people of this country. It seems that we , as Poles, are happy to be the victim rather than use the lessons learned in the past to influence the future. One particular political party still hold great suspicion of the Russians and many people in general do not have a tolerance for Germans. If you could give me one piece of advice on how to speak to someone not willing to forgive, how do I help them move on?

&gt; Ask them, ""Are you happy hating this group or that group? Does it make you feel good that you can hate? Would you like to become friends with them? Are you the strong person who is willing to take the first step? Then if so, think about forgiving the past because it has no importance to the present or future unless you hold onto it. If you want to make friends in the world, become that friend."" Become the person you want others to be.

about the military. it is good and i acknowledge that you have the character to stand up for what you want to protect. That does earn you some respect.

true,lordofthejungle,IREL,Ireland,"I can't honestly disagree with any of your points except to say it will happen anyway for now because the ground is so fertile for it. It's how certain factions of the audience expect their news to be delivered to them, and of course it's been stacked that way by influential figures and technologies. The flaw in relying on the technique for those who abuse it is that their opponents can abuse it as easily.

When it is properly motivated and the message, morals and motivations of it are clear, the succinct presentation of an idea in this way can have impact and cause it to spread fast, give it attention and this is potentially beneficial for rallying the apathetic to a cause. In a case such as the OP's article it could be clearly beneficial. 

What is more, you can't stop the artistic from taking license with current events and affairs, which can be quite effective at turning attention on the truth of a situation, regardless of the success of the piece. I would not advocate it so much as a form of journalism, but since artistic people and artists are going to do it anyway, when it's done well, it's good to point out what that is and how to recognise it. 

This, I think, is the case here and no harm too, aside from the minor inaccuracies of detail, the motivations seem pure. What's more, exposure to this persuasive material, using consistent linguistic infrastructures, can encourage critical thinking through contradicting messages being delivered to the audience in a similar fashion. Enough experience of this could land people at your conclusion regardless. 

Allow me to say you explain your point of view well also. I appreciate there is a 'time and place' for rhetoric, and too often it comes from the powerful, institutional and influencial, who should be presenting their cases transparently and in detail. I don't think that is the same as in this case though, where the rhetoric is acknowledged for the resonance of its content by the audience, rather than imposed on a relatively captive audience such as mainstream news watchers. It's presented in a low-responsibility, low-influence, opt-in context and is clearly comprised of more artistic-persuasive motivations than political/journalistic-manipulative. For these reasons I'd say there is a place where you can get it right and that could be a powerful force for good.

&gt;

&gt;**Laissez-faire** (/ˌlɛseɪˈfɛər-/, French: [lɛsefɛʁ] ) is an economic environment in which transactions between private parties are free from [government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government) restrictions, [tariffs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff), and [subsidies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy), with only enough [regulations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation) to protect [property rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_rights).  The phrase laissez-faire is [French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) and literally means ""let [them] do,"" but it broadly implies ""let it be,"" ""let them do as they will,"" or ""leave it alone.""

In some wicked way Putin was correct and from EU project standpoint, fallout of USSR was a major catastrophe - if only iron curtain would fall, then Western Europe + EU10 (-Baltics obviously) would have such another good reason to stick together, then a prospect economic synergy :)

Dear Eastern Europeans please forgive my thought experiment - it was merely sci-fi attempt to boost EU survival chances.

On more serious note though... until Europe will coalesce into one supranational identity (like ONE language, teaching a history at national schools from holistically European perspective), until then... I doubt there will be workable Federal EU. But such a development will require at least one more generation, that would be raised in pan-European spirit.

We have 631 PMs, I'd be willing to bet that most of them are devoting the main part of their time (life) to this. Like I said: the schedule of a parlamentarian is insane and usually knows no weekends. 

Also a technical thing: what you mean is ""supervisory board"". Board of directors would be a  big problem -  I agree. I'm not a big supporter of the the first thing either -  so I tend to vote for Partys and politicians who are trying to restrict that. 

&gt;Furthermore their pension makes me sick. No part of their salary is beeing deducted for pension but they receive ~65% of their ""Diät"" for as long as they live. 

I agree, I wouldn't have phrased it so envious though. This is a general problem with public servants. They should pay into the general ""pension pool"" . 

Same goes for lawyers, doctors and the likes though if you ask me. I think it is scandalous that most highly payed professions give solidarity the middle finger. 


&gt;So how do we attract more talent into politics? We can't. There already are many experts in the parliament, but the relevant positions are not given to the ones with most expertise but to the ones who sucked the most dicks. 

So we can just close shop? Maybe we can find some Hohen Zollern offspring that would be willing to claim his crown again... 

I was hoping for a serious response. Not some cynical bs. Politics is more than just expertise - true. But a high position in parliament is not earned through just ""sucking dick"" either. There are other jobs in the political sphere for that :) 


&gt;So who could decide on their salary? The BFH (Bundesfinanzhof) as they already kind of do by restricting some of their auto-raises. 

Judges are not supposed to make laws. Separation of powers is a principal that's quite important to our system. 

You also ignored my last paragraph. The Diäten are practically  directly related to the pay of (for instance) said BFH.

Also, the federalization of US currency happened during or right after major wars so it adds an additional level of chaos to everything. Originally federal income tax started as such a minuscule portion of most people's taxes during WWI it was not widely protested against. 

It kind of crept in over time. Now most Americans in wealthy states understand much of their taxes go to lower income states to smooth out income discrepancies. 30% of every tax dollar I pay goes to low income states and territories. In my linked comment above I talk about how Puerto Rico's GDP is 20-25% Federal transfers. It works so they can also use the USD and helps make the US monetary policy fit with Puerto Rico's economy. I am not sure Germany or the Netherlands feels enough solidarity with Spain or Greece for it to work as smoothly in the Eurozone.

Now states do have a very significant degree of autonomy, but not with their monetary policy, which is very accepted. They may complain about federal policies, but there are not real attempts to leave the dollar. Local economies have printed their own currencies, but they're typically pegged to the dollar so the point is somewhat moot. 

If you look at my linked comment I explain more on how the fiscal policy in the US helps to counteract a monetary policy that does not fit all of the states and territories.

A single currency, in different forms, was a pretty common feature of the US from the beginning. But there were many that thought if the US left the Pound it would fail. The first currencies were supported by Spain and France, mostly to spite the British. But as things evolved, wealth has flowed from the traditionally more wealthy north to the poorer south. New southern powerhouses like Texas have emerged that have helped level this balance, but certain states remain *huge* benefactors to the Felderalized system. Oddly enough they tend to be ""small government"" red states.

true,SpanishNinjitsu,null,null,"Cute brochure, guys, but I'm afraid I might have a 'but' or two:

* Little known fact: did you guys know that the Industrial Revolution in Spain begun in Andalusia? It really did! Then the central government decided to move the textile industry from Almería to Catalonia because they were closer to Europe. Since then the central government (regardless of whether that central government was a republic, a monarchy or a dictatorship) has been giving a far better treatment to Catalonia than to other regions by virtue of being one of the two industrial hearts of Spain (the other one being the Basque Country for very much the same reasons). So yeah, Catalonia is a heavily industrialised region... but because the central government has been fostering that for more than a century and a half.

* If indeed the Spanish ruling parties had wanted to build a homogeneous country without respecting diversity... we would be France. I don't see many French Catalonians demonstrating on the streets and heavily overrepresented in the French Parlament (the very same electoral law that ensures bipartidism on a national level gives extra seats to nationalist parties, and this is fact, you guys).

* You know when you hear some right-wing Spaniard boast about how Spain was born in 1492 and you laugh because you've read books and know that actually nation-states are a pretty recent thing (200 years old?) and back in the day people mostly fought for their nobles? During the War of Sucession in 1714, a bunch of nobles of what's currently Catalonia but back then was the Crown of Aragón sided with the wrong side and lost, the Crown of Aragón got dissolved and merged with the rest of lands under the control of Phillip V and that was pretty much it. No Catalonian nation there to be oppresed by the evil Madrid, but I guess revisionism is always cute when it suits your goals.

As I said, that has nothing to do with the EU. That has something to do with the size of the economy, which remains the same with or without EU. 

It is clear that small countries, in proportion to their size, have a lot more power in the EU than big countries (which is something I agree with). In a democracy, it would have to be one person one vote, not a Portuguese 2 votes and a German 1 vote. 

I have always advocated splitting Germany into 17 countries. That would give Germans twice as many MEPs, and with 17 commissioners and 17 ECB votes, they could easily dominate. As an added bonus, it would put an end to all the Germany-dominates-the-EU-rant.

true,Roccondil,GERM,Germany,"&gt; Citizenship by descent would be available if you had a German parent. Not a great grandparent.

That's how I understood the question. There are quite a few secret Germans out there. Those are people descended from a German citizen in an unbroken chain of technical German citizens even if nobody in the family has identified as such for several generations. The problem is that in practice the chain is often broken. 

For example generally you lose your German citizenship if you get another citizenship voluntarily. It is not unlikely that one of the OP's ancestors was naturalized and lost their citizenship at that point. Things would be different if the first ancestor born in the US was born while his father still had his German citizenship.

Another way to lose your German citizenship is to volunteer for the military of a country of which you are a citizen. That is seen as an endorsement of that citizenship.

* Suo marito, di Pirandello. Lo sto leggendo ora con enorme sforzo: è almeno venti gradini sotto Il fu Mattia Pascal, Il turno o L'esclusa. E' di una noia abissale, ma l'ho quasi finito.

* Il piacere, di D'Annunzio. 
Mi è bastato leggerne 20 pagine per decidere di lasciarlo definitivamente e non toccarlo mai più. Che Dio me ne scampi e liberi.

* I versetti satanici, di Rushdie. L'unico libro di cui ho letto un terzo, circa 100 pagine, prima di regalarlo a una amica purchè me lo togliesse dai piedi. Insopportabile, incomprensibile. 

* Il Vangelo secondo Gesù Cristo, di Saramago. Finito a fatica. Per la serie: anche un nobel può scrivere fesserie. Non ho capito la scelta editoriale di usare le virgole anziché i due punti e le virgolette nel discorso diretto. C'erano momenti interi in cui non comprendevo minimamente chi fosse a parlare. La scena di Gesù e Dio in barca sul lago, col diavolo che li raggiunge a nuoto, sembra presa in prestito dai cartoni dei Griffin. Ridicolo.

* Rajuela: il gioco del mondo, di Cortazar. Un romanzo sperimentale, fatto di parti che l'autore chiama ""parti di cui si può fare a meno"" (e di cui ho beatamente fatto a meno), e di parti invece che si debbono leggere per forza. 500 pagine riassumibili in un enorme WTF. Peccato, perchè ogni 10-20 pagine è possibile trovare un rigo, una frase o un intero periodo davvero pregevole.

* Camera con vista, di Forster. Finito con enorme sforzo. Due palle quadrate.

* Passaggio in India, di Forster. Idem.

* Col corpo capisco, di Grossman. Idem.

* Attraverso il tuo corpo, di Bevilacqua. Non ricordo neanche se l'ho finito o no. Credo sia l'unico libro la cui vicenda è stato per me impossibile collocare storicamente. Non ho capito se è ambientato nel 2000, nel 1920, nel 1950, nel 1970. Bho. ",0,1393066545,null,0,false,0,cflqtgz,t3_1ym6c0,t1_cflqtgz,t3_1ym6c0,null,1432508443,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

[The European Union: A Failed Experiment](http://blogs.hbr.org/2013/06/the-european-union-a-failed-ex/)

* The EU has failed the most important test.
* The EU system is undemocratic
* It’s time to revisit the EU’s founding purposes.
* The prospects for effective EU integration are slim to none

&gt;*""My guess is that Europe will muddle on trying to “reform” the EU system around the margins. European economists and officials will likely remain steadfast in their belief that their policies have been right all along, that all they need is yet more time, and that the real fault lies with the moral defects of those living in the periphery nations — who must be compelled to do what’s good for them and for the EU as a whole.""*

&gt;*""This sounds too much like old Europe to me (and not in a good way). It would be better to start now directing our efforts and energy to winding down the whole EU project as quickly as possible; and in parallel to ramp up efforts and policies to help European economies to prosper as separate nations, learning how best to work together.""*

Ce qui est chouette avec le jazz français, c'est que c'est souvent très inattendu, et parfois c'est même carrément belge :) Les scènes française et belge étaient très proches dans les années 30-50, beaucoup de musiciens allaient et venaient entre Bruxelles et Paris. Il y a eu beaucoup de collaborations et les styles se mélangent beaucoup, ce qui est un peu moins le cas aujourd'hui.

Dans le désordre :

[Django Reinhart](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt) (un franco-belge) a déjà été mentionné. Lui, c'est un bon. Suite à un grave accident il a dû se réinventer une manière de jouer de la guitare, il jouait qu'avec deux doigts de sa main gauche, les autres étant paralysés. Quand t'écoutes ses solos, faut garder ça a l'esprit et c'est incroyable comme il arrive à jouer. C'est un jazz imprégné de style manouche, [c'est très sympa](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ7ieJ4j5U0).

[Stéphane Grapelli](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stéphane_Grappelli) a fondé avec Django le Quintette du Hot Club de France, il me semble que c'est le premier quintette formé uniquement avec des cordes. Je connais moins, mais je sais que c'est une valeur sûre (mon Papa est fan).

[Gus Viseur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Viseur), un belge, mais qui était à Paris dans les années 30, était un accordéoniste virtuose et sa musique me fait un peu penser à de la valse musette qui swinge. [Voilà le genre de trucs que je vois](http://s3.amazonaws.com/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_l97cj7esoB1qaqa99o1_1280.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAI6WLSGT7Y3ET7ADQ&amp;Expires=1393152843&amp;Signature=py8yRKGqk3nS3%2FoWTOQiNaYR7Bo%3D#_=_) quand j'écoute ça. [L'album que j'ai](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjiLzZznfIc&amp;list=PL7936A0708C951D4D) (il me semble qu'il est dans le désorde, mais c'est cool quand même) se laisse bien écouter. Ambiance Amélie Poulain/Le bal assurée. Parfait pour le weekend !

[Toots Thielemans](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toots_Thielemans) est aussi belge, il fait de la musique beaucoup plus moderne mais j'adore le côté *chill*. À la base il est guitariste mais c'est surtout un des [plus grands joueurs d'harmonica](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKnG_9q4crA). Pas vraiment de l'entre-deux guerres mais ça vaut le coup d'oreille.

Je peux pas continuer sans parler de [Boris Vian](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Vian), grand écrivain, et trompettiste. Là, ça swinge. [*On est pas là pour se faire engueuler*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-FhBkpzkzE&amp;list=PL459C6A00EA8A0D5F) est une chanson qui respire la France. Parfait pour un 14 juillet ;)

[Raymond Fol](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Fol) est un pianiste français un peu moins connu mais qui a joué avec Django, Boris Vian, et même Chet Baker et Sidney Bechet ! Il est surtout connu pour sa [reprise des Quatre Saisons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KbxKD_D1a8&amp;list=PLD1535BD32E1FE178) de Vivaldi, incroyable condensé de classique, swing, de flamenco et même de be-bop. T'as jamais entendu du classique swinguer comme ça.

Pour creuser un peu dans le jazz parisien/français/franco-belge je vivement conseille la collection [*Jazz in Paris*](http://deus62.com/jazz-in-paris/), une énorme collection de CD avec des anthologies, des ""Best of"", des concerts... en gros du jazz qui a ou a été influencé par la scène parisienne.

You can't gain any meaningful change within existing Treaties without breaking them (no matter that the EU broke the Treaties bailing-out the PIIGS and therefore demonstrating just how much they are making it up as they go along).

You can't gain agreement between 28 disparate Nations according a New Treaty that caters for all of them. See David Cameron for the UK being rebuffed:

* Pic-n-mix
* Privileged Partnership
* Playing rugby at a football club
* cherry-picking
* ""Associate Membership""

You can only reform via Article 50 TEU of the Lisbon Treaty. This was intended to be back-to-front to deter Nations taking back powers once lost to Brussels/EU. This ""all-or-nothing"" nature of inflexibile Treaty structures simple DOES NOT WORK. National Policies can bend in the wind and adapt, Treaties between disparate Nations need to be few and macro only eg Peace/Trade - not every EU Directive churning out of the EU to justify the pig-swilling salaries of the eurocrats affecting all areas of life. New Treaties are needed to patch up the fault-lines of the previous Treaties. All atst as side-lining public democratic participation (see EU Constitution Referendum results).

There's now a clear power-vacuum in Europe: The EU will do anything to save the doomed EURO-CRISIS to save itself: It's impossible the figures are diabolical as evidenced in the suffering of the GIIPS (due to get worse). The solution is more powers and a ""United States of Europe"" in the eyes of the EU (Fiscal Union, Banking negotiations). The GIIPS are broken for a generation (30-40 years).

So you think it's okay the way things are going now?

&gt;If not, and your reasoning is flawed and you do act just because you can, you just pissed off some rail workers for no good reason, and those guys lift. Or what if the console has multiple botons and no clear red button for on/off, you are free to act and waste your time pressing all of the buttons, instead of just warning the workers to get out of the way.

Those are just practical problems, feel free to solve them any way you like. They don't change the need for action.

&gt; But that is what happens when you want to feel important and can't stand the fact that your opinion or actions rarely matter in a significant way. You didn't really want to save those people, you wanted to be a rail master and control the path of trains, those people where just justification for you to push buttons.

You can put that irrelevant ad hominem back where you got it from.

That's the same justification people use not to vote ""my vote won't change anything"". Sure, and a single raindrop won't flood a country. And yet, look at the UK lately.

No, I think it means they depleted their reserves because they had to pay for purchases abroad, for example gas and oil in Russia, while not earning enough export revenue.

He could have printed all the money he wanted, that wouldn't have help paying for imports or for servicing debts. Foreign investors aren't likely to accept toilet paper instead of hard currency. Printing money would only increase inflation in the country. It could even have an adverse effect on foreign borrowing if interest rates are increased.

Anyways, if much of the money is owned to Russia (have to check) for oil etc., should the West pay for it or let Russia take the plunge?

Corporations want to get steady income from the populations with monopolies and not deal with market competition or government regulation.

Bribing an public official administrative is corruption.

Some message this sends...

I've seen what privatization does in my country. It makes things expensive, particularly the unavoidable things like energy, roads and water. The hikes in gas and electricity prices are absurd and far beyond reasonable. Same goes for school costs. And the private sector actively destroys the public sector by hiring the same professionals  lawfuly!! 

Example, doctors that refuse to operate in public hospitals and forward patients to their private practices. Teachers and school administrators that are ill managing schools and forwarding them to private schools. 

It's no use to privatize things when there is no mechanisms in place to regulate practices and the law is a piece of swiss cheese designed by and for the ones against the peoples interests.

Because ethnic intermingling is a horrible, horrible thing and those evil Castilians want to purge the genetic purity of the superior Catalonian race.

Galicians, Andalusians and other people from the poorer regions of Spain went to Catalonia for the same reason we Spaniards go to Germany today: to find a better future. The fact that I have to explain this scares me a little bit, to be honest.

&gt;So you are saying that there were no campaigns to suppress the other nationalities of Spain?

What happened in the Basque Country? Nobles in Catalonia and Valencia supported the losing side, Philip was a vengeful dude. Nothing to do with some sort of irrational hate towards anything non-Castilian.

And please remember that while Franco tried to enforce a certain uniformity in Spain, it was far from the cultural genocide some secessionists might led you to believe, and don't forget that the dictatorship not only oppressed the Catalonians, it oppressed the rest of the country.

A majority of debt incurred by Ukraine goes to support highly inefficient industries in the East: huge steel mills, coal mines, heavy industry factories. Currently, there is a steel, coal and iron ore glut on the world markets. A reform would mean shutting down those energy intensive and inefficient industries. This was the path taken by Poland, Romania and East Germany during the '90s. Needless to say, it brought a lot of pain and suffering, and in the case of Romania a lot of social unrest. 

To make the matter even more volatile, in Ukraine these factories are located in the Russophone part of the country. Any reforms will be met with resistance, as they have been for the past 20 years.

Which means you either continue to support the money losing factories in the East, which neither EU nor Russia want to do, or you reform the industry heavy Russophone area and risk even more social unrest and splitting the country.

Third, shaky banks must be restructured and crumbling ones closed, and a “bad bank” set up to hold the debris. Fourth, massive current surpluses in Germany and the Netherlands will have to fall. These surpluses are making it extremely difficult and painful for the eurozone periphery to adjust. Mr Renzi should channel his rebellious spirit and make this case to his northern neighbours.""

Però questa storia ha raggiunto l'orchidoclastia ed è ora di chiuderla.

Caro OP, non ti rendi conto che il problema non è in ciò che dici, ma in *come* lo dici?

Non ti rendi conto che se intervieni a gamba tesa in una comunità per dire a tutti che sono ""vigliacchi"", ""ciechi"" e ""pagati"", non riceverai altro che commenti critici e downvote?

Non ti rendi conto che fare il vittimismo, fin dalle prime parole del post (""Purtroppo so già che questo post sarà sotterrato in 5 minuti, e sarà l'ulteriore conferma di quello che dico""), significa alienarsi tutte le persone a cui quell'appello è rivolto? E che quel ""sarà l'ulteriore conferma di quello che dico"" alle nostre orecchie suona come un ""ho ragione io e non ho intenzione di cambiare idea""?

Rileggi il post che ha aperto questo thread: che cos'è, se non un piangersi addosso, un dramma greco sulla cosa più insignificante che c'è nell'universo, e cioè una discussione in un angolino del web?

E sai qual è il problema? È che non avresti neppure torto, fino a un certo punto. I dibattiti politici tirano fuori il peggio di /r/italy, e l'uso passivo-aggressivo dei downvote – sia a favore che contro i grillini – è ormai imperante, e degenera in queste beghe da asilo nido.

Coinvolgere gli utenti di /r/help è stato un passo falso, falsissimo, perché loro non solo non conoscono i problemi di /r/italy, ma non possono neppure comprenderli a causa del divario linguistico. Dall'altro lato, linkare quella discussione su /r/italy è stato molto peggio, perché non c'era altro intento che quello denigratorio, e mi auguro che chi l'ha fatto riceva uno shadowban.

Insomma, comportamenti puerili si vedono da entrambe le parti. La scelta migliore sarebbe stata non istigarli e non parteciparvi: lamentarsi del circlejerk è un conto, accusare tutto e tutti di collusione significa seminare vento.

Detto questo, un ultimo suggerimento. Dici che l'attacco è stato ""devastante psicologicamente"". Fai un passo indietro e guarda tutta la questione da un punto di vista più ampio. *Sono solo commenti su Internet.* Se queste quisquilie ti creano simili problemi psicologici, ti consiglio vivamente di prenderti una vacanza da Reddit.

Instead, why don't we simply adopt EU laws as mandated and do our reforms that way - for free? Plus, most of them make sense and don't cost us an arm and a leg. And we'll borrow from selling bonds, from the EBRD, EIB, banks, etc.

true,SecretEmperor,,Erlangen,"&gt; Oh please. We are talking about an app that runs on a platform that is largely closed source. In principle you are right, but it is still entirely meaningless and counter-productive since smartphones itself are are problematic. So YOU already made the decision that you DO NOT value your privacy (that much) when you bought the smartphone. You did it anyway, as most of us, since life is one enormous compromise.

Your argument relies completely on the false premise that it isn't possible to use a smart phone in a secure manner that protects one's privacy. Threema also runs on Android, which has several open-source implementations, such as CyanogenMod, readily available.

&gt; In the end this all comes down to trust. Yes I would vastly prefer a simple, beautiful, secure messaging app that is multi-plattform, multi-device and open source (No XMPP isn't it. ). But this does - to my knowledge - not exist yet.

XMPP is a protocol specification—*not* an app—that is publicly available or about as open source as a document can be (see RFC 6120). While ""beautiful"" and ""simple"" are subjective, apps that fit the criteria you've given certainly exist. See ChatSecure or Tox and its various implementations, for example.

&gt; But I do much prefer an app run by small company - under Swiss law, with an understandable revenue stream, a postal address - over an obscure behemoth of an app run by a company nobody seems to know very much about that is going to be taken over by one of the biggest privacy-offenders in existence.

That's great and I'm really happy for you for finding an app you like, but Threema nevertheless is not a solution if you need secure and private instant messaging.

&gt; So stop the ""holier than you"" attitude.

I'm arguing against the technical merits of Threema as a solution for ""seriously secure mobile messaging"", which it clearly isn't for the reason I've outlined.

But Russia doesn't mind oligarchs and corruption, in Russia they rule too, so Ukraine won't ever get rid of them and corruption if Ukraine will be allied with Russia. Nothing will change. They would need to go towards Russia to get even better deals like Belarus (which is sponsored by Russia, and Russians buy their last worthy national companies one by one in exchange for debts repayment).

So EU is better in the long term because it fights the corruption. It's not perfect of course, but it's much better than Russian system, where government, oligarchs and mafia controls everything.

Of course EU isn't perfect (there's still corruption there, during reforms it will even probably worsen for a while), but the attitude is different and with time the corruption decreases. And of course reforms will hurt people, but only for a while, corruption hurts forever.

A lot of them are.

I am not saying every German has a mediocre level of English. There are heaps of people who are really interested, work hard and would (save for the accent) probably be taken for native speakers. With the internet giving you the possibility to watch original movies and TV shows instead of cheap copies in German and lagging 2 years behind for TV shows, people are improving. But most people couldn't even watch an easy film in English with English subtitles.

Just remember, the slogan the Douglas perfume shop chain had once ""Come in and find out"" (yes, a German chain had an English slogan for their German shops) was misunderstood as ""Come in and then try to find your way out again.""

We can't even think about letting the Ukraine join in their current state. They first have to help themselves - mainly by rooting out corruption and not voting total psychopaths into power.

In ogni caso, come ad ogni nomina dei ministri, l'italiano medio deve esprimere il suo disappunto secondo il quale lui ne sa *sempre* più di chi ha fatto carriera ricoprendo cariche importanti e che se 3-4 ministri su 16 fanno cagare allora tutto il governo è da buttare e invece lui avrebbe sicuramente saputo nominare le persone giuste, tutte, e formare il consiglio dei ministri perfetto.  
No, perché, vi ricordate di quella volta in cui la gente fu contenta della scelta dei ministri? Nemmeno io.
Detto questo, era un po' fantascienza pensare che Renzi non infilasse dentro Alfano più un altro paio dei suoi. Lupi ai trasporti è un po' ""meh"" nel senso che non mi pare abbia fatto un ottimo lavoro, anzi, ma non è che ci fosse molto da fare, idem per la Lorenzin.
D'accordissimo con il discorso che ha fatto riguardo la Bonino agli esteri e la sua non riconferma è forse quella che non mi va giù più di tutte, tuttavia non abbiamo ancora nulla sull'operato della Mogherini quindi rimando le lamentele a posteriori.

Sul punto due, sono d'accordo. Matteo, wtf? No, seriously.
Riguardo la Giannini, Sofri può anche aver ragione ma dimentica che una cosa non esclude l'altra e potrebbe rivelarsi un buon ministro (devo ammettere però che il suo modo di fare mi sa tanto di quelle professoresse rompicazzo che se alzi la mano e chiedi cosa non hai capito sbuffa e si incazza).

&gt;1.04pm GMT In Kharhiv, it appears that the congress of politcians from the south and east have effectively said they will not be governed from Kiev. According to Russia Today:
&gt;
&gt;The Kharkov public gathering has announced a number of measures local authorities should take in response to the developments in Kiev. They should take full responsibility for all decision in respective regions, with no regard to authorities in Kiev until the constitutional order in Ukraine is restored, a resolution of the gathering says.
&gt;
&gt;The military commanders should take measures to protect arms depots and prevent their take-over and looting by radical opposition activists. Meanwhile citizens are encouraged to form local militias to protect public order. Local authorities are to fund and support those militias.

And:

&gt;Russia Today have reported some parts of the declaration from Kharkiv:
&gt;
&gt;“The territorial integrity of Ukraine is at risk,” the gathering stated in the resolution.
&gt;
&gt;It added that instability in Ukraine is highly dangerous and may cause unpredictable consequences, considering that the country hosts five nuclear power plants with 15 reactors in total, which some extremists have threatened to attack.
&gt;
&gt;The resent decisions of the national parliament were taken in conditions “of terror, threats of violence and death,” the resolution says. The gathering says the legislative acts may have been passed involuntarily and are neither legitimate nor lawful.
&gt;
&gt;The opposition has broken the agreement with the government signed on Friday, the resolution says. “Armed gangs have not given over their weapons, they continue taking over governmental buildings, killing citizens and officers of the law,” it says.",0,1393082362,null,0,false,0,cfltosy,t3_1yldtr,t1_cfltosy,t1_cfltgd6,null,1432509794,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

He had invited Vasilis Levendis, an aspiring politician with a private TV station which was chronically ridiculed by prank calls, to his TV show, a pale imitation of Sixty Minutes, and instead of asking him of his political views he proceeded to ridicule him as well, and take the side of the prank callers, in so much as admitting that he was one of them who pretended to order pizza instead of talking to Levendis, live on TV.

So he's even MORE of a hypocrite than I first thought. Back to the original reply...

&gt;Pay attention to the language that Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych used. He said that what was happening in Kiev was a coup, like the rise of Nazi Germany. The first thing to note is that the Rada is operating legally, and foreign leaders are already coming out and saying this much [..].

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;— Ryskeldi Satke (@RyskeldiSatke) February 22, 2014
&gt;
&gt;This is not a coincidence. Yanukovych is reportedly in Kharkiv, a pro-Yanukovych stronghold (or it’s supposed to be), and he’s at a conference of the “Ukrainian Front,” a collection of politicians, and pro-government street thugs, who are willing to die for the President. But as a recent article by the XX Committee points out, the Ukranian Front appears to be deeply influenced and controlled by the Russian government. In fact, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian State Duma, Alexei Pushkov, is present in Kharkiv right now. Here’s what the report has to say about [the nature of the Ukrainian Front](http://20committee.com/2014/02/03/meet-moscows-new-ukrainian-front/):
&gt;
&gt;&gt;It seems Moscow is not pleased with its protege Yanukovych and his inability to crush the opposition, so it is forming a new grouping to “assist” the hardliners. Given that the appearance of the Ukrainian Front has been heralded with a birth announcement in the Kremlin’s official newspaper, Russian approval and support can be assumed. [..]
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Now that the Ukrainian Front has entered the picture, with Moscow’s imprimatur, expect the situation in Ukraine to only get worse. It would be difficult to overstate the danger Ukraine and Europe are in at the moment thanks to intimidation, meddling and provocation by Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin. European governments would be well advised to not permit naked Russian interference of a violent and coercive sort in Ukrainian politics: this cannot end well.
&gt;
&gt;And now we have rallies in Sevastopol, where the Russian Black Fleet is anchored, in favor of reuniting with Russia (jump to update 1410).
&gt;
&gt;But the Ukrainian Front is not asking to be reunited with Russia. They are asking to regain control of Ukraine. To do this, however, they’ll likely have to do it by force at this point. And if the Russians are putting their full weight behind Yanukovych, and are using the Ukrainian Front as the mechanism for controlling the situation on the ground, the laughter about the zoo and the galleon could quickly be replaced by far darker sentiments in the next few days.",0,1393082732,null,0,false,0,cfltsqe,t3_1yldtr,t1_cfltsqe,t1_cfltosy,null,1432509847,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Again from the Guardian live feed, from a little earlier:

&gt;1.04pm GMT In Kharhiv, it appears that the congress of politcians from the south and east have effectively said they will not be governed from Kiev. According to Russia Today:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The Kharkov public gathering has announced a number of measures local authorities should take in response to the developments in Kiev. They should take full responsibility for all decision in respective regions, with no regard to authorities in Kiev until the constitutional order in Ukraine is restored, a resolution of the gathering says.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The military commanders should take measures to protect arms depots and prevent their take-over and looting by radical opposition activists. Meanwhile citizens are encouraged to form local militias to protect public order. Local authorities are to fund and support those militias.

And:

&gt;Russia Today have reported some parts of the declaration from Kharkiv:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;“The territorial integrity of Ukraine is at risk,” the gathering stated in the resolution.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It added that instability in Ukraine is highly dangerous and may cause unpredictable consequences, considering that the country hosts five nuclear power plants with 15 reactors in total, which some extremists have threatened to attack.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The resent decisions of the national parliament were taken in conditions “of terror, threats of violence and death,” the resolution says. The gathering says the legislative acts may have been passed involuntarily and are neither legitimate nor lawful.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;The opposition has broken the agreement with the government signed on Friday, the resolution says. “Armed gangs have not given over their weapons, they continue taking over governmental buildings, killing citizens and officers of the law,” it says.",0,1393083034,null,0,false,0,cfltw4l,t3_1ygam0,t1_cfltw4l,t3_1ygam0,null,1432509892,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt;Pay attention to the language that Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych used. He said that what was happening in Kiev was a coup, like the rise of Nazi Germany. The first thing to note is that the Rada is operating legally, and foreign leaders are already coming out and saying this much [..]. But if you look at the terminology used here, it echoes the terminology used by Russia State news outlets.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Russian state TV channel Rossiya 24's been running pro-Yanuk convention in Kharkiv for half a day already in anti #Euromaidan direction
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;— Ryskeldi Satke (@RyskeldiSatke) February 22, 2014
&gt;
&gt;This is not a coincidence. Yanukovych is reportedly in Kharkiv, a pro-Yanukovych stronghold (or it’s supposed to be), and he’s at a conference of the “Ukrainian Front,” a collection of politicians, and pro-government street thugs, who are willing to die for the President. But as a recent article by the XX Committee points out, the Ukranian Front appears to be deeply influenced and controlled by the Russian government. In fact, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian State Duma, Alexei Pushkov, is present in Kharkiv right now. Here’s what the report has to say about [the nature of the Ukrainian Front](http://20committee.com/2014/02/03/meet-moscows-new-ukrainian-front/):
&gt;
&gt;&gt;It seems Moscow is not pleased with its protege Yanukovych and his inability to crush the opposition, so it is forming a new grouping to “assist” the hardliners. Given that the appearance of the Ukrainian Front has been heralded with a birth announcement in the Kremlin’s official newspaper, Russian approval and support can be assumed. [..]
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Now that the Ukrainian Front has entered the picture, with Moscow’s imprimatur, expect the situation in Ukraine to only get worse. It would be difficult to overstate the danger Ukraine and Europe are in at the moment thanks to intimidation, meddling and provocation by Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin. European governments would be well advised to not permit naked Russian interference of a violent and coercive sort in Ukrainian politics: this cannot end well.
&gt;
&gt;And now we have rallies in Sevastopol, where the Russian Black Fleet is anchored, in favor of reuniting with Russia (jump to update 1410).
&gt;
&gt;But the Ukrainian Front is not asking to be reunited with Russia. They are asking to regain control of Ukraine. To do this, however, they’ll likely have to do it by force at this point. And if the Russians are putting their full weight behind Yanukovych, and are using the Ukrainian Front as the mechanism for controlling the situation on the ground, the laughter about the zoo and the galleon could quickly be replaced by far darker sentiments in the next few days.",0,1393083082,null,0,false,0,cfltwo5,t3_1ygam0,t1_cfltwo5,t3_1ygam0,null,1432509898,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

They need to eat and to pay for gas and the only people with money in Ukraine are the oligarchs and Russians.

So it's up to Ukrainians to make reforms, but it's up to us (EU) to give them hope and money. Poland got money (and more imporantly - promises of joining the EU and NATO if all goes well) long before 2004. It was a goal that politicians had to keep in mind at all times. If there was something people argued about - one of the most important arguments was always ""EU standards require it"".

That was why minorities in Poland have the right to put up signs with city names in their language if there's enough of them. That's why big minorities have guaranteed place in Polish parliament even if their party haven't passed 5% support level that regular parties have to pass. That's why TPSA communication network monopoly had to give up their network to competitors even when there were no real competition and nobody believed there ever will be. It looked like it's just superficial law, but we did it and it paid off. Same with energy market changes - Poles can choose their energy company now - nobody does that, cause the price differences are small, and it's a lot of paperwork for small gain, but the possibility is there and eventually this will make the market more competive. And there were tons of such changes, some of them hurt, some of them went horribly wrong (polish train company - PKP is example of how that can backfire - there's a saying in Poland that they made one company to manage the left rail and another company to manage the right rail, and they can't agree to anything now).

How can that be? GDP more than doubled between 1990 and 2014. There was a steep increase until about 2008, when the world recession hit. If the population decreased, as you said, the increase of GDP per person would be even higher.

Yes, the Ukraine had a strong industrial sector, notably in aerospace and defense. But like in Russia, GDR and elsewhere, it just crumbled because the technology couldn't compete on the international market. And falling defense budgets did hit the industry hard.

-Se ho di meglio da fare.

Questo condito da un'ossessione bislacca per il karma, un tono aggressivo e vittimista.

Ovviamente è stato massacrato nei commenti, tra pernacchioni e downvote.

Vedendo ora che op ha accusato psicologicamente questa roba probabilmente non lo rifarei. Ma allora mi era sembrato normalissimo.

The Rada [has 445 members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_parliamentary_election,_2012#Results), and in the 2012 elections:

* the Party of Regions got 185, 
* the Communists another 32, 
* Fatherland + UDIHR + Svoboda pooled 178, 
* and an independents and minor parties 50. 

So to get to 328 votes for impeachment, even supposing that all of the independent/minor-party MPs were present and voted in favour, another 100 Regionalists/Communists must have voted in favour too.

Now if things would go smoothly and in a non-retarded way, there would be 2 parallel branches of power existing up until presidential elections on 25th of May. The possibility of a pro-Russian candidate victory is minimal, so Ukraine will get someone like Yatsenyuk/Klichko (with a probability of Timoshenko giving support to one of them) -&gt; Anti-Russian president -&gt; no deal, no better gas prices, increased economic pressure, no restructuring of loans and so on. 


So Ukraine will need money to simply not default until 25th of May and then depending on who won, they would need even more money. If EU treaty would be signed, i believe commentators even here acknowledged that a lot of Ukrainian industry would fall apart and closed down, so European Union would need to fund educational programs as well (if you destroy someones job, its a good idea to give them another one or skills to get a new one). There are of course other problems like infrastructure etc, but its not critical.

&gt;Article 111

&gt;The President of Ukraine may be removed from office by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine by the procedure of impeachment, in the event that he or she commits state treason or other crime.

&gt;The issue of the removal of the President of Ukraine from office by the procedure of impeachment is initiated by the majority of the constitutional composition of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.

&gt;To conduct the investigation, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine establishes a special temporary investigatory commission whose composition includes a special prosecutor and special investigators.

&gt;The conclusions and proposals of the temporary investigatory commission are considered at a meeting of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.

&gt;For cause, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, by no less than two-thirds of its constitutional composition, adopts a decision on the accusation of the President of Ukraine.

&gt;The decision on the removal of the President of Ukraine from office by the procedure of impeachment is adopted by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine by no less than three- quarters of its constitutional composition, after the review of the case by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine and the receipt of its opinion on the observance of the constitutional procedure of investigation and consideration of the case of impeachment, and the receipt of the opinion of the Supreme Court of
Ukraine to the effect that the acts, of which the President of Ukraine is accused, contain elements of state treason or other crime.

This process was not followed, so this cannot be considered impeachment. Other than impeachment, the President's term only ends early due to death, resignation, or inability to exercise his or her powers for reasons of health (Article 108).

Thus, the constitutional requirements were not followed. This is an extra-legal decree. Its legitimacy essentially derives from popular support.

Girls of Slavgorod and surrounding areas were brought to Annenkov’s train, raped, and then shot.** According to an eyewitness, Annenkov behaved with brutal torture: victims had their eyes gouged and tongues and strips of their back cut off, were buried alive, or tied to horses.

Bon y'en a dont vous avez forcément entendu parler, parmi les moins médiatisés ceux que j'ai vus et aimés (j'essaie de pas spoiler, je crois que c'est ok?):

- L'inconnu du lac: qui est sorti au moment où on ne parlait que de La vie d'Adèle, j'avais juste entendu parler de la polémique sur l'affiche et du coup j'étais pas allée le voir, pensant que ce serait un film d'auteur un peu chiant sur l'homosexualité masculine. En fait non, j'ai vraiment été prise par le scénario, comme je l'avais dit ça m'a fait penser à ""Harry un ami qui vous veut du bien"". Et donc il y a de bons acteurs, de beaux paysages et surtout une ambiance particulière qui fonctionne bien; Ça commence lentement, on est au bord d'un lac l'été et...

- La fille du 14 juillet: une comédie politique burlesque sur fond de crise économique. C'est très français, très drôle sans être lourd ou trop extravagant. A mon avis on adhère ou pas, moi je me suis bien marrée. On sent que c'est un petit budget mais ça ajoute à son charme, il y a clairement un côté rétro alors qu'il se situe dans l'époque actuelle.

(C'est les 2 qui ressortent pour moi. 

Sinon, autre comédie: ""les beaux jours"", on se marre moins que dans la fille du 14 juillet, c'est pas le même genre clairement mais si sur le papier on peut avoir des doutes sur le couple Ardant-Lafitte en fait ça fonctionne très très bien, c'est pas le film de la décennie ni celui de l'année mais ça vaut le coup d’œil. 

Les petits princes: c'est sur un jeune qui veut devenir footballeur pro, autant vous dire que j'ai commencé le film en me disant que ça serait pas pour moi. Ben non, c'est pas un film (que) pour les ados mâles. Il y a de tout: c'est drôle, émouvant, il y a du suspense. 

Elle s'en va c'est un peu pareil: il y a un peu de tout, on rit bien et c'est touchant aussi. J'allais en dire plus mais je m'arrête là.


Si vous voulez du drame: La religieuse, Pierre de patience: ... c'est ce à quoi on peut s'attendre, les comédiennes sont bien.)

Et pour les films étrangers La Grande Belleza vaut vraiment le coup d’œil, c'est sublime, et aussi un peu déprimant :) Idem pour Alabama Monroe: je savais juste que c'était sur des chanteurs country, j'étais pas préparée au reste...

States have existed for as long as we can remember, but nation, the very concept of nation, is a ""recent"" development that we Westeners exported to Asia. Same way as flags. Before flags people took royal penchants to battle, they fought for their king. The flag of Nepal is still a royal penchant. China, Japan and many others adopted the very European concept of nation-state (although it can be argued that China is indeed a civilization-state, but that would merit another discussion). Before its revolution, China existed as the territories of the Qing dinasty and Japan before the Meiji period was a pretty unstable conglomerate of Daimyos.

A nation is also not a geographical location. It's a pretty sophisticated thing that requires an agreed upon national mythology (the Finnish and Germans embraced paganism), customs, race, language and even religion. The concept of self-determination is also a completely romantic invention that didn't exist before.

The best way I can explain this is using romance. Romantic love is also recent as hell. ""But wait, SpanishNinjitsu, didn't people fall in love before the late 18th century?"".

true,New-Atlantis,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Its pretty simple, EU wanted Ukraine in its sphere of influence, they got them.

I don't think it is that. EU leaders have for the last 10 years consistently said that the Ukraine should not expect EU membership. Trade deals yes, but membership no. We need to do trade deals with all our partners including Russia. And we also cannot close our eyes to obvious violations of human rights in a neighboring country that has signed up to the OSCE. There is a fine line to tread between promoting democracy and the rule of law and political interference in another country, but I think your characterization is clearly not justified.

I think with EU help, the IMF can probably take care of the debts. The priority will be to form a stable government, which is necessary for economic recovery. And economic recovery is necessary to keep the pot from boiling over again in a couple of years. 

But I agree that the biggest problem is Ukraine's dependence on fossil fuels from Russia. I think the EU has to start thinking big and do a deal with Russia.

Such calls are not without merit, most of the money given to Greece, Portugal, Spain or Ireland as bailout went to the banks that held that debt initially, which just happened to be mostly from western Europe.

If the EU really wanted to save Ukraine, it would tell the Ukrainian Government that they will loan it money after it defaults on its current debt. That would help them a lot more than just giving them one more loan to pay back their old loans and kicking the can down the road.

true,celebdor,CZEC,Czech Republic,"&gt;Mass immigration from rural and undeveloped lands towards industrial centers has happened in Spain, in France, in the UK, in Germany and practically in every single country ever since the industrial revolution. There were Andalusians and Galicians packing their bags and moving to Madrid and Barcelona since the 1800s,

And even moroccans.But none of them were mass migration though.

&gt;way before Franco, the Second Republic and Primo de Rivera.

With the fascist regimes it was though. So completely different things. One is normal good and enriching, the other one is problematic if not planned properly so that the new inhabitants are properly mixed and blended with the current one. Otherwise integration is more troublesome for the settling population.

&gt;Not long ago I met a nostalgic Francoist who told me, quite seriously, that the Moroccans were planning to conquer Spain by letting thousands of them cross the borders and, eventually, use that growing demographics to annex Ceuta, Melilla and a nice chunk of Andalusia. They were killing the Spanish culture, he said! Now try to imagine how your argument about Spain sending poor workers to ""conquer"" Catalonia sounds to me.

Catalonia is a welcoming and integrating land. A significant amount of the people that sustain the Catalan culture and would vote for independence are these immigrants. So that was never a real worry in Catalonia. There is no greatest satisfaction than to see a foreigner learn your language and take part in the culture voluntarily, that is the success of migration, to take the new culture and to keep your own.

&gt;Oh boy, Godwin's law so early? Nice discussion, though.

I wouldn't say it was that early, but in any case it is a similar case. The difference is that sudetenland was about 85% ethnically German (but of Czech) and Catalonia never had particular ethnics and was never culturally Spanish (as Spain as a State, unlike Switzerland, never embraced its multiple nations as source of Nationality).

I think the Guardian the other day published the losses in export earnings due to the lack of foreign language expertise in UK export companies. I can't remember what it was, but it was a double digit bn figure.

Perhaps the British would get on better with continentals if they knew more foreign languages. It's not just a matter of communication, but the ability to think in another language gives you deeper level of comprehension of other people.",0,1393099489,null,0,false,0,cfm05yg,t3_1ym9l4,t1_cfm05yg,t1_cflznwb,null,1432512914,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Please, you come off like a religious fundamentalist lecturing on the origins of humanity. If you are philosophically illiterate it is fine to just not voice your unsubstantiated opinion.

&gt;And that it could work in its final form, after few generations of education

You see, the problem here is that you think society is shaped by ideas and not by economic conditions. I recommend this wonderful work:

http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm

&gt;Modern communists are pathetic

Yes, the folks over at /r/communism are pathetic for idolizing Stalin and Mao, state capitalism, nationalizations, the state, and the failure of Leninism and post-Leninism. There's idiots who are motivated by nostalgia and vague fuzzy feelings instead of reason everywhere, but this is no indictment upon communism, only upon /r/communism and upon the charicatures in your head.

&gt;in how they fail to realize problems in mechanism of communism,

Marxism is all about the mechanics of society and how it transforms itself.

&gt;while wanking to its ideas 

Idealists 'wank' to ideas. Communists (or at least the educated ones) are materialists.

&gt;and shunning past incarnations of it.

Nuh-uh. If you want to know a little about past incarnations, and the movement of the working class whereupon communism is based you can look [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Revolution) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune). The problem with the USSR is not that it was a 'bad' implementation of it, but that there was no implementation at all, because the mode of production was not taken apart and the economy wasn't taken into the custody of democratic workers' councils (or Soviets) at all. The experience of the USSR only confirms Marxist theory.

Communism is not a 'nice idea'. It is a terrible 'idea', because if it remains a 'idea' that is 'implemented' it does not work. Communism does not arise from a great idea but from the necessity born within the development of capitalist production. It is a movement born out of class society out of necessity, and all the theoretical wank that communists engage in is only predicated upon this movement.",0,1393099567,null,0,false,0,cfm0733,t3_1ymeng,t1_cfm0733,t1_cflzlou,null,1432512929,-8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-8

&gt;Villages were torched. Roman Catholic priests were axed or crucified. Churches were burned with all their parishioners. Isolated farms were attacked by gangs carrying pitchforks and kitchen knives. Throats were cut. Pregnant women were bayoneted. Children were cut in two. Men were ambushed in the field and led away. The perpetrators could not determine the province's future. But at least they could determine that it would be a future without Poles.[85]

&gt;Timothy Snyder describes the murders: ""Ukrainian partisans burned homes, shot or forced back inside those who tried to flee, and used sickles and pitchforks to kill those they captured outside. In some cases, beheaded, crucified, dismembered, or disemboweled bodies were displayed, in order to encourage remaining Poles to flee"".[86] A similar account has been presented by Niall Ferguson, who wrote: ""Whole villages were wiped out, men beaten to death, women raped and mutilated, babies bayoneted.""[87] Ukrainian historian Yuryi Kirichuk described the conflict as similar to medieval rebellions.[88]",0,1393101655,null,0,false,0,cfm10e4,t3_1yfik5,t1_cfm10e4,t1_cfk5a1e,null,1432513314,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

But I think facebook activism does more harm in the long run. 

It lets society vent without actually changing anything, it generates and reinforces the rebel without a cause angsty teen stereotype and it poses a flimsy opposition to political figures. Also protesting nowadays is done out of boredom and are politically organised by a official established party as a faux political instrument.

IRL, only practical problems matter. An adult doesn't give a shit about privacy but tell him his office chrome browser history will be used to advertise fleshligths on his home computer. And he'll read even the longest EULA.

That was an insult, but I guess it turned out to be true.

A single vote won't change anything. Heck, you know that, you're not retarded, but guess what, the entire college educated voting population's vote won't change anything, you know why because you're stirring up shit, and you hope you'll get some surface shit that doesn't stink. 

Poor governing floods countries not the rain per se.

You do not matter, any leader you have is herding you like cattle, money just makes the harness more comfortable. 

You can work with the system, and be politically active(sharing shit and microblogging snarky comments on current events doesn't count) be an active voice, engage in debate with other social categories, point out how the system affects them in a negative way, do not contradict understand and respond. Or you could try hard mode: found a nonprofit think tank, slowly become a respectful opposition that speaks not only for you and your generation but for the whole herd, teach other activist to communicate their ideas in a non selfish way, spread until society demands the change like it would be self evident and common sense. No civil rights movement succeeded by simply asking for change in the streets and expecting politicians to just bow down and figure out what they want and how to make it happen.",0,1393102075,null,0,false,0,cfm168n,t3_1ybvtc,t1_cfm168n,t1_cflrspj,null,1432513389,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I think it would be irresponsible to awaken hopes of EU membership. EU leaders have always made it clear that isn't an option, even if the Poles see it differently.

The deal was more about finding a solution all could live with, that in itself is hard enough. In the end, the pressure from the street was too much and the Russians probably gave up on Yanukovych and his ability to lead the country. Also part of the deal probably was about who pays for what, and I expect the EU diplomats had to give some assurances that the Ukraine wouldn't be left in the lurch when Putin cuts off the funding and/or the gas.

Also at this summit, it was agreed that the foreign ministers of both countries should go on missions together. In this instance, the mission was augmented by the Polish foreign minister, which Steinmeier had to call from his skying holiday. Steinmeier also visited Putin in Moscow beforehand, so as to sound out the Russians. Clearly, the three heavy-weights from the EU can punch harder than Lady Ashton.

I think if the EU can project soft-power by diplomacy, that is always preferable over having another country bombed to peaces by Nato planes.

&gt; The Danish response to the Nazis illuminates a crucial fact about the Holocaust: the Germans did not always force the issue of extermination where they faced determined resistance from occupied populations. In Bulgaria, as Tzvetan Todorov has shown in his aptly titled book The Fragility of Goodness, the Jews were saved because the king of Bulgaria, the Orthodox Church, and a few key Bulgarian politicians refused to assist the German occupiers. Why did a similar civic sense of solidarity not take root in other countries? In Holland, why did 80 percent of Dutch Jews perish? And what about France: why did liberty, equality, and fraternity not apply to the citizens driven from their homes by French police and sent to deportation and death? These questions become harder to answer in the light of the Danish and Bulgarian counterexamples. One possible explanation is that the German occupation’s presence in Denmark was lighter than in either France or Holland. The Danes, like the Bulgarians, kept their king and maintained their own government throughout the occupation. Self-government gave them a capacity to defend Jews that was never possible in the occupied zones of France or Holland.

true,Toc_a_Somaten,CATA,Catalonia,"No, I'm not mistaking nation with state, from  my point of view is it you who is mistaking nation with *nation-state*. If you speak about the ""very concept of nation"" then we have a problem, because every language has one. Is it true that in english the term is used overwelmingly to refer to nation-states, but that is not the case in, for example, spanish, which although it is used, it has other broadly accepted definitions. 

And even in english, you have the ""native american nations"", or ""the arab nation"", etc... Here we enter very much into anthropology and semantics, and i know we don't want to go there. But the thing is: nations exist and existed regardless of the ""state"" form they choosed. So you have the jews, who had several kingdoms but still are one nation. 

A nation can be defined as a group of people with a common language or family of languages, a common heritage and culture and even a sense of community or homogeneity. Thus yes, in japan there were several states in the Tokugawa era, in fact even before that, and all were considered japanese; unlike the chinese and koreans, which were foreigners. And BTW before the meiji era the Bakufu was anything but unstable (i just had to say it).

What you are talking all the time is about nation-statehood and nationalism, and these are ideologies. Nationalism is an ideology, and this is indeed new, ideology as a concept is fairly new. Nationalism tried to vertebrate the *nation* with a standarisation of its culture and sometimes its language, *into a state*, oposite of what you were claiming. The meiji ""restoration"" didn't created the japanese nation, it wanted to forge the japanese nation into a state. The same with Garibaldi and the same with bismark. Some times, as in france or spain, several national entities would fight for preeminence in this new state, or just to stay alive and adapt. 

Is scotland more ""nation"" than Catalonia? Why? Because in one side there was negotiation, and in the other there was annexation? Scotland also was in a union of sorts with england, just like catalonia with ""spain"". But really, if you want to pursue the comparison of the catalan case with scotland better open another thread (no problem from my part).

And please, I read what you said of the war of spanish succession and catalonia. ""A war of nobles against nobles which didn't concerned the common people"". This couldn't be more wrong. I respect your opinion, I do, but this is not right. Do you really think that catalonia fighted as fanatically as it did just for a king?? Off course not, the people defended the entire political model the austrian model represented *for catalonia*; that is, their individual and collective rights. Why else? Until then catalans managed their taxes, foreign trade, and yes, war. 

Also you said that catalonia didn't suffer more than other ""regions"" during franco. Well, I'm gonna piss those extremadurans and others. Catalonia had indeed an extra layer of repression, agains its language and culture, it was an ""spanish nationalist fascist"" dictatorship. For 40 fucking years. The catalans werent only ""reds"", we were the ""rojo-separatistas"", more evil than the rest. Hell, even that old Tart Jordi Pujol was arrested, tortured and jailed because he dared to sing the catalan national anthem in a chorus. 

Well, I don't know, i'm actually tired of having to explain it all again and again and again, just to justify we exist. Don t take it personally, please, it's just the circle goes on and on, and many in spain just plain flat refuse to accept we exist as a nation, against any evidence, no matter left or right. Now, I just want to vote, most people here just want to vote. As you can figure by now, I will vote yes, and a million times yes. I don't care if anyone in spain thinks we are just an invention of some greedy elites in 1880 or wathever. 

And oh, please. Romantic love is not recent as hell, where did you got that??? Yeah, SpanishNinjitsu, people fell in love and married all the time before the XVIII century. ""Romantic"" love as we understand it in the west is a product of the XII-XIII  century (trobadours, ""amor cortes"", etc), in the Septimania-Occitania (at that time this was the western elite culture), and from there to northern france, to england, to germany, italy, etc etc. 

 Not everyone was rich enough back then to have much to gain or loose in a marriage, and you would be surprised of how many parents wanted their daughters and sons to be happy. Popular myths, just as popular science, are interesting, but not inherently accurate.

Off course not all the marriages were ""for love"", but love was THE reason someone was supposed to marry in the christian world. Are all marriages for love now? No, that's why there's so many divorces, because you are supposed to be ""in love"" to marry, and many people isn't.

&gt;  First of all, the Ukrainian People's Republic was destroyed by Pavlo Skoropadskyi

The state Skoropadskyi established was still Ukraine. Then he was overthrown by Simon Petlura. The last Ukrainian government was destroyed by Soviets.

&gt; Secondly, the famine in Ukraine started in 1932, not 1920.

Ukraine had three famines, we call them three waves of Holodomor:

* 1920-1921
* 1932-1933 - the worst and the most horrible, the only that is widely known outside of Ukraine
* 1946-1947

&gt; Thirdly, how did Lenin destroy Ukrainian culture?

Google about attack on religion and aspects of culture that were associated with religion.

&gt; Mykola Khvylovy, Mykola Kulish, Pavlo Tychyna just to name a few.

They are known as Shot Renaissance. They all had some short period of activity and then were either shot or forced to collaborate. Really good writers and poets. They existed against the will of regime

He also fails to appreciate the deep-seated aversion against all things military that still pervades much of West Germans society.

Paris has a big expat community, and you will have no trouble finding English speakers to hang out with. Some of the expats in Paris are  super annoying. I dunno why. Not all of them. You have to find the ones who are not wankers. Anyway. In pretty much any other part of France, it'll be much more difficult to meet anglos, but way easier to learn French by meeting friendly French people, if you're motivated. And you should be motivated if you seriously want to live here. 

My partner and I have online jobs. Dunno if that's an option for you. It doesn't help with the whole ""integrating into society"" thing, though. 

I'm not an expert on the partner situation and there are probably better options for you, but there is a thing called the working holiday visa which allows you to stay for one year without actually working or being sponsored by a company. You have the option to work but it's no questions asked at the time of applying for the visa. Unfortunately I think it might have an age limit... anyway, google it. 

As for the paperwork, expect it to be a headache. That is the only advice I can give as everyone seems to have different experiences that all have that one thing in common. Don't rely on internet advice, talk to some kind of official person, and if you don't like the answer you get, talk to another one before giving up.

(My impression is that you'll need to be married to get a long term residence permit and I don't think you'll be allowed to work unless a company sponsors you based on your specialized skills. Government red tape can be substantial. Bring a big bucket of patience and never expect to get something done on a first visit to some office. :) )

Whether you'll find a job depends a lot on the field you're in. For software engineers I believe it's possible to find a job even without speaking French. (Though it may be less interesting than what you're used to.)

My advice from my own experience as an expat in France: start learning French now. Work on it as intensively as you can as soon as you can. Continue when you get there, either with the free classes at city hall (mairie) if you qualify, or with a private tutor if you don't. (I found a private tutor quite effective.) Use multiple modalities of learning to switch it up, e.g. duolingo app, memrise or an index card app, music or radio, you name it. Seriously, this is one of the biggest things you can do to improve your experience there. More and more French people speak some English, especially in Paris metro area, but lots of them still don't at all or are very hesitant to speak it.
