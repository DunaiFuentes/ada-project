Dipende da caso a caso no? È fondamentale agire nell'interesse del minore, non su basi etniche che sarebbe illogico, ma su criteri oggettivi. Come per qualunque cittadino: genitori alcolizzati e violenti per esempio non dovrebbero essere lasciati liberi di danneggiare i figli, e questo indipendentemente da colore della pelle o dalla religione o dall'estrazione sociale. Il che è diverso dal dire ""sono zingari e quindi incapaci di tirare su altro che piccoli criminali"".

Do you have numbers?   Because I don't think is the case.

There have been years, in the old D-Mark times (before the Euro), where Germany was exporting more per year than the US. For example, in the year 1990 we exported for 421.100 million USD, while the US exported for 393.592 million USD. Germany was No.1 export country in 1986-1988, 1990, 2003-2008 (that is, it was before the US and China).

[Source](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welthandel/Tabellen_und_Grafiken#Die_drei_f.C3.BChrenden_Exportl.C3.A4nder)

Export isn't just the value of the currency. It's product productivty, palette, quality, esteem of a product, marketing, flexibility, service. And even remote things like corruption, efficience of the administration, or how people see live (e.g. relaxed, or work- and career oriented).

Yes, the currency plays a role, but if the currencies don't flow too far apart, that role doesn't look lile to be the most important role.

&gt;The controversy has gained extra heat because of the alarming increase in anti-Jewish racism. As we reported today, during the course of a single July week, eight synagogues in France were attacked, one of them firebombed by a 400-strong crowd, whose chants and banners included “Death to Jews” and “Slit Jews’ throats”. More chilling still, given that country’s history, Molotov cocktails have been hurled at synagogues in Germany, where chants heard at pro-Palestinian protests have included “Jew, coward pig, come out and fight alone”, and “Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas”. The lay leader of Germany’s Jews told the Guardian that “these are the worst times since the Nazi era”. In Britain too there has been a spike in antisemitic incidents, with monitoring groups saying July was the second worst month in 30 years. It is the same spike they see every time the conflict in the Middle East escalates.

There was a lot of hope for establishing Norway as a car producing nation, with an environmental aspect, but the company was struggling. As far as I know, the incentives was introduced as a measure in order to assist in the local sales of this Norwegian car company, after active lobbying by EV and environmental organizations. Eventually, the company was sold to Ford and closed up, but the incentives stayed in place for the cars already on the road.

Up until the introduction of the Leaf and the Model S, EV's was pretty much special interest. With the recent introduction of the Leaf, EV's got regional range, and interest grew with EV as a second car for commuting in the metro areas. With the Model S, the cars got family size and international range, and replaced ICE completely in many households. Nobody really foresaw this sudden trend, but here we are, with Teslas being a common sight all over Norway, enjoying incentives initially made for a plastic car with around 70km range.

The incentives were promised to last until 2017, or until 50000 EV's are registered, whichever came first. That number is getting close to 35000 now, up from around 10000 when the Model S arrived in August (based on my observations of the incrementing EV licence plate numbers).

2. [Percentages of people in European countries with no belief in a spirit, god, or life force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Europe_No_Belief.png)

For those that are uninformed:

&gt; In Europe:

* Germany should be offered the de facto political dominance over most Protestant and Catholic states located within Central and Eastern Europe. Kaliningrad oblast could be given back to Germany. The book uses the term a ""Moscow-Berlin axis"".

* France should be encouraged to form a ""Franco-German bloc"" with Germany. Both countries have a ""firm anti-Atlanticist tradition"".

* United Kingdom should be cut off from Europe.

* Finland should be absorbed into Russia. Southern Finland will be combined with the Republic of Karelia and northern Finland will be ""donated to Murmansk Oblast"".

* Estonia should be given to Germany's sphere of influence.

* Latvia and Lithuania should be given a ""special status"" in the Eurasian-Russian sphere.

* Poland should be granted a ""special status"" in the Eurasian sphere.

* Romania, Macedonia, ""Serbian Bosnia"" and Greece - ""orthodox collectivist East"" - will unite with the ""Moscow the Third Rome"" and reject the ""rational-individualistic West"".

* Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as an independent state with certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.

&gt; In the United States:

* Russia should use its special forces within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism. For instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"". Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.""",0,1407704577,null,0,1407705339,0,cjmhyr7,t3_2d5bat,t1_cjmhyr7,t1_cjmeubw,null,1435171424,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

When the police arrived these scumbags then cried racism, accusing us of having racially insulted them, which was ridiculous given the situation. And it's not the 80s anymore... Thankfully, the police are kind of used to this bullshit, and perhaps clearly saw that on the one side there was us, casual students just trying to have a good time, and the typical street thugs on the other hand. It would be pretty ridiculous if we had looked for a fight against those idiots. 

So I'm glad to say that it doesn't just take minorities to scream out hate crime for an experienced police to buy into that bullshit.

With 300 000 tonnes of lithium a year, as your source states, and with 3kg lithium / kWh as your source also hints to, that would hold for (300 000 000kg/ 3kg/kWh) / 85kWh = 1.18 million EVs, which would be 1% of 118 million cars produced every year. 

You suggest all EVs sold will carry a 85kWh battery. Using worst case scenarios to support our arguments, are we? The most successful EV ever produced carries a 24kWh battery. With 300 000 tonnes of lithium a year that would hold for (300 000 000 kg/ 3kg/kWh) / 24 kWh = 4.17 million EVs. No recycling.

A few months later, Igor Ivanov, Russia's Foreign Minister, was in Bucharest and he was questioned by journalists about his views on ""Romania becoming a bridge"" to Russia. His answer was: ""We don't need a bridge. We can talk with countries directly.""

Russia is a threat. Always was and will be for as long as it exists. You're either in NATO or you're fucked. We all saw how numb EU countries were to Russia's actions.

One, people dislike gays, which is why the existing legislation is not gay friendly (Latvia is also one of the EU countries that have a constitutional ban on gay marriage in place), and two, the main concern and argument of those who are against the EU (though the population as a whole is quite pro-EU) is that we're giving up independence by letting Brussels decide our laws.

Therefore, having the EU directly mandate a law that would be hugely unpopular even as a local-only law would likely be met with a lot of negativity.

I generally do not think that the various forms of bigotry, be it homophobia or something else, can be just eliminated through laws. For such laws to be passed, the society must first reach a certain level of acceptance through purely social processes such as education (mainly).

And some numbers, because numbers are good to have. The 2015 Europride will be held in Latvia, and in a 2012 survey, 57% said it should ""definitely not"" happen, and 21% said ""probably not"". For some reason I cannot immediately find any recent surveys regarding same-sex marriage, but from 2006 to 2009 surveys showed consistent support levels of only 10-11%.

meaning that the world's 18-39 million tons of lithium will be used a lot faster. Also we will have more laptops, phones and other portable devices. Do not think that all of that is going to build cars.

&gt;With 300 000 tonnes of lithium a year, as your source states, and with 3kg lithium / kWh as your source also hints to, that would hold for (300 000 000kg/ 3kg/kWh) / 85kWh = 1.18 million EVs, which would be 1% of 118 million cars produced every year

Assuming a world wide ban on laptops, cellphones, many ceramics, medicines and substances used in the petroleum industry we could get a bit over 1%. I however am not going to give up my phone.



&gt;You suggest all EVs sold will carry a 85kWh battery. Using worst case scenarios to support our arguments, are we? The most successful EV ever produced carries a 24kWh battery. With 300 000 tonnes of lithium a year that would hold for (300 000 000 kg/ 3kg/kWh) / 24 kWh = 4.17 million EVs. No recycling. 

The Nissan leaf can drive 120 km in good condition when it is new and is a tiny car. It is a slow car. This is a huge downgrade from a gasoline car. A bus, truck, tractor, tank etc is going to need a LOT more than 85 kWh.

The idea of Hate Crimes was developed in the United States during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's (that's when that Martin Luther King Jr. guy was active).

In those days in the Deep South, blacks would often face violence (and in rare cases, murder) because they defied the racial status quo.

The white perpetrators of said crimes would rarely, if ever, be brought to justice for their crimes against blacks because in the US almost all crimes are death with by states and most Southern states would willfully refuse to carry out the law. 

In response the federal government  enacted Hate Crime legislation that made Hate Crimes a federal offense. This distinction gave the federal government the authority to step in and bring the murderers / perpetrators to justice before a national court instead of a state court.

We're at least 20 years behind. 20 years ago homosexuality was classified as an illness or was illegal in many countries, we legalized it some 20 years ago, but our society still maintains many negative stereotypes (mainly, gays == pedophiles) that weren't prevalent in Western countries even 20 years ago.",0,1407712460,null,0,false,0,cjmlii5,t3_2d647f,t1_cjmlii5,t1_cjml40m,null,1435173095,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

The way Norway had handled their state finances ever since the war has been absolutely brilliant. The number one priority for politicians regardless of where they have been at the political spectrum has been to keep people working. That means that unemployment has always been low, even during recessions. The sovereign wealth fund is also going to help a lot during harder times.

true,ViscomteEcureuil,FRAN,France,"&gt; but our society still maintains many negative stereotypes (mainly, gays == pedophiles) that weren't prevalent in Western countries even 20 years ago.

Honestly, Western countries held that stuff to be true too. I think Britain used to force gays to be chemically castrated and to be placed in mental facilities until the 1980's

In the US, gay sex was illegal in many states until a supreme court decision in 2000-something ruled that those bans were unconstitutional.

I'm telling you man, attitudes with this issue can radically change

Edit: here's my hypothesis: respect for gays meets heavy resistance at first- but as long as the government allows freedom of expression, people begin to see gays as harmless. But even this changing of hearts and minds is slow to take root.

Then at some point, I suppose it's some sort of critical tipping point, a flood of respect for gays overtakes a society- I believe this happens as soon as gays feel generally safe to come out. At that point everyone will have at least one gay cousin, brother, sister, uncle, childhood friend or co-worker who is gay. Psychological studies have proven that once someone meets and socializes with a gay person, their attitudes towards gays radically change 180°- I have heard that this is called ""the Ellen Degeneres Effect"" (after the lovable [American comedian Ellen Degeneres](http://i.imgur.com/lj2X1Bb.jpg), who came out as a lesbian after she became America's sweetheart as a TV star.)

Personne dans ce fil n'a dit que 216 000 hommes avaient été violés. Tu as un problème de compréhension car tu déformes malhonnêtement nos propos depuis le début. Tu réfutes des positions que personne ne tient.

Regardons maintenant [les chiffres pour 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_the_United_States) :

*39,590 men and 164,240 women were victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault in 2008*.

Ceci inclus donc les agressions sexuelles ET les tentatives (qui ne sont pas comptées dans les études sur les prisonniers, dans ton rapport on parle de 165 500 viols et agressions sexuelles complets). Pour qu'il y ait autant de violences sexuelles envers les hommes qu'envers les femmes, il suffit que parmi les 216 000 agressions sexuelles et viols en prison, il y en ait 170 000 dont les hommes seraient victimes, soit 79%, ce qui est cohérent avec les taux mentionnés dans le rapport (86% des agressions sexuelles en prison ont des hommes pour victimes). CQFDTC.

Bref, comme le disait /u/Jacksambuck , *il y a des études américaines qui montrent que autant d'hommes que de femmes ont été violés les années précédentes*.

&gt;En ce qui concerne le Canada et la France. En France

Tes chiffres sur le Canada parlaient des agressions physiques et n'ont aucune raison d'être vraies pour la France. 

Ce que j'ai dit et que personne n'a réfuté : *Les hommes sont plus victimes de violences physiques, les femmes de violences verbales et sexuelles. Être un homme t'expose à tout autant de violence qu'être une femme.*

Maintenant, si tu pouvais formuler ne serait-ce qu'un seul argument contre des thèses que j'ai formulées, ça montrerait au moins que tu as compris ce dont on parle, mais je doute que tu en sois capable.

&gt;Pour revenir au point principal, que tu fuis tout comme ton ami lâche, la situation pénitentiaire aux Etats-Unis n'est pas comparable à celle du reste du monde.

Non, et on ne la compare pas d'ailleurs. La phrase d'origine était ""il y a des études américaines qui montrent que autant d'hommes que de femmes ont été violés les années précédentes"". Par contre, ça montre une fois de plus que le baratin féministe est très loin de la réalité.

I know the UK only decriminalized gay sex in the 80s, and I know the public there (and in the US, and in many other Western countries) basically thought that gays are mentally ill people who need to be treated.

But in ex-Soviet countries, there is a belief that gays are even worse than merely mentally ill, but that they are actively dangerous. Gays and pedophiles are seen as almost the same group of people, even well reflected in the fact that the derogatory terms for gays in Russian are all derived from ""pederast"". I think such opinions were uncommon in the West even 20 years ago, when homosexuality was just starting to become legal. From a quick search, I can see that a similar belief (that gay men are likely to want sexual relations with children) was popular in the US back in 1970. If so, we'd be some 40 years behind over here, and that is not encouraging.

One of the reason that Denmark might seem like a very densely populated country if you have not visited, is that the Danish state says that 95 % +- of the population lives in urban areas, but the Danish state is also saying that any village with 200 + people in it are urban area. even if these village has no shops.

Denmark is always been a agricultural land, the islands of Denmark are very fertile and so is the eastern part of the Jutland peninsular, the western part on the other hand has very poor soil for farming, it is practically just sand, while bad for wheat and so on. pigs on the other hand have no problems surviving in this type of area, and therefor the area is used for pig farming.
i found an article a couple of months ago, can't remember which year it was from but the 21st century atleast, in mentioned that Denmark is the nation that use most of its land area for agricultural purpose, over 50 % which is quite a lot, but it might have changed now.

The law is then portrayed as being non-discriminatory, the position essentially being that gay people can still do whatever they want, as long as they do not expose children to homosexuality in the public. That is a very skewed portrayal of the law, but one that people are more supportive of.

* have a record of significant mental illness (extreme depression, psychosis etc) are prohibited from obtaining or owning forearms

And people are required to spend a certain number of hours at a shooting range and must take gun safety courses, and pass a test in order to own most firearms (I think basic hunting rifles don't require the course)

Ora, questo non vuol dire, ovviamente, che qualsiasi comportamento orribile sia necessariamente causato da un malformazione/malattia, ma a quanto pare il ""sistema"" (inteso come carcere punitivo o rieducativo, comunque restrittivo anche per, almeno teoricamente, proteggere la comunità) NON si era affatto interessato, a quanto pare, di cercare ulteriori cause per il comportamento illegale/immorale... la ""soluzione"" prescritta era di frequentare un corso di ""12-step Sexaholics Anonymous"" (che per quanto trovo in rete, è una iniziativa basata sulla fede nell'esistenza di dio). 

Forse l'idea è che il comportamento ""immorale"" sarebbe stato corretto tramite l'insegnamento di comportamenti ""morali"" ..il che è discutibile in se, ma in questo caso non sarebbe proprio servito a nulla. In altri, forse, ma è ampiamente discutibile.

Il y a plusieurs solutions possibles :

1. Régulariser tous les sans papiers actuellement présents sur le territoire
2. Régulariser systématiquement tous les sans papiers, présents et futurs
3. N'en régulariser qu'une partie, et expulser tous les autres
4. N'en régulariser qu'une partie, mais n'expulser qu'une partie des autres (il reste donc des sans papiers installés durablement sur le territoire)

Ces solutions sont toutes discutables, mais la solution 4 a l'inconvénient majeur de créer des citoyens de seconde zone, les fameux ""sans papiers"", sur le territoire français. De prime abord on pourrait penser que la glorieuse République Française (Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité, faites résonner la marseillaise !) se refuserait a faire des citoyens de seconde zone, avec moins de droits que les autres, sur son territoire. Et pourtant c'est la solution retenue...

On ne peut pas expulser les enfants scolarisés, les vieux, les handicapés, les malades, les femmes seules, etc. Donc continuons la très juste politique actuelle, qui est d'expulser les hommes seuls en bonne santé, mais au moins régularisons les autres, si on accepte de les garder sur le territoire !

Pourquoi ne pas s'inspirer du modèle australien, qui est très généreux mais inflexible. Ils ont des quotas (immigration qualifiée, réfugiés, etc.), qui peuvent être réglés plus ou moins haut ou plus ou moins bas, mais qui une fois remplis ne débordent pas d'un cheveu. Les premiers immigrés ont quasiment tous les droits (sauf la citoyenneté, qu'ils ne peuvent acquérir qu'après quelques années), les autres aucun et sont systématiquement expulsés.

About the project: this small area is quite central and has stayed sort of under-developed. In fact, most Parisians have no reason to visit nor to go through it. Therefore all the new stores or restaurants have struggled and often quickly closed during the last five years. The clever idea of the guy is to open so many new places that people will be intrigued and will visit. Hence the need to get media attention. 

On social aspects: journalists ought to do their jobs better. It's already gentrified: it's very central and there are 5 subway stations and 6 lines within a few-minute walk... Very convenient. The population is socially mixed, because of the many ""social flats"" (HLM). Those won't go anywhere, and I'm happy with that btw. Just to be clear: I don't live in a social flat myself, I'm just in favor of social mixing.

So the social tensions are already there, and have been for quite a while. The happy few (like me) just can't bear (unlike me) having the a-bit-noisy teens and young adults staying in the streets at night. The fact is that they just don't have the money to go to bar like I do with my friends. Of course,  these teens are not angels and are sometimes quite annoying. But not dangerous, just immature.

If that rich guy had a true vision for the area, which implies a better understanding of the social context, he would have been searching a way to include something directed to these young guys. Obviously he doesn't care, nor does he care for the inhabitants of the area in general. I learnt about it through the media ; we know nothing more about the project than these articles. Everybody is happy about the new shops though, hoping for reasonable price. But there is really no reason it could be cheaper than in the ""rue de Bretagne"" a few hundred meters away.

So it going to be expensive. But that's true for all central Paris anyway. Living in Paris is too expensive: that is the real problem - pointing this project as gentrification and cause of inflated prices is just mediocre journalism, e.g. clichés instead of at least some level of investigation. 

By the way, every article in the last 1.5 year mentions the unclear source of that guy's wealth ; nobody has been looking into it but everybody is happy to write that easy story on the project: the guy has an efficient PR firm providing well-done press kits to the lazzy journalist.

The 1960 coup happened in part because US Marshall Plan aid was running out and Menderes was thinking about going to Moscow to ask for ""alternate lines of credit"" (taken verbatim from Wikipedia). The 1971 coup highly prioritized arresting and suppressing the left. The same can be said for the 1980 coup. The 71 and 80 coups were a result of political violence between the left and the right. The two parties that make up the Turkish opposition today are those same groups who clashed and were removed from power, the MHP (hard right nationalists) and the CHP (social democrats, leftists, kemalists). While the MHP incorporates elements of conservatism, they are pretty secular compared to the AKP. Read about operation gladio, the connections of the CIA to the Grey Wolves (militant arm of the MHP), and the political clashes and assassinations of the 60's and 70's. It's not a simple narrative of Islam vs. secularism. Inonu, the opposition leader at the time Menderes was tried and hung by the junta was opposed to the coup. Even if you can use this narrative to justify the 1960 coup, it was a watershed moment for Turkish religious conservatives and is at least a small part of the current conservative backlash. Also, one of the reasons that the culture of authoritarianism is so prevalent in Turkey today is because the military kept stepping in.

I think the ""gays = pedophiles"" prejudice is frequent in all kinds of homophobic cultures, and I believe it was prevalent in Western countries for pretty much all of the 20th century (and it continues to be sadly widespread).  Consider the infamous (and in its way, quaint) 1961 American PSA [*Boys Beware*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECilAeLLATc) whose very point is to spread that message.  This is half a century old, of course, but the point is, it is the archetype of the *form* of homophobia that persisted for a long time.

As recently as 2003, England had legislation known as [paragraph 28](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28) stating that a local authority ""shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality"" or ""promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship"".  This was the last sort of specifically anti-gay legislation that existed in the country, and it embodies precisely the sort of homophobia that you mention: the ""OK, maybe we don't need to make gay sex between adults illegal, but let's at least protect the children from ever hearing about it"" sort.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I think this is very much in line with the kind of homophobia that presently exists, say, in the Baltic states.

And in 1999, when the French parliament debated the legislation of civil unions that extended to same-sex couples, the same sort of argument kept popping up: ""same-sex couples will necessarily get adoption eventually, and we can't possibly let them near children"" (will all sorts of innuendos about what would happen: suggesting that at best they would make the children gay, and at worse they would rape them — it wasn't often made explicit, but it was very clearly understood).

I would tend to believe that the main difference between present-day Latvia and the UK or France 20 years ago is that it is much more difficult to avoid any form of exposure to the question of LGBT people (at least if you get the same American movies and sitcoms and have access to the same Internet as elsewhere ;-), whereas in the past the very existence of homosexuality has been completely invisible.  Of course, it's logically conceivable that hearing more about LGBT people will make homophobic people even more homophobic: but I have reasonable hope that the reverse effect is stronger, and that knowing more about something tends to make people less bigoted.",0,1407719752,null,0,false,0,cjmoltp,t3_2d647f,t1_cjmoltp,t1_cjmlii5,null,1435174608,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,BullBoxerBAB,null,null,"Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

Ich schreibe Ihnen in Bezug auf den Streik des Sicherheitspersonals und der Schließung des Frankfurter Flughafen am 21. und 22. Februar.
Diese Unannehmlichkeit hat meinem Ehemann und mir Zeit, Kraft und Geld gekostet. Ich wende mich an die Person, die dafür verantwortlich ist, dass Sie für unsere Schäden aufkommen. Im Anhang finden Sie die Hotelbuchungen, die wir versäumt haben, und die Flüge innerhalb der USA, die ich ändern musste und die uns letztendlich auch Geld gekostet haben. Im Flughafen waren wir gegenüber Ihnen höflich, respekt- und verständnissvoll, aber am Ende des Tages wurden wir NICHT mit der selben Art behandelt.

So, wie die Fluggesellschaft (Lufthansa) und der Flughafen (Frankfurt) die Situation gehandhabt haben, war es ziemlich lächerlich und vollkommen inakzeptabel. Ich kann die Tatsache, dass wir in der Warteschlange über 20 Stunden lang stehen mussten, nicht akzeptieren... DAS IST LÄCHERLICH! Um zur Sicherheitskontrolle zu kommen, haben wir 5 Stunden gewartet!! Es gab eine Warteschlange für Rollstuhlfahrer und Kinder. Es ist verständlich, dass sie zuerst an der Reihe sind. Aber nachdem Sie sie zwei Stunden lang vor uns hereingelassen haben, kamen Leute an die Reihe, die GERADE ERST aufgetaucht sind (einige sogar ohne Kinder/Rollstuhlfahrer). Um uns herum sind Leute in Ohnmacht gefallen, andere bettelten um Wasser. Es war eines der schrecklichsten Erfahrungen, die ich jemals durchgemacht habe.

Ich habe noch nie einen so schlechten Service von einer Fluggesellschaft erlebt. Man hat uns nicht über Essensgutscheine, Schlafmöglichkeiten, Duschen und hygienische Produkte informiert. Diese Dinge mussten wir erst von anderen Passagieren erfahren. Das Personal der Lufthansa war unhöflich und überhaupt nicht hilfreich. Man steht in der Warteschlange Stunden über Stunden und das Personal geht ohne einen Ersatz in die Mittagspause, das ist unglaublich. Schön, dass Sie Ihrem Personal während einer solchen Krise eine Pause von zwei Stunden geben. Nach zehn Stunden in der Warteschlange, hätte Ich jedenfalls sicher auch sehr gerne eine Pause gehabt. Am 21. standen wir für über 15 Stunden in der Warteschlange... und als wir endlich an der Reihe waren, haben die einfach gesagt, dass sie diesen Abend keine Flüge mehr buchen würden. Ist das Ihr Ernst???!!! Soetwas hätte man über den Lautsprecher ansagen können und das hätte mir sehr viel Zeit und SCHMERZEN erspart. Als ich mich endlich hinsetzen konnte, habe ich meine Schuhe ausgezogen und habe angefangen zu weinen. Ich stand über 10 STUNDEN in dieser Warteschlange!!! Für NICHTS!!.. nur, um gesagt zu bekommen, dass man heute nichts mehr für uns tun kann.

Am nächsten Morgen standen wir WIEDER 3 Stunden lang in der Warteschlange. Nur, um wieder gesagt zu bekommen, dass es nicht sicher ist, dass wir am selben Abend noch fliegen... wir wurden für einen Flug auf eine Warteliste gesetzt. Natürlich gab es für uns letztendlich keinen Platz mehr für diesen Flug nach New York, also mussten wir SCHON WIEDER in der Warteschlange stehen, um für den nächsten Flug auf die Warteliste gesetzt zu werden. Wir haben weitere 3 Stunden in einer anderen Warteschlange gestanden, nur um den Flug zu verpassen, auf dessen Warteliste wir gehofft haben, gesetzt zu werden. Als wir ENDLICH an der Reihe waren, wurden wir für den Flug am 23. gebucht. Wir versäumten im Voraus bezahlte Hotelreservierungen und waren gezwungen für unsere amerikanischen Inlandsflüge, die wir schon gebucht hatten, dazu zu bezahlen.

Wir wurden schlecht, respektlos und STARK belastend behandelt, wir saßen im Flughafen über 2 Tage lang fest und erlitten heftige Schmerzen, nachdem wir insgesamt über EINEN TAG in der Warteschlange standen!

Am Ende der Nacht vom 22. Februar waren meine Füße schmerzend, wund und angeschwollen. Der Schmerz war unerträglich. Ich musste zur Apotheke weiter außerhalb beim Flughafen gehen, um Medikamente zu bekommen. Ich habe nicht nur Recht auf volle Entschädigung aller zusätzlichen kosten, die wir zahlen mussten, sondern mein Ehemann und Ich erwarten für den ganzen Ärger noch etwas mehr, sowie eine Entschuldigung. Wir fliegen nur mit der Lufthansa, wenn wir international reisen, und halten immer in Frankfurt. Wir waren bisher treue Kunden und abhängig davon, wie unser Fall behandelt wird, sind wir VIELLEICHT dazu imstande, weiterhin treue Kunden zu bleiben. Ich bin dazu bereit, die Angelegenheit in meine eigenen Hände zu legen und rechtliche Schritte einzuleiten. Dennoch hoffe ich, dass die Fluggesellschaft und der Flughafen eher bereit sind mit uns direkt zu arbeiten, als die Sache auf die nächste Stufe zu bringen.

Im Anhang finden Sie Nachweise unserer Flüge von Beirut nach New York, unsere eigentlichen Hotelbuchungen in New York und Orlando (die zeigen, dass wir eine Nacht in New York und eine Nacht in Orlando versäumt haben), unseren eigentlichen Flug von New York nach Orlando und dann die zusätzlichen Kosten, die wir zahlen mussten, um unser Flugdatum zu ändern. Ich erwarte eine volle Entschädigung unserer zusätzlichen Kosten und Verluste.

Außerdem finden Sie im Anhang Fotos meiner Füße, einen Tag nachdem ich Deutschland verlassen habe. Sie sind verfärbt, angeschwollen, wund und adrig. Ich war nach einem Tag Stehen in der Warteschlange in heftigen Schmerzen. Ich erwarte eine Entschuldigung.

Ich erwarte eine zügige Antwort. Ich danke Ihnen im Voraus für Ihr Verständnis.

Vielen Dank

true,[deleted],null,null,"For anyone accusing the article of Russophobic scare mongering: since 2000 Russian military doctrine has subscribed to the notion that limited nuclear strikes may actually be a form of deterrent in a war against NATO. Their backassward logic is that if Russia uses tactical nukes on Europe and the US it will show us what the risks are and therefor we will back down. 

&gt; A 2011 study by the respected RAND Corporation came to much the same conclusion, stating that Russian doctrine explicitly recognizes the possibility of using nuclear weapons in response to conventional aggression.  Not only does Moscow see nuclear use as a potential escalatory option in a regional war, but it also envisions using nuclear weapons to de-escalate a conflict.  This isn’t just Russian saber-rattling.  The U.S. and its NATO partners too envision the possibility of nuclear use in a European war.  The Obama Administration had the opportunity to back away from such thinking in a 2010 Nuclear Posture Review, and instead decided it would retain forward-deployed nuclear weapons in Europe under a doctrine known as extended deterrence.  Eastern European nations that joined NATO after the Soviet collapse have been especially supportive of having U.S. nuclear weapons nearby.


It would be pretty hard for Obama to justify removing nuclear deterrence when Russian military doctrine explicitly states that Russia will escalate to nuclear strikes if it is conventionally overwhelmed by NATO in a regional war.

[Source: Four Ways The Ukraine Crisis Could Escalate To Use Of Nuclear Weapons]
(http://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2014/04/24/four-ways-the-ukraine-crisis-could-escalate-to-use-of-nuclear-weapons/)

&gt; In 2000, Russia had issued a new military doctrine whose main innovation was the concept of “de-escalation”—the idea that, if Russia were faced with a large-scale conventional attack that exceeded its capacity for defense, it might respond with a limited nuclear strike.

The question is what would constitute defense? If they invaded the Baltics and NATO counter attacked and overwhelmed Russians in the Baltic would that constitute defense in Russian minds? That's why Putin's nationalism is so acutely dangerous: there is no distinction between territories that have Russians in them and territories that are Russia. To be clear, the Japanese thought the same thing about Americans when they struck Pearl Harbor and that actually inspired the exact opposite response.

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"Common law isn't German law. Our legal system generally attempts to prevent something called ""Gesinnungsstrafrecht"", which is a legal system based primarily on evaluating and punishing the motivation for a crime, not the actual events of said crime. As you can easily discern from our history, we had a lovely time punishing people for their 'Gesinnung' (motivation). It's such a hazy concept that its essentially subjective and opens the door for arbitary punishments of any degree. By focusing on the events, a more objective evaluation of the crime can be done and more general rules applied.

This leads us to the fact that German law usually tries to be consistent and axiomatic from the bottom up, so it is natural that following a general principle of not favouring any gesinnung, we cannot do so even in cases where we would like to. 

If this disgusts you, so be it. But I am fairly glad we do not yet have any of the horribly 'hate crime' legislation, but not only for the aforementioned reasons. Why is it *less* damaging to split the skull of a person for monetary reasons than to do so for racial ones? Both are horrible acts of violence, and the state shouldn't somehow decide that one is less criminal than the other, which happens automatically if the other is *more* criminal by adding extra legislation. I'm content that our legal system does not try to be the moral judge of what c

On the gay marriage front: yes, it sucks. But we had openly gay politicans in some of the highest offices (though not a chancellor), and that was within a coalition with the conservatives. I think we need to wait for a long time before we see gay Republicans.

Laws do not equal the feeling on the street.

Edit: And as Svorky said, motivation of the criminal obviously gets evaluated, but AFAIK it is done individually and not put under one sweeping label which is then applied to the crime. This means that whereever our legal system already allows for looking at motivation within the context of specific points of evaluating the crime, then of course racial or sexual hate of the perpetrator can enter the equation.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I think there is a kernel of truth in the notion that if Russia used nukes it would be like calling MAD's bluff. Most people don't want to die so it would create enough apprehension to create some divisions especially if nukes were to detonate in one of the more obscure former Soviet republics in Eastern Europe. The question of whether it would be enough of a division to stop a retaliation is less clear. Clearly the stakes would be huge and I think most Americans would back a response. Even if most of the people were against it, the government would understand the stakes of backing down and thus destroying nuclear deterrence and would most likely hit Russia with an equally if not more devastating nuclear strike. Either way it is a huge gamble on his part.

There is something to be said about him believing:  

&gt; Under those circumstances, Putin clearly assumes, many in the US would oppose responding. “All progressive and even all reactionary American society” would shout “’We do not want to die for f****** Narva, Mr. President!’” 


It is true: people do not want to die for ""fucking Narva"". I could see Putin making a huge bet that using tactical nukes in obscure areas of Eastern Europe would make Western publics so anxious about dying in nuclear war that they would consider backing down. I don't necessarily think that it is a smart bet, but I don't think it is beyond the scope of Putin's imagination if push came to shove.

When WWI started, we got embargoed by both sides, i.e. all of our neighbors, save Liechtenstein. We declared neutrality. In WWII, Hitler and Mussolini controlled [everything](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) around us. We remained neutral. 

I feel like some people have a hard time grasping the concept of neutrality. Not being on one side of a conflict, doesn't automatically put a country on the other side. Switzerland acts as a mediator in many international conflicts. One of which is between Russia and Ukraine. You can't pick sides in a conflict, in which you try to mediate.

This isn't just Joe Schmoe on the street, this goes all the way up to national media and government. I don't care if they like Americans or not, I just would like to see them be honest for once in their lives and say, ""Yes, I'm a bigot because I hate Americans simply because they're Americans."" Let's also get something else straight: they do it with Italians as well, particularly Scandinavians. For as arrogant as people claim Americans to be with their ignorance about the rest of the world, northern Europeans are just as arrogant and ignorant with their opinions about Americans as well as Italians. They go on the internet and read a few news stories and all of a sudden they know EXACTLY what Americans are like. They do it with Italians, too. They're incredibly arrogant and crass when interacting with other EU states like Italy. ""Why can't you be more like us?"" Well, maybe because you have 9 million people in your entire country, which is about the population of just Lazio. ""Why can't you pay your debts? Look at us, we have a better country."" Well, yes, but there's also nothing in your country. There's more history in a single block of any Italian city than in their entire country, and who's going to pay for that? We do. 2000-year-old architecture is expensive, yet they don't see that. They just see ITALYBERLUSCONIRECESSIONMANDOLINOPIZZAMAFIA.

Italians don't do this. They may not like the American military presence in Italy (and who could blame them?), but they're not anti-American. Anti-Americanism is simply tolerated bigotry and Italians don't waste negativity on anything for no reason. Of course you have the punkabbestie and the communists who live with their parents until they're 40 and drive their parents' BMW (who, by the way, usually own a company, are wealthy, and are capitalists), and claim to hate the US, particularly in the north. But these people don't even count because not even other Italians take them seriously and they're a joke even in Italy.

&gt;__Sitges__ (Catalan pronunciation: [ˈsidʒəs]) is a town about 35 kilometres southwest of [Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona), renowned worldwide for its [Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitges_Film_Festival) and [Carnival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival). Located between the [Garraf Massif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garraf_Massif) and the sea, it is known for its beaches, nightspots, and historical sites.

&gt;While the roots of Sitges' artsy reputation date back to the late 19th century, when Spanish painter [Santiago Rusiñol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Rusi%C3%B1ol) took up residence there during the summer, the town became a centre for the 1960s [counterculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture) in mainland Spain, then still under the [dictatorship of Francisco Franco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_under_Franco), and became known as ""[Ibiza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibiza) in miniature"".

&gt;Nowadays it is a popular destination for gay and lesbian travellers, as it has become one of the most gay-friendly places in the world.

That's because most of these cities are old. Rome was founded over a thousand years *before* the beginning of medieval age. Paris or London have existed for *two thousand* years. The Westminster Abbey in London was already *700 years* old then the US declared independence. And most of these cities have been major cities for a long time. There is so much history that the cities want to preserve the history. The cities you mentioned mostly are young and haven't been large cities, so there isn't much history to preserve.

I would also guess that building skyscrapers was originally (some hundred years ago) more an American architectural thing (with New York and Chicago competing with them), and European nations were not that much interested in that. Just like art deco was mainly an American thing. The heritage of skyscrapers lives on in the US while in Europe has a heritage of old cities with church towers. I myself have wondered why do American cities like Providence even have skyscrapers, when the city isn't that big?

It's not about lack of development but rather a different focus in development. In many cities, the skyscrapers are build some distance away from the older city. [Like in Paris](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Paris_Night.jpg) you can see that the older city with the Eiffel Tower is rather low rise and the skyscrapers are far away behind the Eiffel Tower. So in some cities it is hard to get photo of both the old city and the new skyscrapers in the same picture. Or [this photo of Tallinn](http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/24787891.jpg) where you can see the high rise buildings being far in the left away from the old city with churches at the right (and the building codes limit that skyscrapers cannot be higher than the highest tower in the old town).

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Russia using nukes tactically is an interesting scenario. If they used nukes to establish material and manpower superiority in the Baltics, NATO could, of course, respond with tactical nukes against their Baltic positions. 

Russia wouldn't need to use nukes in Baltics. They already have material and manpower superiority. What they don't have is air superiority. What NATO would need to provide at the first stages would be...

* Air superiority in Baltics and Poland. Striking against Russian convoys and positions. The Baltic armies could then have a fighting chance.
* Start siege of Kaliningrad and in case Russia would threathen or use nuclear weapons, threaten to do the same with Kaliningrad.
* Start rapid and heavily mobile operations where NATO troops together with air force strike deep to Russian targets and then quickly move away.
* Start to move heavy weapons toward Poland and other eastern countries.

What you have to understand that defending NATO against Russia would be fought from Northernmost parts of Norway to Black Sea. NATO response could then be for example usage of nuclear weapons in Transnistria to wipe out old Soviet weapon deposits.

Like the ones caused by the pacification of the Litzmanstadt Ghetto? Mmm, it's always refreshing to see a foreginer praising a Polish city. After that I always expect to hear ""Pity it's not ours anymore"" (and yes, Poles do the same with Wilno and Lwow).

&gt;Poland defines itself so much as Catholic that they made a concordat with the Vatican in the 90s. This concordat was drawn up before the actual current constitution and basically anchors the Catholic church into Polish society.

Not really, the concordat actually limits the influence os an organization that otherwise would be all powerful - pity that neither side actually respects it.

&gt;. Still, Polish people see themselves as Catholic, even though a lot of them disagree with the actual teachings of the Church

Well, I define myself as an agnostic, but I'm still a Catholic, after all I haven't stopped being Polish. In Poland religion has always been a path to freedom, and I support Catholic Church in many attempts, even though I think it should stay the fuck out of politics, healthcare, education, public services...

&gt;lest you'd be disallowed a Christian marriage.

Why would you *want* a catholic wedding if you're not a Christian? The concordate means that the church wedding is legally binding as the state wedding (which is the main reason people accept it), but it doesn't mean that atheist weddings are banned. Westerners keep baffling me.

&gt;On the other hand they hate Russia. Not the Russians themselves really, but the idea of Russia.

What is 'the idea of Russia'? Any kind of imperialism is never welcomed in a former province of the empire, especially in one that defines itself by desire for national sovereignity. By that definition Poles also hate 'the idea of Germany', and the modern incarnation of Greater Germany, namely European Union.

&gt; It turns out that every statement any German politician says to the international press is somehow connected to our plans for a new Grossdeutsches Reich. 

Is that not true that just twenty years ago in Germany there were published maps with areas that Poland recovered after WWII marked as ""German, under Polish occupation""? Is that not true that there are ogranizations devoted to recovering their land in East Prussia and joining it to Germany?

Russians changed, but sadly for the worse. Germans didn't, they just mask their greed and hate better.

&gt; then its perfectly reasonable to make Polish Germans suffer for it. Because, you know, them being Polish citizens living in Poland they have so much to do with Germany.

They are Germans living in Poland. History has proven that they could be dangerous for Polish citizens and Polish national sovereignity.

&gt;Despite the Catholic crazies shouting the loudest its a modern country.

Self righteousness? This whole thread is just an anti-Switzerland circle jerk and you just accused us of being as bad as the collaborators in WWII. I'm just trying to offer a different view here.

&gt;The Swiss have always made money off their neutrality.

Long term, yes. Just as any other country would have profited in not having a war fought on your territory. Declaring neutrality in both world wars was ballsy as fuck and not at all a guarantee for profit later on. In WWI, both Germany and France could have decided to invade Switzerland in order to flank the enemy. In WWII, Hitler had plans to invade Switzerland, in order to have an easier connection between Germany and Italy. Luckily, he decided to go invade Russia first.

Neutrality is a principle, the Swiss held on to, when the front was literally on their door step. And I'm sorry for the Ukranians, but they're not going to let go of it now.

/u/doomblackdeath wrote
&gt;As a fellow American and veteran who has been living in Italy since 2003 (and loving it), I have to say that everything here is 100% true and valid.
Now, listen carefully because I'm going to help you out big time.
I got out of the Air Force in Aviano around 2005 and have been living in Italy since then as a resident alien. My wife is Italian and we have a house here in the mountains in the north. I speak Italian fluently (with a few mistakes every now and then) and all my friends are Italian; in fact, I don't even have any American friends here anymore. I chose to stay because I wanted a good life and wasn't worried about a career. You will have a better life here than in the states, but it comes at the expense of your career. You can either have a good life in Italy or you can have a good career somewhere else, you can't have both while living in Italy. This permeates everything about Italian life. You cannot buy a better life in Italy like you can in the states. On the flip side, your life here will still be better than that which you could buy in the states IF you adapt to the Italian way of life.
Firstly, forget everything you think you know about Italy or Italians. Everything. Italians don't live in the US, their great-grandparents just moved there a century ago. Everything that you think you know about Italy from what you've garnered during your life as an American is wrong. Not only is it wrong, it's often ignorant. Everything from food to the language to the character of Italian people is wrong in the US. EVERYTHING. Ok, still with me? Good.
Since you're Army, you're going to have some hurdles to overcome. Fortunately for you, Italians are really cool people and actually like Americans, even if we annoy them sometimes. Italians and Americans actually have a lot in common, believe it or not. That said, the attitude towards Americans in Vicenza is drastically different from the attitude towards them in, say, Aviano. This is mainly because, quite frankly, Army guys tend to act like meatheads and a rotten few manage to spoil it for the whole bunch. You will have to prove yourself to the locals, but lucky for you, Italians tend to judge people individually, unlike practically everyone else on the European continent. This is where you will find you sort of have a kinship with Italians: Europeans are dicks to Italians and Americans, and that will sorta bring you closer together. It's like, ""Hey, they hate you too? Great, let's be friends. Fuck those guys."" You will soon find out that European racism and bigotry is extremely frowned upon unless it's anti-Americanism, then it's ok. The only exception I've found is in Italy. Like I said, they tend to judge people individually. There's still racism and bigotry here too, but anti-Americanism doesn't go all the way up to Rai like it does in the BBC. This goes all the way up to national media in Europe. That said, you can improve your chances ten-fold by learning the language, and that brings me to my next point.
Don't memorize a few words and hope to get by. LEARN THE FRIGGIN' LANGUAGE. Take a college course on base/post and learn the basics like I did, and then just go out into the world and socialize. Embarrass yourself with your bad Italian. Ask questions. Talk to everyone you can. LISTEN. Why? Because when an Italian realizes you have put forth the effort to learn HIS language in just the short amount of time you're here, he will bend over backwards to help you in any way he can. You won't enjoy your stay in Italy if you hang around Americans, plain and simple.
The older Italians won't speak any English, but everyone under the age of 30 speaks English quite well, at least in the north. Veneto and Friuli are the two regions with the most Americans due to Aviano and Vicenza, but get Italian friends and speak their language. It will open doors for you you never would have known existed and you will see the world in a completely new light. It had such an impact on me that I decided to stay in Italy instead of returning back to the states after I separated. It's like seeing in color instead of black and white.
Continuing on...
MAKE ITALIAN FRIENDS. This is of utmost importance and I cannot stress this enough.
Also, remember that living in Italy isn't like visiting Italy. Italy is a pain in the ass sometimes, but the bureaucracy isn't really as bad as you think. It's definitely worse than the states, but people who go on and on about how much of a pain in the ass Italy is have never been to Spain, Portugal, Greece, or South America. What's more, you will find that it's THE ARMY or THE AIR FORCE that complicates things for you rather than smoothing the transition. Wait until you start house hunting, you'll see what I mean. They simply get in the way, but you're forced to go through them due to the SOFA.
Lastly, Italy is not about making your life as comfortable as possible. In the states, we make up for our lack of anything truly interesting with extreme convenience and ease of everything. Why? Because without those things, there's nothing left. Italy is not like this. Italy has other shit to worry about, like keeping up funding for being the cultural epicenter of the universe. Sometimes it's just not feasible to do things like you're used to doing them back home because, well, you're not back home. Don't be that whiny American who's like, ""Well back in the states it's like this..."" because you're not in the states and no one cares.
One more thing: FOOD. There is no fettuccine alfredo, spaghetti and meatballs, or chicken parmesan in Italy. Those are American dishes. Leave them in America. The reason why they don't exist here is because Italian food is a science more than an art; there is a reason why certain things go together and others don't. Another thing, don't call bruschetta ""brooshedda"". It's ""broo skeTTA"". Pronounce the K, accent the Ts. I don't know why, but everywhere in the US these days people are nuts about bruschetta and polenta. Polenta is grits where I'm from down south in Louisiana, and just like where I'm from, it's a poor man's food also in Italy. Eat it with frico, muset, stracchino, or formaggio salato, but don't try to make it all fancy like they do back home. It's not a fancy food.
Ok, one more and I promise I'm done. Italians differ in each region, and even in each city. They speak different dialects and some may not even speak proper Italian. This is very common in Veneto where you're going. Whatever bullshit language you picked up from so-called Italians back in the states, forget it. Also, don't say shit like ""fuggetabboutit"" or ""gabbagool"" or ""fangool"" or some such nonsense you see on tv. That stuff is to Italian what Spam is to meat.
Also, Northern Italy is a world away from southern Italy and they share almost nothing in common.
Another thing, if you happen to have Italian ancestry, you're still not Italian. If you can't speak the language and don't know the culture, you're not Italian. Don't go around saying, ""I'm Italian/Scot/Irish/German"" unless you speak the language and/or grew up in those places. I can't tell you how many annoying tourists I meet every year whose friend back in Jersey, Joey Bananas, told them to say something in Italian and now all of a sudden they think they're Italian and have to make a pilgrimage to the ""motherland"". They're just gonna sell you overpriced shit and make fun of you behind your back. Also, Americans like to prance around with wine glasses in their hands, waxing intellectual about nonsense in order to impress ignorant people who don't know any better. In Italy, you drink wine in whatever glass is available, especially at lunch. A nice wine deserves a nice glass but those are for special occasions. Wine is like water here. We drink it out of plastic cups at sagre (festivals). No wine connoisseur douchebaggery...you'll just get a bunch of eye rolls.
As for your car, I would actually just get a local used car here. You can ship your car here but unless you have a really nice muscle car, just get a cheap used car here. Also, public transportation in Italy is certainly better than the crap we have back in the states, but it's miles away from places like Germany. Not a good idea to depend solely on trains and buses. Ride a bike if you can but it's not like the Netherlands, where bicyclists are revered. They're simply tolerated here in Italy.
I love Italy. It frustrates me to no end sometimes but I've never seen a place so wonderfully beautiful. It's so beautiful that it really does balance out all the nonsense. People ask me about it all the time, and I tell them that if they like Wal-Mart and 24-hour convenience stores with Taco Bell at midnight, they're not gonna like Italy. Whenever you go back to the states, you'll see just how DULL living in the states really is. This is why we pour ourselves into our careers because it's all we have. That said, working in the states is eons better than working in Italy. The post-war generation of Italians are running government and industry and they have totally run it into the ground. Italians do not know how to manage anything, how to organize anything, or how to deal with change. This is simply a fact, no generalization at all. It's because of the old mentality of the people in charge in Italy and their refusal to make room for the younger generation who desperately want change. Once you accept this as fact and that this will not change until they die, you will enjoy life in Italy much more and won't let the frustrations get to you. Have fun and good luck.

Not London and not Paris, of course.”

Basically the article is saying that Putin is thinking about an ""!open war!"" with NATO (wtf!!) and that NATO would have conventional superiority in a limited war. So he would ""drop nukes on European capitals"", killing millions!! and the war would stop and he would ""win"".

I really don't know what to say. This sound completely nuts. And a very, very dangerous calculation as well. What is keeping NATO from a game of ""tit for tat"" and killing a couple million Russians as well as targeting all their nuclear arsenal as best as possible? Or something else? This could very easily escalate into WWIII. For Europe, it would already be WWIII if they actually killed millions with nuclear bombs.

Le mois d'octobre. Les taquerias. Commerces ouverts le dimanche, journée continue dans les restaurants. Quasiment pas de grèves. Bonne ambiance au boulot en général. Moins de bureaucratie. Des toilettes propres, de taille correcte, et pas ""à la turque"".

**Points négatifs**: Les strip malls, les big box stores, c'est moche. Transports en communs indécents. Plein de gaspillage, des montagnes de déchets. Écoles publiques pas terribles voire carrément mauvaises selon la ville. Docteurs chers même si assuré. La mer est super froide, quasiment pas possible de se baigner. Le système de mesures.

This interview from 1997 doesn't really deviate from that. At that point he'd already declared jihad on the United states - their military and specifically their civilians for what he referred to as ""the occupation of muslim lands"". 

&gt;This is because the name of the American government and the name of Clinton and Bush directly reflect in our minds the picture of children with their heads cut off before even reaching one year of age. It reflects the picture of children with their hands cut off, the picture of the children who died in Iraq, the picture of the hands of the Isrealis with weapons destroying our children. The hearts of Muslims are filled with hatred towards the United States of America and the American president The President has a heart that knows no words. A heart that kills hundreds of children definitely, knows no words. Our people in the Arabian Peninsula will sent him messages with no words because he does not know any words. If there is a message that I may send through you, then it is a message I address to the mothers of the American troops who came here with their military uniform walking proudly up and down our land while the scholars of our country are thrown in prisons. I say that this represents an a blatant provocation to 1,250 million Muslims. **To these mothers I say if they are concerned for their sons, then let them object to the American government's policy and to the American president. Do not let themselves be cheated by his standing before the bodies of the killed soldiers describing the freedom fighters in Saudi Arabia as terrorists. It is he who is a terrorist who pushed their sons into this for the sake of the Isreali interest. We believe that the American army in Saudi Arabia came to separate between the Muslims and the people for not ruling in accordance with Allah's wish. They came to be in support of the Israeli forces in occupied Palestine, the land of the ""Israa"" of our Prophet (PBUH).

    INDONESIE

**Bons points**: Le climat, la richesse obscène dont tu disposes en tant qu'expat. Le pays est assez important pour que tu puisses trouver certains produits français en cas de mal du pays. Si tu te méfies des standards d'hygiène alimentaire indonésiens (et en 1998, il fallait s'en méfier...) l'Australie toute proche produit énormément de viande et d'oeufs à l'export. Les gens sont hyper conscients politiquement et attachés à leur démocratie après 30 ans de dictature. Le pays est magnifique, les femmes sont splendides. Il y a assez d'histoire et de culture pour occuper toutes les vacances scolaires (si tu as des enfants) et tous tes week-ends (si tu n'en as pas) pour des années. 

**Mauvais points**: Le climat chaud et humide donne naissance à d'énormes insectes, le genre qu'il vaut mieux négocier un traité de paix avec que de les écraser. Dans les villes plus petites, il y a serpents, varans, termites, blattes, rats... La culture est un peu difficile à comprendre pour un occidental. La corruption est une réalité. Bali est devenu l'Ibiza asiatique, avec des touristes australiens bourrés en lieu et place de touristes anglais bourrés.

**Bons points**: Les Britanniques sont plus abordables que les Français, particulièrement les Ecossais. Ils ont une ardeur au boulot impressionnante. Ils savent boire des coups, savent faire la fête, et la rivalité amicale entre Anglais et Français est toujours marrante à entretenir. Les Highlands et les îles écossaises donnent un sentiment de pays perdu au bout du monde, hors du temps, fascinant. Conduire entre Ullapool et Lochinver en fin de journée est limite une expérience onirique.

**Mauvais points**: J'ai toujours ressenti chez les Britanniques une espèce de mélancolie décliniste, un peu comme en France mais en pire.

They're brutally honest with themselves and I wish more people had this trait. I like that there's no ""proud to be Italian"" and instead there's a ""proud to be Roman/Venetian/Furlan/Milanese (although I wonder why)/Napolitano/Sicialiano/etc. They identify with their culture, not their nationality. This is great because there's virtually zero blind nationalism in Italy today because of this.

Viele Männer dort glauben, dass eine Frau ihren Job - warum auch immer - nicht machen könnte. Könnte mir vorstellen, dass Männer glauben, Frauen seien nicht so verhandlungssicher mit Geschäftspartnern oder ähnliches. 

2. Viele Frauen möchten Kinder kriegen und dann muss man eben für solch einen Zeitraum einen Ersatz finden und das ist natürlich der Untergang der Welt weil die Firma dann Mutterschaftsgeld zahlen muss und im Endeffekt zwei Mal Mitarbeiter finden muss und nicht nur ein mal. Und eine Frau kann ja ""immer"" schwanger werden kann und dann muss man ganz plötzlich neue Mitarbeiter finden 

&gt; was ist mit den ""unbeliebten"" Berufen wie Müllermänner, Schornsteinfeger, Toiletten Installteur.... wieso werden diese Berufe nicht von Frauen gemacht zumindest die Arbeitsstatistik zeigt in den Berufen einen Männeranteil von über 95%

Putzkräfte &amp; soziale Berufe (Altenpflege, soziale Arbeit, Erzieher) sind fast ausschließlich von Frauen besetzt. Und diese sind weder sozial höher angesehen noch monetär besser gestellt als die Berufe, die du genannt hast (die übrigens körperlich ganz schon anspruchsvoll sind und wahrscheinlich auch deshalb eher von Männern ausgeübt werden).

Arbeitslosigkeit ist bei Frauen dadurch niedriger, dass Frauen a) sozialer als Männer sind (mehr und häufigere Kontakte -&gt; größere soziale Integration -&gt; weniger Anfällig für Arbeitslosigkeit) und b) dadurch bedingt auch bessere social skills haben. Das gilt natürlich nur im Allgemeinen und es gibt genug Gegenbeispiele für beides.

true,CreepyOctopus,LATV,Latvia | Sweden,"I am not entirely sure the US would want to intervene should Russia attack Estonia or Latvia.

Say Russia does a smart invasion. They just don't roll in with tanks out of nowhere. Instead they move in during mass protests, to ""protect the Russian minority"", and they quickly seize significant control of the two countries. Just like Crimea, the largest military bases are surrounded and blockaded by armoured units, and special forces show up at strategic locations such as airports. Keep in mind that our countries have less military than Ukraine had in Crimea, and that our air defence is so poor that Russia could deploy a number of troops by helicopter without even being detected.

Russia would then be able to gain considerable success before any political decision could be made anywhere. The Baltics are desperately calling for help from all their NATO and EU allies. And then US leadership has to make a decision. In order to do something, they have to commit to a real shooting war with Russia, to engaging their front-line troops. Something that no country has wanted to do, and of course the US would recognize that the Russian military is far superior to Saddam's military or any other force the US has fought recently. The US is of course stronger, but Russia is a strong enough opponent that US casualties would be inevitable.

Soldiers dying is never popular, and then consider that the American population is war weary. After Afghanistan and Iraq, potential American intervention in Syria was unpopular, and that was surely easier to sell to the population than the defence of some small Baltic countries. When most Americans haven't even heard, understandably, of Narva and Daugavpils, there will be little desire to fight there. When the Crimean annexation was ongoing, [a poll showed 21% of Americans](http://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/04/02/americans-if-russia-attacks-defend-britain-not-ukr/) who supported sending troops to defend Latvia in case of a Russian attack.

##**The educational system is flawed from the ground up.**

&amp;nbsp;

* The children have to assimilate an enormous amount of information in the span of their first 8 years. It gets somewhat easier once you're in high school but by then you're already years behind on your curriculum.

* The students are not taught why the required curriculum is necessary for their future nor what it's practical uses are. It's always about ""this is the problem and this is how you solve it"" and never about ""why should I solve the problem"" or ""why does the problem need solving"". It's a very 'within-the-box' thinking.

* Physical education is not taken as serious as it should. The programme usually allows for 1 hour of physical education per week but in the past even this has been done half-assed and seen by the kids as a ""free hour in school"". There have been some improvements in recent years (in the main cities anyway) but 1 hour a week is *clearly* not enough. We used to have so much sportive talent in our country.

* We have a schedule made up of 6 hours of Mathematics and 5 hours of Romanian Language and Literature. How are the students supposed to assimilate so much information? And don't even get me started on the 32 hours of school per week schedule beginning with the 5th grade when the children are barely 11-12 years old. It's almost as if it's a full-time job.

Firstmost, propaganda doesn't just create dissent out of thin air. It leverages dissent that already was there. It's an amplifier, not a creator. 

&gt; So libel, incitement to violence, publishing sensitive information should be legal? 

I am a strong opponent of libel laws, for they make free speech dependant on wheter or not the speaker can afford the lawyer. incitement of violence is a crime and should be punished personally and individually, not by shutting down a medium. And publishing sensitive information is absolutely OK in my book - we can't cheer on Snowden and Assange and at the same time become angry if some letter from our state ministry of whatever gets published. 

&gt; Or all such laws undemocratic compared to the purest form of democracy, which is a violent overthrow of a government by a minority.

If your human rights are infriged, as, for example, your right to citizenship and voting rights, then yes, a violent overthrow of a government by a minority is acceptable. OF course that might lead to the state breaking apart.

That is, by the way, exactly what we saw at Euromaidan and in what happened afterwards. A small pro-european group violently overthrew a democratically-elected government and now they get their part of the country.",1,1407752494,null,0,false,0,cjmz118,t3_2d7rdm,t1_cjmz118,t1_cjmys1l,null,1435179585,-7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-7

Somewhat offtopic: I can already see the headlines if she goes to UK and does something stupid ""Look what this Romanian super model did to UK"" or if she becomes the worlds best super model ""Canadian living in UK becomes best world supermodel"".

On parle de sans-papiers, pas d'immigrants légaux. La question n'est pas de savoir si on doit fixer un quota ou non d'immigrants, mais plutôt de savoir s'il faut régulariser (""donner des papiers"") des individus illégalement entrés en France.

Donc cela n'a rien à voir et tu parles de deux leviers différents : (1) comment tu permets l'immigration, fixe un système d'intégration, etc. (quotas ou pas quotas ? droit du sol ou autres façons d'obtenir la nationalité ? etc) et (2) le traitement réservé à ceux qui entrent illégalement malgré ces règles. Les deux sont pensés en parallèle, bien entendu, mais ce dont tu parles avec l'Australie c'est la combinaison ""quotas d'immigrés"" + ""expulsion systématique"" (donc aucune régularisation). 

En France nous ne créons pas de ""citoyen de seconde zone"" : les individus sur notre territoire en situation illégale ne sont pas considérés comme des citoyens de la République, c'est tout. Lorsqu'ils sont enfermés dans des Centres de Rétention Administratif, qu'ils bossent pour un salaire inférieur au minimum légal ou qu'ils vivent dans des bidonvilles, ils sont dans une zone grise en termes de statut j'imagine.

Le système ""expulsons systématiquement les étrangers en situation illégale"", c'est la solution la plus brutale. J'ai pas de jugement là-dessus, mais si c'est effectivement ce qu'il se passe en Australie, on est cent fois plus coulant qu'eux.

Dans l'ensemble la vie est tres agreable et pas forcement tres chere. L'été il est possible de beaucoup voyager, entre pays voisins, festivals et concerts exterieurs.

**Les moins** ; La bouffe, on peut trouver des bonnes choses mais le choix est limité. Certains produits, comme la bonne viande, sont difficiles à trouver. Et la langue, parce que si ca parle pas trop mal Anglais, il est parfois difficile de se merderder sans Allemand.


* Amsterdam

**Les plus** : Tout le monde parle anglais, l'etat d'esprit est absolument génial - le total opposé de la france, en gros - , tout est dans le pragmatisme et l'honneteté, les coups de putes et l'hypôcrisie à la Francaise sont loin ... loin ... si quelqu'un a un probleme avec vous il vous ignorera ou vous confrontera directement. Bien entendu si on est gay/fumeur/ce genre de trucs, vivre ici est beaucoup plus agreable et moins stressant qu'en france, les Flics sont pas là pour faire plaisir aux fascistes paranos, et s'occupent uniquement de taches serieuses, aucun controle au facies.  Dans l'ensemble la seule regle du pays est ""faites ce que vous voulez tant que vous n'embetez personne"". Le pays est également plein d'opportunités et de rencontre, si vous voulez vous expatrier qques mois ou un an pour vous faire des contacts, Amsterdam convient tres bien. Pas mal de boulots si vous etes motivés et n'avez pas peur de galerer un peu au début, possibilité de trouver des tafs intéressants et bien payés.

**Les moins** : La bouffe, pareil qu'en autriche, voire plus grasse et moins interessante. La culture musicale est souvent assez bof aussi ... La vie est egalement assez chere, et l'hiver peut etre plutot rude, entre manque de soleil et temps de merde, en plus des sorties le samedi soir sous la pluie et le vent ... en velo ...

Je pense que l'exemple le plus clair que j'aie n'est pas tiré de mes expériences d'expat, mais de ce qui est arrivé à une amie proche qui est partie bosser à Londres fin 2012. Boulot de bureau pour une agence de marketing, beaucoup de stats, bref. 

Boulot sympa et belle ambiance pendant un moment, jusqu'à ce qu'on lui dise ""Ah, au fait, tu vas bosser à Manchester les mardis, mercredis et jeudis maintenant, ok?"" Pas de mot à dire, pas d'avis à demander, on lui dit de faire l'aller-retour, point. Bon, c'est pas comme si ça n'arrivait pas ici, et c'est un challenge qu'elle aime bien, elle accepte mais est un peu refroidie.

Courant 2013, son entreprise a moins d'activité, il faut virer des gens. Les indemnités de chômage sont pas hyper élevées en UK, mais au lieu de les payer, ils ont choisi de pousser les gens à la porte. Dont mon amie, qui a vu son poste vidé et toutes ses attributions filées à une autre collègue, et les 2 managers de la boîte ont dit de manière informelle à tous ses collégues: ""Tu sais, H., elle est sur le départ. Ca serait... pas très *corporate* de lui donner trop d'informations, au cas ou elle part chez un concurrent. Essaie de pas trop t'afficher avec elle, *tu voiiiiis*...""

Elle a passé plusieurs semaines à arriver, passer des jours et repartir à ne rien faire dans un silence de mort. Elle a voulu tenir bon et les forcer à la virer (plus pour les emmerder qu'autre chose) ce qu'ils ont fini par faire en lui disant qu'elle avait fait de l'excellent travail, un atout pour l'entreprise etc... Avec le sourire :) Quand elle est sortie de l'entretien, son bureau avait été vidé et le carton l'attendait dans le hall d'entrée.

Je trouve que même les Américains sont plus solidaires que ça. Les managers ricains peuvent avoir les mêmes méthodes, mais il y a un sentiment d'entraide entre collègues beaucoup plus fort chez eux, en général.

Je crois que c'est même l'essence de Reddit : présenter des trucs. :) Par contre, ce n'est pas un mur à spams ; les gens peuvent réagir. 

Personnellement, je trouve cette vidéo peu intéressante, tirée par les cheveux et simpliste. Je préfère de loin les BD féministes ou permettant d'alerter sur des problèmes vécus par les femmes, plutôt que trois-quatre clichés sur les femmes (que beaucoup combattent déjà), une bonne dose de moralisme, une animation à améliorer, et surtout une grosse incitation à l'abonnement. 

**Sur le fond**

On sent la facilité, et l'idée de mettre côte à côte des clichés (menstruations), des dénonciations (le corps des femmes sur Internet) et des comportements/attitudes sexistes (drague par exemple). En les dénonçant par des biais n'ayant parfois rien à voir : inversion des rapports (pour la drague) par exemple... et puis du second degré/de la caricature de cliché pour les règles (j'ai l'impression ; c'est pas clair).

J'ai pas compris le truc sur les règles en fait : c'est pour dénoncer le cliché sur le fait que les femmes soient énervées lors de leurs menstruations ou c'est pour qu'on respecte la douleur/les changements d'humeurs de *certaines* femmes durant celles-ci ?

Bref, la vidéo politique/idéologique, engagée, au même titre que le discours ou la BD sur ce genre de sujets est assez délicate à manier. Ce n'est pas parce qu'on se met du côté du Bien (telle ou telle prise de position qu'on estime juste) qu'on doit passer par la facilité. Oui, la drague de rue c'est lourdingue et les femmes à poil sur Internet ça abuse. C'est très simple comme sentiment, de se sentir énervé par ça. Par contre, traiter ces sujets demande un boulot de fond parfois, et de bosser sur l'argumentation, la rhétorique un minimum (comment dénoncer ? Par quels biais ? etc)

Dans certains cas, la lutte contre les clichés renvoie à d'autres clichés : sur la malbouffe par exemple. Est-ce que ça signifie que les femmes se nourrissent mieux ? Ou que contrairement à ce qu'on croit, les femmes ne sont pas adeptes de nourriture plus saine, et mangent de la malbouffe ""comme les hommes"" ? Idem pour la scénette sur la télévision.

Est-ce que dans la scénette ""il n'y aura plus de ligne flou"", on est dans la dénonciation directe (et la volonté d'interdire ce genre de vidéos) ou autre chose ? Si l'on est dans l'état d'esprit d'une inversion des clichés, ça ne marche pas par exemple (...la domination masculine ne passe pas par une interdiction des plaisirs de ce type aux femmes, de nos jours... je veux dire, l'homme-objet ça existe aussi :D).

On a donc pèle-mêle du second degré, de la caricature, de l'inversion des rapports genrés, de la dénonciation directe... et on ne sait pas quels sont les partis pris par l'auteur, puisqu'on joue à saute-mouton d'un mode de dénonciation à l'autre. Ça manque de cohérence ; et dans un discours politique, c'est casse-gueule. :/

**Sur la forme**

Comme pour le fond, un peu plus de cohérence dans le style serait cool. :)

Je parle par exemple de la typo qui passe du boulot recherché/sympathique à voir (le titre de la vidéo sur papier, écrit ""à la main"") au très sale (les inter-titres).

Le ABONNEZ-VOUS répétitif (pour moi, ça l'est lorsque c'est l'un des rares messages contenus dans la présentation de la vidéo + dans la vidéo) est insupportable. Pour rappel, il y a des gens qui consacrent leur vie ou une partie de celle-ci à la lutte féministe (ou à d'autres luttes) ; je ne sais pas dans quelle mesure la reprise d'un pot-pourrie de dénonciations en vrac, avec une recherche évidente de choper des abonnés par la facilité du sujet leur plairait vraiment.

L'animation est simple mais cool. Pareil pour le style visuel. On sent que c'est fait avec des petits moyens mais ça n'est pas gênant. Au contraire. 

Le lien entre ce qui est dénoncé et l'animation est parfois chelou. Celui sur le fait d'accoster un homme dans la rue (...avec une nana qui passe, traite de tarlouze un homme...) est assez discordant en fait.

 Reconquista goes a bit different in the east region Pamplona/Aragon/Catalunya. Marca Hispanica had a strong relation with south Franks and was one of the other buffer states made by franks to secure the Empire. The first big push is around late X century or early XI century. 

 Examples: Barbastro Crusade in 1066 //Zamora rebuild in 1055 (was destroyed by Al-Masur in 981) or securing Porto region in 1064. 

Yep there where crusaders over Europe mainly in Spain and Baltic areas. One Aragonese king let the throne to Hospitaliers Order but aristocrats revolt xD. Another fun fact Hospitaliers still has top private Hospitals in Spain.

Estonia sends troops in to stop the insurrection but of course there's a Narva self-defense brigade or some bullshit with a bunch of mercenaries from Russia and friends that puts up resistance. 

If NATO intervenes, Russia may decide to do so as well to protect ethnic Russians, and that's where we have the chance of a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.

It wouldn't be his go to choice, obviously he would have to be in a bad situation in the first place to be considering it. Say for instance he miscalculates and invades a eastern European country that provokes a response from NATO. If nationalistic sentiment doesn't leave him room to deescalate and NATO is forced to counterattack that could lead to the large scale destruction of the Russian military. In that moment he would be faced with the consequences of nationalism on the home front which would leave him dangerously exposed to angry right-wing forces or the choice of fighting on and provoking an even bigger NATO response. At that point seeming a little crazy to gain leverage by tactically nuking a small and obscure Eastern European city might be in his calculations. Obviously this is speculation, but Russian military doctrine has a strike first posture and advocates a strategy of forcing enemies to deescalate by using limited nuclear strikes to terrorize them into agreeing to peace.


&gt; In 2000, Russia had issued a new military doctrine whose main innovation was the concept of “de-escalation”—the idea that, if Russia were faced with a large-scale conventional attack that exceeded its capacity for defense, it might respond with a limited nuclear strike.


It is all in how you interpret ""capacity for defense"". Throughout the 2000s up until now, Russia military leaders have repeatedly threatened to nuke US missile defense sites preemptively. And not in the sense that they were eventually going to nuke them in a tense situation, more like the threat of nuking them out of the blue without any apparent cause. Look up how many times Russian military personnel of high rank have threatened to preemptively nuke the US and you'll see the numbers are unnerving. They have sent nuclear bombers to the US ADIZ to test US military response times 10 times since the beginning July flying as far south as California. Officials in the Pentagon have said that their recent trips haven't been training and are more like intelligence gathering to probe for weak spots.

**Les plus :** Ils sont sympas, toujours un sourire, super polis. La bière est très bonne. C'est très marrant de demander une Nelson quand on est Français (il faut entretenir les petites rivalités !). Les supermarché ouvert le dimanche c'est chouette. 
J'aime également la structure hiérarchique différent de la France.  
Et j'aime beaucoup le NHS (système de soin). Je peux me tromper, mais ça m'a l'air moins casse pied que le système Français. Et c'est une des dernières trace du socialisme pré-Thatcher. 
Et dans ce pays, ça juge un peu moins les gens selon leur apparence.

**Les moins :** J'ai du mal à savoir si oui ou non tout cette politesse, sourire, etc sont sincère, notamment au travail. En France on est plus directe qu'on ose l'admettre, en Angleterre tout est un degrés plus subtile (un bonne exemple serait que si un chef dit ""you could"", il y a de forte chance qu'il le veut).
Le système scolaire Anglais. Payer une fortune pour un master en 4 ans ? WTF ! xD
La nourriture me manque. Le vrai fromage me manque (ils sont fière de leur plastique c'est fou &gt;&lt;.

Leur horaire pour festoyer. Ils y vont directe après le boulot en semaine, mais font de même le week end. J'ai l'habitude de Paris et d'aller boire avec mes potes en ville a 21/22h. Y aller à 17/18h c'est bizarre.

Nearly every European citizen that is older than 20-30 has grandparents who were one way or the other affected by WWII and its aftermath (grandmothers in the ruins of Central Europe, dead grandfathers/granduncles, a dire econonmic situation and occupation by foreign forces...), while in the US ""only"" the soldiers in active duty had a direct exposure to the war (with the exception of Hawaii and other overseas territories).

Edit: Since all the butthurt, I'll try to illustrate this a little bit better.

The majority of citizens in Europe and the US were never directly in a war. While the US constantly produces veterans, who influence their loved-one's and friends, for most Europeans, their parents/grandparents were involved in what happened to be the biggest conflict in histroy which also happened to take place to a large part on their home continent.

For someone who listens to stories of Joe, the Afghanistan veteran (where there are also European ones...) it could go something like this:

""We were patrolling in our Jeep and you had to look out for traps planted by the Taliban. If you were careless, it could mean that your squad ended up with casualties and injured."" (btw, this is more or less a story of a european Afghanistan veteran I know).

Compared to stories of your grandparents going like this (and you hearing them when you were in your teens):

""During that battle I was nearly killed. My good friend Joseph I told you about, bit the dust when a mortar hit him. All in all I was very lucky, since out of 10 only 2 made it.""

Followed by ""There was nothing left at home. The house was in ruins. Winter was coming (no pun intended) and we had to leave everything behind.""

Then stories of my father: ""They were still rebuilding decades after that and finding duds in the corn fields. Not few would die or be injured, when one of those went off.""

Followed by ""When I was in the army (as conscript) we had to train for the beginning of WWIII. Especially the nuke drills were the most annoying using your gas mask while running up a hill with all your equipment.""

And still today, if I travel around Europe I hear comments like ""well, this city used to have a lovely center, but it was devasted in the war...""

While it is farther back in the past, the exposure of what war really means was certainly there in Europe and may only start to diminish now. And I haven't touched on the Balkan-wars.

To end, if you were directly involved in a war/battle it is of another magnitude all together.

true,ChipAyten,TURK,Turkey,"You don't have to educate me on the repercussions of Turkey's candidacy. With that being said the EU's carrot on a stick gag in regards to Turkey's bid did at least in some measure pave the way for Erdogan's abandonment of western ideals. If you look back on his first two terms he was rather keen on making the changes necessary for admission. [Look at the negotiation progress, great strides had been made.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union) But he and the AKP grew tired of being endlessly baited along with no clear answer in sight. I felt as if the EU was giving us the ""separate but equal"" treatment. Europe needs Turkey just enough to appease Turkey with candidacy but Europe is not fully welcoming of 70 million muslims so a real decision will never come about.

Poi se avete mai sentito i canali usati per il traffico aereo sapete quant'è importante capire, perchè solo farsi capire non basta.
In Italia puoi volare senza parlare inglese, ma provate ad ascoltare i canali dove stanno i professionisti, magari quelli incasinati delle FIR del nord e centro Italia e vedete cosa capite anche se l'inglese lo parlate tutti i giorni.
Vedendo i primi minuti è inaccettabile (a parte il rumore di fondo di piazzale dove ci sono motori rumorosi accesi e non hanno ovviamente le cuffie che si usano in volo) che non capisca una semplice domanda.
Alla risposta si capisce bene che l'inglese non è esattamente un suo punto di forza, quindi non credo fosse il casino dei motori, ma solo la scarsa capacità linguistica.
Magari sarà un vigile del fuoco bravissimo ed un pilota eccellente, ma dovrebbe impratichirsi un po' di più se vuole poter varcare i confini e non solo pilotando l'aereo.

Hanno scaricato esattamente dove andava fatto e ne sono usciti in modo perfetto. L'incendio è stato spento solo da loro e da un elicottero (molto meno efficace ma più chirurgico), i mezzi terrestri là arrivavano a stento. Sono matti ma bravissimi.

**Points Positifs :** 
Le cout de la vie, j'avais 100 dirhams (10 euros à l'époque en conversion) et je pouvais manger tous les midis au resto des trucs frais et bons. Les petits taxis ne coutent rien et emmènent aux 4 coins de la ville très rapidement.

La bouffe en général, si tu es pas trop porté sur l’aseptise complète, que tu demandes pas d'ou ça vient mais que tu profites, c'est toujours bon. Ca a pas mal évolué depuis l'hyper touristisation avec l'arrivée du Marjane (Grande surface) et la dispartion des petits magasins en bord de route.

Le climat et l'accès aux loisirs : en gros, 3h de route pour la mer et 3h de route pour la montagne. Essaouira pour le surf, Oukaimeden pour le ski, tout l'atlas pour faire de la rando, les gorges de la Todra pour faire de l'escalade, etc etc Le désert est un poil plus loin, mais bon... A Marrakech même, y'a tous les sports dispo, tous les circuits possibles. Y'a même possibilité d'aller pécher dans les lacs alentours. 

L'accès, pour un Francais, à beaucoup de choses, du fait de son statut. Attention, pas dans le sens ""patron"" mais plus dans la culture, dans la langue, les offres d'emplois...

L'éducation dans un lycée Francais : le niveau est clairement meilleur que dans un collège / lycée en France. 

Le train de vie : ""Un homme pressé est déjà mort.""

**Points Négatifs :** 

Climat : Il fait chaud. Il peut faire très chaud. 

Adsl : Quand je suis parti, l'adsl arrivais juste. En 128kbps. A 100m du DSLAM. Du seul de la ville. 

L'hyper touristisation : J'y suis retourné il y a peu, c'est horrible. Le souk ressemble a plus rien. Les prix ont bien augmentés. Il commence a avoir un ""ras le bol"" des Francais, qui se pensent tous permis et qui font ce que ils veulent. 

La corruption clairement présente. Le fait aussi que les forces publiques ne soient pas du tout égalitaires entre touristes et résidents. 

Les infrastructures, même si c'est mieux. La pauvreté très présente dès que l'ont sort un peu du centre.

true,friedfishudo,null,null,"In order to regain german citizenship, you need to fulfill certain requirements. Those are also dependant on the status your anchestors have/had. I am relatively sure, that you fulfill those criterias, however it might be possible, that you lost you right to become a citizen. But first things first.
1. You need to hand certain documents to the ""Bundesverwaltungsamt"" (Federal Administration Office). This can be done via a german consulate or the german embassy. 
All documents are required to be in an attested copy. The ""Bundesverwaltungsamt"" accepts copies by the notary public, so you dont need to see a german notary. English documents need to be translated in an attested form. This is important! They might accept your request if not attested but generally german agencies are a pain in the ass if it comes to formalities. Play it safe and hand in a attested translation.
Those documents are: 

1. (Copy of) your birthcertificate and a translation

2. (Copy of) Certification of birth and marriage of your parents and a translation, if your parents are not married, reply and i tell you what to do.

3. (Copy of) Documents that prove the german citizenship of your grandparents. E.g. a passport, documents proving the stripping of their citizenship etc. 

4. (Copy of) a Document that proves your grandparents gained US citizenship. The naturalisation papers would be best, but a US passport should be fine aswell (not completly sure here).

5. (Copy of) any other documents proving jewish affiliation or german citzenship. Documents making it conclusive that they had a german citizenship are also accepted. 

6. (Copy of) birth and marriage certification of your grant parents.

7. A list (no need for an attested copy here) of prior, successful regaining acts of relatives of yours with name, date of birth, file reference and agency.

8. This little sheet, with a attested signature of yours: http://www.bva.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BVA/Staatsangeh%C3%B6rigkeit/Ansprucheinb%C3%BCrgerung/Anspruch_Antrag1Pd.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2

Point 1,2,4 and 8 are in any case nessesary. Points 3 and 5 dont need to be fulfilled both, but doing so will make it easier. Point 6 is not nessesary, however the agency might request those documents later, delaying the whole process. If you have those, hand them in the first place. Point 7 will speed up the process. 
Furthermore you should add a letter written in german to the ""Bundesverwaltungsamt"" kindly stating your request. 
If you hand in those documents and your request is accepted, you get your citizenship in 6-12 months. 

However, it is not impossible that you lost your right to become a citizen. Based on the Art 116 II, you cant become a citizen, if you, your parents or your grandparents lost that right by the regulations the ""Staatsangehörigengesetz (StAG)"" (Nationality Act) defines. Especially the §17 I Nr. 5 StAG might have caused a lose of that right. It states that you lose your citzenship, when you serve in a foreign army without consent of the German defence ministery. If your father served, he might have lost the right. Your mother, however, might still have those rights and be able to ""heir"" them to you. To answer the question wether they lost the right or not it is important to know if your anchestors served, when they served and when they were married, when you were born and if you served yourself.


To answer the second part of your question: I dont think it is selfish at all. Even if you gain citizenship for financial reasons, it doesnt change the fact, that you (most likely) would have grown up in Germany if your grandparents were stripped of citizenship. Contrary to your believe it was not a minority of germans supporting the prosecution of jews. Hitler was elected into power, he did not seize it. The society is to blame for those acts and it has to pay for what happend. In parts even nowadays. Furthermore it is totally worth it, if you are willing to learn about germany. I dont see any reason, you should not apply. The citzienship offers you a great deal of opportunities. Getting a degree is free in Germany for example. 
For a start, make an appointment in the german consulate or embassy to talk about your request. You will learn that being kind and modest will make them return this attitude. And start learning german.
Hope that answers your questions!

    Allemagne

**Bien** :

On était dans le quartier français, tout le monde était heureux d'être à Berlin, c'était une ambiance très particulière (tout le monde chialait lors des cérémonies d'adieu) post-chute du Mur. On peut tout faire à vélo. Tout est plein d'arbres. Les gens sont très ouverts, même s'ils paraissent un poil timide au début. Plus directs, aussi. Ils sont d'une ponctualité qui ferait rougir une Swatch. La ville est très cosmopolite. La culture très riche, l'histoire super intéressante. Les kebabs et les currywurst, qui sont la preuve de l'existence d'un Dieu qui nous veut du Bien.

**Moins** :

Les voisins qui surveillent si tu tries bien tes déchets, le côté parfois un peu ""coincé"" des Allemands. Leur ponctualité, bien qu'admirable, peut être vue comme une obsession.

    Luxembourg    

**Bien** : Le niveau de vie, les salaires qui crèvent le plafond, les belles bagnoles partout, Luxembourg-ville est très jolie ([en été c'est très mignon](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Luxembourg_Grund_from_Verlorenkost_01.jpg)), c'est très cosmopolite aussi. Il est fréquent d'entendre plein de langues dans le bus (surtout autour du quartier européen). La bouffe luxembourgeoise, grasse comme je l'aime : [Judd mat Gaardebounen](http://www.eu2005.lu/pictures/savoir_lux/societe_traditions/judd_460.jpg), une tuerie. Les luxembourgeois parlent *tous* au moins trois langues. D'ailleurs, le luxembourgeois c'est très marrant et intéressant à étudier.

**Moins** : beaucoup pensent que mon adolescence là-bas m'a ""donné"" un compte en banque à 6 chiffres. Je passe pour un exilé fiscal, donc un profiteur. Le coût de la vie, élevé, l'immobilier qui est hors de prix. Les FAI, qui se foutent de la gueule du monde. Je trouve que beaucoup de luxembourgeois sont un peu limites avec les étrangers et je me suis déjà fait insulter parce que je suis français (ça m'est JAMAIS arrivé autre part). Ça peut être pire si on ne fait pas d'effort pour apprendre le luxembourgeois. La jeunesse dorée des eurocrates qui est très vomissable.

    Belgique

**Plus** : le côté ""pas prise de tête"", l'autodérision bien belge ainsi que leur humour délicieusement irrévérencieux, l'accueil, les [carbonnades flamandes](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/sites/bbcgoodfood.com/files/recipe_images/recipe-image-legacy-id--496_11.jpg) et les [boulettes liégeoises](http://wallifornia.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1345478838310.jpg), la [Triple Karmeliet](http://oldstreettown.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/biere-tripel-karmeliet.jpg). La couverture sociale, l'avant-garde sur certaines choses (euthanasie, mariage homo, etc.) qui me font dire qu'ils sont plus ouverts d'esprit. La famille royale, ça me fait marrer. Ma connexion internet, qui est 400x meilleure que celle chez mes parents au Lux. La culture, très riche et très variée. Globalement, la Belgique c'est ""cool"" et j'y suis bien.

**Moins** : l'administration, c'est une blague. Le copinage, mais ça doit exister partout. La SNCB qui fait des grèves tout le temps, leur regard vis-à-vis du ""grand-frère"" français est fatiguant (les petites piques parce que je dis ""soixante-dix"" et pas ""septante"" et que c'est illogique, c'était marrant au début mais maintenant c'est casse-couilles). Les entreprises qui filent des bagnoles à tout le monde, ça me hérisse ma fibre écolo. Leurs putains de problèmes communautaires et l'incapacité des Wallons et des Flamands à faire des compromis me dépassent.

But neither considers the state of legal traditions of various countries in the area, especially in family law, to be so coherent to push for the big decisions, like marriage, on the continental level, and by court ruling, that is to say, without a democratic decision of the local electorates. These courts simply don't have the authority comparable to what a true federal supreme court would have.

European equivalent of Roe v. Wade, called A, B and C v Ireland, had the opposite conclusion than in the US for eg, concluding that ""Article 8 cannot... be interpreted as conferring a right to abortion""

Just avoid the late night buses (underground is ok in the central area until the end of service).
There will be no crowd at all these days, almost everyone who can afford is on vacation, and I expect the weekend to be almost desert. Check for opening times of every place you want to see (like Last supper or museum or whatever) since with the Ferragosto on Friday most of the place could have reduced opening time or simply be shut at least of Ferragosto.
I would recommend to have something planned on Ferragosto otherwise you'll find yourself stranded in a shut city.
I expect most of the city inner center (quadrilatero della moda) to have stores open, but I think that outside of the area you'll hardly find a restaurant open at lunch.
If you have a car you can easily take a trip on one of the lakes (Como or Maggiore or Garda), there will be lots of people and all stores open, but you might prefer to stay in Milano.

After this weekend, life will sparkle again in the city since lot of people will end their vacation and start working again on Monday.

I might be a little too negative on the opening times, but I'm not living in Milan anymore since 2009, and things change fast (and Italy is much more in depression now than before 2009), but I think that the wealthy Milan people will not refrain from vacation even in these times.

* Une certaine légèreté de vivre. L'héritage britannique ne se retrouve pas dans la conception du travail, ici (c'est plutôt la nonchalance, sans tomber dans la paresse).
* Pas de culture gastronomique locale, donc une ouverture aux gastronomies internationales (en quantité et en qualité). Ça ouvre les yeux, les papilles, et rappelle que non, la gastro Fr n'est plus la meilleure depuis longtemps.
* Le mois de mai, quand TOUTE la ville revit après 6 mois d'hibernation. Et que les filles, magnifiques, réapparaissent.
* Le mois de septembre, alors que la chaleur épaisse laisse la place à une atmosphère plus claire, moins plate, plus colorée.
* Les paysages proches : Estrie, Vermont, Lac Champlain. Certains coins des Laurentides.
* L'intelligence et la sensibilité des gens, bien loin du manque d'ouverture et du besoin de valorisation à la française. Moins de névrose.
* De la même façon, le manque de formalisme et de hiérarchie. Tu collabores avec ton boss. Tu n'es pas son sous-fifre.
* Diversité dans l'offre culturelle: théâtre, danse, musique. Ça tend à mourir à cause des politiques de l'anus artificiel qui nous sert de premier ministre canadien.

* Le système de santé. Long. Approximatif. Bien que jadis, l'agente d'immigration avait expliqué un premier refus en suspectant de ma part une volonté de ""profiter"" de leur système de santé. J'aurais pu lui rire dans la gueule. J'aurais dû. Et je ne pousserai pas plus loin, pour ne pas aborder le sujet du ""collège des médecins"", une mafia qu'il faudra un jour démanteler pour le bien commun.
* La culture Tim Horton. Un fast-food à la canadienne spécialisé dans le café, le pire qui soit, et dont les files d'attente débordent chaque matin. Cette culture rejoint celle d'une banlieue du Nebraska, et pourrait aussi s'appeler culture Wal-Mart.
* Cette culture fait en sorte qu'en dehors de Montréal, dans la plupart des villages, l'enseigne ""Boulanger"" désigne le nom de famille d'un garagiste, ""Boucher"" aussi (à moins que ce ne soit celle d'un agent immobilier).
* Beaucoup d'ex-belles-régions ont été rasées par l'industrie agricole et les centres commerciaux.
* Beaucoup de régions, et de villages, construits au siècle dernier autour d'une seule usine. Feeling de village dortoir, où les gens vivent dans la précarité permanente dans la menace de fermeture de l'usine.
* L'humour, dans les médias, est une industrie ultra-formatée. Heureusement, Gilbert Rozon passe pas mal de temps en France.
* Les moustiques et les mouches, en été, en région.
* La mentalité ""né pour un petit pain"", un manque d'ambition et un dégoût certain pour la réussite, sauf quand elle a été validée par un pays étranger. Le sentiment d'habiter un second-world country. Ce n'est évidemment pas le tiers-monde, mais c'est loin d'être un acteur international.
* La politique. Indescriptible. Des petites gens sans éducation ni vocabulaire, à la vision inexistante, qui veulent mettre des sou-sous dans leur petite popoche. Je ne vote QUE par respect pour la liberté de voter. En face, l'électorat, aussi informé que le passage d'une tête politique à Tout le Monde en Parle peut lui en offrir.
* Les médias. Les grossistes en opinion sont des stars, et on en compte quelques milliers. Des journalistes articulés, par contre, c'est limité à un journal qui n'est pas sûr de survivre l'année prochaine.

-----------
The main problem about Don Pelayo and Covadonga battle is that moor chronicles don’t say a word about Covadonga battle and Astur resistance. 

 Actually there is no proof outside the self-made Astur chronicles that say’s that Pelayo was connected with old Visigoth Kingdom and there is no mention of Covadonga battle anywhere else in contemporary documents (moor and catholic). 

In that dark ages there are no need to be an aristocrat. Any group or leader that had armed forces and can hold they own territory can be considered a lord even if they don’t have any connection with old nobility. We are in a pre-feudal context so there isn’t a huge difference between duchy and Kingdom. 


¿Nation Founder?
-------
Don Pelayo was used as a national founder myth (for conservative/Castilian Spain) and may be only a empty name and nothing extraordinary behind. Don Pelayo connects the Visigoths elective Kings with the feudal Monarchy raised by the Jimena Dynasty. In fact we don’t know the parents of Pelayo and his dynasty extinct in XII century. 

Mainstream historiography between XIX and XX century identify Don Pelayo as the founder of Spanish nation. (There is a ton of political/historic debates about if Spain is a nation and what kind of nation is).  Sanchez-Albornoz and other conservative historians try hundreds of time to prove that Don Pelayo was a “lost” Visigoth aristocrat following the Astur Kingdom chronicles that connects him with a suposed miraculous escape of a part of the Toledo aristocracy.

Astur/Leonese dynasty (in light blue): http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinastía_astur-leonesa#mediaviewer/Archivo:Dinastia_Astur-Leonesa.jpg


Medieval history and sources
-----------

The problem here in medieval history and chronicles that unless you found archeological evidences or 2 or 3 more mentions(in contemporary text) it’s hard to prove the existence of Covandonga battle. Don Pelayo exists but as historians we couldn’t say much more. 

Between the fall of Rome and XI/XII century there are a massive gap without documents and we have to rely purely on few religious documents that have a really special writing style and their objective is to tell the history of Catholic Church and later on evolves on “Kingdom/ dynasty propaganda”. So it’s really hard to extract the reality behind that unless we could access to archeology or other sources. 

If you want more detailed info send a PM I can ask a friend that is a medievalist from Zamora, sure he had better sources or know where to look.

true,waveswan,SWED,Sweden,"Putin is running out of options, and that is precisely why this must be dealt with most carefully. Many people misunderstand such situations, tending to believe that when an opponent has no options left they are soon defeated. In reality it is like chasing a black mamba into a corner and then starting to harass it. If you give people no other option but to fight you, they will. The failure of American politicians and social movements to realise this is part of the reason their congress is deadlocked.

Now before you ask. No, it is not as simple as saying they are all racists. The republican party is scared as hell. What the liberals should have done was to support and seriously talk to the tea party before they got taken over by the corps. All they need to do to fix it is to tell any sponsor that is unwilling to agree to help them despite not liking the present course the GOP is taking to support the more sober libertarian candidates. 

Same with Oil companies. You can persuade them to research biofuels and help them invest in renewables the way BP is doing. If you simply decide to have massive petrol taxes without understanding the needs of farmers and people who rely on a car to pay the loans on their house and such you have a problem. 

Our own country did this with success by offsetting carbon taxes with tax reductions in other areas, thus allowing for a gradual shift that was not very painful. Because the American politicians still see politics as a war instead of collaboration with friendly competition for ideas ( much like science is done) they tend to escalate conflicts, which on the one hand make their political system much more entertaining than ours ( seriously, our parliament is a snorefest ) but also much less efficient.

Indeed, much of Sweden's success can probably be attributed to our cultural tendency towards compromise. ""Lagom är bäst."" We mostly need to fix the status of our teachers and our school and beat it into the old parties heads that, no, forcing unemployed into poorly thought through job programs will not work any better this time around than the last half a dozen attempts to do things that way.

It was an attempt to wipe off the face of the earth, or at least Anatolia, a people who have been living on the plains of eastern Anatolia for well over 2,000 years, if not more.

There is no doubt that Turks suffered losses during WWI. However, it was not genocide.

I encourage you to go out east. Visit Adana, Moush, Diyarbekir, Sepastia, Giligia, Sivas, and many, many other cities that no longer have any Armenians therein.

They look exactly like the French planes except that there are Italian words written on them (Vigli Del Fuoco) and a small... Italian flag color thing there. Yea, I want to talk to Silla now.


&gt; Studio: And I want to talk to you Jenny, what a couple of fantastic interviews. We like that Italian pilot there but it was a bit contradictory there. First he said ""yes we will be able to put out this fire, no problem"" and then he went back on his words a bit, what do you say about that?


&gt; Giornalista: Yea, well, I think he had a bit of a problem with the language as well. If I may interpret him a bit I think he meant that they have the prerequisites to handle this as long as they are allowed to get up in the air, then there would be no problem. Now they have four of these big planes and they can, as I understood it, if he adds up, with all these planes in the air, 12 hours of work and that's quite a lot and then they can manage to do quite a lot during a day. So now it's all about them getting up in the air, really, and if they can do that then I think he meant it'll be ""no problem, easy piece of cake"". He's used to this, that's how I interpreted it.


&gt; Studio: You asked that question there to the French guy about who he thought was the best, the Italian or the French, what do you think Jenny? Who do you think will help us best/most with the fire?


&gt; Giornalista: (pause) Oj/Wow, well the French have three planes and the Italians have two.. but maybe they.. they have three planes of which one is one of these ""help planes"" so like, I don't know, and I have to say that they're the same, pretty much equal chance (to help), but I have to ask the Italian what he thinks, see if he gives an answer just as diplomatic.

This replacement of the genitive with the dative case is also common with wegen and während. But this is only acceptable in colloquial speech.

Generally in the spoken language, most people nowadays try to avoid the genitive in many circumstances. Which is a shame, but that's the current development.

**Another Technique for Nouns without Endings**

Unfortunately you will not cover many many other nouns. For those there is a lovely technique that works with association:

1) You replace the three grammatical genders (masculine, neuter, feminine) with something that's easy to visualize and therefore easy to remember.
 
2) You associate this substitute with the meaning of the word.**

Some examples:

* instead of *der Fisch* you visualize  *Superman* (=der) is eating only *Fisch*.
* instead of *das Auge* you visualize *Big fat German Babies* (=das) born with only one *Auge* and 
* instead of *die Nase* you visualize *Madonna or the Queen* (=die) with a giant *Nase*.

If you do the visualization right, meaning you take a few seconds to close your eyes and imagine these situations above, I bet you will remember them for quite a while even without reviewing them. If I ask you in two weeks whether ""Superman"" or a ""Baby"" or ""Madonna/Queen"" had a giant ""Nase"", you'd certainly remember which of them it was.

And you seem to have forgotten a few wars there. Vietnam, Iraq 1,  etc.

As stated deaths aren't the only cause of suffering, this is where you're making my argument for me. You don't know what it's like to have someone deployed for years at a time and the feeling of not knowing what will happen to them day after day. Or being deployed yourself with the same feeling, you haven't done shit. Seeing people you know shot and being under constant attack even if you're not dying. You mean to tell me you have a better understanding than the millions of troops that have fought for the US since WWII?

Now, just go over the Wikipedia article on the [Srebrenica massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre), just to refresh your memory. The fact that Bosniaks were not NATO citizens is not what counts here. What counts is the fact that Dutch troops were *deathly afraid* of Serbs and *deathly afraid* of the *idea* of Russian volunteers. So horrified that hundreds of them ran away, surrendered and even kicked Bosniak refugees out of their camp to their deaths. This isn't *no Serbs have ever done nuffin' to me*, this is pure fear, whey for blood, quivering, pathetic, yellow fear.

You seem to conveniently forget the next section where I do the same math but for all the wounded soldiers, why do you keep ignoring half of my comment?

&gt; And you seem to have forgotten a few wars there. Vietnam, Iraq 1, etc.

Vietnam was the only other statistically relevant war (with 60k deceased and  200k injured), as all wars in between are negligible for the purpose of our argument. But since we're arguing what ""we"" went through, I was using just the examples of current, ongoing wars.

Broken limb != lost limb or brain damage. Again, ignoring or twisting my words.

Portuguese people going to Angola or Mozambique are people in private companies' high-ranks or people with well-payed jobs guaranteed (in hotels or private schools owned by Western companies). There aren't Portuguese people going to Angola on a whim. Those go to other European countries and end up working in German factories or being plumbers in France (the two biggest cliches in Portuguese migration). 

There are also people opening businesses in other European countries (mainly restaurants, patisseries and construction). This is very rare in Angola. The only people I can think of who go to Angola and open businesses there do so in very elite industries (elite in Africa) and they have high-ranking contacts in the industry of their business (like publicity, private jet rental services; etc; stuff for oligarchs).

As for the Portuguese people of Angolan or Mozambican descent going back to their roots they aren't many. Most Portuguese people of ex-colony origin who are going back to their roots are Brazilians.

It's not that Brazil is that much better than Angola or Mozambique when it comes to middle income opportunities that makes people go there (it is but not much). It's that Brazilian immigrants have never integrated Portuguese society and culture as successfully as African immigrants. They formed communities in Portugal like the Chinese or Muslims, the difference being that these two have lower crimes rates than everyone else, whereas Brazilian people have crime rates slightly above average (this includes Portuguese people crime rates for both examples).

So obviously some of them are going back to Brazil. But there are still more coming to Portugal than those leaving.

As for Portuguese people with no roots in Brazil migrating there, they do so in the same conditions I mentioned for Angola above.

Delta Works
A complex set of dams and bridges in Zeeland and the Rotterdam area. These are made to prevent floods if the dikes fail to protect the southwest of the nation during heavy rainfall or storms. One of humanity's most impressive feats of engineering.

Amsterdam Central Station
A gorgeous piece of architecture that is the starting point of many a visit to the Dutch capital. Its many spires and windows are worth turning around for before starting your tour through the city centre.

The canals
Many major towns grew during the enlightenment era in the 17th century, when freedom, trade and wealth were unrivaled in the world here. The canals with their rennaissance gables of cities such as Leiden, Amsterdam and Utrecht still remind us of those days.

Polders
Half of the country is artificial. In fact, the whole province of Flevoland is one giant polder. For a time, when there wasn't enough room for the vast horticultural enterprises in our country, people would simply drain the sea to make more land. The orderly, carefully divided landscape of the below-sea level regions remind us of this.

Mills
No mountains means lots of wind. This was - and often still is - used to make flower for bread. It's worth it to see the intricate mechanisms inside them. Many are open as a tourist attraction.

Giethoorn
A small town in which some houses are only accessible by boat. Picturesque and well worth seeing. It's like a tiny Venice.

Binnenhof
The Dutch parliament building in The Hague is one of the most impressive buildings in the country. The small tower looking over the left side of the pond is the office of the Prime Minister.

The [German current account surplus of 7.5% of it's GDP](http://i.imgur.com/teeDGS6.png) is only possible within the euro area. With a floating exchange rate, the german currency would appreciate, eliminating the surplus through increased imports as the purchasing power of Germans increases.

Of course not, but [price competitiveness](http://i.imgur.com/Wvnz3dH.png) matters.

If you look at the economies of Greece, Spain, Portugal etc. then internal devaluation pushed through austerity, which largely placed the burden of adjustment on reducing labor costs can only be considered a failure. As cheap labor costs are not a comparative advantage within the euro area, and for the global market the costs are still denominated in euro.

There are more species of Serbs, one famous species is Montanius Balcanicus from which all the species of Serbs came, they are known by square heads, can grow so big that even Dutch of Human origins are midgets compared to them (see [Slavko Vranes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavko_Vrane%C5%A1)), they usually inhabit western and central parts of Serbia, whole Montenegro and half of Bosnia which they share with similar species called Bosniaks (overall they are similar and the only difference is the barking which is Isus for the Serbs and Alah for the Bosniaks). Now there are domesticated version of Serbs like Panonicus-NOT-Balcanicus, these Serbs believe (which is of course bullshit) that they don't have square heads and are more round like Russians, Poles, generally Slavs which they hate because Slavs are not liberal. Panonicus-NOT-Balcanicus is also known for eating Kulen and having less gay tendencies than their violent mountainous not domesticated kind (example: they are using ""Jebem ti majku!"" instead of ""Jebem ti oca!""). Race that experienced mass migration (in folk tales known as the ""Traktorijada"") is the famous race Ultra-Serbicus-not-believing-Serbia that lived in the territories of Croatia and scientists believe that they are exiled in around 1995 A.D. That race was known for not listening to the pack and was always doing things it's own way.

A big, beautiful ship that was built by the king Gustav II Adolf during Swedens ""Great Power Period"" in the 1600's. 

It was pompous, expensive and from what I've learned in school they pretty much knew that it wasn't fit to travel on the open sea, yet they sent it out on it's maiden trip and BAM after a few hundred meters it sank. It had a crew of ~450 men on board.

In the 50's they found it and took it out of the water, restored it as much as they could and now it's been in a museum since the 90's. 

[The Ericsson Globe](http://static.feber.se/article_images/25/40/12/254012_1280.jpg)

Also they held the Starcraft World Championship there in 2012, aswell as some World Cups in Hockey etc.

The first Ice hotel in the world, one of the most tourist visited places in the Northern parts of Europe. Since it's ALL made out of Ice they rebuild it every year in a new design and every room is unique.

The hotel covers an 5500m2 area, and as I said, it's ALL made out of ice. The bed stands, the walls, the glass you are drinking out of, the bar, the floor. Everything.

So to some extent we should blame Romans. Before independent and able to withstand attacks from other empires it became a province of a city, to which all roads (taxes) led.

The legend of Archimedes being stroke down by Roman soldier, while the former was possibly making mathematical discovery is a symbol of the fall of Greek science and philosophy to me. The following years brought decadence - fin des sciecle attitude - driven ideas and religious zaelotry, which one can explain with Roman conquest.

Greece is yet to be reborn. But now it has best time to do so, since the Roman times, as I feel. Which of course I can be misguided about.

Diocletian's Palace (Croatian: Dioklecijanova palača, pronounced [diɔklɛt͡sijǎːnɔʋa pǎlat͡ʃa]) is an ancient palace built by the Roman emperor Diocletian at the turn of the fourth century CE, that today forms the center of the city of Split. While it is referred to as a ""palace"" because of its intended use as the retirement residence of Diocletian, the term can be misleading as the structure is massive and more resembles a large fortress: whereof about half was for Diocletian's personal use, and the rest housed the military garrison.


2.The Cathedral of St. James (Croatian: Katedrala sv. Jakova) in Šibenik, Croatia is a triple-nave basilica with three apses and a dome (32 m high inside) in the city of Šibenik, Croatia. It is the church of the Catholic Church in Croatia, and the see of the Šibenik diocese. It is also the most important architectural monument of the Renaissance in the entire country. Since 2000, the Cathedral has been on the UNESCO World Heritage List.


3.The Pula Arena is the name of the amphitheatre located in Pula, Croatia. The Arena is the only remaining Roman amphitheatre to have four side towers and with all three Roman architectural orders entirely preserved. It was constructed in 27 BC – 68 AD and is among the six largest surviving Roman arenas in the World. A rare example among the 200 Roman surviving amphitheatres, it is also the best preserved ancient monument in Croatia.


4.The Walls of Ston are a series of defensive stone walls, originally more than 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) long, that surrounded and protected the city of Ston, in Dalmatia, part of the Republic of Ragusa, in what is now southern Croatia.
The Walls of Ston were known as the ""European wall of China"".


5.Dubrovnik  is a Croatian city on the Adriatic Sea, in the region of Dalmatia. It is one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the Mediterranean, a seaport and the centre of Dubrovnik-Neretva County. Its total population is 42,615 (census 2011). In 1979, the city of Dubrovnik joined the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.

The prosperity of the city of Dubrovnik was historically based on maritime trade. As the capital of the Republic of Ragusa, a maritime republic, the city achieved a high level of development, particularly during the 15th and 16th centuries. Dubrovnik became notable for its wealth and skilled diplomacy.


6.The Zagreb Cathedral on Kaptol is a Roman Catholic institution and the tallest building in Croatia. It is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary and to kings Saint Stephen and Saint Ladislaus. The cathedral is typically Gothic, as is its sacristy, which is of great architectural value. Its spires can be seen from many locations in the city.


7.Trogir[a] (or Traù) is a historic town and harbour on the Adriatic coast in Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia, with a population of 10,818 (2011) and a total municipality population of 13,260 (2011). The historic city of Trogir is situated on a small island between the Croatian mainland and the island of Čiovo. It lies 27 kilometres (17 miles) west of the city of Split.

AD, although largely rebuilt and expanded by the Normans after a fire in the 12th c.  It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is one of the oldest purpose built Christian structures in England. 

2. [The Eden Project, Cornwall](http://www.cornishcottagesonline.com/dynimg_area_large/Eden_Project_Cornwall~82~68.jpg) giant, geodesic, climate controlled biomes set in an old clay mining quarry, housing myriad botanical gardens, art works and performance events. 


3. [The Clifton Suspension Bridge, Bristol](http://www.zzzone.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Clifton-Suspension-8718.jpg) spanning the Avon Gorge which itself is a designated biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest under EU law (it has species found no where else), the Bridge was famously designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and was completed after his death in 1864. It has a grade 1 listing from English Heritage. 

4. [Stonehenge, Wiltshire](http://celticmythpodshow.com/Resources/Galleries/Stonehenge/Orig/Stonehenge%20Rainbow%20by%20LuluP.jpg) undoubtedly one of the most famous neolithic and bronze age sites in both England and the World and listed along with the neighbouring Avebury Henge as a UNESCO world heritage site. Its mysterious origins have led to many myths and legends being attached to it over the centuries. 

5. [Yorkshire Dales National Park](https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3212/3009784787_659fe32d46.jpg) comprising 680 square miles of undulating hills and river valleys (dales) in Yorkshire and Cumbria, it epitomises the 'green and pleasant land' idyll of the English countryside. The area is also renowned for its characteristic stone built buildings.  

6. [Hadrian's Wall, Cumbria](http://www.peterloud.co.uk/photos/OthersUK/Hadrians_Wall/734_Milecastle_39_w750.jpg) another UNESCO World Heritage site, the wall was originally built to mark the Northern frontier of the Roman Empire in the 2nd c. AD. It now lies fully within England, the Scottish border having moved some distance North. 

7. [The ruins of Tintagel castle](http://ih2.redbubble.net/image.9122144.7775/flat,550x550,075,f.u1.jpg) A medieval fortress built upon Cornwall's Tintagel peninsula, it has been mythologised as the birth place of the legendary King Arthur since    Geoffrey of Monmouth's 'Historia Regum Britanniae' (history of the Kings of Britain) was written in the 12th c.

1. [Amsterdam Canal Belt](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/KeizersgrachtReguliersgrachtAmsterdam.jpg)

Amsterdam, capital of the Netherlands, has more than one hundred kilometres of canals, about 90 islands and 1,500 bridges. The three main canals, Herengracht, Prinsengracht, and Keizersgracht, dug in the 17th century during the Dutch Golden Age, form concentric belts around the city, known as the Grachtengordel. Alongside the main canals are 1550 monumental buildings. The 17th-century canal ring area were placed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2010.

2. [Delta Works](http://www.dutchtouristservice.nl/contents/media/delta_works_private_tour_1.jpg)

The Delta Works is a series of construction projects in the southwest of the Netherlands to protect a large area of land around the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta from the sea. The works consist of dams, sluices, locks, dykes, levees, and storm surge barriers. The aim of the dams, sluices, and storm surge barriers was to shorten the Dutch coastline, thus reducing the number of dikes that had to be raised. Along with the Zuiderzee Works, Delta Works have been declared one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

3. [Limestone Caves in Limburg](http://www.vakantieparken-limburg.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/grot_valkenburg.jpg)

I'm not entirely sure about the history of the Limestone Caves, but as far as I know, they were places where limestone was dug up. The caves are about 250 km long. After that they were used for various kind of activities and these days it's a tourist attraction in a unique landscape for The Netherlands! :)

7. [The Windmills](http://www.rvdaalenfotografie.nl/uploads/9/3/0/0/9300854/1733295_orig.jpg)

Ofcourse I need to include the dutch windmills. The first windmills were invented in antiquity, but it was the Dutch who really hit it off with this wooden giant. In a flat country, where the wind always blows, windmills sprouted from the ground like mushrooms. They were used to mill, saw, pump and press. The production of boards, paint, oil and paper, as well as bread and mustard – among other things – depended on windmills and wind. In addition, windmills were used to pump the water out of lakes and to keep reclaimed land dry.

And with many other things.

Just do an ""Gedankenexperiment"". Suppose Greece or Spain would go out of the EUR, and their currency value would be greatly devalued, maybe even just 1/10 of what it's now. Would their export sky-rocket?

According do you, it would.

But they still don't have the sales force out there, they still don't have the engineers, they still don't have the quality, they still don't have the plants. And so on.

Also, when the currency is devalued, then imports suddenly get very expensive. Germany for example has to import almost every raw material (except food), e.g. oil, coal, bauxit/aluminium, ...   so de-valueing of a currency would make those imports too expensive. In my book, the currency value is a contributor to the import/export value. Maybe even a major contributor, but not more.

There is a handful of reasony why i don't want Britain have influence on a unified European military. GCHQ working for the NSA/CIA, British intelligence spying on EU officials, people apparently tend to be too much influenced by populistic parties etc. 

Britain can't just sit in it's corner, refusing to play by EU rules, only want's EU's advantages without taking more responsibility and then get the command over the unified EU military just as a payoff. 

I would like the UK to stay in the EU, simply because it belongs to it just as Spain, Belgium or Sweden.

So yeah, we had to spend a shitload of money, but it got us a bunch of things that we urgently needed as a world class city.

Other stuff like the stadiums for handball and hockey (not very popular sports in the uk) were made temporary, and we cleverly converted some convention centers into venues for  boxing and fencing so that we didn't end up with a bunch of empty buildings.

Athens and beijing spent huge amounts of money on new metro lines and stations, but we just set up temporary arrangements and integrated stratford station into the existing network, so its not way out in the middle of nowhere, its on the way to other things.

I had huge fears that the olympics was a huge waste of cash, but it looks like lessons were learned, and our bureaucrats were very clever with their planning, so we ended up with a bunch of new stuff we actually needed, in an easy to access place that also happens to be one of the fastest growing parts of the city.

Agreed, but ""tu quoque"" is a terrible excuse.

Nobody has. The whole concept of MAD is centered around everyone being ready to retaliate in kind, though. This is why it's incredibly dangerous if even one nuclear power thinks they can get away with using their nukes.

&gt;Why should anyone else.

They shouldn't, and that's not the point I was making at all. The one thing that nuclear powers (and everyone else) can take away from this whole year, though, is that once you have the nukes, you don't give them up. Not for anything, not ever. Ukraine gave all their nukes to Russia at the end of the Cold War, on the assurance that Russia would respect (and defend) Ukrainian territorial integrity. This year has taught us what such promises are worth.

&gt;Seems to be a double standard in effect.

Sure, but despite all its failings (and they are too many to count), the US is still less of an oligarchy, and much less of a fascist state, than Russia.

Uh...Britain and France lead the way on Libya. The fact that you don't know that is making me suspicious of the value of anything else you say.

&gt;The Bundeswehr is far more aligned to the UN

Absolutely. The Bundeswehr, just like the UN, does a very large amount of nothing.

&gt;There is a handful of reasony why i don't want Britain have influence on a unified European military. GCHQ working for the NSA/CIA, British intelligence spying on EU officials, people apparently tend to be too much influenced by populistic parties etc.

GCHQ working ""for"" the NSA? What are you smoking chappy? The five eyes work together because we have a track record of about a century of not going batshit insane.

&gt;British intelligence spying on EU officials

As I said, if you don't think German spies are spying on everyone they can you're naive.

&gt;people apparently tend to be too much influenced by populistic parties etc.

Ah so is this just going to turn into you having an anti-British circlejerk?  The German population are no doubt much better than that, of a higher quality you might say?

&gt;Britain can't just sit in it's corner, refusing to play by EU rules

Oh blah blah blah, here we hear the same old tired tropes that populist media on the continent spews out. We play by the rules - but unlike every other country which gets to say ""Hold on a minute, we don't think X is a good idea"" - if the UK ever says that we're accused of not playing by the rules and of only having one foot in the door. The only way some people would be happy would be if the UK just said ""Yes"" to everything and that's absurd.

&gt;only want's EU's advantages without taking more responsibility and then get the command over the unified EU military just as a payoff.

Well, we're one of the only two nations providing a credible defence to the union, I'd say that's hardly an advantage in that we spend huge sums of money each year to maintain that defence.

&gt; But if the UK gouvernment is constantly moaning about gypsies without bringing concrete solutions

Oh man, seriously? Firstly, our government doesn't say jack shit about gypsies because they're scared shitless of being accused of racism, and secondly, have you looked over the fucking border at France where they just bulldoze Gypsy camps? The UK is paradise for gypsies compared with most continental European countries.

&gt;and supporting the US at things like TTIP, there is no way we pay the UK to stay.

TTIP was proposed by the EU. A minute ago you were complaining that the UK objects to everything and stalls negotiations, now you're annoyed at the UK for supporting something and advancing negotiations.
