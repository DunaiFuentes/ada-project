In terms of religion here in the South it's prevalent but isn't something *most* people will shove in your face. You'll drive by an interstate and see a large cross here or a billboard for a religious radio station there but it isn't like you go to pay for gas and someone challenges you with a ""Baptist or other Protestant?"" question. Nobody cares. There are mosques, temples and other places of worship for all religions. Nobody really cares, even if they do preach. Which I have yet to actually see in my entire time here but in all fairness I work in a major engineering town and there are a good number of atheists/agnostics. 

Nobody has ever asked what church I go to or if I'm even religious. It just never really comes up.

I have gotten some ""typical stupid kid"" looks when I go around in a t-shirt and shorts on a hot sunday afternoon when others are dressed in their sunday best but I've never had anyone say anything.

And, finally, I do have 2 friends that will sound like a cliche but they're 2 homosexual males in an interracial relationship (one black, one white) in a rural Alabama town (80,000 people in the entire county). Nothing has happened to them. They routinely walk around town holding hands. Nothing has happened to them. And the black guy is a drag queen to boot. Yes, at a gay club. That nobody cares about. In the US South. Both talk with a lisp and are pretty obvious to spot as gay. Nobody cares, still. 

They just kinda keep it to themselves though. They hold hands but don't kiss furiously in public (not even most straight couples do this). They may talk with a lisp but they don't wear a shirt that says ""I suck dick and love my boyfriend inside me"". See what I mean? 

Just keep to yourself and don't push an agenda on anyone and I can almost guarantee you that nobody will care. The US South is almost shockingly progressive to some... even other Americans. Most of whom have never been to the South.

With that said, I know this is a block of text but I do have kind of a funny story. I met a guy from California who had never been off the west coast. When I told him where I was from he was genuinely shocked. I ws wearing shoes, had proper dental care and wasn't talking with a deep draw.

So there are plenty of dumbass fellow Americans that think that the Beverly Hillbillies and stories from the 1960s is an accurate representation of the South. I'm sure you'd be fine.

German committee criticises television news coverage of Ukraine
By Sybille Fuchs

The supervisory committee of Germany's ARD public television station has criticised the station's coverage of developments in Ukraine. The station's coverage had ""given the impression of bias"" and appeared to be directed against ""Russia and Russian standpoints"", the committee declares in the minutes of its meeting of June 24, which has been published in the online magazine Telepolis.

The purpose of the nine-member committee is to represent the interests of viewers, and it has an advisory function. It is elected by the broadcasting councils of German states and consists of representatives from various associations, political parties, churches and other groups. Its current chairman is the lawyer and banker Dr. Paul Siebertz from Bavarian Radio. Also on the committee are the Catholic priest and journalist Stefan Wahl, a teacher, a natural health practitioner, a pastoral consultant and a representative of the federation of public officials.

Prior to meeting, the committee had analyzed several ARD reports on the crisis in Ukraine-a step that is regarded as unusual. The measure was taken following complaints from viewers about biased reporting. The members of the panel unanimously agreed that such criticisms were entirely justified.

The Advisory Council lists 10 points in which the reporting of the ARD was inadequate.

It criticises the absence of any fundamental analysis of the negotiations between the European Union (EU) and Ukraine on the Association Agreement. It criticises the fact that ""NATO's political and strategic intentions"" with regard to its policy of eastern enlargement were not raised. Nor was any critical analysis made of the legitimacy of the ""so-called Maidan council"". The same applies to the ""role of the radical nationalist forces, particularly Svoboda"" and their activities during the failure ""of the agreement to resolve the crisis in Ukraine of 21 February"".

The ""constitutional and democratic issues"" involved in the removal of President Yanukovych and the role of right-wing forces in his overthrow were also not adequately investigated by the ARD. In addition, there was no critical analysis of the role of politicians such as Julia Tymoshenko and Vitali Klitschko.

The council also challenged the station's coverage of the secession of Crimea from Ukraine. There was no proper investigation made of the procedure and legality of the Crimean referendum, its international legal status, the significance of popular participation in the vote, and the role of historical issues and the ethnic groups in Crimea in the secession process.

The criticisms raised by the committee are devastating, and confirm the assessment of the World Socialist Web Site, which wrote that news reportage on German public television had ""degenerated into nightly propaganda spots"". Rather than informing the public, the reports promoted the policy of the government, which has played a leading role in the conflict in Ukraine.

Whatever does not fit into the framework of official propaganda is eliminated: the content of the Association Agreement; the subordination of Ukraine to the dictates of the EU and the International Monetary Fund; the role of fascists in the Maidan protests; the toppling of Yanukovych in a right-wing coup; and the massive rejection of the new rulers in Kiev by the Russian-speaking population in the east of the country.

The council cautiously refers to a ""more or less subliminal transfer of opinion by moderators and reporters"" and the selective choice of reports, ""which even in the synopsis of all ten Ukraine hotspots fail to give a fairly comprehensive picture of the crisis itself."" In plain English, this means manipulation and censorship.

Television director Tom Buhrow is reported to have reacted in an ""extremely agitated and in part irreverent"" manner to the criticism raised by the Advisory Board. From ARD sources Telepolis learned that both Buhrow and television director Jörg Schönborn aggressively insisted on an editorial line to ""defend Western standpoints"". In other words, the one-sided reporting was ordered from the highest levels. &gt;From 2002 to 2006, Buhrow was head of the ARD studios in Washington.

Nothing is likely to change after the report. The station's deputy programme director, Thomas Baumann, vigourously rejected the council's charge of biased reporting and praised the work of the station's ""local correspondents"".

The reporting of the country's second main public station, the ZDF, is no better than that of the ARD. Web sites have compiled the numerous complaints from viewers detailing inaccurate and false reporting, including deliberate omissions of important information, selective cuts to interviews and conflicting standpoints in the same programme. Viewers have also criticised the lack of any comment on pictures of pro-Ukrainian forces sporting Nazi symbols such as swastikas, as well as and the trivialisation of the fascist Azov battalion, which is fighting on behalf of the Kiev government.

These reports make clear Germany's public broadcasters are being deliberately used to bombard the population with misinformation and deception about a war it overwhelmingly rejects.",0,1412275077,null,0,false,0,ckymfi3,t3_2hzerd,t1_ckymfi3,t1_ckxi2ql,null,1426716122,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

Ti sembra una domanda così banale ? Beato te, che ti devo dire :)

L'inflazione leggermente più bassa e una diminuzione dei salari del 6% sono sufficienti a spiegare il divario che si è creato in così pochi anni tra la Germania e il resto d'Europa ? Boh

Ma soprattutto, se la crescita tedesca e la crisi italica sono così tanto legate alla bilancia commerciale, come fanno i tedeschi a continuare a crescere mentre da 6 anni la domanda interna nell'eurozona è in calo e siamo tutti in deflazione ?

It's an expensive area of the country that attracts the richer Francophones driving out the local, poorer Flemings by economic pressure on the real estate market. It's not just French speaking Belgians, but also just French who come to live there to escape the French wealth tax and we know wealthy people who move to dodge taxes aren't that willing to integrate either. Don't forget that Brussels used to be 100% Dutch historically (Broekzele =&gt; Bruxelles) and the areas around it as well, but now it's only 10% Dutch in Brussels and 30-70% in the surrounding cities and ever decreasing. Any demographic shift anywhere would bring tensions.

It's quite complicated to explain the whole set of grievances; I'm not even sure I do myself as there are no French speakers at all where I grew up. Let's just say speaking French here wouldn't be a problem at all: just be kind and ask first if we speak it and don't continue in French or show displeasement if we'd say we don't (because if we do, we would unless too embarrassed for our mistakes and feel more comfortable in English)

I see this argument about the older generations holding us back brought up a lot, and it has some merit. True, previous generations may have outdated views. True, their experience may have baggage that is holding them back. But their opinions shouldn't be dismissed outright simply because they are older.

I can only look at my own life and acknowledge that my perception of the world and my political views have undergone a tremendous shift in my post college years. A number of my views now align closely with views I dismissed as insane or backwards just a few years prior to that. Often, after actually *listening* to what people in older generations were saying, I begrudgingly realized they were right along a broad spectrum of issues.

false,Zakerias,NETH,Swamp Germany,"Well, that's the difference I guess. I can only speak for the Netherlands and over here it's not just one generation ago, but many generations since Christianity was the sole source of morality. The stat that shows the 'Belief in God is required to have morality' is the most telling for me, because it is something very American to agree with.

The Netherlands used to be very segregated and very orderned. A hundred years ago our country was basically divided into four pillars: Christians, Catholics, Liberals and Socialists. They each cared for their own group, they had their own newspapers, radio stations, unions and political parties. Over time, they were forced to cooperate on various levels. Catholics formed coalition governments with socialist and liberals. Religious groups were fused together as the overal religious population shrunk and the various unions realised they were stronger if they worked together. Most people within these four pillars slowly realized that being a good person has little to do with political or religious beliefs. They started looking looking at eachothers beliefs and realized there was much common ground. Cooperation and 'reaching across the aisle' has and will be rewarded by voters. 

Nowadays, exposing someone powerful because of their personal beliefs or lifestyle (wether it be atheism or any form of religion) is very much frowned upon through all layers of society. Example: our current liberal Prime-Minister is single and a Catholic. This information is completely irrelevant for his job performance, no one in the opposition will ever use either aspect for political gain. On the other hand, our PM will never use the word God in a speech and all party leaders are very reluctant to use their family to increase their popularity. Giving in to either one of those things would be political suicide. When I look at the US, being a Christian and using it for popularity to advance your career is pretty much mandatory. I fully understand why this stings people that are atheist or something other than Christian.

Ils sont justement de Donetsk et Luhansk, villes bombardées par l'Armée Ukrainienne et non la Russie. La vaste majorité des réfugiés ont eux même choisi de rester en Russie de peur de repercussions si ils revenaient dans leur pays. En plus de cela, la plupart de leur foyer a été détruit, rendant le retour simplement impossible.

Beaucoup on perdu toutes leurs possessions. En particulier, des familles nombreuses dont les enfants ont des problèmes de santé. 

Les gouvernements à Berlin et Washington portent la responsabilité principale pour cette guerre. Ils ont soutenu un coup d'état en Février, aidé un régime droitier et pro-occidental à se maintenir au pouvoir, et ont de fait divisé le pays. Ils ont encouragé le régime de Poroshenko à prendre des décisions menant à l'assaut contre l'est de l'Ukraine, en le soutenant militairement.

Kiev a non seulement déployé l'armée régulière contre ses opposants, mais aussi les milices fascistes. Alors que l'armée bombardait des villes densément peuplées, ces milices ont terrorisé la population avec des actes de revanche, ainsi aggravant ces vagues de réfugiés.

Suivant le retrait de l'Armée Ukrainienne de certaines aires géographiques de l'est de l'Ukraine, il y a eu un certain nombre de signalement de charniers à ciel ouvert, qui contiendrait des corps de douzaines de séparatistes executés dnas le village de Nizhnaya Krynka. Ce village, situé au nord-est de Donetsk, a été pendant une longue période sous le contrôle de la Garde Nationale et du tristement célèbre Bataillon Ajdar, avant qu'ils ne se retirent il y a 2 semaines.

Mercredi, des observateurs de l'OSCE contrôlant le cessez le feu entre l'Armée et les séparatistes ont confirmé l'existence de deux de ces fosses. Elles auraient été trouvées dans la mine de charbon de Kolumar et une autre dans le village lui même.

Cette crise humanitaire dont je viens de donner un apercu a été largement ignorée dans les médias occidentaux. Aucune possibilité d'aide humanitaire n'a été en envisagée.

Les réfugiés ont reçu un soutien unanime dans la population Russe. Beaucoup de Russes ont des proches en Ukraine dont les vies ont été détruites par la guerre civile. Dans un acte de solidarité, des dizaines de millier de familles ont accueilli les réfugiés, alors même que la population Russe vit dans la précarité imposée par 20 ans de vol économique pratiqué par Poutine et Yelstine.

L'OSCE et le ministère russe des affaires étrangères ont émis leur souhait d'une enquête internationale. Il n'y a pas eu de réponse à cette demande. Au lieu de ça, le président de l'Assemblée Parlementaire du Conseil de l'Euroe (PACE°, ANne Brasseur, a annoncé qu'elle souhaitait faire sa propre évaluation de la situation.

Bien que certaines questions demeurent sans réponse, l'information confirmée jusqu'à maintenant montre clairement la brutalité employée par des organisations armées Ukrainiennes contre des gens suspectés d'être séparatistes et la population dans l'Est de l'Ukraine. Tout indique que les milices Ukrainiennes ont mené des exécutions massives de séparatistes désarmés et de civils. De telles activités s'insèrent dans un cadre global. On dispose de documentation détaillée sur la torture et les meurtres commis par ces organisations.


En Juillet, il y avait déjà des signalements de fosses communes dans Slaviansk, après que le gouvernement ait procédé a des captures. Andriy Lysenko, le porte parole de Kiev à la Défnse et la au Conseil de Sécurité avait dit que ""des centaines de corps de combattants rebelles"" ont été trouvé dans ces fosses. Le 10 Septembre, Amnesty International avait publié un rapport accusant le Bataillon Adjar d'abus sérieux et de crimes de guerres dans la région de Luhansk.

Dans son offesnive contre les séparatistes à l'est, le Gouvernement Ukrainien a confié nombre de tâche à ces bataillons, après que des groupes importants de combattants réguliers avaient refusé de pointer l'arme contre leurs compatriotes. Ces bataillons sont financés par des oligarques pro-occidentaux, et coopèrent ouvertement avec les forces fascistes qui étaient indispensable pour mener le coup d'état contre le Président Yanukovych en Février.

Les méthodes fascistes employées par le gouvernement Ukrainien et le reigne de terreur qu'il a établit à travers le pays indiquent clairement que son pouvoir n'a jamais eu aucun rapport avec la démocratie ou les droits de l'homme. Amené au pouvoir par un coup d'état orchestré par l'UE et les USA, le régime de Kiev représente les intérêt d'oligarques sans scrupule, qui, en alliance avec Berlin et Washington, espère établir des conditions encore plus favorable à l'exploitation des travailleurs ukrainiens.

La répression brutale contre les séparatistes dans l'est du pays est donc étroitement lié à l'imposition de formes de gouvernement autoritaires à travers l'Ukraine. Dans la ville de Kharkov, une manifestation pour la paix organisée par le Parti Communiste Ukrainien (qui avait rassemblé 5 millions d'Ukrainiens derrières ses appels pour l'unité) a été interdite au dernier moment. Alors que la foule se rassemblait pour faire entendre ses revendications, 23 personnes ont été arrêtées.

Le lendemain, des gangs fascistes et des manifestants pro-occidentaux se sont attaqué au mobilier urbain, aux boutiques, et ont renversé la statue de Lénine qui dominait Kharkov, au nord-est du pays. La réponse du chef de l'administration régionale, Igor Baluta, a été de légaliser le vandalisme ! 

Le gouvernement Ukrainien a annoncé la semaine dernière ses plans pour instaurer un service de travail national. Ainsi, les travailleurs, chômeurs, étudiants, recrues, et agriculteurs pourront être déployés contre leur volonté pour executer un ""travail socialement utile"", comme la réparation de garde-frontières, d'aéroports militaires, et de fortifications.

Le Président Poroshenko utilise des mesures dictatoriales et une terreur fasciste pour détruire les droits sociaux et démocratiques de la population et ainsi préparer son pays pour avancer dans l'intégration européenne. La semaine dernière, il a annoncé à Kiev qu'il aller porter une candidature pour intégrer l'Union Européenne en tant que membre d'ici 6 ans.

The system school is good for kids who have no problem of sitting still for hours, like to write and draw, ect. Long message short: it's made for most of the girls and the minority of boys. 

I have one kid in my class who is totally exhausting in class. He can't concentrate for two minutes, ist constantly moving around, is making little paper puppets, had an incredible fun with sneaking football player cards in my maths book (which was kinda sweet) and annoys everyone and disturbs all the time.

We were in a museum today, and he was a totally different kid. He was interested in everything, asked genuinely good questions, showed other kids, what he just found out and was just great.

false,Sleek_,null,null,"If I may ?  I'm feeling a strong vibe of problems to arise in 2017. 
Let me try to explain this : you aren't fond of living in France and really, really would like your wife to come live in the US. 
Could you give us more details, if you don't mind ? Like what is your and your wife's age ? How long have you been together and you have lived in France ? Is your wife from Lille? Is she close to her family or not so much ?
Your situation as I imagine it to be is quite normal for expatriate(s) that aren't willing to ""flee"" their countries. All the europeans that went to america for decades and now mostly (I guess) south americans were/are fleeing a poor country with few opportunities. You definitely aren't fleeing from the US. And your wife probably feels the same about leaving France.
Big issue to come : will I be able to convince her to redo her residency ?
We are not going to convince you France is great because that's just our biased opinion as French. As you have a (normal) biased opinion that your country is perfectly ok/way better. 

If I can give you some advice I would say : let's try to work it both ways : hypothesis one is she ok to go ?
You are asking her to redo, what, 2 years of residency. Basically being a intern/slave for a while when she already spent around 6 years of grueling efforts to become a doctor. In order to convince her you should take her to holidays to the US, and work it to be really pleasing. So she sees the US as a nice opportunity. Like arranging meetings with doctors so she realises she can make a ton of money in the US as a doctor. 
There is the childs angle to. Maybe she is 26, 27 years old ? Is she does residency again, plus 5 years to establish herself that's many years of postponing having a child, something, I have no idea, but maybe something she is willing to go into. 
That's one direction the other is, hypothesis two : may you become interested in living in France ?
Clearly the North, Lille, isn't the sexiest part of France. It was formerly a land of coal and steel, heavy industries steel oriented like trains and cars. 
Mines, steel disapeared and now the Nord-Pas de Calais is our rust belt, our Detroit. The climate is grey and the economy is grey. 
So maybe she should think about making living in France sexier for you by visiting France and letting you choose the area you like, be it Paris or the West, the East, the South, whatever.
If she is fond of her homeland then let´s see it with another angle. The bright side of Lille is that it´s relatively close to Belgium, the Nederlands, England. Maybe you could try to build up a career in your favorite field, marketing, rather than your nowaday path, teaching. 
You could invest some traveling to Brussels, Amsterdam or London to hunt for oppportunities with the dozens of american/ineternational  companies european headquarters that are there. On top of my mind I know that Stanley is in Belgium, as is Toyota, and Dorel and many others. They could use a bi-national guy with strong marketing credentials. You will have to travel a bit but one or two hours of travel to Brussels ain't a big deal for an american used to a larger land. 
Or you could embrace the teaching path, and look for a PhD maybe, so you have larger opportunities in teaching (although you are doing quite good moneywise by education standards : I'm not a teacher but in charge of a college level school, and I'm making around the same as you... FML...)
This PhD thing is about you entering a long term project, the same way as your wife is stuck by her career into long term projects, but with opportunities at the end. 
And finally if you stay here or she goes there, as you both are attached to your homeland you'll have to commit to going like once a year on holidays there. You have both to respect the sacrifice your SO is making and softening the blow by allowing this yearly stay in your country. 
I really hope you work it out. I'm really sorry if I sound condescending, feel free to PM if you would like to chat a bit more about your situation.

Progressive movements now are very much against the prohibition of almost any drug. 

I guess I see being ""progressive"" as being dangerously close to being behind whatever political fad is out there. It is very much subject to change. So whereas I agree with a number of things espoused by progressives now, I wouldn't identify myself as one due to the fickle nature of progressive movements in general.

Chomsky is trying to set the tone with an action item that has no correlation to democracy(or even in a simpler term- a right to vote) to an output that doesn't even exist.

So why is the middle east the way it is today? EXACTLY because of Chomsky's democratic ideal.

Look no further than the recent turmoil in Egypt. Here in the US was hailed as a MASSIVE VICTORY when the population there overthrew dictatorship for 'democracy', and what happened? They immediately elected the first religious demagogue than ran who was far more destructive, thus resulting in the re-overthrow of the 'democratically' elected Mohamed Morsi. Under democracy, the majority has absolute rule. With the false veneer of legitimacy accorded by elections, the Islamist majority initiated force against the non-Islamist minority by attempting to impose an Islamist theocracy, an Islamist dictatorship. Under democracy, minorities have no way to fight back against majority tyranny except through retaliatory force. Such is the unavoidable nature of democracy. How do you reconcile with a Muslim Brotherhood that believes its electoral victory is a mandate to impose tyranny?

 Any word from Chomsky? No comment...

Consider the election results in the Palestinian territories. For years, Bush had asked Palestinians “to elect new leaders, . . . not compromised by terror.” And, finally, in the U.S.-endorsed elections of January 2006, the Palestinians did turn their backs on the cronies of Yasser Arafat; they rejected the incumbent leadership of Fatah, and elected the even more militant killers of Hamas: an Islamist group notorious for suicide bombings. Hamas won by a landslide and now rules the Palestinian territories.

Just before that Hezbollah took part in the U.S.-endorsed elections in Lebanon, formed part of that country’s cabinet for the first time, and won control of two ministries.

Then to top it off there are the US-stationed elections in Iraq...

Is any comment necessary?

The US for the last 100 years had been on a campaign to 'Make the world safe for democracy'(even though we are not one) and sudo-intellectuals like Chomsky have reinforced this belief that democracy is ideal-That it is the moral high ground which is all that is required. We've let world thought and it has negatively affected europe, south america, asia, africa, and the middle east.

Why is this negative? Because Freedom and Prosperity is not derived from one's ability to vote. The choice is not flawed vs. unflawed democracy. The choice is democracy or freedom. Freedom is not the right to vote, Freedom in a political context is the freedom from force &amp; coercion from other human beings and only created by the protection of individual rights to life, liberty, and property. Which is the exact opposite of mob rule. The people's will rules! Anything goes as long as its voted for! Well you asked for it, and you got it brother... So take goddamn responsibility for your beliefs.

Now Chomsky's ridiculous comments on “Capitalism” he saves for last, a term he now uses to describe systems in which there are no capitalists by inventing the term “really existing capitalism”. Not minding to make any connection to the garbage he talks about during the first two pages. Not minding to define his loose vocabulary such as ""predatory capitalism""

He attempts to define ""really existing capitalism"" as ""what really exists and what is called ""capitalism."""" without defining what capitalism is, and what exists today. He tries to squeak by with this intellectual laziness by labeling the term ""capitalism"" as vague. Which is really just a declaration that he doesn't have the slightest fucking clue, nor does he wish to explain.

His ONLY ATTEMPT at context for these definitions are when he admits:

// ""It is commonly used to refer to the US economic system, which receives substantial state intervention""// 

Failing to state whether the common usage is accurate.... Is it to him? Who knows... and then covers himself with: 

//""It's worth bearing in mind the scale of the departures of ""really existing capitalism"" from official ""free-market capitalism.""""//

This still does not define what ""really existing capitalism"". 

Maybe the term this sudo-academic is looking for is a ""Mixed Economy"" - an economic system in which both the private sector and state direct the economy, reflecting characteristics of both market economies and planned economies. 

Since a private economy, based on property right, and free from government involvement is the basis of the term Capitalist. And we are(As he even admits) not that standard... WHY then does he insist on using the term, and then inventing a new one? 

So why all the confusion? Just another fog of war for this ""linguist"" to disguise the moral ideal of his democratic society as seen when he brings it back full circle:

//""Really existing capitalism - RECD for short (pronounced ""wrecked"") - is radically incompatible with democracy. It seems to me unlikely that civilization can survive really existing capitalism and the sharply attenuated democracy that goes along with it. Could functioning democracy make a difference? Consideration of nonexistent systems can only be speculative, but I think there's some reason to think so. Really existing capitalism is a human creation, and can be changed or replaced.""//

He offers a half-assed conclusion in the form of a question(as to seem more un-bias) - Could functioning democracy make a difference? 

No. 

And its important to point out... All political systems are human creations, and can be changed or replaced.

 The fact that Chomsky is taken seriously is a joke to scholarship.

 Oh here's another thought...   Lets use a good current event that Chomsky has yet to put his ignorant spin on. 

Hong Kong is the world's most economically free place in the world, so one could say it is the most Capitalist place in the world. 75 years ago it was a swamp fishing village with no national resources, and ever since it was allowed to be left alone only to protect property rights and maintain the rule of law - IE to prevent harm to a person's Life, liberty, and Property.

What happened? Within 75 years the tiny island of Hong Kong holds nearly 8 Million people, has more jobs and skyscrapers than New York City. Why? I thought Hong Kong had no natural resources... No it has one... Economic Freedom.

Now with all the protests in Hong Kong for democracy Chomsky should be pleased...

&gt;Firstly, the US needs to stop bombing Pakistan et al, because most ISIS recruits come from desperate people from these areas. There were very few islam fundamentalist groups like Al Qaeda before 2001 (mostly in Pakistan), only after US imperialism in the developing world started did they increase in numbers. Secondly, the US ally Qatar needs to stop funding ISIS. US shouldn't have funded ISIS to overthrow Assad's government in the first place. As you see, the solution lies in less violence, not more of it.

Right now, the US are funding Kurds to fight ISIS. Be prepared in a couple of years for the ""Kurd threat"" that the US will have to use force to eliminate. And when it emerges, do say the same things you're saying now.

That was in response to a [law the US passed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitsky_Act) banning Russian officials from entry who withheld medical treatment from a jailed whistle blower who spoke out about state corruption. The lack of treatment [caused his death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Magnitsky#Illness_and_death). An independent oversight commission declared that his death was likely not due to bureaucracy but rather most likely premeditated murder. 

American parents adopted a disproportionately large number of disabled Russian children. Russia's retaliation for the Magnitsky Act was quite literally taken out on mentally and physically disabled children. As with the food bans, adoption bans, and now this, it is pretty clear Russia is not overly concerned with hurting its own people to make a point.

He did try.  Ultimately, it was not an issue that he wanted to purse by any means necessary.  He had other priorities, like his health care law (Affordable Care Act) and reversing the Bush tax cuts for people making over $250,000/yr (which he did).

&gt;His pre-presidency speech on mass surveillance is a huge embarrassment today.

True.

It's hard to know whether he lied or was simply defeated by a powerful bureaucracy.  After all, who knows what info the NSA has on Obama?  It's possible that they blackmailed the president.

It's also possible that Obama realized that he would be blamed for any terrorist attack that might occur in America if he limited the NSA's power.  His opponents would have said that the attack could've been prevented if only Obama hadn't hamstrung the NSA.  This charge would be used against the Democratic Party in general and give a huge boost to the Republicans.  Perhaps Obama reneged on his plan to reduce the NSA's powers because he saw it as too politically risky.

Or maybe, once he became president, he saw intel that shocked him and made him genuinely change his mind about the NSA.  Perhaps seeing uncensored data on the number of disrupted terrorist plots made him honestly change his mind.",0,1412281321,null,0,1412281786,0,ckyptgv,t3_2i33u0,t1_ckyptgv,t1_ckyiif8,null,1426714386,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Odd how they are not concerned with much worse abuse inside Russia. 

&gt;According to various estimates, 50 to 95 percent of children who grow up in Russian orphanages become drug addicts or alcoholics or commit suicide...

&gt;----------------------------------------------------

&gt;the dead bodies of girls 15 years old and younger were discovered in Nizhny Tagil in 2008. A prostitution ring had kidnapped the girls and murdered them when they refused to become prostitutes. In the end, not a single criminal charge was ever filed in the case. Similarly, no criminal investigation was opened when four young women disappeared in Kursk in 2001. Nine years later, a person walking his dog discovered their remains. The girls had been raped and murdered by four young men. But the killers were released, in part because one of them was the son-in-law of a local Federal Security Service agent...

&gt;---------------------------------------------------

&gt;In Orenburg, 26 children were reported missing, yet only one criminal case was opened. In Perm, not a single case was opened in connection with any of its 27 missing children. Obviously, the official statistic that a child is 39 times more likely to die if adopted by Russian parents is an understatement.

&gt;---------------------------------------------------

&gt;Up to 60 percent of children in orphanages suffer abuse from their caregivers, and it is a rare occasion when someone serves prison time for crimes against children.

&gt;If a parent kills a child, both U.S. and Russian courts consider it the behavior of an individual psychopath. But when 60 percent of Russian orphans are abused by their caregivers, Russian ""society"" is blamed.

I'm not talking about austerity, I'm talking about harmonization of fiscal policies. Those policies could be austere or they could be expansive. I agree with you, there are alternatives to austerity. 

Spain, Grece and Portugal are in an unconfortable position, but slowly getting out of it. Others like France are running away from austerity while still being in a monetary union (currently a conservative one) and thus suffer from stagnation. There is no middle solution here, either you are in a union or you are not. If you are, you need to harmonise your policies to the rest of the union or you'll experience imbalances. 

The problem is, getting out of the union is no easy task right now. Who is going to finance a country that isn't backed by the rest of the Union? Every country would default, and that is serious trouble. (like, really really serious long term trouble)

What's wrong with improving what we currently have? Why must we rebuild borders and do our own thing insted of cooperating and being a true competitor in the world?

Ich würde das alles nicht persönlich nehmen. Wenn man die Erwartungen etwas heruntergeschraubt hat man da viel weniger Stress.

Das Arbeitsamt ist vielleicht nicht immer die beste Möglichkeit an Stellenausschreibungen zu kommen aber der beste weg (mal abgesehen von Verwandte und Beziehungen zu haben) hängt wohl von der Branche etc ab.

Als Tipp für die Bewerbung kann ich nur raten einfach mal nicht Doof zu sein. Das scheint nämlich eine Hürde für eine Bewerber zu sein nachdem was ich da 'von innen' gesehen habe. Bewerbungen und Lebenslauf schön geschrieben und formatiert. Nach Möglichkeit ohne Rechtschreibfehler, unpassenden Informationen und mit einer Email die seriös aussieht.

false,SomebodyReasonable,NETH,The Netherlands,"The fact that we, (and I say ""we"", because NL is a nine eyes partner anyway) so desperately need mass surveillance to stop terrorism is incredibly depressing.

Or at least the fact that we *think* we do. Mass surveillance depends on, you guessed it, surveiling *everybody*. Which in itself deals a bigger blow to freedom, democracy and transparency then terrorists could have ever achieved. 

Your assessment is pretty even-handed and plausible. There are some strange behaviors from Obama in early 2009 preceding a course shift; it bothers me. It happened around the time Obama began inquiring into CIA torture practices. Then again, he started saying ""let's look forward not backward"" pretty quickly.

In order to dismantle a surveillance apparatus as monstrous as ours, we need to convince the public in advance with a huge propaganda campaign that if a terrorist attack occurs, this may be because we choose not to fight terrorism with totalitarianism.

Most importantly, that 9/11 could have easily been prevented with the surveillance structure in place then (See footnote 44 of the 9/11 Commission Report).

Unless you deconstruct people's reactive and reflexive ""legislate the problems away""-attitude and decouple fear and indignation from the impetus for damaging legislation that normally exists, you cannot dismantle the surveillance system at all.

There must be a renewed commitment to the Constitution, rather than token gestures, lip service, and support for the Bill of Rights in words but never in deeds. A recommitment to the founding principles of the United States, along with a willingness to incur losses to the population due to attacks if necessary.

A better understanding of why 9/11 happened is crucial as well, because men like Keith Alexander and Michael Hayden unscrupulously exploit 9/11 to get support for their policies.

Around 150 000 people of Serbian ethnicity were removed from Croatia during Operation Storm. And they still have trouble getting back to their homes and their property. That's ethnic cleansing.

Carl Bildt, EU negotiator, even said that Croatia carried out *""most efficient ethnic cleansing in the Yugoslav Wars.""* While UN Special Representative Stoltenberg even requested NATO strikes against Croatian Army.

false,Bardaf,Zbelleile,Belle-Île,"Ben comme j'ai dit ailleurs, justement la restauration en interne était quand même un peu meilleure que dans la plupart des restos du parc. Mais oui, y a différents niveaux. Y a une cantoche dans un des bâtiments principaux, appelé Imaginations, qui est vraiment d'un niveau assez pitoyable je te laisse retrouver mon commentaire où je raconte ce qu'on a pu y voir. Un peu plus loin, dans un autre bâtiment appelé Baloo, mêmes menus, même prestataire (Eurest), mêmes ingrédients, mêmes prix et pourtant une qualité un poil au dessus. Alors pourquoi une telle différence ? Et ben parce que ceux qui mangent à Baloo, c'est principalement les cadres, les employés de bureau, et que ceux qui mangent à Ima, ce sont ceux qui sont costumés, les agents de sécu, les pompiers, etc. Y avait aussi des sandwicheries très correctes, et même de petits food trucks ces derniers mois qui se sont ajoutés à l'offre, mais ils étaient pris d'assaut. Et donc côté guests, la plupart des restos c'était un niveau en dessous de ce que nous faisait Eurest. burgers dégueus à 12€, nourriture digne d'une cantine scolaire pour 20€, sandwiches sous-vides, de la daube. Mais je m'appuie surtout sur ce que j'ai vu dans le parc 2, j'allais pas trop souvent au parc 1, mais j'y ai quand même vu le niveau décliner. Par exemple y a 12 ans j'aimais bien aller au resto en face du train de la mine, où tu trouvais du tex mex, avec pas mal de choix, pour un prix raisonnable, y a pas fallu 5 ans pour qu'on y trouve plus que des frites et des onion rings qui coûtaient une fortune.

De la même façon, un  très bon resto, avec buffet à volonté de produits de bonne qualité, dans l'hôtel à l'entrée du parc 1 est passé de 25€ en 2006~ à aujourd'hui 60€.

Heureusement, y a encore deux ou trois choses qui rattrapent le coup. Même s'il est assez cher, le tex-mex du Disney Village est vraiment pas mal, le dernier truc qu'ils ont ouvert, Earl of Sandwich, a pas mal de choix, à prix raisonnable et c'est vraiment super bon, et le Annette's Dinner à l'entrée fait encore et toujours de bons gros burgers à l'ancienne.",0,1412286392,null,0,false,0,ckysiq2,t3_2i39ic,t1_ckysiq2,t1_ckys2g4,null,1426713127,4,false,france,t5_2qhjz,4

&gt; I'm not talking about austerity, I'm talking about harmonization of fiscal policies. Those policies could be austere or they could be expansive. I agree with you, there are alternatives to austerity.

OK, I misunderstood what you meant by ""harmonization of fiscal policies"", thought you meant austerity.

&gt;Spain, Grece and Portugal are in an unconfortable position, but slowly getting out of it. Others like France are running away from austerity while still being in a monetary union (currently a conservative one) and thus suffer from stagnation.

I'm sorry but I really don't see how Spain, Greece and Portugal are getting better.

[Greece's economy shrank by 1.1 per cent in the first three months of 2014, and by 0.3 per cent during the second quarter](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-07/greece-set-for-return-to-economic-growth/5725198). They lost [10 years of growth](http://philippewaechter.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/greece-2013-q2-gdplevel.jpg). Umemployment still at [27%](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/unemployment-rate) despite [tens of thousand of Greek emigrating](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdde230&amp;plugin=1).

Spain sees a little 0,6% growth... fuelled by [5.5% of public budget deficit](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/30/spain-deficit-idUSS8N0PY01N20140930). Unemployment at 24% and [547,980 people left the country in 2013](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/01/spain-economic-recovery-rise-in-emigration).

Portugal has [4.8% of public deficit](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-09-30/portugal-s-budget-deficit-will-narrow-to-4-dot-8-percent-in-2014-ine-says) for 0.3% of growth.

I seriously see why my position convinces many.

We simply don't believe that the EUmarny will change its austerity policy, (remember what Juncker said?) so we'd rather get out.

&gt;There is no middle solution here, either you are in a union or you are not. If you are, you need to harmonise your policies to the rest of the union or you'll experience imbalances.

The middle solution would be to increase transfers within the eurozone to reach the equivalent of what is done in the US (2% of GDP).

&gt;The problem is, getting out of the union is no easy task right now.

Some think that it's easier than suiciding ourselves into austerity.

&gt;Who is going to finance a country that isn't backed by the rest of the Union?

Well I don't know about the other countries, but French households have more than 4000 billion euros in financial savings. They always paid for our debts. We paid the equivalent of 24% of GDP for reparations to Germany after 1871's war in 2 and a half years. We paid 67 billions of francs in 1918 (18 months of 1913's GDP). We paid again in 1944 for WWII, in 1952 for Indochina, in 1958 for Algeria, in 1973 for the first oil crisis, and again in 1977, in 1993 etc.

&gt;What's wrong with improving what we currently have?

Regardless, I'll explain the fundamentals in this subject, do you understand the basic concept of liquid mechanics?


If you keep pouring one liquid into another the result is an ever increasing mixture where its fundamental functional properties are changed depending on the mixture ratio, imagine anti-freeze poured into water for instance, the properties radically change in the mixture.


Pour in other liquids and the mixture becomes ever more complex with an ever more different functionality, most notably a guaranteed **non-functionality** in the end with enough mixing.


Some of the liquids will separate, some of the liquids will bond, sometimes there will be directly toxic and hardened layers formed based on the individual properties which cannot for the life of them mix together.

This all causing the whole idea of a universal mixed liquid an impossibility, stronger properties will essentially eliminate weaker ones, even a small amount of radical liquids and the mixture will surely become a powder keg.


The mixed liquid changes in its composition and also in certain situations it does not if the properties are mutually repelling or otherwise of completely different character, they separate or segregate, depending on the different functional properties and amounts of what is being poured in of course; Such that the mixture changes its functional properties as a whole, where it also as a resulting compound attracts some elements and fundamentally cannot intermix with others it could mix with before, changing behaviour completely.


The same rules apply in behaviours, aka. cultures, which are nothing but collections of functional values in a society for various purposes.


All these properties in liquids that I described can be translated to the struggle of cultures, ethnicity and **multiculturalism as an utterly failed and dangerous concept, an aimless over-mixture** so to speak.


In a multiculture you take all cultures you have in the world, pour them into a mixture in various amounts and then pretend the result has a unique useful function when there is none but one, it is called internal upheaval, an integral part of the concept of divide and conquer, it is used in modern times mostly for profiteering, in liquids the closest useful concept would be to intentionally neutralise other liquid properties.


The function of such a situation is of no use for any real purpose for a progressive society, a true progressive society relies on actual carefully weighed values rather than an fanatic culturally Darwinian approach which releases the whole concept of human rationality from the conscious human intellect into a fatalistic nonsensical design based more on faith, multiculturalism; Which is no better than asking ""god"" to sort things out where there isn't one, in essence it is the relinquishing of our ordered intellectual civilisation based on logical reasoning into pure chaos and hope it all turns out great.


If cultural enrichment is supposed to work, how does it work unless it changes the composition of ethnic peoples cultural values?

This requires the validation of cultures as compositions of functional values.

If cultural enrichment is supposed to work, does that not signify the opposite also being possible, thus that a cultural degradation is certainly something that can happen with the wrong elements mixed into it?


If segregation exists which it so obviously does, notably it wasn't a part of society before in such a significance as today, doesn't it tell us there are possibly all kinds of elements and factors in society which either work against or simply refuse to intermix, that the degradation of society is a modern concept?

Possibly a result of say... multuculturalism which directly shuns the idea of cultural values as universal functional necessary concepts, which virtually outlaws the idea of assimilation which is the only way to guarantee introduction into a society; Multiculturalism combined with mass immigration is certainly the culprit, there is a clear correlation here, only a naive soul, a corrupt propagandist or a sheer fool would argue it wasn't so.


What you and your ilk are saying is that cultural values are some magical entities which never change to the negative, always to the positive, and that the more they change the more positive they become, even when you outright might apply extremist values into a society and see rising crime rates and unrest reflecting those changes.

Ich mag nicht, wie sich viele immer aus der Verantwortung ziehen und alles auf den Gesetzgeber schieben. Jetzt losgelöst vom Thema selbst. Ich kann diese Einstellung zwar verstehen, aber sie nicht unterstützen. Klar hat der Bundestag/die Landtage die Aufgabe sich um so etwas zu kümmern, aber machen wir uns nichts vor, wenn er das (noch) nicht tut, sollte man nicht tatenlos danebensitzen.

Es gibt weitaus größere Interessenverbände also die Veggies/Veganer die versuchen bereits existierende Vorgaben durch den Staat umsetzen zu lassen (Problem in der Exekutive). Und das funktioniert schon viel zu selten. Gesetzlich gesehen müssten z.B. fast alle Raffinerien in Deutschland asap geschlossen werden. Viele Feuerwehrleute gehen mit 20 Jahre alten Jacken ins Feuerwehr, deren Zulassung seit 10 Jahren abgelaufen ist. Guck dir das Dilemma mit der Bundeswehr an. Gesetzlich dürfte so etwas gar nicht erst passieren.

Aber alles was Geld bringt läuft weiter (Raffinerien) und alles was Geld kostet wird nicht gemacht (Einsatzkleidung, Einsatzfahrzeuge, Gebäude, Personal, Waffen, Ausbildung) es sei denn es ist unbedingt nötig. Und das erreicht man nur dadurch, dass man der Exekutive dermaßen auf den Sack geht und Lobbyarbeit betreibt. Das alleine ist schon schwer genug. Jetzt stell dir das ganze eine Stufe höher vor, in einem Landtag oder im Bundestag ein Gesetz voranzubringen, und dann auch noch der zuständigen Exekutive auf den Keks zu gehen, bis sie sich dazu imstande fühlt das Gesetz auszuführen.

Ich habe bei dem hier angesprochenen Thema eine einfachere Lösung: Das einzige was m.E. nach hilft, ist, denen einfach kein Geld mehr zukommen zu lassen. Ich boykottiere es einfach. Und bin auch stark für eine Gesetzliche Regelung. Aber wie gesagt, dass geht nur mit genug Druck, und ich weiß nicht wie ich den erzeugen könnte...

Edit: Beim Thema Einsatzjacke sieht das allerdings anders aus, wenn ich mir die selbst kaufen würde, würde ich den Staat aus seiner Verantwortung entlassen, so weit gehe ich definitiv nicht. Also beiße ich in den sauren Apfel und tu es einfach. Versicherungsschutz hab ich ja Gott sei Dank noch. Aber bei dem Thema hier ist selbst tätig werden sowohl möglich als auch nicht zu schwierig.

Edit2: Nicht, dass sich nicht manche Feuerwehrleute ihre Jacken aus Sicherheitsgründen selbst kaufen... für 500€. Freiwillige Feuerwehr wohlgemerkt.",0,1412289903,null,0,1412290209,0,ckyu9zo,t3_2i2ub0,t1_ckyu9zo,t1_ckyax8q,null,1426712306,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

So you don't understand even the concept I am describing, this was worse than expected, I assume the saying ~'Don't attribute to malice what can be explained with ignorance.' is more true than it is given credit for.


Cultural values are inherently **functional**, they provide a function based on their inherent construct, since they have an **intended purpose**; As in they exist for an actual weighed useful purpose.


That you somehow believe we arbitrarily(?), accidentally(?) created values in society is one of the biggest mistakes you display, how do you believe we formed our society if not through intellectual discussion, wars against injustice and finally succeeding in the perpetual search for a progressive safe society; This created with an absolute purpose in mind with individual functional values of various magnitude which in turn form a working solution for said progressive society and allow it to exist, remove these individual functional values and see the whole concept crumble.


The whole liquids comparison was to illustrate the point more vividly and easily to those not familiar with multiculturalism as it is, and please spare me, the whole comparison is almost perfectly applicable to the subject.


What you're objecting to is logic, it's like a baby being angry for being tired and needing to sleep, it is inherently futile behaviour and affects me nor anyone with a critical mind not a bit; Logic doesn't change based on your words, it is a fundamental fact stated within a context, nor does the baby become less tired by becoming angry, it needs to sleep, so it eventually goes to sleep even if it is fuming.


In the end, your lack of understanding is of no concern to me, I'll leave you to believe(read: pretend to believe) what you will.

The number of verifiable false facts in Russian media is outrageous. People with differing views post in Western media as well.

This is kind of defense you use for old people and children. But fine: I'll concede the point that trusting iCloud with their private data wasn't stupid. It could have banking information or addresses and phone numbers that were stolen, so that part's not really their fault. But those can be partially or completely undone. You can't make millions of people *un*see your naked body.

&gt; This is a totally separate discussion, but OK:

That was supposed to be rhetorical, and the point was mostly to illustrate that it's not possible to punish every single person who leaked or shared the photos.

A leaked photograph is different from, say, leaked financial information. If someone uses the latter to steal money from their victims, it can be traceable. A photograph, and specifically these ones in question, are simply meant to be viewed. And you can exploit it infinitely, unlike passwords and bank accounts, which can be changed or closed.

If you happen to come across someone's emails, bank accounts, credit card numbers, etc. you can tacitly assume that they did not give you consent to view such information, nor would they ever, i.e. non-consent is implied. When you come across, say, nudes on 4chan or reddit, how do you know whether consent to view or circulate was given? You certainly can't contact the author to find out.

In the case of these celebs they have made public statements that they have not given consent, so sharing them is clearly illegal now, but what happens when this scandal fades from public memory and five years later you find these photos floating around somewhere on some imageboard?

&gt; They absolutely have the right to do so, and expect their privacy to be preserved. They weren't breaking any law or breaching anyone's rights. It's like when you are raped and someone tells you ""you shouldn't have been wearing those clothes in the first place"".

I have a right to hit myself in the head with a frying pan if I want. I wouldn't be breaking any law or infringing upon anybody. If I hit myself too hard and have a concussion, somebody in the hospital will probably tell me ""you shouldn't have been hitting yourself with a frying pan in the first place.""

&gt;That is not a fact, and I'm actually proving you wrong by telling you that I couldn't care less about their gender.

No, you'd be proving me wrong if you could show to me that *other people* couldn't care less about their gender. I could care less about their gender too, but if the victims were men there probably wouldn't be this level of controversy in the first place.

&gt; You are in fact the first person I've talked about this topic with who highlights their gender as a relevant factor.

Because it IS a relevant factor! The fact that they're young attractive women is the reason why people are hacking them and distributing their photos on the internet! Is it also surprising that it's the same reason why people are up in arms to defend them?

You see, different kinds of functional values exist in cultures to varying degree, even when looking at modern Russians and Americans they have a varying understanding of what a state is for, those are based on cultural values taught and influenced unto them.


Cultural values exist everywhere, everywhere you find an opinion you'll probably find some kind of cultural trace or angle of a more common value in that region.

These are not interchangeable for these societies, you cannot expect to retain the same functionality of the society when changing these values.


Why do you think Finland doesn't take in nearly the same number of immigrants as Sweden does?

Because their culture is functionally different and the people will voice their concerns if problems arise, in Sweden one shuts up because 'who are you to say otherwise'.


That is a clear cut cultural value with function, a somewhat bad one which has allowed this situation to even arise, but still relatively unique to Sweden and a good example in this discussion of a functional cultural value.


There are very few cultural values which propose no actual real function in society other than more or less aesthetic preference, and those are highly irrelevant in this subject discussion, whether you eat meatballs or not doesn't concern anyone and nobody has ever tried to take that choice away from people even when assimilation was used; Yet basically that is what you think what a culture is, a preference to eat meatballs and the demand everyone else do the same.


Values in general are very much functional in their purpose, this is only the tip of the ice berg of actual values which exist in various societies, some worse and some less so, but still all of them functional.


**According to your twisted logic**, racism can be interpreted to be just as important as anti-racism as a fundamental value in a multiculture, both are according to you interchangeable values with ...no important function, the fight against racism is thus a fight against multiculturalism as well.


Let me explain to you, the function of anti-racism is that there will hopefully be less racism as a result, the function of racism is that there will unfortunately be more racism.


Did this comparison make your head explode?


**What it all boils down to is cultural values are ideas, ideas have a meaning, aka. a function, hence cultural values are functional and not freely interchangeable.**

Not militaristic as in ""blatantly lockstep marching fascist"" militaristic. 

So a slight semantic misunderstanding perhaps, or not. Just my take. ""Militaristic"" as in ""a culture with a strong influence from its military due to its sheer size and scope alone"".

&gt;Edit : But do you have any proof that North Korea has an active martial culture like the US?

IMO: What they have is much, much more militaristic than anything in the US.

&gt; The Loyal Orange Institution, more commonly known as the Orange Order, is a Protestant fraternal organisation based primarily in Northern Ireland.^[1] It was founded in County Armagh in 1795 – during a period of Protestant-Catholic sectarian conflict – as a Masonic-style brotherhood sworn to defend Protestant supremacy. **Its name is a tribute to the Dutch-born Protestant king William of Orange**, who defeated the army of Catholic king James II at the Battle of the Boyne (1690). Its members wear Orange sashes and are referred to as Orangemen. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Order

&gt; Under the reign of Philip, **a true persecution of Protestants was initiated** and taxes were raised to an outrageous level. Discontent arose and **William of Orange** (with his vague Lutheran childhood) stood up for the Protestant (mainly Calvinist) inhabitants of the Netherlands. Things went badly after the Eighty Years' War started in 1568, but luck turned to his advantage when Protestant rebels attacking from the North Sea captured Brielle, a coastal town in present-day South Holland in 1572. Many cities in Holland began to support William. During the 1570s he had to defend his core territories in Holland several times, but in the 1580s the inland cities in Holland were secure. William of Orange was considered a threat to Spanish rule in the area and was assassinated in 1584 by a hired killer sent by Philip.^[3][4][6]

&gt; William was succeeded by his second son Maurits, **a Protestant who proved an excellent military commander.** His abilities as a commander and the lack of strong leadership in Spain after the death of Philip II (1598) gave Maurits excellent opportunities to **conquer large parts of the present-day Dutch territory.**

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Orange-Nassau#The_Dutch_rebellion

And that's how it all started...With the House of Orange. This is also why our football team wears orange.

So, unfortunately, there is a direct link from the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland all the way back to our protestant royal dynasty. They are displaying the colours of our royal family when they're doing their yearly march to annoy the Republican Catholics. 

""So true helpeth me God almighty"" is something people in Dutch parliament are required to respond with when they are sworn in. They can also respond with the secular phrase: ""that I promise"", but some members who you'd expect to be secular actually prefer the first variant anyway.

Mettiamo che sei un fotografo e decidi di scattare una foto alle Nutelle, poi la metti online/la vendi. Ora, tu non te n'eri accorto, ma nello sfondo si vede che la crema di nocciole Foobar è messa alla cazzo sui ripiani, contrariamente ai piani della ditta e magari addirittura con gli scaffali mezzi vuoti.

Qualche giorno dopo, quando irrimediabilmente quella foto sarà stata vista da qualcuno che non doveva, accadranno una o più di queste cose:

* il rappresentante della Foobar romperà il cazzo (molto) al caporeparto/direttore, chiedendo come mai la sua crema stia ricevendo un pessimo trattamento
* il direttore romperà il cazzo al caporeparto/il caporeparto romperà il cazzo ai suoi subordinati perché il rappresentante ha rotto il cazzo a lui
* la gente vedrà che il tuo supermercato è sporco/gli impiegati non riforniscono gli scaffali
* la madre del bambino che si intravede nello sfondo romperà il cazzo a tutto il mondo
* il direttore romperà il cazzo alla sicurezza perché non ti hanno visto che facevi le foto

Insomma, un po' tutti se la prenderanno nel posteriore. Certo, nulla di grave: principalmente si tratta di capricci da commerciali, ma si preferisce evitare.

Yes, certainly. However, I see this resemblance, if you know what I mean:

The second photo could be described as the representative for the Bible Belt. He's retired now, but just look at that face. He could be in that Orange March in Belfast.

&gt; While your royals and some members of parliament may regurgitate religious dogma, my perception is that the same is not true for the Dutch public at large.

True also.

&gt; Also, I see the Dutch as not caring for flashy materialism,

I dunno, this is more of a debatable thing. Older generations, no, younger, yes, but then again, that's true of almost any country, right?

&gt; nor classicism

Well, we do have a pretty annoying frat boy culture, to go into that is a book-sized exercise, but the classisism isn't as bad as in the UK. But it shouldn't be underestimated either.

https://stuwww.uvt.nl/fabras/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Fabras.jpg

There are hundreds of thousands of frat boys and girls like these in NL. They're destined for at least moderate wealth, the corps paves the way for that through the ""network"". 

&gt; which royalty, no matter how humble, would seem to violate. 

Well, it probably won't surprise you that Willem Alexander and his brothers (one of them recently deceased in a skiiing accident) could best be described as frat boys, and they were in the corps.

Long story, but they've had some antics mildly comparable to the UK royals.

&gt; Still, I'm surprised it has continued.

Prince Claus liked to break protocol, he was consumed by the gilded cage, as they say. He got Parkinsons. Willem-Alexander openly contemplated reform.

The royal family didn't always like the fact that life had been decided for them from birth. I can sympathize with that. Maybe it would be better for all involved if we got rid of the monarchy. But.. the House of Orange was a force of hope during the Second World War, this makes getting rid of it completely almost unthinkable.",0,1412311092,null,0,false,0,ckz42tk,t3_2i3jix,t1_ckz42tk,t1_ckz2q3j,null,1426707120,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

false,DrHenryKillinger,UNSA,United States of America,"I think with the South, and this is just pure speculation, there is a deep ""don't talk about religion or politics"" due to the very vivid issues that the South has had. 

Most people associate lynchings with blacks, and a majority of the lynchings were upon blacks, but a decent number were against anyone not of an Anglo-Saxon background, Catholic, Jewish or anything of the sort. Basically, in the late 1800s through the early 1900s if you weren't white with an English name and Protestant... you were potentially a target. This was mostly driven by the Ku Klux Klan. That was created not only to fight the integration efforts the US Government was placing on the South but also the droves of ""non-white"" migrants of Italian, Polish and Irish heritage and many of these ""carpet baggers"" were Catholic or Jewish. These opportunities were due to the great vaccum that existed in the South after the US Civil War and permeated generations of Southerners because of the negative connotations they brought with them. Many ""carpet baggers"" simply bought out the land and almost re-instituted slavery but for all races through tenant farming and share-cropping. You didn't belong to the ""landowner"" you simply were indentured, or basically, belonged to the land itself. 

Now. Of course most of these issues have died out and the last of the mongoloids have been shunned to the furthest recesses of civilization (they exist but they mostly just exist as outlandish callers on radio shows and are honestly mostly harmless at this point) but the issues that formed some of the violent and negative reputation the South got were mostly due to how the end of the US Civil War was handled.

DISLAIMER: This isn't excusing or blaming any side. Simply it was a horrible situation with a completely bankrupt and in many cases destroyed land that depended on agriculture. The people, including former slaves, of the South then paid the price of rebellion for decades and it burned a deep hatred in many of them.

Also, I was born in the South but both of my parents were from the North and only 1 branch of my family tree were even in the US for the Civil War. Most of what I've learned has been from museums that are undoubtedly biased but were telling the story of *why* many in the South were so bitter.

So, obviously, the way the midwest evolved in the ethos of the history (haha, I get it, the US doesn't have a history) of the US is a drastic comparison to the South. The South is ... complicated.

You'll find almost everything there, that's also where the local apple store is. It is in front of furniture store Ikea and bricolage store leroy merlin (the local home depot).

You can reach it by taking the M2 (green) metro line for ""gessate"".
Ride it until you reach the ""villa fiorita"" station. From there, take the Z305(-Di) bus for ""cologno nord m2"".

It will reach IKEA in Carugate at the 11th stop, which is on the opposite side of the road from the mall.

You should need a combined ""urban + 1 zone"" $2.50 ticket instead of the $1.50 one, but I never saw a ticket collector on a bus.

(in theory you could request an optional stop right at the mall)

use google street view beforehand to identify the store.

also, Moovit for android and iOS usually works quite well for public transport, as does ""milano bus live"" for android, just remember to disable the railway as an option. You can reach areas as far as 40km from milan without a car, the only downside being the hassle of having to check with those apps, and the ATM subscription, that needs to be paid in advance and tends to double in price the farther you need to go...

Esempio:

* La figlia, oggi 28 enne, è rimasta incinta del figlio 13 enne all'età di 15 anni  
* Il figlio, oggi 13 enne, è diventato padre facendo diventare la madre una nonna di 28 anni e la nonna una bisnonna di 43  

Insomma, una storia rara ma non impossibile.  

**My two cents**:  
Dalle reazioni della nonna (*«C’è chi pensa che un figlio a 13 anni significhi rovinarsi la vita – hanno detto – ma per noi non è affatto così»*) posso intuire che la gravidanza in età precoce sia vista in ""quella famiglia"" come un fatto normale ed il perchè si può ben intuire dai dati che ho ipotizzato qui sopra.  

Altra possibilità è che ""la nonna"" di cui si parla nei giornali sia in realtà la madre del 13 enne.

Like ThreeFrontStreet said, it is likely that the main reason for their departure was fear of reprisal for their own crimes. Not that that's a justification for an eye for an eye or whatever, but we're not exactly talking about the Croatian military herding them out of the country or whatever. They left out of their own volition, albeit because of fear that they felt, as well as the fear that their own leaders deliberately instilled in them.

Was that fear justified? Honestly, I don't believe it was, at least not on a mass scale(there would've been individual crimes by angry civilians or some rogue soldiers, unfortunately, I'd say, but such things were never ignored, but prosecuted). However, propaganda had done its work - the same propaganda about ""Croatian nazis"" and such that enabled them to be manipulated into a war by Belgrade. It's sad, really, that they commited such atrocities, but were all the while being used by others for their own goals.

To be completely frank, though, I also admit that the Croatian leadership hardly would've objected to them leaving, and frankly I don't really blame them in a political sense(I would if they did it on purpose though), what with how the whole war was handled by the other side and a civilian populace that was, **IMO**, mostly complicit. Frankly, given a choice between a populace that won't kill each other and one that will, if I were a politician, I'd choose the former. Of course, I'd never set about to achieve it deliberately, though, or overlook it if someone was doing the same. Oh and, to their credit, the government at the time inacted a generaly amnesty for the war(excluding war crimes of course) for all who participated on the opposite side. Let that stew a bit.

**Frankly, I'd like to hear you say what you would've done had you been President of Croatia then.**

Also, it's necessary to say that Croatia has spent a fuckton of money in order to help people return to their former homes, and even though some have, many haven't. I haven't really noticed much discrimination on a national basis here, so that can only lead me to believe that some either don't want to return, or might just have something to be guilty about, seeing how their non-Serb neighbours might have an idea about what they'd have been doing in the war.
Honestly, I don't really see what's stopping anyone from returning, other than perceived fear, whether for a reason or not, but I am sure that we are putting in more than reasonable efforts to facilitate the return of those who wish it.

All of this is mostly speculation on my part, to be fair.

P.S.

I am not mad or anything, not even mildly irritated. :p

false,SomebodyReasonable,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; I would have appreciated it if you would just have posted the two articles that were about the issue of reverse flows instead of wasting my time.

I wanted to educate you properly, since you knew nothing when you started.

&gt; In any case, the relevant articles do indicate that Gazprom's clause entail an anti-competitive clause. And mots of these kind of clauses are under EU trade law not legal anymore.

Don't pretend you are knowledgeable in the matter.

&gt; However, all of these articles are concerned about whether private companies are allowed to resell Russian gas.

No, not really.

&gt; The fact of the matter still remains that Gazprom deals with sovereign nations

No, not really.

&gt; yes, it does make a difference 

No, not really.

&gt; a nation is not a citizen or a company that falls under these relevant trade laws. 

Complete nonsense.

&gt; So Gazprom can most likely put into its contract whatever it wants

No, it cannot.

&gt; whether a nation uses companies as a front to breach this contract doesn't really matter.

This ""concern"" of yours is entirely fictitious and of your own making.

&gt; Is it fair from a free trade perspective? Maybe not. 

Who cares? Your concerns and arguments are based in fantasy. I've rarely seen more audacious humbug attempted, that I must admit.

&gt; Also, Gazprom's destination clause is completely different from the kind of resell clauses that are the target of the EU anti trust laws.

This shows you haven't even studied the links.

&gt; Gazprom's clause says you must use the gas in your own nation. The resell clauses envisioned by the EU trade law are really different in nature.

No.

Now show me you have a modicum of intelligence and/or intellectual integrity and cite me a body of reliable sources supporting your ridiculous fantasies. I don't know why it is you think I must quote sources and you can just babble on and on without any *reliable* sources to back up your claims. See Wikipedia for a guideline on what reliable and verifiable sources are.

Also, this confirms my initial suspicions about you were correct.

Ca parle BD, SF, films, littérature etc, avec énormément d'érudition. C'est pas un simple podcast d'amateurs, on sent bien que l'animateur et les chroniqueurs sont des pro super cultivés.

Notamment, la dernière émission sur Denis Bajram (l'auteur de la BD Universal War One et Two) me fascine. Le mec a écrit à 27 ans d'un seul coup le scénario de sa BD, en trois fois 6 tomes, et depuis il la dessine tranquillement. Ca fait maintenant quasiment 20 ans, il en est à la moitié des 18 tomes prévus. Je trouve ça incroyable de s'être tracé son destin comme ça et de s'y tenir.

Die alteingesessenen Staatssekretäre und Beamten haben da schon so viele Minister kommen und gehen sehen, jemand ambitioniertes ändert da gar nichts. 

Vdl trat ja an mit der Ansage frischen Wind in den Laden bringen zu wollen, feuerte auch erstmal fröhlich ein paar Alte und holte, wie in der guten Vetternwirtschaft üblich, eine Bekannte von McKinsey ins Boot. ""Denkste!"" dachte sich daraufhin die seit 40 Jahren dort vermodernde Belegschaft und zeigte ihr erstmal wie man korrekt in ein Messer läuft.

Praktisch nichts funktioniert seit die dort an der Spitze steht.

Aber warum steht sie dort eigentlich? Erinnern wir uns an die Zeit nach der Wahl als wieder Inkompetenzroulette gespielt wurde, wer denn nun in welchem Ministerium den meisten Schaden anrichten kann. 

Zu der Zeit gab es ja nur noch einen Anwärter auf Merkels Thron, insbesondere nachdem de facto Thronfolger de Maizière(man schaue mal in die Vergangenheit der Familie, schauderhaft) ja gerade sein persönliches Drohnendesaster erlebt hatte. Die Superuschi nämlich. 

Wollte die ins BmVg? Ne, die Merkel lobbierte dafür, lullte sie ein, sie brauche eine vertrauenswürdige und starke Kraft im Verteidigungsministerium, jemanden auf den sie zählen kann. Die Transatlantikerin war ganz begeistert und nahm an, unter der Bedingung das dies erstmal geheim blieb und man dann nach der Wahl groß Überraschung rufen konnte. Die Medien waren ja vorher schon gebrieft, Friede ließ da nichts anbrennen, Mutter der Kompanie etc.

Warum aber setzte Merkel ausgerechnet Zensursula, die sich ja durch ihre Karriere hinweg als hochgradig inkompetent erwiesen hat und ausschließlich von der Presse hochgejubelt wurde, auf diesen Feuerstuhl? Nun, Ursel war ganz scharf auf den Sessel von Angie und galt als letzter Thronfolger. Hochintrigant und zum Dolchstoß jederzeit bereit. Mehrere verlorene Landtagswahlen, Europawahl oder ähnliches und Ursel hätte Gift in Merkels Kaffee geschüttet. 

Also traf Angie die Entscheidung die Hexe ins BmVg zu setzen um ihr mal korrekt die Flügel zu stutzen.

In der Phase sind wir gerade und es ist ziemlich sicher, dass VdL die ganze Sache noch mehr verhunzt als der Guttenberg, der ja auch gottgleich als Thronfolger dort startete, im schweren Flakfeuer aber erst Dellen und Kratzer, dann schwerste Schäden davon trug und sich letztendlich selbst mit seiner Doktorarbeit entsorgte.

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Wow those people have access to foreign media and still believe everything their government tells them. What the hell?

Sorry mate, but seriously what experience you think we had with *Western Media*?

Let's go back to the 08.08.08. What happened then in reality? What did your Media reported?

Let's go the Minors Protection Law. What Western Media reported this law was against? And right now [where are](http://turboportal.ru/uploads/posts/2014-03/1396003941__.gif) those thousands of lgbt people being prosecuted for who they are?

Let's go to the Olympics what with all that poison that your media posted? And later [more and more](http://gossipsochi.com) things resulted to be a lie - but mostly noone cared because the event has passed, almost no media apologized or posted a refutation article.

What happens in Ukraine? And what you media (mostly) posts? Mostly reposts from Ukrainian media:

1) Odessa massacre - perhaps one of the best video-documented mass-slaughter. Mostly presented either ""*we don't know what really happened there*"", either ""*it's all their fault*"", because peaceful protesters in the square somehow are related to violent clashes kms away and this is used as justification to touch them alive and kill them. 

2) Cities held by rebels in Donetsk are being shelled: ""*We don't know who really shells them, maybe it's Ukrainian army who is sieging the city or maybe rebels are bombing their own positions... We really don't know*""

3) MH17 was downed above Donbas skies - ""*clearly rebels or Russian army doing, no proof needed*"".

4) ""*Russian army is invading Ukraine in Donbass*"", again no proof needed. For sceptics we will misquote Putin about self-defence forces in Crimea.

So... After all this people who has opportunity to read Western Media, and thanks to web pages like inosmi.ru almost anyone with internet access has that opportunity. How are we supposed to trust them? 

Right now, in Russia we respect some German, Spanish, French, and rarely Polish papers, because they post what we see as neutral articles about situation in Ukraine. But those are exceptions. The general rule is that your media just reposts everything Ukrainian media says which is not clearly false but not own investigation is done (like when their Minister of Defense, Geletey, said recently that Russia nuked Ukraine - that wasn't reposted I think).

But we don't need those reposts - we can already read the originals (which is mostly published in Russian and most of us can read Ukrainian). Also 1 in 4 Russians have close relatives in Ukraine, and half of us have distant relatives or friends there. We just have better picture than you do.",0,1412326798,null,0,1412327632,0,ckz7zrq,t3_2i49kb,t1_ckz7zrq,t1_ckyt5pj,null,1426705126,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

First, I didn't state anything about the effectivity of the methods, just that's in our interest if we manage to do so.

Second, you're cherrypicking. We certainly have succeeded in promoting peaceful development in places and times, take for example Eastern Europe.

&gt;China is both stable and peaceful as it is.

Are you mad? They have to suppress revolts of hundreds of thousands of people manu militari.

Dipende dal tipo di preparazione. In alcune la qualità degli ingredienti base è fondamentale per la buona riuscita e se non è ad un livello adeguato si sente subito al palato. Nel caso invece di preparazioni più elaborate, con le tecniche culinarie e i condimenti si può mascherare un po'. Immagino che quelli del DILL restaurant abbiano percorso la seconda strada.

Frankly if you would ask the first question around here people would be perplexed: what, it means I can have of these two, really?

The second question would be similarly hard to interpret. What is success, if I got a good job because a friends friend owed us a favor and hired me, is that success? 

For the third question, heh.

Fourth even what? We always think we are inferior, except a for a few guys who would like to bring back the badass horse archer years.

Fifth, hard to answer because as _faith_ I think few people here care, but as a part of a national identity as a country built on traditions that are catholic, I think more people care. Textbook example is Catholic processon on 20th August with King Saint Stephens hand: it is not about god, it is just a way to celebrate the birthdate of a country. I don't think guys from the US Bible Belt would undestand how can religious  ceremony play a role yet without faith...

I think zero people would think morality depends on God, people would think morality depends on having decent upbringing - and then some would think putting some religious stuff into an upbringing helps it, but it would be still the habits acquired through that and not God in itself. This is actually interesting: do people who think morality depends on God in places like America really believe morality is something you **choose**? I think morality is a habit your parents instilled in you! Morality is not a conscious thing IMHO. It is not like ""I won't steal this because God or because ethics"". Who does this? It is more like ""I won't steal it, I was not raised that way"". 

Homosexuality, I have no idea because acceptance and rejection are not clear terms. If it would mean ""you can no longer make fun of guys who behave like a princess"" I think many would dislike it. If it would mean ""let them have registered, legal relationships"", most people would be OK they already have it. Calling it marriage, currently not but I don't think many people care either way. Adoption may be harder to accept as quite some people would fear molestation especially after the catholic gay priests scandal.

Aridaje. Le informazioni contenute nel libro erano parziali, incomplete e incorrette. E costituivano, per questo motivo, concorrenza sleale illecita.

L'autore aveva scritto delle chiacchiere da bar, che come tutte le chiacchiere da bar mischiano qualche cosa vera con un milione di semplificazioni e approsimazioni. Che combacino con le cose che sai tu mi sembra normale. Solo che tu non ci scrivi un libro sopra, senza prima avere dei dati più seri rispetto a quello che ""si dice in città"".

&gt; Are you mad? They have to suppress revolts of hundreds of thousands of people manu militari.

You may not have noticed, but China is kind of large, and as a whole - it is *extremely* stable and peaceful.

Implying that it's somehow in chaos over protests in Hong Kong is silly. The scale of what's happening in Hong Kong relative to China is the same as the scale of what was happening in Ferguson relative to the whole of United States - a blip that the outside world, and even most of the US public, did not really concern themselves with.

&gt; They're people. If we see it fit to give a hand to the people who are on the streets demanding more democracy, then I don't see ""it's a different culture"" as something that invalidates that.

I do not see it fit until such a time comes that the *majority* of people in China oppose their government and demand more democracy, and even then I would probably not see it fit because it's so far outside our sphere of influence and people in the west are generally ignorant when it comes to how China ""ticks"" as a society.

Rasmussen received a coveted term at the wheel of NATO, the Obama administration secured a NATO leader firmly aligned with U.S. political interests, NATO was spared from obsolescence, and Turkey was able to eradicate one of the Kurd's few avenues of free speech.

The entire history of post Cold War NATO has been a series of shady *quid pro quos* to keep an obsolete alliance spearheaded by the U.S. alive so it can satisfy American national and corporate interests.

&gt;Just a reminder that everything said by a man who lied to Danish parliament, saying there isn't a shred of doubt that Iraq has WMDs ([""This is not something we just believe. We know,""](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3629311.stm)), should be taken with at least a grain of salt.

&gt;Just don't create too much problems for the man, otherwise:

&gt;&gt;Frank Søholm Grevil (born in 1960) had the rank of major in Forsvarets Efterretningstjeneste [FE] (Danish military intelligence agency).

&gt;&gt;On February 22, 2004 he acted as a whistle blower leaking classified information about the FE's assessment of the possibility of weapons of mass destruction [WMD] in Iraq. The analysis of FE concluded that there was no certain information about operational weapons of mass destruction.[1] This was not aligned with the statement of Danish prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen to the Danish parliament that there was evidence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.

&gt;&gt;...

&gt;&gt;Frank Grevil was sentenced to four months in jail for leaking these documents.

I mean for example I have no idea if my grandfather was theist or atehist. He went to church for a while because it was simply the custom. Then had a fight with the priest and then did not go. 

I don't think he ever spent 2 minutes thinking about whether there is a god or not. He sometimes said ""leave bread baking to bakers, leave prayer to priests"" it is their job, he does not need to even care or think about it. But he never explictly said he is atheis. Rather, he was more like **it is above his pay grade to make a grand decision like there is a god or there is no god** and as for him he can only decide what he likes to do on Sunday morning.

This is why I don't understand the term ""atheist"" in America means, I mean, why does it even matter what you believe in in your private head, and why do you even have to have an opinion? Why doesn't that matter more if you fulfill the social obligation or custom to go to church or not?

Or is it more personal and less social or how it works?

Can't a guy simply be church-going or not church-going without even really thinking about and having to personally decide what is like really the biggest question in the universe?

We are willing and able to fight ourselves. We literally had... an Army only on paper as of February-March of this year.

The volunteer battalions that were in Kiev in February, during the revolution; both the protesters and riot police, bitter enemies, united against a foreign invader of our Fatherland.

The massive problem; we have nothing to fight with. These volunteer battalions often fight tanks with nothing more than an AK and grenades. The Army, which does have some Soviet leftover equipment, is still bogged down by our chronic corruption, and communication/logistics are mostly provided by our own citizens and ex-pats donations. Sad and fucking infuriating state of affairs.  

Nonetheless, we were days away from totally crushing the ""separatists"" (Moscow funded/armed/controlled/commanded), and now are fighting the regular, Russian army. Again, with Soviet left over equipment, and donations from patriotic citizens/expats.

And we're still holding our own. The constant shelling racks up a lot of casualties among our troops, but otherwise, we are actually winning. 

With hand-me-down weapons and donated Polish/NATO kevlar. 

Ukrainians don't want or need Europeans or Americans fighting our fight. What we do need, in this pretty fucking chaotic state our country is in, is tangible, military aid.

Seal the border shut, fortify it DMZ Korean style, and viola. The fucking ""people's republics"" rats will flee back to the Moscow sewers they crawled out of.

What can be said; if it is happening, then marginally.

So far, it's Soviet hand me downs, and what our military industrial complex managed to churn out over the last few months.

As a civilian, I can confirm that beyond NATO, I would say that the biggest help is unofficial, civilian purchased aid. Again, mainly by citizens and expats, but it wouldn't be possible w/o the help of countries that actually give a shit. Poland being in the lead. Because proper armor is literally a matter of life and death of our soldiers, and if it wasn't for our neighbors bending the rules and helping in ways that they can; we wouldn't be able to hold our ground. It literally is one of the biggest decisive factors, and we wouldn't be able to do it w/o the help of our European neighbors. (US and Canadian Army surplus as well, our transatlantic bros). 

EDIT: Just for clarification; the aid I mention from Poland and other European countries is strictly proper Kevlar body armor and helmets. As in non-lethal aid. It has played a HUGE role in the conflict, saving countless lives.

And the same could be said about HR in the US. And yet things like guantanamo and routine daily torture happened (not counting that many prisonners here are innocents...); because nobody cared to defend ""those pesky human and civil rights and stuff that only get on our way to conduct business; let's ignore those all together like we are the fuckin KGB because those aren't human but subhuman terrorists so we can do wtf we want with them"" there after all those years.

Just because UK has a good XXst century history doesn't mean they can suddenly afford to ignore human rights, i'm sorry. Especially in light of what happened post 09/11; during which the UK frolicked in the mud just as much as the US.

Discarding HRs is a very dangerous slippery slope. You're attacking the very foundation of *unalienable rights granted to all humans* by very definition.

Der Westen hat Israel dort platziert, der Westen hat die Grenzen dort ohne Rücksicht auf ethnische Gruppen gezogen wie er es für richtig hielt, er hat dort Putsche in den wenigen Demokratien angezettelt, Diktatoren eingesetzt und gestützt, Terroristen mit Waffen versorgt, Länder grundlos mit Krieg überzogen, Diktatoren zum Krieg angestachelt, ...

Die Geschichte ist endlos. Alles was versucht wurde war schlicht und ergreifend falsch. Es gibt nur einen weg aus all dem raus und diesen weist das Völkerrecht. Es wird sich nicht in die Angelegenheiten souveräner Staaten eingemischt. Nicht in Libyen, nicht in Syrien, nicht im Irak, nicht in Afghanistan, nirgends.

Dann herrscht da eben Steinzeitaberglaube. Dann herrscht da eben Sharia. Mit Nordkorea hat auch niemand ein Problem obwohl die Menschenrechtsverletzungen auch dort massiv sind. 
Der Westen muss davon wegkommen immer zu glauben er wisse was besser für andere Menschen ist. Die ganze Medizin die er dem Nahen Osten verabreicht hat machte diesen nur noch kranker. 

Auch sollte er endlich sein doppeltes Spiel aufgeben. Wenn ich den Terror trocken legen will, gibt es ein ganzes Arsenal politischer Maßnahmen. Wir könnten bspw. aufhören denen Öl abzukaufen. Tun wir aber nicht. Wir könnten aufhören Öl von den Finanziers zu kaufen. Tun wir aber nicht. Wir könnten aufhören Waffen an die Finanziers zu liefern. Tun wir aber nicht. 

Selbst wenn man Krieg als ultima ratio bezeichnet, ist es in diesem Fall alles andere als das. Man springt direkt zum Krieg ohne irgendwelche anderen Mittel ausgeschöpft zu haben. Es existieren härtere Sanktionen gegen Russland als gegen den IS.

Auch das Argument, da gehen sonst unzählige Menschenleben verloren ist absolut scheinheilig. Durch Krieg sterben immer weitaus mehr Menschen als durch irgendeinen Machthaber oder den IS.

Man muss einfach zu dem Punkt kommen an dem man sagt: Schluss! Wir werden Menschenrechtsverletzungen nicht mehr durch Menschenrechtsverletzungen verteidigen. Wir werden das Völkerrecht nicht mehr durch den Bruch des Völkerrechtes schützen. Wir hören auf. 
Tut uns leid was wir angerichtet haben, wir lagen falsch.

Dann kann man sich darauf konzentrieren Hilfe zu leisten, die Flüchtlinge aufzunehmen, Demokratiebewegungen friedlich zu unterstützen, den Menschen Alternativen aufzeigen. Über kurz oder lang bricht dann auch der islamische Staat zusammen, wenn man denn eine bessere Perspektive bieten kann. So lange wir das aber nicht tun, sondern immer nur noch mehr Öl ins Feuer gießen, werden solche Konstrukte wie der IS massiven Zulauf und Sympathien genießen. So lange wir uns mit den Hintermännern bestens verstehen wird deren Unterstützung für die Terroristen nicht enden. 

Asien macht in dieser Hinsicht alles richtig. Raushalten, gucken was man denen ökonomisch zu bieten hat, was man dort abgreifen kann. Ohne eine Patrone zu verschießen. Wenn die Interessen des Handelspartners eben steinzeitlicher Natur sind, sei es drum, andere Länder, andere Sitten.

Der Westen hingegen muss bomben. Alles, jeden, jetzt. Völlig unsouverän, wie das fette Kind im Sandkasten, dass die anderen Burgen kaputt tritt, nur weil es in diesen eine Gefahr für die eigene Herrlichkeit erkennt. 

Der Westen und der Nahe Osten sind im großen was Israel und Palästina im kleinen sind. Ein ewiger Konflikt in dem der eine nicht begreift, dass Bomben nicht die Lösung sondern das Problem sind. So handhabt der Westen das auch. Er merkt nicht einmal, dass die Regierungen von knapp über 6 Milliarden Menschen überhaupt kein Problem mit dem Nahen Osten haben, sondern dass nur der Westen dort ständig interveniert.

No, this defense is valid for everyone. You can't assume that everyone is versed in the dangers of technology, because the majority of the population simply is not. It would be for old people and children if this was a matter that everyone except those groups could safely be assumed to know about.

&gt; You can't make millions of people unsee your naked body.

Nobody said otherwise. Those people are the victims to a crime with consequences that can't be undone.

&gt; That was supposed to be rhetorical, and the point was mostly to illustrate that it's not possible to punish every single person who leaked or shared the photos.

The difficulty of applying punishment doesn't change the illegality of something, nor switches responsibility away from the criminals doing it.

&gt; I have a right to hit myself in the head with a frying pan if I want.

That analogy doesn't work. They have a right to take nude photos of themselves in private AND have their privacy preserved; you don't have a right to hit yourself with a frying pan AND don't hurt. In the latter case hurting yourself is a direct consequence of your action, while in the former it's a direct consequence from a crime committed against you by other people. Also, almost everyone can be assumed to know the dangers of self-harm (at least the direct ones), while as discussed that's not true for the dangers of technology.

&gt; No, you'd be proving me wrong if you could show to me that other people couldn't care less about their gender. I could care less about their gender too, but if the victims were men there probably wouldn't be this level of controversy in the first place.

Well, you said that's the reason anyone cares. I'm someone. Also, whenever I've talked about this in the past the conversation has always circled around consumer protection, without regard for the gender of the current victims.

&gt; Because it IS a relevant factor! The fact that they're young attractive women is the reason why people are hacking them and distributing their photos on the internet! Is it also surprising that it's the same reason why people are up in arms to defend them?

It isn't a relevant factor to the discussion of where responsibility lays, or if that was a good decision from the knowledge that they had when they did it. Many people are up in arms because we care about consumer protection, and think that being informed about absolutely everything shouldn't be necessary to be protected.

&gt; ""Gee, I'm gonna take a topless photo of myself and send it to my boyfriend! This could never backfire in any way that could potentially haunt me for the rest of my life!""

From the standpoint of someone not technologically versed, if they trusted the other person, that would have been a perfectly reasonable assumption. Imagine that a poisonous medicine has slipped past state controls; a chemist could look at the victims and think they made a stupid decision ""gee, I'm going to ingest a compound that mixes components X, Y and Z! no way it's going to kill me!"", yet that decision wouldn't be dumb from the standpoint of someone not versed in chemistry.",0,1412335120,null,0,false,0,ckz9h3b,t3_2i2ui8,t1_ckz9h3b,t1_ckywe65,null,1426704435,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

La prova che si tratti di mero populismo a fini economici e non di reale tutela degli animali è visibile nel fatto che si da contro la ricerca (che usa qualche centinaio di migliaia di animali all'anno) e nessuno dice nulla contro la derattizzazione (che stermina decine di milioni di animali all'anno).

That is not to say of all the other shit you will need, including **extremely rapid** deterioration of trade and political ties will almost entirety of globe (even less money, goods, technologies etc). 


As of right now, Russia is so-so, kind a stupid and weird in its actions with its *somewhat stealthy* war in Ukraine, but nothing really that outrageous or insane as in occupation, deportation and all the other stops. 


There is a difference in support of Putin (i would argue that 85% number is bullshit in one way or another, but i can't prove it and its just a general feeling that the picture which is portrayed by polls is inaccurate/misleading). Nonetheless Russians may see Putin as somewhat ok'ish figure in our *current political climate*, but there is very little support for actual war.


Last couple things - 1st i would like to give 3dom a benefit of the doubt in his ""forecast/vision"" and point out that he (in the same way as i am) is just a random Russian Netizen, thus he can easily be just as wrong as any other guy. Flair does not give an immediate prove that the person who is speaking is in fact knows what he is talking about or has any sort of ""insider knowledge"" of situation inside Russia. 


If its offensive i would like to apologize, but he states that he wrote a blog, but cannot provide proof of that because he is in Russia (which implies he is scared for his life, which is fair i guess), but at the same time he is leaving Russia from what i can remember for at least half a year already. 


Last point, current Russian developments *in my personal opinion* has more to do with crushing local dissent in an **extremely** troubled economic times ahead. Russian economy is in trouble, has been for a while before Ukrainian events, there is *very little* faith in possibility of Russian Government to solve those problems, thus - standard of life will decrease    -&gt; dissent will rise -&gt; you need to prepare to crackdown on protests, internet, civil society, hungry people -&gt; you create a shit ton of oppressive laws, raise taxes on everything and follow a general ""hardline"" all for the sake of preservation of power and money.

[""One of the byproducts of fermentation is the release of carbon dioxide gas, which, if the wine is bottled, is trapped inside the wine, causing intense pressure. The pressure inside the weak, early French wine bottles often caused the bottles to explode, creating havoc in the cellars. If the bottle survived, the wine was found to contain bubbles, something that the early Champenois were horrified to see, considering it a fault.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Champagne)

[""The English were one of the first who saw the tendency of Champagne to sparkle as a desirable trait, and tried to understand why it did bubble. In 1662, the English scientist Christopher Merret presented a paper detailing how the presence of sugar in a wine led to it eventually sparkling, and that nearly any wine could be made to sparkle by adding sugar to a wine before bottling it. This is one of the first known accounts of understanding the process of sparkling wine and suggests that **British merchants were producing ""sparkling Champagne"" even before the French Champenois were deliberately making it**.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Champagne#English_influences)

*First Verse*

East Berlin, Unter den Linden

People are walking by flags and banners

Where Lenin and Marx still stand on a pedestal

And everyone works, hammers and sickles

As the guards are changing in parade step

Forty years of socialism, and much has been achieved

*Bridge*

But what does utopia mean with walls surrounding it

If you’re afraid and have to say things cautiously

Oh, what is utopia, tell me: what is it worth,

When someone who is different is declared mad?

*Chorus*

And only the birds fly from East to West Berlin

They aren't called back, they aren't shot down

Over the wall, over the Iron Curtain

Because sometimes they like to be in the West, and sometimes in the East

*Second Verse*

West Berlin, the Kurfürstendamm

People are walking by porn- and peepshows

Where Mercedes and Cola still stand on a pedestal

And the neon ads, they’re glittering and luring

Come dance, come eat, come drink, come gamble!

Forty years of freedom, and much has been achieved

*Bridge*

But what does freedom mean, without a home, without a job?

So many Turks in Kreuzberg who can hardly survive

Okay, you can demonstrate, but with your back against the wall

And only if you have money, you don't pay for freedom

*Chorus*

And the birds fly from West to East Berlin

They don’t get called back, don't get shot down

Over the wall, over the Iron Curtain

Because sometimes they like to be in the East, and sometimes in the West

Because sometimes there is bread lying near the Gedächtniskirche

2. Risk management: Again very high population density — there's nowhere ""out of the way"" where you could reasonably put a plant and it would cause real estate prices to plummet for a significant number of people.

That said, about 12% of Danish electricity needs are met through imported nuclear power from Germany and Sweden, but a large proportion is still coal and natural gas. I think the hope on the political left is still that renewable sources will be developed to a point where they could cover a higher proportion.

Non riesco a rinvenire questo *claim* nello studio OSCE citato come fonte. Anedotticamente, i londinesi non sembrano particolarmente felici del loro servizio pubblico; in particolare i pendolari che vivono fuori e lavorano in centro hanno costi di trasporto molto alti e opzioni di spostamento limitate, sopratutto a Sud del Tamigi. Non sono sicuro che il modello Londra sia la strada maestra, sia perché ha dei problemi suoi sia perché Londra è una città diversa dalle realtà italiane (per esempio, oltre ai bus ha una metropolonitana che non trova confronti in Italia).

Una cosa che si potrebbe sperimentare del metodo ""londinese"" è la validazione del biglietto all'ingresso. In questi giorni la sta sperimentando TPER a Bologna, ma chiaramente (essendo l'azienda di merda che è) lo fa nel modo più inutile possibile: invece di validare il biglietto in ingresso di fronte al conducente (che diventa quindi anche controllore e impedisce l'accesso agli abusivi), la validazione dovrebbe avvenire presso le apposite macchinette ubicate in testa e in coda al bus, così che non vi sia nessuno a controllare che la validazione avvenga.

Je n'ai pas parlé de méchants immigrés. Je vois que tu continues à multiplier les strawman /u/hereandnotthere.

Soutenir l'immigration, c'est soutenir les patrons, c'est soutenir la concurrence entre travailleurs, c'est soutenir la baisse des salaires et l'augmentation du chômage.

Tu ignores le fait qu'ils ont gagné au change et ont vu leurs conditions s'améliorer en faisant du misérabilisme. Suis donc ta logique et offre les allocs à la terre entière puisque tu es contre les inégalités.

&gt;Si les 30 glorieuses ont existé c'est en grande partie grâce à l'apport de ces personnes.

N'importe quoi. Ils sont 200 000. Ils n'ont pas fait les 30 glorieuses, ils ont contribué à la baisse des salaires et à l'augmentation du chômage, en coûtant à la collectivité au bénéfice des patrons. C'est ça que tu défends.

&gt;Le petit délire xénophobe à base du ""retourner chez eux"" qui s'accomode très bien d'une injustice sociale insupportable au mépris de toute solidarité de classe pour une simple question de papiers.

Je m'accommode mal du misérabilisme qui cherche à faire croire que ces personnes sont victimes alors qu'ils ont bénéficié de la situation au détriment des travailleurs français. Encore une fois, regarde à qui ça profite (aux patrons et aux chibanis), regarde à qui ça a coûté (à tous les autres).

&gt;C'est pas en privant les Chibanis des allocations qui leurs reviennent de droit

Elles ne leur reviennent absolument pas de droit. La preuve ils n'ont pas été foutus d'obtenir la nationalité française malgré plus de 25 ans de présence. On n'a pas l'argent pour les payer de toute façon.

&gt;pour une simple question de papiers

Une nationalité n'est pas l'acquisition d'un papier. Essaie de devenir Algérien ou Marocain pour voir. Ils ne considèrent pas non plus la nationalité comme un papier.

&gt;

&gt;__Doublethink__ is the act of ordinary people simultaneously accepting two mutually contradictory beliefs as correct, often in distinct [social contexts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_context).  Doublethink is related to, but differs from, [hypocrisy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrisy) and [neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrality_(philosophy\)). Somewhat related but almost the opposite is [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance), where contradictory beliefs cause conflict in one's mind. Doublethink is notable due to a lack of cognitive dissonance — thus the person is completely unaware of any conflict or contradiction.

&gt;[George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell) coined the word *[doublethink](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/doublethink)* in his [dystopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia) novel *[Nineteen Eighty-Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four)* (1984); doublethink is part of [newspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak). In the novel, its origin within the typical citizen is unclear; while it could be partly a product of [Big Brother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(Nineteen_Eighty-Four\))'s formal [brainwashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwashing) programmes,  the novel explicitly shows people learning Doublethink and [newspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak) due to [peer pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure) and a desire to ""fit in"", or gain status within the Party — to be seen as a loyal Party Member. In the novel, for someone to even recognize–let alone mention–any contradiction within the context of the Party line was akin to [blasphemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy), and could subject that someone to possible disciplinary action and to the instant social disapproval of fellow Party Members.

I mean, they call him 'Red Ed' because he was a marginal favourite with the unions, but he's kept a very close shadow to the Conservative economic policy.  He didn't mention Ed Miliband or Labour once.

Again, he was talking to a room of new entrepreneurs.

Rather than attacking Andy Street because he has Conservative friends (he has but others too), how about looking instead at the John Lewis business model which calls every employee a partner, where every partner has a say in the way the business is run, where every department has a council, where 80% of appointments are by partners, and where annual profits are shared with the whole workforce.

Oh what a terrible man to listen too for warnings.

&gt;Safeguarding supplies - avoiding dependence
&gt;
&gt;Germany obtains roughly 85 percent of its gas from foreign sources. In order to safeguard German and European gas supplies in the long term, the gas must be purchased from as many reliable and geographically spread sources as possible. This avoids one-sided reliance on individual producers and thus one-sided pricing.
&gt;
&gt;E.ON has the most highly diversified supply structure in Europe and purchases gas from six countries: Russia, Norway, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Germany. Long-term purchase contracts with the producers guarantee reliable supply of the European markets with gas in line with their requirements.
&gt;
&gt;Long-term flexible purchase contracts
&gt;
&gt;Long-term purchase contracts, the so-called Long Term Contracts (LTCs), form the backbone of reliable gas supplies in Europe. They are the stable purchase base in competition with other consuming regions. Furthermore, they are the basis for justifiable investments in an efficient infrastructure.
&gt;
&gt;E.ON has contracted deliveries of gas from the most important producing countries for decades to come. The contracts run for 15 to 25 years and together cover delivery volumes of some 1.2 trillion cubic metres of gas. **The longest contract with the Russian producer, Gazprom, runs until 2036.**

Unfortunately, it really isn't much of an exaggeration to call the UK's particular democratic system an elective dictatorship.  There is no written constitution and no entrenched laws or rights: it is just as easy for the government to pass a law banning criticism of the government under penalty of death as it is for them to pass a law changing tax rates (either would simply require majority support in the House of Commons - the House of Lords can merely delay legislation for a year).  The importance of the ECHR is that it places an obligation under international law on the British government to respect human rights: they can pull out of it, but that would harm relations with other countries.  An obligation under domestic law would be worthless (unless we were to significantly alter our system of government) as the government could easily water it down or scrap it with no repercussions.  Indeed the only reason the government wants to replace the international obligation with a domestic one is to water down human rights they consider inconvenient.

There have been numerous cases in which the British government has treated people appallingly and the ECHR has been the only avenue for them to get justice.

Just some highlights I find by wikipedia'ing a bit:

They are given quite some importance in initiation the first world war, and actually started existing as a result of the first world war. In between the world wars they had quite some trouble figuring out how to rule their country, both inside (separatists) and outside (Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union had different plans for Yugoslavia). With nazism in Germany and fascism in Italy gaining momentum, the country was divided about what to do (a pact was signed, but was opposed by the military and so a coup was done). During the second world war, Yugoslavia was split up, with Croatia being a Nazi-satellite state. The remainder of the country was occupied by Axis powers; and two opposing groups within Yugoslavia (the communist Partisans and the royalist Chetniks) fought among themselves and the Axis powers. The Partisans were able to expel the axis powers and, with help from the UK and the Soviet Union, gained control of Yugoslavia. 

Socialist (Communist?) Yugoslavia was now born. With its ideological ties with the Soviet Union and neighbour Bulgaria, things seemed to go along well. However, Yugoslavia wanted to claim Albania and parts of Greece by instigating a civil war there. Bulgaria agreed to help, but Stalin vetoed this plan; causing the divide between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. 

Yugoslavia opposed both western NATO and eastern Warsaw Pact. It formed an international ""Non-Alligment Movement"". The country remained in this agreement until its dissolvement. Over the course of the years, greater autonomy was given to the various regions, due to the ethno-cultural differences within each region. In the years prior the Tito's death (1980, Tito was the ruler of Yugoslavia since 1945, though the regions themselves were handled in a democratic way; somehow), there were already strong ethnic tensions, though these were in part resolved by a 1974 resolution in which the regions gained even more regional rights (languages, for example). After Tito's death these tensions grew only stronger. Serbia, the main power in Yugoslavia tried to revert things to how it was prior 1974, but this was denounced by Slovenia and Croatia (regions within Yugoslavia at the time). In the late 80s, Kosovo (part of Serbia with a 80% Albanian majority) came in state of conflict between its Albanian and non-Albanian citizens. Serbia tried to solve things ""democratically"" by giving everyone a vote in future of Yugoslavia. With the Serbs being the majority, this was obviously a means to give Serbia more power. The Slovenian and Croation delegation left the Congress and all-Yugoslav communist party was dissolved. With the fall of Communism in the rest of Europe, all regions started to have democratic elections (with Serbia holding on tightest to communism). 

War broke out when the new secession movements wanted to replace to old Yugoslav entities. There was a kind of stand off between on the one hand Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo and Vojvodina (Northern part autonomous of Serbia, just like Kosovo is the southern autonomous part) on the one hand and Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina on the other hand. The second group tried to claim the right to self-determination, but this was rejected by the former group, arguing that the Serbian minorities within the second group should also have this right (as in; Serbian minorities in Croatia would also have the right to self-determination; something opposed by the Croats). Mid 1991, Croatia and Slovenia declared independence. Yugoslavia tried an attack from within by forcing the military bases within these two countries to fight back; but miscommunication and agreement with the situation by the military situation there stopped this. The posts were retaken with minimal loses. Late 1991, with some international pressure, there was cease-fire between civilians and Yugoslav military; but this would not last in Croatia. A bloody war broke out between the Croats and Serbs, with the latter being backed through equipment and manpower by Yugoslavia (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Serbian_Krajina#mediaviewer/File:CroatianSerbs.jpg ).  In December 1991 Macedonia seceded as well; though this was done without any problems. Macedonia and Serbia maintained friendly relations. The UN voted unanimously to bring in peacekeeping operations in what is left of Yugoslavia. Meanwhile in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbs attempted through an illegal referendum to create their own Serbian region within BiH. Shortly after, BiH as a whole held a referendum to secede from Yugoslavia; but this was  boycotted by the Serbs and deemed illegal by the Yugoslav politicians in Belgrade (Serbia). Bosnia declared independence anyway, and so the did the Serbs within Bosnia (Republika Srpska). A war broke out in Bosnia and Herzogovina, a country with 44% Muslim Bosniaks, 31% Orthodox Serbs and 17% Catholic Croats. The war lasted several years (Bosnian war), with the Serbs/ex-Yugoslavs always on one side and the Croats and Bosniaks on similar or independent side. In 1994 NATO joined forces with the latter (Croats and Bosniaks). Only by late 1995 was a peace achieved.

Yugoslavia had now shrunk to Serbia (and its two autonomous regions) and Montenegro, and was its legal successor. Kosovo, with a huge Albanian population, wanted further autonomy. This was blocked by Serbia and Montenegro, which caused yet another war. Yugoslavia on one side, and Kosovo on the other. Kosovo was able to get weapons smuggled through Albania. In 1999 NATO intervened by bombing Yugoslavian military bases; an act *NOT* approved by the UN.  The UN did pressure Yugoslavia in ending the war and not allowing Kosovo to hold any referendum for 3 years and the bombings stopped. Yugoslav president Milošević declared it a victory for Yugoslavia, but was indicated for war crimes. In 2008 Kosovo declared independence, though this is not recognized by a majority of nations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo#mediaviewer/File:CountriesRecognizingKosovo.svg . Meanwhile, in 2006 a referendum was held in Montenegro, with a mere 55.5% voting for independence. Serbia because the legal successor of Yugoslavia. 

In 2004 Slovenia entered the European Union. In 2013 Croatia entered the European Union. In 2004 Macedonia applied for membership. In 2009 Albania (though never part of Yugoslavia, definitely important) applied for membership. Since 2008 and 2009, Montenegro and Serbia started negotiating application of membership.

What I find interested is that NATO was in favour of the break-up of Yugoslavia, but is strongly opposed of the break-up of Ukraine. Furthermore, it's interesting to see that Spain, with strong separatist movements, does not recognize Kosovo while most of its ""Western allies"" do. It's also interesting, to me, how Yugoslavia ended up not united the countries, while the EU is now trying to unite the whole continent. I wonder how the EU will handle when all of the Balkan states are part of the EU and there are new ethnic tensions there. Yugoslavia obviously did poorly by basing their power at the Serbs. 

Anyway, it was an interesting search for me and I hope an interesting summary for people reading this.

Institutionally the NATO and US Military in Germany makes it quite clear, too in press releases interviews etc. Which is no surprise when you think of cold war times. Germany being the ""frontline"" here. But even then. People didn't like Germany becoming a playground/battleground for foreign powers. The French removed their bases, as did the Brits. The Sowjets/Russians retrieved theirs. Now Only the US still sits around and apparently hasn't noticed They aren't wanted.
So American Soldiers aren't wanted on our soil. The nuclear missiles still stationed here even less. And then there is the Drone control center which is used to run the drone operations in the middel east (Because it's about half way the drone controls run through Germany first) which people aren't to happy about either.

&gt;So we are supposed to take your word and never contradict the ""euro brought growth"" claim ?

Go ahead, but nothing useful is going to come from that discussion. It'll boil down to a matter of belief on either side. Politics and economics are not experimental sciences.

&gt;Nope, there's been persistent inflation differentials and, as a result, large cumulative changes in relative prices.

Which is the normal and expected result due to a lack of coordination in economic policies. Lately the coordination is beginning to get off the ground, but on a German model and unsurprisingly that results in a deflating Euro. So that'll have to be corrected.

France has been on the warpath for almost a thousand years, with a lot of wars of aggression, culminating in the Napoleonic conquests. Being from a neighbouring country, I know.

&gt;So the EU deal caused a war, it did not prevent it.

Cut the sophistry, the EU is not responsible for the actions of Russia. The EU gives a framework to resolve conflicts peacefully that before used to spark wars.

How is the choice which goals the economy should try to attain not a moral choice?

&gt;You proposed a policy that relies on the ECB being able to maintain a 2% inflation... Except that ECB was never able to do so, and our current quasi deflation shows it clearly.

Putting aside the fact that [most indicators point to strong economic growth for Ireland for the next few years](http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/economy-set-to-grow-by-31pc-this-year-as-recovery-broadens-30532983.html), a *lot* of EU states 'almost went bankrupt' since the start of the Great Recession. Ireland is by no means alone in that.

&gt; And incidentally, did you see the other countries on that list and their ranking? It makes very little sense.

It's used by the UN and considered the foremost authority on economic development and standard of living. Incidentally, it's not the only index on which Ireland comes out near the top. [It has one of the highest GDPs per capita in the world (which again is multiple's of Poland's)](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD). [It's one of the wealthiest countries in the OECD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development#Indicators). [Forbes described Ireland as the best country in the world for business](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2013/12/04/ireland-heads-forbes-list-of-the-best-countries-for-business/). I could go on all day, but the insinuation that Ireland is a poor country is 100% pure, unadulterated bollocks.

&gt; But that does not take away ireland obviously isn't a third world country, to say I suggested that is just daft. But I would not call poland one either.

You implied it. Regardless, at the very least you described the Poles as 'poor' and Ireland as an 'even poorer country'. That is objectively not the case.",0,1412343328,null,0,false,0,ckzbutw,t3_2i2x45,t1_ckzbutw,t1_ckz1lne,null,1426703159,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Ich nehm das Argument jetzt hier mal auf einem Niveau auseinander, dass auch jemand der nichts Vernünftiges studiert hat das begreift:

&gt;Der Tod von Schuldigen fordert natürlich auch einige Leben von Unschuldigen, was tragisch, aber unvermeidlich ist. 

Da sind wir uns also einig.

&gt;Aber jetzt, pass auf, der Knaller - rat mal was das Weiterleben der Schuldigen fordert. Richtig, mehr Menschenleben. 

Bitte ein Beispiel seit dem 2ten Weltkrieg wo eine militärische Intervention weniger(!) Leben gekostet hat als das Aufrechterhalten der vorher bestehenden Herrschaftsform. Bitte sekundäre Opfer durch folgenden Bürgerkrieg nicht unterschlagen. 

Gibt kein einziges Beispiel. 

&gt;Aber gut, das würde ja vorausdenken erfordern. Der IS wird munter weitertöten während du argumentierst. 

Der IS wird nie so viele Menschen töten können wie ein Bombenkrieg oder eine Invasion.


&gt;Es gibt keine Garantie, dass es diesmal besser wird. Man sollte vielleicht aber sichergehen, dass es dieses Mal nicht schlimmer wird, somit explizit viellleicht einen Genozid unterbinden.

Beleg das mal bitte mit Zahlen. Du wirst sehen, dein Völkermord hält sich im Rahmen und liegt weit unter den Opferzahlen, die eine militärische Intervention fordert.

Und was nennst du eigentlich nicht schlimmer? Ein paar tausend Tote oder hunderttausende Tote wie sie bei einer militärischen Intervention regelmäßig anfallen?

&gt;Jeder geistig gesunde Mensch würde die ethische Dringlichkeit erkennen.

Nein. Jeder geistig gesunde Mensch ist lernfähig und hat erkannt das ISIS ein Produkt westlicher Interventionspolitik ist. Man müsste eigentlich erwarten können, dass jemand der sich mit Politikwissenschaften befasst diesen Zusammenhang herstellen kann, da man dort aber keine Wissenschaft sondern Meinungverbreitung betreibt, kann das ja nichts werden.

Erneut dort einen Krieg anzufangen wird der Popularität des IS und anderen radikalen nicht schaden, im Gegenteil. Im schlimmsten Fall eines militärischen Eingreifens stürzen sie die Länder in welchen sie sich festgesetzt haben in jahrzehntelange Bürgerkriege mit Millionen Opfern.

Die Alternative ist damit endlich aufzuhören und zu akzeptieren, dass sich dort ein 2tes Saudi Arabien etabliert. Die haben nämlich die selben Regeln, köpfen ähnlich viel und sind auch sonst gut auf die zu sprechen. Mohammedaner unter sich eben. Komischerweise kam hier noch keiner auf die Idee in Saudi Arabien einzumarschieren um dort die Gleichberechtigung der Frauen durchzusetzen.

&gt;Ahja, noch ein dummes Argument! ""Geh doch selbst hin!"" Du bist dir bewusst, dass wir in Deutschland keine Wehrpflicht haben und alle Soldaten das freiwillig machen, ja? Wie gemein von mir wäre das, ihnen ihren Beruf zu verwähren? 

Ich merk schon, Verfassung und so wurde wohl nicht im Studium angesprochen. Die Bundeswehr hat genau einen Auftrag, dieser lautet Landesverteidigung. Du forderst von anderen Verfassungsbruch um deine Ansichten am anderen Ende der Welt durchzusetzen.

&gt;Natürlich bin ich in der Lage, durch mein fundiertes Wissen eine rationale und logische Meinung zu bilden. 

Bist du nicht. Du hast eine Meinung zugeteilt bekommen und wurdest mit Informationen gefüttert die diese verstärkt. Anstatt aber dies in einem Kontext, z.B. einem historischen zu sehen, beharrst du darauf alle Fehler noch einmal machen zu müssen, weil es diesmal ganz bestimmt klappt. Logisch ist daran nichts. Es ist schlicht dumm immer wieder Benzin ins Feuer zu kippen. 

&gt;Willst du mir jetzt erzählen, dass der IS nicht ""Böse"" nach jeder Definition des Wortes ist? 

Natürlich will ich das. Der IS ist nach **deinen** Maßstäben böse, Saudi Arabien ist es in deinen Augen nach den gleichen Maßstäben nicht. Trennen tut die beiden von der Ideologie her nichts, auch die Verfahrensweisen sind die gleichen. Für mich ist das einfach ein weiterer Shariastaat, wie so viele die der Westen durch seine Interventionspolitik geschaffen hat.

Allein daran erkennt man wie oberflächlich deine Argumentation ist und wie einfach dein Kartenhaus zusammenfällt. Was meinst du denn was die im IS von uns hier denken? Natürlich sind wir die bösen für die. 

Es ist nur eine Frage des Standpunktes wo du dich befindest was auf der Welt gut und böse ist. Genau so verbissen wie du Bomben auf die Mohammedaner forderst wollen die deinen Tod. Beide seid ihr aus dem selben Holz, der einzige Unterschied ist der Ort an dem ihr aufgewachsen seid und die Indoktrination die euch zuteil wurde.

Denn von gut kann man bei einem Krieg nicht sprechen oder ist das irgendwie in Ordnung den IS mit den Mitteln des IS zu bekämpfen?

Wenn du wirklich ""gut"" sein willst, distanzierst du dich. Überlegenheit, insbesondere moralische, zeichnet sich dadurch aus das man der bessere Mensch ist, nicht indem man seinem Gegner Auge um Auge, Zahn um Zahn das selbe antut. Dieser Quatsch vom Verteidigen der Menschenrechte Dritter durch Verletzen der Menschenrechte Dritter ist wohl einer der dümmsten Denkprozesse die stattfinden können.

Das sind aber Lektionen für die späteren Lebensjahre. Bis dahin kannst du ja als ""Politikexperte"" im Morgenprogramm von ProSieben auftreten und einen auf intelligent machen. Dort wirst du auch an keinen Professionellen kommen, der deine Argumentation auseinander nimmt.

Is there a majority for any Russian region to secede? If so I support that too.

When did Russia launch a surprise attack on Ukraine? I only remember them sending a convoy with humanitarian aid.

You accuse me of so-called ""whataboutism"" but my message was clearly not the case of this fallacy. Because this fallacy is all about changing the the subject or ""turning arrows"" to another matter.

User *hmunkey* asked why we don't agree with Western Media while we have access to it. Maybe in other words but this was the essence of the first paragraph of his message.

To which I replied with my previous comment stating the following ideas:

1) Western Media has very bad reputation among most Russians because it lied, exaggerated and silenced crucial facts in the past. And I showed some recent examples.

2) This bad reputation is not only based on their bias but also incompetence. Only few Western Media Groups has reporters on both sides of the conflict. And take their information mostly from Ukrainian sources - all of them obviously biased but also many were shown to fabricate at least several fakes every week.

3) In this conflict in particular - we, Russians we have greater insight due two facts I stated before: at least one of two Russians has some personal relation with Ukraine, and those who are interested in both sides of the story - can perfectly read Ukrainian media. In addition, for those who are not interested - our Ukrainian brethen come to our news portals comment sections and forums to argue and make their point about it.

So this is not case of whataboutism as you presented it in that quote manner. Now to your reply...

&gt;Maybe if you (this ""you"" includes both the russian public and the russian government in general) gave freedom for our journalists to report, instead of instant lynching and/or instant repression, they would be less biased. 

While I don't deny that Western journalists are viewed badly in Russia - this is due the same fact I stated above: bad reputation and lack of knowledge of our culture and privacy politics.

The solution would be easy - hire ethnic Russian journalists for job in Russia. 

And in recent conflict in Ukraine - its not problem at all to report both sides of the story. For example, Vice News has two media operatives from the beginning, showing two sides with not as much problems as a military conflict would cause somewhere else for reporting. While biased, they try hard to make an objective picture of the Civil War in Ukraine.

I do think that there are some cuts that need to be made and that especially corruption need to be combated a lot more in some states so the money we give them goes to actually the right places.

There are reforms to be had and there is a lot of cutting and other stuff involved in them.

However I do find it ludicrous (not the rapper) how much we germans seem to fear inflation, we are getting to the point of serious defltion, which is horrible, the inflation rate should usually be around 1.5-2.0% and during times of economic crisis like this can go up to even 3.5% maybe, however not more....

Still the like 0.5% we have now is just stupid, you can go too extreme in both ways, too much inflation is bad, deflation can be even worse...

I think the whole things needs to be a combination off cuts and reforms and controlled inflation...

The whole EU is centered around german-french friendship, its a try so that there will be no war within the eu member states (and hopefully sometimes europe).

Germany and France are really really important for that, they basically are a symbol for the EU, both countries have a long history of hating each other, but try to build friendship for the benefit of both of them (they were also the two biggest powers of the initial EU).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas#Energy_density_and_other_physical_properties has LNG's energy density of 20MJ/liter, or 20.000 MJ/m3.

A ton of oil equivalent is ~42 GJ, so a 2 m3 of LNG =~ 1 ton of oil, so Russia delivers about 200 million m3 of LNG worth of gas to the EU every year.

Guessing around the numbers from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG_carrier a little, the largest LNG carriers have a capacity of 266,000 m3, and there exist about 450 of them (very generous - 193 in 2005, add 25 per year since and round up).

&gt;__Twin towns__ or __sister cities__ are a form of legal and social agreement between towns, cities, [counties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County), [oblasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblast), [prefectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefecture), provinces, regions, states, and even countries in geographically and politically distinct areas to promote cultural and commercial ties.  The modern concept of town twinning, conceived after the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War) in 1947,  was intended to foster friendship and understanding between different cultures and between former foes as an act of peace and reconciliation,   and to encourage trade and tourism.  In recent times, town twinning has increasingly been used to form strategic international business links between member cities.

De plus, je ne sais pas comment tu peux conclure ""les places sont suffisantes"" alors qu'il n'y a aucune mention des capacités d'accueil sur ton lien ??

Enfin, même si les places par mosquée étaient affichées, il ne suffirait pas de les additionner, déjà parce que toutes les mosquées ne peuvent pas offrir une prière du vendredi qui demande un imam avec une prêche digne de ce nom et pas simplement des mètres carrés mais surtout parce que l'offre doit répondre à la demande dans un certain lieu.

Par exemple, il y a une seule petite mosquée dans le 15ème, qui fonctionne totalement en surcapacité et des gens sont obligés de prier dehors bien qu'ils soient déjà entassés à l'intérieur. Leur dire qu'il y a de la place de l'autre côté de Paris ne résout pas le problème, puisque les gens prient à côté de leur travail et n'ont pas le temps de traverser Paris deux fois lors de la pause déjeuner.
