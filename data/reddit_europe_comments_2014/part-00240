I'm still in the process of figuring this out, I just read it today and was quite puzzled because most of the other sources that I read stated the Adenauer was in general not really anglophobe (unlike de Gaulle), something like the EU would probably be his dream, his goals were mainly ensuring peace and maintaining/acquiring a strong position for negotiations with the SU for his goal to restore Germany. 

Just checked again and it actually states that Adenauer didn't want to include the UK in a  European Political Union (there were talks about the formation of a european politican union between 1958 and 1961 - [Fouchet Plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fouchet_Plan)) and apparently Adenauer didn't want the UK to be part of that, for whatever reason.

All these plans failed because especially France had so deviating opinions from the rest of the EEC (BeNeLux, Italy, Germany) and it kind of reads like a fight in kindergarten. Each side proposes a vision for a EPU, the other sides reject them and proposes them, it gets rejected and the other side proposes pretty much the exact same thing.

The source are notes from a former ambassador to Paris, [Josef Jansen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Jansen), what I read is a summary by Thomas Jansen which I suppose is his son.

in the south for example, religion is still a fairly important part of the culture, while it is almost completely unimportant in the north and east

with that, you will also face a shift in some values. for example the view on traditional family values

but generally speaking, germans hold the middle class in high regard. family is important to many germans and a family owned business is more to our liking than a multinational enterprise (even the bigger family owned companies like tchibo or aldi)

we value scientists over economists, being an engineer, doctor or chemist is far more impressing than being a manager, even if you earn a lot more money from that. that is also the reason why we don't buy into ""work hard and get rich"", because the rich are generally not doing what we associate with ""hard work""

punctuality is very important to most. if you're running late, it is generally expected that you call in and inform the person waiting for you that you are being late (this does not apply for parties)

germans are also usually very direct and honest. if you ask ""how are you"", expect them to actually tell you how they are. this also leads to us taking you by your word. if you're offering help, we will take you by your word. on the other hand, if we offer help, we usually mean it, too (or we already have an excuse to avoid it beforehand)",0,1408313214,null,0,false,0,cjt15fi,t3_2dtwud,t1_cjt15fi,t3_2dtwud,null,1435289173,29,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,29

I've never argued for a single state consisting of the UK and New Zealand, for instance. The thing is, that it is in all of our interests for us to co-operate, but many people use this as an argument that the European Project either won't work or shouldn't work. However, in the example of the European Union, it most certainly should. I mean, for instance, you say ""why should my vote influence people in countries I don't live in"" but that in itself has preconception that the national borders of today are somehow supposed to be there. The thing is, we have to talk about what nation states do. There are many services that we *expect* any reasonable country to provide or ensure. For instance, education, healthcare, safety, access to food, shelter and water and many more. Now, many people have different opinions about what the state should provide and ensure, but what we can all agree on is that we can ensure/provide more services, if we *band together*. Even Libertarians (who hold that view that advocates the state intervene the least to ensure/provide services) agree that borders are a burden and that they should be removed, but even this requires co-operation amongst nation states which (if we're imagining that this is still democratic-liberatiarianism) requires some necessary merging of elections and power. Anyway, personally I, and many others, are of the belief that many of the challenges facing human kind cannot be solved by the small nation states of today and that we must coalesce to solve problems like climate change, global warming, overpopulation, ocean acidification, the dangers of nuclear war and so on. These problems cannot be solved by millions of tiny Luxembourgs or Maltas or even relatively large Estonias and Scotlands. If we allow ourselves to be divided despite the obvious benefits of integration, co-operation and coalescences of electorates, then we will be unable to provide the most important services mankind needs, the need for survival and the need to thrive. But, anyway.

true,serpenta,POLA,Mazovia,"&gt;Reddit in general has a boner for that fucking goddamned soldier bear no one really cares about in Poland (just... shut up about it, Jesus), and the winged hussars - while forgetting the real heroes like the Accursed Soldiers or Solidarity movement.

""Soldier bear""? You mean [this](http://kresowiacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mis%203.jpg)? If so then yea, I don't get how it's so incredible. I only learned it because foreign friend told me.

As for the hussars - don't you hate. It was the best cavalry in the world, in its time, and I'd argue the best cavalry formation ever (comparatively). They could deliver the blow of heavy formation, while making crazy maneuvers that were barely possible even for lighter formations. Thanks to training and great horses bred in Poland they could charge after charge after charge (the record being 7 charges in two hours iirc), which would kill a regular military horse.

And they were pulling off the most incredible battle plans, in the most disadvantageous numbers. Like Klushin, where 5600 Hussars (Among 6800 polish troops) defeated Russian army of 35000 men. Remember Thermopilae? Well, at Chocim 600 Hussars fought 10000 Turkish infantry and cavalry; and won. For nearly 200 years that formation was unbeaten: no battle it took part in was considered lost.

So really, I don't think we should ever complain if someone is appreciating hussars. They were not heroes, they were soldiers - granted - although in some battles their performance was on a simply heroic level.

Accursed Soldiers and Home Army are more recent, and ""more"" heroic. As these were people who most often were not trained as soldiers when the country called them; situation defined them. But they are more of an internal matter, and you should expect internal recognition, not external.

To reverse the situation: do you know and recognize better each individual VC winner's exploits or those of RAF pilots, as a formation? Fool yourself not, it will be never thought in any other school than polish, who Janek Wiśniewski or Ryszard Siwiec was. And for a good reason: there are two kinds of history: universal and national. The two latter are part of national, hussars are part of universal.

Having said that. I would really fancy a good, high budget movie about hussars. Their history is full of great script material. And great one liners: when one of our kings wanted to retreat from battlefield, because the enemy had bigger numbers, the commander of a hussar wing said ""Do not worry my king, as you are under our protection. Even if the skies were to fall on us, we would support them on our pikes"".",0,1408314641,null,0,false,0,cjt1s8w,t3_2dsho2,t1_cjt1s8w,t1_cjsmv5k,null,1435289514,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,ithisa,CANA,Canada,"I lived in China most of my life and will continue to do so (i.e. when I die I probably have spent more time in China). The main difference is that Chinese people don't trust the government. At all. And the government don't attempt to make them trust either - you should listen to a Chinese official (not of MoFA) make a speech. It's beyond terribad! It always seems he's going to fall asleep or something, and stammers while staring at a piece of paper. Absolutely no care of people actually listening.

In addition, Chinese propaganda is compartimentalized. There are real news (Xinhua, most of CCTV-1), and there are real propaganda (editorials, People's Daily, Global Times, CCTV-1 7PM to 8PM). Passing propaganda disinformation as real news almost never happens. The reporting in ""real news"" even is quite unbiased except when it touches territorial disputes. It almost seems as if they give you as easy way as possible for filtering out the misinformation - ignore editorials, Xinwen Lianbo, and ""analysts"".

So basically Chinese people are much less susceptible to propaganda than Russians. There are CPC fanboys who enjoy looking at the propaganda programs and papers, but everybody can tell apart propaganda from non-propaganda. The only thing really distorted by propaganda is views on neighboring countries due to territorial disputes. Chinese people culturally place great importance on clay too, and then the media spins it in a way that people think other people stole China's clay.

In other words, excepting feelings towards neighboring countries, and to a lesser extent foreign relations in general, Chinese people's opinions cannot be swayed at the whims of a spin doctor. Especially opinions towards domestic policies, often negative, are very strongly held, and people will go out of their way to avoid propaganda.

Thus, we cannot expect Chinese govt to ignore the needs of the people in domestic areas. I remember for a period of a few months, editorial sections of newspapers were full of defenses of China's pollution - we are a huge developing country, not a developed country who can afford to burn less coal, etc etc. Eventually they gave up, government started anti-pollution work, and almost no real people believe the aforementioned ""right to pollute"".

Yes it is, and this power has been exercised a number of times. Fairly recently a family in Rome tried to have their son take on the mothers last name as opposed to the fathers. Rome's city law said it could not be done. The family appeared to Federal court, which said the exact same thing. Then the family appealed to the European court, which said that the kid can have the mothers last name. Rome now has to re- rewrite its laws to correlate to EU's court decision.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_marxism

&gt;An outgrowth of Western Marxism (especially from Antonio Gramsci and the Frankfurt School) and finding popularity in the 1960s as cultural studies, cultural Marxism argues that what appear as traditional cultural phenomena intrinsic to Western society, for instance the drive for individual acquisition associated with capitalism, nationalism, the nuclear family, gender roles, race and other forms of cultural identity are historically recent developments that help to justify and maintain hierarchy.

Pretty much all of modern social liberalism falls under that definition.

Hungary's earlier problem was that it was too small of a country to become prominent on Brussels' agenda, what with the Greek debt crisis, Spain's troubles, and the host of other issues that beset the Union.  Orban could implement his vision of dismantling constitutional liberalism relatively unobstructed and get away with a mere slap on the wrist because the EU had bigger fish to fry.  Now that it looks like Hungary has become Russia's Trojan horse in diplomatic terms (I leave aside the irony that an avowed anti-communist is a pawn in Putin's game of playing EU members against one another), Brussels will pay more attention to its relationship with Budapest.

Orban is also fishing in troubled waters.  His call for autonomy for ethnic Hungarians in Ukraine has turned him in the eyes of Romania from a somewhat benign demagogue into a potential threat.  Romania has been free for quite a few good years of politically organized extremism on the level that Jobbik exhibits daily in the Hungarian Parliament.  However, Cristian Diaconescu, the opposition's candidate to the coming presidential elections, has recently picked on the opportunity to question the government's reaction to Orban's statements (which is not to say that he or the opposition are raving anti-Hungarians).  If this becomes an election topic, then the society may become polarized again and, unfortunately, ethnic Hungarians will end up picking up the tab for Orban's penchant to antagonize neighbors for domestic political gains.

To be sure, this is a storm in a glass of water.  Orban's problem is that he speaks extremely loudly while carrying a very short stick indeed (thus, his instinct to place Hungary in Putin's shadow).  Hungary is a small country with a population estimated at around 10 million that lacks resources and is dependent on FDI.  There is only so much room for growth and regional influence given these fundamentals.  Whereas its Romanian neighbor has natural resources, double the population, and plenty of room for growth, Hungary's ideal road map can only be to become a regional Switzerland that trades financial status for diplomatic access to Brussels and vice versa.  Given the way Hungary has changed during Orban's rule, both of these factors are unlikely to be realized.  Instead, the society has become polarized, the pension fund has been raided, and, what's probably the worst, many Hungarian children and teenagers are now regularly exposed to an illiberal discourse.  This last point cannot be stressed enough.  A country's strength lies in its potential to make the best of its future.

true,newappeal,advanced-english,advanced (native English),"When dealing with German conjunctions, it's important to know which ones require the main verb at the end of the clause (dependent clauses/Nebensätze, introduced by subordinating conunctions/Subjunktionen, as stated by /u/gwfe11), and which ones do not.

Coordinating conjunctions: und (and), oder (or), aber (but), denn (since/because), sondern (but rather)

z.B. Wir gehen ins Kino , und sie **bleiben** zu Hause . - *Note how ""bleiben"" directly follows the subject, as in a normal independent clause.*

Some common subordinating conjunctions: weil (because), obwohl (although), wenn (if/when), als (when *[past tense, one occurrence]*) nachdem (after), seit/seitdem (since *[time]*), insofern (as long as/so far as)

z.B. Wir gehen zum Park, obwohl es stark **regnet**. - *Note how ""regnet"" does not come directly after the subject, but instead at the end of the clause. If the subordinate clause were put into it's own sentence, it would be written as ""Es regnet stark"". You can therefore see how ""regnet"" so-to-say ""pops"" out of the sentence and is re-inserted at the end.*
________________________________

If any of that is confusing, ignore the rest of this. If it's not, here's two supplementary notes:

1) If the subordinate clause comes before the main independent clause, the subordinate clause acts like an adverb or prepositional phrase occupying the first ""unit"" of the sentence. 

z.B. Als sie gekommen **ist**, **haben** wir die Feier begonnen. *Also note the optional use of ""dann"" in Wenn-clauses:* Wenn sie **kommt**, dann **werden** wir die Feier beginnen.

2) There is sort of another class of conjugations known as ""adverbial conjugations"". These include common words like deshalb (therefore) or also (therefore). You can use these words to link clauses, but instead of using **subject - object - verb** like a subordinate clause, you use **verb - subject - object** like an independent clause initiated by an adverb (which is exactly what it is).

z.B. Er **hat** die verlangte Leistung nicht geliefert, deshalb **hat** der Chef ihn gefeuert.

Hopefully I made that clear. Let me know if I need to clarify anything.

However I'll try to answer this as best I can with my current understanding. If any of my Grammar or explanation is incorrect please correct me, it can only help my understanding of the language.

Okay then here we go.

Conjunctions link two parts of a sentence together.

The independent clause is the main meat of the sentence  and follows standard German word order and makes sense as a standalone sentence. 

A dependent clause is one whose word order is altered by the use of Subordinating conjunctions. The dependent clause usually does not make grammatical sense as a complete sentence if removed from the independent clause when certain conjunctions are used  since the word order is scrambled and it refers to objects and events in the independent clause.


Depending on which of the two types of conjunctions you use depends on whether the word order of the second clause that follows the conjunction changes.

The easiest conjunctions to use are ""Coordinating"" conjunctions. These do not alter the word order (syntax) of the second sentence  thus connect two independent clauses. Simply put a comma after the first sentence, then the conjunction and after that carry on the sentence as normal with verb in 2nd position.

E.g Ich esse einen Apfel, aber er isst keinen Apfel.

There are very few of these compared to subordinating conjunctions and can easily be remembered by singing them to the tune of the  ""Stayin alive"" by the Bee Gees . They are  Und, Denn, Sondern, doch, allein, aber, oder.



The second type are a little more tricky to use. These are called ""subordinating"" conjunctions. These alter the word order in the second clause thus is reliant on the presence of an independant clause for contex. When a subordinating cunjunction is used the conjugated verb is forced  to the end of the sentence instead of the second position as usual. Once again the dependent clause is separated from the main clause by a comma followed by the conjunction.

E.g Ich esse den Apfel, weil es Gesund ist. 

If a sentence starts with the subordinate clause, the first word after the comma must be the conjugated dependent clause verb.

E.g - Weil es ist Gesund, esse ich den Apfel.


Most conjunctions are subordinating conjunctions so its easier to learn the few, easy to use coordinating conjunctions by heart and if you come across any others remember to move the verb :)

The current outlook is not good i fully agree with you. What i dont recognize as good comparison is the comparison of the EU and Argentinia. They are totally differnet matters, and well argentinia is failing again(atm). 

1. The EUs econnomics are of a much larger scale. i would accept comparisons to the US because their federalsystem is much more related to that of the EU.(and we are of similar economic power[even the GDP distribution is comparable within the US and the EU]

2. The contractual framework of the EU hinders every good point you made that could lead to a solution in favor of your arguments. So the EU has to find another way of dealing with this. It is actually happening right now. We unify the monetary transfersystems one contry will stand for the other (federalistic) as germany hands out Money and thh EZB does this too. I know that this is not favored but it can lead to a debt sate where every country has an equal ammount of %gdp debt which could then lead to a currency default without hurting the real economy since the largest market for the EU is the EU and if all go to default no one goes (viewpoint inner EU market).
This can lead to much stronger bound EU because everyone got leveled while the real economy is untouched and safes its value infront of the worldmarket with this preserving(or in case of germany) the relativ value of each country.

3. I really agree with you that germany should take a stronger more liberal lead in this situation, if Merkel had worked quicker and bailed out greek 3 years earlier it would not be in such a severe state today. Sadly Merkel and the CDU are of reaktionary and poplistic conservative working so this wont happen anytime soon so we will take the slow road of EU unification.

In my oppinion the state of the EU is not as dark as you make it sound since we are speaking of a economic high horse|Germany once was in a simmilar state 10% out of work, etc not long ago(around 1998(and before [building it thx to Kohl]-2001| which has at every point he ressources to turn eighther direction. What we need is more cooperation between the members. 


""[quote]The only workable options are spend the money to make it proper Optimal Currency Area with would be maybe 10-20% GDP in Germany's case.[quote]

There you have it in my oppinion:

I already pointed at the Unification of the monetary transfersystem of the EU(bonds), Germany was against it because germany knows (from home because bavaria is a main donor to all the other members of our federalistic state) that it will have to bail out the other members of the EU at somepoint but it came. And it already has an effect on the Euro which is at the moment primarily rated as Germany currency given mostly AA+. this system will as soon as the EU reforms itself(Unification of European military... jzst came up HUGE point) in the future stabilize European markets and make room for reforms in each country until the EU has changed to a US model federalistic union. This is my hope and all the trouble we had could lead to this if the EU stays at its point of no exit.
If you were to allow a controlled exit, you would open the door for controlled economic crash leave if the situation in the EU once would become bad for countries you cnat let them leave but you need to be prepared to help them if they get into troble which can only be done by ghost governing etc blabla which is not feasable in the current EU.

We just need the EU not only from a Economic point of view but as a system to keep the countrys united to avoid Wars. In my oppinon the EU from the intial stages till today is a huge reason why germany and france havent had a war for 70 years now. All your solutions would most certainly lead to the destruction of the Unified EU into eigther a 2 zone EU or into degeneration to just a treaty agreement which i wouldnt want.

Well my points are not as suphisticated as yours, its just my understanding of the current economic situation which is still the Banking crisis we arent out of it well have to deal with it for a long long time. So stabilizing withing a crisis then contracting is normal in my opinion.

I dont want to leave out the banking involvement of germany. I fully agree with it, but i dont think it was as sophisticated planned out, more of a reaktionary way of dealing with a unaticipated situation. what the article is discribing is the endresult which is partly benefical to the banks of germany but hugely unfair to the germany tax payers who wouldnt have to stand in for failing quality control before the crisis.

So are you saying it's best to take these refugees to Sweden rather than ohh say Khazahkstan? These countries need to be built up and not left to crumble like these idiotic policies do.

Sweden is furthest away from middle east and you say that it's a good option? No, that lacks reality.

Sweden is also one of the most expensive places on earth which means a strained economy and higher tax pressure.

If you want these countries to go anywhere and not succumb to the evil that has grown there you should not say that braindrain is good, it's what dooms these countries from the start.

&gt; So there are to a of obstacles that the region has to overcome before they can even start building a functioning immigration process.

Not really, fighting doesn't happend in all of middle east and there are plenty of safer places to start building.

&gt; There are a lot of things involved, housing, citizenship, food, clothes, and the prospect of a job.

We need to aid the development of these things, it's both cheaper and more humane than our current policies.

&gt; These are all thing that Sweden can take care of, though not in an unlimited fashion, of course.

We've already breached the threshhold of what is possible. What comes next is just to lower the quality in every manner possible. We can't take in more refugees and immigrants without seriously harming the economy and welfare system.

Although I'm a bit curious, how many more do you think we have room to take in before enough is enough?

&gt; tl;dr We have the system and infrastructure to sustain this, they don't even have a functioning state to begin developing a system that can handle the infrastructure of starting an immigration process.

This is false, you forget that there are more countries in the middle east than Iraq and Syria. There are also very few reasons why we should take in people from Somalia and Eritrea.",0,1408328169,null,0,false,0,cjt7ued,t3_2dtwex,t1_cjt7ued,t1_cjt76d9,null,1435292670,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

The EU rules mandate that European citizens from outside your country must be treated the same as a citizen within the country for education, but they don't have a say at what happens within the country (for this, anyway). Because the criteria is based purely on being domiciled in Scotland - a geographic matter, nothing to do with race or background - it doesn't fall foul of any of the usual discrimination rules either.

In order to get the free education, you just have to live normally (""ordinarily resident"") within Scotland for three(?) years prior to the start of your course - I'm not sure but I think it just requires proof of address/es for the appropriate time scale.

It's bizarre and completely unfair, but justified by Scottish institutions as making up for recent funding cuts. I *think* the funding is managed on a UK-wide basis though, despite the different entry/cost requirements.

true,ithisa,CANA,Canada,"Japanese corporations are extremely influential too, but there is some sort of hidden rule that they never abuse that influence. Or else? I am not really sure; the judiciary is known in Japan for being harsh and extremely uncorrupt though (though police is considered somewhat incompetent). Most often guilty verdict too easy. Also, nobody wants to be that one evil corporation while everybody else is much less evil - violating societal norms is considered really, really bad in Japan.

One thing different with oligarchs is that generally, the CEO of a corporation isn't an insanely influential guy, but the corporation as the sum of its management, workers, especially shareholders etc is a super formidable force, probably more influential than Eastern Europe oligarchs. Corporations in Japan are typically sharded into lots of shares which are owned by possibly multiple holding companies, with *their* shares that are sharded between tons of ppl, etc. In fact, I don't recall knowing any large corporation that sells stuff, that isn't owned by a corporation that, well, trades in corporations.

Inter-corporation/business corruption, i.e. things like corruption to win construction contracts, is supposedly common in Japan. However, money-for-political-gain, or bribing courts/police to get away with bad stuff, is apparently uncommon and considered highly unethical and against societal norms. Non-political corruption is somewhat of a problem; some industries have problems with organized crime infiltration, for example, although organized crime is not as intrusive or violent as in places like Italy. It is really interesting how almost every restaurant in certain areas conspicuously display a sign ""No mafia here, voluntarily applied for special police surveillance"" basically.

On the ""sexism"" thing, it is true that gender roles are very important, and gender equality isn't a very big thing. However, it would be incorrect to claim that Japan mistreats women, or that Japanese males are misogynists. It is simply that Japanese women have very different societal expectations than those of men; neither really has ""more"" rights. A male who is lazy at work is looked down just as much as a female who doesn't care for the family; conversely stay-at-home dad is thought just as weird as work-centered mom. Also, violence against women or rape is extremely dishonorable (due to ironically sexist stereotypes of women needing protection; famously ""I will protect you"" is a cheesy movie male-to-female romantic line in the ballpark of ""I wanna be with you forever"" in English); ""sexism causes rape"" is really only possibly true in rather violent and individualistic societies like the US. Ubiquitous anti-pervert / stop sexual harassment ads on trains do seem quite paranoid though - with a really low sex crime rate, Japan probably seems the opposite based on how many PSAs are devoted to how bad it is. Everybody in Japan seems to be bound to societal expectations though, so this isn't something that comes up only in gender. Workplace position roles, roles in friend relationships, etc are just as strict as those of gender.",0,1408334034,null,0,1408335135,0,cjtailk,t3_2dtkzu,t1_cjtailk,t1_cjt7buy,null,1435294202,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,newappeal,advanced-english,advanced (native English),"""Tisch"" in this case is what is known as a predicative nominative (that's what it would be called in English, too), because the verb ""to be"" is not a transitive or intransitive verb, but a *linking* verb. ""Sein"" and ""werden"" are two of the most common linking verbs in German (just like ""to be"" and ""to become"" in English), and will *never* take an accusative. This can get confusing for English speakers, because we tend to say ""It's me"" or ""That's him"", which suggests the accusative case in German. However, due to the predicate nominative, those sentences should be ""It's I"" or ""That's he"". Although such an error is common and colloquially acceptable in English, it is not in German. Those sentences should be ""Es ist ich""\* and ""Das ist er"", even in colloquial speech.

\* As a side note, ""Es ist ich"" is not a common sentence in German. Germans will generally reverse the sentence and make it ""Ich bin es"" (""I am it""). This is a common phrase for when you call someone who can recognize your voice on the phone.

Further note in case you're curious: 
Syntactically, the accusative case represents a particular type of object (generally the direct object, but also the object of a preposition). Consequently, not even all *transitive* German verbs take accusative objects, the most common being ""folgen"" and ""helfen"", both of which take a dative. 

Other verbs take an accusative and a dative object, depending on the quality of the object. ""Vertrauen"" (to trust) takes a dative object for the person being trusted and an accusative object. Note these sentences:

1. Ich glabue das. - I believe that. *Accusative object, I trust the validity/truth of that.*
2. Ich glaube ihm das. - I believe that [fact] which he said. *Accusative and Dative object. Note that a much more concise sentence is possible in German, with polishing required in the English translation.*

Edit: got over-excited and used ""vertrauen"" because... reasons. Also, to believe a person should be ""jdm. Glauben schenken""",0,1408336675,null,0,1408386097,0,cjtbkon,t3_2dupov,t1_cjtbkon,t3_2dupov,null,1435294910,4,false,German,t5_2qq51,4

The US is still very solidly in second place when it comes to manufacturing. It is not so much that manufacturing has declined in the US, [it has continued to grow](http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/united-states/manufacturing) with the exception of a few years during the recession. The reason that China overtook the US was that China's manufacturing sector is simply growing faster. As a percentage of global output China is ranked 1st at 22%, the US second at 17%, Japan 3rd at 10%, and Germany is ranked 4th at 6%. The US manufactures technical things like aircraft and MRI machines. It also has much more promising future energy prospects due to natural gas discoveries and other things. Just because it manufactures less household items than it used to, does not mean manufacturing is dead.

The US is one of the few developed countries whos demographic prospects look promising. The US population is growing, and is projected to continue to do so. Most other developed nations are not only not growing, but they're projected to decline. This might not sound bad on its face, but that puts significant additional stress on social security and healthcare programs. It also pushes up the old age dependency ratio, which in turn means more taxes will be required on workers to support elderly people. 

This is especially acute in Asia because they dont embrace immigration. China is facing some of the worst prospects due to its one child policy among other things. By China's [own official estimates](http://english.caixin.com/2011-12-23/100342018.html) it will go from a three worker to one pensioner ratio in 2010, to a 2:1 ratio in 2015, to a 1:2 ratio by 2040. Having one worker support 2 pensioners will be incredibly expensive. Right now, China's political party invests heavily into growth industries (real estate, manufacturing, financial services that offer business financing, etc). Much of this wealth will be needed to support the older generation as it begins to overtake the young. 

So while I will agree, China's rise is unstoppable give its size, it is facing major uphill challenges. The US does not face many of these because it embraces immigration. In fact, where China's demographic statistics are projected to get progressively worse over time, the US' actually are projected to get better.

Although we often use prepositions to convey meanings for which German would use grammatical case the two are not completely analogous but rather like a venn diagram b/c some uses of case in German are conveyed in English with word order not prepositions and some uses of case in German don't correspond to prepositional use in English, etc. 

E.g.

Wir helfen **den Flüchtlingen**. The dative corresponds to the verb object which English uses word order to express w/o the use of ""to"". ""We're helping **the refugees**."" **Not**: We're helping **to** the refugees.

true,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"GEZ: It used to be that you had to pay a TV licence if you had a TV, or a radio licence if you only had a radio, or nothing if you had neither. The fee went to the state broadcasters to fund their output, but Germans couldn't help noticing that the state TV channels still carried adverts at certain times of the day (compare with the BBC, which has no radio licence, and the TV licence was cheaper, and the BBC had such a strict no-advertising policy that some producers would insist on blacking out any brand names that happened to be in shot).

Then came the internet, and the ability to stream radio and TV that way. So GEZ started applying the radio licence fee to any computer connected to the internet. So far so bad, but then in the interests of ""fairness"", GEZ started levying a flat rate on every household, on the basis that surely everybody these has a TV, radio or internet device. This is being challenged through the courts, but the GEZ, a typical German quango, tends to dig its heels in.

GEMA: This is a so called collecting agency, and nearly every country in the world has at least one collecting agency. They all work the same way: they licence broadcasters and venues (concert halls, theatres, clubs, etc), then redistribute the revenue in the form of royalties to composers and performers. So when, for example, somebody plays a Scorpions hit on the radio, in a club, on the internet or wherever, the Scorpions get a few pennies or a few dollars, depending (you get more $$ if it's played in national TV than if it's played in a pub). This is the same all over the world (e.g. BMI and ASCAP in the US, PRS For Music in Britain, etc.), and GEMA is nothing special in that regard. It's just that GEMA and YouTube can't agree on the terms for a licence, as YouTube claims GEMA is demanding more than they could get back in advertising revenue. YouTube started blocking in Germany music it identified as being on GEMA's books, saying GEMA had ordered it. GEMA objected, saying YouTube is trying to blacken GEMA's name, as GEMA doesn't have the right to block anything, and that YouTube should continue to stream the music, but pay the fees into an escrow account pending the outcome of the legal dispute. YouTube has slightly changed the wording of the message that appears when a video is blocked, but is still blocking videos because, well, what is the short term difference to YouTube if they pay the money into escrow instead of to GEMA? Especially since the dispute has dragged on for years now.

YouTube probably banked on GEMA realising that it was in their best interest to come to an agreement, but like GEZ, GEMA is a German quango and is utterly unbending when it comes to The Rules. A similar dispute with PRS For Music was resolved within months.

It doesn't matter, by the way, that the Scorpions uploaded the video themselves ""for free"". If the video is played, the Scorpions are legally entitled to royalties, and it is the job of the collecting agencies to make sure they get their royalties.

Not that GEMA is the only collecting agency with an impossible attitude. Kevin MacLeod is a composer who releases royalty-free Creative Commons music that people can use in their YouTube videos or for anything else they want.

true,fluffytable,CZEC,Czech Republic,"Yeah, it wasn't all fun and games. People in Angola are used to a different standard of daily pain than Europeans. That's the problem with teaching in the classroom - as long as you're in the classroom, everyghing makes perfect sense - violence, alcohol, corruption; the moment you enter the streets again, the old patterns kick in. It was common for our students to come drunk to classes. One of them we suspected to be an alcoholic. That is why we emphasised work in the field. It made things more real. The work was amazing, though, our students learned really quickly. They were able to communicate (a bit) in English after just three months. Also one of my students from a drama class wrote a poem about Agostinho Neto and got some children in the street and dramatised it. They performed it at a celebration of Neto's birthday in front of an audience. 

The place can be dangerous (especially the capital) but it's really fine if you are careful. The main danger for me were dogs. I was in Kuito which was under siege for many months during the war. The locals told me that bodies lay piled in the streets, there was no time or strength to bury them. That means that dogs feasted like kings and multiplied. There are many dogs in the town till today and they fight each other over territory (mainly piles of rubbish). So they are nervous and sometimes, when you go somewhere where you shouldn't, they attack. I got attacked three times but never got bitten, though, the dogs are as scared as the people.

The people are amazing. Very friendly (sometimes too much). I encountered little racism as we know it (that is where I heard the word ""tuga"" in what I understood to be a negative context). There were few nationalist and xenophobic people in Kuito. There was another type of racism which I experienced. I often got treated as somebody better because I had white skin. It was extremely uncomfortable. In the market, salesmen sould sometimes chase away their customers serve us first. One time, I was walking through the town and an older lady was shuffling opposite of me. When she saw me, she stepped off the pavement, onto the road and bowed as I passed her. I thought I was going to cry. 

The people never gave me any trouble, apart from work-ethic related things. It's interesting that Angolans have a good opinion of Czechs. During the Cold War and the Angolan civil war, the eastern block supported MPLA (communists, the ruling party today) and Czechoslovakia shipped tons of weapons into Angola. Also many Angolans came to Czechoslovakia to study. The countries had very good relations and Angolans remember. In fact, we met a couple of people who spoke Czech having been educated here. It's usually Russians who work in oil who get targeted by nationalist groups. They even bullied some Russian doctors who were there. Confiscated their laptops and things.

In Kuito specifically, there is a potential danger which is fortunately diminishing rapidly - weapons. The town is surrounded by minefields (some of them Czechoslovak, I was told) and people keep finding ammunition everywhere. One time, a worker at our school construction site, came in the office, holding a mortar round and bashing it on the table, he said ""look what I found."" Mines, combined with diabetes, spiders, parasites and infections in general, mean that a lot of people are missing a limb. I mean, a lot of people. I once met three schoolgirls, well-off ones, two of whom were missing an arm and one had only one leg. And they were from richer families, bags, uniforms, everything. Most kids don't even bring a pencil to school, just a stool to sit on. 

The country is very catholic, and the church has a lot of influence on things. But, tribal religions still exist. It's quite interesting. When somebody is offended, they sometimes go to a shaman to put a curse on the person who offended them.

Poverty is huge. It's a huge fucking difference when you come to the capital, Luanda, and when you are in a village somewhere remote. You can tell that although Portuguese is the official language, it is still a second language to some people. The original Bangtu languages are still around (around Kuito it is Umbundu). Those places are magical. Really untouched nature and traditional lifestyle. No bullet holes or patches of tar from fires, the villages are beautiful. Very poor but beautiful. But this is the thing - even though the people have little money and posessions, there are few things to do with them. They are under a much lower financial pressure compared with the richer areas. No rent to pay, or things like that. Their life is simpler that way. Although education and healthcare in remote areas is still a problem. 

Speaking of healthcare, it needs a lot of development. Someone told me that the mortality rate for the dentist in Kuito is 13%. I think (and hope) it's bollocks but this is what I was told. Truth is, most doctors need medicine and equipment. Medicine does get shipped to Angola but apparently a part of it gets lost on the black market. Pharmacies are always guarded by guys with kalashnikovs. You can also see guys selling pills on the street from a wheelbarrow. Fuck knows how that works. 

Infections are also a problem. I was there during the dry season and that means dust everywhere. Even the smallest scratch gets infected instantly. I always carried bandages and disinfection with me everywhere I went because it was desperately needed. However, you need to be careful when treating someone's wound, there is a danger of HIV and hepatitis. 

Food was pretty great. Not much selection but mainly fresh, decend food. Even in Kuito, which is in central Angola, you could get pretty fresh fish and squid at the town market. There is a massive lack of spices and seasoning, which is a shock at the beginning but you get used to it quickly. Meat is scarce, though. In most areas, they only kill a cow when it can no longer work so beef is tough when you get it and pork can be dangerous (parasites). But chicken is abundant, usually sold alive (so home cooking can be gruesome) and fruit and vegetables are very fresh and delicious. We had an avocado tree in front of our office. It was heaven to pluck a fresh one from the tree in the morning and spread it on a bun with some jindungo (local chilli pepper) for breakfast.

One last point, as this is getting long. When I came back, I felt massive emptiness. Working there felt like it had a lot of meaning. The students were openly grateful and the children hungry for knowledge. You could see that the smallest bit of education made a great difference in their lives. It really mattered to them. We had very little materials, mostly teaching with just a board, no textbooks or multimedia. But the work was very rewarding. When I came back, I felt disgusted. Kids at school being demotivated (although I teach adults now so that's different but I was still a student back then), exams having some sort of meaning to people, the fucking complaints about there being nothing on television, the drama of catching a cold, etc. Dammit I really want to go back to Angola now...",0,1408343921,null,0,false,0,cjtdxgh,t3_2dsho2,t1_cjtdxgh,t1_cjt55hq,null,1435450705,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

The ECB is basing its monetary policy on what Germany wants. We are learning that this isn't what Germany needs.

Predictably the 'turn around' in south Europe has seen the German economy start to stutter. Why is this? Because suddenly the German worker is more expensive relative to the struggling nations*. Germany wanted a competitive southern Europe, they might just get it.

At this point the nations that have suffered from austerity actually want to keep this going. They want to knuckle down and actually see this transformation through now the greatest pain has been taken. It will be the richer countries that pushed for this that will suffer for it now. The race to the bottom is on.

The ideal at this point strangely is more restructuring for the south while the north spends on keeping itself afloat. This will see a net transfer of wealth to an increasingly competitive south (this is why stimulus is so tricky, the austere nation in a time of stimulus wins. It is a prisoners dilemma). Effectively stimulus in Germany can become jobs in the rest of Europe. I suspect we won't see this though. It would take some balls for the likes of Greece to actually be prepared to take this on politically.

Yeah, no that [story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Tyrol_Option_Agreement) was different. It was either go to the Reich whereever they might send you and keep your language and culture while losing your home land or stay and be forced to lose your language and your culture while keeping your home land. It was just a terrible decision to burden the people with. ""Luckily"" the war ended all that jazz, otherwise South Tyrolians might find themselves on Crimea today or something like that, as there were rumours floating around at that time that once Hitler had conquered the [""Lebensraum im Osten""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensraum) there would be enough land for South Tyrolians on Crimea.

Side note: I don't quite remember, but the thing with Putin's annexion of Crimea was a funny thing for all those separatists since they should all be in favour, but on the other hand they hate Russians because of the war and whatnot.

What is special and difficult about South Tyrol today is that it is basically a region with two major linguistic groups. Germans have lived there for centuries along with some Italians in the southern part. After the ascension of fascism more and more Italians were moved here. This didn't cease until the 1960s or so. And while those groups get along nowadays, it's more an unspoken two separate societies kind of agreement. So now South Tyrol is a country housing two groups, Italians who have no roots but a fatherland, and Germans who have roots but lost their fatherland.

Consensual sex outside marriage is sadly illegal in UAE, which is why she was sentenced. She also got an extra 3 months for perjury (lying to police). Later on she back tracked and said no it was rape after all but there was no evidence of this, forensic or otherwise, and the man testified in court that the sex was consensual, so the case was dismissed due to lack of evidence and she was allowed to leave.

If she had stuck to her rape claim, she would never have been sentenced. Rape is obviously illegal in Dubai and victims of crime are not punished for it.

Sure, it will be more difficult to come to agreements, but i don't think anyone would be against free trade, if the agreement restricts itself to that. Harmonising rules of the FDA with national safeguards should be really easy for example and there is no need for secrecy. I don't support TTIP and i am pretty sure i never will because i don't need to find compromises with companies trying to get their way. Not for an alleged 5% growth of the economy. It is simply not worth it.

Blockaded by a single country.

In 2013 the UK exported to the USA 39.967 M£ and imported 32.067 M£, that represent not even 10% of all UK trade ([data](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/Pages/Annual-Tables.aspx)).

Given that the weight of UK trade in its GDP is 46.7%, that means that your trade with the USA is roughly 4% of GDP. And you are meant to have a special relationship with the USA, their weight on your economy is highly above the average than it is for say other European countries or Latin America countries.

4% of GDP, you could live without that and be fine and dandy, but when it comes to Cuba, ""oh noes, they're only poor because of evul USA and trade embargo"" (when Cuba on its own highly restricts foreign trade).",0,1408353993,null,0,false,0,cjtg361,t3_2dt54y,t1_cjtg361,t1_cjtaxi5,null,1435297687,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,Alienqueen,null,null,"Oh boy, corruption… it's horrible… how many examples do you want me to tell you? I can tell a teaser. Here it comes: Small tobacco shops have been very traditional in Hungary. Orban&amp;chomps decided to invoke their license of selling tobacco (off they were allowed to continue selling other traditional ""tobacco shop"" items, but an enterprise simply CAN'T go around by selling candy bars and stamps, and many families have taken huge loans to start their little shop). 

Every tobacco shop owner had to apply for new license - and new people could do that, too. All this happened very quickly. Applications came in, were evaluated, and lo and behold, about 33% of the winners can be easily proven as either Fidesz-active or related/friends/family/family of friends of Fidesz-active people! These people got the best licenses on the most lucrative places. In a town, 50% of the licenses went to the NEIGHBOR&amp;BUDDY of the mayor. How they evaluated the application was NOT THE LEAST TRANSPARENT: the council in charge (Fidesz) DIDN'T WANT TO RELEASE THE APPLICATIONS AND INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THEY MADE THEIR DECISIONS! After long legal battles, they are being released (after the opposition had to pay 25 millions forint to make copies about the papers - which the gov delivered as couple of 100 kgs of MESS of papers - how they accounted the sum of 25 mil is UNCLEAR). The gov told the opposition NOT TO RELEASE THE DOCUMENTS TO THE PRESS. Luckily, the opposition said lol. 

According the documents released, the 15 000 applications were evaluated in 2 moths by 12 people (at least, counted with the average length of the applications, 250 pages/person/day, by the side of their full-time jobs - pretty much impossible!). They could get 60 points subjective (shop plans - who knows what it means, IT'S NOT PUBLISHED) scores and 60 objective scores (opens within months, open 12 h a day, keeps employees employed in 5 years, local boss). Only the people who could win got more than 50 subjective points, the others got under 25. So if you had good objective points, but worse subjective points you lost. If bad objective points, but good subjective points, you won (weird). People who applied for several licenses in the same area, one license got high points-the others low points, despite that the application was the very same, to every single letter, and the judge was the same, as for the same area, the judge was always the same. AND, according to the date on the reply documents, every 15000 document was made the SAME DAY (the 18th March, physically impossible). All the reply documents were the same, to the last letter, at every judge, so the applicants got no real explanation why they didn't get license. AND, the judges in question had no experience in the tobacco industry/tobacco market WHATSOEVER. 

Even a couple of interesting things have surfaced, like a voice recording from a Fidesz-only  meeting, where they discussed which applicants should get license, and a letter in which two Fidesz politicians listed the applicants that are Fidesz friendly and which are not… The winners belong/are part of a few huge companies - so congrats Orban to creating tobacco oligarchs, instead of helping ""family companies"", which was the reason why the gov wanted to re-regulate the tobacco market! So… many of these tobacco shops work with loss (50-60%), there is a monthly 20-30% recession on the tobacco market, black market flourishes.  And the story of the new subway line is even darker…

Oder die beiden jungen Schnaufis, die sich in voller Punk-Montur mit ihrem Hund und Bierdosen bei mir vor die Hütte gesetzt haben.

Niemand dürfte in einem zivilisierten Staat durch das Sozialnetz fallen - wenn das nicht funktioniert, sollten wir daran arbeiten.  

So Sätze sind total falsch:

&gt; Wenn jemand auf der Straße sitzt und bettelt, dann braucht der das Geld.“

Wir brauchen alle Geld.  Oder sowas:

&gt; Trotzdem bin ich kein Abschaum und kein Dreck.“

...die Idee dass ich jemanden der Bettelt als irgendwie niedrig betrachte - nein, ich will dem einfach kein Geld geben, und ich ärgere mich über die Andeutung, dass das einen zum schlechten Mensch macht.

Es tönt herzlos, und ich stehe voll dazu.  

Diejenigen, die mir richtig leid tun, sind die vorwiegend Alten, die sich irgendwie schämen, oder diejenigen die aus irgendwelchem Grund (z.B. psychische Krankheit) nicht dazu fähig sind, Hilfe zu finden - niemand sollte in Mülleimern grübeln müssen, aber das wirklich schlimme bei so vorwiegend betagten Personen ist, dass die das auch meist in aller Stille machen, ohne zu betteln.

true,RebBrown,NETH,The Netherlands,"2.2% growth? Still ain't enough to make up for what we lost. Besides, the government cut so much critical spending that poverty is on the rise, elderly care has been fundamentally ruined and the housing cooperatives still hold many skeletons in their closets. They might even drag some struggling cities down with them.


Example: Vlaardingen. 'Sociale huurbouw', affordable low-key rentals, is being demolished because the corporations want to build profitable middle-class housing. It also attracts people who rely on government aid, but that won't ever be said outloud. A former 'rijksbouwmeester' - an influential governmental cityplanner of sorts - who is a Vlaardingen native, has repeatedly criticized Vlaardingen's policy. The city will grow older, because all of the Netherlands is 'graying up', and the new houses they're building ain't elderly proof. The city will also shrink, so when the time comes to refurnish these houses for the crowd that lives/wants to live in Vlaardingen, it will be another major drain on the city's financials. 

And that's a trend in all of the Randstad, resulting in the cities ping-ponging an ever-growing group of poor people about while building houses for a group of people that might not want to live there, and if they do want to live there, they don't want to in some 10-20 years. Let's feature Schiedam. Schiedam, some 70-80k people and located right next to Rotterdam, is shit out of luck, because it is rocking a staggering 50%+ unemployment rate. Schiedam is throwing everything overboard just to stay afloat: the city archive, all its libraries, but the national government is pushing more and more bills for 'the negative aspects that reside in a city' down to the cities. Welfare costs are a done deal, but coming this year are the costs for the aid of troubled people, especially kids, whether they got probs at school, at house or mental ones, the organisation helps everyone. Schiedam has a massive amount of people who rely on this help but the city won't be able to afford it. Note, the national government is NOT sending more money to cities to make up for these changes.


So, a 2.2% growth? I wouldn't invest a dime into the Netherlands if I were you, because the government has made sure to secure a heavy weight we can't burden to our feet and slowly but steadily, that rock is slipping into the deep end.

Was ist ein »Schnaufi«, wo ist dieses Wort gebräuchlich, und wovon leitet es sich ab?

&gt; Niemand dürfte in einem zivilisierten Staat durch das Sozialnetz fallen - wenn das nicht funktioniert, sollten wir daran arbeiten.

Ein solcher Ansatz funktioniert prinzipiell nur für Leute, die sich an den Staat wenden können, ohne dadurch Nachteile zu erleiden, und die ihr Recht auf Hilfe nicht verwirkt haben.  Nicht wenige Obdachlose und ergo Bettler sind Leute, die sich dem Zugriff durch die Behörden zu entziehen versuchen, also praktisch ihr Dasein im Untergrund fristen.  Denen auf institutionalisierte Weise zu helfen, ist nur schwer möglich.

&gt; Ja aber dann ist das nicht mehr ""Betteln"". Der arbeitet für sein Geld.

Man könnte dann auch argumentieren, dass Bettelei eine Dienstleistung ist: Man gibt dem Geldgeber als Gegenleistung das Gefühl, Leid gelindert und dadurch etwas Gutes getan zu haben.

&gt; Wenn ich etwas unterstütze, dann lieber Methoden, solchen Leuten organisiert und nachhaltig zu helfen, denn die werden das besser machen als 50 Cent in eine Blechtasse.

Nur wie könnte das aussehen? Einerseits dürften nicht wenige Betroffene einfach unfähig sein, ihren Alltag einigermaßen zu organisieren, ohne jedoch die Kriterien für eine Betreuung zu erfüllen. Gegen ihren Willen wird man denen kaum helfen können. Andererseits kann ich mir vorstellen, dass einige auch einfach durchs Soziale Netz fallen, weil sie nicht wissen, wie sie ihre Rechte durchsetzen können, und wie man den Verwaltungstanz tanzt.  Nehmen wir nur die ehemalige Heroinsüchtige aus dem Artikel, die vom Jobcenter gesperrt worden ist, als Beispiel. Ich wüsste wirklich gern, ob sie dagegen alle Rechtsmittel genutzt hat, die ihr zur Verfügung gestanden hätten.",1,1408358846,null,0,false,0,cjtgyqs,t3_2dvehq,t1_cjtgyqs,t1_cjtgbib,null,1435298368,4,false,de,t5_22i0,4

The hacking of brussels etc seemed to be from FRA probably the hacking of merkel and others too.

FRA basically swedens nsa. What they where doing was illigal i think the brits didnt want to go on with it. Sweden on the other hand dont have much to say when it comes to the US either we comply or face consequenses like everyone else, exept maybie russia china and the uk.

http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/nya-uppgifter-om-nara-samarbete-mellan-fra-och-nsa_8812256.svd

dont know if google translate is good enugh but this section is what im reffering too:

""I ett särskilt projekt kallat Winterlight har FRA, NSA och GCHQ prövat att göra intrång. Ett hundratal datorer utsattes för intrångsförsök och av dessa lyckades man i fem fall installera spionprogram så att deras trafik omärkligt också gick till brittiska GCHQ. Vad Winterlight spanade på framgår inte.

""Även om den övergripande framgången var liten, så kan denna ansträngning ändå ses som en framgång som prov betraktat"", skriver NSA. Enligt Uppdrag granskning ville dock GCHQ dra sig ur projektet eftersom det var tveksamt om det var lagligt. FRA är enligt dokumenten däremot mycket intresserat av att dela denna teknik och få del av spaningsresultaten.""

qchq wanted out FRA didnt have any problems braking the law, and as such are more complient and a closer ally.

That also happens within the latin script.

And it can get worse, in Portuguese for example, the ""O"" often reads as ""U"" but if you put an accent then ""Ó"" reads as an open ""O"". That was quite confusing when I first started learning Polish, in there it's the exact opposite, the ""O"" reads as an open ""O"" and the ""Ó"" reads as ""U"".

- Indian Summer = Estiuet de Sant Martí (St. Martin's lil' summer)

- Milky Way = Via Làctia

- Sunshower = Pentinada (combing). There is a traditional Catalan song that goes ""It rains and the sun shines, witches comb their hair..."". Like combing after a shower, with little drops falling... you can imagine.


- Rain and snow = Aiguaneu or borrufada (lit. watersnow)

- Full moon = Lluna plena (lit. translation)

- Heavy rain = Ruixat, xàfec.

- Raining cats and dogs = ploure a bots i barrals. (more or less: raining barrels and vessels).


Some expressions I like:


- Setmana dels barbuts (Bearded men's week), the third week of January, traditionally a very cold one.

- When there are heavy thunders (""trons"") it is said that ""Sant Pere mou mobles"" (Saint Peter is rearranging the furniture).



edit: Also, with regards to month's weather... apparently we fucking hate February:

- De Febrers, pocs de bons (Februaries, very few are good).

- Febrer, mes mentider, un dia dolent i l'altre també (February, lying month, a day is bad, the following is too).

- Mata més el Febrer que el carnisser (February kills more than the butcher).

- Qui tus pel Febrer, tossirà pel Març i per l’Abril també (who coughs in February will also cough in March and April).

- Febrer ventós, cara de gos (Windy February, face of dog).

- El Febrer, de cap o de cua, l'ha de fer (February, at the start or at the end, is going to mess up).

- Pel Febrer, set capes i un barret (For February, seven blankets and a hat).

- Si el Febrer no febreja, tot l'any boigeja (If February doesn't ""februar"" (verb), all the year goes crazy).

Ein gutes Beispiel für sowas sind Ausländische Zuzüger, die nicht für Sozialhilfe qualifiziert sind.  Deinen Aussage stimmt absolut - aber hier ergibt sich die Frage, wo sollte der Staat helfen?

Ich bin stark der Meinung, wir müssen als reiche, demokratische Länder legitimen politischen Flüchtlingen helfen, und ihnen mit der Zeit die Möglichkeit zur Arbeit und Integration geben - aber dabei ist immer abzuwägen, wie man Einwanderung eingermassen unter Kontrolle hält.  Nicht unterdrückt, aber steuert.  Zu viele Sozialleistungen, und du ermutigst zu viel Einwanderung.  Zu wenig und du hast Bettler.

&gt; Nur wie könnte das aussehen?

Ich habe nicht die Lösung, und ich misstraue allen, die sowas behaupten.  Aber mit Drogenabhängigen haben einige Schweizer Städte das ziemlich OK gemacht (Portugal auch, glaube ich) - nach Jahrzehnten fruchtloser Repressalien.  ""Fixerstübli""  erlauben Heroinkranken Zugang zu sauberen Gratisspritzen, einem sicheren, warmen Ort zum dealen und spritzen, ärztlicher Betreuung, und Untersuchung des Stoffs - ohne Polizei.

&gt;Is this going to be a centralised effort?

No.

That would have to be a non-profit, more likely several spread out across different countries.

No.

Nothing.

&gt;How are you going to get food from from all over europe to Ukraine in such a way that it is still edible

Transportation.

&gt;Seize vehicles and petrol maybe?

That's illegal. A more probable solution would be to ask transport companies to donate vehicles or to donate space in vehicles already traveling to Ukraine.

&gt;If you think 'UN will pay for it' is a realistic idea you arent old enough to vote.

OP is aking reddit. Do you have a link to his comment where he asked the UN to pay? Thanks.

I don't know. You tell us.

&gt;Who is going to actually hand out the food, are you going to leave that to Poroshenko?

No one has decided yet. But thanks for contributing ideas. We need more positive people like you!

&gt;If not, are you paying the people to hand out food?

Doubtful. It will probably rely on volunteers.

&gt;Where are you going to find enough people to hand out food in a war zone.

I'm not an expert but my guess is the people who live in a war zone.

&gt;These cant be soliders or former soldiers or look like soliders as that would piss russia off.

Again, thank you for thinking ahead. You are really getting the ball rolling here.

&gt;How are you going to stop separatists simply stealing the food and the trucks they came in?

I don't know. Maybe you can share more of your expert opinion.

&gt;What happens to the Ukrainian producers and shops now the EU is handing out free food.

The same thing that happens to every shop in evry war zone after every humanitarian aid run. Nothing?

&gt;What happens to all these suddenly unemployed people.

true,GolemGorgor,NPDC,Nord-Pas-de-Calais,"Voyage léger, j'ai fait Lille-Paris avec des sacoches trop chargées et tu le sens passer, autant dans les montées que sur ta vitesse moyenne.  
Est-ce que tu vas utiliser un GPS, ton portable ou des cartes ? J'ai utilisé des cartes, c'est très simple mais j'ai eu des problèmes pour traverser les villes, j'ai énromément tourné pour retrouver la bonne départementale et je me suis d'ailleurs perdu au niveau d'Arras à cause de ça.  
J'ai également croisé un cycliste qui m'a dit qu'il fallait prévoir 10/20% de marge d'erreur en terme de kilométrage. Pour ma part j'ai fait un peu plus de 300km au lieu des 250km prévus.  
Pour ce qui est de la vitesse prévois petit. Je ne sais pas où tu en es aujourd'hui, mais moi je pensais aussi faire du 20km/h, j'ai tourné à un peu plus de 18km/h le premier jour, les deux suivant j'ai encore baissé vers 16km/h. Après j'étais beaucoup trop chargé, plus que toi tu le seras (enfin je l'espère).
Le plus important à mon avis c'est de prendre un cuissard, tes fesses souffriront moins, de bien vérifier ta position sur le vélo (pour les courts trajets de 15/20km je n'ai jamais eu de problème, mais après avoir fait 100km dans une journée, j'ai remarqué que je mettais trop de poids vers l'avant et du coup j'ai eu mal aux mains pendant tout le trajet).  
Pour planifier ma route j'ai utilisé Strava, le résultat a été très satisfaisant, je n'ai pas rencontré de problèmes (à part l'orientation dans les villes).  
Niveau consommation d'eau, je me situais autour de 2L par jour. J'ai dormi sous une tente et je te conseille de faire très attention au choix de l'emplacement, si tu décides de dormir sous tente, fais bien attention à bien dégager toutes les petites branches et autres saletés qui te dérangeront pendant la nuit, ne t'installe pas à côté d'un étang (j'ai entendu des crapauds/grenouilles chanter tout au long de la nuit).  
Prévois bien évidemment de quoi réparer une crevaison et prends 1/2 chambre(s) à air de rechange au cas où, une pompe évidemment et puis théoriquement pour un trajet comme celui-ci ça devrait aller.   
J'ai roulé sous la pluie, une bonne grosse pluie l'après-midi de la première journée, ça n'a pas été facile mais c'était une combinaison de plusieurs choses (j'étais perdu, je n'avais qu'un poncho pour couvrir le haut de mon corps et mes gants résistants à l'eau n'ont pas tenu le coup, mes bras et mains étaient trempées). Prévois aussi des lunettes de soleil, même quand il ne faisait pas spécialement beau je les portais, j'ai essayé une fois de ne pas en porter et je me suis pris deux bestioles dans les yeux quasiment immédiatement.  
Niveau nourriture j'avais pris de la semoule, c'est bien parce que c'est peu encombrant, ça nourrit et très facile à préparer. Par contre rajoute un petit quelque chose dedans, une tomate, du fromage, n'importe quoi pourvu que ça réhausse un peu le goût.  
Pour donner un petit coup de fouet entre les repas j'ai mangé environ 2 snickers par jour. N'hésite pas à prendre des pauses, même courtes, c'est vraiment reposant.  
***
Le plus important je pense que c'est quand même de ne pas forcer, ne te fixe pas d'objectif de distance/vitesse, tu risque de t'épuiser pour rien, surtout si à la fin tu prévois de faire la fête.

Disclaimer : les TR ne font pas partie de ma rémunération, mais j'ai un bon ami dont c'est le cas, il dispose également une voiture de service.

Hypothèse : un salarié veut être rémunéré 2000 € mensuels brut pour son travail. Son employeur est réticent. Ils trouvent un terrain d'entente : sachant que le salarié, habitant loin de son travail, mangera en ville chaque midi, il accepte d'être rémunéré en partie par des tickets restaurant, disons à hauteur de 300€. L'employeur ne paye que 50-60% de la valeur du TR, c'est à dire 150 à 180€. Son employé lui coûtera donc moins cher (évidemment ça peut sembler peu à cette échelle mais il faut remettre ça à l'année, * des dizaines d'employés), quant à l'employé il pourra utiliser ces TR à la place d'argent, qu'il aurait de toute façon dépensé, pour manger chaque midi, ce qui lui permet d'économiser autant que s'il avait été rémunéré 2k.

=&gt; Les deux agents économiques sont gagnants.

Les TR ne remplacent pas la rémunération, les TR ne sont pas là pour se payer un restau le dimanche. C'est clairement indiqué et il s'agirait de ne pas être hypocrite. C'est un système qui permet une meilleure flexibilité de la rémunération. Peut-être que, le cas échéant, le salarié de tout à l'heure n'aurait pas été employé car trop cher sans une partie de la rémunération en TR.

Deuxième exemple : la voiture de service. Cette fois-ci le salarié se voit proposer un véhicule pour lequel il ne paye pas l'essence ni l'entretien ni l'assurance et qu'il peut utiliser pour rentrer chez lui et aller au travail. Naturellement son salaire eût été plus élevé si l'entreprise ne consacrait pas d'argent à ce véhicule (s'il avait été embauché). Mais le salarié va de toute façon devoir prendre un véhicule, soit celui-ci, soit le sien, pour aller travailler. Or le véhicule n'a pas coûté autant à l'entreprise qu'au particulier (la TVA, déjà). Même raisonnement que plus haut : le salarié évite de dépenser son argent sur un véhicule + essence pour aller taffer et le système coûte moins à l'entreprise qu'une rémunération directe : les deux agents y gagnent.

&gt;A more probable solution would be to ask transport companies to donate vehicles or to donate space in vehicles already traveling to Ukraine.

Thats going to happen. Companies are going to donate several hundred vehicles and fuel to drive half way across europe into war zone. You cant rely on donated space when you are talking about several hundred million euros worth of perishable produce.

OP ""We can get funding for the transportation from UN""

&gt;I don't know. You tell us.

No, the answer is no. 

&gt;No one has decided yet. But thanks for contributing ideas. We need more positive people like you!

&gt;Doubtful. It will probably rely on volunteers.

&gt;I'm not an expert but my guess is the people who live in a war zone.

This is shit that needs to be decided and organised, and organised some more before you start buying produce  with emergency funds. You cant just rock up and hope for the best.

true,jeanralph,ZBSVUE,U-E,"&gt; Les TR ne remplacent pas la rémunération, les TR ne sont pas là pour se payer un restau le dimanche. C'est clairement indiqué et il s'agirait de ne pas être hypocrite

Dans mon expérience limitée du sujet, c'est pourtant exactement ce qui arrive. C'est effectivement une alternative à la rémunération qui est abusée au delà de l'usage prévu.

&gt; Les deux agents économiques sont gagnants.

Il n'y a pas que deux agents économiques. Etant donné d'une part la masse critique de personnes qui bénéficient du dispositif et d'autre part vu la difficulté relative de récupérer la monnaie sur le reliquat du montant du TR on peut s'interroger sur la répercussion des prix (tant qu'à faire, autant aligner les prix sur les montants exacts des différents tickets) pour les gens qui n'ont pas de TR. 

Cet impact potentiel sur les prix serait anecdotique s'il s'agissait d'actes conclus entre acteurs privés (après tout  si le système était avantageux sans intervention de l'Etat, alors je dirais tant pis pour les autres) mais vient alors l'exonération de charges patronales sur le TR jusqu'à un certain seuil qui fausse toute comparaison et rend plus difficile l'équilibre entre complément de salaire/TR. Si la somme correspondante mais versée comme salaire était exonérée elle aussi, le calcul serait peut-être différent.

Au-delà de l'aspect symbolique (paternaliste) que l'article soulève et qui me pose un peu problème, ça reste pour moi avant tout une question empirique : tout dépend de savoir s'il y'a un impact négatif sur les prix à cause des TR pour les gens qui n'en ont pas.

1. Du hast keine persönliche Anekdote geliefert, nur ""unwahrscheinlich"" gesagt. (Solltest du dich auf ""es wird weniger geflirtet"" beziehen, macht das NOCH weniger Sinn, weil ""meine Anekdote"" deine gar nicht ""trumpft"", sondern nur erklärt, warum deine Beobachtung nichts Schlechtes sein muss.)
 
2. Verkauf bitte nicht dieses eine Wort als elaborierte Argumentation, die nichts weniger als Statistiken zur Widerlegung verdient. (Das gleiche gilt übrigens, wenn du deine vorher gemachte Beobachtung meinst, obwohl ich das noch immer nicht hoffe, weil es wie gesagt noch unsinniger wäre.)

3. ""Persönliche Anekdote"" als Argument-Hammer funktioniert nicht in jedem Kontext. Ungültig sind persönliche Anekdoten, wenn ich versuche, meine Erfahrung zu verallgemeinern, entgegen Statistiken und Wissenschaft. Zum Beispiel, wenn ich sagen würde ""Ausländer sind alle kriminell, weil ich nur solche kenne"" oder ""natürlich hilft Homöopathie, bei meiner Oma hat es ja auch geklappt"". 

In diesem Kontext aber ging es nicht darum, Wissenschaft oder Statistiken zu widerlegen. Du hast  eine Beobachtung gemacht, eine andere Person hat eine Erklärung dazu geliefert, die du ohne jeden Aufwand einfach beiseite wischen wolltest. Dem habe ich widersprochen. Und hier reicht in der Tat einfach eine Anekdote, denn auf ""unwahrscheinlich"", also dem (wie gesagt auch noch völlig ungestützten) Zweifel an der Existenz eines Phänomens kann man tatsächlich reagieren, indem man Beispiele für eben diese Existenz nennt.

Russia would suffer terribly in a major war but they could fight a large scale sustained war and could only be defeated by full occupation. A poor economy would not prevent them from mobilising to their full potential and they have the resources to make and maintain a vast military.

When you are looking to connect individual cities, high speeds are good. But you are going to see smaller surrounding cities left out by this development (let alone suburbs). 

If you look at the population distribution in France, you have Paris and a few other cities, and that's it. Connecting them with fast rail lines makes sense. If you look at Germany (specifically, Western Germany) or the whole ""Blue Banana"" of Belgium, the Netherlands, Western Germany, Northwestern France and (to some degree) London, you'll find the population distributed evenly across vast landscapes. Zipping past all these people shouldn't really be your goal, even if you were to find space for the tracks. Moving at a slower pace and stopping a bit more often is a better proposition in these scenarios. 

Deutsche Bahn (Europe's largest rail company) is looking at commercial speeds of 250 km/h for their new generation of trains (ICx). Current ICE3 trainsets can reach 320 km/h (but only en route to Paris, because the fastest german track is limited to 300 km/h). New high-speed tracks are built for speeds of 300 km/h. The speed limitation is usually track curvature; reducing that requires incredibly expensive construction projects. Deciding to build another series of such things more or less next to the old ones a few years after construction is a tough sell at best. France does the same at 320 km/h.

Assuming an average speed of 350 km/h for the entire track from Berlin to Paris is unrealistic even if such a line would be build. Going that fast is hugely expensive, both up-front and operationally, and it doesn't connect as many people as a cheaper, slower track. There's no reason to pursue such a project.",0,1408371387,null,0,false,0,cjtkmp9,t3_2dswiq,t1_cjtkmp9,t1_cjtirj5,null,1435300423,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Il mio capo è italiano e il mio gruppo è estremamente internazionale: non abbiamo *nessun* tedesco. Abbiamo e abbiamo avuto italiani, americani, cinesi, indiani, spagnoli, vietnamiti etc. - L'unico tedesco che c'era è andato via l'anno scorso. Quindi non sono sicuro di poter rispondere correttamente.

Come studenti, da quanto ho capito anche dai miei colleghi che tengono qualche corso, gli studenti tedeschi non sono particolarmente preparati o motivati, in media. Alcuni sì, ovviamente, e io seguo un paio di tirocinanti piuttosto bravi. Ma a quanto ho capito nei test possono essere dei disastri ben peggio degli italiani.

A livello di collaborazioni, i tedeschi ci tengono tantissimo e fa parte degli aspetti essenziali che vengono valutati. Noi cerchiamo sempre collaborazioni, specie coi gruppi sperimentali per complementare il nostro lavoro computazionale. Ma in generale pare che fare dei proposal per fondi etc. senza collaborazioni sia quasi impossibile. Spingono da pazzi su questo aspetto. 

Inoltre hanno un ossessivo e capillare sistema di valutazioni, sia all'interno dei centri di ricerca che a livello nazionale, sia formale che informale, a un livello che non ho visto nè in Italia nè in UK. Il direttore del centro di ricerca appena nominato si sta facendo il giro di *tutti* i gruppi del centro di ricerca, uno per uno, per avere chiaro come redistribuire i fondi. 

&gt;La retribuzione che percepisci è adeguata al costo della vita? Hai delle agevolazioni fiscali in quanto dottorando?

Sì e sì. Il costo della vita tedesco è più o meno pari a quello in Italia.

&gt;La lingua è stata un problema o è stato sufficiente conoscere l'inglese?

Basta l'inglese e Google Translate. Molte persone che sono lì da anni non sanno ancora un tedesco decente, pure se la cavano benissimo. L'unico problema può essere in certi uffici o con i documenti, ma lì appunto sopperisce Google Translate o il tedesco dell'ufficio accanto una tantum. 

L'espressione fondamentale da conoscere è *zum mitnehmen*, ovvero ""da portar via"". Se vai in un locale tedesco e chiedi qualcosa da portar via dicendo ""take away"", ti guardano basiti e perplessi. Giuro. 

Ovviamente poi stando lì un po' di tedesco lo assimili per osmosi, e ora diciamo che posso farmi capire con due grugniti per cose molto base.

&gt;Alla luce della situazione lavorativa attuale preferiresti stabilirti a lungo termine in Germania, cercare impiego altrove o tornare in madrepatria?

Mi potrebbe piacere stare in Germania, ma non credo necessariamente lì dove sono. Una città come Monaco o Berlino non mi dispiacerebbe. In generale ho dei cazzi psicologici/di salute di cui preferirei non parlare ora (in parole povere: depressione -ne deriva che questo è un AM**A**A, sorry!) per cui stare all'estero 365 giorni l'anno potrebbe causarmi dei problemi, ora come ora.",0,1408372778,null,0,false,0,cjtl8bc,t3_2dvsg9,t1_cjtl8bc,t1_cjtkycq,null,1435300845,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5

Bon sinon. Le ton est barbant et ça me donne envie de m'endormir, c'est peut-être aussi du à l'assez mauvaise qualité du son et à la réverb. Ensuite, quand on filme une fenêtre avec une caméra vidéo et qu'on est en intérieur avec un éclairage d'intérieur franchement dégueulasse, on met des filtres aux fenêtres, ça s'appelle du CTO. Ou alors on investit dans de l'éclairage à la bonne couleur de température, assez puissant pour supprimer le contre-jour de la fenêtre, et assez nombreux pour éviter les ombres parasites. Ou alors.... On fait l'inverse, on met la lumière du jour derrière la caméra et on évite de détruire les yeux de tout le monde avec cette mise en scène.

Sinon, le montage est un peu bizarre, on sent l'envie de donner du rythme, façon Bref, j'imagine, puisque plus personne ne se sent de faire autre chose. Sauf que Bref c'était très bien foutu et très travaillé. Là, ça sonne faux.

Les inserts de textes sont... Assez moyens. Aucun style, aucune logique, même façon doge ça aurait été plus sympa. C'est dommage de s'inventer un logo pour ne pas en profiter et se faire une charte graphique qui le suive un petit peu.

Je ne juge que sur une seule vidéo, hein, mais elle ne m'a pas donné envie de regarder le reste.

Also Budapest is just so much more impressive that in comparison but not objectively vienna pales completely. Eg: the ridiculously huge national parliament which basically looks like a normal parliament on steroids, the main churches just tower over the normal town, the Buda castle on the hill and the monument opposite on the Buda hill dominate the city. 

In vienna everythings kinda samey whereas in budapest if you look in a side-street theres bound to be some old building with various designs and statues and the man attractions are massive in comparison to the normal buildings whereas in Vienna the big palaces are basically the same thing as a normal building.

2 party system, with the same media opposition to said 2 party system known from the U.S.. The state media is a problem, but the world has seen worse in Italy, with Berlusconi owning almost the entire media before his divorce.

The political prisoners are charged with actual crimes and get a process. Not a fair process, but a process. That's a lot more than not getting a process at all.

Venezuela isn't well governed or fair, but what's the competition? The U.S., that supported a coup on the democratically elected Chavez, which was one of the reasons for his paranoia? The U.S., that holds hundreds of prisoners, which it denies a trial, lawyer, health and human decency, *apart* from the fact that it tortures them? If they are universally accepted as a democracy and if Italy was considered a democracy while Berlusconi owned all the media and if Hungary is considered a democracy while actively silencing journalists and if we consider Irak and Afghanistan democracies because they say they are, why should we not consider Venezuela at least equal to Irak, while not having nearly as many political prisoners as the U.S. has illegal prisoners?

Also who says that we need to ""destroy"" Ukraine farming industry? It will be only a 300 truck column filled with Norwegian smoked salmon, Finnish cheese, Estonian Chocolate, Polish Kielbasa, Latvian smetana, Lituanian, cream, Italian Pasta, French Champagne etc. And on the way back we can fill those lorries with Ukraine Beer and Vodka and send one of those lorries to 300 cities around Europe and free Beer and Vodka festival! With fireworks! Lets paint those lorries pink and have live media coverage from that column all over the globe. Live cams from inside, all that shit. Celebrities travelling with it, having a concert at the target towns Lugansk and Donetsk! 

Okay, maybe not pink. How about light yellow with a blue star? 

The idea is to support Ukraine. And to show Russia that we can function. That the Russian policy in Europe won't work (they are trying to separate unity with ie. people like Le Pen, UKIP etc.). That we don't lie. That the people in Ukraine can believe in us. 

The value of this kinda PR and media action could be easily ten or hundred millions. Think about the marketing effects in Asia, USA etc. when they see European quality food being sooo goood and tasty, the Freedom Food and Aid truck-lorry goddamn Europeans taking all the media coverage and having free Beer and Vodka Festivals... the effect could be snowballing! 

Don't be so goddamn cynical and whining. If you don't care about Ukraine and what's going on there, the next is that you're going to pay more and more for it. And as we have seen, our economy is going to recession for this. It means lost jobs and other shit.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"On an ELI5 level, yes. Generally, if investors demand only low yields for buying a bond, that's a good sign, an expression of faith that the issuer (here: the Irish government) will be able to pay it back in full at its due date (here: in ten years). Technically yields are not the same as interest rates, but they're similar enough for the purpose of this discussion and both are generally an expression of perceived risk. 

However, there's another interesting concept that plays into this, which is opportunity costs. What it means is that, if you hadn't invested in bonds, you could have done something else with the money, like buying shares or a house to rent out. So, opportunity costs are the profits from investments you had the opportunity to make, but didn't take because you decided to do something else with your capital. If a 2% yield on a bond is ""good enough"" for investors, this means that they're not particularly excited about other opportunities to invest their money in, perhaps because they don't think the potential for higher profits makes up for the higher risk, and that's not a good thing.

Yet another aspect that plays into this is that those 2% are *nominal*. That is, if you invest €100 today, you'll have €122 in ten years, but those €122 won't have the same purchasing power as they have today, because of inflation. The ECB incidentally has a target of 2% inflation, which means that if they met that goal those €122 in ten years would buy you the exact same amount of goods as your €100 investment would have today, so while, nominally, you have gained €22, in practice you can still only buy the same amount of goods as you could have bought today.  
The problem here is that currently inflation in the Eurozone is at only about half a percent. You probably know that a high inflation rate is bad, because people's savings, promised pensions and so on lose value, but too low inflation is bad as well. There's even a risk of deflation, which is a negative inflation rate, which would mean that your €100 will buy you *more* tomorrow than they do today, and instead of buying a new car or a house today you're better off if you just leave the money under your mattress for as long as you can hold out with what you already have, which is bad for the economy. So, low yields might mean that investors think that those 2% will actually be a profit in real terms (in purchasing power, as opposed to nominally), because they expect inflation to remain low.  
For the comparison with the UK or the US, this aspect means that investors could simply believe that Eurozone inflation will remain below that of the pound or the dollar, so even if the nominal yields may be lower for Ireland the profit they expect to make in real terms might still be higher than in the UK/US, because nominal profits minus loss to inflation works out to more despite the lower nominal gains.

Despite all this, that trust in Ireland has been restored to the point where bond yields are low is still a very good thing.",0,1408375491,null,0,false,0,cjtmh45,t3_2dvrkz,t1_cjtmh45,t1_cjtl70x,null,1435450485,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Rock Island is more relaxed: rock / pop music in a fishing hut at the end of the pier, worth a quick visit if anything for the scenery (it has a restaurant until 23ish). 

Near there you have The Barge, which is a big pub with live music. Nice, but nothing too special. 

If you want to dance and still like a posh environment, try the Marano area near Riccione: there are many many places on the beach. Usually they don't charge to get in, but drinks are expensive. 

If you find yourself a girl or want to walk on the beach while there, pay attention: there are a lot of pickpockt and worse. 

Nearer to Rimini, near Marebello/Miramare, the Carnaby is a three floor disco cathering to foreigners. Not too bad. Near there is the Stills pub, which has music and allows dancing: lot of groups of foreigners pass there for pub crawls.

In Bellariva, check out Life disco, cathering to foreigners as well. In front of the place, in the square, there is Fuera, the local gay bar and Bizzarro, a normal pub. 

In the hills of Riccione, there are a lot of well known discos (Cocorico, Prince, Pascià). They should be open or if not, they organize parties somewhere. 

In the city centre: FOB is a new place with lots of craft beers from all over; in Piazza Cavour, under the Vecchia Pescheria, there are a lot of pubs and maybe a couple of dancing places.

Nope. [It can involve both, and more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing#Ethnic_cleansing_vs._genocide).

For example, in the Balkans, [mass rape was an instrument of ethnic cleansing.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_the_Bosnian_War)

Forced sterilization and forced removal of children to be assimilated by a desirable family absolutely qualifies as ethnic cleansing.

Ahahaah.

Comunque, il gusto è parecchio importante, you guessed it right: per quanto ne sappiamo, i recettori del sapore amaro si sono evoluti proprio per riconoscere le tossine. Moltissime tossine vegetali sono amare: stricnina, caffeina, etc. La famiglia di questi recettori è conservata in tutti i vertebrati, dai pesci in su, quindi sicuramente è servita a qualcosa. Il punto è che se mordi una pianta e questa è amarissima e ti fa schifo, non la mangi, quindi insomma, hai un grezzo riconoscimento di ""cose che fanno bene/cose che fanno male"".

È molto interessante IMHO che alcuni di questi recettori riescano contemporaneamente a essere molto promiscui, riconoscendo migliaia di sostanze anche chimicamente molto diverse, ma stando bene attenti a *non* riconoscere quello che non devi riconoscere come amaro (zuccheri o grassi, per dire). Il mio lavoro vuole capire un po' questo.

true,CafeClope,cocarde,Cocarde,"&gt; Sauf que quelqu'un les comble, tes 50% de valeur que l'employeur ne paye pas. D'une part c'est l'Etat via les cotisations non versées par rapport au même montant payé en salaire, d'autre part ce sont les consommateurs ne payant pas en tickets-resto qui vont indirectement financer la marge du resto pour payer la commission dûe à la société Accor (Edenred maintenant), ceci via des prix plus élevés.

C'est très discutable... ne pas gagner d'argent =/= en dépenser. En tout cas tu peux voir ça come une subvention à l'emploi. L'Etat profite plus à ce qu'il y ait de l'embauche qu'il ne perd à subventionner les TR, en tout cas c'est le raisonnement suivi. Quant aux autres consommateurs qui paieraient plus à cause des TR, là ça devient ridicule... si les commissions les gênent, ils n'ont qu'à ne pas les accepter. Tiens donc, ce n'est pas le cas. Le fait de pouvoir accepter les TR attire certains clients (pour ça que les supermarchés les acceptent aussi). Même chose pour le paiement par carte bancaire d'ailleurs...

&gt; D'autre part cette obsession de RH pour le ""coût de la masse salariale"" est absurde et dangereuse. Les salariés bénéficient ainsi d'avantages moins protégés que le salaire (en plus de contraintes sur la façon de le dépenser). Les investisseurs sont aussi trompés sur le coût réel de la main d'oeuvre. Enfin l'Etat et les acteurs sociaux perdent de l'argent via des avantages défiscalisés.

C'est uniquement ton opinion. Les salariés bénéficient d'un pouvoir d'achat supérieur à ce qu'il serait si leur rémunération n'était qu'en argent. Je ne vois pas pourquoi les investisseurs (?) ne seraient pas au courant du fonctionnement des TR et des politiques salariales en général. L'Etat ne perd pas d'argent, il en gagne moins, à la limite. Et si ça ne lui plaît pas, il n'a qu'à le fiscaliser (s'il ne le fait pas c'est qu'apparemment il gagne plus à booster l'emploi quitte à gagner moins sur chaque salarié).

Dans ton dernier paragraphe, tu confonds tout. Il est évident qu'un salarié qui vient au taf en tram n'a aucun intérêt à négocier un véhicule de service. Néanmoins ces véhicules sont parfois nécessaires à l'activité (mon pote est technicien info, il doit pouvoir se balader dans les différents centres de la boîte). Quant à l'influence sur l'environnement ou aux embouteillages : 1) encore une fois un véhicule de service ne remplace par les TEC, quand bien même un salarié dispose d'un véhicule il n'est pas obligé de le ramener chez lui... 2) les externalités écologiques sont peu prises en compte par l'entreprise directement, c'est au législateur de l'imposer 3) les flottes de véhicules d'entreprise sont à la fois plus récentes et mieux entretenus que la plupart des véhicules particuliers, ils polluent moins.",0,1408381903,null,0,false,0,cjtprli,t3_2dvdhq,t1_cjtprli,t1_cjtp2e6,null,1435303131,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

true,citracado,intermediate,intermediate,"First: the differences between German dialects and English dialects just are not the same. Learning Australian english vs American english is not as big of a difference as standard German vs the dialect where I live. 

It is important for me to learn dialect because I live in a part of Austria where there is quite heavy dialect, and though people can understand standard German, there are some people I come across on a daily basis who do not speak it comfortably/well. 

Rather than responding with ""Häh?"" or ""Bitte?"", I would like to be able to understand them so that I can continue to communicate. 

This is especially an issue when I visit my friends' families. Usually their family members live in small villages where only dialect is spoken. They tend to find it easier to speak english with me than to use standard German. But they are usually not very comfortable speaking english, either. 

In these situations, the people will try to speak simply when they're speaking directly to me. But when I am the only non dialect speaker around (eg, at the dinner table), it's mostly dialect. So I can either cut into the conversation and switch to english (and make the conversation harder on almost everyone else), or I can try my hardest to learn dialect while I'm there and also on my own. 

Understanding the dialect in the area you live in is mandatory to integrate comfortably into the life there. It may not be strictly necessary for survival, but without it, there is a part of the social life that you will always miss. Trying to learn it passively is not good enough, at least for me, because as an adult non-native speaker, it is just not that simple. 

I recognize that my situation is not the same as many people on this board, since it seems that most people are living in countries that are not German-speaking and are learning the language as a hobby or for school. In those cases, the motivations are definitely different and probably have way more to do with intellectual curiosity. For me, however, I consider it 100% non-optional.
