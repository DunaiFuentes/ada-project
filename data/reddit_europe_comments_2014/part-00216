Nobody is going to invade you, nor embargo your country or something like that. If you don't want others telling you how to run your country, just ignore them. Then they will ignore you, most importantly ecb will stop pretending your debt is investment grade which will lead to real bankruptcy.

&gt;but ""look at the results"" as if the only factor at play is Greek ineptness is just plain wrong. 

Greece had big problems with debt before euro. Your public debt [was already higher than 100% in 1996](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis#Unsustainable_and_accelerating_debt-to-GDP_ratios), which was a horrific result for a country at your economy level.  
Without drastically cheaper - almost Germany level - credit due to being in the euro you would collapse way before, although it would be much easier to fix this then than today. Your government at the time must have known that, it explains why they [falsified their economic data to enter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Financial_Audit,_2004).  

&gt;Are you joking? 

Who attacked and occupied you?  
There was a very small conflict with Turkey over Cyprus, but that's it. 

Internal conflicts don't count - if you fight with each other it's nobody's else fault. I even counted civil war as foreign just because of a very small foreign involvement.  ",0,1406514280,null,0,1406514738,0,cj9ng4i,t3_2bv5lv,t1_cj9ng4i,t1_cj9lig8,null,1434933032,-4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-4

Security Council and their soft power has been ranked as the most expansive and effective on the globe. They're projected to become one of the largest economies in the region in the future, with their recovery being one of the most robust. 

Look at it from a realpolitik perspective. The United Kingdom refused to go to war with us in Vietnam. Perfectly understandable. But that made many in the United States salty *(rather ironic since the French got salty at us for the same reason)*, hence our limited support during the Falklands War, when the State Department *(who supported neutrality)* and Defense Department *(who supported Britain)* caused our government to have a bi-polar war with itself with Reagan as the mediator. 

And just look at Syria. They refused to go to war with us there as well, despite the French getting pissed *(and us as well to a degree)* at them *(and then the French getting pissed at us for not going in after Britain pulled out)*. 

Hell, in Libya, it was the UK, France &amp; other European countries which *dragged us* into *that*. 

So, it kinda becomes understandable. Tony Blair was looking at Vietnam &amp; The Falklands in my opinion, and wanted to ensure future U.S. support. We didn't force them to do shit. The British made that decision themselves. And their government was *pretty god damn eager*. 

Afghanistan, personally, I think was pretty legitimate. The Taliban were providing protection, support &amp; safe haven to a group which attacked not only my country's military infrastructure, but it's civilian infrastructure as well. Plus, you know, they're a religious extremist group with a medieval policy of governing.

There's no sense in this, thus it's impossible to answer this question. 
If you have self-determination you 'deserve' it, whatever it means, if you don't, you don't.  

Don't use terms used to describe interpersonal relations to describe international relations. Only power really exists.   

&gt;This is so idiotic I don't know where to start. Can you please prove that ""without joining the eurozone the Greek economy would collapse much sooner""? Please? Just one citation...

Euro was a savior because it converted external debt to quasi-internal. Basically Greece bought euro at marginal exchange rate for ALL units of its currency, which would be impossible on a free exchange market.    
This is the single most important point! Joining euro is the only thing in the world that can save a country with unsustainable external debt, if they can.      

Additionally, interest rates on Greek eurobonds were 10%-15% before euro. Then they fell to ~4%. Without euro you would have today's levels of debt about 10 years ago, additionally with much higher interest rate, AND exchange rate would be drastically falling due to rapidly increasing external debt payments.  It's a very simple and obvious prediction.   

On a related note, demanding a 'citation' for economic prediction is hilariously funny. It's not real science, do you know that?  

&gt;That's based on what exactly? It's not horrific in the least. Here, read this: Determinants of the growth and sovereign debt correlation

High levels of debt naturally form in rich countries because they have tons of abundant capital which can't find any sensible investment - because economy is already very developed. Which means there's always going to be capital needed for new government debt - it's overabundant. See Japan.  

None of this applies to Greece at any point in time.  

&gt;Are you seriously making the case that the Greek government conspired to enter the eurozone in a desperate plan to avoid imminent bankruptcy? This is some next level shit. 

Because a government which falsified it's deficit data to enter euro couldn't have done that! It's unthinkable.

The hand wavy dismissal of the argument from defence of French Secular culture isn't convincing either. What the veils represent as stated in the Quran: 

""O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful."" 

Is women being tasked with taking responsibility for the sexual desires of both sexes. The practise I find is fundamentally limiting, and an indication of unfair treatment for women. Even if you make the argument that it was a matter of practicality, that the women were at risk of being raped as a matter of circumstance associated with the time, we have to remember that the Quran is supposedly dictated by Gabriel as a message from Allah, this would mean that Allah would be aware of the risk of rape (and how couldn't he be? He's supposedly omniscient) and could address it if he wanted, but instead we have the institution of a practise which puts all responsibilty on women. Why?

Certain things aren't excused by cultural relativism, things like murder, things like rape, and I feel if a practise can be established as having been put in place for the purpose of supression of the liberties of one half of the population, that it shouldn't be allowed to be excused either.

We're not just talking about the practicality of ""oh will a small percentage of people doing it REALLY hurt?"" we're talking about what it represents if France allows a single citizen to be subjected to an inherently unequal practise. It would represent the failure to protect the liberty the author of this article claims they're discarding.

true,dirkt,null,null,"&gt; Yes I a talking about molten-salt reactors and Generation 4 nuclear reactors

None of the existing reactors in Germany are of this type.

&gt; Also it might be possible to switch to a thorium fuel cycle.

Maybe, but so far no one has built a working thorium plant. I guess there's a reason for it.

&gt; Transitioning to new generations of nuclear reactors is no less realistic than increasing the efficiency of renewable energy sources, I would suggest it is even more. It mostly requires the political will to do so. 

The main political problem with existing nuclear plants is that the industry is making a lot of money with these, because they already paid for themselves, and now just generate money. So switching to new designs (which don't even exist yet) or switching to renewables (where the technology does exist) makes no difference in that respect.

If it turns out at some stage that thorium reactors actually work, we can still build them. OTOH, investing in renewables is the safer choice, because they are, well, renewables. They don't need any fuel that will eventually run out.

&gt; Japan is more dense than Germany everywhere.

No. Japan has much more mountains, which are sparsely populated, and much bigger cities like Tokyo. Look again. :-)

&gt; Overall the safety record of nuclear is much better than any other form of energy production.

If you count single desasters, yes. If you count the actual results of the desasters, no. You are skewing the comparison by looking at it in a particular way. 

&gt; You have to mine the stuff before you can use it.

Yes. Germany has coal, though it is running out. Which is why there were coal plants in Germany in the first place.

&gt; you just shift the problem from your borders to other borders.

Let me repeat: We are not planning to use coal in the long run. This is temporary. And there's no reason (except greed) why other countries couldn't implement proper safety standards.

Coal mining and coal plants are not dangerous or dirty if done correctly. You are inventing a bogey-man to justify your liking of nuclear. The only problem with coal is climate effects, and that it will eventually run out.

&gt; Coal ash can be filtered out somewhat but would always affect those vulnerable to asthma and cardiovascular problems.

I don't know of a single case where coal ash has been a problem in plants of the type used in Germany. Please give a source. (And no sensationalist newspapers behind paywalls, please).

&gt; ""Benjamin Sovacool "". I have read his work

I haven't. That was just a random quote to show even the sources you linked to contain differeing opinions.

But I have been witnessing the effects of Cernobyl, even if it was hundreds of kilometers away. We got a measureable amount of the fallout here in Germany. People stopped eating vegetables that were grown in the open for some time.
And I've seen pictures of the nature around Cernobyl decades after the disaster.

As long as nuclear power plants work as planned, nuclear power looks really good. But the problem is that when it goes wrong, it goes wrong in a big way. You are willing to put up with those incidents, because you count them as single incidents and compare them to multiple incidents in other industries, and you completely neglect the scale of the bad effects. You can of course have your opinion on that, but if anything goes wrong in our country, it's us who have to suffer from it, not you. So our opinion is different, and we acted accordingly. That's all.

No need to impose your opinion on us. :-) EOT from my side.

Je tra√Æne pas mal sur internet sans rien y comprendre, donc quand je tombe sur des articles li√©s aux nouvelles technologies au sens large je suis largu√©e et √ßa commence √† m'agacer. 

Quand j'ai un probl√®me avec un truc que je ne sais pas faire en informatique, soit je laisse tomber, soit je demande mon fr√®re, soit je demande √† google (oui √ßa m'arrive quand m√™me).

En tra√Ænant sur reddit, j'ai suivi les r√©v√©lations de Snowden, donc les questions de la transparence, de la neutralit√© du net, etc je ne comprends pas √† 100% mais je suis capable de m'y int√©resser plus que le citoyen lambda.

Mais d√®s qu'il y a plein de sigles techniques je suis perdue et c'est illisible pour moi. C'est un grand m√©lange informe, c'est du chinois :)

Donc j'ai demand√© √† mon fr√®re, qui cr√©e des sites web, vers quel site me tourner pour essayer de me former un peu et il m'a conseill√© le site du z√©ro, qui est pas mal. Jusqu'alors html, css, js, java etc √ßa n'√©voquait rien de concret pour moi, j'√©tais pas capable de comprendre une conversation √† propos de tout √ßa. Maintenant apr√®s avoir juste suivi un cours bien fait √ßa va beaucoup mieux, m√™me s'il va falloir que je relise tout √ßa plusieurs fois et que je pratique un peu pour que √ßa rentre.

This is Russian Army going into Ukraine. Could be some reservists and/or volunteers with them, but those weapons are not usable without weeks of training and need trained officers to coordinate that action (locations, weather reports, calculations, spotters, ammo supply etc.). 

Source: I'm familiar with all those vehicles and weaponry. I've been teaching conscripts to use those Artillery pieces, both. And of course shoot with them live rounds multiple times. And no, I'm not a active member of Finnish Army, I'm in reserve now. And doing this because I'm full of this Russian propaganda. Truth is my co-pilot. Perkele.

* The artistic &amp; intellectual strength of France in the 1700s (we're a nation that loves nothing better than philosophy and theorizing) that still influences today's academia
* The influence of Communism and syndicalism in the 20th century and the violence (not physical violence, but rhetorical) of social and class conflicts, that influences our economic, business and industrial mindsets
* The Third Republic's emphasis on loyalty to the State and the formation of a strong State, that puts State law above all others including divine commandments. This colors our modern political culture and what we expect from our nation.

Den gab es vorher auch, aber mehr so rumnuschelnd. Dass das eine das andere deckt und f√∂rdert, finde ich doppelt gruselig. Das sind zwei √úbel, die einander nicht bek√§mpfen, sondern BEIDE gegen friedliebende Menschen mit Grips gerichtet sind.

Ich sehe das Hauptproblem bei so ziemlich allem in Gruppendenken. Entweder hat (die vermeintlich homogene Gruppe) A recht und (die vermeintlich homogene Gruppe) B ist b√∂se, oder andersrum. √úber einzelne Sachverhalte kann kaum diskutiert werden weil viele gleich ma√ülos √ºbertreiben und sich logischem Denken einfach nicht verpflichtet f√ºhlen.

In dem Kommentar von dir, den jemand unten verlinkt hat, sagst du ja auch ""it seems Jews are not capable of living with others"" --- das ist so als w√ºrdest du sagen, alle Amerikaner seien Kriegstreiber oder alle Deutschen Nazis. Wieviele Gegenbeispiele brauchst du, um zu glauben, dass es Stuss ist? Und rechte (nicht nur rechte Israelis) sagen genau das √ºber Araber, ""guck mal wie gemein ""der Araber"" oder ""der Muslim"" zu anderen ist, wo die leben gibt's nur Krieg und Leiden"" etc.

Es ist ja nicht so, dass es das von dir beschriebene ""Opferdenken"" nicht gibt, aber das ""den Juden"" anzuh√§ngen, erkl√§rt erstens nicht die, die das selber ansprechen und kritisieren z.b. http://www.yiddishkayt.org/rapmay2013/

&gt; Today‚Äôs Jewish establishment, for reasons political, cynical, but more often thoughtless, has become fully devoted to a vision of Jewish history that attempts to unite under a banner of victimhood. Under this banner, it would seem, future generations can be bullied into supporting militarism and chauvinism, scared into religious observance, or guilted into acts of differentiation and group identity at the expense of understanding a common vision of humanity and of a better, more loving world.

vor allem ist das √úBERALL und IMMER so. Ob ein Schl√§ger sagt ""der hat dumm geguckt"", ob Hitler sagte, die Polen h√§tten angegriffen, und man m√ºsse Russland angreifen, bevor die es machen, ob Bush von seinen ""Mushroom Clouds"" faselte und Saddam zur akuten Bedrohung f√ºr alle und jeden hochstilisierte.... die Liste ist endlos. Scientology etwa meint, den einzigen Weg zur kompletten Gesundung des Geistes und K√∂rpers zu haben, also sind alle die, die sie kritisieren, sozusagen des Teufels und wollen sie nur daran hindern, die Menschen zu retten. Stalin und Mao hatte den Westen, jeder und alle Angreifer haben Ausreden und sind das Opfer. √úber evangelikale Christen oder radikale Muslime brauchen wir gar nicht reden, das kennt man ja. Wie gesagt, die Liste ist endlos.

Kollektivschuld gibt es nicht, Kollektivstrafen sind unzul√§ssig. Und kein Land ""profitiert"" von dieser Tatsache √ºbrigens mehr als  Deutschland (sonst g√§be es das n√§mlich gar nicht mehr, da w√§re hier 'ne sch√∂ne Weide und sonst nix). Was nicht okay ist, wenn es Israel macht, ist auch nicht okay, wenn es andere machen. D.h. ja, die Besatzung und Besiedelung des Westjordanland, und die Besatzung von Gaza, sind nicht haltbar und nicht zu rechtfertigen, und Ost-Jerusalem ist auch so ein Ding --- aber genaus wenig w√§re es haltbar, einfach Israel √ºberrennen zu wollen. Und das wollen schon manche. Die, genauso wie die Rechten in Israel, machen es unheimlich schwer, irgendwelche Fortschritte zu machen. W√§hrenddessen verrecken weiter Leute oder leben bestenfalls in Furcht und Armut. Und Israelis und Unterst√ºtzer im Westen leben mit der Schuld von Kriegsverbrechen, die sie sich nicht eingestehen k√∂nnen -- ein unheimlich hohes Selbstbild und eine sehr sch√§big Realit√§t ist zwar nicht das gleiche wie tot oder arm sein, aber sch√∂n ist es auch nicht, keiner von diesen Pfeifen ist *gl√ºcklich*, die sind eher verbissen und schmallippig und sagen mehr als 3 Worte nur wenn sie mit Dreck werfen, um von sich abzulenken. Gewinner sehen anders aus xD

Nur ein kleiner Prozentsatz der Menschen sucht gezielt nach Nachrichten. Die meisten wollen hingegen, dass ihnen etwas vorgelegt wird. Das geht auch online, aber es gibt eine Menge Hindernisse: PDFs sind oft nicht sehr lesefreundlich, es fehlt das Geld f√ºr einen Tablet-Rechner, l√§ngere Texte lassen sich nur schlecht auf dem Smartphone lesen. Viele Aspekte sprechen noch f√ºr Print.

Das sind meiner Meinung nach ziemlich r√ºckhaltlose Argumente f√ºr Printmedien. Seit wann schaut man sich Artikel auf Nachrichtenseiten als PDF an? Wer kann sich ein Zeitungsabonnement, aber kein g√ºnstiges Tablet leisten? 

Zudem ist das Lesen von l√§ngeren Texten auf dem Smartphone nicht halb so schlimm, wie das Hantieren mit einer meist relativ gro√üen, un√ºbersichtlichen und unhandlichen Zeitung, f√ºr die man auch nicht unbedingt immer Platz hat. Au√üerdem kann man sich z.B √ºber die Tagesschau App auch einfach die neueste Tagesschau anschauen/h√∂ren, wenn man gerade nicht lesen kann/m√∂chte, diese Vielseitigkeit werden alte Medien niemals bieten k√∂nnen.

Long answer: Freedom and liberty as defined in France doesn't work the way it is in the US. Both Constitutions have the same words, but not defined in the same way. 

As I said: State law is above all others. That includes divine law. The state meddles in religious affairs all the time - which is why major religions have formed national councils (CRIF, CNCM) to talk with State officials on a level ground. Which is why you have subsidies for Aid El-Kebir in a few communes, or public money that goes to fund confessional schools. It's rare, but it happens. 

So the State regulates religion. Does freedom of religion still apply? It does, but in the private sphere. You worship however you want in private or within your religious community. In public, fuck freedom.

Je me permet de donner mon avis.

Le monde de la prog et celui de l'info (en g√©n√©ral, celui de la maintenance etc) est vraiment totalement diff√©rent.

On peut savoir tr√®s bien prog et √™tre une tanche sur un PC (le d√©panner, changer des pi√®ces, se d√©brouiller dessus, etc.)

Pour moi, un des meilleurs moyens d'apprendre ""l'informatique"" en g√©n√©ral, c'est de tra√Æner sur des sites/forums lire les probl√®mes, les solutions propos√©es, la d√©marche de d√©pannage etc. (site genre comment√ßamarche par exemple). 

Ensuite, il faut aussi mettre les mains dans le cambouis, sinon on apprends pas. Un probl√®me ? Au lieu d'appeler le pote qui bosse dans l'info ou le grand fr√®re, chercher sur le net et tester les solutions, le faire soit m√™me.     
La 1√®re fois, tu va mettre 2 jours √† trouver la solution, mais la prochaine fois, tu mettras 5 minutes. Et a force, tout se regroupe et tu peux utiliser tes nouvelles connaissances et les mettre en place.

La prog, c'est un monde compl√®tement diff√©rent, √ßa n'as strictement rien √† voir, et en plus, √ßa plait pas a tout le monde. Perso, j'ai commenc√© mes √©tudes de dev et √ßa m'a gav√©, je suis au final tech/sysadmin et je trouve √ßa beaucoup plus int√©ressant.

Bref, tout √ßa pour dire, si a un moment, le dev te saoule, c'est clairement pas n√©cessaire pour se ""d√©brouiller en informatique"".

At that time I didn't really like Salo, but I decided to give it a try. Being basically an oil, it is insanely high on calories and quite lightweight. After it being salted, it will not go bad for weeks, so I took about 2 kilos of it with me, having it cut in to smaller pieces.

This

&gt; The problem with creating a super powerful federal government is that **they'd be able to bully smaller branches of government** into supporting legislation that would benefit those at the top of the pyramid (and sitting in seats of power in the federal gov't). Too much power concentrated at the top and you'd end up with an oligarchy like Russia's, or (dare I say it) 'murica's.

And

&gt;I really don't see how this would work in the Eurozone at this time. After the monetary union strengthens a bit, they can start taking steps to integrate politically. But it's going to be a gradual process...

Hence the whole vertical integration vs. horizontal integration, supranationalism v.s. intergovermentalism and issues of sovereignty thing. An we're not just talking about the Eurozone ;) Which complicates it more. 

An I would almost be one to argue that the reason for the European Union's present identity crisis right now is because it *has been* gradual. There hasn't been no serious push in any one direction, no consensus on *what exactly* the European Union is actually supposed to be and as a result a confused rush in both directions *(Eurozone vs Greater European Union)*. 

I would also almost be one to fear that if the European Union keeps trying to run full-speed in two separate directions it's going to tear itself in two, or worse, collapse into itself and condemn Europe to another century *(or a couple)* of being divided and heavily influenced by the world's Great Powers, with no significant voice of it's own on the international scene.

T., c'est une fille que j'ai d'abord trouv√©e sur OKCupid, mais on discutait surtout sur GChat puisqu'elle avait la f√¢cheuse habitude de supprimer ses comptes sur OKC et d'en cr√©er de nouveaux (remarque, elle faisait pareil avec ses adresses gmail, mais elle me recontactait avec la nouvelle et en voiture Simone). Je lui ai √©crit √† la base parce qu'elle avait un style d'√©criture incroyable que je n'avais jamais vu avant, un m√©lange de profonde m√©lancolie, de d√©sespoir, mais aussi d'agressivit√©, de col√®re et de fantaisie. Une personne tr√®s malheureuse, avec un pass√© de troubles alimentaires et d'automutilation, 26 ans (maintenant √ßa doit √™tre 28), pas de boulot, pas de dipl√¥mes, pas d'amis, une m√®re religieuse hyst√©rique et un p√®re parti on ne sait o√π... mais tout √ßa je l'ai d√©couvert petit √† petit, parce qu'on ne parlait que de choses tr√®s banales comme ses derni√®res exp√©riences culinaires, les annonces qu'elle mettait sur Craigslist dans la section ""rants and raves"", une nouvelle qu'elle essayait d'√©crire, et ses d√©boires avec les mecs tout aussi tortur√©s qu'elle avec qui elle √©changeait des messages compliqu√©s et entretenait des relations √† distance bizarres sur OKCupid. Il se passait pas grand-chose dans la vie de T.

Une fois, elle m'a maladroitement remerci√© d'√™tre l√† pour √©couter ses conneries. Puis le lendemain elle s'est excus√©e genre ""euh ouais hier c'√©tait un peu chelou, d√©sol√©e"". Mais je crois qu'√† force de ne jamais aborder de front des sujets graves ou s√©rieux, ni de rentrer dans ses trips d'artiste maudite, j'√©tais un de ses rares points d'ancrage dans le monde r√©el. (Vous avez jamais eu des amis ch√¥meurs c√©libataires qui, √† force de ne jamais parler √† personne, partaient un peu dans des trips bizarres √† se prendre la t√™te tout seuls ? Moi oui.) Puis mes voyages m'ont fait passer quelques semaines dans son coin du monde (Brooklyn), je lui ai propos√© qu'on aille boire un coup mais √ßa avait l'air de pas la tenter plus que √ßa, et j'ai pas insist√©.

Puis quelques mois plus tard, vers l'automne 2013, elle a supprim√© son adresse gmail pour la √©ni√®me fois, mais cette fois sans me recontacter avec une nouvelle adresse. J'avais pas son num√©ro de t√©l√©phone, ni son nom de famille, ni rien d'autre qui m'aurait permis de la contacter. Apr√®s plusieurs mois j'ai mis une annonce (""h√© T., t'es toujours vivante ?"") dans la section ""missed connections"" de Craigslist Brooklyn, que je savais qu'elle lisait r√©guli√®rement, sans succ√®s. Quand une personne qui parle tout le temps de la mort et du fait que le monde est pourri disparait, c'est normal de s'inqui√©ter, non ?

No, what I mean is that, I dislike the opinion of many British people that they don't need to get involved. I don't necessarily dislike UKIP or the whole opinion of leaving the EU, what I hate about them is that they only seem to talk about getting the UK out. Of course focus on their main goal: Getting the UK out of the EU, but besides that they should actively do sensible stuff. For example not trying to block any notion in the EP simply because you don't like the EU.

I think Cameron was mostly ridiculed here because Juncker was obviously a favourite here.

First of all, I highly recommend learning enough Spanish to order food. Don't bother with the ""Could I please have.."" etc., because the Spanish aren't so formal here. If you just say ""El bocadillo con pollo, por favor"" (The chicken sandwich please) that is all they need :) That being said, many employees speak English as well, but it's a good feeling when you can get through even a small transaction in just Spanish!

I don't know if you like to go out, but you may want to check out Placa Reial for nightlife (or daytime too) as it is, most likely, pretty close to you. You have Jamboree, a fun and cheaper club that is dominated by tourists. The place next door has half hour flamenco shows too if you're interested in seeing one. But in general, this plaza has a lot of restaurants and bars and is probably walking distance for you.

My favorite place of course is el Born which you are probably also close to :) In some parts, Born can be quite touristy, but there are other better hidden areas as well. Whenever I want a cheaper but full meal, I like to walk by the Basilica of Santa Maria del Mar. There is everything there and it doesn't get quite as oversaturated as other parts of Barcelona. I also have a lot of fun going out in Born and often I will just ""bar crawl"" through it when a friend and it's been a great and stress-free way to try different places and see the area on a night out.

Ok, arts: I have not been to the Picasso Museum yet but it is also close to you and always has a line so it must be good. I think it is free either Saturday or Sunday after 3, I forget, but I trust you have the ability to find out using the internet haha. The National Museum of Art is also awesome and I think a little underrated. I went there when it was free too (I also forget - maybe Saturday after 3? Look it up) and I was very impressed! This museum is located a Montjuic (Placa Espanya) and most people go there to get some awesome views of the city without going inside the museum. However, the museum is very beautiful on the inside, and what is awesome about it is that there is art from every period of time that is endemic to Catalan... so you would never see it anywhere else. Sometimes I think that is cooler than going to a national museum that just tries to show you everything :) You could also make a trip to go see the Salvador Dali museum on Costa Brava. I have not been there but I have friends who have gone and it seems great. You can take the train there - a little more internet research for you haha.

Food &amp; Wine - everything is good, definitely enjoy the tapas experience, but if you are health conscious like me you should be forewarned not to overload in carbs!! Unless you don't care :) I cook for myself more than anything here, so I don't know so much about eating out. It is easy to spend an hour walking around starving and cranky looking for somewhere ""cheap."" The truth is that there are not too many hole-in-the-wall places with super cheap food here that are too obvious. Of course someone who has been here longer than me will have better suggestions than this! But my advice is, treat yourselves to some good meals as the food is good and unique. If you want a cheap meal, there are tons and tons of bakeries to grab a sandwich, quiche, whatever at.

Wine is a staple it seems in Europe in general, but here the Spanish have their ""cava"" so you should definitely try it. I don't know anything about wine tastings or what have you, but there is definitely not a limited supply of love for wine here.

Beaches - Barceloneta sucks, really. It's hardly a real beach. I recommend going to see it, and it's nice to walk to it some days and hang out, but if you want an actual day at the beach I recommend traveling the coast. You could go to Costeldelfels - it's a 30 minute train ride and in Zone 1 of the city (so you don't have to buy new metro tickets). Definitely still some tourists there, but the sand is nicer, the water is cleaner, and the beach is waaaay bigger. During the weekdays there aren't too many people. You could also go to a beach on Costa Brava, which are very beautiful, to add on to your internet research :)

Okay sorry I wrote so much but work is slow and this is fresh in my mind now! You can reply/PM me if you want more advice since I'm kind of familiar with your area from a tourist perspective :) have a good trip!",0,1406539447,null,0,false,0,cj9vnvm,t3_2bxed2,t1_cj9vnvm,t3_2bxed2,null,1434936917,1,false,Barcelona,t5_2qosg,1

That being said, Russia is clearly seeing how far it can go before they get called back.

They're doing quite well in profits, while the price for a cubic meter of water went up more than 10 times (in lei) since the privatization (around 7 times if converted in euros), far higher than the cumulative inflation which only doubled the prices in lei. They failed to make the investments they promised in their privatization contracts, but no politician cares as long as they get their bribes.

By the end of 2010, they were supposed to have water supply and sewerage to all outskirts of Bucharest, but even today there are areas of Bucharest without access to clean water and sewerage. So the city hall is now doing the investment on their own.

Now, when you are setting up a new connection, you will be presented with a choice to install the filter or not.

Mathematik and Geographie aren't loanwords/Denglisch though, I would assume they have a Latin background. 

In terms of use it always depends in what context and to whom you're speaking to.
You will not alienate people using 'Feier' instead of 'Party', but if you speak of things like 'workload' in German, I would say there are more elegant ways.

You seem quite confident and that's what's most important. Decide for yourself whether a new word enters your Wortschatz or Vokabular.

That was the big ""lucky moment"" for Europe.

In the centuries after that, parts of Europe developed very high levels of Social Capital (i.e. Trust between random individuals within a society). That means, people were able to cooperate much better than before. And that makes everything much more efficient (if you have ever lived in a country with low Social Capital, you will know what I mean).

That let to the era of Enlightenment and caused that Reason became more important than Faith in Europe (the West is still the only place in the world where that is the case, mostly). With it came the era of scientific discovery, inventions, etc.

My suggestion is to think more about why you want to live in Europe, and research countries based on that, as the countries are not all the same. If you're looking for a high quality of life and economic development, Norway ranks first by many measures. But it's not a good choice if you, say, want to live in a major metropolis, in that case you might be better off in the UK or Germany.

Scandinavian countries have great (but expensive) public transportation, are very mindful of ecology and the environment, and are safe countries even by European standards. But they have a high cost of living, Norway in particular is very expensive, and the climate may be difficult for some.

UK and Germany enjoy the benefits of being the largest economies, these are countries with several very big cities,  they get lots of major events, products, and so on. UK and Ireland are of course the only two countries in Europe where English is the primary language, making them the easiest in terms of cultural integration. At least in Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden, English is spoken by almost everyone and you can get by with just English, but that would still prevent you from being really integrated.

The university makes decisions based solely on what benefits the university. If there are negative consequences to this, then legislation on it will have to come from above (as the French do).

Offering courses in English means more foreign students. These people will be bringing investment to Munich, will likely embrace the German culture whilst there (as all foreign students do), and will either stay in Germany thereafter (benefitting Germany), or will go back home, taking with them established links to Munich and Germany.

--------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; You know, one of the many factors that added up to the second world war. Might want to try reading a history book.

What exactly *are you saying* then? Because it looks like you're comparing the United States' relationship with Europe to Nazi Germany's relationship with Europe and telling me I should read a history book to see the similarities. 

I mean...SERIOUSLY....what are you saying? Is the coming EU-American War imminent? WTF is your implication comparing the times to 1930s Europe and saying Nazi Germany &amp; the United States share similarities in that regard?

&gt;Schr√∂der didn't order carpet bombing of civilians. End of story.

*First off:* I wasn't comparing Schr√∂der to Bush, but I was saying you can't sweep Schr√∂der under the rug than bitch about Bush....which....is exactly what you just did. lol

*Second off:* I'm not sure if I agree with the Iraq War *(though I definitely disagree with the bullshit WMD reason we invaded for)*, but I'm damned sure I don't agree with the way we carried out the occupation.

That said, Bush didn't order us to carpet bomb civilians. If you believe that, you're stupid. I mean, than again, you're probably right. I'm sure there weren't entire dug-in armored divisions and military bases that were being targetted. 

I mean...could you imagine that....bombing entrenched armored divisions and fortified military bases during a war......that's insane....clearly the intention was to kill as many civilians as possible.

Also, how are all those arms sales going? You know....with Germany being one of the largest arms exporters in the known world? Like you said....a very pacifist country if we ignore your military-industrial complex.......

**EDIT:** Also, the imagery and emotions you're trying to elicit with the term *""carpet bombing""* is so fucking disingenuous. You'll probably never get rid of collateral damage, but the strategic bombing campaign in Iraq was so much more precise than past wars, leading to significantly fewer civilian casualties when compared with previous bombing campaigns.",0,1406543151,null,0,1406544270,0,cj9wcb4,t3_2bvc2a,t1_cj9wcb4,t1_cj9w5es,null,1434937274,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

&gt;__Bolognese sauce__, known in Italian as ___rag√π alla bolognese___, is a meat-based [sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce#Italian_cuisine) originating from [Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna), Italy. In [Italian cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_cuisine), it is customarily used to dress ""*[tagliatelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagliatelle) al [rag√π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rag%C3%B9)*"" and to prepare ""*[lasagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasagne) alla bolognese*"". In the absence of tagliatelle, it can also be used with other broad, flat pasta shapes, such as [pappardelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappardelle) or [fettuccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fettuccine), or with short tube shapes, such as [rigatoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigatoni) or [penne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penne). Genuine *rag√π alla bolognese* is a slowly cooked sauce, and its preparation involves several techniques, including [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating_(cooking\)), [saut√©ing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saut%C3%A9ing) and [braising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braising). Ingredients include a characteristic [soffritto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soffritto) of onion, celery and carrot, different types of minced or finely chopped meat (generally bovine, including [beef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef), and possibly [pork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork), such as [pancetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancetta)), wine and a small amount of [tomato concentrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato_paste).

La maggior parte dei ristoranti 'thailandesi' in Italia sono in realt√† cinesi, e loro fanno i piatti di merda, o sono troppo lontani degli ingredienti autentici e freschi.

Secondo me, il cibo thailandese √® incredibile, a causa degli ingrediente molto fresce, il gusto molto complesso, ma sopratutto una filosofia della cucina molto venerabile: in ogni piatto, deve essere un equilibrio tra salate, dolce, acido, piccante. Quando si aumento uno, sempre si deve regulare tutti gli altri.

I gusti fondazione piu importante: il latte di cocco (dolce), la citronella (acido), gli scalogni (dolce), la salsa di pesce (salato), le foglie di 'kaffir lime' (acido), i peperoncini (piccante), lo zucchero di palma (dolce). E naturalmente il riso (neutrale) e molti frutti.

I piatti notabile a provare inizialmente per noi occidentali (perch√© i peperoncini autentici thailandesi sono troppo troppo troppo piccantISSIMI) sono: 'pad thai' - i spaghetti buonissimi thailandesi di molte cose, le verdure, i gamberetti, gli arachidi, ecc., 'gaeng phanaeng' (curry di Penang) - dolce, non piccante, di solito servito al pollo o manzo; 'gaeng massaman' (curry dei i musulmani) - un sapore ricco del carne e delle patate; 'som tam' (insalata di papaia) - piccante, i gusti intensa, delle verdure crudi; e finalmente 'khao niaow ma muang' (il riso glutinoso col mango), dolce e salato, preparato del latte di cocco - il pi√π delizioso dolce della mia vita.",0,1406544563,null,0,false,0,cj9wm14,t3_2bvofa,t1_cj9wm14,t1_cj9qtxl,null,1434937415,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

Alors c'est quoi le cas? Tu veux me dire qu'il n'y rien de contradictoire que tu puisse offrir une g√©n√©ralit√© plut√¥t n√©gative de que pensent les fran√ßais des am√©ricains et qu'en m√™me temps, je vois toutes les raisons au contraire?
J'ai pas besoin de connaitre le gars avec son drapeaux am√©ricain d√©bardeur, rien que le voir prouve ce que je suis en train de dire. Qu'est-ce que √ßa changerai si je connaissais chaque fanatique d‚ÄôAm√©rique? Quelle bonne raison il peut y avoir? Tu esp√©rait qu'ils diraient tous ""Je suis un hipster, c'est ironique""...

&gt;Porter un drapeau am√©ricain ca a pas de connotation patriotique en france donc cette phrase a pas de valeur.

Bien sur que √ßa n'a pas une connotation patriotique! Vous √™tes pas am√©ricains! Vous n'√™tes pas de la *patrie* et comme vous n'√™tes pas am√©ricains, vous √™tes donc que des fans, qui fanstasment, ou qui admirent derri√®re les jugements, comme tu veux. C'est vraiment malhonn√™te de ta part de m√©priser cet argument avec un contre-argument qui n'a rien √† voir. Le drapeau am√©ricain a une connotation....am√©ricaine! En Am√©rique on aime *notre* drapeaux, en France, vous aimez *notre* drapeau, si nous avons fait pire que vous dans le monde, pourquoi porter ce drapeau? Les Fran√ßais croient alors que si les Am√©ricains font de la merde, c'est pas grave, on va quand m√™me porter leur drapeau, mais si les fran√ßais font de la merde, il faut pas s'associer avec l'image. Est-ce qu'il y une bonne raison pour cela que j'ignore? 

Pardon, je devais dire que *vous* n'aimez pas notre culture, mais vous regardez nos films √† la con? Encore une fois, pourquoi vous regardez nos s√©ries et films si nous sommes ignorants et si nous n'avons pas de culture? Quel est le l'int√©r√™t de regarder des films √† la con?

Oui, et ca circlejerk, d'accord. c'est un peu un r√©sultat in√©vitable quand on met des centaines de personnes avec des opinions similaires sur un m√™me sujet. Si vous aviez un plateform pareil en Fran√ßais, √ßa ferait la m√™me chose, vous n'√™tes pas l'abris des circlejerks. Votre sujet pr√©f√©r√© serait comment vous kiffez tous critiquer l'Am√©rique. Et le √©l√©phant rose dans la pi√®ce que tout le monde fait semblant de ne pas voir (comme on dit en anglais) serait la conversation qu'on est en train d'avoir. 

J'ai jamais dit que ""l'ignorance de *notre* population, de son manque de culture"" veulent dire la m√™me chose. Je vois deux raisons diff√©rentes justement pour laquelle vous ne devriez *pas* regarder/√©couter ce que nous font. 

&gt;Tu penses vraiment que des post qui v√©n√®re pas les etats unis sont bien re√ßus dans les subreddit du genre /r/worldnews /r/politic et autres ?

Je comprends pas cette phrase. Je pense qu'elle manque un mot, mais je pense que tu veux dire que le sentiment anti-am√©ricain ne se propage pas sur Reddit et que c'est √ßa le circle jerk? Si oui, je suis pas d'accord, il y a des opinions diff√©rentes et de la bonne discussion. 
Remarque toi, tu dois parler en anglais pour participer aux conversations les plus int√©ressantes sur Reddit, c'est tr√®s limit√© en fran√ßais, c'est vivre dans une bulle. Imagine si tu parlais que l'occitan...C'est pourquoi l'anglais est la langue √©trang√®re num√©ro 1 en Europe, c'est pour vous sortir de *votre* bulle. Au fait, j'ai connu plus de fran√ßais qui connaissent pas les 25 regions de la France que des am√©ricains qui connaissent pas les 50 etats et leurs emplacements sur la carte. Ah, et demande √† un fran√ßais qui c'√©tait ces nazi-chinois et il rigolera quand tu lui dis Japon. (C'est sens√© √™tre marrant parce que les fran√ßais consid√®rent que l'Asie *est* la Chine.) En tout cas, les r√©alisateurs d'un film estiment que cette blague ferait rire au publique fran√ßais. 

Tu m√©prises mes propos mais en m√™me temps, tu as envie d'avoir cette conversation, c'est un peu comme cette admiration pour l‚ÄôAm√©rique que ressentent les fran√ßais, mais ils sont trop fiers pour l'avouer, mais pas assez fiers pour arborer leurs propre drapeau...Tu n'as rien refut√©, tu affirmes simplement que vous ne fantasmez pas sur les USA. M√™me quand j'ai offert un autre mot √† la place, tu nie tout en bloc. Tu trouves que c'est tout √† fait normale que les gens qui critiquent quelque-chose dont ils ne peuvent pas se passer. 

Effectivement, on peut avoir un d√©bat si tu refuses de voir le grand √©l√©phant rose dans la pi√®ce.

When we have constantly incoming proof that Russia is the force behind the ""rebellion"" and that Russia is arming them and supplying them and now sending in columns with heavy weaponry??

You don't get the point about the flags? Ukraine Army carries big Ukraine flags so that they can see each others and don't mix up themselves with the rebels. The rebels mainly don't carry any insignias or they are very variable like the Vostok battalion flag, the Novo Rossia ""South will Rise Again"" insignia etc. Ukraine Army shows clearly who they are and act like a real Army and not some bunch of drunk guerrillas. Sorry for that btw, it is mainly true and you know it.

So, if your message is ""Aww, I'm so confused... I don't know, people you should not know either!"" then why do you even bother to wrote posts like that?

It doesn't matter much if the language is unique to them or not, what matters is whether the culture is based on that language or not. Core concepts of many languages and associated cultures do not exist in other languages, thus it is not possible to adopt another language without abandoning or re-shaping linguistic and cultural concepts, which would lead to a loss of cultural diversity.

Consider this example. Suppose I say to you in English that ""I spent yesterday evening with a neighbor."" You may well wonder whether my companion was male or female, but I have the right to tell you politely that it's none of your business. But if we were speaking French or German, I wouldn't have the privilege to equivocate in this way, because I would be obliged by the grammar of language to choose between *voisin* or *voisine*; *Nachbar* or *Nachbarin*. These languages compel me to inform you about the sex of my companion whether or not I feel it is remotely your concern. This does not mean, of course, that English speakers are unable to understand the differences between evenings spent with male or female neighbors, but it does mean that they do not have to consider the sexes of neighbors, friends, teachers and a host of other persons each time they come up in a conversation, whereas speakers of some languages are obliged to do so.

On the other hand, English does oblige you to specify certain types of information that can be left to the context in other languages. If I want to tell you in English about a dinner with my neighbor, I may not have to mention the neighbor's sex, but I do have to tell you something about the timing of the event: I have to decide whether we dined, have been dining, are dining, will be dining and so on. Chinese, on the other hand, does not oblige its speakers to specify the exact time of the action in this way, because the same verb form can be used for past, present or future actions. Again, this does not mean that the Chinese are unable to understand the concept of time. But it does mean they are not obliged to think about timing whenever they describe an action.

When your language routinely obliges you to specify certain types of information, it forces you to be attentive to certain details in the world and to certain aspects of experience that speakers of other languages may not be required to think about all the time. And since such habits of speech are cultivated from the earliest age, it is only natural that they can settle into habits of mind that go beyond language itself, affecting your experiences, perceptions, associations, feelings, memories and orientation in the world.",0,1406548063,null,0,false,0,cj9xcxf,t3_2bv7yk,t1_cj9xcxf,t1_cj9ixaj,null,1434937722,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Water was exclusively state-owned until 1993 by √Åguas de Portugal, a State-owned company. The quirk of the law regarding water in Portugal is that it gave municipalities full control/responsibility over water. They just couldn't privatize it.

Then in 1993, the government (whose Prime Minister Cavaco Silva is now the current President of Portugal) passed a law that allowed municipalities to privatize water within the municipality area.

In 1995, the same government passed a law that allowed these private companies to demand subsidies from the State if previously established profits under contract weren't met. Private companies that are heavily subsidized by the State like this is common-practice in all areas of the economy in Portugal.

In 1997, the government ruled by Guterres (the current United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who is already eyeing the Presidency of Portugal) futher expanded on the law from 1993 making municipal privatizations an all-or-nothing deal, ie. municipalities either sold everything regarding water or nothing.

In 2002, one of the first measures of the government of Dur√£o Barroso (the current reptilian overlord of the euro-zeitgeist) started the technical studies that precede any law in Portugal for the privatization of √Åguas de Portugal as a whole. But nothing further was done, as Dur√£o Barroso soon received and followed his Call from Europe.

In 2009, Jos√© S√≥crates (sexiest Prime Minister alive according to magazines, and the worst person alive according to Portugal) further expanded on Guterres' law of 1997, in a sensible shout-out to his Socialist Party homie.

So as the law made it easier for private companies to make business across several municipalities, more companies started doing business. There are currently 32 private companies in 44 municipalities (some with full ownership of water, other with ownership of some services only). Portugal has a total of 308 municipalities so this is a significant number, especially when you realize 115 of these municipalities have less then 10k people living there, and that these companies operate only in populous municipalities, some of which are actually the most populous and most dense municipalities in the country, like Odivelas and Estoril.

Of course, prices have increased, service is poorer, the companies don't do what they promised under contract, the government pays their profits, etc.

Oh, and now they're after EU money, and the current government is on their side:

No I didn't, they are significant, but the effects they have had on Germany are exaggerated for media hype and to make nuclear out as evil.  Most of the problem is because when something goes wrong with nuclear it is sensationalized.   Everyone knows about Chernobyl but very people know about but very people know about Banqiao and Shimantan Dams failing killing 170,000 people,  the hundreds to thousands of coal miners that die a year, or the thousands that die every year because respirable coal ash causes premature death due to heart disease or lung disease.

Germany is stupid for giving up on perfectly good power source and your temporary use of more coal and gas will cause many lives that could have been saved, and increased global warming instead of staying with and improving upon the success you have had with nuclear.  You will also increase your dependence upon countries like Russia that are horrible human rights abusers during the many decades it will take you to replace nuclear.

true,G_Morgan,WALE,Wales,"The British tradition has always been that certain rights are held purely for existing. The idea of freeborn rights has been a concept in the UK forever. Nearly every major internal conflict in the UK has been over such rights. Whether we are talking about magna carta, the civil war or the glorious revolution.

Where law interacts with this is something else. Certainly laws and establishments of power can act contrary to inalienable rights. That doesn't alter the inalienability of the rights. Which is why parliament felt it had the power to raise an army to resist Charles I's attempt to tax without permission of parliament.

I mean take the concept of artificiality of rights to its natural conclusion. That means that murder is only bad because the law says so. That in a different country I could murder somebody and it would be fine because the law says so.

Murder comes back to self ownership. Irrevocable destruction of property is the ultimate power of ownership. Murder is the irrevocable destruction of the person. So on what grounds can you deny self ownership (under which murder is obviously wrong and should sanely be illegal)? The alternatives are mutual ownership of all society. In that case the one person cannot make such an ultimate call alone so murder is still obviously something that must be restricted. The other alternative is where some kind of upper class owns a lower class but there is no good basis on which to justify such a thing.

Given this it is blatantly obvious that murder should be illegal. There may be legal systems that disagree but nobody ever said the law has to be right. In fact most legal systems have built in the understanding that they are probably wrong and need to be adjusted.",0,1406551064,null,0,false,0,cj9y5br,t3_2bvpxz,t1_cj9y5br,t3_2bvpxz,null,1434938083,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

A flag, for me, is like a suit. Used in celebratory events and should be treated as something precious.

Volume 2 for those interested.

While I would recommend reading this, as it is one of the most comprehensive primary sources related to the Spanish campaign through Mexico and the defeat of the Aztecs, there are a couple of things to take into account while reading it.

For a start, take into account the biases he would have while writing it, for example he quite clearly wanted to play up the glories of the Spanish (Especially his own), so he tends to ignore the work that the Native allies of the Spanish did, making it seem like the Spanish did all of the fighting. He also downplays a lot of the atrocities committed by the Spanish, while playing up a lot of those committed by the Aztecs.

A lot of his accounts are also contradicted by other accounts from the time, such as Native accounts, for example Diaz claimed that the Spanish did not commit atrocities in the pursuit of gold, however native accounts describe the Spanish torturing, and killing natives to get gold. I don't know if everything he omitted was intentional (to make the Spanish, and himself seem like heroes) or unintentional (he was writing many years after his has taken part in the conquest, so a lot of things he could have forgotten, or remembered incorrectly, he even states something along the lines of how he could have forgotten to mention things)
 
No matter this, his description of life in Tenochtitlan is very important, and some of the most important we have, so it's still worth a read, even if he exaggerates a lot. This is why I'd recommend reading another, more modern book alongside it, the one most people (and me) would usually recommend is Matthew Restalls Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest

A group formed that wanted to press the Berlin government to reveal all secret contracts and their clauses and to buy those 49.9% of the shares back.

*Citizens* saw it didn't work to their advantage and the government said it couldn't reverse the thing because of the contracts they made and they would have to pay compensation for lost profits. Which sparked the discussion what kind of profit compensation that would be because water is a public good that was supposed to be provided regardless of profit.

Then there was a movement that basically did what it could to make the land do those things. It appears the whole thing was succesful but the draft that was supposed to become law that would declare everything that's against it illegal would be against the constitution which says that contracts can't become illegal retroactively.

instead of writing you some boring card, I've picked up this composition book. Let me start off by explaining the purpose and reason for this book. Every time I'm with you, something I'd like to tell, show or give to you comes to my mind, and whenever I leave, I always have to come up with new hiding places for these little notes so you don't continually find them [before I leave or before I can execute my plans]. It is exactly these little situations I drew the inspiration of this book from. From now on, whenever I'm with you and you're busy, for example when you're spending hours on the toilet again, I can grab this book and write, draw or glue something in it. 
And if I should have a photo for you, it can also find a place in here, as I deem real pictures 1000 times better than digital data packets that you **have to view** on your small **screen.**""

I definitely think that water resources should be owned by the state. A private company could deliver the water from the source to the people and I'd be fine with it (By this I mean extraction and cleaning). However there'd have to be strict rules and regulations to ensure that it's safe. Preferably it'd be run by the local government. 


Water should be owned by the state because it's extremely vital, and I feel like private companies wouldn't compete, they'd exploit the local population instead if they could do whatever they wanted.

true,Yence_,BELG,Belgium,"Belgium: more or less the same as in the Netherlands. A large portion comes out of the Albert Canal and is then treated until it is drinkable. Otherwise it will be pumped up from the soil. The treatment is very extensive: all water is drinkable but in some areas (especially rural areas) the water can be quite hard and most people in those areas who can afford it have a water softener installed in their home. This in my opinion makes the water even better in taste too - although where I live it is not really needed.

Organisation: everything is state-owned, but there are multiple water companies. There is in Flanders the VMW, which is the company that is above the ""intercommunales"" (water companies run by a group of communities). In recent years, a lot of these companies have merged. There are now about 10 companies under the VMW for Flanders.

Almost all sewage water is treated before it is returned into a river. Belgium has been running behind on these regulations in the 1980-1990's, but has significantly improved and now exceeds the European regulations by far. A lot of rivers that have been almost completely dead because of pollution for the last few decades, are recovering very well.

As far as I know, water prices have gone up significantly in the past 10 years. Now it's about ‚Ç¨3/m^3, treatment fees included.

A small quantity of water is provided for free, based on the number of people that live on anaddress. The same goes for electricity by the way - even though that has been privatized now.

There are also similar structures for Brussels and Wallonia, but I'm not familiar with that. I can say for sure however that the water there is of equal quality, price and taste.

I never heard anyone speak about privatization of the water supply, and anyone who would dare make such a statement would be laughed at.

Its quite notable in my experience that southern europe seems to get a lot more stick (A friend actually got attacked for speaking Greek with friends). Granted i speak good enough german that Its probably not obvious (for a few seconds at least). But whenever I read anti-immigration publications in german its always talking about ""Italians and Spanish"" etc and never ""Oh bloody Swedes and British people"" (they just hate the stag parties :p).

&gt;  In day-to-day business, however, German remains essential here,

This kind of person is who people get angry at (in any country where Immigration is an issue I think). Especially the surprise that the culture is different and then to not speak the language (or even the widely spoken English).

[I'll be damned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_John_Boyce)  
  
&gt; Boyce claims that he began getting misrouted cables from the Central Intelligence Agency discussing the CIA's desire to depose the government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in Australia. Boyce claimed the CIA wanted Whitlam removed from office because he wanted to close U.S. military bases in Australia, including the vital Pine Gap secure communications facility, and withdraw Australian troops from Vietnam. For these reasons some claim that U.S. government pressure was a major factor in the dismissal of Whitlam as prime minister by the governor general, Sir John Kerr, who according to Boyce, was referred to as our man Kerr by CIA officers.  
  
  
  
I still had it in the back of my mind because of [this recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQAqgUKgrkQ&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player) with Boyce.  
I actually wanted to write about how the constant speculation regarding Murdoch's motivation takes away from an otherwise informative article. I wanted to write about how the organigram of Murdoch's empire was well outlined for the layman by describing how he acquires power in a new market. Stools are not the only things that stand stable on three legs. And then this. I didn't have the slightetst idea that this connection existed.  
  
Has anybody encountered similar connections between Murdoch's work and intelligence operations?

I am not a professional but just an enthusiast of Internet and freedom of speech here in Spain, but by no means an authority or an expert. While this article sounds a bit extreme, is not far from what I understand.

An 'Spanish Site' is understood as the company/owner of the site is resident in spain and therefore pays spanish taxes. 

**Context**

Spanish congress has passed a 'project of regulation' that will probably see the light at the end of the year, right now is a proposal that has been pushed by the party in power, the conservative right wing, PP, and the opposition of the rest. Still, it has been accepted in congress and is moving on to next stage, the senate's approval, somewhere around november.

It's known as the 'Canon AEDE' or 'Tasa Google', and it's theoretically designed to protect news sources from being 'duplicated' or 'cited' on content  aggregators such as google news, feedly, flipboard, meneame, or any other automatic/community generated aggregator. Google news is being the major target, and social networks like twitter and/or facebook are excluded on this law, as 'social networks are not included in this law, as that would be limiting users, and not companies' ?? ).

The argument is that this type of websites are stealing traffic and ad-impressions, avoiding visitors to go to the source, creating a dashboard that saves users the visit.


**How will it work**

Seems any &lt;automatic/community powered&gt; content aggregator will have to pay per link to source a fixed amount to **[CEDRO](http://www.cedro.org/nosotros/propiedad-intelectual)**, a non-lucrative association, recognized by the government as such, that will then share the benefits to all the companies that are affiliated with them, in compensation for the looses that the link caused.

If someone is not obeying the law, the website can be closed right away without a proper legal process, since the ones who decide are a 'special commision' designated by the state who will have the power to decide who goes down and why. No case, no court, no lawyer, nothing. This guys that THEY HAVE CHOSEN will decide. '**[Comisi√≥n Sinde](http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/02/11/navegante/1360581254.html)**'.

Linked sources (such as big newspapers) cannot reject the contribution, even if they state so. 


**Why does make little sense**

While certain tech authorities (as Ricardo Galli, from meneame.net) have confirmed that this law **[will probably backfire](http://blog.meneame.net/2014/02/16/posicionamiento-de-meneame-sobre-la-tasa-a-agregadores-de-la-nueva-ley-de-propiedad-intelectual/)**, government has passed the law anyway on a rather fast and precipitated session.

The president of the AEDE (the association of editors of spanish newspapers) has stated that ""content aggregators risk the access of citizens to free and quality information in the internet"". Yup. literally. No joke. 

Google news provides a wide amount of tools to not being included in their 'dashboard'. But this is not what they want. What they want is the same traffic, but with an economic compensation.


**Personal perception**

I have the idea (can't prove this or collect links for this, as is a personal perception) that the political party PP is obeying what huge press groups (that belong to even bigger power entities that finance ) are demanding to either protect themselves from new age of information (what americans can probably recognize as it happens as well in their country). 

All in all, I am ashamed of our politicians, specially, the little understanding of what Internet is and how it works.

The secret of Dutch tapwater unveiled in new textbook

The public drinking water supply in the Netherlands is one of the best in the world. For this reason there is a lot of international interest in the Dutch 'miracle from the tap'. The recently published textbook 'Drinking Water ‚Äì Principles and Practices' unveils the secret of this Dutch miracle.

In the Netherlands we take it for granted that our drinking water is safe and tastes well. But in most countries, tap water is used to flush the toilet only, and not for drinking. Bottled water or in- house filters for purifying tap water are used instead. Even though the use of bottled water and in-house filters is expensive and not environmentally-friendly, people often choose this practice because of the mediocre quality of the tap water and the taste of chlorine.

The Dutch government and drinking water authorities have always made public health their first priority. This has led to the ground-breaking innovation, namely high quality drinking water that is soft, has a good taste, and is distributed without chlorine. The Dutch drinking water supply also distinguishes itself in other respects: it has the lowest leakage in the world and is supplied at all times with a very high reliability. The principles and practices of the Dutch drinking water supply which have led the Dutch to actually drink tap water and not use filters or bottled water are presented in the textbook. The need for an English publication stems from the international interest in the unique Dutch approach and the desire to follow the Dutch example.

The Iraq war in the USA was a divisive issue too, but not on the scale it was in the UK.

For the first, trial class, you just show up.

Then, if you like it and want to continue you must signup to the club and the federation.

In my club you'd pay 150 eur for the 3 months (tarif trimestriel).

You also need to get the annual license from FFJDA for 35 eur. (Club handles this for you)

Finally you need to see a doctor (21 eur I guess but you may get free with your school) and ask him to sign this document http://www.judofranceparis.fr/JUDOFRANCEPARIS/Telechargements_files/CERTIFICAT%20ME%CC%81DICAL%2014-15.pdf

true,SnorriSturluson,piemonte,,"&gt;Like I have explained American lawsuits to people in the past, is there a structural or cultural reason that strikes/protests/work stoppage are used so often in Italy? Do they usually achieve the objective?

My best guess is that because they did work in the past and so we have retained that kind of culture, even though it's sometimes perceived as old-fashioned; yet, these days, they are seen even more necessary when facing the new mantra of ""work flexibility"" without the warranties that should come with it. 

Some will likely say that strikes are the only way that can justify the existence of unions.

&gt;Are people as picky about ""good food"" as our stereotype? I receive emails from Giallo Zafferano and it looks like Italian mothers take such extreme care and effort with their children's food.

Yes, of course with modern life we don't have as many housewives spending hours in the kitchen, but food is still considered a very important element of one's life and worthy of attention and care. This doesn't mean that I haven't seen people eating anything short of manure.

&gt;Are younger generations moving away from traditional foods? Or organ meats such as tripe? Or are they still eating many of the same popular regional foods as their parents? (This is happening with my family in Mexico City, younger kids are eating a lot of hamburgers, pizza, and french fries and saying ""eww"" to traditional organ meats, roasted animal heads, etc.)

For what I can see, they are: I don't know why, probably the taboo stems from the stronger taste that most some traditional foods and offal have or the fact that they were poor people's food. Also, ""global"" food is easier to produce and distribute, while more traditional dishes require rarer ingredients.

&gt;What do you all think about people who are ""proud to be Italian!!!"" but are 1/4 Italian and living in the U.S.?

Usually we are indifferent, as long as they don't try and impose their ""italianness"" on us, demanding to be considered the epitome of Italy and they remember that what they have been taught is probably a watered-down culture from decades ago.",0,1406557419,null,0,1406557693,0,cja0dmd,t3_2bxinn,t1_cja0dmd,t1_cj9zz63,null,1434939151,8,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,8

Privatising a monopoly is a bad idea. 

And it gets worse: Water is a necessity - as customer, you can't substitute the product (= ""water coming out of a pipe in the wall"") easily.

(Main problem with monopolies: A monopolist has no incentive to fullfill the whole demand in a market - supply in a competitive market is almost always higher and cheaper -- see cournot competition model)

edit: Living in the south of Germany, I enjoy fabulous water quality. Haven't seen any privately owned suppliers - I only know publicly owned water companies, aside from bottled water.

A state-run monopoly is not good - but it is always better than a privately-run monopoly: Politicians need at least some form of voter's support, while a company owning a monopoly can and will ignore its (potential) customers.

Most of the Euro-members that have economic problems have those because of matters unrelated to the Euro (Greece cooked the books, Spain had a huge real estate bubble, Italy's economy hasn't grown since the '80s, etc.), and if anything, their problems are massively mitigated by the Euro (imagine Greece, Spain, Portugal etc. having to face this crisis on their own).

In most member states the Euro has had only positive effects, however.

At any rate, it's becoming a bit old hat to judge the performance of a currency by bad economic policies of certain member states. That'd be like saying the Dollar is responsible for what happened to Detroit.

true,generalche,null,null,"Ok, I'd written the below post before really thinking about what you are asking. After re-reading it, I think you should consider a few things first. Firstly, I'm guessing your masters is at the Autonoma (UAB)? Do you have somewhere to live? Because if you are planning on living in Barcelona centre, then driving out to Sabadell for the UAB, you should definitely think again. Driving in Barna centre is not fun, and parking is a MAJOR expense. The train out to the UAB is really good, and a far better option than commuting by car. Seriously. If you are thinking of living further afield, then fine, a car is a good choice, but honestly, the train is there for a reason - use it! And seriously, living in Barcelona centre, you DON'T need a car. For anything.

Ok, on to the car buying advice!

I don't know where you are from originally, but when I (Brit) was buying a car a few years ago in Catalonia, the first thing I noticed is that the idea of a ""nice, cheap, good quality"" 2nd hand car just doesn't seem to exist. The prices for 2nd had cars in Spain, IMHO, are crazy when compared to the UK. Even something that's 10 years old with 300,000 km will be spectacularly expensive.

After looking for a long time, and deciding that I didn't trust buying privately, we went for a 2nd hand Leon from a Seat dealership, but it certainly wasn't cheap. If you do want something cheap and semi-reliable (i.e. with a guarantee that if you drive it down the road and it breaks on the first corner, then you can take it back and they'll fix it) then I think the best option is the standard advice - off brand 2nd hands from a brand dealership. Often, brand dealerships will take off-brand cars in part exchanges, which they will then want to get rid of, so the prices can be much better than on brand stuff. It's worth shopping around for sure.

Oh, the other thing that surprised me about motoring in Spain: insurance. Also way more expensive than in the UK, and be super careful - they auto renew all policies every year, unless you inform them by fax that you don't want them to do it. When they auto renew, they charge whatever price they want. Complete bastards. You only have to get burnt once, and you never do it again...

Do you think that's because of the Euro? Or do you think that's *despite* of the Euro? Don't you think it'd be a heck of a lot worse in Spain, Greece, etc. if they didn't have the Euro? 

Also, the unemployment rate of a lot of the member states of the Euro is still quite good (Germany, Austria, Belgium, The Netherlands, etc.), so why didn't the Euro lead to more unemployment there, then?

Also, if you look at big Euro countries that have a slightly higher unemployment rate, like France and Italy, you'd see that the unemployment rate they have now is historically similar to what they've always had:

* [France](http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=fr&amp;v=74) 

* [Italy (unemployment even went down quite a bit since 1999)](http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=it&amp;v=74)


Do you think unemployment would go up in, say, Sweden or the Czech republic if the Euro were introduced? Or do you think unemployment would stay relatively the same or decrease, as it's done in all of the 'solid' Eurozone countries, while the GDP and import/export-balance improves because of the benefits of the Euro? (Not to mention the practical benefits of a common currency for average citizens.)

In other words, correlation doesn't imply causation.

It would be more expensive, since its a not really renewable and extremely important reasourse, it being more expensive would stop people from wasting it so much. 

I think that is a good thing in the long term, because if we keep it like now then it will gradually be harder and harder to supply the metro areas with clean water in Europe. So by making it expensive now we can invest the gotten money in ways and means to build up a system that is renewable and efficient in the long term time frame. 

But then again, you cant trust a private company the same way you cant trust a corrupt state, so maybe the water systems should we owned by the lowest level of government, we should only make the water more expensive to cut down on the waste, and the extra money gotten should be invested by the state in a long planed water infrastructure project etc. 

There would be problems with how good the plan is, how do we deal with poor people not having money for basic water, the companys moving out because of the water costs etc. But still this is only the general direction of my thinking.

For the UK to so dramatically affect EZ growth (and I appreciate the 32% was sarcastic), it would need to be, by far, Europe's biggest economy. The point is the UK was able to use the BoE to heal one fully unified economy of 63 million people, instead of 17/18 vastly different and not fully unified economies, consisting of c.332 million people. Whereas the future looks bright in Germany and BeNeLux, in Greece and Spain life is still shitty (unemployment being atrocious).

&gt; (a lot of people have been pointing out that QE is leading to the same kind of bubble that caused the 2008 financial crisis).

I guess we wait and see. The problem is the alternative (i.e. the ECB method) hasn't brought the EZ fully out of crisis and it still looks a little precarious. If the Eurozone had recovered, just not as well, then I'd say its a fair criticism.

&gt; Are you happy sharing a currency with economic basket-cases in a system with little federal redistribution?

Personally, yes, I am. The economic connection between European countries is extremely strong, so we'd feel the repercussions of various crises of the ""economic basket-cases"", as you call them, either way. But due to the shared currency, those countries agreed to a set of rules. The EU can now force them to make smart decisions (or at least *smarter* decisions than they would make without outside pressure) to deal with the crisis which in turn lessens the repercussions the EU as a whole feels. I definitely think we're better off with the Euro than without it.

It's significantly worse than being state run, because in the process of writing the contracts, the state (who puts out the tender) has to basically predict everything about the management of that resource and bake it into the contract.

If they're capable of writing contracts that good, then they're more than capable of managing the resource (so why privatise?), and if the contracts aren't perfect, then there's nothing that can be done to fix them on the fly (particularly for 10, 20, 30+ year contracts). On the other hand, if it's state-run, and something unforseen comes up, then they'll just adapt and fix it.

We had a practical example of this where I live, where the train system was quasi-privatised (it's owned by the state, but run by a private company through long-term contracts)... The problem was, that one summer it got so hot that the air-conditioning on the trains broke down, and the private company said ""it's not in the contract, so it's not our problem."" then sued the government for the cost of fixing the equipment.

That's not true AT ALL ! I've always tried to defend Serbia and to point out that things weren't black and white. Things were grey throughout Yugoslavia. And even though I admit I usually get downvotes when I'm expressing my opinion regarding this issue, I was never the only one to defend Serbia. 


Also, you must understand that the winners are the ones who write history. They must antagonize and even demonize the entity they are fighting against in order to legitimize their actions. 

An unfortunate consequence of demonizing a country for their mistakes and not taking into account their own suffering and the crimes committed against them is [Jingoism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingoism). This form of nationalism is caused by the frustration and the anger felt by the citizens of the respective country. I, personally, can empathize with that frustration, but there are people who cannot. And to be fair, most Serbs are nationalistic and feel they have been punished even though they suffered as well. Serbs need to forget about the wrongdoings against them and accept the history the winners wrote for them if they want people to accept them. Basically, do what the Germans did even if you don't think it's fair. It is the only way, in my opinion.

&gt;Fracking pumps trillions of gallons of toxic chemicals deep underground. 

First of all fracking doesn't pump trillions of gallons of anything underground. It uses between 3-5 million gallons of water per frack. Anything over 20m3 of water (about 4000 gallons) needs a permit under the Water Resources Act 1991 (Royal Society Report, Pg 20, Section 2.2). To run a well for a decade would use about the same amount of water as running a golf course for a month. 

Toxic chemicals are not used in fracking. Certainly not trillions of gallons of them. Cuadrilla, the only company who have fracked on the UK mainland, have released their chemical usage [here](http://www.cuadrillaresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Chemical-Disclosure-PH-1.jpg). 

97.93 per cent of the fracking fluid is water, 2.023 per cent is sand, 0.043 per cent is a Polyacrylamide emulsion, and 0.000005 per cent is Sodium salt dissolved in a small amount of water. 

Polyacrylamide is non-toxic and is used in water treatment and agriculture (so you've more than likely consumed some today), sand is sand and sodium salt is just table salt. Literally nothing here is toxic.

HCl and a biocide can also be used if needed. HCl, whilst not toxic, can be hazardous. But it would also be used in literally thousands of m3 of water, diluting it massively. Biocides are toxic but they are already used in water treatment processes. I'd be more concerned about biocides leaking from power plant cooling loops into ground water than I would about them contaminating water supplies in fracking.  

The EA has to allow any other chemicals to be used by companies. Companies must disclose whatever they are using before they are allowed to frack.

The argument is moot though. The construction of the well ensures that any fracking fluid cannot escape into the environment (Royal Society Report, Pg 24, Section 3) . Once the fluid actually enters the target ground it cannot flow into aquifers which are hundreds of metres above and protected by impermeable rock (the same rock than enables the gas to stay locked underground for millions of years) (Royal Society Report, Pg 32, Section 4).

[Royal Society Report on Hydraulic Fracturing](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/shale-gas-extraction/2012-06-28-shale-gas.pdf)


&gt;toxic Water that can ignite. 

Water that can ignite is not necessarily toxic. It may be contaminated with methane but methane is not a toxic chemical nor will it be in great enough concentration to cause explosions. The ability to set well water on fire has been known for centuries, it is a natural phenomena and, as far as I know, has never been scientifically linked with fracking. 

&gt;Fracking does not do damage above ground

Actually it potentially does. The potential spillage of chemicals (which would be concentrated rather than diluted into huge amounts of water) is a problem. Fortunately it's an easily mitigated risk. Alongside proper health and safety protocols for handling of said chemicals under the top layer of soil an impermeable membrane can be laid down to ensure any chemicals that are spilt do not flow into potential water sources. It's the same technology as used in land fills to ensure leachate doesn't contaminate water supplies.

It might interest you to know I'm actually against fracking. I don't think we should be finding and using more fossil fuels to power our economy. It's not sustainable and is the long-term is going to destroy the planet. We should be focusing on nuclear power in the mid-term whilst switching to inevitably more mature and efficient renewable energy options whilst using biofuels to ensure a base-level of power generation. If we must frack we should use the gas to give us time to create a new-generation of nuclear plants to power the UK. 

I'm not against fracking because it's dangerous. It's not.

Traveling half way around the world takes a lot of money, and to have money you usually need a decent job, and people with decent jobs tend to be well educated and more politically mild. 

Europe's a lot closer to the middle east though, so it's easier for both radicals and the poor to move. In addition, because of the strength of the welfare state in most of Europe, the immigrants are viewed as being excessive drains on resources. So taking this interpretation, Muslims in Europe are more akin to our Mexicans. 

I'm not really sure how true that interpretation is though. Going from how things look online, there's *a lot* of unwarranted vitriol in Europe towards Muslims, which doesn't really have a great analogue in the US. Of course, the internet makes everything look terrible, so I have no idea what the reality is like.

Edit: Well, that's the line that gets fed by people who *aren't* crazy. I don't know if I buy it, but it's a stronger argument then all of the ""hurr durr religion of peace terrorists"" types which tend to pop up in these discussions. 

Edit 2, electric boogaloo: It should also be pointed out that Muslims only account for about 1% of the population in the US, which is lower than in many European countries.

The Latvian Prosecutor‚Äôs Office opened a criminal case against Antjufeev, but he fled to Russia. At the end of 1991, Antjufeev reappeared in Transnistria and took on the pseudonym Vadim Shevtsov. From 1992 to 2012, Shevtsov (Antjufeev) served as the head of the PMR‚Äôs KGB service and was one of the people closest to the ‚Äúpresident‚Äù of Transnistria, Igor Smirnov. In 2004, Antjufeev was included on the list of PMR leaders whom the European Union declared persona non-grata. In 2012, he moved to Moscow. In spring 2014, Antjufeev participated in Russia‚Äôs operation to annex Crimea (rusvesna.su, kommersant.md, July 10).

They generally achieve nothing, even if strikes of some categories able to do some impressive lobbying (cab drivers, for example) generally achieve what they were meant to.

Good food: we're generally speaking used to very good food. Most italian moms are able to pull off some quite impressive dishes, as a 'traditional' portion of our culture. This is true also fro women manager (such as my mother, who does not routinely cook, but can make some quite great stuff).

Traditional foods: something which is not immediately clear to most foreigner is that somebody like me (grown up in Milan) has a lifestyle which is quite different from that of italians grown in a small town in e.g. Sardinia; meaning there're deep differences in the day-to-day life of people about the same age grown in different places in Italy.
Generally (and in food too), little cities in peripheral regions are a more closed environments are thus more conservative.
I'm not used to organ meat (I do eat liver, but I would not go out of my way to get it), but that pretty much comes from the food I was used to during childhood (my mother's family is from southern Italy and her family would eat organ meat when she was a little girl, sometimes she gets it at restaurants, but my father was grossed by it and we never had it at home). Also, I very much enjoy 'ethnic' (chinese, sushi, indian and so forth) food. Some of my friends do too, some don't, my parents do no like it. It was something I've been experimenting with in late adolescence, not something my family is into.

No, there's a practical reason. Labor relations are strained, as the paradigm has shifted in the last decades from strong unions to strong employers and labor rights and conditions have comparatively worsened. Frequent strikes are a simple case of old tactics applied to a new environment in which they make little sense.

Yes. People tend to be very opinionated on food and most everyone fancies themselves a food expert, at least in their particular local or family traditions. Doesn't mean that people will be dicks about it though.

Yes, especially the 'yukiest' kinds. But a hell of a lot of traditional Italian food isn't strange at all and young people like as much as their parents I'd say.

Right, but who? Create an example.

* Does a former Yukos shareholder enlist the help of the Russian courts to seize Russian government property? Obviously not.

* Does a former Yukos shareholder enlist the help of a foreign court to seize Russian government property in that country (e.g. UK courts in the UK)? Again, no.

Building on the second of those examples, that would mean the UK courts sending people to the Russian Ambassadors Residence (if that is the asset in question) to seize it on behalf of said Yukos shareholder. Whether legally correct or not, that would cause a diplomatic incident. The Russian government would respond to that, blaming the state whose court system made this happen. Legally it works, practically it does not.

And consider the position of the Yukos shareholder. That person is not going to be welcome in Russia, for quite obvious reasons. If they are not already in a state of exile, they soon will be.

Yes, that's exactly what happens. UK courts can seize Russia's property in the UK. 

&gt; Building on the second of those examples, that would mean the UK courts sending people to the Russian Ambassadors Residence (if that is the asset in question) to seize it on behalf of said Yukos shareholder. 

An embassy is usually exterritorial. You can't seize shit in it because you have no jurisdiction about it.

What you can seize is for example an UK bank account of Gazprom. Or the London office building of another Russian state owned corporation.

You could also walk down to the harbour and seize Russian merchant fleet vessels.

&gt; Whether legally correct or not, that would cause a diplomatic incident. 

We're not in Russia. The political caste can not forbid you to exercise your rights without a legal court order. Do you think David Cameron could enter your Home and tell you not to watch your favorite sitcom today because he is the Prime Minister and you are his subjugate?

So its a conspiracy theory accusation? Its the EU, or individuals within it (presumably ordered by someone at the EU - much like spying from the NSA is ultimately ordered by someone) that you are accusing of influencing the outcome of international courts.

What does that make the EU? It is an institution that, under your accusation, illegally influence the outcome of international courts. I personally am pro-EU. If the EU is to be influencing courts in what is a Stalinist level action, fuck that noise. Even Farage doesn't manage those kind of accusations.

The USA has an arrest warrant out on Snowden and Europe does on Assange. What they did was absolutely 100% in the public interest, but it did break the law as they revealed confidential secrets. The only reason they haven't been extradited (other than Russia and Ecuador playing politics) is because what he did was so overwhelmingly in the public interest.

Legally speaking, its a cut and dry guilty verdict for both (and I'm not arguing against them in saying that, its commonly known).

**Military Prowess**

Often connected to ""Italy did nothing in WWII"" is the idea that Italy was unable to obtain any significant military result since the fall of the Roman Empire. This is not entirely correct. Of course, the predominance of conflicting local powers that followed the fall of the Carolingian empire made it easy for foreign powers such as the Holy Roman Empire to seize control fo the Italian Peninsula, but that should not be ascribed to a lack of military capabilities. This the Staufen emperors (namely Frederick ""Barbarossa"" and Frederick the II, his grandson) discovered the hard way: Barbarossa was heavily defeated by a league of Lombard cities in the battle of Legnano in 1176 (a battle that is often misinterpreted by certain right-wing movements here in Italy) and forced to grant  partial indipendence to said cities. Similarly, Frederick II spent the last part of his life, from 1238 to 1250, struggling in his fight against the united Italian cities. But it doesn't stop here: the Italian Wars that began in 1494 definitely marked the end of many duchy's and county's indipendence, but these are also the years of the military revolution: and it is in Italy that one of the changes that will mark how wars would be fought in the following century has its birthplace: the *trace italienne*, a new type of fortification, also know as star fort, much more resistant to gunpowder artillery. But of course, kingdoms like France, Spain, and the HRE could field bigger armies than those of the small italian republics, and everlasting internal conflicts meant they would stand no chance. Still, despite the loss of indipendence, Italians did not stop fighting; they just fought for someone else: you can find many italian names between high-ranking generals in the following centuries; people like Alessandro Farnese, Ambrogio Spinola, Raimondo Montecuccoli, were able to reach the top of the command chain and to make a name for themselves thanks to their skill on the battlefield; but there were many more, although lesser known, like them.

Luckily that's not how our justice system works. You have a legal title against Russia. The court can't tell you ""nah, we'd like not to enforce it because $reasons"". They have to enforce it because it's a legal title. 

There's no room for politics and diplomacy there anymore (that opportunity is over with a binding legal sentence). The only person who can decided if the title is to be enforced or not is the holder of the title himself.

true,Adventor,null,null,"&gt; You get paid because you earn your company your salary + amount X, or at least they believe you do so. 

Bank XY closes the year with a Multi-Million Dollar loss, yet the higher ranking employees still get high boni. I guess that disproves that theory right there. I'll give you another one: At a certain level, people basically either decide their own salary, or they decide someones salary who in turn then decides their salary. Possibly with a few more steps in between. Those guys would be rather stupid to lower their own salaries as long as no one is forcing them, right? Yet it has nothing to do with deserving the money.

&gt;Supply and demand is another factor. Housecleaner work hard at shitty times and do a very important job, especially in schools or hospital. But due to the high supply of cleaners they don't make sufficient money. The same applies to security guys and other jobs. 

Today, we have a huge amount of C-level (or more generally, high-ranking) executives than 100 years in the past. Yet at the same time, the salary of those guys absolutely went through the roof. Shouldn't that have gone the other way round if your theory is true?

Stepping back a bit.. you made this essentially a question of capitalism. Yet capitalism can be manipulated (and is manipulated daily a million times over, big and small). If capitalism can be manipulated to raise the salary of people, while at the same time increasing the supply of them and not changing the demand much, capitalism stops being relevant to the question and it becomes a matter of ethic.

Add to that the small fact, that only very few people get rich on their own, the vast majority of people inherit most of their wealth. We tend to look a lot at those few who really make their own luck because that's a good story, but it's really only a good story because it is so very rare. Even those who increase their wealth quite a bit usually inherited enough to even be able to take risks without risking everything.

And this is the point where discussion probably stops making sense: In my ethics, its simply not justified that some guy is already born rich, while others have a higher chance of being hit by five lightning strikes in a row than reaching the same level, no matter what they do. If you disagree with that, none of us will probably be able to convince the other.",0,1406567422,null,0,false,0,cja5d1r,t3_2bxrg3,t1_cja5d1r,t1_cja4m6h,null,1434941670,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

All the pipes going from the water tower to the homes are state-owned/managed. However, the water going to the water tower is market-priced, and anyone can supply water to the system as long as they meet a minimum water quality that can be easily tested. Then if someone doesn't like water company A, they switch to B, and B gets more ""credits"" in supplying water, and more money, even though all the companies' water is all mixed together and essentially the same. So in a water-stressed area, someone could start a desalination plant, or truck in water from elsewhere if the price is high enough. It encourages the market to find the cheapest sources of water without having to supply any end-user infrastructure. And prices cannot be politically manipulated and unsustainable practices cannot be implemented in a long-term fashion.

Ero in un periodo di discreta crisi su tutti i fronti, ma soprattutto mi sentivo tradito dal mio corpo dopo aver scoperto di avere una malattia con cui devo convivere per il resto dei miei giorni (niente di particolarmente grave, ma comunque condizionante). Si potrebbe dire che il tatuaggio sia stato un po' il modo di cercare di riprendere, in un qualche modo, il controllo del corpo che mi ha tradito e mi ha scombinato i progetti di vita che avevo.

Volevo farmi un tatuaggio per questi motivi, ma non avevo idea di cosa potesse essere abbastanza unico e significativo. Una sera, mezzo ubriaco, ho avuto un'illuminazione: una lettera, che era una sorta di inside joke ricorrente, con amici e famigliari, con cui si firmava mio padre. Mi piaceva l'idea di avere questo collegamento tra me e lui, in sua memoria, ma che al tempo stesso fosse divertente e intelligente, piuttosto che qualcosa di tristone e scontato.

Sono contento di averlo fatto, semmai mi sono pentito solo di averlo fatto molto scarno, minimalista.

Les conditions de travail ne sont pas id√©ales, mais c'√©tait relativement proche de ce √† quoi je m'attendais : la premi√®re semaine a √©t√© particuli√®rement rude, mon dos a souffert √† force d'√™tre tout le temps debout, il faisait tr√®s chaud, les deux premiers jours j'ai saut√© le repas du midi parce que je n'avais pas faim du tout et il est vrai que j'ai peu bu mais pas parce qu'on me l'interdisait, plus parce que je ne voulais pas boire. Le midi, en-dehors des vacances d'√©t√©, √©taient tr√®s charg√©s, il y avait beaucoup de monde entre 11h30 et 13h30 en gros, mais jamais on ne m'a interdit de boire, m√™me quand on √©tait d√©bord√©s.  
Pour boire, je n'avais qu'√† demander √† la personne qui s'occupait des boissons de me filer de l'eau (fra√Æche). Je pouvais m√™me demander de l'eau p√©tillante (fra√Æche). Plusieurs fois, quand la journ√©e √©tait dure, un manager nous a m√™me fil√© des sodas (coca, fanta, etc.), c'√©tait plut√¥t rare mais c'est d√©j√† arriv√©.  
Mon exp√©rience globale a √©t√© plut√¥t bonne, l'ambiance √©tait excellente, les managers √©taient sympas et ne me traitaient pas comme un chien (il faut dire que tous ceux que j'ai rencontr√©s ont commenc√© en tant qu'√©quipier) et ils n'h√©sitaient pas √† venir nous aider en cuisine s'il le fallait (√ßa vaut √©galement pour le patron d'ailleurs).   
Apr√®s j'ai entendu un employ√© dire que l'ambiance de l'autre McDo d'o√π il venait √©tait bien moins bonne. Je suppose que c'est tr√®s variable, je dois √©galement ajouter que j'√©tais employ√© dans un McDo directement g√©r√© par le groupe McDo, il n'√©tait pas franchis√©.

It seems to take all of the idle speculation of retrospective post-cold war research of the ""kekkonen times"" to make sweeping conclusions about those years. Kekkonen's authority wasn't solely based on his relationship with the Soviets: he was a capable centrist politician who would have no doubt forged a successful career in different circumstances as well without ""abusing"" the soviet menace as a political tool. 

I think Finland could have joined NATO and invited American backing and troops without the Soviets having any chance to intervene (this could have been done in complete secrecy). But the reality is -- and this is something I think Ukraine needs to grapple with as well -- we had massive economic interests in keeping good relationship with the Soviet Union/Russia. The bilateral trade between Finland and USSR employed thousands and formed a major part of Finnish exports. The soviets made huge orders of textiles and other goods, and paid for it in oil and hard cash. If Ukraine could get a deal with Russia that was half as good, it would be absolutely ideal. Even that left-wing hippie surrender monkey Henry Kissinger realizes this. Basically Ukraine would remain ""non-aligned"" but would make Russia pay for it.

On a humorous note, when Kekkonen was re-elected, he had a huge majority of the votes, leading to silly election counts:

true,Kit_Emmuorto,vaticano,,"Dire che Berlusconi √® stato votato per vent'anni solo perch√© nei precedenti quindici aveva rincoglionito gli italiani con le soap opera e Colpo grosso √® come dire che abbiamo perso la seconda guerra mondiale solo perch√© l'equipaggiamento faceva schifo: significa cio√® prendere un solo aspetto - e prenderlo pure parzialmente - e cucirgli intorno a forza la realt√† in modo da darne la lettura pi√π autoconsolatoria possibile (io sono intelligente e quel poco di tv che vedo √® intelligente e per√≤ siccome tutti gli altri sono stupidi e guardano Dallas poi succede questa roba).

Per cominciare, √® curioso attribuire allo scadimento qualitativo (dibattibile, peraltro) della tv commerciale il rincoglionimento di massa sfociato nel voto a Berlusconi perch√© cos√¨ facendo si postulano due cose: a) che quando c'era il monopolio Rai il popolo era politicamente pi√π avveduto (curioso perch√© il periodo in questione coincide col monopolio o quasi della politica da parte della Dc, che almeno a sentire quelli che ""Silvio c'ha rovinato con le tiv√π"" non √® che fosse proprio il massimo); b) che programmi la cui messa in onda in altre parti del mondo non ha impedito a quelle plaghe di continuare ad avere una normale e sana vita democratica hanno invece irreversibilmente pervertito le fragili menti italiane (curioso perch√© va bene dirci scemi da soli ma cos√¨ √® tanta roba).

Premesso questo, i motivi per cui Berlusconi √® stato votato per vent'anni sono altri e sono diversi. Questo non significa che le tv non c'entrino, beninteso: le tv hanno giocato un grande ruolo nell'ascesa di Berlusconi e lo hanno fatto per due motivi. Solo, nessuno di questi √® Beautiful. 1) Le televisioni hanno creato il successo di Berlusconi come imprenditore: grazie alle televisioni Berlusconi si √® imposto come imprenditore stra-bravo e stra-ricco, ovvero l'immagine su cui ha costruito la propria discesa in campo; 2) le televisioni hanno reso possibile il successo di Berlusconi come politico: cavalcando come nessun altro Mani pulite, hanno esasperato la sfiducia dell'elettorato nella politica tradizionale creando per converso il massimo dell'aspettativa e della benevolenza nei confronti dell'outsider di successo che alla politica si prestava e pure malvolentieri.

Basta questo per tutti questi voti e per tutti questi anni? Certo che no. Per spiegare un successo ventennale come quello di Berlusconi servono elementi politici veri e propri. I quali si trovano agevolmente. Elettoralmente, l'Italia non √® mai stato un Paese di sinistra: nella prima repubblica la sinistra ha vinto le elezioni una sola volta (di uno zero virgola, alle Europee e solo grazie all'onda emotiva dovuta alla morte di Berlinguer). L'elettore italiano √® moderato (nel senso che tende ad avere una diffidenza istintiva per gli estremi), teme qualsivoglia salto nel buio e non √® mai uscito dalla fase di fascinazione per l'uomo (per quarant'anni era stato il partito, ma nei fondamentali cambia poco) della Provvidenza. Il combinato disposto di paura dell'ignoto (la gioiosa macchina da guerra caricata a comunisti spaventava molta gente che fino ad allora aveva votato il rassicurante pentapartito) e di stellone berlusconiano venuto a redimere i guasti della politica tangentara portando vittoria e successo come con le tv (e con il Milan, con le case, con tutto il resto) fa il trucco. 

Altri pilastri che vengono messi gi√π in questo periodo e che daranno frutti per chiss√† quanto tempo: a) Silvio vittima (nella narrazione che tanto piace all'elettore dell'eroe solo contro i cattivi, che questi cattivi provino invano trucchi e mezzucci i pi√π biechi per fermarlo non fa che consolidare la simpatia di cui gode); b) sinistra litigiosa ed inaffidabile (pilastro che viene costruito a mani nude dalla sinistra medesima nella disastrosa legislatura '96-'01) rispetto a cui persino le coalizioni di Berlusconi appaiono solide e coese; c) leggi elettorali bipolarizzanti che facilitano la suddivisione berlusconiana del mondo tra buoni (lui) e cattivi (tutti gli altri), gioco nel cui Berlusconi non aveva rivali.

Con questo nessuno vuole negare il ruolo avuto dalle tv (e pi√π in generale dai media) pi√π o meno benevolenti con Berlusconi nella costruzione del suo successo. A tutta l'impalcatura servivano megafoni, e gli organi a questo preposti hanno fatto un eccellente lavoro.

&gt; We are expanding the privatization program. Privatizations are advancing. Non-binding offers have already been received for the airline, TAP, and are expected by end-October for the airport concessionaire, ANA. We expect final decisions to be taken by end-2012, with the financial completion of these transactions in early 2013. Interest in both companies has been strong. In the first quarter of 2013, we expect to advance with the privatizations of the postal company CTT once the universal service provision concession in this sector is granted. **We also expect to proceed with the privatization of the waste management operations of the water company √Åguas de Portugal in the first quarter of 2013, and we are developing a strategic plan by the end of 2012 with other stakeholders‚Äînotably local governments‚Äîto restructure the broader water sector.** We have sought strategic advice on preparing a sale or concession of a television channel and radio station belonging to RTP. The sale of the rail cargo firm CP Carga is expected in the second quarter of 2013. Finally, and while the bulk of eligible assets have already been considered, we are indentifying further public companies and assets that could be privatized. 

There's no mention of what kind of results are to be expected from this actions. 

It pains me to see policies imposed by external non democratic identities as a condition for a bailout...

----

We are having already great results from the partial privatizations: we have one municipality that is bankrupt because of the deal it made to have the water managed by a private company (Barcelos, 172 million EUR in debt) and there's another one that saw its water price increase 17 times (Marco de Canaveses).

*i* am afraid we'll go back to a soft dictature, but i dont see any chance that the voters will wake up. the fact is that orban has cornered the only ideological complex that seems to work, and he's using it to implement his shit-regime.

this ideology is the nationalist ""why is everyone always hurting us"", ""nothing is our fault"", ""turul bird"", ""jesus was hungarian"" idiocy. remember that hungarians as a group are deeply fucked up. we havent looked any of our recent (past 100-200 years) history in the face.

to give examples:

* lots of people feel that the ""theory"" that the hungarian language is related to finnish is a direct attack on hungarians by the austrians.
* trianon is still viewed as the evil french taking our land (never mind what hungarians did to the ethnicities back then, or what they'd do _now_ if they got the land back). suffice to say, they're not thinking of a multi-ethnic federal state when they reimagine greater hungary.
* of _course_ the entire world war two was not our fault and we never did anything wrong. we didnt deport jews either. it was all those bad nazis.

against these memes, there's not much you can do, sadly. democracy, liberalism, due process, all those things we think are important values, well, they arent. not to the people who voted for orban (and will continue to vote for him). 

nor are these particularly important values for MSZP voters, for that matter, so it's not like we can expect to be saved by the opposition. currently it looks like most parties are competing with jobbik on who hates the roma more. because *that* is the important issue we face, right?

true,moriquendo,null,null,"Quran (4:89) - ""They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks.""  

Islam is maybe not entirely to blame, but once the cancer of religious fundamentalism creeps in (as it does from time to time) and people start taking verses like the above seriously (which mainstream Muslims do not), it is difficult (and not very smart) to ignore that it also plays a part in shaping reality.  
Fact is, Islam is changing nowadays. It is reacting to modernity (a modernity that has relegated them to ""has beens"", far removed from the times they had power and a brilliant civilization) and to a contact with non-Muslims that is ""upside down"" from an Islamic point of view: non-believers are supposed to follow and respect Muslim laws, and not the other way round. This may not be explicit at all, but it has been part of the social hierarchy of the countries immigrants come from for so long that it is a cultural attitude comparable to the attitude towards blacks in the Southern USA after Civil rights legislation passed.  
These attitudes required an adjustment to the changed (legal) situation that most have certainly not done from one day to another. And I am not talking about the KKK. I'm talking about perfectly decent people that are not explicitly racist at all, but just never had to deal with a black person sitting next to them in the bus, having lived all their lives in a structurally racist environment. And the Muslim world is in a comparable period of change of things their parents and ancestors have taken for granted, from the education and jobs you can get, clothes you can wear, people you can interact with, the situation of women, the social position of unbelievers, etc. Almost every single thing their religion and traditions have provided them with answers and guidance is put into question by the existence of (Western) alternatives that do quite often seem like the better solution.  
And right now, the reaction to modernity and the change of the environment (e.g. through immigration, but also by being exposed to much ""unislamic"" information and ways through the internet, etc.) has so far predominantly been driven and shaped (also ideologically) by those who have a more ""pious"", literal reading and understanding of their traditions and theri religion. Those who are much more likely to take Quran (4:89) seriously and make it part of their actions.  
The others, the vast majority of cultural, but not very religious, Muslims, do right now not participate much in this change. They stand by, some confused, some indifferent, some fearful, and passively watch these developments unfold. It is imperative to get them to take part in the discussion that will, for good or for ill, shape the future of Islam and thereby the world. It is foolish to abandon the discourse solely to those whose extremist ideas at best make integration impossible, at worst will lead to civil unrest down the road, and whose program can very succinctly be stated as ""Back to the 7th century. (But with AK47s.)""  
This is an important issue for both the West and the Muslim world, and it cannot be simply dismissed by ""this debate is very offensive"" and your are just ignorant and racist. Neither can it be conducted by base accusations and mere insults. ",1,1406574382,null,0,1406574608,0,cja99au,t3_2bxo4b,t1_cja99au,t1_cja0hr0,null,1434943497,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

F√ºr mich werden hier Ablehnung und Angst gegen√ºber moslemischen Migranten hinter einer wissenschaftlichen Fragestellung versteckt. Die Fragesteller wollen die Werte ""der Moslems"" als ungen√ºgend darstellen. Komplizierte Antworten der Wissenschaftler (Auslegung des Korans) interessieren sie helfen gar nicht in dieser Debatte. 

Der durchgeknallte Iraner hat auch ganz wissenschaftlich den Holocaust hinterfragt, und sein (und leider vieler seine Landsleute) Antisemitismus wurde nebenbei bemerkt im wesentlichen aus Europa (insbesondere Deutschland) ""migriert"".

Viele gl√§ubige Moslems tragen keinen Antisemitismus mit sich rum und m√ºssen sich jetzt von Ahnungslosen etwas √ºber den Antisemitismus ihres Glaubens erz√§hlen lassen. Das finde ich anma√üend und respektlos. Als ob jemand den Judenhass der Nazis oder der heutigen ""Reichsdeppen"" mit deren christlichen Glauben erkl√§ren will.

Yes, you CAN say that 95% of times democracy has been attempted, it has failed.  

Does that mean we are to keep trying, keep having Stalins and Maos and the Khmer Rouge etc.. kill millions over and over and over again simply because maybe there is a chance that one day, some time in the future, the magical socialist-land will be achieved and we will create utopia?  No thanks.

The point is that by default stealing is wrong, and you need a good reason to condone it. To me a good reason to let someone take someone else's property is to alleviate suffering, while not making the victim suffer more. That, for instance, includes maintaining a social safety net for healthcare and fighting poverty. Having a population deprived of things like these is worse than letting the government steal in our names. But, there is no escaping that it is stealing, and that we are granting our government an exception, not an inherent right to confiscate things which are not its.

With enough of a marketing anything can be turned into a ""triumph"". For instance they made it the central point of their campaign that we have payed back all loans to the IMF. Failed to mention that we issued state bonds at twice the interest rate, so in reality we simply managed to increase the interest rates on our loans. This narrative is quite strong in Hungary, and as media is in Fidesz hands, you do not hear anything else if you do not read news on the internet.

Sane people just use their central bank to print money and buy up state obligations when they're in a tough spot and creditors get uppity. ""But that will cause inflation!"" Well, we've got *too little* inflation at this point. We need *more inflation*, not less.

true,[deleted],null,null,"How long are you staying?
I'd personally rather rent an apartment and live on my own.

A stanza singola is a single room. It's not just about the size of the bed, you're not allowed to have people over (it really depends on you housemates, but at least not routinely).
If you rent a single room in a 6 single rooms apartment (the first one), that means you're signing up to live with 5 strangers. Also, if you rent 2 (one for you and one for your boyfriend), you're about to spend about the same money you would to rent a one bedroom apartment for the two of you to share.

The first house is nice overall, but I know for a fact (my mother lives around there, a bit more toward the city center and they were renting an apartment in her building a few months ago) that a one bedroom (plus living room with kitchen and bathroom, very well kept) apartment would be about 1k euros a month.

The second link that you poster is a 10 square meters (4 by 2.5) room at 480 euros a month, for a single person, living with 5 strangers with 2 bathrooms to share.
For comparison, my apartment (overall less nice forniture, you could argue) is twelve hundreds a month (rent is 1k, we have 2 double bedrooms and a large living/kitchen, 200 are for expense including building expenses, tv tax, electricity and so forth), and I got to pick who I would live with.

Really it depends on how long you're staying (to rent you a whole apartment, the owner want you to stay at least one year, preferably more than one), but the links you posted, are on the 'average expensive' end of the spectrum (especially the first house seems nicer than average, though).",0,1406576963,null,0,false,0,cjaapc1,t3_2byu5c,t1_cjaapc1,t3_2byu5c,null,1434944243,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

It's not so much a difference in taste in lifestyle, it's that it's hard to partake in the economy like everyone else when you're not settled, or to educate your children for that matter.

In addition, traveling nomads require parking terrains, running water, garbage disposal etc. That all typically is provided by the settled community.

The first and foremost of these reasons is just that it's simply easer to integrate to American society than it is to Swedish society, or general European society of any country. America is very accepting of immigrants, and there are a LOT of them here.

The second reason is that the immigrants themselves tend to be more economic-minded. It's not just that they're usually better educated, it's that **America isn't a welfare state.** You either work hard or you basically live in miserable poverty. This is different from Europe where you can simply live off of the vast welfare schemes of the state if you want to.

true,turnusb,CHIN,China,"Let me preface my comment by saying that as long as someone is protesting within their rights in Europe, I wouldn't like to see people answering them any less peacefully than their protest. But if what people are saying is true about this group of people chanting ""Death to Jews"", I think Police should have stopped the protest. And to tell the truth, I don't think propositions made to the mayor regarding protests without a clear message should be allowed by the mayor because they often end up turning into public hate speech. 

But none of this takes away from the fact that killing people out of ignorance or blind hatred is way worse than supposed hate speech. To murder is worse than to hatefully offend people.

Sikhs have been targeted in the USA by people who don't know what Sikhism is and mistook Sikhs for Muslims. In fact, people remotely brown and beardy have often been the target of hate speech and attacks in the USA since 9/11. And peaceful Muslims have also been targeted simply for being Muslims without having done anything remotely provocative.

The same way there's no excuse for Muslims killing Jews in France, there's no excuse for people in the USA killing whomever for religious reasons. Both are acting out of fanaticism.

So when someone says ""imagine this happening in the US"" implying this wouldn't go down well there, they're actually saying the same thing I am: the US answers fanaticism with more fanaticism. 

I think the fact that in a couple of separate occasions people in the USA have attacked and killed Sikhs out of cheer ignorance and blind hatred is far worse than some Muslims shouting lame slogans, even if they consist of hate speech as the media is reporting was the case here.

Ich teile deine Ziele und verstehe deine Argumentation. Ich habe in den letzten 30 Jahren auch viele Kinder kennen gelernt, die aufgrund des Versagens (Alkoholismus, Psychische Erkrankungen, ...) ihrer Eltern eine sehr schwere Kindheit hatten und nehme das Thema sehr ernst.  

Aber ich denke nicht, dass dieser ""Plan"" funktioniert. Es sind nicht die 1-3 j√§hrigen, die wir besser/leistungsst√§rker machen  (toller formuliert: ""f√∂rdern"") m√ºssen.

Well since you seem aware that the Entitys have almost all competences in their hands, I dont see where all your ""But its does not work"" shtick is coming from, you seem to have fallen for the pre-elections tricks. Claiming the country does not work, when the country has very few powers is a paradoxical argument for me.

&gt;In that case the FBiH government just doesn't have enough political, economical and/or military capital to successfully prevent it from happening and being internationally recognized.

Thats a 50/50 bet in the eyes of the Bosniaks in my opinion, either the end of the country or the ""solving of the problem"" (meaning what the Croatians did to the Serbs in Croatia). Which unfortunately many are looking forward too, with some naive bloodlust and sense of revenge.

I think I explained the whole structural violence thing, international right gives the right of self determination to people who are under structural violence. So its not a blanko check for all the people of the world.

Also committing genocide to form a political organisation and then claim the right for state sovereignty is not how it works in international right.

&gt;And plus what is the benefit to the rest of Bosnia to keep Serbs imprisoned in a state we don't want to be a part of? Do you view this as some kind of punishment or something?

You mean imprisoned in a state the Bosnian Serbs created for themself? That has almost all the powers of a state? Dont you think your perception is a bit off here? 

Also the benefit of unchanged borders is claimed by the Bosniaks, the Bosnian Serbs disagree, and if both are ready to fight over it, then we will have the scenario we are talking about here. 

&gt;In any case, whatever your philosophical beliefs might be, the simple reality is that most Bosnian Serbs are fed up with the current situation and it's only a matter of time before we will seek to be independent.

Its also a simple reality that most Bosniaks are fed up with the secessionist ideas. Both sides have their own realitys, dont forget about the other side when you make your plans.

Also I have no historic hate in me in this matter, a people ethnically cleansing a territory cant claim a right on the territory gained, that way of thinking of mine I do not see as hateful. Maybe your sense of what is ""historic"" is confused with nationalistic trite.

true,Nihilumx,ALBA,Albania,"&gt; Greeks lived as 2nd class citizens in an Apartheid system under Islamic Law . . .

No, they didn't. The Ottomans are widely acknowledged to be a multicultural society who gave their inhabitants autonomy as long as taxes were paid on time.

&gt;The main reason is because Greeks formed isolated communities mostly on islands/rough terrain and payed a substanial amount of their wealth to the ""Jizya Tax""(Religious Tax) so they were left alone.

**Only military-aged males were charged the Jizyah tax in exchange for not being drafted into the Ottoman military, like all other Muslims.** The Christians who didn't want to pay the Jizyah tax became a part of the Ottoman Janissary Corps, which in turn gave them a chance to become a part of the Ottoman aristocracy eventually.

&gt;My point is not that Muslims are incapable of co-existing with the Kuffar . .only that when they reach Majority population the Laws must be suited to fit with Islamic belief system. 

If your point is that when people become the majority, they use democratic means to effect changes into society that reflects what they want, then, well, no shit, sherlock.

true,maefuckingeri,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Not all Muslims in the US and Canada are PhDs, though  we have many refugees here, too.

I didn't say they were, I said to compare Muslim immigrants in terms of quantity and quality between both countries. 

&gt;  It's mostly just that it's so much easier to integrate into American society than it is to integrate into European society.

**[Natives per refugee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_refugee_population)**

United States: 1203
Canada: 203
Sweden: 107

So Canada has about half the number of refugees per native, and the US less than 1/10th. For Canada this means they're short on about 164,000 refugees compared to Sweden. For the US lets not even go there because it's beyond ridiculous. 

Of course that didn't even took into account the [kind of refugees](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/timeline.asp). Hint: Syrians and Somalis are probably a bit harder to integrate than say Bosnians. 

And this doesn't even take immigration into account. Again, look into the number and kinds of immigration you're receiving and then make a point.

All Greeks had to pay Jizya, no exceptions and not only for Military Aged Males.

It all depends on the context. French, Greek or Latin loan words are somewhat common and tend to carry similar connotations as in English (languages of nobility and science, basically).

While Germans are entirely forgiven for their past actions (and rightfully so), and it is due to the rhetoric of ""Hitler and the Nazis were the bad ones and the German people were only victims as well"". The Serbs however, were condemned directly and their nationalistic attitude certainly doesn't help them improve their image today. That's what I was pointing out in my original comment.

I understand, you're Croat, but not acknowledging real history certainly won't help with the ethnic tensions in the region. It worked for Germany because the scapegoat (Nazis) no longer existed, however Serbia and the Serbs are still there and being condemned for everything that has happened in Yugoslavia and thus fueling nationalism on their side.

Why not? It's not like rivers/lakes/groundwater reservoirs have one faucet each. We already extract water at different places from the same water bodies. In my city we get a mixture from the local river and a lake. Other cities also tap that river and many, many more cities tap that same lake.

&gt; How do you sell a river?

You don't. You sell permits that allow the buyer to tap X m¬≤/day.

&gt; What stops them from pumping it completely dry when their only concern is profit?

What stops them from robbing people on the street? Lawmakers, judges and police.

&gt; Any supply of water that is distributed is going to be from local locations.

Nope. The lake I mentioned earlier is about 250 km away. I wouldn't call that local.

&gt; And what then happens to the used water? Are they shipping it back to the company?

It is possible -- even good practice -- to have different facilities at different locations. Treating wastewater and putting it back into nature has nothing to do with taking freshwater from nature and piping it into reserviors. When you buy a jar of peanut butter, do you ship the jar back to the production company when it's empty?

If it makes you feel any better, I'm very much against privatisation of water utilities. I just try to keep my personal opinions out of rational discussions as they don't add anything.

Personally i love the region. I'd rather suggest to visit the general area if you do not have a total castle fetish. I'd advice you to make a day trip into austria/swiss/lichtenstein if you are allowed to with your VISA or whatever you got. Seeing another castle isn't really adding more, is it? (marginal benefit)

The area is a huge hops production area with a lot of smallish local breweries etc. a lot of fruit production.

There are castle hotels in Meersburg and Wasserburg you could check out. One of them used to be the holiday place for the Hollenzollern family. There were plans to make a completely straight street but that never came true. But a huge part near Sigmaringen goes 100% straight through the woods to get there.

You might enjoying [Ravensburg](http://www.ravensburg.de/rv/tourismus/stadt-der-tuerme/stadt-der-tuerme.php) too, it has a lot of  medieval towers and stuff left because it was a red-cross city in WWII and was almost undamaged.

A liberal continental communist federalist MEP and globalist was holding a speech on Josef Stalin, known pro-European.

‚ÄùBefore the session begins, you must get on your knees and worship the EU and accept that it is the greatest nation the world has ever known, even greater than Great Britain!‚Äù

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, nationalist dual-UKIP/FN champion who had served 15 years of duty in the EP and understood the necessity of border controls and fully supported all opt-outs from the EU treaties stood up and held up a banana.

‚ÄùHow straight is this banana, pinhead?‚Äù

The arrogant MEP smirked quite gypsy-like and smugly replied ‚Äúnot at all, you stupid libertarian.‚Äù

‚ÄùWrong. It is straight. If it was bendy as you say‚Ä¶ then it should be banned now.‚Äù

The MEP was visibly shaken, and dropped his manuscript and copy of the Ventotene Manifesto. He stormed out of the plenary chamber crying those continental crocodile tears. The same tears continentals cry for the ‚Äúpoor‚Äù (who today live in such great conditions they don't even die in trenches any more) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the virtuous northern countries. There is no doubt that at this point our MEP, Jean-Claude Schulz, wished he had not been a statist and become more than just a government parasite. He wished so much that he could lock himself alone in his office to hide his embarrassment, but he himself had abolished all borders including closed doors!

The other MPs applauded and all registered UKIP that day and accepted Nigel Le Pen as their dear leader. A bulldog and a rooster, both coincidentally named ‚ÄúNation State‚Äù walked into the room and together pissed on the European flag. The EU treaties were burned several times, and Putin himself showed up and broke up the EU.

The MEP lost his seat and was completely unable to find employment in the private sector lacking a STEM degree.

true,machoki,HUNG,Hungary,"After all the Romanian flair people saying ""let's invade them again"" I salute this question. It's unfortunate that a minority behaves like that in such a beautiful country.

Hard question. ""Where we'll end up?"" I guess you mean the future, so about 6-7 years from now. Orb√°n's support is shrinking comparing to 4 years ago when he won a clear 2/3rd majority. Today he could only archieve that with giving passports to Hungarian minorities in neighbouring countries for votes. More than 90% of the people wo got handed passports voted for him. Ironically the hundreds of thousands of people who have left Hungary to work abroad, had it much harder to cast their votes, since the majority wouldn't have given their support for Fidesz. In a personal opinion I think people who haven't lived in our country ever shouldn't be able to decide for as. Here I'm talking to the minority.

in Hungary, I think it was 2003 or something like that there was a popular vote if we should hand passports to the Hungarian people abroad and the voters **rejected** it. Just to point out that this issue (which unfortunately can cause problems in the relations of our countries in the future) is made by a party which accumulated such power that it could decide on it alone, even though the majority of the population has proven that it's against it.

Fidesz could also only get this amount of popularity with constant propaganda from TV channels that investors close to him bought, the national radio station, and even the free newspaper you get at the metro entrance. The independent european committee which observed the election said that the elections weren't illigitimate but favoured Fidesz.

Fidesz also changed the electoral law comparing to 4 years ago, and only with that they wouldn't have reached 2/3rds again. But even with that they were **one** seat short of the majority so they changed a law to reach that one seat. Tells you a lot about todays democratic Hungary.

I haven't really answered the question until now but I say it: in 5 years either Hungary will become a more nationalistic leaning ever more towards authoritarian rule, or people will wake up and bring it down to pieces just as it happened to the left in 2006. 

It's in the hands of the students, and Budapest. Fidesz doesn't or barely has a majority in the capital any more.

ISIL's success comes from political dissent in Iraq from an incompetent government. The vast majority of the territory it holds is desert and very large parts of the populations ran away.

ISIL isn't as big as you're making it out to be, and while they wont simply be crushed and swept under the rug, they're going to be relegated to another organization on par with Al Qaeda, or at the very worst case scenario, the Taliban.

I'm just going to save myself time and reply to your other comment as well.


&gt;&gt;You realize not every Muslim believes the exact same things and that the interpretations are widely different?

&gt;Actually, islam is very... coherent, for lack of a better word.

&gt;&gt;It's as racist to call Muslims women haters as it is to say black people are criminals or lazy.

&gt;Yeah well what I said is that ""there is a lot of minogyny"" in islam. Because there is. The link above is one example.
But hey, it's racist to imply communists have something against private ownership and nazis don't like jews. I mean, there are different interpretations and all people are different. Right?


No, Islam is not coherent at all. If you want to compare it to other organized religion, it's about as coherent as a church choir where every person is singing out of sync. They're all reading from the same hymn sheet but what comes out is entirely different. There's no church hierarchy and it has as many separate denominations as Christianity itself, all with varying levels of extremism.

Anyone can claim religious authority, so long as someone will listen to them. I cannot open up a church tomorrow and claim to be a Catholic priest, however I could open a mosque and claim to by a Sunni Imam. Combine that with the extremely uneducated population, and that leaves a lot of room for Muslims to start getting wildly different ideas on what things actually mean. 

Compound this with the fact such Islamic pastors are viewed with massive amounts of respect, as my own country used to view Catholic priests, people can be influenced to think whatever it is their religious authority desires them to. You need only look at Ireland's development during the 20th century and you can see this happen, just with different names.

Secondly, your comparison of Muslims to Communists in terms of how they viewed their respective ""enemies""(Jews and Nazis respectively) **does not match up**. 

I don't doubt antisemitism is a real thing in North Africa and Arabian regions but it is politically charged, not religiously, where in a region where religion is a very strong identifier due to the weakness of the nation-state concept, Jews can often be synonymous with Israel. In the Western world, that doesn't fly, and rightly so, but they mean two different things in two different places. 

In contrast to the Communist view on Nazism, where they were two ideologically opposed forces, Islam and Judaism are not ideologically opposed at all and there's nothing in either Judaism or Islam that dictates as such, except for **highly** contextual passages that applied to very specific situations.

The passage which you've highlighted as misogyny is not widely practiced in a word for word fashion; In reality, countries like Egypt have massive divorce rates, and that's a country with a population with very strong religious roots; Islam, like all religions, tends to get outmoded as society changes, and like all religions, they tend to adapt with the time. One example I can give off the top of my head of a non-Islamic country having religiously influenced draconian laws was that divorce was **outlawed** in Ireland until 1996, and that was because of the Catholic Church.

So, yeah, you can say Islam was/is a misogynistic religion, but it isn't even **close** to unique in that regard, and the general populations are progressing at their own rate. The problem for **us** is when descendants of immigrants to Western countries grow up disadvantaged and then end up turning to extremism and reigniting these kinds of beliefs, and that in turn creates ""integration problems"". The problem is not Islam in of itself, it is the socioeconomic status of people turning to its more fundamentalist aspects. You'll see the same thing in the US and Christianity, poor/disadvantaged populations end up being very religious(One of the things that has lead to the ""religious black people"" stereotype).

In conclusion;

1. You are exaggerating ISIL's influence. Right now it's big because it capitalized on a volatile political situation, and extremists Muslims use them as a rallying point. Not to mention their flag is very generic and can be used entirely independent of ISIL in of itself. 

2. Islam is not a coherent religion. While the very fundamentals are largely agreed upon, there is a lot of variation, even within the same Islamic denominations

3. Combine this with the uneducated populations, and religion can be used as a tool of political influence, created religious extremists

4. Antisemitism is real, but the cause and meaning is not exactly what we usually recognize it as

5. There is no inherent diametrical opposition between Islam and Judaism(And by extension Muslims and Jews), excluding the opposiion that comes from the reality that they are two different religions

6. Misogyny is real but hardly unique and not as widely practiced as one might think. If one were to criticize Islam on this, it would have to be a pretty universal condemnation of many religions, particularly the Abrahamic ones.

7. Turns to fundamentalist/extremist religion is a matter of socioeconomic status, not fundamental fact of belonging to that religion in the first place.
