We had to have vacancies, made public in the government gazette, and a selection process to pick the best candidate, typically deciding via anonymous voting. 

It is true that sometimes vacancies are made available with someone  specific in mind, but people are simply invited to apply. And often they don't get the position because competition in academia can be quite tough.


I can guarantee you this guy will be doing way more money than most lecturers, some with many years of experience, having proven their worth in their field. This guy has little experience yet they thought it would be appropriate to hire him with no competition and no interview.

It runs rampant in Portugal, from high paying jobs to simple menial county jobs. It's deep rooted, and the basis for this is how Portuguese culture focus on family.

The only reason for this to go on is because the State is not healthy. Checks and balances only work for those with no connections. Depending on your level of wealth and connections, there's always a way out. There's a politician/banker arrested here and there, but there isn't a systemic fight against corruption because the elected officials are involved in it as well. 

Portugal's revolution threw off a dictatorship but failed to provide competent democratic leaders. We might argue that not all of them were incompetent, but most were. Some were even criminal in my view. 

Barroso came from this group of bad politicians, and was among the least capable. Trully incipient, he announced that Portugal was facing trouble and then left for Brussels, leaving a political crisis and Portugal (after a transition government for 6 months) in the hands of José Sócrates, a charismatic figure that debated by talking over everyone (which i guess people loved...) and that effectively gave the last push to shove Portugal down the cliff, while most people cheered for him. He too is suspected of taking bribes when he was Minister of the Environment.

SD would most likely demand immigration restrictions for any supply which would be a bitter pill for Alliansen to swallow. And not just that but a coalition that has such a small majority of just 3 seats would be very unstable. 

Plus analysts say that SD might be considering self-preservation by not backing Reinfeldt and letting a mainly left wing coalition to rule given that they are more supportive of letting in more asylum seekers then the current government.

http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article19461387.ab

Under ""Flyktingopinionen""

Alliansen Supporters: 27% Want more, 43% want as it is, 26% Want less.

Socialist+Left/communist+Greens: 34% want more, 42% want as it is, 19% want less. 


IF the left wing coalition does as it proposes which is to allow even more asylum seekers and IF it backfires, this could be political fuel for the SD in the next election. To the other scenario, Imagine if reinfeldt does reverses his position and seeks support from the SD, supports immigration restrictions but because of a host of many different factors that Reinfeldt becomes even more unpopular then he is currently. Then by the next election this will cause SD support to decrease since they'll be associated with reinfeldt.

&gt; Avete mai acquistato musica in formato ""liquido""?

Raramente.

&gt; Siete abbonati a servizi di streaming on demand tipo Spotify?

No.

&gt;Nel caso acquistiate ancora copie fisiche degi album, dove lo fate, su internet (quali siti?) oppure nei pochissimi negozietti tradizionali superstiti? In quale formato?

Amazon (roba usata per lo piu'), negozi

&gt; Quanti dischi comprate in media in un anno?

un centinaio

&gt; Quali sono gli ultimi che avete comprato?

Di recente ho comprato i tre album dei [Black Dog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Dog_%28band%29) i migliori 10$ degli ultimi tempi.

In an ideal world, the EU would have it's own directly elected government body that is independent from the nation states it represents. But going down this path would mean a federal Europe much like the United States.
But most nation states understandably do not want to give up their sovereignty out of fear that they might have to pass laws they don't want.
To prevent this, the EU not only has elected members, but also technocrats and heads of state that have a say in the way the EU is run.

To the lay person, this is all very complicated, and so the EU is accused of not being democratic. It is for the most part, but it is everything but transparent. The result is that most EU citizens feel the EU is unaccountable for their actions. There is no single body you can try to vote out of power if you don't like how they've managed things.

With that, you get the following situation: If a local politician needs to pass an unfavourable law that will cost him votes, he gets together with the equivalent local ministers of the other EU nations and gets the law passed on an EU level. 

Once an EU law is passed, all EU members must pass this law in their own countries. Our local politician can now wash his hands from the whole matter and tell his constituents: ""Hey, I don't want this law either, but Brussels is forcing us to pass it anyway.""
And so the voters blame Brussels in the belief it is unaccountable anyway, and our politician gets to keep his votes.

And if this same minister uses this as an excuse to try to curb the powers of the EU, he may actually gain even more votes, simply because his voters don't realise their being played.

The result is that for most EU member states, making the EU more transparent isn't actually in their best interest. Nor is getting rid of it either. ",0,1409625521,null,0,false,0,ck6rgr3,t3_2f77vd,t1_ck6rgr3,t1_ck6ko7i,null,1427247227,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

It was fairly apparent when mass surveillance relating to the US was all over this sub (and rightfully so, it affects everyone). But many people were not even aware of metadata collection by their respective European countries because when it was posted here it would usually drop off relatively quickly without many comments. 

Another good example is TTIP. Canada's trade deal was applauded despite being negotiated behind closed doors and containing an investor-state dispute clause. Japan has one in the works with the EU right now, also behind closed doors, also almost guaranteed to have a ISD clause. Not a peep about Japan's deal though. 

In a European context it seems stuff the UK does is brought up more often, and more recently Germany (or possibly what it is not doing). It seems like large and influential countries tend to receive more scrutiny which is why the UK and Germany tend to get a lot of discussion on here even if it is for things they are not doing.

It does depend though, lately I've seen some critical KiyvPost articles. 

Lastly, separatists aren't terrorists, I am tired of hearing that. They just released all 220 prisoners they captured in the Ilovaisk encirclement back to Kiev, as they have done with almost every prisoner. They do this even though it's pretty much granted that the Ukrainian Army isn't going to just let any separatists go if it captures them. Of course, Ukrainian Army has a good reason for keeping separatists locked up -- treason is no joke -- but my point is that the separatists are doing things that they frankly don't have to, despite this sub claiming that they're all bloodthirsty savages who torture and kill all their prisoners. Torturing prisoners is common in the Ukrainian Army too, it's war out there. Most prisoners avoid such a fate, but not always.

If it's a *w* at the end of the word, it does turn into an *f*. However, if there is another word after it, then depending on its beginning that effect may or may not take place. If there's a vocalized consonant like *b, d, dz, dź, g*, and a bunch of others, then the *w* in Wrocław remains vocalized instead of turning into an unvocalized *f*. Vowels may have a similar effect in certain dialects. This kind of phonetic assimilation takes place for all consonants in Polish, including the ones in the middle of words.

&gt; Ladies' Home Journal article in June 1918 said, ""The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl."" Other sources said blue was flattering for blonds, pink for brunettes; or blue was for blue-eyed babies, pink for brown-eyed babies, according to Paoletti.

&gt; In 1927, Time magazine printed a chart showing sex-appropriate colors for girls and boys according to leading U.S. stores. In Boston, Filene's told parents to dress boys in pink. So did Best &amp; Co. in New York City, Halle's in Cleveland and Marshall Field in Chicago.

Et [même avant, en 1900](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7817496.stm)

&gt;The Women's Journal explained it thus: ""That pink being a more decided and stronger colour, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.""

Et même un ptit peu avant dans le milieu du [19e siècle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink#The_19th_century)

&gt; In 19th century England, pink ribbons or decorations were often worn by young boys; boys were simply considered small men, and while men in England wore red uniforms, boys wore pink. In fact the clothing for children in the 19th century was almost always white, since, before the invention of chemical dyes, clothing of any color would quickly fade when washed in boiling water. Queen Victoria was painted in 1850 with her seventh child and third son, Prince Arthur, who wore white and pink.

You should develop so that your brain is used to getting new vocabulary etc first. When I started learning German, it could take a while for new words and phrases to set in, for example and after I spent some time learning the language it came to a point where I could often only need to hear a new word once to have it put in my memory. Watching a movie in English with German subtitles would be extremely difficult and frustrating at times. What I would recommend is to find a series of movies that you love and know very well and find their German dubbed versions. That way you have a very good idea of what is being said, where the plot is going etc, but you will also get an opportunity to start getting your brain listening to normal speaking speeds of German (which will seem very fast at first) and you can pick up on new vocabulary a lot more naturally than if you were to try to listen to English and read German at the same time.

La technique utilisé ? Le bon vieux ""mot de passe oublié"", où il vous suffit de répondre à quelques questions ""personnels"" sur la victime (nom du chien, adresse de l'école primaire, etc...); informations retrouvés aisément grâce à Facebook, Copain d'avant, etc...

Sowas wie HBO wird es in Deutschland nie geben so lange die öffentlich rechtlichen existieren. Diese sind der Grund dafür, dass es hier kein Qualitätsfernsehen mehr gibt, weil jegliche Konkurrenz um die Zuschauer verloren gegangen ist. Die ÖR können machen was sie wollen, sie werden zwangsalimentiert. Die Privaten können nur billigsten Scheiß produzieren und richten ihr Programm dementsprechend zugrunde. 

Die Lösung ist so einfach wie unbürokratisch. Man orientiere sich am Beispiel Israel. Staatlicher Rundfunk geschlossen, alle Mitarbeiter entlassen, Zwangsgebühren abgeschafft. Plötzlich steigt die Qualität des produzierten Materials des Privatfernsehens auf Ebenen weit über dem, was der Staatsfunk produzieren konnte.

Then come back when you think of a better way to wrestle 2/3 of hostages from animals armed with automatic weapons (do you know how many people one person armed with an assault rifle can kill?) that have nothing to lose and strap bombs to 7 year old kids. Can you even fucking IMAGINE what it's like being the team leader tasked with entering a building with 1000+ civilians?

Motherfucker won't even bother to cite anything, besides pandering to the typical view of ""Speznaz = Bad"", when the things they've had to deal with NO-ONE has had to face. Some countries launch airstrikes against compounds with hostages in them, some countries only ever have to deal with lone psychopaths, and you go try shitting on Speznaz, that's really legit and brave.

Let him have Belarus and Kazakhstan as sphere states and start working to counter his influence in Central Asia.

true,LenryNmQ,EURO,That part with millions of hungarians,"&gt; I fail to see the problem in state controlling the textbooks or publishing them themselves

As someone, who works for the (previously) largest publishing house of educational books, here's some important enlightenment.

The textbooks were always under really strict state-control. Schools could only buy books, which are on the ""Schoolbook list"" (Tankönyvlista)
To be on that list, the book has to comply with the state's curriculum (which is pretty strict in Hungary, virtually teachers has no word on what do they want to teach), it has to be accredited by a state authority (which costs thousands of euros, each year, for each book), and after that, the state write the price tag either...
(because of social reasons, and because some of the children's books are ""free"", they are library-properties)

But that all changed last december, ~~when the Fire Nation attacked~~ when the ruling party drafted a law, which abolish the free market in textbook publishing, take every aspect of it in state-control, and came to force in just two weeks later, 1st of January, 2014.

Now, if we overlook the dickheadness of introducing a law during Christmas, which instantly eradicate a whole industry and make thousands of people unemployed by New Year's Eve, the state had no publishers, writers, designers, editors, printshops, or anything that necessary for making books, and they had no time for this whole thing (no, 9 months aren't enough to make a quality textbook).
And on top of everything, we saw hundreds of times that pretty much on anything the state gain control will become worse, slower, waterheaded, corrupted and more expensive for the taxpayers *(unfortunately most of the people buy the bullshit of ""free stuff from the state"", and never think about where does the money for the free things came from)*

Of course the state saw this, and refined the situation. They bought two smaller publishing houses to make the new books, and published the [new Schoolbook List](http://www.oktatas.hu/pub_bin/dload/kozoktatas/tankonyvjegyzek/kirtkv2014_kozlony_140628.pdf), containing most of the old publishing houses books (4280 books), and announced, that anyone can order any book.
Meanwhile they secretly sent a mail to all of the state-run schools principals, with a [""Recommended Schoolbook List""](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=forums&amp;srcid=MTU2ODgzNjQ2NzkwMTk2Mzc5MjMBMDI1OTU1NjU3NDc0NjI2OTk2MjkBVzQ4NmlKZFVsWE1KATAuMgEBdjI), containing mostly the new, ""experimental"" schoolbooks (about 300 books, ""Kísérleti"" in the title), most of them aren't even exist by the time, but as most of the schools are run by the state, the principals are appointed by the Ministry of Education, and every teacher is employed directly by the state, nobody complained about it.

That's where we are now. The new schoolyear started with half-ready experimental books in thousands of schools, but the govmnt can say that the transformation of textbook-publishing is done and was a success.
In the name of the hungarian state is better in everything, than anyone else.

First of all I want to remind you that 2 US citizens died on a plane that was supposedly taken down by the rebels. But OK, the US doesn't owe Ukraine and especially Europe anything, they could let Europe burn if they wanted to, but Europe **should** do something. 

When a war is so close to your borders (I'm talking about NATO/EU members) you shouldn't sit idly by, no sane country should. We ARE involved in this war and this WILL drag us eventually if it doesn't stop. The moment that plane went down is when NATO should have went in, taken out the rebels and remain there to secure the land. Almost 300 people mostly EU citizens died, we're involved. 

People were downvoting me like crazy and calling me a nut when I said Russia will take Crimea and won't stop there. They said:

""Russia won't take Crimea guys, come on"". Then afterwards they said that in Crimea there are mostly Russian speakers and it's OK, but Russia surely won't do ANYTHING in Eastern Ukraine. Now they're there, with actual Russian military. Russia wants to create a land corridor to Crimea and it will as current events show. Then Russia will eye Transnistria and it will take it. The more this conflict lasts the more Russia's confidence grows.

Do you remember when Obama said that if Putin messes with Ukraine's Presidential elections he'll make Russia's economy bleed? I believe he meant it and it was a direct threat, so Putin did nothing. That's what Russia understands, power. US CAN do a lot to hurt Russia economically but right now they aren't. 

You don't stop war by showing you're not willing to fight, you stop wars by showing you're willing to engage in one. Russia can't stand a chance even in the best possible scenario against NATO and the prospect of them using nukes in Europe is laughable.

Allo stesso modo se nella mia città gli immigrati sono circa il 10%, ma osservo che il 60% delle persone al PS non è di origine italiana, questo è un dato statisticamente significativo se ho visto più di, diciamo, 10 persone in totale. Anche qui non ti tedio con i dettagli matematici.

Cosa significa ""statisticamente significativo""? In parole povere significa che è molto improbabile che ciò che osservo sia il risultato di una fluttuazione casuale, e che con tutta probabilità c'è qualche relazione tra le due osservazioni (""i biondi vanno solo in quel locale, perché..."", ""gli immigrati vanno di più al PS perché ..."").

&gt;__Statistical significance__ is the low [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) of obtaining at least as extreme results given that the [null hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis) is true.        It is an integral part of [statistical hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing) where it helps investigators to decide if a [null hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis) can be rejected.   In any [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment) or [observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study) that involves drawing a [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics\)) from a [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population), there is always the possibility that an observed effect would have occurred due to [sampling error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_error) alone.   But if the probability of obtaining at least as extreme result (large difference between two or more sample means), given the null hypothesis is true, is less than a pre-determined threshold (e.g. 5% chance), then an investigator can conclude that the observed effect actually reflects the characteristics of the population rather than just sampling error.

true,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"You'll have difficulty finding American-style measuring cups, if that's what you mean by your third item -- German recipes go by weight, not volume (except for liquids). Of course, the beauty of measuring cups is, it doesn't much matter what size the cup is, as long as you use the same one consistently -- the only issue is going to be how many eggs to use. And you'll have to estimate fractions of a cup, but with practice that's not too difficult.

You can buy measuring jugs in Germany. You can get ones that look like British measuring jugs, but the more usual type is conical, tapering towards the bottom, making it easier to measure smaller amounts. They're marked off not only by volume, but also by weight of some common dry ingredients (flour, sugar, etc). If you have an American recipe, a standard cup is a bit less than 250 ml, so you can use that as a rough guide.

As others have stated, you can get these items at any department store, but it's actually worth shopping around and seeing what the various stores offer (especially if you're on a budget -- department stores tend not to be cheap, although their products may be of better quality... some of the time). Woolworth's still exists in Germany, and there are also ""€1 shops"" where you may be able to pick up a few useful bits and bobs. There are many of the familiar clothing stores, like TK Maxx and C&amp;A, as well as German ones like Peek und Cloppenburg and s.Oliver (although those are on the expensive side). Really, just look around and familiarise yourself with the various stores and shops. Don't be afraid to go in and take a look.

If by ""incense"" you mean joss sticks, you're looking for ""Räucherstäbchen"". I'm sure you might be able to find some in the larger department stores, but there are specialist shops you can try.

There is no evidence that russia is in ukraine now. I think that rebels may have some intel from russia but that's all. UA army has intel from US agents and  US already admited that.

The deal is UA army is absolutelly not ready for this war, most of their best division is already dead or missing or deserted. They are leaving equipment behind them (i saw like 10-20 videos of donetsk forces capturing abandoned equipment on checkpoints) and now due to this, militias look like real russian army because they have tanks and grads and stuff but they are not. They just took what was left from divisions that were destroyed or deserted in tight encirclement.

That's difficult to explain more fully, but very roughly, ""mir"" is similar to English ""to me"". That's not a very reliable rule, but it illustrates why you say ""Mir ist kalt.""

In English, we say, ""I am cold""; a literal-minded German, though, would interpret that to mean ""I am cold to the touch"". It's not you that's actually cold, unless you're dead, because the human body has this knack of maintaining a constant temperature of 37°C. What's cold is *the weather*, and so Germans say, ""It is cold **to me**.""

&gt;In general, the criticism was denied by the Russian government. President Vladimir Putin specifically dismissed the foreign criticism as Cold War mentality and said that the West wants to ""pull the strings so that Russia won't raise its head.""[121]

&gt;The Russian government defended the use of tanks and other heavy weaponry, arguing that it was used only after surviving hostages escaped from the school. However, this contradicts the eyewitness accounts, including by the reporters and former hostages.[239] According to the survivors and other witnesses, many hostages were seriously wounded and could not possibly escape by themselves, while others were kept by the militants as human shields and moved through the building.[65]

&gt;Deputy Prosecutor General of Russia Nikolai Shepel, acting as deputy prosecutor at the trial of Kulayev, found no fault with the security forces in handling the hostage crisis, ""According to the conclusions of the investigation, the expert commission did not find any violations that could be responsible for the harmful consequences.""[36][240] Shepel acknowledged that commandos fired flamethrowers, but said this could not have sparked the fire that caused most of deaths;[94] he also said that the troops did not use napalm during the attack.[13]

&gt;To address doubts, Putin launched a Duma parliamentary investigation led by Alexander Torshin,[241] resulting in the report which criticised the federal government only indirectly[242] and instead put blame for ""a whole number of blunders and shortcomings"" on local authorities.[243] The findings of the federal and the North Ossetian commissions differed widely in many main aspects.[84] Deputy Prosecutor General Vladimir Kolesnikov, sent by Putin in September 2005 to investigate the circumstances, concluded on 30 September that ""the actions of the military personnel were justified, and there are no grounds to open a criminal investigation.""[244]

&gt;In 2005, previously unreleased documents by the national commission in Moscow were made available to Der Spiegel. According to the paper, ""instead of calling for self-criticism in the wake of the disaster, the commission recommended the Russian government to crack down harder.""[1]

true,Propsat,null,null,"Die Rundfunkgebühren sind richtig und wichtig, damit sich das deutsche Volk seine Meinung auf Grundlage der Meinung der Regierung bilden kann. Zudem sind die deutschen Rundfunkanstalten nötig um auch Politiker nach dem Ausscheiden aus der Politik vor dem Hartz4 Bezug zu schützen. Sie leisten damit auch einen gesellschaftlichen Beitrag und sparen somit die Hartz4 Beiträge für jene Politiker.

Über die geringe Höhe und die Gleichbehandlung sollten sich die Bürger stets freuen. Schließlich sind alle Menschen gleich, ob man nun mehrere Millionen im Monat verdient oder eben knapp über der Armutsgrenze lebt, jeder zahlt diesen Betrag gerne. Da fühlt man sich gleich und das stärkt den Zusammenhalt in der Gesellschaft. Zwanzig Euro sind für den am Hungertuch nagenden schließlich genau so zwanzig Euro wie für den Milliardär.

Auch ist die exzellente Berichterstattung des ÖRR hervorzuheben. Privatsender, ob national oder international schicken zu Weltereignissen wie den Olympischen Spielen selten mehr Vertreter als Sportler des Landes und können so kaum eine adäquate Berichterstattung garantieren. Anders die deutschen Rundfunkanstalten, welche stets mehr Angestellte in die Austragungsorte schicken, als deutsche Sportler anwesend sind. So muss Berichterstattung aussehen.

Die Kritik ist weitgehend unbegründet, von einem Zwang kann unmöglich gesprochen werden, insbesondere wenn man dem Profit den die gesamte Gesellschaft daraus zieht den Gebühren gegenüber stellt. 

Die Verfassunggerichtshöfe in Bayern und Koblenz haben mit ihrer wegweisenden Begründung ja alles klar gestellt. So heißt es in der Urteilsbegründung: 

„[...]dass der öffentlich-rechtliche Rundfunk in besonderem Maß die Grundlagen der Informationsgesellschaft fördert und einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Integration und Teilhabe an demokratischen, kulturellen und wirtschaftlichen Prozessen leistet“. 

Das ist natürlich so, weil es so ist. Daraus ergibt sich:

„[...]ist grundsätzlich jede Person im Einwirkungsbereich des öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunks an der Finanzierungsverantwortung zu beteiligen, weil sie einen gleichsam strukturellen Vorteil aus dessen Wirken zieht“. 

Man sieht, jeder zieht einen strukturellen Vorteil daraus, auch wenn er die Rundfunkangebote nicht nutzt. Wie denn das? fragen nun einige Kritiker. Nun, ganz einfach. Indem dein Nachbar sich gut informieren kann, profitierst auch du von dem öffentlich rechtlichen Rundfunk, denn er sorgt dafür, dass dein Nachbar sich seine Meinung auf Grundlage der Meinung deiner Regierung gebildet hat. Diese ist dem deutschen Volk verpflichtet und arbeitet in deinem Interesse. So auch der Rundfunk, selbst wenn du ihn gar nicht nutzt. Du profitierst sozusagen ""um die Ecke herum.""

Diese bestechende Argumentation der Gerichtshöfe sind Meilensteine der Rechtsprechung.

Man sollte die Rundfunkgebühren daher unbedingt anheben um die Rundfunkanstalten zu noch festeren Pfeilern der Demokratie und Meinungsbildung zu machen. Dazu muss man selbstverständlich auch endlich die Werbung nach Vorbild der privaten Rundfunksender zulassen, diese Ungleichheit des Wettbewerbs ist eine Farce in einer Gesellschaft die auf Chancengleichheit beruht.

However I'm really glad that Sverigedemokraterna exist because they force the other major parties (including the one I voted for) to acknowledge and discuss the problems with Sweden's immigration policies.

As a dual citizen (American/Swedish) since birth, I find that a lot of Swedes I talk to in person are very concerned about the huge influx of immigrants with zero or very little formal education, and the enormous burden they put on the social services meant for Swedes. However while they're comfortable sharing this with me because I wasn't raised in Sweden and they seem to see me as somewhat of an outsider who won't judge them, when we're out together with other Swedes they suddenly become very tight lipped and won't discuss immigration unless it's to say how great it is that we're helping those in need from other countries.

Although I wouldn't vote for SD myself, I wouldn't necessarily call those who do racists. Sweden desperately NEEDS to discuss the long-term effects of the government's immigration policies and whether it's sustainable. The problem currently is that it's social and political suicide to be anything other than 100% supportive of more and more immigrants.

Putin seems to be laughing at the West as more and more of his assets/men funnel into the country under the most flimsy excuses ever given. So far we've had two rounds of sanctions, and neither has ended the conflict. The separatists seemed all but beaten before Russian involvement re-invigorated them.

It's true that nobody wants a war, and that's a good thing. Nobody is moving toward overt military conflict. But the only diplomatic solution that will end the conflict now is one that sees Ukraine broken up, because that's the solution that is acceptable to Russia. They won't stop until they achieve it. 

Meanwhile in Western EU govt statements we hear meaningless phrases like 'strongly condemn' and 'deepening concern'. We know that some of an appropriate response is muted because Germany is 30% reliant on Russian oil/gas. In that sense Germany is essentially choosing it's own security over its values, which I think people sense. 

This thing is dragging out way longer than it should have. Russia should have been given a week to hand Crimea back to Ukraine or be immediately hit with the 'Stage 3' sanctions that are only now being discussed. After MH17 was blown out of the air. After thousands have died needlessly in Eastern Ukraine. It's time to stop bloody talking about doing something and actually do the right thing.

Grow the fuck up. You're just throwing away all meaning from the word nazis when you just describe everything vaguely right wing as a Nazi.

I will describe two sets of policies:

Policy set 1:
-Tightened immigration to get only people who are skilled and can contribute and integrate

-Lower taxes

-Less money to other nations from German tax payers.

Policy set 2:
-Start the largest war in history to gain more land and power

-Kill millions of people in concentration camps

The R2 Sud line (the one you'll be using) normally stays for some minutes in Sants Estació (from Estació de França it's 2 stations away) when it's going from Castelldefels to Barcelona due to ""dense"" traffic in Passeig de Gràcia (the station between Estació de França and Sants Estació), and going from Barcelona to Castelldefels the same usually happens before arriving to Passeig de Gràcia. If this problem didn't exist, then the train would take about 33-34 minutes, so about 40 minutes is quite accurate (when the trains are working well, of course).

All the Rodalies/Cercanías (the name for ""close-range"" trains) that go through Castelldefels go to Barcelona, but not all of them go to Estació de França. There are 2 trains each half hour that will suit you, and 1 train that won't. In the morning though (from 7AM to 9AM approximately), there are a few more trains that go to Estació de França as well. 

Even though you didn't ask but /u/Estre mentioned the money issue, as of today the price for the T-10 ticket (10 rides) you'll need is 10.30€. Each time you use the ticket once, you have 1h and 15 minutes if I remember correctly as transfer time to take other transportation methods such as metro or bus (once you get to Barcelona, for example). It is safe to say that you'll need 4 of this per month if you're not moving through Barcelona regularly. If you'll be using more transportation other than the train ride, other options are:

- T-50/30: 50 rides max during 30 days (42.50€)

- T-Mes: unlimited rides during 30 days (52.75€)

- T-Trimestre: unlimited rides during 90 days (142€)

- T-Jove: unlimited rides during 90 days only if you're 24 or younger (105€)

Eh, I'd say Pearl Harbor wouldn't have happened if America hadn't imposed oil sanctions on Japan. Germany itself never attacked the US mainland, there were just subs in front of the east coast taking out supply ships you were sending to the British.

&gt; You, and many on this sub, ignore European meddling when it suits you, which is often. 

I'm not. 

&gt; Germany and France built Saddam Hussein's chemical production and continued supplying him after serious questions arose as to how he was using it. 

You mean to produce weapons of mass destruction? Do you still believe that lie? 

The fuck did Saddam do, anyway? Oh, yes, right, attacking Kuweit. After attacking, on American orders, Iran, and not getting anything out of it. Iran, of course, was to be attacked because the local American proconsul, Shah Pahlavi, just got ousted. Bush Senior thus started the Gulf war, which was a joke, then left Iraq be, again. Then Bush Junior comes along, sees Iraq, and pretty much says ""hey we should bomb that for some reason. I don't know, make one up"".

Kuweit's a dictatorship just like the rest down there, anyway. He just made the mistake of attacking a US proconsul, which revoked his status as a proconsul.

America always likes to say ""we're for human rights, he was a monster"". Yeah but if you'd really select your targets like that, the list would look much differently.

But you're right. We can, say, talk about Heckler&amp;Koch weapons in at least two dozen countries where they shouldn't be.

Troops are being deployed in the east. Don't know what else to do really. American and Canadian troops, EU's soldiers, NATO troops etc. And these countries aren't exactly weak themselves. That's good enough for me, given the circumstances.


Ruling out a direct confrontation with Russia, the only option is of course economic war, which again means we're on the right track. In my opinion, if there's something the Ukraine could do it's to realize the eastern parts will be lost, or at least contested for a long period of time. Russia has troops but not money. Grind the damned place into dust. Blow up bridges, roads, infrastructure. Poison wells. ""Scorched earth"" them - like Russia itself use to do to their enemies. Let them take over nothing. See how Russian public reacts to glorious leader spending billions on building and improving an essentially worthless swath of land to ""save face"", instead of improving their own villages/industries; this while the west tightens the thumb-screws. Unlike a military conflict, that war is actually ""winnable"", to some extent (but of course we all still loose..).


So, economic war is good. Russia is super poor and weak economically, but what makes it a bit tougher is they're backed by countries like for example India and China. Probably Iran? They likely see this as an opportunity to gain influence and weaken US/Europe. They obviously don't care what happens to Ukraine (the way Russia do), so it will certainly be possible (although costly) to make deals, should Russia take things too far. Most likely they would want less US presence in the region. Question here is what we'd have to give up, and also - since the US would likely be the ""giver uppers"" in this case - would they be willing to do it?

But the thing is there's ALWAYS some excuse and then it moves onto the next thing. Heres a sample of the excuses and get outs I've heard since November last year in roughly chronological order.

""Oh Yanukovych isnt our guy"" 
""oh the proetestors are killing themselves"" 
""oh the protestors are fascists""
""we're beating the protestors""
""the americans supported the protestors with weapons and mercenaries""
""ok they didnt, but the protestors are definitely fascists""
""Spontaneous revolution in Crimea!""
""Ok maybe not""
""oh look little green men""
""no they arent russian you fascist""
""ok they might be russian volunteers""
""ok they were Russian Army""

et al et al Every single time the ""secret western conspiracy"" crowd keep getting proved laughably wrong they just seem to double down on conspiracy theories and conjecture. 



Basically You claim you cant believe anything the west says, except what they've said has been admitted by putin himself two weeks later. Its only stupid people on the internet and the Putin Puffers who actually believe anything he says anymore. Its like the Boy who cried wolf, the people who are still coming even when the boy himself admits there was no wolf are not ""seeing through the truth"" they're just gullible.

And on the tanks thing. Dude (if we're going to use over-familiar language to try and sound un-mental) I bet I can find an article that says the Ukranian army have killed 6 million people from the backs of flaming unicorns if i look through enough russian blogs. That guy is an ANALYST, not even representing an institution. I could pay an analyst to say that Israel is in Ukraine on the russian side if I needed it to look good in the press.

* ""Cheese"": well there's lots of it everywhere, but that region (although a bit south of where the word ""Cheese"" is, more like west of Switzerland) is where Comté and other cheeses of the same type are made (such as French Emmental, which we grate and put on fucking everything)

* ""Football"": Olympique Lyonnais vs AS Saint-Etienne is one of the biggest rivalries in French football, and they're historically big teams (ASSE is the only team to have won 10 national championships, mostly in the 70s, and OL completely dominated the '00s with 7 consecutive titles).

* ""Nothing but goats"": that's a lie, there are sheep too in [Larzac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larzac), how else would they make Roquefort?

* ""French hats"": bérets come from there (we actually call the most known type of béret ""béret basque"", although there are other types such as ""béret landais"" which is much wider)

* ""Cheap cigarettes"": that's for Andorra.

* ""Plus belle la vie"": a TV show set in Marseille.

true,ax8l,ANAR,Government-less Romania,"This is just speculation, but after the revolution the Hungarian ethnics suddenly started to create more and more conflicts with the Romanian minority until they actually took the sign that said ""Pharmacy"" in Romanian and replaced it with the Hungarian equivalent, after that they started to refuse Romanian clients service and things went downhill from here (romanian started attacking hungarian shops, the hungarians started destroying romanian ones etc).

But even before all of this happened an Irish reporter (somewhat specialized in inter-ethnic conflicts) came and booked a room 2 days prior to the conflicts, in a hotel that is near where the actual street fights happened. When he got to the hotel (again 2 days prior of the conflicts) he asked a room with windows facing the street and the key to a terrace where he installed his video equipment.

It is believed that the reporter got a tip from someone in Scotland yard that intercepted Hungarian secret service  plans about this semi-revolution or was sent there by someone that already knew what was going to happen.

After the Romanian was killed and the attack filmed by the Irish man he reported to the whole world that the Romanian killed is a Hungarian and that the Romanians are savage beasts that want to annihilate all Magyar people. Thus spurring a significant contingent of Hungarians from Hungary to come in Targu Mures to help with the ""battles"".

Later one it was discovered that the Irish reported was actually paid by an Hungarian producer to come to Romania.

Also, after the incidents a biased documentary (this was is? seen as the go to documentary for the 1990 incidents) was made by the same television which was sponsored by the Hungarian government this time (this documentary only presented that point of view of Hungarian people and no Romanian was present or interview for it).

After the documentary Romanian's image was tarnished and the country was depicted as savages that want to kill Hungarians, the main promoters of this campaign being Gyula Horn, then the external affairs minister, Laszlo Tokes and Geza Entz.

What Hungary really wanted was to do what Russia is doing now, but because the Romanian institutions and leaders were so scared about an invasion (helped by the other states) they asked the army to block any Romanians coming into Targu Mures but let all Hungarians pass, which lead to Hungarians being ""the winners"" in the conflict and the critical situation started to become more manageable.

Fast alle ihrer Kritikpunkte zerfallen eigentlich, wenn man die Sache mal rational betrachtet. Besonders schlimm sind die letzten zwei Videos.

Sie kritisiert ja z.B., dass weibliche NPCs als Hintergrunddekoration herhalten müssen aber das ist doch gerade der Zweck von NPCs, egal ob männlich oder weiblich. NPCs sind *immer* Hintergrunddeko, sie sollen die Welt belebt erscheinen lassen, ohne irgendwie großartig Interaktionsmöglichkeiten zu bieten. Was wäre hier also die Lösung? Sollen weibliche NPC's nun entfernt werden?

Das selbe gilt für die Kritik, dass unbeteiligte/unschuldige weibliche NPCs angegriffen werden können. In Spielen in denen der Spieler NPCs angreifen kann können sowohl männliche als auch weibliche NPCs angegriffen werden. Sollen NPCs nun unverwundbar/unangreibar sein weil sie weibliche Personen darstellen?

Sie kritisiert ja auch, dass NPCs sexualisiert dargestellt werden, und hier sehe ich auch das größte Potential für gerechtfertigte Kritik, nur vermasselt sie das Ganze wieder bei der Umsetzung. Fast alle Spiele die sie als Beispiel anbringt haben irgendwann Levels in denen  Stripclubs/Bordelle vorkommen und in diesem Kontext sind sexualisierte NPCs auch gerechtfertigt, weil in einem Stripclub nunmal leicht bekleidete Damen rumlaufen. Wenn ein Level eine Baustelle beinhaltet, dann erwarte ich auch Bauarbeiter und Polizisten auf einer Polizeistation und so erwarte ich eben auch Stripper in Stripclubs. Sollen Spiele nun keine Orte mehr enthalten in in deren reellem Äquivalent ich ebenfalls sexualisierte Personen erwarte? Das wäre ja nicht sehr progressiv und eher kontraproduktiv.

Ich will garnicht bestreiten, dass vieles in Spielen noch verbessert werden kann, gerade die übersexualiserten Darstellungen mancher Charaktere, aber ich glaube Sarkeesian hat ursprünglich mehr Probleme gesehn als eigentlich da sind und muss nun vieles konstruieren und überdramatisieren um überhaupt auf ihre 12x30min Videos zu kommen.",0,1409659058,null,0,false,0,ck709qy,t3_2f6hmr,t1_ck709qy,t3_2f6hmr,null,1427243044,4,false,de,t5_22i0,4

true,h4r13q1n,null,null,"Both the Chancellor and the President of Germany have experienced soviet rule first hand in the ""German Democratic Republic"", former East Germany. They showed a big deal of restrain in the last weeks in a situation that without doubt must bother them in a very personal way - Russia's return to soviet-era politics.

They've been criticized for that restrain, maybe rightfully so. They deemed it to be reason of state to keep the diplomatic doors wide open, but I'm sure they found more blunt words in private and found it sometimes hard to stay diplomatic in this development [that hits so close to home](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uprising_of_1953_in_East_Germany).

The fact that a large part of Germany was under Russia's rule for decades makes it's relationship towards Russia unique in Western Europe, another reason for Berlins hesitancy.

However, in the recent days the tone from Berlin changed the more it became clear that Russian forces are in direct combat with the Ukrainian military. Keeping [Merkels history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvSA82z6Dig) in mind we can assume that she can be pretty rigorous against Russia once she has everybody lined up at home. This is important in German politics, that is hugely dependent on finding consent between a variety of political and economic interest groups. 

And of course Berlins' reluctance was dictated by economic interest groups. But now yesterday Merkel said that Germany is ready to accept economic losses in further sanctions, and that was a pretty strong message that didn't come out of nowhere. There very likely was a dispute behind closed doors beforehand with certain lobbyists, with Merkel throwing some equivalent of aerial photographs on the table and saying something along the lines of: ""Here, they're attacking directly now. And the Ukrainian forces are pretty much done. Russia is bringing the war back to Europe. So, *meine Herren*, we'll do whatever is necessary, and it's time to talk about how to dampen the effect on the German economy.""

What you linked is no way relevant. And if you are fond of lying, let's remember how the citizens of UK are lied to about the EU.

&gt;The Ukrainians can do what they want, but they cannot expect to join the EU and have their independence secured in the long-term.

The international treaties that the EU is based on have to be accepted by member states and they clearly state the limits and powers of the EU. The EU secures as much independence as the Lisbon Treaty secures. The Lisbon Treaty defines the limits of the EU. In it's current form, the Lisbon Treaty *does* secure the independence of nations. If the Lisbon treaty is modified, it has to be signed by all member states to come into effect. If Ukraine signs a treaty that abolishes their independence, it is the choice of Ukraine. If Ukraine or any other member state opposes the modifications, they will not sign it, and the treaty does not come into force.

&gt;Although, to be fair to them, the EU is better than Russia, if only because the EU gives you a decade or two to prepare.

EU doesn't invade other countries, killing other counties citizens and forcibly annex parts of other countries. EU gives the states the right to decide themselves whether to join or leave the EU and the right to decide whether to ratify or overrule the modifications of the Lisbon Treaty.

What it seems is that you don't even know how the EU operates, but rather that you have believed some general anti-EU stuff from the yellow press that has nothing to do with the actual workings of the European Union. You have so much irrational disdain towards the EU that you completely ignored that this post was not in any way about the EU, but about the Russian invasion, but you just *couldn't* use the opportunity to vomit your opinions about things that are no way relevant to the original post.

No, you're right. The EU doesn't do that. It just sends the countries of Southern Europe to the wall to prevent inflation in the North, causing huge amounts of suffering in those lands and now of course the Northern European states are sliding into deflation.

The Lisbon Treaty does now, but will that remain for the long-term? Probably not, given the trends of closer integration and greater centralisation seen as the *only* solution. If the Ukrainians want to keep independence, they really should join NATO and the EEA, but not the EU.

&gt; Plusieurs versions du scénario ont été élaborées entre 1998 et 2008, deux demandes d’aide ont été formulées auprès du compte de soutien au CNC en 2000 et 2006.
&gt; Une structure de production a été créée pour porter le projet de film, un récapitulatif des plans et séquences a été réalisé en juin 2006, des essais pellicules ont été réalisés.
&gt; 
&gt; Des démarches ont été entreprises auprès de diffuseurs, distributeurs et producteurs, dont la société de Monsieur Alain Chabat « Chez Wam » en 2008.
&gt; J’ai été présenté à la mère de madame Bérénice Béjo en 2008, gestionnaire immobilière avec qui nous avons signé un bail à cette adresse.
&gt; 
&gt; En 2009, je demande à Madame Béjo-mère d’informer son autre fille, Mademoiselle Moïra Grassi, actrice professionnelle inconnue du grand public, que nous souhaiterions lui faire passer des essais le moment venu et que celle-ci veuille bien nous faire parvenir son DVD de démo. Il finira par arriver après plusieurs mois puis sera réclamé un peu plus tard.
&gt; 
&gt; Peu de temps après, j’apprends avec consternation que Monsieur Michel Hazanavicius entre en production d’un film présentant les mêmes caractéristiques et informe aussitôt la mère de Madame Bérénice Béjo de mon inquiétude.
&gt; 
&gt; Tandis que la production de ‘The Artist’ s’active, je suis confronté à deux drames personnels qui reportent aussitôt mon action autour de ce conflit.
&gt; La projection à Cannes révèle que le film de Monsieur Hazanavicius contient de nombreuses ressemblances incontestables.
&gt; 
&gt; Un dossier a été constitué. Il contient notamment les preuves d’antériorité et le comparatif.
&gt; A titre d’exemples : rencontre fortuite des personnages principaux au travers d’une ouverture dans un mur, cauchemar, désaccords sur l’avenir entre producteur et artiste, homme réduit, échec commercial d’un film dans le film, scènes de danse, tentative de suicide, hospitalisation, homme désespéré sauvé par l’amour d’une femme…
&gt; 
&gt; Nous avons constaté une trentaine de points de convergences entres mon scénario et celui de THE ARTIST.
&gt; 
&gt; Début 2013, le bureau de Madame la Ministre de la Culture Aurélie Filippetti est prévenu et répond « comprendre » ma position mais ne « pas pouvoir intervenir dans une affaire qui concerne des particuliers ».

2) RuFed wasn't created by will of its population but rather as a chunk of bigger structure and by will of corrupted bureaucrats, it does not have too much support among population (up to suppressed civil wars in Caucasus region, brewing separatism movements across whole country including regions populated by Russians) and with some pressure (see 1) ) won't survive next deep crisis in single piece. 

Good news: Russian Federation does not operate as single country, but rather as a set of multiple separate quasi-states which have less integration than countries in EU - for example to move between regions ~~you~~ citizens need passport *and visa on arrival* (without such visa there will be troubles with job search and local police) - so fall will be almost ""painless"", just like it happened with 1991 with USSR.

Your metaphor is obviously flawed.

The guy you claim wants to “burn the house down” isn't just some random guy from the street, he's the co-owner of the house. He doesn't want to burn the house down, he wants to wall apart his part of the house from the other guy's part, following a disagreement in which both parties wanted to assert their control over the entire house.

It just so happens that both parties are supported by their resepective neighbors, who themselves have been waving their dicks at each other for quite a long time now. Also, one of the neighbors is a really close relative of one of the co-owners of the house.

One guy wants to stop the other guy from building a wall, because he feels he is stronger and without the wall could more easily control the other guy. All the while the neighbor of the guy who wants to build the wall is supporting him because his part of the house is really nice and appealing.

Even this is an oversimplification, but it's far more accurate than yours.

There is a clear political, and somewhat blurrier cultural and ethnic divide between Western and Eastern Ukraine, and the rebels in the East aren't all imports from Russia. The overwhelming majority of them lived in those areas their entire lives.

Giving autonomy to a part of Eastern Ukraine, instead of continuing the mutual killing seems like a reasonable compromise between the two parties. It might not be as effective as exterminating the entirety of either of them, but it is obviously a much fairer and just solution to the conflict.

true,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"Yes. I agree. That's what I said. Normal only implies it is not the most common activity, the mode, a type of average. When used in that sense, it is not a blue judgement though. It's an objective measurement. Whitr Europeans are neither the modal race nor the modal ethnicity. They are abnormal. That isn't to imply they are inferior to other ethnicities, just that they are not the most common. I would accept the use of the word abnormal, in that sense, being used to describe non-heterosexuality. 


That said, people use abnormal as a value judgement of the activity. Merely being the least common thing does not make it inferior or unworthy or inappropriate but people use abnormal to mean that it does. A less contentious example might be that I am abnormal, as a Brit, in that I prefer coffee to tea. I'm not somehow less worthy because of that, I shouldn't switch merely to fit in, yet your sense of the word abnormal would imply that perhaps I should drink tea even though I prefer coffee. 

Another sense is that it is unnatural. It is used to mean that it does not occur in nature and therefore we shouldn't do it. The converse does not follow. No one claims that 'it occurs in nature, therefore we should do it' is logical. It is not. Eating shit is natural yet bad for us, spreads disease, and will make you sick, unwell, and will make you sick. It is on those grounds that I oppose eating shit. 

Im not defending homosexuality on the grounds that it is natural, or normal, or immoral. I'm defending it on the grounds that there's no good reason 'why not'. 

In free societies you should be able to do whatever you want to yourself or others or other property unless a good reason can be presented as to 'why not'. 

There is no good reason why people should not engage in homosexuality activity. There are plenty of good reason why they should engage in necrophilia, pedophilia, eating shit, vandalism, honocide and so on. 

You seem to be arguing that I should have to justify NY activities before doing them. They is false and contrary to the principles of civil liberties as we understsnd them. When it is said homosexuality is not the most common activity, that's not a good reason since lots of abnormal things are allowed.  When it is said it is unnatural, that's not a good reason because homosexuality is natural. Even if it were unnatural, which it isn't and is to say is a product only of mankind not found elsewhere, it still wouldn't be a good since other unnatural things are allowed e.g. the internet.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; In your initial point you reduced the issue on the topic of oil/gas imports, which is supposed to cause what you perceive as german inaction.

My point from the beginning is that talk is not action, and that talk has no meaning as it is being used. Perhaps somewhere people began to associate silence on an issue with approval of it, and thus to feel the need to comment. That's the very nature of PR: needing to somehow convey a position on a subject without having to concern oneself with the consequences of taking a position, and this is achieved by releasing statements with little to no actual substance. It is *because* this is the case that I disregard public statements and look at actions. 

&gt; The talks to the public are just to comment the directions of their actions are taking right now.

No, I argue that they feel a need or an obligation to comment publicly, but actually *cannot* do so in a way which is a binding commitment, unless the purpose of the statement is directly to communicate an intent. Those kinds of statements are often formal releases and not comments made by leaders. 

&gt; You may think that these actions are insufficient and a lot of people would agree with you

I think these things because if I look past the statements and reported conversations between leaders, precisely *two* actions have happened. Both of these rounds of sanctions have been deliberately designed in such a way as to protect domestic economies. There is a war in Ukraine that is dragging on, and which could already have been concluded if not for direct Russian intervention. The kinds of penalties which could have made further encroachment of Ukraine too costly to consider could have been implemented after Crimea, and before all of the other tragedies in this conflict occurred. This particular slow implementation in fact seems to be part of the Russian strategy when decisions are made. 

&gt; but if you solely name natural ressources as reasons for the intensity of german interventions in this conflict and brush away the cultural and historical ones you're being intelectually dishonest

This is the part of your comment that I find to be the *most* interesting. Germany (and Chancellor Merkel) and most other European nations have not forgotten either Soviet occupation or the outcome of the Doctrine of Appeasement. I could make the argument that Germany and the former USSR satellite states should have acted decisively to push the Russians back out of Crimea when it first occurred, precisely because they know from experience what happens after hesitating. It is illogical and cognitively dissonant to refrain from warfare when it is that restraint itself which is likely to result in it. It don't consider that the Germans have overlooked increasing Russian involvement in any of the territories of its neighbors (Georgia et al) over the last few years. I would expect them to be more vigilant of this fact than other Western European nations, much the way that Poland, Lithuania, and Finland are. 

My point as such was that the reason for the divergence in behaviour between these nations is that Germany has something to lose. [Here](http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/energy-and-resources/eu-moves-to-reduce-energy-dependency-on-russia-1.1733830?page=1) is a very basic article about oil and gas reliance, and how the crisis in Crimea caused a rush to rethink reliance on Russia. It takes a history of bad behaviour to make a country decide to end its reliance upon another--not just a once off act--and it was my position that real effective discouragement didn't happen because Europe realised it's own vulnerability to the results of those actions. 

&gt; In my oppinion you should either try to take a look at the whole picture or limit yourself to only comment on the actions.

I hope I've shown you that I did in fact do that very thing. I'm just not willing to read more into what I think is a reluctance to take the decisive steps to end the conflict than is immediately apparent. I don't want to look to find deeper motives when such is unneeded. In fact, I think it's a bit disingenuous to try as u/New-Atlantis did to try and make this about history and politics alone. The Germans, and those more reliant upon Russian gas/oil than they are, know exactly what will happen if Gazprom shuts the taps off. It's just that some of those nations are more worried about being invaded than trying to find another fuel source. 

&gt; It also seems to me that while you're disregarding public statements you just seem to wait for stronger ones.

Actually I'm *tired* of hearing public statements and rhetoric. I'm waiting for the West to do something and take what is the only step that will end this conflict, and that is to cripple the Russian economy such that it cannot fight and/or Putin must fight for his own political survival at home.

true,vlepun,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; There are no laws that say that other NATO have to retaliate or consider that an attack.

Really?

&gt; **Article 5**

&gt;The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.

&gt;Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security .

&gt; **Article 6 (1)**

&gt; For the purpose of Article 5, an armed attack on one or more of the Parties is deemed to include an armed attack:

&gt; * on the territory of any of the Parties in Europe or North America, on the Algerian Departments of France (2), on the territory of or on the Islands under the jurisdiction of any of the Parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer;

&gt; *   on the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of the Parties, when in or over these territories or any other area in Europe in which occupation forces of any of the Parties were stationed on the date when the Treaty entered into force or the Mediterranean Sea or the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer.

[Source for further reading.](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm)

In short, an attack by an external party on a member of NATO, will lead to that member invoking article 5 and thus, as a consequence, will be treated as an attack on all members of NATO.

true,TelevisionAntichrist,UNSA,Bad since 1776,"WTC7: Uncontrolled fires caused the thermal expansion of steel floor beams and structural girders. This led: 

&gt;to a chain of events that caused a key structural column to fail. The failure of this structural column then initiated a fire-induced progressive collapse of the entire building.

&gt;According to the report's probable collapse sequence, heat from the uncontrolled fires caused thermal expansion of the steel beams on the lower floors of the east side of WTC 7, damaging the floor framing on multiple floors.

&gt;Eventually, a girder on Floor 13 lost its connection to a critical column, Column 79, that provided support for the long floor spans on the east side of the building (see Diagram 1). The displaced girder and other local fire-induced damage caused Floor 13 to collapse, beginning a cascade of floor failures down to the 5th floor. Many of these floors had already been at least partially weakened by the fires in the vicinity of Column 79. This collapse of floors left Column 79 insufficiently supported in the east-west direction over nine stories.

&gt;The unsupported Column 79 then buckled and triggered an upward progression of floor system failures that reached the building's east penthouse. What followed in rapid succession was a series of structural failures. Failure first occurred all the way to the roof line-involving all three interior columns on the easternmost side of the building (79, 80, 81). Then, progressing from east to west across WTC 7, all of the columns failed in the core of the building (58 through 78). Finally, the entire façade collapsed.

true,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"It does, in fact, make sense in English. There are two problems I have with this most-recent post of yours: the first is that it presents a strawman fallacy; and the second is that it uses that strawman fallacy to then dismiss the rest of the post and ignore the burden of proof placed on you. 

The strawman fallacy is that you're subtly presenting my argument about accuracy and precision in a different light than it was meant. You are asserting that accurate and precise are synonymous but that is only true about to a point, that point being that only some of the meanings of accurate are synonymous with precise. By stating 'if imprecise', those meanings were excluded. Therefore I was not stating 'precise and imprecise' but, rather, 'correct but imprecise'. 

An analogous situation might be you asking me 'where are you from?' only to receive the response 'Earth'. That's accurate, I am from Earth, but it's not precise. 

Moving on. Let us assume that you didn't just experience an ESL problem and, in fact, were correct about accurate and imprecise being exactly synonymous, you still haven't shown why it is wrong to say 'European Countries' when referring to the EU as a group. My summary of my justification might have been wrong but there was still a longer and correct justification above it. If it's so 'obvious' that my reasoning is wrong then it shouldn't present a problem for you to show me how it is wrong. If you can do that, I'll let it lay.

Anyway, not for you but more just to post, my gut feeling on the collapse of a building: If one floor of a building high above the ground collapses, the floor underneath it either collapses instantaneously, or doesn't collapse at all. It seems to me, that it is *not* the case, that the floor underneath would stay firm for a half of a second, or a second, or whatever small fraction of time - if it is going to collapse. *Especially* if those floors are connected to the same column/girder system which caused the failure of the first floor in the first place.

true,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"I looked up the 'nationalisation' of retirement funds because it seemed a little odd that the Government would do such a thing and have a positive cash flow as a result (nationalisation implies buying the government buying an asset). 

I found [this article](http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2014/05/27/polands-deficit-to-fall-in-2014-as-economy-accelerates-says-finance-minister/) in the WSJ. 

The relevent section is this:
&gt;The finance ministry estimates the annual public finance gap could be 0.2-0.3 percentage point lower should more Poles than expected choose to move to the state pension vehicle rather than to keep their assets at private companies. The government this year redeemed its bonds managed by the private companies in an effort to cut debt, and gave pensioners the right to abandon the mandatory private pension scheme altogether.

&gt;The government originally expected a half of about 16.7 million Poles saving on privately managed pension accounts to keep them rather than move to the state vehicle. As of mid-May, only about 100,000 have chosen to keep the private element of their pension schemes. They have until the end of July to make decisions.

What is the rationale behind this? I can somewhat understand why the people would want their pension to be backed by the State rather than private companies which can go bust but why would the Polish Government take on those liabilities? It seems like the opposite of what most governments are doing. 

The UK, for example, is gradually forcing people to take up a Private Pension which will supplement their state pension. This is on long-term grounds of affordability and to increase the savings ratio as well as a whole host of other reason. My initial thought was that it could be a State-owned, but independently operated, pension provider, but that wouldn't explain why the deficit had gone down. 

If the deficit is going down, does that not imply that the Government is spending the pension funds rather than keeping them aside to fund the future liabilities? In which case, that seems like an incredibly fiscally irresponsibly thing for the Polish Government to be doing, considering the demographic problems Poland will be experiencing in the near future.

I posted this thing over at /r/soccer but I figured you guys would also appreciate it.

I first got this idea during the World Cup when I made [a fictional World Cup Division I](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/292ula/what_if_there_was_a_fifa_division_i_world_cup/) along with a [Division II World Cup](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/293ma0/since_making_division_i_world_cup_was_such_fun_i/). 

Later on I decided to try a similar thing on a club level and being from Slovenia, I made [a 24-team league from ex-Yugoslav nations](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2dqfer/i_made_a_list_of_the_24_teams_that_would_make_it/). Since I had a lot of fun in the process and decided to make some more.

24 teams seemed like a bit much so for my next project I opted for 16-team leagues. What I did was, I took the [UEFA country coefficients](http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/index.html) for the 2013/14 season to determine the number of spots every nation gets. The number of clubs from each nation is a result of math and I had nothing to do with the decision which teams got a chance to participate. Clubs qualified through their 2013/14 domestic league result. All clubs and flags are in alphabetical order.

Some leagues are simply geographically based, some are taken from various political organizations ([GUAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUAM_Organization_for_Democracy_and_Economic_Development), [V4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visegr%C3%A1d_Group)...). I tried to include as many nations as possible (sorry Turkey, Armenia, Israel...) excluding the top leagues 'cause I just thought it wouldn't make much sense to make some Franco-German league or sth. But I am open to suggestions and will be happy to create a league of your choosing :)

Give me your thoughts on who'd win and who'd be relegated. What do you think, could these leagues succeed irl?

&gt;Youth Unemployment Rate is the ratio between Unemployed 15-24 Year olds to the Labour Force of 15-24 Year Olds. 

&gt;Youth Unemployment Ratio is the ratio between Unemployment 15-24 Year Olds and the Population of 15-24 Year Olds. 

We're looking at the former. 

The difference between the Labour Force and the Population are those who are economically inactive i.e. those youths who are not employed but also not looking to take up a job.

Largely this comes from the large number who are in education, though not all who are in education are economically inactive. They are not mutually exclusive. They state the three most common cases for overlap between the categories, in their methodology, for this age range are:

&gt;1) Being an Apprentice or a Student with a Part Time Job.
&gt;2) A Student who is looking for a job but does not have one
&gt;3) A Student who is not looking for a job. 

Case one counts as being employed, two as unemployed, and three as economically inactive. Those who fall in to the third category are the ones responsible for the difference between the unemployment rate and the unemployment ratio (though of course others contribute too, such as those outside education and are without a job and not looking for one (economically discouraged)).

TL;DR IF you are between 15-24, and are without a job but looking for one,  then you are counted as being unemployed.

&gt;

&gt;__Steven Patrick Morrissey__ (born 22 May 1959), commonly known by his last name, __Morrissey__, is an English singer and lyricist. He rose to prominence in the 1980s as the lyricist and vocalist of the band [the Smiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smiths). The band was highly successful in the United Kingdom but broke up in 1987, and Morrissey began a solo career, making the top ten of the [UK Singles Chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart) on ten occasions. His first solo album, 1988's *[Viva Hate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_Hate)*, entered the [UK albums chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_albums_chart) at number one.

&gt;He is widely regarded as an important innovator in the [indie music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_music) scene;  music magazine *[NME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME)* considers Morrissey to be ""one of the most influential artists ever"", while *[The Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent)* says, ""Most pop stars have to be dead before they reach the iconic status he has reached in his lifetime.""  In 2004, [Pitchfork Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitchfork_Media) called him ""one of the most singular figures in Western popular culture from the last 20 years."" 

&gt;Morrissey's lyrics have been described as ""dramatic, bleak, funny [vignettes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignette_(literature\)) about doomed relationships, lonely nightclubs, the burden of the past and the prison of the home"".  He is also noted for his unusual [baritone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baritone) vocal style (though he sometimes uses [falsetto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsetto)),  his [quiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiff) haircut and his dynamic live performances. Media controversies have been caused by his forthright and often [contrarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrarian) opinions, and he has also attracted media attention for his advocacy of [vegetarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism) and [animal rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights).  He describes himself in his autobiography as an animal protectionist.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Id rather continue the talks than provoke Russia to do even worse things

What makes you think that these talks matter at all to the Russians? Maybe the West thinks it can come to an amicable settlement, but so far there has only ever been one goal of the Russians: total political dominance of Ukraine. This isn't a trade negotiation. There are two solutions: Russia takes its troops and leaves Ukraine, separatists lay down arms and engage in *political* talks with Kiev and they sort the matter out internally. Or, Russia is forced to withdraw it's troops, the separatists are defeated and/or arrested, and Kiev goes back to trying to rebuild the country. Russia has no intent to give up any part of Ukraine: either the part it *invaded* and annexed, or the part it is *invading* now and will split off from Western Ukraine. The deliberate fragmentation of Ukraine by Russia is not an acceptable solution, not in the least for nations who believe in the rule of law. 

&gt; Russia is desperate in not wanting to have the NATO as its neighbor which is understandble because the EU doesn't want Russia as its direct neighbor

No, it's not understandable. Every nation has a right to enter into treaties and agreements such as it wishes. And you forget that NATO was created *because* of Russia--the nations who are in closest proximity to Russia have the most reason to join. Clearly, if Ukraine or any nation sharing a border with Russia, or who were once Soviet wish to live free from the fear of surreptitious invasion, NATO is their best choice. Also the EU is not being expansionist; nations are freely applying for membership. They aren't being coerced. Russia, however, is being expansionist.

&gt; So it would be cool to solve this conflict so that both parties don't use Ukraine as its military base against the other.

Russia is trying to turn Ukraine into a puppet state against the West as a buffer. Ukraine is fighting for its sovereignty, which is being undermined externally. There is a big difference between a political process to consider secession within a nation internally, and participating in a war against a state both internally and externally, in order to achieve a political result. It wasn't right in earlier years when the US did it, and it's not right now. Ukraine has a right to build its own nation, to have its own military, to treat with the EU/NATO as desired, and even to treat with Russia. Russia does not have a right to make those decisions for Ukraine, either at the barrel of a gun, or at a negotiating table. 

It would be cool to solve this conflict if Europe started to stand up for the ideals it claims it has. By all means keep talking. Apply hard sanctions, and talk about how normal civilised relationships can resume if normal civil behaviour resumes.

I don't agree that saying 'European Countries' is wrong in this case because it is still a good selection. (It would also be acceptable to use if this exact same number of countries were being used but they weren't all EU members). There are 59 countries listed as being European on Wikipedia. If we discount the overseas territories, crown dependencies, autonomous regions, microstates, and such like entities, it's closer to 47. If you count all of them, you're giving data on 46% of the countries in Eurpe. If you only count the large and/or sovereign ones, you're looking at closer to 57%; that's a good selection by my reckoning. 

The analogous situation you're drawing with the world is not a very good one. All countries that are currently known to us are on the world. Saying 'world' countries doesn't actually add any extra information so it's a waste of a word. 

In any case, if you're going to try and correct someone or call them out, you better make damn sure that they are wrong. That goes for both you and the OP.

- once you get the permit, you need to buy the gun fast or that permit will expire.

- you then have 10 days to go to your local police precinct and register the weapon

- it is illegal to own more than 100 bullets at one time. You can buy 100, shoot them, buy another 100.

Federal gun restrictions in the US are very lax. There's no national registry or background checks. Most guns are completely legal to own. The exception to this is automatic weapons. Any automatic weapons created after 1986 is illegal, and anything made before then is taxed to a massive degree and does require lots of checks and special permissions. Generally speaking, a lot of the remaining stock is owned by firing ranges and things like that. The other big exception is to modifying your own guns. Converting a semiautomatic weapon to an automatic is illegal (and the manufacturers can also get in trouble if they make it easy to convert). This leads to odd situations like  a piece of string getting identified as a machine gun. No, really. http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/2/gun-makers-baffled-by-atf-criteria/?page=all It's also illegal to do things like cut down a gun's barrel below a certain length, and other boring things like that.

The states meanwhile are generally more strict, though their laws are all over the place. Many states *do* require background checks and waiting periods, and also limit the caliber and magazine size of the weapons you can buy. Some states even still hold to the old Assault Weapons Ban criteria. 

Of course, some states don't. There are a few states where it's actually legal to just walk up to someone on the street and just buy their gun in cash. This means that, no matter how strict one state gets, the law is really only as strict as the weakest link.

true,Beck2012,POLA,Kraków/Zakopane,"What is the rationale? ""The system is wrong and people won't get enough money from it"" - that's true, OFE wasn't an efficient system (too much money was going to funds), but that meant, that it should have been repaired, not dismantled. There was a lot of propaganda talk about it - ""OFE gives only XXX PLN, that's ridiculously low!"" (while it being a small amount is true, it's mainly because its share in whole retirement was very low - nationalization changed the amount by few zlotys, not enough to rationalize nationalization itself, and it was the main argument).

The real reason is the fact, that Polish national retirement fund is bankrupt. And shitty, pretty much as every public institution in this country. They needed money fast - mainly to avoid collapse in few years. The second reason is our debt. Our constitution includes article, that restricts the size of our debt. Current government doubled our debt and we were close to reaching the unconstitutional amount - 60% of our GDP (according to some researchers our debt is around 200%, it depends on the methodology), which would mean some kind of Polish version of government shutdown.

Our constitution and fiscal politics after the fall of communism were based on principles of fiscal responsibility - current government changed it drastically (they were considered fiscal conservatives few years ago). One might argue, that it led to limiting the slowdown caused by crisis - and it's true, we burried every loss with public spending (we were lucky thatwe got EU structural funds, also EURO 2012 has helped a lot). But when the money that was possible to spend this way had been already spent, they decided to nationalize retirement funds. And then they admitted that retirements in Poland are a joke, and there is nothing they are willing to do about it (famous tape scandal).",0,1409671925,null,0,false,0,ck74u7s,t3_2f8uz8,t1_ck74u7s,t1_ck72znf,null,1427240913,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Mon nom est Christophe Valdenaire. Je suis l’auteur d’un scénario long métrage intitulé ‘TIMIDITY, La Symphonie du Petit Homme’, (**muet, noir et blanc, hommage au cinéma, époque de la transition muet/parlant** )

Original ? Ma foi, oui - du moins jusqu'à la sortie de The Artist, eheh.

Mais vous sélectionnez soigneusement vos citations, du moins s'agissant de la première, et tout stratégiquement : 

&gt; rencontre fortuite des personnages principaux ***au travers d’une ouverture dans un mur***

C'est déjà plus compliqué, hein ? 

Il reste que tous ces éléments combinés et faisant scénario par leur simple séquence, si tel est le cas pour les deux films comme le laisse penser Ch. Valdenaire, pointent clairement vers l'hypothèse du plagiat. 

Ajoutez à cela :

&gt; Plusieurs versions du scénario ont été élaborées entre 1998 et 2008, deux demandes d’aide ont été formulées auprès du compte de soutien au CNC en 2000 et 2006.
&gt; Une structure de production a été créée pour porter le projet de film, un récapitulatif des plans et séquences a été réalisé en juin 2006, des essais pellicules ont été réalisés.
&gt; 
&gt; Des démarches ont été entreprises auprès de diffuseurs, distributeurs et producteurs, dont la société de Monsieur Alain Chabat « Chez Wam » en 2008.
&gt; J’ai été présenté à la mère de madame Bérénice Béjo en 2008, gestionnaire immobilière avec qui nous avons signé un bail à cette adresse.

Rien qui ne m'étonne guère en ce qui me concerne : Hazana a de facto fait carrière dans le pastiche (à distinguer, a priori, du plagiat, certes...) :

- *La Classe Américaine (Le Grand Détournement)* : **pastiches**.

- *OSS117* : **pastiches** ; les romans originaux étant eux-même des pastiches à vocation comiques du roman d'espionnage ""sérieux"".

- *The Search* : ***remake*** de... *The Search* (ça ne s'invente pas !), film de Fred Zinnemann, 1948.

Or la logique du pastiche n'est pas très éloignée de celle du... plagiat. De l'un à l'autre, seule l'honnêteté dans la distance de l'auteur trace la ligne de séparation... ""L'auteur"" Hazanavicius... un ""auteur"" au sens de la Nouvelle Vague ? - Pas vraiment, même si l'on s'en tient à seule démarche officielle, donc. Cette originalité dont vous vous faites le chantre très-zélé n'est manifestement pas ce qui caractérise le plus votre cher Hazana'... Au sens le plus fort du terme, en tout cas (*être à l'origine de*, si vous voyez).

&gt; Je peux trouver plus de points communs entre Star Wars et Le Fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain.

Mauvaise foi manifeste, sinon simple mauvais esprit... Enfin, *to be or not to be a fanboy*... 

Bon... les arguments de Christophe Valdenaire étant présentés par lui comme parfaitement vérifiables (les implications de la mère et de la soeur de B. Béjo étant à elles seules passablement destructrices pour la défense, à mon humble avis), la Justice tranchera.

true,intangible-tangerine,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I never take individual polls very seriously, no matter how reputable the polling company, because there's big margins for error. The sample of people asked might be improperly weighted or the questions asked might be loaded. It must just be a funny week, when a particular news event or political speech has influenced people but that effect won't be long term. 

Instead I look at meta-polls (where lots of different polls are taken together and averaged out, to smooth out these errors) and betting odds averages. 

Betting odds are a really useful tool for predictions because the only agenda of the companies making the calculations is that they want to get it right since they lose money if they're wrong. They also get updated much more frequently than political polls since they want to be accurate whenever a bet is made. 

They're not infallible of course, but the House wins more often than not. 

Looking at these meta-polls and betting odds I've haven't seen the 'NO' vote on Scottish independence dip below 50% or 'odds on' (more likely than not) since the referendum was announced,  so for that reason I'm pretty certain that Scotland will vote to stay in the U.K.

**Here's why:**

* All members of the Schengen Agreement (with the exception of Iceland, Greece and Cyprus) border directly other Schengen members, this would allow me, to drive from the southern tip of Spain to the Arctic Circle, without a passport. Iceland, Greece and Cyprus can be gotten to on a plane from other Schengen members without landing in a non-Schengen airport. Australia and New Zealand all require a stop-over beforehand, and the stopover nations would require passports, defeating the purpose of open borders. 

* Canada wouldn't be allowed to join as it has (pretty much in parts) an open border, the US wouldn't want European terrorists to have free access to a country they border and are unable to watch. They would (probably) turn the Canadian border into Mexico 2.0., Canada's economy is reliant on the US (with the US being 78.5% of there imports and 50.6% of there exports) and border checks would hinder industry there.

* The vast majority of other countries in the Commonwealth (with all due respect) are incredibly poor and wouldn't add anything to the Schengen members except 1,000's of extra people on benefits. 

* Most Schengen countries wouldn't want 50 extra members.

* The Commonwealth is British and given that the UK is not in the Schengen they would have no connection with it.

* The Schengen is free movement and this would be useless for a country 1,000s km away when it would be just as easy getting a visa.

Wenn jemand eine abweichende Meinung zu einem bestimmten Thema oder Sachverhalt vertritt und diese auch sachlich begründet, wird er nicht selten mit allen anderen, die diese Meinung auch vertreten in einen Sack geschmissen - auch wenn Übereinstimmung bezüglich anderer Themen möglicherweise gering ist. 

Im allgemeinen wird auch zu viel beurteilt und zu wenig versucht zu verstehen.
Man erlaube mir nur ein Beispiel: 

Der Begriff Neurußland (bzw. Novorossiya) beruht auf einer historischen Bezeichnung für die Region nördlich des Schwarzen Meeres, die im turko-russischen Krieg (1768-1774) von den Russen erobert wurde, die das Ottomanische Reich zurückdrängten. Die leeren Weiten dieses Landes wurden anschließend durch Ansiedlungspolitik der Zarin Katharina der Großen durch Russen, Ukrainer und andere Volksgruppen - übrigens auch Deutsche (mennonitische Siedler aus dem Weichsel-Nogat-Delta) - nach und nach besiedelt (wobei nebenbei auch die Tataren zurückgedrängt wurden). Die demographische Zusammensetzung der Gegend ist im wesentlichen durch diese Zeit bestimmt - je weiter westlich, desto ukrainischer, je weiter östlich, desto russischer, wobei in der Vergangenheit die Herkunft auch keine allzu große Rolle gespielt zu haben scheint.

Um es kurz zu machen: Der Name taucht jetzt wieder als Selbstbezeichnung der Separatisten auf, womit sie sich offensichtlich auf das historische Neurußland beziehen, das dieser Region mehr oder weniger entspricht (wobei das neue Neurußland deutlich kleiner ist). Kaum benutzt Putin jedoch den Begriff, überschreibt Bertholt Kohler seinen Kommentar mit [Putins Traum von „Neurussland“](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/europa/putins-traum-von-neurussland-nicht-nur-gerede-und-geschichte-13128472.html) und hält es für den Beleg von Putins Imperialismusstreben. 

Das Bewerten kommt leider auch hier vor dem Verstehen, denn ehe man Putin oder gar [Zarkhachenko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH35raTPVu8) zuhört, phantasiert man lieber über Putins Motive und psychologisiert.

But coming back to Russia, if you want: Was it really necessary to get intimate with a country that hosts a very significant chunk of Russia's defence industry (hello, Soviet inheritance) that fast? Common decency actually tells us that you should wait for people to break up before you get in bed with any of them, so they have a chance to get their affairs in order without too much drama.

And don't tell me the US -- or, rather, the west, the EU is also very guilty here -- didn't know that eastern Ukraine is full of Russian military contractors. The Ukraine thing isn't the usual haggling about spheres of influence, it's much more serious. And the EU should've known better than to challenge a hard power factor with soft power, it's obvious that things won't limit themselves to soft power in such situations.

And I'm not defending Russia here, just explaining. The consequences of a Ukraine that's west-bound faster than Russia can untangle itself from its industry were predictable by all actors.

En soulevant ce débat et en prenant cette position, elle honore ses promesses de campagne et elle fait ce que l'UMP ou le PS ne font pas ou on peur de faire, elle se place en centre du débat politique. Qu'on vote pour elle ou pas, c'est malin, et c'est utile, parce qu'on a besoin de plus d'informations sur le TTIP.



*On the contrary, it's a true victory for Marine Le Pen (MLP). She was elected in the European Parliament by citizens who wanted things to change, notably more transparency and public debates in an institution that is percieved - and rightfully so - as not very democratic. By raising this issue and taking this stance, she honors her campaign promises and does what the UMP or the PS do not, or are afraid to. She places herself and her party at the center of the political debate. Whether you vote for her or not, you have to admit it's a smart move, and moreover useful, because we need more information on the TTIP content.*

A partir de là, soit on considère que les électeurs ne savent pas ce qui est bon pour eux, ce qui est extrêmement arrogant et dangereux lorsqu'on garde à l'esprit qu'au moins en France, la démocratie et en crise et les français sont cynique à son égard, ou alors on n'hésite pas à dire qu'un processus de débat démocratique sera mis en place pour un traité qui va affecter notre pays.

*The European Union isn't the most popular thing right now in France, this TTIP is going to have an impact on everybody's life in France. From there, either we consider that the citizens don't know their best interest, which is extremely arrogant and dangerous in a time and place where democracy is in crisis and seen with cynicism by the french people, or we do not hesitate to put forward a public debate on an important topic which will have an impact on our country.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Disclaimer: nobody in Britain can or will get arrested for watching porn unless you're doing it in some insanely stupid manner, such as watching it in a public library or watching porn of people (significantly) under the age of consent. The ""porn filter"" legislation which passed recently changed almost nothing. All it did was make it so that when you sign up to a new internet service provider (Virgin, BT, Blueyonder, ect) you *automatically* opt into a filter which stops you from being able to view pornography. It is not illegal to watch pornography. You can opt out of the filter by unticking the box on the form when you sign up to a new internet provider, or call up your internet service provider *at any time* and have the filter removed. The filter isn't even a government filter. It is a filter provided by the company you are purchasing your internet access from. It is a measure to ""protect children"" from obscene imagery, not to chastise the general public. Now, you might disagree with children needing to be ""protected"" in this way, and manner do. However, there's also a large lobby group of parents who don't like their children being able to view such things felt that most internet service providers did not do enough to help them ""protect' their children from such influences. That is why the filter exists. The lobby group and Conservative voting parents were not and are not trying to outlaw porn wholesale. And if you are a parent and don't care about your child watching porn, or think that the filter is too extreme, then your household can simply opt out of the filter. 

**TL;DR For the one thousandth time, porn is just as legal in the UK as it is before the ""porn filter"" law came into effect. You can easily opt out of the filter entirely.

Partenza venerdì 15/8, arrivo a Edimburgo in tarda mattinata. L'alloggio era l'appartamento di un nostro amico emigrato a san diego, ma aveva pagato l'affitto fino a fine mese quindi eravamo liberi di usarlo.

16/8 stiamo a Edimburgo, giriamo un po' la città, tra cui l'osservatorio, ci divertiamo sul Royal Mile con tutti gli artisti di strada e i saltimbanchi.

17/8 lo passiamo cercando di ottenere un'auto a noleggio prenotata il giorno prima. Alla fine, all'alba delle 19, ci arrendiamo e andiamo a ritirarla in aeroporto. La sera ceniamo a casa di amici italiani che stanno là a vivere. Di cui uno cuoco. Best matriciana ever.

18/8, partenza. Inforchiamo la vauxhall astra rosso fuoco e decidiamo di puntare a nord. Passiamo da Stirling, visita da fuori al castello (che l'ingresso costava 18£ e ci era stato sconsigliato in quanto in buona parte è ristrutturato), giro al Wallace Monument (8£, 246 scalini, ma vale tutti gli scellini e tutta la fatica fatta). Ripartiamo e come meta fissiamo lo speyside, che mi piaceva l'idea delle distillerie (sono un moderato bevitore di whisky e i single malt mi piacciono in modo pericolosissimo). Ci arriviamo verso le 18.30, distillerie chiuse, e il cinema per trovare un posto per la notte. Troviamo un adorabile b&amp;b, con il padrone che sembrava il padre di John Peter Sloan (mai sentito un inglese tanto perfetto). Ceniamo in un pub lì di fronte, sbevazziamo un po', vedo un whisky che costava 55£ a bicchiere (ma opto per uno più economico -a titolo informativo, era un Balvenie). Ce la dormiamo di gusto.

19/8, colazione fantastica (bacon e uova, bacon e uova come se piovessero). Ore 09:30, visita alla distilleria del Glenfiddich. Il giro dura un'oretta, con conseguente degustazione di 4 tipi di whisky. Ci rimettiamo in macchina allegri e decisi ad arrivare il più a nord possibile. Arriviamo fino a Portmahomack, sopra la black isle. Pranzo al sacco -anzi, al sacchetto del lidl- in riva al mare del nord, un vento della madonna e uno dei panorami più belli che abbia visto in scozia. Ah, e bambini in spiaggia con la tuta da sci. Visitiamo un cimitero lì vicino, ce la prendiamo easy e ci spostiamo verso sud. Ci piacerebbe arrivare proprio in cima alla Scozia, ma non avremmo fatto in tempo con il noleggio dell'auto. Passiamo Inverness e costeggiamo tutto Loch Ness fino a Fort Augustus, dove avevamo prenotato due posti letto in ostello. Con somma gioia, l'ostello è pulito e i compagni di camera (stanzoni da 6 posti) sono uno più gallo dell'altro. Due australiani come noi on the road (uno dei quali aveva una barba che avrebbero adorato su /r/beardporn), un londinese che si stava facendo tutta l'inghilterra in bicicletta, e una ragazza francese in giro a piedi. Inutile dire che la francese era quella più rompicazzo. Mangiamo al Lock Inn (un bel pub lì a Fort Augustus). La sera c'è un tizio che fa one man band in ostello, ci beviamo un'altra birra lì e poi andiamo a letto.

20/8, verso ovest.

Partiamo di buon mattino, destinazione Isle of Skye. Sulla strada troviamo un bel posto per fare foto, paesaggi spettacolari. Ce la prendiamo easy e non ci facciamo correre dietro dalle lancette. Arriviamo a Skye e a Broadford prendiamo la sinistra verso Elgol. Arriviamo in un posto dimenticato da dio e dagli uomini, sull'oceano, paesaggio nebbioso bello bello, ma c'è cento volte un cazzo. A parte le pecore. Le pecore sono OVUNQUE, in Scozia. Riprendiamo la strada, decisi ad arrivare almeno a nord di Skye. Arriviamo a Dunvegan, visitiamo il castello e i giardini del Dunvegan Castle -sede e dimora del capoclan dei MacLeod-, poi riprendiamo la strada e torniamo a dormire a Fort Augustus. Purtroppo l'indomani avremmo dovuto restituire l'auto. Cena di nuovo al Lock Inn, mangio un hamburger grande quanto me, bevo birra come se fossi una spugna, una signora del luogo mi scambia per tedesco. Facciamo amicizia con ragazze (brutte) australiane in ostello, chiacchieriamo un po' e poi ci mettiamo a dormire. Il londinese se n'è già andato e così la francese. Meglio, più spazio in camerata.

21/8, Salutiamo i due australiani come se stessimo dando l'addio a dei fratelli, e ci mettiamo in macchina. Volevamo risalire Loch Ness dalla sponda orientale...ma QUEL MATTINO l'hanno chiusa per lavori letteralmente davanti a noi. Ci giriamo, e puntiamo verso Glen Coe. Abbiamo tutta la giornata davanti e vogliamo vedere qualcos'altro di bello. Effettivamente, il Glen Coe è **fottutamente bello**. Pensiamo di passare da Glasgow, bere una birra e continuare verso Edimburgo...ma una volta entrati in città veniamo accolti da un traffico che manco Milano. Tiriamo dritto e riconsegniamo l'auto 2 minuti prima dell'orario concordato. Prendiamo il tram verso la città e la sera ci ammazziamo di haggis in un pub di Grassmarket. I prossimi giorni li abbiamo passati a Edimburgo, girando la città e visitando i posti che non avevamo ancora passato -più che altro pub e cimiteri-.

22/8, ore 8 ci mettiamo in cammino verso l'Arthur's Seat, la collina che sovrasta la capitale scozzese. Altitudine finale 250,8m, ma ad ascoltare i miei polmoni e i miei polpacci mi sembrava di stare a 2000. Rimaniamo lì, tergiversiamo, procrastiniamo, ci spostiamo sulle colline lì a fianco. Segue giro di Edimburgo, pensiamo a cosa prendere di regali per i famigliari rimasti a casa, mangiamo e beviamo, e soprattutto CAMMINIAMO. Camminiamo come se non ci fosse un domani, perché siamo troppo taccagni per autobus o taxi.

23/8, ultimo giro della città, sistemiamo un paio di cose che ci aveva chiesto l'emigrato, e poi ci facciamo colazione da Mom's (e se passate da Edimburgo, fate colazione lì, vi prego): torre di pancake con sciroppo d'acero e bacon, bacon roll, succo di cranberry e via. Passeggiamo un po' a cazzo per la città, compriamo gli ultimi regali, mi compro un kilt e la sera usciamo con gli amici italiani a bere a uno degli stand del fringe. Veniamo importunati da due goliardici sbronzi di Glasgow, e andiamo a preparare le valigie.

24/8: Colazione veloce in un bar sotto casa, e poi prendiamo il bus navetta verso l'aeroporto...che si torna a casa :(

In tutto (tenendo conto che ho speso 200£ di kilt), compreso il volo credo di aver speso intorno agli 800-900€. Il problema è che la vita in scozia costa. E la birra ancora di più (una pinta 4,5-5£).",0,1409676748,null,0,false,0,ck774w3,t3_2f9je1,t1_ck774w3,t1_ck75wo3,null,1427239246,7,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,7

I was talking about using French and German factories and supplies used to make chemical weapons to gas the Kurds. The UK, France, Germany, etc all supported Saddam. Even cold war foe Russia supported him. I was never defending the 2003 Iraq war. I was talking about support during the Iran-Iraq war. After providing SH with the means and the materials and the knowledge to produce chemical weapons you would think France or Germany would have contributed to the enforcement of the no-fly zone in the Kurdish region. The UK helped but no other European power could bother, dispute their material contribution to creating the situation. 

This reluctance to do anything has not changed even today. The EU was negotiating a free-trade agreement with Ukraine, which it knew would anger Russia. When the situation deteriorated, Germany was one of the last European countries to agree to even the most gentle sanctions against Russia for its resulting actions. Germany and Western Europe, has been condescendingly telling Eastern Europe and the Baltics that they are too paranoid about Russia. Even still Germany seems to be very reluctant to support the Baltics and Eastern Europe, to the point they are mostly relying on a country thousands of kilometers away and across an ocean. So much for European unity.

Inaction is not always a virtue. The US told the EU to handle the situation in Bosnia/Serbia on many occasions because it was a ""European issue"". The EU would do nothing more than hold meetings and negotiations. This was all while Dutch soldiers watched thousands of people get slaughtered in front of them. I am not blaming the soldiers, they requested air support from the EU only to be ignored. The EU had people on the ground telling them what would happen, but no country could be bothered to do anything about it. Despite being a NATO operation, the US initiated air strikes against Milosevic, only to obtain European support after actions were already underway. 

I do think European nations sending weapons and aid to Kurds is helpful, but the first US airstrikes were against ISIS installations that were attacking fleeing Yazidis. The US is the only Western country providing air/military support to the Kurds against who are almost unanimously considered a legitimate enemy. 

Especially in the past, the US was overly heavy handed in its interventions. South America is a great example. That heavy handedness drove public opinion there away from the US in many countries. I think that is why in the later years you see much less of that. It was counter productive and created more problems than it solved. You can see it again today. Both the governments in Iraq and Afghanistan are both very anti-American. But dont tout inaction as a virtue in all cases. Sitting back and allowing a genocide to happen on the European continent because Germany or France cant be bothered to do anything does not make them virtuous. Willful blindness to some of the worst human atrocities when you have the power to do something about it is not something I would be bragging about. 

&gt;Europe does 99.9% of its meddling with soft power. 

I guess that depends on what your definition of economic carrot and stick is. Keeping ex-colonies under an insurmountable pile of debt so they have no choice but to do what their former colonist says is not really a carrot and stick in my opinion. Especially the UK and France are active in the workings of their former colonies. France and Canada co-hosted a Haitian Coup Bash only a few years ago. They held a summit in Toronto about the future government of Haiti, but didn't bother to invite any Haitians. The thing is they weren't even trying to hide what they were doing. 

So Germany might be at the carrot/stick phase, but you certainly can not extend that to all of Europe. ",0,1409676880,null,0,false,0,ck7778y,t3_2f5rxo,t1_ck7778y,t1_ck6zl8h,null,1427239214,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

- Above 18 years old;    
- Not convicted for criminal offenses;    
- No psychiatric problems that require(d) hospitalization;    
- Not the subject of a previous loss of a gun license;    
- Have a medical certificate that states you can handle a weapon without endangering yourself or others;    
- Succeed a test that shows your gun knowledge;    
- No other adult(s) who you live with in the same house protests against your gun application;    
- Have a reason to own a gun and ammunition (in practice this means ""be member of a gun club"").

Tanto. Cosa ti interessa in particolare? Al ristorante e' difficile spendere meno di 50 euro a testa. La birra costa in media 8-10 euro a pinta. La benzina e' leggermente piu' costosa che in Italia, poi devi continuamente prendere traghetti se viaggi lungo la costa. Un caffe' (lungo) mi pare di averlo pagato 6/7 euro a Trondheim, un cono gelato 7/8 euro.

Da Italiano poi prendere multe e' facilissimo. Ho preso 60 euro di multa per aver parcheggiato nella piazzetta davanti al mio hotel. Non c'era nessun cartello eppure dovevo magicamente capire da solo che la sosta era vietata.

&gt; Riguardo al cibo pessimo rimango basito da una simile affermazione!

Perche'? Le uniche volte che ho mangiato bene sono state in un ristorante giapponese, in un pub (e' difficile fare un hamburger troppo disgustoso), e [qui](http://www.tavern.no/). Gli altri ristoranti pessimi, fare la spesa al supermercato costa tantissimo, e lo ""street"" food praticamente non esiste (solo 7-11 e roba simile = merda).

Anche il famoso Bacalao di Alesund non mi e' sembrato questa grande esplosione di sapori.

edit: In teoria il mio hotel a Trondheim doveva avere la miglior colazione della Norvegia. Non dico che facesse schifo, ma cazzo.. Baccala', caviale, fagioli, salsicce, patate al forno, polpette di non so quale animale esotico con un sapore fortissimo di carne selvatica, riso con peperoni e altro, per non parlare dei soliti uovo con bacon e  affettati vari. Come si fa a mangiare sta roba a colazione? Foto:

true,LenryNmQ,EURO,That part with millions of hungarians,"&gt; How are the media covering this issue 

The free part of the media covers it when the topic was hot, then nobody cared about it anymore. Lots of other topics came by...
The pro-gov part of the media focused on the books will be cheaper for the general public, and free for some, and the state monopoly and fewer books will guarantee quality and low prices *(yes, the Secretary of State for Education of the Ministry actually said this oxymoron, I maybe include a video about this, with commentaries later, if you want to)*, and bashed the old publishers for the high prices (which was a lie, as the ministry limits the prices)

&gt; and what is the situation with freedom of press in general in Hungary?

Now that needs a little bit longer answer, but in a nutshell: it's absolutely free by law.
In the real life things are a little bit more difficult...

First, of course we have the state media, the national television and radio (MTV - Magyar Televízió, MR - Magyar Rádió), it is naturally the tube for goverment propaganda. In every news they said ""Hungary perfoms better"" (this sentence was [an actual campaign-slogan](https://www.google.hu/search?q=magyarorsz%C3%A1g+jobban+teljes%C3%ADt&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m-wFVL-CPavXyQPmsoLgBg&amp;ved=0CCcQsAQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=887) of the ruling party during this years election), it's filled only with positive news, or marginal local topics, when really nothing positive happened that day. It doesn't really worth to watch / listen to, but they reach most of people.

Along this there are the ""friendly media"", controlled by the closest friends of the goverment.
E.g. one of the country's richest man, Lajos Simicska, who owns the biggest advertising company, the greatest selling newspapers, the biggest construction company, and his men are in most of the biggest state companies and authorities - energetics, news, the distribution of EU investments, etc - so this man is a lifelong friend and college roommate of PM Viktor Orbán. [Here's an article about the topic](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/16/us-hungary-idUSBRE83F0KG20120416)
Their media isn't so positive, but of course it never attacks the gvmt, their job is to smash and smear the opposition as much as they can.

Then there's the media of the opposition, but it's becoming more and more marginal, as they've got less and less support and advertisement.

One TV channel needs an own chapter: RTL Klub. It's a nation-wide TV, freely available for anyone. For long they tried to be neutral, hoping to avoid the attention of the goverment but when the ruling party attacked multinational companies, try to squeeze as much money from them, as they can, and [RTL got it's own tax](http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2014/07/28/eu-commissioner-new-hungarian-tax-aimed-at-chasing-broadcaster-rtl-away/), they become extremely antigov, since then pretty much every evening in the News they uncover something stinky from the goverment, the party or it's people.

For the online media... the real online mainstream media is the ""free-est"" of all, but unfortunately they are marginal in numbers to the mainstream TV and newspapers, and reach far less people, than it would need to make any difference.
Unfortunately they aren't completely free from pressure either. Some months ago the editor in chief of a major online newsportal origo.hu [has been fired](http://444.hu/2014/06/05/deutsche-telekom-hungarian-government-collude-to-silence-independent-media/), after he published an article about the private travels of János Lázár, Minister of Prime Minister's Office on the government's budget. The owner of the portal is Magyar Telekom, (a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG) - which at the time signed a contract with the goverment on a multibillion-euro telecommunicational developement project.
The connection is obvious...

&gt; Has there been any independent assessment of the quality of the new textbooks?

No. Only the Ministry of Education has the authority of assessing textbooks, and as it was really a costly and long process for private publishers, it seems for the state publishers it is instant.

&gt; Could you provide me with some more details about the general attitude among Hungarians concerning these reforms?

Most people doesn't even care. Even they don't have children, or they are adult as well, or happy about the ""free"" books (textbooks are free for 1st graders and those who are socially need it).
Those who cares... the teachers are state-employed, they are in a fear of losing their jobs, and the other people who cared, like me... we aren't as many to make any difference, and our government is an expert of not giving a f*ck about complains.",0,1409680031,null,0,1409681333,0,ck78rgp,t3_2f6t4r,t1_ck78rgp,t1_ck6y5h0,null,1427237995,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Dopo aver visitato Sorrento e l'Amalfi coast abbiamo ignorato Pompeii (troppo piena di turisti e troppo vasta da visitare serenamente col caldo di Agosto) e ci siamo fatti Ercolano e tutte tutte le ville d'otium visitabili dell'antica Stabiae. Una figata pazzesca sconosciuta al mondo dove eravamo solo noi a vagare per queste meraviglie. 

Consiglio a tutti gli amanti della storia e dell'archeologia:

Ercolano - famoso ma non quanto Pompei, te la giri bene bene con 4 ore, pochi altri visitatori in mezzo alle palle, opuscoli e mappe gratuiti sono forniti all'ingresso esaustivi e completi. Più figa di Pompei imho, ci sono anche porte e travi in legno che si sono conservate, nonché solai e molti secondi piani.

Villa Arianna e Villa S.Marco - sperdute tra case abusive e filari di pomodori nella campagna dietro Castellammare, una meraviglia! Villa S.Marco è un vero viaggio nel tempo perché è stata quasi completamente restaurata, villa Arianna è più allo stato di ritrovamento ma entrambe molto suggestive e l'ingresso è AGGRATIS ed i custodi sono gentilissimi, soprattutto Ciro il custode di villa Arianna, ciao Ciro!

Villa di Poppea ad Oplontis - altra splendida villa piena di affreschi e ben restaurata, raggiungibile dopo l'attraversamento di vicoli sgarrupatissimi della moderna Torre Annunziata. Altro effetto time travel, molto bella ed affreschi spettacolari, peccato all'ingresso ti diano solo una mappa che non spiega poi molto. Qualche turista c'era ma poca roba. Prezzo all'ingresso irrisorio, incluso nel biglietto c'è anche:

L'Antiquarium di Boscoreale con annesso casale agricolo romano con vigneto - piccolo museo nascosto in mezzo a palazzoni popolari di dubbio gusto. Contiene reperti e pannelli e ricostruzioni della vita agricola dell'antica Roma. Bonus il calco del cane di Pompei originale sta qui, accanto al calco di una scrofa. Fuori sotto 7 metri di materiale eruttivo c'è una cascina romana ben restaurata, non visibile dentro ma circumnavigabile e nel frattempo puoi mangiare uva e fichi gentilmente forniti dalle piante che la circondano.",0,1409681570,null,0,false,0,ck79iyo,t3_2f9je1,t1_ck79iyo,t3_2f9je1,null,1427237406,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5

true,ctes,POLA,Galicja,"You have it mostly right. These funds in Poland are being used to pay the current pensions. They have been for a while now. The thing is, you can't just stop doing that - it's a huge amount of money that goes for retirement pensions every year, and these have to be paid. Not just to people on retirement right now, but also to people who will retire in near future: they'll have no time to save up money if you change rules when they're 50. You also can't introduce a new system and then have them both running at the same time. If young people pay into the new one, the old one will go bankrupt.

Poland had a reform in the late 90s, where a small part of the tax you'd pay into the state-run system would be given to new private institutions. The money missing in ZUS (the national pension fund) would be covered by the state budget. As of 2013, IIRC (can't find the PDF),  the transfer of money to ZUS was around 50% of total Polish deficit - some of that would have been there without the reforem, as between inefficiency, bad demography and a significant gray economy ZUS is failing.

What Tusk did was he took the money from these private institutions to save ZUS, and the Polish budget, essentially cancelling the reform and ~~admitting defeat.~~ Silly me, he admitted nothing.

Subsequent conservative governments have done very little beyond lip service to reverse this.

Ich habe sowas mittlerweile mehrsmals hinter mir und es hat mich jedesmal komplett geerdet.

Für mich ist das super, weil ich jetzt einfach das Gratis Spotify anmachen kann ohne Angst um verminderte Qualität zu haben :)


Generell ist meine Meinung, dass jeder mal so einen Blindtest (aber bitte ordentlich und nicht halbherzig) durchziehen sollte. Gerade im Bereich Hifi gibt es unendlich viele Leute mit abartig überhöhter Selbstüberschätzung... Da werden wahllos Kristalle auf Fensterscheiben geklebt und das wird dann als klangliche Offenbarung verkauft.


Im Moment gibt es ja die Debatte zwischen normaler 16bit/44.1kHz Musik und der Highres Variante mit 24bit/x kHz. Auch da wird immer von unglaublich großen Unterschieden gesprochen.


Es gibt jemanden namens ""Archimago"" der in seinem Blog dazu einen Blindteset mit 140  Teilnehmern gemacht hat. Er hat ein paar 24 bit Stücke genommen, die sauber auf 16 bit runtergesamplet und das dann öffentlich als FLAC auf seine Webseite gestellt. Das Ergebnis: Keine Unterschiede hörbar!


Der Interessanteste Eintrag dazu: http://archimago.blogspot.de/2014/06/24-bit-vs-16-bit-audio-test-part-ii.html 


Ausserdem hat er das gleiche 2013 mit 320 kbps MP3 gemacht. Überraschendes Ergebnis: Ein Großteil der Leute fand das MP3 besser...

Das Gute ist aber, dass Scheiße immer dazu anregt Sachen besser zu machen. Nach Knuddels hat sich Mainstreamdeutschland bei StudiVZ oder my_space eingenistet und damit eigenständig uncool gemacht. Dann sind die selben Pfeifen Jahre später zu facebook und haben das uncool gemacht. Und jetzt leidet reddit halt unter den /r/de Usern - die TopPosts des Tages unterscheiden sich nicht mehr vom meist-geteilten Content auf facebook.

Also ist das alles schon ein natürlicher Prozess in dem die Reichweite immer größer wird und der Sterbensprozess der Community immer schneller. 4chans /b/ ist da eine Ausnahme, weil eben das ganze digitale Masturbieren (der eFame,Karma,Likes) nicht möglich ist.
Offensichtlich gibt es aber das tiefe menschliche Bedürfnis nach Anerkennung (Maslow) und Individualität ohne dafür aber die notwendige Substanz bieten zu können. Das lässt sich ja nur ""lösen"" indem man einem Paradoxon gerecht wird.
Diaspora war ein guter Ansatz aufgrund der Dezentralität, aber zu fail-entwickelt damit das klappt. 
Deswegen tippe ich mal, könnte friendica inkl. Twitter&amp;fb API ein Ansatz sein beidem gerecht zu werden.
Da könntest du dann auch geilen Content wie das Gabriele Krone-Schmalz Interview posten und die Schwachköpfe könnten es zwar lesen,liken oder sonstwas, aber eben im kleinen Kosmos des eigenen Servers keinen Einfluss auf dein Post, dein Umfeld oder die Meinung im digitalen Radius vermainstreamen.

The overall situation you describe, except for the textbooks being directly published by the state, is very similar to situation in Bosnia.

I'm not really concerned by the corruption itself, because there will always be corrupt officials, but rather by the lack of response from the citizens who, from what you describe, seem very apathetic.

What kind of pressure is exerted upon the opposition media?

As a guy working in a hostel in Paris, I'm the only French guy working there. All my colleges are foreigners.

Try hotels, hostels, bars, touristic sites, services. Maybe another lead would be to work for some English-language school, not necessarily teaching English, but administration jobs and whatnot, which are often taken by native English speakers. In Paris for example, there's the ""Wall Street Institute"" for learning English which seems to be run a lot by native English speakers from all around.

Do you know any language other than English? Do you perhaps have at least some notions you remember from school? Because ultimately, even though in a hotel for example you'll mostly use English, it's still pretty much required you understand the local language as well, because tourists aren't always foreigners. 

edit : the problem however, is that for these ""unskilled jobs"", it will probably be required that you already live in the country before you can get the job.

Pa-ro-la-cce. Mo-to. Fem-mi-ne. Il mondo dei grandi - del quale non sapevo nulla se non che non vedevo l'ora di arrivarci - che mi si dispiegava davanti con tutto il suo fascino misterioso e tentatore. Intuivo che musicalmente erano quello che erano (ero piccolo ma già muovevo i primi passi da ascoltatore sentendomi i Queen e i Toto, e non c'era bisogno di capirne granché per avvertire la differenza tra Freddie Mercury e Claudio Cecchetto) ma non era importante: la cosa importante era che quei due tizi non solo facevano le cose fiche che fanno quelli grandi che vanno al liceo, ma che ci facevano anche le canzoni.

Ci avrei messo del tempo a capire che no, gli 883 non raccontavano esattamente storie di ficheria conclamata e che - anzi - erano canzoni che riflettevano il dramma di quello che è finalmente diventato abbastanza grande da fare le cose fiche solo per scoprire che non gli vengono lo stesso. Ci avrei messo del tempo, ma sarebbe stata una cosa a suo modo dolce. Perché lo avrei capito passandoci attraverso mano mano, vivendo in prima persona le mie serate finite all'autogrill perché non ho trovato la festa, le mie domeniche a guardare le ragazze degli altri, le mie serate al bar con la coppia che porco Giuda c'avran la mia età. E per ogni piccola profezia degli 883 che avveravo, il ricordo di quando - bontà divina - pensavo che arrivare fin là sarebbe stato un traguardo meraviglioso di cui andare fieri quando si passa davanti allo specchio mi ha sempre fatto un po' di auto-tenerezza.

Gli 883 per me sono stati come i romanzi di formazione (siano essi Il giovane Holden o Jack Frusciante è uscito dal gruppo cambia poco): quei romanzi che li leggi quando sei più piccolo del protagonista e hanno un senso, poi li rileggi quando hai la stessa età del protagonista e hanno un senso diverso, poi li trileggi quando sei più vecchio e, sorpresa, hanno un altro senso ancora. 

Oggi, all'età che ai tempi d'oro di Pezzali e Repetto mi sarebbe valsa una citazione in qualche canzonaccia contro i matusa e con vent'anni di onorata militanza metallara alle spalle, gli 883 me li sento ancora.

L'idea di fondo nella tua risposta è quella che ho criticato in un altro commento (che ti invito a leggere per non ripetermi): come se **la** comunità LGBT (e già il fatto che usi il singolare è significativo) e la comunità dei credenti fossero due schieramenti compatti.

Dimostrazione che la comunità LGBT è tutto fuorché compatta è che ogni tanto spunta fuori una lettera nuova alla sigla. Ora si è aggiunta la E ed è sparita la Q, per dire.

Corollario a questa idea sbagliata è che tutti i credenti in tutti i momenti seguano alla lettera tutto il catechismo. A sto punto sarà la mia attenzione selettiva, ma conosco un sacco di credenti che è favorevole o indifferente a tutta la faccenda.

La religione è solo un paravento. Ciò che muove gli omofobi è paura, disgusto o che cavolo ne so. Se fosse una questione meramente religiosa, tutto ciò che può fare un credente verso uno che pecca è avvertirlo e, se costui persevera, poi lasciarlo al suo destino e tutt'al più pregare per lui.

Quindi, checché se ne pensi, il vero cristiano è colui che vive e lascia vivere, e non perde tempo a vietare niente a nessuno.

Che ci si creda o no, spesso è la gente a fare la religione e non il contrario. Ma fa più comodo vedere i credenti come idioti lobotomizzati, è più semplice.",0,1409689423,null,0,false,0,ck7dkw7,t3_2f9qwb,t1_ck7dkw7,t1_ck7cd71,null,1427234482,7,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,7

I can see Russia bullying Ukraine, but why the fuck would we threaten our *European* customers? 


While it is true that European market is significantly more important for Russia, there is a simple truth behind all of that - Europe uses Russian gas because the price is *economically viable* and **there is no infrastructure in place to replace Russian gas within a 1 year period**. 

After 1 year what next? Will dozens of LNG terminals magically pop-up everywhere? Will price in domestic market of U.S&amp;co remain the same when they began to export? Can they meet demand in 1, 1,5 year period? What is going to become with European economy in the meantime? 


Basically, **who has better foundations and benefited the most throughout the whole Ukrainian ordeal?** 


If you escalate even further (for ex. i've read about military drills in Western Ukraine with 1k troops) what stops rebels from ""acquiring"" jets from their respective local pawn shops/captured from Army? What stops Russia from escalating even further or taking an even more aggressive stance?

According to our consitution the German military only serves one purpose and that is to repel any foreign invasions on German territory. Needless to say there is no threat of any invasion. So it has been hard for the last 25 years to justify the military spending unchanged after the end of the cold war.

You may wonder, how come Germany is involved in conflicts like in ex-Yugoslawia or Afghanistan then? Well... Our politicians decided they wanted to be good allies to NATO/US. So they bent the constitution, claiming Germany would need to be defended at the Hindukush and stuff like that. They couldn't bring themselves to change the consitution though, so that remains like in 1989. 

Today, ignoring all constitutional boundaries, we are in a phase of reorganizing the military into an ""intervention army"". Don't get excited about it. Unless we change our constitution there will always be an extremely simple loophole for our politicians to say ""what? no! this intervention would be against our constitution, so we can't support it in good conscience"".

Argomento tristo e banalissimo. E' banale che trattandosi di un gruppo di persone non li si può considerare alla stregua di un individuo, ma dovrebbe essere altrettanto banale capire che a grandi linee le più popolari fra le associazioni e le manifestazioni di una comunità la rappresentano.

&gt; Corollario a questa idea sbagliata è che tutti i credenti in tutti i momenti seguano alla lettera tutto il catechismo.

Le loro organizzazioni, sia religiose che laiche, sono praticamente tutte contrarie al riconoscimento dei diritti dei gay. Come sopra: una comunità è rappresentata dalle proprie organizzazioni.

&gt; La religione è solo un paravento.

Minchiate a go-go, che vengono *sempre* (per altro) da gente che il sentimento religioso non capisce cos'è. Per chi ha fede nella correttezza della dottrina cattolica, questa è fondamento sufficiente al rigetto dei diritti per i gay. E c'è tanta gente che ha fede. Non è un paravento.

&gt; Se fosse una questione meramente religiosa, tutto ciò che può fare un credente verso uno che pecca è avvertirlo

Cazzate (per altro anche queste trite e ritrite). Un credente personalmente non è tenuto ad alcun intervento, ma la dottrina della chiesa (parliamo di italia quindi parliamo di cattolicesimo) richiede che l'ordinamento pubblico si conformi a principi morali che includono il riconoscimento esclusivo della famiglia tradizionale. Un credente può non agire in alcun modo, personalmente, contro alcun gay, ma può benissimo votare e far votare perché continuino a essergli negati i suoi diritti.

&gt; Quindi, checché se ne pensi, il vero cristiano è colui che vive e lascia vivere

Minchiate feelgood da persona che ha conosciuto la religione solo in versione light. Per il cattolico post-concordato, l'impegno politico per la diffusione dei valori cristiani è una possibilità e quasi un dovere. Parecchi non lo rispettano, moltissimi sì.

&gt; Ma fa più comodo vedere i credenti come idioti lobotomizzati, è più semplice.

Mai pensato e anzi vaffanculo per il paragone agli atei cretini di r/atheism. La religione è un fenomeno che ha seguito l'homo sapiens dalla sua differenziazione, figuriamoci se può essere una forma di stupidità. Chi mette da parte il sentimento religioso in quel modo è un cretino; ma è un illuso chi pensa che il sentimento religioso sia solo facciata per dar corpo a tradizionalismi altrimenti laici.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"&gt;Is it ""Liberté, égalité, fraternité"" or ""we sell weapons to everybody"" ?

Pretty sure they've spent the last few decades developing the ""We sell weapons to everybody"" line.

France is going to sell the ships. It's a done deal. Arms dealing is a major industry and it's economically extremely important. If France reneges on this deal, that presents a few problems;

Firstly, the arms industry is almost one made entirely of plausible deniability - ""Here's your weapons, I don't really care what they're for, just give me the money"". If France starts saying ""Wait wait wait, what are you going to be using these weapons you're paying us to give you for?"" and they actually decide to renege on deals based on that, it sets a precedent; A precedent that countries selling arms are actually responsible for how they're used. People have been selling arms to other countries and people that were unsavory for decades; Dictatorships, warlords, criminals. Plausible deniability is a pretty big deal.

Secondly, is France were to renege on this deal, that massively damages their credibility. If people think that they're going to have their guns taken away from them because the provider is having a moral crisis, they're simply not going to buy from them. Wars don't wait, people looking for arms want consistent and reliable purchases where if someone says ""You will get these arms"", you can know you'll get them.

Thirdly, pure economics. France's economy is legitimately struggling, while it might be able to take hits from giving up on this arms deal, especially if they're compensated, the overall damage to their industry would be far greater than the costs of some Mistral ships.

Now, I'm not coming down on either side here, as to whether or not France were to sell these ships or not. There's a lot of reasonable arguments for and against. But if you're going to try and make an argument against this sale, it has to be on a sound basis of how it benefits France. 

You can trust France to follow through on its commitments; Their reluctance to fold on this deal is a testament to that. They probably wont be selling to Russia again after this. Trusting France is not something I'd worry about, it's the effects those ships have on Russia's power projection is something I'd be worrying about.

Duh, Rafale is better than Typhoon. It beat the crap out of it in each test made. Rafale has even beat the F22. 

&gt; The former Red Arrows team leader – Peter Collins – stated Rafale as a “war-fighter par excellence”. He added that he deemed the Rafale to be the best and most complete combat aircraft that he had ever flown. He concluded in saying that if he had to go into combat, on any mission, against anyone, he would, without question, choose the Rafale.

&gt; In another aircraft exercise in the UAE, even the F-22 Raptor, a fifth generation fighter, could hardly do anything to “tame” Rafale. According to Jean-Marc Tanguy’s information, defence journalist, the balance sheet lies in the figures hereafter:

&gt; Dogfighting (with Rafale weapons system’s performance lowered on purpose):  
FAF Rafales vs RAF Typhoons : 4 – 0

&gt; Dogfighting with further Rafale weapons system reduction:  
FAF Rafales vs RAF Typhoons : 3 – 1

&gt; Final balance sheet (in both scenarii the Rafales did not have full weapons systems…):  
FAF Rafales vs RAF Typhoons : 7 – 1

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"&gt;When exactly did Russia or Putin said anything like that? Or is it mr. former ambassador talking out of his ass? Or are you taking political bickering for its face value during times of crisis?

It's far from an unlikely scenario. There are talks of sanctions escalating all the time because Putin refuses to back down. Need I remind you that Russia cut off exports of fossil fuels to Estonia over a fucking statue? This is considerably more serious than that and I expect there to be sudden bouts of 'emergency maintenace' which shuts down the supply of gas to Europe intermittently throughout the winter, particularly if it's a severe one, meant to remind and threaten the leaders of EU countries about their dependence on Russian gas and why they should let Putin get away with Russian actions in Ukraine. I mean, you talk about 'why would Russia threaten European customers', ignoring that they've done so MANY times under Putin's tenure. 

As to your assertions about European dependence on Russian gas, the idea that Russian gas is economically viable is a fucking joke. Poland pays some 30-40% more for gas than China does, which is more expensive than what spot markets in Asia are selling LNG for, hence why they're creating a massive LNG import terminal that can support 50% of Polish demand that's expected to be completed this year. Anyway, they wouldn't need to replace all the Russian gas with other supplies, there's also the option of cutting down. Australia had water restrictions during our drought for large cities with public awareness campaigns asking people to lower their usage to a resouding success, the same could be done in Europe.

But that's all beside the point, because it's on the occasion that *Russia chooses to cut gas supplies*, so I don't know why you're acting as if it would be the other way around. If Putin cuts of the gas, Europe will manage. Putin loses 20% of state government revenue, which will impact his plans and the populace and will destabilize his rule. Your entire stance seems to be ""just let Putin do what he wants"", going off of this lovely quote of yours

&gt;What stops Russia from escalating even further or taking an even more aggressive stance?

Sanctions have to be put in place to demonstrate to the world that this kind of action is unacceptable. 

And again, just to reiterate the point: **This article is talking about why Putin will not cut off gas**.

&gt;Even if you succeed, do you think Russian will forget any of that? What our relations would look like 5-10 years on from now?

This seems completely incompatible with NATO membership. This is a big if, but *if* Russia attacked Latvia do you think Germany would invoke its constitution to claim it can not intervene despite NATO Article 5?

&gt;should Germany too, like so many other countries become an interventionalist force at military level? Because quite clearly, there is no other purpose for increasing our spending.

I am a firm believer pacifism is not always the best option. Certainly the US can be overly aggressive, but the EU in general can be far too pacifist in my opinion. They ignored Dutch peacekeeping troops in Bosnia that repeatedly asked for support. The result was thousands of people being slaughtered in front of the Dutch soldiers' eyes. I certainly dont blame the soldiers, but I definitely blame the EU politicians who ignored them (and obviously the genocidal cowards). 

Europe was completely silent when the US asked for support patrolling the Kurdish parts of Iraq. The UK helped, as usual, but the rest of Europe did not lift a finger. It is not very well known, but France and Germany built Saddam's chemical manufacturing capability and supplied him with raw materials. I dont think they were expecting them to be used as such, but support to help rectify the situation would have been greatly appreciated. 

There is a very recent example today in the Kurdish region. The first attacks against ISIS were because they began indiscriminately firing on Yazidi refugees. Up until then the US was simply patrolling. I think most people, except some redditors who see anything the US does as bad, would agree the US stepping in was the right thing to do. 

So long story short, I would like to see Germany take a more active role. Its leadership is certainly more restrained than the US, UK, or even France, but I dont necessarily see that as a bad thing. Given the fact it is one of the world's largest economies, it is clearly very influential within the EU,  a response is expected given its role. This is usually only a condemnation without much action. I personally think the days of ""we'd love to help but we cant...sorry"" need to end.

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"I agree OUR GOVERNMENT should cancel the deal, especially in light of recent events. But this isn't about canceling some basic sale deal.

Problem is the ships weren't built ex-nihilo by French labor, resources and materials alone. Russians were part of the building process. Canceling the deal would amount to Russians giving France stuff, and France keeping it hostage. Basically, to be brief, the ordeal isn't just about Russia giving money to France to build something for them. France wouldn't be simply refusing to sell something to Russia, or just reimbursing Russia for the trouble. Ultimately, the problem isn't about loosing money and loosing jobs in France. The ships already partly belong to Russia. They were built in Saint Nazaire because the port has the expertise. But they were Russian ships from the start. 

As for the French people not protesting to pressure the government into canceling the deal, it is a sorry fact that the French, as do most Western Europeans, don't feel particularly concerned or threatened by Russia, and don't really ""get"" or feel remotely close to Eastern Europe, including the ten Eastern countries which were suddenly integrated all at once in the EU. Ukraine even more is a far away place, quite unknown and foreign. There's a great deal of education about these countries which needs to be made in France.

true,pharmaceus,null,null,"I figure I'll suggest a few places with a mix of political and historical context

**Switzerland**. Anywhere really... but perhaps thr Geneve, Lucerne also try to experience part of the culture - a very unique country speaking four languages and with some truly ancient traditions while at the same time being easily one of the most globalized places in the whole world.  Also the alps everywhere around and the surviving historical architecture. you can emulate the experience by visiting the neighbouring regions in Italy, France, Austria or Germany but Switzerland is fairly unique.

Alternatively try **Liechtenstein**. Similar to Switzerland and you get to see a medieval principality in present times. For a more republican approach try **Andorra** or **San Marino**.Just don't expect anything big...it's a small country after all. Try to visit Liechtenstein on the prince's birthday. It's a national holiday and the prince gives a huge party open to the public (or so I've been told)

Weird borders running through the middle of towns in Europe: **Baarle** in Netherlands and Belgium, **Kerkrade** in Netherlands and Germany and I totally forgot the name of the city in Alsace-Lorraine where you have Germany on one side of the street and France on the other. Silly stuff - only in Europe :) 

And last but not least... a peculiar if not popular place.

**Goerlitz** in Germany - especially if you are into urban history. If you ever find yourself in Central Europe on a way through or towards Czech republic, Germany or Poland stop at Goerlitz. One of two surviving old towns in Germany hardly touched by the war (which is why there are constant trips from all over Germany) contrasted with the city built during DDR times. Fun fact - the actual historical city is split by the river Neisse/Nysa - with parts of it going over to Poland after 1947.Since it's part of Schengen you can walk between the two and see five historical realities in one place. Old Germany,DDR Germany, New Germany, Socialist Poland, New Poland. 

If you go there perhaps you'll meet Nick Cage. I did...He came looking for mystical treasures.  But I have to warn you - not much more to see other than that. The city is half-dead right now.

At that time Estonia even wasn't even a member of EU/NATO if i remember correctly, was it not? 


There is a difference in threatening and acting upon a threat, especially during times of crisis (more bullshit from both sides).


Poland pays what it pays because they had no alternative (and because of their political stances, their previous role in gas transit alongside Ukraine and others), which is why they are building LNG terminal. But it took them quite some time to do so, so if Europe wants to diversify they should also start building, but it still would require *a considerable amount of money and time*. 


Even if you build a shit ton of LNGs, either the price will go up or Gasprom will lower the price to make it less economically viable, thus undermining the investment/fracking revolution to some extent. 


Sanctions are already in place, they already had an impact and will continue to worsen situation, more are en route, where is the ""line in the sand"" so to speak? 


I consider cutting off gas as an **extreme** option at which point we are basically at war to some extent (thus our relations for near-time future is fucked). What next? Russians roll over and quietly die?


Perhaps i misunderstood you overall, mainly because there are quite a number of people here who advocate for EU to cut off gas transit from Russia, in that case i apologize.

Secondo me, come tutto in Italia, e' il colpo dei vecchi, vecchi fisicamente e mentalmente. Solo i giovani capiscono e conoscono le cose nuove. Sapete perche'? Perche' tutta questa gente parlano delle cose vecchie, come se fossimo ancora negli anni '60. ""Gli italiani (sempre ""gli italiani"", non un attore o attrice o una persona specifica...ma tutti gli italiani) sono i migliori della cinema, abbiamo inventato/fatto X, Y, e Z hurrr durrrr"". Ma Gino Cappuccino non ha fatto un cazzo a parte di lavorare nello stesso posto per tutta la vita e fare la sega della cucina Italiana, dicendo: ""Oooohhhh questo non e' fatto come fa la mia mamma...fap fap fap fap"".

That, ladies and gentlemen, is the last generation in a nutshell. Why is it like this? Because that generation still has a stranglehold on the country and still thinks the earth is flat, and everything from politics to food to entertainment has become so dull and outdated (ok, maybe not all the food) that they don't even know what else is out there. These are the same people who will say, ""Yes, but we have the finest dubbers in the world!"" Guess what? Everyone else is speaking English, including the younger generation of Italians, and they don't need dubbing anymore. Actually bragging about how good you are at dubbing films is like bragging that you can make the greatest horseshit sandwich in the world; it's still a shit sandwich. No one cares because no one else eats shit sandwiches. It's like they aim for the lowest common denominator these days and then brag about it. Meanwhile, the rest of Italy, i.e., the other half of the nation that isn't living in a completely delusional 1963 mindset, is fighting tooth and nail to usurp these leeches and relics of the Italian state but are swimming against the current. Why? Because the same leeches and relics and old, useless farts of Italy specifically designed post-WW2 Italy to never change. 

Right about now people are saying, ""BUT WHAT ABOUT LA GRANDE BELLEZZA?!?!?!? What about it? Yes, it's a great movie. Yes, it won many awards. But you know what? It's just another one-trick pony for Italian cinema. Stupid Christmas movies with Cristian De Sica and arthouse films that all steal from Fellini - this is what Italy has been reduced to, and do you know why? Because everything else ""non e' fatto come fa la mia mamma.""

This is why we don't have our own Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy, Banshee, True Blood (last three seasons sucked), Big Bang Theory, Doctor Who, Sherlock, Misfits, Downton Abbey, etc.....but it's coming. It's coming and Gomorra is proof of this. Gomorra is what The Sopranos tried to be but instead ended up as a fucking soap opera.

Una delle ditte leader nel campo dell'*influencing* (o come cavolo si dice) e' la Casaleggio e Associati; ma nonostante corsi, seminari e training i parlamentari 5S rimangono quel che sono (e mi risparmio epiteti e descrizioni, ma ci siamo capiti). In altre parole, l'unica cosa che ottieni e' creare rumore, ma non ottieni risultati.

I veri 'manipolatori' in genere sono molto intelligenti: pensa a Filippo Facci, Giuliano Ferrara, per certi versi Travaglio prima del crollo mentale, e ci metto pure Uriel Fanelli nella sfera del web puro e semplice. Non credo che ci siano 'tecniche' che permettano di trasformare l'attivistino generico in un (dis)informatore di questo calibro; e - direi - per fortuna.

Il discorso e' diverso se riesci a manipolare i media perche' ad esempio ne sei il proprietario (vedi Fininvest dei bei tempi) o ne gestisci il CDA (vedi RAI lottizzata); in questo caso si puo' creare veramente una realta' manipolata, ma lo fai col controllo brutale delle informazioni da far passare o non far passare.

Se vuoi far passare questa idea **devi** anche credere che i medici siano tutti collusi con big pharma, gli scienziati tutti pagati per nascondere le scoperte, le invenzioni piu' innovative siano state fatte sparire, e cosi' via.

This is a silly response, you never said why it wasn't FIFAs problem in your first comment and barely followed on, so you're in no position to call me out on vagueness. Forgive me for not explaining everything to you detail by detail. 

I believe that FIFA should choose a host that is acceptable for the world cup, a host that is capable a host that will be welcoming to the tourists and a host where the world cup will mostly be beneficial for the locals. 

I believe that it is unfair that a struggling countries budget should be used to pay for stadiums and other facilities that are not needed, it is unfair to move people out of their homes for a sporting event, it is unfair to force thousands into slave labor or whatever the case may be.

The world cup should be a celebration of the beautiful game, it should be a joyous event for all people, it should not be literally built on the bodies of others (in some cases).

&gt;So?

FIFA is a non profit organisation

&gt; It's better for them to starve at home?

They wouldn't starve at home, or die in nearly the same numbers as they do building the cities in the scorching heat. FIFA should not (and thankfully you seem to agree) ally itself with a country like Qatar.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; This seems completely incompatible with NATO membership. This is a big if, but if Russia attacked Latvia do you think Germany would invoke its constitution to claim it can not intervene despite NATO Article 5?

Joining a military alliance is explicitly permitted in the constitution, even protecting stability in Europe is an explicit goal in regards to the armed forces (art. 24 (2)):

*With a view to maintaining peace, the Federation may enter into a system of mutual collective security; in doing so it shall consent to such limitations upon its sovereign powers as will bring about and secure a lasting peace in Europe and among the nations of the world.*

Even back when participation in *unarmed* UN missions still was a controversial political issue, the point people got hung up about was that it would be outside of NATO territory. I don't know of anything in the constitution that explicitly states that the Bundeswehr can only be used to defend German territory, and in fact extraterritorial missions have been common practice for years (although missions outside NATO require parliamentary approval).

You want to hold them accountable so *you* need a reason.

&gt;I believe that FIFA should choose a host that is acceptable for the world cup, a host that is capable a host that will be welcoming to the tourists 

Didn't hear about tourists having problems in Brazil?

&gt;and a host where the world cup will mostly be beneficial for the locals.

Again, you are lacking on the ""Why?"".

So? They don't need reserves?

They wouldn't? What would they do? Why did they come to Qatar in the first place? Probably didn't have work were they came from?

Communism promised emancipation to the people, and it motivated them. Soon enough, someone abused the name for their personal benefit, and voila -- behold the Soviet Union.

Besides calling themselves ""communist"" for some time before removing all mention of communism from the constitution, North Korean regime also named their country ""Democratic People's Republic"".

Yet, you do not point at North Korea and say ""this is what democracy and republicanism does to culture"".

Regarding Stalin specifically, here's what Lenin wrote about him in his testament:

&gt;Stalin is too coarse and this defect, although quite tolerable in our midst and in dealing among us Communists, becomes intolerable in a Secretary-General. That is why I suggest that the comrades think about a way of removing Stalin from that post and appointing another man in his stead who in all other respects differs from Comrade Stalin in having only one advantage, namely, that of being more tolerant, more loyal, more polite and more considerate to the comrades, less capricious, etc. This circumstance may appear to be a negligible detail. But I think that from the standpoint of safeguards against a split and from the standpoint of what I wrote above about the relationship between Stalin and Trotsky it is not a [minor] detail, but it is a detail which can assume decisive importance.
