Ask me bollix. One of the Dublin branches is going halal. The one on Shelbourne Road, Dublin 4. Anyone that knows Dublin, knows that area is 99% non muslim. I work in the area and it's very rare to see someone that's visibly Muslim. 

I don't know why the fuck they are going halal. Most of their customers would be 20-35 Irish office workers or students. A demographic who love their bacon (we consume the fifth highest amount of bacon in the EU).

I have a friend who's a die hard communist, I've had enough conversations with him to know more about actual communism than you seem to know about human nature. I'm sure that communism would work perfectly in a world only inhabited by copies of *you*, but not everyone in the world is willing to sacrifice their individual freedoms for the good of the group. More importantly, not everyone in the world cares about the good of the whole.

&gt;...when the vast majority of the population is benefiting, there's no reason they would want to compromise it.

You haven't met human beings before, have you?

&gt;You didn't prove anything. All you did is show me that you have no capability for abstract thinking or empathy.

My point still stands. You haven't lived somewhere that's been destroyed by far-left thinking. I'd rather work to fix what we have than take an even bigger risk than the Russians took a century ago.

&gt;There's a distinct difference between living in a society that encourages selfishness and exacerbates greed and one that focuses on community and sharing.

That comes from culture, not an economic model. You can force communism on a group of people that are culturally selfish and individualistic, and you'll still end up with people that are culturally selfish and individualistic. Unless of course you indoctrinate them for ""the greater good"".

&gt;For who? The homeless? The working class barely scraping by? Those living in the banlieues?

You know, there's such a thing as a flawed system that can be worked on. It's a much longer shot for the world to successfully implement communism than to simply put more center-left policies in place and work that out over time. Also, you don't have to risk another USSR happening.

I'm not some rich boy who's worried about his daddy having to pay too much in taxes. My family is actually over ten thousand dollars below the poverty line (California poverty line is at ~37,000 for the size of our family, we make ~24,000). I'm unhappy about the current system in place, and all that crap about ""hard work"" pisses me off, but I've also traveled enough and seen enough to know the inherent dangers of extremism, and despite the fact that you mean well by your beliefs, they're still undeniably extreme in a world such as ours.

* The piece suggests ousting Yanukovych was a coup by the US. This ignores the phone call leaked by ~~Russian intelligence~~ Ukrainian self-defense forces where a US official said ""fuck the EU"". She also said she needed to get Yanukovych to the negotiating table, and needed to get the UN there as soon as possible. I guess the self-defense forces should have edited that part out. 

* Crimeans ""overwhelmingly"" voted to become part of Russia. The illegal military occupation is oddly absent. 

* Those opposed to Yanukovych are neo-Nazis, anti-Semites, and far-right violent nationalists. 

* This situation was caused by the West trying to ""pull"" Ukraine into its sphere of influence, very clearly *not* because Ukrainians might have wanted the higher standard of living other ex-USSR nations have that leaned toward the EU. Although there is some evidence to suggest the EU agreement was somewhat one sided, I dont think that can be faulted for Ukrainians finally being fed up with Russian influence in their country. 

* It supports a referendum out East, but largely dismisses the fact the troops out East have a connection to Russia. It suggests not allowing a referendum is undemocratic. But I guess since the author thinks the Crimean referendum was so fair and balanced I can see why. 

* Russia's actual imperialism is dismissed as a counterweight to ""US imperial expansion"" that is ""welcomed from China to Brazil.""

A new and riskier heroism will be needed. It has been shown already by those Russians who oppose the nationalist passion of their own country and denounce it as a tool of power. It’s time for the basic solidarity of Ukrainians and Russians to be asserted, and the very terms of the conflict rejected. The next step is a public display of fraternity, with organisational networks established between Ukrainian political activists and the Russian opposition to Putin’s regime. This may sound utopian, but it is only such thinking that can confer on the protests a truly emancipatory dimension. Otherwise, we will be left with a conflict of nationalist passions manipulated by oligarchs. Such geopolitical games are of no interest whatever to authentic emancipatory politics.

true,cbr777,ROMA,Romania,"&gt;A study which I read stated that it would take about 3 billions per year from the state budget and they would catch up in about 10 years. Without any increased tax or anything of the sort. Also, I exaggerated when I said that I'm prepared to live in poverty. There won't be such drastic effects as I depicted.

Source of this study, because it smells like bullshit. You'd have to be naive to think it would only cost 3 billion euros per year. We couldn't even build a highway to Chisinau with that money.

&gt;Also, Germany's case it's totally different.

No, it's not.

&gt;First of all, East Germany's population was 16 million, while Moldova's population is 3.5 million.

West Germany's population in 1989 was 63 million, while Romania's population right now is 19 million. While the numbers are different, the %s are close enough.

&gt;So with a population that is 4.5 times smaller and a not very high economic level that Moldova needs to reach in order to catch up to Romania (as E. Germany needed in order to catch up with W. Germany), the costs cannot even be compared.

You're just talking out of your ass, have you ever been to Germany? East Germany specifically to talk like this? Well I have and except Berlin, there is no where in East Germany right now that is anywhere near the level of West Germany. 25 years after reunification east Germany still hasn't caught up to the western part.

Also you seem to think that the fact that Romania is much poorer than West Germany is a good thing, because Moldova wouldn't have as much to ""catch up"", but there are two problems with that absurdity. First if Romania is poorer than West Germany, it won't be able to have the same level of investment that west Germany had in East Germany, which means that even if that gap is ""smaller"" the length of time would be the same or greater. Second problem is that Romania won't be capable to sustain such a financial burden anywhere in the next 25-30 years without bankrupting itself.",0,1398919178,null,0,false,0,ch6n348,t3_24csrs,t1_ch6n348,t1_ch6ae16,null,1433600517,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

I want to give you a little bit of perspective. Ill assume you are a US citizen.

Although there are obviously thousands of places where war raged over the centuries in Europe and especially in Germany we tend to have a very different understanding of war sites then you night have. 
In contrast to sites like Gettysburg you wont find any famous battlesite where anyone would use words like heroic, celebrate famous armys vor generals.

War sites in Germany are either places of grief, guilt or generally based on the belief ""Never ever again"" (I assume you refer to WW-sites). Therefore all you will see are either sites that are very gruesome (like Verdun in France, which you can reach via train), sites that not many Germans would even consider to visit without having the feeling to be honoring all the wrong (Like Eagles Nest), or concentration camps (like Dachau).
The question alone seems to be a little awkward for most Germans.

Most other sites are probably very small consisting of a Statue to remember or a museum. I guess most Citys that have been destroyed have one. 

Ps: If you refer to older battles:

Frankfurt is such a modern city today because the bombs destroyed most of the old buildings. The inner city lost 90% of its buildings, in fact the history city was destroyed completely. There are still bombs found who didn't detonate, and then they evacuate a lot of people.

I have seen stones in the pavement on house fronts with names on them. These are the houses and names of jews who were deported and died in a KZ. They are all over the place, you just have to look.

The real threat is, of course, extremism. However the people who join these extremists are often in a personal situation that makes them easy targets for these kind of groups... so if they wouldn't join the extremists they would join groups such as e.g. the Neo-Nazis, hell even extremist Christians can be pretty violent to others.

So even IF we get rid of the Salafists: people will simply join different groups and all this shit is going to start all over again... what we really need to do is make sure that people don't become target for extremist groups in the first place, as well as having better integration for immigrants. The parents may still be salafists assholes, but we have to make sure they children don't become those.

Another reason why I think Islam is so ""violent"" right now: The heavy shift (in the entire world) away from religion towards atheism/secularity, especially in Europe. That makes conservatives accross all believes terrified, as lower religion means less and less power for religious authorities. Atheists also have the same morality as e.g. christians which in return makes them scared to become obsolete as a moral instance.

Si t'avais lu l'article, c'est exactement ce qu'ils disent à la fin:

&gt;&gt;Pourquoi la « nationalité » d’un jeu est difficile à établir

&gt;L’exemple de Dishonored, cité par le ministère, est emblématique : ce jeu « triple A » (avec un budget conséquent et distribué dans le monde entier) a été développé à Lyon par Arkane studio. Mais le jeu est édité par l’américain Bethesda, et entre donc dans le chiffre d’affaires de ce dernier.

&gt;A l’inverse, certains des grands succès d’Ubisoft n’ont pas été développés en France, mais au Québec, où Ubisoft dispose d’importants studios et emploie environ 3 000 personnes. C’est le cas par exemple d’Assassin’s Creed IV.

Outre le fait que non, les petits studios ne représentent pas une masse énorme ""une fois additionés"", comment tu comptes un studio installé en France mais appartenant à une holding anglaise et publié par un éditeur américain ?

Est-ce qu'on compte le CA ? Le nombre d'unité vendues ? La taille des studios, leur staff ? Bref, c'est pas un truc simple à chiffrer.

Ceci dit, je pense que la comm de cette affaire n'est pas de l'esbrouffe : le JV fait partie des trucs que la France (et/ou les français) font bien. Outre les studios qui sont dans l'hexagone, faut voir le nombre de français qui se sont expatriés aux US/Canada/Irlande/autres, où les lois sur le travail sont plus adaptées à la cadence du marché.",0,1398929151,null,0,false,0,ch6pt52,t3_24dopi,t1_ch6pt52,t1_ch6lyac,null,1433601801,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

What I've read though, says Islam is more proned of forceful conversion and intolerance towards other religions which I strongly oppose. Islam is also more extreme with policies such as wife beating, dehumanising women etc. Jews are also receiving a lot of threats and abuse from the Muslim immigrants here.

&gt; What's the best way to the city from the airport. Is there a train I could take or would it be to complicated with luggage and be better off taking a taxi?

Bit far, but the RER B (train) takes you to the city in no time (35 mins, the airport is that far), but there are some direct trains from the airport which don't stop in the intermediate stops). Luggage may be a problem if you have too much of it, so a taxi, while it can get really, really, expensive, isn't an option that's off the table. There's also an option by bus, I think by the Cars^(meaning bus in French) AirFrance (anyone can take them, they're not for AirFrance clients only) but they can also get expensive, although not as much as a taxi.

&gt; What are some good and affordable hotels. I'll more than likely be there 4 night May21-25

Paris is huge, any arrondissement is a whole city itself, so there isn't a list of good hotels (I'm sure there is but its subjective). Look up a bit yourself; Paris is a big city and most *good* hotels have good reviews or bad ones online. That being said, I highly recommend [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Paris--France?checkin=05%2F21%2F2014&amp;checkout=05%2F24%2F2014&amp;guests=2&amp;source=bb)^(the link is set for apartments on your dates for 2 people) as it can be potentially cheaper than a hotel!

&gt; What are some cool things for a married couple to do. I know we will go see the Eiffel Tower. And I already bought a Lock for the Love Lock bridge. Other than that I really don't know what to do. I would really appreciate any advice. Thanks.

For the love of God, **do not put a lock on the bridge**, those things are expensive to remove, look ugly and only damage the bridge. The bridge or Paris have nothing to do with any *Love Lock* crap ^(I think the original is in Rome, but even there, they hate it). 

As for married couple stuff, I can only recommend to buy the Eiffel Tower tickets online if you really want to go. It isn't anything too important you need to see comparing with a lot of other stuff you can do, which, as I'm but a lonely 18 year old student, I would have no idea what married coupled tourists do. 

In general, just be an intelligent tourist, not a dumb one; the French can be distasteful at times, sure, but a bit of French and they'll appreciate it greatly. Don't buy your metro tickets from anyone outside a counter without a uniform, try not to take taxis as they are really expensive (unless you really need to). Go to museums! The Louvre is the largest museum in the world, but there are so many other ones that are equally good! Something you can do that comes to my mind as ""*romantic*"" or couple-like is to go to a park (I recommend Buttes-Chaumont), buy a wine, some bread, cheese, and maybe a prosciutto and just eat it all there.",0,1398932505,null,0,false,0,ch6qe6g,t3_24fpnv,t1_ch6qe6g,t3_24fpnv,null,1433602075,6,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,6

&gt; **Satire in Aufklärung und Romantik**

&gt; Im Zeitalter der Aufklärung florierte die **Satire als didaktisches Mittel**, mit der die philosophischen und pädagogischen Ziele der Aufklärung befördert werden sollten. Die Kritik der Mächtigen blieb jedoch lange Zeit ausgespart; sicher vor allem aus Furcht vor Zensur. Die Satiren Gottlieb Wilhelm Rabeners etwa blieben „menschenfreundliche“ Kritik von Verstößen gegen guten Geschmack und Sittlichkeit.

&gt; Zugleich entfaltete sich das literaturtheoretische Interesse an der Satire. Johann Georg Sulzer etwa definierte die Satire nicht mehr über die Form, sondern über den Inhalt. Von ihr wird verlangt, dass sie Themen von sozialer Relevanz behandle, nämlich „jede im Verstand, Geschmack oder dem sittlichen Gefühl herrschende Unordnung“; damit gehört sie zu den wertvollen Mitteln, die der moralischen Besserung des Menschen dienen: „Der Endzweck der Satire ist dem Übel, das sie zum Inhalt gewählt hat, zu steuern, es zu verbannen, oder wenigstens sich dem weiteren Einreißen desselben zu widersetzen und die Menschen davon abzuschrecken.“ (Allgemeine Theorie der schönen Künste, 1771).

&gt; Gerade die Satire der Spätaufklärung übte aber auch scharfe Kritik an den Idealvorstellungen der Aufklärung. In Johann Karl Wezels satirischem Roman Belphegor ist es die Vorstellung, das Geschehen in der Welt folge einem rationalen Plan, die in aller Deutlichkeit widerlegt wird. Erfolg haben in Deutschland nun auch die Satiren von Jonathan Swift, die frühaufklärerische Ideale kritisieren: So persifliert A Modest Proposal (1729) die Vorstellung, rationale Überlegungen könnten der Linderung menschlicher Not dienen; in Gulliver's Travels (1726) bereist der Held einige Inseln, die Parodien auf gelehrte Theorien der Zeit darstellen.

true,_delirium,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; Furthermore, multiculturalism isn't really a thing, and it definitely isn't a thing in Europe like you might think it is in America

Traditionally it actually has been a pretty big thing in Europe, though not everywhere. Many big European cities only became monocultural fairly recently, especially in the central part of the continent. Many cities far from France used to use French as the lingua franca of business and commerce, specifically because the inhabitants of the city didn't share a common native language: their native languages might be some mixture of Italian, Croatian, German, Polish, Yiddish, Greek, Hungarian, Armenian, Lithuanian, Russian, etc., with proportions varying depending on the city and trade routes.

Cities also often had considerably different demographics than the countryside, e.g. you might have an area with a Croatian-speaking countryside but Italian-speaking urban areas. Or a Russian-speaking countryside but urban areas speaking mainly Greek/Armenian/Yiddish/French (like some of the Black Sea cities). Or a Lithuanian-speaking countryside but urban areas speaking mainly Yiddish/Polish (as was the case in Vilnius, for example). Evidence of former multiculturalism sometimes remains in names of neighborhoods; for example Vienna has a part of the city center named Griechenviertel (Greek quarter), because it used to be mainly populated by Greeks.

For the most part I see the emergence of Europe's ""monocultural cities"" in the 1914-1945 period as a fairly artificial bit of social engineering, not part of the continent's considerably more cosmopolitan *traditional* urban culture. It was only produced by forcibly moving around millions of people, just outright killing millions more, forcibly assimilating others, in order to produce some orderly set of cities where everyone has the ""right"" heritage, which was never previously or ""naturally"" the case.",0,1398933166,null,0,1398942018,0,ch6qhwq,t3_24dwi7,t1_ch6qhwq,t1_ch6qbix,null,1433602125,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

1. The airport is pretty far out from the city, as airports usually are, but it is easily accessible.
2. There's a train from the airport that leaves every like, 5 minutes, tops. It goes straight into the city, where you can transfer to any other train you'd like. I suggest, if you want to take the train, that you plan in advance your trip to your hotel to avoid getting lost and confused. Beware of pickpockets and bag-nappers. If you choose to take a taxi, beware of the fact CDG is way out, so the fare goes up fast.
3. Mercure is a good hotel line, not terribly expensive and the hotels are very nice and well located. If you're looking for really cheap, St-Christopher's Inn is a hostel-type place near Gare Du Nord, in central Paris, and its connected to Belushi's, a really cool bar/restaurant/sports bar that has cheap food, cheap drinks and people from everywhere that speak English. Since Gare Du Nord is right next to it, you have immediate access to essentially all of Paris.
4. As mentioned, don't go for Love Locks. The bridge looks like it'll collapse any moment. Repairs are constant and expensive, and honestly, there's no more space for any locks, it's completely full. For the Eiffel tower, try to do it on a weekday in the morning, to avoid queues and be able to enjoy the view peacefully. Also, the stairs barely ever have a lineup. As for other things you can go walk on Ile St-Louis, which is the island next to the Ile de la Cité, where Notre-Dame is (two birds one stone). Grab some ice cream, there are literally hundreds of flavors available. If possible, take a train to Versailles to see the palace and the area, it's beautiful and much more quiet than Paris. You can go to Montmartre, with the Sacré-Coeur basilica; to the Arc de Triomphe; Place (de la?) Concorde; Panthéon and area; the Louvre (plan at least an afternoon and evening, there's a lot to see); Musée d'Orsay; you can go to the observatory at the top of the Montparnasse tower; go down the small streets around St-Michel (see the fountain too!); there's a bunch of stuff to do. If you want to get REALLY romantic, there are loads of boat cruises available in the evening that generally manage to catch the tower sparkle. Some are simply seats on a boat, but others offer dinner and music. Most offer an audio tour in various languages.

The Police for example, which can charge you for insult when using ""Du"" instead of ""Sie"". Obviously not when you're struggling with the language, but it has happened. Rightfully so if I might add, since it can be insulting to have someone making it look like one is associating with him. For example, when asked by an obnoxious reporter a question adressed to ""Mr. Kohl"", he replied (roughly translated as): [""It's Doctor Kohl for you, I want to keep the distance"".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oINBasa8BXg) Although he said that out of spite towards the reporter, contrary to the article's point I think it a more formal approach is OK when keeping one's distance is called for. I don't want to be associated with some people, so I won't use ""Du"". Besides Englishmen do have a pseudo-formal form, when they use ""sir"". So all is well, just use ""Sie"" when in doubt and people will correct you to use ""Du"", if they want you to.

**Edit:** Besides other germanic languages use ""our"" system as well, e.g. Dutch where you can adress someone as ""u"" or ""jij/je"".

I'm not sure about that. Take the EU budget negotiations, in which the UK was part of an 11 strong coalition. In areas such as currency we often pair with Denmark and Sweden, in energy with Poland, in many other things with the Netherlands (that's one/two examples per area. I'm sure there's more countries as well). The major difference is historic. When France initially blocked UK entry part of the reason is the UK had a vision closer to Germany's and more distant from France's. We are still closer to Germany than France in this respect.

Its also interesting to note you say each nation has a different view of what the EU should be (meaning everyone opposes and supports different things), but France only sees fit to question the UK vision.

true,marmulak,KURD,Tajikistan,"I was born and raised in the US. I became Muslim and actually practice the religion, and I'm a fairly liberal guy. I'm not an unusual or abnormal Muslim--sometimes anti-Muslim polemicists dismiss average Muslims like me as being ""not really Muslim"" for being too normal, and their explanation is because I'm white or American or some idiocy like this. The problem with their assessment is that I have studied Islam extensively (not exhaustively, but extensively) and am actively engaged with the Muslim community at large, including Muslim intellectuals and everyday Yusuf six-pack Muslims. Many are immigrants, and many are born and raised where I lived.

Now I live in a Muslim majority country, and having experienced both sides of the coin (living within a minority Muslim community and living in a majority Muslim society) I can say confidently that life is totally normal and Muslims (and people) are pretty much the same no matter if you live in one part of the world or the other. To those who dislike or fear Muslims, we are disappointingly boring and average.

Personally it would not bother me at all if everybody in Europe or the US became Muslim. I also wouldn't really care that much, as I currently don't care about the fact that they aren't Muslim. Life would go on as usual. Maybe you wouldn't be eating pork or drinking alcohol, but honestly you can cry me a river on that one.

Europe will never die. All Europeans could change their religion, and they'd still be European. Also I've lived my life entirely outside of Europe, but I know about European culture and history because I got exposed to it a lot. Having seen plenty of both Europe and non-Europe, I tell you that Europe really isn't as unique or special as it thinks it is.

Because a commentary by a econ nobel prize winner in one of the worlds leading newspapers is properly described as *polemic* - just because you don't agree with him. I find it also funny how you seem to think that a business model that basically relies on the ability of fast supercomputers to make thousands of transactions per second based on ever lower value tresholds as somehow *beneficial* to the real economy. Especially since there are countless of these machines out there, reacting to each other decisions which in turn increases the volatility of these trades to very risky levels. This is not just a game, it is actually an exploit that is being used by a very small number of people, but it potentially affects everyone. 

Obviously you are not an economist and neither am I (even though I did study economy). So I find it slightly weird how you insist on scientific papers. But I guess learn from the global warming sceptics, right? 

So how about this: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1712765


&gt;We use the GM model as benchmark to introduce an HFT who due to her rapid execution and information processing ability is able to intermediate trades between LTs and PTs. The strategies used by HFTs to exploit the microstructure of price setting allows them to extract
trading surplus from market participants and hold essentially zero inventories over time. 

&gt;Our model departs from this premise and shows that the presence of HFTs increases the price impact of liquidity trades (in proportion to the size of the trade), and when HFTs successfully intermediate all trades they have no effect on the number of PTs, although they increase microstructure volatility, and increases trading volume. Thus, the presence of HFTs distorts market conditions, not through the amount of shares traded, but through prices. By exacerbating price impact, the HFTs induce additional market impact costs on participants,
especially the LT. This cost is proportional to the size of the trade which implies that large LTs, such as institutional investors trading to change the composition of a portfolio, are the most affected by the presence of HFTs–an effect that is consistent with Zhang [2010]’s findings. It is also consistent with a growing trend amongst such investors to move execution to off-exchange HFT-protected venues such as crossing networks and dark pools.
We show that the introduction of HFTs increases the microstructure noise around the fundamental value of the asset in two ways. First, the price impact of LTs is larger than in the absence of the HFT, and second, the instantaneous intermediation of the HFTs sees transactions fluctuate around market prices; this result is supported by the empirical work of Brunetti et al. [2011].

&gt;In the particular case we have analyzed, it is the LTs who bear all the costs from the presence of HFTs. LTs lose on two accounts: they lose trading surplus to the HFT, and they must offer a higher liquidity discount to PTs to get them to buy their shares. Moreover, in the
extreme case where HTFs successfully intermediate all trades PTs find themselves unaffected because the revenue they lose to the HFTs is compensated by a higher liquidity discount from LTs. This implies that overall, the effect of HFTs is to reduce the value of the stock market
as a forum for providing a way for investors to convert their equity into cash (and vice-versa) quickly and at a reasonable price. This is due primarily to the adverse effect of HFTs on prices (costs of execution). This value reduction would, in a more general framework, be passed on to the firms raising capital in equity markets.

So how religious were the Nazis exactly? Did they like study the Bible extensively and go to seminaries for religious education? Did they practice some kind of Biblical lifestyle?

Most damning to your argument is something he actually did:

&gt;During his career, and for a variety of reasons, Hitler made various comments against ""atheistic"" movements. He associated atheism with Bolshevism, Communism, and Jewish materialism.[122] In 1933, the regime banned most atheistic and freethinking groups in Germany - other than those that supported the Nazis.[123][124]

I actually looked through all the sources and funnily enough the vast majority of them saying he was an atheist are Christians. Could not possibly have an agenda here. Oh no.

And again, from Hitler's own mouth:

&gt;""And now Staatspräsident Bolz says that Christianity and the Catholic faith are threatened by us. And to that charge I can answer: In the first place it is Christians and not international atheists who now stand at the head of Germany. I do not merely talk of Christianity, no, **I also profess that I will never ally myself with the parties which destroy Christianity.** If many wish today to take threatened Christianity under their protection, where, I would ask, was Christianity for them in these fourteen years when they went arm in arm with atheism? No, never and at no time was greater internal damage done to Christianity than in these fourteen years when a party, theoretically Christian, sat with those who denied God in one and the same Government.""

This sort of anti-progress rhetoric in places like la Republique Francaise terrifies me. I would hope that this sort of opposition to quality of life for fiscal reasons would have largely been limited to the US (see the American GOP) and parts of Canada/UK but to find the inroads it has made into Sweden (!), the Netherlands (!!), and France (!!!) after centuries of Western tradition toward caring for one's neighbor and cousin is very disheartening.

What would probably be better when faced with a global economy that wants to destroy Western Europe would possibly be increased isolation. Trade in general is good but during existential crises when the global elite wants to destroy all hope of a better life for the average person and ""developing"" countries are doing everything in their power to drag the West down to their level there may be reason to clamp down on countries and ideologies that want to take France back to the Dark Ages and reverse the onward progress of reducing human suffering.",0,1398945553,null,0,false,0,ch6sj9x,t3_24fgls,t1_ch6sj9x,t1_ch6qm61,null,1433603153,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

It's pretty clear that Krugman's editorials are more akin to polemics rather than dispassionate academic writing.  He spends the first half of the article you linked to ranting about a tunnel.  I don't know what sort of papers you've been reading, but that is not what passes for academic writing in my field.

So, I stand by my assessment of Krugman's column as a polemic.

&gt; I find it also funny how you seem to think that a business model that basically relies on the ability of fast supercomputers to make thousands of transactions per second based on ever lower value tresholds as somehow beneficial to the real economy.

Why would you find that funny?  It is beneficial to the real economy.  Market liquidity ensures commodity producers always have a market for their goods, and speculation removes risk from those same producers and places it on the speculators themselves.

&gt; But I guess learn from the global warming sceptics, right?

Why are you so angry, you strange child?  I asked you to back up your claim with actual evidence rather than a newspaper column ranting about a tunnel being constructed, and now in your mind I'm akin to a global warming skeptic?

&gt;A Muslim teenager who joined rebels in Syria last year has been killed, it was revealed.Shamseddin Gaidan, 16, who lived near Dublin, died last week, a spokesman of the Muslim Association of Ireland said.

http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/02/23/irish-teen-shamseddin-gaidan-killed-syria-rebels_n_2749202.html

&gt;There is absolutely no problems with Islamic integration into our country and it is ignorant to suggest otherwise

MRSI Opinion Poll states different.

&gt;The majority (59 percent) of Irish Muslims disagree that ""people in Ireland should be free to say whatever they want, even if it offends other people's religious beliefs"". Though 35 percent agree. 37 percent of Irish Muslims would like Ireland to be governed as an Islamic state. Though 50 percent said they would not. The majority (57 percent) of young Irish Muslims (under 26) believe Ireland should become an Islamic State. 36 percent of Irish Muslims said they ""respect"" Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. 15 percent said they ""respect"" Osama Bin Laden. 11 percent said they ""respect"" Mullah Omar.

&gt;And I suppose it's such a terrible thing for an Egyptian to go back to Egypt and be politically involved, too?

Politically involved with the Muslim Brotherhood? Who their father, an Imam at Clonskeagh Mosque, has close links with?

The Halawa family have lied again and again about their childrens arrest. They have been telling one lie after another. The brother was 'badly beaten' - the Turkish ambassador meets him and says it is untrue. They went to the Mosque for safety - we now we have seen videos of them joining in armed protests. They were far from innocent tourists that just got caught up in the upheaval. They were the ones causing it.

&gt;And I can't believe you're referencing the MarkHumphry's site, it's the most Islamaphobic, racist, bigoted, insulting website I've ever seen on the internet in relation to Ireland. Seriously if that's the shit you're believing you can go fuck yourself.

true,marmulak,KURD,Tajikistan,"&gt;Enough to have religious slogans like 'God is with us'. Like it or not, the Holocaust was as much a crusade as it was a genocide.

US prints ""In God We Trust"" on all of its money, although the last time I checked we don't have a theocracy. These are just slogans to try to capture some of the credibility that religion lends. The Nazis likewise paid lip service to Christianity, and introducing religious studies in schools was part of that, although there is no evidence that the Nazis took Christianity very seriously or held a genuinely Christian worldview. The Nazis were mainly concerned about a racist German national identity, and being Christian was just a small part of what they thought it meant to be a pure German. Meanwhile the Nazis had significant interest in Germanic paganism, as being German was more important to them than being Christian.

Of course even if the Nazis weren't sincerely Christian, you could say that the identity politics that they were playing were a result of *other people* being Christian or having a Christian identity. It seems that the problems in this situation is that people were not being Christian in principle, but rather in name only.

Also, I am not denying that Christianity itself contains Antisemitism, but there is a difference between the Bible and Christianity. Like I mentioned earlier, the Bible as a text was primarily authored by Jewish people, including Jesus' disciples. One can even presume that the disciples of Jesus did not believe in Christianity as we have it today; the Council of Nicea was some three hundred years after Jesus. Antisemitism may have Christian origins, but Antisemitism is completely out of place in Biblical times. There is no evidence that Jesus and his disciples hated Jews or Judaism (if anything Jesus was simply trying to reform the Jewish community to be closer to the spirit of Judaism), and the Old Testament (the bulk of the Bible) was written before Jesus was born.

Even if Hitler had been a christian (he wasn't), it would be stupid to say ""christianity caused the Holocaust"", the same way it is stupid to say ""Atheism caused 20 million deaths in USSR, 40 millions in China and who know how many in Cambodia and North Korea"".

No. Because atheism holds no motivation. It is as much a motivator as not participating in golf. On the other hand Christianity can easily inspire and motivate things like anti-Semitism and has done so repeatedly throughout history.

&gt;The fact that you do not quote any of these sources makes me doubt of your honesty. Besides your argument is worthless as it can be easily reversed: you're a militant atheist saying he was christian. Could not possibly have an agenda. Oh no.

I'm staying true to the facts. And it's amusing to me that criticising religion and not buying historical revisionism is what is militant for an atheist. Militant Christian gives you a far different picture.

&gt;Which only shows the atheistic nature of the Nazi party.

This is a ludicrous conclusion to draw from that. It shows the *totalitarian* nature of the Nazi party. If their agenda was atheism they would not go inquisition against the other movements.

&gt;So what do you think is closer to the truth ? What he says in a public speech which only aim is to gather support from a heavily christian population ; or the diaries of his closest and most trusted advisors (and no, Gerhard Engel wasn't close to Hitler) ?

I think it is far more closer to the truth than Christian revisionism, yes. And besides, you see the very nature of his attitude towards the church in the speech I gave to you and the quotes you gave me. It is not an atheist agenda as you seem to believe: It's an inquisition. He wanted to purify the Church.

&gt;Last but not least, the Catholic Church openly denounced Nazism with the Mit brennender Sorge encyclical in 1937.

&gt;Archbishop Robert Runcie has asserted that: ""Without centuries of Christian antisemitism, Hitler's passionate hatred would never have been so fervently echoed...because for centuries Christians have held Jews collectively responsible for the death of Jesus. On Good Friday Jews, have in times past, cowered behind locked doors with fear of a Christian mob seeking 'revenge' for deicide. Without the poisoning of Christian minds through the centuries, the Holocaust is unthinkable.""[26]

&gt;I don't know, maybe it creates a cognitive dissonance in your mind to acknowledge that monsters can be atheists too and that atheism isn't a seal of fairness.

No. Here's the deal: I fully acknowledge some historical figures were atheist and monsters, but what I do not recognize is something as nonsensical as atheism leading them to do terrible things. That's what you are saying when you say 'but atheists can do it too'. Yes, atheists can do horrible things as well but they do them for different reasons that religious ones.

Stalin was very clearly an atheist, but he did not do his actions because of atheism. There's nothing in atheism leading a person to do such because atheism consists of nothing.

The Nazis very much wanted to purify Christianity and it comes to light in many of Hitler's speeches when he talks about how corrupt the current Church is. It was not at all live and let live. Christianity was part of the agenda. In fact all the hate for the Jews was built by the Church.

&gt;“I have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.” - Hitler, April 26, 1933.

PS: I have no problem with churches being tax exempt. Most churches do help the poor. The problem is when church are automatically classified as charity just because they are religious institutions.

PPS: Aside from the words ""under god"", there is a problem with actually the whole pledge of allegiance: the fact that you have to say it. That's, again, imposing American culture upon others.

All countries with industries are protective of those industries... :-) In many respects UK and EU securities laws are more extensive than in the US or elsewhere.

&gt;  There are ways to curb destructive HFT besides a FTT.

In what way is HFT destructive?

&gt; For instance if all press releases for publicly traded companies were released through a regulator, it would mitigate much of the advantages companies see from things like server colocation that might allow them to get information a fraction of a second faster than other market players. 

This is already pretty much the case in the UK. All inside information must be disclosed initially by a service licenced by the regulator.  

&gt; You might have better grounds for the opinion since you live there, but this tax seems like it might be rocket fuel for UKIP if it is implemented. 

It is still early days and there is still a lot of detail to be discussed about this tax. But if it ends out harming the UK disproportionately, then the city are going to turn against the EU.

Granted, those are fairly large trades, but when you look at institutional investors they typically do larger trades and hold them for a while. 

If you're investing people's retirements it disincentivizes moving out of bad assets as well.

Yes it does. It simply means *without theism*. The only thing atheist activists are doing is to preserve their right not to believe in anything. Atheists have been persecuted for centuries in case you have forgotten.

HFT is basically just using your low-latency access to act on knowledge of trades and orders before the others can.

Insider trading laws are about protecting against people using a advantageous position to the disadvantage of other participants. In that way, HFT is really close to it.

&gt;""How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property‹either as a child, a wife, or a concubine‹must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities. 

Weston's version leaves out this next line:
&gt;Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the Queen; all know how to die; but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. 

Skips to here:
&gt;No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science‹the science against which it had vainly struggled‹the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.""

This is the second trip I have made to Frankfurt. My girlfriend's grandmother lives there and she has been roughly 15 times. My first trip was filled with food and culture. Riding trains to unknown places, trying food, cheap wine, beer, etc. Most people didn't understand why I didn't see more things. I actually enjoyed pretending I lived there for a week as I walked around doing similar things to what I would be doing at home. Sitting in the outdoor cafes and reading as hundreds of people walked by are some of my favorite memories. Her neighbors also took us out to Braubach for the weekend harvest festival. Actually, that is my favorite memory. All the wine and buildings and people and music. Loved it. I grew up around farming communities and it was fun to see the differences and similarities.

This time I am trying to travel a bit more and see things I could never see growing up on the prairie in the middle of the US. The vague ""war sites"" was meant to be vague. Anything from Romans to WWs would be up for a response. I assure you, I meant no offense. My step-grandfather was in WW2 and has really only talked about the countryside. (I'm 35 so you know that isn't made up). He always talked about the plots of land separated by shrubs and rock walls that were probably hundreds of years old. He was a farmer here and it was so foreign to him. I guess I was hoping to walk around some of these areas on trails to try and get a touch of realness to both his stories and the history I've grown up with. I can see how the question could lead people to think the way they have. My fault and apologies.

I am not sure you will see this happen. That is a popular argument, but that isnt how these taxes typically work. Either way, I think certain funds should be tax exempt.

On the other hand the problem hasn't really dissapeared enough to be disregarded by many. At the very least related factions have died down somewhat like the militant animal protectionists who would harrass and attack facilities where tests were done on animals or fields where GMO's where test run.

I certainly wouldn't say in many respects. The EU is pretty much the most lax developed market. It is fairly easy to avoid disclosure in the EU, and almost impossible in other jurisdictions, including the US. That is why Japan will allow automatic cross-listings in Tokyo of SEC issuances, but not EU one passport issuances. 

&gt;In what way is HFT destructive?

Not all, but some. For instance the flash crash in 2010 (US) was largely because of computerized sell offs. The Dow Jones lost roughly 1000 points, its largest single day drop after a mutual fund sold a large volume of S&amp;P futures. In 2013 the Associated Press' twitter account was hacked, and a tweet about the white house being attacked caused another, similarly sized, massive sell off by HFT traders. The thing is, this tax would likely not have stopped either of these occurrences. 

&gt;All inside information must be disclosed initially by a service licenced by the regulator.

Its a good first step, but I think extending this to all press releases for publicly traded companies would be beneficial. That way there would be no doubt that any trader got information before others. 

&gt;It will be spun as an attack by the EU on the UK.

Definately not. Mannheim like all bigger cities in Germany has an international flair and tons of people from all over the world study at Mannheim University. 

&gt; Do you have any suggestions on where I might make friends?

For what reason do you move to Mannheim? Depending on what you do here during your 3 months you'll probably have enough opportunities to make friends.

&gt; Any tips for avoiding looking like an obvious American and blending in during my stay?

You won't be the first American here. Kaiserlautern is about a 45 minutes to the east and is home to the biggest American community outside the United States. I think about 50.000 Americans live there and make trips to Mannheim and Heidelberg frequently. Mannheim is about halfway between Heidelberg and Kaiserslautern.

&gt; Are there any don'ts that you can think of?

Nope.  

&gt; I am taking some German language lessons but I will not have much proficiency by the time I arrive. Do you think that this will pose a problem?  

Shouldn't be a problem even if you have to fallback to English every once in a while.
 
&gt; Travel: What are some easy and affordable ways to get the most out of traveling while I am there? 

Just take the train. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine-Neckar_S-Bahn

There will be an S-Bahn leaving for Heidelberg or towards Kaiserlautern almost every 30 minutes.

&gt; Any suggestions on must-sees/locations?

You should visit Heidelberg once. It's very touristy but the old part of the city is nice. You could also visit Frankfurt, which also only about 40 minutes away if you take the train. You might want to go to France/ Weißembourg (a small picturesque town just behind the border). It's a 1:30h train ride. Karlsruhe is a city slightly bigger than Mannheim and roughly 20 minutes away. If you like looking at old stuff you could go to Speyer (30 minutes), which is one of our oldest cities in Germany and the Speyer Cathedral is bruial site for lots of kings and emperors from the Holy Roman Empire.

&gt; Food: Any suggestions for places to dine or dishes to try while over there? How is the currywurst?

You can get a really good currywurst in Mannheim here:

true,cbfw86,UKGB,"Class clown, est. 1985","&gt;Then why would he go out of his way to purify the church and make his own?

He was an opportunist who used every tool at his disposal to garner support and whip people up into a fury. The lowest hanging fruit in organisational control is religion, which preaches as virtues humility and unquestionable fervour and fealty to authority. Politics invites debate, religion silences it. Of course a power-hungry lunatic would want to purify the Church so that it fitted his aims of dictatorship. I thought that would be completely obvious. Sometimes the simplest answer is the correct one.

&gt; the entire basis for the Holocaust is grounded in Christianity.

Where are you even getting that from? I mean, we could even have a debate about whether or not he even came up with the Final Solution or if it was his subordinates and he didn't learn about it until it was under way.

Nonetheless we have evidence to suggest that the scapegoating of minorities is caused not by religion but by economic hardship. Or am I supposed to believe that Christian Country^TM Britain is on the UKIP warpath because of Jesus? Is /r/europe's fervid hatred of Roma an ideological issue of 'whites are just better' or an socioeconomic one of 'their way of life competes with our social contracts and risks unwelcome changes to our way of life'? Germany was in a depression caused by reparations for WW1. Jewish money lenders were filthy rich. It was the combination or economic difficulty for Germans and the inequality between working class Germans and wealthy Jews which caused the rise of anti-Semitism.

&gt;The attempt to make him seem like an atheist is nothing but a revisionist attempt by Christian scholars to put distance between him, their own past and to vilify atheists.

It's a conspiracy. We are oppressed. It has nothing to do with new views on history in light of recent studies. History should be written in stone and never revisited. Now where did I put my tinfoil pasta strainer?

&gt;He didn't have to lie.

So how do you account for his blatant misinterpretation of scripture, saying that Christ was a fighter when he was nothing of the kind? Either you take a Christian view that he was the Son of God and preached love and redemption though meekness and love unfeigned or you take a secular view that he was a opportunistic social revolutionary who abused the Messianic Hope to further his own political motivations. But there is little evidence (admittedly there is some but it is scant in comparison to the rest) that he preached hatred and damnation. Taking the words of the guy who said, 'love your enemies, do good to those that hate you,' and, 'Greater love hath no man than this, than he that layeth his life down for his friends,' and forgiving adulterous women in an age of rampant misogyny, and then accusing that guy of being a slighted warrior king who was beaten by the same guys he came to destroy (**w**hen you believe he was God, to boot) just smacks of the most convoluted interpretation of Christ I've ever heard. Hitler's view of Christ made no sense whatsoever. And to say that he was a Christian and that that was the motivation for the killing of 6 million innocents is just as dogmatic as the people you claim are wrong when you are right.

The simplest anwser is the most correct? Yeah ok, and the simplest observation here is that this guy considered himself above others (the exact opposite of what Christ taught), to the tune of starting a war out of a sense of entitlement and conceit. There is no reason to believe that Hitler was at all devout or otherwise devoted to a love of Christ in his motivations, or to interpret it as anything other than lip service. Just because he didn't *have* to lie doesn't mean that he undoubtedly didn't.",0,1398961582,null,0,1398961850,0,ch6yfqy,t3_24ff5u,t1_ch6yfqy,t1_ch6xjlo,null,1433605933,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

&gt;**EGIZIANO A PASSEGGIO NUDO IN TRENO FERMATO DALLA POLFER DI NOVI**

&gt;Novi Ligure (AL) – Pare che nell’ottavo secolo la città di Novi sia stata fondata dagli arabi (poi colonizzata dai genovesi), e non deve stupire che oggi, a distanza di oltre mille anni, i ricorsi storici vedano i magrebini farla da padroni in città. Se sabato scorso si è verificato in pieno centro l’ennesimo duello rusticano fra due di loro per una donna contesa, finiti all’ospedale per reciproche ferite inferte con coltello e coccio di bottiglia, stavolta un egiziano di 23 anni residente a Novi, salito a Genova sul treno per Alessandria, ha pensato bene di camminare nudo tra gli scompartimenti per il sicuro piacere, date le dimensioni ragguardevoli del suo attributo sessuale messo in offerta, di bulicci e femmine scarsamente illibate. Si è denudato poco prima della stazione di Arquata per entrare, annunciando ad alta voce il suo avvento, negli scompartimenti mentre si toccava le parti intime. Ma a Novi, quando è sceso dal treno per tornare a casa (nel frattempo si era rivestito) ad attenderlo c’erano gli agenti della Polfer che erano stati avvisati telefonicamente dal capotreno. Lo hanno denunciato per atti osceni in luogo pubblico. Per la banca dati nazionale del Ministero dell’Interno si tratta di un personaggio noto alle forze dell’ordine, già sottoposto al provvedimento di espulsione dall’Italia. Ma da noi ha trovato ospitalità.

There's three major problems I see with Islam and Europe.  Two are about how Islam works in a formal sense.  For one, Muslims are promised that they will rule the world one day.  So the fact that it hasn't come to pass yet is a source of bewilderment and frustration.  Secondly, Islam views civil law as being less important or valuable as Islamic law.  ""How could the laws of man be superior to the laws of God"" might be their concern.

The other issue has to do with how Europe (and most countries) work in an informal manner.  Europe likes to promote progressive and open ideas about acceptance of other cultures, peoples, etc.  But there is still a real and palpable sense of racism that Muslims might feel, particularly those who are 2nd generation Europeans.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; I certainly wouldn't say in many respects. The EU is pretty much the most lax developed market. It is fairly easy to avoid disclosure in the EU, and almost impossible in other jurisdictions, including the US. That is why Japan will allow automatic cross-listings in Tokyo of SEC issuances, but not EU one passport issuances.

What kind of disclosure can be avoided in the EU? It surprises me somewhat that Japan has not granted equivalence to the EU, but this might be because the EU has not granted equivalence to Japan?

&gt;  For instance the flash crash in 2010 (US) was largely because of computerized sell offs. The Dow Jones lost roughly 1000 points, its largest single day drop after a mutual fund sold a large volume of S&amp;P futures. In 2013 the Associated Press' twitter account was hacked, and a tweet about the white house being attacked caused another, similarly sized, massive sell off by HFT traders.

Without HTF, there might also have been large sell-offs though, perhaps slightly slower? And sell-offs of themselves are not really harmful: sell-offs are an inherent risk for all markets. Also, without HTF, there would be reduced liquidity and this would have a pricing impact.

&gt; Its a good first step, but I think extending this to all press releases for publicly traded companies would be beneficial. That way there would be no doubt that any trader got information before others.

&gt; 'The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live.

&gt; 'A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity.

&gt; 'The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property – either as a child, a wife, or a concubine – must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.

&gt; 'Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it.

&gt; 'No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith.'

Whenever you're trying to figure out something, let's say a personality dimension, you develop a questionnaire that actually measures said dimension. In the questionnaire you include at least five (5) questions pertaining to said dimension, but 10 questions is more common. Now, because you want to account for socially acceptable answering, it's usual to include a counter to each question. That counter is some ways down from the original to disguise it. 

For example, 'I enjoy going to parties with a lot of people' could be counterbalanced by 'I enjoy reading a book' some ways down the questionnaire (preferably on the next page). You will also ask similar questions, where the subject is changed. 

Please note: I made up these questions, so the example will not be 100%. Since most if not all serious questionnaires have to be paid for, I can't simply copy those questions. What you could do is take a look at some pseudoscientific questionnaires, such as the Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator, which actually does a pretty good job of counterbalancing everything. Disregard how you'd answer the questions, just read them carefully and try to find the counter to it. Every question has one in their MBTI.

Yes, it's a bit strange, since we were quite similar. The Swedish social-democrat's policies were once copied by the other Nordic countries. I'm not sure exactly what changed, or if it was always a little different. 

The Swedes have a higher degree of urbanization and clear differences in regional politics, language matters etc. Perhaps it's related to their empire, maybe some sort of guilt.

Because of them many educated people avoid buying BMWs not wanting to be associated with that type of guys. In Romania a civilized BMW driver is more rare than diamonds. 

Moreover, there are 2 types of cocalari : rich gypsy shady which usually have a passion for black or white BMWs X6 and poor ones who own 20 years old BMWs registered in Bulgaria (mostly Ruse, Varna and that city with TX on car plates) because of the high taxes in Romania for old cars.

Doesn't matter. Some states are still backwards.

&gt; For good reason, unliek you guys the Americans don't have kings queens and state churches.

1) Kings and Queens in our countries are simbolic and only meant to atract dumb American tourists. There, I said it.

2) State churches?

3) How many Bush's have been president? 2. Another one is on the way: Jeb Bush. If Hillary Clinton wins in 2016, boom, 2 Clintons. Is it just coincidence?

At the federal level, you're right, there isn't. I was referring to some states that have school prayer, in the south of the country.

You don't have to say it, but you must choose not to say it. That's where peer pressure and pressure from teachers and parents come in. As a child, you aren't physically forced to say it, you are psychologically forced to say it because the consequences of not saying it (exclusion and discrimination) are worse than actually saying it (losing dignity).

&gt; Come si vede dal video, non appena ha manifestato segni di crisi l’atleta è stato subito affiancato da un volontario della Protezione civile. Il volontario era pronto a soccorrere Magut e l’ha più volte invitato a fermarsi. Nel momento in cui ha allertato l’assistenza sanitaria, questa è intervenuta tempestivamente con un’ambulanza nella quale era presente un medico rianimatore. Magut voleva proseguire anche dopo essere stato soccorso dopo l’ultima caduta, ma i sanitari, come previsto dal regolamento Iaaf, gli hanno impedito di continuare. Portato all’ospedale di Padova per accertamenti, Magut è stato dimesso alle ore 16 con una diagnosi di crisi ipoglicemica e disidratazione. L’atleta è rientrato in albergo già nel pomeriggio e, a dimostrazione della ritrovata miglior condizione, ha pranzato regolarmente».",0,1398967673,null,0,false,0,ch71dje,t3_24eqv5,t1_ch71dje,t1_ch6ptnp,null,1433607383,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

Lot's of mountainbiking going on around there as well, however I don't know about those routes.

Also, for some sightseeing and getting to know your way around the city, try the 60km ""green ring"" (anillo verde) around the city. Do be advised that it's far from safe for anything resembling serious road cycling.

I'm arguing that gambling might feed an addictive behavior that people might be predisposed towards, and that therefore, gambling falls into a different category of activities and that negative connotations are rightfully associated with gambling.

Then where does the money for the HFT trader's fancy car come from? It's not money that either the baker or the investor sees, both of which obviously provided something of value.

&gt;The fact that the HFT trader is another market participant lowers the price of the investment (and the cost of capital), benefiting the bakery. 

How on earth would this work? ""The cost of capital"" is in fact the amount of money the bakery raises when seeking investment. So really, a middleman like a HFT trader manages to make an investor pay more and a company receive less, taking the difference for themselves through arbitrage.

&gt;If HFT was actually harmful, shouldn't it just be made illegal, rather than simply taxing all trading including low frequency trading? 

Maybe. A small tax like the one described has the advantage of discouraging some other methods of profiting from gaming the system like short selling.

Either the BND voilated our basic law by supporting them or by keeping it secret. If they didn't keep it secret and informed the government then the government itself voilated basic law.

That's really far-fetched. The government has just made it up, just because *one* big editor is half-French doesn't make us a leader. We're completely dwarfed by the US and Japan. Besides, it's the studios that count, and we hardly have more of them than other big European countries.

(Seriously, if you want to argue that France is relevant choose meaningful facts, like our many huge multinational corporations, or our military bases. You could find similar ""first at something"" factoids for any other country.)

France *used to be* a superpower. Now it is still important but our influence and predominance are fading because they were based on our empire which no longer exists and our technological and developmental advance which is diminishing. Our only way of countering that is to form a country big enough to compete with the world's current and future superpowers.

&gt; Respecting the law which states that religion shouldn't be subsidised.

That's not what it means. Financing places of worship is legal and encouraged (to guarantee that all beliefs are represented). See [this](http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070169&amp;dateTexte=20080306) (article 19, last sentence). All the churches in the recent cities around Paris were built after the law was adopted with public funding, all the churches of France are maintained with public money, even the recent ugly ones. But when it's catholics, nobody complains...

That being said, selling a public building to a religious organisation is by no mean a subsidy.

&gt; Not selling it is just a normal decision to make it benefit to everyone instead of only a religious minority.

Same if the state is under high threat of an attack, conscripting people temporarily to maintain your peoples freedom and to scare off potential invaders is acceptable again but more of a gray area but as long as its only a temporary measures theres nothing that wrong with it.

However once you reach countries where theres permanent conscription where people are just forced to join the military then it is starting to tread the line of ""slavery""; if the country is invaded in wars that are not waged for self defence then it is arguably slavery since you are forcing people to fight for something they may not even believe in with no benefit for them or their family.

Rappers don't gamble. Rappers have money because they provide a form of entertainment that many people are willing to pay for. It's not quite like slaving away in an office 9 to 5, but it's not exactly ""little effort and no real work"" either.    

&gt;They spend money on jewellery and flashy cars    

Again, so what? As long as they're not doing illegal stuff with their money, who are we to tell them how to use it? And unlike gamblers, they actually earned this money.

Everything depends on energy. What this chart shows is that Poland managed to increase productivity to roughly keep up with enormous rises in energy prices.  
At the same time, wealth accumulates (private and public - like roads) and increasing portion of income comes from investments (which isn't reflected in average wage), so life is indeed much better for Poles.  

The slightly declining or roughly-constant standard of living is the case everywhere for some time now, except in really poor countries. The increases in efficiency in most industries are very small, the only major exception is semiconductors manufacture.

Wouldn't this be in past tense? So instead of ""our hotel is located.."" it would mean ""our hotel was located...""

No, it's present tense. Past tense would be: ""Unsere Pension **war** ... gelegen.""

I see why you might suspect it could be present perfect, but 'gelegen' simply is an adjective here, not a present perfect as 'ist gelegen'.

The literal English translation for it would be: Our pension **is located** ... while 'Unsere Pension **war**... gelegen' would be 'Our pension **was located**...'

The tricky aspect comes, when you compare it to 'Unsere Pension ist dort gewesen', which would be present perfect ('Our pension has been there'). 'Ist gewesen' is present perfect, while 'ist gelegen' is simply present tense.

&gt;Also ""Kitesurfen sieht gefährlich aus, zumindest gefährlicher als lesen! Gestern sind wir am Strand entlang geritten""
In this sentence (and others) I am not quite sure of this word ""aussieht"", I know now it just means ""looks"". What is the difference from what I wrote before? Also, why ""zumindest"" instead of ""mindestens""?

Let me start with the latter. Both 'zumindest' and 'mindestens' mean 'at least'. But there's a difference. I'd have to think about it some more to see if that's entirely true, but I'd say that, at least most of the time, 'mindestens' comes before numbers or something other, that is quantifiable. - 'Mindestens drei Bananen', 'mindestens zwei Stunden', 'mindestens 20000 Zuschauer'... 'Zumindest' is more about the quality of something. 'Ich bin zumindest bis nach Dortmund gekommen', 'Man sollte zumindest davon gehört haben', 'Er hat zumindest ordentliche Deutschkenntnisse'. Actually, this isn't only my 'Bauchgefühl'. Duden Online and Wiktionary confirm this.

http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/mindestens

http://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/mindestens

For the first question:

The difference between 'sehen' and 'aussehen' is the following: 'to look' has two meanings in English. One is to look in the sense of directing your vision towards something (I'm looking at you).

Yeah and why? Because we have the 5% barrier... Without it the FDP, Pirates and adf would be in the parliament (which I actually think would be fine), but maybe even the NPD, Feie Wähler and Tierschutzpartei. Suddenly 7-10 parties. Want a majority on the right? CDU/CSU, FDP and AfD might have to work together. On the left? SPD, Greens, The Left and the Pirates would have to find common ground. Right now you have still the solution of a grand coalition, but imagine people knew beforehand that their party stands a chance, suddenly parties like the Renter Partei might be able to get 1-2% and take CDU voters away. A party that stands for Christian values (against abortion etc.) might be able to get a seat. Also a party like the SPD could split up pro-grand-coalition and against-grand-coalition, suddenly that might then not even be a option anymore.

&gt; I just wonder: how is it democratic if millions of people who did go and vote in an election have absolutely no representation in the parliament that is formed?

1) Individual prices appeared lower.

After adding all items the sum of the weekly purchase will be higher as before (but you also bought more).

2) Customers often bought better quality products at higher prices. Again an example for Lithuania. 

Low quality product 6,99 LTL or 2,02 Euros

High quality product 7,99 LTL or 2,32 Euros

Before some people might have refused to pay an extra LTL for a better product (e.g. ""organic eggs""). After the exchange the 30 cents extra appear not as high and customers might change to the high quality product.

If the countries really bad enough that people aren't willing to defend it conscription won't matter because unless they are fighting an enemy that actually wants to exterminate your people (such as the Nazi's with the Soviets) you will end up with extremely low morale, desertion and mass surrender making it a moot point anyway.",0,1398980862,null,0,false,0,ch77rde,t3_24gsws,t1_ch77rde,t1_ch77lgx,null,1433610461,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

If it weren't for it, our economies virtually wouldn't exist. Don't compare Italy to the rest though, they'd be rich anyway. 

Russia is now in recession due to EU and US embargoes. 

Also those other countries are rich and have free trade agreements with their nearest neighbours, not with the rest of the world. For example in New Zealand getting anything from Europe or America is a nightmare and super expensive.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; You don't die if government accountants fuck up your taxes. Furthermore, on the note of taxes, everyone already pays for the security the military provides, so it's not like the general population is not contributing to general security.

I pay around 20 to 30k euros in taxes per year. If I include pension contributions then it is approx 30 to 45k. Instead of paying that money in taxes, I could take one years vacation, do nothing. So who does that differ from conscription, government takes one year worth of my time every year... From my point of the only difference is that instead of being called Private, I'm called Mr. Senior Consultant.

&gt; Furthermore, on the note of taxes, everyone already pays for the security the military provides, so it's not like the general population is not contributing to general security.

Equipment is only a small part of the overall expenses. In case of country like Finland either we are going to pay for a standing army of somewhere around 50k to 100k to be ready to fight against an possible invasion or we are going to have an conscription based army that can be assembled and put to fight quickly if needed.

And before you start with, ""see you can just pay for the defense, everything can be voluntary"", then I have to make note that armies that are professional armies like the US army, the people who fight the wars come mostly from lower income segments of the society. Joining the army for many of them is ""voluntary"". A conscription based army is much more equal, everybody needs to contribute and anyone can be on harms way.

Not to mention that Machiavelli had many excellent points about professional armies that are still true even today. A conscription based army is more loyal to the country and nation that it serves than a professional standing army. 

&gt; Conscripts are nothing other than fodder in a real war. If you want your country defended you'll raise taxes and buy proper equipment, not inject more bodies into the meat grinder.

You can't never ever replace foots in the ground with equipment.
