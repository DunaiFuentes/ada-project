Ukraine uses same old stuff. Even Finland has that same gun. And this picture was from Sevastopol and Russia has a Naval Base and military shit all over that area which is legally leased from Ukraine:

&gt;On April 27, 2010, Russia and Ukraine ratified the Russian Ukrainian Naval Base for Gas treaty, extending the Russian Navy's lease of Crimean facilities for 25 years after 2017 (through 2042) with an option to prolong the lease in 5-year extensions. The ratification process in the Ukrainian parliament encountered stiff opposition and erupted into a brawl in the parliament chamber. Eventually, the treaty was ratified by a 52% majority vote—236 of 450. The Russian Duma ratified the treaty by a 98% majority without incident.[26]

There's also the whole thing about immigrants never really losing their status as foreigners in the eyes of many Germans, even if they have been here for decades and have assumed German citizenship. Later generations aren't exempt from this either. 

Just to name one example, many of my German friends of Turkish ancestry identify more with Turkish culture than they do with Germany, even though some of their families have been here for three generations. Unlike in Canada, immigrants and ethnic minorities in general seem reluctant to self-identify as German, and this is in large parts due to many ""real"" Germans being unwilling to accept them as such. I wouldn't even call it xenophobia or anything like that, it's probably more of an unconscious thing. Most Germans may not have a problem with black or asian people living in Germany or becoming German citizens, but to think of them as ""true"" Germans is probably something that wouldn't even occur to them.

A coup d'état is considered successful when the usurpers establish their dominance. When the coup neither fails completely nor succeeds, a civil war is a likely consequence.

Yeah, no, it doesn't fit the definition when civilian protesters get the elected Parliament to impeach the President. That's then known as a ""revolution"".

What happened in Egypt? When the military removed Morsi? *That* was a coup.

&gt;Che schifo, che idioti.

Secondo me non ti rendi conto della polemica che traspare dalle tue parole (quando non è evidente come in quest'ultimo caso), però dall'esterno si avverte eccome.

La domanda con cui hai aperto il thread non è una semplice domanda ma conteneva già in partenza un intento polemico neanche molto velato.

Anche se ti piace pensare che i tuoi toni siano garbati, il thread è già partito in maniera polemica (""cambiare le cose qua"").

Nessuno finora ha usato insulti, tranne te (vedi anche ""profondamente infantile"").

Ribadisco che immagino che tu venga downvotato per la polemica insita, mascherata da voglia di dialogo: vale a dire non viene apprezzata la forma, anche perché, quando hai aperto il thread, contenuti non ne hai forniti tanti (tipo cosa ne pensi tu della formazione di governo).

Concludo che il fatto che non si parli di un determinato argomento non vuol dire niente, di per sé. Ti faccio alcuni esempi, pur restando in politica, giusto per dimostrare ciò che intendo. 

Perché non ci sono post su Mussolini? O sul comunismo italiano? O sui Verdi? O sui Radicali? O sulla D.C.? O sul compromesso storico?

All world leaders face this. The US and UK are constantly called imperialists. US presidents are [always compared to Nazis](https://www.google.com/search?q=obama+nazi&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u3wVU5zyPMmgqgG5r4CQBg&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667), this is nothing new. Given their imperial past the Brits or French dont have it much easier (although I will say on reddit they do). In fact, up until the last couple weeks many saw US troops in Europe as imperialist, and still do. Some have oddly changed their opinion as of late. 

People constantly deride the US for intervening in international affairs. Then they deride them for not getting involved when things get ugly. Syria is a perfect example of this. If the US got involved it would be directly guilty of child murder, by abstaining its vicariously guilty of child murder. 

If Germany wants to take a back seat to international affairs, it can forego difficult decisions. But given the turmoil in the EU it seems Germany is getting more and more involved not just in the EU but globally. Either Germany can step up and make tough decisions or back off and let its allies essentially guide its foreign policy (mostly through the EU). But if it gets bent out of shape every time there is a Nazi reference by an obscure group of people, I think the backseat option is already fairly cemented in place.

3. It is more convenient to evoke history's lessons when it means inaction than to evoke them when they will advise you to act.

Right now, the E.E. member states have more friends in Washington than in Brussels or around capital cities in Europe. It is a disgrace, and I am ashamed that it is the way it is.

Everyone should take a good look if the EU can overcome its member states' scyophantic bearings. If not, then I fear the only Union worth a damn isn't the one the Ukrainians hoped for.

I was in China with some of my Eastern European Jewish friends. We met a group of Germans and when they found out my friends were Jewish they said ""sorry about the Holocaust."" Talk about an awkward silence. They all did lose family in the holocaust and were born in Eastern Europe (most came to the US as refugees). I can guarantee none of my friends even considered holding these guys accountable for the Holocaust, knowing full well they were German (we already introduced ourselves). Saying that just made everyone feel weird. Finally one of my friends said ""why the fuck would you be sorry, what are you 22?""

It was fine after that, in fact we've became pretty good friends. One came to the US to study abroad and on a trip and stayed with us. But I have seen the culture of shame you're talking about, and agree, less of that would be preferable. 

All that said, I think the current German leadership would rather just not make difficult decisions unless its truly and directly in Germany's interest. Germany jumped into action during the debt crisis, Nazi comparisons and all (despite how stupid the comparisons were). When its not directly in Germany's interest it seems Germany will not make a move one way or the other or will wait to see what other powerful EU members do, namely the UK and France.

If Russia doesn't face consequences - appropriate ones, not boots on the ground! - it'll go further next time. 

This is the very reasoning behind all kinds of sanctions dealt to other countries in other parts of foreign politics. They don't act like you want them to or do stupid shit, you punish them. Or did you think you weren't allowed to trade with Cuba because their products are low quality?

1. If Putin is really out of touch with reality, only a calm response and talks can get him back on the floor and make him realize that what he's doing will damage Russia in the long term.

2. If Putin is not out of touch with reality, and he is doing this to please militaristic groups in the Russian power cirlce, then a equally militaristic response would only lead to an even larger conflict. Currently, the situation is contained on the Krim, and it should stay that way. 

Once the situation is more calm, diplomacy can take over and negotiate some level of autonomy for the Krim, thus saving Russia's face while maintaining the Ukraine intact.

If all doesn't work, then we still hav time for sanctions.

Not trying to be nitpicky, but most of America's European allies have all but given up on any credible efforts to have their own defense force. Most come [nowhere near meeting the NATO minimum](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zdy2t/in_light_of_what_is_happening_in_ukraine_what_is/cftevwm) targets and have not for some time. 

US allies kind of left it hanging, and with a fairly hefty tab. I disagree with /u/SomewhatAbbreviated's stance, but after a couple decades of the US warning European allies to at least attempt to meet their minimum defense spending targets only to be faced with more cuts I would not be surprised to see a reduction in support in the future.

It the speech where the US Secretary of Defense said the US could leave NATO for the above reasons, he also said he understood meeting the minimums would be politically and financially impossible for many European members. He urged them to at least consolidate resources to avoid redundancy. This has mostly fallen on deaf ears, only to be followed by more cuts. 

If the US should ever decide to pull out of NATO I dont think it could be charged with leaving anyone hanging. Its asked for even a modest effort toward a credible defense force, and most European nations have responded by further slashing their budgets.

true,thatfool,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Ukraine went through a revolution to be with us and we leave it out to hang.

Europe did negotiate an agreement that essentially stripped Yanukovych of some of his powers and set a deadline for a new election. The problem is, after Europe and Ukraine signed that, the Ukrainian parliament decided to impeach Yanukovych anyway and replace the government with a new one, ignoring the procedure for that laid out in the constitution, and without achieving the required majority.

That Europe may not want to support a government that's not legitimate after what was essentially an armed coup isn't the biggest issue here. It's also that they're openly acting against Europe's stated interests in breaking the agreement that Europe negotiated, and then went on to make some of the worst possible decisions they could have made, like trying to repeal the minority language law - something that Europe would never support. Europe is rightfully concerned that there may not be a good side right now they can support.

the likelyhood is that Ukraine military has escalated this from barely any blood shed and loss of crimea, into a possibility of a full eastern europe conflict with a possibility of hundred of thousands of casualties, unless this ends now/soon.

so is Crimea(which is already majority Russian and pro russian) worth the possibility of conflict? Do you really think Russia believes it beneficial to annex a region that is not pro Russian to begin with?

Questo non giustifica nulla. Questo problema lo risolvi con un'adeguata informazione e una sorta di controllo (che io preferisco chiamare sindacalismo). Se uno ti paga i diritti per il muro ma poi lo fa di merda per risparmiare il problema ti rimane.

Le due cose non sono differenti come credi. Un metodo per costruire un muro e un metodo per creare arte sono sempre dei metodi. Il diritto d'autore è sempre sul metodo, che spesso viene confusa con l'opera in sé per sé.

The elected parliament deposed Yanukovich and mandated an ad interim government and announced elections. That's what they should have done, what else?

&gt;And this government acted as if it had the legitimacy to overturn law recognising Russian as a second language, and toughen up dual citizenship laws. 

The elected parliament does have the authority to do so. In any case, the interim president has *vetoed* the abolishment of the law so it's still in force: the democratic checks and balances worked. And to be frank, it was a law to serve Yanukovich' support base and tighten ties with Russia: it ignored all other linguistic minorities.

&gt;Yanukovich on the other hand was voted in. And with the new government no being recognised in Crimea, he is still seen as the nation leader. And he did ask for Russia to intervene.

And the parliament asked Russia to piss off. That's the advantage of a parliament: it's far less likely that the bias of one person leads to extreme decisions.

They are loyal to the Crimean Autonomic ""state"". And that is very wise, because in Kiev there is a very insecure, nervous ""government"" which is easily provoked and perhaps even ready to attack against Russians. Ukraine Army Officials know that they are outnumbered and that Crimea is not worth of fighting. It is mostly rock and dust, not even useful for crops. For the Russia however it is a vital stronghold to control Black Sea and keep NATO (Turkey is south, only 400km away) under control. Remember when during Cuban missile crises USA had deployed missiles in Turkey and the agreement was that Soviets with draw missiles from Cuba and USA from Turkey?

Sure, France, UK and US have nukes too, but that won't help us if Russia shoots theirs first.
Also let's not forget that Merkel allegetly said that Putin is out of touch with reality ... which scare me more than I like to admit.

Germany does have some channels to influence Russia, mainly throu old relations and ""soft"" economic pressure. That is how we got Chodorkowski free. Severing these connections could be really bad for the future.

Das ukrainische Volk will sich offenbar an Europa, nicht an Russland binden. Das wird auch Putin verstanden haben.

For some people (like me) destructive book scanning, where the book is shredded in the process, is preferable over non-destructive scanning for the following reasons. There's less clutter in the house, less objects to dust and your entire library can easily travel with you when you go on vacation or move address. You can also make a backup of your library at a very small cost, protecting it from age, the elements and other hazards, like fire.

I don't advocate that you should be spoon-fed. My miserable example of thinking is an example. I don't understand your fascination with *you are the one responsible for yourself*.

What I am saying is that the media is the public excuse on behalf of governments to conduct themselves the way they do. This is not an explanation for their behavior patterns.

&gt; In my opinion there is no cut-off point, either your media biased or it's not. The biased news can be dealt with rather easily though: using multiple sources, and knowing what to look for.

Yes, there is perhaps no threshold after which media is biased. But I am asking: are we willing to compromise the way we view the world (and in the long run, our ability to survive on this planet, we have no others) to an explanation like: *well, that's how money is made, son -- click-bait*.

Apart from that, what if all media is biased, to begin with. What good are multiple sources then? 

But this is besides the point. We should stop forming opinions on crucial things such as wars and conflict interventions based on media editorials, especially the ones we get shoved down our throats merely on the fact that are being presented by celebrities.

In the interview, the Rabbi [implies](http://www.timesofisrael.com/crimeas-sole-rabbi-advises-jews-not-to-become-targets/) that (pro-)Russian provocateurs are probably to blame:

Ich glaube, dass jemand, der selbst in einer bestimmten Szene gelebt hat, mehr über die Zustände darin aussagen kann als irgendeine objektive, statistische Einschätzung von außen. Da spielt es auch keine Rolle, ob diese Einschätzung vom BKA oder vom Mann im Mond kommt, alslang beide wenig bis gar nicht involviert sind in tatsächliche Zustände.

Viele schaffen das gar nicht und benutzen permanent Alkohol und andere Drogen, um sich zu betäuben. Und das kannst du relativieren und dir selbst schön reden, wie du lustig bist, ändert nichts daran, dass es eine Tatsache ist. Tatsache ist auch - kaum ein Mann, der zu einer Prostituierten geht, würde sich selbst jemals prostituieren wollen und wenn seine eigene Tochter diesen Weg einschlagen würde, wäre er absolut dagegen.

The paperwork you will need is not insignificant but also not the worst.

http://www.australien.diplo.de/Vertretung/australien/en/Visa/Working-Holiday.html

The first is insurance that will cover the entire length you are here.  Travel insurance worked fine for me.  My friend bought a policy and cancelled it within the cooling off period (stupid decision if you ask me) but if you are tight for cash then yeah.

The second is proof of sufficient funds (at least € 250 for each month of your stay = approximately AU$ 400 per month).

Technically because your visa expired you shouldn't be working.  This also goes for your employer employing you as I would imagine it is illegal to continue to employ someone knowing they are not legally allowed to.  Perhaps they can pay you off the books until it is sorted because the German tax system may catch it out.  That is their liability so not your problem.

I would assume now you are visaless you would drop back to Schengen conditions which means no work and you can only stay up to three months.

As for the motel etc.  You can stay wherever.  You can work wherever.  Perhaps because you are still registered there they assume you are still working, which technically you can't until you have a valid visa.  Or you just got someone that is unhappy.

Alternatively, if you have an Early Childhood Education Degree you could ask them to pay you €47,600/year and you could get a blue card (work visa) :p

not even the Ukrainean army wants to do anything about it because they already realise that Ukraine is already split and there is no amount of force Ukraine can bring out that will be able to change it.

it sounds bad but the favorable outcome is to sit down, let russia take Crimea, get best buddies with europe, reinforce nationalism(hah, just look at that) in countries bordering Russia. and then prepare/hope for next time.

&gt; What is childish? The media will always find another war. For the people it is a lose-lose situation

The *ever, ever* part was a bit of a childish pattern of thinking (you know, like children friendships: best friends forever and ever).

Of course, kids soon discover that one thing is for certain: there is no *forever and ever* and maybe these are the first disharmonious steps into adulthood for many children.

Similarly, mutatis mutandis, it is only certain that change will occur within the relationship-space between governments-media (we are discussing them, not that it is special) and citizens. What are the mutable parameters is the whole point of what I am saying: 

*we can change more than what the media seemingly allows for*, namely: 

it is not an explanation for the behavior of governments to use the media as a public excuse for their actions (similarly to what you said, governments and media go hand in hand [paraphrasing]). And this change should start through disregarding the media as a source of realistic public opinion. We should, of course, take media into consideration, but with its deficiencies and thusly: not explaining wars with media coverage (alone) and floated opinions in said media coverages.

[edit] The reason why we should do this to the media is also simple (in my mind): fantasmatic and bombastic media coverages have real and grave consequences in regions, states, nations where wars and conflicts are being waged.

&gt;The EU cannot afford high energy prices and market instability that confrontation with Russia will bring.

It will hurt Russia more than us. We can buy from someone else, we can temporarily suspend goverment taxation to reduce the burden of the individual citizen. In the long- to medium term, we can become energy independent from Russia.

Analogous arguments have been made in the 1970s in regards to OPEC. See how far that got them.

Everybody tells me this, and I'm still trying to find good data on how much a reduction of energy imports would really hurt, if you add countermeasures we could take.

Però ce n'è una che mi interessa in prima persona. Cambierò il nome delle persone per non utilizzare un throwaway.

Stavo assieme a una ragazza da qualche mese, chiamiamola Laura: abitava a 100 km dal mio paese e non c'era nessuno qui che la conosceva. Le cose negli ultimi mesi non andavano per il verso giusto: non per colpa sua, ma perchè ormai non sentivo più quella passione iniziale. Insomma: c'era un'altra ragazza che conoscevo da 3 anni, e con cui c'era sempre stato feeling. Un bel giorno io e questa altra ragazza, chiamiamola Stella, ci baciamo. 
Ovviamente Laura non sapeva nulla di Stella, se non che mesi e mesi prima io e lei eravamo amici.

Il giorno dopo mi telefona la mia ragazza e mi fa subito ""Chi è Silvia???"".
Io casco dalle nuvole e le rispondo che non conosco nessuna Silvia, chiedendole spiegazioni.
Laura mi risponde che da che si è svegliata ha trovato, ovunque posasse gli occhi, la lettera S: un foglietto sul pianerottolo di casa sua, con scritto soltanto ""S"", un cartellone pubblicitario con scritto solo ""S"", una serie di scritte sui muri con soltanto la S, una enorme S disegnata sul suo banco (era ancora alle superiori). E via dicendo.
Aveva collegato quella ""S"" onnipresente a un pericolo e a qualcosa che riguardasse me.

Too bad aveva sbagliato soltanto a interpretare il nome. 

Pochi giorni dopo la lasciai. Pochi mesi dopo mi misi assieme a Stella. Quando Laura lo seppe mi contattò e mi disse solo queste parole: ""Non era Silvia quindi...era la S di Stella...""

La cosa assurda è che questa ragazza, Laura, non era nuova a episodi del genere. Già mesi prima, leggendomi le carte per gioco, mi aveva previsto che io e lei ci saremmo lasciati perchè sarebbe arrivata una persona che avrebbe avuto una importanza spaventosa per la mia vita. E in effetti Stella ha avuto una importanza che non sto qua a spiegarvi.

Se guardi bene, nel tuo stesso grafico (e meglio nel mio che, per tutti i motivi che ho elencato prima, rispecchia molto meglio quello che è successo davvero), puoi notare tre distinte fasi - una che va dagli anni '70 alla fine della prima repubblica, una fase intermedia che di fatto è il risultato dell' autunno nero e dello sgancio dallo SME, e una terza fase in cui il debito riparte senza controllo che comincia dall' entrata nell' euro.

Le considerazioni politiche le lascio a qualcun altro. I dati sono però inequivocabili.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"Let's be honest. The soldiers didn't die to 'free' Poland. They died for British strategic interests in Europe, and even then didn't 'save' Poland. I've seen a number of historians agree that if the British and French moved in from the West as soon as the German army went East, Germany would have lost. But instead we had the phoney war and Poland got pretty much zero military support from French-British governments whilst Polish towns were being burnt in the onslaught. 

Following the war, Polish soldiers weren't even allowed to march in the victory parade for fear that it would anger Stalin. The victory parade that had soldiers from all other allied countries, and Poles weren't allowed. And then 70 years later, you have newspaper articles about the crimewave that's going to sweep the UK as soon as Poland is a full member of Schengen. You see drunk Brits on stag parties in Krakow running around calling Poles inbred (something I've personally witnessed) and making a mess. Most of all, you see Brits talk about how they 'fought to save Poland'... as if it was that one single pure cause cause for declaring war on Germany, and as if Poland didn't experience some half a century under the Soviet boot once the Allies had said 'enough'.

And now the Poles are seeing the same kind of 'holier-than-thou' attitude from the Brits here, where the Poles are firebrands agitating for supporting Ukraine, on the misguided notions of honour (after all, *Why Die for Danzig?*) whilst the calm, cool-headed Brits talk down to them about how there should be no intervention, how it would be silly to halt the economic recovery through sanctions, and inaction over the matter full stop. 

You see how they might be a bit pissed off at the Brits?

today or tomorrow we have elections for the new football federation chief position and Popescu was the candidate with highest chance to win. He was going in the elections while having a suspended sentence from another case btw. The elections might be cancelled.

they are all going to prison today and it seems that our football world is.. cleaning up :D

the Becali's will meet their cousin, the owner of Steaua, in jail.

part of what they basically did was that they sold x player for say  300k but on papers the clubs received 150k. Things like this got clubs like Dinamo and Rapid in the difficult financial positions they are in today.

Premièrement, ce qui s'est passé en Ukraine est un beau jeu UE/US, comme ils l'ont fait avec la plupart des pays de l'ancien bloc sovietique. Manipulation, financement d'une révolution,...Etc comme en Géorgie par exemple ( et il se passe la même chose en Amérique du Sud avec le Vénézuela ). 

L'Ukraine est déjà un pays mal formé, il y a deux types de population, culturellement différent qui n'arrive pas à vivre ensemble. On voit qu'une partie de la population est pro-Russe et qui ne veut pas de cette nouvelle Ukraine ( je propose au passage de regarder les tendances politiques du gouvernement ukrainien ). 

L'UE et les US font ouvertement tombé un régime ( okay, pas le meilleur régime, bien corrompu et tout ça, enfin rien de différents des autres Républiques en général ) afin d'en placer un autre ( qui a fait moins de 5% de vote aux dernières elections ) et ils espèraient que la Russie ne dise rien ... 

Désolé, je ne vois pas ce que la Russie fait en ce moment que la plupart des pays Européens et les US ne font. La France est un bel exemple, l'intervention armée au Mali ou en Centre Afrique, sous couvert d'aider la démocratie, ne fait que servir les interets de quelques uns ( parce que je ne vois guère les interets des Français dans ces interventions ). La seul différence en ce que la France et la Russie font en ce moment, ce que pour la Russie, ses frontières sont concernées et menacées. 

Le jeu des médias occidentaux en ce moment est ridicule. Ces 20 dernières années, les interventions militaires russes sont à compter sur les doigts, contrairement aux notre, à celles de l'UE et des US. La Russie est plutôt sage depuis la fin du bloc. 

Bref, l'Ukraine est encore une fois une belle manipulation formentée par les US et l'UE en Europe. Comme la Yougoslavie, la Géorgie,...Etc  Tout ça pour casser l'influence russe et le meilleur moyen de casser l'influence russe est de financer et faire monter en puissance des groupes d'extrême droite se revendiquent du national socialisme. 

Alors qu'on arrête de nous dire que l'Ukraine est le fait d'une révolution populaire, sans implication de pouvoirs etrangers ( un géant de l'industrie américaine est déjà près à s'installer en Ukraine pour du gaz, ça me rappel presque certaines interventions au Moyen-Orient ).

Sul momento non ho assolutamente capito che cazzo stesse succedendo, c'erano due lune identiche in cielo, una da un lato e una dall'altro, una coperta dalle nuvole e l'altra no. 
Tutti in macchina hanno visto quello che ho visto io meno che l'amico che guidava (che non so perché si è rifiutato di fermarsi perché non ci credeva a priori), abbiamo visto quest'oggetto sino quasi arrivati a casa quando le nuvole l'hanno coperto completamente. La cosa più allucinante è quando si sono spostate le nuvole, al centro di questa ""luna"" c'era una specie di fila di luci fisse arancioni e gialle, e a guardarlo bene la forma non era proprio precisamente quella della luna, era leggermente più ovoidale.

Probabilmente si, se l'intero attacco è mirato ad annullare una transazione effettuata sulla blockchain regolare. Il punto è che con ogni probabilità il costo di condurre un simile attacco sarebbe molto maggiore dei bitcoin guadagnabili.

&gt; Puoi dimostrare ciò matematicamente? Se prendo controllo di parte del network non posso avvelenare la blockchain o riscriverla in mio favore? Dimostrazione matematica con pseudocodice e/o rappresentazione degli stati possibili pls.

Mi spiace, non ne ho voglia ne tempo. Se non ti è chiaro come mai il solo controllo della rete non consenta a terzi di riscrivere o alterare la blockchain, evidentemente ti mancano delle [basi sul funzionamento del bitcoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty) e dovresti approfondire l'argomento prima di affermare che il sistema sia fallato.

&gt; ok, ora spiegami cosa succede in caso di chain fork. Chi ha assunto la posizione di rete privilegiata può doppiospendere quello che gli pare? 

se la rete viene forkata in modo estremamente asimmetrico, ovvero in qualunque scenario che non consideri una guerra mondiale, no: solo il fork principale continuerebbe a funzionare. L'altro fork sarebbe essenzialmente bloccato o comunque estremamente rallentato per settimane, mesi o più ancora per effetto della difficoltà.

true,Kit_Emmuorto,vaticano,,"Anni fa, mi trovai a dovermi trasferire lontano da casa. Avendo bisogno di un tetto e non avendo abbastanza soldi per affittare un appartamento vero e proprio, mi risolsi a cercare una stanza. Fui fortunato: trovai quasi subito questa signora che, rimasta vedova in una casa diventata troppo grande, aveva tirato su un muro e ricavato uno stanzone con cucinino e bagnetto e lo affittava in nero. La porta d'ingresso era comune, poi c'era un piccolo corridoio con due porte. A sinistra la mia, a destra la sua.

Mi trovavo bene. La signora era un po' stramba (ma chi non lo diventa con l'età?), ma non dava alcun problema. Né io ne davo a lei: alle volte passavano settimane senza che ci incrociassimo nemmeno. D'altronde in casa stavo poco, spesso tornando a notte fonda per riuscire poche ore dopo. Per quel poco che ci stavo, la casa funzionava bene: mai un guasto, mai un inconveniente.

L'unico problema era il rumore. Le finestre erano vecchie di decenni, e che fossero aperte o chiuse per le orecchie cambiava poco. La piazza sottostante essendo un importante snodo del traffico cittadino, specie nei mesi caldi dormire diventava difficile. Certe notti perdevo il conto di quante volte mi svegliava lo sferragliare di un tram o la sgommata di un'auto.

Forse il motivo per cui ci misi così tanto ad accorgermi dell'altro rumore fu proprio questo. Le prime volte lo scambiai per un suono da fuori, o per l'eco di una tubatura da qualche parte nella pancia del palazzo, o per chissà che altro. E invece era diverso. Era come un ansimare, un respirare rabbiosamente, quasi a volere inghiottire l'aria. Sembrava venire da qualche parte sotto il pavimento, ma allo stesso tempo non era nella stanza.

Da sveglio non l'ho mai sentito. Arrivava solo quando dormivo. Non so come facesse, né di come facessi ad averne coscienza durante il sonno. So solo che arrivava: un momento prima non c'era e quello dopo era lì: un soffio affannoso, che ad ogni respiro diventava più veloce, più ansioso, più disperato. Non gli avrò mai sentito fare più di quattro, cinque respiri: mi sono sempre svegliato prima. E nel momento stesso in cui aprivo gli occhi, lui cessava di colpo per non tornare più. Non quella notte, almeno.

Nonostante il disagio, non gli detti mai troppo peso. Faccio sonni agitati fin da piccolo, e non sono nuovo agli incubi ricorrenti. Mi convinsi che il respiro notturno rientrava tra quelli e trascorsi in quella casa parecchi mesi senza grandi turbamenti. Due o tre volte al mese venivo svegliato dal soffio (qualunque cosa le mie orecchie sentissero davvero), ma più di quello nulla.

Qualche tempo dopo, grazie ad un colpo di fortuna, mi ritrovai con abbastanza soldi in tasca per traslocare in una casa vera. Feci su i miei scatoloni, salutai la signora e presi l'ascensore. Incrociai la portinaia nell'atrio. ""Finalmente riesci ad andartene"", mi fece. Tra lei e la mia fresca ex padrona di casa non correva buon sangue. ""Davvero non so come hai fatto"", riprese, ""a stare sotto lo stesso tetto con quella pazza"". Risposi non so che di circostanza e feci per tirare su un cartone. ""Se solo penso a dove ti ha fatto dormire tutto questo tempo..."".

Mi voltai di scatto. ""Perché?"". ""Strano, pensavo te l'avesse detto"", fece lei senza nemmeno provare a nascondere la soddisfazione. ""Che cosa?"", chiesi. ""Hai presente dove ha messo il letto, no? Lungo il muro davanti alla finestra. Ecco, lì è dove vent'anni fa hanno trovato il marito. Si era ucciso con un sacchetto in testa. Bravissima persona, per carità...""",0,1393939900,null,0,false,0,cfu2172,t3_1zioyd,t1_cfu2172,t3_1zioyd,null,1432652214,26,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,26

L'ipotesi di segolas introduce un numero di elementi ipotetici non indifferente:

1. deve esistere una foto del defunto

2. la foto dev'essere recente (e non di quando il soggetto era ragazzino)

3. chi ha visto il ""fantasma"" deve averla vista

4. chi ha visto il presunto fantasma deve aver dimenticato di aver visto la foto

5. chi ha visto il presunto fantasma deve aver avuto un'allucinazione

6. l'allucinazione ha fatto affiorare un ricordo inconscio della foto

7. esistono tipi di allucinazione che ti fanno immaginare in movimento un soggetto visto in una foto

E sottolineo ""elementi ipotetici"", perché nessuno di questi è dimostrato e neanche dimostrabile.

Inoltre, l'affermazione implicita ""non esiste niente al di là della materia"" andrebbe dimostrata.

Un conto è sospendere il giudizio, che sarebbe la posizione più razionale. Da lì ad ammettere che era un riaffiorare di un ricordo inconscio, bisogna fare un passo in più, che va dimostrato.

Facendo un discorso più ampio: un conto è sospendere il giudizio sull'esistenza della coscienza dopo la morte, un altro è l'affermazione ""ovviamente non esiste niente dopo la morte"", che richiede l'onere della prova, perché è un'affermazione e non la posizione di default.",0,1393939908,null,0,false,0,cfu219i,t3_1zioyd,t1_cfu219i,t1_cfu1ut6,null,1432652215,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

I mean, look at the parent thread of this topic; a Polish person criticising the UK both for WW2 and inaction during the current Ukraine crisis as though the UK has some duty to fuck over its own economy over Ukraine when the UK approach isn't too different from that of most of Western Europe.

Piazza la trappola e aspetta. Passano le notti e invece di essere svegliato dallo scatto della trappola continua a sentire sto strisciare...

Fratelli di x scambiano il letto, dormono assieme su brande. Al gatto viene concesso di dormire in camera ma nulla. Sto grattare lo sentono tutti ma il gatto manco s'alza.

Lentamente x individua una sorgente del rumore: il suo stesso letto. NOPE! Pensa e sveglia tutti.

Smontano il letto e dietro-sotto trovano un buco... Era un tarlo! Che scavando il tunnel lo svegliava. Di giorno era coperto dal rumore generale e la notte si fermava appena x si agitava nel sonno.


(ci potrebbero essere incongruezine varie che ho riempito io perché x me lo raccontò parecchio tempo fa ma di sicuro pensava ad un raschiare/grattare ma era un tarlo)

Czech Republic found how to do it right. In the distant past secondary education (*the maturity*) actually meant something valuable, someting you can rely on. It was enough to become an official, teacher or a manager.

Only the smartest were able to attend universities. Those who passed through technical university, for example, were automatically expected to fill up R&amp;D positions.


These olden times are over. The maturity is now granted to 75%  of the young people. About 67% of the young population now goes through tertiary education (60% to universities, ~7% to a hybrid between secondary and tertiary schools). This is three times more than in the past.

Is this true for Ukraine as well? Because I believe that's not true for Serbia, for example.

&gt; Even if he was still somehow technically president, asking a foreign country to invade your own, against the wishes of its people (x% of Crimeans might like the Russians invading, but I doubt it's &gt;50% in Crimea, let alone &gt;50% of Ukrainians) and against the wishes of its parliament, and without a good cause (the ""protection"" they supposedly needed is clearly nonsense)—should still get him trialled for treason.

See, this is where it gets interesting. He's not asking a ""foreign country to invade his own"", he is asking for help to protect his democracy from extremists. Same like Central-African Republic recently asking France for help with a similar issue, and Mali also asking for French help.

Also, as someone who is a bit more familiar with the situation, if there were a vote in Crimea with a question ""Do you want to be part of Russia or ""new"" Ukraine"", I can tell you that easily at least 80% of people would vote for Russia. If the vote was for the entirety of Ukraine... well, then it'd be interesting.

Let me remind you that despite everything that has happened, he still IS their democratically elected president. The people elected him, so he is representing their interests. I do not agree with pretty much anything *my* president does, but my nation elected him - what can I do? The current president of Ukraine came in by force. 

But you know what? If a part of my country decided they won't follow the way currently set by the government, I would not object to my government calling for foreign help either. 

&gt; All of this is assuming that he came up with the idea and genuinely asked Putin. It's completely feasible that Russia either forged that document or (more likely) put pressure on Yanukovich: you sign this document we wrote, and we'll be more likely to help you out here in Russia, maybe get you a nice post in a oligarch company, or make you governor of Crimea or something.

Tutti gli elementi sono perfettamente funzionali al racconto (chehkov's gun tipo?), combinazioni di eventi ""fortunate"", un dialogo che suona strano succedesse solo allora mentre te ne andavi, la mancanza di un commento finale proprio a voler quasi finire la storia.

Tutto troppo perfetto. Non è educato dire che te la sei inventata, ma non è che per caso hai romanzato un pelino? :D

Perhaps secretly theyve been replaced by a shadowy right wing cabal, but theyre doing a pretty crappy job of turning Ukraine into a fascist country about to ethnically cleanse people who speak russian so far, or even announcing an intention to, or even having ever said it as part of their motivations...

Is there a large number of Russian troops in the country? Yes we can see them on television cameras...could be an elaborate faking, but seeing as it fits with facts we know about Russian presence in the region and its motivations, lets assume thats the better explanation for the moment.

Das Problem an Demokratie ist exakt das selbe wie bei jeder anderen Form der Hierarchie: Komplette und willentliche Ignoranz der menschlichen Psyche und Sozialdynamik:

**Menschen die anführen wollen, wollen das Volk nicht *vertreten*. Und Menschen die gerne passiv anderen vertreten, *wollen nicht* anführen.** Das ist schon alleine hormonell ein Riesenunterschied!  

Deswegen interessieren sich Anführer nicht für die Interessen ihres Volkes, und werden das auch niemals tun. Per Definition nicht! (Aber sie werden weiter Tod und Teufel in Bewegung versetzen damit das Volk das weiter glaubt!)

La notte stessa però la madre si sveglia e vede, o crede di vedere, sua figlia davanti al letto, con addosso il vestitino della foto, che se lo tira con le manine. 

La scena si ripete altre 2-3 notte, fino a che la madre decide, tra mille remore per evitare di essere presa per pazza, di recarsi dalla vicina per chiederle di farsi restituire il vestitino.

Decide così, esce di casa, e per strada le viene incontro proprio la vicina, con un pacchettino in mano. Glielo porge e le dice:
""E' meglio che questo vestitino lo tenga tu, perchè tua figlia sono tre notti che mi sveglia...""

Brividi. 

La seconda storiella invece è di ""seconda mano"", nel senso che mi è stata raccontata non dal diretto interessato, ma da un mio amico (che conosco da anni e che non è solito raccontare balle) che lo ha conosciuto personalmente.

Questo ragazzo era in seminario, e prometteva abbastanza bene, tanto che spesso seguiva un sacerdote che somministrava la Comunione negli ospedali. 
Ovviamente, ogni ospedali ha vari reparti, e in quello che visitavano c'era un'ala che ospitava i pazienti con problemi neurologici.

Insomma. Una mattina il ragazzo si sveglia con la schiena che gli brucia: si guarda allo specchio e la scopre completamente piena di graffi.
Turbato dalla cosa, ma senza dargli troppo peso, comincia la sua giornata.

Nel pomeriggio accompagna il suo sacerdote nel solito giro dell'ospedale, e passano dal reparto neurologia.

Lì c'è una anziana signora, sempre silente, sempre con lo sguardo perso nel vuoto. 

Appena entrato il ragazzo, la signora si gira, lo guarda, comincia a ridere e con sguardo sarcastico gli fa:

That's the problem with the cultural argument -- it's elusive. Is the East _way_ more prone to corruption than the West? Yes. The South more than the North? Yes. But then again it's been decades if not centuries since this area has been significantly poorer than others in Europe. 

If you take a Romanian/Serb/Ukrainian and move them to the West, they'll be able to cope perfectly with the lack of corruption there, but less able to cope with things that are truly cultural marks of their land: the small do's and don't's in conversations (cf the answer to the ""how's it going?"" question), the local cuisine, the idea of what makes a party, and so on. That's why I contend to say it's hardly the cultural bias that makes the east less innovative rather than the economical factors. It's not a scientific argument by any means, but that's the thing -- ""culture"" is defined in such a way that one can never gauge properly it's effect on a society's economy.

It seems clear that Russia will not back down (at least for now).  Germany's folding in the face of Russia, unwilling to impose the sanctions that the U.S. suggested.  Even the U.K. isn't back up the U.S. on that.  And that's because Europe gets so much energy and does so much business with Russia.

And so the question returns: who's causing the thought of armed conflict?  If you said the West, then you picked the wrong door.  Russia has invaded another country.  Let me repeat that: Russia has invaded another country.  Russia has invaded.  

There seems to be no indication whatsoever that Putin will stop with the Crimea or even with all of Ukraine.  The only question is: will we show that we will fight him now (we all hope that we don't have to fight them at all) or will we wait until he's incorporated Ukraine into Russian territory?  Or will we wait until they pressure Belarus into their dominion?  Or maybe we'll wait another whole decade and finally react only after he's invaded Poland.

J'aimerais des sources un peu soldies là dessus parce que là tu donnes l'impression de spéculer à bloc. 

&gt;La France est un bel exemple, l'intervention armée au Mali ou en Centre Afrique, sous couvert d'aider la démocratie, ne fait que servir les interets de quelques uns ( parce que je ne vois guère les interets des Français dans ces interventions ). 

Mali : la France a été appellée à l'aide par le gouvernement Malien pour mettre un terme à une attaque islamiste venue de l'étranger alliée à des mouvements séparatistes touaregs, il lui était difficile de refuser sincèrement. Elle agissait sous couvert de l'ONU pour repousser des envahisseurs qui souhaitaient mettre en place une théocratie musulmane dans un pays qui fonctionnait jusque là à peu près bien malgré la cohabitation de différentes religions. 

Centrafrique : Là encore il s'agissait de mettre fin aux massacres religieux inter-ethniques. Encore une fois avec l'accord de l'ONU (la France n'intervient jamais sans).

Ce qui est drôle c'est qu'on a craché sur la France pendant des années parce qu'elle est intervenue trop tard au Rwanda et aujourd'hui on intervient pour mettre fin à des massacres et c'est pas bien non plus. Il faudra m'expliquer ce qu'on est censés faire.

Je rappelle également à tout hasard que la Russie est un membre permanent du conseil de sécurité de l'ONU et qu'elle a donc le pouvoir de mettre son véto sur toute résolution. Ce qui signifie qu'elle aurait tout à fait pu sans souci bloquer toute intervention sous couvert de l'ONU à tout moment si elle en avait eu envie. 

Si tu cherches des justifications plus prosaïques, le Niger fait partie des principaux fournisseurs d'Uranium de la France et il est donc primordial que la zone reste stable. 

&gt;Bref, l'Ukraine est encore une fois une belle manipulation formentée par les US et l'UE en Europe. Comme la Yougoslavie, la Géorgie,...Etc Tout ça pour casser l'influence russe et le meilleur moyen de casser l'influence russe est de financer et faire monter en puissance des groupes d'extrême droite se revendiquent du national socialisme.

Making changes to the territory of Ukraine legally is very difficult as per the constitution. Besides, there already has been a refenrendum on the issue: when Ukraine became independend Crimea had a referendum about its status and people voted for autonomy within Ukraine.

That may or may not be true, but it is somewhat irrelevant to the comment from which this discussion stemmed in which /u/skyPL is drawing a parallel between the policy of the UK government in 1939 in relation to Poland and the current policy of the UK government in relation to Ukraine and criticising them both. 

I'm sure you will understand why British people find this extremely cheap and offensive? 

The UK government's position at the moment is slap-bang in the middle of the mainstream of EU positions, and while we haven't put in place sanctions, it is odd for a Pole to choose to criticise the UK government but somehow to forget to criticise the Polish government also for not implementing sanctions.

In relation to what Britain did in WW2, of course, we might have wished that history had played out differently, but it is easy to say that with hindsight.

I think the difference is that Poland has been at the forefront of calling for sanctions and actions throughout the entire crisis, whereas Britain, France, Germany, have all been specifically drawing red lines about sterner measures. Poland is (comparatively) a small economy that has little two way trade with Russia aside from energy and Russian isolation of Poland is an easy accomplishment. The other countries are considerably less threatened and vulnerable to Russia (both economically and physically), yet they refuse to consider the possibility on the basis that it would harm their economic interests - Frances contracts for battleships, for the UK it's protecting the City, and for Germany it's Merkel's staunch refusal to change the relationship she established with Moscow almost a decade ago. Yet Poland is calling for sanctions, Lithuania and Latvia are invoking NATO dialogues through Art. 4, and tiny Czechia is saying there's a good chance they'll cancel the deal with Russian firms over building nuclear reactors.

Reserve currency status isn't something awarded by council of technocrats, or even something that's agreed on by a group of countries. Markets made the dollar the reserve currency because of the strength and dynamism of the US economy, institutional stability, and a large population that demanded a currency base that's able to absorb mass global investment (otherwise a country like Switzerland might have a reserve currency). It looked like the Euro may have threatened dollar primacy in the middle of the last decade- and it may yet do that in the future- but the Euro crisis, understandably, undermined confidence in its stability. 

Russia could decide to sell all its dollars, but they don't own enough of them to trigger any sort of panic in currency or markets, and it wouldn't change the underlying reasons why governments and financial institutions own dollars in the first place.

Interesting thing is that Crimea has already had a refendum on the issue. When Ukraine became independent they voted for autonomy in Ukraine.

Now with the new referendum the original idea was to have it May 25th when the new election is scheduled to happen.

But Russian troops seized the Crimean parliament and istalled a new Russian PM there (who BTW has not been appointed by the president as should be by the constitution, and therefore is not legit). One of the first things he did was to declare the referendum to happen already this month, which raises the question why the hurry? Is it because Russian occupation can only last so long?

And then there's the actual public opinion: the polls in Crimea have not showed majority support for independency nor for annexation to Russia, and the Russian nationalistic partis have not polled big in elections with their low percentages.

But of course with Russian military occupation the referendum result is easy to manipulate or forge.

true,Paludosa2,null,null,"&gt;*""Britain, by contrast, entered the club in 1973 hesitantly, without enthusiasm and in a moment of transient economic anxiety.""*

The mistake was looking at the growth in Europe at the time and the debt-saddled UK chose the wrong option for growth.

&gt;*""This underlies the Euroscepticism that pervades the Conservative Party and a majority of Britons""*

Labour were initially opposed to the EEC/EC. The post-legislative referendum in 1975 via the Heath government again was split-personality disorder. I somewhat suspect the Cold War was as much a reason the British public were sold the question post-haste:

&gt;*Do you think the UK should* **stay** *in the European Community* (**Common Market**)?

Notice ""stay"" as if something is being taken away and ""common market"" ie economic trade.

&gt;*""The steady creep of EU powers and regulations, into the justice system, the workplace and beyond, have caused much greater resentment""*

HUGE TRANSFER OF POWERS and sovereignty via Treaties (Maastrich, Amsterdam, Nice, Lisbon etc etc) signed away without public participation.

&gt;*""which the ongoing troubles in the euro zone have exacerbated.""*

Liable for bail-outs, and paying 55m per day for the above. And the damage the EU has done the economic prosperity of Europe which adversely affects the UK's economy particularly due to lacking Trade policy via being in the EU.

&gt;*""Many Britons feel they have ended up in a power hungry, supra-governmental and economically moribund arrangement, which they never voted to join, and would not have done. Clearly, they have a point.""*

&gt;*""All the same, why are they so bothered?""*

Normally people only realize major issues: Jobs, Prices, Schools, Education, Hospitals, Taxes.

But it's slowly dawned on people everyday interference of the EU with random high-paid MEP's poking their oar in and telling the country they can't do x y z eg prostitution criminalization laws being drafted by the EU then announced via Labour for the most recent eg. It's dawning that there's no border control, there's huge costs being wasted and politicians lying and lining their pockets in a time of austerity. It's taken 40 years for people to really start noticing what a dead-end the EU is. 

&gt;*""Memories of empire also play a part in this deceit: some Tory Eurosceptics even dream of reconstituting it as an alternative to the EU""*

This is just a pack of pure lies:

1. The Tories by voting on EU issues are the most europhile party in the UK Parliament: You can check their voting records. They have a minor 10% element of eurosceptics however.
2. The UK has a new multicultural identity: Long gone are the Empire dreams: This means the UK is GLOBAL LOOKING not just EU-INSULAR looking. Growth and trade have historically been of interest to the UK and they will be again in the future free from the EU.
3. UKIP have actually heeded the public will on the EU issue and this has driven political agenda in the UK now.

&gt;*""It was primarily to appease this lobby that the Tory prime minister, David Cameron, promised the 2017 referendum in the event that the Tories win a general election next year.""*

To use the writer's own description: This is deluded. Cameron is pro-EU, Merkel's young nephew who has lied about referendums before and will lead a IN vote in the event (unlikely) of staying Tory leader and winning the next General Election (due to come 3rd in May).

Again, depends -- I would say that corruption and poverty are inextricably linked, by which I mean poverty will almost always produce a corrupt ruling class within a few years, and that ruling class will cling on to power even in times of economic boom. Of course, there are other factors, such as the corporate culture of your neighbours (which is always highly professional in countries that have been rich for decades), which can accelerate the progress of your country (I'll make a risky bet and say this has been a decisive factor in the Baltic states getting an economical edge on central-eastern Europe).

As for the bureaucracy -- France has loads of it, and somehow still makes do. I'm not saying it's not an obvious drawback (even for a developed country like France), and for certain it is something that should be made obsolete ASAP. But I doubt it that if tomorrow bureaucracy would disappear overnight you'd have mass protests complaining about the loss of a crucial element of cultural identity in the Balkans. What you would have would be mass protests from all those people who lost their sweet but completely useless jobs in an oversized public sector. Which is a legacy of communism. So you could tie it to our culture somehow, but also remove it in 20 years without hurting the cultural id. Provided you find enough bravery in politicians to fire a few hundred thousand people, of course.

&gt; There is no economic reasons for Japan to be less innovative, or South Korea.

There are a few good decades of political stability and economic well being that results directly into loads of money poured into R&amp;D. And if Japan lost it's innovative edge it's only because of it's rapidly ageing population.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; I think the difference is that Poland has been at the forefront of calling for sanctions and actions throughout the entire crisis, whereas Britain, France, Germany, have all been specifically drawing red lines about sterner measures. Poland is (comparatively) a small economy that has little two way trade with Russia aside from energy and Russian isolation of Poland is an easy accomplishment. The other countries are considerably less threatened and vulnerable to Russia (both economically and physically), yet they refuse to consider the possibility on the basis that it would harm their economic interests - Frances contracts for battleships, for the UK it's protecting the City, and for Germany it's Merkel's staunch refusal to change the relationship she established with Moscow almost a decade ago. Yet Poland is calling for sanctions, Lithuania and Latvia are invoking NATO dialogues through Art. 4, and tiny Czechia is saying there's a good chance they'll cancel the deal with Russian firms over building nuclear reactors. It's a shitty situation, and frankly, quite embarrassing for the West.

And none of this I really disagree with and it is a serious point and one worth making about the West generally. 

But if we're trying to make a serious point about the West generally, it shouldn't be made by just mentioning the UK and then talking about the UK in WW2. This just makes the what could have been a serious point seem ridiculous.

- Adesso come adesso la legge ha dei vizi di forma per cui si rischierebbe di avere due maggioranze diverse alla camera e al senato (a causa del ballottaggio)

- L'ipotesi che circola è quella dell'Italicum in approvazione alla Camera, mentre si discuterà si eventuali modifiche al Senato.

Quindi si andrebbe a finire con una maggioranza assoluta alla Camera grazie alla nuova legge ed un Senato probabilmente spaccato in tre per via del porcellum rivisitato (quindi in pratica la stessa situazione di adesso).

Alfano e gli altri piccoli gruppi che fanno parte della maggioranza vorrebbero rimandare il più possibile l'approvazione della legge elettorale che li colpirebbe in negativo (per via delle soglie di sbarramento). In più Alfano non ha interesse ad andare alle elezioni, in quanto fa parte del governo e perché il suo è comunque un partito nuovo (quindi più in là si fanno elezioni, più il partito ha opportunità di crescere).

Berlusconi è all'opposto, vorrebbe le elezioni il prima possibile e sa che una delle cose che potrebbero facilitare le elezioni anticipate sarebbe proprio la nuova legge elettorale.

Il PD da un lato non ha tutta questa fretta (almeno a parole hanno intenzione di arrivare al 2018), però hanno anche tutta l'intenzione di approvarla questa legge elettorale, che è uno dei cavalli di battaglia di Renzi negli ultimi mesi. Ovviamente cercano di fare il proprio gioco e di accontentare gli altri, e quindi le varie pensate (riforma elettorale solo per la Camera o entrata in vigore della nuova legge legata alla riforma costituzionale del Senato) sono fatte per accontentare tutti (accontenti Alfano perché la legge non entra in vigore subito e anche se lo fa per la Camera non cambia nulla, e accontenti Berlusconi perché approvi la legge che lui stesso ha voluto). Peccato però che quelli di FI non saranno dei geni, ma non sono nemmeno così scemi da rendersi conto che approvarla così non serve a nulla, e quindi tanto tanto contenti non sono.

That isn't really true. Britain wanted to be part of the union for a long time. Charles de Gaulle died in 1970. Britain joined the union in 1973. By the time it finally happened the British public had lost some enthusiasm because of the petty politics of de Gaulle but to say we never wanted in is fundamentally incorrect.

The 'skip the lines' tours are indeed legitimate. The lines outside the Vatican can be horrendous - more than an hour long during popular months - but guided tour companies buy tickets in bulk in advance, so you will be able to walk straight past the lines with your guide. 

You can also skip the lines yourself by buying Vatican tickets online, though - but make sure to print your ticket out and bring it with you as they need the bar-code: http://biglietteriamusei.vatican.va/musei/tickets/do (Note that when you go in, you will need to go to one of the counters on the left just past the security scanners in order to get your online voucher validated and turned into a ticket, which you then use at the turnstile at the top of the first set of escalators.)

Having said that, there is a lot to be said for having a guide. Though relatively expensive, they add a significant and important layer of comprehension and interpretation to your trip, and also can direct you to the key pieces in the museum. The museum has 8 miles of corridors and it's easy to wander for hours without finding what you want!

My tip is to book in advance online with a reputable guide company such as Walks of Italy or Dark Rome (though Dark Rome tends to have huge groups, which can feel very impersonal). They tend to have high standards and to vet their guides' standard of English. Tripadvisor can give you a rough idea of the quality of different companies. 

What I wouldn't recommend doing is waiting until the last minute and buying a place on a tour from the many hustlers in the streets surrounding the Vatican, as you really can't tell what kind of tour guide you might be getting - could be good, could be terrible.

Hi there!
The 'skip the lines' tours are indeed legitimate. The lines outside the Vatican can be horrendous - more than an hour long during popular months - but guided tour companies buy tickets in bulk in advance, so you will be able to walk straight past the lines with your guide.
You can also skip the lines yourself by buying Vatican tickets online, though - but make sure to print your online voucher out and bring it with you as they need the bar-code (note - contrary to another post you do not have to line up to get in once you have an online voucher - for the Colosseum and Forum you do have to line up for a while, but that's a different matter!): http://biglietteriamusei.vatican.va/musei/tickets/do[1] (Note that when you go in, you will need to go to one of the counters on the left just past the security scanners in order to get your online voucher validated and turned into a ticket, which you then use at the turnstile at the top of the first set of escalators.)
Having said that, there is a lot to be said for having a guide. Though relatively expensive, they add a significant and important layer of comprehension and interpretation to your trip, and also can direct you to the key pieces in the museum. The museum has 8 miles of corridors and it's easy to wander for hours without finding what you want!
My tip is to book in advance online with a reputable guide company such as Walks of Italy or Dark Rome (though Dark Rome tends to have huge groups, which can feel very impersonal). They tend to have high standards and to vet their guides' standard of English. Tripadvisor can give you a rough idea of the quality of different companies.
What I wouldn't recommend doing is waiting until the last minute and buying a place on a tour from the many hustlers in the streets surrounding the Vatican, as you really can't tell what kind of tour guide you might be getting - could be good, could be terrible.
Full disclosure: I just this week launched a site which answers questions like yours about Rome. I'll be paraphrasing your question and putting it (anonymously) on the site in a 'Q&amp;A' section.

You're also confusing two different issues: the EU's rules on fruit shape don't have anything to do with the AOC system.

(ii) I'm not sure where the Guardian article you linked to says that more transactions are conducted in yuan than in dollar. It simply said that China became the largest trading nation in the world, which is not the same thing.* 

(iii) It takes two to tango. Maybe it'd make more sense for China to pay with yuan, but I don't think that, say, Brazil, Germany, India and whoever else they are trading with would agree, so I don't see it happening anytime soon. I'm not saying that dollar will keep its status forever, but I also don't see why many developed nations would risk switching from dollar to yuan at this point.

Now that's an euphemism. Crimeans in Russia never had as many privileges as they do in independent Ukraine.

&gt; Crimea wants to become its own independent country there is nothing the rest of Ukraine can do

First of all: We don't know if they do, and won't know as long as Russia holds gun up to their heads like they do now. And secondly - Ukrainian government is the only one that can agree on secession of Crimea if it'd declare such will. Crimea cannot do it on it's own just like for years Scotland couldn't do it on it's own. Agreement needs to be achieved on both sides. Only here situation is by far more difficult because Russians on Crimea already have their own country - just right across the straight. And for political reasons Crimea needs to be kept as a part of Ukraine (these reasons are - paradoxically - created by Russia itself). UN charter does not give a green light for separatism. No country in the world would sign it if it would. Certainly not Russia, Ukraine, or UK for that matter.

&gt; the language in the charter is pretty clear.

It is clear, only you skew it to your own point of view. Confirmation bias is blinding you while reading it.

If Ukraine would break even a slightest bit of it - Russians would do everything they can to exploit it to it's full extend for their own advantage. Yet they didn't. Why? Because **no UN law was broken** and **no right was abused**.

The ""reasons"" for the EC (wasn't EU back then) were plain and simple the unified market. They wanted to create a minimum standard to ease transport and trade of imported bananas inside the EC, because there weren't any, which basically is one of the ""other"" trade obstacles (not being a tariff or customs) to a single market. There might have been better ways to achieve this, but you cannot say they did it because of ""reasons"". This one is one of the urban myths about the EU.

If you want a case where someone did something because of ""reasons"", look at the [""Cassis de Dijon"" case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewe-Zentral_AG_v_Bundesmonopolverwaltung_für_Branntwein).

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"Unfortunately I hear the collective sound of the broader point wooshing straight over this thread, and I take some issue with NPR making this out to be an argument solely about the free trade agreement between the US and EU, because this is actually a part of a much broader issue that pits the US against most other countries.

Two years ago, Forbes Magazine [ran a fantastic article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/larryolmsted/2012/04/12/foods-biggest-scam-the-great-kobe-beef-lie/) on the issue of the US not honouring international agreements on the naming rights of special national and regional food. To lift a few key lines from part 3 of that article:

&gt; After this examination, my conclusion is that these products are collectively an attempt to fool the American consumer into thinking they are buying something they are not, at very high prices, by trading on the longstanding reputation of excellence belonging to the cattle producers around Kobe, Japan, whose meat is never, ever sold on our shores.

&gt; But Kobe is just the tip of the labeling iceberg – there are literally hundreds of other food items, from the extravagant, such as Champagne and Cognac, to the more common, like Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, whose production and sale in this country would violate many very old and well-known foreign trademarks – **except that these trademarks are not recognized by U.S. law**. Like Faux-be beef, this domestic production is undertaken mainly for one reason – to reap the benefit of good will and quality brand reputation created by someone else, namely foreigners who have no recourse in U.S. courts.

&gt; And for that we can thank the U.S. government.

&gt; The Treaty of Madrid in 1891 was among the first major international agreements on the protection of geographically designated food production. These are known today variously as Geographic Indications (GIs), the term collectively favored by the European Union, or by various national terms of geographically protected Designations of Origin (PDO, AOC, DOC, DOCG, etc.). In each case they refer to products so associated with production in a particular place as to warrant protection of that place/product combination. Usually the rationale is a combination of history, manufacturing tradition, terroir, and local law. The product typically grows or is made there better for environmental reasons, like the famously chalky terrain of Champagne or the volcanic soil in which legendary San Marzano tomatoes grow. 

&gt; This is not an oversight, as in, “hey, we forgot to regulate the labeling of Kobe beef.” **This is part of a pattern of deliberate actions going back well over a century on the part of the Federal government to actively ignore foreign trademarks and intellectual property claims in order to support domestic industries. It has very much been done on purpose, and continues to be done on purpose, at the expense of the American consumer (and foreign producers). It is also stunningly hypocritical, and flies directly in the face of the government’s deep pocketed attempts to combat piracy in the arenas of music, film, technology, and software. I think that if we were not the ones who had basically pioneered the computer and software industries, and were not home to Hollywood, and these businesses were based in other countries, we would gleefully produce our own “domestic” versions of foreign software, technology and entertainment without recompense to the countries that had invented and trademarked them.**

This is not just the EU kicking up a fuss about its own products. Their objections highlight an international struggle against the US allowing food makers to forge low-quality imitations of internationally-recognised and trademarked products, then allow American companies to sell these fraudulent products to US consumers as genuine articles, with a price tag to match. The EU has every right to highlight this issue as it is an international problem.",0,1393958834,null,0,false,0,cfu9m5h,t3_1zj0p3,t1_cfu9m5h,t3_1zj0p3,null,1432655859,89,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,89

What's interesting is those states haven't banded together, at least in any public sense. Surely Poland, the Baltics, the Czech Republic and any other willing member could form a very interesting alliance. Certainly one that carries influence in the EU and could possibly force the hand of the other member states. Yet there's nothing of the sort.

I'd also suggest the threat to EU member states such as Poland is far less than they might perceive it. Again that's understandable, but if true its good that the situation hasn't been unduly escalated. And in fairness, this vocal opposition is likely more because it is Russia rather than another nation. Check out the allies from NATO's [2011 Libyan intervention.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya) Check out Operation Ocean Shield. Very similar list. I'm not using that to argue against whether you perceive the west's actions as moral or not, but that the response of Poland, Lithuania et al. maybe more than it would have been had the 'enemy' been anyone other than Russia.

First of all, the world wars are taught to us in a fairly rough manner early on (like 7th grade, where we are 12ish) where we learn what happened and that we are most definitely the bad guys. 
We started 2 world wars because of completely sick reasons.

In 9th and 10th grade our history class was basically all about our relationship to France and the 2nd world war. 

We're told about how Hitler rose to power. Why the people voted for him and supported him until they realized what he actually wanted. Then it was too late, sadly. 

Furthermore, although you could compare him to worse people like Mao Ze Dong (is that his name?) etc. it is never done because it would be insane to be all like ""yeah, Hitler was bad but look at that guy!"". 

Most history classes visit a concentration camp to really magnify how heavy all that actually is. Others atleast watch a documentary where you see how the jews and Hitler's opposition are treated. 

Right now I'm in 12th grade and since 11th we once again had the relationship between France and Germany but this time it started with the French revolution and the time before. How F&amp;G were one empire once and how it was split into 3 and then into 2.

We are told that you and we are really closely related and you're not once the bad guys (although many like to make fun of you, often due to your language, though). Except for Napoleon it has always been us who started the wars and we were worse than him in so many ways. 

Right now our topic is the first world war and our current teacher tells us what happened when and how but what I miss in her way of teaching is that she doesn't really deliver the wrong doing. She just tells us ""This happened then, then that, then that, then Germany lost"". 

Anyway, it still becomes clear for us because we know just how sick Germans were in the past and that we have done a lot of insane shit. (seriously, what did they do when they made up the Schlieffenplan or Operation Gericht?)

Yesterday I presented the Battle of Verdun together with a friend and it once again became clear to all just how sick Germany was. (Over 1000 artillery weapons just to shoot at a small city without militaristic value and they even took 2 of the ""lange Max"" out of ships and used them to launch grenades at the battlefield no matter whether they hit Germans or Frenchs).

All in all it is a very sobering way of teaching us this. It's clear and direct. And the message always is ""We did shit, let's never do this again. Also, we need France and France needs us. We can be proud of our country and how fast it recovered from all of that and is blooming in a diplomatic way for once.""

While I would like to see more unity myself, the only way for our block to expand borders east is by being friendly with Mr. Putin.
As a Romanian myself I appreciate the sentiment; the conflict seems a lot more real the closer you are to Russia I'm afraid.


Now, from a military point of view, I think eastern countries should each respond individually and not bring western EU countries or NATO into this. Yes, our armies are small and not as well equipped but that's not what really matters.


What I expect from the EU is political and economical unity. The expansion of our EU should keep a benevolent image; we don't want to seem like we want to expand, aggressively through military means.

1) Americans (or others) can't tell the difference between good and bad food, so we need to make it so only European-made food can have that name.

Sure they can. Never have I assumed that a cheese from a European tradition was made in Europe because it has that name. I don't assume that my parmesan is from Italy any more than I assume my tomatoes are from South America. If I'm concerned about quality, I look into what I'm buying just as I would with any other product, including meat, fruit, bread, cereal or whatever. There's no confusion at all.

2) AOC protect how a food was always made and what its name always meant.

This is ridiculous, because most AOC are introduced after the product is already well-established. [Feta cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feta_cheese) has been around for hundreds or maybe even thousands of years, and was made an AOC in *2002*. It's fine to then make new standards for ""official Greek feta"" or whatever, but to then say that any cheese made this way anywhere else in the world is somehow not feta anymore is patently absurd.

When I buy corn flakes in Brussels, am I being lied to because they're not made in Michigan, the place of their invention? If it's made an AOC in America tomorrow, does that make the corn flakes I buy in Brussels not corn flakes anymore?

3) Producers invented a high quality product, and they deserve to have it protected from confusion.

Maybe they did, but once a food has become widespread, nobody gets a monopoly on that name. Are Belgian and Swiss chocolate not chocolate because it's not from South America, its place of invention? Remember also, that *there is no confusion*. Unless you say ""Italian parmesan"", or ""French camembert"", nobody will assume that it's from that place. If you *do* specify that it's from Europe, you can probably get a higher price for your product due to the prestige. So you can make an official seal of quality if you're concerned about quality or confusion, but don't displace everyone else from using the normal name for a food.

4) American cheese is gross.

Sure, lots of it is. Some is good. It depends on how much the producer cares. It won't be fixed by blocking the normal names for types of food.

true,imnotrelevanttothis,,78 wesh ma gue-... wait,"You should do your own research and come here with doubts, not whole questions like this that flood the sub... Nevertheless, I will try and answer as many questions as I can...

&gt; In Paris, I will be staying in a hostel with my friend. We both are architecture students and we already kind of know which places we want to visit (cathedrals, etc). I just wanted to know, which is the most reliable way (cheap) to move ourselves to those places? (Example: Saint-Denis Basilica, Versailles, etc.)

Metro, metro, metro, or even just public transport as it's all quite useful and reliable... Use [this RATP website](http://ratp.fr/en/) or [Vianavigo](http://vianavigo.com/en/routes-district-maps/) to calculate the routes to get everywhere ^(within the *région Parisienne*)... You'll need to use RER (regional express network) or even Transilien (another suburban train system owned by another company, same ticketing luckily) to get to some places you'd want to visit.

&gt; From Paris, want to visit many countries like The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Italy, maybe England. Our HUGE doubt is HOW we are going to travel to those places. I really want to use the train but I have no idea how it works because where I live, there are no trains.

As many others have said, use Capitaine Train (only in French, fairly easy to use in any case) or Voyages SNCF for train trips, though I'd personally recommend using Capitaine Train... If not, there are also cheaper train services like [Ouigo](http://ventes.ouigo.com/search.aspx?culture=en-GB), bus services like [IDBus](http://www.idbus.com/) or [Eurolines](http://www.eurolines.fr/en/), and shared car services like [Blablacar](http://www.blablacar.com/?nolang_redirect=1). Personally, for long distances like such, I'd travel using train as it's safer and more confortable...

&gt; Besides the things and recommendations that the awesome redditors have posted, what are some MUST DO things in Paris?

You get at least a post a day in the sub asking exactly what to do, look at the top posts, do a bit of research, you'll find what you're looking for... It really depends what you like, what you don't, etc...

Now, another issue is that your list of destinations is severely wrong geographically and should be corrected:

* **Saint-Denis Basilica**

Metro 13, to St. Denis, not exactly in Paris but right beside it

* **Cathédrale Notre Dame de Paris**

RER B, C, metro 4, 10, quite a few options

* **Notre-Dame of Reims Cathedral**

**NOT** located in Paris/Parisian region, but in Reims, train ride (big train you can't use you metro ticket on) from Gare de l'Est, buy tickets online beforehand 

* **Rouen Cathedral**

**NOT** located in Paris/Parisian region, take the train to Rouen from Gare St. Lazare, buy tickets online beforehand

* **Cathedral of Saint Julian of Le Mans**

**NOT** located in Paris/Parisian region, take to Le Mans from ~~Gare St. Lazare~~ Gare Montparnasse

* **Luxembourg Gardens**

RER B, Luxembourg, located right beside the gardens

* **Eiffel Tower**

RER C, Champs de Mars-Tour Eiffel or Metro 6, Bir Hakeim, but it's too crowded and expensive and there's a better view from the Tour Montparnasse ^(not an actual tour, *tour* means tower in this case), Metro 4, 6, 12, 13, Montparnasse-Bienvenüe

* **Notre-Dame of Amiens Cathedral**

NOT located in Paris/Parisian region, probably train from Gare du Nord

* **Cologne Cathedra**l

**Most definitely NOT** located in Paris/Parisian region, located in **Germany**, probably train from Gare de l'Est

* **Louvre Museum**

Metro 1, 7, Palais Royale-Musée du Louvre, take a few days to see this one, it's huge

* **Beauvais Cathedral**

NOT located in Paris/Parisian region, ~~probably~~ train from Gare du Nord

* **Flower Market**

There are loads, I'd believe, everywhere, just walk down a busy street

* **Arc de Triomphe**

Metro 1, 2, 6, RER A, Charles de Gaulle-Étoile, stop is right under it

* **Musée de l'Orangerie**

Metro 1, 8, 12, Concorde

* **Montmartre**

Either Metro 2, Anvers, or Metro 12 Abesses, also available from Metro 2, 12, Pigalle

* **Notre Dame of Strasbourg Cathedral**

**NOT** located in Paris/Parisian region, take train to Strasbourg from Gare de l'Est

Noone has any doubts about that. CIA itself was helping to record some of the materials from EuroMaidan. But still doesn't change the fact that there's no reason not to post BOTH sides of propaganda like we do now, and show truth when someone is lying.

This picture is a perfect example of propaganda from both sides:

Top you've got ""Crimean militia"" that everyone clearly recognize as trained Russian army, and bottom you've got some child that clearly doesn't have a clue what's going on around him and got almost nothing to deal with the fights between government and EuroMaidan forces. Oh... and the bottom text: ""*Trained and armed in Poland Maidan fascist, founded by the CIA*"" is a prefect example of Putin rhetoric - mixing facts with truth. Yes, there are far-right nationalists in there, yes, the whole business was funded by CIA between many other,  but: No, these people weren't trained in Poland, nor armed by ""West"", post-soviet weapons are quite common in Ukraine but very, very few people used them and it was the government forces who opened fire first - keep that in mind next time you'll think about your ""fascists"" and ""weapons"".

So what happens is that a lot of southern European countries (such as Italy or Greece) are absolutely flooded with asylum seekers who are a huge cost in their societies. Sweden gets a lot too because of illegal smuggling channels and because of Sweden's reputation as refugee-friendly.

It is not really as if Germany kept attacking a very peace minded state, France has always been a very militaristic nation and never shied away from a good war from time to time. 

Take the 1870 war for example, French diplomacy willingly humiliated William II unecessarily by making demands. William II abided in a effort to appease the tensions. Then Bismarck made a speech trying to save the face of William II by depicting him as ousting the French diplomats.

The French got outraged at that and began mobilizing. Seriously. France ended up getting its ass kicked and lost the Alsace and Lorraine in the process. Germany had good reasons to go to war of course and Bismarck was really glad of France's reaction but really France have a lot of faults too here.

&gt; Well, not quite without end, actually – it is all too easy to see how this could end. The Euro is the biggest threat to peace in Western Europe that I have seen in my lifetime.

&gt; So let’s end it now. Rather than waiting for country exits and disorderly collapse (probably when the Franco-German alliance fractures, as it will if France heads into depression), we should put in place plans now for orderly wind-up of the Euro and restoration of national currencies. We should offer debt forgiveness and international aid along the lines of a Marshall plan to those countries that have been so badly hurt by the misbegotten Euro project.

true,Err_Eek,TRAN,Romanian living in Ireland,"Well, I could fill in a whole wall of text and still not be halfway done. Here's just a few points:

- I really enjoy the fact that a lot of the social activities seem to revolve around pubs. Love of drinking is one thing Eastern Europe sure has in common with Ireland. However the ladette culture is really not a thing in Eastern Europe.

- The people are rather welcoming, though reserved by Eastern European standards. I found it a bit puzzling initially that people would be so open to have a conversation in a pub, but then backing out when the conversation became a bit more personal. It's very subtle, but it's there. All this being said, the Irish are one of the friendliest and nicest people that I've ever met.

- The weather sucks big time. I'm quite an indoors person myself and it still manages to bother me.

- Dublin at least is extremely immigrant friendly (if one ignores the scumbags), which is great. Even though I come from a country generally disliked in Europe, I never felt at all discriminated or patronized for my ethnicity in Ireland (actually, there was this one time with a taxi driver, but it was nothing major). I really love walking on streets filled with people and stores and restaurants from all the corners of the world. It's something I couldn't really get home in Romania, and having had the opportunity of knowing, living and working with people from all over the globe is one of the best things that ever happened to me.

- People are way more polite and also less direct than in Eastern Europe. Where in Romania your boss would tell you directly that your work sucks, here it's always so indirect that it's rather easy to miss a criticism which you should have taken into account. Also people are way less touchy feely here, which I blame on the weather -- fucking impossible to hold hands with a girl when there's the coldest wettest wind in all existence blowing at 100km/h on your hand.

- Someone should hand flyers at the airport saying ""thou shalt not say anything negative about Father Ted""

- The way you discuss politics is about a million times more mature than the way it's discussed in Romania

- Irish humor is really not as offensive as Irish people like to describe it. 

- I'm still perplexed by the fact that though miles ahead of Romania in terms of acceptance for sexual minorities and gender equality, abortions are still illegal here and all girls' and all boys' schools (where uniforms are also compulsory!) are still a thing.

And that's barely scratching the surface. Anyways, bottom line, I really like it here. So far Dublin and London are the only places I would consider living in Europe.

true,peggy_olson_draper,null,null,"Dans nombre de médias, elle ne s’appelait plus « Le Pen », mais « Marine ». Ses candidats n'étaient plus « frontistes » ou « lepénistes », mais « marinistes ». Des slogans frontistes étaient repris dans la bouche des journalistes : « vague bleu marine », « dédiabolisation du FN », « FN light », « nouveau FN », « les gars de la Marine ». Et combien de titres où le « national » de « Front national » est passé aux oubliettes ?

La nouvelle présidente du FN avait même fait son entrée dans les magazines people ou féminins qui jusqu’ici tournaient plutôt le dos à son parti : trois pages dans Elle, qui s’interrogeait « Qui est vraiment Marine Le Pen ? » (mars 2011) ; un article dans Paris-Match avec une photo pleine page de Marine Le Pen souriante, titré « Le nouveau visage de l’extrême droite » (novembre 2010) ; un autre dans VSD intitulé « Les secrets d’une fille à papa » (décembre 2010) ; ou encore un quiz « Êtes-vous FN sans le savoir ? » dans le magazine féminin Grazia (mars 2011). En février 2012, elle pose dans Paris-Match au petit-déjeuner avec son compagnon Louis Aliot et évoque pour la première fois le couple qu’ils forment à la ville. 

Le Journal du Dimanche consacre sa une à un cocktail insécurité-FN-fait divers, qui n'est pas sans rappeler l'« affaire papy Voise », à deux jours du 21 avril 2002. L'hebdomadaire décrit un Front national boosté par l’affaire du bijoutier niçois (mis en examen pour homicide volontaire après avoir tué l’un des braqueurs de son magasin). Le JDD relaye en une cette confession de Jean-Marie Le Pen : il « aurai(t) fait la même chose » que le commerçant. Dans un autre article intitulé « le FN ratisse sur Facebook », l'hebdo évoque « le succès de la page ""Soutien au bijoutier de Nice"" » et y voit un « révélateur de l'influence du parti frontiste sur le réseau social ». 

Comme une prophétie autoréalisatrice, plusieurs médias annoncent six mois avant les municipales un raz-de-marée pour le FN. Pour Le Figaro, le parti lepéniste a déjà gagné son pari pour les élections de mars 2014. Le quotidien reprend dans son titre (certes entre guillemets) la formule de « Front municipal » du FN, et décrète que le parti a non seulement « réussi à “dédiaboliser” son image et son discours » mais est aussi « parvenu à nationaliser son implantation ». « Cela paraît incroyable », écrit Guillaume Tabard. Le rédacteur en chef et éditorialiste politique du Figaro fonde toute son analyse sur un sondage CSA-Le Figaro-BFM-TV créditant le FN de 16 % des voix aux municipales. Un pourcentage qu'il compare au score mince du parti aux dernières municipales, en 2008 (0,97 % des voix dans les villes de plus de 3 500 habitants). La chaîne d'info BFM-TV parle quant à elle carrément de « nette poussée du FN ». Le Parisien dédie lui aussi sa une au succès de Marine Le Pen, « la tentatrice » qui « séduit désormais au-delà de ses sympathisants traditionnels ». De son côté, Le Monde consacrait sa manchette de samedi à un FN qui « part à la conquête du pouvoir ». C'est précisément la phrase que répétera tout le week-end le député frontiste Gilbert Collard.

Marine Le Pen sait jouer les « bonnes clientes » pour les médias grâce à un plan de communication parfaitement huilé. À chaque événement du FN, le ralliement surprise d’une personnalité vise à éclipser les questions de fond et détourner le regard des médias de ce qui se joue dans l'arrière-boutique. C’était le cas à son université d’été de 2011, à Nice, où il n’avait été question que des nouvelles recrues du parti (l’avocat Gilbert Collard, le souverainiste Paul-Marie Coûteaux, l’ancien élu parisien UDF Alain Dumait). Pendant deux jours, l'entourage de la présidente du FN avait laissé fuiter l'annonce d'une autre « surprise » (le ralliement de l'ex-patron des RG, Yves Bertrand, qui n’avait finalement pas eu lieu), entretenant le suspense.

Marine Le Pen sait jouer les « bonnes clientes » pour les médias grâce à un plan de communication parfaitement huilé (lire notre enquête). À chaque événement du FN, le ralliement surprise d’une personnalité vise à éclipser les questions de fond et détourner le regard des médias de ce qui se joue dans l'arrière-boutique (lire notre article). C’était le cas à son université d’été de 2011, à Nice, où il n’avait été question que des nouvelles recrues du parti (l’avocat Gilbert Collard, le souverainiste Paul-Marie Coûteaux, l’ancien élu parisien UDF Alain Dumait). Pendant deux jours, l'entourage de la présidente du FN avait laissé fuiter l'annonce d'une autre « surprise » (le ralliement de l'ex-patron des RG, Yves Bertrand, qui n’avait finalement pas eu lieu), entretenant le suspense.  Cette année, pour attirer l’attention, Marine Le Pen a sorti de son chapeau le soutien de Jean Roucas, auteur du “Bébête show”, émission de satire politique de TF1 dans les années 1980-90. Buzz réussi. Les caméras se ruent sur l'humoriste marseillais. Twitter bruisse de la nouvelle. Et Marine Le Pen peut expliquer que ce soutien « rompt avec le terrorisme intellectuel ambiant ». Cette mise en scène permet aussi à Le Pen d’alimenter son storytelling d’un prétendu « nouveau FN ». Car dimanche, l’humoriste a bien différencié deux FN, expliquant qu'il ne se serait pas acoquiné avec celui de Jean-Marie Le Pen dont il ne partageait pas les « propos anciens ». Il a aussi donné un coup de pouce à l'idée selon laquelle le Front national serait le « parti des gens qui souffrent ».Cette mise en scène permet aussi à Le Pen d’alimenter son storytelling d’un prétendu « nouveau FN ».

Il a aussi donné un coup de pouce à l'idée selon laquelle le Front national serait le « parti des gens qui souffrent ». Un autre axe du storytelling de Marine Le Pen a été mis en avant à Marseille et abondamment relayé par les médias : le Front national serait devenu le parti de la jeunesse, une jeunesse disciplinée, militante et bien sous tous rapports. Pour son université d'été, le FN a ainsi imaginé le gadget parfait pour une mise en scène médiatique. Un studio photo où les (jeunes) têtes de listes aux municipales se faisaient maquiller et photographier en vue des élections. De quoi s'assurer plusieurs reportages sur la jeunesse frontiste. Certes, le Front national, en manque de cadres et de candidats, a propulsé aux responsabilités de jeunes militants qui n’auraient jamais connu une telle ascension dans un autre parti. Le renouvellement interne y est bien plus effectif qu'au PS et à l'UMP : 14 % des candidats frontistes aux municipales ont moins de 30 ans, aime-t-on rappeler au FN. Mais la loupe médiatique, ses raccourcis et ses omissions ne sont pas sans conséquence. Ainsi, en avril 2012, Le Monde titre, à deux semaines du premier tour, « Marine Le Pen en tête chez les jeunes ». L'article se fonde sur un sondage portant sur un sous-échantillon réduit de moins de 200 personnes, ce que le quotidien omet de préciser, s'attirant de vives critiques de la commission des sondages. Fin août, Le Point publie une galerie de portraits de la jeune garde du FN intitulée « Jeunes et jolis, bienvenue à la FN Academy ! ». L'article, teinté d'ironie, explique que « pour se rendre plus présentable », le FN « recrute des jeunes BCBG » : « le Roch Voisine de Marine », « le Ryan Goslin du Nord », « les yeux revolver du FN », « la petite fille modèle », « le petit gars de la Marine ». Derrière le second degré, l'effet est dévastateur : l'image d'un FN jeune, normalisé et débarrassé de ses habits d'extrême droite. Au passage, l'article laisse de côté une partie des CV des jeunes loups du FN, comme les accointances de certains avec le GUD (Groupe Union Défense), groupuscule étudiant d'extrême droite.

Et concernant le vote ouvrier:

« Tous les instituts de sondage s’accordent pour dire que les ouvriers votent en moyenne plus pour le Front national que la moyenne de l’électorat, mais l’ampleur de ce vote diffère beaucoup », relève Florent Gougou. Le premier institut à l’annoncer (la Sofres, en 1995) livrait d’ailleurs dans le même temps et selon la même méthode deux sondages avec sept points d’écart (30 % d’ouvriers votant FN dans le premier, 23 % dans le second). Le chercheur rappelle au passage que les ouvriers « ne pèsent que 30 % à 35 % à l’intérieur de l’électorat du FN », alors qu’ils étaient « 50 % au sein du Parti communiste (en 1967 et 1978) ». 

Nonna Mayer démonte deux autres « idées reçues » sur le vote frontiste. D’abord l'idée qu'il serait un « vote de désespérance », que « ce sont les plus pauvres, démunis, qui voteraient FN ». « Qui vote le plus pour Marine Le Pen en 2012 ? Pas les ouvriers précaires – qui, quand ils sont allés voter, ont d’abord voté Hollande. Ce sont les ouvriers non-précaires, dont le vote pour Marine Le Pen a atteint 36,8 %. Ce sont ceux qui ont peur de tomber. Ils regardent vers le haut mais aussi vers le bas désormais, ils ont peur d’être déclassés. » La chercheuse dresse leur profil. Ils sont « un peu plus catholiques, ont un plus fort taux d’équipement des ménages, habitent plus hors des grandes villes, ont un petit diplôme : ils ont un petit quelque chose qu’ils ont peur de perdre ».

Autre mythe déboulonné, l'« effet femme ». « Quand on regarde le monde ouvrier en 2012, hommes et femmes ont voté pareil », explique la chercheuse, qui a noté également, « pour la première fois aussi une explosion du vote pour Marine Le Pen chez les employés de commerce ».

 La proximité avec les idées du FN, encore plus massive que le vote FN. « On l’observe quand on interroge sur ""la préférence nationale"", sur ""le FN est un danger pour la démocratie ?”, “Marine Le Pen incarne l’extrême droite ?”, “il y a trop d’immigrés en France ?” », explique-t-elle en énumérant les statistiques des réponses de l’échantillon, et notamment ce chiffre : « 55 % des ouvriers se disent d’accord avec les idées du FN, contre 34 % de l’électorat. » Ce potentiel est « beaucoup plus élevé dans les milieux populaires », mais « ce sont dans ces catégories que l’on s’inscrit le moins sur les listes électorales. Une bonne partie de cette population défavorisée, ouvrière, ne va pas voter.

Germany is lovely and there are many places to discover. 

One option would be going to a Volkshochschule (VHS), which is very affordable and generally very good, but not too flexible (specific starting dates, limited number of spots, waiting lists etc.)  
Another would be universities, since they are likely to offer DAF (Deutsch als Frendsprache) courses over the summer. All four cities you cited as example are university cities.

* Even though countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela own far more treasuries than Iraq, for simplicity, lets take Iraq's share as 1/15 of this amount (which is *highly* favorable to your argument)
* That puts Iraq's holdings at 0.08% of all US holdings
* Even this far into the calculation, worst case scenario, even if Iraq stopped trading in dollars all together (which is unlikely) it would not cripple the US economy. Many nations already accept alternate currencies for energy, Iran is one and Venezuela is another.
* Lets assumed the US thought Iraq was going to triple their dollar holdings over a 20 year period (Again very unlikely, and *very* favorable to your argument)
* **With your argument in the best light, the first 4 months of war in Iraq easily erased any sustained benefit the US would see from Iraq using dollars. Keep in mind this is with statistics that are *very highly* skewed in your favor.**

This is because the ultimate outcome is the desired effect. If we only care about the number of dead people than other variables should be eliminated.

It might be for example that the passenger kilometers increased greatly in a certain country alongside decreasing numbers of deaths per passenger kilometer. The result would look very positive if you were to look at a statistic that only counts deaths per passenger kilometer. But what we want is the least amount of dead people possible. Therefore such a country might also consider measures to decrease passenger kilometers overall and thereby to lower the absolute number of dead people. Such an improvement would be invisible in your statistic, but still very real.

edit: One example might be a comparison of the USA vs. Germany. The USA actually looks very good in deaths per passenger kilometer, but they also drive a lot, so the number of deaths per million is quite high. In this case the difference might largely be due to the fact that the USA is just that much bigger than Germany, but one factor probably also is Urban planning in the USA. Many of their cities simply require people to travel by car a lot.

Depends what else he loses. He can win Crimea but lose trade deals, G8 membership, a wide spectrum of cooperation and deals that were put in place after the Cold War to help normalise relations between Russia and the world. That plus sanctions and general international condemnation probably add up to a rather greater loss than gain.

Although, slightly more accurately, that's *Russia* losing rather than Putin, so a lot depends on what Putin's actual aims are. If he's setting out to show that Russia can do what it likes in its 'backyard' without consequences, he's already losing. If he's aiming to find out how far he can go at what sort of cost, it's not a win/lose situation. If, say, his aims are personally to be Tsar, then a loss of normal relations with the rest of the world isn't entirely a loss.

If the aim is Crimea-at-any-cost, then he's necessarily going to win in any situation short of successful armed intervention...but I can't see how he could possibly accept defeat in a limited Crimea-only engagement with external powers, so I think it's pretty certain that open military intervention in Crimea is basically a ticket to unlimited war with Russia.",0,1393971298,null,0,1393971525,0,cfufuih,t3_1zk2ef,t1_cfufuih,t1_cfufcut,null,1432658864,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

-Il mio intervento era mirato a contestare l'atteggfiamento da sfigato da cameretta che, dopo aver istallato una distro linux pensa di conoscere l'ict ed il mercato ad essa correlato, andando così a dare giudizi di massima che non solo non stanno in piedi ma che dimostrano anche una gran bella ignoranza del mercato in questione. Ad esempio, certo che il sito di Rainews24 lo puoi fare in HTML5, e personalmente tirerei anche un bel sospiro di solievo. Ma il dirigente Rai non si prenderà mai la responsabilità dinanziaria di avvallare una scelta tecnica che -potrebbe- portarlo a contestazioni. Certo ceh potrebbe avere un moto d'orgoglio, ma come ben sa chi lavora nel campo, 'non one has ever been fired for choosing IBM', conseguentemente la scelta sicura per lo streaming è Flash, che fino a prova contraria è una piattaforma che ha servito stabilmente -miliardi di miliardi- di video via web solo con Youtube. Il discorso del 15enne che viene a dire di fare tutto con Linux è alquanto patetico in questo senso, e non sono neanche entrato nell'aspetto della gestione delle licenze e del'uso dei budget, cosa ancor più imprescindibile della stessa questione tecnica, se sei uscito dalla cameretta e sei entrato in una telco, ad esempio, figuriamoc in Consip.

-sono nato col Vic20, poi mi sono fatto una delle prime distro linux, la SlackWare, poi in uni ho girato con HP-UX, Irix, Solaris. Correntemente lavoro alla progettazione ed implementazioni di grosse piattaforme distribuite che sono quasi tutte, guess what, basate su *nix (Debian+Solaris). Quindi non mi definirei un Windowsiano. Ma l'esempio che hai fatto tu è una cazzata. Hai citato i tipici esempi da manuale dove l'opex della soluzione è vagamente reso sopportabile dal risparmio capex (licenze Microsoft, salto di un ciclo di ricambio hardware limitazione della soluzione alla sola Office Automation). E' praticamente un colpo di culo che và già a mostrarsi per quello che è appena devi fattorizzare il costo dell'assistenza sistemistica (che è ben diversa rispetto a quella Windows) e del primo turnover del ferro. E guardacaso sono, al pari dei libri per vegani, gli unici casi che tutti citano. Non parliamo poi dell'adozione ormai crescente di soluzioni di byod o terminalizzazione che, se conosci il mercato, vaporizzano qualsiasi possibilità di usare *nix. La verità è che Linux, fuori dalla sala server, ha definitivamente perso. E questo già da dieci anni, quando ci fu il grande surge delle IDE per linux, andato poi a frantumarsi in migliaia di piccole correntine interne, roba che il PD con Sel e Rifondazione in confronto sembravano dei dilettanti. And btw, se vai a guardare il timeframe del progetto LiMux, vedrai che è spalmato in dieci anni, dal 2003 al 2013+. In quale realtà economica che non sia statale puoi pensare di fare una scommessa del genere avendo un ritorno di -soli- 10M a fronte di rischi immensi?

true,thedingoismybaby,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Not only that but all the Health &amp; Safety rules that get slated do a lot for our mortality rate. Haven driven across Europe some of their roads are damn scary. Roads in the UK have rules about widths, safety protections (e.g. crash barriers, lighting, etc), road condition and other things which other countries just don't.

On holiday in Cyprus I saw the road half torn up for roadworks on a main road, with no lighting, where in the UK it would have been coned off for half a mile before hand and well light there it had a couple of cones at the start and that was it, move a couple of inches to the side and you'd fall into a large hole.

We might go to the extreme (I'm looking at you lane closures for miles because of one works van fixing a pot hole in the middle of the night) however it does save lives.

The other thing is I think we were well ahead of the curve with drink driving being taken seriously and going out of fashion.

Guessing as well as a smaller country we have simply less roads for people to crash on, and our large motorways are well constructed leaving most accidents to occur in stop/start city traffic at lower speeds where death is less likely. Majority of more serious accidents happen outside the urban area[1]

Finally as a richer country we can generally afford newer cars, with better safety standards.

&gt; [1] Collisions were more likely on unclassified rural roads, with excess speed being more likely on 30 mph roads, and inappropriate speed on 60 mph rural roads.

The EU will do *everything in it's current powers* to save the doomed EURO. It's a political project and the EURO is a key piece in the jigsaw for SUPRANATIONAL (super-imposing over democratic government) Ruling.

[Chapter 24 — Liberal Leader Mackenzie King Said in 1935](http://www.michaeljournal.org/plenty24.htm)

&gt;*“Once a nation parts with the control of its currency and credit, it matters not who makes that nation's laws. Usury, once in control, will wreck any nation. Until the control of the issue of currency and credit is restored to government and recognized as its most conspicuous and sacred responsibility, all talk of the sovereignty of Parliament and of democracy is idle and futile.""*

&gt;*“The Liberal Party believes that credit is a public matter, not of interest to bankers only, but of direct concern to every citizen. The Liberal Party declares itself in favour of the immediate establishment of a duly constituted national bank for the control of the issue of money in terms of public needs. The flow of money must be in relation with the domestic, social, and industrial needs of the Canadian people.”*

You might start concluding the sort of shadow world government is driving the creation of the EU...

Like a cancer, the political, interest-based, debt-money system corrupts everything it touches. It’s time it was replaced. This is the fifth article in our series on the role of money in the transformation of society.

&gt;*""When I was born, the world’s population numbered something like two billion people. Today it is estimated to be well over 7 billion, more than three and a half times the level of one lifetime ago. This is but one example of exponential or geometric growth, meaning growth that proceeds at an accelerating rate.""*

&gt;*""But population growth is not the biggest problem that faces civilization. There is one thing that has been growing exponentially at an even faster rate than population or economic output, and that is debt.""*

And here's the money shot:

&gt;*""The present global monetary regime is a collusive arrangement between politics and high finance. By monetizing their budget deficits, this system enables national governments to spend far more than their income from taxes and other sources, while granting banks the privilege of creating money in the form of debt, and then charging interest for its use.""*

&gt;""**The main reason for the centralized control of credit and money has nothing to do with helping the economy to operate more efficiently. The motive is political: centralization enables the undemocratic control of everything else. It thereby concentrates wealth and power in the hands of the few.

Primo: lasettimana scorsa volevo aprire un thread proprio come questo ma poi non l'ho fatto.

Secondo: é successo 3 anni fa proprio in questo periodo.

Era la sessione di esami e dovevo completare assolutamente un progetto per il giorno successivo. Stavo in cucina a lavorare con il portatile. 

Alle 4 di notte riuscii a terminare il progetto. Spensi il portatile, pisciatina in bagno col brividino terminale, ritorno in cucina per prendere i libro e mi avviai verso la mia camera.

La mia camera (ci dormono anche i miei fratelli) é molto grande, con un tavolo leggermente decentrato in fondo a destra mentre il letto é tutto a sinistra.

 Di solito spengo la luce della stanza dietro di me e accendo quella della stanza successiva (sai com'é... meglio essere sicuri ahah e poi ho sbattuto troppe volte contro la porta che credevo fosse aperta) ma quella volta avevo spento la luce in cucina e andai direttamente in camera al buio con il libro in mano.

Ero stanco morto e con mio grande stupore i mignoli dei piedi e la mia faccia erano stati risparmiati dalla porta. 

Camminavo con la sguardo sui libri per la stanchezza mentre con la mano destra palpavo l'aria con insicurezza per evitare ostacoli. 

Arrivato in camera andai verso il tavolo per posare i libri, quando con la coda dell'occhio vidi una sagoma ai piedi del mio letto. Era quasi fluorescente, on luminosa. Come quelle cose che vediamo con gli occhi chiusi dopo aver visto una fonte luminosa. Solo che io gli occhi li avevo aperti e d'istinto mi voltai verso la sagoma. Questa improvvisamente venne velocemente dritta su di me e mi attraversó letteralmente il corpo.

Rimasi pietrificato dalla testa ai piedi e subito il gelo intenso attraversó il mio corpo fin dentro alle ossa e lo stomaco e la pelle d'oca era fortissima.

Il tutto (sguardo, attraversamento e gelo con pelle d'oca) dove essere durato 6-7 secondi. Al che mi infilo nel letto e affondo sotto le coperte per qualche minuto per calmarmi.

La diarrea non aveva fine, ci sarebbe voluto un autospurgo per quanto mi ero cacato addosso quella volta.

true,Cai_E,UNSA,United States of America,"On the American side, supposedly the aim is to fact track the new Ukrainian government into a NATO partnership.  Ukraine is not NATO ready, but a few politicians have suggested we create a special category for them where they get the defensive benefits, but not full benefits, until military reforms are complete.  America is already offering Ukraine a fairly nice aid package and rallying IMF/G7 pressure for the same.  

The long term solution is honestly to continue support of Poland and Ukraine. In the unwelcome and unlikely event of war, both those countries appear to have the will and the ability put hard assets on the table.  The Baltics as well, but they're indefensible.  About the best they can hope for is a fighting retreat into Poland and a NATO counterattack.  For that matter Poland seems positioned to be a good supplier of advisors and such to Ukraine.  As an American I'm come out of this conflict with the belief our military support missions to European partners need to be rethought.  If some countries are pissing themselves in terror at the thought of sanctions and their own markets dropping, I hate to see what they'd do if the war went hot.    

No one is getting killed in Crimea and we can continue to offer support to the Ukrainians to continue nonviolent confrontations and staring down the Russians so hopefully no one is killed.  If Russia goes full retard and starts putting rounds in bodies, we'll need to revisit the military solution.

As an American, what annoys me the most, is certain European countries having no ability to even huff.  Specifically the ones say no sanctions and such.  I'd like to see Europe and America united in kicking the Russian economy in the nuts on a regular basis.  On Monday, Russia became 60 billion poorer.  If in a week everyone would get on board with going back to the G7 and issue statements, that would take out some more.  You don't even have to make the move, just skip Sochi and sign off on some indefinitely hiatus type of agreement.  Then in a couple weeks, Germany can announce how it wants to restart the nukes and be on electric heat next winter and kick Gazprom stock in the balls.  So on and so forth.  Make the kind of statements that make it hard for Russia to rebound economically and hopefully push them further into a slump.  

At the end even, Europe doesn't have to fuck itself other.  Make the scary noises, or just nod in agreement when the Americans talk sanctions, and let the invisible hand of the market bitch slap the ruble and the Moscow Exchange every couple of weeks for the next few months.  

We can even give Putin an offramp.  Agree Ukraine was unstable and send in a UN peackeeping force with a mandate and everything to protect the Russians, Tartars, etc.  Russia can even send some troops to participate (and we can all monitor them)  Sit down and work with Putin to draft up a face saving UN resolution.  If he stalls or drags his feet, poke the Russian economy with targeted action.  

I mean I even own BP stock and I'm not excited about the idea of it underperforming for the next six months (since BP owns a share of some Russian companies), but I'm even less excited about Russian control of Crimea and Putin feeling like he can act with impunity in Eastern Europe.  BP slumping is a lot cheaper than my tax dollars supporting extensive armored operations in Europe.

Un paio di anni fa si sentiva un rumore strano di notte in casa, come se un qualcosa di piccolo in metallo (che so, un bullone, una sfera di metallo) cadesse per terra e rimbalzasse un paio di volte. Questo rumore avveniva ad intervalli quasi regolari e solo di notte, per lo stesso motivo descritto da te: il rumore generale lo nascondeva, ma di notte era chiaro.

Per settimane mi sono chiesto che cacchio fosse, anche perché proveniva dalla nostra soffitta, e là sopra non abbiamo nulla se non il ""laboratorio"" di mia madre (con lavatrice, macchina per cucire, stendipanni etc.) e roba vecchia ed inutile, tipo un albero di natale di plastica che non usiamo da anni. E anche se fosse stato qualcosa che cadeva, come faceva a cadere di continuo? Tornava alla posizione iniziale e si buttava giù dal tavolo di nuovo?

Feci diversi sopralluoghi notturni, con una torcia e con una certa paura di trovarci qualcosa, ma niente. Anzi, sembrava che ogni volta che salissi in soffitta, il rumore si interrompeva e riprendeva solo dopo che fossi tornato giù. Esaurite le idee, iniziai anche io a pensare ad un gombloddo degli spiriti, invece il problema era più scemo di quello che pensassi.

In cantina abbiamo un vecchissimo frigorifero che ogni tanto vibra. Qualcuno l'aveva spostato per qualche motivo e finiva per sbattere sul muro dietro di lui ogni volta che vibrava. Il muro dove sbatteva è tipo una colonna portante di tutta la nostra casa, e per qualche oscuro gioco di acustica, sembrava che il rumore venisse dalla soffitta.

Io ti parlo per esperienza diretta, nello specifico Ammonistrazione Difesa.

 Prendi la gestione delle mense. Prima della CONSIP, il responsabile di mensa aveva una sua assegnazione con la quale acquistare materie prime, ingredienti e forniture. Quello che avveniva in genere è che detto responsabile si recava di persona dai grossisti, nei mercati, nei porti, nelle cooperative agricole della zona e contrattava. Sulle tavole arrivava roba locale, spesso fresca e a buon mercato (pensa al km zero ante litteram). Cucinata di merda, per carità...sempre mensa militare è. Però, per esempio, a Pozzuoli arrivava la mozzarella di bufala campana, a Treviso avevano il vinello della zona, a Udine il prosciutto locale ecc. ecc. ora la roba è presa in ""convenzione"" un tot alla tonnellata. Sulle tavole campane arriva la mozzarella di Milano, confezionata e a scadenza quinquennale. In Friuli hanno il prosciutto della Lidl con ancora i riflessi verdastri.

They might elect the Communists again, stop the Association Agreement and try to have a fling with the Russians, but there's nothing Russia can do to give them meaningful access to whatever trade the Customs Union would provide.

e poi

&gt; on December 2013 the city of Munich announced that it successfully migrated 12,000 of its 15,000 computers to LiMux Linux and that the savings in 2013 alone were about 10 million euros.

i 10M di euro sono solo del 2013. Non di tutto il periodo.

Detto questo, tutto il resto non lo commento perché il tuo tono non è di confronto ma di polemica ed a me interessa poco (solo mi permetto di fare il sapientino e correggerti probabilmente al posto di «IDE» intendevi dire «GUI», gli IDE sono ambienti usati da noi programmatori per scrivere codice, le GUI sono un'altra cosa, comunque anche in questo caso la tua frase sottointende che non ti è chiara la differenza tra desktop environment e window manager, ma lasciamo perdere...).

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"Because the competences of responding to the crisis in any meaningful way aren't held by the EU, but with the individual member states, who are a famously divided lot on matters of foreign policy.  The East lived under the Soviet jackboot for decades, and understands the political necessities of banding together to stand up to Russia. They're playing the long game here. The West acts only in short term economic interests. The UK wants to protect finance in London, the French have a contract to build two warships for Russia, the Germans don't want to change the relationship they set with Russia almost a decade ago under Merkel and lose their stable gas prices. In addition, none of them want to risk losing access to Russian energy resources. The intervention in Libya, for example, only happened because of the disruption of Libyan energy supplies to Europe. During the Libyan civil war, energy resources stopped flowing as various groups vied for control, prompting the West to intervene. 

So they support Ukraine in a political, don't really do anything, kind of way, and they detest Putin (at one meeting a number of years back, Putin brought two humongous dogs to it because he knew that Merkel was absolutely terrified of them), but they want to keep the nascent economic recovery going. They wanted to be reelected, after all.

I doubt they will make any moves that jeapordize their position, unless the US takes a very firm stance. And even then, it's not a certainty.

Personally, I agree that the US should take a stand. The Eastern European leaders such as in the Baltics and Poland simply aren't powerful enough to make any sort of problem for Russia, despite desperately trying to rally the rest of the EU. Hell, even the tiny Czech Republic has done more than the West has, by saying it's going to cancel deals for the Russians to build two nuclear reactors in the country, while France continues to sell Russia weapons. The West is having a catastrophic failure of leadership, and are horrendously damaging the EU's image, and it's cohesion as it created a schism between Western and Eastern countries, much as there already exists one between Southern and Northern ones.",0,1393978238,null,0,1393978965,0,cfuj6v9,t3_1zkso1,t1_cfuj6v9,t3_1zkso1,null,1432660436,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4
true,wongie,EURO,European Union,"The EU's response has been muted because it's a trading bloc not a sovereign entity. Matters of foreign affairs usually falls to national governments to respond; some people here aren't quite ready for a common foreign and security policy, or as one voice. Unlike the US many EU countries are heavily reliant on Russian gas exports and there's a practical limit to how much posturing and action they can take before risking their own energy security. UK on the other hand is more concerned about the effect any drastic action will have on their financial markets which much of British GDP is dependent on. So to reiterate, the EU cannot hurt Russia without hurting itself economically.

The EU definitely supports the interim government, after all, the spark that started all this was Yanukovych's decision to abandon plans for closer ties to the EU which they wanted as part of their eastern expansion. I can tell you unequivocally that not one EU country supports Putin, especially former Soviet-satellite states like Poland and the Czech Republic who have been the most vocal against Russian aggression; they still have fresh memories of Soviet rule.

I don't think anyone over here is expecting America to take the lead, nor for the EU because as I said it's a trading bloc. Instead people will want to look to their national governments for action, if any at all. I think the sentiment is that people want to wait it out except for the Ukrainians who are probably looking for EU or American support, who ever offers it. And although I'm sure they'd welcome US help, I get the feeling west-Ukraine prefers solidarity with the EU, after all they want to be part of the EU, not the US. 

As for American intervention, I'm certainly not afraid of Russia, even without US involvement there's no way Russia could militarily and economically take on a unified EU, but America's posturing is useful in a bad-cop kind of way; they get to take all of Putin's irk.",0,1393978264,null,0,1393978855,0,cfuj7b7,t3_1zkso1,t1_cfuj7b7,t3_1zkso1,null,1432660443,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Guadagnano facendo concerti e vendendo merchandising. L'esperienza del cinema è allo stesso modo difficilmente riproducibile a casa propria, quindi la gente continua ad andare al cinema anche se può scaricare il divx. Per il libro resta il poter avere in mano una bella edizione invece di un file su un Kindle. Eccetera.

Sia chiaro che a me però *non interessa* come farebbero a guadagnare. Se possono farlo, ben venga, ma che lo facciano o come è irrilevante. Che essi guadagnino qualcosa da quello che mettono in vendita non è un diritto. Mi spiego, altrimenti sembra che io sia per il lavoro gratis. 

Un venditore di arance si fa un culo tanto per coltivare e vendere arance. Ha il diritto di essere pagato, se io prendo le arance da lui. Ma se io prendo una sua arancia, pianto i semi e produco altre arance, non devo mica pagargli nulla. Non ha il diritto sulle arance che nascono dai suoi semi, solo perchè senza di lui non avrei avuto i semi.

Le arance sono, infatti, un bene riproducibile. Ora, il motivo per cui le paghiamo dal fruttivendolo è che è pur sempre *costoso* da riprodurre. Quindi decidiamo, invece di duplicare le nostre copie dell'oggetto-arancia, di andare da qualcuno che si sobbarca le spese di copiatura e vende copie di questo oggetto.

Per i file digitali è la stessa identica cosa, solo che questo costo di copiatura è praticamente nullo. Quindi conviene non andare necessariamente dal negozio di dischi/libri/film (il fruttivendolo) e copiare autonomamente. Non esiste nessun diritto intrinseco al dover pagare copie di qualcosa che posso copiare -deve infatti essere introdotto come *forzatura* legale. 

A questo si aggiunge il fatto che copyright e brevetti *impoveriscono* il panorama intellettuale ed economico, rendendo più difficile e costoso riutilizzare e distribuire idee e concetti. Per cui non si tratta solo di un assurdo, ma si tratta anche di un assurdo pernicioso e controproducente, e che soffoca proprio quella creatività che nelle intenzioni vorrebbe proteggere.

Penso che essere costretti a pagare qualcosa prima di sapere se ci piace o no sia fondamentalmente una cosa ingiusta. Di quelle tre categorie di prodotti, viene fornita zero anteprima - la musica un poco ti dà tra radio e MTV (esiste ancora?) - ma pochissimo. Sono acquisti a scatola chiusa e non mi vanno giù.

Io sono dispostissimo a pagare soldi per qualcosa che mi piace, per sostenere il produttore. L'ho fatto e lo faccio regolarmente. Però voglio farlo con cognizione di causa, non ha senso che io spenda 50€ per un videogioco AAA solo per poi scoprire che mi fa cagare, è un'ingiustizia colossale e quasi una truffa.

C'è un altro caso in cui sono disposto a pagare a scatola chiusa: il fattore premium. Mi piace collezionare CD di musica; adoro i concerti; vado spesso al cinema; e ci metto dentro le collector's edition dei giochi. Quello è giusto che si paghi in quanto sono prodotti che vanno oltre il contenuto artistico/l'intrattenimento: o sono cose materiali (anche se i CD sono lolexpensive in Italia), o sono appunto premium come il cinema o il concerto. Coincidentalmente, questo tipo di cose sono quelle che fanno arrivare al produttore la percentuale più alta dei guadagni.

Molti cantanti e gruppi ormai offrono anteprime gratis e i Radiohead avevano addirittura offerto un album digitale gratis - tanto è con i concerti che guadagnano, i CD la maggior parte va ai produttori. L'industria cinematografica è tutto tranne che in crisi e gli attori famosi sono multimilionari, tanto che gli unici a incazzarsi per i film piratati sono le case di produzione mangione. I videogiochi anche vanno in questa direzione: tutti i tentativi di DRM fatti finora hanno avuto come unico effetto di peggiorare l'esperienza di chi aveva pagato mentre chi piratava non aveva problemi... il produttore di The Witcher 2 ha ammesso che il suo gioco è stato piratato 4 volte per ogni volta che è stato comprato, ma dice: ""tanto se non l'avessero piratato non ci avrebbero giocato proprio, a sto punto mi fanno pubblicità con gli amici..."" e questo è un ragionamento che per me e i miei amici è validissimo. Esempio: Minecraft. L'ho cominciato a giocare a sbafo, fatto vedere agli amici, abbiamo deciso che ci piaceva, pagato (tutti) il gioco e messo su un server. Senza piratare probabilmente non ci saremmo presi.

So, from the get-go: if you're looking for a riveting storyline and cool characters, pokemon aren't it. the story sucks. All the fun things happen post-game when you start building your team and creating the best pokemon possible.


But to just get a feel for the very basic game mechanics, I'd recommend you find a free version online to play. My recommendation is Crystal, it should be pretty easy to find. You should be able to download a simulater easily to either your phone or computer.

But if you have a DS and you live in barca, I can lend you my copy of BW no problem.

So yeah, this is a game that gets really complicated once you get into strategy and EV/IVs etc, but I think it would still be a good idea to just see if you like the basic gameplay before buying anything.

If you after this find it like something you could get into (essentially just collecting monsters, and then playing a turned-based strategy game with them) you should buy x and y. Best games in the franchise, definitly. Great graphics and so so horribly fun (in my opinion.)


EDIT:

Also, a few links.

Quick intro to competetive play: http://projectpokemon.org/forums/showthread.php?14545-GUIDE-Basics-to-Competitive-Battling

best pokemonwiki: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net


Also, regarding the easy/boring main story: It's quite popular among the older fanbase to make the main storyline a bit more challenging by having 2 extra rules.

 Rule nr 1: if a pokemon faints it can't be used anymore (it dies.) and rule nr 2: you can only catch one pokemon per route. This way it makes the main story a bit more fun and challenging.

I bet your classmates will be able to help you out on that front. 

For trains, the Italian national company is [Trenitalia](http://www.trenitalia.com), good for all your domestic travel (internal flights aren't worth the trouble, if you want to go anywhere in italy take the train). There's also [Italo](http://www.italotreno.com), a private competitor that has high-speed trains from Torino to major Italian cities (Milan, Florence, Rome, Naples). The French TGV connects Torino to Paris via Lyon. Not sure how to book that though, ask google :)

For the rest of Europe, check low cost airlines. Vueling, Easyjet and Ryanair all connect italy to lots of other places (Vueling is a Spanish airline, check them for Madrid/Barcelona), but you might have to fly out of Milan, since he Turin airport isn't a major one. There are buses from downtown Torino to MXP though, it's only about two hours.

Vor der Abschiebung hat man oft genug keine Zeit seelenruhig seinen Koffer zu packen. Da kommen um fünf Uhr früh die Bundespolizisten und dann hat man ne halbe Stunde. Von den Freunden wird sich nicht verabschiedet, nach dem Kofferpacken geht's direkt an den Flughafen oder in die Abschiebehaft. Das Spielzeug kriegen die auch nicht. Um einen herum sind ständig bewaffnete, bullige Männer, die einen herumscheuchen. Im Flugzeug sitzt du vielleicht am Fenster, toll. Aber Papa neben dir ist mit Handschellen festgeschnallt, weil er etwas lauter wurde als feststand, dass sie abgeschoben werden.

Und wenn man dann angekommen ist gibt es oft genug keine Tante oder andere Verwandte wo man unterkommen kann. Stattdessen ist man erstmal obdachlos. Die meisten Ländern, in die abgeschoben wird, kümmern sich im Grunde gar nicht um solche Rückkehrer. Die Eltern finden keinen Job. Man kämpft ums Nötigste. Post aus Deutschland kriegt man nicht weil man keine Adresse hat und wenn man eine hat, kennt die noch niemand in Deutschland. Zur Schule geht man vielleicht auch nicht mehr, weil alle mit den Formalien überfordert sind oder Schulbildung ein Privileg und kein Grundrecht im Abschiebeland sind. Und mit den anderen Kindern kann man nicht spielen, weil man deren Sprache nicht versteht. Kulturschock kann für Kinder schon hart sein, wenn ein Umzug ins Ausland monatelang geplant wird. Bei einer Abschiebung kann das Kind praktisch von heute auf morgen in einer völlig fremden Welt landen.

Das und vieles mehr kann abgeschobene Asylbewerber erwarten. Natürlich muss es das nicht, vielleicht sind es nur ein oder zwei Punkte von denen, die ich aufgelistet habe. Oder gar keine. Aber oft genug passiert es halt.

Wenn das Rote Kreuz meint, den ganzen Vorgang verniedlichen zu müssen, bitte. Den Kindern wird es nicht helfen.

Wie ihnen die nackte Angst in den Augen hängt, weil es dort wo sie hinkommen, keine Zukunft für sie gibt. *Das* ist was hängenbleiben wird bei den Kindern.

Es hat herzlich wenig Relevanz, dass das Rote Kreuz nichts mit Abschiebungen zu tun hat. Solch eine weltfremde Verklärung des Abschiebeprozesses schadet den Kindern eher, als dass es nutzt.

http://www.bahn.com/i/view/GBR/en/about/overview/ice-in-london.shtml

As to why you might take the train instead of the plane, consider this:  Typical train itinerary:

12:00 Leave house
12:30 Arrive HbF
12:35 Board Train
Uninterrupted smooth, relaxing, useful work time including (on ICE) power outlets and Wi-Fi.  You can sometimes use your phone too.
16:35 Exit train
17:05 Arrive Destination

Most Airports are further away from parts of the city you're likely to be going to than the HbF, say, 15-20 minutes average.

12:00 Leave house
12:45 Arrive Airport
12:55 Check Bags
13:10 Clear Security
13:15 Walk to Gate
13:20 Wait at Gate
13:30 Board Plane
13:45 Take off
14:00 You're allowed to use your laptop, not likely to have internet.
14:30 Have to put away laptop
14:45 Land, arrive at gate
15:05 Walk Through airport, pick up bags
15:55 Arrive at Destination

I think that this scenario is quite typical.  So the airline trip is an hour less clock time, but you have 4 hours sitting in a comfortable seat able to work instead of half an hour in a cramped seat with no internet.

The problem is that in a grocery store, all you have to go on is the label given.  The label says wasabi, but I don't know if it's really wasabi or green-dyed horseradish until I eat some.  Do you honestly think there's a grocery store in the US that's going to let me open the package to taste some and not buy it if it's not real?  

Now there's is a difference between a cultural food (Feta, Wasabi, Chianti, or Dim Sum), and a new manufactured product.  Corn Flakes are not an ancient recipe.  There's no long history of making Corn Flakes and eating Corn Flakes as a special cultural food.  nor, are most cultural foods made in factories on assembly lines.  

They are chocolates.  What isn't fair is that some people are deciding to make chocolates of similar style and pass them off as being Swiss Chocolates when they're brown colored sugar treats from Newark that don't have more than 1% Cocao in them.  

They're literally banking on the confusion of the consumer.  They're banking on making an impressive-looking package, putting a European food label on it, and having suburban housewives thinking that they're living the high life because the bought a package of cheese labeled ""Brie'.  Unless the public is made aware of imposter products trading on the name, the American public will never catch on to the differences between psuedobrie and real brie. 

And since food manufacturers are not interested in hurting sales with honesty, someone has to enforce a reasonable standard of who can and cannot use the name of an undeniably cultural food with a reputation stretching back centuries.  AOC is a reasonable effort to do that, to make sure that a brie is actually a brie, that a wasabi tube actually contains wasabi rather than green puree of horseradish, and kimchee is actually kimchee and not American cabbage rotting in a hole under my grandma's front porch.

Ukraine getting protected by NATO would also mean that there is an obligation to do something once shit hits the fan.

Once they are joined in though, we (the NATO states) could get roped in into something we don't want. But it is good that there is some action on the table nevertheless.

On the ""why doesn't Europe do more""-issue, I think that is what this whole sub is talking about right now. I am surprised and a little shamed as well that America went about to give 1 billion straight away without much talking. But there are also some very good points against escalating the conflict further, and rumors say Putin feels threatened. So any step taken must be cautiously designed to not make Putin feel any more threatened. Sending advisors into Ukraine would confirm his prejudice of a western-backed armed revolution.

The main thinking is that most people are right-eye dominant; that is, the mind processes images from the right eye first. This is overwhelming amongst the general population and is not in any way related to hand dexterity. The advantage of driving on the left, then, is that oncoming traffic is on your right, in view of your 'stronger' eye.

This apparently applies equally to people who drive on the left and the right, and the cause is unknown.

(Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Åland), and we don't have much sway with the rest of world politically or culturally - so whenever one of them gets attention, the others feel left out/jealous of the attention given. This is especially true because the Nordics are so similar in more ways than one. You'd be hard pressed to find a similar group of countries that share so many qualities, both politically, culturally, and socially.

The little used car dealers, called Kiesplatzhändler or Fähnchenhändler, have a mostly bad reputation...and most of them deserve it. You should avoid them or have the car checked out by another instance, Dekra or another shop. Ask for a test drive and have it checked.
Most german daily newspapers come with ""Kleinanzeigenmarkt"" once a week (typically wednesday). Its actually worth it to check them out. Thing is, those newspaper ads are out of date...and there aren't many people left who use them. But old people still use them and you can score a well-kept Rentnerauto in this way.
And check out your nearest kiosk, there are papers solely consisting of kleinanzeigen.

Things you should consider: Tüv. Every car has to be inspected every two years. Its a thorough inspection and if youbuy a 15 year old car with 2 month of Tüv left, chances are youre gonna pay another 1000€ to make it able to pass.


I always prefer to buy used cars from private owners and not from dealerships, at least if my budget is below 5000€ or so. Sure, you won't get any warranty, but imho the chances are much lower to get scammedwith fake milage or faked Tüv.
