true,iisno1uno,LITH,Lithuania,"&gt;I am saying that the thing currently under construction in Lithuania is not Rail Baltic because it doesn't connect any Baltic states to each other.

trolling? or yet again delusions kick in? 

Rail Baltica is one of the priority projects of the European Union: Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T). The project is supposed to link Finland, the Baltic States and Poland and also improve the connection between Central and Northern Europe and Germany. It envisages a continuous rail link from Tallinn (Estonia), to Warsaw (Poland), going via Riga (Latvia) and Kaunas (Lithuania). 

http://ec.europa.eu/transport/wcm/infrastructure/ten-t_map_project_portfolio.pdf

go ahead, have fun reading and enlightening yourself.

problem is not with me, rather with you ""not calling it RailBaltic"" when everyone in EU is doing so.

&gt;I seriously doubt about Lithuania's interest in it.

should I repeat myself 4th time? Lithuania doesn't have as big as interest to be connected to Estonia as Estonia has interest to be to connected to Lithuania. that's why we will not agree on expensive and unnecessary (for us) 240km/h project.

&gt;Huh? You do know how railways work, don't you? By up to 240km/h it means that such speed can be achieved only in long straight uninhabited strechtes with proper signalisation and conditions, but not in curves and inhabited areas.

do you tho? you started talking rubbish from your first post telling how we should build 240km/h rail network. straight lines, strong banks, bridges, tunnels, resettlement of population. and that's what I told you from the beginning - it's not gonna happen.

how old are you may I ask you?

What I suggested replaces a centralized undemocratic EU bureaucracy which drives the political process according to backstage political dealings centered around the Commission with a large, decentralized parliamentary body responsible to its constituents.  The institution gains some more legitimacy while losing many of its teeth.  That would be a step forward compared to what we have now especially if there grew a direct link between the people and the new parliament - bypassing national governments. If we could get to move federalization in the other direction too - turn all of the member countries into proper federations instead of unitary regimes it might be even better.

It would produce a huge political entity with a lot of inertia with regards to international matters but as soon as people got the hang of it it would become fairly flexible for internal  matters - economy, legal issues etc. The biggest problem currently is lack of flexibility. EU pushes a single plan for everyone and the national governments - each of them - have a single plan of their own. There's absolutely no room for actual human scale to appear. Small regions, cities - those are the important political entities. Essentially a return to pre-nationalist Europe only without monarchies.

&gt; Rail Baltica is one of the priority projects of the European Union: Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T). The project is supposed to link Finland, the Baltic States and Poland and also improve the connection between Central and Northern Europe and Germany. It envisages a continuous rail link from Tallinn (Estonia), to Warsaw (Poland), going via Riga (Latvia) and Kaunas (Lithuania).
&gt; http://ec.europa.eu/transport/wcm/infrastructure/ten-t_map_project_portfolio.pdf
&gt; go ahead, have fun reading and enlightening yourself.

Your source is outdated. I'm talking about high-speed Rail Baltic that would be financed from EU budget 2014-2020, not 2007-2013. I guess that LitPol link is financed from the earlier budget.

&gt; problem is not with me, rather with you ""not calling it RailBaltic"" when everyone in EU is doing so.

All right, all right, I already told you I don't care about the name, call it whatever you want.

&gt; should I repeat myself 4th time? Lithuania doesn't have as big as interest to be connected to Estonia as Estonia has interest to be to connected to Lithuania. that's why we will not agree on expensive and unnecessary (for us) 240km/h project.

But I already gave you a source where Lithuania has already agreed on it. 

&gt; do you tho? you started talking rubbish from your first post telling how we should build 240km/h rail network. straight lines, strong banks, bridges, tunnels, resettlement of population. and that's what I told you from the beginning - it's not gonna happen.

Oh, too bad there're Lithuanian politicans' signatures already on that 'rubbish' project.

1) L'état actuel : les distinctions charges patronales et salariales sont des détails comptables. Ce qui compte concrètement, c'est bien ce que le patron est prêt à payer pour avoir un salarié (voir les arguments des partisans du ""salaire complet"").


2) A quelques détails près, si les entreprises n'avaient pas à payer les charges patronales et que ce montant ""revenait"" alors au salarié, l'équivalent serait simplement ajouté aux charges salariales. Même somme payée par le patron, même salaire net touché par le salarié, même somme ponctionnée par l'état que pour le scénario 1.


3) Si les charges patronales étaient supprimées sans contrepartie (on a le droit de rêver), effectivement on peu douter du fait que la somme soit à tout les coups reversée au salariée :

- Cas d'un salaire supérieur au smic: a priori oui. Pour les mêmes raisons que le salarié en question n'est justement pas au smic. Le salarié est en position de faire jouer la concurrence entre les employeurs, avec certains freins (mobilité au travail...). Tout dépend si on supprime ces charges du jour au lendemain, ou si elles n'ont jamais existé.  

- Cas d'un salaire inférieur au smic: le smic provoquant un effet de seuil, on aura des cas ou le salaire net ne changera pas, des cas où seule une partie des charges seront reversées, des cas où le patron embauchera un deuxième salarié, des cas où il gardera tout pour lui, des cas où il dépensera tout ou partie de la somme en investissements.

That's the standard argument from your government textbook but it's not really correct. Actually it's bad history. For example the current judical regime - clearly oppressive towards minorities - is mostly the result of federal policies.  The development into police state, permanent war society and an astounding transfer of wealth towards the rich is also only accelearated thanks to federal regulations.  I don't think that allowing black people to vote, get welfare and be pushed for government jobs through affirmative action cancels out Guantanamo, extra-judical killings and TARP/Bailouts etc.

You're forgetting that those repressive measures weren't natural to just the states. Before the WW2 the federal government was strongly segregationist. States nowadays have varies demographics so some of them are more liberal while others - not so much. What you refer to were southern states where it was part of a political and social tradition and when *those states* held primacy in the federal government those rules were imposed on the whole country.

What you refer to is a single political issue which has more to do with who was at what level of power *at the time* - not how state and federal levels of government operate in general.

It is a protected beach so there is no building on the beach (much unlike Sanxenxo). It's a much better beach experience!!!

I also recommend taking a ferry for a day to Las Islas Cies (about 40 minutes) for some of the most beautiful beaches you'll find anywhere. It is also protected and there are no vehicles (as far as I know) on the islands. There are some good hikes and great beaches. I spent about 7 hours there and brought along lunch, some snacks, and water with me so it was a very cheap excursion. It really shouldn't be missed!

Vigo is ok, I think it's sort of boring (just another big city) but it's a good jumping off point for Cies. On your way from the beach towns to Santiago, I recommend stopping in Pontevedra for lunch, it's such a nice town with great, cheap food and wine (that is where I lived so I am biased). It has some really nice plazas and has much more charm than Vigo (in my opinion). In PTV there are a bunch of cool little bars in the old part of town - walk down any of the streets past the Peregrina and you will have your pick! The Peregrina is also a nice place to visit, it's a really unique looking church in the middle of town.

If you go to Coruna, be sure to go up to the Torre de Hercules - the view from the top is seriously cool, definitely worth admission. I thought it would be lame and touristy but I ended up loving it. La Plaza de Maria Pita is also a really beautiful place.

I wish I could remember the hostel I stayed in in Santiago. It was in the center of town and it costed 10 euro/night. I assume many of them are that way though, check out hostelworld/hostels.com and you'll have a good selection in the center.

===========


Gestern haben wir schon ein paar graue Haare bekommen, als wir versucht haben, den Unterschied zwischen ""unterschiedlich"" und ""verschieden"" zu erklären. Heute geht es weiter mit DING und SACHE ... Bis zum Wochenende sind wir ergraut! 

Die gute Nachricht zuerst: In den meisten Situationen, kann man die beiden Wörter synonym benutzen!

Es gibt aber einige feststehende Wendungen, in denen man sie nicht austauschen kann. Die lernt ihr am besten so, wie sie sind. Wir haben mal versucht, die wichtigsten Wendungen und Ausdrücke für euch zusammenzustellen:

DING
Was ist denn das für ein Ding? = Was ist denn das für ein Gegenstand?
Die Dinger taugen nichts, die haben nur drei Tage gehalten. = Diese Gegenstände haben keine gute Qualität.
Das ist ja ein Ding! = Ich bin total überrascht!
Das ist nicht mein Ding. = Das mag ich nicht/mache ich nicht gerne.
Es geht nicht mit rechten Dingen zu. = Irgendetwas stimmt hier nicht./Irgendetwas ist komisch. 
vor allen Dingen = besonders
Ich bin heute guter Dinge. = Ich bin gut gelaunt und positiv.

SACHE
Das sind meine Sachen! = Diese Gegenstände gehören mir!
Räum deine Sachen weg! = Räum deine Kleider/Bücher/ ... weg!
Das war vielleicht eine unangenehme/schlimme/aufregende/tolle/ ... Sache!
Das ist eine gute Sache. = Das ist eine gute Aktion. 
Das ist nicht deine Sache! = Das geht dich nichts an!
Das ist eine größere Sache. = Das macht mehr Arbeit als erwartet. 
Hmmm, das ist so eine Sache ... = Es ist ein bisschen komplizierter als gedacht. 
Das ist nur eine halbe Sache. = Das wurde nicht fertig gemacht/zu Ende geführt.
Das ist eine Sache von fünf Minuten. = Das dauert nur fünf Minuten. 
(nicht) bei der Sache sein = (nicht) konzentriert oder fokussiert sein
Bleib bitte bei der Sache. = Wechsel bitte nicht zu einem anderen Thema. 
um die Sache herumreden = nicht auf den Punkt kommen; nicht sagen, was man will",0,1408232783,null,0,false,0,cjs9q2e,t3_2dqhaz,t1_cjs9q2e,t3_2dqhaz,null,1435274158,3,false,GermanPractice,t5_2t7fs,3

The problem is though, your 'educated people should be the ones with the voting power' point is just as overly idealistic as the whole 'perfect democracy' spiel. 

If you give all the power to a certain person or group of people, they sure as hell won't use it to seek the opinions of professors, as you put it. They'll just reap the benefits while doing the bare minimum to make people think they're doing something right. And that's if you're lucky - the alternative is that they go full authoritarian on you and simply kill anyone who dares to oppose them.

*Ideally*, a benevolent dictatorship would be the best form of government. The head of state would surround himself with educated people and scholars, and make the decisions that would benefit the country and its people the most effectively.

Unfortunately, we do not live an ideal world, and this would not happen. A democracy may not be perfect either, but it's certainly much more, er, reliable than a dictatorship. We've gotten enough practice with it that we're much better off trying to improve and supplement our current forms of government rather than trying to implement something that human nature simply won't allow to exist.

true,damnedi,null,null,"En tant que 'petit' patron, depuis plus de 10 ans, ayant des employés, je peux te dire que cela ferait monter les salaires net.

Je vais m'expliquer.
Tout d'abord, en France, on aime niveller vers le **bas**. (l'état aime ça hein).

Je m'explique :

En gros pour un employé non cadre payé au dessus de 1.5 fois le SMIC, le coût chargé (à ce jour) est d'environ 78% supplémentaire du salaire net pour les charges patronales + salariales, et 82% pour un cadre, hors Mutuelle.

Donc pour faire simple, si je veux payer quelqu'un 2500 Euros Net, il me coutera 2500 x 1,78 en non cadre, et 2500 x 1,82 en cadre.

En chiffre ca donne (cout entreprise)
non cadre = 4450 Euros / Mois 
cadre = 4550 Euros / Mois

Les chiffres ci-dessus sont ce que paye tous les mois l'entreprise pour chacun des employés, et c'est autant de MARGE (pognon, brouzouf, dollars) à générer.

Donc déjà pour le non cadre, 1950 Euros de charges pour les differents organismes (URSSAF, Retraite, Prevoyance, etc..), et pour le Cadre 2050€ de charges en plus du salaire.

Ensuite vient la blague de réduction des charges patronales et salariales suivant les niveaux de salaires.
Donc en gros, si tu payes quelqu'un moins de 1.5 fois le SMIC, les cotisations descendent. 

On tombe à 50% supplémentaire par rapport au coût initial du salaire net, dégressif avec l'augmentation du montant.
En gros un smic = 1 128,70 Net à ce jour, coût pour l'entreprise total : 1 128,7 x 1.5 = Environ 1700€ (570€ de charges).

Le pourcentage du montant total des cotisations augmente au fur et à mesure que l'on augmente le salaire, jusqu'à atteindre les taux maximum de charges qui sont ceux que je vous ai dit plus haut.

Pour informations, le maximum est atteint à environ 1.5 SMIC, soit environ 1700€ / Net pour l'employé

Donc, j'en reviens à niveller vers le bas. Que font les entreprises? 

Bah celles qui peuvent et arrive à payer les gens correctement payent, celles qui peuvent arriver à rester dans l'univers des réductions de charges n'ont aucun intérêt à augmenter les salaires rapidement, car elle sortirait des seuils où les cotisations sont réduites, et donc paiera plus de charges, et donc voilà.

Tu rajoutes à cela la complexité du droit social en France, et qu'embaucher quelqu'un en cadre signifie provisionner entre 6 et 10 mois de salaires chargés au minimum (si je reprends mon exemple ci-dessus, cela fait entre 27 000 et 45 000 Euros  à mettre de côté pour gérer un cadre payé à 2500€ / net).

Maintenant, Imaginons on réduit les charges. On dit par exemple que maintenant c'est 1.5 fois pour tout le monde.
Quel serait le réflexe? Le patron en reprendrait une partie, et en redonnerait une partie à l'employé. Cela marcherait pour tous les gens au dessus du 1.5 fois le SMIC.

Suivant mon exemple : 2500 € x 1.5 = 3750€. A comparer avec les 4550€ chargés ci-dessus.
Si c'était moi, j'augmenterai à 2750 direct -&gt; 2750 x 1.5 = 4125€ 

Voilà, désolé pour le message long et chiant à lire, mais j'espère que ca donne des éclaircisemments...

You should ask that from our president. Do you think politicians will tell all their diplomatic discussions out to the public? No. Confidence and trust are needed, so naturally they are not going to tell what they are speaking in private.

And Niinistö only has said that he wants to have an open communication, not that he is there to push for peace.

And the quote you said says this:
&gt;To my understanding the statement of Kremlin refers purely to trade statistics, which show a slight declining trend, purely speaking on numbers. Unlike how it is usually understood, that is not about crumbling relations, Niinistö said.

But there's more to invasions, annexations and lies than Hitler and the Nazi bunch. Comparing everyone you don't like to Hitler just dumbs down the subject and let's the enemy get away with poor criticism.

As for state propaganda, it can be perfectly achieved with private media. The most glaring example of this is the USA. The bipartisan status quo in the USA is only reinforced by the equally bipartisan private media there. The media validates the status quo by making it look like to regular Joe that the political spectrum in the USA is healthy and diversified and boasting with political conflict and divergence. But the truth is that the political spectrum in the USA is just as singular and oligarchic as Russia's. The difference is that in Russia propaganda is more obvious and less sophisticated. In the USA, there are lobbyists and political campaign private funding, etc. It's all done under the veil of honesty and dignity with the motto ""money talks, that's the American way"".

And western media is an international network owned by very few companies (relatively to their population reach) who have ties to all western governments and media. This allows western media to push in some general directions at all times throughout these many countries. Western governments and media know that propaganda is much more efficient when freedom is only squeezed, not choked (thus having friends in private media and avoiding killing journalists, instead of making it all state controlled and killing off those who fight against it). In fact, fascists knew this too and even left some famous quotes on the subject. They just didn't have the power to put it in practice like the West can.

As for dead journalists, the USA has its fair share of fugitives currently escaping certain death (or unlawful incarceration for life) and has had its fair share of governments killing journalists who spoke too much in the past.

Am I going to call the USA Hitler or nazis for this? No. They're not the same. Nazis could only wish they had the level of sophistication of western propaganda.

This turned out much longer than I expected, so there's a TL;DR at the end.

&gt; But that isn't from a concerted effort of government programming. Governments aren't able to pull it off because they lack control. 

This is only apparently so if you look at it in comparison to absolute state-control governments. What western governments have achieved is far more nuanced. The main and common aspects of western culture make most people biased towards the type of government control practiced by western governments. Capitalism along with consumerism is both a cultural phenomenon and a political tool. Most people in the west practice the ideals of consumerism and capitalism every day which enables the success of the status quo - directly, via wealth; and indirectly, via most people protecting the status quo in order to protect their freedoms (which are related to consumerism and capitalism) and vice-versa.

Western governments have developed this balance between big money and popular freedom that benefits them and allows them to remain in power, along with their their personal objectives and personal (and perhaps even patriotic) ideals.

Russia is a much more monolithic oligarchy, so this balance doesn't exist and isn't even something the powerful people there seek out. They believe they don't need it to stay in power. Of course, the West knows better. It only got to this balance by trial and error. That's why even today abuses of freedom are practiced/experimented with in the West, while other freedoms are expanded. And others even are reversed. This dynamic struggle of certain powers is the definition of western ideals/notions of freedom and democracy. Meanwhile the real struggle (which is to stop the remaining western oligarchy from hogging to power indefinitely) remains untouched, just like in Russia.

The Russian oligarchy will be forced to change if they want to remain in power, like western oligarchies have changed in the past. Western oligarchies realized that they should lead the political powers, not be lead by them. And now they fund leaders of the people, they lobby them, they own the media for them, etc.

As of now, the Russian oligarchy is still ruled by politics, because Putin is one of the biggest oligarchs. This is a totally different approach to power than that of the west. It's as if Rockefeller had been POTUS instead of heavily funding both candidates in every election during his lifetime and getting the same access to power without having to show his face (as much) and without all the other restrictions to an oligarch's powers that come with being an elected figure in a society with mostly fair elections. Putin thinks he's Russia the people and Russia the economy, like a dictator. What the state owns, he owns. If he were an oligarch in the backstage, his private companies would own everything the same way the Russian state does.

And these guys in the backstage exist in the west, for lack of Putin-like figures. Companies with multibillionaire businesses throughout the world that have ties to every western government just the same. 

Since you speak of Fox News, I can name one oligarch to stick to the subject: Rupert Murdoch. It's only logical thatt  Fox News pushes political progaganda (while MSNBC pushes the other half) because it's owned by an oligarch with ties to the media of most western countries, thus effectively owning an international network of propaganda across the western world that serves his pockets and serves the western governments.

TL; DR- Fox News pushes propaganda because it's owned by an oligarch who owns media across the western world, which pushes propaganda all the same everywhere. Western governments need these oligarchs to survive and these oligarchs get more power and money, and less accountability with the people, by doing things this way. Putin, on the other hand, is an oligarch himself, and he has a different approach to power, more like a dictator and less like a true capitalist.

&gt;I don't want to comment on how I feel about Chinese tourists, because I have no idea how to phrase my disgust without coming across as incredibly racist.

The reverse is also true over there, just so you know. Americans and Chinese have one big thing in common: deplorable reputations as tourists. I think many people from our (rather large) countries do absolutely zero research on the local culture before they travel.

I don't disagree with that last point about Hong Kong. It's hard convincing people I talk to that they can't conceptualize having freedoms and then losing them. The very thought of the government blocking our porn is enraging to us. 

In truth though, Hong Kong has never really had a lot of electoral freedom. Their freedom is mostly on the censorship side. I think, in time, China will actually become more like Hong Kong than the other way around. They might not have elections, but I think censorship will become more and more lax judging by some of the recent movies released in China.

In the end, I think the people should have a government that represents them. If they don't care about democracy and they prefer the stability of the CCP I think that's their issue. I don't think it's an imperative to encourage them in either direction.

I'm worried about the US-Russian relationship... though we've definitely been through hotter situations with them and came out just fine :)

Oligarchs buy the campaigns of multiple candidates that are bound to win (the same oligarch buys multiple opponents' campaigns), and they shut down the other candidates from any chance they might have. So they need people to vote for their bought candidates? Easy. They make it seem as if voting for another candidate will put their consumerist freedoms in jeopardy. The same freedoms that fill the oligarchs' pockets with money, btw. People won't risk that because, like I said above, consumerism is ingrained in western culture (I don't say global culture here because I don't want to include the millions of people living in abject poverty and isolation from the western world in Africa and Asia mainly). Consumerism is all most people know about society.

This is how elections work in the western world, even if not all countries are as blatant about it as the USA. I'd say it's even worse in European countries where private funding of campaigns is illegal, but somehow governments always make friends with oligarchs and politicians always end up working for the oligarchs once they leave the government they were in.

In Russia, none of this happens because the State (meaning: Putin )has virtually all the money and power, save for a few oligarchs who work for Putin (not the other way around, as is the case in the West).

You bring up a very good point about why things are like this in Russia. It's in the majority's culture there to glorify the sort of absolutist and paternalist leader like Putin. Like you said, politics in Russia have been like this since forever. The purported ideologies change, but this stays the same. It's always an absolutist paternalist dictator that's ruling Russia. It must click with their culture, like consumerism clicks in the western world.

As for the EU, it's only weak in its relations with other countries (like Russia, or the USA) because it's collectively traumatized by war, especially its most powerful country members who do all the business while the others nod in agreement (you know, the provinces).",0,1408256168,null,0,false,0,cjsif8q,t3_2dprra,t1_cjsif8q,t1_cjsh62j,null,1435278892,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

In recession most of the people vote for fuckers. They always want to beleive in easy solutions. Populists or demagogues gaining ground in Europe and they easily destroy the democracy itself.

An example from Hungary: we had a very good, balanced constitution. It was totally changed in 1989, but the legislators back than didn't changed its dating, so it remained a law passed in 1949. With additional laws and with the precedents of the Constitutional Court it became a well balanced, democratic constitution, which saved us from our politicans several times. Then came the landslide victory of the political right in 2010 and they destroyed this ""communist constitution"". They made a new constitution which is totally unbalanced and gave their protegees life-long offices. (One example: You can elect a new Chief Prosecutor only by two-thirds majority, and if the parliament can't elect a new, the old one remains in office for a full term.) They even change this new constitution when it is necessary, four or five times in the last 3 years.

Bullshit. Take ANY report from Russian media, only Svoboda and Right sector guys are called neo-Nazis (because, well, that's what they are). Pro-Russian separatists, on the other hand, tend to call all the armed forces that oppose them 'nazi' or 'fascist' - but that's *their* opinion and *their* words.

Letzlich sind alle Teil des Problems. Ich finde die Dokumentation gar nicht so schlecht, auch wenn es eine klare Agenda gibt. Mächtige globale Konzerne die u.a. lokale Gesetzgebung beinflussen können und dabei ganz andere Möglichkeiten haben (Geld, Anwälte, Wissen). Ich denke, dass kommt im Artikel gut rüber. 

Ein anderer Aspekt ist, dass z.B. ein Gesetz das 1890 sinnvoll war heute eben ausgenutzt werden kann. Hier wäre die Regierung gefragt eine Novellierung einzubringen. Wie tief - nicht nur in den USA - Konzerne im Gesetzgebungsprozess drin hängen und sinnvolle Änderungen verhindern sollte man schon diskutieren und beachten.

&gt; Ja, das Dorf neben der Wasserfabrik hat kein fließend Wasser und keine sanitären Einrichtungen. Schlimm, aber was hat das mit Nestle zu tun? 

Der Grundwasserspiegel sinkt, weil sehr viel Wasser entnommen wird - dadurch sind die ehemals funktionstüchtigen Brunnen unbenutzbar geworden. Privatisierte Wasserwirtschaft ist Weltbank Auflage... 

http://www.resistinc.org/newsletters/articles/corporations-tap-public-water 

http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/4/water-managementprivatizationworldbankgroupifc.html

&gt; Ist Nestle für die öffentliche Wasserversorgung zuständig? Wäre mir neu.

Nein, aber niemand würde das teure Wasser kaufen, wenn es eine funktionierende Infrastruktur für Wasser gibt. Daran ist sicherlich nicht allein Nestle schuld aber sie profitieren vom Vakuum und internationaler Wirtschaftspolitik, die Entwicklungsländern nicht umbedingt hilft. 

&gt; Schuld haben hier einzig und allein die Politiker, die das Land verkaufen, sich das Geld einstecken und nichts für die Einwohner tun.

So einfach ist es nicht. Nestle als explizit einzig schuldigen auszumachen ist verkürzt.. D'accord. Die Misere der Entwicklungsländer hat aber auch sehr viel mit der Weltbank, dem IWF und Interessen westlicher Konzerne und Regierungen zu tun. 

Wo hier die Grenze verläuft und wer für was verantwortlich ist lässt sich einfach nicht klar beantworten. 

Erpressung über Kredite, Korruption, ernsthafte Probleme... Nestle von jeder Schuld frei zu sprechen ist genauso wahnsinnig wie den Konzern für alles verantwortlich zu machen...

There is also the economic aspect. A country may have small population or weak military and still have large economy or industry with heavy presence abroad. It's far more useful tool in a negotiating table anyway.

Second, why should EU foreign policy be about military presence at all? That's the sort of talk that makes me question common military. Your talk makes me more vary of this idea, not less. It's what I meant in my original  text.

Man stelle sich vor, ein Leser will mehr über den Vietnam-Krieg lernen.

Zwei Beispiele zu dem, was der ""Tot im Reisfeld"" hierzu bietet, aus dem Gedächtnis zitiert:

- Skizzen aus einem Saigoner Nachtclub, wo Scholl-Latour sich mit einer thailändischen Sängerin unterhält 

- dabei feststellt, daß die US-Beteiligung am Krieg Bangoks lang bestehende Bordelle im Rotlicht-Viertel in eine Millionenindustrie verwandelt haben 

- den Glauben ausdrückt, die Thais seien militärisch so unfähig, daß eine eventuelle Invasion der Nordvietnamesen erst durch die Autostaus in Bangkok aufgehalten würde
 
Belege irgendwelcher Art für all diese Aussagen liefert er keine.

Zweites Beispiel:

- Scholl-Latour beobachtet eine militärische Parade aller an der Seite Südvietnams kämpfenden ausländischen Truppen. 

- Er drückt dabei Bewunderung für die koreanischen Truppen aus, in deren Einsatzgebiet ""sich der Vietcong kaum aus seinen Löchern"" traue, weil die Koreaner ihre Gefangenen ""mit der nackten Karate-Hand töten"".

Hintergrund: die in Vietnam eingesetzten koreanischen Truppen, darunter Elite-Einheiten wie die Hauptstadt-Divison, haben zahlreich Kriegsverbrechen begangen, insbesondere Massaker an Zivilisten (wie übrigens alle Parteien in diesem Konflikt).

Hier ist eine Liste:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_South_Korea_during_the_Vietnam_War

Pieno di gente sbronza ma non pericolosa (si trovano un sacco di bottiglie rotte in giro per strada - bevono birra SEMPRE). 

I prezzi per mangiare variano ma sono bassi, in generale puoi spendere molto molto poco per un pranzo normale in un posto pulito.

Ci sono molti parchi, sono grandi e bellissimi - c'è un pure un ex aeroporto convertito a parco, per me una cosa stupenda. 

Musei gratis qualcosa ma non ricordo bene.

Traffico non ti saprei dire, ci sono arterie enormi e moltissima gente gira con i mezzi pubblici e in bici (io ero in vacanza e giravo 8 ore al giorno in bici per la città - non sai la soddisfazione di vedere le auto fermarsi in rotatoria per farti svoltare... se sei in bici ti trattano come un veicolo qualsiasi con tutti i diritti!)

Nell'era dei droni e del totale squilibrio degli armamenti il terrorismo, purtroppo, è la sola arma violenta rimasta a chi si ribella. E' triste ma è una realtà. Se a bombardare il mio villaggio è un aereo telecomandato a distanza io ho una sola strada per difendermi a parte le tecniche nonviolente che sono le migliori: caricarmi di esplosivo e farmi saltare in aria in una metropolitana. Non sto ne giustificando né approvando, lungi da me. Sto provando a capire. Per la sua natura di soggetto che risponde ad un'azione violenta subita il terrorista non lo sconfiggi mandando più droni, ma elevandolo ad interlocutore. Compito difficile ma necessario, altrimenti non si farà altro che far crescere il fenomeno.
7) Occorre legare indissolubilmente il terrorismo all'ingiustizia sociale.

Seine Haine, den Fall ihres Geliebtesten; 

Öfters tönet der Jungfrau

There is still a Flemish populace large than the city of Bruges in there (130.000), Flanders has every right to still have involvement in Brussels. 

Let's face it, a lot of those ""francophone"" are unemployed people of foreign descent and live in pretty much ghetto's. Remove them from the equation and the percentage of Dutch speakers increases massively. And apparently Dutch is more and more being learned in schools because people see the advantage it gives.

&gt;I am also in favor of the creation of a territorial link between Brussels and Wallonia

Really? You're one of those guys? Whatever the case, the borders will not change for a long time. In the same way we can't decide for Brussels, you can't decide for those parts of Flanders. Yes there are francophones living there. But either because of the language facilities (which should be removed) or because of white flight from Brussels. A problem which is the responsibility of Brussels and we're not going to reward you with new territory for it.

I'm French so I feel the same way regarding this issue, I would hate it if people dropped by unexpected and unannounced. Usually my friends don't even come in if I didn't invite them but if they do, they warn me days in advance they're going to drop by (unless it's just for coffee or a quick visit).

* L'une est la lutte de chaque instant contre l'emploi de tout mot anglais ou du franglais. Je ne soutiens pas cette manière car elle sacralise le français et les langues étant vivantes, c'est comme empailler un animal : ça a beau être bien conservé, ça reste un animal crevé.

* L'autre, c'est de garder le français attractif en faisant usage de sa beauté. Edmond Rostand avec Cyrano de Bergerac, c'est superbe écrit en français. San antonio, c'est la culture de l'argot. Alain Damasio, c'est le talent de créer de nouveaux mots et de démontrer que se couper de l'intégration de mots anglais, c'est s'appauvrir. 

Quand on le langage a un caractère esthétique, oui, il est dommage d'y intégrer des mots d'anglais plutôt que d'explorer la richesse de notre lexique. Mais quand il s'agit de communiquer au sens le plus prosaïque, qu'on le fasse en français, en anglais, en verlan ou en tibétain, peu m'importe.

Bref, autant je ne soutiens pas l'usage d'anglais par paresse ou pauvreté lexicale, autant je ne supporte pas non plus les gardiens du temples qui se sentent investis d'un devoir de protéger la francophonie à tout prix.

J'aime ma langue mais elle doit survivre par ses qualités propres, pas par l'interdit d'en utiliser une autre.

Enfin, petit rappel : en 1863, un quart des français ne parlaient pas français et en 1794, on ne parlait français que dans 15 départements sur 83 (chut, ne le dites pas aux identitaires, ça risquerait de les faire réfléchir).

While the EU may have beneficied some countries greatly, there are others that have resulted greatly impoverished (I live in Italy, and I testify that our prices doubled with the introduction of the Euro and that the Austerity measures just worsened the crisis, since they were the opposite of what our economy needed) and they found -still do- most of their tries to change the situation blocked by a three monkeys union who can't seem to understand that what measures worked for Germany may not necessarily work for different economies.

There's also the little fact that when the USA formed, the first thing they did was put together their debt. This has been tried in the UE but vetoed more than once by Germany and supported by other northern countries.

And yes, there are quite a few badly looking types (diseases, handicapped) - but it's more likely that the begging mafia deliberately sought them out because they make more money.

true,Thetonn,ENGL,England,"That we drink tea, can't cook, that we irrationally hate the EU and that hark back to the days of empire

First is right  second is just wrong, and the latter is a matter of some question.

Tea is magnificent and I judge a nations level of development and civilisation by the quality of its tea. I like that perception as it means foreigners will be aware that they should give me tea when I visit them.

The second annoys me and I find it confusing considering how many food programs are on TV/how many great restaurants there are, but it causes me little actual distress. I love the amount of diversity for British food, the downside being that we have a lot of cheap, crap food. I understand other countries have much better cheap food, but when I get drunk and am stumbling home I don't exactly want the best quality.

The third is the most problematic. The majority of British people are Eurosceptic, but I don't think that means what people think it means. Basically, we don't trust the EU. We assume it to be an institution which is beholden to special interests, is increasingly expanding its power in a manner which is counter to our own interests and which we have little meaningful impact upon. We are told the choice is between leaving the EU and no longer having access to the market or remaining in and feebly adopting the old lie that if we keep electing pro-EU politicians and giving them massive amounts of money they might eventually reform in a way that we like. The result is a public annoyed but largely disenfranchised for whom a populist break from the status quo is nice. I dislike the characterisation less because it is inaccurate and more for the smug sense of superiority one tends to receive from people who assume all anti-EU people are knuckle-dragging morons rather than people with legitimate concerns who are being failed by the status quo and riled up by politicians seeking to acquire political capital while doing nothing about it.

The fourth is the most fun. The majority of English people don't want to restart the empire, but the idea of holding power and influence in the world, acting as a moral agent to try and do the right thing is an appealing one. I like the idea of being a force for good in the world when others would not act, although if our role were to be replaced by more regional actors doing what we perceive as 'the right thing' then I think most of us would be greatful. Oh, and it is quite fun to annoy Argentines and Spaniards every now and again.

true,SK2P1,EURO,Brussels City Gangster,"&gt;And Walloon politicians are better?!

Nop, neither are politicians from Brussels but that's not the point.

&gt;Brussels became largely French because of the elitist Francophones who used to rule Belgium, nothing to be proud of

Also becaue of massive influx of poor walloons workers. The population adopted the language of the elite. That's an historical process that take place everywhere in the world. Nothing to be proud maybe but nothing to be ashamed.

&gt;There is still a Flemish populace large than the city of Bruges in there (130.000)

Those people are Brusseleirs, there are also Frenchspeaking flemings (albeit less and less). What's your point.

&gt;Flanders has every right to still have involvement in Brussels.

Nop. Nor Wallonia for that matter.

&gt;Let's face it, a lot of those ""francophone"" are unemployed people of foreign descent and live in pretty much ghetto's

Yay way to generalize. First ""foreign"" community are french people (the rich kind), fucking immigrants.

&gt;Remove them from the equation and the percentage of Dutch speakers increases massively.

Are you suggesting to deport them? Anyway of course the percentage increase that's mathematical. There are also incentive for Fleming to go live in Brussels to derail the frenchification. But apparently they are afraid to do so, walking less than 1km in Molenbeek is a near-death experience.

&gt;And apparently Dutch is more and more being learned in schools because people see the advantage it gives.

Yes because if a split happen, social redistribution would be higher and tax would be lower in Flanders. That tells you a lot about the attractivity of the language.

&gt;Whatever the case, the borders will not change for a long time.

You mean the complete subjective linguistic border fixed thanks to a language census from 1932 ?

&gt;  In the same way we can't decide for Brussels, you can't decide for those parts of Flanders.

I agree let's the people living there decide for their faith. Wait isn't those people that elected their council representative who are not recognized by a flemish governor / minister? Denial of democracy.

&gt; Yes there are francophones living there. But either because of the language facilities (which should be removed) 

I agree, let's remove the language facilities and make another language census. Everything with mixed linguistic population becomes de facto bilingual and attached to Brussels, where a language clearly dominate it becomes part of the corresponding regions. Yes?

&gt; or because of white flight from Brussels.

Really? You're one of those guys?

&gt; we're not going to reward you with new territory for it.

Patronising statement, nice way to conclude this comment. We don't need your rewards.

The perception:  Drunk and fun despite being penniless and out of the fringes of society [Europe] while Angela Merkel and her Euro-b(w)anker buddies screw us over with the assistance of the gobshites we voted in power.

The truth?  OK, we like a pint, but the party days are in the past.  Gone are the days of street parties 5/6/7 nights a week all over town as buskers play to people dancing as swinging off lampposts and climbing fountains.  Partly this is due to lack of employment/disposable income and partly due to all the youth - particularly the educated youth - leaving in droves.  There are few reasons for youths with education and no financial ties to stay if they aren't lucky enough to have one of those rare good jobs.  This is despite the fact this was the first generation of Irish kids to  supposedly never have to leave to find work overseas -  the generation which is now #GenerationEmigration.  This will have long-lasting consequences for the country as so many of those who left will never return (to live).

As for the constantly being f**ked over?

*Politics*

* In a rather slow week, one notable hot topic was the mini-scandal about leaked internal discussions of Gamma International's helpdesk, supplier of FinFisher, a global spyware that is in fact used by spies, and our national spy agency. Our spies are fucking retarded and don't know how to set up even the most basic things (i.e. software install failed because the lack of e-signature) and finish the e-mails with their actual names and positions. 

* [Jobbik sensed an angle and immediately demanded compensation](http://www.politics.hu/20140811/jobbik-wants-govt-to-ask-compensation-from-brussels-after-russia-embargo/) from Brussels for the losses of Hungarian farmers because of the Russia embargo. The thing affects 1% of Hungary's agricultural exports. But that didn't stop the farm ministry's state secretary to use scary populist words at a farmers' expo, stating ""The country is losing 70m Fts daily because of this! Help protect the farmers by buying national produce!"". 70m Fts is slightly more than 200k€...

* [Also some refugee-hate from them](http://www.politics.hu/20140813/jobbik-urges-stricter-refugee-policies/): because of the Dublin II regulations, we received 9 times as many refugees in 2013 than in 2012. But this is a mere legality, we are still only a transit country for almost all of them. 

* It seems more and more sure that the governments real goal is to drive out all players from the utility services market and [set up a non-profit utility scheme](http://www.politics.hu/20140815/govt-working-team-to-prepare-non-profit-public-utilities-holding/). 

---
*Economy*

* The [GDP growth was 3.9%](http://www.politics.hu/20140814/hungary-economy-grows-3-9-beating-expectations/) in Q2, the [highest in all of EU](http://www.politics.hu/20140815/3-9-gdp-growth-is-highest-in-eu/). 

* [An Austrian waste management company is leaving Hungary](http://www.politics.hu/20140812/austrian-waste-managing-company-driven-out-by-black-market/), because ""it is very difficult to make money here legally"" according to the CEO. He added that at the competitors, roughly 70-80% of the workers are unregistered. Welcome to Hungary. 

* As it turns out, the [government overpaid 600b Fts \(2b€\)](http://www.politics.hu/20140814/hungary-may-have-paid-huf-600-billion-too-much-for-e-on-operations/) for purchasing E.ON, the German electric company's domestic operations.

The nearest hypermarket to me (which is also the nearest to Sziget) had nearly empty shelves at the spirits section when I went on just Day 1.

* [Orbán opened a new football stadium](http://www.politics.hu/20140811/orban-opens-new-ftc-stadium/) in Budapest last Sunday. While in reality during his speech he was booed, the videos uploaded to his official FB cut to a cheering crowd right after showing him finish the talk. Lol. Ferencváros was beaten by Chelsea 1-2 because Hungarian football sucks.

Corridoi deserti, discussioni e collaborazioni praticamente assenti, un seminario a settimana (se ti dice bene), a cui partecipano praticamente solo dottorandi, e basta.

Alla fine la questione è un po' ""viene prima l'uovo o la gallina"": è un ambiente di ricerca stimolante che porta a risultati di qualità o è ricerca di qualità che porta ad un ambiente stimolante? Non lo so, ma sicuramente una normativa che spinge professori e ricercatori a rinchiudersi nelle proprie stanze (o a non presentarsi affatto all'università) per evitare distrazioni e cercare di pubblicare a tutti i costi, sicuramente non aiuta.

true,MrMysterious95,EURO,Proud European,"I really have this weird polarized problem when the westerners praise Poland - and they're quite blatantly wrong.

Poland is a success story of Eastern Europe - but it is simply enough to go to Poland and look around: unemployment is limited only thanks to imigration, national debt is skyrocketing and our government is corrupt. While new highways are being built, small towns are getting empty.

Poland has a lot of experts - but they're working as plumbers or way below their qualifications, the universities are underfunded and their curricula outdated.

Poles are hard workers - but most westerners wouldn't accept a Pole as a manager or editor, we're still good only to be maids or plumbers. The average wage did rose, but an average Pole still earns less in the West than the westerner, not to mention Poles in Poland.

Poland produces great games - one somewhat good game, based on a book series no one reads in the West, no one is interested in Polish movies, music or literature, and Poles themselves don't read books anymore. There's very little innovative businesses (about the only new polish product I heard about was an electronic board game die), no major scientific development.

Reddit in general has a boner for that fucking goddamned soldier bear no one really cares about in Poland (just... shut up about it, Jesus), and the winged hussars - while forgetting the real heroes like the Accursed Soldiers or Solidarity movement.

I am in no way saying Croatians or Bosniaks were saints in the conflict. But to say that Serbs did not help speed up the break up of Yugoslavia is just stupid.

""Gegner des Schächtens kritisieren, dass die Bewusstlosigkeit des Tieres nicht sofort eintritt, da die Blutversorgung des Gehirns auch durch nicht durchtrennte Gefäße im Bereich der Wirbelsäule und des tiefen Nackens erfolgt, und verweisen auf manche Video-Aufnahmen geschächteter Tiere, die einen teilweise mehrminütigen Todeskampf durchleben, obwohl sichtbar die Luftröhre und Halsschlagadern durchtrennt wurden. Eine sofortige Bewusstlosigkeit sei daher beim Schächten nicht automatisch gegeben, was darauf zurückzuführen sei, dass der Ausblutungsprozess eine gewisse Zeit benötigt. Auch sei ein Beharren auf das Schächten ohne vorherige Betäubung mit dem Hinweis auf das erforderliche Ausbluten nicht überzeugend, da ein betäubtes Tier in gleicher Weise ausblutet wie ein nicht betäubtes. Außerdem würden auch beim besten Ausbluten immer noch Blutrückstände im Fleisch bleiben, so dass dieses Argument angezweifelt werden kann.""

true,crnaruka,SRPS,Republika Srpska,"To be honest, I think few Serbs would deny that Serbian nationalism was one of the key reasons that Yugoslavia fell apart. The biggest frustration many Serbs have is how this factor is often portrayed as virtually the exclusive reason for the Yugoslav Wars while downplaying the real concerns ethnic Serbs had in this period and the fact that Serbs were also victims of the wars. 

For instance, Serbs calling Croatian politicians Ustaše is often portrayed as irresponsible, provocative, and inaccurate nationalistic Serb rhetoric. However, while I agree that some Serb propagandists used this issue in a demagogic fashion, that does not mean that there were not many people who had legitimate concerns about the rise of Croatian nationalism. After all, consider the fact that there were hundreds of thousands of Serbs for whom the atrocities perpetrated by the Ustaše were not something they read in a textbook, but an ordeal that was in their living memory, and many, especially those living in Croatia and Bosnia, personally had friends and families who were among the hundreds of thousands Serbs murdered by the fascist regime. Whatever else you may think of Serbs, I don't think it's hard to understand the terror that these individuals had when what in their minds was the Ustaše flag was being hoisted by Croat politicians who were once again engaging in nationalist rhetoric. 

Similarly in Bosnia, it's easy to blame the Serbs for starting the war by seceding from the new state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, from the Serb point of view, the issue was not whether to leave Bosnia or not, but rather whether to accept being once again separated from the rest of Serbia or not. It's not much of an exaggeration to say that for over a century most Bosnian Serbs wanted to be part of Serbia, and in fact during most of that period ethnic Serbs were the majority in Bosnia. This feeling of wanting to be part of Serbia only crystallized after being faced with horrific violence both during [World War One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzkorps) and [World War II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_persecution_of_Serbs) just on the basis that they were Serbs, which also reduced their population significantly. Faced with the choice of now becoming a minority in a Bosniak dominated country or attempting to remain part of Serbia, it's not that surprising that virtually all chose the latter.

While we bear no responsability for what happened against Marseille, the LFP loves to hit us hard. Showing that we are willing to take measures against people behaving badly could help with reconstructing our damaged relationship with the LFP.

2: There are better options available
The board probably already has a few attackers they'd like to sign and might even have found options better than Brandao that would work better for our attack. It has to be said we haven't had the strongest attack so far and Brandao didn't seem to be what was needed.

Even with an 8 match suspension it's hard to hold on to Brandao simply because we can't afford to lose the top attacker for that long.

This is annoys me with americans mainly but also brits (like you) who perpetuate this wacky stereotype that 'Tea' is some victorian throwback. We drink a lot of it but thats because it takes 5 minutes to brew up, hot water, tea bag (literally any brand), milk, sometimes sugar and a clean cup. No sophistication, no pinkies out, no china saucers or tiny fucnking sandwiches, most of all, no over thinking it.

 We drink tea like americans drink coffee. Sure some people go to speciality shops and buy fancy brews, cups, thermometers but for 95% of people its just a hot drink. You have a brew when you wake up, you have a brew when you get to work, you have a brew with your sandwich at lunch, you have a brew when you get home from work, you have a brew while watching tv, etc.

Coming from a much smaller country with just as rich a culture and history it feels as if German culture has always tried to get the rest of Europe to admit that German culture is just right and everyone else is just plain wrong and that we should all strive to be like them. It's that kind of backwards thinking they've tried pulling for centuries, and much like European powers did to the rest of the world, it's backed by a might makes right mentality.

I don't think Germans have changed at all over the last centuries, the German subconscious is just as imperialistic, brutish, antisemetic, and passive aggressive it had always been. Perhaps none of these are flairing up at the moment as it had before in other centuries, but just like herpes it's there.

InB4 Germans are a huge amount of people that are all different. I know, that's how all human beings are like. I'm saying that their historical informal institutions are such that they end up doing these things as a group when they act as a society. I have German ancestors and my grandmother grew up in a little ethnic German village. There are good traits to individuals, but the culture tends toward imperialistic attitudes without any large dose of self awerness, which is just a human problem that any other culture in the world has their own version of really. All cultures in the world have their pluses and minuses, and none is ever inherently better than the other. German culture is just very imperfect in it's ability to suppress beauty in this world, that is, cultural diversity.

- Humorless. Which is half true? I don't know. I know many funny people but there is a shit-ton of people who take themselves too seriously. One of my friends said french people have less humor than germans but I don't want to say this is true or fault.

- ""Schaffe, schaffe, Häusle baue"" (""Working, working, building a house""). Again half true for me. I know of very lazy people (including me) but at the same time they are often very disciplined if it comes to (serious) work. I think it's also pretty common to have the mindset ""When I do it, I have to do it right"".

- Autobahn: Yes, we know we can drive as fast as we want on most Autobahnen. No, that doesn't mean you can drive around with 300 km/h nor that it's okay to be on most left lane with 110 km/h.

-  Humble. I think this is pretty true (which isn't humble to say so I am stuck here in a contradictory eternity). Most germans are rather reserved with their skills, knowledge but also with aims and thoughts. 

- Wars. ""Don't mention the war"" is true - but not because we have a problem talking about it. Most germans roll their eyes because a) you are totally uninformed but think you know it all b) we seem to have to talk about this topic with everyone from abroad when there are much nicer things to talk about. In a 12 or 13 years of school, you come across WWI and WWII at least twice. We know it's horrible. Our constitution was made to prevent anything similar ever again. We don't need to hear from you how our grand-parents or grand-grand-parents were horrible people and how the US is so much better (lols)

- Apparently people abroad like us? I think the last two years of some weird ""Which country do you like most"" showed germany was the most liked one.

But when the Serbs in Croatia started to deport and ethnically cleanse the Kraijna region they crossed the point of no return. claiming it as a historical part of Serbia and wanting it to join Serbia was unexpectable for Croatia. 

As for BIH, partition was a  serious option in the beginning of the conflict. Serbian and Croatian leaders even held meetings about it. But Serbian leadership overplayed it's hand because a majority wanted a unrealistic Greater Serbia or a Serb dominated Yugoslavia minus Slovenia.

Are Serbs as a people to blame? no i do not think so., there political leaders used them to get what they wanted and that is to stay in power by any means. This is also to a lesser degree true for leaders of the other ethnic groups.

Yugoslavia needed to reform, but allot of politicians did not want to reform because it would mean political suicide. So they choose a nationalistic agenda to secure there place. Just look at the post war republics there was no change of leadership, just a change of flags.

true,Bovgvin,RUSS,Russia,"That's a tough one, at least for me. There is a lot of anti-Western propaganda in Russia, unfortunately, and a lot of it is fostered by trolls. But just know that if you take a typical Russian and sit with them and talk sincerely with them, they will most likely become your friend. A lot of the aggression that Russians feel comes from their insecurity - and sometimes we bare our teeth because we feel inadequate. At least this is how I see it. Here is a nice joke that reflects Russian people's relationship with the West:

One Russian married couple goes on vacation to Spain. After a couple of days, the husband notices that his wife disappears from their hotel room after nightfall. He checks her mobile phone and notices that there a lot of outgoing calls for the number marked as ""Juan Carlos."" The next evening he pretends to fall asleep, and follows her as she slips away from the room. He sees that she enters a different hotel room, and uses the keyhole to peek inside. What he sees there deeply enrages him: there is an extremely handsome man lying on the bed - beautifully tanned body, great haircut, etc. At this moment he sees his wife coming out of the bathroom - graying hair, overweight, in a shabby nightie. 
""Jesus,"" the husband thinks, ""She is embarrassing me in front of Juan Carlos!""

So, the anger is there, but sometimes it just comes from the feeling of inadequacy.

* A ""shitty country following the EU like a pet because they aren't worth anything without it"" by the more extreme Eurosceptics. (see Farage vs Verhofstadt)
* Very humble and introverted people, which I think is true to some extent. (leaving aside when the Red Devils are playing)
* Always wanting to make compromises so that everybody is happy, but have big quarrels internally. The latter is true but often exaggerated as it is very often limited to the political sphere.

Points out to the hypocrisy of the arab community ( if you haven't noticed most of the pro-Gaza protests were arab/muslims)  who protested by the thousands for Gaza but somehow only few hundreds usually people who belong to that minority protested now 

Btw on other places yazidis activists were attacked by the Islamists

&gt;Police say the Muslim-Yazidi clash was triggered after six Islamists stormed a restaurant in the eastern Westphalian town of Herford at around 4 pm on August 7. The Muslims were attempting forcibly to remove a poster inviting people to join a demonstration in support of the Yazidis in Iraq.

* Gross tax (directly translated, ""job market contribution"") is 8% of all income with no deductions. Does not apply to income from benefits or from stocks or dividends.
* Bottom tax is 6.83% of personal income above 42,800 per year.
* Top tax is 15% of personal income above 449,100 per year. They're currently gradually raising this to 467,000 per year.
* Municipal tax varies depending on your city, but on average it is 24.90%.
* Healthcare tax is 5% but is currently being gradually merged with the bottom tax.

There's an absolute tax ceiling of 51.7% of all income. You have to make quite a bit of money to hit that, but you don't necessarily have to be super rich - some upper middle class people bump up against the ceiling.

Those people have actually the right to vote in local elections (like every EU citizens). They have recognized local representantives to take care of their interest. It's a matter of people living there having a say in the public decisions concerning themselves.

&gt; Those places were not so long ago Dutch and they can become Dutch again, you can't predict these things.

Those place were also austrian, spanish, burgundians and even french. Maybe you meant dutchspeaking? Then before that they spoke brabantian, and even before they must have spoken some kind of old frankish dialect. Language it's not something fixed it evolves with the people speaking it.

What are the historical borders of Flanders? The County of Flanders,  the duchy of Brabant? Limburg? Borders have always moved according to people living there, not what it's supposed to be.

&gt;Something which is best maintained with as little Walloon influence as possible.

What you don't get it's that it's not Walloon influence, it's Frenchspeaking influence. If Brussels is lost to the dutchosphere like you say, it's completly integrated in the belgian francosphere.

Maybe the dutchspeaking/flemish character of Brussels, but once again the Brusseleir identity is a melting pot of language and culture. I'm not sure a dutchspeaking Brussels-born woud appreciate to be called Dutch or even that he is as Flemish as the people in Antwerp.

Yes corridor. If you want to get rid of the language facility or even gain independence, it's the only thing you have to offer.

&gt;our borders have to be protected from it

What's the threat? French imperialism? Bou-fucking-ouhou, look at your language today, you should rather be afraid of English language imperialism. Also this is not how things work, language is not static and only dialog and openess can make it evolve.

&gt;Those place became French-speaking because the Flemish populace had no self-determination in the past.

Even if that was true (it's not) the solution is to deprive french-speaking of their right, what's the motivation here? revenge?

As the failure of austerity to 'cure' Italy, Greece and Spain proved, each country in Europe has very different economies coming from very different histories for which very different things have to be done. Germany has spent and made up debt until its country was properly infrastructured, advanced and 31% powered by self-renewal energy. Now they can allow themselves to spend less and focus on paying back debt.

Italy doesn't have that security, and cutting back on everything leaves less money circulating, which means the destruction of our businesses. What we'd need is smart people investing in smart things.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Default and devaluation, or just devaluation (really a default. helps because real debts values decrease, wages and liabilities decrease go to competitive level instantly, and the export boom offsets the contraction of austerity. UK would be in a periphery position if they hadn't devalued 30%

No country would have entered the euro if they had know how badly designed it was. there were plenty warning. They went against conventional theory and practice regarding currency zones. The EU even ignored their own McDougall Report '77 that found the a currency zone would require 10% federal spending. 

The should have made changes argument is only through to a certian extent. Even if a country puts through reforms perfectly. It still takes a long time for reform to fully show in the economy: for industry hubs develop, talent graduates working security in the UK, implicit knowledge, organic structures and networks, instead of building up expertise in an industry. Austerity and debt has meant that investment. Debt and austerity. The eurozone countries are still diverging economically, In the peripheries investment has plummeted, they are loosing their talent and lack of skill development of their young. Reforms without some form of stimulus will cause contraction.

As regards banks. German banks were more exposed to the Global financial crisis that US or UK banks!!! [here](http://speri.dept.shef.ac.uk/2013/11/11/dirty-secret-euro-zone-crisis-german-banks/) Their banking system was bankrupt if only for the bailout (throught the back door)! A lot of Germany export boom came from debt fuelled booms in the periphery from euro-core banks. It was partially a bubble through the back door. So North completely good, South completely bad narrative doesn't stand up.

Also the point that was made in the 'more academic' link still stands. only so much gains can be made through competitiveness improvement so cut have to be made. Competitiveness isn't always copyable, particularly existing implicit expertise and structures.Austerity alone kills economies. Without some to offset austerity (restructuring) they cant get their competitiveness back without creating a deflationary spirals. The aggregate demand problem still exists.

Ireland for instance, have made a 30% competitiveness gains since the crisis, and is No1. Forbes best place to do business 2013 and so on. However it would not be preforming strongly if it Britain and the US (65% of our trade) were preforming well, and the euro is at levels close to the historical exchange rate the Irish punt, and pound sterling would be.

Italy debt in 2000 was 126%. It decreased to manageable 100~ during the euro-bubble. High debt is manageable with high growth. The current recession has lost all of Italy's gains since 2000. The have also lost 24% of their manufacturing capacity despite maintaining manufacturing competitiveness. They whole debate about Italy at the moment is about how little they have reformed. I do agree with you that Italy is a relatively good economy, and that's part of my point. IT has a decent economy but this has an overvalued currency. It had still has a 20% competitiveness difference it cannot make up with out crushing the internal economy.  At current levels the of debt. The Italian government need 6.6% primary surplus for 10 years to pay that debt. This is virtually impossible. [paper here](http://trueeconomics.blogspot.ie/2014/08/1082014-can-eu-rely-on-large-primary.html) 

The portgal figures you linked are prejections. Portugal 2014 Q1 was [-0.7](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/15/eurozone-gdp-french-economy-stagnates-germany-growth-live), [Q2 is +0.6](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/15/eurozone-gdp-french-economy-stagnates-germany-growth-live). With their banking difficulties, and -0.7 deflation the rest of the year doesn't look good. 

You were correct Germany grew 0.2%. The outlook in Gremany isn't positive either. industrial orders feel by 3.2% may to June. Particularly worrying is a 10.9% drop of orders from the euro-zone which shows the weakness there. 

Default doesn't destroy itself. It is the result of wealth already being destroyed. Taking on future debt, and incurring future contraction only makes the situation worse. The peripheries cant sustain the 5%-9%GDP primary surpluses required to pay the national debt. Default is only a matter of how and not if. 

Argentina contracted 20%. Greece contracted more, and have the biggest bailout. Their current deflation is 4% that off the cliff. You are correct they cant survive in the union with out a massive economic plan- their currency is 2x the value it should be. The McDougall report (worth looking up) found that their would need to be at least 10% GDP to be spent at the federal level. That review was based on 9 countries which were much closer economically. It would probably have to be much bigger in the current Euro-zone. This would disproportionately fall on Germany. I can't see that being politically feasible in the next 20 years. Greece with have to leave if this doesnt happen


You are right that countries can't slip in and out of the currency-zone. But now that its clear that the euro-zone doesn't work in its current form. The only workable options are spend the money to make it proper Optimal Currency Area with would be maybe 10-20% GDP in Germany's case. Or medium term high inflation, which is unsuitable to Germany. Alternatively the weaker countries could be aided in a controlled exit.

I hope you are right but I can't see where the growth is going to come form as the fundamental structural problems are still as they were. There maybe so QE but I can't see it being either soon enough or big enough to turn thins around",0,1408287110,null,0,false,0,cjspgme,t3_2diohq,t1_cjspgme,t1_cjr3beu,null,1435282781,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

If Annan informed Clinton about a talk with Assad he just returned from, we can date it to right after one of Annan's three Syrian visits and cross reference it with Clinton's [travel schedule](https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/travels/secretary/clinton-hillary-rodham) to get an idea where her plane could have passed.

Annan's first visit to Damascus was March 11th, 2012, no travels by Clinton.

The second visit was on May 28th. Next travel by Clinton was to Denmark three days later.

His third and last visit was on [July 9th](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/09/syria-crisis-kofi-annan-bashar-assad_n_1658220.html), after which he visited Theran on the 10th, so ""returned"" could be the 9th, 10th, 11th or soon after.  
Clinton was in Kabul on the 7th, then on to Tokyo and then Ulaanbaatar until the 9th, then Vietnam/Laos/Cambodia until flying to Cairo for a meeting lasting from 14th-16th.

It seems the third is the most likely, but if they talked *after* Annan's meeting with Assad, then Clinton was in a part of the World where I can't see any terrorism that is relevant for Germany. However, there are two ends to the connection, and Annan's path from Damascus to Theran would have passed through some areas of interest to BND.  
The same could be said about any of the other two visits, though, and from reports that BND intercepted calls referring to the poison gas attacks we know BND had the Oker, one of it's three ""[communication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oste-class_fleet_service_ship)"" ships, off the Syrian cost during those months.",0,1408287361,null,0,false,0,cjspk9i,t3_2dsmos,t1_cjspk9i,t3_2dsmos,null,1435282858,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

&gt; Ma adessè guetta di tweet. La circostanza che la giornalista Eleonora De Nardis abbia accoltellato al termine di una lite il suo compagno, l'avvocato Piero Lorusso, per difendere i suoi figli, come lei stessa ha scritto su Twitter, ""è palesemente falsa, diffamatoria e calunniosa sia per il rapporto idilliaco"" esistente tra Lorusso con la propria figlia, sia con gli altri due bambini della De Nardis ""da cui viene chiamato papà pur non essendolo"". Lo sottolinea il legale romano in una dichiarazione rilasciata.
Nella nota Lorusso spiega che ""il motivo scatenante del deprecabile atto di violenza è da ricercarsi in un raptus imputabile all'insana gelosia e possessività della De Nardis"" nei suoi confronti ""già in precedenza manifestata - spiega - e documentabile mediante referto medico"". A seguito dell'aggressione avvenuta in un appartamento nel centro storico di Ostuni (Brindisi) nella notte tra il 13 e il 14 agosto scorsi, Lorusso spiega di aver riportato ""plurime lesioni personali con lesione del muscolo dell'avambraccio sinistro, delle vene, dell'arteria, nonchè della coscia e ginocchio destri con applicazione di oltre 50 punti di sutura a seguito di intervento chirurgico di urgenza durato oltre due ore e mezza"".
Il merito al Tweet della De Nardis scritto dopo l'arresto (""Ho difeso solo i miei bambini""), l'avv.Lorusso spiega che la stessa dichiarazione non può essere riferita nè a lui nè alla vicenda dell'aggressione e di aver ""conferito mandato ai propri legali di fiducia di procedere nei confronti di quanti ledano il suo buon nome e reputazione professionale di difensore delle donne vittime di violenza in centinaia di processi"".

Sensible interest rates and QE are much, much easier than structural reform.

The ECB deserves to be heavily criticised for not providing the first two, for not winning the argument in Germany that would have allowed it to.

The wisest approach would have been to have an accommodative money environment that helped structural reform and by structural reform I mean reductions in taxation and welfare, reduced regulation particularly of the labour market, a genuine clampdown on corruption and tax evasion and legal reform to allow contracts to be enforced and planning regulations to be observed.

I am not talking about some neoliberal, laissez faire, free for all.

However, there comes a point when the people who exercise the decisive influence on the ECB are entitled to ask,

""Where is the structural reform?""

My understanding is France and Italy have done nothing, Spain some but not enough, Portugal, Cyprus and Greece .... ?

Certainly France, Spain, Portugal, Cyprus and Greece are all in flagrant breach of their European Growth and Stability pact obligations.

So, maybe there comes a time when the bugger thy neighbour policies of austerity start to look less misguided in the face of the lengthy absence of reform from the South.

The map is made using [this awesome tool](http://beno.org.uk/metromapcreator/). You can edit the map yourself by opening [this](http://www.beetxt.com/RtV/) file in the tool.

Most important **changes**:

* Ireland is now included, using a 101 km tunnel from Dublin to Holyhead.

* Existing high speed rail (and high speed rail under development) is now taken into account. France and Germany have therefore changed a lot, and there is a direct London-Brussels link. Also some changes in Scandinavia.

* More accurate bypassing of mountain ranges (Alps/Pyrenees). This resulted in Zurich as the main hub north of the Alps.

* Service in Spain and Portugal is heavily improved.

* Brussels-Cologne now goes via Liege instead of Maastricht.

* On requrest, I've added a highly unrealistic connection between Stockholm en Helsinki.

* Morocco is now connected, and the Istanbul line crosses the Bosporus to connect Ankara as well.

* Baltic line now skips Vilnius in favor of Kaunas, as the planned Rail Baltica proposal makes the same choice. 

* Dropped several cities because they were to small, including Tartu, Portsmouth and Lublin.

* More logical connections in Poland.

* Many more changes, to much to list them all...

**Time:**

Let's say we could operate this on 320 km/hr, with 5 minutes added for every stop. This might be a bit optimistic now, but in the near future not totally naive. Remember, this is city-center to city-center, so that makes competing with airlines easier.

* London-Budapest: ca. 6 hours.

* Paris-Berlin, ca. 3,5 hours.

* Paris-Madrid, ca. 4 hours.

What this means in practise is that you can go visit any ""approved"" doctor (most are), and your insurance will pay for it as well for medication (but on the latter you will have to pay a small amount yourself) [1]. It won't pay for a two week stay in a spa after you've stubbed your toe, even if a doctor would have prescribed it ;)

It won't normally pay for therapies that are not proven to be effective (alternate medicine, for example).

Physio will probably be payed for if it is prescribed. I'm not sure about a massage therapist.


If this sounds too confusing, don't worry. What it means in practise is: if you don't feel well for any reason, you can go visit a doctor (even a specialist, or the ER), and what the doctor deems necessary will be payed for[2]. You don't have to worry about getting bills you can't pay. If you feel sick or injure yourself, you can get help and won't have to pay anything (except maybe a few Euros)

Edit: and of course that includes visits to the dentist. Dental implants are a different matter: they are only reimbursed if you did a yearly/bi-yearly(depends on age IIRC) checkup for the last 3 years.

BTW: There are also private insurance companies that work differently, much like the american equivalent. I'd recommend against it though, you might end up paying less but you might also end up paying much more in case something serious happens and you didn't read their T&amp;C carefully (preexisting conditions and such)

-----

[1]  as long as the medication isn't freely sold across the counter anyway. (For example, if the doctor prescribes you Aspirin, you would have to pay for it yourself)

[2] and from my experience, the doctors will tell you if there is something additional that can be done but isn't covered by insurance

È un fatto che il pezzo ha suscitato scalpore e critiche. Poi che ci siano i youtubers di mezzo o no c'entra relativamente, anche su twitter c'era un trambusto enorme per quel articolo.


Il discorso è la paraculaggine di GQ. Non si commissiona un pezzo per poi scaricare la colpa sull'autore. Su questo siamo d'accordo. 

Ho visto il video di Barbie Xanax, a me sembra in piena regola del diritto di critica, la tipa ha detto come la pensava (a tratti molto moralista) ma non ha ""sbagliato"" ne aizzato la folla. Ha solo detto la sua in modo incazzato, ha preteso delle scuse ecc...


Ripeto, qui il problema è GQ. E non è solo un problema etico ma - se è vero che ha commissionato il pezzo, letto e poi approvato - anche legale.

true,TheMadFleming,FLAN,Flanders,"&gt;Those people have actually the right to vote in local elections (like every EU citizens). They have recognized local representantives to take care of their interest. It's a matter of people living there having a say in the public decisions concerning themselves.

Really you'd be in favor of that? What about the Russian majority regions in the Baltic countries? They got artificially moved there by the soviets and are still regularly used by Russia to stir up trouble. You're just positive towards this because it plays in your advantage.

What about your fellow francophones in Quebec? Stuck in an anglophone majority country, slowly getting anglofied under the guise of bilingualism. Bilingual is fine until people start dropping the weaker language (French in this case). They nearly had their independence, the referendum results had only a small vote difference. Small enough that the English minority could have been the difference. At the moment they probably won't even get Montreal with them if they would become independent. Now they're on their way to become another boring anglophone region.

&gt;Those place were also austrian, spanish, burgundians and even french. Maybe you meant dutchspeaking?

Yes I don't meant the rulers, certainly not the (northern) Dutch rule of 1815-1830. You said it yourself, old Flanders was a lot smaller than modern Flanders. Modern Flanders is essentially the southern Dutch speaking regions. We're Dutch in all but name and I have avoided calling Brussels Flemish because it wasn't really Flemish but Brabantian.

&gt;Then before that they spoke brabantian, and even before they must have spoken some kind of old frankish dialect. 

Old Frankish is the predecessor to Dutch and the Brabantian dialect was part of the Dutch family. Just like the Flemish, Limburg and Holland dialect. Not only that, but Dutch is heavily based on the Brabantian dialect.

&gt;What are the historical borders of Flanders? The County of Flanders, the duchy of Brabant? Limburg? Borders have always moved according to people living there, not what it's supposed to be.

I'm aware of that and it has mainly moved in the favour of francophones. We already ceded enough territory (French Flanders).

&gt;If Brussels is lost to the dutchosphere like you say, it's completly integrated in the belgian francosphere.

It's floating in between, as it should. I'm just not deluding myself that Brussels could become fully Dutch again and frankly I don't care. I just don't want the Flemish economy wrecked, for which not losing Brussels is important.

&gt;like the Zaventem airport.

Hah about that, you're bloody airport is even on Flemish soil. You really think Flemish politicians are going to let you take half of Flemish Brabant with you?

&gt;I'm not sure a dutchspeaking Brussels-born woud appreciate to be called Dutch or even that he is as Flemish as the people in Antwerp.

Most Flemings, Belgicist or Flamingant alike won't be liked to be called Dutch because it is associated with the Netherlands, mainly with Holland (and their awful dialect :o). Then again the Dutch language pretty much originated here and we're unmistakably part of the Dutch family. It's just that Belgium and its Belgians are here to complicate things. Again I'm using Dutch because Flemish is technically incorrect for Brussels.

&gt;Yes corridor. If you want to get rid of the language facility or even gain independence, it's the only thing you have to offer.

Hah, if you're thinking that Belgium is going to split peacefully you're probably wrong. The Belgium system has made a peaceful breakup impossible and we're stuck in this status-quo country until the whole bloody thing comes falling down. The only possible solution I can see is Wallonia leaving and joining France, but good luck with that.

&gt;What's the threat? French imperialism? Bou-fucking-ouhou

Well if we'd make all of Flanders bilingual it wouldn't take long for Walloons and Northern French to settle here. It's not really a threat for me, but ceding territory is disadvantageous for all of Flanders economically.

&gt;English language imperialism

That's more something they should be afraid of in the Netherlands, we use English words here from time to time. But using full blown sentences makes you frankly sound ridiculous. We also use a lot of French words in Flanders, no big deal. I'm no language purist.

&gt;Even if that was true (it's not) the solution is to deprive french-speaking of their right, what's the motivation here? revenge?

They had 40 years to adapt or move. Then again I'm not saying it is a healthy situation, as the city can't grow. But if Wallonia wants to play hardball, we'll play hardball. Besides we want to have the madness of Brussels contained.

&gt;Good. They pay taxes in Brussels them.

Only if they work though. And people should pay taxes where they live, that's generally the place you want to see the infrastructure improved.

true,HolyGigi,ROMA,Romania,"It's both. Whoever thinks its only one or the other, is a plain idiot. 

#1 We have presidential elections coming up in a few months. The current president, Basescu,  had his brother acquitted even if there were recordings of the said brother getting bribes from known criminals to influence the president. Thus, Basescu had to create a diversion and try to get rid of the media trust that's 100% against him. Everyone knows that once Basescu's mandate will be over, he will go to jail for all the shit he's done - corruption mostly. 

#2 Now, on the other hand the owner of the Intact media trust is no saint either. None of the Romanian multi-milionares are self made (think Bill Gates, Mark mark Zuckerberg, etc). They all did bad shit at one point in their life and profited from that. Be it selling the fleet (our current president), buying land from the state and selling it back to the state at over 1000% markup, or ""managed"" different contracts - we have one of the most expensive freeways in the world. No, its not because its made of gold. Its because of corruption. 


As a word of advice for non-romanian folks, anytime you read about Romania's politics, always assume that what you've just read is half wrong. We have different parties, but they dont matter since people keep moving from one party to the other based on where they have the opportunity of stealing the most money. Imagine the same guy moving from liberals to conservatives to liberals again. This is a common thing here. Or today saying that ""x"" is an idiot and we should all hate him and tomorrow forming an alliance with ""x"" because.. money.

You are either playing dumb or seriously ignorant. Why don't you try reading the wikipedia article first and then the next paragraph.

Okay, done reading the article? Did you read those parts describing what makes the Nordic models more costly in general. Stuff like transfer payments in general being super high and universal. Ok, now take a look at this graph:

http://i.imgur.com/NyoZ2HW.png

What you can see here is that it is actually quite efficient to hire a Danish employee. Danish employers have to pay a relatively high income tax for their employees, but still Denmark is at the bottom of this chart (i.e. less costly to employ).

In most other countries, employers and employees are forced to pay stuff like social security and health insurance. We handle everything over taxes in Denmark. You could pick any European country south of Denmark and not one of them would have the same type of single-payer, everything-is-free welfare state that we have here. Sure, on the surface they accomplish similar things, but it is done through a combination of smaller to medium-sized welfare states and forced payments to stuff like unemployment insurance and healthcare (i.e. it is not part of taxes). The Nordic countries accomplish it through large public sectors that are tax-funded and Denmark is the prime example of this.

We also have stuff that they don't have in most other European countries, like the study grants that give each student $1000/month for studying (not a loan) as well as cheap student loans like elsewhere. We have various other kinds of transfer payments, at the top of my head there's boligstøtte which is support for renters, high child support and lots of money spent on infrastructure and culture.

&gt; The higher wages also result in higher costs. Around 25% actually. That means that even if we use more money on something, it doesn't mean that we get more of it.

That is a moot point. Norway is still _much_ wealthier even when you compare at purchasing power parity.",0,1408291657,null,0,false,0,cjsrdn6,t3_2dsho2,t1_cjsrdn6,t1_cjsqrmx,null,1435283961,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

It is indeed water, flour and yeast. I personall add a bit of olive oil, a pinch of sugar and once the dough is done I add some salt above it. I use room temperature water. Add the water little by little, mix the flour gently and try to shape it as a ball. 

I don't use any measurement - what matters is the proportion between flour and water. The roman crust it's usually thin and crunchy, if that's what you talking about. To get that effect you need to use less water than FLOUR, you have to feel the dough elastic but not too soft. It takes practice to work the dough this way, remember you can always add more flour to make it less soft. 

Let the dough rest inside the bowl you worked it in, and cover with a wet piece of cloth for at least 3 hours so the yeast can work. When you ready for the pizza you can use a rolling pin but remember this makes it easier for it to break, especially if you used little water, and overall makes the crust harder. My way of making the dough flat is by putting some oil on the plate you gonna work it on, put some on your hands too and from the center expand it gently with your hands to the boarder, this way you also have control on the thickness of the dough since you feel it.

A me sembra che tu non l'abbia letto, perchè se di tutto quello che Di Battista ha scritto, ti stupiscono due righe prese dalla stampa ed esacerberate per fare sensazionalismo mediatico, allora non hai capito bene la questione e la sua morale.

Poi, ilPost.it sminuzza la questione senza analizzare il resto di ciò che ha scritto Di Battista, con un pessimo articolo prendendo pezzi con frasi del tipo:
&gt; Precisazione: lo Stato Islamico è stato dichiarato “movimento terroristico” da diversi paesi – Stati Uniti, Regno Unito, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Arabia Saudita 

A bhe, allora l'articolo regge e Di Battista è scemo, no? Comunque sono gli stessi paesi che ci hanno precipitato in Iraq per fare guerra contro armi che non esistevamo.

Quello che Di Battista ha scritto qualche riga prima:
&gt; 4) L'Italia dovrebbe trattare il terrorismo come il cancro. Il cancro si combatte eliminandone le cause non occupandosi esclusivamente degli effetti. Altrimenti se da un lato riduci la mortalità relativa da un altro la crescita del numero di malati fa aumentare ogni anno i decessi.

Nessuno lo ha menzionato o lo ha messo nel contesto, e sembra che alcun giornale abbia preso la briga di capire il senso di quello che è stato scritto.

yes of course; I just like the succinctness of this quote, summed up 25 years of (future)history in a paragraph! 

He had really interesting ideas about land ownership, basically saying everyone (and so no-one) should be able to own it (with great 1920s linguistic flourish!); he suggested the local gov. own the land and people rent it from them I think with the money going back to welfare/infrastructure etc.

&gt;We cannot conceive man without the earth any more than without a head or a stomach. The earth is just as much a part, an organ, of man as his head. Where do the digestive organs of man begin and end? They have no beginning and no end, but form a closed system without beginning or end. The substances which man requires to maintain life are indigestible in their raw state and must go through a preparatory digestive process. And this preparatory work is not done by the mouth, but by the plant. It is the plant which collects and transmutes the substances so that they may become nutriment in their further progress through the digestive canal. Plants and the space they occupy are just as much a part of man as his mouth, his teeth or his stomach….
How, then, can we suffer individual men to confiscate for themselves parts of the earth as their exclusive property, to erect barriers and with the help of watchdogs and trained slaves to keep us away from parts of the earth, from parts of ourselves-to tear, as it were, whole limbs from our bodies? Is not such a proceeding equivalent to self-mutilation?

I moved to Montpellier from Montreal last year, and didn't expect it to be so difficult. I had proof of salary (even if I am freelance), letters of reference and all other kinds of supporting documentation, but rental agencies and private landlords wouldn't even talk to us... even if we were willing to pay 3, 6 or 12 months in advance! You might get lucky with a private landlord, but our experience was that all of them wanted us to get approved by their insurance company... which was just as demanding as a rental agency.

Eventually, we were able to get our (French) bank to act as a guarantor (after scrounging/borrowing a year's worth of rent as a deposit) AND a French friend-of-the-family to act as a guarantor for the first year (the agency was not happy about the bank for some reason). 

Barring that, the only option for us was to rent a furnished apartment. They are much less strict/paranoid and are more willing to rent to foreigners (we had one for the first 3 or 4 months while we searched for a permanent place). The downside is, of course, that it is more expensive and may or may not be enough for a visa application (if you need a real lease or utilities in your name, for example).

Just some hours later students created big cloths and put them over the graffitis, stating that everyone is welcome.

Don't forget you aren't alone. Many foreign students will join you. Most universities have programs where you get together.

In bigger cities there are a lot of arabian people, very multi-cultural.

Which is useless when you don't factor in wage levels and productivity.  [Danish workers are less productive than Belgians therefore it may still be more worth it in the end.](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=PDB_GR)

&gt; In most other countries, employers and employees are forced to pay stuff like social security and health insurance. We handle everything over taxes in Denmark.

Does that mean you get a better system? It doesn't have to be since both Norway and Sweden handle healthcare and social security through dedicated taxes. Doesn't mean the service is better in Denmark though.

&gt; We also have stuff that they don't have in most other European countries, like the study grants that give each student $1000/month for studying (not a loan) as well as cheap student loans like elsewhere. 

The money covered by grants is probably the only benefit that is a little better in Denmark than other countries. Is it worth paying 50% tax for? I don't think so. 

&gt;  We have various other kinds of transfer payments, at the top of my head there's boligstøtte which is support for renters, high child support.

Not unique to Denmark.

&gt; and lots of money spent on infrastructure and culture.

How do you define lots? Everything is relative. The infrastructure in Denmark is on par with the rest of the Western countries. Not to mention that Denmark is a very tiny country which makes it very easy to build infrastructure. Culture spending is also something that doesn't really matter. Why should i pay for some mediocre artist or painter to be able to live of his work if it's not sustainable without public support?

true,waveswan,SWED,Sweden,"You don't know much about the situation in Sweden. We have a nice little cluster-fuck of social issues which combined with the usual squabbling in government prevents anything from being done. In particular: 

* Getting ""state money"" is not as easy as you think. It's a load of paperwork and comes with a nice little bureaucracy of requirements that many homeless and mentally ill people cannot live up to. In addition it only applies to citizens, and not those who come here because the policies towards minorities in Eastern europe is simply put abysmal. 

* Instead of building social housing and hiring staff to care for the homeless, the government is running their own homeless shelters, at a cost which exceeds that of apartments and staff to care for the people in question by at least a factor of two.  

* The left and right cannot agree on how to run the housing market, meaning that we've got the combination of all the worst policies imaginable. Price controls, regressive taxes, little social housing, strong regulations for first hand contracts, but few for second hand ones, little private investment and so on... The queue for a single room apartment in a city is 3-5 years. 

* As with many other countries the ""job creation scheme"" here is based on the idea of threatening the unemployed with withdrawn benefits if they don't do everything imaginable to get a job. Since there are on average 30 people or so applying for each position, this has the effect of causing highly trained individuals to take on entry-level jobs, thus causing those without qualifications to be unable to find employment. It does of course not create any additional jobs at all, since most positions are saturated with applicants anyway, but the ""morality"" of making people work for benefits is apparently more important than making the system work. 

* We too have the fantastically stupid war on drugs, which comes with the nice addition that people must demonstrate that they are clean off drugs **before** they can qualify for neurological evaluations for things like ADHD. Combine it with a half a year wait for said evaluations, and a highly understaffed psychiatric healthcare system and you can see how it causes an issue or two. 

* A great many of the beggars are migrants from eastern Europe. The local politics in those countries holds that the poor people are lazy savages who only drink and have many children, and thus it can't be helped that they are poor and unable to find a job. Of course, one also cannot actually try to combat discrimination or employ anti-poverty programs, because the poor people are lazy and immoral and don't deserve such help anyway.

Really, we have people sitting in the street begging in Swedish midwinter. That's not something that you do just for the fun of it, and do you honestly think they would bother if they could just ""take state money"" ? Do you honestly believe they sit in the gutter to be spat on and harassed by police just because it's easier than to ask the social services for help?

He's agreeing with Orban's assessment that we'd unintentionally strengthened Russia through the sanctions (AKA shooting oneself in the foot).

Orban is saying that we've made Russia stronger, relative to the EU.

Linas says in response: if we didn't make russia stronger, relative to the EU (if we didn't shoot ourselves in the foot), Russia would be stronger relative to the EU, (Russia would shoot us).

&gt;I think they both imply the different things: Orban thinks that we just made ourselves weaker and Linkevičius says that we made Russia weaker with some costs, which, in his opinion, is not bad.

That's the problem. Orban makes a point (We've weakened ourselves relative to Russia) which Linas agrees with (""if we didn't...""), then goes on to contradict it.

Kamaz truck can carry 11 tons max (weight limit) / 36,5 cubic meters (volume limit). Take sugar, for example. It has density of 0,7 kg/m^3. Hence, 11 tons of sugar take only 7,7 cubic meters. Most food has similar density. So, unless you're transporting something lightweight, trucks simply *cannot be* filled to top volume due to weight limit. Besides that, it's really not a good idea to send truck filled to its weight limit over non-existing roads in countryside or over rubble after artillery strikes.

It's seventh-grade physics and math, not rocket science.

&gt; You ate proving my point with fake photo claims.

How, exactly?

&gt; If a journalist lies in the west they lose their reputation.

Let's travel a little back in time, to Jul 2013. No Ukraine, no Crimea, no Putin is literally Hitler, no nothing. NYT publishes [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/opinion/russias-anti-gay-crackdown.html?_r=0) that says: «the law could mean that any Olympic athlete, trainer, reporter, family member or fan who is gay — or suspected of being gay, or just accused of being gay — can go to jail.» Which is blatant lie, and it's obvious to anyone who actually reads the law in question. Did that Mr. Fierstain lost any reputation? Did NYT published an article that corrects him? I'm not even talking about apologies, but just an article that discusses actual law in question and not Mr. Fierstain's fantasies? N-o-p-e. Apparently honesty isn't a job requirement in NYT as well.

&gt; Soviets committed genocide just like Germans did.

One evil does not justifies another. This is not even touching that Soviets did not committed *genocide*.

&gt; How do you want Eastern Europe to treat Soviet invaders?

But we are not talking about Soviet invaders. We are talking about (some) Estonians collaborating with Nazi, gladly serving not just in army but in freaking SS squads - and feeling *nothing wrong* with it even today. Germans, the guys who started all this, feel wrong. But not Estonians. (I do hope that not all Estonians are like that. But some are.) 

Russification, albeit mandatory, was a means to establishing state that connects multiple nations. Soviet Union didn't erased culture of annexed states. Local languages where not forbidden, they were taught in schools. Local culture was sponsored so it wouldn't be crushed by massive Russian culture. On the other hand, Nazis did tried to erase not just culture but *nations themselves*.

You should fear it as much as getting mugged by a random stranger or getting hit by a car. Unless you are very unlucky you will be fine.

Just to give you a random figure: In Berlin, during the whole year of 2013, it came to ca. 70 violent acts caused by Neo-nazis. This is considered a very high number of incidents and overall there are around 1400 neo-nazis living in Berlin, a city with 3.5 million people.

If we look at those 70 incidents we dont even know who they attacked. Most likely that some of those attacks targeted other germans (anti-nazi youth, random drunks etc).

I have a girlfriend who is black and i know that there is a lot of subtle racism. In some parts of germany its much more an issue (looking at you Bavaria) then in others. fE we were traveling to Munich and made a stop in a small town where she tried to buy bread in a small bakery. They completely ignored her and served every other customer first, even people who enter the shop way after her, before she could buy something. 

But even something like that is a rare incident. Still something like this much more likely to happen then anything else.

People may indeed put themselves into debt while at university, but this is despite getting around 6000 kr per month from the government and not having to pay a cent for tuition - I doubt many people go broke buying course books.

I don't know enough to refute your military or school points, except to point out most NATO countries spend about the same percentage of their GDP on their military as we do, and that the methods we use to compare different school systems are deeply problematic (in my opinion).

As for apartments in the city, ask a Frenchman what a Paris flat costs, ask a Brit what it costs to rent a place in London, or even worse: look up rent in New York City or San Francisco. Any attractive city is expensive, and like it or not, Copenhagen is attractive :)

Finally, according to Wikipedia we're in 10th place for HDI. Out of 102. How is that bad?

According to the wiki a TGV uses 20 kWh/km. This map has around 40000 kms, so using 10 trains daily would be around 40000 km\*20kWh/km\*10 trains = 8 million  kWh. If we use 0.3USD for the price of a kWh we can conclude that a daily maintenance price would be minimum of ~2.4 million USD. If there are a mimumum of 2000 passengers on a line daily then 17 lines \* 2000 ps = 34000, 2.4 mill / 34000 = that would mean a minimum average price of 70 usd. Not so bad. Sure, you have to add the workers cost + trains cost + rails cost so I think the average would be more lik 200 usd. And I am sure I screwed up the computation somewhere. And I am not sure what 20 kWh/km really means.

You claimed "" The organisers of the Gaza protests claimed to be standing up for humanitarianism"" on your previous comment"" when nobody protested for humanitarianism. You and the media made this up to then accuse them of a false hypocrisy.

&gt; But European Muslims for whatever reason get upset enough to stage mass protests and riots only when Israelis, Americans, or Europeans are killing (Arab) Muslims. When it's Muslims killing Muslims, Jews, Christians, Yazidis, whatever, there is barely a peep beyond the token condemnations on television and there are certainly not mass protests in every European capital.

Funny. You're writing this on a thread about protests in Europe for Kurds, in which Muslims have participated (not your beloved baddy Islamists though, so go ahead and pretend no Muslims were there and all Muslims are extremists ISIS cells, ie.

Le [Oxford English Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/how-many-words-are-there-in-the-english-language), dans sa version la plus complète (LA référence, en vingt volumes !) compte 170 000 mots, en ajoutant les dérivations et les archaïsmes ça fait un peu moins de 230 000.

Tout ça pour dire qu'on peut compter, mais qu'au final ça changera pas grand-chose. Il y a des mots intraduisibles, d'autres qui ont un parfait équivalent dans les deux langues... Il faut aussi décider ce qu'on considère comme un mot à mettre dans le dico (dérivations ou pas dérivations ?)... des débats sur lesquels les linguistes s'entendent pas eux-mêmes !",0,1408303255,null,0,false,0,cjswmnl,t3_2dsfkr,t1_cjswmnl,t1_cjsw767,null,1435286565,4,false,france,t5_2qhjz,4

* **Kuunsirppi**, literally ""sickle of the moon"" = crescent moon.
* **Ukkonen**, literally ""small/dear old man"" referring to Ukko, the thunder god of the pagan Finns = thunder.

Months that have an understandable meaning in modern Finnish: 

* January = ""Tammikuu"", literally ""oak month"", but original meaning was ""core month"".
* February = ""Helmikuu"", literally ""pearl month"", according to some referring to icy pearls that form on trees on the end of February when temperatures start rising.
* May = ""Toukokuu"" literally ""farming works of the spring -month"", as ""touko"" means field work carried out in the spring.
* June = ""Kesäkuu"", literally ""summer month"".
* June = ""Heinäkuu"", literally ""Hay month"", referring to agricultural haywork.
* August = ""Elokuu"", literally ""living month"", referring to agricultural word ""elonkorjuu"", the gathering of the crops.
* Septemger = ""Syyskuu"", literally ""Autumn month"".
* October = ""Lokakuu"", literally ""dirty slushly sleet month"" (loka = dirty slushy sleet)
* December = ""Joulukuu"", literally ""Yule month"".

Finnish has some terms reflecting the recent agricultural past.

""*Puinti*"" is the word for treshing cereals to separate the edible grain from the stem. ""*Riihi*"" is a word for a small building where cereal crops were treshed and then dried. From these we get sayings like these:

*Aivoriihi* = brainstorming in a group, aivo meaning brain. *Kehysriihi* = the government negotiations on budget, kehys meanin frames. *Riihikuivaa* = Adjective for net income. Literally ""dry as from riihi"", used like ""I get 1000 dollars of *riihikuiva* money"", meaning you get the 1000 dollars and no taxes or anything go from that.

And when you settle some conflict, like someone has an argument, or something is very unclear to different people, causing confusion, settling this thing is ""puinti"" as in separating the grain.

Related is also ""erotetaan jyvät akanoista"", which has the meaning ""let's see who is the real thing and who's not"". Literally it means ""let's separate the grains from their scales"", which is something that happens while threshing cereals.",0,1408303358,null,0,1408303548,0,cjswode,t3_2dsige,t1_cjswode,t1_cjsmg4f,null,1435286582,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Kurze Antwort: Ja.

Etwas länger: Religionsfreiheit steht im Grundgesetz, Tierschutz ""nur"" im BGB. GG schlägt BGB. Da ich kein Jurist bin, kann ich die genau Abwägung des Rechts gar nicht vornehmen.

Komisch, dass das noch keiner ausgeführt hat, so schwer ist das doch gar nicht. Stattdessen hier lange Aufsätze über Methoden des Tötens von Schlachtvieh und was genau Tierquälerei ist. Ist nämlich alles ziemlich irrelevant. Jedenfall nach aktuellem Recht. Für Änderungen des GG bräuchte es eine 2/3 Mehrheit im Bundestag. Gegen Religionsfreiheit? Keine Chance. Dafür bräuchte es eine populistische Partei wie die AfD mit mindestens 20% bei den Wahlen und eine sehr schlimme wirtschaftliche Situation. Da hätte die NPD dann auch locker 15%, oder so.

* ""Shipshape and Bristol fashion"" - said of something that is in good order, well built, neat and tidy etc.

  (As a Bristolian I approve this absolutely accurate association in our language between things that are built in Bristol and things that are done properly. The saying comes from when Bristol was the UK's second port and ships had to be very well built to deal with our high tides, so Bristol got a reputation for good shipbuilding and engineering in general.) 

* ""fine words butter no parsnips"" - talking about doing something doesn't get it done. 

* ""Bugger this for a game of soldiers""  - this task is too difficult/unpleasant/not worth the effort and so I'm not going to bother finishing it. (Commonly thought to date from WWI) 

* ""as the actress said to the Bishop"" - the older version of 'that's what she said' used to point out when someone has inadvertently uttered what could be taken for sexual innuendo. 

* ""carry coals to Newcastle"" to do something useless (Newcastle was a coal-mining Town so they already had plenty of coal.) 

* ""It's all Greek to me"" - *From Shakespeare*. I can't understand this at all.  

* ""Bob's your uncle"" - emphasising that a task is simple to complete, often used at the end of a set of instructions. Roughly equivalent to French  ""et voilà!"".  (often connected to Prime Minister Robert (Bob) Cecil appointing his Nephew  Arthur Balfour as foreign secretary, but this is doubtful as the expression isn't coined until a few decades later.)  

* ""All mouth and no trousers"" - used about a person who's good at talk but not at action. 

* ""Mad as a box of frogs"" -totally insane.

* ""Pop one's clogs"" (he popped his clogs) - to die (he died) 

* ""Take the piss"" - to mock, to lie blatantly or to take unwarranted liberties.

1. The line Oslo - Helsinki can be extended to St. Petersburg. Concerning price/time considerations, this can be done over the existing Talinn-St. Petersburg line. This can then potentially be extended to Moscow.
2.This same line can also be extended from Oslo to Bergen; it's the end of the line, so you're not really letting other people take longer.
3. Geneva has to be included; it's Geneva. Suggestions are to make red go through Strasbourg - Zurich - (Basel/Bern?) - Geneva - Dijon - Lyon - Turin - Milano. Personally I think the Zurich-detour is unnecessary. 
4. http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=jpvvbc&amp;s=8#.U_EMkLvn4xA But I think these include too many small lines. Perhaps the small lines are better done by local train companies?

There is a threat of social problems, such as drugs, violence, prostitution, etc. so a big part of our job there was to discuss the risks and ways of prevention.
