Public companies are notoriously bad for making a profit, because the incentives aren't in place. If nationalizing companies truly was the way forward, then everything would be nationalized. In practice there are a few criteria for which nationalizing companies makes sense such as in natural monopolies.

* Taxation follows a Latiff curve, the more you tax companies, the higher the tax revenue, up to a point. At which point companies begin leaving, and welfare revenue from taxing corporations goes down, while welfare expenditure goes up due to rising unemployment.

Nationalizing major companies costs no money unless the state desires to recompensate the people who lose control of the business such as investors. Even if they do this, the one-time expense of giving people recompense through a state determined valuation of the assets by no means exceed the enormous profits to be made for the public sector.

&gt;Taxation follows a Latiff curve, the more you tax companies, the higher the tax revenue, up to a point. At which point companies begin leaving, and welfare revenue from taxing corporations goes down, while welfare expenditure goes up due to rising unemployment&lt;

Apparently, you're unaware that this so-called ""flight of capital"" has never been proven. The Latiff curve is a theoretical framework, created by Chichago and Austrian school economists and it has no practical foundation. Hence, it is not - scientifically speaking - even a theory. A theory requires some form of practical observation of phenomena and the Latiff Curve has no such thing.

&gt;Not to mention that as corporation tax rises, these costs won't just eat into corporate profits, a % will also be passed along to consumer in the form of higher prices.&lt;

Again you're wrong. Increased corporate taxation will only be passed on to the consumer if government allows it to be. It is entirely possible to tell a company that they're not allowed to raise prices to compensate for a tax increase. They can easily be forced to eat the expense themselves. Its just a matter of regulation. Ofcourse, the ideal situation is complete nationalization without compensation, since this would counter every single negative you suggest: 1). There would be no cost associated with nationalization. 2). No expense would be passed on to the consumer. 3). The state would garner all profits gained from running the company and could put those money to use on social welfare programs, free tuition, better schooling etc. This system is much more efficient than a private-run company, since capital is distributed inefficiently in a capitalist system. 

&gt;The more educated you are, the more likely you to earn more, the more likely you are to go somewhere with lower levels of tax. Norway is a terrible example due to oil.&lt;

I just countered this argument and you simply ignore it. You'd make a terrific politician.

As i said neither of this has happened in Denmark or Norway for that matter. Would you care to explain to me why your hypothesis of brain drain doesn't explain the fact that no educated labour is emigrating from Denmark, Norway or Iceland en masse?

You wrote: ""Für mein Urlaub Ich ging zu Deutschland, von 8 Juni bis 20 Juni.""  
Here you basically just switched the english words in the sentence with the german ones. ""For my holiday i went to Germany, from the 8th to the 20th of June"".  
As a rule: Never do that. Our grammar is too different to just switch the words.  
Now... because my ancestors were fucked up in the head, our language can say the same thing in a bunch of different ways... but one thing that holds true in nearly every sentence is that a verb has to be at the second position in a normal sentence (read: as long as it is not a question).  
before the first comma, there are 4 parts of your sentence  
1) Für mein(en) Urlaub  
2) Ich  
3) ging
4) zu Deutschland  
the verb ""ging"" is on third place, switch it to second place and we get  
Für meinen Urlaub ging ich zu Deutschland  
now to get a correct sentence we have to realize that ""zu"" in this context is the wrong word, it has to be ""nach""... the rules for ""zu"" and ""nach""... maybe someone else can explain? :D  
so the correct sentence now is  
Für meinen Urlaub ging ich nach Deutschland.  
And while this is a correct sentence, and everybody would understand it, i am sorry to say that no one ever talks like this.  
In english the phrase ""for my holiday i went..."" is very normal, the phrase used in germany is ""Im Urlaub war ich...""  
Sooo  
""Im Urlaub war ich in Deutschland, vom achten bis zu zwanzigsten Juni.""  
Now if you want to put the dates first you go  
Vom 8. bis 20. Juni war ich in Deutschland, im Urlaub.  
Notice how the verb ""war"" still is on the second position? O.K. :D i don't know if this helps...

The state can take control of companies without recompensating its owners.

Even if they do this, the one-time expense of giving people recompense through a **state determined valuation** of the assets by no means exceed the enormous profits to be made for the public sector.

Ho semplicemente ribaltato il tuo sarcasmo per dire che sì, chi fa quello che ho detto è un animalista di merda. Veramente non so come spiegartelo, non capisco cosa ci sia di difficile da capire.

Dimmi pure quando ho detto che ""esser animalista vuol dire mandare minacce di morte alla Provincia o boicottare il trentino"".

Infine come ti ho detto la presenza degli orsi in Trentino non è (più) naturale (per colpa di chi un tempo li faceva fuori a colpi di doppietta ovviamente, ma non è questo il punto) e quindi è costantemente monitorata, anche perchè essendo stati introdotti dall'esterno non sempre si comportano in maniera prevedibile.

true,WArch,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Bless, but this comment chain is without a doubt the most crazy that I've ever seen on this sub :')

I'll try go through everything you said:

&gt;This is the great neoliberal lie. The austerity folks wants you to believe that cutting public spending is the only way to increase revenue. 

I'll give you the benefit of the doubt by presuming that you meant 'pro-austerity people think that cutting spending will reduce the deficit', not 'pro-austerity people think that cutting spending increases revenue'.

In reality, in the debate amongst economists, there is no 'pro-austerity' and 'anti-austerity' camp. People don't debate whether expansionary fiscal policy exists (because it is the logical consequence of deficit spending), they argue whether it is *appropriate* to a specific scenario. Britain at the moment is one example of a country that is not in need of a stimulus. Running a structural deficit to reduce the cyclical deficit is fine, but arguing that a country should run a structural deficit to reduce the structural deficit is insane and will lead to an overheated economy and a massive crash.

&gt;There is any number of things you can do that doesn't cut welfare:

&gt;•	Nationalize major companies so that their profit might be used to finance the welfare state.

&gt;•	increase taxation of corporations. I should remind you that the very same people who are calling for cuts in public spending to increase revenue are spending that extra money on cutting taxes for corporations.

Nationalise major companies then tax...the private companies that you just nationalised?

In any case, the nationalised companies wouldn't run a profit as there is an insane quantity of peer-reviewed literature that nationalised companies are less efficient. This isn't an ideology or even a debate, it's simply something that's been observed. Speaking of which, when you were asked about examples of sucesfull nationalisations:

&gt;Sure. There were massive nationalization programs initiated by Social democrats in Both Denmark and Britain during the latter parts of the first half of the 20th century. This included nationalization of banks, infrastructure and some key big companies. This helped create the social democratic welfare states which we have today.

The post-war nationalisations in countries such as Britain are examples of failures, not successes.

&gt;There were massive nationalization programs initiated by Social democrats in Both Denmark and Britain during the latter parts of the first half of the 20th century.

&gt;Also if nationalization caused collapse than i'm surprised that Britain and Denmark didn't collapse in the 50's. Or that Venezuela hasn't collapsed now and has, in fact, reduced poverty by staggering amounts.

&gt;There are no problems. The standard complaint is that it'll provoke brain drain - This effect has however NEVER been demonstrated. In fact, countries with high taxation and big public sectors are more likely to ATTRACT educated people because such a system is viewed as more humane. Denmark and Norway are great examples of this.

&gt;As i said neither of this has happened in Denmark or Norway for that matter. Would you care to explain to me why your hypothesis of brain drain doesn't explain the fact that no educated labour is emigrating from Denmark, Norway or Iceland en masse?

Denmark and Norway do not have mixed economies, they have capitalist economies and do not have a greater proportion of their economy nationalised than you would expect to find in an OECD country. 

&gt;Nationalizing major companies costs no money unless the state desires to recompensate the people who lose control of the business such as investors. Even if they do this, the one-time expense of giving people recompense through a state determined valuation of the assets by no means exceed the enormous profits to be made for the public sector.

In economics the technical term for this is ""*going full retard*"". If you violate property rights this bad then investment will drop and the one-off ""profits"" made by the public sector will slowly be drained away by the extra running costs over many decades of inefficiency

&gt;Apparently, you're unaware that this so-called ""flight of capital"" has never been proven. The Latiff curve is a theoretical framework, created by Chichago and Austrian school economists and it has no practical foundation. Hence, it is not - scientifically speaking - even a theory. A theory requires some form of practical observation of phenomena and the Latiff Curve has no such thing.

This is also wrong. The tipping point at which revenue decreases is often a lot higher than some politicians admit, but it does exist and in the past Sweden has been observed as an example of a country above the revenue maximising point (but the revenue-maximising point isn't necessarily the growth-maximising point so you wouldn't necessarily want to be at the revenue-maximising point for extended periods anyway.

&gt;Again you're wrong. Increased corporate taxation will only be passed on to the consumer if government allows it to be. It is entirely possible to tell a company that they're not allowed to raise prices to compensate for a tax increase. They can easily be forced to eat the expense themselves. Its just a matter of regulation. Ofcourse, the ideal situation is complete nationalization without compensation, since this would counter every single negative you suggest: 1). There would be no cost associated with nationalization. 2). No expense would be passed on to the consumer. 3). The state would garner all profits gained from running the company and could put those money to use on social welfare programs, free tuition, better schooling etc. 

&gt;Whatmore, you should reconsider the succes of Venezuela. Keep in mind that all your information comes from right-wing media. I'd advise you to check out venezuelaanalysis.com This site is run by a Professor of Economics who has founded The Center for Economic and Policy Studies, as an independent source for analysis on venezuela.

Ok, so firstly corporate tax rises will cut utility from two groups: the consumers and shareholders. The precise balance between how much of the cost will be borne by consumers and how much will be borne out of lower profits is debatable, but it will come out of both. 

Price controls are terrible and this isn't a left or right wing opinion. Paul Krugman called rent controls the second quickest way to destroy a city after nuclear weapons. For example, contrary to what many people who don't live there like to think Venezuela's experience with price controls has been terrible and led to huge shortages because companies simply won't sell goods if they're going to make a loss (or make a greater gain elsewhere).

&gt;This system is much more efficient than a private-run company, since capital is distributed inefficiently in a capitalist system.

But again, this is simply wrong. You seem to be in a time-warp where none of the economic peer-reviewed literature since about 1950 seems to count. Centrally-planned economies invariably perform less well than their capitalist counter-parts.

Now you might have noticed that I've referred to the err-reviewed literature quite a lot, but not brought up any sources, and there's a reason for that: I can't be bothered. This is a comment on a website and I recognise someone who isn't going to have his mind changed even if the evidence is put right in front of them. Suffice to say that I know that I'm right because I've read the various peer-reviewed studies whilst I was at university and I can't be bothered to waste time fishing them out again because in the past I've always been downvoted for bringing out peer-reviewed studies. At which point I'll bring up my last point to do with things you said at one point or other in this comment chain:

&gt;The fact that you're incapable of telling me WHY they're terrible ideas suggests you're wrong.

&gt;Also, let me give you a bit of a tip, mate: I'm not the one obligated to find arguments for your opinions, you are.

&gt;The fact that you can't refute my argumentation and instead attempt to deride it through ridicule is pathetic.

&gt;You're a waste of my time.

&gt;I'm sorry but you're not grasping the fundamentals of this.

&gt;I just countered this argument and you simply ignore it. You'd make a terrific politician.

You know, when you propose things you're meant to back them up, not simply make statements and expect someone to disprove them for you. An argument should stand on its own weight, not on the stamina of other people finding things that disprove you.

I don't think it is the right question to ask whether an independent Catalunya would be viable, because the question assumes a causality relationship where viability will determine independence. I believe that, on the contrary, if the people of Catalunya decide to become independent, they will find a way to make the new country viable. And if they decide to stay with Spain, they will make it viable too.

His answer was: why bother with reading when you can just listen and also have 100% focus on the picture.

So basically what he was saying is that he doesn't give a shit if the dub is horrendous from a voice acting perspective and where the translations simply can't be possibly mirrored, he simply wants the comfort of not reading text.
I must also add he was into really bad, action-focused movies. Take something from Uwe Boll and he would probably enjoy it or at the very least digest it, give him a Requiem for a Dream, Schindller's List or Shawkshank's Redemption and he's gonna absolutely hate them.

I don't mean to bash but the culture they grew up with is simply words apart. He is Romanian (so am I by extension) and he lived most of his life under the communist curtain. He was already in his 30s by the time you had ease of access to modern non-censored television, internet and media in general. 

And the kids nowdays that are not exposed to the originals will suffer all the same. Look at me, speaking english just fine even though I never learned it in school. I will go back and say thank you to all those cartoons, movies and games I had to consume in english otherwise there was no other option except not participating.

Living in Spain at the moment and people my age (early 20s) come to me sometimes and talk about / suggest big Hollywood blockbusters while using the regional translation and just mindfuck me, mostly because even if you translate them directly you still don't get the original.

In pratica si tratta di piano, stipulato d'accordo con la tua Banca (eventualmente tramite un promotore finanziario), mediante il quale acquisti ogni mese quote di un fondo di investimento per un controvalore appunto di 100 Euro. Le commissioni per la Banca di solito sono piu' convenienti che non facendo un singolo ordine differente. Inoltre mi sembra che, se nel dossier titoli possiedi solo fondi di investimento e non altri titoli (come azioni, warrant, etc.) non dovresti pagare l'imposta di bollo (non sono al sicuro al 100% che questo non sia stato cambiato dalle ultime manovre).

Ci sono pero' due considerazioni importanti da fare: per prima cosa la scelta del fondo. Se e' molto rischioso rischi di perdere parte di quello che hai messo da parte. Se e' poco rischioso il tuo ricavo potrebbe essere irrisorio.

E poi comunque devi farti spiegare bene tutti i costi: presenza o meno del bollo, quante e quali commissioni per la banca, eventualmente quante commissioni per il Promotore, altre ed eventuali.

OH! It's a year old but there was a new Asterix comics book. You might highlight the french humor especialy with our way to play with words (we also love to be sarcastics this way sometimes). You can also talk about the french comics culture (actually French-Belgian, more than other europeans) that you can linked to Asian culture of manga.

Then you can speak about how Asterix humour as inspire french comic industry (you can take the exemple of [Lanfeust de Troy](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanfeust_de_Troy)).

Actually you can talk about so many things from this (for some facts, France is the first export market of japaneese cultural goods and US comics are also popular).

The SNP make full use of their devolved powers, with the exception of powers varying on income tax. Why? Because the UK government when signing these powers over, entered the stipulation that all tax bands must be altered by the same percentage, making them effectively unusable.

Things aren't being fixed though, they've been getting worse since the 70s.

I'm not arguing this point. Take note that the scoring system doesn't think this is that big of a deal.

&gt; A lack of hate crimes law is a serious issue. A racially-aggravated or sexual orientation-aggravated assault should be punished more harshly.

Oh really? Is that obvious? So gay people, brown people, black people, women, transgender people, immigrants are ***actually worth more*** than a regular middle aged white dude with no strong ideological leanigs? Attacking them is a more serious crime? What about nerdly looking teenagers? What if some punks attack a bunch of neo-nazis? Doesn't that sound like a ""hate crime""?  What if a bunch of idiot assholes get in a fight with each other, and one party just happends to fit a category which is more frequently the target of attacks? 

I know I'm painting things in black and white here, but this isn't nearly as obvious as some people think it is. Even if you accept that certain motivations need harsher punishment, which makes sense in principle, this isn't as easy to identify. Not everything is a hate crime because a minority is involved, and if someone who doesn't belong to a protected minority, that doesn't mean it *wasn't* a hate crime. Even the name is ridiculous, calling them ""hate crimes"", as if other people attacking each other wasn't motivated by hate. You're just opening a can of worms that makes people less equal, not more. If someone was robbed, it's a robbery, and if someone was beat up, it's assault, and we'll let the *judges* use their, well, *judgement* to determin if someone deserves a harsher punishment because of their motivation. 

Even if you disagree with my position, I'm not pulling this out of my ass, and many qualified people argue that those kinds of laws might even make things worse. So no, a lack of hate crimes law isn't a serious issue, it's a manifestation of different views on how certain problems should be addressed.

&gt; The reality is that the UK is actually exemplary in terms of LGBT rights, in part because we got there later than some other countries, so we did a better job and made sure to cover things other countries missed.

Scotland *Will* face this decision in the future. Scotland is a completely viable state, but not in the way it has been outlined to the population. It will not be smooth, and it will not be cushy, and the poor *will* get poorer before they get richer. 

As an Englishman, I am happy to pay higher tuition fees to ensure the safety of my state in the future. I would sacrifice a lot to keep our union together. At the moment, Scotland has free prescriptions, free universities and a devolved and representational parliament. English people from the poorer regions don't get this luxury, and Scotland becoming independent will threaten the continuation of these benefits for you.

For instance, if we become two seperate countries, Scotland won't be able to stop hundreds of English students flooding its university expecting free tuition, and Scotland will not be able to stop them. Denmark tried, and they're getting told off by the EU. A lot of strain will suddenly be on very newly formed organisations. I just fear for the future of an independent state.

There no way that France is anywhere close to 27% Muslim for any age group. France doesn't collect official data for religion or ethnicity so we don't have official census data, but we have polls and population estimates.

[The data suggests that France is between 3% to 10% Muslim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_France#Statistics)

Also [projections don't suggest that the number of Muslims will rise rapidly anytime soon](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/28/muslim-population-country-projection-2030), which is what would happen if there a lot young Muslims in the population.

Also, around 50% to 70% (depending on how you ask) of French Muslims are non-practicing.

Here's a few questions:

What is French nursing school like? 

What kind of responsibilities do nurses have? Can you specialize? 

Do you have other health care providers working in the hospital too, like respiratory therapists and physiotherapists?

Canada loves nurses, is nursing a good job in France?

Is there opportunity for nurses to advance their education? (In Canada, you can get a Master or PhD in Nursing and either be an independent clinician (Nurse Practitioner) or work in research/academia.)

Reconnaissez que ce type de condamnations dément la conformité aux principes démocratiques et républicains qu’affiche le Front National et vient casser l’image de parti convenable que les médias veulent nous vendre !

Les élus de l’UMP semblent eux être « spécialisés », au regard des condamnations et mises en examen dont ils font l’objet, dans l’abus de biens sociaux et détournements de fonds publics.

Rather than Nationalising a profitable company, the UK government took an already national company that was *making* them money ant then sold it for a fraction of what it's worth.

Scotland *will* be in control of it's own purse strings, we will be able to make the changes *we* think are best for us, not what the UK government thinks is best for them. We don't expect everything to be easy or great, but we'll feel better about whatever decisions we make.

I'm glad people who otherwise wouldn't have the opportunity can get a well paying job and contribute more to society. I'm glad my peers can leave a course without feeling they need to complete it due to financial debt.

Scotland has these things because we hold them important. Evidently the people the rest of the UK elected do not, I doubt that'll change in the future.

England holds university important, but it was a very expensive thing. An independent Scotland would likely be swarmed with an unstoppable flood of English students wanting free university. Scotland doesn't have those things because it holds them important, it's because it merely had the means to do it.

You can't join the EU without a central bank. Promised entrance to the EU fasttracked, despite Presidents saying that won't happen. Does this concern Scotland?

Sono /u/throwawayritaly, come già sapete.

***********

un utente già ieri mi informava di post che ha recuperato da /r/300pd, e raccoglieva screenshot e redditlog. Come dicevo all' utente ieri,

&gt; Se vuoi postare i link al redditlog so /r/italy io sono assolutamente d'accordo eh. Però boh non ci perderei tutto sto tempo.

Non capisco, onestamente. Non capisco chi ""trolla"" e, come è testimoniato dai redditlog tristissimi che mi ha mostrato quell' utente, spende giornate intere del suo tempo a costruire e gestire queste cose, non capisco voi utenti che downvotate a cazzo, non capisco i mod che hanno lasciato che questo posto diventasse un calzino pieno di sbora secca (guardate l' homepage adesso. Seriamente. Cos'è /r/italy, studio aperto?).

Io il mio l'ho fatto. Per mesi, mi sono fatto insultare. Ho sempre risposto da signore e non mi sono abbassato al livello di chi mi sputava in faccia. Ciononostante, almeno a giudicare dal thread dove si chiedeva barabba libero, pare che il cattivo sia io.

Pensate che io sia un pazzo? Non c'è problema. Davvero. Rimanete qua, godetevi i post sul tipo di personalità e fatevi dei bei rasponi a vicenda su quanto il PD sia il partito migliore in Italia e su quanto siete fighi perchè è normale che qua sia così siccome siete tutti utenti che ne sanno di informatica e che hanno un certo livello culturale (cit.).

Pensate, come me, che qua ci sia qualcosa di quantomeno strano riguardo il modo in cui vengono upvotati e downvotati i post, a prescindere da specifici utenti e/o specifici mod? Volete un posto in cui si possa discutere apertamente, senza retorica, senza doverla pensare in un certo modo, di politica e non solo? Vi aspettiamo su /r/politicaITA. 

Pensate, come me, che non sia bello che un manipolo di troll monopolizzi il nome dell' italia su reddit? Pensate, come me, che i mod (per qualsivoglia ragione) visto lo stato pietoso in cui è il sub non stiano facendo il lavoro che dovrebbero fare? Scrivete agli admin di reddit e chiedete chiarezza. Hanno ascoltato me, un pirla con un account throwawayritaly a -1000 di comment karma, scommetto che ascoltano anche voi. Magari non c'è niente sotto e questo è un caso isolato, e i miliardi di downvote che arrivano a chi non canta col coro sono organici. Magari, no. Io personalmente credo che a questo punto valga almeno la pena di saperlo.

Se questo fosse /r/cazzateitaliane, o /r/circlejerkPD o /r/grillinidimerda o /r/liciogelliforpresident direi ""ma bene, avanti così"" e vi inviterei a continuare a farvi i bei segotti che vi fate a vicenda. Ma siccome è /r/italy e questo è il primo reddit che un italiano nuovo su reddit guarda vi dico: volete fare i ""troll""? fatelo pure, ma da un' altra parte. Tanto è solo ""for the lulz"", no? Andate a divertirvi da qualche altra parte e lasciate il campo libero a chi vuole discutere civilmente.

Come dicevo nel thread originale su /r/300pd - non è importante che sia vero oppure no, è un post che descrive il reale andamento del sub. Che ci siano downvote brigades credo sia chiaro come il sole dopo i vari thread #lousibetalibbero etc. Se tutto il sub sia una downvote brigade non lo so, può anche essere. In tal caso vi invito come sopra a farvi un bel sub vostro e levarvi dal cazzo.

Don't worry, my French is kinda broken too ;)

So, about nursing school :

* It take place in a ""IFSI"" (Institut de soins infirmiers). Each IFSI is connected with a university. 

* It last 3 years. You need to pass a contest, with a 10% rate of admissions. First it's an essay about French social and society like ""Depression in the elderly s"" and some psycho technical tests. Both test are sanctioned by a grade, 0 to 20. If you have more than 20 points at both combined, you advance to the next step. It's an oral, like ""Medecinal Canabis, are you ok with it?"". It's not about being wrong or right, it's more to see your reaction, social skills, etc etc.. In front of you gonna stand 3 people : a ""chief-nurse"", a psychiatrist and a ""trainer-nurse"".

* You may, thanks to your diploma, have a another test, but I don't know the details, sorry. Found it while writing : http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020961044 Articles 27 à 32. 

* You're going to work 35h per week when you're in school, and same during internships. Here's a schedule for 3 years : http://i.imgur.com/cM9rOUx.jpg (ecole = school / stage = internship / blue : holidays) As you can see, each year is divided in two, making a semester. At the end of each semester / beginning of each, there's midyear exams. You need to validate almost 80% each to pass year. 

When you finis this 3 years in school, you need to a make a memoir, and, voila, you're IDE : Infirmier Diplomé D'Etat. 

I'm sorry if it's confusing; you may find more information at : http://www.infirmiers.com/concours-ifsi/presentation-concours/conditions-acces-au-concours-admission-en-ifsi-concours-infirmier.html 

As a nurse, you are ""under"" the MD. Although, your role is different, more like complementary. MD have a prescription side, as a nurse, you dont. As I like to say : the MD take care of the diseases, the nurses take care of the patient.

There is 3 specialization when you are graduated :
* IADE : Anesthesiologist, kinda the same as EMT (SAMU) and in OR
* IBODE : In OR, well, in the wake-up room.
* Puéricultrice : With the kids, I don't know a lot about that one. 

You can ""specialize"" with some ""Diplomes universitaires"". It's mainly some school time when you work, like 1 week a month, when you learn more about particular things, like pain management, etc etc

When you're in the public hospital, there's a lot a health care providers, like the one you named. Usually, a service is like this : 1 MD / 1 Nurse / 2 Aide Soignantes (or ""Carer"") per 10 patients. A lot of people can gravitate around the patient, like : physiotherapist, occupational therapist, psychologist, assistant social, etc etc...

I think the population have a good view about nurses, we may even be the first profession when it come to trust. The salary isn't that bad, and there's jobs. Not ""a lot"" like 10 or 15 ago, but if you don't mind working in nursing homes, it's not hard finding a stable job.

Frankly, and that's is kinda sad, no. When you're a nurse, you can specialized in the 3 that I've cited, and that's it. France is really late when it come to recognize advanced education.

Hope I've answered all your questions, don't hesitate if you have more.

true,EmpireOfDust,SCOT,Scotland,"&gt;On the case of university, I believe Scottish MPs actually voted to increase tuition fees in England. Citation needed, but I am almost certain that that was the case. 

They did in 2003 when labour introduced variable fees up to 3k. We recognise that on one level it's unfair, but while the Scottish budget is affected by UK laws that don't apply to it I don't see how we can fairly remove ourselves. In 2010 we returned more labour MPs and this time they were voting against.

&gt;An independent Scotland would likely be swarmed with an unstoppable flood of English students wanting free university. 

This is another contentious point. Most of what I'm hearing is that universities have a set number of spaces for Scottish nationals, and then spaces for EU and International students. So in the most likely case we'd only see EU students replaced by English ones.

Alternately, the EU might give Scotland what's called a cultural opt out on that part of the legislation. Denmark for example has an opt out on foreigners owning beach properties, so it isn't unfathomable that Scotland might get one protecting university places.

I think both sides are guilty of it to a degree. BT say RBS is leaving while RBS says it isn't for example, BT say shopping will get higher while tesco say no and lidl and aldi sit there as German companies and still two of the cheapest places to shop.

The previous EU president cast doubt over a speedy entry, the current president says otherwise. The truth is there's no precedent for what's happening, we're fairly integrated with the EU as it is and both entities would have issues if we weren't in the EU. 

The lack of precedent means the EU can decide to do pretty much what it wants. What many people also ignore is we have 1.5 years to negotiate and set up these things before Independence in March 2016. I don't foresee a situation where at least a groundwork isn't there to allow us to operate within the EU while minor details are worked out.

I think Salmond's a fairly good debater, the first debate was poor I admit, but he dismantled Darling in #2. I think that BT made good use of the fact that the UK government refuses to negotiate beforehand to play up the uncertainty of a Yes vote ant Salmond wasn't prepared for it the first time.

Always interesting to debate something important. I started out as a yes voter, was convinced both by the arguments of Yes, which has drawn support from a much more diverse section of society, and what I feel is a lot of scaremongering from BT, who seem to be made up of a much narrower group of society.",0,1410644331,null,0,false,0,ckhgjsv,t3_2gaac9,t1_ckhgjsv,t1_ckhfoer,null,1427027746,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"Not strong at all in the French Basque country. Some townships would be lucky to get over 10% nationalist votes in local elections. 

I think that's due to a few factors which I'll list here :

Firstly, the French Basque country isn't very populated, and is geographically small compared to the Spanish Basque country. The largest city in French Basque country is Bayonne, with some 44,000 people, which makes it the 10th largest Basque city in total (after 9 larger Spanish ones). The second ""large"" French Basque city is Biarritz, with only 25,000 people. It's a famous beach resort. But anyway the rest is very rural. 

Secondly, back in the day France was more effective than Spain in suppressing regional languages including Basque. The language is still understood or spoken by a considerable amount of people though (20% or so). Also, politically, France is very united and centralized (""one nation, indivisible"" is a motto of the Republic), whereas Spain is composed of autonomous or semi-autonomous regions, which makes it a good breeding ground for regionalism. To add to this, France has a lot of regional diversity, like Spain, but despite this every native ethnic group is unconditionally considered part of the greater French culture, whether their region is Germanic (Alsace, or historically Normandy in a way), Celtic (Brittany), Italic-like (Corsica), Catalan, Occitan, Basque and whatnot. We all accept that we're an amalgamation of Gauls, Franks/Germanics, Romans/Italics..etc. I feel Spain works more along the lines of there being ethnic Spaniards, and otherwise the different regional minorities. Whereas in France we don't see it that way. That's why we don't understand that people might say that Alsatians are Germans, or that Charlemagne was German, or Napoleon Italian. We're all of that too in how we perceive our national identity... 

Thirdly, some parts of what's considered the French Basque country are also traditionally part of Gascony (Gascon is a dialect of Occitan, a romance language family present in the southern half of France, which itself can be considered a dialect of French). So the Basques aren't clearly the only ethnicity there. A ""French-like"" ethnicity/culture/identity is also traditionally present in some parts of the Basque area. 

Fourthly the smaller French Basque country is separated from the more actively separatist Spanish country by the border (which admittedly is non-existent since relatively recently because of Schengen) and by the Pyrenees mountain range. So Spanish Basque separatist influence is reduced. 

Still though, the French Basques have a strong identity. With their language of course, music, but also traditional gear, and sports, like running bulls, but also [Basque pelota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_pelota) which is widespread, and incidentally very awesome to watch.

Perceived value - so price and quality are the main factors. I usually go for the best value. Sometimes this is the cheapest item, sometimes it is the most expensive item. Although local produce might be cheaper, this really isn't a reliable indicator - Chinese goods are usually cheaper for example, although I'd never buy a Chinese car.

My opinion of the manufacturer. If I know the product was made by a company with a good reputation (for loads of factors, including workers' rights, environmentalism, product reputation, etc) I'm far more likely to buy it over a competitor. 

Where it was made. I prefer to buy things as locally as I can, but I would never buy an inferior product just because it was made down the street and supported the local economy. I might buy an inferior local product if it is much cheaper, and hence better value, but sometimes local quality might be so poor compared to import quality that no price difference matters. For example, I live in the US right now and I only buy chocolate imported from Europe despite it being as much as 10 times the price of the local varieties!

Il **moderatore** come dice il nome deve avere una reputazione di integrita' e di **moderazione** che non e' compatibile con trolling e flames: non importa la tua padronanza di css e html, se non c'hai la testa **non puoi fare il moderatore** punto.  In fin dei conti e' la discussione e non i banner piu' o meno fighi che fanno il successo di una comunita'.

Conspiracy theorists are people who dismiss all evidence - often conclusive evidence - as falsified by ""them"" in order to support an alternative narrative that has no, or extremely little, evidence to support it.

In other words skepticism is thinking that you've always been told 6 million Jews died in the holocaust but have never seen the evidence for yourself. It only becomes a conspiracy theory once you dismiss the *enormous* numbers of personal accounts, written records and other evidence that support the obvious fact the holocaust happened as being fabricated by the Repitlian zionist Iluminati Freemason CIA.

/u/throwawayritaly, dopo mesi e mesi di downvote a raffica (spesso non motivati, ma proprio per niente), si convince che ci sia un downvoting ring che agisce come influencer filo-PD, manovrando le discussioni e downvotando gli interventi scomodi. La sua ipotesi viene rinforzata dalla scoperta dell'esistenza di /r/300pd, un subreddit privato (il nome ricorda gli ""spartani"" del PD, il fantomatico gruppo che faceva ""evangelizzazione"" in incognito su Internet) che dovrebbe essere il quartier generale del suddetto ring: si scoprirà poi che gli utenti di /r/300pd sono /u/Andreahb, /u/louisbeta e /u/impiegato_statale (più diversi loro throwaway e alt creati per lo scopo, ~~e con l'approvazione di terenzio_collina e badgirlgoneworse~~) e che hanno creato il subreddit effettivamente come ""centrale operativa"" di un tentativo di trolling ai danni di /u/throwawayritaly e del resto di /r/italy.

A un certo punto, /u/throwawayritaly è ormai completamente paranoico su questa faccenda degli influencer filo-PD e, dopo che la stessa combriccola di /r/300pd (nella persona di /u/trova5s, alt di /u/louisbeta) confeziona un'immagine fatta apposta per farlo sbroccare riguardo il contenuto del misterioso sub, contatta gli admin di Reddit, che notano qualcosa che non va e shadowbannano /u/louisbeta. Si scoprirà che il ban è dovuto ad alcuni downvote multipli che /u/louisbeta ha fatto con gli altri suoi account. /u/throwawayritaly la vede come una conferma dei suoi sospetti e decide di lasciare il sub per andare su /r/politicaITA, dove tra l'altro compare /u/throwawaypolita, un alt creato sempre dalla combriccola di 300pd per continuare a perseguitare throwawayrita.

/u/louisbeta, tramite l'alt /u/trova5s, fa ""coming out"" e dice che è stata solo una boutade per vedere chi ci cascava.

/r/300pd viene, per poco tempo, reso pubblico e alcune persone riescono ad archiviarne delle conversazioni per condividerle su /r/italy, chiedendosi tra l'altro perché un neo-mod come /u/Andreahb faccia parte del gruppo di troll di /r/300pd.

But seriously now, that's why I as a ""Fleming"" am ambivalent towards Flemish independence.

I do think most young people today care very little about historical definitions of Flanders, but you'll always have people who want to balkanize the shit out of everything until we only have city states.


But hey. Identity is fluid. I feel Belgian, Flemish, ""Brabantian"" (even though I think few people would call themselves that nowadays), ""Beneluxian"" (lol), European.

Of the three words he suggested at the beginning of the sentence, only ""obwohl"" makes sense. ""Obwohl"" is a subordinating conjunction and means something like ""although"" in English.

However, ""trotzdem"" means ""anyway"" or ""despite this"", which means that it is an adverb. Same thing with ""dennoch"", which means ""nevertheless"".

In order to see how those words don't fit, just try using their English equivalents,

*""Anyway the weather was cold and rainy, I still enjoyed my vacation.""

*""Nevertheless the weather was cold and rainy, I still enjoyed my vacation.""

I was curious about different views of the whole Cyprus issue, and I came across your post.

Consider the official position of the Republic of Cyprus: that the whole island is part of the Republic of Cyprus, with the northern half under military occupation. A number of (some of whom are displaced) Cypriots live in the northern half, nearly all Turkish speakers. As soon as you claim that these particular Cypriots are not in fact subjects of the RoC government (and hence due all rights afforded to any Cypriot national), any RoC claim to the northern half quickly falls apart.

Now about the Turkish occupation, imagine this scenario: the Turkish Armed Forces unilaterally recall all their troops, and give control of the North Cyprus Security Forces along with the Northern Cyprus Police to the TRNC government. Turkey has now left the island. What do you think will be the result of this? I mean, in specific terms, how is this going to achieve anything? Will a reunification be imminent? On what terms will there be a reunification? I'll be curt and just ask what I really want to know: *how is the withdrawal of Turkish forces relevant in any way until there is an actual agreement for reunification?* It seems to me that until reunification has been discussed, any talks of a Turkish withdrawal are rather pointless as there will still be a buffer zone and a working Northern Cypriot government that has been governing for over 30 years.

Thank you for your time.

A Scottish currency would have to be pegged against something to prove itself an actual currency in the eyes of investors and the rest of the world.

The point is that with the RBS already threatening to pull out even though the referendum hasn't actually taken place, the illusion of a potentially-failing economy is created since the largest bank doesn't even want to try issuing a new currency. If not enough support is drummed up behind the currency, then it will fail.

Più in generale, sono molto graditi gli utenti capaci di andare controcorrente. A volte viene proposto un articolo un po' populista, 10 utenti lo prendono per oro colato e inscenano un teatrino di pseudo-indignazione, battute banali e frasi fatte che non aggiungono nulla al pezzo iniziale, poi magari arriva qualcuno in grado di presentare un punto di vista diverso che ti fa cambiare idea e vergognare di essere saltato sul carrozzone senza fermati per ragionare. effetto contrario, quelli che cercano di importare in qualsiasi argomento il loro circlejerk preferito (tipo i grillini che riescono ad infilare un offesa alla Picierno ovunque, o i non grillini che riciclano ki ti paka o gomblotto!1! per ogni occasione)

Non amo i relativisti, quelli per cui siccome non abbiamo ancora risolto il dilemma dell'uovo e della gallina (la gallina), due opinioni discordanti hanno in fondo uguale validità.  

Non amo il terzo polo (le zitelle), quelli che posti davanti ad un'opinione, invece di scegliere se appoggiarla o criticarla (o una sfumatura delle due), si pongono al di fuori del dibattito e criticano il dibattito stesso, o i suoi partecipanti, o banalizzano e travisano forzatamente ciò che viene detto, così poi possono credere di essere il terzo litigante, quello che gode.

You seem to hate the tourists...but it takes a lot of money to support a city like Venice...it's not going to come from the same place it came from in the past...it's time as the merchant/marine centre of the world is long over. It needs tourism, art and culture to support itself now...that means visitors. 

Indeed I do love the place and would hate to see something like an accident with a ship hitting any of the buildings. And you are right, perhaps the ships should bypass the shallow Giudecca when they leave.

Le fait est qu'ils sont bien loin des réalités du terrain. Par exemple sur Le Pontet est-ce qu'ils évoquent la gestion de l'équipe précédente qui a mené à 50 millions d'euros de dette ?

There are exception of course.

Nobody blames them for 'not liking Russians'.

This is a little bit worse than just 'not liking Russians'. You should look up what they did to Russian POWs, it takes the concept of war crime to a whole new level.

Do you want to answer the question? Which jobs shouldn't people do? Also, there is nobody starving in the streets in the UK.

&gt;You might want to look up into work conditions of some jobs, one of those days

Feel free to enlighten me. I've done minimum wage jobs: factory work, cleaning, washing up... I know what those jobs are like.

&gt;yeah if you didn't did the slavery part we don't trust you"". And that's how employers forced employees to go by unpaid ""internship"" (jobs) for months before in france

Doing menial work is not slavery. Someone has to do it.

&gt;Just because life is worse in erithrea or north korea doesn't grant you a pass to make people to live in slums because you employers are too greedy to pay people a living

Actually, it is not just Eritrea and N Korea. People come from all over Europe to do minimum wage work in the UK. Think about that. Anyone in Europe is entitled to work in the UK. Also, people in the UK are paid a living.

&gt;Yes. And rise the minimal wage to livable level. You shouldn't be pocketing their lifespan of work without giving them enough to survive correctly in exchange. And that include not being late on day to day bills like the rent, power or food.

Su internet, in particolare 4chan, reddit e posti simili, si dice che un utente ""delivera"" quando consegna un particolare elemento da lui promesso antecedentemente.

Per esempio, nel caso specifico /u/raciard aveva promesso di postare una sua foto nel caso in cui /u/trova5s ovvero /u/louisbeta, avesse provato tramite screenshot che il subreddit /r/300pd non fosse vuoto ma effettivamente utilizzato.

/u/trova5s ha effettivamente postato uno screenshot, e quindi /u/raciard per mantenere la promessa, ha postato la foto precedentemente promessa.

Nell'accadere di questo evento, gli utenti di solito in modo goliardico definiscono il caso come: ""il momento in cui op ha deliverato"". 

Se op non avesse deliverato, si sarebbe ricorso al classico meme di internet dove ""OP is a fag"".

But! For example South Park and The Simpsons dubbed in Czech are often better with dubbing than they are in the original. You can lose some joke, if it's play on words, but on the other hand they will dub-in some new jokes.

Example: 

Original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLVbZHeQdnI

Czech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxz3F9uUr-Y (don't mind the silly head, couldn't find a better version)

Rough translation of the Czech version:

*I like you like sirloin (the meat), love*

*I like you like pork,*

*I will give you the best love, beauty*

In Czech its very funny.

Another example is Louis de Funes, who has said that his Czech dubbing actor dubbed him better than he himself ever could.

* [Moldovan counter-intelligence found recruiters who were looking for people for Transistria](http://www.moldova.org/counter-intelligence-services-found-russian-recruiters-in-southern-moldova/) - it look like Kremlin want to open western front in Ukraine - and/or eastern front in Moldova;

true,TheMadFleming,FLAN,Flanders,"&gt;Hey man; we ""Brabantians"" already have to put up with being called ""Flemings"" and having that silly flag shoved down our throats

It were not people from West- and East-Flanders who shoved it down your throats though. We're not like those Hollanders. It were other ""Brabantians"" who did that, a lot of the main figures of the Flemish movement came from Antwerp. They took up the Flemish identity themselves and it's not hard to see why they did that.

With the county of Flanders its turbulent history with France and of course 1302. Flanders after all is the only medieval French region that isn't part of modern France (except for Dunkirk and surroundings), quit a feat. So you got the anti-French element in Flemish history, perfect for a struggle against the French-speaking elite of Belgium at the time.

Meanwhile Brabant is the most fractured Dutch region, spread over 5 provinces (North-Brabant/Antwerp/Flemish-Brabant/Brussels/Walloon-Brabant), 2 countries of 3 different regions in Belgium. That's probably the reason why they no longer identify as Brabants in Antwerp.

But by all means you can identify as Flemish, the Italians in the medieval city states already called both Flemings and Brabantians fiamminghi. Culturally both regions were pretty much the same anyway, except for the dialects. 

It's just that Antwerp (the city) takes it way too far, they're acting like they speak the real Flemish (while it's a Brabantian dialect through and through) and like they are the centerpoint of Flemish culture. ""Hol van de Leeuw"" and self-proclaimed capital of Flanders. It's like they are hijacking the name.

If you see the chart, the countries which don't dubt the films are also the countries which language is not as spread. Germany, France, Spain or Italy are examples. The only weird case is Portugal. I don't know if it is so easy to distinguish if the egg came before the chicken.


Also, you do not learn by watching a film with subtitles in your language, which is the case in most of the non-dub countries. I live in Germany at the moment, and if I watch a firlm in original version, the theather always uses german subtitles. Either the subtitles are in the original language or you watch the film without subtitles, for otherwise you are just reading. In Spain, the most common way of watching online shows is with subtitles and you could say that, if not with learning purpose, nobody is learning anything out of them.

I do speak a bit of japanese and watching anime with spanish subtitles is not helping me to improve my skills. I have to watch it without subtitles or with japanese subs.

Another EDIT: If you see the case of Germany, they have dub for everything. Almost every theather is in German. Yet, they usually have a higher English proficiency than Spaniards or Portugueses (who only use sub), for they have a better educational system.

And even now with the visible change in the politics there are so many people saying the numbers are wrong its too simplistic etc. I'm very worried where will we be in 5 years. I despise nationalism. But at the same time I start seeing that right wing has been better than the left at predicting Europe's problems.
Right wing is rising to power and if we don't do something semi-radical with immigration now they will do radical in the future. ",0,1410689767,null,0,false,0,ckhveil,t3_2gcvkr,t1_ckhveil,t1_ckhv5oc,null,1427019887,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,veniceisntdisneyland,null,null,"I am not saying all tourists are stupid, and I am not oblivious to the fact that Venice depends on tourism (alas) to survive. What I wanted to say is that tourists that come to Venice *on cruise ships* are accomplices in crime in the destruction of the city. I can tell you that any Venetian has absolutely *no sympathy whatsoever* (or extremely little) for cruise ship tourists; hence the hostile tone of my previous comment.
The best metaphor of the typical cruise ship tourist I could come up with is that of an overweight woman forcefully trying to fit in a pair of trousers which is three sizes too small; ""oh, but I love this pair of trousers!"" she says while ripping the fabric all over. Cruise ships are incompatible with Venice (no matter the intentions of the people on board) and have to be eliminated as soon as possible: they'll either destroy the city or destroy themselves 'Giglio-style'...

I am not advocating against *all* tourism in Venice (even though...), just do not come on board of a cruise ship! A tourist that is genuinely interested in the city, eats at local restaurants/bars, is friendly and amiable, visits museums, churches, and exhibitions, **is welcome**! On the other hand, a tourist that comes from a cruise-ship, buys Louis-Vitton knockoffs from peddlers near the Ferrovia (illegal), feeds the pigeons in San Marco (not allowed), eats at Burger Kings, and buys the 'authentic' Murano stained-glass crap they sell in almost every shop in the city, is genuinely despised by anyone living in Venice.

I hope you did not know the extent of the damage cruise-ships do to Venice when you first decided to book your trip. I also hope awareness about the problem could be raise on an international context (and not only locally) so that tourists could visit the city in a way that does not permanently destroy it.

true,Puzzles21,UKGB,European Federalist - UK,"To adress the university point, Denmark recently introduced a system where they charged people for university. This allowed them to charge EU nationals to come to Danish universities. What they then did was give grants to Danish nationals who wanted to go to University. The EU jumped in and shut this down almost instantly. What it looks like at the moment is that Scotland will be allowed cultural opt outs, perhaps on EU nationals living in the Shetlands and such, but universities might have a bit of an issue. 

On the EU. It has been made very clear that Scotland would be given a completely fair chance to join the EU. That's completely fair. However, José Barroso, the former PEC, backed up by Juncker said that they would have to fully reapply to join the EU. Which is fine, Scotland meets all of the requirements. 

Where the issue comes is from Spain, Belgium, France the the Kingdom of England. Catalan independence has surged, and Spain will look to stop that. Flanders wants to be independent, and Belgium will fight to stop it. I'm not saying they will directly veto it, I couldn't predict that, but they will certainly fight to stop Scotland having special opt outs.

It's also very unlikely that Scotland would have the Opt outs that Britain enjoys, due to them having to fully reapply. This isn't a problem, most European nations handle pretty well without them. However, at the moment, we enjoy opt outs on the fishing industry, which Scotland may not get. We've opted out of Schengen, and very important to this campaign, the Euro. Which brings me on to my next point.

To join the EU, Scotland as an independent country, will lack one thing. Alex Salmond has become so hooked on a currency union, he has forgotten something. To join the EU, a country *needs* to have a central bank. If there is a currency union, Scotland will not have one. This could lead to them having to adopt the ECB as their central bank, and they could be left with the decision. Adopt the Euro, or do not join. 

Thanks for you being so cordial and answering, nice to see that on reddit. I'm not Anti-Yes, I've just got to support the side which has answers to questions. While I believe No might have gone in with the scaremongering, Salmond just didn't answer questions. He legitimately does not have a Plan B for anything. He is assuming everything will be perfect, which doesn't happen in the real world. I am scared for Scotland, because that could be a disaster.

true,parameters,UKGB,United Kingdom,"If anyone is wondering why a news website from the other side of the planet has decided to post an article talking about anti-immigrant sentiment specifically in Sweden (though yes, Sweden's election is right now), without mentioning it is a Europe-wide issue. It is probably because of a child abuse case in Sweden, where Malaysian parents were arrested and prosecuted.

The OPs source, The Malay Mail Online, is actually one of the better Malaysian news websites, [here you can see an article from the Malay Mail Online, which tries to inform its readers that in this case, there is reasonable evidence of child abuse to justify a trial](http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/three-things-about-the-alleged-malaysian-child-abuse-case-in-sweden). Smacking and caning for disciplining children is normal in Malaysia, and there was a wide assumption in that country by those who heard about this case, that it was a simply a ""clash of culture"". In much of the Malaysian media, the reporting of how the case was handled, like the [fostering of the children](http://english.astroawani.com/news/show/more-than-300-000-children-forcefully-separated-in-sweden-28648) caused outrage in some in Malaysia, and suspicions that racism played a part in how the family was treated. 

Therefore, an article about rising anti-immigrant sentiment in Sweden is likely to be of interest to Malaysian readers (clickbait title). ",0,1410690786,null,0,1410702465,0,ckhvkac,t3_2gcvkr,t1_ckhvkac,t3_2gcvkr,null,1427019812,55,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,55

Take Scrubs, or the Simpsons. I love to watch them in both languages. Some puns might get lost, but on other instances there might be new ones. It's just a matter of attitude of those who work on it. If they do a shitty job then of course its bad, just like it would be with crappy acting.

My two biggest gripes on German Dubs are 

* the lack of black voice actors. Those who have a certain blues in their voices, which is just awesome in the original version. I really like Donald Faison's voice. And that Sebastian Schulz does the voice for him, just as he does it for Howard from TBBT, says it all.

* the lack of accents. I don't know why it is like this, but on German TV lays an embargo for pluralistic language. Game of Thrones became really cringe worthy because of this. Those many accents are what made this series more interesting in the first place, but even German Oberyn Martell doesn't have a Latino accent. And let's not forget that even the hound speaks pretty swollen for a grunt. I know, making them speak Bavarian wouldn't suit, but this forced language is a deal breaker. Especially the fact that almost everyone has to be referred to as ""Sie"" instead of ""du"". Made Stargate: Atlantis pretty cringey at some parts. You know, people that travel to other planets, risking their lives and so on, but a civilian still refers to his (military or extra terrestrial) colleague and friend as ""Sie""... 

Also I still laugh every time I see this episode with the silicon based life form. They translated it with ""Silikon"" and not ""Silizium"". I just wonder why they fucked up with Atlantis, when SG-1 and Universe were made this good.

Also I have to admit that I like House MD more in the German version than the original; maybe because I honestly think that Klebsch's voice suits him better than Laurie's own or because I'm just too used to it.

So yeah, there are crappy dubs done, but you can't just switch to stubborn and claim everything is shit. It's just don't fair to not even appreciate the work these people have done and not giving any chance. You can condemn dubs of a certain movie/TV show, but not every dub because of some lazy translations you may have encountered.


&gt; Even if a film is in a language I don't understand a single word of, I'll take subtitles instead of a dub any day!

And what would you achieve with this, if I may ask? Subtitles are in the same language as dubs would be, hence have the same amount of plays on words and general finesse within the original language lost. All they do is distracting you from the actor's and director's work by forcing you to read some text on the edge of the screen. Which also just destroys either visual gags and visual plot points and foreshadowing in the background.

Russia has a lot of people with ""a degree"", but the quality of those degrees is closer to - attend lectures, pay money and participate in exams&amp;n stuff, congratz you have a degree. 


Of course the fact that almost every single job requires ""a degree"" (корочка) by HR is not helping either . 


Naturally a lot of people who attend high quality uni's have a tendency to leave the country or concentrate around Moscow/St.Petersburg. 


All in all its a pretty poor and outdated system, which requires reforms, but in nowadays Russia no one is really interested in investing in quality education.  Even if you do, there is a very good chance that the person who will get one will try to leave for ""greener pastures"" :)

No, perchè sembra che non si sia capito...

Andreahb e impiegato statale (che come sapete non si chiamano andrea nè sono impiegati nel settore pubblico) ed io, che siamo tutta gente tranquilla, operosa e che nel tempo libero organizza burle, scherzi, etc...abbiamo fatto un semplice **scherzo**.

Ora, voi la chiamate trollata, e sembra tutta una cosa brutta e noiosa, mentre una cosa noiosa sapete cos'è? Un gruppo di persone che si offende tutta perchè si fanno scherzi. E che va a cercare di smascherare chissà quale complotto ai danni del karma di qualcuno.

Ma era tutto uno scherzo da Rifondazone Comunista, che comunque, come avevate letto, eravamo pronti a svelare per lollare tutti insieme, anche quelli che ora si siedono in pizzo e sparano giudizi. Sinceramente, **sono stupito**.  Stupito, perchè non capisco il senso di  questo accanimento su quello che era un semplice gioco. 

Un gioco privato, con conversazioni private tra persone che, privatamente, sparano giudizi e scambiano opinioni. Incredibile?

Mi stupisce se mai che qualcuno vada a stampare log di conversazioni cancellate. E mi sa un po' di paranoichetto fissatello.

Ehi raga, eravate anche VOI a downvotare throwaway (anche se tutti diciamo ""*no, io non lo votavo basso*""), come me, quando partiva per la tangente della cospirazione.

I experience the original actors' performance. Their emotion, their nuance, their inflection, their timing and a million subtleties that inform a character but get lost in dubbing. I also really like getting a feeling of another culture's language and way of speaking. Watching a Chinese film in Chinese opens you up to a very different experience compared to watching it dubbed.

Language is not only about information transfer through words you understand, it also communicates culture, character and emotion - much of which can be understood even if you don't understand the language. With subtitles to fill the gap in understanding I think one is far better off than with watching a dub. And I disagree with you here - to me subtitles don't distract me from the imagery nearly as much as you claim.

Ogni settimana

&gt; E i vetri delle finestre?

Ogni settimana, tranne la cucina che viene lavata ogni altro giorno circa

&gt; Quante volte a settimana passate l'aspirapolvere?

Ogni altro giorno

&gt; Quante volte a settimana lavate i pavimenti della casa? Date anche la cera?

Ogni altro giorno (credo vada alternato all'aspirapolvere? Non ci ho mai fatto caso)

&gt; Lavate il bagno tutti i giorni da cima o fondo?

Il bagno da cima a fondo 2 volte a settimana, ma ogni giorno viene comunque pulito (rimozione capelli, peli morti)

&gt; Ogni quanto cambiate le lenzuola e le federe?

Lenzuola: ogni settimana. Federe: 2 volte a settimana

&gt; Mandate almeno una volta all'anno in tintoria le fodere che coprono i divani?

No, ma penso ogni tipo mese usi il suo prodotto apposito

&gt; Ogni quanto pulite il terrazzo o il balcone?

Quando si sporca, diciamo che non c'è la necessità di tenerlo immacolato

&gt; Avete tappeti in casa? Li battete sul balcone? Lo fate negli orari consentiti o ve ne fregate? Magari sbattete pure le tovaglie piene di briciole?(se lo fate non vergognatevi e ditelo)

Qui non ci sono orari consentiti, i tappeti non vengono sbattuti ma lavati ogni settimana (inizi a vedere un pattern?), poi messi a stendere fuori. I tappeti in carpet in camera dei miei vengono lavati meno spesso ma in lavanderia.

&gt; La lavatrice e la lavastovglie le fate andare anche di giorno o solo negli orari in cui costa di meno?

Di notte, abbiamo preso quelle silenziose e con timer apposta. L'asciugatrice per forza di cose va di pomeriggio

&gt; Quali attrezzi utilizzate per pulire? Avete il vaporetto? Avete il roomba o qualche aspirapolvere particolare?

Solo aspirapolvere (Miele se ti interessa, consigliata pure dal tizio dell'AMA)

&gt; Si forma molta polvere in casa vostra? 

No, per niente. Anche perché soffriamo tutti d'asma.

&gt; Per pulire i mobili usate un semplice panno umido oppure dei prodotti spray?

Principalmente il piumino swiffer. Non per le superfici della cucina e del bagno anche uno spray igienizzante

&gt; In casa sui mobili avete molti oggettini tipo vasi, robe di cristallo, oppure tenete tutto libero per rendere le pulizie più semplici e più rapide?

Si, molti soprammobili. 

&gt; Ogni quanto togliete tutti i libri dalle vostre librerie per dare una pulita e spolverarli?

Mai, abbiamo una stanza adibita a libreria però, quindi anche se è polverosa non è un problema

&gt; Usate candele profumate o prodotti simili?

No (sempre per l'asma)

&gt; Per chi vive all'estero: dite il paese dove vi trovate e se avete notato se lì le case vengono tenute con maggiore ordine o pulizia. Oppure è il contrario. E se fanno cose particolari che qui in Italia non ci sogneremmo mai.

Inghilterra: hanno sta mania del carpet e non mi sembra lo puliscano poi così bene. I bagni sono di una tristezza incredibile. Meglio l'Italia IMHO. (Poi magari è perché in Italia vedo case di un certo tipo, qui altre)

**EDIT**: questo come viene gestito a casa dei miei. Nel mio appartamento è molto più semplice vista la dimensione ridotta. Pulire tutto porta via si e no 2 ore.

&gt; EDIT: i panni d'inverno dove li stendete? Avete una stanza apposta? Oppure usate l'asciugatrice? Oppure ve ne fregate e li mettete sul balcone anche d'inverno? E chi ha il balcone e una casa piccola come si arrangia?

Sia in estate che d'inverno in asciugatrice. I panni ingombranti (tipo lenzuola, tappeti) sono stesi in giardino fuori in estate, se no nella lavanderia in inverno.

&gt; EDIT2: Per chi ha la donna delle pulizie: ogni quanto fa le pulizie, quali mansioni svolge (tipo: non stira) e quanto costa? Lavora in nero? (be' a questa rispondete se volete)

Ogni giorno, dalle 3 alle 7:30 da circa 30 anni. Fa tutti i lavori della ""donna di casa"", per cui per esempio ci fa anche torte e ogni sera cucina la cena. Fa anche un ottimo ragù e delle ottime tagliatelle!

true,votapmen,SRPS,Република Српска — Republika Srpska,"&gt;But is counting the number of university degree holders an accurate description how of educated a country is? Is degree == culture, intelligence? 

No.

For example, Bosnia is increasingly becoming home to [diploma mills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploma_mill).

In January this year, a ""European University"" in Brčko was closed. One of the professors there taught 70 ~~classes~~ **courses**, and another ""only"" 56. [[link (sr)]](http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Drustvo/437889/Univerzitet-u-Brckom-Jedan-profesor-predavao-70-drugi-56-predmeta)

The University claimed to be ""internationally recognized and accredited"", but it turned out it was accredited by an [accreditation mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accreditation_mill).

Besides such problems in private universities, there are problems with corruption in state universities, albeit to a smaller extent.

This basically means that a diploma from a private university in Bosnia is absolutely no guarantee of your competence and education, and a diploma of a state university is a somewhat stronger guarantee, but still a weak one.

**EDIT**: I changed ""classes"" to ""courses"". I'm not sure what the proper term in English is, but by course I mean different subjects (e.g. math, science, etc.).",0,1410693960,null,0,1410694418,0,ckhw2tb,t3_2gc8la,t1_ckhw2tb,t1_ckhs72m,null,1427019572,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Nel parcheggio (pubblico) davanti al club i valletti impediscono di parcheggiare a qualunque nero ci provi, dicendo che ""i posti servono a noi"". Non è discriminazione, del resto i posti sono riservati (abusivamente) agli iscritti al club ed è solo una coincidenza (correlazione ≠ causalità!) che siano tutti bianchi.

Ehm...

&gt;Quante volte a settimana passate l'aspirapolvere?

Solo quando serve, altrimenti ci pensa la mia polacca di fiducia (che chiamo Signora Pulziewska).

&gt;Quante volte a settimana lavate i pavimenti della casa? Date anche la cera?

Le scarpe, in casa mia, sono vietatissime per chi si ferma a dormire: ho una bella collezione di ciabatte dell'Ikea, in tutte le misure.

Dovrei comprare le pattine per chi è di passaggio, ma non voglio passare per ossessivo. Però vedere le scarpe in casa, davvero, mi irrita moltissimo.

Questo comporta che i pavimenti siano tendenzialmente puliti, a parte quello in zona cucina: do una passata ogni due giorni, salvo incidenti di percorso.

Cera no, perché è laminato + moquette nelle stanze.

&gt;Lavate il bagno tutti i giorni da cima o fondo?

Dovrei?

&gt;Ogni quanto cambiate le lenzuola e le federe?

Salvo sudate, una volta la settimana.

&gt;Mandate almeno una volta all'anno in tintoria le fodere che coprono i divani?

Pelle!

&gt;Ogni quanto pulite il terrazzo o il balcone?

Ho parecchie piante, sul terrazzo, quindi passo fuori circa una mezz'ora ogni giorno. Sistemo quelle, do una pulita al tavolo ed alle sedie se li uso o se sono particolarmente lerci. A fine mese, coprirò con l'apossito telo e ci rivediamo ad aprile.


&gt;Avete tappeti in casa? Li battete sul balcone? Lo fate negli orari consentiti o ve ne fregate? Magari sbattete pure le tovaglie piene di briciole?(se lo fate non vergognatevi e ditelo)

Ho un solo tappeto ed uso l'aspirapolvere. Cioè, lo usa la Signora Puliziewska. Non uso tovaglie ma tovagliette dell'Ika, perché sono troppo pigro per gestile una tovaglia.

&gt;La lavatrice e la lavastovglie le fate andare anche di giorno o solo negli orari in cui costa di meno?

Qua costa sempre uguale, quindi faccio andare entrambe quando serve.

&gt;Quali attrezzi utilizzate per pulire? Avete il vaporetto? Avete il roomba o qualche aspirapolvere particolare?

Aspirapolvere, mocio. In Italia ho un Kirby che m'è arrivato gratis, devo ancora decidere se portarlo su o rivenderlo.

&gt;Si forma molta polvere in casa vostra? Per pulire i mobili usate un semplice panno umido oppure dei prodotti spray?

Poca polvere. Per i mobili c'è il Pronto! Che qui si chiama Pledge, ma è sempre lui.

&gt;In casa sui mobili avete molti oggettini tipo vasi, robe di cristallo, oppure tenete tutto libero per rendere le pulizie più semplici e più rapide?

Odio i soprammobili, in ligure si chiamano ""campa pue"" (raccogli-polvere, letteralmente). Ho letterlamente quattro cose esposte: un peluche di Totoro, un daruma, un set da sake comprato all'aeroporto di Tokyo ed una pianta che mi ha regalato la mamma.

&gt;Ogni quanto togliete tutti i libri dalle vostre librerie per dare una pulita e spolverarli?

I miei libri sono rimasti in Italia :(

&gt;Usate candele profumate o prodotti simili?

Solo nel bagno piccolo, visto che non ha finestre.

&gt;Per chi vive all'estero: dite il paese dove vi trovate e se avete notato se lì le case vengono tenute con maggiore ordine o pulizia. Oppure è il contrario. E se fanno cose particolari che qui in Italia non ci sogneremmo mai.

Paesi Bassi e sì, c'è generalmente più ordine e cura: ogni casa ha almeno un finestrone enorme, dal quale si può vedere l'interno dell'alloggio. Per forza di cose, deve essere in ordine.

Se vi viene in mente altro o consigli per la casa dite pure.
&gt;
EDIT: i panni d'inverno dove li stendete? Avete una stanza apposta? Oppure usate l'asciugatrice? Oppure ve ne fregate e li mettete sul balcone anche d'inverno? E chi ha il balcone e una casa piccola come si arrangia?

Ascigatrice, qui è praticamente una scelta obbligata: troppo poco sole, in inverno.

&gt;EDIT2: Per chi ha la donna delle pulizie: ogni quanto fa le pulizie, quali mansioni svolge (tipo: non stira) e quanto costa? Lavora in nero? (be' a questa rispondete se volete)

* Una volta la settimana

* Non stira, non mette in ordine (mica è una serva, a quello ci penso io)

* 12€/ora

I speak of the over-representation of the Jew in the politics, economics, and media of every western nation. This would be no problem if they were not of such ideological homogeneity that has led to the majority of the worst problems within our respective nations. Do you not believe me? Observe the mass immigration from third world countries that creates tension in so many aspects of life, such as the burden this has placed on our economies, the racial/ethnic tensions that divide the society, the crumbling of our traditional values, the policies that are enacted on these immigrants' behalf (and subsequent channeling of funds), and the acceptance and tolerance of these aliens that are expected of us, lest we be labeled as ""racists."" And this is far from being an exhaustive list of the impact of Jewish presence. This is not to say it is all their doing. Those citizens and leaders who participated in parallel with the Jews deserve no exemption of fault. Many have been brainwashed and deceived by this mass propagation of ideological doctrine that has, over the last century, gained acceptance and prominence in our cultures. Only by disguising the message and packaging its sociopolitical products as benevolence were the Jews' capable of inoculating our populations with their covertly insidious dogma.

Date queste premesse e visto che abito con i miei, mi occupo poco delle pulizie e non so di preciso i tempi, comunque:

Laviamo le tende una volta all'anno così come le serrande, i vetri credo una volta ogni uno o due mesi. 

L'aspirapolvere viene passata almeno due volte a settimana, contemporaneamente vengono lavati i pavimenti. Mai usata la cera. Anche il bagno viene lavato due volte a settimana. 
Per cambiare le lenzuola aspetto quindici giorni, magari le federe le tengo per una sola settimana. 

I copridivani lì laviamo a casa, tappeti e tovaglie le battiamo quando ci pare stando in una villetta indipendente. 

Non ci preoccupiamo molto degli orari per lavatrice e lavastoviglie, quando serve si fanno andare. Anche perché generalmente dobbiamo fare tre o quattro lavatrici tutte insieme quindi è impossibile farle in orari particolari. 

Come attrezzatura abbiamo l'aspirapolvere, niente di più tecnologico. 

Purtroppo i mobili sono pieni di cianfrusaglie, di solito si spolverano con un panno e un prodotto per il legno. Niente candele profumate nè altri prodotti per profumare. 

D'estate stendiamo i panni in balcone, ne abbiamo uno per ogni lato della casa quindi c'è sempre un lato al sole. Se c'è bel tempo li stendiamo lì anche d'inverno, se invece piove o fa troppo freddo abbiamo un paio di stendibiancheria  nella ""zona panni"" all'ultimo piano. 

La donna delle pulizie fa circa 8 ore a settimana come dicevo, ha un contratto regolare con ferie etc. Mi sembra che il compenso lordo sia intorno ai 9€ l'ora. Lei si occupa di ogni tipo di pulizia, però non tocca assolutamente i panni. Non stira e non mi risulta che li abbia mai neanche stesi.

This means the average person rapes 0.00033530421 children in one year. This means that statistically (and unrealistically) one in 3000 people will sexually attack a child attack per year.

To divide the total number of rapes in the Rotherham scandal (1,400) by the number of men (5) over the number of years (16) we get this:

(1,400/5)/16= 17.5 children per year per person.

17.5/0.00033530421= 52191.4

So each person in the Rotherham rape gang committed **52091.4%** more sexual attacks on children in one year, than the average UK Citizen.

* Michel Sapin (Finance Minister) announced that France was going to [miss its deficit target; also lowered growth projections](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-29141416). In other news, nobody is really surprised.

**Politics**

* [Nicolas Sarkozy has announced that he will be candidate to become the new president of the UMP](http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/nicolas-sarkozy-les-coulisses-de-son-retour-12-09-2014-4128477.php), which he wants to ""change"" (change the name, change the bureau, change the image... change everything, who said like they did with the RPR that became UMP?). Nobody is doubting that he also wants to be a candidate in the next presidential elections. Some are comparing him to Berlusconi in a ""he needs to win if he doesn't want to go to jail"" way.
* [Martine Aubry seems to want to make a come-back on the national politics scene](http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2014/09/13/les-militants-socialistes-du-nord-souhaitent-le-retour-de-martine-aubry-au-premier-plan_4487146_823448.html). She has repeatedly said that she wanted to offer her ideas to the Prime Minister, and criticized the government's chosen way (too much to the right for her, and, admittedly, many socialist sympathizers). She has been Minister of Labor and Minister of Labor and Solidarity in the past, notably one of the architects of the 35h workweek, and is more on the left of the Socialist Party.
* [On September, 16th, the Parliament is supposed to vote, or not, the trust in the government](http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2014/09/09/vote-de-confiance-vers-une-abstention-collective-des-frondeurs_4484361_823448.html). At least one socialist deputy has already said that he won't vote ""yes"", while the ""frondeurs"" (deputies who are not satisfied with the government politics, which they find to be too much to the right) will probably abstain. The trust is a matter of tradition rather than obligation, but the consequences of a failure on the 16th are still unclear.
* Pierre Moscovici, the previous Finance Minister, [has been nominated to a key portfolio (EU economics policy) of the European Commission](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29139503). Reactions have been mixed.

**~~Politics~~ Justice**

* Thomas Thevenoud, Secretary of External Trade, has been resigned from his post in the governement after the fact that he hadn't been paying his taxes for the last three years was discovered by the (all new and apparently useful) High Autority for Transparency in Public Life (who would have thought). Since, we also learnt that he didn't like to pay his rent either, among several other things. Another issue: [people who have resigned from the governement may eventually return to their post of deputy, which he has done, when pretty much everyone wants him gone](http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/pour-cambadelis-thomas-thevenoud-demissionnera-de-son-siege-de-depute-12-09-2014-4129761.php).

It's an issue of image for the ""we're not corrupted like the others"" Front National, which had the same problems with its mayors in 1995.
* New reports and investigations seem to accredit the fact that the settlement of 405M€ granted in June 2008 to Bernard Tapie was the result of, basically, [cooked books and *understandings* between friends](http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2014/09/11/tapie-n-a-pas-ete-lese-dans-la-vente-d-adidas-en-1993_4485812_3224.html).

There are plenty of billionaires like Jeff Bezos who openly admit if things keep going their heads will be on a plate and for good reason.

&gt;The most ironic thing about rising inequality is how completely unnecessary and self-defeating it is. If we do something about it, if we adjust our policies in the way that, say, Franklin D. Roosevelt did during the Great Depression—so that we help the 99 percent and preempt the revolutionaries and crazies, the ones with the pitchforks—that will be the best thing possible for us rich folks, too. It’s not just that we’ll escape with our lives; it’s that we’ll most certainly get even richer.

---

&gt;__Blue Zone__ is a concept used to identify a demographic and/or geographic area of the world where people live measurably longer lives. The concept grew out of demographic work done by Gianni Pes and Michel Poulain,  who identified [Sardinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia)'s [Nuoro province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuoro_province) as the region with the highest concentration of male [centenarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centenarian). As the two men zeroed in on the cluster of villages with the highest longevity, they drew concentric blue circles on the map and began referring to the area inside the circle as the Blue Zone. [Dan Buettner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Buettner) identifies longevity hotspots in [Okinawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawa_Prefecture) ([Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan)); [Sardinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia) ([Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy)); [Nicoya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicoya,_Costa_Rica) ([Costa Rica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica)); [Icaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icaria,_Greece) ([Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece));and among the [Seventh-day Adventists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church) in [Loma Linda, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loma_Linda,_California), and offers an explanation, based on empirical data and first hand observations, as to why these populations live healthier and longer lives.

&gt; Quante volte a settimana passate l'aspirapolvere?

Una, più una volta il robottino aspirapolvere (Samsung).

&gt; Quante volte a settimana lavate i pavimenti della casa? Date anche la cera?

Una, il parquet con detergente apposito.

&gt; Lavate il bagno tutti i giorni da cima o fondo?

No, i sanitari una volta alla settimana, il pavimento dipende (abbiamo due bagni e ne usiamo più o meno uno, quindi a volte il pavimento anche solo ogni due settimane).

&gt; Ogni quanto cambiate le lenzuola e le federe?

Una settimana il bambino, due gli adulti.

&gt; Mandate almeno una volta all'anno in tintoria le fodere che coprono i divani?

Sono di pelle, li laviamo ogni due mesi circa.

&gt; Ogni quanto pulite il terrazzo o il balcone?

I balconi praticamente mai, il vialetto di ingresso tre-quattro volte l'anno.

&gt; Avete tappeti in casa? Li battete sul balcone? Lo fate negli orari consentiti o ve ne fregate? Magari sbattete pure le tovaglie piene di briciole?(se lo fate non vergognatevi e ditelo)

Sì, ma i balconi danno sul giardino.

&gt; La lavatrice e la lavastovglie le fate andare anche di giorno o solo negli orari in cui costa di meno?

Più o meno sempre di notte, ma più per comodità che per risparmio.

&gt; Quali attrezzi utilizzate per pulire? Avete il vaporetto? Avete il roomba o qualche aspirapolvere particolare?

Il robottino suddetto.

&gt; Si forma molta polvere in casa vostra? Per pulire i mobili usate un semplice panno umido oppure dei prodotti spray?

Panno umido, o panno antistatico a seconda delle superfici.

&gt; In casa sui mobili avete molti oggettini tipo vasi, robe di cristallo, oppure tenete tutto libero per rendere le pulizie più semplici e più rapide?

Tremila foto.

&gt; Ogni quanto togliete tutti i libri dalle vostre librerie per dare una pulita e spolverarli?

Mai perché le librerie sono a vetro.

&gt; Usate candele profumate o prodotti simili?

No.

&gt; Per chi vive all'estero: dite il paese dove vi trovate e se avete notato se lì le case vengono tenute con maggiore ordine o pulizia. Oppure è il contrario. E se fanno cose particolari che qui in Italia non ci sogneremmo mai.

Quand'ero in Repubblica Ceca, i bambini a scuola mettevano le ciabatte, e anche gli operai che ti venivano a fare i lavori in casa se le portavano dietro.

&gt; EDIT: i panni d'inverno dove li stendete? Avete una stanza apposta? Oppure usate l'asciugatrice? Oppure ve ne fregate e li mettete sul balcone anche d'inverno? E chi non ha il balcone e una casa piccola come si arrangia?

Il tuo post, per me, è un esempio di risposta a sé stesso (speriamo di non andare in stack overflow ;-)

Provo a rispondere. Nel mio mondo ideale, ciascuno si impegna nella sua vita personale e professionale. Questo è molto diverso dall'essere perfetti - è come ripassare ogni giorno i propri esercizi con attenzione, aggiungendo minimi dettagli di pulizia ed armonia con ogni esecuzione, in modo che il passare dei mesi e degli anni porti cambiamento e crescita.

Chiedo perdono per l'apertura sospettosamente simile ad un pippone, ma sto cercando di descrivere un modo di vivere i rapporti che ho impiegato una vita a sviluppare e rendere concreto. 

Che sia chiaro, non mi permetto di proporre me stesso come modello di atteggiamento - trovo ridicolo chi si racconta all'esterno come impeccabile - ma piuttosto di dire come cerco di essere e cosa mi aspetto.

Vorrei che si aprisse una discussione perché la si ritiene interessante per tutti. Vorrei che, se un intervento o un contributo non ci interessano, ci limitassimo a non intervenire: non è necessario essere sarcastici o sgradevoli, e se abbiamo la percezione che l'interlocutore è limitato nelle capacità o nel sapere o nell'esperienza, possiamo provare ad immedesimarci, a ricordare quelle volte in cui è capitato a noi di essere gli ignoranti o gli stupidi di qualcun altro. Vorrei che la soddisfazione ed il piacere di una battuta spiritosa e salace non ci arrivassero mai a costo dell'umiliazione o del disagio di un'altra persona. Anche perché nel momento in cui compiamo un atto di sopraffazione, sporchiamo noi stessi e rinforziamo l'atteggiamento che non ci sta bene nell'altro, perché ne facciamo una questione di autodifesa. Il che significa che, se non abbiamo un pulsante per sterminare istantaneamente tutti coloro che riteniamo dei cretini (e nessun dubbio sull'opportunità e sul nostro diritto di farlo), ci conviene provare a capire le ragioni dell'altro: esercizio interessante che ci permette di uscire dal comodo recinto delle nostre convinzioni, e trovare il modo di trasmettere qualcosa del nostro pensiero ad una persona che è disposta a capire - perché l'intenzione di capirsi è contagiosa.

Chi abbia avuto la pazienza di leggere l'intero text wall finora, penserà che io stia sponsorizzando la bontà e la comprensione incondizionate nelle discussioni, ma non è così. Ritengo infatti che i bulli ed i manipolatori vadano tenuti a distanza: per un problema di ecologia dei rapporti e della comunicazione, chi ha capacità e strumenti ma, per una sua distorsione emotiva, trae piacere dal creare problemi agli altri, deve a) stare fuori dalle palle, e b), se ne ha voglia, curarsi.

Circa un anno fa ho iniziato a lurkare e, sporadicamente, postare e commentare su /r/italy perché mi attizzava il livello intellettuale e culturale nettamente più alto rispetto a qualla discarica di facebook, e mi ricordavo i newsgroup del dolce passato. Poco tempo è passato prima che mi rendessi conto che il sub era impestato da un manipolo di prepotenti che rendevano l'atmosfera sgradevole. In questi mesi i contenuti ed i toni del sub sono andati peggiorando, e non mi stupisce l'esito di questi giorni. La merda ed il ventilatore si attraggono, è una legge di natura.

At the moment, I was a poor worker, struggling between 2 jobs and late rents, with no family to help me. On top of that, I wasn't exactly a bright student, and when they saw my grades, the type of Baccalaureate I had, they refused me.

Even if it's University, there is quite a few people who want to do medicine, the first year it's 2500 students for approximately 200 places. So now, now of the deans / academy make this kind of selection for older people or students who wants to retake a university career. 

There's no such thing a NP in France. When you have your diploma in Nursing school, you're ""Bac+3"", a licence. The 3 specializations that I've cited in another post are 2 years, so ""Bac+5"", a master. 

The Medicine Order (L'Odre des Medecins) is an old elephant, with his roots in the Occupied France, in 1944 I think. They are very attached to they privileges. It's them, with the Government, that decide, each year, the numbers of places (Numerus Clausus) for medicine, dentists, pharmacists, midwife and physiotherapist. Each of theses profession make the same first year : PACES. First common year of health studies (Approximation translation, sorry)

You say : 

* S**T**P (S'il te plaît) when you ""tutoye"" -&gt; s'il **Te** plaît.
* S**V**P (S'il vous plaît) when you ""vouvoye) -&gt; s'il **Vous** plaît.

Some easy mnemonics tip :)

I think each country have flaws and benefices about MD's. In France, a lot of things are decided by your ""Baccalauréat"" for this kind of studies, and the first year is some skinning. Too many peoples, too little places. On top of that, it's not a really good method, the future MD aren't necessarily the best / motivated / the greats.

I do understand why you feel that way. Antwerp &amp; Flemish Brabant are in the center of the region and media have a tendency to take that part of ""Flanders"" as the ""standard"", while West-Flemings are usually portrayed as backward farmers with an incomprehensible accent. Not to mention the Limburgers, who completely get the shaft. They might as well be inexistant or even worse, German. 


It all goes to show how complex identity is. I have a soft spot for Francophone Belgians like Jacques Brel, Hergé and Stromae and I cheer for Walloon footballers like Eden Hazard, but apart from that I actually know very little about Wallonia and I do feel annoyed when they ""drag us down"" in statistics about quality of education or English proficiency. 


On a supra-national level, I feel a kinship with Dutch people. My best friends are ""Hollanders"" from The Hague &amp; Rotterdam. But when people talk about Flanders joining the Netherlands or when Belgium plays against NL, I momentarily turn into a rabid Hollander hater :P My skin crawls everytime I hear how my Hollandic friends talk about their North Brabantian or Limburgian countrymen (or even worse, Frisians). Even the chillest, friendliest people from Holland seem to have grown up with this notion that everyone not from Holland proper is a retard, a farmer or a combination of the two.

But when it comes down to it, Scotland will have to generate most of its revenues by tax, which makes sense. That's how any other country would make money.

But Salmond is promising quite a lot of things, all of which sound lovely, but are possibly not in the realms of feasibility. He's said he wants to reverse the years of ""Austerity"" that Britain has been in, which means ramping up spending. Once more, that's fair. However, he plans to introduce free child care, free school meals, maintain free universities (Which will be absolutely flooded with English people wanting free education) among other proposals.

Taxes can only be raised so high before businesses will want nothing to do with you, and it would be against the socialist ethos to lower corporation tax. So it's likely, Tax revenue won't increase very much, whereas spending will, likely Scotland will have to borrow money to cover it.

Skip the special exhibits unless there's something you are particularly interested in--both museums have top-notch permanent collections that you could spend days exploring.

Some smaller art museums with nice collections:

* Museo Sorolla
* Museo del Románticismo (not everyone's favorite era, but it's interesting to see in one collection and the interior courtyard has a nice cafe)
* Fundación Lázaro Galdiano
* Temporary exhibits at the Círculo de Bellas Artes (combine with a visit to the beautiful rooftop)
* Temporary exhibits at the Caixa Forum (along with the vertical garden out front)
* Goya frescoes at the San Antonio de la Florida church (highly recommended if you have an interest in Goya)

The Museo Arqueológico Nacional just reopened after a big redo and is very much worth a trip. The Biblioteca Nacional has a small museum closeby that is free.
 

The Museo Naval has some cool old maps of the Americas and nautical paraphernalia.


The Museo Geominero is a very old-school museum with a huge collection of rocks, minerals and fossils. The building is really beautiful--probably the prettiest museum in Madrid.

 [**Spasticity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasticity): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Spasticity__ is a feature of altered [skeletal muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle) performance in [muscle tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone) involving [hypertonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertonia); it is also referred to as an unusual ""tightness"", stiffness, or ""pull"" of muscles. The word [spasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasm) comes from the Greek word σπασμός (*spasmos*), meaning ""drawing, pulling."" Clinically, spasticity is defined as velocity-dependent resistance to stretch, where a lack of inhibition results in excessive [contraction of the muscles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction), ultimately leading to hyperflexia, an exaggerated deep tendon reflex on stimulation with a reflex hammer (or spontaneous firing of deep tendon reflexes as in [clonus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonus)).

Pero' IDM (ma anche IDU) va avanti quasi unicamente sul masochismo di Bruno, ostinato ad andare in autostrada contromano. Da quando e' stato doxxato (una tristezza immensa, il tizio), ARBEL e' ai minimi termini, ma il suo destino era gia' segnato dalla defezione del Manca/SONOTRANOI.
Ora il vecchietto reggiano si limita a inveire ogni tanto, non posta neanche piu' le sue cazzate energetiche visto che i fisici lo smontano ogni volta, e come apre bocca il resto della ciurma (che non e' in fondo meglio di lui) gliela riempie di guano.


A me pero', da full-time IDFer e IDLer a tempo perso, piaceva la scaramuccia stilistica di IDL. A volte si tiravano pura merda in faccia, niente da dire, ma c'era molto genio in parecchi scontri. E poi i casi umani abbondavano anche li': il quattrovirgole imprenditore sborone (poi ignominiosamente distrutto dal fallimento della societa', che poi era del fratello), il rivoltante e geniale Leo Spears, il povero Graziano Ledda che ha incontrato il suo destino flammando un tornio, eccetera.

La rovina di IDL sono stati i raduni (cosi' come anche quella di IDF, ma in un modo diverso). Una volta diventati AMICI e imbolsitisi nella routine, gli IDLers si slinguazzavano sul NG e l'unico divertimento era pestare di malavoglia il kook di turno che provava a mettersi i guantoni. L'unico che ha resistito era Gobbacci, ma solo per pura brute force.

Ora di quei tempi sono rimaste solo rovine, bimbiminkia, manifesti del GCN e paolobarrairottoinculo. Se non altro, Google Gruppi ricorda la passata gloria, almeno finche' non si rompe le balle pure lui.

IDU languisce, ma IDM va avanti. Facci un giro, anche da lurker come faccio io, magari quattro risate te le fai ancora.

- atteggiamento alla ""ho ragione io e tu suca"";

- trollaggio e/o insulti gratuiti;

- quando il discorso passa dalla terza alla seconda persona: ""eh ma tu..."", che, anche se non seguito da insulti, è indice di mancanza di argomenti.

Auf dem Tisch habe ich mit Regalbrettern aus dem Baumarkt und einem zurechtgeschnittenen Tischbein, sowie ein paar weiteren Winkeln eine zweite Ebene geschaffen, auf welcher die Monitore stehen. Dadurch hat man mehr platz auf dem Tisch.

Rechts und Links am Tisch habe ich jeweils dann noch einmal erweitert, vor allem rechts weil ich sonst nicht mit meinem Studiumskram unterkomme.

1. This is already ongoing warfare on economical and political, public opinion, information etc. level. Russia is already shitting on us. 

2. Russia's economy is the size of Italy. They need more Finland than Finland needs Russia.

3. Finland is backed with EU and partly by NATO. An we have a Army. 

4. It's time to show Putin that he doesn't want to fuck with us. If you look weak now in the Global Arena, they'll attack you like they do in Ukraine. 

5. World is going little bit crazy now. We need to look who our friends are and start supporting each others. Love to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania Sweden, Norway, Ukraina etc. and Europe. And USA. They really are the one that Russia fears like shit. 

6. There is the fear of Finland losing it's reputation and slipping in the Mordor. Yes, that's Russia, Russians themselves call it that way as a joke in the intern... here in the internets. 

7. Keep Calm and carry Ammo... to those who will be doing it. Of course we don't all need to go on some war mode and start using camo 24/7 on the streets, no... :D Just that take this serious enough and support those who will be doing it.

This is not ""warmongerring"". This is a wake up call. Finnish political command structure is paralysed right now, they are all playing their ""dirty"" parliamentary election games and don't want to be ""bad news"" in bringer. They also play behind the screens trying to save what possibly can be saved. And they are doing some slippery moves, the rookie prime minister is just a twitter-face after all and the president has wet his pants, sadly.

You see, if the jews would have stood up against Holocaust and get 1 Nazi knocked out for each 50 Jews they knocked out, there would never have been WW2. Think about it. Israel has thought about it, hard. And they are now a nation that nobody wants to attack. It's quite opposite actually.

It's just that in general the narrative that has been fed to Europeans and Americans has had little to no nuance. Putin is being compared to Hitler on a regular basis, the fact that the Ukrainians toppled a democratically elected government with some western backing is being brushed over, the shelling of civilians by Ukrainian forces has hardly been mentioned, and so on. If people just took some time to look at things from the Russians point of view the Russians won't look that evil anymore.

Russia has several times been invaded by western forces that have pillaged and destroyed in their way. After the German re-unification and subsequent NATO membership the Russians were promised that NATO wouldn't expand eastwards. Now the west have backed a coup d'etat on their backyard in Kiev. An area that has long historic ties to Russia. Of course the Russians are going to react. This entire conflict was entirely predictable to some analysts. 

So what we essentially have is a very unnecessary conflict that essentially comes from two cultures not understanding each other. The west thinks Putin is a crazy dictator who won't stop until he has restored the Soviet empire. The Russians see the west as hellbent on imposing our values on them, topple their government and make the Russian empire weak and powerless.

This situation plays right into the hands of the military complex and Putin's approval ratings.

&gt;England is fucking weird. Do they have wizards and dragons, too?
#
&gt;If Britain were a U.S. state, it would be the second-poorest, behind Alabama and before Mississippi
#
&gt;I've travelled extensively in Europe. I see the most abuse of Americans by British people. It seems British people are also the quickest to start up a conversation with me about How Stupid Americans Are, and they'll assume (it's common in Canada, I'm afraid, so they aren't wrong about Canadians in general) that I'll be oh-so-happy to discuss how much I hate Americans with them and trade stories and internet memes illustrating the stupidity of Americans and more fodder for hatred. Germans seem to like Americans more, actually, every country in western Europe likes Americans more than the British, but Germans seem exceptionally civil and broad-minded. 
#
&gt;Serous question: Is England's status as a fallen empire the reason for wy their hatred of Americans is so virulent? I mean, we all hate Americans a little, but the British brand of hatred just seems to be so much deeper. 
#
&gt;This is the weirdest thing for me. My British coworker constantly complains of the lack of a proper British pub. Go back to fucking England already then. 
#
&gt;I remember this, too. My professor called it the British African Genocide and said that British textbooks whitewashed it. 
#
&gt;Britain is complicit in all of the worst things the USA did after 9/11.
#
&gt;Now you know why they like to make fun of Americans - it makes them feel better about themselves.
#
&gt;I find British people mock everything North American. Except Mexico, because that would be racist. And seriously, British humor is MEAN. I don't know that I could survive what I've seen British people put American through at hostels. You wanna know why us Canucks wear our own flag so often? It's because we see what you're like. Canada has a culture of hating Americans as well, I think Brits are meaner, though, at least from what I've seen.
#
&gt;So you're admitting that there is indeed a typical British hatred for all things American?
#
&gt;Traditional Indian food &gt; Traditional British food. Indian food and Paki food is all I ate in London my second and third trip there, and all I would eat if I were to go back ever again.
#
&gt;The British seem obsessed with hating everyone who isn't British, I have noticed.
#
&gt;I joke about assaulting Americans with political criticisms online, but I don't do it in reality. However, most Canadians I know do take every chance they can get to be shitty to Americans when they see them outside of America and outnumber them. I can say the same about British people. I agree with you that the rest of the world, aside from Canadians and Brits, doesn't punish American tourist for their feelings towards the American government.
#
&gt;Agreed. Our joint Canadian-British operation of treating American tourists like shit and making them feel unwelcome wherever we see them in the world is not having enough effect on actual US policy.
#
&gt;I hope Britain and the USA are on opposite sides. From my travels in Europe I know that British people hate Americans enough for this to happen, the ones I met at least.

I have some concern about the development of Europe in the coming decades.

There are four big issues, in my point of view, that can have a big impact on our society:1) Global warming, 2) financial/banking stability, 3) immigration and 4) the replacement of human labour by robots. 

There are a lot of talks on the first three points, but not in the last one.

As robotization advances it is clearly proved that almost half of the jobs could be replaced by robots. In fact, I think most of the unemployment we have, specially in Southern Europe has this reason behind. 

Some people talk about the implementation of a basic guaranteed income, that I think it can issue effectively the problem, without great impact on inflation. Switzerland already tried to pass such a legislation but had not enough public support.

Is this issue getting in EU agenda or not?
