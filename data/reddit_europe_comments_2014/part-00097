1. Paris, c'est comme le Toronto de la France. C'est une très grande ville qui est magnifique, contient plein d'histoire et de choses intéressants avec tout pleins de gens très occupés qui ont pleins de choses à faire et qui veulent RIEN à voir avec les touristes. Malgré cela, on y trouve aussi des gens qui veulent bien aider et qui sont gentils, qui sont sociables et intéressés/intéressants. À savoir s'il y a des places en France où les gens sont plus sociables, en règle générale les gens sont plus molos quand on sort de Paris et qu'on se retrouve dans de plus petites villes, genre Bordeaux, Grenoble, etc, comme mentionné. C'est la mentalité de petite ville vs grosse ville: compare Toronto avec Kingston, ou Trois-Rivières. 

2. Comme mentionné, il y a des chateaux à n'en plus finir dans la vallée de la Loire. Pour la bière, je sais pas, je trouve généralement que des imports, à part la 1664. Il faudrait chercher, peut-être que dans des villes il va y avoir de microbrasseries. Si tu veux t'aventurer dans l'acool Francais, essaye le cidre. C'est pas du tout du cidre comme chez nous, mais les gens ici semblent aimer.

3. Pour les femmes, c'est plus difficile à dire puisque je suis moi même une femme. Je crois que c'est un peu le même concept qu'à Montréal: elles ont un attitude défensive envers les gars qui les abordent, pas par mechanceté mais pour se protéger. C'est souvent dû à des gars louches qui font pleins de commentaires dans les rues, dépendant d'où tu es à Paris, et de l'heure. C'est un peu sketch aussi dans les métros, ou dans les trains, un homme qui approche une femme est assumé comme saoul ou dopé.

true,thewimsey,null,null,"The article is really not very good; it misunderstands some fundamental points about German society.  There are groceries within walking distance of most people *not* because city planners made place for them, but because German laws tend to protect small businesses from larger businesses (at the expense of the consumer, arguably). US laws protect the consumer from large and small businesses, which tends to hurt small businesses.

The point behind Germany's elaborate store closing laws (and the numerous laws regulating sales and discounts) is to put small businesses on an even footing with larger businesses.  

If the grocery around the corner charges the same price as bigger stores and has the same hours, there's no reason to drive to the larger store.  If big stores aren't allowed to discount books and the corner store can order whatever you need in a day, there's no need to go to the larger store unless there is something that you just can't get there. 

By focusing on the consumer, in the US you get the lowest prices and extreme convenience (i.e., a grocery store open 24 hours/day). You *also* get a larger store that you probably have to drive to, and a very limited number of smaller grocery stores, since they can't really compete on price with the larger store.

Die 9-11-Serie ist genau das, wovon ich sprach. Denn 9-11 bewies vor allen Dingen, wie unfähig große, bürokratische Organisationen gegenüber innovativen Gegnern sind. Große Unternehmen vs. kleine Startups z.B. Oder damals CIA/NSA/FBI gegen kleine Terrorzellen. Und um den Skandal perfekt zu machen haben sie dann die Leute befördert, die die Nachforschungen zu der Zelle blockiert haben und die Leute rausgeworfen, die dem nachgehen wollten. Auch das eine typische Reaktion einer großen Organisation. Es werden nicht die Leute befördert, die gute Arbeit machen, sondern die, die gut Politik machen können.

In the end his desire to be liked is why people are beginning to hate him. It doesn't matter how serious the United States is about its NATO commitments or defending Japan if doesn't take the controversial steps like placing troops in Estonia or refusing to firmly state that China will find itself in a war with the US if it attacks Japan (that happened earlier this week). Are those commitments real? I believe they are, but I can see how everything Obama does reinforces the idea that they are negotiable positions. More people will die in the long run if he shies away from smaller controversial moves to reinforce the deterrent effect  and Russia or China tries to test them than will die from controversy.

This will only bait the bear to lash out to demonstrate who is really weak and who is strong. It is a game that Obama is not psychologically equipped to understand, let alone win.

/u/JimmyVega here's a translation of /u/Horgh's comment in case you didn't understand some of it :

Camping “in the wild” isn't allowed, but bivouac is. A bivouac is defined by the fact of establishing a camp to stay from sunset to sunrise. But be careful, it isn't allowed everywhere, particularly in natural reserves / beaches / scrublands of the south of France. Starting a camp fire isn't legal, but according to my experience nobody really cares (except in areas with high risks of forest fire, naturally). If you do camp, try to stick to the Leave No Trace policy the best you can, so that we aren't even more penalised by law because of a few irresponsible fools.

TL;DR : inform yourself by asking town halls / [ONFs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Forests_Office) local to where you intend to bivouac, but in the South I've got a bad feeling about it.

Though I would say 600 signatures should not mean too much (as an absence of interest per se). Look at the Crimea referendum (and yes of course, it was **not** 100% fair, but I think big portion of these votes were genuine), on last elections pro-Russia party got only 4% of the votes. Even we discount heavily the results of referendum, and let us say only 40% of the voters **really** voted for joining Russia, still it is 10-fold increase in approval of this pro-Russia agenda... I do not care to judge, who is wrong in this Crimea mess, rather I want to say, that when people feel their votes **can** make a difference, they pay more attention and they vote.

So this public stunt by Ivangorod councilor was not taken seriously, should people perceive it as a real possibility, they would collect much more votes IMHO.

That has been said, I do not believe either Estonia,either Russia would be willing to enter any sort of territorial collaboration - there is way too much mistrust on both sides. And my hypothetical scenario is much more wider... if one would want to enable transfer of governance,which would most certainly involve some financial transfers at one point or the other (think for example about law-obedient Germans governing little chunk of ""lawless"" Greek territory [prejudice, but whatever... it is a mental exercise]) how would you structure such a territorial partnership? On one side more successful side will be unwilling to put resources into less successful side on unconditional basis. On the other side should you join part of territiry of the less successful side... it will lead to nationalistic backlash - we cannot capitulate, to give our land to the other side...

*Elections*

* Results: Fidesz won with a sizeable margin, noone was questioning that. Their supermajority is in danger though as all districts stopped reporting at around 98,5-99% of the votes processed, because votes belonging to the districts but casted elsewhere must be physically processed in the district they ""belong"" to, which can take days because of logistics. The deciding district is Budapest 15, where Fidesz currently leads by 22 votes.

* Polls are open and will close at 7pm. Participation is expected to be medium-level, around or below 65%. This is the first election under the new laws, so no campaign silence other than in the 150m vicinity of the voting locations. Fidesz is sure to win and almost sure to win with a 2/3 supermajority - again. You can follow [politics.hu's liveblog](http://www.politics.hu) in English for the day's events if you are interested.

*Not elections*

I lied. Some of the larger elections-related stories and others: 

* Unsolicited Fidesz-messages (SMS and letters) were reaching voters, including some who specifically opted out from sharing their contact information for such purposes at the National Voting Office. 

* Gábor Vona, Chairman of Jobbik famously demanded Orbán to participate in a TV-debate with him, which he flatly rejected. So in their campaign-closing event, [Vona had a TV-debate](http://www.politics.hu/20140405/jobbik-leader-debates-tv-orban/).

Sono molto ben fatte e molto articolate, vattele a leggere.

Al di la' della questione tecnica, secondo me il punto della questione e' questo:

&gt; - Per poter mettere in atto un progetto di tale portata servirebbero enormi flotte di aerei con equipaggi. Come è possibile che nessuno abbia ancora confessato?

&gt;I sostenitori delle scie chimiche ritengono che ci sia un complotto radicato in ogni livello della società per impedire alla verità di emergere. Le categorie che dovrebbero essere coinvolte sono decine e decine. Per capire la portata del complotto da loro sostenuto è sufficiente fare un semplice ragionamento: 
Chi pilota gli aerei deve sapere quello che sta facendo; quindi i piloti militari sono coinvolti, però anche quelli civili devono aver percepito qualcosa, visto che volano spesso vicini agli aerei chimici e ancora più spesso sono proprio i voli civili a generare le presunte scie chimiche. I controllori di volo devono essere tutti a conoscenza della faccenda, per poter coordinare questo enorme traffico criminale senza intralciare il comune traffico civile. 
I meteorologi, i fisici, i chimici, i biologi e gli ingegneri devono sapere perché studiano in vario modo l'ambiente e non possono non accorgersi dei milioni di tonnellate di sostanze nocive scaricate quotidianamente sulle loro teste. I medici dovrebbero notare la presenza di nanomacchine nei loro pazienti e l'insorgenza di sintomi e malattie nuove, quindi sanno tutto e nascondono la verità. I governi pagano le irrorazioni e il silenzio di tutti tramite i servizi segreti; di conseguenza anche la Guardia di Finanza deve essere a conoscenza della questione, altrimenti tutte le tangenti che il governo paga per avere il silenzio di questi milioni di persone sarebbero già emerse da tempo. Questo è solo un piccolo esempio delle categorie che dovrebbero essere coinvolte; molte vengono aggiunte all'elenco senza un particolare motivo. Basti pensare che tra gli ""insabbiatori"" del fenomeno scie chimiche sono stati inseriti anche gli autori e i produttori di spot pubblicitari e film ove appaiono raffigurate scie di condensa.

* Parliament struggles to find political consensus regarding the Protection of Primary Residence Law Proposal (drafted by the opposition parties) that is brought forward as an equalising measure after banks received a green light to foreclose on non-performing loans. The Law, aiming to protect the most vulnerable from losing their homes over late mortgage payments (if overall value is under 200 000EUR), has wide popular support, but the government fears it will violate the provisions of the Memorandum [[P]](http://www.politisnews.eu/cgibin/hweb?-A=261153&amp;-V=articles) [[SL]](http://www.sigmalive.com/news/oikonomia/115210)

* Young conscript in critical condition, another injured; lost his right hand and sustained multiple injuries all over his body, caused by a faulty grenade during his obligatory military training. Another conscript, *the instructor*, was also injured in that incident, but less critically. Deaths during training are not uncommon, and most were attributed to faulty ammo and lack of maintenance. Those where people forced to serve, they had no choice as to whether they want to work in an extremely dangerous environment were 19-year-old 'officers' supervise 18-year-old 'soldiers'  [[Ph]](http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/top-stories/885/192994/ekrixi-cheirovomvidas-se-pedio-volis-me-travmatismous)

* Apparently 'NeoBee', a bitcoin 'bank' that was very recently set up in Cyprus was a scam. The company's ~30 employees, and the suppliers/advert agency/software devs remain unpaid (a total of ~0.5 million EUR), the boss is abroad and hiding, taking the ~8mill EUR that were raised through the company's IPO with him. He did get money from the employees promising to convert then into bitcoins (they never received them), but 'Neo' had no real customers, and less than 100 people expressed interest to learn more about this new type of 'bank' during the first month of operation. After two weeks of uncertainty, staff and consultants resigned. Two of his hired consultants will sue Brewster after being defrauded of 35 000EUR in total [[OCY]](http://www.onlycy.com/456380-%CE%AD%CF%86%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%B5-%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C-%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CE%BA%CF%8D%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF-%CE%BF-%CE%B9%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82-%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82-neo-%CE%B4) [[SL]](http://www.sigmalive.com/news/oikonomia/114427)

&gt; *(1) Has been considered a refugee under the Arrangements of 12 May 1926 and 30 June 1928 or under the Conventions of 28 October 1933 and 10 February 1938, the Protocol of 14 September 1939 or the Constitution of the International Refugee Organization; Decisions of non-eligibility taken by the International Refugee Organization during the period of its activities shall not prevent the status of refugee being accorded to persons who fulfil the conditions of paragraph 2 of this section;*

&gt; *(2) As a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951 and owing to wellfounded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it. In the case of a person who has more than one nationality, the term “the country of his nationality” shall mean each of the countries of which he is a national, and a person shall not be deemed to be lacking the protection of the country of his nationality if, without any valid reason based on well-founded fear, he has not availed himself of the protection of one of the countries of which he is a national.*

But the most important point is the article 33, concerning the ""non-refoulement"":

&gt; *No Contracting State shall expel or return (“refouler”) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.*

In the case of Hungarian refugees, after the crisis of 1956, many of them were resettled in Western countries (38'000 in the USA, 35'000 in Canada, etc.) but some refugees also adopted for repatriation, encouraged by the USSR and the Hungarian regime. So nobody was automatically sent back to his/her country behind the Iron Curtain, except if they wanted to.

I agree with this, but again nuancing is necessary. The focus of Euroscepticism seems to be over free movement of peoples. Free movement of peoples is great, but unfortunately people that favour Euroscepticism are often convinced that free movement leads to job losses (e.g. a German losing his job to a Romanian) or benefit tourism.

When mainstream Euroscepticism (i.e. that coming from mainstream parties, so not UKIP in the UK or the PVV, despite their electoral success, in the Netherlands) it focuses on these nuances, not on a desire to end the EU altogether. A renegotiated deal for the UK (read non-Eurozone nations) that allows further integration from those who want or need it (Eurozone nations) without harming the non-Eurozone members, will help extraordinarily.

* New government following the local elections

We had local elections on the 23 and 30 March, and saw [the right wing and extreme-right wing take over a number of cities previously held by left-wing political party](http://elections.lefigaro.fr/resultats/elections-municipales-2014/). As the main left-wing party is the one of the current president, the results of the elections can be analysed as a punition of the executive's party, as [the current president, François Hollande, is the most impopular we had in decades](http://www.rtl.fr/actualites/info/politique/article/les-cotes-de-popularite-des-presidents-de-la-ve-republique-7769694060).

As a consequence, a [new government](http://www.gouvernement.fr/institutions/composition-du-gouvernement) was formed this week. Previously composed of members of the Ecological Party as well as Socialists (moderate left-wing party, party of François Hollande), [the Ecological Party refused to be associated with the new one](http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2014/04/01/les-verts-refusent-de-participer-au-gouvernement-valls_4393877_823448.html).

One fairly surprising thing is that previous Socialist candidate for presidency in 2007, [Segolène Royal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9gol%C3%A8ne_Royal) and mother of four of François Hollande's children, is now part of the government as the minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy.",0,1396780035,null,0,1396781623,0,cglcpjc,t3_22c0zt,t1_cglcpjc,t3_22c0zt,null,1433231742,24,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,24

&gt;As you said yourself... Western Europe stopped worrying about Russia after 1991 - why would they? A broken country.

It was not just power. There was - and still kinda is - a genuine optimism that we are past major military conflicts.

&gt;Nevertheless, the policy of containment was never abandoned: in books by Kissinger and especially by Brzezinski, the fucking timeline was given about order and years when and which country will be admitted into the EU and NATO. 

I don't know, but I always envisaged NATO expansion not as anti-Russia but pro-peace. Hell, before Putin became more imperial, I always thought that Russia should, eventually, join NATO too.

&gt;So while these countries did join (on their own accord??)

East European countries joined very much on their own accord. Baltic states almost tripped over themselves to get there, heh heh

&gt; it cannot be said that Cold War thinking was abandoned (at least by not all parties involved [and I mean non-Russian players]).

Yes, it was never going to just disappear. But I maintain nonetheless that it was never malicious on the part of the West.

&gt;What is clear though, that NATO/EU are expanding too aggressively and too fast - new members are not integrated enough (in case of EU it leads to all sort of problems), membership fees for staying in NATO are not payed (so it new members are seeing NATO as free protection insurance) 

I agree, partially, the expansion was, perhaps, too hasty. But it was based on a general optimism and a genuine desire to expand the sphere of peace and prosperity. While risky, I believe it was a good risk.

&gt;On the side note: does anyone in Poland is saying that you guys will need anti-missile shield against Iran? If Polish know, this shield suppose to be against Russia, I would say than Russia knows that too ;)

Can't speak for other Poles, most of them are more xenophobic than I am. Of course, there was always a lingering - and now justified - distrust towards Russia. But the way I see it, even the anti-missile shield was not directly against Russia, it was more about tying ourselves to the USA militarily as much as possible, which is a popular idea in Poland. No one seriously considered the anti-missile system to be any defense against Russia's nuclear arsenal.

To recap my main point: NATO expansion is not against Russia, unless being immune to military bullying by Russia is considered to be against Russia's interests. ",0,1396780702,null,0,1396784435,0,cglcss2,t3_220447,t1_cglcss2,t1_cgj34o3,null,1433231784,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

I do agree with the essence of the rest of your comment. Kagame is a douchebag who uses the genocide to silence international opposition to his authoritarianism, and „whiteys” are still paternalistic towards africans. It's either „they kill each other because of colonialism” (not saying it wasn't a factor in how things are today) or „they kill each other because they have always been doing it” (as if the rest of humanity was some sort of hippie commune).

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; If Ukraine just keeps taking gas and not paying the full price, Russia will shut down the gas that goes trough Ukraine. 

And then Russia is going to provide gas to Crimea how? Remember that the Crimean peninsula is 80-90% dependend on energy and water it gets from the mainland. Good luck running a tourist resort without water, electricity and gas.

Ukraine not accepting the unilateral price hike is the correct thing to do here. The $485 is simply ridiculous price as European average Gazprom price is $380 including transit costs. And if one wants to take the disputed price to arbitration or court the first step is not to accept the new unilaterally dictated price hike.

Either party can take the dispute to arbitration or court. I don't think Russia would do that because Ukraine actually has a good case. And Ukraine's strategy seems to be first not to accept the price hike, and if Russia retaliates by not selling gas then take that dispute to arbitration or court. 

And if Russia stops selling gas to Ukraine they do have options: use reserves (gives some months), get that agreed upon reverse flow from Slovakia going (will take at least several months or til 2015), or simply take some of the gas transiting to the EU.

Then Russia's option would be to cut all gas deliveries through Ukraine including those going to the EU. While possible I don't think it's likely. Currently Gazprom is not doing so hot and disrupting gas deliveries to the biggest customers would not improve its position. Doing so would have serious repercussions both in Russia and the EU but economically would hit Russia harder.

They have been very active these last couple of months semi-legally blocking the stores where ""legal drugs"" were sold. They have huge popular support and the fight against all kind of legal and not-so-legal drugs is only gaining momentum.  
  

* **A member of parliament resigned** after news surfaced about his son being caught with a couple of kilos of ""legal drugs"" in his car. The son was caught earlier this year, the MP is resigning now because it's become public knowledge.  
  

* The only Latvian in the NBA, **[Andris Biedriņš](http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/123/files/2013/12/7973562.jpg), has been waived by the Utah Jazz**, meaning any team can now claim him with his current contract. Effectively though it means he's fired from the NBA, as his contract is $ 9mill a year and his scored 3 or so points this season, meaning $ 3mill per point.  
  

* Media watchdog has **banned rebroadcasting of Russia's state channel [RTR Rossija](http://www.la.lv/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/g1/PBKRU-664x445.jpg)** in the territory of Latvia for 3 months due to war propaganda. This follows a similar decision in Lithuania. Another similar channel - PBK - is under investigation facing administrative penalties for dishonesty while reporting news.  
  

* The state **company that's maintaining roads will probably have to fire a lot of its employees** as the company gets government money for work done and the winter was so -meh- this year that they didn't really have as much to do as expected.  
  

* A very **mysterious theft happened in Saeima** (the parliament). Someone stole 3 laptops from the desk of the speaker in [the plenary hall](http://i.imgur.com/cdRYrQV.jpg)...during daytime. They didn't have any important information on them and are already replaced, still a bold move.  
  

* George W. **Bush has painted [a portrait](http://i.imgur.com/4bUV8l5.jpg) of the former president of Latvia** Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga... among about 24 other world leaders.  
  

* The only reason why the **new [National library](http://i.imgur.com/If2O1bh.jpg) still cannot be officially opened** is apparently only the fact that the old [trolley cable poles](http://i.imgur.com/19uYYDu.jpg) are yet to be changed.  
  

* The council of the 7th biggest city in the country, **Rēzekne, figures it'd be a good idea to disband its [municipal police](http://img.reitingi.lv/news/pasvaldibas_policija.jpg)** and ask the [state police](http://www.vp.gov.lv//images_upl/bebrs_runcis_bernu_sadalai.jpg) to take municipal responsibilities. [The State Police](http://www.sargi-sevi.lv/gallery/albums/import/Jaunie_moci_2010_153.jpg) is not amused. It's speculated that the move is simply a personal revenge - the mayor was forced to re-hire the director of local municipal police department by court order. So if he can't get rid of the person, he will disband the whole department.  
* **The president surprised everyone by asking the [head of Russian Orthodox Church](http://i.imgur.com/p2ApQS3.jpg) to postpone his visit to Latvia** to some time later this year. Now he and the speaker of parliament are in a sort of mini-dispute over whose idea it actually was and who gets the credit for it. The president has been very heavily criticized the last few weeks for being indecisive and generally pointless so perhaps this is how he shows some muscles.

Finland's economy is doing bad because exports are doing bad.

Exports are doing bad because there has been long recession and global demand for those exports has been down. Finland's exports are mostly investment driven, not consumer driven.

Demand for Finland's exports has been down because industries and businesses in other countries have not invested into new production because consumer demand has been down.

Now after recession consumer demand is raising. Industries and businesses will start ramping up their production. But it will still take time until they start to invest into new production, and therefore it will take time until Finland's exports see significant growth again.

None of this is because of 'bad government'. The structure of Finland's exports is what it is and it's not government's fault or even responsibility to run consumer driven export industries in Finland.

That is not to say that the government does not deserve critisism, but 'economy going to shit' is not one of them.

If in US you had a single party that represented the culture and ideology of all the rednecks in the south, or a party that represent the thought of all the poor black people or whatever. Then yes, you will have alot of far right parties with stupid ideas. As long as the US ""far right"" is still controlled by the GOP and big corporations, it still limits how much regular people express their feelings in them. And thats another big difference with politics in US and Europe. In US, $$$ buys votes much more. In most European countries there are money controls on the spending parties can do, or how much they receive from the private sector. This makes it that in the US, no one but the GOP or Dems can win an election in the forseeable future. Not the case in most of Europe.

Zur Zeit gibt es wegen genau so einem Gesetz Riesenmecker in England, weil Hausbesitzer plötzlich für die Renovierung der lokalen Kirchen herangezogen werden (wozu sie theoretisch nach Tudor-Recht verpflichtet sind). Auch wenn sie Moslems oder Juden oder Atheisten oder Katholiken sind.

* Ist das gemeinsame vordergründige Merkmal jetzt der Asylstatus oder schwarze Hautfarbe?

Ich der Ansicht, dass die ständige Verwendung von ""Schwarzafrikanern"" anstatt ""Drogendealern"" das völlig falsche Signal setzt, das Arbeitsverbot als die ursprüngliche Problemwurzel cachiert und sowieso schön fett Ressentiments schürt, weil man mehr Wert auf die Hautfarbe als den realen sozialen Status setzt.

Ich denke als Politiker kann man das wissen und sollte dementsprechend feinfühliger sein und sich über die Wirkung der Sprache (als wichtigstes menschliches Komunikationsmittel) bewusst sein!

Protipp:


Sprache wandelt sich mit der Zeit. Wenn ""Neger"" früher nicht rassistisch war, kann sich das Konnotat-Denotat Verhältnis heute so geändert haben, dass man heute Wörter wie ""Zigeuner"", ""Neger"" usw als rassitisch einstufen kann.

Dieser Sachverhalt ist der Grund, warum es für alte Leute bis zu einem gewissen Grad vollkommen legitim sein kann, ""Neger"" äquivalent zu ""Schwarzer"" und ""Zigeuner"" äquivalent zu ""Sinti &amp; Roma"" zu benutzen. Dazu sei gesagt, dass o.g. Entwicklung bei Neger schon abgeschlossen ist, bei ""Zigeuner imho noch ein wenig braucht.

Ändert aber nix dran, dass in der heutigen Sprache ""Neger"" durchaus rassistisch konnotiert ist, u.a. weil es eben oft von Rechten verwendet wird und sich die Konnotation v.a. deswegen gewandelt hat.

Wer Neger heute noch in der modernen Sprache verwendet, sieht sich somit vollkommen zurecht zumindest einer gewissen Skepsis ausgesetzt.

Kann spontan mit diesem artikel dienen, bei der die Rechtfertigung der Ermittlungseinstellungen exakt das aufgreift, was ich grade gesagt hab:

&gt;  As long as the US ""far right"" is still controlled by the GOP and big corporations, it still limits how much regular people express their feelings in them.

Political parties in US might have more diversity than those in Europe. Which is normal, because of its size and history, the makeup of US makes it one of the most diverse, if not the most diverse country in the world. 

So the makeup of parties is diverse, but as long as these diversities only have 2 choices, it doesnt really change the policies.

Let me give an example. In the US, the Democrats know 95% of black people will vote for them. So yes, the democrats will try to be  more black friendly. But how much do blacks affect the politics of Democrats?

In France the Communists are atleast 10%. But the difference is this, they have their own party, they dont have to vote for Hollande. If Hollande wants them on his side, he has to do their (stupid) policies and make a 75% tax. If Hollande wants the greens he has to follow their policies and stop nuclear energy (Hollande just lost the Greens who quit his government after Manuel Valls was elected Prime Minister. The Greens think hes too right wing). 

Now imagine if black americans had their own party. Thats 12% of the country. This party has its own traditions and has existed for decades. It has its labour unions that control millions of people. Thats very influential. Dont you think that black americans would have more influence in politics? Because thats how it is in Europe. 

There are many parties so you need coalitions to rule a country. A party with 5% if it plays its cards right can be VERY influential. In the US thats not the case. There is a lot of diversity, but INSIDE the parties. All this diversity doesnt matter that much if the decisions at the top are made by the same people for the interests of the same people. So yes, they might make a few laws that are black or hispanic friendly, but its not the same thing as having a black or a hispanic party, that pulls in over 10% and has its whole program for their own interests.

First year me and my friends attempted to do this, we had to steal a tree from a private compound. To avoid the noise we used axes instead of a chainsaw. Imagine five or six guys, drunk, chopping down a 10 meter high birch tree in the middle of the night... One guy was almost hit by the falling tree!
Then we cut off the top and had to bring it to the next village where the girl lived that was supposed to get the tree. So we carried it, since we had no cars at that age... Only a little trolley loaded with beer and other alcohol.

It was the only militarily sound tactic in the situation.


&gt; -They end up losing after wrecking the East of the country


They surrendered because the war was growing out of proportion, with the US. joining the war it wasn't feasible to believe it could be won, thus any continuation would be feeble, and frankly irresponsible for nothing gained.


&gt; -France ask for reparations


France put unconditional demands on a paper and told Germany to sign it or France would keep fighting until Germany was destroyed, regardless of casualties on either side.
Germany was coerced into accepting the demands or accept the demands eventually when they actually lost the war militarily after more casualties.


&gt; -Somehow France is criminal.

You can't read what I wrote and must result in facetious jargon now?

I stated very clearly that the Versailles treaty, which most people who aren't biased will agree was criminal, those few who forced it upon Germany were indeed criminal, the conditions were unrealistic and were never possible to realize, which history again proves.


&gt; These ""international experts"" (which ones by the way ?) 


So you disagree the consensus was and still is the following:

https://daun96.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/egegergeg.png

Interesting, your idea of German serfdom as lenient and warranted is quite disturbing.


&gt; ('Others than France') did not have a frontier with Germany, the interest of the UK and US was to do business with Germany after the war, they didn't give a shit about the threat it was to France.


Do you mean they do not understand the threat of France and Germany towards each other, invading one another since the dawn of time quite equally? 


Or are you insinuating France is innocent in all of history as well, if I draw up some historical list I won't find numerous French imperialists invading among other territory, German lands?


Or do you mean the real threat that came from France refusing to stand down in a future clash between Germany and Russia.
Everyone knowing full well Russia would attack Austria-Hungary, and then France would be dragged into the war on the side of Russia.
Which would then have led to France taking the offensive on Germany instead, if Germany had military incompetents in charge, which it luckily for itself didn't.
Germany instead made a preemptive strike which was the only alternative; Outside of diplomacy, which nobody cared for other than to point fingers.


In strict military tactics Germany had to attack France the moment Russia mobilized and showed its intentions, or face war on their own soil on two fronts, in a guaranteed lost war.


The Versailles treaty puts nearly all responsibility on Germany rather than realizing the whole events were dictated by ruthless and warmongering leadership of all nations involved.


Saying Germany is largely to blame is ridiculous, you defending the Versailles treaty, promoting harsher conditions and believing the pure nationalist jargon it was created around also says much about you.

EDIT: I'll make it short.  During the Soviet Union, there was a region of SSR Azerbaijan called the [Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagorno-Karabakh_Autonomous_Oblast)  The oblast was 75% Armenian, and it wanted to join SSR Armenia.  It was gifted to Azerbaijan from Joesph Stalin in 1920, despite major opposition.  As the Soviet Union was breaking up in the early 1990s, a referendum was held, and the region declared independence from Azerbaijan.  There was a major political crisis in Azerbaijan at the time, so the military was quickly sent to reclaim Karabakh.  The Karabakh Armenians started to gather up into units and armed themselves.  Armenia later sided with Karabakh, and the Armenia-Karabakh combo won the war, and captured 7 districts outside of Karabakh, which formed todays borders.  After a generous ceasefire was signed by Azerbaijan, peace talks started.

Today Azerbaijan regularly threatens to invade Karabakh, and still spreads false information that Armenia has ""claims"" to Karabakh, and that they are ""occupying"" the region.  Azerbaijan's actions, such as the release of Ramil Safarov, or the alleged Khojaly ""genocide"" are not being justified, and their media bombards their local populations with extremely biased stories and such.  I'm baffled about how many people have never heard about this.  I encourage you to research non-government resources, such as Wikipedia if you do decide to research the conflict.

The NKR today has a permanent population, a fully function government, economy, constitution, and policies.  If you have any questions, please ask!

true,tokyoguyjean,null,null,"I'm an American living in the US and I KNOW that Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito are guilty of the murder of Meredith Kercher. Here is why: (sorry it is only in English)


PART 1 OF 3:

On the day after her murder, Meredith Kercher’s blood was found in many places in her bedroom and on a bare right-foot print on the bathroom floor mat. But no footprints were found in the 10-foot-plus stretch between those two bloody locations – all hard-surface floors in the bedroom, hallway and bathroom. In addition, after she died, Meredith’s bra had been cut off, and her body had been moved and repositioned – to make it appear she’d been raped, the police speculated. Finally, her body had been covered with a comforter. No one knew why, though various theories were offered.


This is undisputed. Although the prosecution’s “staged rape” theory was speculation, the defense, far from challenging it, took it a step further, arguing that Meredith indeed had been raped and then killed by Rudy Guede, acting alone. Guede’s DNA was found in several places in Meredith’s bedroom, including inside her body. Amanda and Raffaele could not have been there, the defense insisted, since none of their DNA was found in Meredith’s bedroom (other than Raffaele’s DNA found on Meredith’s bra clasp – more on that below).

 

Granted, Meredith’s bedroom was right next to the bathroom. But it would have required at least a 10-foot leap, with a 90-degree turn near the end, to reach the bloody bath mat from the bloody areas of Meredith’s bedroom without touching down somewhere in between. And whoever made that 10-foot leap-and-turn obviously didn’t mind leaving a bloody footprint on the bath mat when he landed. It doesn’t matter here whose bloody footprint was on the bath mat. The blood in both Meredith's bedroom and on the bath mat indisputably was Meredith’s. That’s all that matters here. What accounted for the blood-free 10-foot gap? 

A 10-foot leap-and-turn? Or perhaps the person had a blood-free left foot, on which he hopped to the bathroom so his bloody right foot wouldn’t leave any footprint along the way. When he got there, despite his careful effort to avoid leaving a bloody footprint, he stepped on the bath mat with his bloody right foot. One can imagine other possibilities, but only one stands out as plausible: More bloody footprints were made on the hard-surface floors between the two bloody
locations, but those footprints were cleaned up.

In other words, there was no 10-foot leap-and-turn, no 
blood-free-left-foot hopper who inexplicably changed his mind upon arrival and left a bloody right footprint. Originally there was blood in Meredith’s bedroom, a bloody footprint on the bath-mat, and bloody footprints on the hard-surface floors in between. Those bloody footprints were cleaned up. The bloody stain on the bath-mat was more stubborn and could only be diluted (just as Raffaele later described it). 

 
Whoever cleaned up the bloody footprints may also have moved and covered Meredith’s body – or at least knows who did. The question is obvious: Who did these things, and why would that person take such a risk?

If you came home to find a bloody murder had been committed there, would you say: “I don’t think I’ll call the police just yet. First I’ll clean up this bloody mess, reposition the victim’s body and make some other changes so it appears she was raped, and then cover her up. Sure, the police may find out about the murder from someone else, in which case they might show up and be suspicious because I’m destroying and altering evidence of a murder that I'll claim to know nothing about. But that’s a risk I’m willing to take. I just can’t stand to leave such a mess, or to leave a dead body lying in that particular position – uncovered, no less.”

Utterly implausible? I think so. Yet it’s all but certain 
that such a clean-up and body-repositioning occurred. So, again, the questions are: Who did these things, and why would that person take such a risk?


Then there’s the “burglary” in Filomena’s bedroom. Both courts that convicted Amanda concluded she had staged it, 
and Rudy Guede was not even charged. Amanda nevertheless insisted a burglary actually happened and that Guede was the burglar. That is how Guede had gotten into the house, Amanda claimed, though sometimes she speculated instead that Meredith had invited him in (an alternate explanation that naturally makes one wonder who the “burglar” was). 

 
In any event, the “burglar” was not convincing. He allegedly threw a 10-pound rock through a window 13 feet above the ground (which Meredith apparently didn’t hear), scaled a 13-foot wall in plain view from the street, climbed through the broken window without disturbing any of the broken glass spread across the windowsill, threw clothes out of Filomena’s closet onto her bed but then decided not to take anything (including jewelry, a digital camera, and a laptop in plain sight), went to Meredith's room and raped and killed her, and then ran out the front door, tracking Meredith’s blood along the way. Broken window glass was found on top of items thrown onto Filomena’s bed – on top – suggesting her window had been broken after her room was ransacked, not before. The “burglar” left no DNA, fingerprint, footprint, mud, grass stain, or any other trace in Filomena’s bedroom, on the windowsill, on the outside wall, or on the ground below. No one's DNA was found in Filomena’s bedroom – not even Filomena’s – except for Amanda’s DNA, mixed with Meredith’s blood.

 
Once again: Who carried out this real or staged burglary, and why?

I thought Germany, where I live, has about some of the lowest grocery prices. It's an extremely competitive market. Ever heard of Aldi, Penny, Lidl, ...?

Germany favors smaller stores? Some are pretty big. Behind them are huge companies like Aldi or Metro.

Years ago Walmart tried to enter the German market and failed. German competitors were having lower prices and German's were not accustomed to Walmart's culture. It's not that Walmart did not try, but they were losing money - around 3 Billion Euro.

true,tokyoguyjean,null,null,"PART 2 OF 3:

 
There is evidence of a great deal more than just a clean-up and body-repositioning. Just a few examples:

 

1. Despite the clean-up, Amanda’s DNA, mixed with Meredith’s blood, was found in five different spots in three different locations (bathroom, hallway, Filomena’s bedroom). Some was visible to the n@ked eye; some was revealed by Luminol.

 

2. Raffaele’s DNA was found on Meredith’s bra clasp. Although this is undisputed, defense lawyers blamed it on ""contamination"" (the bra clasp had lain on the floor of Meredith’s sealed-off bedroom until six weeks after the murder). But even if the evidence-collectors had sneezed on the bra clasp, and 47 different men had touched it that night, and it had been trampled by 1,000 wild horses and chewed by 98 rabid dogs in the six weeks before it was collected, no amount of contamination could have caused Raffaele’s DNA to materialize on Meredith’s bra clasp. Most Knox supporters nevertheless rely on this ""contamination"" argument to insist that no DNA of Amanda or Raffaele was found in Meredith’s bedroom.

 

3. The prosecution also argued (and the courts that convicted Amanda and Raffaele agreed) that the bloody bath-mat footprint was “consistent” with Raffaele’s footprint (though it may not have been his), and could not have been Guede’s or Amanda’s. The defense disagreed: it was Guede’s, they said. It seems that Guede’s right shoe (but not his left shoe) had come off during his scuffle with Meredith. Guede postponed his escape to wash off his right foot, which was covered with blood even though it managed to leave no footprint until Guede reached the bath mat.

For one reason or another, Guede chose not to wash off his bloody left shoe, which seems to have had a mind of its own. It left no shoeprints in the bathroom while Guede was washing his right foot, choosing instead to leave an unbroken string of bloody shoeprints in a direct line from Meredith’s bedroom to the front door. Guede’s bloody left shoe did pause once, however – just after leaving Meredith’s room, so that Guede could lock Meredith’s door from the outside. He must have done this by reaching behind his back with Meredith’s stolen room key, since Guede’s bloody shoeprints all point toward the front door, indicating he never turned around to face Meredith’s door after he'd left her room. The prosecution argued, more plausibly, that it wasn’t Guede who locked Meredith’s door – after all, he was careless enough to leave the front door wide open. Instead, Amanda or Raffaele had locked Meredith’s door after the murder, enabling them later to explain why they hadn’t discovered Meredith’s body sooner.

 
4. Amanda’s fingerprint-free bedside lamp was found on the floor at the foot of Meredith’s bed. Knox supporters say Meredith must have borrowed it without asking (Amanda said that Meredith had never asked to borrow it). Skeptics suggest the lamp was brought in to help illuminate spots to be cleaned, and was inadvertently left there when the clean-up was finished. All we know for sure is that Meredith’s room ended up with extra lighting that November evening, while Amanda’s bedroom was left with no light at all (Amanda’s room had no ceiling light – only her bedside lamp).

 

5. Amanda’s “morning after” story raises eyebrows. She testified that she came home that morning (November 2) to find her front door wide open and blood in the bathroom that hadn’t been there before. She called out to her roommates, but no one answered. She thereupon closed the front door but knowingly left it unlocked, and took a shower. When she finished, she realized she’d left her towel in her bedroom. She used the bath mat – on which she’d just noticed a bloody footprint – to “hop,” dripping wet and naked, back to her room to get her towel. Rather than dry off in her room, she ""hopped"" back to the bathroom, still wet and n@ked, on the same blood-stained bath mat, and dried off there. After returning to her bedroom, now dry but still naked, Amanda dressed, and then blow-dried her hair in the other bathroom. There she noticed an unflushed toilet (which she left unflushed) containing what turned out to be Rudy Guede’s f3ces. Though Amanda said all of this puzzled and worried her, she didn't notice that Meredith's door was locked, and she walked right past Filomena’s bedroom – at least four times – without looking in and discovering the “burglary.” Filomena's door was closed, Amanda said, and she didn't try to open it. Yet Raffaele said that when he and Amanda returned to the cottage about an hour and a half later, after breakfast, Filomena’s door was “wide open” when they walked in, and he immediately noticed the “burglary.” Neither Raffaele nor Amanda claimed to have wondered who had opened Filomena’s door in the meantime.

Even worse, recently Amanda made yet another change to her story:

Court testimony – June 12 2009
Amanda: ""I used the mat to kind of hop over to my room and into my room, I took my towel, and I used the mat to get back to the bathroom.""

According to Latvian Law on Electronic Mass Media, media must ensure that their broadcasts present true and unbiased information, encourage opinion exchange, uphold journalistic and ethical principles, and not be involved in promoting ethnic hatred, or advocate military conflicts or war. Related to that:

&gt; Latvian Media Council has concluded that RTR news reports contain unjustifiable calls to war or a military conflict and increase ethnic hate.
&gt;
The Media Council believes it is necessary to prevent violation of legitimate objectives, which is something programmes and news reports provided by RTR are said to aim for, in order to defend state security, territorial integrity and social security. In addition to that, considering the important role television plays in supplying residents with information about developments in the world, The Media Council believes there are no alternative legal mechanisms to limit RTR other than a restriction on broadcasts in accordance with Article 1 of the Electronic Mass Media Law.

6. Amanda’s other stories were no less suspicious. The day after the murder, she told the police she’d spent the entire evening and night at Raffaele’s apartment and had no idea who had killed Meredith. A few days later (under severe pressure, she insists), she told the police she’d been home after all, had invited Patrick Lumumba in, and that Lumumba had killed Meredith. The next day, in an entirely voluntary statement she wrote with no one else present, Amanda said she was pretty sure she’d been at Raffaele’s after all but nonetheless stood by her recollection that Lumumba had killed Meredith. A few days later, Amanda still remembered having been at Raffaele’s apartment, but now she was certain that Lumumba had nothing to do with the murder. (How Amanda could know anything about Lumumba’s guilt or innocence was unclear, of course, once she’d returned to her claim that she’d been at Raffaele’s apartment the whole time.) Unfortunately for
Lumumba, Amanda only told her mother this. Both Amanda and her mother neglected to mention it to the authorities, even though Amanda said they knew there was no evidence against Lumumba except Amanda’s accusation. Lumumba languished in jail for over two weeks until he came up with an airtight alibi. After Lumumba was released, Amanda said she felt terrible that the police had wrongly arrested him.

 ********************************

The clean-up and body-move were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and the judges and juries that convicted Amanda also determined that she had staged the “burglary.” Though it's possible Amanda was not the person who did those things (and also possible she was not the person who locked Meredith’s door after the murderer left Meredith’s room), inferences reasonably drawn from the clean-up and cover-up evidence, together with the ample evidence summarized above (and other physical evidence and testimony not mentioned here), solidly support the murder conviction. The burden shifted to Amanda long ago to answer the tough questions posed in this imaginary monologue:

Amanda, it’s clear that someone cleaned up after Meredith was murdered. Someone also cut off her bra and repositioned her body – to make it appear, we think, that she’d been raped. We think that person also staged a burglary so it would appear the murderer hadn't been let in by someone who lived there. Even if a burglary actually happened, as you insist, who in his right mind would risk drawing suspicion on himself by cleaning up after the murder, or by moving and covering Meredith’s body? And if he did bother to clean up, why would he ignore his own bloody footprints? Why would he pause to lock Meredith’s door with a key, and yet leave the front door wide open? It's difficult to believe you weren't involved in the clean-up and body-moving, or why you might have done those things for an innocent reason. The killer would have no reason to have done them. Obviously Meredith didn’t. No one suggests your two out-of-town roommates came back and did all this, or that a stranger wandered in off the street and did it. Who does that leave?

You, with or without Raffaele’s help. We found your DNA, mixed with Meredith’s DNA, in five different places around the cottage – including even Filomena’s bedroom, where you insist a burglary occurred. We didn’t even find Filomena’s own DNA in her bedroom, much less any trace of a burglar or anyone else – just your DNA, mixed with Meredith’s. You’ve also told several different stories about where you were that night. Sometimes you were home, sometimes you weren’t; sometimes you’re not sure. Sometimes you invited Patrick Lumumba into your cottage and he killed Meredith, sometimes you didn’t and Patrick had nothing to do with the murder; sometimes you’re not sure. Sometimes you insist Guede broke Filomena’s window and climbed in; sometimes you say Meredith must have let him in; sometimes you’re not sure. And so on. Maybe you had nothing to do with this gruesome murder, Amanda, but, frankly, we doubt seriously that you’ve told us all you know about what happened that night. Maybe it’s time you did. Better late than never.

&gt; - Ho sentito che è possibile modificare il clima e che ci sono varie aziende che vendono prodotti a questo scopo. Il Tg1 il 10 maggio 2007 ha parlato della faccenda affermando che ""sembrava una leggenda metropolitana e invece era un segreto finalmente svelato"". Si stava riferendo alle scie chimiche?

&gt; Difficile immaginare a cosa si stesse riferendo il giornalista del TG1 quando disse quella frase sulle leggende metropolitane, è probabile che abbia fatto una gran confusione. Le scie chimiche sono una teoria relativamente recente che presuppone un complotto e vari scopi di cui la modificazione climatica è solo uno dei tanti. La modificazione del tempo atmosferico (non climatica) è invece un procedimento noto da oltre 60 anni e per nulla segreto. Già diversi anni fa i coltivatori usavano i razzi antigrandine per cercare di salvare il raccolto e probabilmente non tutti facevano parte dei servizi segreti. La modificazione del tempo locale si ottiene utilizzando sali e sostanze criogeniche (ES: ioduro d'argento e azoto liquido). Il principio è quello di far condensare velocemente l'acqua contenuta in una nuvola facendola precipitare al suolo prima che provochi un temporale. I sali servono per aiutare la formazione di gocce pesanti in modo che cadano verso il suolo, mentre le sostanze criogeniche servono per congelare e far condensare l'acqua così che possa aggregarsi in gocce. Il processo è molto costoso, non sempre è efficace e non impiega sostanze tossiche. Il metodo di rilascio è pirotecnico (ovvero con cartucce esplosive o torce) ed è assolutamente impossibile da confondere con una scia di condensazione o presunte scie chimiche. 

Puo' darsi che il fenomeno che hai visto tu sia effettivamente qualcosa di simile.

Io ti dico che sinceramente non ho mai notato niente di questo genere in cielo, pero' questo non vuol dire niente. E ti dico anche che non mi sono poi appassionato cosi' tanto alla questione delle scie chimiche; ho letto quelle FAQ da cima a fondo, e gia' e' stata parecchio lunga, e poi ho letto qualche boiata qua e la. Quindi non ti saprei rispondere meglio di cosi', sorry.

Se qualcuno ne sa piu' di me, comunque, ben venga perche' sono curioso anche io.

There's lots we don't know here. Does the Latvian government rebroadcast it, or does a private company does? OP didn't make it clear. Is the Latvian government stopping the broadcast they did themselves, or are they banning a private body from broadcasting it? 

In Cyprus, the state does it. There's a piece of paper signed that says ""whatever Greece's public broadcaster is, Cyprus will rebroadcast it. And whatever Cyprus' public TV is, Greece will rebroadcast it"". 

Maybe it was like that in Latvia. Maybe it wasn't and it was rebroadcast out of convention without an agreement forcing them to. Or maybe a private company (perhaps founded by the Russian government) did. In any of the 3 scenarios, there's nothing objectionable. All 3 are common  arrangements when it comes to countries with messy demographics. 

It's not that rare. In British free-to-air plain-old antenna TV, they get 3 Irish channels, 2 Arab-affiliated channels, and 1 Russian channel. It's private companies that pay for them to be available.

It's on the Subreddit-that-shall-not-be-linked-to, so I won't give a link, but if you know the subreddit, just add /comments/1rcf3u/fun/cdmgcwo. And mind you, this comment is in the neat positives.

Seriously, this is a /r/badhistory classic, which is posted rather often, with variations from (1) ""the treaty of Versailles contributed to the rise of the Nazi, and from then to WW2"" to (2) ""the Nazi went to power literally because of the French, and they [the French] had it coming"". The whole continuum can be seen, and it can be a bit jarring. Especially because the border between history and Nazi talking points is quite thin.

I recall that the exchange started this way:

&gt;&gt; That's like saying that the Holocaust was France's fault, because of the Treaty of Versailles.

&gt; Most historians do agree that the Treaty of Versailles was one of the factors that lead to WW2.

Other people here take the (1) stance, Neredev sees that as a (2) stance (especially since the argument started as a way to minimize the ""(2) stance is false"" comment). Add a few *really* [stupid lines](http://ww.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22byef/france_pulls_out_of_rwanda_genocide_commemorations/cglfq4b)...

Hm, I hadn't seen that one, but frankly that guy is spectacularly idiotic, and even on a no-downvote (in theory) sub like that one the comment seems to have gotten 18 downvotes. 

But it isn't bad history, even if it is in /r/badhistory. It's nothing more than a simple fact that Hitler used the common post WW1 German sentiment that they were punished unfairly or too harshly. The Germans of those days saw they had little economy left and it should be no surprise that they attributed that fact to the (in their eyes) rather heavy sanctions imposed on them at the treaty of Versailles.  

Saying ""the treaty contributed"" does not mean ""the French started world war II"". It just isn't that simple. However, lets add some things. 

""Part of Hitler's rise was due to him capitalizing on anger about the poor state of Germany. The treaty contributed, in the eyes of the Germans of the time, to said poor state of the country and many felt they had been treated unfairly and were both angry and looking for a new leader to reach more prosperous times."" 

Does that mean France caused the second world war? Absolutely not. Does it however mean that the treaty of Versailles can easily be regarded as part of the causes which led to the war? Yes, absolutely. 

France is not to blame for the war, but the idea I've often seen is that had the after-war treaty been less strict, the German economy and people would have had less problems, which would have made the rise of a Hitler less likely as he'd be less wanted by the Germans. 

So; did France start world war two? Fuck no.

Allora per quanto riguarda il bias: io senz'altro lo noto di meno perché asseconda il mio bias personale profano, ma tra gli articoli online che ho scorso questi mi sembrano i più solidamente argomentati e precisi, la vis polemica/voglia di menare c'è ma non compromette la sostanza secondo me.

A proposito del dibattito sulla validità del lavoro dell'antropologo Chagnon ho trovato un resoconto davvero chiaro [qui](http://embodiedknowledges.blogspot.it/2013/03/the-chagnon-controversy-what-are-issues.html) (compreso un bel criticone a certe tendenze nella comunità degli antropologi).

Il paragrafo sui tassi di omicidi volontari illegali: [i dati a cui fa riferimento](http://www.quandl.com/society/oecd-murder-rates) non includono i tentati omicidi ma solo quelli andati a segno ([salvo eccezioni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate): ""In general the values in these lists should not include failed attempts except when mentioned otherwise."") Penso che Diamond si riferisse agli stessi dati, anche se dalla citazione non si può capire. 

Anche se quel paragrafo non è granché convincente mi sembra comunque che sollevi dei punti giusti: paragoni di questo tipo sono molto arbitrari, considerata la grande variabilità dei tassi di omicidi a livello globale e locale. Ci sono tanti fattori in gioco oltre a ""stato"" e ""violenza omicida"", anche (come fa notare wikipedia) l'effetto di un sistema sanitario più o meno efficiente nel salvare le chiappe alla gente. 

E questo senza parlare della terza obiezione a quell'esempio particolare, che l'autore ritiene ancora più importante. In sostanza il fatto che le società non-statali contemporanee non sono ""incontaminate"" e l'opinione che, per questo, non possano servire a trarre conclusioni generalizzanti sulla propensione alla violenza di tutte le società di cacciatori-raccoglitori preistoriche.

Se ti va il secondo articolo linka due pdf di Ferguson (quello che nel 1995 ha ridimensionato il significato delle ricerche di Chagnon) in cui  affronta la questione di cosa si può concludere dalle prove archeologiche sulla propensione dell'uomo a attaccar briga con i suoi simili.

Huge week. As you may or may not know, our state cabinet consists of the right wing Kokoomus-party assisted by Social Democrats and few hangers-on (Christian Democrats, Swedish People's Party, (and until recently) Left Alliance). EDIT: And the Green party!

The past few years our public spending has been percentage-point or two on the minus-side which Kokoomus has been trying to use as an excuse to dismantle the welfare state. They finally succeeded in convincing that if nothing is done RIGHT NOW we will lose our AAA-category and then our loans will suddenly all jump to 10% and Finland will join Greece. Left Alliance left the government the other week due to disagreeing to cut child benefits.

So, Keynes is out and austerity is in. 

This week we find out that no new ministers are hired to replace the leaving two Left Alliance ministers and [instead the minister responsible for Housing will take over Culture and Sports](http://yle.fi/uutiset/housing_minister_pia_viitanen_takes_on_sport_and_culture_portfolio/7171778) while [the Minister of Local Government will now also handle Transport.](http://yle.fi/uutiset/henna_virkkunen_to_take_on_transport_portfolio/7167914) Apparently this was done ""in the spirit of austerity"". It's widely believed that the Left Alliance-led change for shifting money from roads to rails will be undone. 

We also heard what is going to be cut: [student allowances, student allowance for second degree is removed, student healthcare got more expensive, student housing support is removed (in select cities)](http://yle.fi/uutiset/government_to_slash_support_for_study_towards_same-level_degrees/7175277) and [child benefits are decreased.](http://yle.fi/uutiset/finance_minister_child_benefit_cuts_to_stay/7175649) Apparently tuition fees for everybody were on the table as well, but we dodged that bullet.. this time. You may note that the benefits seem to be targeted to students and you may guess that the total savings coming from these are fairly small. 

More cuts are apparently coming after the elections next year. 

Few days after that [the Prime Minister Katainen announced that he will not be seeking to keep the chair at Kokoomus on the party elections next summer, and will instead seek something new. It's widely assumed he will try to be nominated for the President of the Council of EU or failing that, as one of the Commissars](http://yle.fi/uutiset/expert_katainens_timed_ec_bid_right/7176398). So come June, we will have a new Prime Minister. The usual suspects are also trying to get to the European Parliament, so the position of Prime Minister of Finland will essentially be regarded as a consolation prize.  

Around the same time Social Democrats are also having elections for their new chair. The current chair is running but she's widely seen as unlikely to win, meaning that our state cabinet will enter its last year staffed with understudies. 

On other news, we had our [yearly discussion if singing hyms at the school spring festival is religious activity or cultural one](http://yle.fi/uutiset/summer_hymn_can_continue_to_be_sung_in_schools/7174276).

We also had a short discussion on police uniforms.[ Police can't wear religious symbols and based on this fact they hadn't allowed muslim women to police academy](http://yle.fi/uutiset/could_finnish_policewomen_wear_headscarves/7171472). Apparently we should follow Sweden's example. 

And, to end the summary in light news: [the chair of Jewish religious communities in Finland had an interview where he said \(1.\) there doesn't need to be any laws in Finland regarding circumcision as there's already one in the Torah, (2.) but if law is needed, Jews would be ok with it it only applied to Muslims and Christians and (3.) if it also applied to Jews then it would be antisemitism and there would be an exodus out of Finland. There was also stuff about Jewish Day Care that only takes Jewish children: the boys have to be circumcised. The chair defends this position by saying that like their parents, the child can't choose the course of his life.](http://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/artikkeli/ymparileikkauskielto-ajaisi-juutalaiset-pois-suomesta/3138052).

There was still a lot of rivalry between the gendarmerie and the police, and it was just messy who had what responsibilities, authorities and territories. Then came the Dutroux case; the inability of the two forces to work together caused a lot of delays at very crucial moments (sources say Dutroux could've been identified as kidnapper many years before they eventually did), and that was the final push to reform the whole police system. They disbanded the gendarmerie and made a local and federal police, in a way better adjusted system.

The guards are the ones with special car patrols and supposed to patrol the roads and coordinate traffic safety nationwide. On cities often parking policing is delegated on a private police force for the town administration. Real police try to not get involved in that!

The gendarmerie is what is usually sent to police foreign trouble areas - timor, kosovo, but they are sent as police, just police with military resources. They do not really use that kind of equipment in everyday stuff.

&gt; The gendarmerie is what is usually sent to police foreign trouble areas - timor, kosovo, but they are sent as police, just police with military resources. They do not really use that kind of equipment in everyday stuff.
&gt; seriously, it does not make a difference what you call it or if some is more militarized or not. You kind of expect the same from either branch.

Interesting how the gendarmes can be so different in every country. Here in Romania the gendarmes only take the role as riot police or backing up the regular cops in keeping the order. Everything else, is the police's job.

All these politicians you had mentioned they DO speak Latvian, but also they speak other languages. 

Depriving people of chance to pass their cultural gene... is wrong. My notion of democracy is: that my freedom ends at the point yours starts. No one going to the school with 50% classes in Latvian will be not speaking Latvian on bilingual efficiency.

There are definitely a lot of latent (not in public) cheerleaders for great Putin - Great Russia, but my assumption is that these people are rather unhappy by their treatment IN Latvia, not really pro-Russia (as a state model). They will not do active destruction of the Latvian state, but God forbid, Russia somehow will gain Latvia... these disenfranchised people will show their worst qualities.

Latvian state should let truly bilingual citizens to grow up - they will be loyal citizens. Trying to turn all non-Latvians into Latvians in 40 years... is a folly.

Am 5. Juli 1943 begann die letzte große deutsche Großoffensive an der Ostfront. Sie wurde Unternehmen Zitadelle genannt. Das Ziel war die russische Großstadt Kursk.

Im selben Jahr kam es zu ein Bogen (?) an der sowjetischen Grenze in der Nähe von Kursk, einer Großstadt zwischen Orjol und Charkow. Der Plan war, die Gefahr einer sowjetischer Offensive in der Bogen (?) zu zerstören und eine große Menge von Gefangenen für Zwangsarbeit zu machen. Hitler und seine Kommandanten, Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein und Generalfeldmarschall Günther von Kluge, planten aus dem Norden und dem Süden mit einer klassischen Kesselschlacht anzugreifen. Die Wehrmacht bereitete mit 700.000 Soldaten, 2.500 Panzern, und 7.000 Geschützen ihren Angriff vor.

Der sowjetische Geheimdienst warnte die Militärführer vor der kommenden deutschen Offensive. Marschall Konstantin Rokossowski und Generaloberst Nikolai Watutin wurde der Befehl gegeben, Kursk zu verteidigen. Die Sowjets hatten gewaltige und komplizierte Wehranlagen errichtet, bestehend aus Bunkern, Schützengräben und über 400.000 Landminen, die von fast 2.000.000 Soldaten, 5.000 Panzern und 30.000 Geschützen verteidigt wurden.

Als die Schlacht begann, wurde das XLVII Korps der 9. Armee schon 9 km jenseits der Grenze aufgehalten. Minenfelder zusammen mit der Zähigkeit der sowjetischen Soldaten konnten sie zurückhalten.

Die Panzerarmee von Generaloberst Hoth an der Südflanke war erfolgreicher im Kampf gegen die 6. Gardenpanzerarmee. Sie führten einen Angriff mit enger Speerspitze und eroberten die Städte Butovo, Gertsovka, und Mikhailovka. Die drei Divisionen des II. SS Panzerkorps – SS Panzergrenadier Division Liebstandarte Adolf Hitler, 2. SS Panzergrenadier Das Reich, und die 3. SS Panzergrenadier Division Totenkopf - schoben sich weit in die sowjetischen Verbände hinein.

SS-Gruppenführer Paul Hausser leitete sein II. Panzerkorps an, das Dorf von Prochorowka am Morgen des 12. Juli zu besetzen. Ohne die Kenntnis des II. SS Panzerkorps plante die 5. Gardenpanzerarmee einen massiven Gegenangriff. Die sowjetischen Panzer tragen (?) Infanterie angegriffen und überraschten die deutsche Soldaten. Als der Nachmittag anbrach, war der sowjetische Panzerangriff zwar gescheitert, hatte aber einen deutschen Durchbruch nach Prochorowka gestoppt.

Hitler brach das Unternehmen Zitadelle vier Tage nach der Schlacht von Prochorowka ab. Die Alliierten waren in Sizilien gelandet und die Wehrmacht musste Truppen von der Ostfront abziehen. Das Ende der Schlacht wurde von zwei großen sowjetischen Gegenoffensiven zum Norden und Süden des Kursker Bogen begleitet.

Erstmals im Krieg hatten die Sowjets eine Großoffensive am Durchbruch gehindert. Die Rote Armee verlor 863.000 Soldaten und über 1.000 Panzer. Die Deutschen verloren etwa 305.000 Soldaten und 700 Panzer.

Von diesem Punkt im Krieg an hatten die Deutschen nie wieder die Initiative. Sie konnten sich nur zurückziehen, bis zur schicksalshaften Schlacht um Berlin. ",0,1396818436,null,0,false,0,cglp1dr,t3_22czoy,t1_cglp1dr,t3_22czoy,null,1433237684,1,false,GermanPractice,t5_2t7fs,1

true,goerz,ITAL,Italy,"I'll try to explain the situation: the Carabinieri are the military police of Italy, policing both military and civilian populations, and it's one of Italy's four armed forces (the others being the army, the navy, and the air force). The Polizia di Stato (State Police), instead, is a civilian police force. Both  Carabinieri and Polizia always carry guns, they both have elite force teams, swat teams, anti-riot teams, forensic science experts, helicopters, anti-terrorism units, etc. They essentially have the same duties and deal with the same crimes. The Carabinieri, unlike the police, are often deployed abroad (Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan), mostly for training local police forces, but they were also involved in combat. In practice, there's little difference between them, although the Carabinieri are more present in rural areas. I read that the real reason why Italy has both Carabinieri and Polizia is to make a coup more difficult, because you'd need to take control of both police forces to control the country. Being military, the Carabinieri have a reputation for being a little tougher to deal with, and somehow rigid. But in popular opinion they're also dumb and they're the butt of thousands of jokes (the equivalent of ""blonde jokes"" in the English language).",0,1396818491,null,0,false,0,cglp271,t3_22cs8g,t1_cglp271,t1_cglmeq7,null,1433237695,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

* Fidesz 44.41%
* Left Alliance 25.67%
* Jobbik 20.65%
* LMP (greens) 5.2%

Currently 10 local MP seat is leaning left, while the other 96 is going for Fidesz. Jobbik will not have 1 million voters, the difference between Jobbik and the Left Alliance is surprising: Jobbik is scoring near the highest expectation for them, while the Alliance is scoring near its projected minimum. 

Fidesz's supermajority is currently a swing, it all depends on how Miskolc No.2 voting district and Budapest No. 15 turns out (in both districts the top contenders are within hundredth of a percent of each other with the third candidate trailing them by some tenths of a percent).

Russia invaded Crimea, took it for its own, pretends it did it with the right of law and the people and has the nerve to act like it did nothing wrong.
Not only that but there have been deaths involved as well, even if it was one of the more peaceful invasions in history, it wasn't without blood, especially considering the deaths in the Maidan protests were caused by Russians.

For every election, we get ugly logos from big parties, but also from unknown parties, that get less than 0,01%. Here you can see the logos for all the parties of the previous political elections: http://www.polisblog.it/galleria/elezioni-politiche-2013-tutti-i-simboli-e-contrassegni-delle-liste-partiti/1 

I don't know from where this tradition comes from, we have always had ugly logos for the parties. Also, parties don't have a ""graphical identity"" (apart from the Democratic Party (PD) logo, the Forza Italia flag and the Five Stars Movement… stars.), so they aren't interested in having good-looking logos (again, maybe some parties, like PD, do).

For this election, you can see a particular thing: logos separated from the actual party logos. This happens because you must reach a particular threshold in order to gain a seat in the parliament, so, for example, the parties ""Centro Democratico"", ""Scelta Civica"" and ""Fare per fermare il declino"" are sure that they can't reach that percent alone, so they made a coalition, called ""scelta europea"", with an horrible logo (and I'm sure that they still won't reach that percent). You can also see this for ""Nuovo centro destra"" and ""Unione Di Centro"", they are together, with half of the NCD logo, with the name of their leader Alfano, and half of the UDC logo, with the old shield that resembles old memories.

The election logos in Italy always had the leader's name. We can see that Forza Italia always had Berlusconi, NCD has Alfano, M5S has Beppe Grillo, etc. (only PD refuses to put a name on their logo, and that's good). For this election we can still see the leader's name in the logo for Forza Italia and NCD (even if they are not candidated…), and for Scelta Europea we can see GUY VERHOFSTADT, which no one knows here in Italy, so in my opinion his name is useless. The only party that runs on a European platform is the Democratic Party (PD), they put PSE (Partito Socialista Europeo, PES) on their logo, they are strongly connected with their European party.

Elections in Italy are always fun and strange. That's not a good thing. In the logos you can see that parties are not interested in their visual identity, or in their european platform, but only in having lots of small logos into them, so they can make more people ""happy"" (oh, that's the logo of the party of the one that gave a job to my nephew, let's vote them!). A party that puts the name Berlusconi on its logo is not a party, is a one-man movement. Lots of people will vote for Beppe Grillo's M5S so they can shout and make a mess in the European Parliament. And abstention is at about 40%.

That's Italy when it comes to voting. And that's sad. But I will vote, for the first time in my life, and I can't wait!

Je répond à mon tour à OP, je suis de Paris:

1 - Les parisiens sont assez antipathiques au premier abord, mais il y en a pleins de très sympas. Il suffit de trainer dans les bons coins, pour moi c'est le nord-est de Paris mais ce n'est pas du goût de tout le monde. C'est le Paris bohème et parfois bobo. Sinon tu préfèreras peut-être les grands boulevards ou il y a beaucoup de pubs. Et si tu en as marre des parisiens, sache qu'ils sont en minorité: plus de la moitié des gens à Paris n'y sont pas né, voire encore plus, et toutes les nationalités y sont représentées, donc tu peux te créer ton propre Paris à ta mesure! 

2 - Chateau et bière, je ne sais pas trop... Des chateaux, il y en a un peu partout en France (et en Europe), et surtout le long du fleuve Loire. La très bonne bière, c'est plutôt dans le nord de la France, près de la Belgique et de l'Allemagne. Sinon, dans toute la France, tu trouveras souvent de la 1664, de la Kro, de la Pelforth, qui sont les bières nationales. Rien de spécial si tu es un amateur de bonne bière. 

3 - Les femmes françaises, je n'y comprend rien! Mais tu auras une autre approche en tant qu'étranger, et tu seras peut-être exotique pour elles... En tout cas les parisiennes ne sont pas les plus faciles à aborder, car elles sont très sollicitées et elles se protègent un peu... J'ai vécu à Montpellier et j'ai trouvé ça beaucoup plus cool pour aborder les gens en général (et donc les filles en particulier).

I never said it was introduced, but I did say it was maintained and manipulated to their favor. 

And of course there was decreased violence. You pit a bunch of people who hate each other and want to kill each other, than keep the peace. They can't rise up to fight you because they hate each other. 

Dude...this shit is like Divide and Conquer 101....or did you think a bunch of small European countries no bigger than some U.S. states were able to conquer most the world by sheer military might and numbers? 

Oh, and what happens when you suddenly leave and those two groups who hated each other no longer have a strong-man keeping them from each other? Well, they usually slaughter each other and a strong man gains power. 

&gt;Please don't say shit like that, it makes you seem very arrogant.

&gt;The Europeans decolonialized because their mentality and economic means had changed. American 'insistence' had very little to do with it.

Actually, it's not arrogant. 

It's completly accurate. 

Are you forgetting about the [Suez Canal Crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis)? The so-called *""Death Nail""* of colonialism? Or the moves Franklin Roosevelt made to get Winston Churchill, the Imperialist himself, to acknowledge [the principles of de-colonization](http://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/atlantic-conf) in exchange for American aid and support during WWII? 

I mean, it's a rather well-accepted notion just how hard it [pushed it's Western allies to dismantle their colonial empires](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization#United_States)? 

We did this not only because it was in our national interests economically and militarily, but also because we were in a fierce competition with the Soviet Union to win over the newly-independent regions. 

&gt;I doubt there were any Frenchmen and/or Belgians encouraging genocide in any way.

&gt;You know, what makes people over here so mad is the fact that Kagame is most likely the one that instigated everything, as he is almost certainly the one that organized the murder of the sitting president. The fact that it's him blaming 'us' for HIS genocide is what's so infuriatingly hypocritical.

Well it depends, many here supported the Irish uprising for independence, the recent Ukrainian uprising and a number of other revolts, but when talking about a African rebel group which had not only just shaken off colonial oppressors, but now had ethnic oppressors, they're in the wrong? 

The death of the President might've been the spark, but you don't pick up your machete and murder your neighbor without a *little* tension going on before that. 

I mean....would you say a Jew caused the holocaust if he killed Hitler in the 1930s, but it still happened anyway? Personally, compared to the other African leaders, he seems to be pretty god damn competent and able, and to top it off, well-liked by both ethnic groups in a country only twenty-years fresh from a massive genocide.

I even showed you examples of how parties who are 5% or 10% of the electorate in France manage to shape things alot. Something they wouldnt do if they had to be junior members of larger parties.

I dont know, for me it seems quite obvious that a system in which a coalition is needed and different parties are forced to work with each other has more ideological plurality. And I imagine most people would agree with me too. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To address your primaries example. You know what will happen? Ofcourse both democratic candidates will support black policies. You are going to have a disadvantage if you dont. But this is just ""support"". Democrats already have the black vote. They dont need to fight for it. You see what I mean? This means its going to be some token policies for black people. 

In the reverse situation, a few leaders of the Black party will be elected to high positions if the Democrats win the election. And they will make sure their policies are respected, if not they quit the government. Thats what the Greens in France did- they are less than 5%. 12% of the electorate is HUGE. They would have so much more influence in this situation. 

If there was a ""Black"" Party. And to win an election, Democrats HAVE to co operate with them. You dont see how that gives the Black party more influence on the decisions of the Democrats? I dont know to me it seems pretty obvious


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And Im not saying primaries dont allow plurality in ideology. They do. But to the extent of having seperate parties that can throw their weight around to influence policies... Really thats not convincing atall.

&gt;However, many nationalist men found it unacceptable to fight against the Soviet Union for Germany. They tried to find a third way, fleeing to Finland to avoid the German mobilisation and joining the army there. Escapes increased in spring 1943, when secret mobilisations into the German army started. In February 1944, the Estonian volunteers formed the 200th Infantry Regiment in the Finnish army (JR 200), with about 2000 men; about 400 Estonians additionally served in the Finnish navy. In August 1944, most of them (the Finnish Boys) returned home, invited by nationalist circles in order to fight the approaching Red Army.

Côté bouquins, c'est vite aride à lire, c'est vrai. Deux pistes cependant :
- les biographies permettent de découvrir une période via un personnage, ce qui rend la lecture plus sympa. Attention aux choix des auteurs : prendre de vrais historiens, pas Max Gallo ou Laurent Deutsch. 
- les Que-Sais-Je sont très bien faits : en 128 pages très claires, tu apprends l'essentiel. 
- la revue L'Histoire est top, mais pourquoi pas Historia.
