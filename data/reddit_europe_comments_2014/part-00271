true,salutame_a_soreta,null,null,"io utilizzo il modello delle 6c, messo a punto in anni e anni di coabitazione, 7 traslochi e centinaia di appartamenti/camere visitate.

PREMESSA FONDAMENTALE: vai a condividere una CASA con altre persone; la tua camera è solo UNA parte (importante) della casa, ma non l'unica da valutare.

di seguito le 6C, in ordine di importanza per me:

* Coinquilini: trovare quelli che più siano affini è complicato, ma non impossibile. Cerca di capire che stile di vita abbiano e se può andarti a genio. Se lavori, fossi in te eviterei studenti e viceversa. Punto spesso sottovalutato è l'affidabilità/serietà: indaga su come vengono gestite le situazioni tipo pagamento affitto/bollette/spese comuni e se ci sia già in essere qualche regola. L'ultima cosa che vuoi sentire (oltre al casino alle 4 di notte) è ""Tizio è andato via senza pagare affitto/bollette/spese comuni, dobbiamo pagare noi."", soprattutto se c'è un contratto e non vai a nero.

* Camera: questo punto è molto soggettivo. Trova qualcosa che sia in linea con le tue aspettative in termini di spazio, luminosità, rumore, mobilio e posizione all'interno della casa. Special mention per il letto: PROVALO! che sia comodo! cattivo sonno=cattivo umore=vita di merda.

* Cesso: oltre al fatto che a mio parere il bathroom-to-flatmates ratio non dovrebbe mai superare il threshold di 1:3, è importante che funzioni TUTTO e BENE, a cominciare dalla doccia! Pare una banalità, ma dopo un anno trascorso a farmi la doccia praticamente col contagocce, ho capito l'importanza di una doccia sistemata nell'economia del viversaniebelli. In addition, meglio un bagno finestrato che uno cieco, per ovvi motivi.

* Condizioni generali dell'appartamento: che sia ragionevolmente dignitoso o comunque in linea con i tuoi desiderata.Gli elettrodomestici principali DEVONO funzionare bene. Una lavatrice anni '70 non è vintage, è una merda. Personalmente, faccio molta attenzione al piano cottura in cucina e non solo perchè mi piace molto cucinare. Assicurati che ci sia il blocco di sicurezza per il gas ai fornelli; il passo tra ""coinquilino sbadato"" e ""crolla palazzina in Via XXX per gas lasciato aperto"" è molto più breve di quanto si immagini.

* Comodità: dell'abitazione in senso lato. Vicinanza al posto di lavoro o studio, raggiungibilità con i mezzi e presenza di supermercato nelle adiacenze sono sicuramente punti importanti.

* Costo: fai un giro sui vari bakeka, kijiji ecc ecc per renderti conto dei prezzi di mercato della città/zona prescelta e fissa un budget (consiglio, fissalo tenendo presente anche delle spese ESCLUSE dall'affitto) Vai a vedere qualcosa anche fuori-budget, in modo da poter fare i giusti paragoni.

Oh and for the records, roomba sales ARE exploding. And the argument here is that workers have to accept less than the buying price of a roomba to ""have a job"" or enjoy no income. WTF ?

&gt; That's the beauty of the free-market

No it's not a free market since one group has the monopoly of cash and is bribing the government to cash-starve the entire population and use it to force workers into submission at their conditions.

&gt; Because in the end it's the ones who do honest labour who will end up paying for it. 

ahhh. the ""honest labour"" argument i keep hearing about. The one coming from people who built their life stealing their employees wage and who never work a day they don't want; the one coming from the religious billionaires who keep saying how the africans are ""sinners who deserve their poverty and ebola"". 

Fuck you, holier-than-thou asshole.

Money isn't distributed by ""honesty"". Some assholes are born in the lucky zone (rich family, area, good school area, opportunity area, ...), took it all then used it to bribe govs to get some more. Then use their entire life to ensure they get it all and nobody else that isn't out of their social group. You know how it used to be called once ago ? Nobility. Let me enlight you how it ends.

It took the broadest definition of underage grooming, describing it as any situation where a child or young person receives something in exchange for performing sexual favours.

&gt;The centre identified 2,379 potential offenders who had been reported for grooming since 2008. The vast majority were men. Most were aged 18 to 24. It could fully identify only 940 of the suspects. Of these, 38 per cent were white, 32 per cent were recorded as of unknown ethnicity, 26 per cent were Asian, 3 per cent were black and less than 1 per cent were Chinese.

""Asian"" is typically used to describe Desi people in the UK. It's typically used as a code word in place of Pakistani Muslim.

The Germans tried to borrow a lot of Norse mythology during the occupation, which leads to a whole lot of fun with Neo-Nazi organizations in Norway adapting ""Odinism"" or other confused misappropriations of Old Norse Paganism as part of their creed. 

At the same time, parts of the Black Metal scene also has latched onto a lot of the Pagan symbolism. Some with genuine historic insight, and some approaching it with a quite muddled view of what it is all about.

And then you have some genuine Paganists or Neo-Paganists, who are actually into the entire old pantheon thing, wihtout buying into the metal-scene or the Neo-Nazi scene. 

And of course your everyday man who likes symbols of Norwegian cultural heritage, without necessarily buying into one scene or another.

That's true and no one is arguing otherwise. The question is more along the lines of ""How many people should you have to support?""

For example: I'm 26. I've paid around $500,000 USD in taxes - enough for any service I've gotten and the services of a pretty significant number of people. So my sense of what is owed to society...well, it's a bit more limited than many would expect. I still pay because I have to, but any sense of debt to society is pretty much expired.

Yet again, no one is arguing for no taxes at all. Also: In practically every 1st world country the employer is already paying for health care via taxes or directly.

I don't think you should need to insta source (given the context of this subreddit) a commonly held belief that can be substantiated by you doing a 5 second google search of TTIP but I will save you the bother.

&gt;Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) is an instrument that allows an investor to bring a case directly against the country hosting its investment, without the intervention of the government of the investor’s country of origin.[61] In December 2013, a coalition of over 200 environmentalists, labor unions and consumer advocacy organizations on both sides of the Atlantic sent a letter to the USTR and European Commission demanding the investor-state dispute settlement be dropped from the trade talks, claiming that ""Investor-state dispute settlement is a one-way street by which corporations can challenge government policies, but neither governments nor individuals are granted any comparable rights to hold corporations accountable.""[62][63]

Legally speaking, they had a binding vote on the issue already and independence lost by a huge margin as it was part of the constitutional referendum.

You're right, Catalonia voted in favor of the Spanish constitution by a huge margin 40 years ago. Catalonia is also historically an integral part of Spain and the Kingdom of Spain for many centuries. A dynastic marriage between Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon united Spain in the 15th century.

&gt;  However the idea that a simple 50%+1 referendum can overturn a constitutional principle is just crazy. The whole point is that a constitution is much more difficult to change than just being slightly more popular in any given moment.

&gt; The whole thing to me is an exercise in showing exactly how populism shouldn't behave in front of rational governments. And the whole fundamental question of what it means to be a constitutionally supreme government.

Yes the constitution should be very difficult to change. A vote should be a considerable majority by all people of Spain with a high turnout, not just Catalonia.

&gt; Note that the Scottish case is VERY different because UK has parliamentary sovereignty and lacks a constitution.

What is the point you are trying to make? As far as i'm aware the tasks still has to be done, it's just that it takes less time now.

&gt; Oh and for the records, roomba sales ARE exploding. And the argument here is that workers have to accept less than the buying price of a roomba to ""have a job"" or enjoy no income. WTF ?

Look at it this way. As far as i see it the roomba only vacuums the floor. There is still other tasks to be done. Actually washing the floor and everything that isn't the floor itself. But since vacuming now takes less time, you can wash more in the same time. This means you can serve more clients than before. Now this obviously means that prices of cleaning services will go down, making businesses and people who previously couldn't affort the service able to. A whole new market opens. It's just like the IT sector, while it removed a lot of jobs, a whole lot of new jobs were created.

Fuck you, holier-than-thou asshole.

Honest labour is everyone who participates in the job market. If this involves flipping burgers, paving roads or being a CEO doesn't matter. I don't know how you got the idea that i was talking about only the employers.

&gt; Money isn't distributed by ""honesty"". Some assholes are born in the lucky zone (rich family, area, good school area, opportunity area, ...)

You are totally correct. Which is why we should spend tax money on building good neighborhoods, schools, hospitals etc instead of just giving people money.

A majority have wanted a public option true, if not a strong one. As much as I think natl single payer would be very problematic in the US, I'd agree that it wasn't fair that the Rockefeller amendment was shot down. But I'm not seeing where you're pulling that 14% from.

&gt;In 20 years, we wont have the middle class that we do now due to automation. There needs to be much more recognition of and preparation for that future. 

Not sure I'd agree. In the long run people adjust to automation, and disemployment effects are minimal. The US would look very different today if that wasn't true. But there are many factors that affect wage levels, and I'm not sure automation is one of the biggest ones. There is loss of unskilled work due to changes in consumer preferences for example. And as supporters of an increased minimum wage have had to consistently point out, automation is no direct substitute for human work esp in jobs that depend on interpersonal skills and dexterity.

That's a pretty in-depth question, but suffice it to say in the US the government has never really spent money helping the middle class, so the decimation of the middle class has little to do with tax revenue.

Our government helps the very poorest and the very richest, nothing in between. The things you'd think of them doing in Europe that help? They don't exist here and never have. That money goes to the military here. So if we're trying to frame this as a pivot, taxes are probably not the cause of the decimation of the middle class.

&gt;Are the wealthy magically earning more as they all started working harder......Please don't give me that.

It depends entirely on the individual in question. Some make money through stocks and whatnot, some make it through their position in a company...you're going to have to be more specific.

&gt;Personally I think it's all because of the fact America is simply an oligarchy now with a nice coat of democratic paint. 

Yes, so what are you expecting here? By giving more money to the oligarchy that runs our government that money is going to make it to the middle class or the poor? Fat chance.",0,1410718263,null,0,false,0,cki52ew,t3_2gd2hi,t1_cki52ew,t1_cki47ev,null,1427015367,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

You can attack someone for reasons other than the group they belong to e.g. they spilled a drink on you in the bar would not be a hate crime. 

Attacking someone because of the group they belong to is demonstrably worse than attacking someone for some other reason like the one given. It instills fear in the community they belong to. It will likely cause more emotional damage to the person who was attacked and so on. On that basis, the punishment should be harsher to match the fact that the crime was worse. 

The flaw in your reasoning is assuming that every crime must be a hate crime because everyone belongs to some subgroup of the population. That's true but it's not the case that every crime is committed BECAUSE of that. That's why you've arrived at a ridiculous conclusion.

Politicians from the UMP are already turning their backs on the people they supported after Sarkozy's failure and departure, like François Fillon (arguably one of the less worse choices if we're talking about honesty).

Personnally, I hope that Sarkozy will end up in jail or deprived of his civic rights before the election because of one of his numerous affairs. It's kind of a race against the clock.

They are not done by anyone but a mechanic. Like the roomba. those jobs don't exist anymore. Asking servants to accept a non living wage to stay instead of those would be seen as an insult. Yet we ask those from workers of other jobs to accept unsurvivable wages anyway ?

&gt;  As far as i see it the roomba only vacuums the floor. There is still other tasks to be done. 

Should humanoid smart bots walk in you're going to look like a fool.

&gt; This means you can serve more clients than before

Nobody is asking anyone to come vacuum in nowadays. They all do it themselves.

&gt; making businesses and people who previously couldn't affort the service able to. 

Or, really, nobody has servants nowadays except a so ridiculously small percent that's so negligible it might has well not exist. 500y ago it was like a family on 10.

&gt; Honest labour is everyone who participates in the job market. If this involves flipping burgers, paving roads or being a CEO doesn't matter.

That's the part you are not figuring out. Soon there won't be a ""job market"". There will be do-it-all robots, and nobody will have to do anything (ok maybe 20/30% people will work). So either, you 1°) pay them to stay home or 2°) they have zero income, for their entire life. What do you think is going to happen in the second case ? At best, mafia smugglers and drug money takes over everywhere. That's what's happening in south america, africa and russia.

&gt; instead of just giving people money. 

We give ~~billions~~ trillions to banksters who openly fraud everything, we give ~~billions~~trillions in subsidies to every big corps under the sun, yet giving a few bucks to the citizens is impossible ? you are either a fool, deluded or one of the biggest hypocrits around.

&gt; There are some good and some bad,

Yes i'm sure there were some good nobles. It ended so well there was a bloody revolution in the entire european world when peasants were tired of having no income and nothing while others were parading in castles.

I think part of the issue is that as the world becomes more connected, ""headquartered"" doesn't mean much, and most multi-national companies have multiple governments that all want the same money.

If you're Google and you're based in the US, sell advertising to someone in Sweden, have an assigned sales person to that client in the UK, and the credit card is processed in Ireland, which country gets to claim that income?

If you ask the UK it would be the UK, if you ask Ireland it would be Ireland, and if you ask the US, it would be the US...but ultimately what determines it is the structure of the company. So no matter how they do it, they're going to piss off practically everyone involved.

As usual a huge number of violations by kremlin's candidates is observed even before the official election day, and police/investors/prosecutors do nothing about it. Some opposition candidates were blocked by 'regional filter' designed specifically for that. Many of others are denied by TV stations to broadcast their promotions for made up reasons. State workers and students in state Universities were forced to vote earlier than today and often were guided to make them choose a 'right' candidate. In major cities all the voters received personal letters from kremlin's candidates which violated a number of personal information laws. Markets' owners were forced to display 'right' promotions by intimidation. Children in state schools got gifts with political promotions for their parents. Many promotions were illegally organized using regional/city budget or property. Majority of voters saw promotions of only one candidate in their region. So nothing special and just as usual. As a result nobody believes in fairness of these elections, I intentionally went to vote 10 minutes before the closing and on my dual page in a list of voters I was 6's who voted out of 20 who had to.

Instead they will keep on piling hate on the Sverigedemokraterna, and adress anyone expressing the slightest concern over the immigration issue as a ""racist"".

Asking servants to accept a non living wage to stay instead of those would be seen as an insult. Yet we ask those from workers of other jobs to accept unsurvivable wages anyway ?

Where am i saying that we are going to pay them a non livable wage? 

&gt; Should humanoid smart bots walk in you're going to look like a fool.

As far as i see it we are not quite there yet and will not be for several decades.

&gt; Nobody is asking anyone to come vacuum in nowadays. They all do it themselves.


It's more common than you think. Especially businesses that has large floor areas. If you have ever worked in retail you would understand that there is demand for it.

&gt; Or, really, nobody has servants nowadays except a so ridiculously small percent that's so negligible it might has well not exist. 500y ago it was like a family on 10.

Take a look in to office buildings in the evening and you will be proved wrong.

&gt; That's the part you are not figuring out. Soon there won't be a ""job market"".

That's what people have said for years and years and years. When modern farming equipment became the norm people also said it would leave them with no jobs. Then the industry came and people said the same. There will alwats be demand for wage labour. Heck, i live in Norway where we have a shortage of workers. When the rising middle class in China and India want their consumer goods and services this will only increase demand in the job market.

&gt;  There will be do-it-all robots, and nobody will have to do anything (ok maybe 20/30% people will work). So either, you 1°) pay them to stay home or 2°) they have zero income, for their entire life. What do you think is going to happen in the second case ? At best, mafia smugglers and drug money takes over everywhere. That's what's happening in south america, africa and russia.

Can i borrow your crystal ball? I would love to be able to predict the future. 

&gt; We give billions trillions to banksters who openly fraud everything, we give billionstrillions in subsidies to every big corps under the sun, yet giving a few bucks to the citizens is impossible ? 

We give banks billions, but they pay it back with interest. In the end we actually benefited from it. Also the large fines the banks have gotten doesn't count?

Subsidies are necessary in some sectors. In the end it actually benefits the average person because it means cheaper food and energy.

Yes, the citizens get absolutely nothing. No roads, no schools, no social security, no healthcare and no unemployment benefits. Where the hell do you live? It's not a modern western nation that's for sure.

&gt; you are either a fool, deluded or one of the biggest hypocrits around.

Ah yes, personal insults. Makes you look good doesn't it?

Sì, hai centrato in pieno la cosa. Il problema è il fascino di quel sottile confine misterioso fra un trollazzo da gara e il caso umano.
Le due fazioni, credulons e scetticazzi, altro non erano che un paravento per patologie psichiatriche da manuale, da ambo le parti.
Io, pur essendo schierato fra gli scettici, spesso mi divertivo a trollare il mio gruppo. Il mio obiettivo preferito, lo ammetto, era Albion.
Uhm.
Eri tu?

&gt; A me pero', da full-time IDFer e IDLer a tempo perso, piaceva la scaramuccia stilistica di IDL.

Lo ammetto, alcune trovate erano geniali e, alle volte, mi sono trovato anche io attaccato allo schermo a fare F5 su IDL.

&gt; La rovina di IDL sono stati i raduni (cosi' come anche quella di IDF, ma in un modo diverso). Una volta diventati AMICI e imbolsitisi nella routine, gli IDLers si slinguazzavano sul NG e l'unico divertimento era pestare di malavoglia il kook di turno che provava a mettersi i guantoni.

Che storia strana. Mai avrei detto che un gruppo su usenet potesse accordarsi per fare un raduno.  
Avrei scommesso di più sul fatto che il ""castagno secolare"" sprizzasse di energie positive.

&gt; IDU languisce, ma IDM va avanti. Facci un giro, anche da lurker come faccio io, magari quattro risate te le fai ancora.

Seguo il consiglio.  
Sto scaricando 40tude.

&gt; P.S: ""tardone sfatte"", prego.

Ora che mi hai sommerso di ricordi e mi hai quasi portato alle lacrime attendo con timore la tua risposta.  
Che altro potrei aspettarmi da un IDLer? ;)

Your point is clear, but wrong. In this world that we live in, independent nationalism or statehood is primarily achieved *specifically* through conquest and subjugation. The English state's oppression of the Irish doesn't delegitimize the English state, does it? If it did, then surely the extermination of the American Indian or the enslavement of millions of Africans by European settlers in America, would also delegitimize the United State of America, would it not? 

Subjugation and genocide are not nice things, but they certainly do not taint the legitimacy of independent nationalism. No matter how awful they may be. That is, of course, unless you wouldn't apply the same rules and principles to others as you have yourself.

true,argh523,SWIT,Switzerland,"&gt; That absolutely is not the case though. A Hate Crime is one where the victim is chosen specifically because of their belonging to a particular sub-group. You can attack someone for reasons other than the group they belong to e.g. they spilled a drink on you in the bar would not be a hate crime. 

Of course.

&gt; Attacking someone because of the group they belong to is demonstrably worse than attacking someone for some other reason like the one given. 

It is? If someone is violent and attacks people for no good reason, it's not as bad as if he did it because of a baias? The job of a judge, besides determining if a crime was committed, is to hand out appropriate punishments. There are minium and maxium sentences for different things for consistency, to ensure things aren't too arbitrary, and more serious crimes are punished more severely. But there's always gray areas. Hate crimes are an additional layer that can come into play if someone spills his beer intentionally, up to murder. The motivation should flow into the severity of the punishment, but the motivation *itself* can't be a crime. Beeing racist, homophobic or whatever isn't illegal.

&gt; It instills fear in the community they belong to. It will likely cause more emotional damage to the person who was attacked and so on. On that basis, the punishment should be harsher to match the fact that the crime was worse. 

Beeing attacked can leave a lot of emotional damage, or not, regardless of wheter or not the motivation of the attack had anything to do with your physical properties, belives, or ideological leanings. I mean, think this one through for a second. The best counterargument presented to me so far is ""it's not just minorities, it's certain properties, regardless if the victim belongs to the minority or not, and it's getting better because when people like emos get attacked it's now treated as a hate crime"". Now, what if some punks attack a neo-nazi because of his belives? There is no consistent argument you can make to demonstrate that this *isn't* a hate crime. If it was just a minor thing, the judge, if he's doing his job right, would now have to hand out a higher minimun scentence because it's a hate crime. The opposite example is the one I mentioned already, where something that isn't a hate crime gets equal or lesser punishment than a potentially less brutal crime that happend to be motivated by something else than just enjoying violence. Think of the gangs beating up people for fun. Because they did it *for fun*, the judge has potentially a lower ceiling of how hard he can punish those bastards.

Again, the better your hate crime laws get, the less they actually mean anything, besides higher possible sentences, but you still have to deal with weird unintended consequences. And if you get around those, you're basically back at the situation you had before you put the first hate crime laws on the books. 

&gt; The flaw in your reasoning is assuming that every crime must be a hate crime because everyone belongs to some subgroup of the population. That's true but it's not the case that every crime is committed BECAUSE of that. That's why you've arrived at a ridiculous conclusion.

I'm putting this one down to me not explaining myself very well. When I said ""But once virtually anything is a hate crime..."", I meant once every category people can be put into and attacked for are written into the law (which will of course never happen).",0,1410724837,null,0,false,0,cki8ijt,t3_2gadj5,t1_cki8ijt,t1_cki52in,null,1427013747,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Because shit job are already minimal wage. If you go below, it means you are suppressing minimal wage. Which is already very short for survival.

&gt; As far as i see it we are not quite there yet and will not be for several decades.

Uuhhhh don't bet on it.

&gt; It's more common than you think. Especially businesses that has large floor areas. If you have ever worked in retail you would understand that there is demand for it.

In most countries businesses uses their ""usual"" ""jakes of all trades"" employees who also do cashier, fill in the shell, ... they pay nobody on top of it. They just toss the job at the employees hanging around, and if he disagree he or she is fired. ""get out i have 200 more applicants waiting to replace you who won't bitch about it"".

&gt;  Heck, i live in Norway where we have a shortage of workers. 

Because norway has a very strong welfare and worker rights system that prevent employers treating employees like shit, tossing them away without pay ""because they didn't looked down when asked"" or stuff like this ? So the economy is a lot better; unlike in most 1st world states like UK. 

&gt; When the rising middle class in China and India want their consumer goods and services this will only increase demand in the job market.

Foxconn is already automatizing their factories to end their recurrent slavery scandale...And a lot of the chinese economy run around the mafia or the bribery network system.

&gt;  but they pay it back with interest.

After having falsified their account to generate a ton more cash, and doing negative percent borrowal to the FED, then embezzling mexican mafias funds to ensure they have proper margins like HSBC is doing ?

Yeah, like the general population that wants to survive.

&gt; In the end it actually benefits the average person because it means cheaper food and energy.

true,christ0ph,UNSA,Pangea,"I don't see any basis for your characterization as neoliberal ""values"" as ""pragmatic"" I see them as based on an agenda that depends on deceiving the public as to its true goals which are ultimately destructive and dare I say it, parasitic in that they take from society without giving back what is necessary to sustain society into the future. The reason these FTAs are being pushed, with their long list of power grabs and artificially contrived and inherently alien *corporation-""rights""* which limit *human* society's ability to control its own destiny - is an act of desperation by a narrow segment of society- A segment that is becoming more and more isolated and arrogant. (Hurting itself in the process, as well as others.) 
 This power grab is undertaken as a larger and larger segment of society is beginning to be aware of what's been happening and its ultimate destination if the neoliberal proponents of these antidemocratic ""values"" are left to take over and destroy democracy all around the world.

I think implicit in that agenda is a subconscious desire on the part of those who espouse the neoliberal agenda to be stopped. Because in the final analysis, its whats best for everybody. Even them.  Their quality of life will improve along with everybody elses in a world where democracy is understood to be a core value. Neoliberals claim to be for a globalized society but the fact is they seek to divide and conquer. ironically, the people they are seeking to exploit are finding common ground. Because giving is fundamentally a win-win situation. So, the neoliberals would be wise to back off, then, the positive parts of their vision might come true on their own. 

But on the whole planets terms, not theirs, which are as I said, unsustainable.

We should all focus on meeting the biggest challenges we've ever faced which is navigating the social implications of the exponential growth in technology.. which can be thought of as humanity coming of age, humanity difficult adolescent years..our transition into adulthood..

Which is at its core making this coming economic transition away from the need for everybody to work, to a society based on responsible abundance and the quest for knowledge, where humanity recognizes its responsibility as stewards of this planet not just for itself but for all the living things that live here.

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. 

That's the real  recipe for survival and growth.

Maybe unionizing could be a start? Do something instead of feeling sorry for yourself.

&gt; Businesses uses their ""usual"" ""jakes of all trades"" employees who also do cashier, fill in the shell, ... they pay nobody on top of it.

It's usually franchaises that has to use the employees for everything because their profit margins are low. I know this pretty well since i've experienced this first hand. In my town i worked at the only one of the grocery stores that were francaised. Because of this we couldn't afford to rent someone to clean the store, so we had to do it ourself. The other stores where owned by the company themselves, and had dedicated cleaners. If cleaning were cheaper, maybe franchaise owners also start to hire cleaners?

&gt; Because norway has a very strong welfare and worker rights system that prevent employers treating employees like shit, tossing them away without pay ""because they didn't looked down when asked"" or stuff like this ?

Because we didn't sit there and felt sorry for ourself and cried for the state to help us from the evil corporations. Instead we fought for our rights and now has very good laws for both the employer and employee.

&gt; So the economy is a lot better.

The Eurozone disagrees.

&gt; Foxconn is already automatizing their factories to end their recurrent slavery scandale...

The factories in China has lifted millions upon millions of people out of poverty. Now they have to stay competitive since western companies move their production back to their home countries since it's not profitable to produce in China any more. Maybe China for ones will start inventing their own stuff instead of manufacturing blueprints from the west?

&gt; After having falsified their account to generate a ton more cash, and doing negative percent borrowal to the FED, then embezzling mexican mafias funds to ensure they have proper margins like HSBC is doing ?

The main thing is always about being exposed to the language. I was lucky enough to already have friends from Germany who are into similar things as me, so once I was competent enough to hold a conversation, we could play games in co-op mode while practising my German or just Skype/get on TeamSpeak and talk about random stuff.

For the actual test it really helped that I found a bunch of sample tests and solved them. That was especially helpful to get acquainted with the format. The speaking test and the writing parts take some getting used to, especially the speaking part, since you have to speak for a predetermined amount of time.

The reading and listening parts were pretty easy after all the articles and exposure to actual dialogs among natives.

I would therefore recommend two things:

&gt; Because of this we couldn't afford to rent someone to clean the store, so we had to do it ourself. 

It's not that they can't afford it, it's that *they don't care*. If they can force an employee to do it for free on top of his or her job, they will do so and keep the difference in their pocket.

&gt; Because we didn't sit there and felt sorry for ourself and cried for the state to help us from the evil corporations. 

I'm not in the business of sitting and doing nothing but let's say i got burned a bit for doing a bit much in the last few years. Uh something about collateral damage. So i'm prolly going to wait till everything is totally FUBAR and let stuff run it's course before deciding, to ensure i'm not totally wrong.

And used chained slaves. Which caused big scandals. And those weren't lifted out of anything.

they're already starting. Which is why we should move back some critical lines, i think. (*Real men have fabs. (c) Jerry Sanders, AMD*)

Yeah i'm pretty disillusionned of that one. Honestly, there's not much to save there apart maybe a few Eurozone ones. In the US they're all rotten to the core, to the last.

There is so little money in circulation for end users (consumers) we're looking at massive short term deflation. Tax breaks make sense when people still have enough money to pay said taxes.

Circa una volta al mese, o quando sentivo appiccicoso sotto le suole delle scarpe. Della cera, so solo che fa scivolare.

Spying Together: Germany's Deep Cooperation with the NSA

Cooperation between Germany's foreign intelligence service, the BND, and America's NSA is deeper than previously believed. German agents appear to have crossed into constitutionally questionable territory.

Non tanto per le cazzate e per le risposte, o meglio le non risposte, visto che ci sono molte, anzi moltissime risposte non esaustive alle domande fatte su molti argomenti abbastanza importanti a livello economico, sparate recentemente dalle due campagne elettorali, ma piú che altro per un fattore culturale e sociale. 

Da Italiano mi sono trovato molto meglio in Scozia che in Inghilterra, la gente in media é piú caciarona, umile e molto alla mano, invece con gli inglesi, per dirla alla maniera Inglesa:  ""I wouldn't even piss on them if they were on fire"". Sono pochi quelli che non si sono rivelati una massa di ignoranti e arroganti.

Arroganza che si é vista anche la settimana scorsa quando, con i risultati che davano il Yes vote in vantaggio per la prima volta, sembra quasi gli Inglesi abbiano scoperto per la prima volta che in Scozia si voterá il 18. E allora subito tutti ai ripari con goffi tentativi di riprendere le redini con proposte di Max Devolution e piú poteri e autonomia al parlamento Scozzese. Stupenda poi l'ideona (respinta da quasi tutti i comuni) di quella merda di Milliband di far svolazzare la bandiera Scozzese sugli edifici dei comuni Inglesi e Gallesi per ""solidarietá"", ideona che ha avuto l'apice di goffaggine (o goffezza?) quando a Downing street hanno deciso di issare una bandiera Scozzese, che, quasi per voler Divino, si é staccata ed é svolazzata via proprio mentre veniva issata.

 * A she-bear named Daniza that injured a man was the object of a extended capture campaign. The bear was originally used to repopulate bears in Italy, but lately it had begun getting to close to towns and killing sheep. The bear was captured and sedated, but an adverse reaction to the anesthetic killed her, leaving two orphan cubs. ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE, as EVERY single politician, mayor, secretary, singer, hipster or hobo needed to denounce the horrible cruelty that was perpetrated upon the innocent bear due to the ruthless and merciless action of the Trento province administration. Conspiracy theories that could rival the ones on 9/11 have begun to surface, detailing the twisted plots that managed to deliver the lethal injection to the poor bear, while at least 20 ranks of various kinds of officers are expected to commit ritual suicide or be paraded in rags to atone for their mistakes.

 * Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, CEO of Ferrari for over 20 years, was fired by the FIAT-Chrysler board, who control Ferrari. Now the CEO will be Marchionne, who also leads FIAT and intends to make sure that Ferrari goes back to winning F1 races. Following the move of several FIAT administration offices to the US after the Chrysler merge people wonder if such a thing will also happen to Ferrari, but Marchionne strongly denied such an event. No comments were released regarding the brutal murder of Daniza.

 * The economy still sucks and jobs still don't increase, but it will happen any time now -- the necessary reforms must however be delayed by the parlamentary inquries regarding the cruel Daniza murder.

 * Three missionary nuns were murdered in Burundi for unknown reasons, perhaps due to the ongoing religious strife. Local authorities also say that the nuns were also raped, but this does not seem to be confirmed by the other missionaries.

&gt;__Election Day__ in the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) is by tradition a Thursday. It has been suggested that this tradition arose as the best of several circumstances: Friday pay-packets would lead to more drunken voters on Fridays and weekends; having the election as far after a Sunday as possible would reduce the influence of Sunday sermons; many towns held markets on Thursdays, thus the local population would be travelling to town that day anyway. Under the [Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011), all future General Elections shall take place on the first Thursday in May every five years, barring special circumstances. Most other European countries hold all [Elections on Sundays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(politics\)). Polls in the United Kingdom open at 7:00 and close at 22:00.

true,Right_In-The-Pussy,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Finlandization was acting in complete fear of the USSR.

ugh, Finlandization refers to the fact you cannot run a small country in the shadow of an empire without accepting your policy's will have to be influenced by it and Ukraine is the perfect example of how ignoring your neighbor and partisanship leads to disaster.

&gt;Therefore why should Finland live in fear of upsetting Russia's ego and thinking who they associate with means Russia will refuse to trade with them?

Mexico is the good example in the America's since their policy is shaped in large part by their powerful neighbor and largest trade partner the USA and it would be suicide for them to say ""hey we used to be at war, you stole California and Texas so we are joining a military alliance with Russia with China since they are a better superpower who says they have our back now in case you ever come for more"" 

Russia is our biggest trading partner in Finland and joining NATO is just as big of an issue for them as Mexico aligning with China would be for the USA.

Being between NATO/Russia is like being the neighbor that lives on a street between two rival gang neighborhoods, it might be a bit rough sometimes but you don't want to wear the wrong colours and picking a side means your house becoming the front line in any turf war.

I think it's best to focus on our smarts than wars and try and keep the gang prolem at bay without calling the other maffia for help

&gt; It's not that they can't afford it, it's that they don't care. If they can force an employee to do it for free on top of his or her job, they will do so and keep the difference in their pocket.

We actually couldn't afford it since we were running a deficit. It hurts them wither way as they have to pay us ovetime in addition to extras for working evenings. On Saturday we are talking about overtime + $14 in extras per hour.

&gt; Euro zone has strong workers rights &amp; protections. UK is busy undermining those &amp; trying to leave.

The U.K is not in the Euro Zone which plays a large role of how well they are recovering. What country doesn't loosen up on labour laws during recessions? We even do it in Scandinavia. If you don't then you are clearly doing something wrong. 

&gt; And used chained slaves. Which caused big scandals. And those weren't lifted out of anything.

Do in no way think that i support the way workers are being treated in China, or any other developing country for that matter. The thing is that despite the bad things that come with industrialization, it also leads to a better society in the end. Here in the West we have gone through the same phase and we now take our rights and economy for granted. That's why we think it's brutal.

&gt; they're already starting. Which is why we should move back some critical lines, i think. (Real men have fabs. (c) Jerry Sanders, AMD)

Good for them. But for the time being i prefer German cars, Dutch refrigerators, Swedish ovens and American computers. If they are able to match the quality of these products, good for them.

&gt; Bank. Playing by the rules. Pick one hahahah. No, really, you don't know the half of it. Inexistant money printed on their own accounts, falsified trading, falsified libor, fake loans amongst each others, mafia money everywhere, betting and trading on their entire reserve till they have no liquidities, emptying clients pension funds and 201K to cover their losses, falsifying insurances, theft at every level ... Yeah i'm pretty disillusionned of that one. Honestly, there's not much to save there apart maybe a few Eurozone ones. In the US they're all rotten to the core, to the last.

When you are handling the large amounts of assets that banks do, it's very hard to not in some way or another participate illicit activities. Even if you have no intentions of doing it. It would also be interesting to see if you have any proof that every single bank in America is taking active part in these activities. 

Another thing i should mention is that you as a consumer are free to not support the big banks. I don't know if you have them in the U.S. But start banking through your local savings bank or credit union.

Sweden is a strong economy for a range of reasons, and immigration has played a role, but it probably isn't the current immigration as much as the immigration that was facilitated at a different time when Sweden had very specific labour market demands that just weren't being fulfilled locally.

The idea that *all* and *any* immigration is *always* a financial boon is much too simplistic.

First, that depends on the bank, the country and the regulation. It is important to distinguish between savings banks, investment banks, credit unions and other money-storing entities Second, we have seen through the early 2000s where banking investment leads us to: economic bubbles that will later burst in our faces.

About dividends, unions are there for many reasons, and one of them is preventing this from happening. 

I'm saying that a corporation, who lusts for profit, won't invest its money unless it is sure that it will get a greater amount of money from that investment. Also lobbysts do not work for the government, why would they get the public money? It's usually the other way around, lobbyists ""pressure"" the governments to receive some legal benefits.

Almost the same with power. No untouchables. Personal responsibility for even prosaic misdeeds was indeed extreme at that time  including capital punishment. Corruption still existed but it was almost exclusively about petty black market deals. It never was a political factor.
Now coming back to current Europe. Do you think Sweden doesn't have the same problem. Let me assure you they do and also according to all ratings they have absolutely minimal level of corruption. If corruption is not a factor why then epidemic of rapes perpetrated by immigrants in Sweden never hits headlines. Simple answer is that Swedish political elite is as culpable as the perpetrators. They created conditions and continuing to preserve status quo which makes immigrant rapists go unpublishable.

The state, on the other hand, does not have a vested interest in using their collected taxes to find profitable opportunities. Instead, officials who decide what to spend public money on will often go with people they know instead of the financially best venture. 

Corporations don't have this issue because their entire existence is to find profit. Choosing friends over better options just results in lost profits for the firm.

Importantly, though, a higher corporate tax rate doesn't even accomplish your goal of higher public expenditure. Instead of leaving money in the company and letting it be taxed at a high corporate tax rate, owners will just give out dividends and hide the money in the Caymans, Ireland, Netherlands, etc. The choice is between corporations investing/saving and owners evading taxes altogether, not corporations investing versus the state investing.",0,1410732280,null,0,false,0,ckicgpl,t3_2gd2hi,t1_ckicgpl,t1_ckic7b3,null,1427011905,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Vielen scheint nicht klar zu sein, dass eine Menge Wähler der Linkspartei ihr Kreuz nicht deshalb bei ihnen machen, weil sie sozial orientiert oder gegen Nazis ist. Im Gegenteil, die Linkspartei wird/wurde von vielen mit den der DDR positiv zugeschriebenen Eigenschaften assoziiert. Dichte Grenzen, kaum Ausländer (und wenn dann unglaublich streng geregelt) wenig Kriminalität die den ""kleinen Mann"" betrifft, eine germanozentristische Kultur und Geschichtsschreibung, Pro-Russisch, anti-westliche Haltung usw. Jetzt wird jemand sagen: ""Halt, die Linke (im Osten Deutschlands) ist für Demokratie, gegen Rassismus und gegen strenge Einwanderungskontrollen."" Medial ist dies auch richtig. Die Linkspartei vertritt dies auch. Aber im Osten gibt es schon lange den Witz, dass die CSU das westdeutsche Pentdant zur SED war. Und jetzt kommt eine Partei wie die AfD, die diese oben genannten Werte offen und direkt vertritt. Die deutschen Medien wunderten sich, warum Lucke kurz vor der Wahl nochmal offensiv die DDR angepriesen hat. Das war nicht irgendwer in der AfD, sondern der Gründer und Parteivorsitzende. Dieser Mann ist ziemlich clever.

true,mielove,SWED,Sweden,"Yeah. Problem is that Moderaterna have stated that immigration is a huge cost yet haven't actually given much of a platform on immigration issues which is what many of their voters wanted. This is mostly refugees we're talking about and the other side of the political spectrum believes in accepting refugees for idealistic/moral reasons. Moderaterna however have their hands mostly tied due to international laws on asylum seeking (and the EU status quo) and it's clear they didn't really know how to approach the issue (and they are very much for work immigration and an open labour market so appeasing voters that way was out). SD's policies are completely ridiculous but they gave an easy ""solution"" and that's what many voters were looking for.

Compare to the left who are actually much more against work immigration (to keep the jobs for the Swedish working class) whilst being all for refugee immigration for moral reasons. This of course leads to accepting lots of the completely wrong type of immigrant that makes integration as a whole all the more difficult. Yet some voters still like this since it means some limited immigration (even when it means highly educated people in their various fields then have a harder time getting jobs in Sweden).

true,Asyx,native,native,"Düsseldorf is a nice city. I was born and live here (until the 01.10. when I move to Dortmund for uni). It's very close to the Netherlands (in fact, it's the closest big city to the Netherlands), it's close to most major cities in NRW and you can reach all of them via train with your student ticket (if you want to take it slow, S1 goes through the Ruhrgebiet, S6 to Cologne but Regionalexpress is faster but it's so unreliable that I don't take it for uni). We also have a big Japanese population meaning you get good Japanese food. We even have a big Japan festival every year (no otaku nonsense. It's planned by the city and the Chiba prefecture). You can celebrate Karneval here, our beer is better than the shit you can get in Cologne.

It's quite expensive though. If you can't afford living near the uni, I recommend the districts Eller, Vennhausen, Lierenfeldt and maybe Flingern and Gerresheim. Flingern and Gerresheim would require you to switch trams or buses a lot to get to uni. From Eller, it's any tram or bus (U75 is the most common one. Trams with a U are underground trams) to the Vennhauser Alle (more about that below) and then with the 735 to uni. There are probably more ways to get there but that's the only one I know for certain.

The good thing about Eller and Vennhausen is that they're close to the Vennhauser Allee which is a tram/bus station. You can get into the city quite easily but also to other parts of Düsseldorf like the Unterbacher See which is quite nice for a swim. Don't swim outside of the dedicated swimming areas (they're quite cheap) though. I live right next to the lake and somebody drowns there every single year because they swim somewhere else in the lake and my friend actually had to quit rescue swimming there because they had to drag 3 bodies in one weekend out of the lake.

If you want to get around in Düsseldorf, vrr.de is great for bus connections. You can also download the Bahn app for Android and iOS which gives you very good routes. Public transport is quite extensive. Even though I live in a very remote district (Unterbach. That one was an independent village not so long ago), I had like 5 possible routes to get from school (Bilk... or Oberbilk... Not sure) to Unterbach including 2 S-Bahnen, 2 trams and a bus. So having the app ready in case you miss a bus is always great because the next possible tram or bus might just arrive 2 minutes later.

If the foreign students in Düsseldorf stick to themselves a lot like they do in Dortmund (Germans are hard to get warm...), check out the Linke Rheinseite. Just take the U75 to Neuss and after the bridge (one station after Tonhalle), the shores of the Rhine are all grass. There is a supermarket right down the street. Just get a one-time-grill, some meat, put the grill on some stones (I think they should have a little rack but you can never know. It can't stand right on the grass. The Ordnungsamt will tell you that you can't do that or even fine you), and have a nice grill party. We usually do that every summer but you might not know about that place if you don't get in touch with local students quickly.

The main station is not a good place to be at night. Take a look at the homeless people if you intend to give them money. I've seen some of them being picked up by cars with Romanian number plates. I'd think most people would consider them Gypsies (Zigeuner in German. Very negative connotation. Don't use that word) but they're just poor people being abused by criminals from eastern Europe. If you see people with a newspaper called fifty fifty, those are homeless people trying to make a bit of money. They buy those papers for a Euro each and then sell it to people for 2 euros. Never read one of those. I usually just give them the money and let them keep their newspaper. If they're not aggressively standing in your way, they're genuinely poor and need the money. Sometimes, you see people standing right in front of supermarkets with those things trying to guilt trip you into giving them money... Don't! The founder of fifty fifty already said that he has a lot of people coming over even though they are not homeless and they give all the other homeless people a bad reputation.

Sorry... I'm not sure what came over me... Since I'm moving soon and I'll miss the city, I got a bit emotional :(

Hai ragione, per la maggior parte almeno non in senso letterale e cosciente come lo intendiamo noi.

&gt; Quando lì si parla di violenza, si parla di violenza per tutti, non è che c'è scritto: ""le donne sì perché se lo meritano perché inferiori e gli uomini lasciamoli stare"".

E' vero, la bibbia è piuttosto bipartisan nel dispensare violenza ad ambo le parti, non vanno troppo per il sottile.

In mezzo a tutto questo vorrei far notare però come la donna sia una proprietà dell'uomo. esempio:

""D'ogni animale mondo prendine con te sette paia, il maschio e la sua femmina..""
Genesi 7:2

""Le loro case passeranno a stranieri,
anche i loro campi e le donne,
perché io stenderò la mano
sugli abitanti di questo paese».
Oracolo del Signore.""
Geremia 6:12

Le donne vengono considerate come proprietà.

Oltre a questo per 7 giorni al mese sono immonde e non vanno toccate....

&gt; La maggior parte dei precetti (e quindi delle incombenze) era rivolta agli uomini.

Certo, le donne erano solo oggetti passivi del diritto.

&gt; La circoncisione (quindi una mutilazione) è maschile, non è previsto l'equivalente femminile.

""9 Disse Dio ad Abramo: «Da parte tua devi osservare la mia alleanza, tu e la tua discendenza dopo di te di generazione in generazione. 10 Questa è la mia alleanza che dovete osservare, alleanza tra me e voi e la tua discendenza dopo di te: sia circonciso tra di voi ogni maschio. 11 Vi lascerete circoncidere la carne del vostro membro e ciò sarà il segno dell'alleanza tra me e voi. 12 Quando avrà otto giorni, sarà circonciso tra di voi ogni maschio di generazione in generazione, tanto quello nato in casa come quello comperato con denaro da qualunque straniero che non sia della tua stirpe. 13 Deve essere circonciso chi è nato in casa e chi viene comperato con denaro; così la mia alleanza sussisterà nella vostra carne come alleanza perenne. 14 Il maschio non circonciso, di cui cioè non sarà stata circoncisa la carne del membro, sia eliminato dal suo popolo: ha violato la mia alleanza».""

Genesi 17:9-14

La circoncisione è vista come simbolo dell'allenza tra Dio e l'uomo. Non è considerata una mutilazione.... I maschi sono portatori dell'onore della circoncisione.

&gt; Inoltre in mezzo c'è almeno un paio di millenni di teologia, giusto per dire che non è che si può criticare la Chiesa per qualcosa da cui magari ha preso le distanze.

Anche la stregoneria c'è da un po' più di un paio di millenni ma non mi sembra che ci si faccia molto scrupolo a denigrarla.
La teologia è il modo di riciclare vecchia spazzatura come nuovo oro colato. Perché dico questo? perché del libro che dovrebbe essere la rivelazione dell'imperitura e sempreverde saggezza divina sono salvabili si e no un 50% di parti che non sono porcate assolute.

Il libro di per se è scritto peggio dell'intera saga di Twilight, nonostante l'imposizione divina sugli scrittori, Il suo metro morale quantomeno ridicolo in confronto al metro morale della maggior parte delle nazioni sviluppate. La maggior parte dei cristiani non si è manco mai preso la briga di sfogliarla per sbaglio.

true,ka_mil,POLA,Poland,"&gt; I've had this conversation. It boils down the Polish being mad at the French and British for not kicking Nazi Germany out of Poland from day one. Of course it's utter bullshit since we still went to war and after Dunkirk got our cities bombed etc.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_betrayal

Well we expeteced your reaction from day one. But as it turns out Britain wasn't even preaper for war at that point. All you did  was dropping leaflets in Germany. France on the other hand was ready to fight but they got stuck on the Siegfried Line. 

Both sides promised too much to each other. According to reports that were sent to London our army wasn't read either and Germany airforces really fucked us over. This is what one of our general, Józef Jaklicz said when someone from the Britsh Army asked him how could Britian help Poland. It was on the 9th of September:

&gt;It can't. (...) It's too late. We expected your help from day one, everyday. We were expecting bombing of Germany and their army which is now devastating our armies. Bombardment that could at least partially liberate Polish sky from German planes, slow down the pace of German tans and give us time to organise the defence on the Vistula River. Today is too late. (...) But the fate of our independence will be decided not on the Vistula River, but on the Rhine.

And yeah, it's worh noting that few days later our Eastern ""friends"" decided to pop in and help Germans out. 

Also yeah, we did feel betrayed when we felt under Soviet Union wings.  But Churchill can't be blamed for that, it was Roosvelt's fault. He trusted Stalin too much and ignored every warning.

Anyway you're not wrong, but the main way in which the Euro itself is ""responsible"" is because the southern european countries (or the northern european countries', if you will) exchange rates cannot fluctuate in relation to eachother, to represent the conditions in different countries and adjust the international competitiveness of each country. 

If there wasn't a euro, the greek Drachmar would have been a lot cheaper than the German Mark. They might be able to attract investment more easily, their exports would be cheaper (fostering an export industry) and their imports more expensive (not necessarily good but more likely to lead to a positive trade balance that people seem to fret about.) Over time, if they improved their structural issues, their economy would have a benefit that meant they should catch up with the rest of the countries more quickly. 

With the Euro, they can't use this currency benefit to improve their competitiveness internationally, so they HAVE to make structural changes in order to be more competitive, which are slow and politically uncomfortable in countries where there are a lot of them. This is actually the POINT of the Euro, and it was what all the countries in europe were supposed to have been doing for the last 20 years.   
But times were good so people forgot and didn't want to make the structural changes to things like pensions and labour markets that would be needed for an internationally competitive economy, and that they are having to do now, in the middle of a crisis, with 20% unemployment. 

I don't completely agree with the Euro being a horrible thing, because there are and were a lot of structural issues so politically ingrained in most european countries that if they had the possibility to just devalue their currencies and print money if things got rough, that would be always be preferred to actually changing anything. From a democratic perspective it may be a weak solution, though.

It did, yes.

&gt;That is, of course, unless you wouldn't apply the same rules and principles to others as you have yourself.

I am neither an English person during their Empire. Or an American during the era of ""manifest destiny"". So I can see you were too lazy to find something bad that the Irish state has done. In the past the Irish state allowed child abuse to continue in forms pedophilic, neglectful and the sale of children. We also put up with the almost effective enslavement of mothers of so called ""illegitimate children"". In the past that tainted the Irish states legitimacy.

In the present, the treatment of refugees, our sometimes inhumane conditions for prisoners and our misogynistic abortion laws do taint the legitimacy of my state in my eyes. But those things are no where near as bad as genocide and overall Ireland, when you consider all we do for our people and our effect on the world is a legitimate state of which I am proud.  

But if Ireland was right now committing a genocide the rest would no longer matter. Any government doing that would be illegitimate as it would be against our constitution to start. If the Irish people voted to allow genocide then **of course** we would cease to be a legitimate nation in my eyes. I would I hope work at recreating a legitimate Ireland but that wouldn't make my state legitimate while committing genocide.

**The genocides of the past certainly do not legitimise the genocides of the present.**

Obviously genocide and subjugation delegitimise every state that is doing them. Have you not thought about it for a second? If a nation stops doing those things they can become legitimate.

If you want to read of some first hand experience with the party then you should read [this article.](http://www.sydsvenskan.se/asikter/mrutyuanjai-mishra-darfor-lamnar-jag-sd-och-slutar-som-kronikor-pa-avpixlat/) He used to be a member of the Sweden Democrats and he was a columnist for the same far-right blog which the other Sweden Democrats wrote comments on. The tl;dr is that he joined an organisation which fights for the free press and is heavily influenced by the far-right. He later joined SD and was pretty much used to in order for the party to look less racist. Now he wants to be an independent journalist to write and spread tolerance and multiculturalism and he apologised for his actions.

Now to answer your questions:

* You should not discredit them if they have abandoned their opinions and apologized for it. Being a member in the Sweden Democrats is literally the opposite of that.

* Sweden can't sustain all refugees in the world. Also your question is incorrect since the majority of the asylum seekers are from Syria and not from Africa. If Syria was at peace the percentage of refugees who are granted asylum would be much lower (around 25% to 35%) and at levels from around 2009-2011.

* Logic does definitely ""enter my brain"". However, you are completely uninformed or you are lying.

L'utilizzo o meno dipende dal tipo di impasto che si vuole ottenere. Ad esempio per gli impasti a lunga lievitazione o ad elevata idratazione bisogna usare necessariamente una farina forte. Le farine ad elevato contenuto proteico formano una maglia glutinica più resistente che aiuta a trattenere meglio l'anidride carbonica che si sviluppa durante la fermentazione dell'impasto e questo porta in teoria ad una migliore alveolatura e ad una consistenza più soffice o fragrante, a seconda dell'uso previsto. Quasi tutti i cultori della pizza usano farine con un livello di W (l'indicatore della forza della farina) medio-alto, così come viene usata normalmente una farina forte per il panettone e per la pizza al trancio, che deve avere una percentuale d'acqua maggiore e una consistenza più soffice.

If you mean some kind of inferior healthcare of last resort that costs money, US trade policy has created a bunch of so called ""free trade agreements"" that ***tie our hands forever***. because of them. they are the predecessors of TTIP, (the subject of this thread) and TISA, the similarly pending but even more secret Trade in Services Agreement.. (See the line endorsing the ""standstill"" and ""ratchet"" concepts, [at the link here](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-%2F%2FEP%2F%2FTEXT%2BTA%2BP7-TA-2013-0325%2B0%2BDOC%2BXML%2BV0%2F%2FEN&amp;language=EN).)

In order for public to actually be allowed without a complete shift in trade policy, would be impossible. because we're dealing with something much like an extremist religious cult, like ISIS or the Taliban. By their behavior, I am - strange as it sounds, 100% convinced at this point that they would sooner do almost anything else than allow real public health care. And yes, they will and do lie quite willingly to cover this up. Both parties are, incredibly.  But, the facts are there to see in the literature - most of it, (with one notable exception) from outside the US.

Standstill means that the date of signing was the forever immovable high water mark for public anything, Thats 1995. (Perplexingly, TISA [may also use 1995 as its standstill date!](http://www.democracynow.org/2014/6/20/a_plan_only_banksters_will_love)).. 

Ratchet means that every movement can only be more privatization, and there can be no movement away from privatization.  Like a ratchet. Visualize a one way street with no side streets. Or a noose, or a fish trap. 

The US could have had public healthcare *if it had predated the signing of the first applicable agreements* ([GATS](http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/Nick%20Skala%20GAT%20and%20Health%20Reform.pdf) and [NAFTA](http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/nafta.pdf) - in 1995- and it [would need to have been delivered as part of the governments function, and completely free](http://www.iatp.org/files/GATS_and_Public_Service_Systems.htm) so as not to compete unfairly with any multinational corporation.

&gt; You believe I'm an arrogant asshole? That's fine, you're the one who finds it amusing to label someone else's country with a term that's offensive to many, and flies in the face of centuries of history, good on you.

I said that as in ""it's funny that switzerland is famous for it's chocolate, even doh they can't even grow the ingredients themselfs"". It's not *literally* funny. And btw, you're putting words in my mouth.. I didn't say it was funny to use an offensive term. I said it was funny how, when the subject is Eastern Europe, you ignore the very arguments you use when the subject is the British Isles.

&gt; You also appear to enjoy putting words in my mouth, its not a very good debating strategy, I didn't say my issue with the term 'British Isles' was more important than the issue Eastern Europeans have ...

I could have phrased that better. I didn't mean to say, or imply that you said, that the Eastern Europe thing is more important. 

&gt; ..., I just don't think they are the same thing, you're the one who keeps coming back to it, as if conflating the two proves some point?

The point is that you downplay a problem people have with the term while arguing how other people using a term you don't like is offensive. History etc etc, ok, I get it, but the point is the term British Isles is offensive to *you*, and just as I might not care or know enough about how that might affect you, Eastern European is offensive to.. ahmm.. *[Slavs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery#Terminology)* ^(goddammit..) Yeah, the history is different, it always is, but you just pretend that you can rationalize this emotion away because the circumstances aren't identical, and they'll get over it in a couple of decades, while repeating to me how offensive a term British Isles is because not decades ago, but fucking ancient history is apparently super important all of a sudden.

&gt; I don't think you're some London Imperialist, I think you're some random person on the internet talking out of his hat on a subject on which you have a depth of knowledge wholly limited to reading a Wikipedia page ...

Let's just not go there.

No, I didn't say, and still don't think, you are somehow anti eastern european. All we're really talking about is terminology. And that they have just as much a ""right"" to be offended as you are.

A few months ago an ""anti-jihadist plan"" was put in place . Or rather an ""anti-sect plan"" because that's what it is actually. Relatives who suspect someone they know may be preparing to leave for Turkey and then Syria can call and they are put in contact with the relevant services. Of course that's not perfect but I really don't think there's a lot that can be done to prevent this. Education is key. 

Next week a new law will be discussed in Parliament and it is VERY scary regarding civil liberties. I don't want that, but I think it will probably pass. I haven't even heard that much about it in mainstream media (well they have a  lot to talk about currently). I just sent a lot of e-mails to politicians, that's all I can do :/

Also it seems that most of these western fighters are just lost kids who want to find a sense in life. I think it's got more to do with the feeling of being left apart, with no purpose in life, no future ahead of them and a lot of spare time to spend on the internet reading ""conspiracy theories"". They are just too immature to understand the complexity of our world, and ""religion"" offers an easy to understand scheme. But a lot of them were not religious a few months/weeks before they left. Many weren't even muslims. And actually there's not a lot of ""religion"" in this, it's just a Cult, a sect.

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"I'm not Jewish but the daily life of Jewish people in France isn't as bad as the constant media reports on antisemitism in France will have you imagine. I have a couple Jewish friends and it's not like anybody is seeking them out so they can tag their cars with antisemitic messages...

I also see Jews wearing kippas from time to time, just casually walking in Paris. However, I wouldn't wear a kippa in a Muslim project. But to be fair, me as a blond haired white guy, I wouldn't walk alone in a project either, especially as an outsider. But I'm also aware that Jews walking around with a kippa might get insults thrown at them, but only by people who are antisocial in the first place. Not the average Joe.

In my school and college years in the Paris region, my classes were quite multiracial, and there were always at least a couple Jews in my classes, and there didn't seem to be any targeting against them. Though I imagine a Jewish kid in a ""ghetto banlieue"" neighborhood's school might not have a very good time. 

Basically, from my non-Jewish perspective, I imagine that young Jews may be targets of physical threats or whatnot from hoodlums (mostly Muslim hoodlums), and sure, there's some casual antisemitism from the general population. But I don't have the impression that danger is overwhelming. Not to mention non-Jews get mugged or attacked too by hoodlums, though granted they're not necessarily targeted for their religion or race, at least not as obviously as Jews can be.

Lyrics. I just took these off some random website so hopefully they're not terrible:

**EDIT**: Yeah, I should have checked them better. Those poor nouns aren't capitalised for a start!

    Frag ich mich wie alles kam,
    Wie es dein verlangen einvernahm,
    Wie eine flut aus feuersand,
    dein himmel fuer immer verbrannt.

    Zu schnell hat es deine bühne,
    Erklommen ohne farbe un sühne,
    Nur deinen vorhang ziehst du zu...
    Schwarz.

    So verloren dich deine freunde,
    Und so begehrt dich dein feind,
    Vielleicht weiss du nicht wie leben geht,
    Lauf los - ich kann es...

    Ich kann es seh'n.
    Ich kann es seh'n.
    Wie wunderbar die engel sich vergeh'n.
    Ich kann es seh'n.

    Legt es sich an deine seite,
    Schaut dir tief in deinen kopf,
    Weiss es genau wie hoch es drehen muss...
    Schwarz.

    Lass dich frei wo es dich weiss macht,
    lass uns tiefer in dich gehn,
    einen himmel gibt es lang nicht mehr,
    lauf los, ich kann es...

    Ich kann es seh'n.
    Ich kann es seh'n.
    Wie wunderbar die engel sich vergeh'n.
    Ich kann es seh'n.
    Ich kann es seh'n.

    Zu gross ist dein begehren,
    Diese gefahr kann nie vergehn,
    Vielleicht weisst du jetzt wer zu dir steht,
    Lauf los, ich kann es...

    Ich kann es seh'n.
    Ich kann es seh'n.
    Ich kann es seh'n.

    Lauf los!
    Lauf los!
    Lauf los!
    Lauf los!
    Lauf los!
    Lauf los!

I'm pretty sure *lauf los* means ""run away"". The chorus I understand. The verses are a bit more tricky for me, but I can still understand a fair bit. I'll start by just attempting to translate the third verse but I'll do more when I have time.

    So verloren dich deine freunde,
    - So you lost your friends
    Und so begehrt dich dein feind,
    - and sought your enemy
    Vielleicht weiss du nicht wie leben geht,
    - maybe you don't understand how life goes
    Lauf los - ich kann es...
    - run away - I can...

&gt;__Alternative for Germany__ ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): *Alternative für Deutschland*), abbreviated to __AfD__, is a German [political party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Germany) founded in 2013. It describes itself as neither left or right wing, and that it cannot be classified using the traditional left-right political spectrum.  The Party states that it is anti-[euro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro),  but not anti-[EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union).  The party's central argument is that the euro is a failed currency that threatens [European integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_integration) by impoverishing countries with less competitive economies and burdening future generations.  The party has since tried to broaden its political message into areas such as policing, immigration and education in the run up to state elections.

France's GDP = 2,611,221 M$

UK's GDP = 2,471,600 M$

So the GDP of the UK is 5.3% lower than the GDP of France.

Now according to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Scotland), the GDP of Scotland is 245,267 M$. Which means that without Scotland, the GDP of the UK would be 14.7% lower than France's, which is quite a good margin.

    Hast du dich heute schon geärgert
    War es heute wieder schlimm
    Hast du dich wieder gefragt
    Warum kein Mensch was unternimmt
    Du musst nicht akzeptieren
    Was dir überhaupt nicht passt
    Wenn du deinen Kopf nicht nur
    Zum Tragen einer Mütze hast

    Chrous:
    Es ist nicht deine Schuld
    Dass die Welt ist, wie sie ist
    Es wär nur deine Schuld
    Wenn sie so bleibt

    Glaub keinem, der dir sagt
    Dass du nichts verändern kannst
    Die, die das behaupten
    Haben nur vor Veränderung Angst
    Es sind dieselben, die erklären
    Es sei gut so, wie es ist
    Und wenn du etwas ändern willst
    Dann bist du automatisch Terrorist

    Weil jeder, der die Welt nicht ändern will
    Ihr Todesurteil unterschreibt

    Sind zumindest theoretisch

    Worte wollen nichts bewegen
    Worte tun niemandem weh

    Geh mal wieder demonstrieren
    Denn wer nicht mehr versucht zu kämpfen
    Kann nur verlieren
    Die dich verarschen
    Die hast du selbst gewählt
    Darum lass sie deine Stimme hören
    Weil jede Stimme zählt

Note 2: Comment on traduit ""*fetish*"" en français? On parle de fétichiste mais le concept lui-même, comment se dit-il? J'aurais tendance à dire ""fétiche"" mais pour moi, un fétiche, c'est un truc en bois et en paille que le grigriman de Cocody utilise pour appeler le mauvais oeil sur ses ennemis. Disons que le mot ""fétiche"" est correct.

Donc, ma copine à ce fétiche. Elle veut avoir un mec volage et séducteur, et elle m'encourage à prendre des numéros de nanas, à aller prendre des verres avec, etc. Pas forcément jusqu'à coucher avec, bien que ça ne la dérange pas, mais elle veut que je joue le jeu de la séduction. Je pense qu'elle veut que son mec soit désiré et désirable, et elle me fait pleinement confiance sur le fait que je risque pas de me barrer (à raison). Au début, j'étais enthousiaste, c'est un peu le meilleur des deux mondes. Je me suis donc remis, l'année dernière, ""sur le marché"". 

... Ben, mon colon. J'ai jamais eu un énorme succès en matière de séduction quand j'étais plus jeune, et je me souviens pourquoi. J'ai essayé pas mal de choses: Les bars, les boîtes, les soirées célibataires... nada. Enfin si: beaucoup de mépris. 

J'ai testé les différents trucs sur internet. OKCupid (vite arrêté), Tinder (ouh que c'est brutal), Meetic... Même reddit - non non, pas sur ce sub j'utilise mon throwaway pour ça. Non pas que vous ne soyez pas séduisants, j'en suis sûr. Ma copine m'a même aidé à faire un ou deux de mes profils. Je me refuse à tenter les trucs spécialisés comme Gleeden ou Ashley Madison, sachant que ce sont des arnaques patentées.

Après un nouvel échec sur un autre site ce week-end, j'ai pris la décision d'arrêter. Je le dirai à ma copine ce soir, j'ai pas eu le temps. Elle m'en voudra pas, c'est pas son genre, mais putain je suis désolé pour elle. Quel genre de mec est incapable d'intéresser des nanas, *même avec le soutien de sa légitime?!*

Ce qui m'a empêché de dormir cette nuit, c'est que je vois que ma copine se pose la même question. Je vois la déception quand on en parle, et ma valeur en tant qu'homme (oui, je sais, c'est un concept horriblement dépassé, permettez-moi cet écart) en prend un sacré coup.

E questo era quello che stavo sostenendo. Anzi, IMHO non c'è nemmeno in senso figurato e inconscio. Rigetto l'intera idea di misoginia di fondo. Ci sarà stata, come c'è tuttora, in qualcuno, ma non penso sia strutturata.

Ciò che noi consideriamo ora ""diritti"" (es. un lavoro, fare il militare, o i precetti religiosi) all'epoca erano incombenze, che potevano anche essere molto pericolose (vedi, appunto, il militare).

Quindi non riesco a credere all'esistenza un odio *sistemico* verso il genere femminile, trovo molto più probabile che siamo noi a interpretare male certe questioni di un libro composto a migliaia di chilometri e di anni di distanza.

Sugli animali: quel ""la sua compagna"" non vuol dire niente.

Sulla circoncisione: quello dell'alleanza è IMHO una giustificazione a posteriori di un'usanza più antica pre-biblica, di cui già all'epoca si erano perse le origini, come il non mangiare maiale.

Fatto sta che proprio la circoncisione è un classico esempio di precetti biblici che sono stati messi da parte dalla Chiesa (e anche abbastanza presto), così come, in tempi più recenti, quelli sulla donna.

Per gli altri due paragrafi: considerarlo *un* libro è un riduttivo quanto la definizione che dai della teologia.

Finally people actually got tired of that, and started to vote for the SD, since they are the only ones willing to even adress the issue. So, the ones who has worked the hardest and won most votes for the Sverigedemokraterna are all the other parties.

And, with the unfailing idiocy of the Swedish politicians/media they are now upset about the result and showing contempt for the voters once again.

The rest lie in an area whose boundaries were decided between Norway and the United Kingdom, not Scotland. Playing Devils advocate for a second theres no reason Norway or Denmark might also want to make a claim on those.

Secondly, Salmond has said he wants to walk away from paying Scotlands share of the national debt and still use the pound. Do you really think rUK is going to allow iScotland to walk away from debt, and take one of the largest sources of revenue, and still use the currency without making some concessions?

Thirdly, most of that oil actually lies off Shetland who are already beating the drum about setting themselves up as a manx style independent state. It would be extremely hypocritical of Scotland to vote for their own independence but not allow Shetland to determine theirs. 

Finally, while some powerful nations may fall on one side, there are others who fall on the other. International politics is not that simple: China for example is currently claiming obscure parts of the South China sea and pissing off all its neighbours, so they're not going to have a dog in this fight. Also many countries have their own succession issues, and so they're not going to support iScotland's.

She left the receeds and they were checked by, among others, journalists that wrote about it, which they honestly should have.

It should however be noted that in reality she didn't break any law and that she paid all the money back. It doesn't seem like she had any intention of stealing form public funds.

She had to step down from her candidacy to become leader of socialdemokraterna which would have made her Prime Minister because of it (in 1995 that is), and she also likely lost the 2010 election which also would have made her Prime Minister due to it's memory.

La séduction entre nous ne tient pas qu'à cette affaire, et quand on se prend des moments pour nous, ce qui est heureusement assez fréquent, tout se passe plus que bien.

With time, almost all of the ruling class of this state became Ruthenian or Polish, while the Lithuanian people remained in the northern part of this state (where today's Lithuania is). Now, Lithuanians had a national revival around interwar period and they started to perceive domination of Polish culture as a threat to their own. When Poles fought them over Wilno city - current capital of Lithuania - that's when the relations went sour for real.

Samsemilia, whut the dilly ya 'll? Ja ich kiff immer noch,  
seitdem Mama das erste Mal Weed aus meinem Zimmer roch.  
Meine Lunge sieht vom ganzen Rauch schon aus, wie 'ne Rosine,  
und durch die Nonstop-Routine, die Augen rot, wie Rubine,  
aber ey, ey, ey! Ansich is' alles ok.  
Hauptsache ich hab Buddha da und noch 'n Paper zum dreh'n.  
Ich belauschte grad Leute aus der Szene, hörte, wie sie flüsterten:  
""Der Typ redet so oft von Weed, er könnte sich gleich Spliffstar nenn'.""  
Doch das hat nix zu tun mit Imagepflege oder Gruppenzwang,  
nur wenn ich nix zu rauchen hab, fängt 's überall zu jucken an.  
Meine Augen sind zu rot, um mit der Industrie zu liebäugeln,  
denn das Füllen der Seiten, fordert für mich das Leeren von Weedbeuteln.  
Mit der Kreativität is' es 'n auf und ab, wie Kniebeugen,  
und high sein, rettet mich über die Tiefs beim Poesieschreiben.  
Ich kann nich' mehr clean bleiben, wenn ihr 's schafft, schön für euch.  
Ich denk den ganzen Tag lang nur an dieses grüne Zeug!  
  
Hook 2x (Eißfeldt):  
Alles is' cool solange ich genügend chille,  
Grass in Tüten hülle, die Lunge mit Zügen fülle.  
die grüne Brille, ohne sie hätt' ich vor 'm leben Schiss,  
sie lässt mich Sonne seh'n, wo Regen is'...  


  
Strophe 2:  
Es is' so, dass ich, wenn ich anfang' zu schreiben, so high bin,  
dass ich 's nich' schaff', diese ""Von oben herab""-Form zu vermeiden,  
werd' so dreist, dass ich ander'n MCs ihre Mics wegnehme,  
und dann erst sie wegdiss und dann den Rest der Rapszene.  
Denn vielen fehlt es an Liebe und Gefühl, wie bei 'ner Zweckehe,  
was nich' heißt, dass ich mit meinem Mikrofon ins Bett gehe,  
aber ich bring 's auf 'n Punkt, sitz' neben einem Haufen Skunk,  
werde ihn Wegrauchen und, das ganze hat auch 'n Grund:  
Ich will mit Joint im Mund sterben, hab deshalb immer einen an,  
weil in solchen kranken Zeiten, jeder Tag dein letzter sein kann.  
sogar nachts hab ich 'n heftigen Stick neben meinem Bett liegen,  
und wenn ma' das Haus brennt, kann ich schon rauchend rausrenn'.  
Viele denken eh, ich sei um den Verstand gekomm'.  
Sagen: ""Sam, was geht 'n ab? Du kiffst jeden Tag !"" Ich sag: Is angeboren.  
Mein Vater hat gekifft, und so kiff ich auch,  
du kannst ma' zieh'n, doch rauch den Spliff nich' auf,  
und wenn 's jemand schriftlich braucht:  
Ich werd' nie stoppen! Geh öfter und mehr Weed shoppen,  
als Muttis Klamotten und dreh mehr Joints als Friseusen Locken.  
Bevor du mich ohne Gras siehst, siehst du Dendemann ohne Eckowear,  
oder Eißfeldt ohne Air-Max, für mich is' alles andere sekundär!  
  
Hook (2x)  
  
  
Strophe 3 :  
Viele fragen mich, ob es nich' auch mit Weniger geht.  
Was meint ihr, warum auf der Platte Samsemilia steht?  
Ich bin mittlerweile so süchtig, ich bräuchte 'n eignen Coffeeshop,  
und zwischen jedem Joint noch 'n THC-Lollipop.  
denn Mongos leben high, und sind nich down mit dem Gegenteil,  
Wir rauchen bei jeder Gelegenheit und noch nebenbei.  
(ich) erledige Termine 'n andermal, mach ertsma Ganja klar,  
bin immer stoned. Privat, On-Stage, oder vor der Kamera.  
Hammerhart! Wär ich abergläubisch, wär das Weed mein Talisman,  
gib mir 'n Spliff im Regensturm, ich relax, wie am Badestrand,  
an alle Dealer, die ich kenn: Ohne euch wär 's nie klargegangen,  
Dank und Grüsse daher von Deutschlands größtem Cannabisjunk!  
  
Outro:  
Das war Deutschlands größter Cannabisjunk: Samsemilia!  
Zusammen mit seinem Partner in smoke: Tropf...  
Eimsbush Bassment 2000, Mongo Clikke 13  
und an den Nachwuchs:  
Raucht nich' so viel, wenn ihr noch in der Entwicklung seid,  
denn viele Kiffer komm' später Shizo rüber, wie Jeckyll &amp; Hyde.

That turned out to not be the case, and especially Britain wasn't in a position to do much. 

Main problem is that they've [done almost nothing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoney_War) - much less than it was possible. 

Most of the blame should have gone towards [French who were actually in position to even crush German western front](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saar_Offensive) since Hitler put only few divisions there in a gambit aimed to quickly overwhelm Poland's army.

&gt; The Social Justice Index is composed of the following six dimensions: poverty prevention, equitable education, labor market access, social cohesion and non-discrimination, health as well as intergenerational justice.  
&gt;
As a cross-national survey, the Social Justice Index comprises 27 quantitative and eight qualitative indicators, each associated with one of the six dimensions of social justice. The data for the quantitative SGI indicators used in the Social Justice Index are derived primarily from Eurostat and the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). The qualitative indicators refect the evaluations provided by more than 100 experts responding to the SGI’s survey of the state of afairs in various policy areas throughout the OECD and EU (see www.sgi-network.org). For these indicators, the rating scale ranges from 1 (worst) to 10 (best). In order to ensure compatibility between the quantitative and qualitative indicators, all raw values for the quantitative indicators undergo linear transformation to give them a range of 1 to 10 as well.

If I may slip my personnal opinion, basically a German private foundation (Bertelsmann Stiftung) can tweak this index saying ""evil Southern Europeans, your current governance is good for nothing as usual, why can't you just apply the same policies as Germany?"" so it should be taken with a grain of salt... It even might, subconsciously when it was first designed, have been weighted in a way that makes Germany's sphere of political friends look good!

Je vais prendre ça pour une vrai question.

Un allergique au gluten, quand il en mange, vomi, se couvre de boutons, devient rouge, ou parfois gonfle de façon dangereuse type œdème de Quincke). Il peut risquer sa vie s'il en mange. 

Un intolérant, ne risque pas sa vie. Il a un inconfort digestif. Des ballonnements, des diarrhées très aigus, de l’eczéma, des maux de têtes et à la longue peut développer des soucis neurologiques (type spasmophilie). Il y a beaucoup de personnes qui se sente beaucoup mieux, une fois le gluten écarté. Certains revivent. J'en connait deux dans mon entourage. Il ne se connaissent pas. On les reconnait à peine. C'est des ingénieurs pointus et très raisonnables. Dans la vie, ils sont très très loin de n'importe quelle mode.  

&gt;« parait il plus ""nocif"" » ? De quelle façon, et qui affirme cela ?

Le blé aux US a été sélectionné pour avoir le plus de concentration de gluten possible. Le gluten, c'est le liant indispensable pour faire une bonne pâte (à pain ou autre).

Punto uno:
&gt; se non piace l'osso buco

E' impossibile che l'ossobuco (tuttoattaccato) non piaccia. Se qualcuno non gradisce questa ambrosia, specialmente il midollo, non è degno di sedersi a tavola coi discendenti celti e deve essere relegato al Regno di Terronia dove si potrà cibare di carrube e lupini, più adatti al suo palato incompetente.

Punto due:
&gt; si può preparare la carne senza osso

Non osi il cuoco separare ciò che che la dea Demetra ha creato unito. L'ossobuco si  mangia tutto intero, ossa e carne. Se vuoi il midollo per farci il risotto, vai da un macellaio, ti fai dare un femore spaccato a metà per il lungo e usi quel midollo.

*According to a decision of a political court based solely on such strong evidence like hearsay and expertise, of which only the pro-Western was accepted as true and other was dismissed. This is how ICTY works, and you'd know it if you ever actually watched any of the trials.

There were war crimes and there were massacres, maybe some ethnic cleansing in some areas, but it there is no material proof to substantiate the claim that it was planned and organized on a national level, and it certainly was not genocide. And the crimes mentioned were committed by all three sides.

&gt;&gt;but they all happened predominantly in retribution.

&gt;Really, mass rape occurred as ""retribution""?

&gt;Wide scale massacres occurred as ""retribution""?

If you claim otherwise, you obviously have no knowledge of the historical context and the actual events that transpired during the war.

Also, see my first points.

&gt;The only things that are non-existent are the reasons for Serb revolt in the '90s.

Unfortunately it seems that one thing that the majority of us despises above all else is being told that we're *deeply* wrong, even should that regard vicious malice, ignorance or, uninformed prejudice.

And so Humanity needs be dragged to progress kicking and screaming, only to at the last moment, well past decency, for most to turn around and stalwartly deny complicity. 

I wonder whether it was at all alike, when slavery and serfdom were being abolished, first wave feminism, minority rights; First acts of social support...

Still, the thread above shows just how broad a category 'Social Justice' is, and so the fact that most beard-necked backlash hinges on sexism is all the more disheartening, but that's a discussion regarding much deeper problem with stern and twisted, far reaching roots, and not to be poked nor probed at this ungodly hour with so little coffee in me.

The politicians that run in your district are all listed. You can make one (1) X - either for a person or for a party. If you vote for a person, you're voting for his/her party, unless they are running as independents.

Usually, the longest lists occur for the local elections - in inner Copenhagen, we have a lot of, um, strange parties and it takes only 20 (or 50) people vouching for you to run.

A quick Wikipedia search shows you were generally associated with EU-skeptical movements - nothing particularly wrong with that, but it would have been nice to mention in in the thread starter text, because this isn't really the most obvious stance for an EP member.

So the most obvious question is, what is your primary problem with the EU? I am not asking you to summarize 60 books here, just maybe out of the most important problems pick out the most quickly summarizable one.

Another questions:

- Did you see a lot of ideology in the EP in the sense of e.g. socialists and conservatives having a markedly different philosophy and with that a markedly different politics? Or are they more likely to represent national interests, or simply whateveer they see practical at the moment?

- Generally those MEPs who came from the conservative parties, or are generally considered conservatives, do they represent the interests of big businesses, or the interests of the middle-class, rural farmers, and national interests, in other words, would they be more of a neo-liberal or more of a traditionalist kind of  conservatism?

- Does the EP or most MEP members see their role as something set on a grand historical stage, to close down former nationalisms and chauvinisms forever and thus change European mindset, or do they see their roles as more down-to-earth and pragmatic?",0,1410782964,null,0,false,0,ckit3y5,t3_2gd9t1,t1_ckit3y5,t3_2gd9t1,null,1427004118,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Il faut voir la réalité en face : Israël est la et ne partira pas. La Jordanie et l'Égypte ont fini par le comprendre.

Israël ne cherche pas a génocider les palestiniens. La plupart des palestiniens ne cherchent pas a détruire Israël. Les deux pourraient vivre en paix. Raison pour laquelle Israël, contrairement a ce que l'on pourrait penser, se montre mesurée. Ils ont pour doctrine de ne rien laisser passer et de répliquer, et font donc des victimes civiles (beaucoup), mais il n'y a ni barbarie ni humiliation, ce qui permettra de faire la paix dans le futur. Les États-Unis ont ravagé le Japon et l'Allemagne pendant la seconde guerre mondiale (au bas mot des dizaines voire des centaines de milliers de morts). Mais ils ont fait la paix assez rapidement ensuite, car il n'y avait pas de haine. Les japonais, en revanche, ont commis des atrocités en Chine et ailleurs, et ils n'ont toujours pas été pardonnés.

Les voisins d'Israël (Égypte et Jordanie), après avoir tenté plusieurs fois d'envahir le pays, se sont avisés et reconnaissent l'existence de l'État d'Israël.

Certains États sont contre Israël pour des raisons géopolitiques/stratégiques (Iran), d'autres le sont plus ou moins par antisémitisme historique (monarchies du golfe).

Dans tous les cas, les pays arabes considèrent les palestiniens comme des moins que rien (un peu comme les roms en France). Ils aident le Hamas et les mouvements terroristes et se fichent bien de la population, qu'ils considèrent comme des SDF même pas capables d'avoir du pétrole ou des monarchies. L'aide a la population vient surtout des occidentaux.

Israël peut continuer indéfiniment comme cela. Ils ont l'Iron Dome, bientôt ils auront l'Iron Beam encore plus sophistiqué et moins couteux. Malgré les alertes et les roquettes, ils continueront leur vie. Ils continueront d'avoir une économie prospère, innovante, tournée vers l'avenir.

Ils n'ont aucun intérêt stratégique a humilier ou persécuter la population de Gaza. Ils pourraient y retourner et prendre le contrôle du territoire s'ils le décidaient.

true,HugodeCrevellier,EURO,Frank Reich,"&gt;*I'll be curt and just ask what I really want to know: how is the withdrawal of Turkish forces relevant in any way until there is an actual agreement for reunification? It seems to me that until reunification has been discussed, any talks of a Turkish withdrawal are rather pointless as there will still be a buffer zone and a working Northern Cypriot government that has been governing for over 30 years.*

""*Curt*"" doesn't  mean ""*brief*"" incidentally.

In any case, you're asking whether the withdrawal of the Turkish military occupation is '***relevant***'!?! Seriously? That, basically, is **the only thing** that's ... '*relevant*'. 

That which you described as a ""*working Northern Cypriot government*(!) *that has been governing for over 30 years*""  is actually but **some bullshit puppet regime installed by Turkey and recognised by nobody but Turkey**!

The extent of the needed '*discussion*' is for Europe to tell Turkey to get its military occupation the fuck out of Cyprus and for Turkey to actually get its military occupation the fuck out of Cyprus ... that's all there is to it. No '*agreement for reunification*' needs be present beforehand. The logistics of reunification will be worked out by Cyprus' legitimate government ... once the military regime occupying half the country packs their bags and gets the fuck back to Turkey. 

Anyway, for real-politik reasons, Europe has been pretending not to notice the military occupation by a supposed ally (but a deeply Islamic and rather barbarous country actually, itself only kept semi-secular by the exercise of military power on its own peoples). And because of its wishy-washy handling of Cyprus, among other things, Europe is perceived as so indecisive and weak that Putin (that KGB fucktard with neo-soviet imperial daydreams) thought it would be ok to invade Ukraine. 

Europe needs to start getting serious about its foreign policy.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;A lack of hate crimes law is a serious issue. A racially-aggravated or sexual orientation-aggravated assault should be punished more harshly.

Any reason why exactly? 

I have two issues with this. One of this is that while almost everybody has a characteristic that makes him a minority, some of these characteristics - race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion- are picked out as more important than others. This makes some people more equal, or some characteristics more in need of protection. Ultimately it becomes way too ideological - the law basically says that hating someone for being gay or brown is worse than hating him for being handsome, rich or nerdy. This, for me, is too ideological.

Another issue is what do you do when a minority attacks a majority member? If it not a hate crime, it makes some people more equal, if it is a hate crime, then you just pissed off the very same minority members you are trying to protect: they will say how the hell can lashing out against unjust oppression be an aggravating factor? And they will have a point.

&gt;

&gt;___Mani pulite___ (pronounced [ˈmani puˈlite], Italian for ""clean hands"") was a nationwide [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) judicial investigation into [political corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption) held in the 1990s. *Mani pulite* led to the demise of the so-called *[First Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Italy_as_a_Republic#The_First_Republic_.281947-1992.29)*, resulting in the disappearance of many parties. Some [politicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician) and industry [leaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership) committed [suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide) after their [crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime) were exposed.

&gt;The number of suspects involved varies but as many as 5000 have been cited. At one point more than half of the members of the [Italian Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Parliament) were under indictment. More than 400 city and town councils were dissolved because of corruption charges. The estimated cost of the bribes paid annually in the 1980s by (Italian and foreign) companies bidding for large government contracts in Italy was 4 billion dollars (6.5 trillion lire). 

&gt;The corruption system that was uncovered by these investigations was usually referred to as *Tangentopoli* (Italian pronunciation: [tanʤenˈtɔpoli]).  The term derives from *tangente*, which means [kickback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickback_(bribery\)) and in this context refers to kickbacks given for [public works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_works) contracts.,  and *[poli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polis)* meaning cities; it is thus sometimes translated as ""Bribesville"" or ""Kickback City"".

On peut aussi discuter de la responsabilité du Koweit dans le déclenchement de la guerre du Golfe, mais à partir du moment où l'Irak ne se contentait plus de capturer les champs pétrolifères contestés (ce qui déjà est limite dans le genre loi du plus fort), mais envahi le pays, on peut difficilement les peindre comme des moutons innocents. 


De même en Ukraine la situation est bien unilatérale, et après l'invasion de la Crimée, les groupes armés par Moscou n'ayant pas suffi, l'armée régulière a été obligée d'intervenir (en capturant des villes le long de la frontière Russe). Face à cela, la propagande Russe n'est pas en parti pris, mais bien en mode limite caricatural (les gentils résistants spontanés face à la junte illégitime et nazi de Kiev) et vouloir la mettre sur le même plan que notre information, c'est comme vouloir mettre sur le même plan un maitre de conférence et le curé du coin dans le débat sur l'évolution.

&gt;Stating that Berlusconi has been dominating Italian politics for 20 years thanks to the dumbing effect of his TV network is naive and disingenuous. Of course television played a great part on his power, but in two ways:
with TV, Berlusconi could present himself as the rich and cunning entrepeneur, the self-made man, character on which he based his public image
taking advantage (more than anybody else) of the public's exasperation with Mani Pulite (a nationwide investigation into political corruption held in the early 1990s that made DC, the main political party, crumble), disenchanted with traditional politics, he managed to gain favour as an outsider entering politics reluctantly.
This can't fully explain all these votes for such a long time, one must remember that Italy has never been a left-leaning country (the Italian Communist Party, while being the biggest in the West, only won one European election in the 80s); the Italian elector is moderate, he fears leaps into the unknown, and has never lost his faith in the man (or the party) of Providence. Berlusconi, the succesful, ""clean"" tycoon that could stop a communist party now without adversaries, embodied all those virtues.
We must then add the narrative of Berlusconi victim against foes using underhanded schemes to discredit him, a quarrelsome Left after the dissolution of the PCI and electoral systems that help the polarization in Us (good) and Them (villains), a game absolutely in Berlusconi's chords.

Now I personally think that something that is mandatory shouldn't cost 37,50 EUR. But the UK isn't better here, [apparently](https://www.gov.uk/passport-fees) it's even more expensive. A whopping 90 EUR, woaaaah.

In terms of atrocities, the only difference between ISIS and the West is that ISIS possess the naivety to be honest about it's doings, displaying them out in the open, while the West cowardly pretends to be a victim and an appeaser that can do no wrong. That, and the fact, that the kidnapping and killing that ISIS is doing, the West does far, far, far better, and does it on a much more substantial level too.

Now, since the difference between ISIS and the West has been made clear to you, are you going to apply the same ""don't even want to know their goals"" standard to the West also?

Ora è possibile renderla ancora più originale optando per una targa personalizzata. Quello che prima era possibile fare solo nelle nazioni straniere, lo si può fare anche in Italia. Vediamo insieme come si può avere la targa personalizzata.

&gt; Avere una targa personalizzata è un modo simpatico per dire qualcosa di sé. In base a quello che si decide di scrivervi, si può offrire una presentazione iniziale di sé stessi, anche se a livello molto superficiale. Nonostante per anni non sia stato possibile adottare un elemento di questo tipo, da oggi si può. Grazie all'aggiornamento dell'articolo 100 del Codice della strada, si può scegliere un personale codice alfanumerico sia per le targhe delle auto che per quelle delle moto

&gt; Tale richiesta ha ovviamente i suoi costi e un iter da seguire. Il prezzo sarà stabilito dal Dipartimento per i trasporti terrestri, il quale provvederà a controllare la disponibilità del codice alfanumerico richiesto e la sua eventuale assegnazione a colui che lo sta richiedendo. Successivamente, verrà rilasciata la carta di circolazione attinente. Dopo che la richiesta è stata accolta, passeranno all'incirca 30 giorni dal rilascio della carta affinché la targa venga consegnata. Tale consegna avverrà a cura dell'Istituto Poligrafico dello Stato. 

&gt; La domanda per effettuare la richiesta deve essere presentata, come abbiamo detto, al Dipartimento dei trasporti terrestri.  Ci si può recare direttamente presso l'ufficio di competenza di zona per mettere per iscritto il tutto. In loco si potrà trovare tutto il necessario per compilare la domanda, scrivere il codice alfanumerico che si vorrebbe avere e consegnare i dati relativi alla propria automobile e alla propria persona.

&gt; Il costo di tutta la pratica si aggira intorno ai 150 euro. Mentre la targa è in realizzazione, si potrà circolare con il proprio mezzo utilizzando una targa provvisoria. È importante sapere che per ricevere l'oggetto richiesto, ci si deve provvedere in anticipo di una pannello a fondo bianco. Sarà in esso che verranno stampate e disegnate le nuove combinazioni alfanumeriche. Una volta trascorsi i 30 giorni, la targa potrà essere applicata liberamente nelle zone apposite del proprio veicolo o motociclo.

Then I should tell you that many many people in Sweden believe they are doing exactly this when they do whatever they can to oppose SD. That's including what you call bullying and even obstructing the democratic process by removing ballots. Of course I do not agree with such actions but you should realise that the world isn't in black and white and everything can't be categorised as absolute right or wrong.

I say default on odious debt and leave Germany influence zone. Starve it from ill revenue. They care only for themselves and demonize their neighbors. Always have!

They had zero or negative interests throughout this, unlike others. Their deficits were well above 3 o 4, something verboten nowadays!! Sure, they worked hard to rebuild, but I doubt any other European nation would fail to do the same under such favorable terms. But their vanity places them in a higher tier of civilization - posters boys for perfection and sophistication. A lie. And such short term memory. Such failure to recall those times. But in this case, they only recall the bread lines and their trillion marks cost.

These are gross xenophobic based policies which should unacceptable. As any form of apologisms towards this. When the EU no longer suits them or has any resources left to soak in, they'll leave. Make no mistake. And they'll continue to influence and control Europe through economic gravitas. Seeding misery and dependency.

Check the edit. They're simply mistaken. When the majority of voters grab multiple ballots, there can't really be any stigma attached to grabbing multiple ballots. People just get paranoid about being judged when they don't realize that everyone else also does the exact same thing, regardless of who they vote for.

&gt; In fact, there's a lot of this bully mentality about people who vote for SD. Is that normal in Sweden?

Unfortunately, yes, but that has nothing to do with the election system.

The relative pronoun needs to agree in gender and number with its antecedent. It also needs to be in nominative case because it's the subject of the subordinate clause. Actually it's identical to the definite article, if that helps you remember.

Also, the verb (almost) always goes last in subordinate clauses.

&gt; Offensichtlich **ist** mein Deutsch schlecht, aber ich möchte **mich wirklich verbessern**.

In the main clause, the verb is always second. In the subordinate clause it's final again.

Unlike *to improve*, *verbessern* is always a transitive verb in German, that means it must have an object. So you need to use a reflexive pronoun (*mich* 'myself', *dich* 'yourself', *sich* 'him-/her-/itself', *uns* 'ourselves', *euch* 'yourselves', *sich* 'themselves').",0,1410789846,null,0,false,0,ckivd7a,t3_2gfr5g,t1_ckivd7a,t3_2gfr5g,null,1427002995,6,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,6

No, I used ""Żmudzinie"" as a joke. GDL was an entirely different thing compared to current Lithuania.

Yes, of course, I know, only the Lithuanians school teach the true history, that the historical Lithuanians were a big Lithuanian speaking nation spanning half of Europe and tragically subjugated by sly, evil Poles. Truth is, there are numerous oversimplifications and propaganda on both sides. The truth is also that GDL in later stages was an Old Ruthenian and Polish speaking nation with small Baltic speaking minoroty, that territories of former GDL in 1920's were quite clearly divided into ethnically Belarusian, Polish and Lithuanian parts - and Lithuanian interwar imperialism claimed all of them, on doubtful basis that it was the only true successor of GDL.

you are spot on. even if Polish-speakers were almost a half in Vilnius in these days, doesn't mean they identified themselves as Poles or were Poles for that matter.

&gt;I know only the Lithuanians school teach the true history

we are taught shit in schools. mostly because of the influence of Soviet version of history. only now new generation of historians rises, who tries to look at history objectively, without demonising Poles f.e. can you say the same?

&gt;Lithuanian interwar imperialism claimed all of them

Vilnius was not Lithuanian city per se (it was very multinational and multicultural since the beginning of times, it was even called North Jerusalem), but it was capital of Lithuania, where many of the most important cultural and historical events happened, it was essential for Lithuanian culture for centuries.

and we never claimed Belarusia (tho as you suggest we might have had).

&gt;No ammount of modern Lithuanian denial and propaganda will change any of that. I wish your nation best luck and hope we can closely cooperate in the future despite mutual historical grievances in the past.
