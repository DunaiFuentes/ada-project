&gt;British leadership would follow the path the UK has already laid out, one they disagree with.

&gt;They want the UK on their team, saying the things that everyone else is saying, that's not leadership, unless having a louder voice than most of those around you is leadership. 

I guess /u/PRigby worded it better but is it really that hard to see that Britain can lead in its own way without towing away from cohesion. Especially in a crisis where everyone not wanting to take the bigger hits is already a problem?

&gt;What happens if the UK escalates the conflict? Promises Militany aid or assistance? We talk about appeasement now, but we live in a world with nukes and Europe hasn't even begun to reach its potential after the last world war, do you want to start another one over Ukraine? 

I don't think anyone here really hopes for war but maybe someone tapping Bulgaria on the fingers and calling Germany out on their protectionist attitude could help

&gt;As for non military actions the UK is helping lead the EU's response, but since we have to provide a united front in this there's no room for a outright leader. 

And I think it could do more. Not necessarily on its own with its own sanctions of course but by pushing the EU as a whole a bit more.

Exploration would've been experimenting with both new-world and old-world grapes, the local terroir, different styles you could make, etc., and see what works and what doesn't. Come up with a distinctively *California* style of wine, not just a copy of French wine made in Caifornia. But they were too impatient for that: they needed to prove themselves and make big profits quickly, so the only viable route was to wholesale copy France. Import French grapes, import French vintners, do *everything* exactly by the French playbook as much as possible. Completely the opposite of exploratory youth. Rather, it is an example of something else America is excellent at: industrializing successful processes. The U.S. is peerless (though the USSR came close at some points) at taking an idea and ramping up the scale.

As far as *experimentation* goes, I think beer is a much better example of American innovation than wine is. American microbrewing is genuinely innovative, to the extent that a large amount of Scandinavian microbrewing is directly copying ""west-coast-style"" American IPAs, American-style Imperial Stouts, and similar innovations. But I don't see the early days of CA wine as being innovative at all; they were more like trying to take the French mystique and turn it into a mass-market, factory-produced product that copied the French style as closely as possible.

Nobody said that.  

But are we really going to look at the least assertive or ""on board"" one to look for what to do and how far to go? If that's the case we might as well ask Orban if we should pay Putin some reparations. 

If we have to live with a middle ground then I hope we can at least move it a bit forward with one of the bigger nations being a bit louder and forming a block with those that share their sentiment to get something done.

There's plenty that would go further I imagine but I don't think they'd do it on their own. They don't want to take the biggest hit. Hence people look at the more assertive of the 3 to shape a more unified block

Eh why do you bring this up? In a discussion such as the one on how far we should go with our stance on Russia there's really not a shitton of roads to take that may differentiate due to cultural stances. It's pretty much a question of more or less/yes or no most of the time 

&gt;Why does it have to be a bigger country, pure leadership is not reliant on size, force however is.

Because the UK carries more weight in every possible facet. It wasn't Luxembourg we were looking at to keep Russia out of the OECD and the International Energy Agency. We weren't looking at Estonia to swing around their weight in the council or commission.

And it doesn't take much thought to see why really. You can say leadership isn't reliant on size but I'll have a laugh when I see people accusing Croatia or Estonia of having too much of a leading role in NATO and being too aggressive or any equivalent of that in the EU

true,TelevisionAntichrist,UNSA,Bad since 1776,"&gt;the two regions are very culturally different and have fundamentally opposed concepts of right and wrong.

When you write this way, you make it sound as though you are comparing Europe to *China*. I would take Peter Baldwin's (2009) ""antidote for the usual assumptions"" about the relationship between the USA and Europe. The book is called [The Narcissism of Minor Differences: How America and Europe are alike](http://www.amazon.com/The-Narcissism-Minor-Differences-America/dp/B008SLTV8A). 

I've lived in Europe for five years as an American (northern Germany), and in all this time, I have not really noticed anything I would call a *major* difference.. there are many differences, of course, but the differences I have noticed have all been what I would consider as being relatively minor. 

When I was in China in 2005, you'd go to the little pharmacy there, the apotheke, and there would not be bottles of aspirin and vitamins and cough syrup on display... nope. Instead, they had numerous little boxes laid out like a candy shop with various Eastern medicines.. such as starfish to be ground up, antlers/antler pieces to be ground up (made as tea?), various dried plants, herbs, hocus pocus up the yazoo. 

That (i.e. Eastern vs. Western medicine), I do consider a *major* difference. 

Here in Europe, I see only minor differences - and many more similarities than I think that us both sides like to admit (!)

Trust that the person(s) leading will do their utmost to achieve a desired result with a minimum of consequences to you and yours or if a sacrifice must be made then it is an absolutely necessary sacrifice that would not be asked if any other option was available.

We're not talking about a person here. The EU is not some dictatorship or lead by a single person. We're talking about countries. Nobody in this scenario needs someone or some country to ""trust"" to make the right decisions. They want someone to lead because we already agree with said decision.

You know. To lead those with a similar vision to push something trough. To tap Orban on the fingers, to stop the gerrymandering and countries trying to take the the smallest hit even though they may all agree that something needs to be done.

Even if we were in some system with an overly powerfull president or dictator basing your decision on a leader solely on unfounded trust is plain retarded.

and as much as I might even ""trust"" Lithuania that doesn't change a bloody little thing about the fact that they have a loooot less influence then Britain. It's very easy to grasp.

&gt;But you still didn't answer the question, what do you want?

I did answer your question in the first paragraph of my previous comment when I said that ""it's not either 'all having the same opinion' or 'ramming one down people's throats'.""

Here's an analogy for you:

&gt;A bunch of British soldiers sit in a trench with some SPG's on the other side. They all agree they need to rush out and take enemy positions. If they don't they'll get blown to bits by the artillery anyway. The problem is that everyone fears taking a bullet even though they'd die anyway if they stay. Everyone hopes the rest will take the hit instead of them. So they don't leave the trench at all.

&gt;Now they need someone to lead. Not to be the first out of the trench but to encourage everyone a little bit. Not to be a dictator that has the *""solution rammed down peoples throats""* by shooting at anyone who stays. Not someone who they *""trust""* to makes all the decisions on his own on which routes to take across the battlefield from cover to cover but starts the discussion on it.

&gt;Now there's something special and weird about this battalion of soldiers!

true,newappeal,advanced-english,advanced (native English),"I look at the adjective endings in someone of an odd (but hopefully linguistically logical way) that might help. On the other hand, perhaps it only makes sense because I already have the endings memorized, so casually ignore this if it's confusing.

So as you know, the adjectives have ""strong"", ""mixed"", and ""weak"" inflections, and therefore strong/mixed/weak endings. Strong is for adjectives by themselves, mixed is for adjectives following *ein*-type words, and weak is for adjectives following *der*-type words. The basic unwritten rule is that you can't have two strong endings together. You can basically think of the strong endings as those that take the most effort to pronounce. Less mouth movement is involved in /e/ than in /n/, and likewise with /n/ and /m/.

Here's how I would classify the endings from weakest to strongest: *-e* | *-n* | *-r*, *-s* (nom.) | *-r*, *-s*, *-m* (dat./gen.)

So which endings are strongest? The dative and genitive endings. You'll notice that after either a *der*-word or an *ein*-word, the adjective takes an *-n*, rather than the usual *-m*, *-r*, or *-s* ending that it would take if it were by itself. (Of course, in the dative plural, the usual ending is already *-n* anyway.) You don't say *einem gutem*, *einer guter* or *eines gutes*, probably because it takes a while to pronounce both m's or both s's, so the strong /m/, /r/, or /s/ changes to an easier-to-pronounce and weaker ( but still reasonably strong) *-n*. 

The weaker endings are the nominative and accusative endings. When preceded by a *der*-word (strong), the adjective loses its /r/ or /s/ in the masculine and neuter, leaving it with an *-e* ending. For whatever reason, nominative and accusative aren't as ""strong"" as the dative and genitive, so instead of taking the ""mixed"" *-n*, they take the ""weak"" *-e*. There are, however, two exceptions. The first is the masculine accusative, since the ending is *-n*, which (as mentioned before) is stronger than /e/, but weaker than /r/, /m/, and /s/. The *-n* stays on the adjective, since there isn't a strong ending to boot it off. The second is the masculine and neuter nominative with *ein*-words: since *ein* doesn't have endings for those cases (i.e. it's not *einer* and *eines*, but just *ein*), there's also no strong ending to boot the /r/ or /s/ off the adjective, leaving it as *ein guter Mann* or *ein gutes Buch*.

I hope this makes some degree of sense. If it doesn't, just try and remember that you can't have two m's, two r's, or two s's together, and you'll be halfway to memorizing the inflection rules. My underlying reasoning might be off a little, but I do know that the distinction between strong and weak is very important throughout German--it applies to articles, adjectives, nouns, and verbs--so if you can gain some sort of understanding of how it works, you can get a real feel for the language. If you're a native English speaker, you probably sort of understand it due to irregular English verbs--it just sort of *feels* right.

Edit: spelling

Edit 2: Just remembered that these rules I gave don't work great for the plural forms.

Some verbs that can take dative objects often take them *in addition to* accusative (like *glauben* or *entreißen*) objects and/or have some sort of meaning that makes sense with the dative (*helfen* could be interpreted as ""give help to""), but there are a few that must simply be memorized.

The most two common dative-direct-object verbs in German are *helfen* (to help) and *folgen* (to follow), along with all of their compounds (like *verfolgen* - to pursue). This are very important words that you should definitely commit to memory. For instance, you'll probably often see *Hilf mir bitte...* or *Helfen Sie mir bitte...* on question threads.

Oldenburg is a town of tea drinkers, especially the traditionally Frisian black tea mixes. Traditional alcoholic drinks are a stiff grog - hot water, spices and rum or vodka. Or hot tea laced with rum, vodka or brandy.  

If you are flying into Frankfurt, consider picking up a bottle of apple wine in Frankfurt am Main.

In short he proposes a type of government where the question of sovereignity is not solved. If people want more federalisation, more power and authority should be given to federal bodies (the parliament), while vice versa, more power to member states = more power to the commissioners. It leaves the possibility for change open and doesn't force people into a politcal union they don't want.

The EU is close to being the model he proposes, but there are some problems: 

-the democratic deficit: the federal level (EU) has gained much power, but the parliament however, has not

-Values of unity above all: he argues from a historic stnapoint that this will only lead to conflict (He takes the example of catholic church in the Middle ages). He argues that the EU should more focus with their diversity, rather than their unity.

During WW2 Sweden did very little to help out militarily, mostly training parts of the Norwegian resistance and unofficially sanctioning the use of its men and materials in Finland's fight against Soviet. As well as allowing troop movements of, primarily, Nazi Germany inside its borders.

(2) the cigarette companies know they can't win there.

They won't, I tell them, understand anything at first, but even without trying they should soon get used to hearing the sounds, then be able to pick out words, then phrases and sentences, then entire segments.

You could easily do the same with German radio: the key here is to have it on often, but you don't have to actively listen to it -- let your subconscious do the work there.

You should still do more active learning as well, and watching movies in German is a good way of doing that. It helps if it's movies you actually enjoy. On DVD or BluRay, you can usually switch subtitles on: ideally, you should probably watch in German with *German* subtitles. Use English subtitles only if you truly get frustrated.

Also, news bulletins are worth watching. If you already keep up with current affairs, then at least some of the reports will be about events you've already heard about, so you should be able to understand what the reports are about, even if you don't understand much of what is being said. Plus, you have video footage, maps, diagrams and so on, all of which will help you grasp what's going on.

&gt;**Article 7**


&gt;1. On a reasoned proposal by one third of the Member States, by the European Parliament or by the European Commission, the Council, acting by a majority of four fifths of its members after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, may determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of the values referred to in Article 2. Before making such a determination, the Council shall hear the Member State in question and may address recommendations to it, acting in accordance with the same procedure. The Council shall regularly verify that the grounds on which such a determination was made continue to apply.

&gt;2. The European Council, acting by unanimity on a proposal by one third of the Member States or by the European Commission and after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, may determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the values referred to in Article 2 after inviting the Member State in question to submit its observations.

&gt;3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 has been made, the Council, acting by a qualified majority, may decide to suspend certain of the rights deriving from the application of the Treaties to the Member State in question, including the voting rights of the representative of the government of that Member State in the Council. In doing so, the Council shall take into account the possible consequences of such a suspension on the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons.

&gt;The obligations of the Member State in question under the Treaties shall in any case continue to be binding on that State.

&gt;4. The Council, acting by a qualified majority, may decide subsequently to vary or revoke measures taken under paragraph 3 in response to changes in the situation which led to their being imposed.

&gt;5. The voting arrangements applying to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council for the purposes of this Article are laid down in Article 354of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

The referenced article 2 of the Treaty on European Union:

&gt;**Article 2**

&gt;The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.

For those who'd like to know how the procedure would look like:

 	
&gt;**Article 354**

&gt;For the purposes of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union on the suspension of certain rights resulting from Union membership, the member of the European Council or of the Council representing the Member State in question shall not take part in the vote and the Member State in question shall not be counted in the calculation of the one third or four fifths of Member States referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of that Article. Abstentions by members present in person or represented shall not prevent the adoption of decisions referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article.

&gt;For the adoption of the decisions referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, a qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(b) of this Treaty.

&gt;Where, following a decision to suspend voting rights adopted pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, the Council acts by a qualified majority on the basis of a provision of the Treaties, that qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(b) of this Treaty, or, where the Council acts on a proposal from the Commission or from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, in accordance with Article 238(3)(a).

&gt;For the purposes of Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, the European Parliament shall act by a two-thirds majority of the votes cast, representing the majority of its component Members.

&gt;Germany as a whole and its politicians in particular indeed believe that the Euro is worth it in the long run and wants to keep it going

Yes, but it's perceived, and demonstrable even, that Germany derives disproportionate benefit from the Euro in the form of weaker currencies etc. The trade surplus would not be at the magnitude it is now without the Euro or German lending to Southern Countries. It's unsustainable without fiscal transfers and such. Those should be without precondition, or, at least, with far less conditions. Monetary union of the Euro-type requires fiscal transfers to remain stable. Even in Germany alone, the currncy zone would require fiscal transfers. That was known in advance of the Euro and not committed to. 


And, as I said, the precodinitions are perceived by most economists to be counter productive. Merkel's defence? 'You didn't predict the crisis therefore I'll do what I want'. I mean, seriously? It read to me like someone with a medical condition ignoring the medical advice of a doctor and self-medicating because the doctor had initially misdiagnosed or overlooked a problem i.e. it read like a headstrong numpty who was pursuing ideological politics/trying to be appear tough at home.

Ensuite, ta solution est idiote. Elle ne rend pas compte des réalités.

They did not find any significant differences between children growing up in traditional and same sex families.

The original conclusion of the study (short version):
&gt;Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass sich Kinder und Jugendliche aus LP in Bezug auf die Beziehungsqualität zu beiden Elternteilen und in ihrer psychischen Anpassung von Kindern und Jugendlichen, die in anderen Familienformen aufwachsen, nur wenig unterscheiden. Gleiches gilt für Konflikte zwischen den Partner(inne)n in der LP sowie für Auseinandersetzungen mit dem externen Elternteil. Signifikante Unterschiede fanden sich dahingehend, dass Kinder und Jugendliche aus LP über ein höheres Selbstwertgefühl und über mehr Autonomie in der Beziehung zu beiden Elternteilen berichteten als Gleichaltrige in anderen Familienformen. Die Ergebnisse der Kinderstudie legen in der Zusammenschau nahe, dass sich Kinder und Jugendliche in Regenbogenfamilien ebenso gut entwickeln wie Kinder in anderen Familienformen. Unabhängig von der Familienform wirken sehr ähnliche Einflussfaktoren. Entscheidend für die Entwicklung der Kinder ist nicht die Struktur der Familie, sondern die Qualität der innerfamilialen Beziehungen. Für die betrachteten Entwicklungsdimensionen von Kindern und Jugendlichen erwies es sich somit als nicht bedeutsam, ob sie bei einem allein erziehenden Elternteil, zwei Müttern oder Vätern oder bei Vater und Mutter aufwachsen, sondern wie die Beziehungsqualität in diesen Familien ist. 

And the Bing translator version, because I'm lazy :P (LP stands for same-sex families)
&gt;The results show that children and young people from LP on the quality of relationships with both parents and in their psychological adaptation little differ from children and young people who Grow up on in other forms of family. The same applies to conflicts between the partners in the LP, as well as for clashes with the external parent. Accordingly, significant differences were that children and young people from LP reported a higher self-esteem and greater autonomy in the relationship with both parents than peers in other forms of family. In the synopsis, the children study results suggest that children and young people in Rainbow families as well develop as children in other family forms. Regardless of the form of the family Very much similar influence factors. The structure of the family, but the quality of innerfamilialen relations is crucial to the development of children. For the considered development dimensions of children and adolescents, it was thus as not important, whether you are a lone parent, two mothers or fathers or father and mother Grow up on, but how is the quality of the relationships in these families.

Also important to note: The study finds that a majority of the children haven't had experienced discrimination at the point the study was carried out (63% of the parents reported that their children hadn't experienced discrimination, 53% of the children reported the same) [Section 4, point 4].

Concernant les références intéressantes. Déjà la schizophrénie. Tout d'abord ce qu'il faut savoir c'est que ce qui a été mis en évidence est une corrélation entre consommation de cannabis durant l'adolescence et une prévalence plus importante de l'apparition de cette maladie. Aucune cause physiologique n'a été trouvée, ni aucun lien causal irréfutable démontré. Le risque de déduire d'une corrélation un lien causal est de passer à côté d'une cause commune aux deux phénomènes, c'est la notion de variable cachée. Dans ce cas précis, la variable cachée a peut-être été trouvée sous la forme d'un gène de prédisposition  [ref](http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/mp201451a.html). Une autre étude récente pointe plus un phénomène de prévalence familiale [ref](http://tinyurl.com/n3dblnm). Enfin, cette corrélation est mise à mal par le fait que la prévalence de la schizophrénie tend à diminuer depuis 1990 alors que la consommation de cannabis par les jeunes elle n'a cessé d'augmenter [ref](http://tinyurl.com/m7deaj). 

Concernant le cancer du poumon. Là encore, à ma connaissance aucun  papier ne démontre indubitablement le caractère cancérogène des composants de l'herbe. Tout au plus les résultats sur le sujet sont contradictoires. Entre temps, il se trouve qu'il a été montré que le THC possède des propriétés d'inhibition de la croissance tumorale (ou plus précisément des facteurs de croissance à l'origine de la prolifération) sur certaines cellules cancéreuses [ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21475304), dont celles de cancers du poumon [ref](http://www.nature.com/onc/journal/v27/n3/abs/1210641a.html). Des papiers, à nouveau récents, sèment encore plus le doute [ref1](http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201212-127FR?journalCode=annalsats&amp;&amp;&amp;#.VABf_vl_t8H),  [ref2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.29036/abstract). 

Bref, bien qu'il soit reconnu que la fumée ce cannabis (hors tabac) peut mener facilement à des syndromes type obstruction pulmonaire chronique, il est impossible d'affirmer que fumer de l'herbe soit plus, ou même autant cancérogène que la fumée de tabac ... voire même d'affirmer que fumer de l'herbe est significativement cancérogène (la littérature serait unanime, et non contradictoire si c’était le cas).. Le problème, bien sûr, est que la consommation de marijuana et de tabac sont très souvent concomitantes, ça c'est une évidence... mais dans ce cas c'est le tabac qu'il faut blâmer, et encourager les usagers de marijuana à consommer différemment (pur par combustion ou mieux: par vaporisation). 

&gt; On peut être pour la légalisation mais nier les dangers ou sortir comme example une étude pour quand toutes les autres sont contre c'est un peu dangereux je trouve (personne ne nie ceux du tabac et de l'alcool).

 D'une part, je privilégie la littérature récente, en raison des progrès importants des méthodes d'études en biologie moléculaire et en biochimie des 15-20 dernières années. Ton amie interne pourra confirmer. Par ailleurs, ça donne plus de poids aux méta-analyses ou analyses statistiques qui ont nécessairement plus de données à prendre en compte. Il se trouve que la littérature récente me semble (mais je peux me tromper) plus orientée en faveur, que contre. Peut-être un effet lié aux espoirs que suscitent les visiblement nombreuses propriétés pharmacologiques des composants du cannabis. 

Sinon, d'autre part, je ne minimise pas les dangers du cannabis, je dis juste que les arguments des prohibitionnistes, notamment en France, tapent là où ils ont tort, et sont au mieux de mauvaise foi, ou au pire symptomatiques d’une totale méconnaissance du problème. Par exemple, crier à  l’explosion du nombre de cas de schizophrénie en cas de légalisation est une insulte à l’intelligence. De même, l’argument des risques sur les routes est totalement fallacieux, le rapport [SAM](http://www.ofdt.fr/BDD/publications/docs/SAMsynth.pdf) très officiel en témoigne, et montre par exemple que la prévalence statistique du cannabis (toutes doses confondues) d’être responsable d’un accident est significativement inférieure à celle de la conduite en alcoolémie légale. Vois le rapport page 18, Odd Ratio cannabis toutes doses = 1.78, OR alcool à 0.5g/l = 2.70. As-tu déjà entendu un seul politique mentionner cela, alors qu’ils ont ce chiffre, officiellement, sous les yeux ? Note par ailleurs qu’aux USA, la dissémination de la marijuana dans la population via le cannabis médical ou récréatif va de pair avec une diminution significative des chiffres de l’accidentologie. Ils expliquent ça par un transfert alcool-&gt;cannabis… mais zut, à nouveau je n’arrive pas à retrouver la référence… pareil, je te file ça dès que je retrouve. 

Les principaux, et effectifs, dangers à mon sens viennent des effets adverses parfaitement reconnus tels que sur la mémoire à court terme, sur les processus de motivation et sur le risque, faible mais effectif, de très forte addiction. Dans les deux dernier cas, un tel effet rend **absolument rédhibitoire**  la consommation par des adolescents ou de très jeunes adultes en phase de construction (je ne te parle pas de l'étude PNAS sur la cohorte de Dunedin qui a été passablement démontée). Or, pour l'instant, tout est fait en France pour favoriser la consommation par cette population-là, en laissant le monopole de la distribution aux mafias qui savent bien cibler leur cible, et qui bien souvent sont d’ailleurs une population connexe à celle des jeunes consommateurs. 

Bon voilà, je me rends compte que j’ai écrit un pavé alors je m’arrête là. J’ai accès à quelques PDF de papiers si tu veux, mais si ton amie est interne, elle doit avoir accès à la plupart. Pour conclure, ce qui m’énerve vraiment, c’est que par définition la justice se doit d’être juste, alors que le traitement qui est réservé en France aux consommateurs de cannabis est profondément injuste, pour les raisons évoquées ci-dessus. C’est pourquoi je pense qu’il faut absolument changer les lois sur ce sujet.

Look, if you're just going to discuss this in bad faith (ha!), I don't see any reason to continue with you. I even wrote at the end of my post that if people have concerns over something that *might* be in the TTIP they should contact their MPs and MEPs. But at the moment, we don't know what has been agreed to and until we do there's no point saying 'TTIP is evil because they *might* include [x]'.

&gt;How does this help with concerns that they are entitled to sue a country? Exactly, not at all.

They're entitled to sue, that doesn't mean they win, and they may have to pay costs. I don't see the issue.

&gt;Plainly wrong. ""Regular channels"" are courts already established and instances already fulfilling the role of arbitral courts. Germany getting sued by Vattenfall for altering the energy policies? It's already taking place.

That's happening under the Energy Charter Treaty which also provides for ISDS.

But when you have a choice between ongoing war and annexation by Russia, it might be a different thing: Russia is lesser of two evils.

Federalization never was an actual options, it was invented by Russian propagandists to make it look like a true rebellion. It was never seriously considered by either of sides.

Personally I don't see federalization being a  big deal by itself, although there are concerns that it will make Dobass's corrupt politicians stronger.  ",0,1409398875,null,0,false,0,ck4jxz8,t3_2ewqfh,t1_ck4jxz8,t1_ck45ggv,null,1427284919,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Bed, desk, wardrobe, shelf, whatever you need. Furniture like kitchen tables or chairs should already be in the apartment. IKEA is in my opionion always a good place to start shopping for furniture. Obviously the furniture you buy belongs to you and you can do with it whatever you want with it, so you can take it with you when you leave the WG.
  
If you go to IKEA or any other furniture store, ask your future roomates if they need anything from there. If it's for a shared room in the house, you can offer to buy it for them or to share the costs. If they need something for their personal bedroom, they shoul give you the money for it.

true,Syndane_X,GERM,Germany,"&gt; I'm not, and don't think anyone else, is saying that Germany could not have advanced their influence in Europe by exploiting the situation. What I'm saying is, there is a perception amongst the South that they aren't doing enough to be so loud and proud of their role. 


Let me assure you that noone actually has talked about the lending or funds within the last couple months as it's a highly unpopular headline after seeing the Greek media reaction (depiction of Germany and Merkel especially). So we're not loud about it but news outlets in those countries affected might circlejerk this topic.

&gt; Yes, but it's perceived, and demonstrable even, that Germany derives disproportionate benefit from the Euro in the form of weaker currencies etc. The trade surplus would not be at the magnitude it is now without the Euro or German lending to Southern Countries. It's unsustainable without fiscal transfers and such. Those should be without precondition, or, at least, with far less conditions. Monetary union of the Euro-type requires fiscal transfers to remain stable. Even in Germany alone, the currncy zone would require fiscal transfers. That was known in advance of the Euro and not committed to. 

We had fiscal transfers when we had the DM, of course. You still have to remember that the Euro and its mechanisms have been forced upon Germany as a price for France's agreement to reunion and eventually withdrawal of troops from German soil. It is nothing we wanted but have adapted to. The blame for the lack of help towards economically inferior countries has to be directed to Paris, not Berlin.

The trade surplus however was at same levels before we had the Euro, by the way. The total sum might have changed (due to inflation etc) but Germany has had the same or even a bigger margin percentage-wise since the 70s. Our main source of income comes from outside the EU too, so while Germany has benefitted from a common market as was expected (and so does everyone else), it is not as if there wasn't anything before.

Noone will invest in a country where bribery is still on rampant levels, the public sector still generous and the tax evasion rate barely tackled. So first you have to endure a minimum support while getting your house clean, then you might be a candidate for further funds, it's as easy as that. Greeks and especially its media keeps forgetting that the Greek market doesn't offer much for German products and we're way better off when investing in other markets with more growth potential. Inside the EU the complete Eastern European bloc, outside there's a ton of partnerships and money to be made. If they hate us so much, there's about 200 other countries which can be asked for monies.

1. In 2011 Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein signed a treaty, pledging to give Hungary €150 million in 2013-2014 through EEA subsidies. (Obviously mostly Norway, they provide 97% of the funds.)
2. €133.5 million of this is distributed through the National Development Agency (government-controlled, a synonym for ""most of this is going to be stolen"" in Hungary).
3. The remaining €16.5 million is distributed directly to charitable NGOs through the [Ökotárs Foundation](http://okotars.hu/en) via a tender.
4. The Norwegian Civil Fund distributed this money to [these organizations](http://norvegcivilalap.hu/en/tamogatott). Lots of them are environmentalist, LGBT, minority and transparency organizations. Obviously the government didn't like this.
5. jános lázár, the most disgusting piece of shit in the Hungarian parliament (a really, *really* strong competition) wrote [this letter](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3TgfL2abaKyNXI4Z2hLeWZFV3M/edit) to Vidar Helgesen.
6. However, the letter published on the Hungarian government's site didn't match the one I linked. It contained another paragraph accusing Norway of trying to subvert Hungarian democracy by supporting LMP, an opposition party that got 5.26% of the votes. (Given that they are the most significant party that openly supports environmentalism, LGBT-rights, etc...)
7. Then the Hungarian government unilaterally replaced the Ökotárs Foundation with the technically-independent but state-owned Széchenyi Programiroda Nonprofit Ltd.
8. And this was the point when Helgensen decided not to pay the EEA-subsidies, because the Hungarian government violated the treaty.

This doesn't have to do anything with the Russian situation, it's simply the result of our dear government not wanting that €16.5 million to go unstolen.",0,1409402580,null,0,false,0,ck4kq2c,t3_2eye3g,t1_ck4kq2c,t3_2eye3g,null,1427284553,27,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,27

Not really. France and particularly Britain were very scared of fighting with Germany and gave him too much leeway. Germany was bluffing when they took Rhineland, Austria, then Sudetenland. If France+UK gave a strong response, they would have backed down. Instead Hitler would call a meeting explaining why this is the ""last invasion"" and UK and France would pat themselves on the back and say ""peace in our time"".

France was more willing to go to war- having a large border with Germany and being less anti-communist- but they were too scared to go alone. Britain was trying to avoid war until they absolutely had to.

Ti invito a considerare il fatto che nelle truffe, c'è una parte che conferisce denaro, e una parte che, tramite raggiro o altro, si appropria di quel denaro.

Purtroppo nella community delle cryptomonete questo è successo più e più volte (tramite precollocazione delle monete, chiamata IPO), appropriandosi dei fondi della community.

Non chiedendo denaro a NESSUNO,  se non ai nostri investitori privati, è difficile anche solo associare la parola truffa, a meno che non ci sia un interesse a farlo.

Detto ciò, la realtà è sotto gli occhi di tutti, prova a dare uno scorcio panoramico agli altri progetti... sono tutte promesse di development futuri, nessuno si è collocato nel mercato senza chiedere capitali alla community, presentando un sistema di mechant api funzionante, un sistema di private banking funzionante, ed un referral system sul mining.

Siamo stati già intervistati da diversi giornalisti e blogger del settore, e sinceramente ci hanno detto tutti che la differenza tra noi e gli altri sviluppatori è piuttosto notevole.

Sul giudizio sugli investitori, loro hanno interesse ad un network aggiuntivo di vendita prodotti, e a noi serve (e servirà) denaro per il development, non sono loro a metterci il know-How

Sul sistema PoM, lo abbiamo più volte testato sotto stress, cosa c'è di troppo bello per essere vero?

A mon avis il vaut mieux réguler et encadrer sans désinformer plus que prohiber et pénaliser aux frais du contribuables.

*This evil fascist nazi government then went onto to declare war against it's own people for the crime of being ""Russian"" (really just Russian speaking Ukrainian), drove heavy weapons to the east and began to murder Russian ""protesters"" and civilians. When these easterners armed themselves and began to defend themselves, the evil Kievan nazis responded by hiring western mercenaries, trying to shoot down President Putin's plane (but missing and hitting MH-17) and and by trying to kill as many civilians as possible.*

All the people in the east, and the Russian ""volunteers"" (which totally aren't from the Russian military) are doing is ""defending"" themselves against the ""aggression"" of the west.

That is to say in reality, the government of Ukraine is asserting its sovereignty against an illegitimate and violent uprising in potentially separatist regions - and the Russian way of viewing things is that anyone who stops you from doing what you want, even if what you want to do is illegal or immoral, is being aggressive towards you. Even if someone is simply defending themselves against you, that is aggression against you. If you look to their counter-sanctions you see this. While some nations would say ""We annexed territory from a neighbour and you sanctioned us, fair cop"" they respond angrily as if our sanctions against them are some egregious and unmerited act for which they've done nothing to deserve, so feel they must respond tit for tat as if to validate this initial innocence.

Hence your average Russian views the west as the aggressor here for not letting a minority of Easterners take up arms and secede (in spite of them all supporting Putin 10 years ago when he [destroyed an entire city](http://asg-ru.com/image/grozny5.jpg) in the 2nd Chechen war). For them, the west and Ukraine are in the wrong here, and because Putin talks tough but appears not to be rushing into any aggressive actions against ""the aggressor"" (us) he's doing an excellent job. They pretty much view themselves, and by extention him, as a victim who is handling an unreasonable and expansionist western world with finesse and strength, which fits into the Russian narrative very well as they've been a powerful nation for the last few hundred years with the exception of after the collapse of the USSR where they were very very weak, and Russians did not handle this well.",0,1409404749,null,0,1409404934,0,ck4l9iv,t3_2ezia2,t1_ck4l9iv,t1_ck4jo31,null,1427284301,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

Par ce qu'ils savent qu'ils n'auront pas la même efficacité. Il n'y a plus de police de proximité, et la police de répression n'a aucune efficacité pour prévenir les délits. Là, au moins, le boulot est fait. S'il était laissé à la police, ils savent qu'ils n'auraient pas les moyens de faire le quart du job que les dealers font (en terme de sécurisation de territoire).

&gt;Stop stop stop, je n'ai pas parlé de peine de mort ou d'augmentation des peines, j'ai demandé à ce que des peines soient systématiques -&gt; à chaque infraction il doit y a avoir une sanction, c'est ce qui est important pour changer un comportement et combattre le sentiment d'injustice.

Va falloir des sacrés budgets pour la justice, la police et l'univers carcéral. Sans compter que le boulot des juges est de garantir un certain équilibre dans la loi. Ce n'est pas par ce que la consommation est punie d'un an ( ou 3 750 € d'amende) que tu dois punir ainsi chaque consommateur. C'est cher payé pour un crime sans victime.

Au fait, je peux savoir ce que tu reproches aux consommateurs de cannabis ? 

Perso, je suis fumeur, mais ce qui me gêne le plus, c'est l'absence de cohérence dans la loi française. Si on souhaite interdire les substances qui affaiblissent la conscience, soit. Dans ce cas là, ça marche pour moi, mais on interdit aussi l'alcool. Ou alors, on considère que la seule raison pour laquelle l'alcool est autorisé, mais pas le cannabis (alors que le cannabis est, sinon moins dangereux, dans le pire des cas au même niveau), c'est en raison d'une habitude culturelle.

Or, ça change. Et vu le niveau de consommation actuel, on peut considérer que le cannabis entre dans les moeurs, et qu'au vu de cet argument, il faut l'autoriser.

Je considèrerais la loi qui m'interdit de fumer de la beuh légitime quand les autres n'auront plus le droit de boire leur pinard au restau, comme si c'était une substance sans danger.

You also support and celebrate war criminals, butchers, rapist and murderers, so your support should be taken with a grain of salt. 

The Federation was not created in Dayton but in Washington (Washington agreement of 1994) one year earlier and is a deal between those two partys, you should at least know the basics. 

Also the Bosnian Croats that make up 14% of the population control half of the Federational Cantons, and one third of the state government.

Bosnian Croats have much more power in Bosnia that is proportional to their numbers.

Also there is no Croatian demand for autonomic regions in Bosnia, firstly because they already have almost complete autonomy in the cantons they control and secondly such an proper autonomic region would not have territorial integrity, just like the RS.

The demands for more autonomy are painted as such by the genocide product called RS in an effort to destabilize the Federation as much as possible.

The current problems in Bosniak and Bosnian Croat relations is based on the principle of presidency voting.

The problem here is that in the last elections the Croat member of the presidency was not voted in by majority Bosnian Croats but by Bosnian Bosniaks, even though the candidate himself is a Croat and did get some Croat votes (the logic here is that the elections should be based on citizenship merits not ethnicity based) and that created a need to set new rules for presidency elections in the Federation, thats all.

Generally, when English speaking countries cluster within a poll or index, the first thing one should do is check whether the methodology is biased towards this outcome. That the creator of the index happens to be based in Britain isn't helping; if they phrase their polls such that it is more compatible with the way charity operates in Britain/English speaking countries, then it's expected for them to come out on top. It's the same with university rankings; France and Germany often get worse results, especially because their universities focus more on teaching and split the research into separate but associated institutes that lead to the false impression that the universities aren't doing good or much research.

If you compare the index with the per capita government development aid or in relation to government development aid per gross national income (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governments_by_development_aid), then you'll see that there is a discrepancy that must be explained somehow. Sure, it's not measuring the same as the giving index, but it is something similar. I could imagine that other countries might be more used to doing charitable work through higher taxes and government institutions which would not show up in the WGI. Similarly, I personally am a paying member of the local Malteser chapter and if you asked me whether I donated money to an organisation last month out of the blue I would probably not remember my monthly contribution; but I'm still paying it.

&gt; Sull'hashpower potenziale, la mitigazione attacco arriva sino all'hashpower potenziale di tutto il network, esattamente come altre cryptomonete

Certo, con la differenza che altre criptomonete hanno network piuttosto importanti alle spalle e sono sempre dedicati alla propria blockchain.

E come si fa a sapere che la vostra chain è quella 'corretta'? è la caratteristica saliente delle criptomonete il fatto che la validità di una chain sia garantita dal consenso del network e, in ultima analisi, da quale versione ha dietro più hashpower.

Mi spiace, ma qui state pronendo una criptomoneta e un sistema di pagamento elettronico basati su promesse inverificabili di sicurezza, che non è diverso da tante fregature che si sono viste nell'ambiente negli anni.

Du sagst ""WTF"", ich sage ""aber selbstverständlich doch"". Das halte ich für einen essenziellen Bestandteil der russischen Innenpolitik und Außendarstellung. Zum Inneren ist zu sagen, dass seit dem Umgang mit Pussy Riot und dem Gesetz zur/gegen die Darstellung von homosexuellen Akten in der Öffentlichkeit die Position des russischen Staates in diesen Politikfeldern offensichtlich ist. Das ist ein in Sachen 'politischer Kosten' günstiger Weg, die Reihen geschlossen zu halten, was man auch in Deutschland gesehen hat: In einem der Townhall-Meetings auf ARD vor der Bundestagswahl hat Mutti einem schwulen Mann ins Gesicht gesagt, dass er solange sie lebt wohl kein Kind adoptieren wird. Der Herr im Publikum wird sie wohl ohnehin kaum gewählt haben, dafür aber ein paar von den Leuten, die sich gerne darüber monieren, wie weit die Union unter Mutti doch nach links gerutscht sei und stattdessen vielleicht lieber der AfD ihre Stimme geben wollten. Dieses Handlungsmuster kann man meiner Ansicht nach auf Russland übertragen.

Nach außen verhält es sich ganz ähnlich. Es liegt Russland offenbar am Herzen, bei den sozial konservativen und noch weiter rechts liegenden Kräften anzudocken. Diverse illiberale Demokraten aus ganz Europa, Russland eingeschlossen, haben sich noch im Juni in Wien getroffen¹, und Ungarns starker Mann Orban sucht auch engere Beziehungen zu Russland². Diese Teile des Elektorats, die sich im politischen Spektrum nicht mehr vertreten fühlen, werden von RT aktiviert und von Le Pen et al. eingesammelt, in der Wirkung als fünfte Kolonne für Russland. Seinerseits macht Russland ja auch keinen Hehl darum, dass es der Ansicht ist, dass westliche NGOs und Projekte zur Unterstützung der russischen Zivilgesellschaft den selben Effekt auf Russland haben sollen.

Man bekam seinen gesponserte Marionettenregierung die schnellstmöglich in die Nato und EU wollte und sofort unter die Fuchtel des IWF flüchtete. Auch das gehört ja mittlerweile zur Allgemeinbildung.

Dass die Russen ihre Marinebasis los sind, wenn die Ukraine sich der Nato anschließt war denen klar, dementsprechend die Übernahme der Krim unter fadenscheiniger Begründung.

Im Osten der Ukraine geht es den Russen jetzt darum eine Pufferzone zwischen sich und der Nato einzurichten. Das ist auch bereits geschehen, so lange dort Freiheitskämpfer gegen die ukrainische Junta kämpfen, kann die Ukraine nicht in die Nato. Früher oder später wird die Ostukraine autonom und von den Russen anerkannt, damit hat man dann alles und darüber hinaus erreicht. Das selbe kennen wir aus Georgien, aber daran können sich in Deutschland ja weder die Presse noch die dummen Bürger erinnern und versuchen deshalb den dritten Weltkrieg herbeizuschreiben. 

Die Europäer werden dann wie immer die Zeche für die amerikanischen Großmachtsambitionen zahlen und den pleiten Rest der Ukraine stützen. Gleichzeitig wird für die Europäer Fracking zur neuen Realität weil man muss ja unabhängig werden vom russischen Gas. Die amerikanischen Frackingunternehmen stehen schon bereit.

I've not actually been into Innsbruck itself, but it's in a mountain valley.

After Wörgl, you'd leave the Inn valley and drive through some of the ski resorts, and then cut through the extreme south-east corner of Germany -- if you have time, visit Berchtesgaden and the famous Eagle's Nest -- to get to Salzburg.

Moreover, any agreement, including the Washington agreement, was inevitably going to be provisional in some sense, pending the end of the war.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Ist ja mittlerweile unbestritten, dass die Nato die Faschisten ausbildet, die während des durch die USA gesteuerten Putsches auf die Bevölkerung schossen. 

Wow. Unbestritten? Soweit ich weiß ist nicht geklärt wer die Schützen waren. Es ist auch nicht klar, dass diese von der NATO ausgebildet wurden. Das der Putsch durch die USA gesteuert wurde... ist auch verfälschend. Es gibt und gab hohe Zuwendungen vom Westen die in NGOs in Russland und auch in die Ukraine gingen - die letzlich die Absicht hatten die dortige Opposition zu unterstützen und durch Zivielgesellschaftliche Organiation eine Öffentlichkeit aufzubauen. Ich denke es ist nicht belegt, dass hier so etwas wie der CIA Putsch in Chile  geschehen ist. Vielleicht wird sich das nochmal ändern, aber im Moment kann man einfach nicht behaupten das das unbestritten ist. 

&gt; Man bekam seinen gesponserte Marionettenregierung die schnellstmöglich in die Nato und EU wollte und sofort unter die Fuchtel des IWF flüchtete. Auch das gehört ja mittlerweile zur Allgemeinbildung.

Mit Rechten Dingen ist da sicherlich nicht nicht alles abgelaufen. Aber die Zuwendung zur EU war letzlich Ursache und Hauptziel der Maidan-Bewegung. Das die Ukraine in die NATO möchte ist natürlich verständlich - aber das halte ich für ziemlich unrealistisch. 

&gt; Dass die Russen ihre Marinebasis los sind, wenn die Ukraine sich der Nato anschließt war denen klar, dementsprechend die Übernahme der Krim unter fadenscheiniger Begründung.

Das ist eine Möglichkeit. Aber soweit ich das verstanden habe, waren die Verlängerung der Verträge nie ein Thema. Zudem wurde ein NATO-Beitritt der Ukraine schon einmal abgelehnt. Die Ausgangslage war nicht umbedingt so einseitig, wie du das hier darstellst. 

&gt; Im Osten der Ukraine geht es den Russen jetzt darum eine Pufferzone zwischen sich und der Nato einzurichten. Das ist auch bereits geschehen, so lange dort Freiheitskämpfer gegen die ukrainische Junta kämpfen, kann die Ukraine nicht in die Nato. Früher oder später wird die Ostukraine autonom und von den Russen anerkannt, damit hat man dann alles und darüber hinaus erreicht. Das selbe kennen wir aus Georgien, aber daran können sich in Deutschland ja weder die Presse noch die dummen Bürger erinnern und versuchen deshalb den dritten Weltkrieg herbeizuschreiben.

Hier würd ich mir dir D'accord gehen. Russland hat kein Interesse an einer properierenden Ukraine, die erfolgreich Korruption bekämpft und sich dem Western öffnet. Und das auch noch vor der eigenen Haustür. Dann ist das Signal für alle umliegenden Ex-Sowjetunion Republiken, dass dies Möglich ist... ob das selbst wenn Russland sich nicht eingemischt hätte so gekommen wäre ist unklar. Die jetzige Situation nutzt aber vor allem Russland. 

&gt; Die Europäer werden dann wie immer die Zeche für die amerikanischen Großmachtsambitionen zahlen und den pleiten Rest der Ukraine stützen. Gleichzeitig wird für die Europäer Fracking zur neuen Realität weil man muss ja unabhängig werden vom russischen Gas. Die amerikanischen Frackingunternehmen stehen schon bereit.

Ich denk auch es ist nicht völlig absurd anzunehmen, dass eine instabile ""failed state"" Ukraine auch den Amerikern nützt. Europa sieht definitiv schlecht aus in diesem Konflikt.

true,Bobo-_-,NETH,The Netherlands,"Croats and Bosniaks fought against the Serbs in the beginning and were making headway despite the lack of arms and tactical know how. The split between the Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats was caused by Tudman and Mate Boban who wanted the [Karadordevo agreement](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Karajordjevo_agreement_1991.png) to work, and did not want to make the Bosnian Muslim stronger. 

This was a miscalculation by Tudman and the Croat leadership in Bosnia as this made the Serbs in Bosnia and to a lesser degree in Croatia stronger and gave them more military success against the Croats and Bosniaks. The fighting between Bosniaks and Croats prolonged the war in Bosnia and Croatia by a few years.

After the signing of the Washington agreement the Croats and Bosniaks united there efforts and began defeating the Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia. Operation Storm would have never been successful without the unhindered military access of Croatian forces in Bosnia.

As for the Dayton Accords, they were the best deal the Serbs in Bosnia got if you look at the [map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mistral_2#mediaviewer/File:1995_Croat_and_Bosniak_Counteroffensives.jpg) of Bosnia before the negotiations The Serbs were a few weeks/months away from total defeat as the combined Croat and Bosniak forces were only 15km from Banja Luka. But pressure from NATO and Tudman unwillingness to push the Croatian army deeper into Bosnia, brought all party's to the negotiating table and a deal was struck.

Everyone knows that sondages are often grossly inaccurate. And that the media pick them up to spread incendiary messages.    Earlier I cited the whole ""barack obama"" scare during which a lot of people thought he was a foreigner or a nazi.  I don't have a sondage to back it up, but I'm sure at some point someone did one, and it made americans look stupid.  Just as you know very well that 30 percent of french people do not support lePen. 

I'm not sure where I'm going with this I just...I don't know how to package my message without being offensive, and being downvoted, but I assure you my intention is not to be obnoxious.  The ""message"" that I want to package, the same one from the beginning, is that France's importance for americans is incredibly low.  What happens in France means almost nothing for most americans.  You guys are not exactly our ennemies; your'e allies with whom we occasionally butt heads.   I checked out who Ezra Klein is, and apparently newsweek ran this story, so ok, I live under a rock.  But believe me, this story will not ""stick with americans.""   Nothing sticks, in the news, especially nothing about france.  If it was a story that was running nonstop, like a story about russia, or iran, or north korea, or iraq, it might stick a bit.  But believe me, nobody is going to be talking about this. 

As for it being a government sanctioned publicity stunt:   The people who did the survey are british, not american.   http://www.icmresearch.com/

I partially disagree with the people here who disagree with the main implications of the whole ""americans don't care about france"" thing.   

you guys think that because we don't care about france, we are ripe for negative stereotypes which are destructive.  this is true. 

But what you don't realize is that if a country is not in the media on a regular basis, and occupies no significant place as a threat, it's a good thing, because nobody sticks to this bad press.  They stick to bad and good, overall it's not an emotionally charged topic. 

anyways.   I do admit to living in a liberal bubble of educated and open minded people, most of whom have lived abroad.   Maybe this is all in my head. ",0,1409415165,null,0,false,0,ck4p1eg,t3_2ewklx,t1_ck4p1eg,t1_ck4oror,null,1427282518,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

In the US a loud minority supported the war in Iraq initially because they bought the WMDs + dictator stuff - the civic duty to intervene line - the majority of the population supported the war passively - not really arguing against it because it was part of the War of Terror and as such was supposed to make Americans safer - and then a loud minority opposed the war - artists like the Dixie chicks, some politicians, some TV pundits and celebrities - and they were shat on - but it showed that not everybody bought into it and slowly people started changing their minds in part thanks to these people.

Same thing is happening in Russia ATM. Russian rock legend Andrei Makarevich has been branded a traitor, a money grubbing whore with financial interests in Ukraine and a morally unsound person. Why? Because he stood up for Ukraine and recently wrote an open letter to Putin questioning Russia's involvement in Ukraine which he published in a local paper. 

Sheeple will be sheeple - a lot of people will buy into the ideology until they are told otherwise - but as the war progresses and more and more Russians die and the Russian economy suffers - people wont be as supportive of the state.

true,avataRJ,FINL,Finland,"As far as I understand, with NATO countries there are few important distinctions.

First, in the Gulf of Finland, it might not be entirely unplausible that the Russian planes were actually just off-course. Okay, it'd tell us pretty bad things about the state of GLONASS, but still remotely possible. The strip of international airspace is quite narrow. Second, Russian planes use those routes to travel from Leningrad Oblast to Kaliningrad, and there is literally no other route (since non-civilian aircraft can't take a shortcut over the Baltic states). Third, the craft were within Finnish airspace.

Now, around America or Scotland there's a wealth of international airspace, so anyone coming close has no real excuse. In most cases (unless the Russians get a base in Cuba) the planes can't be on a ferry flight. And as far as I am aware, Russian state aircraft have not actually entered American or British airspace and have been met by interceptors at the border.

One of the probable reasons for relocating fighters is that the Finnish Air Force isn't equipped to keep an interceptor in the air 24/7, and that would be necessary if they'd go shadow all the Russian air traffic close to the border. If they're having planes closer, they might manage to scramble in time to go say hello. (This would be a bad idea if they were under fire, because they wouldn't have time to react if the base came under attack.) USAF might see a plane coming a few hundred klicks away over the Pacific - in FiAF's case, the distance from Helsinki (Finland, north of the Gulf of Finland) and Tallinn (Estonia, south of the gulf) is 82 km. This includes some Finnish airspace, a narrow corridor of international airspace, and some Estonian airspace.

true,thewimsey,null,null,"All cow meat is kosher. As are the sweetbreads, the brains, and every organ except - usually - the kidneys. 

But the sciatic nerve is not, and it takes some extra work to cut around it. So, in many cases, the slaughterhouse would sell the front part of the animal to kosher butchers, because this meat was nowhere near the nerve. And sell the rear to non kosher establishments.  

So brisket was always readily available, as it came from the front of the animal. While filet mignon, or rump roast, etc., were often not available, even though they are not by definition treyf and can be sold as kosher if properly butchered.

Note also that the corned beef, while invented in medieval Europe, was much more commonly consumed in the US than in Europe, because beef was so much less expensive in the US.  I don't believe that corned beef, particularly corned beef sandwiches from the deli, was actually eaten by Jews living in Germany before world war two.

If you are, then your culture is farrrr more worries about manners, being a good guest, etc. Not that italians dont acknowledge politeness...but they dont put the same emphasis on manners as you may. Its just a cultural thing.

3: italians give everybody food and wine. And if youre the guest you cant do a damn thing....thats the way it is. For me (im american) it is a bit awkward because im used to asking if i can dp dishes, clean, etc. I was also taught not to have seconds when i eat dinner at a persons house because its rude to take from others. But in italy, its rude to deny food if your at someones house.

4: are you young? If so, the family probably understands/ expects nothing from you. I know my family expects nothing from my friends because we dont have much to offer. A lot of parents are just happy to share moments with their kids and their friends.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Oh, I've just built up an understanding over years from reading books, seeing what the Russian state says, and also importantly, by witnessing what Russians say themselves. I've also got the benefit of having a very close friend who's fluent to native levels in Russian so can translate and keep me to date in general. In short: read a lot. 

To understand Russia it helps to read books on the history of the nation, from at least late tsarist times to modern times. In some ways it's a very simple, homogeneous nation and yet at the same time there are serious complexities that need to be understood. I found that once I had an understanding of the mindset I could understand all actions much more easily. By putting together what you see from Russian media, from Russian actions, from what Russian people themselves will say, you can string together *their* narrative in your head, which unless you speak Russian and have access to their news media (and, really, a lack of access to ours) you won't be able to access directly. If you understand the world from another person's eyes you can begin to understand why their beliefs and actions seem rational to them, or at least not completely insane.

So yeah, basically, read lots of history books and keep up to date via a variety of news sources.

Naja, aber das Lachen bleibt mir im Hals stecken, wenn ich da an sowas denke:

http://www.ag-friedensforschung.de/themen/NATO-Krieg/ard08-02-01.html

&gt; Nuhi Uka und Fatmir Zymeri sind Bewohner des kleinen Kosovo-Dorfes Petershtica. In ihrem Ort waren laut Verteidigungsministerium Serben eingedrungen, hatten in den Kellern die Gashähne geöffnet und dann auf den Dachböden Kerzen angezündet. Doch das hat in Petershtica niemals stattgefunden, berichten alle Bewohner übereinstimmend. In der Hand hält Fatmir Zymeri das vom Bundesverteidigungsministerium veröffentlichte Satellitenfoto auf dem sein Dorf zu sehen ist und das eine Bildunterschrift trägt, derzufolge dieses Dorf nach der sog. ""Kerzenmethode"" zerstört worden war. - Auch dazu wusste Scharping im Interview nichts mehr zu sagen.

Ich erinnere mich noch, als ich -- ich glaube in ""Monitor"" der ARD, oder aber Frontal 21, nicht mehr sicher -- sah, wie ein Journalist Scharping das erklärte, dass das gar nicht geht, da das Gas gewöhnlich schwerer als Luft ist. Scharping glotzte nur blöde für einen Moment, dann meinte er, ""haben sie es schonmal mit Propan-Gas probiert?"" (bzw. ""hamsies schonmal mit brobban-gas brobbiert""), und wie der Journalist erwiderte, das würde auch nicht gehen, da auch schwerer als Luft. Da hat Scharping dann tatsächlich wortlos das Interview beendet, einfach gar nicht drauf geantwortet.

Damals kannte ich Bill Hicks noch nicht, aber das war mein erster ""WTF, die lügen uns hier frech ins Gesicht und nix passiert?""-Moment. Ich war völlig baff.

I guess the ""beide"" is the translation for ""They are both (...)"" However, ""beide"" can only refer to two persons, so ""sowohl"" is better. Besides, ""weiß, gelb und schwarz"" might sound somewhat racist, so it might be better to say:

Sure, just as I am effectively an employee of SanCorp because my wife works for them. What a dumb analogy.

What I'm about to say is ugly but I think it's pretty close to the truth:

- The Baltics are itching to help out Ukraine, because they think it's going to teach Russia a lesson about playing bully. However, they don't feel like doing it alone, so they want their Western partners to join in the fun. The Western partners don't see much of an advantage in fighting Russia over Ukraine, so they are not really up for the gig.

- Ukraine, or rather the Kiev government, is currently playing at being the EU's best friend because it desperately needs a hand; if the situation were calmer, Kiev would likely go back to its policy of ambiguity and playing both sides against each other which it had maintained for close to two decades after independence.

- The above is one big reason why Western countries don't want to put boots on the ground for Ukraine. If the country had thrown its lot with the West in the previous years then it would be a beleaguered ally in need of help, but as it is now it appears like an opportunist whose two-faced policies blew up in its face, and that's not someone you're willing to bleed for.

That's the situation as I see it. The EU could conceivably gain some advantage by integrating Ukraine in the form of a) stealing it from Russia b) getting access to whatever fossil fuels are under its territory and c) getting a nice big land border to threaten Russia with. Right now, option a) doesn't look too appetizing, option b) is mostly speculative and option c) is something that could be worth fighting for in 50 years with a federal EU, but not now.",0,1409420063,null,0,false,0,ck4r5s0,t3_2f0g8k,t1_ck4r5s0,t3_2f0g8k,null,1427281528,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

We don't have an organized event like that (like the state of the union) ourselves that cuts into regular programing.

We also get a annual speech at Christmas from our king, but since he lacks any power it's usually about how important it is to work together, be tolerant and so on.

That's not an analogy. It's a statement. An analogy is comparing situation A, by telling it as if it were situation B which looks like it, to get across a point. 

For example Niels Bohr's analogy between the model of the Atom and the model of the Solar system:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bohr_atom_model_English.svg

He compared the Atom to the Solar system even though they're completely different things that looked a bit like each other in order to get his point across of what an Atom is.

Simply saying:

Russia fights Ukraine, Ukraine wants to join the EU, thus Russia is fighting the EU. Is not using an analogy. You're simply stating something.

If Russia were to begin to invade NATO members, what would happen is that NATO would send in an enormous amount of supplies and weapons. I meant we're talking a WWII type of supply line. But the fighting would have to be done by those countries.

The foo foo sanctions we've seen so far would become true sanctions with real teeth.

As far as direct conflict, no one is going to fire nukes...it's just too self-destructive. NATO members would probably provide air strikes but no ground troops. If Russia persisted they'd probably win but it would leave world relations in shambles. NATO would be uncovered as a fraud (particularly for the newer members), the USSR would be reconstituted and we'd basically go back to the Cold War. Lots of words, lots of proxy fights in satellite countries but no worldwide conflagration.

Putin may have figured out that world war is off the table so the risks of taking back the former soviet republics is actually *smaller* than it would be in nuclear weapons didn't exist. Take nuclear weapons off the table and Putin would then be facing a united planet ready to attack Russia on every side. Put nuclear weapons back on the table and no one can really do anything in terms of actually, for example, encircling and taking over Moscow.

Mir ist nur die klare Einseitigkeit von RT aufgefallen. Dafür muss man doch nicht von seiner Meinung überzeugt um es merkwürdig zu finden, wenn 4 Korrespondenten gemeinsam während eines Interviews anfangen zu lachen über die gleichen Themen und sich gegenseitig in ihrer Sichtweise bestätigen. 

Es gibt Kritierien für Journalismus an denen kann man ein Medium messen. Es gibt Methoden für die Recherche wonach sich Meldungen als eher richtig oder falsch einordnen lassen. 

z.B. geht bei Facebook herum, dass Edward Snowden veröffentlich hätte, dass ISIS eigentlich eine Mossad Operation ist. Alle Relevanten Stellen dementieren dass dementsprechend findet es sich nicht in den deutschen Medien. Darüber hinaus ist das schwer möglich da Snowden seit einiger Zeit in Russland ist und dort keinen Zugriff auf geheime Informationen hat.

I'll just copy the same bit until you understand:

An analogy is comparing situation A, by telling it as if it were situation B which looks like it, to get across a point.
For example Niels Bohr's analogy between the model of the Atom and the model of the Solar system:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bohr_atom_model_English.svg
He compared the Atom to the Solar system even though they're completely different things that looked a bit like each other in order to get his point across of what an Atom is.

&gt; If you are going to be an obnoxious grammar nazi at least do your homework: every analogy is also a statement, for obvious reasons.

Here is my homework: An analogy is a statement, but not every statement is an analogy. To make it more clear to you:

The quote of the Lithuanian president was a non-analogy statement. I thought you could make that up from the text, I guess I'll just have to explain it more simply then.

The names of the snipers are unknown, but will probably have come from one the Fascist Neo Nazi groups in the West of Ukraine. Kiev called off the investigation into the identity of the snipers who murdered the protestors soon after they came into power.

The coup in Kiev was engineered by the Neocons Victoria Nuland and John McCain. 

Why hasn't Obama fired Neocon Victoria Nuland as Asst Sec of State? Why didn't he fire her as soon as he took office in 2009?

The Not-So-Secret Ukraine Phone Call http://www.thenation.com/blog/178293/not-so-secret-ukraine-phone-call#

Extract from the article:-

Let it first be noted that it shouldn’t be surprising that Nuland would come off as a would-be imperialist or game player. If anything, she’s long been the neoconservative inside the Obama administration. For starters, for years she served as chief foreign policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney and then as the George W. Bush administration’s ambassador to NATO. She’s married to another prominent neocon, Robert Kagan, one of the co-founders of the Project for a New American Century, the outfit that did more than any other to promote the invasion of Iraq starting in the late 1990s. For two years, Nuland served as the official spokesperson for the US State Department. Why President Obama let Nuland into his administration is anyone’s guess, but there she is.

Why did Russia and USA build so many nukes to be able nuke the whole world multiple times during the cold war? It's not always easy to find a rational explanation for everything, if you exclude ""provoking the other side"".

Russia may think that the base and the troops who are stationed there could be used for an offense or at least help a nato offense. That's what everybody thinks of the Russian troops which are stationed next to Ukraine, even though Russia says that there are there for defensive purposes (Some of the troops already seem to be in Ukraine).

Maybe the Baltics desire them because they don't believe that Nato would otherwise help in case of an invasion. There could be many reasons. 

Right now I don't think that the German parliament would send German to the Baltics, if there is no imminent and real threat. As long as Russia didn't officially declare war with Ukraine, there is still hope that the whole situation will be defused even though it becomes more unlikely every day. I don't think that anybody wants a new arms race or a cold war.

L'ex CCCP è un paese **immenso**, più grande di USA, Canada e Cina, ma al contrario della credenza popolare quasi tutto il territorio è abitato, fino ai luoghi più estremi nel circolo polare artico. Nell'immensità di questo paese c'è praticamente qualsiasi risorsa immaginabile, faccio qualche esempio:

Gas che viene dato a più di mezza Europa e paesi asiatici, di recente hanno anche deciso di potenziare tutte le condutture verso la Cina con un contratto **multimiliardario**.

Petrolio con giacimenti su terra ferma e praticamente ovunque nel circolo polare artico.

Titanio con cui vengono costruiti aerei civili, militari e con cui si fa ricerca aerospaziale. Se non sbaglio quasi l'80% del titanio estratto su questo pianeta proviene dalla Russia. Quando gli USA costruirono il Blackbird SR71 dovettero creare aziende false dirette dalla CIA per importare questo metallo.

Diamanti, tutta la parte nord-est della Russia è praticamente una miniera immensa.

(ah e le risorse energetiche/minerarie utilizzate sono solo una parte, il governo russo negli ultimi 15 anni ha scandagliato con la lente d'ingrandimento quasi tutto il territorio trovando altrettanti giacimenti non ancora sfruttati) 

Armi, l'AK47 è l'arma più venduta al mondo, sulla falsa riga anche i carri armati e aerei militari.

Cibo e allevamenti, è vero che una volta si diceva ""Ukraina granaio d'Europa"" ma in realtà vale lo stesso per porzioni di Russia grandi quasi quanto l'Ukraina.

Ricerca e mezzi spaziali, i russi sono attualmente gli unici che portano gli astronauti nella stazione spaziale ISS (e li riportano sulla Terra), visto che gli USA hanno cancellato il programma Shuttle e nessun altro paese al mondo ha dei razzi funzionanti per portare l'uomo in orbita.

Sono una tra le prime potenze nucleari mondiali a livello di armamenti ed energia.

&gt; ma perché il pubblico russo è abituato a fame e merda e per di più completamente plagiato dai media di stato

Questo forse al tempo degli Zar, sin dai tempi dell'Unione Sovietica nessuna città è morta di freddo, anzi, in inverno quando fuori fa -30 a Mosca in casa si sta in maniche corte perché è tutto praticamente sovra riscaldato in qualsiasi edificio, da quello nuovo a quello vecchio di 70 anni, i termosifoni sono grandi il doppio e tutte le case hanno doppie finistre. Il cibo poi, voi non avete la minima idea della quantità di cibo che c'è, sempre per fare un esempio a Chelyabinsk il comune supermercato sotto casa è grande come un InterSpar con parcheggio interrato in Italia.

Infine per rispondere sui media che fanno il lavaggio alla popolazione, attualmente alla gente russa non frega praticamente un cazzo di quello che succede fuori dalla Russia. Ok le madri dei soldati che sono e saranno in Ukraina hanno il diritto di sapere dei propri figli, ma per il resto si vive più che tranquillamente. 
Esistono i giornali estremisti ma esistono altrettanti giornali neutrali e anche contro il governo ma la storia che ammazzano **tutti** i giornalisti dissidenti è pura follia. 

Dovete inoltre capire che la mentalità, la società e la cultura russa sono completamente differenti da quella europea, come è differente quella americana che tanto piace quando è il momento di fare la voce grossa.
Non voglio dire che questo sia un paese di santi, ci mancherebbe, voglio dire che come paese hanno i propri difetti e pregi come gli stessi USA. Entrambi hanno gli estremisti, da una parte ci sono quelli ancora convinti di vivere nella guerra fredda, di qua ci sono quelli convinti che l'impero ortodosso russo debba venir ristabilito, o come noi qua abbiamo i comBlottisti grillini.

Fatevi un piacere, andate una volta nella vita in Russia.

Unfortunately that's only good if it is a two way street: as it stands Russia is *never* at a loss for propaganda material, nor are they wary of provoking war.

Yes, I'm sure that the fact that you are right on Russia's border and about the next country in Europe to be subject to Russia's bullying has no bearing on your feelings towards Ukraine. 

Come on, there's nothing wrong in what the Baltics are doing, but let's drop the morality play. If Lithuanians were pious selfless moral crusaders they'd be clamoring for armed intervention in Syria or the toppling of North Korea, both of those far worse situations than anything that's happening in Ukraine, which also both happen to be very far away both geographically and geopolitically.

The EU warned in 2012 that Ukrainian MP's should refrain from associating themselves with these Neo Nazi Fascist parties.

The Azov brigade, fighting for Kiev, is the private army of a Ukrainian oligarch and is entirely made up of Fascist volunteers.

This is a recent Human Rights Watch article about the deliberate shelling, mass murder and program of ethnic cleansing that the Kiev regime have been conducting in Eastern Ukraine.

The Dead and the Living in Luhansk http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/08/29/the_dead_and_the_living_in_luhansk_ukraine_russia_war

The Maidan protests didn't start to get violent until they were infiltrated by Fascist thugs from Pravy Sector.

The sniper fire in Maidan Square came from the Ukraine Hotel, which was under the control of the Maidan protestors throughout. The names of the snipers are unknown, but will probably have come from one the Fascist Neo Nazi groups in the West of Ukraine. Kiev called off the investigation into the identity of the snipers who murdered the protestors soon after they came into power.

The coup in Kiev was engineered by the Neocons Victoria Nuland and John McCain.

Why hasn't Obama fired Neocon Victoria Nuland as Asst Sec of State? Why didn't he fire her as soon as he took office in 2009?

The Not-So-Secret Ukraine Phone Call http://www.thenation.com/blog/178293/not-so-secret-ukraine-phone-call#

Extract from the article:-

Let it first be noted that it shouldn’t be surprising that Nuland would come off as a would-be imperialist or game player. If anything, she’s long been the neoconservative inside the Obama administration. For starters, for years she served as chief foreign policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney and then as the George W. Bush administration’s ambassador to NATO. She’s married to another prominent neocon, Robert Kagan, one of the co-founders of the Project for a New American Century, the outfit that did more than any other to promote the invasion of Iraq starting in the late 1990s. For two years, Nuland served as the official spokesperson for the US State Department. Why President Obama let Nuland into his administration is anyone’s guess, but there she is.

Solo che a differenza degli amati F35 in Russia fanno i caccia con metà dei soldi ma con migliori prestazioni.

Le risorse minerarie grezze e l'energia sono **fondamentali** ai paesi come l'Italia e tutti gli altri paesi che non hanno proprie risorse. Se la Russia non ci vende più i metalli o altro siamo comunque fottuti.

Non nego che il mercato Russo abbia dei problemi ora con l'import/export dei prodotti alimentari, ma quando semplicemente aumenteranno import ed export con i paesi dell'asia e del sud america per loro sarà tutto risolto.

Das ist allerdigs bei so ziemlich allen Medien mehr oder weniger der Fall. Bei der gezielten Meinungsbildung dieses Senders ist es alllerdings etwas spezieller ... so drückt RT die direkte Meinung der russischen Regierung aus, was sie somit, für kritische Menschen, sehr offensichtlich macht. Ich erinnere mich da an zwei (?) Moderatoren die vor laufender Kamera ihren Unmut über die Einseitigkeit kundtaten und kündigten. Soetwas wird man in den ""westlichen"" Medien nicht so schnell sehen. Da diese weniger eine einzelne Meinung vertreten, sondern die einer Gruppe von Menschen bzw. der jeweiligen Zielgruppen. So vertreten die ""etablierten"" deutschen Medien meist eine bürgerlich konservative oder (zum Teil) sozialdemokratische Meinung, ohne jedoch zusehr in Betonkopfideologie zu verfallen. Denn dank des Kapitalismus sind diese Medien auf ihre Verkaufs- und Zuschauerzahlen angewiesen. Und da diese Zielgruppen meist keine vereinheitlichte Meinung vertreten, sondern eher ein diversifizierzes Spektrum an Meinungen, ist das Bild oft etwas neutraler. 
(Die Öffentlich Rechtlichen mal aussen vor gelassen)

RT hat allerdings nur einen einzigen Zweck und wird wohl als Instrument des Kreml dessen Rückendeckung nicht so schnell verlieren, was auch einen stetigen Geldfuss garantiert. 

Allerdings ist RT da nicht ganz alleine ... wenn man sich FOXNEWS aus den USA anschaut. Dies ist ebenfalls ein von einer rechten Elite innerhalb republikanischen Partei gestützes Medium.

Im Großen und Ganzen muss man einfach immer die Grundregeln des kritischen Lesens beachten ...

Nice job making yourself look racist with the sports comment, though.

10+ years of being at war in Afghanistan and Iraq, losing Afghanistan and now with ISIS potentially losing Iraq after all that, is what put the US in this position in the first place that it can't contain China and Russia. Obama took the right steps toward teaming with Russia to contain Chinese growth. He also took the right steps in pulling out of the Middle East, or Russia would be able to do all of this knowing full well that the US couldn't respond.

The US still is the one and only superpower. The EU put itself in a position where it's not protecting its own interests but instead putting NATO at the front *because* the US still pulls the strings. Despite all of its problems, its ability to project hard power is unmatched. Shame Poles were scared of Bush's missile bases. Better hope you never really need the US because, without those ""missile bases"" and everything that sits on top of them to keep them safe, you could be in another situation like in '39. Truth is you know that you don't want to upset the Russians no matter how much you hate them.

Now, better hurry, there might be another statue somewhere the Russians want you take down.

This is where you're wrong. The positive effects are numerous but for the sake of brevity I'll highlight the two greatest (and most obvious) benefits. 1: Give peace of mind to the states (in this case the baltics) that their territorial integrity will be upheld by all of the members of the treaty organization, which considering the lacklustre response to the annexation of Crimea by some of those same members, it is a justifiable concern. For if they aren't prepared to push back harder against blatant Russian invasions for Crimea, or Ukraine, who's to say the same won't be said about Latvia, Estonia or Lithuania. However if they have troops stationed there, on a permanent basis Putin will know for certain that an attack on one is an attack on them all.  2. It serves as ""punishment"" (which it being seen as such is totally silly, all things considered) for Russian actions in the area, by proving that a sovereign country has the right to establish a base within their territory. Which is unbelievable that this even has to be mentioned.

true,waveswan,SWED,Sweden,"Because Putin literally has to keep on showing muscle to remain in power in order to distract his people away from how badly they are being screwed. It is unlikely he will be stupid enough to try to pull an invasion of a NATO country, but expect a load of provocations and sabre rattling.

Putin's problem is essentially that he is trying to run a civilian government as if it was an army. You can't do that. A military has an external source of funding and can kick out low-performing members. It relies on strict discipline enforced by threatening to dismiss anybody who does not fall in line.

If you try to do the same with civilian society you end up with Fascism, cannibalising your nations resources, while suppressing creativity and creating a highly resentful class of poor people. You can't just kick dissenting people out of society the way you can dismiss them from a military, unless your plan is to kill them in a Stalinist sort of way. Now even if you are a total socio-path and think it is ok to do so, the consequence will be that people are afraid to point out problems or discuss honestly if there is a better way to do things. It is a hopelessly inflexible system which only works until some external change or unforeseen issue triggers a sort of resonance cascade which causes the whole rotten framework to crumble under the weight of its own corruption.

The proper way to build a prosperous economy is more similar to a coral reef. You need a solid structure, but the it's purpose is mostly to support a diverse ecosystem filled with all manner of species. This is more or less why Western Europe and North America are prosperous. For all our problems we do have a fairly balanced political philosophy. China and India are moving in the right direction, but the former has a serious issue with corruption and dictatorial leadership, while the latter is struggling trying to lift hundreds of millions of people out of severe poverty while battling everything from religious extremists to illiteracy.

If the west had any sense we would do a lot more to support India as they are likely to become a very important trading partner. If we helped them with a powerful investment in advanced tech and healthcare, they would likely be able to take advantage of their absolutely massive workforce in order to reform their agriculture, manufacturing and infrastructure.

Of course, they would never trust us unless we offered them guarantees to keep our companies in line and not let them rape and pillage the local economy. ",0,1409433208,null,0,false,1,ck4wrtx,t3_2f0j3d,t1_ck4wrtx,t1_ck4u45v,null,1427278764,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

true,WilliamDhalgren,CROA,Croatia,"nope, you've got the institutions mixed up. Commission would be most similar to an executive. Council of the European Union (=Council of ministers, informally) has some executive functions, though its mostly the co-legislature with the parliament. European Council, a different body (and which has nothing to do with the Council of Europe, a completely different institution), is the strategic deliberative body. It is the council of the heads of governments of the EU. It is the collective presidency of the EU. It doesn't directly participate in day-to-day running of european affairs.

Apart from this role we're seeing now, in co-deciding top EU positions, Lisbon treaty states it is a body which ""shall provide the Union with the necessary impetus for its development"". It is also invoked to ""settle issues outstanding from discussions at a lower level"" and in treaty revision procedures. Oh also Article 7 procedure for suspending a country due to ""fundamental values"" breach, maybe in international treaty ratifications - not sure about the last one.
 

The body and the president of it are powerful, I agree - but mostly informally. Just like the High Representative - who also chairs, this time the foreign affairs ministers - but also at least has substantial formal powers, being simultaneously the comissioner and cluster leader for foreign-affairs related portfolios, agencies, directorate-generals etc.

He certainly doesn't execute the will of the Council, he just greases the wheels of negotiations and horse-trading between the heads of states, who have the actual say.

US &amp; allies rehash old talking points but show no hard evidence.
Ttalking points that have become irrelevant and are highly suspicious given that no evidence has been shown to back them up.
The only evidence so far presented by the US and Kiev has been demonstrably shown to be fake.

Why did MH17 make a sudden detour out of the air corridor, directly over the war zone, immediately before it was shot down?

Sure, that's not the issue. The issue is that it channels people towards a set of media that has different political outlooks, for example the Russian state television, and on average that will lead to political differences in opinion.

&gt;As for identification - you're still Belgian first and Flemish second, right?

Check my flair... I took that one on purpose since I don't want to associate with either side.

That would be besides the point. The problem is not getting with the Netherlands, the problem is getting out of Belgium with Brussels attached... and that goes for both Wallonia and Flanders. Personally I'd prefer a Benelux union, heh.

Anyway, anyone proposing to accomplish anything at all with force of arms would be regarded as complete madman on either side of the border.

The truth often hurts. 

Unsavory truths usually hurt even more and what is now happening and has recently happened in Ukraine is very unsavory indeed. It includes the cold blooded murder of several hundred people and the impoverishment of tens or even hundreds of millions in the pursuit of greater, if short term, US Corporate profits. 

It is also accelerating the bankruptcy of the US, the loss of the dollar as the global reserve currency and with that the end of American hegemony (by forcing China and Russia closer together faster in the face of blatant US aggression).

Ein Beispiel: Sicher gibt es von Moskau bezahlte Sockenpuppen, die auch mal einen Kommentar schreiben. Diese aber, wie in einer Verschwörungstheorie, alleine für die Pro-Putin-Stimmung verantwortlich zu machen, wie das in einigen Medien geschehen ist, halte ich für ausgemachten Blödsinn.

Wie sieht das eigentlich im Restlichen Europa aus? Gibt es in anderen Ländern auch viele Putin-Versteher?

Jedenfalls in Deutschland ist es nicht nur online so. Auch offline (mal ein paar Bekannte gefragt) verstehen viele nicht, warum Deutschland überhaupt an Sanktionen denkt und meinen, dass die Krim ja historisch zu Russland gehört. 

Warum? Ich denke da ist viel verschwurbelter Anti-Amerikanismus dabei. Putin ist gegen die Amis und bietet ihnen die Stirn (auch dank ICBMs). Deshalb für Putin. Mir hat mal ein Politikwissenschaftler erklärt, dass der deutsche Antiamerikanismus eine Folge des deutschen Antisemitismus ist. Als man nicht mehr gegen Juden war brauchte man ein neues Ziel. Viele Juden waren in die USA ausgewandert. Das bot sich an. Und politisch links sein war eh schick. 

Aber ist das die einzige Erklärung? Ich glaube nicht.

Es ist auch die Sehnsucht nach einem starken Mann: Putin. Jemand der ""ehrlich"" ist und aufräumt. Demokratie ist schrecklich kompliziert, anfällig und erfordert viel Arbeit. Und durch die Zähmung der Presse in Russland gibt es kaum negative Berichterstattung zu Putin. Ganz im Gegensatz zu den USA, die es nicht lassen können sich medial selbst zu geißeln. In unserer globalisierten Welt strahlt das aus.

Dann wäre da noch die Verehrung der Sowjetunion in der DDR, die manchen in Fleisch und Blut übergegangen ist. Russland ist ein sehr großes Land, dass Erstaunliches zu Wege gebracht hat.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Yeah, you're very correct and everything, apart from that countries, in British English, can sometimes be treated as plural nouns, which a third person plural conjugation (e.g. are, have, go) instead of a third person singular conjugation (e.g. is, has, goes). For instance, I don't think any dialect treats the word ""police"" as a singular noun. Nobody who speaks English properly says ""the police is..."" but instead will say ""the police are"". Other good examples of collective nouns are ""the BBC"" (or other organisations) and ""the government"". 

The important thing to note is that whenever we treat countries as collective nouns, we're not saying that there are lots of parts to the country, but simply that the country is consists of a lot of individual people who form a group, and it's this group which is acting, which means it's plural. For instance, I can also say ""France are going to war"" because I am referring to ""the people of who make France"" rather than, I don't know, the various départments of France. The distinction between using are/is with either the USA or United States of America, I think is just a style choice. The USA is, in every instance I have ever read it, been treated as a singular noun, but on multiple occasions I have witnessed the United States of America being treated as a plural noun in the same way France is sometimes treated as a plural noun. 

So yeah, your history is good and everything, but this doesn't have a lot to do with the ""state**s**"" part of the ""United States of America"" but more to do with the fact that the USA is a country, which consists of lots of different people, just like all other countries.

Ja. Das sehe ich auch ganz oft. Die USA bzw. nicht das Land aber die Falken und die Regierung Bush und letzlich auch Obama gelten als das böse auf der Welt. Hinzu kommen noch die geschichtlich Belegten CIA-Aktionen und aktuell der Wissenshunger der NSA. 

&gt; Mir hat mal ein Politikwissenschaftler erklärt, dass der deutsche Antiamerikanismus eine Folge des deutschen Antisemitismus ist. Als man nicht mehr gegen Juden war brauchte man ein neues Ziel. Viele Juden waren in die USA ausgewandert. Das bot sich an. Und politisch links sein war eh schick.

Kenne ich persönlich nicht. Erst in letzter Zeit haben ein paar Bekannte mit (aus dem Internet gelesenen) Verschwörungstheorien u.a. Rothschilds als schuldige benannt. Richtig primärer Antisemitismus kenn ich nur von Nazis... sekundärer Antisemitismus finde ich schwierig. Das ist eine fließende Grenze, die letzlich auch als Argument gegen global agierende Konzerne und Israels Politik genutzt werden kann. Das nimmt teilweise absurde Züge an. Vielleicht lese ich zu viel im Umfeld der Jungle-World. 

Ich persönlich (bin ende 20) wurde auf jeden Fall antiamerikanisch sozialisiert. In der ehemaligen DDR großgeworden - in einer Region die unter der Wende sehr gelitten hat. Kapitalismus und Kriege (der Irak-Krieg war definitiv für alle die ich kannte ein Wendepunkt gegen die USA) und auch 9/11 wurde von mir und anderen als zynisch übetrieben empfunden. Diese riesige Mediale Inszenierung über Wochen hat einfach nur allen klar gemacht, dass Nicht US Bürger einfach weniger wichtig sind... 

Wie gesagt, das sind nicht meine heutigen Überzeugungen aber so haben vor etwa 10 Jahren alle in meinen Umfeld gedacht. 

Ich denke der Mediale Beobachter bekommt den Eindruck, die Politik der USA und Isreal ist nicht kritisierbar ohne als Antiamerikanisch oder Antisemitisch bezeichnet zu werden.

Lithuania has always been calling for peaceful solution in Ukraine, but to achieve that peaceful solution Russia must first to get the fuck out their troops and tanks from sovereign nation, stop invasion and occupation of Ukraine. Russia has blatantly annexed Crimean territory in flagrant violation of international laws, norms, and is now trying to do the same with Donbas. They continue supplying mercenaries, heavy weapons, and regular troops to the region. The only solution that remains at the moment for the Ukrainian people who have the right to defend their territorial integrity against such an aggression is to cause enough damage to Russia to win this war. When Russian mothers will start receiving zinc coffins with their dead sons maybe population will finally wake up from the delusion and craze that they are in, and start questioning Putin's moronic imperial ambitions.

but yeah, the civil war and the legislation had everything to do with the usa being understood as a corporate form with a singular verb.  

here is a [graph that charts the rise of the singular form, virtually non-existant before the civil war.](http://io9.com/when-did-the-united-states-become-a-singular-noun-949771685)

here is one of america's foremost civil war historians explaining the switch:

""Before the war, it was said ""the United States are."" Grammatically, it was spoken that way and thought of as a collection of independent states. And after the war, it was always ""the United States is,"" as we say today without being self-conscious at all. And that sums up what the war accomplished. It made us an ""is.""  Shelby Foote

and yes, of course legislation affected the way american usage approached the verb applied to the united states.  government, journalistic and book publishers would all follow that usage, the schools would teach it that way, and until only recently with the rise of strong states' rights advocates like factions of the tea party, everyone switched to use it.

so yeah, languages do work like that.

and yeah i did just disprove you.  but following your lights, i'm sure you won't mind if the rest of the world starts addressing your head of state as mrs. windsor, because uh, you know, those who have long abandoned the notion of divine right can't be expected to adhere to proper names and titles: languages just don't work like that.

It's quite funny to this story being dragged up in /r/europe over the last couple of days.

&gt;Of the contracts granted, however, only 31 were worth more than £1m. Of these, just one – a £1.6m small arms deal – was for anything actually capable of killing anyone.

&gt;Despite Downing Street re­assurances that no licences were granted for equipment to support Russia’s military – the exports were all for civilian and commercial use – MPs have expressed concern.

...

&gt;On face value, few of the licences read like they matter much to the Kremlin’s military machine, with its $81bn annual budget. During the past 12 months, for example, the UK granted the ex­port of £480 worth of semiconductor chemicals, and £6,261 of swimming equipment.

&gt;Even when it comes to more sophisticated technology, the buyers have not been particularly belligerent organisations. Night-vision goggles were sold to students for a college pro­ject, said Number 10, while small shipments of guns went for sporting purposes.

&gt;If anything, the state of UK weapons exports to Russia shows how little Moscow relies on foreign pow­ers for its military prowess.
Since 2000, the Kremlin has signed only 10 arms contracts of any significance with other nations.

It's easier for non-EU foreigners to gain entrance into a Spanish degree program if they have already started the degree elsewhere. This process is called ""convalidación"" and involves having your previous studies made equivalent to Spanish classes one by one.

I got a five-year Spanish degree (licenciatura) at a public university (Complutense) and was always charged the same as Spanish students. My husband did a one-year Masters and also paid the same as the other Spanish students. This may have changed in the past year.

Ich weiß es nicht. Es gibt aber keinerlei Hinweise, das dies der Fall sein könnte. Wenn man sich in einem Artikel auf bewiesenermaßen nicht existente Dokumente die vermeintlich von Snowden stammen sollen bezieht dann ist das für mich unseriös und ich sehe nicht warum ich der These glauben schenken soll... 

Es geht nicht darum dem Iran in den Dreck zu ziehen, sondern PressTV - die IMHO einfach oft zumindest auf der Absurden Seite sind was ihre Meldungen angeht.

Das der Mossad deren Wissenschaftlicher umbringt ist in der Tat ein Skandal. Politik ist häßlich. Man kann auch bei den Fakten bleiben. Kein Grund sich hinter Verschwörungen und der CIA und dem Mossad als pauschale Sündenbücke für alles zu verstecken.

Du bist angepisst. Kann ich verstehen. Und ich will dir gar nicht widersprechen, dass auch unsere Medien uns belügen. Aber vielleicht möchte nur ein kleines Plädoyer halten cool zu bleiben und vielleicht etwas abstand zu nehmen... Dinge kritisch sehen und versuchen sie einzuordnen.

Ja. Verständlich. Ich geh auch lieber zur Freiheit statt Angst Demo anstatt allein vorm Rechner zu verweifeln. Ich denke auch, dass man in der  ummitelbare Lebensrealität mehr Einfluss hat. Think global, act local. Dort erreicht man Leute... und persönlicher Kontakt und konkretes Handeln haben ganz andere Auswirkung als sich hier oder woanders aufzuregen.
