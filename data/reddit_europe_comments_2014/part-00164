true,guebja,EURO,European Union,"And now, your own bias is shining through.

While StopFake undoubtedly leans pro-Kiev, they tend to be accurate, and they also debunk propaganda from the pro-Kiev camp.

A good example of that is the debunking of the MANPAD story even while Ukrainian and American officials were still pushing it, but they've done it on several other occasions as well. For example, they debunked lies about LifeNews not just [once](http://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-a-lifenews-journalist-directed-the-fire-of-separatists/) but [twice](http://www.stopfake.org/en/lie-lifenews-uploaded-their-story-about-shooting-in-slovyansk-on-youtube-before-it-actually-happened/).


&gt; Then they ""debunked"" that the Kiev-appointed governor of Kherson praised Hitler for trying to save Ukraine from communists and Stalin in his Victory Day celebration address. Well, guess what? He actually said all those things (which pissed the people off so much that he was booed and one women with a baby even came up from the audience and took his microphone away). The excuse was ""and later in the speech he said that we kicked Hitler out, yay us! So the governor is not entirely pro-Hitler!"".

Their debunking of the claims made about that speech was absolutely correct.

He did not ""praise Hitler for trying to save Ukraine from communists and Stalin"", he said that Hitler tried to justify his actions by ""putting forth *slogans* about the alleged release from communism and the tyrant Stalin"".

So what he said was that Hitler *claimed* to be a liberator but that the people saw through it and united against him, and right after that, he said that the same thing is happening today, with an aggressor standing on Ukraine's borders while using slogans of liberation.

It was a poorly-written and poorly-delivered speech, and comparing Putin to Hitler certainly wasn't appropriate at an event like that, but to any careful listener it should be obvious what his point was.

true,Munegascu,Lorraine,Lorraine,"Même après avoir gagné le mondial 1998, une victoire est loin d'être acquise 4 ans plus tard. Les gens s'extasient toujours sur 1998 car ils ont une passion pour le football. 

Je suis un peu *in* dans le milieu du football, j'ai été modérateur du forum d'un club de Ligue 1, je suis supporter fervent de ce même club de Ligue 1 et ai participé avec les clubs de supporters aux déplacements en championnat. Les victoires sont toujours symboliques, les Marseillais ne se sont toujours pas remis de leur victoire en C1 et la ramènent toujours sur la table. Et c'était en 1993! Donc je trouve pas ça étonnant que les gens parlent toujours de la victoire de 1998.

Honnêtement, je trouve que tu prends ça trop au pied de la lettre. Il y a ce je ne sais quoi d'irrationnel à supporter un club et il m'apparaît toujours difficile d'expliquer en quoi j'aime mon club. Je pense qu'on peut vivre le football avec passion sans être sectaire. Non je n'ai pas une parure de draps aux couleurs de mon club. Je ne suis qu'un simple supporter, qui paie 15€ pour être en virage pour être debout et chanter jusqu'à m'égosiller pour mon club.

La victoire en 1998 était une chose inimaginable et si belle pour le football français. J'étais jeune mais je comprends qu'ils aient fait vibrer des millions de gens à cette époque. Et je comprends que de nombreuses personnes en parlent toujours. Mais je ne crois pas qu'ils en parlent comme pour imposer leur vision. Le football est un sport populaire dans le monde entier, ça me paraît logique que l'on parle de quelque chose qui passionne des centaines de millions de personnes.

Je vais faire analogie avec mes goûts musicaux. Je suis un peu métalleux sur les bords. Ca m'emmerde qu'il n'y ait aucune radio FM d'envergure nationale qui diffuse des titres métal et ça m'énerve que de la musique moisie et des artistes surcotés comme Rihanna ou Shakira soient diffusés à longueur de journée sur les ondes mais au final, la musique qui passe à la radio est la musique que les gens aiment donc c'est normal que ce soit la plus diffusée. Personne n'a envie d'écouter le dernier album de Kalmah. Tout du moins, pas grand monde.

Donc oui le football est omniprésent, mais agressif et redondant? Je ne crois pas. Ca me paraît un peu capillotracté que tu te sentes agressé par du foot.

How unfortunate for you (again) that I didn't claim to be unbiased. I am firmly in an anti-Kiev regime camp. They are criminal and corrupt, and they are waging a war on their own people. 

Now, about that speech: 

&gt; he said that Hitler tried to justify his actions by ""putting forth slogans about the alleged release from communism and the tyrant Stalin"".

Exactly. Like ""release from communism and the tyrant Stalin"" was a *good* thing. He said it in the address on Victory Day (Red Army's victory over the Nazi Germany), to an essentially pro-communist (look at the red flags in the video), pro-Soviet Union crowd. It was a pure provocation on the part of the Kiev-appointed regime.   

Is that really *that* hard to understand? Or are you just pretending to not see the spin on this?  

This war in Ukraine is a civil war against the East. The speech (however poorly written) that puts forward a statement that Hitler claimed to be a liberator of Ukraine (but betrayed us, and only wanted our territory) IS offensive to those people. In the point of view of all those people with st.George's ribbons, Ukraine didn't need to be *liberated*. That's essentially the main point in all of this conflict. 

&gt;unlike StopFake, you haven't had the intellectual honesty to revise them when they turned out to be false

and you have no intellectual capacity to even see what Stopfake is going (waging propaganda war)? no, I think it's you who should be congratulated. 

And hey, while you are at it defending Stopfake, please explain away how they forgot to debunk outrageous claims by official Kiev that the people burned in Odessa were mostly from Moldova/Pridnestrov'e and Russia. I remember those few days of deliberately false reporting in the official Kiev media, and stopfake's silence on this (huge) issue was speaking louder than words.

The Islamic family is strictly patriarchal, the father decides the religion of the children and thus a Muslim man marrying a non-Muslim woman strengthens Islam, while a Muslim woman marrying a non-Muslim man would weaken it. Islam is intelligently designed for world domination in that way.

As you might guess this fact further strengthens anti-Muslim sentiment, among the native male population at least. They can get ""our"" women, but they would never allow us to get ""their"" women. Muslim women are not raised like Western women, even if they are raised in the West, and thus they usually only want proper Muslim men to begin with, but in one of the rare cases where a Muslim woman tried to marry a German she ended up being ""honor"" killed by her family.

Did I mention that I utterly despise Muslims? Yes, all of them because they deserve it. I am not a ""xenophobe"", I have no problems with Japanese or Koreans for example, who are way more ""xeno"" than Turks, but among them it is not normal to live off the welfare state, to be criminal, to be openly hostile towards the native population, disrespectful towards the native culture, and to aggressively display attitudes like that.

true,ohthehorrors,ASTR,Österreich,"Das Problem liegt in der Verkehrspolitik der CDU, die die Bahn nicht als öffentliche Dienstleistung, sondern als gewinnorientiertes Unternehmen sieht. Auch wenn Privatisierungsfantasien nicht mehr aktuell sind, wird der öffentliche Verkehr von den Konservativen in der EU-Kommision und diversen lokalen Regierungen als Investitment mit kurzfristiger Renditerwartung missverstanden. 

Die Bahn ist allerdings in einigen Punkten gegenüber Busbetreibern im Nachteil. Erstens wurden bei der Bahn im Zuge der gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen Barrierefreiheit Neuanschaffungen von Fahrzeugen notwendig, die entsprechende Kosten verursachen. Busse sind von Vorgaben wie ""niveaufreier Einstieg ohne fremde Unterstützung"" oder ""Toiletten mit mindestens einem Meter Breite"" ausgenommen, für die Betreiber fallen daher keine Kosten für Umrüstungen oder Neuanschaffungen an. Zweitens gibt es für Busse kein vorgeschriebenes Begleitpersonal analog zum Zugbegleiter - auch dadurch fallen keine zusätzlichen Kosten an. Drittens ist es für Busse leicht, Kosten zu externalisieren. Straßenabnutzung v.a. außerhalb von Autobahnen und Schadstoffausstoß werden nicht verrechnet. Viertens lasten auf der Bahn politische Forderungen zur Gewährleistung von Mobilität in dezentralen Regionen. Busbetreiber können ihre Kosten reduzieren, indem sie auf wenig rentable verzichten und nur zu Hauptlastzeiten verkehren. Die Bahn bietet im Vergleich dazu Taktverkehre, die auch Halte mit einem geringen Aufkommen an Beförderungsfällen anbinden. Diese verursacht Kosten durch zusätzliche Halte, längere Fahrzeiten und Personal vor Ort. Würde man die Bahn von diesen gemeinwirtschaftlichen Verpflichtungen entbinden, könnte sie nicht-rentable Halte und Bahnhöfe einsparen und so das Angebot auf den Hauptstrecken verbessern. Natürlich ist das absolut nicht anzustreben, allerdings schlagen sich diese verkehrspolitischen Forderungen auch im Tarif nieder. Die Bahn könnte Fernbusse auch außerhalb von Sparpreisen unterbieten, wenn sie ähnlich wie die Busbetreiber nur Halte mit hoher Fahrgastfrequenz zu den Hauptlastzeiten anfahren würde. Dies darf aber nicht der Schluss aus der Situation sein.

Man sollte allerdings berückstichtigen, dass die Bahn gegenüber Bussen qualitativ im Vorteil ist. In Bussen sind die Sitzabstände sowohl in der Länge, als auch in der Breite merklich geringer als in Zügen, was auch am breiteren Laderaumprofil der Bahn liegt. Gepäckmitnahmemöglichkeiten sind in Bussen begrenzt. Die Reisegeschwindigkeit von Zügen wird ab einem Niveau als akzeptabel angesehen, das über der Hochstgeschwindigkeit von Bussen liegt. Fernverkehrszüge sind in meistens mit Fahreschwindigkeiten von &gt;140 km/h unterwegs. Busse kommen selten über 80 km/h. Fernbusse profitieren allerdings davon, dass in den letzten 50 Jahren ein dichtmaschiges Autobahnnetz errichtet wurde, während das Bahnnetz abgesehen von einigen wenigen Hochgeschwindigkeitskorridoren eher reduziert wurde. Würde eine Investitionsgleichheit zwischen Bahn und Straßennetz herrschen, gäbe es ein wesentlich besseres Bahnnetz (Frankfurt/Hamburg/Berlin -Fulda - Passau- Wien ist eine Farce, dasselbe trifft auf die ab 2016 minimal ausgebaute Strecke München-Salzburg (-Wien - Bratislava/Budapest) zu.) 

Mit Bussen fährt, wer sich nichts anderes leisten kann. Dementsprechend ist das Angebot auch gestaltet (Sitzabstände, Gepäck, Abfahrtszeiten, Fahrzeiten). Man kann eine soziale Schichtung bei der Verkehrsmittelwahl beobachten. Das Prekariat fährt mit dem Bus, bis zum durchschnittlichen Einkommen ist die Bahn populär, Besserverdiener tendieren zum Auto, die Oberschicht leistet sich Flüge. Sieht man sich die Fahrzeiten und Intervalle auf verschiendenen Relationen an, so kommt man zum Schluss, dass Fernbusse weniger Fahrten als die Bahn anbieten und längere Fahrzeiten aufweisen. Ein Preisvorteil ist allerdings nur kurzfristig gegeben, bucht man einige Wochen voraus, kommt mit der Bahn auf dasselbe Preisniveau. Das Problem sehe Ich in der gegebenen Situation vor allem darin, dass die Bahn zumindest für kurzfristige Buchungen Gefahr läuft, keine Mobilität für Personen mit geringer Kaufkraft zu gewährleisten - die diversen Fernbusse sind mit ihrem Angebot keine Alternative.",0,1402351109,null,0,false,0,ci3c8nc,t3_27ollv,t1_ci3c8nc,t1_ci2zh5j,null,1434166198,7,false,de,t5_22i0,7

That is just a question of fundamental decency. That is how an immigrant can be expected to behave.

true,I_AM_A_IDIOT_AMA,SWIT,Confoederatio Helvetica,"Far, far more animosity between Flanders and Wallonia than between the language regions of Switzerland. The Röstigraben issue is far less pronounced than the Flemish/Walloon conflict.

Now, a disclaimer: because there's no way to describe this objectively, you may notice I have a pro-Flanders bias - due to my origins and family being Flemish.

In Flanders, there's constant frustration over excessive tax money being allocated to Wallonia (at a net loss to the Flemish region despite the fact Flanders is economically more developed and more populated); over a Royal family that hardly speaks any Dutch; wastefulness in government created by the bilingualism (there's a largely separate government for each region, and elections are made pretty complicated by this) and a handful of other problems, like discrimination in employment in the border areas.

One particularly touchy issue right now is that the current Parti Socialiste-led governing cabinet of Elio Di Rupo did not achieve a majority vote from the Flemish (Di Rupo wasn't even on the ballot for the Flemish), also excluding the Flemish plurality-achieving N-VA party. Basically, a lot of Flemings feel they are absolutely not represented by the current Belgian government.

Separation or greater autonomy of Flanders is the elephant in the room here - many politicians prefer the current status quo with a huge bloated bureaucracy of cushy government jobs for all who want it, so they would rather not face the big issue and rock the boat that is a united Belgium. Any talks of granting more autonomy to Flanders also run parallel to weakening the monarchy (whose fans are primarily Walloons), so the Royal house is also in favor of ignoring it all.

Deuxièmement, ta vision du capitalisme et de l'entrepreneuriat est puérile. Entrepreneur = businessman ? Il manque plus que la chaine en or, le gros cigare et le club satanique qui complote contre le prolétariat.

Troisièmement, je ne vois pas en quoi stimuler l'entrepreneuriat empêche de former à la citoyenneté.

It was a pure provocation on the part of the Kiev-appointed regime.

And exactly none of that amounts to ""praising Hitler"", which is the claim that they debunked and that you implied was actually true.

You won't see me denying that it was an idiotic and divisive speech for that event, but it was **not** praising Hitler, any more than saying that a swindler tells you stories about the great fortune he has for you right before he tries to rob you is praising the swindler.

It was an anti-Hitler, anti-Putin, and anti-Stalin speech. That's not even remotely the same as a partly pro-Hitler, anti-Putin, and anti-Stalin speech. And while the latter would imply fascist sympathies on the part of the speaker, the former does no such thing.

StopFake's debunking included a verbatim translation of the relevant parts of the speech, so it's not like they were trying to hide the fact that it was anti-Stalin and anti-communist.

&gt; and you have no intellectual capacity to even see what Stopfake is going (waging propaganda war)?

You think that debunking false propaganda claims amounts to waging a propaganda war if not enough attention is given to other false claims that you'd like to see debunked? Really?

Ask yourself this: what would happen if there were multiple highly visible organizations on both sides doing the same thing - debunking propaganda while trying to be accurate?

In case the answer isn't immediately obvious to you, that would greatly decrease the effectiveness of *actual* propaganda on both sides, and act as a disincentive against politicians blatantly lying.

1. That would require not just changing the *status* of the existing borders - they way it happened so far (for example Kosovo or Crimea) from provincial to international, but would require *redrawing* the actual lines of the borders, and that could have a chain reaction and potentially destabilize a lot of borders across the globe (some examples: Hungarians in southern Slovakia, Basque in France, etc... but most importantly the right next door Albanians in the eastern third of Macedonia). And ""the west"" isn't willing to risk it. It would also imply that Kosovo as a multiethnic state is a failure, again, something the west isn't willing to do.

2. Doing a swap would pretty much require Serbia to accept Kosovo as an independent state, again, something Serbia isn't quite ready to do yet if it's not necessary, yet at least.

3. If Northern Kosovo stays a part of Kosovo it at least partially retains a Serbian identity (Serbian is an official language of Kosovo), and if it leaves Kosovo, there would be barely any Serbs left in Kosovo, at least in the sense they'd be just like any other minority in Kosovo: Roma, Bosniaks, Gorani whatever. Not to mention it's definitely better this way for the Serbs in ""southern"" Kosovo, where the majority of the important historical monuments/heritage is actually located. Cut of NK and you pretty much lose Kosovo in its entirety.

4. A very important international highway goes through the Presevo region - [most important transport routes through Serbia](http://i.imgur.com/t6QH5nv.png). Serbia doesn't want it to go through Kosovo instead of just going directly to Macedonia.

Simply knowing more than one language has actually been shown to have a considerable cognitive impact. Makes sense - you'll understand that the word is not the thing, and that language shapes your thought (my personality comes across very different in English and Finnish, which amuses my friends quite a bit).

And of course, it does give you access to a fair bit more media. Though granted, often the media that whoever you're looking at wants you to see (RT != Russian news, after all, nor is Xinhua really what the Chinese population hears). Still, better than none at all, assuming you have the sense to filter what you hear.

&gt; If all you do is read shit on Reddit you are just as an liability to others as if you just would watch fox news.

Of course if you have access to a huge amount of data and focus on a tiny bit of it, you don't gain very much. But this is fairly self evident and hence I'm not sure why it's worth pointing out.

- You looked like a Middle Eastern Muslim, the most despised minority group in Germany (and many other Western European countries - they win hearts and minds everywhere)

Few people would shout ethnic slurs at a group of Albanian thugs loitering about in the streets you know, but the hate is still looking for a target. I have personally witnessed the injustice of the well-integrated immigrants of said groups indeed being a prime target for resentment because of this.

You want to go to Canada? Well, I hope you will like it there, but while you are so angry at us xenophobic Germans, remember that the ""xenophobe"" / ""right-wing populist"" party here in Germany (AfD) advocates using Canada as an example for good immigration policy. You know, the Canadian immigration system is based on the principle of only accepting immigrants where you can be reasonably sure that they will not become a burden to society. So Canada simply has less problematic immigrants and thus there is less resentment.

The scum in e.g. Berlin's Little Istanbul (Neu-Kölln), whose behavior largely built the resentment here in Germany, the Canadians would never let those people into their country to begin with. Also Canada is a natural immigrant nation, and that matters a lot too. 

I mean, it is unjust that you were blamed for what others have done (or do not do..), but that is how humans are .. everywhere. Being an Arab, or even just ""looking like an Arab"" to stupid Americans was no fun post-9/11 (remember the Sikh who got killed because of his turban?).

The Turkish nationalist chauvinism becomes even more obscene when they choose not to live in their glorious fatherland. These pictures were taken in Germany [1] [2]. And you wonder why so many Germans hate those people? By the way if you wonder about the funny hand gesture, it is the sign of the Turkish Neonazis [3] (a group highly popular among young Turks in Germany).

&gt;

&gt;__William Frederick ""Buffalo Bill"" Cody__ (February 26, 1846 – January 10, 1917) was an American soldier, [bison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_bison) hunter and [showman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showman). He was born in the [Iowa Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Territory) (now the U.S. state of [Iowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa)), in [Le Claire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Claire,_Iowa) but he grew up for several years in his father's hometown in [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada) before his family moved to the [Kansas Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Territory).

&gt;Buffalo Bill started working at the age of eleven after his father's death, and became a rider for the [Pony Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pony_Express) at age 14. During the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War), he served from 1863 to the end of the war in 1865. Later he served as a civilian scout to the [US Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Army) during the [Indian Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wars), receiving the [Medal of Honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor) in 1872. One of the most colorful figures of the [American Old West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Old_West), Buffalo Bill became famous for the [Wild West shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_West_show) he organized with [cowboy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy) themes, which he toured in Great Britain and Europe as well as the United States.

And my point was that the vast majority of Turks have a way different attitude about that.

&gt;Can you elaborate on that incident by the way?

I could not quickly find an article in English, for those who can speak German here is German public television reporting about the incident [1]. It was pretty big national news back then because it was so.. illustrative. Displaying aggressive ethnic nationalism while you yourself are an immigrant minority in another nation whose very existence depends on the lack of ethnic nationalism in said nation is - let us say - a pretty bold move. 

Back to the incident itself, it all started with one of these countless Turkish cultural festivities (in Germany). An ""Ottoman military band"" had registered a public performance and the victims of nasty German nationalism were cheerfully singing about dying for their beloved fatherland (Turkey). Unfortunately the event proved to be more popular than expected with the assembled Turks occupying way more than the designated area and eventually trying to march through Berlin (you need to register such things which the police ahead of time). That was one reason for clashes with the German police, the other one was that Berlin also houses a sizable Kurdish minority, many of them PKK sympathizers, and what do you think happens when a bunch of drummed up Turkish nationalists, many of them clad in MHP flags run into those? So then the German police also had to take care to keep those two groups separated (as far as that was possible).

The PKK sympathizers need to be prosecuted, period. That's worse than being an Al-Qaeda sympathizer. Also the MHP guys might be... Stuck in time if you will. Here the government is negotiating with the Kurds and they are in national TV every day, they are making their case heard and things are getting better. If the nationalists went to Germany in the 60s-90s(when Kurdish terrorism imploded) and transferred their opinions to their children it might be a little inappropriate.

Also there seems to be a generalization from Europeans(dat irony I know). That guy in the video seems like a total tool. I hate them and I hope we get rid of religion.

[Persecution of Ottoman Muslims.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Ottoman_Muslims#Total_casualties)

To start off, nobody is saying massacres did not occur. We are saying they both occurred and if Turkish deaths are not recognized we do not believe we have any obligation to do anything else.

The Christians of the time were HEAVILY biased against Muslims(true to this day). These were the same people that couldn't grasp how black people could have a civilizations of their own. Don't trust them. If what you claim are genocides, this was a genocide too.

Them citations though.

&gt;Conscription of Greek men was supplemented by massacres and by deportations involving death marches of the general population.[citation needed] Greek villages and towns would be surrounded by Ottomans and their inhabitants massacred.[citation needed]

This is all from the Greek side by the way, they CLAIM it was a deliberate attempt while the Turks claim they simply deported the Greeks and didn't give a shit what happened after. 100,000s of Turkish soldiers died of starvation and hunger, you can't expect a state to supply potentially hostile groups before their own soldiers.

&gt;Refet is claimed to have been active in the Greek genocide. According to the Austrian consul of ""Amisos""(Amasya?) on November 1916 a certain ""Rafet Bey"", its unknown if this is Refet Bele, supposedly stated “We must finish off the Greeks as we did with the Armenians… today I sent squads to the interior to kill every Greek on sight…”. However these claims are not corroborated in Turkish sources. Furthermore there were still more than a million Greeks living in areas under Ottoman control in today's Turkey's borders at the defeat of the Ottoman Empire. So more than a million Greeks fled or were exchanged to Greece in the Population exchange after the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922). Manus Midlarsky agrees that there was not a genocide against Greeks and argues that because of Western powers cultural and historical sensitivity to the Greeks:"" Under these conditions, genocide of the Ottoman Greeks simply was not a viable option"". However stating that massacres did took place against Greeks.

Ce n'est pas étonnant que Bruel ait menacé de ne pas chanter en France, il l'avait déjà fait. Par contre, aucun rapport entre l'utilisation du mot ""fournée"" et le fait qu'il soit juif.

Sinon, pour ceux qui ont du mal avec la langue française, une définition de ""fournée"" :

*fournée : (Quelquefois) (Figuré) (Familier) Un certain nombre de personnes qui sont nommées à la fois aux mêmes fonctions ou dignités.*

*Il ne sera pas de cette fournée pour la Légion d'honneur.*

*On annonce une nouvelle fournée pour le mois prochain.*

I'm a racist, so I don't really care


&gt;Because the Eurabia argument is based on immigrants, not on race.


If that's the case, then I don't like the Eurabian argument.  My argument against immigration really has nothing to do with religion at all.

Even if all the immigrants assimilate (which they won't), it won't change the fact that white people will be a minority by 2066 if current trends continue.

It seems to me this media outlet is made up of people who are butthurt about not being an imperialist power anymore. One of the greatest strengths about the EU is that it is a bully-free zone. No longer can big countries mess about the smaller and do whatever they want (the conflict of interest therein thereby causing war, but anyway...). The UK isn't under- or overrepresented, but just right in terms of representation. I guess some people will only be satisfied with absolute power though.

More real democracy in the EU I think most people besides the bureaucrats can agree would be a good thing.

In the past 30 years, from 1978 to 2012 more precisely, French public spending has in fact decreased by two GDP points. What, then, explains the rise in public debt? First, a fall in the tax revenues of the state.

When public spending falls by two GDP points in a time of growth (globally, from 1978 to 2012, not counting individual economic busts), public spending still increases in absolute terms.

The fact that tax revenues have fallen is clearly true, but I don't think it invalidates the ""spending argument"": Successive governments have reduced taxes, sometimes rightly so, sometimes not, but none have taken the politically-risky measure of reducing spending along with it. If you reduce your revenue and don't constrain your spending at the same time, you're gonna end up in debt.

The sentence I quoted above is so ideologically charged it's not even funny. It's like the author considers a high-tax, high-spend state the natural situation and won't even see how you could interpret the change differently.

&gt; Lightning streaks inside a cloud, between clouds, and from clouds to the ground. Lightning is a flow of electrons (a negative charge) that zigzags downward in a forked shaped pattern (scientists call this a step leader). As it nears the earth, a stream of positive charges moves up to the charge of electrons (negative charge). When they meet, the power flows. We can't see this because it moves too fast (first stroke). The return flow (positive charge) moves upward more slowly. This is what we see and call lightning (return stroke). If there is a flicker, the upward stroke is repeating the process.

Germany's muslim population are mainly Turkish which practices a lot more secular version of Islam politically (note the protests against theocratisation now). There are also differences in how the turkish community integrated in the first generation. Granted I live in Berlin so I cant vouch for the rest of germany, but it is noticeably different to the UK in terms of integration and how much routine contact I have with the Turkish community just in terms of shopping being in the park etc. 

The British muslim population are much more diverse but the main problem is that for many complex reasons the new generation in many of the deprived areas of the UK have been radicalised more than their parents have, the pakistani community as well has strong links to conservative areas in Pakistan and radical ideology as well as the Somalian community. Noticeably for me, in day to day life when I was in UK, you just dont see them unless you go out of your way to go into ""their"" areas.

What I take issue with is federalists cooing after the idea of a federal super-state like a groom to his bride. There's no realistic expectations at all.

Let's say the USE happens. Let's say you've standardised the small stuff. The stuff that's easy to standardise. Let's say you move onto bigger things which can be pushed through on ideological grounds. ""It's fair that education should have a common standard, and Greek kids and French kids and Romanian kids all get the same standard and system of education, examined to the same standard,"" people will argue. Ok, who's standard? If you want to go to Paris and convince them to give up the BAC in favour of another system, to that I can only say Your funeral, mate. ""The British can give way, then,"" continentals will say, with the typical diatribe of anti-British vitriol. Problem there is, while logistically it might seem 'easier' to adopt a European BAC, you will simply never convince the British to adopt a system of education which pigeon holes kids into a single track at such an early age. Our system is remarkably diversified. Want to do science? Boom, done. Want to do Arts? Boom, done. Want to do a mix of the two? Want to do English, Maths, French, Music and Physics? In the UK that's easy. No-one stops you. You might have a tricky exam timetable, but it's possible. In France people would look at you like your head had fallen off and you should just pick which track you want (as my girlfriend did to me when I explained the openness of the British system to her, and why I was taking Biology with French at university).

And if you're not going to standardise things like education and just float around the fluffy stuff like smoking in buildings and car safety, then why in god's name are you trying for a 'federal system'? What's the point of a federal, centralised system of government if it's not going to standardise things from the seat of power? That's the whole *point* of a strong centralised government.

Suppose education is left alone. What are you going to do about healthcare? Should we have universal healthcare paid for across Europe? Should the British be forced to give up the NHS and adopt a mixed system like other European countries? Or is a toothless federal government going to symbolically pass bullshit laws about which beds you can buy?

What about driving? That's a bit more obvious and would probably happen sooner seeing as though Europe is stitched together with it's roads. What should the federal speed limit be? Should other countries adopt a culture of limitless speed like Germany and inevitably see deaths spike as they adapt (because driving is very much a culture, not simply an activity), or should Germany have their parade pissed on?

The idea of the Super State is so riddled with potholes it's just daft. Have a conversation about how a federal government would actually govern and I'll listen, but holding up pipe dreams and saying ""NO, ***YOU*** GET OUT,"" doesn't endear me to you at all, and if anything makes it easier to cast a ballot to leave you to screw over the poorer countries and keep snapping up former USSR satellite states until you find yourselves in full-blown war with Russia.

It's all well and good going to China or LatAm or Africa or even America and looking at Europe from the outside and thinking, 'We're so similar, we should just be a country,' but from the inside out ways of life are all massively different. A central federal European government adds no value whatsoever in how the society in which I lead my life is governed if all it's going to do is dick around 'respecting the differences' of its members.",0,1402391833,null,0,false,0,ci3qwbq,t3_27qc98,t1_ci3qwbq,t1_ci3qmyy,null,1434173237,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

Cependant, avec la Révolution française, puis le consulat et l'avènement de Napoléon en tant qu'Empereur, cette prétention à la Couronne de France a disparu de facto puisque la couronne de France elle-même avait disparu.

There is nothing wrong with wanting your freedom. Other countries have made the same choice, but the countries that are in the EZ are pretty much commited to tighter economic integration (other wise the EZ can't function).

J'ai deux questions à te poser : 

1) Est-ce que tu penses vraiment qu'il faudrait refaire tous les anciens bâtiments de faible importance type mairies (après tout tu pouvais te marier ailleurs) de village anciennes pour qu'elles soient ""aux normes"" ? 

2) Avec quel argent et dans quel but ? Je suis d'accord avec toi pour dire que les personnes handicapées ne sont pas considérées comme des citoyens comme les autres : elles sont hyper-favorisées par la collectivité. Dans une *certaine mesure* c'est bien parce qu'elles ont des besoins spécifiques, mais dans l'absolu, quelle proportion de la population représentent-ils ?

Je pense que si tu organisais un vote dans cette commune, tout le monde serait d'accord pour dire qu'il faut appliquer les nouvelles normes dans les nouveaux bâtiments et aider les personnes handicapées, mais que la plupart refuseraient d'éclater un ancien bâtiment pour y mettre une rampe, tout ça aux frais des contribuables.

Est-ce que c'est si dur de comprendre que ces bâtiments ont été construits 1) à destination du plus grand nombre, qui n'est pas handicapé 2) avant que l'on commence à s'inquiéter des personnes handicapées (physiques mais aussi visuelles, auditives) 3) que leur réfection coûterait une fortune pour un bénéfice nul pour encore une fois le plus grand nombre ?

Je joue peut-être l'avocat du diable mais ça me paraît quand même hallucinant de se plaindre qu'une petite mairie de village n'ait pas éclaté des cloisons pour ajouter un ascenseur pour que madame puisse se marier à l'étage, son fils étant handicapé.

---

&gt;A __submarine sandwich__, also known as a __sub__, __wedge__, __hoagie__, __hero__, __grinder__, __baguette__, or one of many regional naming variations, is a [sandwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich) that consists of a long [roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_roll) of [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_bread) or [French bread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_bread), split widthwise either into two pieces or opened in a ""V"" on one side, and filled with a variety of meats, cheeses, vegetables, seasonings, and sauces.  The sandwich has no standardized name, and many U.S. regions have their own names for it;  one study found 13 different names for the sandwich in the United States.  The usage of the several terms varies regionally but not in any pattern, as they have been used variously by the people and enterprises who make and sell them. The terms [submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine) and sub are widespread and not assignable to any certain region, though many of the localized terms are clustered in the northeast United States, where most [Italian Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_American) live.

I'm not sure that the current system is that. Remember that your elected MEP votes in a secret ballot to decide their preferred candidate.

How can you hold your elected representative to account when you don't know if they did what they said they would do?

Anyway it’s like one of those typical French economic proposals you hear come out of France these last many years; proposals which are more grounded in ideology than reality. It’s not good enough to say we don’t know who own the debt. A first approximation can be done. State bonds are a long term, low yield, high security investment. A little may be owned by dodgy tax dodgers – but they’re on the whole far more likely to put their money elsewhere. 

The by far largest owner of French debt are French banks. Cancelling the debt will make them instantaneously severely underfunded with leverage of loans to asses far in excess of what is viable, so they’ll be forced to cancel their own loans to private citizens and smaller companies to reduce their leverage, leaving a wake of bankruptcies all through the nation. That’s going to hit the average dude who has taken a student loan, or a loan for his condo, car, farm or whatever. It’s trickle down bankruptcy. And no more money for investments for smaller companies or private individuals.

Another very big lump is owned by pension funds. That’s going to leave tens of millions of elderly citizens suddenly without means for support.

Another large part is owned by a few foreign governments with cash that needs to be stashed. You can fuck over Qatar and Saudi Arabia for all I care but what about Norway for instance. Norway is not going to invaded France to get back its money, but it’s hard to say it’s fair to fuck over Norway just because they were dumb enough to trust France with their money.

Another part is owned by other, mainly European countries. So if France cancels debt it owes to Germany, Germany is going to retaliate by cancelling what debt it owes France, etc. That might sound like a good idea anyway, but not going to leave anyone better off.",0,1402399603,null,0,false,0,ci3s8uk,t3_27phvm,t1_ci3s8uk,t1_ci3rv1g,null,1434173875,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; shit going down meant military confrontation somewhere in the future between russia and NATO, not just act of finnland+sweeden joining nato.

What you should consider in your scenario is the difference of consequences to Finland in case of a cold war conflict between NATO and Russia in Europe.

During the cold war Finland was neutral and militarily non-aligned. If there had been a military conflict between NATO and Soviets in Europe you should ask how it would have played out for Finland, and take a look at a map. 

Most military strategists agreed that in such situation the Soviets would not respect Finland's neutrality but invade (and that's the reason the US had about 20 nuclear targets in Finland, a fact the US confirmed after the cold war when they removed the targets). The obvious counteraction for the Soviet invasion would have been a pre-emptive NATO invasion first, especially in northern Finland (and that's the reason also the Soviets likely had nuclear targets in Finland, though they've never confirmed it probably meaning they still have). That's a sort of race situation: attempted invasion as soon and as quickly as possible to prevent others doing so.

In a cold war conflict being neutral would not have played out well for Finland as it was very unlikely that Finland could have avoided invasion merely by the virtue of being neutral. Neutrality would not have protected Finland but rather make invasion easier.

How does that apply to modern day? As a member of the EU Finland is not neutral any more but militarily non-aligned. In case of a military conflict between NATO and Russia, and it is naive to believe that being militarily non-aligned would protect Finland because the geography has remained the same. There would be high likelihood of a pre-emptive invasion by Russia, and once again Finland would be alone defending itself (unless a very very fast NATO invasion happens first).

Finland's NATO membership would change that. In case of a military conflict between NATO and Russia in Europe Finland would not be an easy target for a quick Russian invasion any more. And there would not be race over Finland as NATO would already be here. The likelihood of Russian invasion would still be very high but with NATO Finland would be in a better position to defend itself against the invasion.

That was the Soviet doctrine and has become the contemporary Russian doctrine: Finland must be neutral or militarily non-aligned to make it easier to invade if such situation arises.

Before WWII Finland was neutral. Nordic countries, especially Finland and Sweden were seeking to establish a Nordic *defence* alliance. This was vehemently opposed by the Soviet Union. And look what happened in 1939. Under a secret pact with Hitler the Soviet Union invaded Finland. It was the resistance the Soviets met and the growing likelihood of France and Britain sending troops to Finland that stopped the Soviets. Were there western troops in Finland the Soviet plans would be ruined. 

And again in 1940 Sweden and Finland were to sign a *defence* alliance pact. And again the Soviets vehemently opposed calling it a *casus belli*. So the Swedes had to back out of it right before signing it - cannot blame them. And again Finland was neutral and alone at the mercy of the Soviets. Their invasion was imminent, and they attacked again in 1941 (albeit this time it could be argued they had a casus belli, but that would not have happened had there been the defence alliance with Sweden).

&gt; After WW2, during the whole cold war and USSR spreading all over and invading countries, soviet union didnt go the finland way one bit thanks to finlands neutrality.

Finlandization. Soviet Union had a military base within gun range of Finland's capital (until 1956), and its hands elbow deep in Finland. I mean, they were repeatedly giving Finland 'friendly offers' of 'military consultation' until the 1980s. It took a lot of diplomatic navigation, and sometimes concessions, to fend those 'friendly offers' off.",0,1402400403,null,0,1402401339,0,ci3seyq,t3_27n7f6,t1_ci3seyq,t1_ci2ui8o,null,1434173953,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

I would recommend something like this:

Monday at noon go there and write down all the numbers (also do water and possibly gas) you'll either have 1 single number or 3.
if its 3 numbers just write them down all
these numbers are:

HZ (Hauptzeit) (daytime during the week, should be the highest number)
NZ (Nebenzeit) (nighttime during the week)
WE (Weekend)

unless you have some rare contract that has different payments for various times it doesn't matter just add the difference of all 3 into 1 sum.

then do the same the next week monday at noon.

2nd Monday values - 1st monday values = weekly usage

weekly usage * 52 = yearly usage
yearly usage / 12 (or weekly *4.33) = monthly

keep in mind that your energy &amp; gas bill will be a lot lower especially right now compared to the winter.

64 €/month seems pretty low actually, so do check regularly so you aren't in for a surprise when the yearly bill comes and you have to pay 500ish € on top.

don't have to worry about getting money back though. this is usually done yearly (unless your contract says otherwise). and its heavily regulated. you get your money back.

Hard influence over foreign politicies and censorship on criticism of soviet union. Was that suppose to be something terrible and new for finland? Or was it before a big dog slapping sweeden and russia down on any issues as it pleased...

For the rest, you assume that NATO membership, with its 2% budget for military of a 5mil pop country that just lost a large trading partner and a few thousand extra nato soldiers could possibly deter contemporary russian army.

I know that winter war gives you some kind of optimism or somethign, that if finland achieve that on its own, it could actually do something more with more allies...  but I dont think its really connected with the reality of the current time.

More soldiers, more fighting, more dead...  its as simple as that

And theres also possibility that russia would not invade if finland would stay neutral. As long as theres a large buffer states as sweeden and finland are, that give them time to react if large movement towards these states would occur...  why bother? Russia forces could move freally around the black sea instead of worrying about occupation of a large territory.

true,nolok,FRAN,France,"&gt; So yes, I agree with those people who rightfully condemn invoking WWII to justify or ""contextualize"" current Russian actions in Ukraine as utterly disingenuous.

You're making assumptions about things I haven't said nor thought. I didn't say nor think their ww2 actions is something worth invoking to defend current Russian actions in eastern europe.

Go re-read the Ukrainian threads that I'm talking about and you will see people answer Russian idiotic ""we protect you from the western nazi"" propaganda by saying ""the west defeated the Nazis, not the russian"". And if you try to tell them that in addition to being a retardely low level of argumentation, it's also factually wrong; you get faced with aggressivity.

Just because your opponent is being a lying moron doesn't mean it's ok to fall on that level too (proof being political debates, I guess :P)

the US republicans are somwhere between the UK conservatives and Hong kong  plutocracy. The democrats are canadian liberals, a little to the left of Uk conservatives.

In our recent elections we voted into parliament anything from statist to anti EU, with a alot of federalist in between. Econmically they vary from anarchist to fringe liberterians. 

Your attempt to box political tought in between random american standards is solipsistic to a delusional scale. You have no political choice, you have two gangs that share power, always, they can only inact policies with the permision of one another, some say this is a good thing, but I argue this is the continuasion of the values it was founded upon, america is equaly the country of the people and of the economic interests of the powerfull few. 

I want you to understand something, economics is not a science, it is a sum of ideas and proceses that are waiting to be disproven by reality. Politics powers academic theories not the other way around, why because there are no clear right or wrong decisions, there are just positive and negative effect that range from system breaking to irrelevant but significant enough that you can use in your next politcal campaign. Yes some ideas have a proven outcome, but any form of causality is mere speculation if you get into the details, economic effect tend to be product of whole contextures rather than a specific decision(despite what some economic autorsh try to argue to fuel a specific rethoric)

Now regarding those republicans, they only care about fiscal responsability when compared to the democratis social spending, when it comes to corporate freebies and military over kill they always want blank checks and no questions.(the both do actually just the democrats aren't hypocrites about it because of thier statist position). 

Another thing, do you think republicans have their views because they actually believe them or that they took a grip into a secment of the population(former disillusioned morally conservative democrats that voted for reagan) and converted it's beliefs to be as similar as possible with that niche of old school ""liberals"". Give them 10-15 years and they will renounce them(because there aren't enough of them to be relevant politically) and go libertarian and wave gay flags. As a reaction the democrats will go after moral conservatives as gen X becomes the grumpy old guys. That is the illusion of choice, you take any arena, spit it in half, take the argument your guys like the most and make it rethoric.

The irregularity of them varies, but the most common is changing the -t to -en. There are other variations, but you'll learn them on the way. To do with the helping verb (haben, in your example); it can either be haben or sein. The general rule of thumb is that you use sein when you move from one place to another; when you change locations. You use haben for when you don't move. Tanzen, to dance, would use haben, even though you technically move while dancing. The only time you would use sein for getanzt (past tense of tanzen) is if you happen to dance from your house to, lets say, on the street. If you change location, use sein. There are exceptions, but there are always exceptions. Also, this is the spoken past tense. The one you'll hear more often than not. There is also a written past tense that's much more like the English past tense, but sounds, to German speakers, very proper and prissy. Basically, you take add a ""t"", or sometimes ""te"" if unpronounceable, to the end of the stem of the verb and then ad the ending.

&gt; you are as a free nation free to cancel all debt (it's not like Norway will come after you with their mighty army).

&gt;A first approximation can be done.

actually it can't be, debts are sold on capital markets, they are packaged into sorted acording to interest, yield and viability in the long term and used as currency for other transactions or colateraal for insurance, riskier deals and long term risk. If they where to disapear, shit would rain on all of us. Because, uganda's debt is like toilet paper in value, it's wrapped around in special pacheging and used to ""pay parking"" but nobody actually colects. Us housing debt was used to ""pay for taxi"" or ""a meal at a restaurant"" and when it disapeared things got bad. A former triple a country's debt, that is what houses are bough with, you know why nobody believed or cared that the us would default, because everyone that knew finace(not tv pundits) knew that if a solution was not invented(literally) there would be no finance the next day, literally.

Those french banks owe a lot more money to a lot of other banks, and so the web of borowing takes down the system. But it's not about direct ownership, the issue is that a small part of that theoretically secure debt is recycled in the system as ""certain"" and if that disapears over night, the whole foundation trust between huge and stable finacial companies disapears, because you can't be sure that somewhere among your many debts owned you don't have that check that will bounce some day.

The state has no choice but to support the pension funds, it's the political curse of our current system. It is unavoidable.

&gt;That might sound like a good idea anyway, but not going to leave anyone better off.

actually the clear winners will be owners of new debt, old debt is very easy to finance and roll foward in time.

And there will always be that way. It isn't all about hard work, it's also being there are the right time and providing a good product.

&gt; Building a business from scratch into one of $10 million revenue is exceptional. Feel free to document otherwise.

It is, but there is a lot of those businesses so it is far from impossible. But once you have a good and established position in the market you can expand much more easily. 

&gt; So you agree that his earnings depend on his position, rather than some virtue on his part? I don't see how you can shift the responsibility to people, saying ""you could have such a job, if only you were talented enough/worked hard enough/were savvy enough to lick the right arse"". That's not true, there is a limited amount of job openings for CEO's - it's a zero-sum game, so the usual counterargument against inequality isn't even possible here.

But you haven't considered that it takes a lot of work to actually aquire that position? Most people in high paying positions have a high education or is very good in their field. You can't expect someone with mediocre grades with an art degree to aquire a CEO position after a few years.

But does everyone need to be really rich? People have it very good in most western countries. The standard of living for the poorest should be the correct measurement. And despite what reddit wants to believe, it is very high in the U.S. That doesn't mean that there isn't any issues with poverty and the like, but things really isn't as bad as people think.

Which is to a large extent a matter of *luck*. So why the rush to throw money towards people who simply have been lucky?

&gt;It is, but there is a lot of those businesses so it is far from impossible. But once you have a good and established position in the market you can expand much more easily.

Yeah, the first million is hard, after that it becomes easier. That's the whole problem: things are too easy for people who are already successful. We should make it easer for people who take *new* initiatives, not for the people who already own a lot.

&gt;But you haven't considered that it takes a lot of work to actually aquire that position?

That's not really relevant for one argument: the number of CEO's needed and the chances to get there remain limited. If there are a lot of candidates that makes it more of a lottery if they really were judged on qualities. But what really happens is that attending the right cocktail parties becomes crucial: most CEO's are recruited from wealthy families.

&gt;Most people in high paying positions have a high education or is very good in their field. You can't expect someone with mediocre grades with an art degree to aquire a CEO position after a few years.

There are plenty of people with mediocre degrees in CEO positions. It's all about ""relevant experience"", i.e. something that can be defined as desired so they can decide behind the screens who gets what.

&gt;But does everyone need to be really rich?

Does *anyone* need to?

&gt;People have it very good in most western countries. The standard of living for the poorest should be the correct measurement.

And that's why the relative differences should be smaller.

&gt;And despite what reddit wants to believe, it is very high in the U.S. That doesn't mean that there isn't any issues with poverty and the like, but things really isn't as bad as people think.

Trotzdem hänge ich auch eher der Sprachregelung an, wie sie auch im Artikel beschrieben wird: Religion hat für mich nicht in erster Linie etwas mit Übernatürlichem oder mit Göttern zu tun, sondern mit ""übersteigenden Werten"", die m.E. jeder erlebt. Gibt es zum Beispiel etwas, wofür Du sterben würdest? Es wirkt verrückt, wenn jemand sein Leben für irgend etwas aufgeben würde, aber wenn jemand sein Leben für sein Kind opfern würde, dann würde das eher Verständniss hervorrufen und nicht als geisteskrank eingestuft werden. Wenn es sich hingegen um ein Land, eine Idee oder irgendwelche Götter handelt, für die man zu sterben bereit wäre, dann sind die Meinungen schon differenzierter. Dass es aber solche ""übersteigende Werte"" gibt, steht für mich genauso ausser Frage wie der Umstand, dass eine Gesellschaft dadurch geprägt wird, wie mit genau diesen Werten umgegangen wird.

Von den bestehenden Religionen und Kirchen halte ich nicht so viel, aber ich habe den Eindruck, dass man mit der Ablehnung dieser Institutionen und Weltanschauungen das Kind mit dem Bade ausschüttet, wenn man so weit geht, dass man jeglichen Begriff von Religion ablehnt. Es besteht ja auch das Risiko, das Menschenbild des homo oeconomicus oder des rationalen Agenten verinnerlicht zu haben, und ja, in solchen Fällen würde ich schon von unbewussten Ersatzreligionen sprechen. 

Ich denke, das gesellschaftspolitische Problem besteht insgesamt darin, dass wir auf der einen Seite einen massiven Fortschrittsdruck haben, der es mit sich bringt, dass immer mehr Lebensbereiche unter einen Ökonomisierungs- und Optimierungsdruck geraten, und auf der anderen Seite eher überkommene Traditionssysteme besitzen, die keine Antworten mehr auf die entstehenden Probleme liefern, sondern zurück in die Vergangenheit wollen. Man sucht nach einem ""dritten Weg"", man sucht nach etwas, das die Gesellschaft noch zusammenhalten kann, denn die Wirtschaft alleine scheint es nicht zu können. Deshalb gibt es viele Atheisten, die sich affirmativ mit Religion beschäftigen; nicht, weil sie nach einem Gott suchen, sondern danach, wie Mensch und Gesellschaft funktionieren.

true,Jonisaurus,EURO,European Union,"&gt;How did you feel when France democratically rejected the Lisbon treaty but it happened anyway?

1. France never rejected the Lisbon Treaty but the EU Constitution, and, while very similar, ratifying a new treaty through parliamentary approval is completely and utterly normal as well as in accordance with democratic principles.

2. Regarding the EU Constitution referendum in France, I see a lot of British people referring to this referendum to make an argument that it was a clear French signal against more EU integration. 
**It wasn't.**

- A large chunk of the PS (Parti socialiste) opposed the EU Constitution in 2005, not because they were against further European integration, but because they thought it was lacking.
- Laurent Fabius famously switched to the left wing of the PS which opposed the EU Constitution on the grounds that it was too liberal and therefore a threat to the social welfare model of Europe.
- A large chunk of  EU-supporters argued the treaty wasn't good enough and if it was voted down would just be renegotiated. They called this ""Plan B"".
- Another factor was that the French people have a history of punishing the President and the government at Communal and European elections. This also happened in regards to this referendum.


TL;DR: I don't want to imply the referendum had no significance in France, but it was by no means a clear sign against further EU integration. Both the **Parti socialiste and the pro-EU side in the country at large were split** into support and opposition for the EU Constitution Treaty and the **French people also wanted to punish Chirac's government**.",0,1402410053,null,0,1402413026,0,ci3vfcu,t3_27qc98,t1_ci3vfcu,t1_ci3qdwj,null,1434175379,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

What politicians say to their domestic audience when it comes to these top jobs can be completely disregarded. They lie through their teeth in order not to be caught in a bad situation if they don't get the job.

Our current PM, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, is also very actively denying that she would consider one of the EU top posts, even though she is in play. I have no doubts that she will accept it if she is offered.

The problem with the Commission post, though, is that the European Parliament also has to approve whomever the heads of government choose. And if they don't choose Juncker, then the European Parliament might just vote no to the candidate chosen by the heads of government. That's a scary perspective for both Grybauskaitè and our PM.

I lived in Pigalle, so some of cools things to do in the hottest spot of Paris.

1/ BAR : 
Dirty dick : an old ""prostitute bar"" became one of the famous cocktail bar of Europe. &gt; rue frochot
You get also the glass for the same concept.

For more typicall bar in the same area you have the Mansart and the ""Sans Souci"". It's the places for youngs and parisians in the areas. 
You can also go to ""L'embuscade"" a french bar dedicated to the ""Cap Vert"" culture. Musique, dance and a lot of rhum.

2/ CLUB : 
Rex Club : one of the famous techno club in the city. It's better to get ticket before.
Chez Moune : it was a very old lesbians club. Now it's just electro. Good point : most of the time the entry is free.

If you go out of Pigalle, the new area for clubbing is near the gare de Lyon.
You have the Nuba and Wanderlust : the biggest rooftop of Paris. You have also the ""Concrete"", party the sunday in a big boat. Very cool if the weather is great. 

3/ EAT FRENCH !
Hotel Amour (in Pigalle) : a very very very nice spot. Better for take a drink or a brunch in the so cool inside terrasse.
Les affranchis (Pigalle) : a little bistrot with good food.

and you have to go in the weekend in ""La Rue des Martyrs"" a long street in Pigalle with a lots of typicall food fresh. One of the best croissant of Paris are in this street. You have also a lot of french cheese, meat... Better to go on sunday the street is closed to cars.

4/ THE PLACE WHO U CAN SEE PARISIANS AND NOT TOURISTS

""Les batignolles"", is a little quarter near Pigalle. Here you will find little streets, littles shop and cool wine bar. And the atmospher is cool, because it's where local people go out.
You have to try ""le petit village"" 58 rue de la condamine. It's one of my friend who have the bar (a big blond with a barbe : Matthieu ;)).

BONUS : if you have time, visit the suburb !

Mesdames et messieurs, [La Forêt des Mythagos](http://cp12.nevsepic.com.ua/6-3/1355495381-0924819-www.nevsepic.com.ua.jpg), de John Howe.

*Dans un petit coin reculé de l'Angleterre, on trouve la forêt de Ryhope. Une forêt ancienne, primaire, qui a toujours été là de mémoire humaine. Stephen Huxley, le protagoniste, vit avec son père George et son frère Christian en bordure de la forêt. Au cours de leurs jeux d'enfants, Stephen et Christian ont souvent été pris d'hallucinations visuelles bénignes ou ont cru voir des personnages qui les épiaient. Leur père les a toujours rassuré, leur expliquant qu'il s'agissait de gitans campant dans la forêt, et qu'il ne fallait pas s'inquiéter mais éviter de s'approcher.*

*En 1946, Stephen, démobilisé après la fin de la guerre, rentre à la maison familiale, occupée seulement par Christian après la mort de leur père. Les ""gitans"" se sont multipliés, et sont de plus en plus hardis, s'aventurant hors du bois pour de courtes périodes. George, qui semblait en savoir plus qu'il ne le disait, étudiait avec passion ces personnages. Christian lui-aussi semble en savoir plus que Stephen.*

*Un jour, Christian acculé, révèle à Stephen la vérité: La forêt est une manifestation physique de toutes les légendes de tous les peuples qui ont occupé la région depuis la fin de l'âge de pierre. Dans le bois, plus vaste à l'intérieur qu'il ne l'est à l'extérieur, on trouve la forêt de Brocéliande, le Valhalla des Vikings, le château de Cu Chulaìnn et le trône de Cernunnos. Au centre de la forêt, l'aventurier déterminé trouvera Lavondyss, le bois de l'âge de pierre.*

*Les personnages, rois et guerriers, sorciers et demi-dieux, qui peuplent nos mythes peuplent aussi la forêt. Chose étrange, le bois de Ryhope tire son énergie de l'imaginaire des personnes qui vivent aux alentours, ou qui s'y aventurent. Plus la forêt gagne en énergie, plus elle manifeste des mythes anciens, plus proches de leurs origines.*

*Georges, avant sa mort, l'avait compris. Il avait alors décidé de s'aventurer de plus en plus profondément dans la forêt, pour créer des mythes de plus en plus puissants et donner naissance à la Première Légende, l'homme-sanglier des hommes de l'Âge de Glace... l'Urscumug.*

... Bon, ça, c'est ce que je peux raconter sans spoilers. Cela dit, même si Stephen et Christian sont les personnages principaux, la Forêt des Mythagos est divisée en six parties, chacun avec des personnages différents et des personnages différents. Si on s'intéresse un peu à la mythographie, c'est un bouquin monumental. Si on aime la culture celte, c'est encore meilleur. 

C'est un bouquin dont le principal défaut est d'être assez dense parfois, l'auteur se perdant dans l'explication et la théorie des mythes sans faire avancer l'histoire.

Have you caught Kaletsky' take on the issue? He argues the same thing we do:

&gt; Suppose the new money created since 2009, instead of propping up bond prices, had simply been added to the bank accounts of all U.S. and British households. In the U.S., $2 trillion of QE could have financed a cash windfall of $6,500 for every man, woman and child, or $26,000 for a family of four. Britain’s QE of £375 billion is worth £6,000 per head or £24,000 per family. Even if only half the new money created were distributed in this way, these sums would be easily large enough to transform economic conditions, whether the people receiving these windfalls decided to spend them on extra consumption or save them and reduce debts.

It became less necessary as time went on and it became more obvious that Germany was losing the war. 

With Russia out of the war, and no end in sight since Germany would then have power over almost the entirety of Europe, Fat man and little boy would have likely been dropped on Germany. 

And if Japans reaction to nukes was to surrender, then Germany didn't stand a chance. 

The Japanese were at a whole different level when it came to honour and the act of surrendering. 

Germany, on the other hand, had already dealt with surrender once and would probably feel like such destruction wasn't worth it. Plus there'd be no way to know how many bombs the US had.

Luck plays a part, but it's far from all. Both of these things come to a large extent from skills.

Why not make it easier for both?

Because these families value education more and has good contacts.

Sadly not every applicant can be tested before hiring. That's why those papers matter a lot.

Franceschini: Penso tuttavia che dobbiamo evitare di omogeneizzare tutto, cosa che vediamo costantemente nella globalizzazione. E’ tutto standard, gli stessi prodotti e gli stessi negozi. Non sto dicendo che in Italia non si debba fare informatica, ma che ci sono anche qua delle professionalità. Magari un ragazzo italiano sa meno di informatica ma più di storia medievale, mentre un ragazzo americano magari sa meno di storia medievale. Questo si fa fatica a capire. Se siamo nel villaggio globale ognuno, i paesi, ha delle peculiarità da investire. Poi il ragazzo italiano andrà a insegnare storia medievale in California e un californiano insegnerà informatica a Perugia. Dobbiamo essere felici che i ragazzi vadano all’estero almeno a fare esperienza formativa per poi tornare.

Many are saying the chart reflects revision of history. That's likely true in part, however, I believe it's also true that few people understood what the he'll happened back in 1945 and that it took at least a decade or two for historians to even begin to understand the scope and scale of contributions. Meaning, the original poll is likely less informed than subsequent polls, which is the opposite of the general opinion here.

that school of thought is just plain wrong because it doesn't account for corruption. For comparison, take a look at Ukraine that followed exact same path as Russia after Soviet collapse. Except Ukraine never had their ""Putin"". So their period of chaos and corruption was merely followed by corruption becoming so entrenched that it brought the country to ruin.

Current government of Russia may be corrupt, but they seem to at least give a shit to the overall welfare of the country as a whole. Yes it would be better to have leaders that are not corrupt at all... or at least leaders who care about welfare of population rather than just power of the country... but that's not the world we live in.

What this did was make the Eastern campaign a risky inadequately supplied endeavour in the end as a large force was continually tied down unable to move where it was needed, if there was only one focus, then what the German Wehrmacht had available would certainly have routed the Soviet forces earlier in the war, thus overrun the industry and forced a Soviet capitulation.


If US. had pulled out, first of all GB would have starved into submission, secondly the USSR war effort would have crumbled, having no emergency weaponry delivered through lend lease would have absolutely crippled them, and no longer having a threat of a landing would mean all remaining German vehicles, manpower and resources would have been moved to the eastern front early in the Barbarossa campaign.


If GB surrendered/accepted peace, the US would no longer have a platform on which to create a landing in Europe, such that all efforts of the Wehrmacht would again be focused on the eastern front early in the war, meaning the USSR would have lost, any lend-lease would have to travel the way from Alaska-Siberia and it would be questionable if the US. would even do this in such a scenario where GB was no longer in it itself, I suspect US. would simply stay out of the war completely at that point.


Also worth remembering is vital supplies going from GB to USSR through the north passage, no foreign born British Empire fighters nor resources would be available.


GB as an unrelenting island fortress was one of the most significant parts of winning the war, so was lend-lease, and the Soviet manpower, and a whole lot of other things, in the end the victory only came from a team effort.

Franceschini, invece, porta il discorso sulla specializzazione, quando parla del ragazzo che va a insegnare storia medievale in America.

Franceschini non si accorge dell'ormai inarrestabile pervasività dell'informatica nelle attività produttive di un paese, per cui egli sostiene, fra le righe, che saper mettere su un database è tanto importante quanto saper ripetere le conseguenze della battaglia di Montaperti.

What the comment you're replying to should have said was 'Military Industrial Complex', its what Eisenhower feared would happen when leaving office and [he made his fears very clear in a farewell speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-jvHynP9Y). 

The Military Industrial Complex has contributed to glorifying war in the US off the back of the 2nd World War. For example; The world was in peril from a terrible evil, we needed to stop it so we created a huge army and saved everyone, thanks to our massive army we stopped terrible crimes. This does not mean we're safe, we need to keep funding our army to stop more evils (new evils being the war on terror)

But without Hitler's paranoia and bad decisions - not the smallest of which was to attack a Soviet Union that had made a non-aggression pact with them - none of the rest of it would have mattered.

When going to the grocery store, bring your own bag.  You'll have to bag your groceries yourself and if you don't bring bags, they have some for sale by the register.  Another thing is the ""pfand"" or deposit on bottles.  Some plastic bottles and many glass bottles will charge you a bit more when you buy them.  You can get this money back by taking the empty bottles to any store with a pfand machine.  You just put the bottle in and press a button to get a receipt which you give to the cashier to take that amount off your bill.  Pfandflache = bottle with deposit.  Pfandfrei = no deposit for this bottle.  It will say which it is near the bar code on the bottle.  You also see people walking around sometimes looking for or even asking for your bottles.

You usually have to pay to use public toilets. Some bathrooms have an attendant and you are expected to give 20-30 cents.

Definitely learn words like danke, Vielen Dank, danke schön, which are all ways of saying thanks.   I would say Hallo is the most common way of saying hello, but you might also hear Grüß Gott.  To say bye, you can say Tchüss or ciao.

You will pick up on a lot of these things during your time there, but it's always helpful to know what to expect.  Have fun!

true,alphager,null,null,"&gt; is German vocational training successful at producing skilled and highly productive workers? 

Yes and no. The vocational training system in Germany sets a certain lower boundary regarding the qualifications of someone that passed the exams (think the Barr exam for lawyers: there are good and bad lawyers...). In general, it produces reasonably well rounded individuals that have an overview about the used technologies and techniques in their chosen field. Anything more depends on the company that takes on the apprentices.

&gt; Do you think vocational training actually is responsible for lower youth unemployment?

Yes, definitely.

&gt; What's the impact of having kids be put on different ""tracks"" depending on their aptitude in school?

Now you're talking about the school system, right? I think the effects are threefold: it's strongly segregating, very demotivating to those in the lower branches and helps to increase the knowledge gaps between the good students and the bad ones(the good ones can accelerate their learning, the bad ones keep each other down).

The segregation goes through the whole society; I have no friends that went to a lower school because the social segregation meant that I only ever met people of same educational level.

&gt; Could something like this system be replicated in the USA or other countries, or can this system only exist with the unique characteristics of German capitalism?

I don't see why it should be impossible to replicate it. The system requires a strong government that sets the curriculum and checks that the companies meet certain minimum requirements(non-exploitation of their apprentices, work safety, etc) and companies that are willing to submit to the demands of said government.",0,1402419128,null,0,false,0,ci3zqbj,t3_27s8yz,t1_ci3zqbj,t3_27s8yz,null,1434177410,5,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,5

Looking at casualty figures is misleading because the USSR was accomplishing less for every dead soldier.

&gt; Starting on 12 January 1945, the Red Army breached the German front as a result of the Vistula–Oder Offensive and advanced westward as much as 40 kilometres (25 miles) a day through East Prussia, Lower Silesia, East Pomerania, and Upper Silesia, temporarily halting on a line 60 km (37 mi) east of Berlin along the Oder River.[14] When the offensive resumed, two Soviet fronts (army groups) attacked Berlin from the east and south, while a third overran German forces positioned north of Berlin. The Battle in Berlin lasted from 20 April until the morning of 2 May.

I know it's en vogue to paint certain events monothematically but because of pointing out details I don't disagree with a general direction. Another example would be the British and French declaration of war against the German Reich as a result of being in a treaty with Poland which essentially started the war. Now step back to WWI whem Austria declared war against Serbia, and Germany followed because of that treaty.

true,Batolemaeus,null,null,"&gt; is German vocational training successful at producing skilled and highly productive workers?

A good question. I'd say ""eh"". It's certainly better than hoping the market alone will fix itself and produce skilled workers, but there's still much to improve. Companies aren't offering enough ""Ausbildungsplätze"", instead hoping other companies pick up the slack. It is bound to fail if this trend continues.

And, having seen the aptitude of some of my peers and their CVs...well, we aren't finding qualified people even for vocational training. It goes both ways.

&gt; What's the impact of having kids be put on different ""tracks"" depending on their aptitude in school?

Disastrous. The separation is far too early. Imho everyone should be on the same track but could simply choose to stay in school longer if they wish to graduate with a higher diploma. The current system is inefficient, leads to needless duplication of effort and early segregation into social class.

The biggest problem with the system is how children are simply given up on. Your parents are having a messy divorce while you are in fourth grade and it is impacting your grades? Fuck you, let's ruin your life further by sending your ass to the Hauptschule, where you will be lumped together with other ""Bildungsopfer"". It breeds a class of unproductive and uneducated people, which is a huge liability on society.

Social mobility is pretty bad in Germany, and the education system is largely to blame for it. 

&gt; Could something like this system be replicated in the USA or other countries, or can this system only exist with the unique characteristics of German capitalism?

The concept of vocational trading isn't all that revolutionary. However, and this is going to go deep into stereotype-county, US corporate culture is far too selfish and focused on short term gains. The system of vocational training Germany employs requires cooperation and trust between parties who might not immediately notice any gain, and it also depends on employee loyalty. To pay off for both parties the employee and employer need to work together for quite a few years. 2-3 years for the actual training plus several years for the employee to be a productive worker.

I remember listening some Greek communists discussing something related on radio. Back in the 40s, they couldn't really know what was going on in the USSR. They were mostly unaware of the Stalin's most controversial actions until the Perestroika, and conversely, they had to take accusations of treachery at face-value because they couldn't confirm it. So many ""good comrades"" from Greece were exiled in socialist Albania because at the time, they were thought to be implicated in crimes (and Greek Communists were fighting a war to restore democracy (under the command of the Greek government-in-exile, but with different goals in mind) in post-Nazi-occupation Greece, so they couldn't be seen associating with war criminals, even if the accusations were later proved wrong).

true,metroxed,EUSK,Basque Country,"&gt;So what's the difference between Euskadi and Navarra?

*Euskadi* is the Basque name of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country (*Comunidad autónoma del País Vasco*) and technically it refers solely to Bizkaia, Gipuzkoa and Araba. It is different from *Euskal Herria* (Greater Basque Country), and has two regions: Hegoalde (Bizkaia, Gipuzkoa, Araba and Higher Navarre) and Iparralde (Lapurdi, Xiberoa and Lower Navarre).

&gt;My understanding is that Navarra is to Euskadi, as Valencia is to Catalunya. In some distant part they have been together, and for some reasons that changed.

Not so distant. Navarre was considered another Basque province up until the early 20th century. Up until 1876 when the fueros where abolished, they four were called ""España foral"", different from the ""España uniforme"" (Castile, Leon, Andalusia) and ""España asimilada"" (former Crown of Aragon).  It was during the Second Spanish Republic that they first decided not to take part in the autonomy statute and that position continued during the Transition. 

In Spain there's the idea that Navarra is completely different from the Basque Country and that the Basques want to ""annex"" Navarre or something like that. It doesn't make any sense; in France, the Lower Navarre is part of the French Basque Country, and the Lower Navarrese call themselves Basque AND Navarrese without any problem. Besides, let's remember that both the Basque language and the Basque people (vascones) originated in Navarre and then moved north to populate present-day Euskadi.

The key of the question is, that not the whole of the Higher Navarre (Navarre in Spain) feel Basque. Pretty much the northern half does, and the middlelands something close to 50/50. The people from southern Navarre and the Ribera do not feel Basque, and they are correct not to: the Basque language was lost there before the 5th century and the culture not much later. They have every right not to feel Basque. As much as the people from northern Navarre do have the right to feel Basque. There's a saying among northern Navarrese that goes: *De Pamplona para abajo, España* (south from Pamplona, Spain). 

&gt;Also, I think it's interesting that many nationalists ask for decentralization and the right to decide unless we're talking about a group of people on their territory. In the end, it's not so different from the centralists, or does it?

Not really. Navarre has as much right as Euskadi does to choose its own future. If it happens they decide that want to be part of Euskal Herria, wonderful. If not, so be it, their decision should be respected. ",0,1402420573,null,0,false,0,ci40i1h,t3_27melr,t1_ci40i1h,t1_ci3gn3u,null,1434177770,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;or can this system only exist with the unique characteristics of German capitalism? 

Are you shitting me?

In what way do you believe German capitalism different than any other?


&gt;is German vocational training successful at producing skilled and highly productive workers? 

Yes. 

&gt;Do you think vocational training actually is responsible for lower youth unemployment? 

Partially. Another reason would be the behemoth of the German education system, where you can be a student (and therefore not count as unemployed) all your life. 

&gt;What's the impact of having kids be put on different ""tracks"" depending on their aptitude in school? 

You have that EVERYWHERE in the German education. 

Gymnasium~=high school =&gt; you are going to college. Mittlere Reife =&gt; trade it is. Hauptschule =&gt; useless retard. Good luck getting anything, including more education. Some companies sort you out no matter your grades. There are people suing to get their children in Gymnasium and the pressure is simply insane.

Almost every diploma comes in at least two flavors: Technisch = MINT or Wirtschaft = financial/economy, perhaps social, which limits you what you can study etc.

Main problem is that the trades are still considered less desirable against a college degree, never mind that you start earning from day one.

&gt;Could something like this system be replicated in the USA or other countries, or can this system only exist with the unique characteristics of German capitalism? 

You need companies that allow for training on the job. And free time for school. Otherwise it gets already done under different apprenticeship names.

Long story short -- Vasily Budick, ""executed"" in the video, confirmed in phone interview to 2+2 channel that it was staged. Ukrainian forces and separatists planned prisoner exchange -- separatists were ready to exchange Budik, colonel Vaschenko, one more civilian, and 2 soldiers on some woman Olga detained by SBU. But in the end Ukrainian rejected the deal. So the video was filmed to influence Ukrainian society.

----

EDIT: Also Budick was interviewed today by [Obosrevatel](http://obozrevatel.com/crime/28460-bezler-otpustil-6-pogranichnikov-i-otnositsya-k-nam-luchshe-ukrainskoj-vlasti-grazhdanin-gruzii-iz-plena-dnr.html) and [112.ua](http://112.ua/politika/uchastniki-inscenirovki-rasstrela-plennyh-bezlerom-rasskazali-o-prichinah-sozdaniya-video-73906.html). The interview by Obosrevatel (Google Translate):

&gt; According to Budick, together with him in the seized Gorlivka's OBOP militants hold two men of the 25th Commando Brigade and Colonel of SBU. At the time of a call, the other hostages of the fake ""Donetsk People's Republic"" were next to Budick. Bezler (Bes) was willing to trade all four prisoners for a young woman - the wife of one of its fighters, Kulygina Olga Ivanovna. This woman was arrested while attempting to cross the Russian-Ukrainian border with undeclared 10 thousand dollars, she tried to smuggle to Gorlivka.

&gt; ""I am in captivity for 41 days - said Vasily Budick. - Bezler is ready to trade us for Olga Ivanovna, which is in the SBU Kiev. We feel good ... now. We are waiting for our rescue. All authorities were involved, the decision is up to Poroshenko. SBU, the Ministry of Defense, National Security Council - all do not mind. Already once agreements have been reached, remained until half an hour of our liberation, but Turchinov canceled everything. Afterwards Bezler let go 6 border guards from Lugansk just like that, without any exchange. These guards were deserted by their commander and then the rest went to Russia, and 15 fighters moved to Kharkov, and 6 of them were captured. ""
&gt; 
&gt; According Budick for young border guards came Rubezhnoye their parents. A common earlier video shot himself and Colonel Vasily Budick SBU was staged in order to hasten the exchange of hostages.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Until Bezler called to the parents, they did not know what happened with their children - told Budick. - Bezler released one son to every mom and dad. The Border Service didn't interfere - it is nonsense that they were involved. Bezler wanted to show with our execution that something like that could happen too - your pick. ""
&gt; 
&gt; According to Budick, before terrorist Bezler (Bes) voluntarily released three other fighters of the Ukrainian army, whom the government has forgotten.
&gt; 
&gt; ""Nobody worries about the fate of the captives. Mothers of the soldiers of 25th Airborne Brigade, which are here next to me, had already arrived for them to Gorlovka - waiting for their children to be able to leave the territory,"" - said Vasily Budick to Obosrevatel.
&gt; 
&gt; Captives, according to the words of Budick, were shocked by the indifference of Ukrainian authorities about their fate.
&gt; 
&gt; ""What threat to Ukrainian security may be this Olga Ivanovna, they say that she has 4-year-old child ... Why she can't be exchanged for four prisoners of war?"" - says hostage.
&gt; 
&gt; Georgian government delivered a note about Budick to Ukraine. According to the prisoner, President Poroshenko yesterday paid 3 minutes for a meeting with the Ambassador of Georgia, who asked to hasten the release of Budick.
&gt; 
&gt; ""One signature -- and we will be free. But while the Ukrainian government treats us worse than Bezler. Bezler laughs:""This country needs you? ""- Said Vasily Budick.
&gt; 
&gt; Nevertheless, a citizen of Georgia Basil Budick not ceased to be a patriot of Ukraine. ""We serve the people, not the government - says prisoner. - Looking for politicians, convinced that these people are not gentlemen of his words, but I still love the Ukrainian people.""

L'introduzione della minuta carolina realizza una sorta di koinè grafica che progressivamente appiana queste differenze: monasteri prima ed autorità civili poi iniziano a scrivere (e dunque a farsi leggere) potenzialmente da chiunque. Questo ha un impatto clamoroso sulla celebre trasmissione del sapere e su tutto quello che da essa discende (ed il campo strettamente culturale cessa abbastanza presto di essere quello più importante).

1. No one doubts the Soviet Unions massive contribution to the war effort who knows anything about WW2

2. Keep in mind the Soviet Union was getting massive amounts of Aid from the US to keep it going, including the majority of its food, SPAM single handedly saved the Russian state from total collapse...yes you heard me, SPAM. Ask any WW2 Russian Vet, and they will all tell you how much SPAM saved their asses. Nikita Kruschev publicly remarked that Russia would have lost the war if it had not been for Spam from America. The US was suppingly iteself, Russian and the rest of the Allies AT THE SAME TIME. None of the other allies send material to each other in large amounts for support through the entire war, they were taxed to the max to just hold the line.

3. The US was fighting both the Germans AND the Japanese at the same time AND advancing on both fronts almost from day one when they entered the war. The Soviets joined WITH the Germans to invade Poland, and fought purely defensively for two years against them later when Hitler changed his mind. The Russians were pushing the Germans back slowly when D-Day began, but it wasnt until the US Army Air Force destroyed the Luftwaffe that Russia made significant gains 

4. ""D-Day was a distraction"" is revisionist bullshit history from the Russian side. Stalin begged for a western front to draw the Germans off of his troops for years. Thats like saying Waterloo was just a distraction by the English so the Germans could take France. This invasion forced the Germans to fight on two fronts, without the industrial might like the Americans had, under constant bombing, with few allies, and they did for years AND they still almost won. Say what you want about the Germans, they arent stupid

5. You dont see dead Russia troops buried all over Normandy and parts of France..does a lot for PR when you can drive almost anywhere in France and see the grave of people who fought to free a country not their own.

Then you add the cold war on top of it...yeah its not suprising. Keep in mind, a lot of french people were killed by allied bombing (wrong place, wrong time) so many french were pissed AND lets not count out the Vichy French as well, hence the pro-Soviet-ness in 1945. Then as time went on, with the cold war, its not suprising

Relative to contemporary societies in Europe: the Holy Land at the time of the Crusades, the Mughals in India, Al-Andalus before the life of Maimonides, and arguably certain periods of the Ottoman Empire all had strong claims to being tolerant and diverse.

For instance, the fundamentalist Muslims from Morocco that took over Al-Andalus from its previous Muslim rulers were pretty bad, but they were significantly better than the English at the time (who were issuing the [Edict of Expulsion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Expulsion) to expel all Jews from the country), or the Spanish Catholics who took over from them, who subsequently purged Spain of very large Muslim and Jewish populations, and then launched the Inquisition to strictly crack down on any deviation from Catholic Orthodoxy.

The society most of us currently live in is a modern invention, and tolerant of cultural and religious differences in a way which existed nowhere in the world before the last century, so it's hardly a surprise that you will find no examples of that in the history of Islam (especially given that most Muslim countries have been subject to serious and ongoing turmoil and/or colonization for much of the last century - not much time to develop a tolerant, enlightened culture in a place like Afghanistan, dirt poor, during the short periods between successive invasions).",0,1402425604,null,0,1402425900,0,ci435ax,t3_27rlam,t1_ci435ax,t1_ci413lt,null,1434179083,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

The problem is that the young industrious people from the poorer Eastern European countries go and work (in the UK). Not because they are stealing jobs, or factories move to those countries but because they are driving salaries down, and hurting their original countries. Important to keep young people for the future (remember age pyramid). Capitalism and neoliberalism is ruining Europe and needs to be destroyed, left have to realise that they should sympathize with the poor in Europe and not listen to opportunistic right politicians that try to capitalize on xenophobia. To stop the move of production from west to east and let east work cheaply in west some kind of minimum wage across EU (with different minimums for different sectors) needs to be put in place.
