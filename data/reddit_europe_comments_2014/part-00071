First off: I was kind enough to provide sources and also point out, where I was too lazy to find them. I suggest you do the same -especially when you apparently want to go into a contentious and silly debate.

Here are some sources that contradict your claims.

* [According to Eurostat](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Fertility_statistics), France has a birth rate of 2.03. That's actual one of the highest in Europe - not very ""dismal"".

* Cr√®ches are nowhere as universal as the Scandinavian child care systems. In fact, [almost 20 percent of parents](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/may/21/child-care-costs-compared-britain) in France rely on non-official child care ([often because they can't get a spot](http://www.forbes.com/sites/pascalemmanuelgobry/2013/04/17/4-myths-and-one-truth-about-french-childcare/)) compared to &lt;1 per cent in Scandinavia.

* Muslims made up 7.3 percent of the French population in 2010 with an estimated increase to 10.3 in 2030. That's hardly enought to significantly increase the overall birth rate. Especially when...

* The fertility rate for French muslims is 2.8 (compared to 2.2 in all European muslims). The relatively high birth rate of European muslims can mostly be explained by socio-economic differences. As I pointed out above, the less education and wealth a group posseses, the more likely they are to have more children. Currently, muslims are disproportionately working and underclass. As muslims advance socio-economically, their birth rate drops as well.

true,ZioTron,null,null,"MHM.. what a difficoult question...

Let's try to synthesize:

.


Fascism and Mussolini represent a very **dark time of our past that many of us are ashamed of**.

Even if **a minority**, there is some people who **still respects the person of Mussolini**.

Obviously some of them are **NeoNazis or right wing extremists**, like there are in any country...

The strange thing is that **even** in **the common people** someone still has the feeling that *""Si stava meglio quando si stava peggio""* (It was better when it was worse).

This is due to a couple things in particular:

- The typical **Italian aversion to changes**, that has brought us to use that  sentence through Mussolini, Andreotti, Craxi, Berlusconi, etc...

- **Many feel that Mussolini did good until he allied with Hitler**, after that he lost his ""reason"", effectively exculpating Mussolini of many of his wrongs (and forgetting all the others)

- Mussolini made a **large use of propaganda and media manipulation** giving the impression of a good governement and prosperity.

- Mussolini did indeed **a good number of changes and innovations** 

Many of those changes and innovations **were actually 20-ish years late** in respect many of our european neighbours, and were required if the country wanted to enter the 20th century, like palude sanitation and sewer systems expansion, while others where actually pretty good reforms, like social security system and health assistance, even if made *""in the italian way""* 


PS: Fun fact -  In some of the people who lived during fascism is advisable a certain dualism:

We're recently losing most of them but I had the luck to observe a Tuscan farmer in his natural habitat :P 
(We're talking about a person living in a fraction of a village of 300 souls, the fraction was actually a 2 houses and stables)


He was a partisan, fought to free Italy from fascism but still had the cult of the *Duce*, in his house you could find his weapons and memories from the war along with fascist pictures on the wall saying things like *""E' l'aratro che traccia il solco, ma e' la spada che lo difende""* (The plow draws the furrow, but it's the sword that defends it)

The US has a lot of billionaires, but it also has a fairly high [median income per capita.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_household_income#OECD_Statistics)  

For instance, the gulf between the mega billionaires in the US and the average person might be larger than that of Cambodian millionaires and the average person there. But you would be hard pressed to argue the average Cambodian is better off. 

Also the use of quintiles to measure this is outdated. For instance if an Australian gets a $30,000 raise and an American gets a $30,000 raise, their quality of life increase would be very similar. But the Australian might move up 4 quintiles, where the American might move up one or two. Seems like taking more quality of life factors into account would be a better way to measure changes in income. Quintiles can give skewed social mobility measurements that might not translate into actual difficulty of increasing the quality of one's life.

true,stinkiwinki,null,null,"&gt;Da stellt sich mir doch eigentlich die Frage, warum sich nicht mal jemand hinstellt, den ganzen Lug und Trug aufdeckt

Weil ""die Menschen"" nicht die Wahrheit wollen. 

Nat√ºrlich eine alte Leier, aber letztendlich wollen sie, da√ü die Z√ºge p√ºnktlich fahren, da√ü Benzin weniger als 1,60 kostet, da√ü Sohnemann BWL studieren kann, da√ü T√∂chterlein einen BWL-Studenten heiratet (oder umgekehrt, man ist ja modern) usw. 

Transparente Politik oder gar Partizipation ist f√ºr die meisten Leute wohl gar nicht erstrebenswert. Und diejenigen, die sich irgendeinem Ideal von transparenter Politik verpflichtet f√ºhlen und sich deshalb in den Politikbetrieb begeben, die werden entweder von der Maschine zermahlen, oder stehen am Ende als eines ihrer Zahnr√§der da. 

Oder um mal wieder das K√§nguruh zu zitieren: Beim Marsch durch die Institutionen, wird man zum Arsch durch die Institutionen.

Insofern ist wundert es mich gar nicht, da√ü nicht mehr Leute Transparenz fordern, wenn sie irgendwo doch implizit vermuten, da√ü das einzige was sie durch Transparenz sehen k√∂nnten, eine ziemlich h√§√üliche Fratze w√§re. Deshalb werden auch Parteien die sich haupts√§chlich mit ""weiter so"" auszeichneten aus gef√ºhlter Alternativlosigkeit mit Mehrheiten von 70% belohnt...

Was mich daher eher wundert, ist da√ü so selten diskutiert wird, inwieweit das ein Problem ist, da√ü der repr√§sentativen Demokratie und besonders der Parteiendemokratie, inh√§rent ist und welche Schritte praktikabel oder zumindest notwendig w√§ren, um das zu beheben.

Aber gut...vermutlich w√ºrde dabei herauskommen, da√ü es eigentlich schon schiefging als man vor 10.000 Jahren mit Ackerbau und Viehzucht anfing...

&gt;Das Problem ist aber, dass so ein System aus L√ºgengebilden doch irgendwann einmal in sich zusammenf√§llt.

Macht nix. Kann man immer mit einem neuen L√ºgengebilde ersetzen.",0,1394597876,null,0,false,0,cg0ghsy,t3_2056q1,t1_cg0ghsy,t1_cg07v5i,null,1432763222,2,false,de,t5_22i0,2

It defines you only to the extent when you are ignoring the complicated world image, restricting yourself (for some reason) to the slice presented by ideology.

Naming yourself ""rational"" of course doesn't help - just as you said. Because naming in general is not helping in achieving anything specific, maybe apart from the world of eristic. Basing on facts however, and performing your actions with those in mind, does. Here's where conservatives are failing badly, since in majority they believe in some form of supernatural entity, trying to form the reality with that in mind. 

On the other hand, the rest of political scene is as much failing in the process. No matter if they are closer to the communists dogmas, socialists, liberals or whatever there is. Every single formation I know is based on some ideology, that had failed in some way in the real world already. Maybe EPP is somehow trying to escape it, but it has its conservative and liberal factions with different ideas winning the battle.

What is ironic, and I know it, such rational party will not gain a major voters base in the near future. To win the elections and keep the stand they'd require people en masse to start thinking independently, beeing ready to scrap the ideas they've been fed up with during their lifes. Unlikely.

If your exchange programme can arrange accomodation, use it. 

But finding a room for a semester isn't that hard either. 


&gt; How are the facilities on campus? Is public transport from the university to the city difficult?

There are two campuses, both are directly in Berlin: 

http://goo.gl/maps/rcbu9

http://goo.gl/maps/uZ05U

You usually get a ticket for the local public transport with your semester fees, so you can use the Bus, Tram and S-Bahn in Berlin. 

A Bike is not necessary, but you can usually get a cheap one for som Euros from a fellow student. Just look at the Bulletin Boards :-)

&gt; How is the cost of living like in Berlin? 

Compared to other German larger towns, it's the cheapest. There are some expensive parts of the town, but you can live there pretty comfortable as a student.

&gt;It is estimated that some 18,000 British people have moved to Bulgaria - many to take advantage of the lower cost of living

They are economic migrants. Under paid in the UK they move to Bulgaria for the lower price of life. Under paid Bulgarian move to the UK for higher pay. 

I am fairly certain the UK benefits much more. The UK gets younger and harder workers. Bulgaria gets mostly retirees. 

18,000 seems like a lot, but since they are not all in the same village, they can't really contribute something, like say British public governance. They can't be copy for Bulgarians and teach them better governance. 

No. With only a  Brit or two here and there they are just interesting neighbors. Not even enough to slow down the disappearance of Bulgarian small towns and villages, which thanks to our ever shrinking population are melting away all over Bulgaria.

First, Stuttgart is an ideal area for you to live in as an American expat. You have IBM, HP and a lot of others here, other US military as well, so you can build a social network quickly. Also, the area is incredibly safe. My former boss (US expat) liked it so much that he tried to settle down here after retirement, it was just that his wife couldn't bear to live out of the US anymore. Otherwise, he would have been a happy man here.

Second, nurses are highly sought after in Germany, and moreso in the Stuttgart area. There are a lot of nurses from third-world countries in Germany who seem to have no problems working here, I would expect an American nurse to get red-carpet treatment.

Renting or buying shouldn't be an issue at all, one of our neighbours was also an expat from a US company until they moved away after they bought a new home. The landlord of a house we were interested in told us that there is even a property market catering to US expats specifically.

To get a feel for the city of Stuttgart, you can look [here](http://www.stuttgart-tourist.de/en). Keep your eyes open for opportunities in surrounding villages, though.

What they have in common is enough to draw the comparison. You're saying that a region has to be demonstrably in a horrific situation before it can declare independence.

I happen to disagree. If declaring independence can avoid the potential for horrific scenarios, like genocide, in a preemptive manner, than it's legitimate. And not even the danger of genocide is needed. If a region is the buffer zone in a conflict between two nations, one of which doesn't even have a democratically elected government, the multifaceted danger that poses to the region (danger against the region's people, economy, etc.) is enough for it to claim independence so that it can then decide for its future in that geopolitical situation.

What a joke.

Look, the point was that the situations were radically different, as I've discussed elsewhere in this thread. The difference is that with Kosovo the foreign army there was a UN sanctioned NATO-led multinational force that was legal in all respects of international law, and which had open and transparent referendum in '08. In Crimea, it's thousands of soldiers without military insignia and who are, politically and legally speaking, accountable to no one as they have no legal authority to be in Crimea (in fact, their very presence is illegal), who are occupying the region and where the sessions of the Crimean Rada are not transparent in any way, shape, or form.

That is why the situations are so markedly different, and why I don't support a secession vote in the Crimean rada. There are certainly many other ways a country could secede (for example, I support the right of Scotland, Catalonia, the Basque country, etc to secede if they choose to, and there has certainly been no genocide there). But the point is that the Kosovo-Crimea situations are radically different and should not be compared to make the argument that Crimea should be able to secede.",0,1394614816,null,0,false,0,cg0kqzw,t3_204ozh,t1_cg0kqzw,t1_cg0kp2x,null,1432765293,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Which basically excludes any place where we could make good use of them, i.e. near industry and population concentrations.

&gt;Even though there are dangers, I think ultimately the response to nuclear power is a knee-jerk response by our primitively-wired psyche and does not come from reason.

I think the love of a big powerful force like nuclear plants (that promises to solve all of our problems at once) comes from the same primitive brain, together with the tendency to bet the farm on the off-chance that nuclear indeed is the panacea its proponents want it to be. I guess our species has passed through and evolutionary bottleneck where taking a huge risk paid off once, and now we're stuck with that mentality - a mentality that served hunter-gatherer troupes well, perhaps, but that really isn't adaptive anymore when the effects of a botched gamble affect the whole species.

Seatbelts don't require decades to build and don't require additional research to iron out some essential hurdles in implementation.

&gt;Just like every company working on a product which does not yet exist to solve a problem which does exist is acting irrationally?

They are irrational if they expect people to drop everything else and wait patiently until their research is finished as if they can't fail.

Any problem that prevents a reactor from being implemented is a fundamental problem for the energy supply.

Nuclear energy has been subsidized up to the wazoo for decades, if only because of World War 2, the Cold War etc. All they produced were requests for even more grants. They've had plenty of time. Let's level the playing field and make renewables catch up in research funding.

However #2, those who partially like him have mixed feelings. Just like atm is impossible to choose a good political party in Italy, and you're stuck in a limbo. 

So, before him we had a dumbass king, and after him pseudo-communists. 

In short, some people like its patriotism, in the sense that he wanted to make us feel more Italian and be proud of it. 

Good sides, bad sides. Gotta be objective.

Not necessarily, mostly you have to worry about wind and river direction. Keep in mind that a modern reactor meltdown is contained very well in comparison to a nuclear bomb. Leakage is the primary concern, so building it downstream and downwind is important, but the distance can be reasonable, say 50 kilometers.

&gt;We got into our fossil fuel habit one shovelful of coal at a time, we'll get out of it one solar cell at a time.

I just think that kind of mindset is slowly killing our planet. Climate change changes the climate, so building climate dependent energy sources is really risky if you believe global warming is irreversible.

&gt;big powerful force like nuclear plants

It's not really that big or that powerful, you can build small reactors too. Nuclear power generators either have no influence on the environment or in the worst case scenario have a positive influence on the environment at the small risk of causing humans harm. 

Nuclear accidents happen less frequently than earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters with less devastating consequences. In the case of nuclear power, it may bother people that humans are responsible for the death of humans rather than it being nature, but on the other hand we are ready to go to war if someone does ""us"" harm.

And now people are so worried about radiation from the Fukushima plant, forgetting the real tragedy, the 270,000 displaced and the 19,000 dead in Japan. What about Haiti? 150,000 dead.

If people are willing to live in San Francisco knowing full well (historically and scientifically) the risks of a devastating earthquake, why can't we have the same mindset about nuclear power?

Das ist vermutlich auch der Grund, weshalb dich niemand anmacht. Das, und dass du es vermutlich ernst nimmst.

Ich gebe mal ein paar Beispiele aus meinem Bekanntenkreis.

1. Fall: Kollegen und ich entscheiden uns was leckeres in einem t√ºrkischen Restaurant zu essen, eine vegetarierin ist mit dabei, aber im Vorfeld schon abgecheckt, Restaurant hat umfangreiches Angebot an vegetarischem Essen. Vegetarierin nimmt H√ºhnchen, Begr√ºndung: Sie ginge ja nicht alle Tage t√ºrksich essen und wolle was leckeres.

Resultat: Ich nehme sie nicht ernst und wenn sie mir erz√§hlt wie viel besser das Veterarier sein ist, mach ich Witze und wie gesagt, ernst nehmen kann ich sie dann nicht mehr.

2. Fall: Kommilitonin isst Maoam und Gummib√§rchen die mit Rinder/Schweinegelatine gemacht worden sind. Resultat: Siehe oben (wenn auch nciht ganz so extrem, zudem hat sie nie etwas von den Vorteilen des Vegetarier seins gepredigt)

3. Fall: Das ist jetzt die H√§rte! Abistufe, ich bin neu auf der Schule, erfahre das M√§del XY Vegetarierin ist, aus reiner Neugier frage ich nach den Gr√ºnden. Sie sagt: Das t√∂ten eines Tieres gliche dem t√∂ten eines Menschen, folglich w√ºrde man menschliches Fleisch essen, wenn man Tiere isst. Seh ich nicht so, aber ok, respektiere ich. 3 Wochen sp√§ter kommt sie angerannt und lachend und strahlend zu ihrer BFF, mir ist die Kinnlade runtergefallen. Sie trug einen Hasenpelzmantel. HASENPELZ! Dann prahlte sie, wie lange sie daf√ºr gespaart habe, dass der Pelz eigentlich das Innenfutter ist, sie es aber linksherum tr√§gt damit das au√üen ist, bla bla bla. Ich sagte: Warum? Du bist doch Vegetarierin. Sie: Und? Ich: Das Verarbeiten von Tierfell zu Pelzmantels ist wie das Gerben von Menschenhaut zu Leder, folglich tr√§gst du eine menschliche Lederjacke.

Oh, and we're not raping our allies. *lulz* It was our allies who helped us with PRISM if you don't remember you don't follow your own country's politics. **It's not rape when it's consensual.** ;) You might have a misunderstanding of the word. :)

 How's that united country and nuclear umbrella going for you? Hope you didn't mind us garrisoning the Fulda Gap for half-a-fucking century. :) Oh, and yeah dude, the future is totally with Russia, just compare Eastern Germany to Western Germany, or Poland/Estonia with Kazakhstan/Belarus. 

Seriously, you're building a fucking pipeline that completely circumvents Poland. You're giving Russia the opportunity to not only increase Europe's dependence on Russia's natural gas, but economically isolating your fucking EU and NATO ally. Now Russia can cut off gas to Ukraine and Poland without cutting it off to the rest of Europe *(yeah, you can redirect gas from Germany to Poland, but at a huge fucking cost of suddenly having to re-direct enough fuel to power an entire nation, and irking Russia at the same time, who Germany just fucking loves to appease)*. 

**Where was Germany in Libya and Mali? Where was Germany when Poland requested extra security? Where was Germany when Poland pleaded with them to cancel their pipeline with Russia which could economically isolate them and increase European dependence on Russian gas? Where was Germany with it's outrageous trade deficit and export policies which is draining the life out of it's neighbors?**

*Germany doesn't give a fuck about the long-term as much as you think it does, it only cares about the short-term and it's immediate needs, no matter who's dick it has to suck or crisis it has to ignore.*

It likes the status quo, so it tries to maintain the status quo by ignoring every fucking thing going on around it, which is a useless fucking strategy. 

**So who's really raping their neighbors?** 

There's a reason that the United States shares such a strong relationship with The Netherlands and The United Kingdom. There's a reason we have such strong security relationships with Poland and Sweden. There's a reason that the Franco-German Brigade fell the fuck apart and France shifted towards more defense cooperation with the United Kingdom and America instead. 

**We're not trying to abandon Eastern Europe, economically and militarily, to Russia like Germany.** We're not ignoring our allies in the European Union when it comes to interventions in Mali or Libya. We're there when they need us. We act when we're expected too. 

*Germany doesn't.* 

**Believe it or not, you might be the savior of the European Union, but you're also it's death nail.** Your failure to take up a leadership role, your failure to help militarily when your European allies need you, your failure to properly align yourself with and push the interests of your allies like Poland *(choosing Russia instead)* is what's going to kill the organization and keep the continent divided, not us.

Personalmente lo trovo ridicolo: da insegnante di informatica ai bambini, trovo molto pi√π importante il *saper trattare* i bambini (che probabilmente deriva anche dalla voglia di insegnare e dalla passione per l'insegnamento) rispetto alla mera competenza. La competenza √® importante a livelli avanzati, quando fai corsi di inglese avanzati dal liceo in su. Puoi essere anche madrelingua Dio in terra per quanto riguarda  l'inglese, ma se non sai trattare i bambini? Se non hai voglia di insegnare? Secondo me a livelli bassi (e diciamoci la verit√†, in Italia poche persone sono a livello talmente avanzato da meritarsi un madrelingua) bisognerebbe dare la possibilit√† a italiani di insegnare inglese **al pari degli stranieri** (nota bene: non dico di dare la precedenza agli italiani! Sto semplicemente invocando la meritocrazia e dicendo che secondo me √® stupido dare la precedenza agli stranieri!)

A quanto ho capito da altri commenti, OP che dice che vorrebbe una certificazione di madrelingua √® un'esasperazione del fatto che i madrelingua (anche non laureati) la scavalcano in graduatoria solo per la loro provenienza e non per il merito e OP rimane senza lavoro.

&gt;You're also ignoring the data from all the nuclear reactors who do run well

Because averages don't matter when the risk is to turn an area with a radius of dozens of kilometers uninhabitable for an undetermined amount of years.

Car crashes don't make that piece of road impassable for decades.

&gt;If you do the math, you'll find out it's the opposite.

You just insist to hide the extremeness of accidents behind the average so you can ignore the qualitatively different effects.

&gt;Not to mention that nuclear is doesn't put out CO2, so it's safer in a climate change sense. Or that it's a source of energy with the potential to increase humanity's access to energy by a factor of millions, given the energy density of fissile material and it's abundance.

It's comparable to natural gas if you take into account the whole lifecycle, so it's not that fantastic either. The more basic problem with that approach is that our known uranium reserves simply don't come anywhere near providing world energy use, providing that we manage to build that much reactors (required: 4 per week for decades. current lead time for the latest Finnish reactor: 18 years and counting).

true,gerusz,HUNG,Hungarian living in the Netherlands,"No, the question is ""why is it rational?"". If I see the proof, I can start dissecting it to show why it isn't. Until then it's assumed to be irrational.

Also, the real question has two halves:

1. Is UBI rational?
2. Is the EURP's support for UBI rational?

Let's examine this excerpt from the website to find an answer for #2:

&gt; Although rationalism is what the EURP pushes for,

All right...

&gt; one cannot be entirely rational on certain issues.

Not proven.

&gt; Therefore, we must base our morals on something.

Not proven either.

&gt; Some have resorted to religion and others have resorted to ideology. 

OK, this is a proven fact.

&gt; We base our morals on humanism.

Which is an ideology. Unless you can show a rational proof that humanism is better than any possible moral framework or that it is at least better than any other existing framework, choosing humanism isn't rational.

Thus it is shown that either the EURP supports UBI for irrational reasons OR they haven't linked the rational reasons which is just as bad.


For question #1:

Prove that UBI on a multinational or even on a national level would have more positive consequences than the alternatives, for example leaving the money at the taxpayers, spending it on education or supporting small businesses.

My reasoning for why UBI is *not* the best alternative: **where does the money come from?**

I mean shit, at least the [United States actually made serious economic reforms following the Great Recession](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_responses_to_the_subprime_crisis), all while Germany has failed to take a leadership role in the European Union *(which it benefits most from)* and motivate the other members to make serious, wide-sweeping emergency reforms that are concrete and authoritative. 

And you seem pretty confident about that German economy, but I don't see why.  [America came out of the recession four years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Great_Recession), the European Union did as well, but had [a double-dip recession](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/15/eurozone-double-dip-recession) shortly afterwards, [which it only exited from last August](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/13/eurozone-exit-double-dip-recession). In short, we *(America)* still have years of growth *(albeit small)* while Europe as a whole still has years of recession/loss looming over it's head. We've reached pre-2008 levels this year IIRC, but Europe still has a long way to go before it regains the ground it's lost.

Plus, America had a 2012 [GDP growth of 2.2%](https://www.google.com/search?q=u.s.+gdp+growht&amp;oq=u.s.+gdp+growht&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65l2j69i60j69i61j69i60.9043j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8#es_sm=122&amp;espv=210&amp;q=united+states+gdp+growth&amp;safe=off), compared to the European Union's projected 2013 [GDP growth of .2%](http://rt.com/business/eu-gdp-q3-eurostat-707/) (remember, the E.U. was in recession in 2012). And since our growth has remained relatively stable, **our economy is growing at something like 12x that of Europe.** And our 2013 growth numbers are supposed to be even higher, so expect that multiple to rise. If IIRC, we're even projected to surpass the European Union's economy by 2020.

Unemployment wise, the European Union has a [unemployment rate of 10.9%](https://www.google.com/search?q=European+Union+unemployment+rate&amp;oq=European+Union+unemployment+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5239j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8) and the Eurozone an unemployment rate of [12.1%, which is projected to go up to 12.3 percent](http://www.dw.de/oecd-predicts-record-eurozone-unemployment-for-2014/a-16953636)  by the end of the year. The United States has [a unemployment rate of 7.3%](https://www.google.com/search?q=United+States+Unemployment+rate&amp;oq=United+States+Unemployment+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5218j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8), which  is projected to [fall below 7%](http://www.dw.de/oecd-predicts-record-eurozone-unemployment-for-2014/a-16953636)  by the end of the year. 

And to top it off, unlike Germany and Europe with Russia, we're [no longer dependent on foreign energy like we used to be, and we won't be for the foreseeable future](http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/earth_to_power/2013/04/us-natural-gas-reserves-hit-record.html?page=all), so we got that going for us too. :)

Do you seriously think European militaries started dropping cement training bombs on Libyan military targets in some elaborate ploy to get the United States to help when they really didn't need help? 

&gt;Your argument is that the EU is incapable of an action like Libya without US involvement, in reality of course it's able but why would you when US support is so readily available?

**OF COURSE IT DOESN'T IN THE LONG-TERM**. 

It's the most developed and militarily advanced region on the god damn globe. My point was it can't do it with it's present standing military without taking timely emergency measures. You can't be in the middle of a operation like Libya.....and than just be like *""Oh, fuck, hold up Gaddafi, give us a couple weeks/months so we can properly rev-up our military-industrial complex, logistics and intelligence gathering abilities. Kay? Thanks bud.""*

You shouldn't have to take those types of measures when all that is being undertaken is REGIONAL bombing runs with no prospect of occupation. It takes fucking years to build up power projection capabilities, **so get on it**. A lot of men and a lot of weapons doesn't mean shit when you can't use them when you need them, when you can't put them where you want them. We both know war with Russia is slim, but interventions like Mali and Libya are to be expected, so the military should be prepared. You know....isn't that a pretty fundamental part of any peacetime military strategy? Military preparedness for the most likely scenarios? 

&gt;What do you know about being in the military? You're almost certainly some fat, student reddit neckbeard who thinks he understands military matters because he reads some dumb Yank's clickbait on FP, the whole reason I get angry with you is because you clearly don't understand the basics and have zero willingness to learn - instead you dismiss those with more experience than you because you can't afford to have your warped worldview altered.

&gt;My only hope is that you grow out of it.

And what the fuck do you know about me? I do know enough to respect somebody's position, without devolving into personal attacks on them. I guess respect and a balanced conversation isn't something they taught you in boot camp, is it? 

Don't sit here and fucking get on my dick with your psychoanalysis bullshit. I'm not in high school, alright dude, I don't got time for this bitchy catfighting where we trade mean girl barbs and put words in each other's mouth like we got our panties in a bunch.

Sampling method
The sampling was based on a two-stage clustered
stratified design with equal probability of selection for
households within clusters. As the first stage, primary
sampling units (PSUs) were selected for this survey
with probability proportional to size (PPS). Wherever
possible, local electoral territorial units were used as
PSUs, as they have the benefit of having limited and
well-defined geographic boundaries and there is usu
-
ally up-to-date information available concerning the
people living there. Census enumeration districts or
local authorities were used as PSUs where local elec
-
toral territorial units were not available. In each PSU, a
set number of addresses was selected with a view to
conducting a maximum of 30 interviews within the PSU.
To ensure maximum representativeness of the
selected PSUs, the samples were implicitly stratified
by geographical region and by urban/rural character.
All PSUs available in each country were compiled in one
list, representing the total population of the country.
They were then listed within each region by level of
urban-ness, and then in alphabetical order. The PSUs
were then selected with probability proportional to size.
PSU size was measured by the number of households
or, if that information was not available, by the num
-
ber of residents 18 years old and older, the number of
citizens 18 years old or older, or the total population
size within the PSU.
Typically, 50 PSUs and 50 reserve PSUs were selected in
each country, with the aim of conducting 30 interviews
in each PSU. In most countries, the reserve PSUs were
used only after the addresses in the main PSUs had
been exhausted

1. Wozu macht sich Putin eigentlich die M√ºhe, Russia Today zu betreiben und
2. Hat er sich schon beim deutschen Beitragszahler und √∂ffentlich-rechtlichen Fernsehen f√ºr die kostenlose PR bedankt?

In jeder Talkrunde, die ich bisher zum Thema Krim gesehen habe, sitzt ein Kremlbot und erkl√§rt mir Putins Sicht auf die Welt, ob das jetzt der russische Botschafter oder eine von der russischen Regierung bezahlte Journalistin ist. Und dann kommt auch noch das Kabarett daher und sagt mir, dass wir in der Ukraine politische R√ºckendeckung daf√ºr leisten, dass die USA aus dem Land die n√§chste IMF-Kolonie machen. Nicht, dass das falsch w√§re, aber: Das sind die selben USA, die uns ohne R√ºcksicht auf Verluste ausspionieren und der selbe IMF, der zusammen mit europ√§ischer Kommission und Zentralbank die drei Reiter der wirtschaftlichen Apokalypse in Irland und dem Mittelmeerraum gegeben hat. Nat√ºrlich ist es schei√üe, dass wir den Menschen in der Ukraine die 'Wahl' zwischen Pest (Ausbeutung durch uns) und Cholera (Ausbeutung durch Russland) geben, aber wir sind hier T√§ter und Opfer, Geiseln mit Stockholm-Syndrom, die unserem Lehnsherren in Washington den n√§chsten Vassal vor die F√º√üe zerren. Ist ja auch per se nicht schlimm das so darzustellen, ich find Balance in Nachricht und Meinung schlie√ülich gut, aber macht sich das russische Staatsfernsehen die M√ºhe, die westliche Position darzustellen, zu verstehen und sogar gutzuhei√üen? Nicht, dass ich w√ºsste. Und diese Bem√ºhungen werden auch niemanden umstimmen, der glaubt, die Medien in Deutschland w√§ren gleichgeschaltet, im In- oder Aus-land. Nochmal, ich finds gut, aber es sieht mir aus wie vergebliche Liebesm√ºh.

Bonus:
&gt;Na gut, das wirkt dann streckenweise etwas belehrend* und bedient den linksparteisympathisierenden Sozialdemokraten im TV-Zuschauer mit m√∂glicherweise etwas zu mundgerecht zubereiteter Meinung.

'Etwas' und 'm√∂glicherweise' ist noch vorsichtig ausgedr√ºckt.

* Chef Knife **and sharpener**, cutting board (voila, there's your sandwiches). And I'm saying *Chef* knife because the shape is important. Learn to use it, it's 90% of your cooking life. If in doubt, first keep your fingers away from the sharp side, then google. Always keep your knife sharp. If you can't shave at least the one or other hair off your arm with it, it's not sharp. The proper way to do that is three grindstones, but that's overkill for your purposes and hard to master. Get a proper ceramic rotary one, the one from [fiskars](http://www.fiskars.eu/var/fiskars_emea/storage/images/frontpage2/gardening-yard-care/products/tool-care-and-spare-parts/tool-care/120740-fiskars-xsharp-axe-and-knife-sharpener/1699747-50-eng-EU/120740-Xsharp-Axe-and-Knife-Sharpener.jpg) is good and cheap. Cutting board should be wood, for home uses. Bamboo is very nice, and usually even dishwater safe. Keep that bugger dry, store upright.
* Pan, [big and deep](http://i.tischwelt.de/media/produkte/i/b/df/pfanne-hoch-antihaftbeschichtet-28-0-cm-novara-87693045_id160775.jpg). (yes, you can cook rice in it. add some meat and veggies and you have a dish. [Or you could do something proper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z_d0soK1cI)). Spatula. You can also do steaks and pancakes in there, but if you do it often you might want to get a less deep one, as spatula action isn't optimal. You're going to survive it, though.
* Pestle and mortar (and tons of unground spices and freeze-dried herbs. You'll thank me later). Granite, ten bucks or so. It's porous, so keep soap away from it, clean dry or with hot water. Because of that, also keep animal products away from it, but who grinds up meat, anyway.
* Pot, with steam thingie ([like this](http://i01.i.aliimg.com/photo/v6/380343113/3pcs_Steam_Pot.jpg). Enjoy your proper pasta, the rest of what you've got is already perfectly adequate for sauces. Both tomato (pan), cream (pan) and pesto (mortar).
* *Possibly* second knife, short, to peel potatoes, cut off veggie ends, etc. Not strictly necessary, but nice and cheap.
* A vegetable/cheese grinder. [One of these](http://picture.yatego.com/images/4cfddf6403e911.2/grater2-kqh/kchenhelfer-gemsereibe-gemsehobel.jpg), forget about other types, they suck. Note the hand guard / food holder and small grating plates, which means they're easy to clean. You can of course cut everything, too, but if you want to make potato pancakes or such you gonna hate it. Or just grind up some carrots, add some juice, and enjoy, for a quick snack.

Oh, and some dishes and assorted cutlery. But you'll notice if you don't have them.

The original argument concerned Japan's regulatory and training environment. Given that most nuclear accidents are caused by human error, that's not as unreasonable as you might think. Specifically the Japanese concept of ""Saving face"" might have played a role in Daiichi's manager's unwillingness to admit that their plant was at danger. But that's cultural, not ethnical.

When you want to talk about the relative 'safety', you have to use the same definitions everywhere. I'm doing all the work here comparing qualities across different modes, you just say ""it has another quality, therefore no nuclear"". You can't just wave away quantitative analysis. That's the meaning of the word rationality. ""What is the ratio between x and y"". So if you insist on saying averages don't matter, I'm afraid I have to call you irrational.

So evacuation then. Have you seen the video of the wolves of Chernobil? They're doing great. They don't care about radiation. The reason we evacuate is because people are afraid of radiation. What radius is safe is based on the Linear No threshold principle, which holds that there is no safe radiation. In that model, every Becquerel is assumed to increase the risk of cancer. You'll find that in most of the evacuation zone, the risk of cancer in comparable to smoking, or pollution, or staying out in the sun. Oh yeah, UV rays are radiation too, and they stimulate the body's vitamin D. So small amounts are actually healthy, but that makes the math hard. So how large an evacuation zone need to be is not uncontroversial.

Evacuations happen with chemical accidents. Do we shut down the electronics industry? Also, you have to weigh the people that might have a remote possibility of having to leave their homes against all the people who can life a modern civilized life with the electricity from nuclear. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. 

&gt;Car crashes don't make that piece of road impassable for decades.

Maybe I wasn't clear, but coal ect. are the cars in this scenario, and airplanes the nuclear.

&gt;You just insist to hide the extremeness of accidents behind the average so you can ignore the qualitatively different effects.

The qualitatively different effects are the risk of cancer. There is no real agreement about how many extra cases of cancer any meltdown will cause. Estimates range from 0 to 10000, because it's epidemically so hard to seperate this specific cause from all other causes of cancer. So we're dealing with an unknown here.
Pollution increases the risk of cancer every day. So does smoking and sitting out in the sun. We don't ban those, we use protection and we warn people so they can be responsible. But we know the risk of those. So given what I do know, the body count from those extremely rare accidents has to be proven to me to be in the millions, before I consider coal safer.

&gt;It's comparable to natural gas if you take into account the whole lifecycle, so it's not that fantastic either. The more basic problem with that approach is that our known uranium reserves simply don't come anywhere near providing world energy use, providing that we manage to build that much reactors (required: 4 per week for decades. current lead time for the latest Finnish reactor: 18 years and counting).


Now we're getting to the interesting stuff. I didn't say uranium, I said fissile material. U-235 is 0,72% of all the Uranium. Conventional nuclear reactors have less than a percent of efficiency. Again, nuclear is in a league of it's own in this realm, we simply wouldn't accept this from any other technology. We'd probably say that they'd need to go work on it again. And they do, like at [Superph√©nix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superph%C3%A9nix) That's a breeder reactor, runs on the 99% of uranium. It's more efficient, and can use up existing nuclear waste. So now there's 10000 more fuel! Great, right? Well, there was a large NIMBY-movement, it got shot at by ecoterrorists, and shut down to gather votes with the Green movement. That's actually been the typical series of events when nuclear tries to innovate for about 50 years now. They don't care what problems a given reactor solves, they don't care whether the chance of an accident is like winning the lottery or like winning 100 lotteries in a row. They oppose nuclear altogether, just because it's nuclear.

There's plenty reactor architectures that solve the problem you mention. There's architectures that solve the waste problem. There's architectures completely without release of radiation. There's architectures that produce isotopes which are used in cancer therapies. But the decision whether to scale them up or shut them down is made by politicians faced with rabid crowds.

&gt;The most abundant energy source we have is the sun.

The sun is a nuclear fusion reactor that solves the containment problem by not being contained, but by being 150 million kilometers away from earth. So technically , solar is a nuclear technology. Geothermal runs on the heat that the earth's core generates by fission, so technically geothermal is nuclear energy. I'm all for solar energy, wind energy, biogas, all the renewables. We need to stop the fossil fuels, and stop fighting among ourselves. Say in some county, that's 90% of the market. Then obviously, everything else they do has to increase 10-fold. Ten times more wind, ten times more solar, ten times more biogas, ect. Doing that without including nuclear is just making it unnecessarily hard.",0,1394625843,null,0,1394627160,0,cg0mjku,t3_204ghk,t1_cg0mjku,t1_cg0lxw5,null,1432766141,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,CurtHoliday352,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;The funny thing is that I generally agree with you in terms of EU nations meeting their NATO obligations, even though I stop before your desire for a unified EU military or a more ""active"" force, it's kind of absurd that this long after the Cold War we still let NATO members shirk their responsibility and I'd like to see that change.

&gt;My problem with your position is that you use examples as proof of your argument that are wholly inappropriate, like how you say that Libya is proof that the EU needs the US to do anything which is patently not the case. You can argue your position without trying to bend the facts to meet it; saying that every time the US joins in on an operation shows that EU forces are incapable of acting independently is like saying that the US was incapable of handling Iraq or Afghanistan on its own and required help from other nations to invade - it just doesn't join up.

But they are *incapable* of acting without U.S. support, at least for countries like Libya. Sierre Leone, the Ivory Coast, Mali and CAR are all examples of where U.S. support isn't needed, but when it comes to semi-advanced states with Libya with half-competent AA defense and a standing military, than U.S. help is *absolutely needed*. 

Iraq and Libya are nothing alike. It's not even comparable to Mali, because Mali wasn't motivated out of a plea of solidarity for international justification of the intervention like Iraq was, it was about capability. 

Yes, France could've more than handled Mali itself, especially with the United Kingdom helping, but it didn't ask for U.S. help out of solidarity, it asked because of capability. America didn't ask for help with Iraq and Afghanistan because of capability, they asked because of solidarity. The *primary* motivations behind each different. 

&gt;The EU is already more than capable of taking on Russia in a conventional war, just because our spending and power is skewed towards certain member states doesn't mean we're woefully unprepared for a conflict should they force our hand.

&gt;It seems like a pretty moot point though considering the US would never stay out of a conflict like that even if they peeled back their European activity.

Of course it can, because that's a total war scenario. It's not one which relies on power projection and quick, decisive strikes. It allows European countries to fully mobilize their educated populations and technologically-advanced military-industrial complexes. 

Preparedness *(at least in comparison to the type of preparation needed for interventions like Libya)* is secondary when you have the time to align your entire country against it. 

But let's for example, say that Estonia is invaded, or that in the slimmest fucking chance, EU member-states decide to intervene Crimea. American support is cut-off or unavailable for whatever reason *(remember, it's a hypothetical scenario)*. At this point, power projection is absolutely critical, because for all intents and purposes, I really don't, *in my opinion*, think that either the European Union or Russia want to escalate into a nuclear confrontation, or start mobilizing in a *""Total War""* scenario, because then the chances of nuclear holocaust are all be inevitable *(and why it probably will never happen)*. 

So in my opinion, in such a scenario, both Russia and member-states of the European Union would want to keep it as limited and short as possible, as both know they're playing with irradiated fire. It's the same doctrine the Chinese Military is applying to contested territory in the South China Sea when faced with the threat of American reprisal *(as per our MDP with countries in the region)*. 

So, even when talking about Russia instead of Libya, the need for power projection and increased military funding/preparedness is still absolutely critical. 

Of course....this is the same logic the Confederacy used in the American Civil War and the German Empire used in WWI....both of which inevitably ended up as *""Total War""* scenarios...but fuck....I think the point still stands; and who knows what would've happened if Lee captured Washington or Moltke the Younger captured Paris *(without Churchill as Prime Minister to buoy the Home Front)* in the very first phases of each war?

Correction. They are not a distinct ethnic minority. They overwhelmingly identify as Hungarian, but they do have a strong regional identity (think something like the Bavarians - ethnic Germans with a strong regional identity). Only about half of Transylvanian Hungarians are Szekler though.

true,CurtHoliday352,UNSA,United States of America,"Exactly, the Soviet madman was never true, and winter in Russia is no longer the fear. Nuclear weapons have completely changed the game, and Russia can no longer keep retreating until the enemy trips over it's own feet. 

Nuclear weapons have brought Russia onto the same level as everyone else, and made Total War just as costly for them as everybody else. It wasn't like this in WWI and WWII. 

Quick, decisive and limited wars are the future. I don't think we're on the precipice of darkness, but I'm not foolish enough to think that we're in a peaceful utopia either. And I'm not saying each EU member-state should maintain massive, conscripted armies with huge stockpiles of equipment or massive military-industrial complexes, but I do believe that they severely need to increase their power projection capabilities, so they can actually utilize those militaries they have, which are some of the most professionally-trained and technologically advanced forces in the world, against countries like Libya or in scenarios I mentioned above without having to enact emergency measures, or having to rely on the U.S. for logistical and intelligence capabilities to carry out in the operation in a timely manner.

All that is required is a small, tailored, well-trained and well-equipped force which possesses power projection. European militaries *(well most of them)* have all of that....except for the power projection....which even France and the United Kingdom need to focus more on as Libya has shown. 

And I believe China is the best country to back up my example. They have a huge population, a large amount of territory and the world's largest reserves of Rare Earth Materials, with overland borders with some of the most natural resource-gifted nations in the world *(I.E. Russia and Central Asia)*. 

But despite that, EVEN THEIR military leadership has began implementing a doctrine of *""Short, limited &amp; decisive""* wars in potential scenarios against nations they have territorial disputes with in the South China Sea, many of whom, like NATO, have mutual defense pacts with the United States. 

**EDIT:** And Estonia was a wrong example, I should've just stuck to Ukraine for such a hypothetical scenario, so if you don't mind I'd ask you imagine that instead, a place of contention that is nether Russian soil nor EU/NATO soil.

true,Moist_Manwich,null,null,"So Hamburg is actually a city I've got some knowledge of here.  Yeah, housing is relatively difficult to find, but depending on what you're looking for it might not be so bad.  You already know the major resources (though I'd add immobilienscout24.de to that list), so that helps.  And English should not be a problem AT ALL.  Hamburg is a pretty large and affluent city, and most people I've come across have at least a basic handle of English.  

As for the place itself, there are a few things I'd advise knowing.  First, if you're looking for a flatshare with another person, you'll probably have the easiest time finding a place.  The tough part is finding a flat share with someone you'll get along with, which is why I'd advise trying to speak with the person on Skype first, if possible.  Again, English isn't likely to be an issue, though definitely make it clear you know some German and are eager to use it when you can.  Also, flatshares likely won't involve one of the worst parts about finding German flats, the courtage.  The courtage is basically a non-refundable 'fee' that you pay to the 'agent' that lists the flat.  This fee is usually a bit more than twice the monthly rent.  I'm not really sure why people here still put up with this system, considering these websites take care of most of the work related to posting/advertising places, but Germans can be very good at rationalizing stupid things (see the GEZ or TV/Radio fees).

If you're looking for a place for yourself, that will be harder without actually being here.  I really do advise getting a one month flat share first, then look for a place of your own (assuming that's what you want to do).  Though if I'm reading right, this might just be a summer thing?  In which case I wouldn't worry too much about it.  Just try to get a read on the person, and hope for the best.  If you DO want your own place...maybe try a couple week stay in an Airbnb listing when you get here, and devote all your first few days to finding a flat?  It REALLY helps if you can see the place and talk to the people (just like anywhere, really).

You also want to worry about location a bit.  As always, the closer to the middle of the city, the more expensive things will be.  Maybe expect to pay from the low 300s up to 700 or 800 a month if you live in a good district.  General districts I would avoid are Wilhelmsburg, Veddel, Harburg, Blankenese, and Rissen (either not nice or way too far out of the way, although where's your internship at?  If it's Airbus in Finkenwerder for example, maybe Blankenese would be a good thing).  

Sternschanze, Altona-Ottensen, St. Pauli, Eimsbuttel, Rotherbaum (if money allows) and Barmbek are what I'd recommend, kind of in that order.  St. Pauli is a pretty interesting place (sort of alternative, punkish culture there, plus crazy nightlife), and Sternschanze has some really good stuff to do there, and is probably the best 'all-around' district, though maybe a bit loud and busy if that isn't your thing.  Altona is more...preppy, like where a bunch of young parents would live, but it's still in a good location and generally nice.  Also very close to the Altona station, which is handy.  Actually, generally, check and try to get a place within walking distance of either an S or U Bahn station.  The buses here are nice enough, but not nearly as convenient to use.

Be excited for this!  Hamburg is actually a pretty cool city, and if the weather is nice this Summer it'll be a great place to live.  The parks here are awesome, the nightlife is pretty good, and there's pretty much always SOMETHING going on.  Just be ready for the northern German 'coldness'.  People here aren't rude, but they can be very gruff and severe.  It's just their way.  Oh, and if timing works out, register for a Volkshochschule Deutsch course.  Maybe your internship already will have some language course worked out, but if not do this.  It's not very expensive, there are classes all over the city, and the hours can work with pretty much any schedule.  Let me know if you have any more questions, I'll be happy to answer them if I can!

And I sure hope you like pilsner.  Because goddam they sure love it here...

I lived in a fraternity house for two years. Those ""movie parties"" don't happen all the time, but they do happen. We usually used our basement as a party venue.

This was in February.

Usually, though, we would just have simply parties with beer, punch, music, and a bunch of people - no theme. There were six fraternities on campus and six team houses (hockey, football, etc.) and each house would throw two parties per week. So there was a lot to choose from.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"I don't think this is a good idea. The populations of those nations are too low to contribute meaningfully in any way. How do we guarantee that they will contribute and not simply have a parasitic relationship like the majority of NATO members? Is it a good idea to be adding countries to an alliance when most members of that alliance are already freeloading? Is it a good idea to add countries (such as Finland) that border Russia, and simultaneously contribute relatively little?

I know its harsh but potential member countries should be admitted based on a cost/benefit or asset/liability basis. For instance, Baltic nations should never have been admitted. Not only do they lie on the border of Russia, meaning there is no way to guarantee their defense, they are also incapable of providing anything meaningful towards the alliance. These are straight up liabilities. All border states of Russia should be mutually agreed upon buffer states. Sorry, but between Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, there are less than 13 million people in those countries combined. That's under half the population of California. How are we supposed to protect those countries? Is it worth risking a war over such a small population? Is it worth worsening our relationship with Russia over a handful small border states?

If NATO is to be taken seriously, it needs to stop adding liability nations. Norway and Sweden are less liabilities than the aforementioned border states, but who is to say they will be considered assets? There are already a number of wealthy European nations who contribute little, and expect everything. How do we know these countries will be any different?

Edit: I don't usually do this, but can someone explain why I am being down voted? I am merely suggesting that NATO takes a more careful look at who it lets in, and I am using historical precedence to back up my opinion.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; I live in the UK and what I don't understand is how EVERYTHING can be so much expensive. Not only the house market. Every month, I spend 1.5 times more on groceries than I did in France. The fact that the UK is an island seems a bit shaky to explain such a discrepancy, and it's not like the wages were 1.5 times higher.

I agree that the UK (and in particular the greater London area) seems to operate in a different economy from the rest of the single market. Part of this is because London doesn't really feel like other European cities, it is also in a very real sense a global city (in the way that it is a hub for global finance, experiences high levels of immigration from the entire globe, property in London is seen as a safe investment by the entire globe and not just Europeans, and also London-life has a ""prestige factor"", and most of the world is able to find work relatively quickly in London as most people already have some basic English).

The fact that things are so expensive in London (and also elsewhere in the UK), does not really seem to be a deterrent for people. Everyone knows that the Uk is overpriced, and yet people still chose to cross Europe to live there. So I don't really see any solutions to the question of high-price-UK.

For a Brit, even if you own a small London property, you know you can sell up and buy anywhere in e.g. Spain or Bulgaria and live in relative luxury. But the majority of Brits moving to Spain or Bulgaria don't really have the right skills to work in those places, the only rational reason to move there is for a life-style reason. So it tends to be retired people who move to those places permanently or choose to buy a second home there, or alternatively students who want to take advantage of cheap prices, while relatively few British workers move to Continental Europe for professional reasons.

During the last decade I spent quite a bit of time working in Italy and considered buying property there. But in the end I decided to move back to the UK, because I thought that I would get ""trapped"" with an Italian salary and the value of Italian property and end up falling behind my equivalent London salary and London property price and never be able to get back to the UK. Differently, I think that I can probably spend the next decade living and working in London and then move back to Italy if I end up wanting to. 

It doesn't look like it is going to be possible to live in Italy and work in the UK unfortunately. There is no way to make London culture/weather/food more mediterranean. And there is no way to make Italian working practices more anglo-saxon.  ",0,1394631717,null,0,false,0,cg0o2r6,t3_2076kx,t1_cg0o2r6,t1_cg0nnin,null,1432766862,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

I don't think that at least Finland will be joining NATO any time soon as the long term goal inside the political class has evolved more around common European defense. This willingness for European solutions stems out from few notes: 1) Russia sees NATO as American lead coalition and thus as a security threat, while a European defense union would not be even if it would be allied with US, thus it is not a good idea to make Russians more alert by joining NATO; 2) NATO is really too American and would lead to pressure on Finland committing troops on fighting worlds in some god forsaken places on the other side of the world, like Iraq etc..., not a good idea!

true,CurtHoliday352,UNSA,United States of America,"Yes, but it makes any potential military invasion *very costly*. Switzerland's terrain and military preparedness *(bunkers and airbases in mountains/vital bridges, tunnels and railroads rigged or easily capable of being blown up/large amount of the civilian population trained and possessing a military rifle even if it lacks a firing pin for most/nuclear fallout shelters in almost every home or building)*.

Even if they've taken some pretty large steps in scaling back a lot of those measures since the end of the Cold War, the doctrine and basics are still there, making them much more prepared and capable of defending their country than other European nations. 

Hitler hated Switzerland, he called it a *""Pimple on the face of Europe""* and beyond a doubt, he could've crushed Switzerland if he truly wanted too, but he didn't, because it would've been too costly. The Balkans and Greece set back Operation Barbarossa by a season, Switzerland would've set it back by a year.  

So unless Switzerland itself is the primary target to subject and occupy *(even though it's a neutral country, which, for all intents and purposes, won't attack your rear lines and will even trade with you, as the Swiss-Nazi controversies attest to this day)*, that military preparedness and ability is a **huge** deterrent. I mean, why attack Switzerland when you can just go around it? And keep trading with them the whole time? I think Nazi Germany trigger-finger happy ass is the best proof of this rule, and I don't think the Soviets would've attacked Switzerland for the same reason. Hell, when France left NATO, many Soviet plans actually hoped that by avoiding France and not attacking her, and simply focusing on Germany and the Low Countries *(along with the United Kingdom)* they could keep her out the war.

true,iama_george_amaa,LATV,European,"Here's something that was posted today on Facebook by some guy I know, I think it provides enough background details on the history and on the general mood on these annual clashes between Latvian nationalists and Russian antifascists. I'm not the author, I simply translated it, and if you read it, read the whole of it not just the first paragraph.

&gt; With regard to the demonstration of March 16 - if we go there, we really shouldn't be afraid of anything even though anything may happen. Some Molotov cocktails thrown by provocateurs, a few burnt cars, generally nothing extreme, the head of State Police [Ints] ƒ∂uzis has said it on TV and he also says that the situation is being controlled, whatever it means. Meanwhile, in the EU and US news we hear already that Russia has already tried to repeat the Kiev scenario in Latvia and destabilize the situation, and that they have begun to draw their forces close to the Russian border with Latvia, Estonia, and Poland. At the same time, news reports in Russia claim ""we told you already, EU equals fascists if they allow such demonstrations"". In the worst case scenario with such a small incident the Ukrainian war escalates up to a real conflict between EU and Russia. But we were not afraid. And we won't take responsibility. The memory of SS legionnaires is sacred, and it will be kept as such. And to everyone interested it will be correctly explained. Am I right? But maybe we should still get out of the framework of commemorating our grandfathers and have a look at ourselves within a somewhat wider context? Maybe we should ask our grandfathers as a thought experiment what would they like us to do to commemorate them? Would they like to see us commemorating them by the Freedom Monument even if their grandchildren would have to cry for themselves [by their own graves]?

&gt; I think that by not joining such a demonstration any more we would have even less to be afraid of, and nothing would be lost. Except for the only thing that keeps the demonstrators from not going is the need to acknowledge that the fact of having served in the SS legion is nothing special that Latvians should be principally proud of. And to acknowledge that maybe they shouldn't have joined the demo on previous years either. Furthermore, they should remember that even though out of those drafted in Latvia into German legion approx. 50,000 died, additionally approx. 70,000 [Latvians] fell fighting while under the flag of USSR. Because they were drafted in 1940-1941. If we don't commemorate separately those others who possibly had a psychologically tougher job to fight than the legionnaires, then this demonstration is actually unfair because it highlights only the merit of those who served the German side. And now please explain it to someone why it is to be viewed just like that and why is it not to be interpreted as paying tribute to a small part of Hitler's army. You know, it is not easy to put into words even for me as a Latvian. And until our statesmen in such a demonstration don't carry slogans [such as] ""In 1940 and 1945 Latvia suffered unfair betrayal by Europe"", ""Nazi regime was criminal but we had to chose between service or death"", ""Stalin invaded Latvia in 1940 but Hitler did it only in 1941"", ""The USSR army bases could not protect us against Nazi invasion in 1941"", ""SS units never participated in holocaust"", until then each year we will have this problem of having to explain and the risk of provocation.

&gt; So far, unfortunately, it looks like until we have the first serious incident that would be the cause for a precedent in order to adopt a forbidding law, the demonstration itself will remain as a weird and sad tradition. However, as I said, in the current context of Ukraine when history is being written by hours, by joining this demonstration we risk not only our own lives but also those of Ukrainians, Russians and possibly the lives of soldiers of other nationalities. [The lives of] which are still intact and may be kept as such. But this is just my humble opinion. I know that escalating up to war is a too pessimistic scenario to be believable and I really hope that everything will be peaceful on Sunday. But I ask you to think at least, until the next time.

Then Russia could absorb them and suddenly Germany is bordering Russia.

&gt;All border states of Russia should be mutually agreed upon buffer states.

Then there would be no reason for them to even cooperate with NATO and just develop their own nuclear arms programs. Remember we want LESS nukes in the world, not more.

&gt;How are we supposed to protect those countries?

The main deterrent of NATO is the combined nuclear arsenal of its member states, as well as its collective conventional forces. NATO has the ability to escalate to the point where Russia is entirely annihilated, but so does Russia, it's called mutually assured destruction.

&gt;If NATO is to be taken seriously, it needs to stop adding liability nations.

Seriously by whom? The more NATO expands, the less military action Russia can take, because its nuclear umbrella expands to those countries as well.

The real reason NATO can't be taken seriously is because many of its European members, including Germany, Italy etc. are dependent on Russian energy imports, such as oil and natural gas.

&gt;It's a great lesson for Iran and others.

A unfortunate lesson. 

I completely get the principle behind it, and M.A.D. *(Mutually Assured Destruction)* has always reigned supreme in relations between nuclear powers....but the dynamics of the game change when more and more countries get nuclear weapons. MAD than becomes less of a guarantee of peace and more of a game of Russian Roulette *(lulz Russian)*. 

I mean....let's look at the countries in the region.....you have the Pakis, the Indians, the Jews, the Ruskies and the Chinese all with nuclear weapons......all pointing their loaded guns at each other in a small room, all with fingers on the trigger. Now you're going to throw the Persians in there? Who next? The Turks and Arabs are going to get all skitzy and shit, because now not only do the Jews and Russians have nuclear weapons, but now the Persians do too...so *of course* they're going to start their own nuclear programs out of self-preservation. 

Now in this scenario, you have the Turks, the Arabs, the Ruskies, the Chinese, the Pakis, the Indians, the Jews and the Persians all in a small room....and all with loaded guns pointed at each other. 

**And it only takes one bullet to fuck everyone.** 

Even if they arn't related to the dispute, what do you think the Arabs are going to do if they see nuclear weapons being launched out of Iran? Even if they're headed for Israel, the Saudis don't know that, so they launch against Iran, now India and Pakistan see a bunch of nuclear missiles coming from fucking everywhere, so they freak out and fire nuclear weapons, now China see's India launching nuclear weapons and freak out, so they launch nuclear weapons, Russia detects this, so they launch their own nuclear weapons out of fear of a Chinese attack, than Turkey freaks the fuck out and launches nuclear weapons on Russia, which, since they're in NATO, also leads to the United States, France and the United Kingdom launching nuclear weapons. **So...we're all utterly fucked just because two small countries had a ISOLATED nuclear dispute**. 

I don't know what scares me more to be honest, Iran's ambitions for nuclear weapons because of United States' encroachment, or Japan's ambitions for nuclear weapons because of the United States' distance *(low confidence in the American nuclear umbrella)*. 

Both can lead to some pretty nasty fucking regional arms race, and it doesn't look like either East Asia nor the Middle East are going to be the most tension-free regions in the next century.

Those who participate in the march, on the other hand, remind that Latvians in the SS where mostly conscripts and the plan generally was to defeat the Soviets, then turn against Germany, as in, they were ultimately fighting for an independent country of Latvia.

That was really because of the unique historical circumstances of the Iron curtain and communism. Obviously, there wasn't free movement between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War. In much of Western Europe, free movement was extremely easy for a long time before the EU, e.g. at the end of the nineteenth century, Western Europeans travelled around Western Europe very easily. Britain and Ireland had a common travel area long before joining the EU. Londoners and Parisians have almost always found it easy to travel to each others' cities.

I don't really find that a problem.

So yeah. If it means communication will be more efficient, use an interpreter instead of being condemned to struggle and fail to convey your ideas in a language you are not competent enough. 

After all, there are quite a few polylingual states within EU.

That's a problem of mindset rather than a problem of renewables. You're trying put renewables in a nuclear/coal sized hole. Obviously that doesn't work. What works is ramping up renewable capacity until it's covering most of the day and you can dedicate all remaining fossil fuel plants exclusively to load following. At that point you have a picture what the exact cost and time constraints of storing energy will be, and we'll be able to make better use of the electricity that'll be available at dumping prices on the time of peak production. Then we can start to produce methanol from it, for example, as energy storage and maybe even use is as fuel. It would also be an excellent opportunity to recharge electric commuter cars on the parking at work, etc. There's plenty of opportunity, but not if we insist that every innovation must resemble the old techniques with extra polish and extra sugar.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt; The main deterrent of NATO is the combined nuclear arsenal of its member states, as well as its collective conventional forces.

Except the combined nuclear arsenal rests only in the hands of three nations, and so too does the collective conventional forces. Outside of France, the UK, and the US, all the other nations add relatively little.

&gt;The more NATO expands, the less military action Russia can take, because its nuclear umbrella expands to those countries as well.

Except there probably wouldn't be any nukes used. So the more NATO expands, the more it is stretched. Adding the militaries of the Nordic nations hardly adds any capabilities to NATO's conventional forces. Adding a few boats, a dozen jets, and a few thousand soldiers does not compensate for the fact the current forces are now obligated to defend even more nations. Nations that are already averse to spending anything on their own defenses, and sees military spending as a waste that only foolish nations do.

&gt;The real reason NATO can't be taken seriously is because many of its European members, including Germany, Italy etc. are dependent on Russian energy imports, such as oil and natural gas. That's why they aren't really taking any action against Russia right now in regards to the Ukraine crisis.

I agree that this is a significant part of it, but nobody should assume NATO can defend the border nations. Nuclear weapons not withstanding, a conventional war means those nations are swallowed and destroyed in the first week. That cannot be argued. It's simply geography. 

The reality is, NATO cannot indefinitely expand. All the major powers are already in NATO. The other contenders are tiny and incapable of contributing anything. How are small nations supposed to contribute? Here's are our one rusty tank? No thanks.

true,Bezbojnicul,ROMA,Internetistan,"&gt;I'm curious as to what's the situation with Hungarians (or other minorities) in Romania in dealing with regional/local authorities.

The same 20% applies. Excerpt from the [Law 215/2001 of Local Public Administration](http://lege5.ro/Gratuit/gmzdqnzugy/law-no-215-2001-on-local-public-administration/):

&gt;**Art. 17.**- In the territorial-administrative units in which the citizens belonging to the national minorities by a share of over 20% of the number of the inhabitants, the local public administration authorities shall ensure, in the relations with them, also the use of the mother tongue, in keeping with the provisions of the [Constitution](http://www.cdep.ro/pls/dic/site.page?id=371), of the present law and of the international conventions to which Romania is a party.

and

&gt;**Art. 40.**

&gt;(1) The local council shall meet, monthly, on ordinary sittings, upon the convening by the mayor.

&gt;(2) The local council may also meet in extraordinary sittings at the request of the mayor or of at least one third of the number of the council's members.

&gt;(3) The convening of the local council shall be made in writing, through the secretary of the territorial-administrative unit, by at least 5 days before the ordinary sittings and by at least 3 days before the extraordinary sittings.

&gt;(4) In case of force majeure and of maximum urgency for the solving the interests of the inhabitants of the commune or town, the convening of the local council may be made straight away.

&gt;(5) The invitation to the sitting shall stipulate the date, hour, place where it shall take place, and its agenda.

&gt;(6) The inhabitants of the commune or town shall be informed of the agenda of the local council sitting through mass media or any other means of publicity.

&gt;**(7)** In the communes or towns in which the share of the citizens belonging to a national minority is over 20% of the number of inhabitants, these shall be informed of the agenda also in their language, too.

&gt;(8) In all the cases the convening is recorded in the official report of the sitting. 

*Article 106 is basically the same as Art. 40, only it deals with extraordinary sittings of the Local Councils*

and

&gt;**Art. 90.**

&gt;(1) The Romanian language shall be used in the relations between the citizens and the local public administration authorities.

&gt;**(2)** In the territorial-administrative units in which the citizens belonging to a national minority hold a share of over 20% of the total number of the inhabitants, in their relations with the local public administration authorities and with the own specialty apparatus, they may also address themselves, orally or in writing, in their mother tongue and shall receive the answer both in the Romanian language and in their mother tongue.

&gt;**(3)** Under the terms provided in para (2), persons that know the mother tongue of the citizens belonging to the respective minority shall also be employed in the positions regarding public relations.

&gt;**(4)** The local public administration authorities shall ensure the inscribing of the name of the localities and institutions under their authority, as well as the posting up of the announcements of public interest also in the mother tongue of the citizens belonging to the respective minority, under the terms provided in para (2).

&gt;(5) The official documents shall be compulsorily drawn up in the Romanian language.

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Ukraine does have experience with nuclear weapons and has fielded them in the past, so them creating them isn't that far-fetched

It is far fetched for them. If Russia caught wind of Ukraine pushing for nukes again they would be all over it. And they'd be supported because we all know what direction they would be fired in and because the west can hardly be seen to be aiding Ukrainian nuclear weapons. It wouldn't take much to cripple the Ukrainian economy, as has been shown. As for the US specifically, I think they'd have no problem with sanctioning a nuke aiming Ukraine. It would even help Russian relations.

&gt; But what does worry me? The Middle East and East Asia.

The Middle East is interesting because the US has less of a need for the Middle East due to its forthcoming energy independence. Of course there's an interest in protecting Israel and its current allies, but the USA has no reason to bend over backwards for Middle Eastern oil anymore (save assisting American companies in the region).

I would also argue it is not arbitrary, it was an amount all members agreed on to ensure they had minimum defense capabilities on their own, and if another member was attacked they could contribute something. Also keep in mind, regardless how arbitrary members think the target is, they agreed to it.

It is definitely better for the countries not meeting their targets, but the only question is whether the US, UK, and France will continue subsidizing the other members. The highest official in US Defense threatened to leave NATO in a scathing speech to European defense ministers in 2011. He said he realizes that due to budgetary and political concerns most NATO members could not meet their target anytime soon, but they should at least consolidate forces to avoid redundancy. So far, almost zero consolidation has happened, and there have been more cuts. 

People have mentioned its cheaper overall for one country to have a strong army, and protect the others. That may be true, but considering none of the other countries are contributing to the ""big 3's"" military spending it is not exactly the most fair solution. The US has been steadily cutting its budget and has expressed the desire to move resources from Europe, one of the highest income regions in the world, to other locations. The question is not really whether spending or not spending is better, but whether the US will always be there to pick up the tab.

The US tax code offers many deductions, but the biggest one is that capital gains is taxed at a lower percentage than income. This is to encourage investment, but later in life it is also the largest source of income for billionaires. So having that tiered (like income) instead of a flat rate would go a long way. It was also increased 5% relatively recently as well.

That said, even taxing them more would not bring equality down to say a Swedish level. If someone starts a business and becomes a billionaire I dont think of them as a liability, but rather an asset. If all of these people inherited their wealth it would be one thing, but the vast majority of the richest people in the US started companies that employ people. The Walton family is the big exception. That is a sharp contrast to Europe where the strong majority of billionaires inherited their wealth (Forbes list). 

So if achieving greater equality means kicking wealthy entrepreneurs out, not sure I think that is the best solution.

Therefore most companies do serve a global market, mostly done in two ways:
1.) Importer - if they don¬¥t want to do a big initial investment, they most likely contract an importer doing their work, selling, representoing the brand, marketing, etc. (-1 for you - because you need to be hired by the importer)
2.) Affiliate company - if they want to go BIG they just found a small company serving the market (-1 again for you - again it¬¥s not the german company that seeks salesmen)

tl;dr: Most of them are ahead of your idea and have anything set up - go see the Importers/Affiliate companies. (Which of course would mean you could come to Germany several times)

As we all know Sales depends heavily on your network and so it very much depends on the industry sector you have the most contacts and knowledge.

* a cutting board will never be cleaned by your flatmates, and your sharp knives, if they are kept razor sharp, will have this demonstrated by flatmates, ending up with chipped knives and possible holes in your walls.

* The pan will never be cleaned, and will get scratched to hell and back by drunk people trying to cook nasty bacon. Buy something you don't mind throwing away.

* For a 1st year uni student? A pestle and mortar? A bit overkill there, let's just hope they know what spices are first.

* Absolutely agree with the pans. Although again, buy something you don't mind disposing at the end of the year.

* Two knives are essential, simply because one will be lost/broken/left unclean when you want to cook. Also if you can get someone to help you out.

Your flatmates are generally randomly assigned, so the chances of living with 3-4 other clean people is remote, and it's first year, people drink and live on pizza.

true,CurtHoliday352,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;It is far fetched for them. If Russia caught wind of Ukraine pushing for nukes again they would be all over it. And they'd be supported because we all know what direction they would be fired in and because the west can hardly be seen to be aiding Ukrainian nuclear weapons. It wouldn't take much to cripple the Ukrainian economy, as has been shown. As for the US specifically, I think they'd have no problem with sanctioning a nuke aiming Ukraine. It would even help Russian relations.

By not being far fetched, I didn't mean them doing it isn't far fetched, I mean them being *capable* of doing it, much more easily than either Iran or North Korea, isn't that far fetched. 

Otherwise I agree with you. 

&gt;The Middle East is interesting because the US has less of a need for the Middle East due to its forthcoming energy independence. Of course there's an interest in protecting Israel and its current allies, but the USA has no reason to bend over backwards for Middle Eastern oil anymore (save assisting American companies in the region).

While true, the majority of the oil in the Middle East, especially Iraq, doesn't go to America. It goes to Europe and China *(an is extracted mostly by European and Chinese corporations)*, which helps keep the petrodollar afloat. 

And even if the United States leaves completely, it still worries me.

 Iran, Israel, and Saudi Arabia don't have the best relations, and the region isn't the most stable in the world, throwing nuclear weapons in the mix, having a nuclear arms race in effect, would be completely destabilizing and pose a honest danger to all of us. As I said, it could only take one shot for everyone to light everyone up, and even if the United States is completely out of the region, it doesn't erase the Shia/Sunni/Jewish tensions.

The fact is most NATO members have slashed their budgets over the past two decades, forcing the organization to be even more US-centric than the US would like. The US has warned European defense ministers it could leave NATO if this trend continues. As of 2011 the US provided 75% of the financing, more than during the Cold War, and I would assume the UK and France make up most of the rest. 

It has really grown to an organization where three members provide the vast majority of financing and capability. Not at the direction of the US, but to the contrary, much to the dismay of the US. It has been very clear it would like to see a capable Europe so it could downsize its military and move resources elsewhere.

&gt;Und damit k√∂nnen wir auf jedenfall vermuten, dass bereits die erste Pr√§misse (in dieser Formulierung) nicht stimmt.

Mir ist klar, dass der Vergleich zum GPG Thema an der Stelle hinkt; meine Intention war nicht ein neues Thema aufzumachen, sondern nur, dir  deine  eigene Kausalit√§t klarmachen.

Denn, m√∂gliche Fehlerquellen bei dir konkret sind

&gt;Damit w√ºrde es sich trotzdem lohnen nur Frauen einzustellen.

Wer sagt, dass es sich *nicht* lohnt? Weil die Betriebe nicht zu 100% aus Frauen bestehen? Geht schlecht, weil zu wenig Frauen in bestimmten Wirtschaftszweigen. (Woanders gehts ja vllt, in Dienstleistungsbranchen etwa?)

Wer sagt, dass man 100% Frauen in Betrieben will? Glaub nicht, dass die Betriebskultur in die Richtung will.

&gt;Da das nicht √ºberall passiert, gehe ich davon aus dass das GPG eben KEIN generelles Problem ist.

Wie sollte es √ºberall passieren **k√∂nnen** wenn doch immer noch so wenig Frauen √ºberhaupt berufst√§tig sind?

K√∂nnte nach dieser Art von Logik auch so sein, dass eben alle Frauendies auf dem Arbeitsmarkt gibt, um Personalkosten zu sparen schon eingestellt werden und es einfach nicht mehr Frauen gibt.

Empirisch belegt und differenziert ist die Behauptung jetzt -genau wie bei dir- nciht.

Fazit:

Alles was ich sagen wollte, war, dass du mit so einer ebenso eindimensionalen wie anf√§lligen Logik nicht weiterkommst, da da die Empirie bis jetzt in jeder deutschen Studie gegen dich -und f√ºr mich- spricht.

Du kannst halt reden was du willst, es gibt f√ºr deine Seite leider keine realen Zahlen, die dich st√ºtzen, daher ist das nur Theorie. Mein behaupteter Diskriminierungseffekt ist aber sehr stark belegt.

Zwar nicht absolut bewiesen, v.a. nicht in einem endg√ºltigem Betrag festgelegt, aber dennoch genug belegt um die Position vertreten zu k√∂nnen.

&gt; Was ich damit sagen wollte: Gibt es Hinweise darauf, dass die Verteilung von der Norm abweichendt? Oh ja. Banker mit Millionen-Boni und Hausfrauen die sich ein paar Stunden was dazuverdienen.

Ja nat√ºrlich wirds da Tendenzen geben in Wirtschaftbranchen wie da EInkommensunterschiede sind, is doch klar. Aber genau das rauszufinden ist ja auch ein Sinn vom GPG.

Nur diese speziellen Details interessieren mich nicht soviel, als dass ich mich so tief in die richtige Studien einlesen w√ºrde.

Btw, danke, dass du gerade f√ºr die Frauenquote in Vorst√§nden argumentiert hast =)

**Andererseits, hast du wohl noch nicht einmal die Wikipedia Einleitung zum GPG gelesen, weil du schon wieder Schei√üe laberst xD**

Ich zitiere und h√∂re auf mir den Mund fusselig zu reden:

&gt;Dabei ist zwischen einem bereinigten und einem unbereinigten Gender Pay Gap zu unterscheiden. W√§hrend der unbereinigte Wert die Einkommensunterschiede von M√§nnern und Frauen misst, **wird beim bereinigten Gender Pay Gap eine Verzerrung durch unterschiedliche Ausstattungseffekte ‚Äì z. B. die unterschiedlichen Ausbildungsgrade, DIE UNTERSCHIEDLICHE BERUFSWAHL, Qualifikation u.√§. von M√§nnern und Frauen ‚Äì herausgerechnet.**

""Oh ja.""

Aus dem bereinigtem GPG ist die Berufswahl schon drau√üen. Es wird also das **Durchschnittseinkommen von Mann mit den Durchscnittseinkommen der Frauen NACH BRANCHE GETRENNT** verglichen.

Wei√üte, ""Wissenschaftler"" denken sich schon was mit ihrer Arbeit, meinst du nicht? Wenn ihre Studie von jedem Trottel hier in reddit debunked werden k√∂nnte, w√§ren sie arbeitslos. Also mach dich nicht selber ungl√ºcklich hier.

Wei√üte was? Les den Wikieintrag durch und lies dir mal zusammenfassungen der angesprochenen √ºblichen Studien durch. Also was ich gemacht hab, vielleicht klappts dann.

Dann kommste wieder, ja?

Gilt f√ºr das andere inkompetente Downvoter Gesocks hier auch, wette die haben genauso wenig Plan. #Quotenrage

(F√ºhl dich nicht zu sehr angegriffen. Aber erwarte nix anderes, wenn du mit so viel unfassbar groben Fehlern gegen ein ganzes Wissenschaftsfeld laberst und Ich mir in der Diskussion fruchtlos so viel M√ºhe gebe, dir was zu erkl√§ren.)

Yep. Would you prefer that every nation had its own nuclear arsenal? I think that would make the world more dangerous overall.

Why stop there? I'm sure there are certain regions, provinces and states within those countries that add very little as well. Who needs Vermont or Delaware? Kick them out of NATO as well.

If NATO can't defend its borders then it can't defend the main partners either. If Russia were to attack France or Germany, why should the UK or US help them if Russia is not threatening them?

I think the main point with NATO these days is keeping the peace in the West and protecting economic interests as well. The West is all about business and there are trillions of dollars invested, even in smaller nations with little military strength to add to NATO.

The roll rolls with the blade, so that the actual grinding forces are approximately orthogonal to the blade.

For soft steels (and your first blade is going to be soft steel, see the hundred bucks) it comes close to hand-grinding to V edge in terms of sharpness.

For harder steels, you just don't get the best edge you could get out of it. 

By all means, if you drop serious money on a serious knife, get proper whetstones and learn to do that 10 degree angle. But if you just want to have adequately sharp knives without getting overwhelmed, get a good ceramic sharpener.

Gr√ºnde die du danach zu widerlegen versuchst?


&gt; Ja, das ist das, was wir in den Medien gesehen haben. Die Frage ist nun: Wieso steht jemand drei Monate lang auf einem Platz? Hat der nichts zu arbeiten? Ist der mit eigenen Ersparnissen so gut ausgestattet, da√ü er sich das leisten kann? Wenn nein, wer hat das finanziert?


Hast du den Maidan √ºberhaupt verfolgt? Tags√ºber war der Maidan LEER und abends und nachts war er voll von Arbeitern usw. Und ich habe es nciht in den Medien sondern in einem **Livestream** gesehen.


&gt; Da√ü das aktuelle Regime in Kiev einige sehr ... zweifelhafte Leute besch√§ftigt, ist ja nichts neues. Aber offensichtlich sind Neofaschisten akzeptable Verhandlungspartner, solange es uns n√ºtzt.

Richtig aber die Wahlen stehen noch aus. Au√üerdem was bringt die Ukraine denn dem Westen? Die Nato wird vllt versuchen die Situation auszunutzen (was ich scharf verurteile) und eine Basis aufzubauen, aber ansonsten wird der Aufbau einer einigerma√üen gescheiten Wirtschaft ( Die Jankuwitsch und seine reichen Freunde √ºbrigens voll an die Wand gefahren hat) richtig teuer. 

Au√üerdem findest du jemanden der auf Demonstranten schie√üen l√§sst nicht zweifelhaft?


&gt; Du bleibst einen Beweis schuldig, da√ü Putin einen Genozid angeordnet hat (eine reine Aufstandsbek√§mpfung radikalislamischer Kr√§fte, die Verbindungen zu Al-Quaeda haben, ist kein Genozid, sondern Daseinsvorsorge f√ºr den Staat).


Man jagt tscheschenische Terroristen nicht mit der Luftwaffe.Genauso wie man keine 'Schwulenpropaganda' verbietet und Kremelkritiker einsperrt. Und wenn du denkst ich bin pro-USA nope, ich kann einfach nur differenzieren und wei√ü das es kein Gut und B√∂se auf der Welt gibt; Jeder hat Dreck am Stecken siehe z.B Guantamo


&gt; Es gibt keine ""V√∂lkerrechte"". Es gibt ""Menschenrechte"" und das ""V√∂lkerrecht"". Es sind mir keine Belege bekannt, da√ü w√§hrend der aktuellen Situation auf der Krim Menschenrechte verletzt wurden oder das V√∂lkerrecht (das im √úbrigen relativ wertlos ist, siehe Serbien, Irak oder Afghanistan) gebrochen wurde.


Oh das sehe ich anders. Putin hat quasi selbst best√§tigt das Soldaten ohne Hoheitszeichen auf der Krim sind in dem er sagte es w√§ren 'lokale Selbstverteidigungsgruppen' au√üerdem war mir noch garnicht bewusst das wenn einer das V√∂lkerrecht verletzt es der andere jetzt auch tun darf und ich vorallem nicht kritisieren darf , genauso wie ich es beim ****** Irakkrieg getan hab! Intressante Kindergartenlogik.

Ich werde Quellenbelege liefern, wenn du welche lieferst. H√§ufig genug haben Nachrichtennachplapperer damit n√§mlich Probleme und werden pampig...

&gt; Hast du den Maidan √ºberhaupt verfolgt? Tags√ºber war der Maidan LEER 

Das ist nicht die Beobachtung, die ich gemacht habe... Und w√§re auch unlogisch. Einen *leeren* Platz kann man sperren. 

&gt; Richtig, aber die Wahlen stehen noch bevor.

Also, wenn morgen eine SPD/NPD-gest√ºtzte Gruppe Merkel aus dem Land jagt, dann kannst du mit der NPD gut leben, bis zur n√§chsten Wahl, in der die dann ganz bestimmt nicht in Machtpositionen kommen? 

&gt;  Au√üerdem was bringt die Ukraine denn dem Westen? 

1. Geringere Probleme mit der Gasversorgung (unter Timoschenko hatte die Ukraine f√ºr Deutschland bestimmtes Gas illegalerweise abgezapft...)
2. St√§rkerer Zugang zum Schwarzen Meer, damit auch geopolitisch bessere Unterst√ºtzung zu Georgien (Wir erinnern uns? Abchasien? S√ºd-Ossetien?)
3. Dr√ºcken der Landwirtschaftspreise (Die Ukraine ist eine Kornkammer...)

&gt; aber ansonsten wird der Aufbau einer einigerma√üen gescheiten Wirtschaft ( Die Jankuwitsch und seine reichen Freunde √ºbrigens voll an die Wand gefahren hat) 

Sicher. Aber da hat er nur der guten Julia nachgeeifert. Das politische System des Staatengebildes Ukraine ist korrupt, nicht nur einzelne Vertreter.

&gt;  Au√üerdem findest du jemanden der auf Demonstranten schie√üen l√§sst nicht zweifelhaft?

Ich glaube, da√ü in einem Rechtsstaat der Staat das Gewaltmonopol hat. Werden Gesetze nicht befolgt, dann hat der Staat das Recht und die Pflicht, dieses Gewaltmonopol zur Wiederherstellung von Recht und Ordnung einzusetzen. 

Janukovic wurde demokratisch gew√§hlt und war/ist legitimes Staatsoberhaupt der Ukraine. Es ist seine **Pflicht** gewesen, die illegale Demonstration aufl√∂sen zu lassen.

Nebenbei: Es gibt mehr als einen Hinweis darauf, da√ü die Mehrzahl der Maidan-Toten von Heckensch√ºtzen ausging, die von der Opposition geschickt wurden.

&gt; Man jagt tscheschenische Terroristen nicht mit der Luftwaffe.

Man jagt tschetschenische Terroristen mit jedem Mittel, das in einer Kosten/Nutzen-Analyse am geeignetsten erscheint, die Gef√§hrdung durch selbige Terroristen bei m√∂glichst geringer Gefahr f√ºr die eigenen Leute auszuschalten. Platoons, die durch die kaukasische Steppe streifen, werden aufgerieben. Die MiG und deren Pilot sind in drei Minuten wieder auf Heimatkurs bei deutlich gr√∂√üerer Erfolgsquote.

&gt; Genauso wie man keine 'Schwulenpropaganda' verbietet 

Versuche mal, direkt neben einer Grundschule nen homosexuellen BDSM-Schuppen aufzumachen... Das russische Gesetz schreibt im Wesentlichen nur Bannmeilen vor, nicht un√§hnlich denen, die wir auch haben. 

&gt; und Kremelkritiker einsperrt. 

... wegen Steuerhinterziehung (du wei√üt, wie Hoene√ü) und Aufbau antidemokratischer Gruppierungen (Chodorkowski war dabei, sowas wie eine Chodorkowski-Jugend aufzubauen). Udo Past√∂rs ist ein Bundeskanzleramtskritiker, und der Konsens ist, da√ü er weggesperrt geh√∂rt.

&gt; Und wenn du denkst ich bin pro-USA nope, ich kann einfach nur differenzieren und wei√ü das es kein Gut und B√∂se auf der Welt gibt; Jeder hat Dreck am Stecken siehe z.B Guantamo

Sehr sch√∂n. Selbsterkenntnis ist der erste Schritt. Wieso also verteidigst du so vehement die ""gute"" Ukraine?

&gt; Putin hat quasi selbst best√§tigt das Soldaten ohne Hoheitszeichen auf der Krim sind 

Er hat best√§tigt, da√ü dort milit√§risch organisierte Einheiten sind und offengelassen, wer genau diese kontrolliert. Er hat *nicht* von Soldaten gesprochen.

√úbrigens: Auch [diese Jungs](http://www.karneval.de/img/content/reiterkorps_pg_koeln_web.jpg) sind milit√§risch organisiert und tragen keine international anerkannten Hoheitszeichen...

&gt; au√üerdem war mir noch garnicht bewusst das wenn einer das V√∂lkerrecht verletzt es der andere jetzt auch tun darf! Intressante Kindergartenlogik.

Mein Argument war, da√ü V√∂lkerrecht nicht das Papier wert ist, auf dem es geschrieben wurde, d.h. faktisch nichtexistent ist.

&gt; wieso waren die soldaten dann nicht in ihrer basis ? 

Weil man in der Basis schlecht verhindern kann, da√ü ukrainische Freisch√§rlergruppen die Grenze passieren und ein Massaker an der russischen Bev√∂lkerung im Dorf 40km entfernt anrichten.

&gt; wieso auf flugh√§fen und an der grenzen zum festland?

Relevante Kontrollpunkte, um Truppenaufmarsch und schnelle Verlegung schweren Ger√§ts zu verhindern. Strategie 101.

&gt; Ich denke 'eventuell' ist hier das Schl√ºsselwort. Jaja 'eventuell' hilft es nach 9/11 auch den Irak zu bombadieren. zz

Du w√ºrdest also lieber warten, bis die Gef√§hrdung, die durch die politische Entwicklung der Krimregierung eher noch steigt, realisiert wurde?

Funny what difference reactor technology a few years younger makes.

And this is discounting the fact that common sense should tell you not to build nuclear reactors where there's a large chance of earthquakes and tsunamis, especially not along the coast.

The problem is not the technology. The technology has been quite safe for years (even the biggest earthquake ever recorded in Japan and the following tsunami was only able to cause Fukushima which had technology from the 70s, and it doesn't compare at all to the effect on the environment oil spills and fracking have). The only problems are waste storage (which newer reactor technologies attempt to fix) and that people are afraid of anything with ""atom"" or ""nuclear"" in the name, no matter what it might be, and therefore basically all power plants in service today use technology from the 70s as it's basically impossible to build a new one almost anywhere.",0,1394646474,null,0,1394646727,0,cg0us8l,t3_204ghk,t1_cg0us8l,t1_cg0lqyp,null,1432770091,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The German KMU's (that would be your typical target) that I could think of usually sell to high end niche markets, such as reliable high pressure remote controlled two-way valves. A big part of this business is helping you figure out what valve you need, and getting it to work in your valvulator. or whatever. 

What such a company would *want* is someone who eats high pressure valves for breakfast (figuratively speaking). They usually *settle* for someone who has at least basic understanding of the technology, the existing market and customer needs, and doesn't completely suck at marketing.

Yeah, you're right about oil situation, but also look at TGV, it's a good alternative (in speed and comfort) to air transport and it didn't use oil (in France almost 75% of our electricity come from nuclear power witch is greener than oil (about local polution, not nuclear wastes that are a different problem (and not the point here). So we have a good alternative to air transport that is not dependent of oil!

I don't think that LGV are that much involved in the extinction of smaller train lines... For me, if there wasn't TGV with the comfort and speed we know today, like in so many other countries, the air transport would be more developed instead of train (for long distances)... (So much much oil-dependant and poluting...).
And about smaller train lines, it's not something new with the construction of LGV, it's something that began during the 20th century : for example, at the beginning of the century, around my home in France, many of small towns were connected with a very local small train (called ""tacot""). It was working because they was no other solution to travel from a town to an other town. After, cars and buses appeared and these small train were removed... And during all the 20th century, local trains were removed, far before the choice of building LGV.

Today, the personnal transportation represented by cars and public transportation with buses have the flexibility to do what we do with trains (at the opposite of begining of 20th century). And I don't think that buses and cars will disapear in the future, they will only be adapted to environnemental considerations and the ""end"" of oil we will probably know soon... We will probably produce maybe electrical cars or hydrogen cars... I believe that greener technologies for transportation will come very soon and this type of transport will probably still as it is today, it will only be adapted.

So my opinion is to think that LGV are still a good choice and will ""protect"" us from a transportation that is too much dependant of oil (like air transport).

Some of the quirements are double the tariffs for housing and utilities, dramatically devalue the national currency , minimize budget expenses, cancel government support for the agricultural sector, freeze salaries, pensions, and social allowances. dont forget the high gas prices that will shutdown companies.

&gt;His statement came as Moscow reportedly reinforced its forces in the Ukrainian region of Crimea and held new military exercises. In Crimea, the regional parliament declared independence ahead of a referendum planned for Sunday, when the peninsula's voters are to decide whether they want to join Russia.

----------------------------------------------------------

&gt;The operation will involve about 4,000 troops and 36 planes, said the statement, which didn't specify the location of the exercise.

&gt;Russia has deployed a force of 220,000 troops, 1,800 tanks and over 400 helicopters close to Ukraine's border.

&gt; Du bist also kein Bef√ºrworter des Rechtsstaats?


Du denkst das ein 'legitimer' Pr√§sident auf Demonstranten schie√üen darf? Nope, nicht gerecht. 


&gt; Nun, da w√§re der Augenzeugenbericht der √Ñrztin Olga Bogomolez, der wohl auch von anderen Staatschefs und EU-Funktion√§ren ernst genommen wird.

Das von dir zitierte Video kenne ich nicht. Es gibt aber eine ganze Reihe von Bedingungen, die zu einem solchen Verhalten f√ºhren k√∂nnen (etwa: anders eingesch√§tzter Winkel, sich pl√∂tzlich √§ndernde Windbedingungen, gr√∂√üere Entfernungen...)



Das wusste ich nicht und finde man sollte es ernst nehmen, dann ist das ein Fall f√ºr den-haag und nicht f√ºr ras russische Milit√§r.


&gt;Eigene Leute und Material kosten. Es ist der eigenen Bev√∂lkerung schwer zu vermitteln, wieso die eigenen Jungs im Sack nach Hause kommen, nur um das Leben von mutma√ülichen Terrorismussympathisanten zu sch√ºtzen. Kurz: Leben des GI &gt; Leben des Iraki/Tschetschenen. So denkst du √ºbrigens auch - oder w√ºrdest du deine Frau/Freundin/Freund/Mutter/Vater opfern, um jemanden Fremden zu retten?


Also erstens; Die Tscheschenen d√ºrfen sich nicht abspalten, aber die Russen in der Ukraine d√ºrfen es? Seems fair. 


2. Wer zur Armee geht riskiert sein Leben ganz richtig und bei einem Milit√§reinsatz riskiert die jeweilige Regierung die Leben ihrer 'Jungs'.


3. Du bewertest Leben nach dem Ursprung?Wirklich? Ist ein Afghane also weniger wert als du? 



4. Ich w√§re stolz auf meine Frau/Freundin/Freund/Mutter/Vater wenn sie einen Fremden retten w√ºrden. 
Will ich sie verlieren? Nein. Also was tun? Wie w√§re es wenn die Superm√§chte aufh√∂ren w√ºrden in anderen L√§ndern rumzupfutschen; ein Putsch in Chile hier; ein paar Waffen an Sadam da. 



&gt;Zun√§chst kommt der Drill - danach das Material. Gib den Prinzengardisten Material und Motivation, und bereits morgen w√§re K√∂ln Sperrgebiet.


So? W√ºrde ich die Prinzengarde dann kritisieren weil sie unrechtm√§√üig K√∂ln annektiert hat? Ja!


&gt;Nach der ethnischen S√§uberung post-45 nicht mehr. Nebenbei: das Sudetenland-Beispiel hinkt, weil es von Anfang an nicht um eine Sudetenfrage, sondern um eine Tschecheslowakei-Frage ging. Es gibt keine Hinweise darauf, da√ü Putin mehr als die Krim will



Dann eher Polen? Da hat Hitler doch auch nur die Deutschen verteidigt und dann zur√ºckgeschossen; Genau die selbe Argumentation hatte Putin am Anfang auch.

Aufst√§ndige und Kriminelle.

&gt; Also erstens; Die Tscheschenen d√ºrfen sich nicht abspalten, aber die Russen in der Ukraine d√ºrfen es? Seems fair.

Die Krimrussen haben keine Sprengstoffanschl√§ge in Kiev verursacht - es handelt sich bei den Tschetschenen ganz eindeutig um Terroristen. Unabh√§ngigkeitsbestrebungen der nichtmilitanten Tschetschenen w√ºrde ich unterst√ºtzen (genauso wie ich Berg-Karabach oder Transnistrien unterst√ºtze - oder Taiwan). 

&gt; Wer zur Armee geht riskiert sein Leben ganz richtig und bei einem Milit√§reinsatz riskiert die jeweilige Regierung die Leben ihrer 'Jungs'.

Schlau erkannt. Aber auch dann hat der Fu√üsoldat ein Anrecht darauf, da√ü die milit√§rische F√ºhrung ihn nicht verheizt, wenn es effizientere Wege der Zielerreichung gibt.

&gt; Du bewertest Leben nach dem Ursprung?Wirklich? Ist ein Afghane also weniger wert als du?

Grunds√§tzlich nicht - wenn ich vor der Entscheidung ""der Afghane oder ich"" st√§nde, w√ºrde der Afghane allerdings eher schlecht aussehen. Genauso ""der Afghane oder die folgenden Personen, die mir n√§her stehen"". 

&gt; Wie w√§re es wenn die Superm√§chte aufh√∂ren w√ºrden in anderen L√§ndern rumzupfutschen; ein Putsch in Chile hier; ein paar Waffen an Sadam da.

Du lebst als Sklavenh√§lter in einer Welt, in der dein Wohlstand direkt von solchen Machenschaften der Superm√§chte abh√§ngen. Sei froh, das das gemacht wird. Wie deine Welt auss√§he, wenn dem nicht mehr so w√§re, kannst du in den Slums dieser Welt sehen.

&gt; So? W√ºrde ich die Prinzengarde dann kritisieren weil sie unrechtm√§√üig K√∂ln annektiert hat? Ja!

Na ja ... K√∂ln den K√∂lnern. Wer einmal w√§hrend des Faschings *und* eines gleichzeitig stattfindenden Bundesligaspiels durch den K√∂lner Hauptbahnhof musste, wei√ü, da√ü das tats√§chlich ein ganz spezielles V√∂lkchen ist.

Three of the countries have chosen to join the EU in favor of closer nordic cooperation. The last thing of any importance to regular people that the nordic council did was the passport union in the 1950s, which has been replaced by the EEA and Schengen.

Very few people want nordic cooperation. Denmarks last foreign minister even wanted to abolish the Nordic Council altogether.

Any potential war would be over something like Estonia or Finland; I can't even see us moving for Moldova as long as it's outside Romania. 

That said, to avoid thermonuclear holocaust, any war would also probably be short, limited and decisive. 

And yeah, the Black Sea Fleet is finished. Even if it isn't sunk, as it can't do shit if Turkey closes the Bosporus Straits. And if we do sink it, it won't be through submarines or anything, it'll be through B2s and F-35s, something that can break through the Russian AA defense *(the most advanced in the entire world)*. And even then, we might ignore it and just lock down the Bospherus Strait, sending the B2s and F-35s to go take out the Russian Atlantic Fleet, which is a much larger concern as it could fuck up our entire logistical network *(which Russian submarines will be doing anyway)*. 

An American destroyer is out there now in the Black Sea, but that's for show. If things popped off all the men on that ship are dead; Russia is tracking it and will saturate it with so many missiles it will cease to be an actual object in existence. The whole reason it's there is to *dare* Russia to destroy it, just like when we sent that big-ass defenseless B-52 across China's newly-declared ADIZ. Sure, it'd be blown up easily, but it's a *dare* to blow it up. 

But like I said, any war between two major nuclear powers is going to be short, decisive and limited. Neither want to escalate beyond conventional warfare, and neither want to fight to the point it turns into *""Total War""*, so power projection and expeditionary forces *(like Marines &amp; Paratroopers)* are going to be key *(in my opinion)*. The downside being Europe, while having some of the most well-trained and technologically advanced militaries in the world, lacks power projection and the necessary infrastructure to use it *(global military bases, large blue water navies, large number of refueling tankers and cargo planes)*, and since time is the deciding factor, probably any retaliation will be coordinated between a small, tailored force from the United Kingdom, France and the United States forces instead of a huge, roving NATO army, and even then, there's no time for indecision so you might just see the U.S. or like US/France or US/Britain go it alone if any arguments between them pop-up, as there'd be no time to negotiate and re-align. 

Of course, *all of this* is just my Armchair General opinion and predictions. 

**NOTE:** An the F-35s arn't even in service yet, so it may just fall to our single squadron of B2s for hitting Russia's heavily-defended *(AA-networked)* backyard.

**NOTE2:** And I really do hope war is avoided, for the sake of all the servicemen on both sides, but most importantly for the sake of the innocent civilians who will without a doubt be caught in the cross-fire. :(

Yet almost [unanimously](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ztbsz/the_french_train_company_sncf_has_been_told_it/) people were talking about what bullshit it was local politicians were blocking a bid from a French company to build high speed rail in the US at the request of Holocaust survivors (they transported prisoners to concentration camps). 

My friend's grandma lived in a concentration camp and watched Nazis shoot her newborn sister to death. 

I fail to see how at a local level this type of thinking is abhorrent and stupid, but at a national level it seems to be defended fairly often. 

I am not saying this is you, but it seems very prevalent on this sub. People constantly talk about how the war took a toll on Germany (which undoubtedly it did) and that 70 years is not long enough to get over it. But as soon as Holocaust survivors try to block projects by companies that collaborated with Nazis they're seen as money hungry and irrational. Many of them dont want reparations at all (my friend's grandma doesnt) she just doesn't want them involved in public projects where she lives. 

Even my best friend thinks its ""fucking ridiculous"" how his grandma thinks. I think it is ridiculous as well. But we are lucky enough to never have been rounded up from our homes, shipped like cattle to a place where many of our family members were systematically murdered.

I think it'd be more like what we saw happened in Crimea. You move and you seize before the other guy can even react. If it works, you have the entire territory and the other guy either has to accept it or mobilize for *""Total War""*. 

It sucks for Ukraine because it has no hope of winning a conventional war against Russia, it sucks for us because nobody has any hope of winning a thermonuclear war. 

So, let's say for example: Russia invades Estonia. I believe, in my opinion, that the fate of Estonia will be determined by who wins the opening battle *(for the country)*. Estonia's fate will depend on how fast the United States/NATO can get Marines and Paratroopers into there while *it's still contested*. Even if it means driving a Carrier Taskforce through a Russian submarine-infested Baltic Sea, because, once again I must emphasis *this is my armchair general opinion*, if Estonia falls completely *(to whomever wins the battle)*, than the country/alliance who loses it is not going to take it back *(or get the chance to take it back, so they'll willingly accept defeat, so as to avoid nuclear escalation...hopefully)*. 

Neither Russia nor the West *(alright....MAYBE Russia....crazy bastards...but for this argument we'll say they won't)* will not want to go nuclear or conduct a first-strike over Estonia. An if either of us do mobilize for conventional total war over Estonia, I highly doubt we'll actually conduct total war *(I.E. Huge NATO armies advancing across massive swathes of Europe against similar sized and positioned Russian armies)*, as I can honestly see no way which that doesn't escalate into thermonuclear warfare....which I don't think anybody wants. 

So, in my opinion, there won't be long, drawn out massive wars *(which in this day and age, are all but guaranteed to end in nuclear holocaust, as I pointed out above)*, but rather short, limited and decisive wars, so as to avoid nuclear escalation. 

This is the same military doctrine which China has applied to any potential conflict in the South China Sea involving the many territorial disputes it has with it's neighbors in the region, many of whom, like NATO, possess mutual defense pacts with the United States. 

And this is why power projection and fast reaction forces *(I.E. Paratroopers &amp; Marines)* are, in my opinion, probably the most important deciding factors in modern day warfare.

Of course....this is the same logic that the German Empire used in WWI and the Japanese Empire used in WWII....both of which inevitably ended up as ""Total War"" scenarios...but fuck....I think the point still stands, given that the introduction of nuclear weapons has completely reshaped the game as we know it; Although....using the same strategy as the two countries which started....*and lost*.....the first two world wars doesn't bode well for this *(hypothetical)* war and it's chances of not snowballing into WWIII.....but I really don't see many other options in which two nuclear-armed states/alliances can go to war and avoid nuclear escalation...so it's literally the only workable scenario which doesn't end in nuclear holocaust.

Willst Du etwa leugnen, dass Rassenantisemitismus vor und w√§hrend der Shoah an Universit√§ten nicht verbreitet war, und dass diese Tatsache in keiner Weise als legitimatorisches Moment bei dessen Durchf√ºhrung von integraler Bedeutung war?

Der Anstrich von Wissenschaftlichkeit war in der Moderne bei jeder wie auch immer gearteten Bewegung begehrt.  Dass es diesmal nicht um die Ausrottung der Juden, sondern um die Zurichtung von Sprache geht, ist dabei nebens√§chlich.  Was z√§hlt, ist der dabei wirksame Mechanismus.

Weil die Mitglieder und K√∂pfe solcher Bewegungen felsenfest davon √ºberzeugt sind, dass die Tilgung vermeintlicher geschlechtsspezifischer Unterschiede in der Sprache eine notwendige Voraussetzung f√ºr die Herbeif√ºhrung einer emanzipierten Gesellschaft ist.  Sie glauben, dass wenn die Frauen (oder wer auch immer) erst in der Sprache erfolgreich gleichgestellt sind, dass die Gleichstellung in der Realit√§t sich dann gleichsam wie von selbst einstellen wird.

I would suggest the Mobilis, which is the unlimited day pass, or the Navigo Decouverte.  Here's the math breakdown..

Navigo Decouverte - 5‚Ç¨ for photo plus 5‚Ç¨ for pass plus 34‚Ç¨ for the week, 44‚Ç¨ total (39‚Ç¨ if you bring a photo)

Mobilis - 7‚Ç¨ per day for the four days you stay in the city, 16‚Ç¨ for the one day you go out to Zone 5.  44‚Ç¨ total

The Mobilis works on all public transport and is good for the calendar day you purchase it.  The downside is that you can't buy them in advance so you'll have to go to a station and purchase one every day.  Not a big deal but it may be worth it to you to take the extra time on your first day to get the Decouverte so you don't have to deal with it.

For the Navigo Decouverte you'll either need to get a photo at the Photomaton machines in most Metro stations (5‚Ç¨) or bring some passport-style photos with you.  You'll have to go to one of the ticket windows and pay them 5‚Ç¨ to get your card made and then load it up for a week.

However, **BIG warning** - the Navigo ""week"" runs Monday through Sunday.  If you arrive on a Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, you'll end up having to purchase a second week (or an extra day pass), greatly increasing the price.  Only go for the Decouverte if your 5 day stay begins on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.  Otherwise the daily Mobilis is much cheaper.

Edit:  Also, the tickets are magnetized, so if you do go with the Mobilis, make sure to keep it in its own pocket away from coins, credit cards, keys, anything metal or magnetic.  I see so many tourists at the stations pulling metro tickets out of their wallets and wondering why they don't work anymore.",0,1394656229,null,0,1394656964,0,cg0zx9d,t3_2090g4,t1_cg0zx9d,t3_2090g4,null,1432772576,3,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,3

They could be using a language which is only spoken by 1% of the population, and it wouldn't matter for most people because anything he says would be translated into all the other languages being used in the EU. Yes, translation might cause a minor time delay which could be avoided by having everyone speak English, but really, how often are people in a position where they need to *immediately* know exactly what a government official is saying?

The only people who would be affected by making English (or any language) an official language would be the upper level government officials when they talk to each other in real time. Even then though, if they're actually doing their jobs and talking about important political matters, accuracy is probably more important than the convenience of a *lingua franka*, so using their native language might still be a better option. 

Besides, the anglosphere already gets a lot of flack about having a dominating global presence, and the EU gets a lot of flack about being detached from ""real"" European citizens.

Quando ero all'uni facevo il volontario all'ESN, un'associazione di studenti erasmus. Quando non organizzavamo feste alcoliche, predisponevamo delle guide pratiche per gli studenti in arrivo. Anche Lille ha ESN: http://www.esnlille.fr/ - se il sito non fosse lento marcio, ci avrei fatto un giro per vedere se c'era qualcosa. Prova pure a contattarli, ma non ci contare molto, sono studenti volontari e a noi giovani trentenni lavoratori potrebbero cagarci poco

--------------

Cerca queste keyword su google ""**erasmus france bank account residence crazy**"", senza virgolette. La parola ""crazy"" sta l√¨ per far saltare fuori testimonianze informali di qualcuno che magari sar√† stato in situazioni simili alle tue. Non ho approfondito, ma la prima pagina di risultati non sembra male.

Cercando invece ""**proof of residence france**"" ho trovato [un forum di expat](http://www.expatforum.com/expats/france-expat-forum-expats-living-france/118653-proof-residence-proof-address.html) in cui uno scrive:

&gt; For what purpose do you need the proof of residence? [...] If it's to open a bank account in France, you use what you've got, even if it's temporary, and you change your address with the bank as soon as you've moved into your more permanent digs.

Con le stesse parole chiave ho trovato anche http://www.readyforfrance.com/ , che tra l'altro √® un sito fatto dalla banca HSBC, proverei a vedere se hanno scritto qualcosa.

&gt;Sometimes being a world leader means you have to make unpopular decisions. This was shown by Germany's handling of Greece. No matter what it did it would be criticized. 

&gt;All world leaders face this. The US and UK are constantly called imperialists. US presidents are [always compared to Nazis](https://www.google.com/search?q=obama+nazi&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u3wVU5zyPMmgqgG5r4CQBg&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667), this is nothing new. Given their imperial past the Brits or French dont have it much easier (although I will say on reddit they do). In fact, up until the last couple weeks many saw US troops in Europe as imperialist, and still do. Some have oddly changed their opinion as of late. 

&gt;People constantly deride the US for intervening in international affairs. Then they deride them for not getting involved when things get ugly. Syria is a perfect example of this. If the US got involved it would be directly guilty of child murder, by abstaining its vicariously guilty of child murder. 

&gt;If Germany wants to take a back seat to international affairs, it can forego difficult decisions. But given the turmoil in the EU it seems Germany is getting more and more involved not just in the EU but globally. Either Germany can step up and make tough decisions or back off and let its allies essentially guide its foreign policy (mostly through the EU). But if it gets bent out of shape every time there is a Nazi reference by an obscure group of people, I think the backseat option is already fairly cemented in place.

i bet the reason russians invaded was more because of what happened in the rest of ukraine before/during maidan, rather than what happened in ukraine at maidan was because later russia was soon to invade (see that logic?).


Reddit has turned into a big Fox News-esque community where anything anti-rus, with literally zero fact checks or reality checks,gets  upboated to infiniti and anyone actually asking if that is the case gets destroyed totally, what happened to rationality on reddit or at least a little bit of scepticism? i was merely pointing out that shit was going down in ukraine before russia invaded, not after they invaded as cyridius CLEARLY wrote.

im totally against what russia is doing, however if how people behave on reddit reflect how people think in ukraine then honestly, Russia can have that piece of dirtywater europe, or at least divide it so they dont destroy themselves. There is literally no difference between warmongering american Right and reddit right now, so few rational arguments or suggestions on how to solve this conflict.

Especially since it doesn't have nuclear weapons up it's sleeve *(which means even if they did manage to, which is the slimmest fucking chance in the world, take back Crimea from Russia, they wouldn't of had the nuclear trump card to stop Russia from immediately launching a 2nd Offensive.)*. 

**Hell, Ukraine is fucked if Russia invades in general.** 

The only thing Ukraine can do in such a scenario is go *""Total War""* and shit like Finland in 1939, but given the terrain and Russian sympathies in Eastern Ukraine/Crimea, there's no chance it hell they'll win. 

Even Finland lost the Winter War and had to give up some pretty strategic and valuable territory. 

So, Ukraine's choices, *in my personal armchair opinion are*: 

*A.* Do as good as Finland, but lose Eastern Ukraine, Crimea, and possibly portions of Western Ukraine. Then try to pull a *""Vietnam""* with West Ukraine resembling North Vietnam, with partisans chipping away at Russia in Crimea/Eastern Ukraine. 

*B.* Do worse than Finland, lose the entire country, but hope they can do as good as the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan and make the occupation too costly. 

So yeah, as I mentioned numerous times before, Ukraine is fucked completely against Russia. It's either the country being torn in half and a decade or more of well-coordinated guerrilla warfare against Russia *(best-case scenario)*, or the entire country being occupied and a decade or more of loosely-coordinated guerrilla warfare against Russia *(worst-case scenario)*. 

The most it can hope for is cutting it's losses now with Crimea. And that depends on two things: Russia's goodwill and America's willingness to defend them. And, at the moment, it doesn't look like America has *any intention* of moving militarily against Russia for Ukraine, so it really all depends on Russia's goodwill and whether they decide to invade or not. Because if they invade, Ukraine is in for a real shitty, shitty time for the next decade or two; and if they lose? Well then, they could be in for a real shitty time for the next century *(than again, maybe Russia might be good to Ukraine this time in contrast to the past couple centuries? Though I don't think many Ukranians are going to go for that)*.

true,Seefor,DENK,Copenhagen,"Yes, which is why a Nordic Union probably won't happen until that is resolved. And it is a rather unrealistic scenario that Denmark, Sweden and Finland would leave the EU for that to happen, and I would personally certainly not be glad to see that happen, since I fully believe that our place is in Europe. The more realistic scenario is that Norway joins the EU sometime in the future. Then our international commitments would be in line to make a Nordic Union within the EU possible.

Anyhow, I am not completely convinced as to the virtues of a Nordic Union. Yes, we would have more weight, but on the other hand we'd also lose our separate council votes and we'd lose the ability to lobby for legislation, which fits our specific situation as a country better, since there are still differences between the Nordic nations - especially when it comes to resources. And as a NATO country there are no tangible security guarantees to be gained, which we don't already have.

I think a better alternative, which we could also do without Norway, would be an increased formal cooperation between the Nordic EU countries in which agreements are made to lobby jointly on the issues where agreement between the Nordic countries can be reached. The existing [Nordic Council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Council) would have to be strengthened and the Nordic ministers should meet quite often, and especially before EU council meetings, and work to reach a common policy.

true,sayheykid24,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; For instance, Baltic nations should never have been admitted. 

Baltic countries were admitted for geopolitical reasons- to put pressure on Russia, and help cement liberal democracy in those countries. No one has ever been under the illusion that they would be able to help out much in a war, and the fact that they don't pay their full dues is not a major concern. NATO was founded as- and remains- a military coalition meant to contain Russian aggression. We want to be crawling all over their borders. 

&gt;Is it worth worsening our relationship with Russia over a handful small border states?

Absolutely. Russia is bullying its neighbors into joining their Eurasian Union, and threatening destabilization on the periphery of the Europe Union. Russia is again attempting to create an alternative system to the liberal international order, and this time it's a much more conservative and cynical vision. [Some have gone so far as to call it neo-feudal.](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ae0b33ea-8761-11e3-9c5c-00144feab7de.html#axzz2vlcloTLY)  

With each additional NATO member the West draws a line in the sand that Russia does not dare cross. Who cares if they don't like it? They can either play ball in accordance with the international system they're now part of, or face isolation and economic ruin like the Soviet Union.

Let's assume you open a small business and generate a profit of 100000 EUR. You will only keep 52131 EUR. That's a taxation rate of nearly 50%. It will rise over 50% once you start spending that money on your daily necessities (19% VAT, property tax, etc.). I don't know how it sounds to you but to me working for the state is not really my idea of economic freedom.

My personal pain level where I start to find (income) taxes unfair is above 30%.

Luckily there's quite a few countries in the EU that have implemented a flat tax of around 20%. (Which doesn't only save money but also a lot of time when doing taxes. You don't need to move earnings into the next year to not scratch at some progression level that would cost you too much. You just know: You always will pay 20% taxes.)

* Wettbewerbsf√§higkeit ist im TTIP das dominierende Ziel. Andere Werte wie soziale und √∂kologische Standards werden sich unterordnen m√ºssen. Damit g√§ben wir viele Errungenschaften der Umwelt- und Verbraucherschutzpolitik der letzten Jahrzehnte auf.
* Investitionsschutz bedeutet im Klartext neue au√üergerichtliche Klagem√∂glichkeiten f√ºr internationale Unternehmen gegen √∂ffentliches Handeln. 
* Die Verbraucherschutzstandards f√ºr Lebensmittel sind in Europa (zurecht) strenger als in den USA. Sollten in einem Handelsabkommen die Sicherheitsstandards der USA anerkannt werden, w√§re dieser Schutz weg.
* Das TTIP w√§re de facto unumkehrbar: Einmal unterzeichnet, k√∂nnen die B√ºndnispartner (also die Staaten) nur mit der Zustimmung aller Vertragsparteien wieder aus dem B√ºndnis aussteigen. 
* Die Verhandlungen zum TTIP unterliegen der Geheimhaltung. Das Mandat der Verhandlungspartner ist weder √∂ffentlich, noch durch das Europaparlament demokratisch legitimiert.

This is an idea that will only invite disaster. 

&gt;Russia is bullying its neighbors into joining their Eurasian Union, and threatening destabilization on the periphery of the Europe Union. Russia is again attempting to create an alternative system to the liberal international order, and this time it's a much more conservative and cynical vision.

This is one interpretation of Russian intentions. I think it would be wise to pay attention to the Russian interpretation as well. By swallowing up the nations on its borders, we are forcing Russia to react. This is the epitome of foolishness. The West says we are bringing those nations into our fold to protect them from Russia. Russia sees things very differently. We shouldn't needlessly antagonize Russia over some seemingly insignificant nations. 

&gt;With each additional NATO member the West draws a line in the sand that Russia does not dare cross. Who cares if they don't like it? They can either play ball in accordance with the international system they're now part of, or face isolation and economic ruin like the Soviet Union.

true,CurtHoliday352,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;I'm sorry, but that is complete bullshit. Russia doesn't want Ucraine to be Russia, it wants Ucraine to be a buffer between it and the western countries. It wants to look strong. Ukraine has no chance in direct warfare with Russia, but there's a whole slew of problems arising from Russia attacking Ukraine, international treaties kicking into place and the various interests of other countries in the area.

No, it's not complete bullshit. I'm not saying Russia *will* invade, but I am saying it is a *very real* possibility. 

And I never said Russia wants Ukraine *in* Russia, but I do contend that Russia needs Ukraine *in* the Eurasian Union if it's actually going to become a viable, influential and competitive institution *(Instead of CIS.2)*.

I think you underestimate just how important Ukraine is to Russia's sphere-of-influence. Let me put it like this, if Russia doesn't convince Ukraine to join the Eurasian Union, it ain't shit in the coming world. We're going into a *""Asian Century""*, as many have dubbed it, a multi-polar world, dominated by the United States, the European Union *(possibly if it integrates)*, Russia *(possibly if it's Eurasian Union gets off the ground)* and China, with Brazil, India and possibly South Africa coming up from behind. 

Russia just doesn't **want** Ukraine, it **needs** Ukraine. It's need's it's economic strength, it population, if it wants to compete with other global great powers in the future. Kazakhstan and Belarus arn't going to be able to carry Russia to greatness alone, and don't think for a second Russia doesn't realize this, hence why they're pushing so hard to influence Ukraine. 

&gt;Also, Ukraine has a population of around 45 million. Georgia was 4.5 million, Finland is in the same area. Ukraine is 10 times as big. It is a big country and it is not possible for Russia to seize it by force and keep it so. Russia wouldn't even want that. They only want it under their control. 

With half the country possibly vulnerable to Russian agents working with local opposition, and half the population possibly passive about any Russian intervention *(hell, who says that up to a 1/10th of the population won't actually support it?)*. 

And you act like it's a impossibility....but ugh....[maybe you should read this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Ukraine). This wouldn't be the first time Russia has invaded and occupied Ukraine, since **the last time Russia stayed for 220 years**.

&gt;No, your fantasies of all-out warfare will not come to life, I'm sorry. Russia will rig the referendum(yes they will rig them, because who in their right mind would want to be a part of Russia, really now) and keep Crimeea as a part of Russia - Crimeea never should have left Russia in the first place. Ukraine will have payed for its independence from Moscow with a piece of it. It will somehow learn to live with a spiteful neighbor and hopefully not fall pray to nationalists and rusofobia. Russia will get international sanctions. 

Crimea didn't leave Russia, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine. And it's funny, because Ukraine was apart of Russia for half-a-century longer than Crimea was apart of Russia, since Russia had conquered it from Turkey. 

And *stop putting words in my mouth*. **I don't want no fucking war**, I don't even want sanctions, but I'm not stupid enough to think neither is a possibility nor a necessity, respectfully, at times. The ones that suffer the most are the innocent civilians on both sides, not the soldiers fighting the war or the politicians directing it. In wars, entire houses with families in them can be misidentified and blown-up, kids can be hit by a stray bullet on the way to school; in peace, economic sanctions can lead to you loosing everything you own, to being unable to acquire or afford medicine for your daughter or mother which they desperately need *(because you can't cut off a government's revenue stream without crippling an economy, and you can't cripple a economy without disenfranchising the population)*. 

It's fucked up, and it shouldn't happen, but it happens for a reason, and at times those reasons are justified and necessary in international relations. Simple as that. It's fucked up, but at times it's needed.

&gt;No other country on this green earth will ever relinquish their nuclear weapons.

""Included in an eco-design approach, the use of these materials in the automotive industry continues to grow. Their industry is also installed until Thursday at the Porte de Versailles, under the JEC 2014 in an attempt to keep the momentum going.
Flax and hemp keep living
While some are endeavoring to develop environment-friendly engines, others strive to develop healthier interiors, lighter and less dependent on oil resources. To do this, some players in the automotive industry are now confident to new eco-friendly materials such as flax and hemp. At Faurecia, for example, mixing it with petroleum components (NAFILean) now reduces the weight of parts from 20 to 25%.

As will be held from March 11 to 13 next to the Porte de Versailles the new edition of the JEC, the international exhibition for composites, the European Confederation of Flax and Hemp (CELC) take this event to highlight this sector, including any evolution in research and development, with the industrial sector. And to seduce them, CELC launch this occasion a harmonized template sheets for preforms in order to deliver professional reliable data, as measured by standard methods.

In parallel, the Confederation and the JEC organized for the first time a visitor path ""Meet the actors of flax and hemp."" Wednesday between 2:15 p.m. 1:15 p.m. ET, visitors visit the booth D78 7.2 to meet the various players in the industry, but also to discover the bio-based solutions.""",0,1394667649,null,0,false,0,cg15mnm,t3_209wdu,t1_cg15mnm,t3_209wdu,null,1432775265,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
