&gt;You should learn your history because this was exactly the other way around.

Because New Spain/Mexico didn't hold many territories in that region from the 15th century to the 19th century? 

Also....**based on this logic**.....Russia sending troops into Eastern Ukraine wouldn't be a invasion either....because of it's shared history with the Kieven Rus or it's incorporation into the Russian Empire/Soviet Union for two-hundred years?

In the meantime heres some video of the false flag operation in action, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uAIRRT4q6U note the very detailed approach to uniforms and acquiring military weapons when most weapons in the Ukraine are shotguns.

true,specofdust,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Oh absolutely, the combined expenditure of UK and FR is about 33% larger than Russia, but what does that get you?

A British rifleman costs about £18,000 a year in pay. A Russian one costs about £4000. Eurofighters might be a moderate amount better than a Su-27, but they cost 6 time the price. Russia subsidises it's military industry and gets a hell of a lot for the money, plus they have a lot of useful stuff left over from the soviet days.

&gt; Not to mention perhaps we have more professional and technologically advanced army? Considering French and British military cooperation, that should do.

Right, this is true, *we* do. That is, the UK and France, most other Euro nations do not. We are 45% of the military budget. Most of the rest is, imo, essentially wasted. The problem is that the nascent EU military right now is almost entirely Britain and France, and that just won't work. Yes, there are some smaller nations which actually do defense right (NL are a relatively good example of a small country which still tries to not be a joke) but a lot of nations have a military purely because, well, they feel they have to. The Irish defence forces are pointless, they shouldn't exist, they couldn't do anything to anyone and the Irish people are essentially just funding arms companies and paying for soldiers to have a job doing...whatever the fuck you do with a military you're never ever going to use. Now, in an ideal world we'd have an EU military and Ireland would just give money to the central pot and that would be that.

Currently though, the EU is too young, the countries too different, the goals for what militaries should be able to achieve too diverse, and the spending varies from 0.47% of GDP (Luxembourg, I assume they just use it to buy a uniform and give their 7 men sticks to fight with) to the UK (of course) at 2.5%, which is still paltry compared to most countries and is below the world average.

I'm logged into the O2 site trying to figure out kontostand as we speak, and I will not stop until I will figure out how much we have been paying them since we made the contract and for what. 

There is not a chance that O2 are doing anything against the law when they use nasty tricks to send me 110 euro bill. A part of this 110E month was a really nasty move, we were supposed to pay something around 40 euros to O2. So me and my friend went to the bank and since I didn't have my card we used his, this was I think the first time that I did uberweisung by myself. I had no idea that you had to put your O2 ID number (I didn't even know I had one) in the line where you say what this transaction regards I just wrote ,,internet for blahstrasse 666"".

When we came home my German friend who had the bank account just called O2 and they found the payment in like 2 seconds and opened the internet again in like an hour. Around 2 days later the internet was closed again, we spent many hours during few days trying to find out why the internet was closed since we just payed the bill. O2 staff didn't understand anything either, many days later we were told that my friend who had the card I used to pay the bill was in some debt at O2 and since I wrote my street name, number and what this was for instead of this O2 ID. They took the money and put it in his old debt. Doing stuff like this isn't illigal but if this isn't stealing then I don't know what that word means.

Ok I take your word for it 1&amp;1 is off the list.

Well, I guess I will just continue with O2, I just declare war on their nasty tricks and will figure out how to never ever pay one cent more then 24.99 per month. Few months ago I just started in the beginning of the month at the same time when I pay the rent to pay 25 euros to O2.

Large numbers of one or another group is not why I am willing to trust German data. The reasons are: it was not propaganda, because it wasn't made public at the time. Germans were nationalistic, but their nationalism didn't touch this particular area, there was no push to invent a German minority there, or to annex the place. They wanted to create a chain of puppet states from Brest-Litovsk gains, and for that it would be useful to see what exactly was the situation there, which is why they conducted a census - it was for internal use by the Wilhelmine government and military.

EDIT:
Point of the map is to illustrate how easily the Finns could have closed off Leningrad completely and advanced across the northern hemisphere to give respite to Wehrmacht troops with a safe border, conquer Murmansk and largely stop any hopes of USSR receiving allied shipments directly to the European theater.


There would have been nothing to stop them at that point, yet they chose not to do that for several reasons, one of which was Finland had no expansive agenda, as well as Mannerheim was skeptical of Hitler just as he was of Stalin and trusted neither, so Finland opted for the sensible way out.

Invoking the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), an international agreement that provides multilateral framework for energy deals, the company is demanding damages totaling €3.7 billion.      
    
This discussion goes to the heart of the issue of sovereignty, and whether countries are allowed to do things for the public good, even at the detriment of private interests of a few.

So using the relative unemployment rates of Germany and US is rather irrelevant to the issue discussed. And awkwardly for his argument, the US has a higher labor participation rate.

I support his thesis though. Maybe it's just a case where the argument has a hard time 'fitting to print'. Obviously people who drop out of the labor market often start out as merely unemployed. The argument would've been better without bringing up US disability insurance - there's good reasons to want to lower unemployment that has nothing to do with supposed malingering.

Poland is sandwiched between West (be it France or Germany) and East. West seems to be secure now, so Poles focus on the East. Hence the flurry of Sikorski activity. Poland is concerned about image they project, so all these attempts to mitigate/destroy treat from the East are infused with politically acceptable mission.

true,DivideEtImpera8,ITAL,Italy,"Wow dude it would appear you have figured out all the West's propaganda, lies and ideas.

I guess it's time to admit the truth, huh my Western kamerads? Time to put the cars on the table.

The EU was formed by the pure blooded Aryan nations of France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Netherlands and our overlords-the Germans. Since we learned from our past mistake-WW2- we have decided that glorious, proud culture of the Slavs can not be defeated through firearms. So we waged economic war on you. The Brits, too proud at first, also joined at the idea of an overall Aryan colonial superiority.

Since then we have waged our politics of total, utter devastation on what we consider inferior nations. First we started with the Mediterraneans. The Spanish and Greeks will be first ones to fall. Meanwhile Italy is also torturing and destroying it's Mediterranean population to the South. Other Aryan nations like Sweden and Finland have joined our cause to rid the world of everyone.

Of course our urge for blood is fueled by searing hate. We have started destroying our nemesis-the Slavs. We started with the Slavs of Central Europe. I mean look at how their life has worsened since they left the glorious Soviet Union's sphere of influence. They were rich and awesome and now we're making their countries worse. The we stroke at the South Slavs. Centuries ago we destroyed the Slavic culture of Romania. Now Bulgaria and Croatia are our next victims. These Slavs will fall before us. We started Ukraine to stop their brotherhood with Russia. Beware Slavs. Don't try to hide in [your holes under ground](http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0), sooner or later we'll throw you right out.

Just like our God and eternal leader Hitler said, we will destroy you, we will end you. No more will your impure blood be on Earth. But first we will destroy you economically and culturally. And then, when your soul is weakened, we strike physically. Of course, just like last time, Russia has shown it's self hard to destroy. Only you, Russia, bring democracy and goodness. But we will destroy all good in the world.

But you think that's where we stop? Our overseas allies, the Americans, are destroying the Middle East. France has started the destruction of Africa. Soon we will strike. Muahahaha. Then the Asians, until we secure our absolute domination of the world.

And we would have succeeded if it weren't for you, /u/BabyWookie. You figured our plan for Aryan dominance. Now we have to call in the secret all-Aryan club, where of course, ever single person participates and we plan the total devastation of everyone.

Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!

And furthermore appeasing the main opposition elements in Russia in order to avoid any significant organised opposition in the first place; by appeasing the LDPR (far-right) by making symbolic moves against migrant workers around Russia and appeasing the Communists though geopolitical grandstanding against the US. 

The problem, of course, is that each of these factions will gradually ask for more. The Orthodox Church will not be completely appeased until homosexuality is criminalised altogether. Russian nationalists will not be appeased until migrants are actively deported and minorities suppressed. And old-guard communists will not be appeased until they see Russia rid of what they perceive as ""Western influences"" and Stalinism not merely celebrated in history books but practised at present. And such concessions cannot be made since the United Russia party depends on mass electoral support that perceive the party as *Moderate*.

true,[deleted],null,null,"This is really the biggest flaw in the US. Our education systen is abysmal, starting with high school/middle school.

My old high school used to offer honors courses which were harder than the regular ones, weighted more, and you have to have certain grades and teacher recommendations to get into. Then they got rid of it - and their reasoning was that it ""wasn't fair"" to give some kids an unfair advantage. I went to a very economically diverse school. It was mostly middle class, but we had several kids who didn't always have running water at home, and kids who lived in multimillion dollar homes with live in help. Meaning.. we had a large portion of kids who didn't give a shit about school and would fuck around and disrupt class.

Once they got rid of the honors classes we were left with regular (regents) and AP (college level). The AP classes were really challenging and required tons of time and money (you had to pay for the AP exam at the end of the year or in some cases pay for the class itself if it was taught through a local university). So kids who would have done well in the honors courses either had to choose to go struggle in AP or would have had to go down to regents with mainly uncontrollable students (we had police officers and drug dogs in my school, and daily fights and even occasionally weapons such as knives and once a gun) which severely affected their learning.

The whole ""teach everyone the same thing"" idea just doesn't work. Some people don't want to go to university, and a lot shouldn't. Trade skills and training is greatly underappreciated in the US. And there's the problem that unions are often very exclusive and if you're trying to find work in a union area without being in the union you are locked out and can't get any work.

Don't even get me started about the higher education either. I'm graduating this winter with well over $150,000 in debt, and I will probably have to pay that off for the rest of my life.

Questo è il punto, è **fondamentale** verificare l'identità, ma l'utente poco esperto può essere ingannato.
L'ideale è incontrare l'interlocutore di persona e scambiarsi il fingerprint della chiave. Altri mezzi che certificano l'identità hanno vari livelli di affidabilità, che l'utente dovrebbe valutare ogni volta. In più dovrebbe valutare il suo livello di fiducia nei vari soggetti che firmano le chiavi.

Per l'utente medio è l'inferno.

Il destinatario con cui parli potrebbe non essere il destinatario. Reddit usa HTTP di default e bisogna usare un trucco per usare HTTPS. È facile rubare l'identità di un utente reddit appena compie un passo falso.

true,Mugros,,Niedersachsen,"&gt; There is not a chance that O2 are doing anything against the law when they use nasty tricks to send me 110 euro bill. A part of this 110E month was a really nasty move, we were supposed to pay something around 40 euros to O2. So me and my friend went to the bank and since I didn't have my card we used his, this was I think the first time that I did uberweisung by myself. I had no idea that you had to put your O2 ID number (I didn't even know I had one) in the line where you say what this transaction regards I just wrote ,,internet for blahstrasse 666"".

Sorry, but that sounds very naive. Your account number is on every paper you get from O2. You don't have to be a genius to know that you have to tell a company in a bullet proof way how to assign a payment to your account and that is the account number. Depending on the size of the house, many people might have the same provider. Just writing the address isn't good enough for this obvious reason. They will certainly have an automated system that assigns money transfers to accounts, so by not sticking to the system, you will create problems or delays.  
What's even more puzzling is that you say that you had your German friend with you and used his card. Later you say, that he did/does business with O2 too. So, how did he not advice you to put your account number in the Verwendungszweck line?
Your inexperience with Überweisungen is barely O2's fault. It's a common way to pay bills in Germany and you have to get used to it. It's also not very hard. It's not harder than sending an Email and most companies send you templates where you only have to fill out your bank account details.

&gt; When we came home my German friend who had the bank account just called O2 and they found the payment in like 2 seconds and opened the internet again in like an hour. Around 2 days later the internet was closed again, we spent many hours during few days trying to find out why the internet was closed since we just payed the bill. O2 staff didn't understand anything either, many days later we were told that my friend who had the card I used to pay the bill was in some debt at O2 and since I wrote my street name, number and what this was for instead of this O2 ID. They took the money and put it in his old debt. Doing stuff like this isn't illigal but if this isn't stealing then I don't know what that word means.

And that is the result. Your address could not be used to assign the payment to a specific account, so they used the sending bank account to assign the money.  
Well, your friend doesn't seem to know how to properly pay his bills either when he is in debt to O2. 

That said, just last month I helped an English speaker paying his bills for an O2 mobile plan. He didn't have the money in his account for the automated payment to go through. He had to transfer money manually. Which he did but very late, just before the next payment was due. This stalled the automated payment again, so he had to again pay manually. Overall it was entirely his fault that they cut off his mobile internet. O2 send really clear emails what happened and what he has to pay, but he more or less ignored it.",0,1394965423,null,0,false,0,cg3v85r,t3_20ijjs,t1_cg3v85r,t1_cg3ptqr,null,1435550791,7,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,7

&gt;The English website of Pravda carries a fairly inflammatory coloumn in which it describes Angela Merkel as the whore of Washington.

&gt;Washington, enabled by its compliant but stupid NATO puppets, is pushing the Ukrainian situation closer to war.

&gt;German Chancellor Merkel has failed her country, Europe, and world peace. Germany is the strength of the EU and NATO. Had Merkel said “No” to sanctions on Russia, that would have been the end of the crisis that Washington is brewing, a crisis unlikely to be ended short of war.

&gt;But Merkel has signed away the sovereignty of the German nation and assigned the fate of Germany to a province in the American Empire. Thus has Merkel and the weak

&gt;German leadership consigned the world to war. Already blamed for World War 1 and World War 2, now Germany will be blamed for World War 3.

There are ways to intervene militarily without creating a war. Both: Russia and US got plenty of experience in fighting wars with other people's hands.

And besides - it's enough that Western banks will stop renewing loans to Russia. If that happens - they'll be on their knees before you notice. Though that's something government can't really enforce on a private banks.

&gt; Trade skills and training is greatly underappreciated in the US.

That's definitely a huge problem. 

As an educational scientist in Germany I am a bit pissed by all the OECD circlejerk about the low percentage of *uni* graduates in Germany. 

We do have an elaborate TVET system, which opens a lot of career paths for those 70%-80% who don't go to university. 

You can take smaller courses (1-10 days) and get a certificate, eg. a license for forklift driving or wielding. And we still have the master craftsmen system established by the guilds some hundred years ago. 

Those trainings are supported during a Kurzarbeit-period and they are well respected. 

Another thing is that German companies are interested in training their staff. If you invest up to 3.5 years into a trainee to train him to become a skilled labour, you don't hire and fire them like it is more common in the US. And if you have trained one to become a master craftsmen, you invested even more.

Well, you are lucky: there are plenty of blissfully bureaucracy-free places in the world. Somalia and some parts of Pakistan come to mind...

&gt; I don't remember voting for Merkel. Or against her for that matter. And yet there she is, sitting in the Council.

I don't see your point. If you aren't German, I must point out that, in your own country, there are normally plenty of representatives in your parliaments from constituencies other than your own. If you are German, I must note that you must have indirectly voted for (or against) her, and not even the President of the US is in fact directly elected (he is elected through an electoral college).

&gt; But besides that, actually there is a smoky room in Brussels filled with bureaucrats. Its called the European Commission. And they are the ones currently in charge of EU ETS, among other things. Like deciding minimum banana sizes or banning oil jugs.

Well, first of all, I must point out that I'm pretty sure that all EC buildings these days are smoke-free. More to the point, the Commission most certainly doesn't *decide* minimum banana sizes or *bans* oil jugs. If you look at the title of any EU legislation, that is, any regulation or directive, you'll read ""...of the Council"" or even ""...of the Council and Parliament"". While the Commission *proposes* legislation, it must be passed (usually in heavily amended form) by the European Council and increasingly also by the European Parliament. And that's far from being a mere rubber stamp: the ""oil jug ban"" is a typical example thereof.

The ban on refillable oil jugs in restaurants was floated by the Commission (I'm not even sure it was in a formal draft) as a consumer protection measure. It was strongly backed by olive-oil-producing countries, which saw it as a way to ensure that restaurants across the EU served (their) olive oil, rather than filling those jugs with cooking oil of uncertain nature and origin. After the public outcry (in non-olive-oil-producing countries) the Commission swiftly withdrew the proposal as it became evident that the measure would not be passed by the Council.

Instead, at least Spain is considering its introduction in national legislation. Of course, the fact that it is the biggest olive oil producer in the world plays a decisive factor, but also memories of a fake-oil food fraud scandal in the early 1980s, in which hundreds of people died and others were left with permanent sequels.

And so it works. It is certainly correct to criticize EU legislation, and even the ways in which those decisions are taken, but by spreading the myth that those rules are decided by ""Brussels bureaucrats"" without any external input, rather than by *our very own elected representatives* in public debate and negotiation, the likes of UKIP and PVV actually help *reduce* public scrutiny of this decision-taking process, leaving it into the hands of better-informed business lobbies.

true,hughk,EURO,European Union,"&gt;) The Crimean referendum establishes that a majority of the Crimean population wants to be part of Russia. Even Western diplomats admit that this is the likely outcome. Therefore, there is no point denying it. 

It establishes that a people under the propaganda and influence of ~~fascist thugs~~ vote for Russia. This is really not a good precedent.

&gt;2) The EU offers Russia the same Partnership agreement it offered to the Ukraine, Belarus, etc. to accommodate Putin's idea of trade zone from Lisbon to Vladivostok. 

Excuse me while I laugh. Yes, the EU could offer such an arrangement to Russia but only if it agreed on reducing corruption, money laundering and ensuring the rule of law.

The Kremlin does not want this. Many Russians would do. The Kremlin is worried that if the EU is able to start fixing the Ukraine via an ""association agreement* then they will be forced to approach the EU by their people too.

&gt;3) The EU does not sign any agreements with the caretaker government in Kiev. All agreements have to wait for an elected government.

I would agree that the current government is not democratic. Temporary agreements have to be made to give aid and breathing space for a proper election. The problem is that it is likely that the interim government will have to agree to terms that will bind the democratically elected government (you can't agree you borrow $5Bln today and then be able to give it back in a couple of months after the election).

&gt;4) Nato East expansion is halted unless Russia is included in the process.

It is clear that Ukraine requires protection, and probably components of the ABM system (The latter doesn't really work but it really annoys the Russians).

&gt;5) As condition for 2) thru 4) above, Russia will not fully integrate the Crimea and will refrain from sending troops into East Ukraine.

This won't happen. The Russian economy is failing (and has been over the last year, way before the Ukraine thing) due to substantial failures to modernise the economy and Putin is taking the Dictator no 1 solution, invade somewhere as a ""patriotic move"" to create a distraction.

&gt;6) The political process in the Ukraine is jointly monitored by the EU and Russia to make sure that no section of the population is disadvantaged.

The Russians do not tolerate international monitors as has been seen in Crimea (or in Russia) unless they are friendly.

&gt;7) The EU and Russia will cooperate to keep the Ukraine from bankruptcy. 

Russia has issues of its own. It cannot afford largesse any more.

&gt;8) EU trade with the Ukraine will be facilitated while making sure that traditional trade links with Russia are not compromised. 

FINALLY, something I can agree with. Being in an association agreement with the EU does not preclude trade agreements with other nations and blocs. On paper, at least, it will improve the trading for all. Full membership would preclude a special arrangement but that would be a very long time away.

The only thing to do would be to put money in the Ukraine, to help them defend their country (without compromising sovereignty). Germany in particular needs to bring the reactors fully back online so it depends less on gas. The EU should work with the US to bring LNG shipments online (export of LNG is currently forbidden under US Federal law) and the pipelines should be run in reverse.

Targeted sanctions should be taken against all higher levels of the Russian government down to Duma Deputy level. The same should go for higher ranks (equivalent to General) of the security and armed forces.

3) This is a tricky one. Invalidating the referendum by not voting is not a real option. They can just as easily call for another vote.

On several instances since the collapse of the USSR all the way up until last February, Crimeans have supported remaining in Ukraine. The argument that Crimeans are less inclined to support remaining in Ukraine due to the new regime in Kiev and the Russian invasion is fair enough, but a referendum should be held months or even years down the line to ensure that people are not making decisions in the heat of the moment. It would be akin to the US presidential elections occurring a week after the killing of Bin Laden or Iceland's accession referendum to join the EU occurring a month after the banking crash. It's unfortunate and less than ideal when it happens accidentally. When it's planned, it's absolutely preposterous and delegitimizes the referendum.

* Number Five (5). Doesn't show that it's a myth. The author mostly just says that the Tatars do not own Crimea. He does not show that it's a myth that ""Crimean Tatars will be persecuted or marginalized"".

Though a slightly more measured, sensible response to the situation in Russia, one could also view Nigel Farage and his party's statements on the issue to be towing the Russian-line:

&gt; UKIP leader Nigel Farage on Ukrainian situation.
""Two weeks ago it was revealed that the EU and the US were manoeuvring to set up a new government in the Ukraine. This is unacceptable. This should be a matter solely for the Ukrainian people to decide themselves without foreign interference. The provocative speeches and intervention of European foreign ministers and people like John McCain in the Ukraine have also been very deeply unhelpful.
""Too many people have died already; the street violence from both sides should stop. There will be a presidential election in the Ukraine next February. Hold off on your bullets and your stones, and use your ballot paper instead. Democratic involvement and change is infinitely better than needless violence.""

Another thing to consider are contract or billing periods. From what I read, you have a monthly terminable (pre paid?) at O2. That is quite rare here. Most, especially the cheapest options, will try to bind you to the contract for 2 years. 

Not being able to connect a different router is a big problem and also amply discussed in the media. Many people are upset just like you about not being able to connect a different one, especially since it can be a very big security risk. Since you have no access to the software of the O2 box, you never know what is going on in there. They could be stealing some of your bandwidth to provide public wireless Lan access. If happened before but is usually accompanied by public outcry. Just a few weeks ago, Fritz Boxes were in the media for having a huge security breach. They are very popular in Germany since they are considered to be the best in the market. 

However, it should definitely be possible to connect a router via cable to the O2 box. Since a router is nothing different than a little computer. If you have an alternative router, check the Internet for manuals and how you can connect it to a ""modem"", since that is basically what you have to do here.

The man decided to go through with a court case against the police, and the immigrant's rights group called for the Police to cease racial profiling. Only a couple of months ago another immigrant was severely assaulted under similar circumstances. [[CM]](http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/03/12/mmad-officer-accused-of-racial-attack/)

The French National Front and the Austrian Freedom Party were part of the same political grouping, the Alliance of European National Movements, as Svoboda which controls four ministries in the new government and were disproportionately represented in Euromaidan. They have since left to join a slightly less extreme far-right grouping in the EU while Svoboda remains in the more extreme grouping with Jobbik and the BNP, the former is also attending the Crimea referendum as an observer.

If people aren't worried by both then clearly they don't actually give a shit about the rise of the far-right, they just want to cry out about pro-Russian fascists while defending fascists who NATO sees as allies.

Marrazzo ha ottenuto più del 50% dei voti, mentre Storace + Mussolini sono sotto al 50%.

A parte che Marrazzo ha vinto per maggioranza *assoluta* e non per qualche manovra, so what? Per quanto per motivi politici trovo che sia poco saggio frequentare prostitute (che siano eterosessuali o transessuali o travestiti), si tratta comunque di una relazione tra adulti. Diciamo che il paragone avrebbe retto se Marrazzo avesse proclamato urbi et orbi che i transessuali fanno schifo e chi ha rapporti con loro andrebbe catapultato in orbita e poi l'avessero trovato con un transessuale.

Muros has already explained it, but it doesn't seem like you heard it: O2, like any other company with tens to hundred thousands of customers, have no idea nor do they care what's happening in the lives of their customers. 

They have an automated system set up to check if a bill has been paid or not. It's kind of hard to make out from your writing, but it seems that you've managed to buck the system by not providing it with the relevant/correct data several times. This is none of their fault, and withholding services until bills are paid is the only reasonable thing they can do in such a case.

I'm emphasizing this because you keep reiterating that their conduct is somehow evil and 'nasty,' which it isn't. Those 'nasty' extra fees are most likely late fees which you can 'get around' by simply paying on time.

- Vu les exceptions, si ça fait comme la dernière fois que ça a été mis en œuvre, il n'y aura que 20% du trafic en moins
- Des véhicules peuvent plus polluer que d'autres, indépendamment de leur plaque d'immatriculation
- En priorité les diesels, responsables de la quasi-totalité de la pollution aux particules fines. 
- Le reste de la pollution n'est pas imputable en majorité aux déplacements routiers. 
- Pas mal de monde a plusieurs voitures, et donc vont juste utiliser l'autre plutôt que de la laisser chez eux.
- Les transports en commun ne sont pas forcément adaptés à tous


Pourtant des mesures plus efficaces et simples à mettre en place peuvent exister, comme : 

- interdire l'entrée aux véhicules datant d'avant 1990 (ou une autre date)
- interdire les véhicules aux diesels (après avoir bien sûr changé de politique vis à vis de cette verrue)

*This week's top story was „Hungarians”*

On March 10 there was a pro-autonomy rally in Târgu-Mureș, that degenerated into [pushing and shoving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlU03rQfRPY) between the Gendarms and a far-right organisation from Hungary ([HVIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixty-Four_Counties_Youth_Movement)). As a reaction, Hungarian extremists from four different organizations (including [Jobbik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobbik) leaders) [were declared](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20fvia/romania_bars_hungarian_extremists_on_eve_of/) „persona non-grata” and [barred from entering the country](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/14/us-romania-hungarians-idUSBREA2D1QJ20140314) (the initial proposal was banning all members, but that was impossible, so they banned proeminent members). The [Hungarian party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDMR), member of the ruling coalition, supported the move.

Among things declared this week, [László Tőkés](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laszlo_Tokes), MEP for Romania, said that without autonomy, Hungarians will end up like the Crimean Tatars. This caused a bit of agitation.

On March 15, the Day of Hungarians [was celebrated, without incidents](http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Actualitate/Stiri/Ziua+Maghiarilor+sarbatorita+fara+incidente+autonomie). Once again, the Hungarian politicians' main request was ""autonomy"".

Given that both EP elections  and Hungarian parliamentary elections are close, and people with Hungarian citizenship from Romania can vote, everything is/was used to score political points.

Allgemein könnte man sagen, wenn es keine Fotos sind die wirklich als Pronographie eingestuft werden und davon gibt es viele, man schaue sich nur Bilder von anerkannten Künstlern wie Jock Sturges oder David Hamilton an, wo ist da Problem?. Da gab es bei den annerkanten Künstlern auch Untersuchungen ob es sich um Kinderpornographie handelt oder nicht, man kam zum Ergebniss, dass nicht. In den 60er und 70er Jahren gab es auch in Deutschland Fotobände frei im Handel, auch Kinderbücher, in denen nackte Kinder fotografiert waren teils mit fixierung auf Geschlechtsmerkmale zur Sexualerziehung, woran sich lange niemand gestört hat.

Was bei Edathy nur der gravierende Unterschied ist, ist die Herkunft des Materials über einen Händlerring, der auch eindeutig kinderpornografisches Material angeboten hat. Da ist es legitim und das muss sich Edathy gefallen lassen, nachzufragen und zu prüfen, ob er das garnicht mitbekommen hat oder wie er auf diesen Händler gestossen ist. Denn ich geh stark davon aus, dass dieser kanadische Anbieter, keine öffentliche .com-Homepage oder ähnliches betrieben hat um sein Material zu verkaufen. Es ist eindeutig zu prüfen, was bei Edathy alles für Material vorhanden ist, weil es eben aus einer sehr fragwürdigen Quelle stammt. Die Fotobände von Sturges die auch teils vollkommen nackte Kinder und Jugendliche zeigen gibt es frei auf Amazon. Wenn man auf solche Kunst steht, warum dann solch Umständliche Wege nutzen. Zumal ich stark davon ausgehen, dass kein Name, egal ob bekannt oder unbekannt, als Künstler hinter den Bildern steht. Da muss natürlich der Verdacht aufkommen, was man mit solchem Material aus so undurchsichtigen Quellen anfangen will, wenn es solche Kunst aus öffentlichen vollkommen legalen Quellen zu beziehen gibt.

Ich gehe stark davon aus, dass bei Edathy mehr als der reine Kunstgenuss dahintersteht, sonst müsste er sich nicht solchen Versteckspielchen aussetzen. Allerdings muss man auch sagen, dass das Gesamtthema völlig indifferenziert in dem Medien behandelt wird, so wie es mit vielem heutzutage der Fall ist, hauptsache Schlagzeile.

Ich will hier auch keine Kinderpronographie oder ähnliches Verteidigen, sondern eigentlich aufzeigen, dass Edathy sich nicht zu wundern braucht, warum es eine so große öffentliche Debatte wird, denn was die Leute vor allem hören ist, Nacktbilder von Kindern, die zwar keine sexuellen Handlungen zeigen, aber von einem Kinderpornoring stammen.

Aber andersrum muss man sagen, wenn jetzt jedes Bild von einem nackten Kind/Jugendlichen ein Verbrechen ist, dann müssten wahrscheinlich auch viele Eltern in den Knast, weil sie ihre Kinder beim baden fotografieren usw. Da kannste allein auf Facebook abertausende Bilder finden, was auch schonmal in der Öffentlichkeit debatiert wurde, allerdings sehr schnell auch wieder aus den Medien verschwunden ist.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; From a Russian point of view, European Union (and more importantly NATO) has taken away most of Eastern Europe from the Russian sphere of influence. Russians can't really see them as foreign (there's a famous Russian proverb ""chicken is not a bird, Poland is not abroad""). Same goes with Ukraine, it even used to be called Little Russia. Dynamo Kiev is even considered a Russian club.

That maybe the point of of view political, military and security elite, but certainly not the point of view of everybody: those Russians that I have met who worked in business or in academia certainly had different view - what they cared was their freedom and ability to work and live.

&gt; As for your EU propaganda, I am a European citizen, and consider the EU a bureaucratic moloch, replacing thousands of years of national identity that often was fought for, with artificial and self contradictory multi-culti message.

People have the freedom to decide by themselves in what kind of culture and society they want to live. Most people want high protection of individual freedoms, ability to freely work, and most importantly to consume. And you do understand that you have the freedom to live by traditions, but so does your compatriots have the freedom to live their lives other ways.

&gt; As a European citizen, I can't move to Finland or get educated in Germany - simply because I can't afford it and quite likely never will. The union allows for instance a Portugese network of supermarkets to take an ever greater hold on Poland, replacing small stores with foreign-owned conglomerates.

Your inability to move to Finland or get educated in Germany is not dictated by the state, it is not permanent state of matters, if you work hard enough you can do what you want. You have equal opportunities, the rest is up to you.

In case of for example Portuguese supermarkets in Poland, the other side of the coin is that by investing and transferring their know-how of retail to Poland, retail sector becomes more efficient thus offering more of what consumers want with lower prices. That is a win-win for everybody. ",1,1394978347,null,0,false,0,cg3xhn7,t3_20jkie,t1_cg3xhn7,t1_cg3x77f,null,1435551858,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

They failed and they lost the election. However the same people keep the leadership of the party and were caught financing illegally the 2008 electoral campaign in 2009. And my people elected them with the Second biggest majority in our history in 2011.

- The actual decisions about the lawsuits would be negotiated in a private courtroom under exclusion of the public, similar to the FISA court. I don't know who appoints the judges, but similar private courts for economic decisions usually rule in favour of corporations 3:1 and the decision process is not made public. This is prone to serious corruption and badly biased decision making. 
  
- The American part needs this agreement to gain access to the EU market (which has the biggest market in the world) for products they want to sell that do not meet the minimum EU-Standards. If those products were allowed to be sold, it would influence the prices you usually pay for your ""normal"", let's say, food (is my biggest concern). Now that you have a new substandard choice, you'll have to pay more for what you were used to until then, if you don't want to eat the new substandard food, but prices on average will be lower. The high-quality segment will stay relatively untouched, but the middle/normal one will deteriorate in price and/or quality. 
  
- The fact that companies can basically sue for anything will gradually erode the state, whose primary function is providing *provisions for existence* and this is achieved by rules and regulations via legislation. The translation would be, that companies want a piece every time the state uses its normal and primary function. This inclines the state to legislate less than it wants/needs to and the longer this meta-force keeps it from legislating freely, the worse the consequences are going to be long term. I fully agree, that if such an agreement was to be signed, that I'd would raise the question if the state actually is sovereign any more.  
  
  
There are lots of other things (but this is a big contract), mainly heaving genetically modified food on par with not-modified food , not necessarily because there's an insufficient body of studies on the long term health effects, but because the seeds are private property, the farmers are not allowed to trade and keep seeds anymore (a.k.a. Monsanto method) and pollen of modified plants irreversibly contaminate other fields, eliminating perfectly fine or even better strains which have been cultivated for a long time. This is not something you play with. Look at India and some parts of the U.S. and Africa for some inspiration.

The leader of our far-right Freedom Party (which was mentioned in the article) has already stated that we shouldn't vilify Putin, that he is doing what is right for his people, yada yada.


Also interesting is, that the Russians are condemning the new Ukraine government because they are ultra-nationalists and fascists (some even are outright Nazis); while at the same time they are inviting parties to be observers which are also ultra-nationalists. And while the Freedom Party is not fascist per se, but their members regularly get caught (and sentenced) for *[Wiederbetätigung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbotsgesetz_1947)* - glorification of the Nazi-regime or their world view.

E questo vale se sei abbastanza sveglio da andare a prendere i tagli strani di carne al mercato comunale, i detersivi al negozio di detersivi, l'alcol al negozio che vende sottomarche, il pesce al mercato ittico, etc. etc, comprando s'intende sempre con una pianificazione in mente, quindi niente monoporzioni. Se invece usi l'Esselunga come one-point-stop allora vai tranquillamente dai 200€ in sù.

-A Milano non scendi sotto i 500/600€ se in periferia e se veramente mini. Ma te lo sconsiglio. Come altri han detto, condividi una casa. Ti costa lo stesso in termini di stanza, ma risparmi sulle bollette, riparazioni, tutto quanto si possa condividere. Ed umanamente è molto più appagante. Non vuoi tornare ogni sera a casa con nulla da fare e non poter uscire a fare vita sociale perchè sei tirato con i soldi. Credimi su questo, vale anche se hai la ragazza.

-A milano, secondo me, ni. Puoi farlo, ma solo se condividi e se mangi di merda e se non esci. Ed anche così finirai a far debiti. Ci sono degli hardlimit che, per quanto tu possa mettercela, non puoi superare. E non è colpa tua. Fattene una ragione.

&gt;D'altra parte lo storico deve essere consapevole che la storiografia è imprescindibile dall'intervento dello storico. Anche le testimonianze, per quanto abbiano un'esistenza oggettiva, sono comunque selezionate, gerarchizzate, interpretate dallo storico; ancora una volta l'esperienza dell'informazione contemporanea dimostra quanto si possa influenzare l'opinione pubblica semplicemente disponendo i fatti in un certo ordine, così da valorizzarne alcuni a svantaggio di altri.

e evito i grassetti. Per questo dico che come sa chiunque abbia fatto anche solo qualche esame generico di storia all'università (io), e come è anche intuibile, non esiste l'oggettività dello storico.

Questo al netto del fatto che stai schivando che la storiografia per definizione è l'interpretazione soggettiva degli accadimenti storici. 
Mi costringi, ahimè, a citare wikipedia di nuovo:

&gt;La storiografia, cioè la descrizione dei fatti nella storia, è l'insieme di tutte le forme e maniere di interpretare, trasmettere, studiare e raccontare i fatti accaduti, cioè la storia propriamente detta. Dato che ogni considerazione, ricerca ed esposizione su ciò che è avvenuto deriva da interpretazioni personali, influenzate e condizionate dal clima culturale e politico in cui opera l’interprete, la storiografia è soggettiva, parziale e provvisoria. Anzi siccome ogni persona tra i miliardi di quelle viventi dispone di una personalità unica e irripetibile che ricorda, filtra e interpreta i fatti e le notizie in maniera propria e peculiare, si può affermare che di ogni fatto possono esistere tante interpretazioni storiografiche quanti sono gli esseri pensanti che lo prendano in considerazione, anche se è agli storici che si delega il compito di fornire le esposizioni più fondate e attendibili. La differenza tra storia e storiografia è quindi analoga a quella che c'è tra un fatto e il suo ricordo, tra vivere una vicenda e raccontarla.

What particularly irritates me is that Cameron fails to see the positive side of these institutions, including providing a permanent safety check on the actions of member states that may conflict with European standards of human rights. A few notable things in my own country would not have changed without ""~~un~~necessary interference"" from the European institutions, from the [decriminalising of homosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norris_v._Ireland) (1993) to [allowing of abortion in limited circumstances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A,_B_and_C_v_Ireland) (2013).

In some ways, it's curiously unambitious. For instance, the current Dutch government has said similar things about 'Ever Closer Union', and there are undoubtedly other countries that agree:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23005499

Even Angela Merkel has talked about putting more emphasis on subsidiarity in Europe. i.e. powers should go to Europe when that is appropriate, and go to national governments when that is appropriate. It's completely bizarre to say that powers should only ever flow in one direction.

Cameron should attempt to change the EU treaties full stop - if countries and people want closer union, then they can have it, but it shouldn't be baked into the treaties, as some sort of inevitable process. The foremost principle of the EU should be subsidiarity, not centralization.

true,KGB_for_everyone,RUSS,༼ つ ◕3◕ ༽つ,"i am indifferent towards European Union, i do not think its some devil incarnate nor a heaven for everyone. I do think however, that if you are weak economically and lack vision and desire to improve your country, you might get the rough end of the stick the same way some countries already had a pleasure to experience. Ask their citizens if they see future in their respective countries or any prospects of improvement, ask if European Union has answers or methods to improve situation there and not leave people to poverty or immigration.


Business opportunities are fantastic, but *starting conditions* are different (think civ 5 if u played it). Germany **is** strong and it is very hard to compete with them on pretty much anything that they produce with their several centuries old industrial school/tradition (i am not blaming them, their work ethic is admirable). Other countries has other strengths, so if you open your market for their products, you can expect for local production to go under. You know what comes next, so if you do not have a plan how to employ millions, perhaps you d better get one first, then execute this plan and theeen join political and economical unions from position of strength, not as banana republic. 



This is not unique problem but a global one and Russia has plenty of outright shitty or useless jobs who are not competitive or has any chances on global market (i'm looking at you AVTOVAZ).
 There is **a lot** of incoming unemployment to be experienced with automation of previous workforces alone, (if you add here competitiveness and possible crisis its even worse) this people need a job.
 What kind of job ? How do you teach millions ? What will be needed in several years? How much do you pay? Who will do all of that? Where do you get money for this ?


There are other issues, but this is my view on what is European Union and what awaits us in the future. 


Now on to what i consider evil and hostile to Russia and Russian interests, which is NATO, led by United States of democracy.
Having lived my whole life in Russia and Russian information field, i saw over and over again how we were tricked, lied to, condemned, ignored or spat on. What you might see as separate events non connected to each other, i see as a continuing efforts to undermine Russian interests or concerns. 
You and i can be as friendly and peace loving to each other, respect each other and wish for us the best, but this means jack shit when it comes to policymakers. I look at Western actions and see a continuation of Cold war era policies, with an end goal to put a gun next to Russia's head (maybe there is more, i don't know). Open map of Europe, look at Ukraine and realize that Ukraine in NATO is a gun next to Russia's head, or since you are finnish, a knife next to throat. Now, how do you like to live with such prospects? 


In places where Russia has no interests, it does not obstruct anyone - Frenchies wanted to ""help out"" Mali? Be our guest! Central African Republic genocide? No problem, send your boys!
 Weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? Hey, guys, maybe you like shouldn't do this stuff, there is no proof of this and it might turn bad... No? Mkay, do your thing i guess.
Terrorists bombed on 9/11? Here is some intel on Afghanistan, we won't get in your way. 
Iran is developing nukes and you sanction and embargo them? Ok, we'll play along.
List goes on and on.

But when Russia defends its interest, its the fucking Lucifer walking on Earth. Worst country EU, Burn the witch, dirty commies, warmongering assholes!


This is amazing to watch from Russian perspective. And now to last thing which i hate the most about Western world - unreal, outstanding, infinite **hypocrisy**. I fucking ""love"" reading Western media outlets or politicians, when they start to talk about corruption, or how Russia is bad because :""insert here"". 

""Russia is the most corrupted country ever! Russian people suffer so much and its such a shame what they must endure"" ----&gt;
 Psssst, if you are like oligarch or government official who stole billions, you can totally buy our super expensive property, million dollar watches and yachts and park your illegal money in our banks and tax havens. No questions asked, we are sure everything is in accordance to law. 

We might remember some time later if it is convenient for us that you have accounts and stuff here, so we can freeze this shit and show that we are with da people though! 


Examples are plenty and then some, but about Russian EU membership, again i am not a policymaker, i am just a dude who likes to read about stuff and sometimes i comment on things. My opinion is irrelevant in that respect, if Russia is to join EU, i would prefer we do it smart and with some kind of vision, not for the sake of it and hope for the best.

Can't write a store sign in Polish? Yup, that's about as bad as oppression can get.

They don't call it their home country. They also clearly don't like it here. 

You see, the law says that all public signs must be written in the official language. Official language is just one, Lithuanian. That is clearly written in the constitution. Changing it would require a national vote. Such voting can be initiated if a party collects 300 000 signatures of eligible voters. They clearly won't get it, because we like our constitution the way it is. If the polish people really feel oppressed here, then they can request a political asylum from Poland. I'm sure they would have it granted, since not being able to write ""Food"" in polish is a life-threatening situation. 

You may ask, why wouldn't they get the 300 000 signatures, needed to start a voting? Because they bitch and moan about lots of things, which in turn alienates them from us.

&gt; Copenhagen frequently tops rankings of the world’s happiest, most liveable and best-designed cities. [...] The importance of liveability in Danish culture is exemplified in the sustainable infrastructure of its capital city. Copenhagen is friendly to pedestrians, and perhaps even friendlier to cyclists [...] causing some to call Copenhagen the number one cycling city in the world.

Edit: Here's another great summary on [why commuting by car makes us unhappy](http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2010/03/30/commuting/):

&gt; A few years ago, the Swiss economists Bruno Frey and Alois Stutzer announced the discovery of a new human foible, which they called “the commuters paradox”. They found that, when people are choosing where to live, they consistently underestimate the pain of a long commute. This leads people to mistakenly believe that the big house in the exurbs will make them happier, even though it might force them to drive an additional hour to work. Another study, led by Daniel Kahneman and the economist Alan Krueger, surveyed nine hundred working women in Texas and found that commuting was, by far, the least pleasurable part of their day.

Health benefits [(Oja et al., 2011)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2011.01299.x/abstract):

&gt; Relatively large numbers and diverse types of cycling-specific studies [show] a positive relationship between cycling and health and functional benefits in young boys and girls and improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and disease risk factors as well as significant risk reduction for all-cause and cancer mortality and for cardiovascular, cancer, and obesity morbidity in middle-aged and elderly men and women. [T]he existing state of knowledge reinforces the current public health efforts to promote cycling as an important contributor to improving population health.

Environmental impact [(Walker, 2011)](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/12/cycle-like-danes-cut-emissions):

&gt; Europe could cut its transport greenhouse gas emissions by more than 25% if every population cycled as regularly as the Danes, according to a pioneering study which tracks the environmental impact of cycling down to the extra calories consumed by riders.

Economic benefits [(Schiller, 2013)](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3021074/making-the-economic-case-for-cycling-friendly-cities-with-bikeonomics):

&gt; There's also a potential ""green dividend"" when people bike about town, rather than driving to suburban malls. Their cash goes to local businesses, not to oil companies and Middle Eastern sheiks. By driving 20% less than other cities, Portlanders contribute $800 million to the local economy, one study says. [...] Bikeways also create more jobs per dollar than roads, according to one study.

Edit: Here's another interesting study, showing that [in the EU, on average each car is subsidised by society at large with 1600 euros per year](http://www.greens-efa.eu/fileadmin/dam/Documents/Studies/Costs_of_cars/The_true_costs_of_cars_EN.pdf):

&gt; The cars used within the EU-27 externalize about 373 billion euros per year (high estimate) on to other people, other regions and other generations (low estimate: 258 billion euros). This is a considerable sum, and it leads to a level of car use that is ineffi cient from the perspective of society. Because “others” pay for large parts of the costs of transport, Europeans travel by car too much to enable an efficient situation [...]. The findings of this study clearly show that the frequent claim “that cars cover all their internal and external costs” cannot be sustained. Although no detailed estimation of charges and earmarked taxes of cars attributable to external costs has been made in this study, it is obvious that a sum in the range of 300 to 400 billion euros of earmarked funds against these costs cannot be reached. On the contrary; it must be stated that car traffic in the EU is highly subsidized by other people and other regions...

Yes, Russians provoked Georgia in 2008, but it is also true that South Ossetia was already rebellious for some 20 years, and was a place for severe ethnic conflicts. Georgian forces did technically enter the region. And Russia never claimed the territory afterwards. This doesn't mean Russia didn't instigate the conflict from the start, of course.

But I do believe that the Russian incursion in Crimea is different - it has zero ground and is just outright violation of all international laws and agreements. There is absolutely no excuse.

Par rapport à ce qui constitue le titre cependant :

""Un algorithme est une caricature, une distorsion. C'est un terme qui tente d'attraper un système complexe pour l'abstraire, pour tenter de capturer une logique de comportement, tout en faisant l'impasse sur ses imperfections. Les algorithmes sont un système procédural, comme les jeux vidéos, c'est-à-dire qu'ils fonctionnent par une succession d'étapes. Or, si, par essence, les jeux admettent d'être une caricature, un faux semblant - ils n'essayent pas d'être ""vrais"", seulement d'être amusants - ce n'est pas le cas des algorithmes. Sim City n'est qu'une parodie de l'automatisation de la planification urbaine, tout comme nos systèmes de Smart Cities.""

Un algorithme est le traitement d'un modèle. Un modèle n'est pas une caricature, une distorsion, mais une abstraction (système complexe pour l'abstraire). Par essence donc, si les jeux vidéos sont effectivement des caricatures, les algorithmes ne peuvent y être comparés. Ils ne sont pas des faux semblant, une projection utilisée pour tromper, faire croire, construire une réalité virtuelle et numérique. Un algorithme est un produit de l'intelligence et de l'ingénierie, qui remplis un but précis, et n'en dévie pas. Il est imparfait, mais il ne ment pas.

L'auteur de la quote ci-dessus fait donc l'amalgame entre la nature de l'algorithme lui-même et sa perception par l'utilisateur. La distance de l'utilisateur avec nos machines, nos traitements, l'objet de la première partie de l'article, est effectivement un effet important. Mais ça ne peut être au centre d'une critique d'une ""culture algorithmique"". Si il peut être intéressant de penser en ces termes, ce n'est pas selon moi un angle d'attaque approprié.

La culture algorithmique, symptome de l'inversement de la science. L'algorithme est né d'une volonté de créer de la compréhension. Compréhension limitée par des machines artificielles, par la réalité, par la technologie, mais il s'agit là d'une automatisation du processus de modélisation lui-même, d'une réflexion sur ce qui constitue le processus scientifique (analyser, tester, catégoriser, modéliser). En prenant une tangente ici d'ailleurs, c'est là le cœur même des computer science, science jeune tirée du giron des mathématiques appliquées. La culture algorithmique porte aux nues la modélisation, mais ne la rende pas magique, contrairement à ce que Ian Bogost semble affirmer (enfin, je n'ai pas l'autorité pour le contredire, mais c'est mon avis personnel, et je ne suis pas convaincu par son argumentaire). Ils cachent effectivement une partie du processus de modélisation, mais ne le rendent pas cryptique, voir mystique. (Enfin, on peut aussi lire hofstadter et avoir un putain de trip mystique, mais là n'est pas la question).

Selon moi, les grandes questions des lumières sont toujours au cœur de l'actualité.

Jo, wenn man wissen will, wie oft Frauen sich als Opfer von Gewalt erlebt haben, muss man natürlich unbedingt Männer fragen... Ich finde es wichtig, dass ähnliche Untersuchungen auch für Männer durchgeführt werden. Aber hier wird wieder mal ein Gegensatz suggeriert, wo keiner ist. Und das Erleben von Gewalt, die Situationen, in denen sie entsteht, wie sich sich auf das Selbst- und Weltbild auswirkt etc. sind unterschiedlich genug, dass es nachvollziehbar finde, auch (!) unterschiedlichen Geschlechtern unterschiedlich Fragen zu stellen.

Es gibt meines Wissens nach haargenau niemanden, der (oder die) das nicht mit unterschiedlichem ""anzeigeverhalten"" erklärt.

However, this cleanliness of diesels comes at the cost of extra filters and fluids (e.g. DPF), so in reality, you're barely winning anything over petrols in terms of cost, because what you win at the pump, you lose at   maintenance.

Nulle part je n'ai dit que le gouvernement n'avait pas le droit de faire quoi que ce soit.

Je réponds à un strawman. Rien à voir avec ""insinuer que comme c'est un sujet non-éco c'est une diversion"".

&gt;Ce qui n'est pas faux, mais ça ne veut pas dire qu'on n'aurait pas du s'en occuper tant qu'on avait des choses plus importantes à faire, sinon on l'aurait jamais fait.

i saw that video after Yanukovych was deposed etc

I am sure you saw video about a guy called Muzichko or smtn with an AK. 

Have you read about Kharkiv or Donetsk i don't remember exactly, where right sector activists killed 2 people ? 

This is like the first things that come to mind, i am sure there is more, but whatever. What i find funny, is that Russian forces in Crimea are illegitimate, occupying bastards and guys like this are important partners, who is concerned about future of Ukraine and whatnot. 

Don't close your eyes on radical elements of your protest movement  or you will pay the same price Egypt did with Muslim Brotherhood. You may argue that: ""but we are different!"", well, guess what, egyptian liberals thought so too, in the end they had what they had. Organized people with vertical of power, military style chain of command and defined goals usually succeed more than people ""who are for everything good, against everything bad"". 


I assume you followed Euromaidan from the start, would you deny that Euromaidan/EuromaidanPR twitter accounts and links provided to Ukrainians media outlets was anti-Russian in their origin? By anti-Russian i mean a daily reminder how: ""Evil Russia is coming for you!"" type of messages, basically ""срать в головы, создавая образ врага"".

Noch einige Gedanken meinerseits:

* eine neue Wehrpflicht sollte generell für jeden gelten, unabhängig vom Geschlecht (auch in der Länge und Art der Ausbildung unabhängig vom Geschlecht). 

* es sollte sich um eine Basisausbildung handeln, *nicht* um eine Wehrpflicht von z.B. 1,5-2 Jahren.
Bei Interesse kann eine weitergehende Ausbildung erfolgen.

* das Zeitfenster um den Wehrdienst abzuleisten sollte größtmögliche Freiheit bieten.
In meinen Augen wäre ein Fenster von z.B. 18-30 Jahren ideal. Jedem sollte selbst überlassen werden ob er/sie den Dienst direkt nach dem Schulabgang oder gar nach einigen Jahren Berufserfahrung ableistet.

* es sollte fast keine Ausnahmen geben. Nur in Extremfällen wäre ein Nichtantreten zulässig. (z.B. 
wenn die körperliche Situation den Dienst auf gar keinen Fall zulässt)

Und der wichtigste Punkt:

* als ""Ersatzdienst"" sollte ein Sanitäts-/Zivilschutzdienst eingeführt werden. Statt Wehrdienst eine grundlegende Sanitäterausbildung der gleichen Länge wie der Wehrdienst.
Dies hätte den positiven Nebeneffekt, dass wir hunderttausende bzw. Millionen Ersthelfer für (Auto-)Unfälle und Katastrophen hätten. In jeder Unfallsituation wäre jemand mit Sanitäterausbildung anwesend. Dies würde Leben retten.

Da die Kontingente (Wehr- und Sanitätsdienst) von Jahr zu Jahr schwanken würden, mit einer Mehrheit die zum Sanitätsdienst tendieren wird, sollte eine Anmeldung mindestens ein halbes Jahr vor Antritt erfolgen. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solche Umstellungen lassen sich natürlich nicht in einem Jahr bewerkstelligen. Die Umsetzungen brauchen Vorlauf und die Kapazitäten müssten geschaffen werden, aber mMn wäre dies der richtige Weg.

Beim Wehrdienst sollte es darum gehen, dass man im Ernstfall genug Leute mit einer militärischen Grundausbildung zur Verfügung hat. *Kein* Wehrdienstleistender sollte in Auslandseinsätze geschickt werden, dies muss Berufssoldaten vorbehalten bleiben. 
Natürlich ist ein Wehrdienst aber auch eine Möglichkeiten dem Nachwuchsmangel entgegen zu wirken.

* Revenues in ski resorts were exceptionally low this winter due to the warm weather

* The national council (one of the parliament chambers) has approved to construct a second tunnel on the Gotthard motorway, which will replace the old Gotthard tunnel during its closure for refurbishment. After the works are completed, each tunnel will be converted to a single lane tunnel, improving security as there will be no oncoming traffic. The goverment has assured that this will not increase traffic, as for each tunnel, only a single lane will be used. The Swiss constitution forbids increasing capacity on motorways through the alps, after an initiative in 1994 that has been approved by 52% of the voters. However, opponents of the second tunnel cite high costs with relatively low long-term benefits and fear that the pressure by the EU to open a second lane, once the tunnel has been built, may be high. 

* The parliament approved of a proposition to introduce a new tax to finance the public radio and television. Currently, those media are paid for by fees which only households owning a device capable of receiving TV have to pay. However, with computers capable of receiving TV channels, this has become increasingly difficult to monitor. 

* The parliament is working on a law that would allow consumers to revoke contracts closed online, on the phone, and in postal shopping. This rule has already been in effect for doorstep selling contracts. 

* The Swiss People's Party, the party that launched the [popular initiative ""against mass immigration""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_popular_initiative_%22Against_mass_immigration%22) has threatened to launch another initiative (they call it enforcement initiative) if their initiative is not implemented according to their vision.

The municipal elections are coming next wendesday, so there has been an alot of political news lately.

* Local VVD-politicians (conservative liberals, same party as prime minister Mark Rutte) think it would be more efficient to go straight after the criminals, and want a special police department that only focuses on ethnic minorities.

* The VVD is now officially more corrupt than the christian democrats.

* The freedom party, which has been in the news for flying the nazi flag and wanting to solve 'the Moroccan problem', said it would be great if only there were fewer Moroccans.

* A Moroccan-Dutch member of the PvdA (labour) compared Wilders to Hitler on his facebook page. Facebook thinks this is way too offensive, so they decided to censor it.

* A local left-wing party has self-censored their election poster after it had been removed from facebook a couple of months ago.

* The PvdA (labour) has been accused of racism and may have to defend itself in court because of their proposal to tackle the exploitation of eastern European labour immigrants.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"I think we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.

As for the UK leaving the EU, I have conflicting feelings. Ireland had been trying to join the EU(Then EEC) for a long time but was being veto'd by France due to our ties to the UK. Nothing has really changed for us since then, we're more reliant than ever on membership and if the UK left, we'd just keep on trucking on.

As for what I think about the UK leaving in of itself, I think you'd be shooting yourself in the foot with a shotgun. 

Yeah, I don't like Cameron or most UK politicians for that matter due to what *appears* to be rampant anti-EU rhetoric that comes out of there on the near-daily basis, but at the same time if we're all agreeing on something the problems don't get changed.

My problem with the dissent from the UK is that it's not offering *real* solutions. The primary solutions coming from the UK(and other skeptics around Europe) are those primarily leading to the effective dismantlement or hamstringing of the EU, as opposed to offering solutions that would make an (inevitable) European integration an acceptable prospect(Compacting of the bureaucracy, redoing the houses of representatives and so on and so forth).

Should the UK leave the EU they'll simply be trading their ""lack"" of sovreignty under the Union and transferring that same lack to the United States, because let's face it, the UK is not a global power, and should the Scottish referendum end up with independence, it'll signal the end of them as a relevant regional power, too. There's no way they could go it alone.

The UK does not want to be isolationist. It never works.

Personally, I believe the UK will remain relevant only as long as it's within the European Union and manages to not let domestic politics screw over its credibility as a game changer in the Union. Which is why we need a reform of the democracy within the EU, so we can move EU politics away from the national level and might get some of the necessary changes done, not a total butchering of the EU like Cameron would like.

Exchange students studying at the university temporarily don't necessarily need to demonstrate the same language skills.)

The DSH in one test that is used by universities to determine minimum language ability. B2 is conversational German -- someone at a B2 level will find classes in German pretty difficult, but is able to speak well enough to get around and make themselves understood. They'd struggle with university course work simply because of language, but should be able to pass if they put in the time and effort required to do the course work, which you include a lot of looking up words and having someone proofread assignments to make sure they make sense -- it's very easy to attempt sentences that are beyond your ability and come up with gibberish where it's impossible to figure out what you know/understand.)

At a North American university, B2 level requires about 4-6 semesters of study, depending on how well you study and retain the material and how much practice you get (e.g. the person who watches TV in German, reads comics or children's books in German, and reads short German news briefs will develop her language skills more quickly than someone who only uses German in class and homework).",0,1394995147,null,0,false,0,cg43thb,t3_20k8ia,t1_cg43thb,t3_20k8ia,null,1435554849,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

You are right, it most certainly is not a good idea. We can even take a relevant example from 2/7 of [Cameron's Seven Targets](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/10700610/David-Cameron-my-seven-targets-for-a-new-EU.html):

&gt;(1)::New controls to stop “vast migrations” across the continent when new countries join the EU;

&gt;(2):: Tighter immigration rules to ensure that migrants come to Britain to work, not as tourists planning to cash in on “free benefits”;



The pillar/sacred principle as found in the [The EEC Treaty, signed in Rome in 1957 (aka Treaty of Rome)](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/institutional_affairs/treaties/treaties_eec_en.htm) of ""freedom of movement of labour"":

&gt;*""This common market is founded on the famous ""four freedoms"", namely the free movement of persons, services, goods and capital. It creates a single economic area establishing free competition between undertakings. It lays the basis for approximating the conditions governing trade in products and services over and above those already covered by the other treaties (ECSC and Euratom).""*

And relevant:

&gt;*""The establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in July 1952 was the first step towards a supranational Europe. For the first time the six Member States of this organisation relinquished part of their sovereignty""*

So, here's a clear example of a Treaty effective for the circumstances 56 years ago and in aid of establishing a future Supranational organization. 

Now 56 years later in the UK's case:

1. The conditions of that Treaty are maladaptive to the reality of the UK's public demands for control of borders and offsetting of ""mass immigration"". ie from the 6 initial members upwards including the UK's membership and further to the current 28 and beyond.
2. Secondly these four freedoms are in aid of implementation of progressive environment towards a Currency Union, again which the UK is not a part of (thanks in no small part to a certain Mr. George Soros).
3. Thirdly, both of these linked features of the EU are aimed towards the creation of a Federal United States of Europe again this is not a move that the British public favour (nor that many across Europe presumably).
4. Finally, these Treaties are so unwieldly and as can be seen in the eg of Mr. Cameron's x2/7 Targets require Treaty change that is impossible within the EU to agree on for all 28 members; Federalists no less!

Dipende parecchio da dove andrai a vivere. In una città di medie dimensioni (Brescia) i costi vanno dai 150€ ai 400€ per un appartamento condiviso con una o più persone. Il costo varia a seconda di cosa vuoi: più di un bagno, cucina separata dal soggiorno, camere singole o doppie, zona della città, ecc... Con un po' di fortuna e cercando per bene puoi trovare anche ottime offerte ad esempio io pago 212€/mese per un appartamento da 180mq condiviso con altre due persone con due bagni, tre camere doppie ed ampiiooo soggiorno, in un'ottimo quartiere della città..
Poi calcola 30€ circa per una buona adsl e mediamente 70€ al mese di gas acqua luce e tassa rifiuti...

&gt; quanto spende in media una persona sola d'alimenti al mese

Da solo conterei dai 30€ ai 50€ con pranzi infrasettimanali esclusi quindi 120/200 al mese. Poi ovviamente facendo la spesa con altre persone si tende a spendere di meno...

&gt; è possibile vivere da soli con uno stipendio da 1000€?

Sacrificando la macchina e spostandosi in bicicletta secondo me si, con un 200€ di disavanzo circa...


Se non pensi di facela agilmente rimani qualche altro anno con i tuoi genitori e metti da parte un po' di soldi, non è che devi vivere con l'ansia di non sapere se riuscirai a pagare la prossima bolletta solo perchè non vuoi essere additato come un mammone...

Corruption and incompetence can ruin everything.

Anyway, returning to the closed factories: many people (particularly Roma, but not only them) stole everything made from metal from the old factories and sold it for scrap; some of them even became iron scrap wholesale dealers. At one time, iron scrap was one of top Romania's exports.

true,Paludosa2,null,null,"&gt; Ambitious? For me it sounds like a list of demands intentionally made in a way that makes it impossible to achieve not to mention the fact that half of it is against anything EU wants to achieve and smells more like a cherry picking 

I don't believe this is an accurate picture of how things actually stand concerning Mr. Cameron, Conservative party leader and Coalition Prime Minister of a largely Eurosceptic UK public... let me explain:

1. Mr. Cameron is highly Pro-EU.
2. He has about a 10% eurosceptic element in his party of varying degree and varying party influence.
3. He has a largely Eurosceptic public who have been promised a referendum for a long time and had many broken promises of referendums by all parties many times by now.
4. Mr. Cameron is both forced to offer a eurosceptic olive branch/bread crumb to both his party as he's made the party go closer to the center than the right (as coined ""LibLabCon"") of ""some"" concessions and secondly to the public for the above reasons that time is catching up with the former broken promises and downright lies to the British public on ""his watch"".
5. He knows if he does not gain major concessions the UK public will more likely kick him out (as again part of his strategy is to win the next General Election via eurosceptic vote) but then campaign to stay in with concessions as a tough leader on the EU.
6. He has to take this line because of the rise of UKIP, the UK Independence Party that was created due to the lack of vote when former PM John Major did not allow a vote on the signing of the Maastricht Treaty (the fore-runner to the formation of the single-currency EURO). Since then this party has grown in influence and popular support as reflected by the ""democratic deficit"" over the EU and are therefore driving political agendas (in a similar way to the Liberal Democrats in the previous GE and now current coalition partners of the Conservatives of Mr. Cameron).
7. Pragmatically, Mr. Cameron can and must demand from the EU such measures both as the first round of negotiation so that via first stalling for time and second negotiation he can whittle it down to spurious offers to appease the people that sound great on paper and actually gain some advantages where the EU is actualy genuinely failing Britain economically and recovery from the worst dip since the War is vital.
8. Mr. Cameron is very pragmatic: He knows for all the above reasons this is the only course of action open to him that is winnable that also allows him the best chance to win a ""stay in the EU"" vote in a referendum which will be given to the British public sooner or later.
9. By adopting this ploy the attempt is to kill of the UKIP rise for euroscepticism while taking the sting out of it and finally the other parties closing ranks to deny a referendum = Labour win in the 2015 UK General Elections - if the strategy works.

All the main parties in the UK want to stay in the EU. The Conservatives have more reasons to demand change in the EU however.

He has to take this line because of the rise of UKIP, the UK Independence Party that was created due to the lack of vote when former PM John Major did not allow a vote on the signing of the Maastricht Treaty (the fore-runner to the formation of the single-currency EURO). Since then this party has grown in influence and popular support as reflected by the ""democratic deficit"" over the EU and are therefore driving political agendas (in a similar way to the Liberal Democrats in the previous GE and now current coalition partners of the Conservatives of Mr. Cameron).
7. Pragmatically, Mr. Cameron can and must demand from the EU such measures both as the first round of negotiation so that via first stalling for time and second negotiation he can whittle it down to spurious offers to appease the people that sound great on paper and actually gain some advantages where the EU is actualy genuinely failing Britain economically and to aid a recovery from the most severe recession since the War is vital to again win support from business and voters and politicians on all sides.
8. Mr. Cameron is very pragmatic: He knows for all the above reasons this is the only course of action open to him that is winnable that also allows him the best chance to win a ""stay in the EU"" vote in a referendum which will be given to the British public sooner or later.
9. By adopting this ploy the attempt is to kill of the UKIP rise for euroscepticism while taking the sting out of it and finally the other parties closing ranks to deny a referendum = Labour win in the 2015 UK General Elections - if the strategy works.
10. The strategy is to attempt to win if enough of the public can be convinced by the promise of a referendum but in the even the other major parties gain power if not.

In none of Mr. Cameron's speeches does he mention Article 48 TEU Lisbon Treaty. In none of any of the major politicians speeches do they mention Article 50 TEU Lisbon Treaty.

The only difference is that Mr. Cameron ""appears"" to offer more for voters while the other major parties actually offer nothing on the EU. If any of them were genuinely serious they would mention either Article above; where only one of them is realistic.",1,1394997621,null,0,false,0,cg44wp0,t3_20jpfe,t1_cg44wp0,t3_20jpfe,null,1435555363,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Es geht ausschließlich um eine Basisausbildung, nicht um eine ""Massenrekrutierung"".

&gt; Zur Wehrpflicht selbst: was zum Teufel will man mit den ganzen Leuten anstellen?

Garnichts. Grundausbildung. Ein kleiner interessierter Teil wird bleiben, der Rest geht seinen Weg.

Deutschland ist derzeit nicht verteidigungsfähig, würden wir in eine (zugegebenermaßen derzeit sehr unrealistische) Bedrohungssituation kommen wäre es zu spät.
Man *muss* auf jede Situation vorbereitet sein.

&gt; Es ist ja nicht so als würden diese Massen an ausgebildeten Rettungssanitätern (??) tatsächlich gebraucht werden.

? Richtig. Genauso wie derzeit niemand Leute mit militärischer Grundausbildung braucht. Aber es schadet eben auch nicht. 
Ich rede nicht von angestellten Rettungssanitätern, sondern von Zivilisten mit einer Sanitäterausbildung. 

&gt;  Wer soll das bezahlen und warum??

Es wird in Deutschland Geld für weitaus weniger sinnvolle Dinge aus dem Fenster geworfen. Die derzeitigen Umbrüche zeigen doch wie schnell sich Gefahrenlagen ändern können. Nicht für Deutschland, aber wenn es irgendwann mal so weit sein sollte, wäre es zu spät um zu handeln. Natürlich ist es unrealistisch, aber die Welt ändert sich manchmal schneller als uns lieb ist.

Auch glaube ich, dass wenn man gut plant, die Kosten deutlich niedriger sein würden als für einige andere Projekte. Wir reden nicht von Berufssoldaten, und die Ausrüstung mit nach Hause nehmen wird nach seinem kurzen Dienst auch niemand.

&gt; Meine Fresse...ich hoffe nicht, daß wir tatsächlich wieder auf eine neue Angstshow reinfallen und eine Angst die schon so ausgelutscht ist, daß außer den Islamophoben keiner mehr dran glaubt, gegen eine ""neue"" Angst austauschen

Es geht doch gar nicht um Angst, sondern darum auf alles vorbereitet zu sein.

Wenn ich ein Atomkraftwerk mit allen erdenklichen Sicherheitsvorkehrungen austatte und für jedes Szenario Notfallpläne erstelle, heißt dies doch nicht, dass ich Angst vor einem Zwischenfall oder gar einem Super-GAU habe.

Es heißt nur, auf jede noch so unrealistische Situation vorbereitet zu sein.
Ein ernster Zwischenfall in einem AKW ist extrem unwahrscheinlich, eher würde man 52 Wochen am Stück nen' 6er im Lotto haben, trotzdem wäre es töricht dies nicht mit einzukalkulieren.

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"Der Artikel enttarnt sich nach zahlreicher, subtiler Relativierung der Ergebnisse der Studie letztendlich beim Verweis auf Rainer Brüderle als tendenziöse maskulinistische Kackscheiße:

&gt;Manchmal reicht schon eine alter Herrenwitz zum vernichtenden „Aufschrei“, der dann  – wie der Fall des FDP-Spitzenkandidaten Brüderle gezeigt hat – die politische Reputation von heute auf morgen zerstört.

So ein irrer Wahnsinn.

Brüderle sagte damals nach wiederholter Anmache: ""Sie können ein Dirndl auch ausfüllen.""

...was in saloppere Jugendsprache übersetzt ungefähr so viel hieße wie ""Wow, du hast aber dicke Titten.""

Wer das als Herrenwitz bezeichnet ist doch einfach nur wahrnehmungsgestört und relativiert den blatanten sexuellen Hintergrund. Dass Brüderle deswegen geflogen ist war das Mindeste.

**Zum Artikel an sich:**

Ich glaube jeder mit gesundem Menschenverstand weiß, dass die Welt nicht schwarz-weiß ist und dass sowohl Männer als auch Frauen in der Lage sind, missbrauchendes Verhalten an den Tag zu legen.

Es weiß auch jeder, dass polarisierende oder suggestive Studien recht unbrauchbar sind, jedoch verstehe ich nicht wieso eine Befragung von Frauen nach Missbraucherlebnissen ungültig oder verzerrt sein sollte - nur weil Männer angeblich nie befragt werden? (gibts übrigens sehr wohl schon Befragungen von Männern zu dem Thema)


Dann stellt sich mir die Frage nach dem Sinn des Artikels.

Denn lustigerweise macht der Autor genau das, was er seinen Gegnern vorwirft: Polarisierung und einseitige Sichtweise. Ganz im Sinne des Begriffs ""Maskulinismus"", dessen Anhängerschaft so lächerlich ist wie die Anhängerschaft von Feminismus á la Schwarzer.


Von Differenzierung und Objektivität ist im Artikel nämlich keine Spur, stattdessen wird **Missbrauch von Frauen dadurch relativiert, dass Männer auch von Frauen missbraucht werden.**

Das ist **wie die Relativierung von Rassismus gegen Schwarze durch einen Verweis auf Rassismus gegen Weiße.**

Statt Missbrauch/Sexismus auf Seiten der Frauen **und** Männern zu lokalisieren und die objektive Goldene Mitte zu finden, wird mal wieder nur Heiße Luft gelabert.

Der Autor macht im Prinzip nicht anderes als das angbliche *Frau=Opfer/Mann=Täter-Prinzip* in *Frau=Täter/Mann=Opfer* zu verkehren. Finde Ich schon relativ lächerlich, da das effektiv dasselbe hirnrissige stereotype Schema ist.

* ""Frauen nutzen ihre Opferrolle aus, Männer sind ja sooooow diskriminiert!!!1elf""

* ""Frauen sind die tatsächlichen Täter und Männer die wahren Opfer!!""

* ""Blablubb, Männer sind doch gar nicht sexistisch, alles normale (Herren)Witze!!! Frauen sind voll die Sensibelchen!!12"" (aka. ""Was sexistisch ist, bestimme Ich!"")

Ich sehe es nicht ein für ""Garnichts"" aka Rekrutierungsmassnahmen zu zahlen. Was soll das den?

&gt; Deutschland ist derzeit nicht verteidigungsfähig

Nach welchen Maßstäben bitte? Verteidigungsfähig gegen was?! 

NATO anyone?

&gt;  Man muss auf jede Situation vorbereitet sein.

""Man"" kann gar nicht auf jede Situation vorbereitet sein. Niemals. Wir sind für unsere Zeit vorbereitet genug. Wir sind sogar ""übervorbereitet"" immerhin können wir uns sogar leisten unsere gelangweilten Soldaten in den Mittleren Osten zu schicken. 

&gt; Richtig. Genauso wie derzeit niemand Leute mit militärischer Grundausbildung braucht. Aber es schadet eben auch nicht.

Doch tut es. Es schadet dem Budget des Landes. Es schadet den Leuten die ihre Zeit verschwenden statt für ihr Leben zu lernen oder zu arbeiten. Mal ganz abgesehen von dem Schaden den die Leute bekommen können von der Ausbildung. Ich spreche da aus Erfahrung btw. 

&gt; Ich rede nicht von angestellten Rettungssanitätern, sondern von Zivilisten mit einer Sanitäterausbildung. 

Mit ""Rettungssanitäter"" meinte ich eher so etwas wie einen ""Rang"". War früher glaub eich mal der San-2. Weisst du was mit einer Ausbildung passiert wenn man sie nicht anwendet? Bestimmt kannst du dich noch an deinen Erste-Hilfe Kurs von der Führescheinprüfung erinnern...ich nicht und ich hatte sogar den San-1. Sowas auch noch für Monate für tausende von Leuten zu bezahlen ist Wahnsinn...Ich verstehe nicht warum du hier nicht zumindest bei dem Argument des alten Zivildienstes geblieben bist. Da geht das ganze Geld wenigstens in sinnvolle Subventionen statt einfach für etwas weggeschmissen zu werden was vielleicht mal passieren könnte...

&gt; Es wird in Deutschland Geld für weitaus weniger sinnvolle Dinge aus dem Fenster geworfen. 

Dümmer gehts immer. Aber das ist doch kein vernünftiger Grund um zusätzliche Ausgaben zu rechtfertigen...Warum bauen wir nicht in jeder Stadt Landeflächen für UFOs? Die könnten ja auch irgendwann kommen.

&gt; Die derzeitigen Umbrüche zeigen doch wie schnell sich Gefahrenlagen ändern können. Nicht für Deutschland, aber ...

Eben. Nicht für Deutschland. Ende. 

Die Gefahrensituation ist nicht realistisch und rechtfertigt das eben nicht. Damit musst du halt klar kommen. Schreckensszenarien zu malen oder auf Basis von was ""vielleicht mal irgendwann"" passieren könnte ist doch keine Basis für vernünftige Politik!

&gt; Es geht doch gar nicht um Angst, sondern darum auf alles vorbereitet zu sein.

Es geht ausschließlich bei diesem Thema um Angst weil die Gefahrensituation wie schon gesagt nicht gegeben ist. Sie wird künstlich geschaffen. Wie in diesem Springer Artikel geschehen. 

Das Atomkraftwerk steht da. Es ist da. Die Gefahr ist anwesend. Du kannst hin gehen und sie anfassen und wenn du zu nah ran gehst stirbst du sogar. Ein AKW vernünftig abzusichern kostet auch nur einen Bruchteil einer ""Mobilmachung"" wie du sie vorschlägst und liegt eigentlich in der Verantwortung von Privatunternehmen die den betreiben.

I think these points are deliberately ambiguous. This way there's more of a chance of amassing coalitions to work with. Take the first for example:

* Powers flowing away from Brussels, not always to it

Are we talking about specific laws e.g. some single thing passed in 1976? Is it broad policy areas e.g. JHA/economy/foreign policy? Or is it more general, thus opening the door to any policy at any time, should the right coalition arise?

What happens now is the other 27 Member States look at this and see if there's anything they'd like to work with.

As for the opinion of the public, well, it's malleable. At the moment in the UK I don't really feel there is a widespread educated opinion on the role of the EU and its powers and fear a lot of the 'public opinion' on the EU are little more than tropes spouted by a fearmongering media.

Therefore, voting for the 1992 Constitution would effectively be the same as voting to reunify with Russia.

Le Dauphin and Chateaubriand are chefs favourites with the focus on the food and not the decor or silver service. Spring is run by an American and also is a creative spot. If you have the budget, a few recommended top end spots are L'Abeille (http://www.shangri-la.com/paris/shangrila/dining/restaurants/labeille/) or L'Epicure (http://www.lebristolparis.com/fr/restaurants-et-bars/epicure/) are great options - I'd suggest lunch if you want to try the food rather than break the bank, L'Epicure for dinner is over €1000 if you want wine and extras.

Finally my personal favourite is Akrame - recently awarded his second Michelin star and well worth it. Book now though (as with everywhere) however Easter might be a little quieter with school holidays. If you can't get a reservation at Akrame, try across the road at Atelier Vivanda - if you like great meats, wine and chat - sit up at the seats overlooking the small kitchen and bring an empty stomach

true,threep03k64,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; But don't you think the UK Government has been very irresponsible in not promoting discussion and information on the UK's place within the EU 

I agree; the political parties of the UK have been hugely irresponsible. Even with the EU debate heating up (because of UKIP) I feel there has been a complete lack of substantive information, with both sides trying to appeal to voters through vague ideas (of togetherness, or sovereignty etc) instead of disseminating the type of information I feel every voter should have should a referendum be called.

I think the media is to blame as well, and are just as guilty as the government in giving us vague arguments but failing to truly report on the *specifics* of the EU. We are constantly told that more and more power is moving towards Brussels etc. and I feel if the EU is truly the bureaucratic behemoth that the media is painting it out to be, then the specifics of the EU should warrant a lot more discussion time.

When I say 'specifics' I'm referring to legislation for example. What is being debated and what has passed? What legislation has been rejected? Why is the EU even legislating on this? This could hit on issues such as exclusive or shared competence, or subsidiarity which I feel are *vital* to the EU debate, but I wonder if even 5% of the UK population could identify what those words mean in the context of the EU.

Any debate on the EU requires the public to have a far better understanding than I feel we currently have, and the media and politicians are not currently giving us the level of information required, and are not giving EU discussion the *time* is requires.

&gt; The phrase the public will not understand is inexcusable

I think this is a valid point. *However* I have two responses to this:

The first point I'd like to raise is merely based on reality. The fact that information *can* be found on the EU doesn't necessarily mean that it will. I very much fear how many people would be willing to vote in a referendum on our future in the EU without having even an adequate level of knowledge. I therefore feel that some information still needs to be brought *to* the voter to help limit this issue.

The second point I'd like to raise is that the EU is *hugely* complex. I studied the EU in my law degree and touched upon it my postgraduate studies also, and to be honest parts of it still confuse me. Treaties, directives, and case law can all be confusing, and with that in mind I feel there is a role (for the government and media) to give people access to information on both sides of the debate that is transparent and easier to understand (whilst still being sufficiently informative).

Personally, I'll be honest and admit a bias. I'm pro-EU and very wary of the views of Cameron on the EU merely because I don't believe any renegotiation (if he were to even manage it) would be used for anything more than screwing over the average worker. I have a similar level of skepticism with regards to his stance on the ECHR.

&gt; But would it be the case if UKIP wouldn't cause such a stink over it?

Firstly, it wasn't UKIP who ""raised a stink"" about this: it was all over the press. Secondly, Commission proposals are debated, amended and rejected by the European Council and Parliament *all the time*, without much intervention from UKIP, PVV or consorts: in fact, their parliamentary attendance record is notoriously bad.

&gt; How about Aegean-Olympic merger? First the Commission blocks it, which gets approved. Then it allows it, which also gets approved. How often does it happen that something that they pass doesn't get approved?

Now you are talking about something completely different, which is the Commission's task of *enforcing* the legislation passed by Council and Parliament, in this case its antitrust legislation. So, in a first attempt it rejected a merger and in a second attempt it accepted it? That's nothing exceptional if circumstances change, which they did here.

In any case, the decisions of the Commission in antitrust matters can be judicially challenged at the European Court of Justice, [which has already overturned them in the past](http://www.hoganlovells.com/files/Publication/d27d5b3f-a1b9-48d6-bdff-93df01294400/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/3e83f68f-035f-44a6-a784-f0c8431f558e/1785_050317_EU%20Bulletin%20-Tetra%20Sidel%20Changes.pdf).

Caro inferiore,

&gt;mi stavo ponendo delle domande sull'origine del bicameralismo,

Come scrivevo nell'editoriale della settimana scorsa su ""Gente di un certo livello"", prima dell'attuale Costituzione, vigeva lo Statuto albertino, in cui il parlamento era diviso in due camere: i deputati erano eletti dal popolo, mentre i senatori erano nominati dal re (ah! il re!).

&gt;su come si è arrivati a quel numero di deputati e senatori,

Questo me lo diceva il conte di Fonsbury, mentre si discuteva, davanti a un buon vino servito in una grolla, ma ho dimenticato ciò che ci siamo detti e del perché proprio quel numero.

&gt;e in generale sulle funzioni di un parlamento, 

Quello è facile: principamente codificare (non ricordo il termine tecnico) le leggi, che rientra nel famoso potere legislativo (v. teoria della separazione dei poteri).

Russia has never been master of Europe though. At best, Russia has only reached second best. 

Number one ""Masters of Europe"" status has gone to Britain, France, Germany and the US at different periods in time. But never to Russia. 

The only time when Russia came close was at the end of WW2 + immediately after WW2. But the ""master of Europe"" status at that time rather goes to the US, or to the US/Britain-led alliance, since at the time, and then during the entire existence of the USSR, Western Europe WAS Europe. The heart and center of Europe was Western Europe. The USSR only accomplished to impoverish Eastern Europe and set it back even more than it already was in comparison to Western Europe.

Thankfully, Eastern Europe, now free and allied with the West, has started developing again. 

Russia has Belarus in its sphere of influence to show off. The West has Poland. Guess which country is doing better?

Russia's attitude is a sad thing. If Russia were reasonable it would benefit Russia. Now, unfortunately, Russia is pushing itself in a corner, making every one of its neighbors, including China and other ex USSR nations, distrust it. Soon, Russia will be alone. 

It's too bad because Russia, after the fall of the USSR, could have been a friendly nation, which would have greatly helped its development.

But now, I will try to explain it. 
The world has lived through relatively stable times ever since WW2, however this is quickly going to change in the coming century because of the 9 billion people projected by the UN, scarcity of resources like water and food, and hell, Ukraine right now is a great example. It is important to upkeep the well being of people that are similar to you and share similar values because they are the ones that will look out for you/your children/your achievements. Also there is more than just me. This is the major issue, and also why the brithrates are so catastrophic. People assume there is nothing greater than than the invidual, as you said, what does it matter to ME? It matters to my ancestors that fought the battles of Vienna against the Turks, it matters to me because I see myself as just a small piece of this great civilization of europeans that united the world (through questionable means, but nonetheless). These are all things worth upkeeping and honoring, because you would want it too if you were to accomplish something great. 

That is just the argument of sentimentality, I will continue to more practical ones.

Instability. Major demographic transitions like the one currently ongoing in europe, with a graying native european population, and large % of young populations being non-europeans that do not integrate, you are breeding a mosh pit of issues. And this is real. Pim Fortyn, Theo van Gogh were the first shots of the civil war that WILL happen eventually as the european baby boomers die out and leave a shrunken native european population to tackle the issues present. I don't want the same fate for me or my family, that happened to native americans. Look at Syria right now. That is what a muslim population enables, a steady flow of young indoctrinated jihadists, who essentially want to create hell on earth for anyone that is not their sect of Islam.

Life and nature are brutal and indifferent, and you need protection from that. I used to be liberal and tolerant, thinking everyone is a good human being by nature. But that's a massive illusion, and the only thing protecting you from the aforementioned instabilities are a strong and proper european culture and populace, compatible with human rights and freedom of speech. That will not be the case once Islamic colonialism gets enough power in europe. In the Netherlands Muslims already formed an anti-gay party. There is SO much more I could and should mention, that I feel helpless. But I do my best to spread awareness at least now on reddit, and later on in life I hope to somehow become engaged in these issues to avoid instability and catastrophes. I'm only 21, I have potentially another 60 years to live, and I will not be a coward and stick my head in the sand, because I can't. That's just not me. 

I hope I gave you a small insight into the issue, but really it would take a few beers and a good time to go more into debth. Btw, alcohol is also incompatible with sharia law. 

Essentially it is about the freedoms of the individual that lead to the greatest fruition of investment into human creativity, that will be stiffeled if the EU does not adopt a proper immigration policy that will be viable in the longterm. And human creativity is the sole reason why we can even have this talk right now :)

I've heard from many Russians that though they would like to have more democratic freedoms, most people are willing to turn a blind eye to what the Russian government and the oligarchs do on account of the fact that Russian incomes and HDIs in the various republics in the federation have been rising, albeit slowly, in addition to a low unemployment rate. Add to this a cultural affinity for a strong, heavy-handed rule of law, and the result is what you see of Russia today. 

But, because the Russian economy is going to inevitably going to take a hit from all of this, Putin's one good bargaining chip as to why he's the man for the job might very well be taken away from him: the promise, or at least the perception, that he is a man who can offer social stability and foster economic growth.

A quick recap: a short while ago we had a quick government changeover as Renzi, the left wing mayor of Florence who has been trying to become prime minister candidate for a while started a party rebellion which pulled the rug under Letta, who acted as prime minister for just a few months, and stole the crown.

Basically the parliament is still mostly split 3 ways, but Renzi built some bridges towards Berlusconi in order to secure some support and had himself voted by the parliament as new PM. Some people call Renzi ""the Berlusconi of the left"", some other ""the buffoon salesman"" and some other see in him the true chance for something to actually happen.

So, this week:

* Renzi primises a chainfire of reforms, almost one a month, to fix jobs, the economy and schools. As a first step within 2 months the automatic taxes on salaries will be reduced for mid/low earners by about €1000/year. Where the money is supposed to come from is still unclear.

* Renzi has started the Europe tour by visiting Hollande in France, apparently finding some common ground in trying to get Europe (read Germany) to change the tune on austerity. On Monday he'll go tell the tale to Frau Merkel.

* The newly minted defence minister is considering cutting the notorious F35 orders, and maybe closing down a few hundred military installations.

* Berlusconi, despite having been convicted and banned from offices, is considering not giving a fuck and candidating himself for the European elections, since it would be undemocratic to keep a beloved leader from his electors. He'll probably try forcing the issue to play the martyr part.


* Beppe Grillo, the 'inspirator' of M5S, the ""fuck all politicians"" party of web-democracy that got almost 25% of the votes, keeps kicking out all the elected MPs that even vaguely hint at not agreeing with him. The kicked out people are now basically free for the picking by other parties, while Grillo himself is now looking for allies in the xenophobic and secessionistic Lega Nord, who also would like to ditch the euro, to gain momentum for the European elections.

* One of the 'nice girls' of Berlusconi's entourage was caught at the airport coming from Venezuela with 24kg of cocaine in her suitcase, when she somehow skipped the security check. 

* Pot is now legal in medical therapies. ",0,1395015629,null,0,false,0,cg4csn0,t3_20jplo,t1_cg4csn0,t3_20jplo,null,1432937930,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

true,lukeatlook,POLA,Polandball can into cultural relevancy,"&gt; Poland has been more active

It's everyone else being active, mostly.

Poland starts small in a shape similar to how it looks today. It expands south-east and allies with Lithuania, reaching about 1 000 000 square kilometres of area. The borders are constantly contested by pretty much everyone, including even Sweden.

The timeline is a bit off, Poland gets partitioned in 1795 (such is life) and that moment of reappereance was during the Napoleonic conquest in 1807. Poles, seeking independence, sided with Bonaparte; guy even made it into our national anthem ""Hymn of Polish Legions in Italy"". Unfortunately the guy decided to invade Russia. It's not that invading Moscow is impossible - Poles have done that before, eventually giving Russians their own Independence Day - it's that staying for the winter there was doomed to fail.

Pre-XIX century Poland was a mix of three major ethnic groups - Poles, Lithuanians and Ukrainian Cossacks - and many others, such as Jews and Tartars. After WW1, Poland reappeared, as both Russia and Germany were weakened: Russia was in Bolshevik chaos and Germans have lost the war, enabling a quick uprising that was enough to liberate their part. The problem was the border with Russia, as Bolsheviks figured the best way to unite the society is to send it to war in 1920 to introduce Europe to communism. Poland said ""No, thanks"" and repeled the invasion at the last stand in Warsaw. With no power to push the Russians further, our marshall was unable to liberate Kiev and Minsk from Bolsheviks and implement the idea of Ukrainian and Belarussian nation states as a security buffer.

Then, gues what, 1939. Post-WW2 Poland got handed by the West to Soviets, who, after already killing all high-ranked military officers and intelligentsia, decided to purge the remnants of the democratic government and artificially moved the Polish border, literally moving people from one place (Vilinus/Wilno, Lviv/Lwów) to another (Breslau/Wrocław, Stettin/Szczecin). Poland lost twice as much land as it gained, but 17% of civilian population died in WW2, so overcrowding wasn't an issue.

Then the anonimous observers vanish into obscurity.

As for the actual observing when you are dealing with situations like this (electoral commissions in post-Soviet countries that are skilled at vote rigging) you need at least 2 men per polling station to grasp what's going on and at least 5 to have a high chance to notice and record all serious irregularities. Provided they are working as a team, that is. Otherwise they are useless. If they are not trained they are useless as well.

true,timoleon,FRNK,Franken,"&gt;eine neue Wehrpflicht sollte generell für jeden gelten, unabhängig vom Geschlecht 

Würde eine Verfassungsänderung nötig machen, was selbst mit der großen Koalition nicht so leicht wäre.  

&gt;es sollte sich um eine Basisausbildung handeln, nicht um eine Wehrpflicht von z.B. 1,5-2 Jahren. Bei Interesse kann eine weitergehende Ausbildung erfolgen.

Ob  eine Wehrpflicht von weniger als einem Jahr militärisch sinnvoll ist war schon wurde schon vor der Aussetzung/Abschaffung sehr umstritten. 

Spezialisten für schwierigere Aufgaben, z.B. bei Instandsetzung und Wartung, elektronische Kriegführung, oder taktische Aufklärung kann man damit kaum gewinnen.

&gt;Jedem sollte selbst überlassen werden ob er/sie den Dienst direkt nach dem Schulabgang oder gar nach einigen Jahren Berufserfahrung ableistet.

So ab etwa 25-28, mit eigener Familie, begonnener Karriere und finanziellen Verpflichtungen hat man wohl andere Prioritäten als eine Zeitlang Soldat zu spielen. 

Die Truppe anderseits will eine verlässliche Grundlage für ihren Personalplanung. Selber entscheiden wann einrücken passt mit dem kaum zusammen.

&gt;als ""Ersatzdienst"" sollte ein Sanitäts-/Zivilschutzdienst eingeführt werden. 

Der klassische Einsatz von Zivis in der Vergangenheit ging eher in Richtung Pflegekraft und universeller Hilfsarbeiter denn Rettungssanitäter. 

Letzterer Beruf ist psychologisch nicht jedermanns Sache und erfordert auch eine intensive Ausbildung. Von der Verdrängung hauptberuflicher Kräfte auf dem Gebiet abgesehen.

true,wirebutterfly,UNSA,United States of America,"I wrote this on another thread. Legally the referendum is meaningless. De facto, it's putting lipstick on Russia stealing Crimea from Ukraine.

Ukraine, the ~~nation-state~~ state, has military bases and strategic interests in Crimea. It means Crimea legally is the property of the people in Kyiv and L'viv and Donetsk and Simferopol too, the people of Ukraine as a whole. Crimea doesn't belong to the people living on it, it is the property of Ukraine. That's why separatist movements don't work out generally. See: Chechnya as one in a billion examples.

Crimeans don't have the legal right to walk away with the assets of Ukraine. According to the law, that referendum is illegal and non-binding. That's not how it works, but that's what Russia plans on doing. They told the military they could leave the bases without weapons. Those bases do not belong to Crimea.

What Ukraine plans on doing to defend its own strategic interests, we shall see. At a minimum, if Crimea becomes part of the Russian Federation, Russia should be showering them with huge cash payments, and that's not even a good trade.
