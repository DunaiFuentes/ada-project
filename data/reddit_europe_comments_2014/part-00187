Yes, you're agreeing with me. I don't know who you're arguing with.

&gt;Committing crimes that violate the rights of others, and the laws meant to stop that, are nowhere near comparable to laws that enforce a dress code.

That dress code interferes with French law which states that faces should be visible. Therefore, it should be banned, no matter how tied it is to religious beliefs. And whether or not the ban violates the rights of women is an *extremely* grey area. Sure, many Muslim women choose to wear that, but *many* Muslim women are forced to wear it against their will.

&gt;Instead now they are just isolated and kept away from other men allowing even more Islamic culture to set in.

So what you're saying is that in order to approach the tight-knit Muslim communities in France, you should let them violate French law due to their illegal religious dress code, so that they are not angry at France anymore, so that maybe, eventually, they'll start liking French customs and become more secular? How do you not realise that conceding to religious lobbies is a one way street? That giving them more religious rights will only serve to increase their radicalism and their fervor? This should stop now. They either adapt or leave.

Plenty of laws violate a persons rights, just because something is law doesn't make it right or just.

Its not grey, if the woman chooses to wear the Burka there is no violation of anyone's rights. If she is forced to wear it by someone else, than that is a violation of her rights. 

A woman's body is her property, I am not even a feminist yet I understand that.

true,Shotgun_Sentinel,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; The french law could easily be interpreted as constituting a freedom for women to not be subject to a cultural phenomenon of islamic law. Even if they wish to wear it , they're the product of a religion that discriminates against women and violates their freedom to express themselves.

If someone else makes the decision for you, that isn't freedom. No matter how you rationalize it this is not a win for freedom, but of people scared of losing their culture because they don't have the balls to fight back themselves.

&gt;Fact is, neither of them is right or wrong. It's apples and oranges.Continental interpretations differ significantly on many legal issues from the american,and anglo-saxon ones. Even the continental interpretation is not all the same,but with many differences to each country and the historic / cultural background of the country.

No actually the government is wrong on this one, because they have no place making a decision for the woman.

&gt;You say the French do not like freedom. They will say that they are promoting freedom with that law. Fact is, each see freedom as something different and in through a different lens.

Through fucked up logic they think that way. Forceful imposition of your believe system is not freedom, no matter how benevolent you believe it is.

&gt;My point with the american view above is that the french, and continental countries, do not view ALL politics, and particularly in this case what constitutes freedom the same way, and therefore his comment is a bit out of place and he has very little understanding of the context of this law. The same way european citizens have very little understanding of US politics (unless they can claim some expertize on the subject,and vice-versa for US citizens on european politics).

Its simple, many in Europe think that your right to vote gives you domain to make decisions for others. That isn't a different brand of freedom, that is fascism. When the votes turn against you, you will wish that democracy didn't have so much power over peoples lives to cause such injustices.

&gt;As a last point to the other comment the guy had. Europe being part of the free world. Every time I have heard this empty political propaganda rhetoric I thought it was either a) pre-1990 and during the cold war or b) said with a humorous intent. Every rhetoric like that, bringing democracy, freeing people, making their lives better, etc. is inherently flawed as it's subject to different interpretations that will always vary to a large extent even from one individual to another.

Promoting government that gives everyone an equal chance to find happiness, through liberty isn't flawed. Supporting *fascism* is another kind of fucked up though.",0,1404257912,null,0,false,0,cim622c,t3_29ju3u,t1_cim622c,t1_cim5659,null,1434506595,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

However, the anglo-saxon / common law approach towards this has been the most intolerant of all. It's almost as you take offence if someone has a different view than you and you have to have your own way,or else it's wrong. There is no option of both be right , or let's agree to disagree.

What are you talking about, there is no ""right"" way to impose non-universal morality. No person should have a tolerance for tyranny/fascism. I am not intolerant, the people who support and enforce this law are.

&gt;The US has a large amount of laws on clothing in public that limit individual freedom too, if you're going to make arguments like this at least don't be hypocritical about it. Why can't I be naked in public? It's actually quite similar to this. The same way I can't be fully covered in public as I can't be fully naked.

Its unsanitary, and that can and most likely will have and effect on people *physically*.

&gt;Here again. I get annoyed with your argument. You come from a country that has the death penalty. 

You are like the Dane, I am not a nationalist, and I know my country has its faults. That doesn't discredit my points like any other form of ad hominem wouldn't.

&gt; Your government literally has the power of life and death over people,subject to criminal limitations of course, but you argue about a clothing regulation.

You want to talk about ignorance towards ones politics? The US is 50 states all with their own correctional systems. Most states haven't executed a person in years.

&gt;If you wish to argue about what power government has and what power it does not have, factually government has absolute and full power over every individual in accordance with the social contract. Any limitations that are put on governments are put because it agreed to have them,and that's what a constitution is. French society can freely decide for themselves what power they give their government and what power they don't.

Most European countries allow far too much control over individuals, and borderline have zero protections of inalienable rights.

&gt; This law was passed through Parliament and it was upheld by the French Constitutional Court and the ECHR. It's clearly not in violation of any French constitutional law, international and european human right treaties,etc. It's clearly not seen as a violation of human rights or freedom by people very qualified and competent to rule on this.

European constitutions are weak to the point where they have little power to protect anyone from government over reach. Its alarming how unfree many of the people in the EU countries are.

&gt;Spare me. You have more rights in every european country than you do in the US, as an individual. Even Russia gives its citizens more rights.

Of course our constitution doesn't give more rights than European countries, that's because our bill of rights isn't a granting document, but a restrictive one that restrict the government on which rights it can't touch. There are 27 amendments, and a few of them protect multiple rights at once.

&gt;Try and get it through your head that other countries have different understanding of what constitutes freedom and liberty. What and how their society should work , and how it works best.

Once you get to Spain, you would be required to show a much smaller amount in a Spanish bank account to prove that you can sustain yourself for one year and apply for residency. Remember: the visa is what you apply for at your designated Spanish embassy in the US to enter the country correctly (i.e. not as a tourist); residency is what you must apply for once you have entered Spain under the correct type of visa. Once you have residency, all of your renewals happen within Spain.

Thing is, there are multiple ideas on what communism and socialism encompass, but the very definition of the words require the means of production be put in workers' hands to manage. Apart from the early Soviet Union where soviets were given most of the power, this was not the case. A centralized state apparatus acting in the workers' case does not socialism make. So I can say it isn't socialism.

And fascism is defined by the idea that anything is justifiable if it benefits the nation state, and common characteristics include emphasizing class collaboration rather than class conflict, state capitalism, authoritarianism and nationalism. In essence, all the Soviet Union ever achieved was replacing one class that uses workers for its own profits (the owner of a traditional firm) with another (the state and its bureaucrats). All in the name of advancing Russian interests over others - since they screwed over anarchists both in Spain and in the Ukraine in their conflicts as well.

It wasn't socialism, and it was certainly closer to fascism. Actual socialism would give the workers greater agency in the management of capital such as factories than they currently have or did in the USSR, it would be internationalist rather than exclusionary by relying on the bullshit idea that is Socialism in One Country.

true,Shotgun_Sentinel,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; I've done courses on comparative international law,including comparative constitutional law. My personal opinion is quite the opposite. I find that the anglosphere has a great deal of unfair laws (some of which are frankly quite draconic) and citizens have a very limited amount of rights.

Explain how, as we do have unjust laws as anywhere does, we have legal documentation which can overturn those laws through the courts. Instead of having to change majority opinion.

&gt;I don't know what your qualifications are,but a large degree of people agree with me on this subject.These people tend to study european law.There is a disagreement almost all the time when I talk with people that have studied in common law and come from common law countries. The same disagreement in interpretation almost always comes up, and this is where I'm coming from.

It doesn't matter how much you understand European law, as what I am saying is that law is fascist. There is no rationalizing that away.

&gt;To an extent, I can agree with both views and sympathize with the two approaches.That was my point really, both can be right at the same time.

Imposing your will on another that is doing nothing physically or tangibly emotional to you is never right.

&gt;However,,the way you're arguing this makes it absolutely clear that you are completely oblivious to european civil law and to an extent to europe in general. You're absolutely unwilling to even comprehend that someone might think differently,and that they are not wrong.

There is a right way to do things, and that right way is to respect the rights of others, no matter how uncomfortable and inconvenient. Europeans have shown they lack the discipline to do that.

The fascist faction of the Movimento Nacional in Spain was isolated before the 50s, effectively wiped out in all but name. I know leftists like to throw the word fascist around as much as possible but it should at least be saved for people who have actual fascist politics, not populist/right-wing parties that are opposed to immigration (which funnily enough as a little tidbit of trivia, Franco wasn't, his entire personal bodyguard was made up of African Muslims, many of whom were granted citizenship and took Spanish wives after supporting Nationalist Spain during the Civil war). And the Spanish dictatorship was itself a reaction to the brutal, murderous left wing terror sweeping Spain during the republic.

There are also video recordings of all debates in the chamber, all debates in Westminster Hall, all (I think) select committee hearings, and probably more.

The Portuguese parliament has an official website where they post transcripts, but there isn't a platform like Votewatch or TheyWorkForYou. It's a shame, because these platforms are very useful.

As for me calling people names, I just said I found what eurosceptics are campaigning for to be hypocritical. Last time I checked, that isn't an insult, I never thought some would find that offensive. I'm sorry if you felt in any way I insulted you, it really wasn't my objective. I also didn't (and don't) know what your views on the EU were, I was just commenting on an argument I've seen mentioned very often in this sub.

Anyways, to expand on what I was saying (so you don't just think I'm insulting people without knowing what their reasoning is), I know eurosceptics believe heads of government have more legitimacy than MEPs (and I can understand where they come from), and as such want the Council (and thus the national governments) to have the most power. But then many campaign against the fact that most things in the EU are agreed behind closed doors, when the main reason such discussions are done behind closed doors are because those heads of government in the Council (that they want to give more powers to) want it to be so. This doesn't make sense, as the reason that happens is exactly because the Council isn't democratically accountable - the heads of government individually may be, but they can do whatever they want in the Council, and the electorate will never know! And then to argue against giving powers to the actually democratically accountable, transparent institution in the EU - the parliament - in favor of the Council makes even less sense.

From my perspective, those views are mutually exclusive. Either you want the EUParl to have more power, or the Council. There are plenty good reasons for either of them, but if you pick the least transparent one (and the one that's not democratically accountable to the electorate) you shouldn't complain that the EU isn't transparent.

Though, those views simultaneously actually makes sense if the objective is to demonize the EU as most as possible, and the easiest way is by sabotaging any attempt to fix the power balance in EU institutions - for example the Commission's president election. If take this far enough, for example by getting tabloids to propaganda against the main candidate for the job, calling him ""arch-federalist"" when Barroso is probably as federalist as him, you might actually get moderate politicians from parties who are sinking in the polls - for example a head of government - to campaign tooth and nail against that person in the hope it wins them back votes. Therefore, I'm not in the least surprised when populist parties use such (flawed) argumentation.

I just try to justify the ""lack of transparency in the EU"" further than ""the EU isn't democratic"" to find a way to fix it (instead of just wanting to end the EU), and the conclusion that the Council is a huge cause of that isn't hard to arrive at. It's hard to support giving power to the Council once you come to that conclusion, unless you want the EU to be even less transparent - therefore I call hypocrisy on anyone that does so. In a way I'm also an eurosceptic (I think the current setup in the EU institutions is undemocratic) but if something is wrong, I try to fix it first instead of dismantling it completely.

This is why I like to informally call eurosceptics ""eurocynics"" or ""euro-pessimists"" (as they believe that was is wrong will never be fixed, so it's better to chop its head off as soon as possible), and europhiles who don't like the current state of the EU as ""euro-optimists"" (as they believe that what is wrong can and will be improved, we just need to keep working on it).",0,1404272048,null,0,1404273337,0,cimbyyr,t3_29jo9u,t1_cimbyyr,t1_cimb7fs,null,1434509555,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,GlobalTumbleweed,null,null,"American here who has applied for (and received) a Spanish non lucrative residence visa - which is extremely similar to the retirement visa. In fact, I didn’t even realize they were two different things until this afternoon.

1. If it's the same as mine, it will need to be renewed. First they will affix a short term visa into your passport (3 months) - this will serve as your visa for entering into Spain. However, after you enter (within the first 30 days) you must register yourself in the town you’ll be living in (empadronamiento) and with the local police to receive your official Residence Card (this will looks rather similar to a US license.) The first residence card will be valid for 1 or 5 years (i think, that’s what someone told me when I was doing mine. However, I did not know how long it would be granted for until I picked it up). 

2. When I received mine I was told that I may not stay indefinitely in another European country. I cannot remember exactly how long it is that you can stay in one country at a time but I think it is 3 months per country at a time, but I can’t find any paperwork to confirm that. It was just part of a conversation I had with someone. However, since they don’t stamp your passport when traveling between Schengen countries, I’m not really sure how they’d know…

3. You can travel freely within Spain and other Schengen countries while applying. However when you present yourself to the police within 30 days of arrival be sure you have an entry stamp for your most recent trip. So if you travel to Spain for a week (receive an entry stamp), fly back to the states and pick up your approved paperwork, then head back to Spain be sure you receive a second entry stamp. I had a police officer question how long I had been in the country since he didn’t immediately see my second stamp.

4. I had no income when I applied and just showed savings, investments, etc. It wasn’t a problem.

5. What you’re looking for re: translations are Certified Translations. I’m unsure where you live, but there were 5 to 10 companies that offered certified spanish translations in my city. A certified translation will come with a cover sheet of sorts that will be signed by the translator certifying (!) that it is a true translation and not an interpretation, etc. A company has to be licensed to do this, so don’t just go with a friend who speaks Spanish fluently. If I remember correctly the certified signed sheet will also be notarized. They aren’t incredibly expensive, but on the other hand they certainly aren’t free. For 20 pieces of paper plan for a few hundred dollars.

6. I don’t believe they will tax you. I haven’t been… hmm

7. I did all of the paperwork myself and it wasn’t too difficult (it just took awhile). However I have had friends who have used CIBT Visas for visa help in the past. So you might want to check them out. Additionally, for the FBI background check/fingerprints that you’ll need, a lawyer could certainly help you out with that but again it’s not too difficult - just time consuming!

What matters is that you begin to find vocabulary that was part of your DaF class repeated in whatever media you're getting through.  Slowly you will discover that you're able to recognise more and more.

The worst bit of self deception I pulled on myself was saying for a year that I wasn't good enough to read or watch the things I was interested in and I wasn't interested in the things that I could understand.  I don't think there is a point in spectrum of German leaning before which everyone agrees that watching or listening to German language media is bad idea or pointless waste of time.

I get that listening to German when you aren't fluent can be frustrating... Doubly so for dubbed content, as the mouth movements don't match the speech and when they're shoving 10 seconds of German where there was 5-6 seconds of English.

One thing you could try is listening to the [News in Slowly Spoken German](http://www.dw.de/deutsch-lernen/nachrichten/s-8030). 
Personally, I found this much more understandable and much more tolerable.  As a bonus, because it's a podcast you get new content everyday in 'bite sized' pieces. 


If you like news and that sort of content that produced live for local TV &amp; Radio stations there are **huge** quantities of reasonably well produced free (gratis) content floating around the web.  Basically you are only limited by your internet bandwidth.  Moreover, because most of this stuff is news, political analysis, or similar, the accents of the commentators is pretty comprehensible across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland (Sports being a notable exception).

Anyway, TL;DR: Don't worry.  Keep Watching, Listening, and Reading German. Understanding &amp; Fluency will come.",0,1404280902,null,0,false,0,cimf2rc,t3_29lqhl,t1_cimf2rc,t1_cimcq14,null,1434511537,3,false,German,t5_2qq51,3

That's part of his condition. He doesn't really understand other people or empathy. From what I understand medication may work on him in some sense. 

There's no ""manipulation"", medication and therapy may free him of his delusions. He may suffer the realization that his worldview was wrong, his actions unjust and horrific, but it's primarily about containment.

&gt;  IMO human rights shouldnt apply to the likes of Brevik. 

No, they should **doubly** apply to someone unworthy of our sympathy. Especially, if they're considered ""evil"". That's the key to a society *ruled by law*, not mercurial leaders or angry lynching mobs. Laws apply absolutely, to everyone, no matter what they did.

&gt; 500 years ago he would have been physically tortured and mutilated so much that would beg for death, which would have been an example for anyone else trying to murder 80 kids.

Yes, as a former student of law, I have learned a lot about the bloody traditions we have here in Europe. 

Your understanding of the relationship between crime, punishment and prevention is entirely outdated and factually incorrect.

The proof is in the pudding; no amount of torture or capital punishment has ever reduced or prevented crime! We study the historical justice systems at University and in science (criminology); there is **no effect** what so ever. Your sense of ""justice"" is entirely unrelated, it's a basic emotional reaction.  

A justice system is designed to replace the need for personal retribution and blood vendettas, the state punishes criminals without the need for emotions. 

- Interestingly, ""an eye for an eye"" was a Jewish *tort* rule (monetary compensation), not an actual right to retaliate.

Norwegians are satisfied with our justice system by and large - and even the survivors/victims of Breivik are content to see him languish in prison.

No. Is it the same as banning veils/burkas? No, it isn't. As I said, there's a difference of degree, of the amount of exposure. I think even women who presently wear a veil would agree with that. Muslims might accept a ban on veils but they would probably go ballistic WRT a ban on covering women's breasts.

&gt;We aren't all homogeneous.

Depends on which attributes you look at, and how much you squint your eyes. Hiding your face is practically non-existent in the public space and not part of mainstream culture anywhere. If I can't see your face my first (European) instinct is to wonder why you are hiding something that doesn't need to be hidden. It also feels like a disruption of the common means of communication. And then there's the whole religous aspect to burkas, how much it reveals about the way certain muslims think about women: the sexual paranoia of the men, the women's disdain for non-muslim men's perceived inabilty to respect ""immodest"" women.

I think Karl Popper expressed it best:

&gt;Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. 

&gt;In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols.

&gt;We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.

2. Atto di notorietà (a document issued by an Italian consul in your country, or by a notary, that states there are no impediments to the marriage)

I think the main issue is that before a marriage can take place a publication is needed (i.e. the personal details of the of both the bride and groom to be need be published both on the website of the municipality where the marriage takes place and and/or physically affixed in the municipal building). The marriage can take place starting from the 4th day following the publication (it expires in 8 days).

true,jimmy17,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;No. Is it the same as banning veils/burkas? No, it isn't. As I said, there's a difference of degree, of the amount of exposure.

I also agree that the degree is different but why is it that where we draw a line in the sand is fine and where they draw the line is wrong.

[This](http://www.southworld.net/newtest/images/stories/12-10/Culture/Mini3.jpg) culture probably wouldn't mind a breast covering ban and some muslims have been very distressed at the thought that there is now a law banning them from dressing modestly. I'm not talking about women who a forced to wear coverings but women who choose to. The thing is I don't think this law has very much, if anything, to do with protecting women (I mean you don't protect women form domestic abuse by making it illegal to be hit). If it was we wouldn't be removing women's choices to dress as they choose and criminalising them if they are forced to cover their faces against their will. Nope, this is good old fashioned racism.

&gt;Depends on which attributes you look at, and how much you squint your eyes. Hiding your face is practically non-existent in the public space and not part of mainstream culture anywhere. If I can't see your face my first (European) instinct is to wonder why you are hiding something that doesn't need to be hidden. It also feels like a disruption of the common means of communication. 

Whilst this is true I would say that our hard fought for freedoms are more important than our cultural relationships to a pice of clothing. Banning people from wearing certain pieces of clothing because it makes you uncomfortable is against the very core of the free society I think of as being Europe. And frankly it's pathetic if people are so fragile they can't get over their initial prejudice on the matter.

&gt;And then there's the whole religous aspect to burkas, how much it reveals about the way certain muslims think about women: the sexual paranoia of the men, the women's disdain for non-muslim men's perceived inabilty to respect ""immodest"" women. That way of thinking about human beings is simply incorrect.

Again, the same for breast covering that [these women](http://www.southworld.net/newtest/images/stories/12-10/Culture/Mini3.jpg) would probably find a ""simply incorrect"" way of thinking about human beings. I could probably expand that to being fully nude in public. When are we going to start the ban on dick and vag covering?!

TDLR: Just because we draw the modesty line somewhere else in the sand doesn't make us right and them, not only wrong, but horrible misogynists. And I would have thought a more important aspect of European culture is tolerance of diversity given how different we all are and how those differences have torn us apart before now.

What kind of reputation this university holds, esp. in Computer Science, when compared to others like TuM, TuB, RWTH Aachen or other reputed German universities (reputed esp. outside of Germany)?


Reputation is mostly irrelevant in Germany, since all Universities have very high standards in German, which are regulated by laws. We don't have the same bandwidth of Ivy League and Mickey Mouse Colleges the UK, US or India has. There are some rankings published in Germany, but they are more than bogus (read: esoteric bullshit). So you don't have to worry. 

Regarding Jobs: German Universitäten train scientists, not workers. The theoretical level is pretty high, especially in math courses in Uni. Be prepared. Besides that, with a MSc in CS you will get a Job. But your Visa status might be a problem for an employer. 

&gt; Do German universities offer some kind of RA/TA to MS students? (I don't speak German as of now)

What is a RA/TA?

&gt; Part time job possible (even if allowed)?

Possible and allowed, I worked as a sysadmin at my Uni when studying CS/EE. 

However, check your Visa status.

Then in the last two decades of the 1800's alone, a whopping 25 million European immigrants poured into the US. Only a tiny portion of whom were Protestant ""Anglo-Saxons."" Most were Irish, Italians, Germans, Poles, Russians, Hungarians, Greeks, Jews... This surge in newcomers caused a panic amongst native, white Protestant Anglo Americans. This panic pumped new blood into the KKK. This is KKK 2.0 and KKK 2.0 was more nativist than racist, (they targeted white, European immigrants). The patriotic wave of WWII (a pro-unity, ""were in this fight together"" wave) along with increased pressure from the Feds, swept away KKK 2.0


KKK 3.0 swept into being as a back lash against the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's. They wanted to ""keep blacks in their place."" Again, KKK 3.0 came about at time when white Southerners felt like they were losing power (the federal govt imposed civil rights on the south). KKK 3.0 faded away as well.

Today there is a KKK, but it's full of legit weirdos and has no influence. The other 3 ""real"" KKK's actually had a good deal of political power.",0,1404293826,null,0,false,0,cimhuae,t3_29ml3d,t1_cimhuae,t1_cime67q,null,1434512430,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Other programmes (eg. Psychology, Economy) also have a high theoretical level, that's typical for a German Uni. However, CS and other engineering programmes have a lot of math to. 

I studied CS/EE and got kicked out of Uni after failing Math 3+4. Of more than 500 CS students, 400 failed or quit.

It's a norm we choose to uphold. I already explained why.

&gt;This culture probably wouldn't mind a breast covering ban

Those are not Europeans. Would they mind having to cover up their breasts if they chose to live in Europe? Would you then also ask these questions WRT a ban?

&gt; I'm not talking about women who a forced to wear coverings but women who choose to.

Do we know who those are? Can we see the difference between those who choose freely and those who don't? If they don't choose freely it's abuse, right? No matter which religion is involved.

&gt;this is good old fashioned racism

So you are saying that this is to oppress muslims? How does it oppress muslims?  How does this ban disadvantage them? And BTW, how is it not sexism if women are told that ""modesty"" requires wearing a burka that men don't need to wear?

&gt;Banning people from wearing certain pieces of clothing because it makes you uncomfortable

It's not about it making me feel uncomfortable. It's about a disruption of the public (European) space in a way that makes life harder for Europeans. Knowledge of identity improves interaction between people and is expected in every day life. Being able to read expressions from peoples faces vastly improves communication and is expected in everday life.

&gt;When are we going to start the ban on dick and vag covering?!

As soon as covering your dick/vag is seen as oppressive, I guess. Why aren't you protesting for people's rights to go nude everywhere? Isn't such a ban on total nudity just as grievous in your eyes?

If 5 percent of the people want to commit murder with few legal remification (things like 'honor-killings') is the 95% majority wrong in banning such practices? 

Or, a less hyperbolic and more appropriate analogy, if I as a Dutchmen would claim that I should be catered to in Dutch while living in Romania, I'm an idiot. 

The reason I used this example is because after religious resentment, which is probably an important factor in the whole circus about this casee, is that humans need to be able to communicate with each other. Our most important and well developed sense is our sight. Facial expressions are the most important part of day-to-day communication, especially so in Western societies. 

A lot of people have trouble and are unnerved by a burlap sack talking with a muffled voice, which is what these women appear as. This is okay when these women stay at home or just drink tea in a local park, but it becomes detrimental to basic Western communication when these women are in schools, hospitals and shops even. 


Secondly is the religiosity of the veil: Western Arabists/Islamists etc would say that it is not a religious prescription because it is not in the Quran. It is mentioned once in the specific context of the wives of Muhammad, but it isn't explained further. Even most Muslim Ulama would argue that even though a headscarf is considered 'admirable' it is not 'prescribed', and full-face covering is certainly not a prescription. This means it can be subject to national laws, and in laws where a majority isn't muslim you should expect the majority to not accomodate every little whim of a muslim minority.

true,jimmy17,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;It's a norm we choose to uphold. I already explained why.

More so than the norm that we allow people to choose how to express themselves?

&gt;Those are not Europeans. Would they mind having to cover up their breasts if they chose to live in Europe? Would you then also ask these questions WRT a ban?

No, they aren't. But I was choosing them as an example to show that covering breast is also restricting women's choices in the name of modesty so you objection to the veil is incredibly hypocritical and disingenuous and leads me to believe its a result of racism rather than women's rights.

&gt;So you are saying that this is to oppress muslims? How does it oppress muslims? How does this ban disadvantage them? And BTW, how is it not sexism if women are told that ""modesty"" requires wearing a burka that men don't need to wear?

Many muslim women find it an appropriate way to dress. It oppresses them by restricting their ability to dress as they choose. It's quite simple.

&gt;It's not about it making me feel uncomfortable. It's about a disruption of the public (European) space in a way that makes life harder for Europeans. Knowledge of identity improves interaction between people and is expected in every day life. Being able to read expressions from peoples faces vastly improves communication and is expected in everyday life.

We don't ban people from using sarcasm, or pulling faces, of from wearing makeup that obscures their identity. We don't mandate that people only use video phones because facial expressions are so important. We haven'e even banned anonymous web discussions. If anonymity is so offensive to European sensibilities why are you using a pseudonym on reddit? Why aren't you calling for a ban on anonymity on the web? After all ""Knowledge of identity improves interaction between people and is expected in every day life."" No, oddly enough the only thing that has been banned is the one thing that is culturally relevant to muslims. I wonder why.

&gt;As soon as covering your dick/vag is seen as oppressive, I guess. Why aren't you protesting for people's rights to go nude everywhere? Isn't such a ban on total nudity just as grievous in your eyes?

How do you know what I am and aren't protesting? The fact is, I think public nudity *should* be allowed. People should be free to choose to cover it as much or as little as they want.

&gt;Do not include every possible form of behavior.

Obviously, but I would have thought the freedom to choose your own clothes isn't really that outrageous.

You make a distinction between the antifa label and actual anti facism and the fact that you're able to do that and even type one as typically violent when they should be roughly one and the same has already ruined the image and will likely continue to do so as more moderate anti-facist activist will shy away from the group even though they might still comprise the majority of said group..

Anonymous fueled with the initial concept of internet freedom, privacy and a speck of hacktivism got in the news with fucktards and scriptkidies doing it for the luls or to be edgy and I wouldn't be surprised if that's what they mostly are now.

In the UK, we don't really have a principle that religion is a private matter. The head of the state is also the head of the Church of England.

We do have the principle that all citizens are equal before the law in the UK. The UK courts recogise the decisons of abritration tribunals in certain circumstances and sharia courts (as I understand it) are simply just another type of arbitration tribunal. In this way, muslims are treated in no different way from arbitration tribunals set up by other interested groups (e.g. Christians, or atheists, sports professionals, trade unions and so forth). In my mind this is supremely liberal: allowing consenting individuals to make arrangements that suit them best with the state only interfering where necessary. 

However, if you have a precise example of citizens in the UK not being equal before the law, I would be interested in seeing it. ",0,1404297810,null,0,false,0,cimii0p,t3_29ju3u,t1_cimii0p,t1_cimidgb,null,1434512763,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Empirically you need metrics to measure with, baselines and controls to reference against. In this case, I don't think you can say that ""empirically"" this or this quite yet, maybe decades later when we'll have enough data to do statistical analysis.

I'm a bit more from the East, but still EU, thank you :)

Two weeks ago I was flying home from Warsaw and I've seen two ""Moroccans"" (or maybe they were from Tunis, anyway) argue a bottle of Jack Daniel's through security. It was a glorious moment for envy and respect!

&gt; And statistically how many cases do that mean ?

I don't know, after all, they are kept indoors, and it's not like evil fathers just self-report how many daughters they are hiding. And who knows how many women has been raised like this in France.

Yes, and that's a good thing.

&gt; With that law it's not them who have to risk saying it but the volunteer trained man in blue with body armor and a tazer, who can and is paid to risk it.

Does the French police actually enforces this? Or it's left for schools and other institutions where it was a problem before?

The food tends to be of high quality, the majority of the bars and restaurants try to compete with the famous pintxos of San Sebastian, so they put a great effort to make the best food possible. You can find a bad place to eat, but it's rare.

&gt; Is it a nice place to live? 

It depends on your definition of nice, it's a secure, friendly and boring little town of the North of Spain with lots of small parks and gardens. But that's only the external appareance, if you get immersed in the social life of the city it can be incredibly fun and diverse with lots of activities, but you must make the effort and actively look for it and know some people, otherwise you get the small boring town.

&gt;Is there a good nightlife/social scene? Or will I get bored?

Definitelty there is a good social scene but you must look for it, make some friends, get involved in local activities, we love music, eating and drinking, the scene is not going to just appear in front of you, you must find it but it's very easy to do it :)

&gt;Have any of you lived there or do you currently live there, and if so, do you regret it or wish you could go back?

I've lived my whole life here, so I can tell you that if you are a loner you are going to have a hard time, so make friends and you will never regret it :)

They are not deceiving their voters. They are not pretending to voters that they will achieve their task from within the EP. However, by winning the EU elections in the UK, they have effectively put huge pressure on the Westminster Parties and made a Brexit more likely.  One of the main reasons why Labour, Conservative and Lib Dems were all forced to oppose Juncker was because UKIP won the EU election in the UK. We're now seeing huge pressure on Lib Dems and Labour to change their positions on a referendum. Voting UKIP in the EU elections was rational: it made the acheivement of a political objective more likely. This is democracy.

&gt;__Mission Control__, formerly __Exposé__, is a feature of the [OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X) [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system). First previewed on June 23, 2003 at the [Apple Worldwide Developers Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Worldwide_Developers_Conference) as a feature of the then forthcoming [Mac OS X v10.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.3),  Exposé allows a user to quickly locate an open window, or to hide all windows and show the desktop without the need to click through many windows to find a specific target. Exposé was replaced in [OS X 10.7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_10.7) by Mission Control.

Also, the plan is for the two to mutually recognize the other side’s rules on financial regulation, and allow e.g. European banks to operate in the US on EU rules – giving competitive edge to whichever has the most lenient rules.

According to the website itself it only says that they(the EU side) would like a cooperation between the two to make sure that regulatory operations of one side do not negatively affect the other. You can make what you want out of that portion.

But that doesnt sound like it would ""give an edge to lenient EU regulated banks""

The troops put the infant lord in a basket and hung the basket in a tree to encourage them. From there, the boy urinated on the troops of the Berthouts, who eventually lost the battle.

&gt;Another legend states that in the 14th century, Brussels was under siege by a foreign power. The city had held its ground for some time, so the attackers conceived of a plan to place explosive charges at the city walls. A little boy named Julianske happened to be spying on them as they were preparing. He urinated on the burning fuse and thus saved the city.

In German this type of brake is called a ""Rücktrittbremse"" (roughly: ""backwards kick brake""), and on conventional bikes (i.e. non-fixies) it's perfectly legal. It's actually quite common in Germany, mainly for children's and low-end adult bikes.

Edit: On re-reading, I realize I may have misunderstood the question: If it's actual backwards *pedaling* (as opposed to kicking back to activate the brake), then it's ~~neither common nor street legal over here~~ rather uncommon.

Yup, Murrica.

&gt; when did you learn your first language? 

Started with Spanish in 7th grade, did that up until I switched to German in 11th. 


&gt; when did you learn german? 

11th grade till now. I continued in college. 

&gt; how long did it take till you got the hang of it?

Not sure if you can set a point where you can say you've got the hang of it. Depends on your definition of that--is it when you can watch a TV show in the language? Order a pizza and give your life story? Read a book not written for kids? Defend a Master's Thesis? You never stop learning, and the longer you learn, the more you realize that there's still more to learn. I've been living in Germany for 9 years now and still learn new things all the time. 

&gt; i haven't been brought up around different languages so it will be really hard for me to learn. 

The only reason it would be hard for you to learn is because you will not be completely immersed in the language and culture. There are things you can do, but there's really no substitute. If you are really serious, a semester or two abroad will be absolutely essential. I would say it would be good to build a bit of a basis before you come, because otherwise you'll be too tempted to switch to English as soon as you get stuck trying to say something.

true,drakeisatool,DENK,Denmark,"I often hear people in Denmark talk wistfully about the overtaking culture on the Autobahn; here it seems like a lot of the time people get trapped behind other cars when they want to overtake.

There are a couple of reasons for this - people are not so willing to switch into a slower lane because:

* They are driving the speed limit anyway (according to their speedometer) and thus nobody should be overtaking them

* You tend to get trapped in the slower lanes because there will be a row of cars passing you slowly, and this row tends to be replenished from the back as faster cars join the row. So if you get trapped behind i.e. a truck you will stay there until there are no more cars coming up from behind.

Basically, the duck-in-to-let-a-faster-car-pass-then-go-back-out-to-continue-overtaking approach doesn't work very well here, so people don't use it. (I use it if there's someone riding my ass because I know they will pass quickly. I can really recommend this approach to getting rid of tailgaters).


Then again, I've seen some shady overtaking happen on the Autobahn, and it seems that every summer there's inevitably *Stau* because some guy crashed his car spectacularly, usually causing a truck with a trailer to flip over and end up blocking multiple lanes.

Also, being a passenger in a car with a driver who doesn't switch lanes fast after overtaking on the Autobahn is a pretty harrowing experience D:",0,1404304709,null,0,false,0,cimk0ek,t3_29k87v,t1_cimk0ek,t1_cilsgd0,null,1434513768,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

”Before the session begins, you must get on your knees and worship the EU and accept that it is the greatest nation the world has ever known, even greater than Great Britain!”

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, nationalist dual-UKIP/FN champion who had served 15 years of duty in the EP and understood the necessity of border controls and fully supported all opt-outs from the EU treaties stood up and held up a banana.

”How straight is this banana, pinhead?”

The arrogant MEP smirked quite gypsy-like and smugly replied “not at all, you stupid libertarian.”

”Wrong. It is straight. If it was bendy as you say… then it should be banned now.”

The MEP was visibly shaken, and dropped his manuscript and copy of the Ventotene Manifesto. He stormed out of the plenary chamber crying those continental crocodile tears. The same tears continentals cry for the “poor” (who today live in such great conditions they don't even die in trenches any more) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the virtuous northern countries. There is no doubt that at this point our MEP, Jean-Claude Schulz, wished he had not been a statist and become more than just a government parasite. He wished so much that he could lock himself alone in his office to hide his embarrassment, but he himself had abolished all borders including closed doors!

The other MPs applauded and all registered UKIP that day and accepted Nigel Le Pen as their dear leader. A bulldog and a rooster, both coincidentally named “Nation State” walked into the room and together pissed on the European flag. The EU treaties were burned several times, and Putin himself showed up and broke up the EU.

There are uni jobs e.g. [here](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/stellenangebote-studentische-und-wissenschaftliche-hilfskraefte/184520.html), pay will be higher of you already have an undergrad degree. You'll be able to find more uni jobs (teaching, sysadmin, others) through personal contacts once you are there. The pay isn't that high compared to a ""real"" job.

A part time job outside of uni with more than 450 EUR/month will only be possible with the right [Visa](http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/EinreiseUndAufenthalt/LernenUndArbeiten/ArbeiteninD_node.html); but if you already have a bacchelors degree, you should be able to get it. Apply early enough, Visas take time.

Average [rent in Göttingen](http://www.wohnungsboerse.net/mietspiegel-Goettingen/4544), if you get a WG (Wohnungsgemeinschaft = shared flat, shouldn't be to hard with that many students) it will be cheaper than renting a flat on your own. [Total cost of living, estimated](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/lebenshaltungskosten-in-goettingen/54664.html) (use Google Translate).

You should have a got a contact address when you received the admission; write an email and describe your financial situation (including the need to pay education loan back in the US) and plans, they might be able to give you better advice, or even have the knowledge to secure a suitable job for you.

There are still obstacles though. I don't even think our own soccer league is broadcasted on tv. How are we supposed to sustain interest when the sport isn't even televised? And when it comes to improving our talent, there really isn't a clear path of going pro, as there is no male soccer league at the university level (and our universities are basically our minor leagues for every sport).

For example: In 2013 the number violent crimes in germany motivated by far-left political tendencies rose by 40 %, up to 8.673 incidents. In the same time, the number of violent crimes by far-right political tendencies declined by 3,1 %, up to 17.042 incidents.

I would assume that most far-left incidents were perpetrated by AntiFa members, since AntiFa is the most known far-left organisation.

So, in that regard, supporting AntiFa in such a way is not becoming for a MEP.

* Freedom to travel and work abroad, which mean both an end to our half-century of isolation and the possibility of self-development abroad (Erasmus, work abroad). I have traveled a lot, and still remember being denied Schengen Visa. Now all I need is an ID card, and I'm held up at the border for maximum 2 minutes. Also, I plan to live/work in Western Europe in the future, and that's way more easy than it used to be.

* The symbolic aspect of being in the ""European Family"" once again. You have no idea how much this means to us after being trapped behind the Iron Curtain for half a century.

IN A country struggling with rampant corruption, a weak judiciary and unstable government, the Bulgarian banking system has consistently won praise for its stable institutions, high liquidity and low risk. In the past few weeks that system has come under attack in the worst run on banks in 17 years.

The central bank said runs on First Investment Bank (FIB) and Corporate Commercial Bank (CCB), the country’s third and fourth largest lenders, in the past two weeks were part of a “deliberate and systematic attempt to destabilise Bulgaria's banking system”. According to the authorities, criminals tried to disrupt the system by sending e-mails and text messages urging people to withdraw their funds from several large banks.

The banking crisis was made worse by political instability. Bulgaria's political parties recently agreed to a snap election and the Socialist-led government of the prime minister, Plamen Oresharski, is expected to resign soon. Mr Oresharski’s cabinet was in power for barely a year, plagued by street protests demanding its resignation and by a controversy over the South Stream gas pipeline.

The attackers’ plot seemed to work, at first. On June 27th, rattled depositors withdrew around €400m ($547m) from FIB in a matter of hours. A week earlier, the central bank took control of CCB after customers rushed to withdraw their savings unnerved by media reports about one of its owners.

While CCB remains closed as the authorities are devising a plan to save it, FIB resumed operations on June 30th. Over the weekend the authorities appealed for calm and arrested several people suspected of orchestrating the attack. Also on June 30th, the European Commission approved a request by the Bulgarian government to extend an emergency credit-line of €1.7 billion to local banks.

“The Bulgarian banking system is well capitalised and has high levels of liquidity compared to its peers in other member states,” the Commission said in a statement  yesterday. “For precautionary reasons, Bulgaria has taken this measure to further increase the liquidity and safeguard its financial system.” Bulgarian banking shares climbed sharply yesterday, led by FIB whose shares rose by 24.6%. Queues were still forming outside branches of FIB, but they were visibly shorter than on June 27th.

According to Georgi Angelov, senior economist at the Open Society Institute in Sofia, the reasons for the crisis are not systemic. “The banking system is stable--the liquidity is very high and it has one of the highest capital-adequacy ratios in Europe, at about 20%,” said Mr Angelov in an interview. He explained that the situation in Bulgaria was not like in Cyprus where the banks were bankrupt and that the Bulgarian problem came from outside the banking system.

Last week anonymous e-mails, social-media posts and mobile-phone messages were sent to FIB customers, fanning fears about the safety of their deposits. Bulgarians have bitter memories of a grave financial crisis in 1996-97 when 14 banks went under in a little over a year, so they flocked to the bank branches. After they withdrew around 800m lev (€400m) in a few hours, FIB said it had to close operations over the weekend.

On June 29th Bulgaria’s national security agency said it had so far arrested six people suspected of involvement in the attack. One of the e-mails sent by one of the suspects, released by the authorities, said that other banks, including Italian-owned Unicredit, “are in very bad condition and even a small percentage of withdrawals would push these institutions into bankruptcy. Deposits of citizens will be sacrificed or lost to save the Bulgarian economy.”  The e-mail concluded with a proposition: “In connection with these facts, we have an attractive offer how you can protect your money.” It is unclear who ordered the attack on FIB. Bulgaria’s authorities have launched a criminal investigation.

The run on CCB had more obvious reasons. On June 20th, Bulgaria’s central bank put CCB under supervision and suspended its operations after more than 20% of deposits were withdrawn in a week causing a liquidity crunch. The reason for the run on the bank was a public spat between Tsvetan Vassilev, a businessman and the bank’s largest shareholder, and Delyan Peevski, a controversial businessman and member of parliament for the ethnic Turkish minority party, DPS. Mr Peevski, who is said to have built his family’s media empire with loans from CCB, claimed in media statements that Mr Vassilev planned to kill him. Mr Vassilev denied this and, in turn, accused Mr Peevski of sending him threatening text messages.

CCB is due to open again on July 21st, according to Bulgaria’s central bank, which has begun delving into the lender’s accounts and has appointed independent auditors to find out what went wrong. If rescue talks fail, Bulgaria plans to nationalise CCB. Despite these banking woes, Bulgaria managed to sell €1.49 billion of ten-year government bonds on June 26th, attracting strong demand from international investors whose bids more than doubled the amount on sale. The 2.95% annual coupon was the country’s “lowest ever” in an auction, said the finance ministry.",0,1404310127,null,0,false,0,cimlvs9,t3_29n0wv,t1_cimlvs9,t1_cimku1o,null,1434514655,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

The burka and the niqab do not allow people to express themselves. They are a hindrance to self-expression.

&gt;But I was choosing them as an example to show that covering breast is also restricting women's choices in the name of modesty

I never said European culture was perfect. Just better.

&gt;Many muslim women find it an appropriate way to dress.

You didn't answer my question. How do you distinguish between the women who want to wear a burka/niqab and those who are forced to do so?

&gt;We don't ban people from using sarcasm, or pulling faces, of from wearing makeup that obscures their identity.

Those things do not in everyday life obscure people's identity. They also do not hinder their self-expression. They also do not symbolize some sort of ""modesty"".

&gt;We haven'e even banned anonymous web discussions.

Anonymous web discussions don't involve high trust interactions and muslim women do not aim to be anonymous. They aim to present a particular person not a random stranger, which is harder (or even impossible) if you hide your face. Again, a burka or niqab stops people from expressing themselves adequately.

&gt;The fact is, I think public nudity should be allowed.

That's because you are not a muslim. Frankly I'm proud that we are even having this discussion in Europe, that we can have this discussion without fear of persecution. We are concerned with other people's freedom in a way many muslims would find absurd.

&gt;I would have thought the freedom to choose your own clothes isn't really that outrageous.

In general, it's hard to argue against that. There are only specific cases like wearing a police uniform or wearing a disguise that would lead people to believe that you are someone else. A burka and niqab do have the potential for the latter. It would be an interesting experiment to have everyone - men and women, muslims and non-muslims - wear a burka and see how society would fair under such a level of anonymity.",0,1404311677,null,0,false,0,cimmjor,t3_29ju0h,t1_cimmjor,t1_cimidcs,null,1434515156,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

AFAIK, there is at least one peaceful Antifa: the one in Poland.

&gt;__Irish coffee__ ([Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): *caifé Gaelach*) is a [cocktail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail) consisting of hot [coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee), [Irish whiskey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_whiskey), and [sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar) (some recipes specify that [brown sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_sugar) should be used ), stirred, and topped with thick [cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream). The coffee is drunk through the cream. The original recipe explicitly uses cream that has not been whipped, although drinks made with whipped cream are often sold as ""Irish coffee"".

That's kind of ridiculous. Self expression is not self expression if you disagree with what it's saying? 

&gt;You didn't answer my question. How do you distinguish between the women who want to wear a burka/niqab and those who are forced to do so?

You don't. I grant you it's not perfect. But criminalising a piece of clothing because some clothing may be worn as a result of domestic abuse is like criminalising sex because some sex is rape. It's ridiculous. All you are going to do is isolate the abused women in question now anyway as I imagine their controlling husbands will start to restrict them leaving the house.

&gt;Those things do not in everyday life obscure people's identity.

They can do.

&gt;They also do not hinder their self-expression.

Again, you have no idea of what freedom of speech means if you think it only counts when you agree with it.

&gt;They also do not symbolize some sort of ""modesty"".

We don't ban clothes because of how the symbolise modesty. We don't ban long skirts because they are considered more modest than short skirts. Of course people dress modestly if they choose to do so. You seem to have no respect for women's rights to bodily autonomy if your argument is that women shouldn't have the right to dress as modestly or immodestly as they like. They can only dress in the range that YOU define as appropriate.

&gt;Anonymous web discussions don't involve high trust interactions and muslim women do not aim to be anonymous. 

But you were saying that they could be used to obscure identity. You seem to be jumping around here at this point. Also no one forces you to take part in these high trust interactions. A bank can feel free to ban face coverings if they choose. Being in public is hardly a high trust interaction.

&gt;That's because you are not a muslim. Frankly I'm proud that we are even having this discussion in Europe, that we can have this discussion without fear of persecution. We are concerned with other people's freedom in a way many muslims would find absurd.

That is true. I agree that it's good we can have this discussion.

I don't think you are a racist or anything. I will admit I have a lot of sympathy for what you are saying. But honestly I am very uncomfortable with banning an aspect of another culture because some people in society don't like it. Not only that, but I think that doing it in such a way that restricts women's choices to dress as they choose and criminalises and isolates women who are abused is very wrong.

true,ArttuH5N1,FINL,Finland,"It indeed is. But like I tried to explain, I think it wasn't the banter that caused the ""hate"", but the direction it was coming from and the sudden nature of it.

The English, Argentinians, Germans etc are probably very used to this banter and especially having banter with these other usually very football enthuastic countries. Now suddenly there was a huge influx of Americans trying their hand at football banter. And because there was so much banter suddenly coming from this unusual direction, some probably took it as arrogance, rather than banter. And it doesn't help that some Americans got really arrogant about it. Not even in a playful manner.

One cause for the ""hate"" might've also been that because there are so many Americans on this site that the ""AMERICA! AMERICA!"" shouting and banter from them became very overwhelming and caused other fans to ""hate"" the US team simply because it was so popular. (And Reddit must've felt like a ""hostile"" place because of it, causing some to take an unusually hostile attitude towards the US team.)

And then there's always the newcomer hate. ""The new kid is trying to get in on *our* game. Ugh.""

&gt;__Cartographic generalization__, or map generalization, is the method whereby information is selected and represented on a [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map) in a way that adapts to the scale of the display medium of the map, not necessarily preserving all intricate geographical or other [cartographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography) details. The cartographer is given license to adjust the content within their maps to create a suitable and useful map that conveys [geospatial information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospatial_information), while striking the right balance between the map's purpose and actuality of the subject being mapped. Scaling hierarchy or far more small things than large ones is found to be a universal rule for cartographic generalization .  The scaling across all scales has some implications and applications to statistical mapping,   cognitive mapping,   and perception of beauty.

If its a culture of fascism then yes, I have no tolerance for tyrants.

&gt;It's amazing how much you cannot comprehend cultural differences but insist on respecting other people's culture,as long as it's your own (not even your own culture, but your own opinion).

I comprehend the difference, I just think its a moot point when that difference is the right to impose unnecessarily on another person. You want me to just accept that difference. The problem is I don't accept tyrants in my life even if it is the cultural norm.

&gt;The same way government does not allow you to be naked in public, it does not allow you to be fully clothes as well. How is one perfectly normal and the other fascist?

I already told you, full nudity is seen as unsanitary, and that *does affect other people*. In the US at least when your actions begin to affect others more directly, they are no longer sanctioned.

&gt;The logic behind this law is that the niqab represents an violation of the individuals rights and a threat / danger to the person wearing it. 

So it is about protecting an individual from themselves, and not because it affects others in society. It sounds like an unjust violation of the rights of the wearer. Unless someone else is forcing that person to wear or not wear the niqab, than there is no violation, and the protection is just a rationalized imposition of another's will.

&gt;The reason why it's an issue for someone to wear it may be diverse,such as religious oppression, forced to wear it against their will,women's right violation ,etc.

Then stop the people who are forcing them to wear it, don't counter that in a lazy and fascist way, by doing the opposite.

&gt;Personally, I think that it blocks sunlight, which is of a great amount of importance for mental and physical health.

That's their consequence to deal with so long as it is their decision to wear the niqab.",0,1404314520,null,0,false,0,cimnuv7,t3_29ju3u,t1_cimnuv7,t1_cim89oo,null,1434515955,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

By the way, don't worry about the grave accents (è, ò), if you can't speak Catalan everyday, it's pretty hard to know when to write them. With the rest of the vowels it's a bit easier (it' always à, í and ú), but don't worry.

And thank you very much for learning both languages and integrating with locals.

And this is how it should be. It's one of the major improvements with the system - they actually have to win the votes across the political spectrum, instead of only the biggest having a voice.

David Cameron’s claim to want to keep Britain in a reformed EU has lost most of its credibility, both at the Brussels summit table and, presumably, at home. The Tories left the EPP five years ago, and with the admission of the German Eurosceptic party AfD to their faction they have now burnt the bridge back to EPP.

true,my_baby_ate_dingos,FRAN,AUX AAAAAAAAAAAARMES CITOYEEEEEEEEEEEENS!!,"You're putting words in my mouth, accusing me of being something I'm not really, and being mighty aggressive while you're at it. Let me explain.

I am not against the minimum wage. I am not against a higher minimum wage than the current level. I do not believe it should be set at a higher level than this right off the bat. The increase should be organic, following inflation, ensuring purchasing power remains at least constant with yearly (or more, or less, depending on the economic situation) increases.

If the wages were to be increased all of a sudden one day, it would have two effects. The first is to eat into companies' profits. Let's say the minimum wage is raised all of a sudden from €290 to €600. A company employes 20 minimum-wage workers at €290. Not only to they have to raise those 20 people's salaries to €600, but also the salaries of every person on their payroll that makes less than €600. That could be half the company, for all I know.

You'll say, most companies can afford it. That depends on the company, but for the sake of argument, let's say it's true. A company's goal is still to maximise profits, and seeing such a drop in profit alongside such a rise in disposable income from their consumers, they will raise prices accordingly. Purchasing power will drop overnight to pre-increase levels or close. 

The same happens with self-employed people (say, shopkeepers) who aren't salaried but dependent on what they sell. If they didn't raise their prices, they would find themselves hugely behind in terms of revenue. Their prices will follow the income just as quickly. 

There is also the risk of what is called ""Demand Pull Inflation"". If prices fail to rise as quickly as the salaries, the increased disposable income will cause consumers to rush for suddenly-affordable products. If supply can't keep up with demand, bammo! runaway inflation. Which leads to wage inflation, another potential harmful effect.

Conversely, if you keep the minimum wage to a slow increase, making sure purchasing power AT LEAST stays the same or ideally increases slowly, you can control for runaway effects on the economy. I am 100% for brokered minimum wages per sector, first because they are BROKERED, meaning both sides push and pull until a middle-of-the-road solution is found, second because they do not affect all workers in a country.",0,1404318437,null,0,false,0,cimptuo,t3_29nbmo,t1_cimptuo,t1_cimp340,null,1434516950,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

Oddly, most US fines dont make international headlines. It has fined financial institutions over $100 billion since the crisis. JPMorgan has paid $25 billion in the past two years alone. It has probably been the most aggressive developed country when it comes to penalizing financial institutions, but the general sentiment is the exact opposite. 

&gt;It's a shame that such documents need to leak to be readily available for some public scrutiny

It is a double edged sword. Much of the reason these are done behind closed doors are so special interests dont get a say in what is going on. Can you imagine the cluster fuck these negotiations would be if all of the US, EU, and European national level lobbyists were hounding the negotiators each night after they left? No international agreements would ever be signed. This way, officials can negotiate the actual issues without risking interference (besides general presentations in parliament/congress, etc).

Greece is going to enter the biggest Economic Boom in its history starting in 2015, Only because we are in the EU. And why/how is that you may ask?

It is very simple . . Greece has been chosen to be the Energy and Shipping Hub of the EU . .this would be impossible if we were not in it. 

Over the last year, Greece has signed deals to build 3 Pipelines . . from Azerbaijan&gt;Greece, Israel/Cyprus&gt;Greece and Greece&gt;Bulgaria. These pipelines were only allowed to be built to Greece because we are the Entry point into the EU. If we were not in the EU, no such deal would ever possibly be made. When combined with Gas/Oil reserves in Aegean Sea this will make Greece the energy HUb of the EU. 

Chinese Prime Minister visited Greece last week and signed a number of deals to make Piraeus Harbor(Athens) and Thessaloniki Harbor(North Greece) into the ""Gateway of Chinese Good into the EU"" and the Chinese PM said these two Ports will be ""The most competitive on Earth""

Again this Shipping deal which will make Greece the Entry POint of INvestment and Shipping from China to Europe would not be possible without the EU.

Most purcahses people do undergo background checks. There are a couple loopholes, namely gun shows and private purchases, that people can sometimes get around this. Many states have closed these loopholes, but some have not. 

The thing is, over 90% of Americans support universal background checks, and almost 90% of gun owners. 

&gt;I have a hard time understanding why this basic thing is so hard to implement.

An NRA endorsement goes a long way for a politician. Even though the Senate is majority held by Democrats, many still need a high score on the NRA's rating scale if they are from conservative states (or districts in the house). If they propose any regulation they risk losing points on the NRA rating scale. Even though the vast majority of gun owners support universal background checks, they will see a low rating and assume the politician is anti-gun ownership. 

I own guns, but refuse to become an NRA member because they take such a ridged stance on changing regulation (even changes their members support).

They are people, but your view of fascism is too harmless. The quote at the end of my post explains this a bit more

&gt;They want it now (**99% movement**) and they did so in 1917.

Absolute bullshit. They don't want the *death* of bankers, they want a revolution and the overthrow of the financial and capitalist systems. You'd lose your job, sure, but the Occupy movement has no intention of murdering bankers.

&gt;In a healthy democratic system anyone has right to express their valid view point, while murderers are persecuted for the factual crimes they commited.

Not if you want the democratic system to survive.  It's known as the Paradox of Tolerance, and it's why *absolute* tolerance doesn't exist in any modern country in the world despite your idealismThe philosopher Karl Popper put it pretty well and is quoted [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper#The_paradox_of_tolerance)

&gt;*Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.* – In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.

This is pretty much what I said. Where possible we should use other means, and violence is not necessarily the best solution to this, but I'm not going to condemn those who do use violence to protect themselves and their communities from fascists in what they feel is a last resort.

The existence of fascism within a democracy threatens democracy itself. Anarchism exists to promote *more* democracy. This is why I don't see anarchists as being the same kind of threat: anarchists see the current capitalist system as a *threat* to democracy, and that the state exists to prop up this capitalist system: therefore the purpose of overthrowing capitalism and the state is for *more* democracy, greater liberty, and equality. Any anarchist will tell you they value those things, and if they don't it's because they're an ancap who reject the last of those three but aren't really anarchists anyway. Fascists and anarchists seek to overthrow *different things* and for *different reasons*. Fascists are happy for capitalism to continue, and they're happy for the state to continue to exist as a coercive force; but only so they can destroy democracy and liberty for their vision of some 'superior' nation and a 'greater good.' The details of the positions matter hugely.

[Even John Rawls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance) doesn't take tolerance to the conclusion you take it. Society has a reasonable right to self-preservation from intolerance; fascism fundamentally threatens society's continued existence as a democracy 

&gt;""While an intolerant sect does not itself have title to complain of intolerance, its freedom should be restricted only when the tolerant sincerely and with reason believe that their own security and that of the institutions of liberty are in danger.""",0,1404322388,null,0,1404323421,0,cimrwpx,t3_29ligv,t1_cimrwpx,t1_cimr890,null,1434518214,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

This is not true if your are not Danish. Foreign labor in Denmark is being exploited by low or even unpaid wages. The labor unions are completely useless if you ask them for help and because there is no minimum wage set by law, you cannot sue the employer. It goes against the rules of the global capitalist economy, that people in Denmark must be payed relatively very high salary compared to the rest of the same (EU) labor market for doing the same work. It is impossible for Danish companies to compete on the market (both home and foreign) if they have relatively too high salaries and therefore ask too high price for their products/services.

[Tougher penalties for social dumping](http://cphpost.dk/news/tougher-penalties-for-social-dumping.9011.html)
&gt;Mette Frederiksen (S), the employment minister, wants to prosecute employers who pay foreign workers wages lower than legally allowed in Denmark.

&gt;Employers are conjuring up phony pay slips to hide the underpayment of workers from eastern European countries, according to the trade union 3F. By under-reporting the number of hours worked, companies create the impression that they are following the rules.

&gt;“When you cheat foreigners on their wages, it is unfair competition with companies who want to comply with the rules,” said Frederiksen.

&gt;However, representatives from the Danish construction industry called the problem “widespread” and said that very few companies that employ foreign workers are living up to the letter of the law.

[Transport minister blasts postal service for social dumping
](http://cphpost.dk/news/transport-minister-blasts-postal-service-for-social-dumping.9811.html)

&gt;The transport minister Magnus Heunicke has openly criticised the national postal service Post Danmark for using eastern European labour via distributors that pay well below Danish wages.

&gt;**Post Danmark has admitted that 10 percent of its transport services are performed by distributors who employ foreign drivers who are often paid a quarter of what their Danish counterparts get.**

The burka not only is an expression of support for the view that men are inherently predatory, but also it is an expression of support for an authoritarian, dictatorial religion. Many of the doctrines of the religion are murderous in nature and, thus, the burka could be seen as something of an expression of hate speech.

&gt;I do not recognise the right of children to see faces.

Countries such as Ireland protect the rights of children in this regard in public education. The grounds are developmental; young children educated with a lack of facial interaction are psychologically disadvantaged. The rights of children in this regard are prioritised above the right to freedom of expression of someone wearing a burka.

&gt;In the case of slaves who opposed abolition

Sadly, there were a very large number of slaves who opposed abolition largely as a result of unending oppression and indoctrination. They were brought up to believe that their worth was equivalent to that of beasts of burden. They claimed that it was right that they were slaves. Despite their claims that they were not being denied fair treatment, their rights should, of course, have been recognised.

The products are the most expensive in Europe and in general everything is expensive ([energies](http://cphpost.dk/news/private-consumers-face-huge-green-energy-bill.9815.html), rent, owning a TV). The services you get from the tax funded budget are mediocre at best, because of non-existent competition, bureaucracy and lots of holidays. Take for instance the public hospitals, many companies pay extra for private hospitals, because the public ones have too long waiting periods or mistreat/misdiagnose their patients too often.

Denmark cannot sustain it's current high tax socialist model, because in order to pay high taxes you need to sell expensive products and services. Given that Danish market is small (cca. 5.5 million people), it has to sell products outside of the domestic market for competitive prices. This competition drives the wages down also for domestic products/services, no matter how high taxes Danes pay.

Anyway, you're entitled to an ID card, a driver's license, and a passport.

The ID should be done ~~within minutes at the office~~ I actually have no clue right now with the new formats, the passport might take a month, while you have to book and pass theory and practice exams for the driver's license.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt; Well then that depends if you place a ""superiority"" on cultural diversity.

Yeah I certainly don't. I don't care one way or the other. I think people do this because people are always searching for reasons to demonstrate that their culture is superior. I am almost certain that if America was 100% homogeneous, we would laud being homogeneous over being heterogeneous. But since we are not, we celebrate diversity. Maybe its just a part of human nature to demonstrate superiority over others by flaunting any feature that they can that differentiates them from other groups. I don't know why people do this, it is infinitely annoying.

As for this Judge Jeanine lady, and this video (which I cannot watch since I am at work, but did look up the text of this video), all I can say is I have no idea who the fuck she is, and have never heard of her. It's a pretty bad reflection of us to see someone talking like that, but I all I can say is most people here do not watch fox news, or cnn or msnbc. I am guessing that this is mostly a character, a persona she adopts when on fox to drum up ratings however she can. I read her bio, she appears very well educated and should know better. She almost reminds me of Ann Coulter, who is highly intelligent but deliberately spouts inflammatory bullshit to attract attention. As for why people like Jeanine and Ann do this, and willingly act out these personas, I have no idea. Ratings are ratings I guess.

&gt;If you flipped it on it's head and there were russian broadcasters talking about other countries going ""bomb them and keep bombing them!"" that shit would be played 24/7 to the backdrop of the russian national anthem and the soviet sickle.

Almost certainly. That's why I don't really consume mass media to begin with. It's entirely ratings oriented instead of content oriented. You gain little from watching such programs except heart problems. Once again, I wouldn't really put too much credence or importance in what is said in media. You could find more nuanced and less inflammatory opinions going to the local bar and starting up a conversation with the guy next to you. And that is probably a better insight into how most people think than by watching media that is intentionally sensationalized.

Juncker was the democratically legitimate choice and there was little that Cameron could do to combat that. 

The big problem the UK has with the EU is how it is treated by our politicians and media. Cameron went on and on about how if Juncker was appointed it would be harder to keep Britain in the EU, though I imagine most people within the UK had not even heard of Juncker before their votes were cast because of the absolutely awful standard of media in the run up to the elections, and the terrible campaigns of the major parties to garner votes. The EU as a whole would be seen to have a far smaller democratic-deficit if our politicians and media actually informed us on it rather than using it as a scapegoat.",0,1404327714,null,0,false,0,cimuogb,t3_29nd4g,t1_cimuogb,t1_cimu9ag,null,1434519940,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,MrRSterling,SWIT,Switzerland,"There are no significant independence movements but there are some cultural differences. The culture of each of the of the regions leans towards the culture of its respective big brother (Romands -&gt; France, Ticino -&gt; Italy and Swissgermans -&gt; Germany). This cultural differences often become obvious during our federal votes, where the frennch ~~and the italian~~ parts tend to be more left leaning and EU friendly than the german parts. Also, the german speaking part is a bit bigger and economically a bit better off than the others. But as all regions are doing very well on a global scale, this isn't much of a problem most of the time. But of course there is a lot of joking between the regions, like in any other country as well. There are several reasons I see as key for why there are no big difficulties between the language regions. 

The Swiss political systems is very federalist, giving each canton a lot of autonomy. This prevents that one language region feels suppressed or exploited by the others (see Spain, Belgium). 

Also, it is an unwritten rule that there are members of multiple language regions in the national government. 
 
Furthermore, in almost all cantons it is mandatory for students to learn at least one other national language (besides the mother tongue and english). This surely helps the cultural understanding among the de regions. 

Lastly, the Swiss have a certain sense of ""we against the others"", rooting in its history of fighting for independency from diverse european super powers. Even though many leftists and also historians would discount that as histrocial myths, I still think it adds to the cohesion among the regions.

&gt;First. Having interrupted the truce, President Petro Poroshenko made a dramatic mistake. This will lead to new victims, but now he will be personally responsible for them.

&gt;Second. It will be much more difficult to resume negotiations. Such are the laws of war.

&gt;Third. On 27 June, Ukraine signed the Association Agreement with the European Union. This is Ukraine’s right. Russia has the right to switch to new terms of dealing with Ukraine to protect its market. A decision on protective measures will be made after consultations. The Russian Government is analysing the current situation. It is also drafting a plan detailing our actions under the Agreement on CIS Free Trade Area and WTO rules.

&gt;Fourth. Ukraine does not pay for gas. Its debt is enormous. It takes gas from underground storage facilities. A full-scale gas crisis will unfold by autumn.

&gt;Fifth. There is a huge flow of refugees. Tens of thousands of them. People are fleeing from the war. US propaganda claims that they “go visit their grandmother.” There is no limit to cynicism.

&gt;Under the circumstances, it will be very difficult and, on some issues, impossible to develop relations with Ukraine.

Blague à part, il faut s'interroger sur le ""pourquoi on a jugé ça difficile"", et je reviens à une réponse que j'ai déjà donné : la réforme du lycée (faite l'an passé, donc tu y as échappé) a orienté notre façon de faire apprendre les choses, en se focalisant sur les leçons d'applications (lois normales à la calculatrice, algorithmique), et en passant à la trappe les exercices de réflexion (géométrie dans l'espace, similitudes, etc.). Du coup, là, un exercice de réflexion, ça fait tout drôle.

2/ Je vais donner un exemple d'un truc qui s'est passé au CA dans mon collège cette année : nous avons été fouettés par l'inspection académique parce que le taux d'élèves de notre bahut qui passent en 1ere S est trop faible par rapport à la moyenne du secteur.

Autrement dit, qu'importe le niveau, tant que l'indicateur est bon. Et ça donne un (autre) travers général qui me font me sentir mal dans cette institution : l'indicateur (ou la case excel, au choix) a plus de valeur que l'humain qui est derrière.

Donc oui, on fait passer n'importe qui en S.

I think it goes against the very foundation of democracy to think like that. Making law should have no need to be interesting, people should be interested because it is relevant to them. I think that the EU generally *isn't* that interesting is also down to the fact that the subjects it legislates on aren't generally interesting to the public, which I think also says a lot about the extent of its powers.

Those in power in Britain reject the idea of the EU becoming a political union, but the response to that seems to be a condemnation of the EU instead of giving our population the news and information that would allow us to make our own choice.

It seems to be democratic in theory, if you assume that the European Parliament is treated in the same way in the minds of the public as national parliaments are. Unfortunately for federalists, it is largely seen as a throwaway vote where people decide to stick two fingers (or on the continent, one finger) to their government.

I don't believe that the people who voted for EPP parties had Juncker in mind. They might have had the leader of their national EPP-member party in mind, but a minority had Juncker in mind. Probably disproportionately many people had their spitzenkandidat in mind on this board, but I'm also not convinced this board is representative of every European voter.

The personal mandate of the Prime Minister *is* derived from the popular vote, it's just a technicality - the system works best this way in practice - that it's really the support of MPs that they need.

For example, during the signing of a number of deals last week between Greek and Chinese Prime Ministers, Greece signed a Multi-Billion Euro deal to export Greek Organic foods and wine/cheese/olives/etc to China . .and also signed deals to exponentially increase Chinese tourists to Greece, a vast untapped market with potential of 5-10 Million Chinese Tourists a year by 2030. 

Being in the EU is a GREAT thing, imo . .none of these deals would have happened without it. ",0,1404331047,null,0,false,0,cimwejf,t3_29n8mo,t1_cimwejf,t1_cimw4k4,null,1434520879,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

I actually do disagree, because I'm hesitant to say a candidate at EU level lacks mandate on the basis of domestic shortfalls. I do think some faults are at an EU level; for example the EU is really fucking complicated and that makes it difficult to really get to grips with it.

Priests of the Ukrainian Catholic Church who are not natives of Crimea will be allowed to serve in ministry for only three months at a time before leaving for a month and re-applying for admission. Catholics in Sebastopol, who had hoped for the return of their cathedral (which had been confiscated under Soviet rule), now doubt that the building will be returned.

&gt;The new restrictions are not targeted solely against Ukrainian Catholics. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kiev patriarchate, which challenges the dominance of Orthodox body loyal to Moscow, has found that the “rent” for its cathedral in Simferopol, the capital city of Crimea, has been dramatically raised.
