And who is going to decide what is ""bad"" or ""immoral""? Last time we countries deciding that on their own we two world wars. In Yugoslav wars that you referred to *every* side was acting for self-defined ""good"" reasons (throwing away Communist yoke, securing territorial sovereignty etc.). International laws and UNSC were established for a reason. 

&gt;You might find this to be an extreme example, but in Hitler's Germany a few people risked their lives and broke the law to save Jews. They were criminals and yet anyone with common sense will view them as heroes.

Anyone with a common sense will view someone risking the lives of their family, and their own, to save the life of someone else, as an idiot. Is it moral to throw away food when there are other people dying of hunger? Is it moral not to break in an unused home (there are millions of unoccupied homes in Europe!) because you're homeless? Laws exist to draw clear, not arbitrary, lines between ""responsibility to protect"" and ""throwing the planet into nuclear winter"". There are enough nukes to exterminate humanity many times over. Days of Pax Americana are drawing to a close, and with EU such a political joke at this state, it's impossible in practical terms to police the planet or propagandize its system of values globally. What is ""moral"" according to the billion of Westerns is not necessarily ""moral"" to billions of Africans, Asians etc. Chinese are *very* brutal - you can't even fathom to what extent - it is of utmost importance to set in stone the governing principles of international laws not based on ""might is right"" principle, as US and its bitches have been doing since the end of Cold War.

&gt;The only relevant question is whether it would have been better or worse if NATO had intervened in Rwanda. When intervention prevents another genocide then that is a good deed.

In the short-term. In the long term you set precedents, make international law breakable on the basis of arbitrarily defined ""moral"" reasons, and other big guys start do overthrow undesirable regimes as well, annexing ethnically close regions under excuses of minority abuse etc. I'm sorry for dead Rwandians and others - but this is the price of global stability. Needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.

Otherwise it will devolve into the incompetent kleptocracy of Yeltsin era. Putin may be running his gang and benefitting them, but at least he has a strong hold on the reins. 

Russia never had democracy and it will take a bit of time for it to take root. I predict that if Putin keeps the Russian economy growing steadily, in 10-20 yrs we might start having a chance.

2. Russia is allowed to have soldiers in Sevastopol, within confines of the military base. All troop movements must be agreed with defence ministry in advance.

3. Turchynov was elected speaker of parliament by members of parliament. Speaker becomes acting president if the elected president resigns or is removed from the post. In this case - president not fulfilling his constitutional duties and being absent for all practical purposes due to him fleeing the country. Yatsenyuk's interim government was nominated by acting president and approved by parliament (or the other way around, I don't remember). Andriy Parubiy was appointed by acting president as Head of Security Council, it is not an elected position. Oleh Tyahnybok was elected MP by Ukrainian people. Dmytro Yarosh currently doesn't hold any office in Ukrainian government or seat in any elected organs as per wikipedia and to the best of my knowledge. He noted that he plans on running for president, though, which is certainly within his rights if he can qualify as a candidate... After all, we have such illustrious figures as Dobkin running for the same post.

Ich bezweifle, dass der normale und zu recht besorgte Bürger etwas damit anfangen kann. Es gibt alleine schon eine Reihe von Einheiten mit denen man da beschmissen wird: Bq/s, Bq, Sv, Sv/h, Rem, Röntgen. Und dann noch so Sachen wie ""um 10.000 mal höher als der natürliche Wert"" um es schön schaurig klingen zu lassen. Ich habe ca. 2 Jahre kontinuierlichen Wissensinput gebraucht um mein Wissen im Bereich Radioaktivität (dem für den Katastrophenschutz relevanten Teil) zu festigen.

Ein Beispiel:
In den Medien kursierte damals dieses eine schöne Messergebnis von, sagen wir, 500mSv (es kursierten alle Arten von Messergebnissen, mit allerhand Zahlen, das hier ist nur ein zufälliges Beispiel um zu verdeutlichen was ich meine). Nun. Was können wir mit einem solchen Messergebnis anfangen? Alles was in Sv angegeben wird ohne weitere Inofmationen über die DAUER und ORT der Exposition ist wertlos. Es stand da einfach um da zu stehen und schick auszusehen und Leute zu verwirren. Die wenigsten werden ohne groß nachzuschlagen sagen können, was Sv überhaupt bedeutet.

Das beste was ich allerdings gesehen habe waren Statistiken von Deutschen Messtationen die kurz (Stunden) nach der ersten Reaktorexplosion veröffentlicht wurden. Hier war ein Graph zu sehen, der rapide anstieg. Grund zur Beunruigung? JAAAAA, laut Medien. Dass es sich dabei allerdings nur um eine Abweichung von wenigen Bq/s gehandelt hat (Zerfälle pro Sekunde in einem fest definierten Volumen - zum Vergleich, im Menschlichen Körper finden pro Sekunde ca. 9000 Zerfälle pro Sekunde statt). Das kommt immer dann, wenn der Luftdruck abfällt und Radongase aufsteigen und hat absolut nichts mit Fukushima zu tun. Aber für die Medien (vor allem Internetmedien) hat das gereicht um völlig Hohl zu drehen.

Analog zum Venedigreferendum kann man also Sagen, dass hier genauso mit bedeutungslosem Zeug Stimmung gemacht wurde. Ich halte sowas für sehr gefährlich. In der Ukraine kann sowas dazu beitragen einen Krieg vom Zaun zu brechen, wo keiner sein muss. Bei Fukushima haben Tausende giftige(!) Iodtabletten geschluckt, ohne sich vorher informiert zu haben, dass es nur wenige Stunden hilft, wenn denn radioaktives Iod in der Atmosphäre rumschwirrt.

It already spent $16 billion of dollar reserves defending the fall of the Ruble and this is fairly early on. That may not sound like a lot but it was in a very short time. Defending currencies against dollar/euro slides can be *very* costly. This is also happening in Argentina and Venezuela with little success. 

The ""they have energy"" argument helps, but it does not paint a full picture. Venezuela has more proven reserves than Saudi Arabia, yet its currency, the Bolivar, has seen a drastic slide against the dollar this year. The black market rate is 90:1, while the official rate is 6.3:1. 

Despite what people seem to think, Russia holds only 0.7% of US debt. Many seem to think China may back Russia to hurt the west/US with concerted asset sales. Russia approached China at the peak of the financial crisis and proposed dumping dollar denominated assets, and China declined. I think it realizes if it did that Western nations would no longer view it as a reliable trading partner and act accordingly. 

The former Russian Finance Minister is highly respected in Russia and he estimated US/EU sanctions could cause $100 billion in capital outflows per quarter. Even without sanctions capital flight has significantly accelerated after the Crimean action. 

Lastly, people suggest Russia would turn off the gas to Europe. Although I have no doubt it would try to manipulate prices to charge more, because Russia relies so much on income from Gazprom it would not really have a choice but to keep delivering, especially if sanctions were implemented. 

**TL;DR: Russia relies so much on energy exports it doesn't have the option to just turn them off. It does not own as much Western debt as it thinks to be able to cripple any markets. Its currency is depreciating rapidly in USD and EUR terms and capital is hastily leaving its borders. Western debt will be sold, but mostly as a defensive measure to try to ward off a recession.**",0,1395124348,null,0,false,0,cg5g1pe,t3_20p5lu,t1_cg5g1pe,t3_20p5lu,null,1432956756,50,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,50

true,nyshtick,UNSA,United States of America,"Honestly, this piece makes relatively little sense to me. The constraint here is not the United States being unable to spend money (Europe will likely pick up most of the burden anyway as they should). The money offered to Ukraine is chump change, especially if it's just loans or loan guarantees. So far, I think that the West's response is far too weak, but none of the appropriate actions are fiscal issues for the United States. Here are the problems as I see them.

1: For too long, the West has seen Putin as a potential partner. Both the Bush Administration &amp; Obama administration have failed on this front. Certain European leaders (Schroeder, Berlusconi) have been even worse. Some are now hesitant to turn their back on Putin completely.

2: The United States seems far more willing to go after Russia than the big Western European players. Of course, this is because American sanctions against top Russian officials and Russian industries would have no discernible effect on the U.S. economy and wouldn't put enough pressure on the Russians. To be effective, the sanctions must include the EU (France, Britain, Germany).

3: The aforementioned countries are hesitant to deal with the consequences of sanctioning Russia since doing so would hurt their economies. Germany wasn't particularly cooperative with the American led Iranian sanctions effort and Russia is far more important to the German economy.

4: Leaders today seem extraordinarily cautious. I wouldn't mind seeing some stronger language from President Obama &amp; other Western leaders. Come down on firm ground.

That being said, I think there is zero excuse for not putting sanctions on key oligarchs that support the Putin regime. Cut off their access to Western institutions. These people don't wish to live in the Russia they are destroying. Their assets are in Western banks, they live in Western cities, their kids go to Western schools. Putin isn't quite as strong as he seems.

true,chalne,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; For too long, the West has seen Putin as a potential partner.

I think it is really, *really* important to distinguish between Putin the Dictator and Russia the country. There is no (non-historical) reason why Russia and ""the West"" could not be partners, and work towards a common goal. The problem right now is that the leadership of Russia is serving it's own interests, and have been able to turn the public opinion in Russia around over the last ~10-15 years while Putin has been in power. 

Sanctions are the only viable way to go about this, as you say, put pressure on the people who are propping Putin up, and you will see change. Russia needs western trade a lot more than ""the West"" needs Russian gas/trinkets. Turning off the gas going into Europe will be a nuisance for Europe, but in turn it will be a catastrophe for the Russian economy, an economy that is already tanking due to recent events. Economic pressure will stop Putin's army long before shelling the soldiers will, and ""the West"" has yet to learn that entirely. Shooting at soldiers or people, who believe they are in the right (from being pounded by propaganda for years), will only serve to strengthen their resolve.

What we need is for someone to grow a pair and call Putin's bluff, accept that the cost of warming a living room will go up and be comfortable in the knowledge that Putin is hurting himself more than his perceived enemies.

But we need to be cautious, because we don't need the next leader of Russia inheriting the bad will of Putin, and in that way creating a new 50 year stand-off for no other reason than some asshole needs to save face.",0,1395130110,null,0,false,0,cg5h715,t3_20p5lu,t1_cg5h715,t1_cg5gmk7,null,1432957297,21,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,21

Fernsehen taugt für mich höchstens noch für Live-Sportübertragungen, wobei es dort ja immer bessere Streaming-Alternativen gibt. (Sofern man die Fenster zu hat und bei Toren nicht schon 10 Sekunden vorher die Nachbarn jubeln hört. ;) )

Obwohl ich Fernsehn oder Radio nicht ""live"" konsumiere (einschalte, wenn etwas ausgestrahlt wird oder zappe), finde ich den Rundfunkbeitrag dennoch sehr sinnvoll, da es eine von Konzernen unabhängige Instanz geben muss, die Informationen- und Kulturvermittelnde Inhalte produziert und veröffentlicht. Ob dies nun im Fernsehen oder Online geschieht ist zu Zeiten in denen JEDER Haushalt einen Internetanschluß hat egal.

Ich glaube, dass sich das Fernsehen immer mehr Richtung OnDemand entwickeln wird. Bleibt zu hoffen, dass dies auch die Rundfunkanstalten so sehen und nicht verschlafen oder sich selbst blockieren. 

Das Fernsehen wird vorerst jedoch nicht ganz aussterben. 
Natürlich muss man abends direkt zum Zeitpunkt der Ausstrahlung den Ausgang beliebter Serien/Sendungen/Sportereignisse sehen um am nächsten Tag bei der Arbeit/in der Schule mitreden zu können. In Zukunft könnte es nicht mehr der Zeitpunkt der Ausstrahlung sondern der Zeitpunkt des Onlineverfügbarmachens (Wortschöpfungen FTW) sein, der nicht verpasst werden darf.

Ein weiterer Pluspunkt für das Fernsehn ist das Zappen, bei dem man einfach abschalten kann und dabei ""zufällig"" auf interessante Inhalte stößt. Das ist ein großer Pluspunkt. Dies kann man jedoch auch im Internet ganz gut. Besonders hier auf Reddit kann man wunderbar Zeit verschwenden. :D

Da jedoch nicht jeder so internetaffin ist, wie wir extrem Web-Zwei-Punkt-Nullige Cyber-Menschen, bleibt sicher vorerst alles beim Alten.

Since the recession, the government has ringfenced pensions, the winter-fuel allowance, free TV licences and bus passes for all pensioners regardless of income. The needs of the young, meanwhile, have been ignored.


I guess young people should stop blaming their parents' generation for all their problems, they should go to univ,get a degree and get a job like their parents' generation and then buy a car,house and start a family.However they decide to be lazy and stay at home all day playing video games and then they expect elder's to cut their pensions for them, govt should not pay any benefits to the young as they are physically fit to earn for themselves . All the funds for youth should be added to the pensions as the elderly are the ones who really need govt help.

Résultat, on a des réseaux épars, mal fichus et mal connectés où il est difficile voire impossible de planifier un itinéraire cycliste. Le vélo ne vaut comme moyen de transport que s'il permet de se rendre le plus directement possible d'un point à un autre, sans avoir à faire de longs détours.

Un ami cycliste avait tenté il y a quelques années une grande balade de plusieurs jours au départ de son domicile dans l'Ouest parisien. Il n'a pu trouver qu'UNE SEULE route permettant de quitter Paris par l'Ouest - presque tous les axes comportaient à un endroit ou un autre des sections interdites aux cyclistes (voies rapides, tunnels, etc.).

Une solution pour l'avenir serait peut-être d'encourager le développement du vélo éléctrique, qui conserve un poids et un encombrement faibles tout en offrant un rayon d'action plus large et une puissance bienvenue pour escalader les côtes. Malheureusement, la réglementation européenne en la matière reste l'otage d'idées vieillotes en limitant la vitesse maximale (25km/h) et la puissance. L'avenir passe peut-être par de nouveaux véhicules légers, maniables et à propulsion hybride électrique/humaine  mais il n'y a pour l'instant aucune volonté politique.

&gt; We will propose to the creditors that they renounce 50-60 % of the Greek debt. It will be an appropriate solution for a deeply indebted country and the creditors. If our public debt continues to grow, soon there won't be any solutions to take and we will have to declare bankruptcy. In this case, the creditors would lose all their money. But if we are able to reach an agreement, everybody will be a winner. Greece will be able to stand upon its feet and get an opportunity to pay off the rest of its debt. A write-off is not really a radical solution and history records several examples.

""Gentili signori,

chi vi scrive è un traduttore letterario e docente di traduzione dall'inglese all'italiano con quindici anni di esperienza.

Perdonate la franchezza, ma evidentemente non vi rendete conto della portata mondiale della scandalosa figura che state facendo fare a voi stessi, a Milano e al nostro paese.

La settimana scorsa, in seguito alla meritoria segnalazione di alcuni miei colleghi, le pagine tradotte (si fa per dire) più vergognosamente, quelle dedicate alla presentazione dei ""personaggi ortofrutticoli"" che compongono la mascotte Foody, sono finite offline per alcuni giorni. Purtroppo per voi, qualcuno ha avuto la prontezza di effettuare degli screenshot e scrivere un articolo sulla vicenda, articolo che nel frattempo ha fatto il giro del mondo:

http://nopeanuts.wordpress.com/2014/03/12/meet-cretino-expo-translator/

Ora le pagine sono ricomparse, e dopo averle lette esiste un solo commento possibile: la toppa è peggio del buco.

Una pagina a caso: http://www.expo2015.org/node/15796

PRIMO: ""Mais"" in inglese si dice corn (o eventualmente maize, che però è termine più tecnico e specificamente britannico), NON mais.

SECONDO: ""He is convinced that he is"" non è grammaticalmente scorretto, ma si vede lontano un miglio che è un calco dall'italiano: un madrelingua inglese direbbe ""he thinks he is"" o qualcosa di simile.

TERZO: ""Soothsayer"" è un termine arcaico e letterario: nessun madrelingua inglese lo userebbe riferito a una mascotte che si vorrebbe ""fresca"", ""giovane"" e così via.

Il problema, ahivoi, è che di queste castronerie sono piene non solo queste pagine, ma TUTTE le altre pagine della sezione inglese del sito, che a differenza di queste non sono mai finite offline. Di nuovo, un esempio a caso:

http://en.expo2015.org/press-area/press-releases/foody-official-expo-milano-2015-mascot

""The President of the Region of Lombardy"" e ""The President of the Province of Milan"", per vostra informazione, non sono espressioni appartenenti alla lingua inglese (né ad alcuna altra lingua, si capisce).

Volete sapere quali sono gli altri strafalcioni?

Volete correre ai ripari?

Be', signori, è troppo tardi: avreste dovuto pensarci prima, affidando le traduzioni a uno o più traduttori madrelingua professionisti e soprattutto pagati il giusto (conosciamo le condizioni indecenti applicate dall'agenzia a cui avete appaltato le traduzioni IT&gt;EN).

Insomma, per dirla nel vostro inglese, the omelette is done.

Distinguished salutations,

Michele Piumini""",0,1395134915,null,0,false,0,cg5hxx5,t3_20pg1w,t1_cg5hxx5,t3_20pg1w,null,1432957648,23,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,23

Dal canto mio, comincio a sospettare che a te la sola menzione della madre Russia scateni qualche non molto sopito riflesso pavloviano.

Che tu definisca ""inquitanti"" le derive nazionaliste di parte dello schieramento antirusso lo condivido senza problemi (vedi il disegno di legge sull'esclusione del russo dalle lingue nazionali ucraine che ho citato sopra). Che tu ti rifiuti di vedere i comportamenti simili dall'altra parte della barricata in Crimea (vedi la proposta di legge speculare che sembra sia stata proposta dal nuovo primo ministro locale) e' come minimo un leggero peccato di ingenuita'.

Ma la chiudo qui, tu rimarrai convinto che io sia un babbeo che prende per buono tutto quelli che gli passano i media.

La cosa buffa della vicenda, e' che anch'io sono abbastanza sicuro che, in una libera elezione senza condizionamenti esterni, una maggioranza significativa degli abitanti della Crimea (metti il 60%-70%) avrebbe probabilmente votato senza problemi per la scissione e l'annessione alla Russia. La cosa creerebbe comunque dei problemi ma almeno ci sarebbe una legittimazione di un certo peso.

Ma l'ultima cosa che Putin e' in grado di volere o apprezzare e' una genuina espressione della volonta' popolare. Non vorrebbe che poi la sua gente prendesse questo brutto vizio.

L'altra cosa abbastanza buffa e' che, con il suo intervento, Putin ha **rafforzato** il nuovo governo ucraino che tu tanto aborrisci. In primis, favorendo la fuoriuscita di una delle regioni piu' filorusse dell'Ucraina, per definizione e' stato aumentato il peso percentuale dello schieramento antirusso nel resto del paese.

E poi tu sarai il primo ad insegnarmi che quello che qualsivoglia regime desidera di piu' per compattare la popolazione e' un nemico esterno al quale addossare tutte le colpe.

Côté théâtre, il y a le théâtre du Vésinet mais j'avoue ne m'être jamais vraiment intéressé à la programmation. Globalement, le Vésinet souffre beaucoup de son manque de dynamisme. Il n'y a probablement pas moins ""chaud"" que le Vésinet. Même Versailles et Saint-Germain-en-Laye sont plus mal famés, c'est dire le niveau de sécurité. C'est accueillant mais globalement mort.

Anecdote : quand la patinoire a brûlé il y a 10 ans environ (accident électrique), un mouvement de résidents était contre la reconstruction parce que ça amenait ""des jeunes"" (sous-entendu des jeunes ""pas comme il faut""). C'est eux qui ont gagné depuis, toujours pas de patinoire au Vésinet.

Cela dit, l'endroit est absolument sublime. Les petits lacs, la faune locale avec ses canards, cygnes ou oies, les chemins de promenade, les grandes pelouses, tout ça participe à donner l'impression d'être au calme. Pas mal de commerces aux alentours malgré tout et deux stations de RER bien desservies.

Le coin est vraiment tranquille, donc pas vraiment adapté à un jeune étudiant en théâtre qui cherchera sûrement quelque chose de plus vivant ;)

Malgré tout, Saint-Germain-en-Laye est juste à côté, c'est beaucoup plus vivant et offre une alternative intéressante à Paris lorsqu'on veut pouvoir rentrer tard.

true,wurdalak,veneto,,"Mi sono liberato dell'auto circa un anno e mezzo fa. E' stata una delle migliori scelte che abbia mai fatto.

Detto questo però dipende dallo stile di vita che fai.

Io abito poco fuori Verona, a circa 8 km dal centro della città. Qui siamo serviti malissimo dai mezzi pubblici, anche di giorno (dopo le 20 zero autobus, come pure la domenica). Utilizzo tantissimo la bici. Diciamo che se fai un lavoro con orari da ufficio e hai uno stile di vita tranquillo (senza tante uscite la sera, ecc.) non ho veramente avuto nessun problema. Sei più rilassato, ti godi di più tutto quello che ti circonda, scopri addirittura cose nuove anche in città in cui vivi da tutta la vita.

Da qualche tempo però ho perso il lavoro, e ho lasciato la ragazza con cui stavo da 8 anni. Ovviamente la mia vita è cambiata radicalmente, la abitudini e i movimenti pure di conseguenza. Questo inverno non avere l'auto ha effettivamente fatto la differenza e qualche volta ho dovuto anche rinunciare a fare quello che volevo.
Un po' è anche un problema psicologico: con tutti i soldi che si risparmiano senza auto (e sono tantissimi!) uno non dovrebbe farsi NESSUN problema a prendere un taxi se serve. Anche spendere (esagero) 500€ di taxi in un anno non dovrebbe essere un problema rispetto alle migliaia di euro risparmiati. D'altro canto però fare una serata fuori d'inverno (freddo, pioggia/neve, ghiaccio, no mezzi pubblici ecc) e mettere in conto magari di spendere 30 euro di taxi, vi dico la verità, in due o tre casi ho rinunciato.
E ho fatto male, come dicevo sopra, ma vabbè.

Dal mese prossimo andrò a vivere in città, quindi possibilità di avere mezzi pubblici anche la sera, e spostamenti comunque limitati e molto più semplicemente a portata di bici. Se questo inverno avessi già abitato in città credo che i pochi disagi che ho avuto sarebbero stati quasi pari a zero.

Ti invito a riflettere, come ha già fatto qualcuno, sull'argomento ""rimorchiare"".
Allora, quando ho scelto di liberarmi dell'auto stavo con una ragazza in una relazione stabile e duratura (!).
Ovviamente terminata la relazione mi sono capitate occasioni di uscire e organizzare serate con altre ragazze. Essendo sano di mente cerco di frequentare persone che non hanno pregiudizi su queste cose (lo dico perchè ho letto di chi si è sentito dire ""ma sei povero"" ""com'è possibile vivere senz'auto OMG!"" ecc.). A me non è capitato sinceramente, e non mi pesa, in maniera del tutto occasionale e chiedendo educatamente e gentilmente, di chiedere un passaggio se ho bisogno o se si esce in compagnia. E' chiaro però che se si vuole uscire in due a volte non avere l'auto fa la differenza. A volte si vuole stare semplicemente da soli a parlare o a fare... dell'altro dopo aver bevuto qualcosa al bar. Mi sono capitate quest'inverno un paio di situazioni in cui avrei preferito avere l'auto, perchè stare semplicemente su una panchina all'una di notte è romantico, ma d'inverno queste latitudini poco consigliabile. (naturalmente anche lui/lei deve essere senz'auto, specialmente se quello che succede nel doposerata non era stato programmato e marca male autoinvitarsi a casa sua o la casa non è ""agibile"").
Insomma, fai i tuoi bei conti.

**TL:DR**
Se vivi in una città butta l'auto e vai. Occhio con le tipe: fare uscite a due a volte senz'auto limita un po' il range di opzioni.",0,1395136925,null,0,1395137147,0,cg5i860,t3_20mfx7,t1_cg5i860,t3_20mfx7,null,1432957782,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

L'exploration de l'espace est une considération complètement sous-estimée, qui, à long-terme, a des conséquences pour la vie intelligente plutôt importantes.

Les humains sommes les seuls êtres sur cette planète capable de ce genre de chose. Et de plus, il me semble que éventuellement c'est seulement par Europe que (tôt ou tard) cela va actuellement se faire pour de vrai (ou peut-être par l'Asie en tant que Chine). Les Riquains et les Russes ont abandonné. Et c'est normal. L’Afrique, l’Amérique, certainement les Russes et le moyen Orient, bref, la plupart de l’humanité, se comportent comme des abrutis et semblent ne s'occuper qu'a des conneries plus ou moins tribales.

De plus, je commence vraiment a en avoir ras-le-bol du ""*sens économique*"". Napoléon avait raison de sentir un dédain absolut envers la tendance, en perfide Albion, de, sans vison humanitaire, toujours penser aux considérations économiques ('*une nation de commerçants, de ""boutiquiers""*'). Ne devenons pas comme eux. 

D'un point de vue ""*humain*"" ou même multi-nationalement Européen, les économies ne sont pas ""*vraiment*"" vraies. Le tout système économique/financier/bancaire est un système plus ou moins [fictif](http://www.economist.com/content/global_debt_clock), seulement utile quand il est en effet ""utile"". 
C'est l’être, la pensée, l’humanité, la vie, la planète, l'espace etc ... qui sont les choses vraies.

Voilà c'est tout.

Salut.

This consequently led to the closure of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus to Russian trade, playing a role in the Russian defeats on the Eastern Front and the subsequent Oktober Revolution freeing over a million German soldiers for action on the Western Front.

It also led to the rather disastrous [Gallipoli Campaign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dardanelles_Campaign), which diverted much-needed Entente troops from the Western Front, resulted in 250.000 Entente casualties and the sinking of 6 British and French pre-Dreadnoughts. The Entente prestige loss of this campaign was so great that it also helped convince neutral but opportunistic Bulgaria to throw in its lot with the Central Powers.

Seizing these two ships was one of Churchill's greatest blunders in the Great War, with far-reaching and dire consequences for the Entente's cause.

Les rumeurs parlent d'immigration. Le fait est que la population change drastiquement et très vite. Ça se voit et personne ne dit les véritables explications donc évidemment les gens vont chercher des causes et ça explique largement pourquoi les rumeurs se répandent.

Les rumeurs ne sont pas créées par l'extrême-droite, une rumeur ça vient de nulle part, du bouche à oreilles, quand on fait face à un phénomène et que personne n'explique.

Le coup de la mosquée sur la tour eiffel, [c'est une blague de 1er avril](http://www.blog.sami-aldeeb.com/2011/08/06/construction-d%E2%80%99une-petite-mosquee-au-1er-etage-de-la-tour-eiffel/).

La suppression des croix vertes dans les pharmacies, [encore une blague du 1er avril](http://www.christianophobie.fr/breves/suppression-des-croix-vertes-des-pharmacies-encore-un-bobard). J'ai pas le temps de faire une recherche sur tout, mais déjà ça rend un peu faible l'analyse.

Pour la rumeur du 9-3, elle s'explique facilement par l'augmentation du nombre de noirs et d'arabes partout en France. C'est un fait, il y en a de plus en plus, et il en arrive dans des endroits où il n'y en avait pas. 

Moi je suis pas contre le fait que les pouvoirs publics disent ""il y a trop d'immigrés en région parisienne, ça fait 30 ans qu'on les concentre aux mêmes endroits et ça pose problème, donc on les déplace ailleurs"". Voilà, ça serait clair. On pourrait les attaquer sur des bases solides : le refus de baisser l'immigration, et le fait que l'immigration pose problème de leur propre aveu (ce qu'ils disent tous en petit comité).

Au lieu de ça ils font des trucs en douce depuis des années sans rien expliquer aux locaux, du coup les rumeurs apparaissent.

&gt;On discute les hoax organisés par l'extrême droite. C'est le sens de l'article.

Dans ce cas pourquoi as-tu sauté sur l'occasion pour balancer la provocation de Le Pen (vaches/arabes) et le truc de Guéant (qui en plus dit une évidence : évidemment la culture française est supérieure à la culture des talibans, évidemment la démocratie c'est mieux que la théocratie, il n'y a pas de débat) ?

&gt;c'est pas parce que ça ""serait"" (conditionnel) tabou qu' on peut se permettre des coups très bas et vils comme pe ces Hoax.

OK mais le truc c'est que si tout allait bien ces rumeurs ne marcheraient pas. Au bout d'un moment les gens n'en peuvent plus et l'émotion prend le dessus. Quand les pouvoirs publics ne font strictement rien, que l'immigration continue à affluer alors qu'on est en pleine crise et que les gens n'en veulent plus, moi j'estime qu'on n'a pas à reprocher à des gens de ne pas vérifier leurs sources où de répéter des choses sans certitude.",0,1395139057,null,0,false,0,cg5ijq4,t3_20m9er,t1_cg5ijq4,t1_cg5i5l3,null,1432957934,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

&gt;Since collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia has tried to develop a market economy and achieve consistent economic growth. In October 1991, Yeltsin announced that Russia would proceed with radical, market-oriented reform along the lines of ""shock therapy"", as recommended by the United States and IMF.[1] However, this policy resulted in economic collapse, with millions being plunged into poverty and corruption and crime spreading rapidly.[2] Hyperinflation resulted from the removal of Soviet price controls and again following the 1998 Russian financial crisis. Assuming the role as the continuing legal personality of the Soviet Union, Russia took up the responsibility for settling the USSR's external debts, even though its population made up just half of the population of the USSR at the time of its dissolution.[3]

As far as I know, IMF loans and every other form of help were given under the condition of enacting economic shock therapy, which fucked Russia over pretty good and in a way made the rise of someone like Putin possible in the first place.

&gt;Making sure that Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and other Eastern-/Central-European countries don't have to fear Russian intervention is not ""driving Russia into a corner"" 

That would be achieved by having them join the EU which would be more than enough to guarantee their independence.
Letting them join NATO and erecting missile shields to make Russia a sitting duck in the, thank god, more than unlikely event that ICBMs would ever fly is compromising Russian national security and driving them into the corner.

Sembra sempre che scrivi sbattendo il pene sulla tastiera, non ti fa bene.

Facciamo che prima provo a dire le cose serie, poi andiamo sulle facezie: con te si fa fatica a distinguere, ma un po' ti amo anche per questo.

Il link della tua ""fonteeeeee"" in realtà mi dà ragione, per questo ti sbertucciavo un po', ma tu purtroppo mi sa che non vedi bene lo schermo a causa del pisello in continua erezione di cui sopra.

&gt; The actions organized by these organizations are most visible in the Ukrainian part of historic Novorossiya (New Russia) in the south of Ukraine and in the Crimea, a region in which in some areas Russians are the largest ethnic group. As ethnic Russians constitute a significant part of the population in these largely Russophone parts of southern Ukraine (and a majority in the Crimea),[1] these territories maintain particularly strong historic ties with Russia on the human level. Thus, a stronger than elsewhere in the country pro-Russian political sentiment makes the area a more fertile ground for the radical pro-Russian movements that are not as common elsewhere in the country.

Oh, incredibile, dice che in Crimea ci sono le fazioni più radicali pro Russe, essendo la zona sotto una forte influenza della Russia. Minchia, chi l'avrebbe mai detto.

Se ti vai a leggere tre cose sulla Crimea capisci anche perché è così. Non me le fare linkare perché è squalificante per entrambi.

Il referendum è stato svolto secondo tutti i crismi? Boh, dipende. Di quali crismi parliamo? Non c'erano osservatori internazionali, è una roba borderline a livello di trattati internazionali, è una forzatura di Putin che è stato messo alle strette.

Il referendum è truccato? Boh. Come diceva l'altro a cui risponderò poi, che argomenta un po' meglio di te (stacce), la fazione pro-indipendenza della Crimea è sicuramente la maggioranza (dove secondo me sbagliate entrambi, ma mi rendo conto che nella furia le cose complesse sono difficili da maneggiare, è in questa idea che solo i russofoni siano a favore della annessione alla Russia. Non si sa che basi abbiate per sostenerlo.)

Mi sta venendo il dubbio che tu faccia confusione tra Ukraina e Crimea, considerandole la stessa cosa, spero di sbagliarmi.

No, Putin non è ad un passo dalla dittatura. Non sono un fan sfegatato, ma a differenza della vulgata non prendo in considerazione il consenso popolare un po' a cazzo di cane e solo quando mi fa comodo, e non mi fermo a queste idee anni '50 dell'informazione russa tutta ferma alla propaganda. Questo non vuol dire che non ci siano problemi e che sia una situazione discutibile.

Ma lo è anche negli altri paesi che tu consideri il resto del mondo.

Però fa comodo immaginarmi che sbavo a parlare di Putin e mi trastulli con la pravda (però so un paio di canzoni in russo, mi hai beccato).

Passiamo alle facezie:

&gt; Che cosa ti avrei detto? Capisco che col cellulare fai fatica a leggere, ma a parte qualche bestemmione non ho mai indirizzato verso te alcun epiteto insultante

mi hai dato dell'idiotino dell'internet e dello svicolone. Ma non sono impazzito per questo, devi imparare ad avere anche tu le spalle larghe. (ho visto ora l'edit ma non mi va di cancellare)

&gt; OSSESSIONE? Allora se non servono le fonti, ok

è che la cosa che odio di queste discussioni è che credo che uno le informazioni può cercarsele da solo, e bene. Se si basa tutta la discussione solo sulle fonti si finisce poi a parlare di quanto le fonti sarebbero credibili e via così. Finché non si dicono enormità (confutabili in poco) e finché si tratta di opinioni (tipo le tue cose stupidine sulla dittatura in Russia) per me si può evitare l'ossessione delle fonti.

&gt; E a me minacciò di denuncia, vedi un po' te.

ecco, questo già mi interessa di più. Racconta.

true,le_mams,EURO,European Union,"Maybe the real contest between Russia and the west is economics, but from a strategy perspective Putin has the initiative here. If this was a chess game, he'd be playing with the whites. And he has been a good player, he's been moving his pawns carefully, striking precisely on target at the right time, unafraid to exhibit strength whenever he deems necessary. 
It seems to me he's committed to expand Russia's sphere of influence and restore Russia's former glory as a superpower.

2008 Georgia's conflict outcome: after a joke of a battle he manages to grab south ossetia and Abkazia for Russia. 

2013 Syrya's conflict: Putin's diplomacy trumps the west, enforcing his view on how to address the issue, which translates in daily massacres by Assad's regime.

2014 Ukraine conflict: he's been stationing Russian troops for a while near Crimea's borders, also delivering Russian passports en masse. He's also been renewing his black sea fleet stationed at Sebastopol for some years now (russia's defense budget + 25% in 2013, +20% in 2014) and it is still an ongoing process. The West didn't move a finger, but we knew. If he's investing so much in military, he's then expecting to benefit from it. Russia has the 3rd defense budget worldwide, just behind the USA &amp; China.

Another point is that he's playing the long game. He doesn't need to worry about elections, he will stay in power longer than any single west leader could ever dream of. That's another advantage he has going for himself. Medvedev may be Russia's president, however Putin remains the true leader.

John Kerry said that Putin was ""playing by 19th Century Rules"". What he should be saying is Putin is playing by his own rules. And the one rule that matters the most to him is strength. Military strength, diplomatic strength, economical strength. 

Let us walk in Putin's shoes just for a moment. Imagine Putin looking at the chess board. What does he sees? Lots of pawns, lots of set pieces, lots of potential. 
Obviously he looks at the USA and what does he thinks? This one is weaker than it used to be, for several reasons. He knows Obama doesn't really care about europe, even less so eastern europe. He knows there isn't a single american tank in europe. He remembers how weak Obama came out from the syryan situation last september. He also sees Obama diminishing his troops number.  

Then he looks at western Europe. This one also is weaker than it used to be. He sees the EU without any real unified military. He sees several countries in great economic dismay. He sees Germany depending a great deal on Russia's ressources trades. He sees the EU bureaucrats struggling constantly to agree on anything. 

He then looks at eastern Europe, and he's quite worried about them joining NATO. That is a potential play that he can not let happen. 

If he looks at Asia what he can see is a big economic potential, he sees China getting stronger, certainly he's considering building new pipelines over Asia where he would be able to sell his gas and oil for a higher price than over the EU.

I believe the West needs to take back the initiative first and foremost. The EU should stop dreaming awake and come back to the real world where strength matter. 20 years after Bosnia, still no EU army, still relying on NATO and the USA. And not just on a defense level, we need diplomatic strength and economic strength as well. No question about that. We need to adapt ourselves and speak Putin's language, because frankly he's not going to speak ours. Ever.

Linguistics classifies languages by family using those very genetics, *not* by vocabulary of the type you're discussing. Vocabulary is easily borrowed, even without speakers knowing much of anything else of the language they're borrowing from - English is only one of many languages to borrow a fair bit of vocab from a language belonging to another family. Grammar, sentence structure and function words aren't easily borrowed, and so are far more useful in tracing the actual ancestry of a language. (Your claims that English has romance sentence structure are based on huge misconceptions on compounding in English, btw).

Révise ta définition de raciste, aucune des rumeurs mentionnées ne l'est. Aucune ne parle de hiérarchie de races ou de généralisation sur un groupe ethnique.

Sinon, je cite l'article :

*Une rumeur ou une légende sera crue par ceux qui y retrouvent leurs préoccupations, leurs peurs, leurs espoirs. Tel individu, telle minorité militante, tel groupe social vont s’approprier une rumeur ou une légende parce qu’elle confirme leurs idées, leurs opinions, leurs croyances ou leurs attitudes. C’est pourquoi l’étude des rumeurs et des légendes urbaines est un outil précieux pour la compréhension de nos sociétés.*

Je fais un lien de causalité entre ces rumeurs et d'une part un phénomène de société qui est l'impossibilité de parler d'immigration, d'autre part l'augmentation de cette immigration.

D'où ma phrase de conclusion :

*L’abandon des illusions suppose la publication des faits, et les faits peuvent être désagréables.*

Noi invece stiamo parlando della CRIMEA (dove è stato fatto il referendum, non tutta l'ucraina, solo la crimea - che è poi la questione un po' borderline di cui parlavo prima), una parte dell'Ucraina, con una sua storia, in cui la maggioranza è filorussa e che ha sempre teso ad una qualche forma di indipendenza (Repubblica Autonoma di Crimea, anyone?).

Gli indipendentisti dell'alto adige sono molto diversi da quelli crimeani, ti ripeto, vai su wikipedia alla voce Crimea e vedi perché.

Ho forse sostenuto che non c'è un problema di democrazia in Russia? No. Bravo.

Credo che la Russia sia il bengodi? No. Bravo.

Credo che la Russia venga rappresentata in modo spesso molto pittoresco e che ci sia un interesse esplicito (nessun complotto, per carità), di un certo ceto politico e intellettuale ad isolare la Russia? Sì. Bravissimo.

Credo che Putin si sia negli anni in parte democratizzato, pur avendo ancora i cascami del suo passato e di un primo mandato gestito in modo agghiacciante? Sì. Bravissimo.

Ho mai detto di essere un fan sfegatato di Putin o ho parlato di interessi contrapposti? La seconda, bravo. Interessi che ritengo più legittimi per quanto riguarda la Russia che per quanto riguarda L'Europa (di cui i movimenti filonazisti - no, non bruciano i libri ma per il resto fanno pure peggio - si stanno facendo scudo) e L'America, che proprio spudoratamente mira all'indebolimento economico della Russia, che ha in Crimea un suo avamposto strategico.

Il ne veut rien changer, à part bien sûr leur donner le droit de vote.

Il en est resté au slogan [l'immigration est une chance pour la France](http://www.7sur7.be/7s7/fr/1505/Monde/article/detail/1726247/2013/10/20/Francois-Hollande-accuse-d-indecision-sur-l-immigration.dhtml). Mais **sur quelles données est-ce qu'il appuie ce raisonnement ?**

Même [Valls](http://youtu.be/0vSTAiVxodI?t=2m57s) n'arrête pas de parler de l'immigration comme richesse, de dire que la France a besoin de l'immigration. **Mais qu'est-ce qui lui permet d'affirmer cela ?**

Quant à la qualification d'une ""chance pour la France"" je pense qu'on peut évidemment demander à ceux qui sont concernés d'étayer leurs propos et de donner les métriques par lesquelles ils considèrent que c'est une chance.

Pour ma part je n'aime pas ces raisonnements purement financiers, Je pense aussi à ceux qui viennent ici chercher une vie meilleure et je ne considère pas qu'un Suisse ou un Français vale mieux qu'un Croatien ou un Malien.

Gorbachev's vision when he enacted the perestroika was that of a mixed economy after the Western European/Scandinavian model, that was also what in a way what the West signed up for when they signalized Gorbachev that they were willing to help and gave him the go forward.

When push came to shove after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Yeltsin needed the help if Russia was not to become a failed state it came with strings attached, namely the economic shock therapy, which worked out so well in [Yugoslavia](http://www.monitor.net/monitor/9904a/yugodismantle.html) and Latin America. So instead of the mixed market social democracy they got full on neoliberalism and plummeting standards of living.
In my mind the term ""fucking them over"" does this way of looking at the events justice, your mileage may vary.

Furthermore, I don't think the comparison with the GDR is fair, last time I checked there weren't East German Billionaires Clubs in London whose members got rich by stealing from the people and Russia didn't exactly get the help of one the strongest economies in Western Europe.
China shows that a fairly smooth transition from planned economy to capitalism is possible, so why did Russia need to crash and burn?

Where did I ever say that countries were forced into the NATO?
No eastwards expansion WAS one of the promises of the reunification of Germany, which Russia could have blocked and which would have opened a giant can of worms. The eastward expansion of the EU which included the Baltic Republics, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary was decided in 1997, the same year NATO **offered** these countries to join. Do you seriously think Russia would dare to invade or bully an EU member state? And yes, this does affect Russia the same way it would affect the USA if their ability to retaliate against a theoretical nuclear attack would be compromised.

&gt; Variamente frequentata dai fedeli, la moschea iniziò a essere disertata dalla fine degli anni Ottanta, pare a causa di problemi logistici e di gestione economica, ma probabilmente anche per il carattere difficile dell’avvocato che, per dirne una, aveva fatto apporre sul prospetto la scritta quantomeno arrogante “Michele Papa aedificavit”. Un gesto che, contro ogni regola, dichiarava la proprietà della moschea, e che i fedeli non apprezzarono, a maggior ragione perché compiuto da un non musulmano qual era l’avvocato Papa. I musulmani catanesi si trovarono dunque senza un luogo in cui praticare la propria religione e per un anno pregarono in strada, in segno di protesta. In seguito, si trasferirono in due diverse sedi, in via Calì, nel quartiere della Civita, e in via Serravalle, nei pressi del porto. Uno scantinato e un garage nei quali si è pregato per vent’anni, in attesa della nuova Moschea che arriverà a luglio.

I am able to advise the House this afternoon that we have taken the decision this morning to offer NATO UK Typhoon aircraft from late April to augment the Polish contribution to the NATO Baltic air policing mission. I hope that will provide reassurance to our NATO allies in the east.

&gt;Les candidats du FN accros aux fausses rumeurs

C'est plutôt ça qui se discute ici. Et non les pb d'immigration.

&gt;Dans ce cas pourquoi as-tu sauté sur l'occasion pour balancer la provocation de Le Pen (vaches/arabes) et le truc de Guéant (qui en plus dit une évidence : évidemment la culture française est supérieure à la culture des talibans, évidemment la démocratie c'est mieux que la théocratie, il n'y a pas de débat) ?

/u/bonconseil disait que les rumeurs était faîtes pour contrer les mensonges du gouvernement sur l'immigration. Sur quoi, je réponds qu'on a pas pu apparemment contrer ces mensonges avec des moyens ""sains"" mais avec des hoax, ou des petites phrases et polémiques comme celles de Lepen et Guéant. C'est pas de la provoque, j'explique que les ripostes ne sont pas très éthiques.

La culture française n'est pas supérieure à aucune autre. Il se défend qu'il parlait de  celle des talibans mais il est largement plus vicieux que ça. Il englobait toutes les cultures étrangères des pays dont les habitants émigrent en masse en France. Il fait un clin d’œil séducteur aux gars du FN.

 La culture n'est pas juste le voile, la condition de la femme, le halal etc. C'est pas un comportement à l'instant T. Les talibans sont relativement récents, et c'est une idéologie islamiste certes aujourd'hui mais les afghan ont une culture ancienne. Dire que nous sommes supérieure c'est une connerie. Je peux l'entendre de Tata Louisette au fin fond de l'allier, mais Guéant est censé être éduqué... bref.. je m’éloigne du sujet...

&gt; moi j'estime qu'on n'a pas à reprocher à des gens de ne pas vérifier leurs sources

Je vais la retenir celle là, quand mon pote /u/BonConseil me demande des sources :p

Si je peux me permettre une remarque, une opinion pour conclure. Il y a un problème d'immigration en France. C'est le problème d’intégration de **certains** immigrés. J'insiste sur le fait que c'est pas tous qui posent problème. Il faut bien sur en parler. Je suis d'accord pour dire qu'au PS, ça reste tabou, à cause des buts électoralistes bien entendu. Le problème est que les autres qui en parlent, le font mal. Je m'explique: Aujourd'hui ceux qui parlent d'immigrés ne peuvent pas se contenir aux chiffres et aux faits. Il faut qu'ils sortent des âneries sur la culture, sur les français souche et pas souche, etc... Ils draguent la fibre xénophobe de certains électeurs. Du coup, la crédibilité prends un coup. Depuis quelque temps, Marine L. essaie de changer de discours. De séparer le discours anti-immigration de celui anti-immigré (de son père). Mais, on s'en méfie. On sait que c'est une stratégie, que le fond n'est vraiment pas clair.

true,tanadrin,null,null,"Hi! I study the history of the English language--I'm a PhD student in early medieval English literature.

Your misconceptions about English's relationship to the Romance languages are, while common, exaggerated and mistaken. English has indeed borrowed quite a lot of words from Latin, many via French--by some measures, the split between Germanic and Latin-derived vocabulary is as big as 40% to 60%. However, this does not mean English is ""Romance.""

First of all, linguists talk about two kinds of *lexical class* (kinds of words): there are *closed classes* (words like pronouns and prepositions) which are more rarely borrowed, and used a lot. There are *open classes* (words like nouns and verbs) which are more commonly borrowed, and each individual open class word is used more rarely (though some may still be common). Closed class words perform essential grammatical functions--you can't speak English without using prepositions!--while open class words convey a lot more *semantic content*.

Romance borrowings are mostly *open class* words; this is important for establishing what linguists would call English's *genetic relationship* to other languages. When we speak of a *genetic relationship* in English, like in biology, we're talking about *direct* descent, aside from (even numerous) borrowings. English's genetic relationship places it squarely in the Germanic language family: those languages which descend from Proto-Germanic, which include German, English, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic, and many others. Proto-Germanic was spoken about two thousand years ago, and is a descendant of the much older Proto-Indo-European; all languages which descend from Proto-Indo-European (a diverse group including Hindi, Albanian, and French) are Indo-European languages. [Here's a graph showing the relationship](http://clubweb.interbaun.com/~mward/gmc/24b_ie_langs.gif). Genetically speaking, English and the Romance languages belong to *completely* different branches; French is probably more closely related to Irish, Welsh, or another Celtic language than it is to English, as there's some evidence of an affinity between the Italic and Celtic branches of Indo-European. Borrowing words (or even grammatical constructions) does *not*, from the standpoint of historical linguistics, make two languages ""more closely related.""

Without delving too much into sociolinguistics, which is a big field, it's worth noting that English's borrowings from French and Latin, due to historical circumstance, fall mainly into two categories: *technical* vocabulary, and important *cultural* vocabulary. We borrowed *beef, cheque, magistrate,* and *cuirass* because these were important, prestigious elements of culture (law, finance, war, cuisine) which were associated, by speakers of English, with other languages (or English just didn't have a word for them). Nearly all everyday vocabulary and the overwhelming majority of basic vocabulary, however (pronouns, landforms, body parts, days of the week, numbers--things without which basic conversation would be impossible) is still Germanic, and has been part of English since it could meaningfully be called that. There are a couple outliers--*very* is Latin in origin, but intensifiers tend to get regularly recycled; *they* is a Norse borrowing, probably because in Middle English, the old word *hie* became homophonous with *he*--but in terms of scientific linguistics, English is still *extremely* Germanic. Its grammar is entirely Germanic. It is considered a Germanic language; it is in no way a Romance language, and that distinction belongs only to languages descended from Latin (including ones with lots of non-Romance borrowings, like Romanian--which borrows a lot from Slavic languages--and French--which borrows a lot from Frankish--a Germanic language!--though neither borrow from those sources to the extent English has borrowed from Latin or French, AFAIK).

Many of the misconceptions about English endure because English speakers like to think of their language as special or unique; sometimes, I suspect English speakers have an inferiority complex about their language's lowly Germanic past, and wish it could be more refined like (they think) a Romance language. The first, while understandable, exaggerates--English is from a linguistic standpoint not especially remarkable, and though it has borrowed a lot of vocabulary, it's hardly unique in that respect. Certainly not among languages whose speakers have a complicated history--which is most of them. The second is just silly; English, like every other language on Earth, has its own proud intellectual and artistic tradition, and it beautiful in its own way; it doesn't need to be dressed up in Romance clothing to make it respectable!

true,ptitz,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; The fact that Europe gets most of Libya's oil was clearly a factor in that ""world police"" adventure.

First: What exactly did EU stand to gain from this adventure? Right now the whole supply chain is fucked up and Lybia is selling crude no North Korea of all places. And it's not like they wouldn't see it coming either, since after the whole Iraq gig the most lucrative contracts ended up with Russia and China.

Second: What does Libya have to do with EU *defense*? What, we are so afraid that Russia will invade Estonia that we bomb Libya? How on Earth does this justify spending more money on NATO?

&gt;This goes against your assertion the US was sabotaging any cooperation with the west.

US also invested $5 billion in *building democratic institutions* in Ukraine, something that EU did not do. US was not sabotaging the cooperation, it was fucking clueless in its foreign policy once again, who it deals with and how it goes about it. Which is especially evident with the most recent administration.

And what do you want me to back up exactly? That US was busy with subversion in Ukraine? Thats pretty clear already, thanks to Victoria *Fuck the EU* Nuland. Do you want me to prove how clueless NATO is in everything it does? One fun fact to demonstrate it is that [Al Quaeda controls more territory today than it ever did](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/07/opinion/bergen-al-qaeda-terrority-gains/index.html). I think that [giving them money](http://www.frontpagemag.com/2013/arnold-ahlert/obamas-move-to-arm-al-qaeda-in-syria/) certainly doesn't help. So the whole war on terror gig is failing miserably. And meanwhile Russia is being sanctioned into oblivion for something that had been [standard NATO practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Kosovo_declaration_of_independence) for decades and Obama is [having tea](http://www.theotherrussia.org/2009/07/03/obama-will-meet-with-russian-opposition/) with Russian *opposition leaders*, undermining the legitimacy of the whole movement. What else do you want me to prove? That EU politicians are increasingly skeptical about the whole usefulness of NATO? Reduced defense spending testifies that. If you want more specific points, you can find plenty in any EU hard-core nationalist party booklet, that's one of the reasons people vote for them these days. Do you want me to prove that EU is ready to defend itself? The total military spending of the EU is $274 billion, thats more than China and Russia combined. And EU already spent 20 years building a common defense policy.

What's your point? That EU needs NATO? What for? It outlived itself, it is completely irrelevant, quite useless and it had been nothing but damaging ever since the end of Cold War. Why don't you prove me now, why does EU need NATO if it has enough force, enough equipment, enough facilities and expertise to protect itself from any foreign threats already?

First of all, the idea of university-level education available to the poor is great, but Polish law does not actually implement it. In order to get into a public university (which are in general much better than the private ones), you need to be good at the high school level. For many people it means private tutoring or private high schools. In addition, even though the state covers the tuition, students still need to find means to cover their expenses. People coming from poor families are often unable to do that or have to find a job that does not leave enough time for studying (and sometimes they also have to provide for their families). As a result, it's the rich kids who enjoy free universities the most and everyone pays for them in their taxes. This means that, in a way, the poor pay for education of the rich.

Also, people don't really respect university level education. Many people will enroll in less popular majors just to get a student ID and many discounts that come with it. ",0,1395155227,null,0,false,0,cg5n2fs,t3_20pop3,t1_cg5n2fs,t3_20pop3,null,1432960131,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Si la coalition historique de la gauche est en déclin, une nouvelle coalition émerge. Sa sociologie est très différente : 

1. Les diplômés [...]
2. Les jeunes [...]
3. Les minorités et les quartiers populaires : La France de la diversité est presqu’intégralement à gauche. L’auto-positionnement des individus révèle un alignement des Français d’origine immigrée, et plus encore de la deuxième génération, à gauche – de l’ordre 
de 80-20. On retrouve des scores de cette ampleur dans les bureaux de vote des quartiers populaires, et encore de 62-38 dans les zones urbaines sensibles.
4. Les femmes [...]

Ça, c'était en 2011.

Maintenant, en 2014, les choses sont extrêmement différentes, avec un changement de discours des jeunes générations (affaire Dieudonné) et des immigrés (affaire du genre).

The recent Net Neutrality legislation provides an abolishment of roaming fees and other positive steps. However, what has consumed our time and focus here on Reddit is the actual Net Neutrality which by definition (for most of us), means that ISPs are required to treat all internet trafic equally. Some in the Parliament (Carstillo) seems to believe that the definition of Net Neutrality is that only equal trafic is to be treated equal (VoIP is VoIP, Video is Video) which would open a window for ISP's to charge extra for using the internet for specific things and services.

For European netizens, last mentioned definition is a the direct opposite of the meaning ""Net Neutrality"". How do we fight this effectively?

The traditional two-state solution adhering to the old 1967 borders as of Palestine as laid out in UNSC Resolution 242? Or do you not believe that realistic at this point?

**Secondly**, as a member of the Green Party, how do you feel about Nuclear Power and do you see it as an suitable intermediate power source while transitioning from Fossil Fuels to Renewable Energy?

**Thirdly**, as MEP, what are your feelings towards further European integration within the European Union? As in, the shifting of more power to the European Parliament and other legislative bodies of the Union, as well as a possibility of formation of a single unified European military(A step up from our current Battlegroups and EUFOR Task Forces).

Recently I've read a paper called The Brussels Effect by Anu Bradford. [Paper](https://www.law.northwestern.edu/lawreview/v107/n1/1/LR107n1Bradford.pdf), [Talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeFmR3Fkjzw). The main gist of her argument is that EU is a regulatory superstate that when it imposes standards in certain markets (Antitrust, Privacy, Food safety, Environment etc - specifically in markets that require access to the single market) they in effect become global standards. This can be seen as the EU leveraging its market to impose unilateral standards on trading partners outside the EU. A lot of the times these standards ended up with higher consumer standards in non-EU countries etc

**1)** So my question is when legislation is being drafted, is the effect of EU regulatory practises externalising onto trading partners outside the EU a part of the discussions?

**2)** Is the EU ability to create global norms and externalise its standards through its regulatory practises a motivating factor or is it a inconsequential factor in drafting regulations? 

**3)** Lastly, in a similar way that the US has pivoted to Asia, do you believe it is in the EU interests to do the same and devote more time and energy to the bodies like ASEM and the ASEAN regional forum?

true,CastorTrollux,ANAR,Cyborg,"You forgot to mention the surge in renewables and how that is replacing nuclear power. 

I am not entirely against nuclear, but conventional nuclear power is problematic. First of all it produces nuclear waste that will continue to be dangerous for thousands of years and has to be cooled for decades before it can even be considered for long-term storage. 

On the subject of long-term storage, there is only one country in the world, Finland, that has even begun to build a facility that can store nuclear waste for the long-term. If other countries were to take similar actions, it will cost them billions and further increase the cost of nuclear power. If they don't, then it will cost even more in the future when the temporary containment eventually fails and pollutes vast areas of land, groundwater etc.

On the issue of cost, the upfront costs associated with the construction of nuclear power stations requires a fairly substantial investment for a marginal return. In addition to that, nuclear power plants cannot be insured as the costs of a catastrophy are enormous, as we've seen in Japan, and would bankrupt any insurance company. So the government has to provide insurance, which means if something goes wrong the tax payer has to pay up, while all profits are privatized.

Further, arguably the most problematic fossil fuel to replace is actually oil. Even if we make new nuclear power plants, you still can't drive a gasoline or diesel car with electricity. In order for nuclear power to effectively replace oil, we'd have to replace oil-powered cars with electric cars. Then we'd have to quadruple our electricity output and rebuild the entire grid to handle the increased load. This would be an humongous investment of not only time and money, but also energy and raw materials, all while the the world supply of conventional economically extractable uranium lasts only about 50-60 years at current rates of consumption, not taking into account the increase if we do decide to go nuclear.

Basically my point is that the solution to our problems is not as much the energy type we consume, but how much we consume and why we do it. Do we really need infinite economic growth?

1.) Thanks to the sanctions [against Russia] Latvia is going to lose money (millions) when we just found out it's better than in the pre-crisis 2008. Is anything going to be done about the sanctions? Or there will be even more of them?

2.) Russian language discrimination. Here in Latvia our nationalist party (VL-TB/LNNK) with Unity (Vienotiba) are threatening the status of Russian schools in Latvia. Is there anything going to be done in the future for the improvement of this situation? Recently, we could've even had them closed by 2018, which luckily won't happen.

3.) Since you are in the left part of the political spectrum (which I am happy to hear!) could you please tell what new stuff is planned this year? As in in economics and stuff.

4.) Net neutrality. What do you think of it?

Non mais c'en est une partie très importante. Sans langue, pas de littérature, de poésie, de chants, de cinéma (non muet). Je parle bien entendu des langues et cultures en général et pas seulement du français. 
Certains concepts propres à une culture ne peuvent s'exprimer que dans une langue car les autres langues n'ont simplement pas d’équivalent. C'est souvent le cas en anglais, ce qui explique en partie la difficulté de traduire en français des inventions américaines (exemple du ""selfie"" évoqué plus bas). D'ailleurs, le cas inverse est également vrai et l'anglais emprunte plein d'expressions au français (par exemple le terme ""déjà-vu""), même si c'est moins le cas à notre époque.


&gt;  Et la partie de la culture française qui touche le plus les étrangers est celle qui a su se détacher de la langue.

Ah bon ?


&gt; La taille de la francophonie peut nous faire croire un moment que donner un préférence au français a un sens, mais des qu'on sort de France on réalise vite qu'on est en fait à peu près aussi ridicule que les Flamands qui pensent que tout le monde va se mettre à parler leur langue s'ils s'arrêtent d'en parler une autre.

Avoir une bonne maitrise de sa langue maternelle facilite bien souvent l'apprentissage d'une autre langue. Il vaut mieux bien apprendre le français à nos enfants pour qu'ils puissent mieux apprendre l'anglais (et d'autres langues). 
Les Flamands sont peut-être arrogants parfois mais ils ont tout à fait raison de ne pas se laisser écraser par le français. Maintenant, si un Flamand part à l'étranger et s'étonne que personne ne parle sa langue, ce n'est évidement pas très intelligent. Mais je ne vois pas pourquoi un Belge francophone qui se rend en Flandres devrait s'attendre à ce que tout le monde parle français.

Tu dis vouloir discuter avec des Chinois, des Japonais, ou des Russes. Moi aussi. Mais pourquoi devrions-nous abandonner notre langue pour autant ?

&gt;__Salmorejo__ is a [purée](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pur%C3%A9e) consisting of [tomato](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato) and [bread](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread), originating from [Cordoba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3rdoba,_Spain) in [Andalusia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia), south [Spain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain). It is made from tomatoes, bread, oil, [garlic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic) and [vinegar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinegar). Normally, the tomatoes are skinned and then [puréed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pur%C3%A9e) with the other ingredients. The purée is served cold and may be garnished with diced Spanish [serrano ham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamon_serrano) and diced hard-boiled [eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(food\)). 

&gt;Salmorejo is more pink-orange in appearance than [gazpacho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazpacho), and is also much thicker and creamier in texture, because it includes more [bread](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread). There are several variations in [Andalusia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia), including *ardoria* and *porra antequerana* (with bits of tuna as topping).

&gt;__Salmorejo__ is also the name given to a [marinade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinade) typical of [Canary Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands) cuisine. It is used to flavour meat before cooking, especially [rabbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit) (*conejo en salmorejo*) which is a speciality of the islands. Typical marinade ingredients include salt, garlic, [paprika](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paprika) and hot peppers.

true,StopBeingAssholes,null,null,"Diese extrem linken Artikel in /r/de gehen mir ziemlich auf die Nerven. Ohne Scham werden hier Artikel gepostet, die eine bestimmte Klientel bedienen und dabei alle Fakten je nach beabsichtigtem Ziel verdrehen und verzerren. 

Dazu gehört auch dieser Artikel des Online-Magazins, dass sich ""**MIG**AZIN - Migration in Germany"" nennt. 

Der Artikel beschäftigt sich mit der Zuwanderung aus Bulgarien und Rumänien nach Duisburg. 

Es wird bemängelt, dass keine Transferleistungen beansprucht werden können und dadurch die Zuwanderer in Schein-Selbständigkeiten ""gedrängt"" werden. ""Viele leben gezwungenermaßen in heruntergekommenen Immobilien, manche bekommen noch nicht einmal den ihnen versprochenen Hungerlohn."" Dann heißt es, dass 80 Prozent der aus Bulgarien und Rumänien Zugewanderten zwischen 2007 und 2011 sozialversicherungspflichtig beschäftigt sind. 

Im Zuge des Artikels werden Parallelen zum Nationalsozialismus gezogen. 
Im Rahmen des Aufbaus des Artikels wird argumentiert: ""Anschließend geht es um den Rassismus der **autochthonen** Bevölkerung gegen die Zuwanderer"". ([autochthon](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autochthon) = der Begriff [„autochthon“](http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/autochthon) bezeichnet Menschen, die ursprünglich aufgrund historischer Prozesse an einem Ort leben. [""Allochthon“](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allochthon_(Ethnologie) bezeichnet jene Gruppen, die auf Grund von Wanderungen, Vertreibung oder Arbeitsmigration entstanden sind.)
Es wird damit argumentiert, dass aus ""dem Völkermord im Nationalsozialismus, ... das postfaschistische Deutschland wenig gelernt"" hat und dass ""antiziganistische Einstellungsmuster nicht nur von Anhängern der extremen Rechten vertreten werden, sondern fest verankert in der deutschen Gesellschaft sind."" 
Marxloh und Hochfeld seien die Orte in Duisburg, mit der größten Zuwanderung aus Bulgarien und Rumänien. In Marxloh habe sich auch ein Vorfall ergeben, in dem 6 rumänische Staatsbürger von Vermummten verprügelt wurden, wobei eine große Anzahl von Schaulustigen nicht eingriff, sondern gar Beifall klatschte.
 
Bei näherer Betrachtung ergibt sich, dass [Hochfeld](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hochfeld#Struktur) einen Ausländeranteil in 2010 von 43,73% hatte, wobei der türkische Anteil hoch ausfällt und inzwischen 15% der Ausländer aus Bulgarien und Rumänien kommen, [Marxloh](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxloh#Marxloh_heute) hat einen Ausländeranteil von 41,95%, die türkischstämmige Bevölkerung sei für den Stadtteil ""prägend"" laut Wikipedia.

Die Verbindung der heutzutage von Migration geprägten Ortschaften mit einem Rassismus der autochthonen Bevölkerung, also den Deutschen, ([autochthon](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autochthon) = altgriechisch αὐτός autós ‚selbst‘ und χθών chthōn ‚Erde‘, eingeboren, ursprünglich) und das Fortwirken des Faschismus sowie der Hinweis auf einen Völkermord an Zigeunern im Dritten Reich, ist vollkommen daneben. 

Es ist verständlich, warum der Artikel so aufgebaut ist, wie er ist. Mit dieser Form der Argumentation konnte man in der Vergangenheit und auch heute noch Ziele durchsetzen und alle sind eingeknickt, weil keiner der böse Nazi sein wollte. 

Diese Art der Argumentation hat nichts mit Ursachenforschung und Wahrheitsfindung zu tun und dient allein dem Ziel, durch Täuschung die Deutungshoheit zu erlangen, gezielt den Nationalsozialismus anzusprechen um Druck aufzubauen und Forderungen stellen zu können. Und das wissen alle Beteiligten!

In Wahrheit spitzt sich vor allem die Auseinandersetzung zwischen verschiedenen Migrationsgruppen zu, die die kulturelle Hoheit in einem lokalen Gebiet beanspruchen und diese im Streit auch mit Gewalt durchsetzen. Ferner ist ein zunehmend härter werdender Verteilungskampf zwischen den Migrationsgruppen zu beobachten. Mit diesen Erkenntnissen lassen sich aber keine Forderungen durchsetzen oder staatlichen Mittel anzapfen.

Wer Lust hat, der kann sich die Kommentare zu dem Artikel durchlesen. Sehr erhellend, was da geschrieben wird.

Italy has always been under very tight geographical control by the Catholic Church, and even in the 1800s it would have been taboo to allow a mosque.

You might want to research that, but I have found nothing, and it is possible that Jews and Muslim were free to worship, but in private gatherings. Also, never forget that they were tolerant, but the Inquisition found place there as well.

On another track, you can look to more remote places, outside the Church's direct influence, and with a good number of Muslim citizens: at some time it could have been so in Sardinia or Abruzzo. But you will never find much in Rome.

You should look for Sicily, and Palermo especially. Mostly during the Arabic domination, but also during the reign of Frederich II, *Stupor Mundi*. He was very tolerant, respected Muslims, spoke Arabic and grew up among them.

Compared to the Russian army? I have my doubts.

Of course Russia will not attack mainland France, but together with China it can build a new world order (in the developing world, mostly) in which France will be rendered completely irrelevant. As an example, a whole lot of those African semi-dictators currently allied with France would much rather deal with a more unscrupulous ally. At this point in time it is far easier to imagine this ally to be China, but would you say that ten years ago? Similarly, in ten years Russia can re-appear in Africa, especially if it triumphs in Syria (those Mistral warship will look nice in an expanded Russian naval base in Tartus, heck with enough money and imagination they'll even expand it and call it the Russian Mediterranean Fleet) and continues to build friendly relations with Egypt. Suddenly the Mediterranean is not a NATO playground, and West Africa isn't a French one. Oops.

And the bottom line in all this isn't that Russia/China don't have the right to engage in relationships with countries all over the world, of course they do. But the kind of relationships will be much more old-school 20th century semi-colonial ones, and will definitely squeeze France out. That would be the first order of business.

And, a little closer to home, are you ready to declare that the former Yugoslavia is completely irrelevant to France and a newly resurgent Serbia (or a Russian-backed Republika Srpska) can do whatever it wants in Bosnia?

All of this is a plausible scenario, not a prediction of course. Much will depend on the European response, Russia's ability to leverage its resource base to build something other than a petrodictatorship, etc. But letting this Sudetenland-style takeover slide will change the rules of the game in Europe. Everything Europeans tried so hard to eliminate from their continent after WW2 is now fair game. Nationalism-inspired re-drawing of the borders being first and foremost.

Of course France can sit quietly on the sidelines. It won't be the first country in the region whose relevance fades. Spain mattered once too.",0,1395161496,null,0,1395161856,0,cg5pvts,t3_20p463,t1_cg5pvts,t1_cg5ou9x,null,1432961459,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

In coda poi incollo link e passaggi di wikipedia a casaccio così sei a posto con queste stramaledette fonti.

Secondo me la situazione è questa, poi tu capisci quello che vuoi capire:

Su un ucraina dilaniata si sta svolgendo una vergognosa lotta di potere tra USA e Russia, dopo che si è trovato il pretesto per togliere a Putin l'ultima posizione strategica che gli rimaneva sul mediterraneo.
Un incrocio di interessi politici e economici ha costretto entrambi a forzare la mano, ognuno a modo loro.

La Russia ha rinforzato la sua presenza militare in un territorio che era de facto sotto il suo controllo (politico ed economico).

I crimeani, divisi tra i filorussi e quelli che hanno visto la situazione precipitare dopo che la Russia ha iniziato a tagliare i ponti con l'Ucraina, si sono attaccati ad un referendum sicuramente discutibile per come è stato messo in piedi. Ma sul cui svolgimento le irregolarità sono tutte (TUTTE) da dimostrare.

I media stanno facendo un casino assoluto, e stanno raccontando male e in modo contraddittorio cosa sta succedendo.

Un referendum pur se rocambolesco lo preferisco ad una soluzione più drastica (che pure ancora si prospetta all'orizzonte).


Hai usato straw man dall'inizio alla fine, e ora accusi me di farlo? Io almeno non mi sono lamentato e ho cercato di correggerti e riposizionare il discorso dove era fin dall'inizio. Ma va bene tutto.

From the [Wikipedia page of Lucera:](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucera)

&gt; Federico II deportò inoltre a Lucera numerosi musulmani di Sicilia: nel 1239, sembra non si contassero più di dodici abitanti di religione cristiana. Il borgo si era sviluppato verso il castello, in conseguenza degli arrivi e vennero fatte costruire numerose moschee al posto delle chiese. Lugêrah conobbe in quel periodo una notevole fioritura, tanto che ben presto venne paragonata, dai viaggiatori e dagli storici musulmani di allora, alla Cordova degli emiri e dei califfi omayyadi.
La Lucera musulmana restò fedele alla casa sveva e dopo la morte di Federico II nel 1250 parteggiò per Manfredi nel 1254 e per Corradino nel 1267, rifiutando l'obbedienza a Carlo I d'Angiò.
[...] la città, dopo un lungo assedio condotto da Giovanni Pipino da Barletta, venne distrutta e gli abitanti musulmani massacrati o venduti come schiavi. La città fu rinominata ""Civita Sancte Marie"" (città di Santa Maria) e al posto della Moschea principale, demolita, venne costruita la Cattedrale dell'Assunta

TLDT:

Frederick II deported there many Sicilian muslims, in 1239 there were only 12 christians in the city. The village developed towards the castle and as the population raised, many mosques were built instead of churches. It flourished so much that some travelers compared Lucera to the spanish Cordoba. They were faithful to Frederick's values and followed Frederick's son Manfredi, after the Emperor's death in 1250, refusing Carlo II as king. [...] After a long siege by Giovanni pipino da Barletta, sent by King Carlo d'Angiò, the city was destroyed and the muslim citizens killed or sold as slaves. The city was renamed Civita Sancte Marie and the Assunta Cathedral was built over the main Mosque.

Another place, another story:

In the Latium region, not far from Rome there's a tiny village isolated on the top of a mountain called Saracinesco, that was founded by a group of former saracen warriors defeated in 906 in the battle of Vicovaro. Nowadays it's the smallest town in Latium with just a hundred folks still living there. The muslim population was entirely converted to christianism along the centuries, but moorish surnames like Morgante, Margutta and Almansor still persist. The local church is dedicated to archangel St. Michael, a warrior angel largely worshipped in former muslim colonies all over the mediterranean. The church was built in XIII century and it is believed to stand on the former place occupied by the mosque.",0,1395162551,null,0,1395304822,0,cg5qdqs,t3_20psnd,t1_cg5qdqs,t1_cg5oyox,null,1432961693,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

mmm, prima del presidente che non nomino per timore di sbagliare lo spelling, l'Ucraina ebbe alcuni momenti in cui alzò la testa contro la Russia, neh.

no aspè, il bullet point di prima lo hai letto, quelle quattro cose ti tornano? Il problema non è se era irregolare, ma che mancano le premesse per verificare, anche internamente, non solo internazionalmente, la validità del voto. e le urne trapsparenti non si possono vedere, dai. Quella è una palese irregolarità sulla segretzza del voto.

&gt;""I crimeani hanno, per contingenze storiche, un forte legame con la madre Russia e un autonomismo sempre rivendicato rispetto all'Ucraina"".

allora, una cosa è l'autonomismo, concesso dall'ucraina già da prima. Una cosa è l'indipendentismo, che tu hai nominato, e un'altra l'annessionismo, che prima del referendum era di una minoranza. Sempre il mio link diceva che gli indipendentisti erano una minoranza rumorosa e basta.

Recently, many members and associated countries have been trying to partially escape the principle of free movement while reaping its benefits: the UK with voting rights and healthcare costs, Switzerland with quotas on Croatia, and most recently Denmark and Finland with worker's rights and unemployment support. Legal challenges have been mounted against all these movements, but they could be interpreted as a cohesion problem.

To what extent do you think members should adhere to and protect this principle (of free movement and equal treatment of EU citizens); which way do you think things will turn out in the mid-term; and (if desirable) how could we reduce these tensions?

Hagia Sophia served as the cathedra, or bishop's seat, of the city. Originally called Megale Ekklesia (Great Church), the name Hagia Sophia came into use around 430. The first church structure was destroyed during riots in 404; the second church, built and dedicated in 415 by Emperor Theodosius II, burned down during the Nika revolt of 532, which caused vast destruction and death throughout the city. Immediately after the riots, Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–65) ordered the church rebuilt.*

While they did not need to pay money to attend a Gymnasium, they still needed to get there and while you they away studying they weren't able to work at home. 

Which the family of my father wasn't able to afford after they paid for it for his older siblings, so he did not go despite being gifted enough. My mother also did not attend a Gymnasium at first because the two Gymnasiums which were reachable were for boys only. That changed later and so she was able to make her Abitur. 

My dads sisters had to go to a boarding school.

There is no question that it is easier to get into a company with an IT backround, simply due to the fact that more IT guys are needed than engineers with a very specific backround, however the demand for people with a strong theoretical backround in physics and are interestet in engineering jobs greatly exceeds the current supply.

Yes, because trading involves so much more than just trading goods. 

To increase trade and production efficiency, you open up your borders to people. Somebody has to enforce it.

To increase trade and facilitate consumption, you have a common currency. Somebody has to enforce it.

What if people become unemployed because of labour movements throughout the common market? You set up a social fund, and enforce it.

That is why you get the EU with some state-like qualities.

It is pretty much too late for the april vote.

&gt; Does it basically come down to whether ALDE support or oppose? Or is it worthwhile trying to persuade individual members, even if they are EPP or ECR? Are they likely to break the party line, or do members usually vote as a bloc under these circumstances?

Not really. You pretty much need EPP and S&amp;D to agree. It is extremely rare for things to pass when one of the two main parties oppose it.

The amendment would just be part of the regulation, just one aspect, even if the amendment were to pass.

However, the Illinois Department of Transportation, which handled the bidding process, rejected the protest last week. Nevertheless, Caterpillar has filed a second appeal against the decision.

If there was going to be some populist backlash against this in any state, it would be in Illinois. Caterpillar's head quarters are in Peoria, IL (I actually work there :D), and this would bring a lot of money into the area and would certainly boost the economy. It is actually an encouraging sign for foreign business that the Illinois DoT *did not* accept the initial appeal. However, just like the debacle with the SNCF in Maryland and Florida, this issue could resurface as a holocaust/nazi issue as opposed to an issue with the bidding process.

Well you just can't amend the treaties through parliament.

The treaties are what is called *primary law*. 

Parliament makes laws that draw their power from the treaties, they are called *secondary laws*.

So, EU gov'ts can sign new treaties, who amend the previous treaties (which give parliament its power to make secondary law), but Parliament can't make laws that amend the treaties.

If you want a parallel think of the american constitution vs laws passed by congress. The only way congress can change the constitution is through a special procedure, the rest of the time the laws it makes have to follow the constitution.

The UK system is different, because you do not have ""rankings"" between different laws, so it doesn't really work as a comparison.

What parliament CAN do is amend this particular piece of legislation (the Connected Continent regulation).

That said, if there was a minimum speed requirement, and *if* the Siemens trains dont meet that, I think Siemens should be forced to revise and resubmit its bid, or if it is not then the other companies should be allowed to revise their bids to allow them to disregard the minimum speed. 

Despite what a lot of people think, there is not a massive backlash when foreign companies do business in the US. Its very common. For instance Bombardier got the contract to replace all of Chicago light rail cars (worth hundreds of millions of dollars). 

Many people claim the Nazi protest over that French bid for light rail was protectionist. That theory fails to take into account 3 additional French companies, one Australian, and one Swedish companies are also bidding. Holocaust survivors legitimately took issue with that one company, it was not a protectionist move disguised as a Holocaust protest (although I still think it is ridiculous).

Non penso tu sia un babbeo, altrimenti non ti risponderei seriamente. Certo che mi sembra complicato da negare che ci sia una certa avversione dei media verso la Russia di Putin (tanto che per trovare voci fuori dal coro devi rivolgerti a pazzoidi poco allineati come Cacciari).

è ovvio che Putin sta mostrando i muscoli, ma il referendum, seppur discutibilissimo, è una via di uscita relativamente decente dallo stallo.

Poi non si capisce perché e a che titolo le forze occidentali vogliano mettere bocca su questa consultazione, quando invece robe similari fatte in passato con la protezione dell'esercito americano sono sempre state salutate come grandi esempi di democrazia.

Io penso che si sia voluto dipingere questo referendum come una barzelletta totale, quando ammetti anche tu onestamente che in Crimea è evidente il sentimento maggioritario. Ci sono state delle indirette pressioni per la presenza delle milizie? Boh, forse, non lo sapremo mai con certezza, possiamo ipotizzarlo.

Il 97% è spropositato? Sì, è probabile, ma possiamo contestarlo in discorsi da bar o poco più, dal momento che non c'erano osservatori internazionali a controllarlo (e d'accordo che il motivo è che è stato tirato su in fretta e furia).

Sono d'accordo persino sul fatto che il governo ucraino si rafforza e di molto, ma la Russia, come sostengo dal mio primo post, sta perseguendo dei suoi interessi: probabilmente si rende conto che la partita sull'Ucraina intera è persa, almeno cerca di tenersi la Crimea, dove sa di poter contare su una popolazione benevolente.

The Baltic states are all, however, member states, and an attack against them would be an act of war against all member states, from the US to Albania.

NATO leaders were smart about this situation. Not only is Ukraine not part of NATO, but the majority of Crimeans really did want to join Russia. I remember going there in the 90s (place was so broke that we Hungarians could go there and pretend to be rich for a week :D ), way before this escalated, and even then most people still viewed it as part of Russia. Not only does NATO not have a legal obligation to Ukraine, it would also be in the moral wrong any way you slice it.

If Russia would invade the Ukrainian-majority lands of central/western Ukraine, then the second argument would be null and void. But, in reality, letting this one slip isn't that big of a deal because the majority of Crimea (even with the bogus/illegitimate referendum) do actually want to join Russia. Not the most humanitarian move, I know (imagine what's going to happen to the Ukrainians/Tatars who protested against Russian annexation). However, this doesn't give grounds for us, European NATO member states, to be shitting our pants. Nobody expected the US to go into Ukraine and they didn't.

The only reason everybody is up in arms about the Crimean situation is that the result isn't surprising. Personally, I think NATO should fast-track what remains of Ukraine to member status.

Anyways, once again, Ukraine: no, Baltic states: yes. The US isn't going to abandon NATO member states, as it hasn't done so in the past. As far as NATO goes, when has the US abandoned any of the member states? What reason do you have - other than speculation, which isn't reason anyways - that the US would give up now? The Berlin Crisis showed that the US will not bow to Russia when NATO members (West Germany in that case) are threatened.

It probably won't come to war anyways. Russia knows where NATO's borders end. Anything outside of the borders is fair game; inside, not at all. Therefore, worry not Baltic states.",0,1395174323,null,0,false,0,cg5w2wc,t3_20qmup,t1_cg5w2wc,t1_cg5v7fb,null,1432964446,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

...

&gt;The Mistral warships are just the tip of EU arms transfers to Russia.
The ambiguities of national positions and limitations of Western leverage aside, there is one particular area which should immediately be on the table for discussion - exports of military equipment and military technology transfers that are taking place between some EU countries and Russia.
...

&gt;It not only boosts Russia’s “power projection” capabilities, but also involves transfer of some sophisticated military technology that Russia will be all too glad to incorporate into developing its domestic defence industrial base and future military capabilities.

...

&gt;One recent sale is particularly worrying: German authorities have agreed to sell to Russia a state-of-the-art brigade-level training facility, which is currently available only to the most technologically advanced Western nations.

&gt;For Rheinmetall Defence, one of Germany’s largest producers of military equipment, the order is worth over €100 million.

Maybe Lenin was right. It looks like the West certainly is happy to ""sell us the rope with which we will hang them.""

&gt; your

&gt; sigh

I typed this on my phone. I'm actually surprised that this was the worst typo. Also, completely irrelevant to the topic.

&gt; &gt; Anyway, I already said what I meant with ""vocabulary"" and why.

&gt; &gt; Even by your completely incorrect definition, your post was 72.6% Germanic (when I didn't count names and counted contractions as single words).

&gt; My definition only includes verbs and nouns. You included everything. But you didn't include ""names"", even though that's the same thing as nouns.

Why? Verbs, nouns, and adjectives aren't important. They can change and be replaced extremely easily. When's the last time a new pronoun, preposition, or conjunction was introduced to English?

&gt; Most of the *important* **words,** *verbs* and *nouns*, **we're** *using* **here are** *Romance.* **That's** what **I meant** by *""vocabulary"".* Most **English** *vocabulary* **is,** *simply* **put,** *French.*

Still 59.1% Germanic. And this is a technical discussion, which has a much higher percentage of Romance words than an average day-to-day conversation

&gt; As for structure, I mean sentence structure and word structure. Words in Germanic are formed by agglutination. In Romance and English, they're not. Sentences in English follow a Romance structure. The things English has in common with Germanic are actually Indo-European, which is also present in Romance.

&gt; Moving on, ""using"" is latin, from usus.

Yes. My mistake.

&gt; ""Is"" is latin from French ""es"".

Is is from the Old English is, the third person singular of the verb ""wesan."" Also, es is the second person singular. The third person singular was est.

&gt; ""In"" is latin.

In is from the Old English ""in.""

&gt; ""Not"" is latin.

""Not"" is from the Old English ""noht.""

&gt; Even if you ignore that, you repeated words in your percentage count. I suggest you go learn the basics of statistics. It might come useful to a reddit professor like you.

I was counting what percent of your post was Germanic, because more common words should be given more weight. If you look at the entire (recorded) English lexicon, Romance words far outnumber Germanic words, but the majority of them are never used outside of highly specialist fields, and are therefore not important to calculating the total number of Romance vs Germanic words in a language.

---------------

Even if English did have more English words, that wouldn't make it a Romance language. English is Germanic because it is descended from Middle English, which is descended from Old English, which is descended from Proto-Germanic.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"This is nothing new. Central banks control the amount of money in circulation. Of course they can print as much as they want, but printing too much can be detrimental. There are countless examples of governments expanding the currency stock too much which leads to inflation or hyperinflation. 

Now there is the opposite side of the coin. It is widely held the ECB is not printing enough. So in that sense, the ECB should print more Euros and have a systematic devaluation. It would ward of deflation and provide liquidity for cash strapped nations experiencing austerity. So in that sense there is more to go around. 

That said, value comes from somewhere. To visualize this picture an economy that generates 1000 kilos of gold worth of output per year and has a currency stock of 1 billion imaginary dollars (assume purchasing power of gold stays the same). If the central bank increases the currency stock to 2 billion imaginary dollars but the economic output remains 1000 kilos of gold, prices in imaginary dollars would increase substantially, but real wealth/value of the economy would remain the same. 

Despite what the Guardian suggests, there is not an unlimited amount of dollars, euros, pounds, etc. a central bank can print. Far from it. Increasing the currency stock is a balancing act between the amount of money in circulation, the velocity of money (how quickly its spent), interest rates, and a whole slew of other factors a central bank must take into account (international climate, etc.). 

The ""popular"" notions the article describes have not been widely accepted for a very long time, at least by people who do the most remedial amount of research on banking. We live in a globalized world. If people think Barclay's, JP Morgan, or Deutsche Bank operate like their neighborhood credit union they've been wearing blinders. 

This article is further evidence of how little the Guardian seems to know about economics or international finance. This is not a groundbreaking report, and central banks know how currencies work. This is not groundbreaking, it seems it is mostly to try to explain how it works to people who are not familiar with it. If central banks took the guardian's advice every country would look like Zimbabwe.

**TL;DR: This ""article"" is *way* oversimplified. Money isn't limitless, but most economists think the ECB is not expanding the monetary stock nearly fast enough. That said, currency stock expansion must match economic expansion, or a little more if the velocity of money is low.
