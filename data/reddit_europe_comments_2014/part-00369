_______________________________________

Meine Position dazu ist relativ differenziert: Zunächst finde Ich den Begriff schonmal Schwachsinn. Politische Korrektheit existiert nicht und daher gibt es auch keine Politische Inkorrektheit. Wo Politische Korrektheit ideologisch als Bezeichnung für den achso linken Mainstreams und Meinungsterror dient, bewegt man sich imho in ideologisch-übertriebenen und irrational-populistischen Lagerkampfgefilden.

In den allermeisten Fällen wird politische Korrektheit von den seriöseren Akteuren als Vorwurf für [übertriebenen Moralismus oder dergleichen](http://www.novo-argumente.com/magazin.php/novo_notizen/artikel/politische_korrektheit_wider_den_aufstand_der_gutmenschen) benutzt. Das kann durchaus gerechtfertigt sein. Ich halte mich da sehr pragmatisch.

Aber erstmal ein Beispiel: einen Schwarzen einen 'Schwarzen' -statt 'Neger'- zu nennen, hat absolut nichts mit Politischer Korrektheit zu tun, sondern mit faktischen Sprachkonventionen der Gesellschaft und daher mit Anstand und Respekt gegenüber Mitmenschen. Allgemein sehen Schwarze ""Neger"" heute als Schimpfwort an, da es Jahrzehntelang flächendeckend immer pejorativer verwendet wurde - als pejorativ ansehen tut es nun ja auch der Großteil der Deutschen unter 50. Die Suche nach neutralen Konnotaten hat uns also den Begriff ""Schwarzer"" etabliert. So funktioniert nunmal Sprache - sie ist organisch und flexibel. [Konnotate sind nicht in Stein gemeiselt](http://www.literaturkritik.de/public/online_abo/online_lexikon.php?option=item&amp;task=show&amp;id=813), sondern ändern sich ständig - auch innerhalb verschiedener Milieus, Altersgruppen oder geographischen Regionen. Somit entstehen auch mal schwer zu vermittelnde und abzubauende sprachliche Differenzen, das war schon immer so und das verstehe ich. Vor allem daher würde es meiner Meinung nach einigen guttun, ihre Hysterie bei solchen Reizthemen dahin zu packen wo sie hingehört: in den Müll.

Jedenfalls: ist so ein Konnotat erstmal auf breiter Linie als abwertend betrachtet, also **konventionalisiert**, hat jeder der das rückgängig machen will imho ernste Probleme, weil er scheinbar unfähig ist seinen Mitmenschen einen Gefallen für reibungsloses und respektvolles Miteinander zu tun. Das kann an tatsächlichen Ressentiments oder Gruppenhass liegen, oder er will einfach provozieren und im Internet ""ein paar Linke/Gutmenschen aufmischen"", die seiner Meinung daran Schuld sind, dass sich ein Konnotat im Verlauf mehrerer Jahrzehnte gewandelt hat. Ich empfinde das als eine Art verkappten, stur konservativen Antikonformismus.

So viel zum sprachwissenschaftlichen Aspekt dahinter.

Es gibt auch jene Gesellen, die einfach nur Immoralität, das heißt Arschlochhaftigkeit und auch nicht selten Ressentiments, gegenüber Mitmenschen mit dem Vorwurf der fiesen political correctness cachieren wollen. Jene sind im Unrecht und verdrehen Opferrollen. Sie sind schnell erkennbar und leisten der seriösen, moderateren und intelektuelleren (also der klassisch konservativen, aber nicht wirklich rechten) Anti-PC Gruppierung wohl auch eher einen massiven Bärendienst.

Es ist also kein Wunder, dass der Begriff der Politischen Korrektheit durch inflationären Gebrauch von Rechten oder Rechtskonservativen vergiftet ist - obwohl er imho ja nicht vollständig abzulehnen ist, da es immer mindestens Extrembeispiele für krassen, invasiven Moralismus mit Universalgültigkeitsanspruch gibt der mich persönlich auch eher abstößt. Es fällt allerdings auf, dass der Vorwurf des Moralismus leider oft einfach stammtisch-like auf ganz normale und moderate -nicht radikalmoralische- Positionen angewandt wird. Gerechtfertigte Vorgänge der Antidiskriminierung und der Verbesserung  menschlichen und gesellschaftlichen Miteinanders werden so oft versucht in den Dreck zu ziehen. An der Stelle ist für mich eine Linie überschritten, weil das ein Ausdruck der persönlichen Distanz zu den ""Opfern"" dieser gesellschaftlichen Diskriminierung ist, ein Ausdruck des Unwillens zum Verstehen und der Integration, der Respektlosigkeit und nicht zuletzt ein Ausdruck der Apologetik für Immoralismus oder Diskriminierung, also für schlechtes Benehmen - und zb für sprachliche Beleidigung anderer.

Ich finde, man sieht schnell wer keinen Plan von PC hat und ""politische Inkorrektheit"" nur benutzt um sich zu profilieren, dummes Zeug zu reden und allgemein gegen links zu hetzen - und wer mit seiner Kritik an vermuteter Politischer Korrektheit auch mal bestimmte Aspekte der PC-Gegenseite mindestens zum Teil empfindlich trifft.

Es ist nur leider so: Dieser seriöse Vorwurf aus der moderaten Rechten und konservativen Gruppen trifft aber eigentlich nur in der radikal-ideologischen linken Ecke. Und aus der radikal-ideologischen rechten/konservativen Ecke wird auf die moderate Linke gezielt.

Man sieht: Kommt diese Debatte also in der moderaten, gesellschaftlichen Mitte an, hat das durch die radikale Erscheinung des Gegenübers fast immer eine Zunahme der unbegründeten Hysterie und Konfrontation zwischen den ja eigentlich moderateren Lagern zur Folge, womit durch die temporäre Radikalisierung eine langsam wieder abebbende Scheinkonfrontation um Scheinprobleme geschaffen wird. Die Diskussion um vermeintliche politische Korrektheit ist also bedeutend krasser aufgeblasen und ideologisch vergiftet, als das eigentliche Thema um das es geht: Moralismus mit seinem Grad und Platz in der Gesellschaft, sowie allgemein gesellschaftliche und sprachliche Konventionen.

&gt; but when you allow private, better services, and then crap on state owned just for sake of it, of course private owned are better, but that's the fucking problem. they don't need to be and if they weren't things would be so much better.

The private services have the audacity to be of a better quality than the public ones - let's ban them! Flawless logic.

To answer your question, here's a relevant quote from our constitution:
&gt; Zakazane jest istnienie partii politycznych i innych organizacji odwołujących się w swoich programach do totalitarnych metod i praktyk działania nazizmu, faszyzmu i komunizmu, a także tych, których program lub działalność zakłada lub dopuszcza nienawiść rasową i narodowościową, stosowanie przemocy w celu zdobycia władzy lub wpływu na politykę państwa albo przewiduje utajnienie struktur lub członkostwa.

And here's a quick translation I threw together.
&gt; The existence of political parties and other organizations basing their programs on totalitarian methods and practices of nazism, fascism and communism, or those that promote or allow racial and national hatred, the use of violence as means of achieving power or influence over national politics or holds it's structure and membership secret is forbidden.

So, a political party in Poland, that would base it's program on non-violent brand of Communism, would be legal. It's just practically they would have absolutely zero chance of ever getting elected.

Schön dass du hier versuchst wissenschaftlich zu belehren- ich muss aber insbesondere beim sprachwissenschaftlichen Teil radikal widersprechen. Du redest Unsinn und verfehlst das Kernprinzip hinter der ganzen Debatte um nichtdiskriminierende Sprache.


Denn scheinbar übergehst du das übliche sprachwissenschaftliche Prinzip des ** Konnotat/Denotat-Verhältnis**. Dieses Prinzip steht hinter sehr vielen gesellschaftlichen Konflikten um Sprache. Deine Schlussfolgerung beim Term ""Neger"" ist daher falsch und nicht objektiv oder gar sprachwissenschaftlich. Hab das jetzt auch schon anhand von diesem Beispiel dreimal das letzte Jahr auf /r/de ausgeführt (auch hier im Thread wieder), weil es mich erstaunt wieviel Gerede es um sowas simples gibt. Wann verstehen die Leute endlich, dass Konnotate von Zeit zu Zeit, von Region zu Region und von Person zu Person unterschiedlich sind? Und dass Konvention als schwammiger und flexibler Begriff das einzige ist, was das Konnotat in einer Sprache ansatzweise ""definieren"" kann? Kein Duden und kein Sprachpfleger vermag es Sprache zu konservieren. Kapiert es endlich. Stichwort Sprachwandel.


Liegt vielleicht an unserem coolen, alten Deutschlehrer damals, der Germanistik studiert hat und sicher weder Linker, ""Politisch Korrekter"", noch Konservativer war.

false,Hiddencamper,null,null,"Nuclear engineer and reactor operator here. 

The Ukraine plant's main generator saw an electrical disturbance. This causes an automatic generstor lockout, which in turn tells the turbine to trip, which in turn causes an automatic reactor scram (because the turbine doesn't need the steam anymore there is no reason for the reactor to stay online). 

These types of unit shutdowns are responsible for well over 30% of the reactor scrams that occur each year and pose no safety risk. No emergency cooling systems are required, the plant's automatic control systems shut down the core and stabilize it automatically. The risk of core damage is far less than 1 in 100000 per year for all plants combined that have turbine trips. 

The plant is already back online. This is far from an accident, it's actually defined as an expected operational occurrence, something that occurs more than once per year on average, and has no safety impact. There is no core damage due to these events and as a result there is no release of radioactive material. To have a release you need core damage and one of the following: an unisolable leak path out of containment plus a non nuclear boundary breach, or a failure of the reactor coolant system and a failure of the primary and secondary containments. If any of these had happened it would be all over the news. This talk about radioactive death clouds is not based in physics or the reality of the situation at this plant. The fact that it's back online proves that these did not happen, as these units are boiling reactors. If core damage occurred, the core would have been well over the temperatures required for the control rods to melt, meaning the core would have no control rods and would be under an emergency boration, which precludes reactor startup. 

If you want to ask questions about any of the above please let me know. But from everything I've seen and read, this looks like a typical turbine trip on the non nuclear side of the plant, it looks like the media blew it out of proportion, and the unit is already back online (1-3 days is typical turnaround time for a turbine trip).

Fascism isn't the equivalent of futurism, and while there are certainly elements of fascism that tend to romanticise ""the future"" as a technological panacea, it is strictly conservative in terms of values. Fascism reflects the fact that it was invented during industrialisation, and like Communism, it places huge emphasis on technological, industrial progress. However, it does certainly *not* emphasise values we now consider ""progressive"", such as equal rights for minorities, multiculturalism, and globalisation.

Fascism is traditionalist in the sense that it values traditional patriarchal, heteronormative lifestyles, as well as the cultural practices belonging to each specific brand of nationalism.

&gt; And here's the major problem: If their ideology doesn't contain the cornerstones of fascism, it's obviously not fascism anymore.

Nello specifico: quella critica era completamente infondata. Non è che  ognuno che critica ha automaticamente ragione e io torto, eh? Io ho semplicemente scritto che Letta aveva uno zio nel partito di B. Senza tirare conclusioni. Tutto il resto, il ""bias"", è un'elaborazione sua.

La discussione è andata gambe all'aria per la sua aggressività (lo ha perfino ammesso).

&gt;If you could witness people’s faces and expressions when they talk about their experiences, if you could touch their reality a little bit, the reality of the Syrians… You might consequently know what the Italians are for most of them – the Italian marines in particular.

They give you the honour of the first step to Europe, and that’s in their own country. They try to persuade you to stay in Italy; they tell you how beautiful it is and also how poor it is, and of course, that the choice is yours in the end. When you say no, they show you the way to go, to wherever you want.

false,jtalin,EURO,Green Europe,"&gt; I completely agree with you, but where do we draw the line between war and appeasement?
&gt; 

There's a lot in between. First of all, Europe is not appeasing Russia, because Russia is not capable of being a real threat to Europe or NATO. Any steps we take to resolve the conflict are merely steps to end this nuisance that is hurting our already shaken economy, rather than appeasement.

If you look at Russia's behavior, it's not a behavior of a conqueror - it's a behavior of an opportunistic regime. They saw the *opportunity* to seize parts of Ukraine following Euromaidan, and they took it. They did not openly invade the country, they supported the existing insurgents with men and military hardware. That's not how a country that can conquer Europe acts like. 

Russia will never dare to mess with EU or NATO countries, so the chances of them escalating the conflict to a critical point are fairly low. 

&gt; But how much of Ukraine are we willing to let Russia take before appeasement is no longer an option? Also are we willing to have a failed state in Europe like Ukraine is close to becoming? because being torn between the EU and Russia will not have positive consequences.

There's a bigger chance that Ukraine will be a failed state if this conflict is prolonged, than if it is resolved, no matter what the territorial resolution ends up being.

Call me selfish, but I honestly don't want to fight a war over Crimea, and I don't want to pay for a new cold war over it, or prolong a situation that's only going to leave us with a high body count. If I have to choose between Ukraine recognizing or giving up Crimea and Donbass on one side and enduring an (at best) cold war that could last for decades and be incredibly dangerous and volatile given the nature of Russian leadership on the other side -- then sorry Ukraine, but I'd rather keep the rest of the world (relatively) safe than Ukrainian borders intact.

War isn't an option, because a large scale war isn't a war that's *winnable*. It's a war that everybody would lose. Sure, Russia would lose it *MORE*, but I don't want to pay the price for that kind of a ""victory"". No one sane should want to fight that war.

Uuuh, sto tremando.

&gt;Non hai capito niente.

Infatti. Solo tu capisci.

&gt;Il mio ateismo e le mie bestemmie non hanno mai ucciso nessuno.

Neanche la religione o i testi sacri l'hanno mai fatto: sono stati piuttosto l'intolleranza, la presunzione e la violenza, che possono usare qualsiasi pretesto, anche il migliore. Anche l'ateismo.

A meno che non pensi che gli armeni siano stati uccisi da copie del Corano semoventi, o che la pedofilia sia una conseguenza naturale e necessaria del cattolicesimo. 

In quest'ultimo caso dovresti mostrare dati scritturali, dato che fai il fondamentalista (nel senso che valgono solo i testi e non i millenni di tradizione successiva) solo quando conviene a te.

Se vogliamo giocare al gioco di deresponsabilizzare le persone e dare la colpa a fattori esterni, allora perché non incolpare la scienza e la tecnologia, che sono stati strumenti per uccidere gli armeni?

È la scienza che ha permesso la bomba atomica, e la religione non ha avuto nessuna parte nelle tragedie peggiori del '900: l'ideologia nazista era basata sull'antropologia delle razze di fine '800, e il regime comunista era ateo, e la bomba atomica è stata costruita con la scienza.

Però a nessuno, **giustamente**, viene in mente di incolpare la scienza in sé.

Ogni prodotto culturale, nessuno escluso, è uno strumento senza volontà. Sta poi a chi lo usa, utilizzarlo per il bene comune o per la distruzione.

false,Nidmorr,EURO,Romania,"&gt;If you look at Russia's behavior, it's not a behavior of a conqueror - it's a behavior of an opportunistic regime. They saw the opportunity to seize parts of Ukraine following Euromaidan, and they took it. They did not openly invade the country, they supported the existing insurgents with men and military hardware. That's not how a country that can conquer Europe acts like.

Not entirely true, Russians have created that situation there for decades, it was not something opportunistic, they were prepared and clearly had plans for it, this is nothing new for Russia, they are very well versed in this type of action, nothing that happened after the Maidan happened by ""chance"".

&gt;Russia will never dare to mess with EU or NATO countries, so the chances of them escalating the conflict to a critical point are fairly low.

Exactly, that's why Russia is using the tactics that it is using.

&gt;There's a bigger chance that Ukraine will be a failed state if this conflict is prolonged, than if it is resolved, no matter what the territorial resolution ends up being.

Highly debatable, since the conflict is contained in a certain region rather than nationwide we can't know for sure the effects of either options. Plus resolving this issue is highly ambiguous, there is no solving this problem any more, it has passed that moment long ago. Most likely outcome is this will become a frozen conflict.

&gt;Call me selfish, but I honestly don't want to fight a war over Crimea...

Nobody truly wants that, the difference here is that Russian action must be considered in the wider context, Russians are not just reacting to something, they were preparing for this type of scenario years in advance, they have aspirations on extending their territory on the North Pole and in general Putin's Russia is one that is supposed to counter the US on the global level.

&gt; Well, I like having a marketplace of ideas.

So do neonazis. They love being able to convince people to displace and murder minorities, immigrants, leftists and other members of the working class. I don't think states having a mandate to ban ideologies is the best, but a state upholding ""the marketplace of ideologies"" might as well make it open season for victims of nazism.

&gt; All of this would all be protected free speech in the United States

The United States? The country that has [multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts) [sedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917) acts on the books? The country that had the Red Scare and [backed multiple anti-communist regimes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5rVD_TXrjo) (that were sometimes totalitarian and even *genocidal* because of it)? The country that conducted the [Palmer Raids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Raids)? The country that snuffed out Civil Rights leaders? That kind of country protects free speech?

&gt; I'd argue that it is because people can speak freely and can have ""little revolutions"" of voting people out or in that we can find meeting points on a gradient of ideology.

No revolution has succeeded by voting alone. Only through (sometimes violent) extraparliamentary pressures do voters or governments concede.

Also, due to the repression of *actual* free speech I listed above, the political landscape in the United States is in want of diversity. Revolutionary left ideas are just *barely* back from the dead in the United States. Its Communist Party capitulates to the Democrats, other socialist parties are small and fragmented, and there's not much of a conscious anarchist movement to speak of here (no, [lolbertarians and ancaps](http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionF1) don't count).

&gt; It is only via discussion and via people being able to show that claims or arguments are false that one can expect to have the ""best ideas"" come to the fore.

Ignoring the role of indoctrination, when it comes to political ideas, since those seeking to spread their idea face institutions of power, they must *also* use power to do this. Some ideas (like Nazism, Stalinism/Maoism, and, I'd argue, liberal capitalism) have required the deaths of millions to be believed and maintained, while others have not.

&gt; Certain political ideologies are viewed as too dangerous in Europe to be protected by freedom of speech.

The reason this is the case is precisely because they resulted in the deaths of *millions*.

3) Point out that the limited support for democracy in communism was mostly tied to the assumption that almost everyone secretly wanted communism.

4) Point out the incompatibility of having 100% state owned media and anything resembling an election - something that has been abused literally everywhere it's existed.

Same would be used/is being used in Russia, creating an opening for ""war in Europe"" and i don't think that its that of a good idea to be honest. 


As for Transnistria and Georgia, those conflicts date back a couple decades at least in a situation of political turmoil caused by dissolution of Soviet Union. Georgian 2008 ""adventures"" are not so clear case of Russia's fault in my opinion, since Russia also has its side of the story and its a whole lot more plausible from international law viewpoint than Georgian one.


As for ""examples"" of interference, i don't really care about political bickering or domestic propaganda from either side and its weird to appeal for evidence, when both West and Russia are engaged in propaganda war against each other, with constant throwing of random allegations or ""evidence"", only later to be completely and utterly false from either side (or not providing any evidence at all with an excuse of ""its a secret, shhhh""). 


I don't have a job in SVR/FSB nor do i have a daily intelligence reports available for me, but i have seen plenty of bullshit propaganda and ""op-ed/articles"" about ""Evil Russia doing evil things"" here and in other places, mostly Western oriented, so i am not going to pretend that i know the extent to which Polish or Romanian ""volunteers"" might be involved in Ukraine. 


For all i know, i've seen plenty of articles about jihadis traveling to Syria by the thousands from Europe to wage a war and behead people, the possibility of Russia-hating nationalists travelling to South-Eastern Ukraine is there, its accepted by Ukrainian government in forms of volunteer batallions and Russia had plenty of ""freedom fighters"" during Chechen campaigns (including people from Arab nations, Ukrainian nationalists and so on). To think that ""this time its different and impossible"" you only need to go back a year ago, when you thought that war in Europe was an impossible thing and Russia was just a corrupt drunktard with funny videos from Youtube.

A child is running away from where its parents are and doing something clearly wrong. Now parents shout to it to come back, but the child ignores them. Parent come to the child and try to stop it by speaking to it, but the child won't listen. Parents catch their hand and try to forcefully stop them. 

They use force, but it is not punishment, or its it?

Next, the child starts to struggle to get away from parent and ignores whatever they say, as the parent has not enough authority to stop it from doing. Any kinds of threats provided by parent aren't enough, as child refuses to accept that whatever they do is wrong. The parent finally slaps their butt with hand to attract their attention.

Now, the single slap was clearly a punishment, but the purpose wasn't to punish the child (if it was, parent would slap the child several times, so it would actually hurt), but to catch their attention. Catching the attention was necessary because otherwise the child might have done something bad or dangerous and there was no other way to do it verbally, as child was indifferent to any peaceful actions.

Now if corporal punishment is not used for the sole purpose of punishment, so was the parent at fault?

These are all Places, where sometime hundreds, but mostly THOUSANDS of People come together to protest the accomodation of refugees. 

Germany has seen a massive increase in attacks against refugee housing, attacks against refugees themselves and demonstrations and agitation against refugees. 

People of (presumed) origin other than german tell stories of discrimination on a daily basis. Attempts of self-organizing are thwarted by police and policy. Racial Profiling is common. 

Right Wing neonazi Terrorists were able to murder presumed foreigners for 10 years. They have not been caught because someone tipped them off (which happened years before the case was revealed to the public) but pretty much because of a coincidence. The involvment of federal and state authorities in these crimes is in question. 

And I didn't even begin to describe german laws about immigration.
Of course all of this is also a european problem. The european Borders are sealed off militarily, it's getting harder and more expensive to get there. And even if you did it, you'll be put in jail in germany for paying a ""considerable amount"" of money to be brought here, according to an anti-immigration law which has just been passed. For fleeing war and terror....

Stories like the one Humam Hamdoun tells are great and I wish everyone would be treated like that. They're just not the rule.

No. La gente sta iniziando a capire. Quando ero ragazzo non potevi dire ""sono ateo"" altrimenti rischiavi le legnate o il licenziamento. Oggi non c'e' piu' la pressione sociale e la gente puo' finalmente dichiararsi atea senza conseguenze. Ai miei tempi andavano tutti in chiesa e il seminario era pieno di studenti, ora la chiesa e' vuota (a parte per gli africani che vanno a cercare da mangiare) cosi' come i seminari.

&gt;Neanche la religione o i testi sacri l'hanno mai fatto

Direttamente no, ma gli abusi sono stati commessi da gente che lo faceva con l'approvazione della comunita' religiosa e con la sanzione della religione. La religione non ha fatto l'omicidio, ma e' stata il mandante. Bella differenza!

&gt;In quest'ultimo caso dovresti mostrare dati scritturali

Te li ho dati, se tu non li sai leggere non e' colpa mia. Te li riscrivo in modo piu' semplice:

* Sura 3 versetto 56
* Sura 4 versetto 104
* Sura 8 versetto 15
* Sura 9 versetto 5 (il concetto di Dhimmi)
* Sura 18 versetti 65-81 (il delitto d'onore e' cosa buona e giusta)
* Sura 33 versetti 60-62 (massacrare ebrei e cristiani e' cosa buona e giusta)

I millenni di tradizione successiva non contano niente, dato che nell'Islam il Corano ha la precedenza su tutto quello che viene scritto dopo e che non si puo' reinterpretare. Back off, boy, conosco bene il Corano. Fatti spiegare la differenza tra le sure della Mecca e quelle della Medina, oltre ai concetti di Naskh (tafsir) e di Taquiyya.

&gt;Però a nessuno, giustamente, viene in mente di incolpare la scienza in sé.

Certo, perche' la scienza non ha mai detto: ""ammazzate XXX e andrete in paradiso"", mentre la religione lo ha sempre fatto. Ripeto, la religione e' il mandante dell'omicidio, il fanatico e' l'assassino, la scienza e' il coltello usato per l'omicidio. Nessuno sano di mente incolperebbe il coltello...

&gt;tl;dr: Religions don't kill people, people kill people. Ti e' chiara la differenza, ora? (cit.)

Se facessi il conto di quante guerre di religione e omicidi a sfondo religioso ci sono stati e ci sono ancora, forse ti verrebbe il dubbio che sia la religione a trasformare persone normalmente pacifiche in assassini psicopatici... 



Parlando della pedofilia nel cristianesimo, la risposta e' semplice: qualunque ideologia, quando prende il potere economico e politico, fara' di tutto per conservarlo. Per le gerarchie religiose la Chiesa e' tutto, quindi il fatto che ci siano preti pedofili non li turba piu' di tanto. La Chiesa ha protetto i preti e messo le vittime a tacere, perche' riteneva (e ritiene) la propria immagine pubblica piu' importante delle soffernze dei bambini.
Una qualunque religione che riesca a ottenere potere economico e politico avra' fenomeni come la pedofilia. Per la cronaca, ci sono molti piu' casi di pedofili tra imam e mullah, ma non se ne parla dato che l'islam e' ancora politicamente ed economicamente potente, in grado di proteggere i suoi pedofili e fare tacere le vittime. Se ci pensi, e' avvenuto PRIMA il declino economico e politico del cristianesimo, POI sono venuti alla luce gli scandali a sfondo pedofilo. Se potessi leggere i giornali esteri sapresti che ci sono stati centinaia di casi orribili, di cui non e' passato neanche il 2% sui giornali italiani.

Also, most of the institutes provide the demographic composition of their samples, demonstrating that their samples are more diverse than you might think.

Lastly, even commercial survey companies cannot deviate too much from reaility, since there are large scientific panels, such as [GESIS' ALLBUS \(The German General Social Survey\)](http://www.gesis.org/en/allbus). Additionally, there are university panels and studies.

All of the above does not mean we should accept every survey without question. However, sampling is often not the primary problem. Slightly suggestive questions and answer options are far more widespread and it always pays to look into what was actually asked and what respondents actually answered.

Wut? E dove, di grazia? Solo ora li hai scritti.

&gt;I millenni di tradizione successiva non contano niente, dato che nell'Islam il Corano ha la precedenza su tutto quello che viene scritto dopo e che non si puo' reinterpretare.

[citation needed] Quella è la definizione di fondamentalismo, da cui l'Islam, che ci creda o no, ha da sempre preso le distanze.

&gt;Back off, boy, conosco bene il Corano. Fatti spiegare la differenza tra le sure della Mecca e quelle della Medina, oltre ai concetti di Naskh (tafsir) e di Taquiyya.

Dio santo, quanta spocchia e presunzione, che è proprio il motivo per cui il fondamentalismo ateo come il tuo non è ben visto.

Presumi che non sappia le cose, quando invece, ironia della sorte, sei tu che non sai che l'Islam si basa molto sull'interpretazione e anzi *in linea del tutto teorica* la *ummah* dei credenti potrebbe anche decidere qualcosa che contraddica il Corano, se ciò non è più valido.

Le varie scuole coraniche hanno tutte pari dignità, come le interpretazioni, se fatte con criterio.

Se poi decidi di attaccarti solo ai testi sacri per attaccare le religioni, e ignori (o per ignoranza o per malafede), che l'Islam si è sempre presentato come la religione ""del giusto mezzo"" e ha sempre condannato i fondamentalismi, o ignori la teologia cattolica che si è distaccata dall'Antico Testamento e ha promosso valori di pace e amore, stai propugnando una visione necessariamente distorta delle cose.

""Ho letto il Corano"" o ""ho letto la Bibbia"", mi sento dire spesso dai critici più accesi, ma se poi uno ignora le tradizioni successive che ne hanno spesso smussato gli angoli, e si ferma a criticare i testi per smontare tutte le religioni, sta procedendo in maniera intellettualmente disonesta.

Veramente, prima di accusare di ignoranza, scendi un attimo dal piedistallo, se no ti ricopri di ridicolo, ""boy"":

I insinuate that you can engineer bullshit excuses to invade sovereign nations and bomb them into oblivion, effectively throwing countries into chaos of civil war. I insinuate that you can provide tear jerking videos of daughters of ambassadors about ""baby killers"" in an effort to move the population to rally against ""brutal regime"", i insinuate that you can provide arms and military training for ""our guys"" without any consent from Russian public opinion, i insinuate that Russia can ""engineer"" discontent in South-East Ukraine and sponsor terror and fringe groups in an effort to achieve its goals. 


As for dictatorship, i believe mr.Yanukovych as corrupt of a piece of shit as he was, was a democratically elected leader, but nonetheless he was ""subverted"" under a standing ovation from European Union and U.S (with plenty of officials traveling on Maidan, citing their support and ""not-so-covert financial assistance"" from various NGOs, USAID programs and other State Department pet projects). 


I am not going to pretend that ""general West"" had no role in Euromaidan, since i see a clear conflict of interest in what West says and what it did. You were interested in a specific outcome, initially you lost to a *Russian diplomatic approach* of ""providing aid in terms of gas discounts and cash"" (which is a bribe, but you guys call it ""aid/assistance package"", so lets stick with aid then).


&gt;3) Saying that the limited role the US has played in Syria is somehow related to Kiev?


A yes, the infamous bystander US did nothing at all a its involvement was very limited, practically none. I sure would believe you if i haven't read anything about guys from Baradey-TV, role of Qatar and its interests in the conflict, role of Iran and Saudi Arabia, history of CIA covert operations and a 2004 invasion of Iraq to name one of the most recent examples. Not to mention the infamous ""no fly zone"" magic trick, fooled Russia like an excellent magician (professional lawyer), i'll give you that. 


Also ""loved"" the chemical weapons attack story, no proof whatsoever provided, former intelligence officers screaming about ""questionable reliability"" of reports, but you almost went the Lybian way there. Ofc continuing to support ""secular freedom fighters"" only later to ""discover"" that they surrender themselves to ISIS with all the advanced weaponry provided to them. Such non-involvement, so wow!


&gt;1) Russia can't counter the US. You're not in the USSR anymore. You're a second tier regional power. Don't confuse belligerence for power.


Russia can turn Ukraine into Hell on Earth and make your ""hegemon lives"" a whole lot harder around the globe in regards to *your* interest worldwide. I believe you had ""pivot"" to take care of on the Pacific theater, can you really afford to reallocate significant amount of resources to counter an extremely hostile Russia unwilling to play by any rules with a goal of hurting or crippling you as much as possible? 


&gt;2) You seem to think US foreign policy revolved around Russia or isolating Russia. Prior to Crimea we barely gave a shit, until our alliances with Baltic states nervous about Ukraine forced us to. We were not acting to ""counter"" Russia, even in Syria.


Russia did very little until Ukraine wanted to become a NATO/European Union member, it also did almost nothing during Euromaidan as well, however it did make its move when ""our guy with our deal"" (as in Kremlin's head, i personally don't give a shit) got thrown out and Russian diplomacy had **no** chance of success.

&gt;*We want to send a political signal, that the 
justified critique of the Russian politics towards Ukraine, may not lead to the destruction of the 25 years worth of relationship*

Well, basically, Ukraine is not worth losing business and money over Ukraine. Is this the correct interpretation?

&gt;Anders ist die für Russland bedrohlich wirkende Ausdehnung des Westens nach Osten ohne gleichzeitige Vertiefung der Zusammenarbeit mit Moskau, wie auch die völkerrechtswidrige Annexion der Krim durch Putin, nicht zu erklären.

&gt;*Russia sees a threatening Western expansion to the east without a broader co-operation with Moscow. Though the illegal annection of Crimea is by this legitimized.*

For the record - the West is not expanding actively. The nation who joined Nato/EU **applied** for membership, not the other way around. And they were not immediately accepted. They had to comply by loads of rules. 

One might also ask oneself, why are those countries looking for a deeper cooperation with the decadent West and not with mighty Russia.

Then the authors continue with a lot of historical jibberish about Russia being a European country and that Germany is in debt to Gorbachov for the united Germany (by forgetting the devide of Germany by Soviet in the first place). They also continue talking vaguely about that all should strive for peace. 

What they miss is that the conflict in Ukraine is a simple case. Putin is very afraid of a successful Ukrainian nation, because it would expose his incompetency as a leader of a nation with the biggest natural resources in the world. He cannot have a genetically, linguistically and mentally almost identical people on his footstep being more successful than he is. In addition to that, Putin is a macho guy who only understands the language of strength, you are welcome to read [this piece](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/angela-merkel-goes-cold-on-putin-relations-after-anti-gay-tirade/story-fnb64oi6-1227139938552). This is the background of why there is a conflict in the first place. You can wonder why there are no massacres of the Russian speaking minorities on Kharkiv, Zaporyzha, Dnipropetrovsk, Odessa.

Let us remember also that everytime someone talks about ""geopolitics"" they already lost to the Russian propaganda. Because this is a conflict which started out as a conflict against a Ukrainian president who was going to build a country Putin-style, where money and interests of the few go before interests of the people.

false,cokkish,ITAL,Italy,"&gt; ""divers"" is pronounced [diˈvɛrs], and so are all other uses of that root in German.

I could have used 'vocat vos' as an example. The consistent pronunciation of 'v' as [v] in every single word is an influence from Ecclesiastical Latin whether the root also shows up in German or not. 

So it's hardly due to a natural process of the German guy who never handled Latin in his whole life and is presented a Latin text for the first time.

What I'm trying to say is that if you take your time to learn a few spelling rules for a new language you might as well learn the good ones and not the made-up version.

&gt; The thing is: Very, very few people care, people want to name bones and muscles and plants and critters with it, usually nothing more.

Yeah, my critic is not towards the use of Latin loanwords in your native language. I myself don't pick an English accent with an English sound inventory in the middle of an Italian sentence just because I happen to use an English word (such as goal or sport or whatever).

But if you're singing a song or reading a text I at least try to conform to the pronunciation as anybody else would and I'd rather not use a fictitious one based on rules that the native speakers don't abide by. The same goes for Latin.  

It frustrates me, because we do even worse in Italy and read Latin using plain Italian spelling rules.

false,classicfighter,BAWU,Baden-Württemberg,"Nundenn, ich fange mal mit dem ""Genderwahn"" an. Du meinst, es ist eine Zeichen des Respekts, wenn man beiden Geschlechtern gleich begegnet, auf sprachlicher Ebene. Ich halte es aber eher sinnlos, weil bspw. wie schon von /u/Grolser richtig erkannt wurde, dass die Anrede ""Sie"" weiblichen Genus ist, theoretisch gegenüber Männern diskriminierend sei / der von die genannte Respekt nicht gezollt wird. Die Analogie lässt sich auf alle Pronomen im Plural (""Die Herren"" etc.) übertragen. Ich sehe hier kein Problem des mangelnden Respekts gegenüber Individuen, sondern einfach nur die das Wesen der Deutschen Sprache. 

Wenn ich das Wort ""Neger"" benutze, dann einfach nur, wie schon gesagt, auf einen Mensch zu referenzieren, den man aufgrund eines besonders speziellen Merkmals (in diesem Fall die schwarze Hautfarbe) eben gut erkennen kann. Ich könnte zwar auch eine detaillierte Beschreibung der Bekleidung oder Gesichtszüge abgeben, aber dies ist oft nicht möglich, weil man die Person nur kurz sieht. So sage ich dann im Alltag zu einem Kollegen: ""Schau mal der Neger da drüben, der hat aber schöne Schuhe an"" oder sowas. ""Neger"" ist in so einem Zusammenhang einfach nur ein Wort, welches das Erscheinungsbild eines Menschen beschreibt, nicht mehr und nicht weniger. Ich bin mir darüber bewusst, dass es in der Kolonialzeit in einem anderen Zusammenhang benutzt wurde, Sklaverei, Rassenlehre, etc. Da aber heutzutage niemand der gescheit denken kann von so etwas überzeugt ist, halte ich solche Konnotationen für schlichtweg überholt. Hätte man früher ""Schwarzer"" gesagt, was man zu einem gewissen Ausmaß sicher auch gemacht hat (nehme ich einfach mal an, korrigiert mich wenn ich falsch bin), würde manch einer das Wort heutzutage auch für überholt halten

Allgemein denke ich, bei der ""Einführung"" des Wortes ""Neger"" hat man  wahrscheinlich einfach nur die Hautfarbe beschreiben wollen, der Zusammenhang sei jetzt mal außen vor gelassen. Ob man aber tatsächlich mit einem Wort, was übersetzt einfach nur ""schwarz"" heißt, wirklich was böses wollte (Vorsicht: ich meine nur das Wort an sich, nicht falsch verstehen bitte.) halte ich für unwahrscheinlich. ""Neger"" wurde einfach nur im Kontext der Rassenideologien usw. benutzt und deshalb hat es eben diese ""bösen"" Konnotationen. Ich meine aber nicht, dass man dieses Wort dafür bestrafen sollte, weil vor 200-300 Jahren die Wissenschaftler sich irgendeinen Mist aus den Fingern gezogen haben. 

Soviel schonmal dazu. 

Btw. du hast was über ""Komplette Gleichheit"" geschrieben. Nein, ich vertrete nicht die komplette Gleichheit. 
Was ich befürworte, ist eine Gleichbehandlung vor dem Gesetz, und dass alle Menschen eben Menschen sind, Menschenwürde etc.
Bei ""kompletter Gleichheit"" schwingt meiner Meinung nach etwas Marxismus mit, und davon halte ich absolut nichts. Vielleicht kannst du ja noch etwas genauer ausführen was du damit meinst, oder vielleicht auch nur den ""Genderwahn"", dazu hab ich ja schon meinen Senf gegeben.

The effectiveness of corporal punishment is an illusion:

From a meta-analysis (summarizing 88 studies with a total of 36,309 participants):

&gt;Parental corporal punishment was associated with all child constructs, including higher levels of immediate compliance and aggression and lower levels of moral internalization and mental health.
http://www.comm.umn.edu/~akoerner/courses/4471-F12/Readings/Gershoff%20(2002).pdf

In other words: Hitting children stops them from doing what they were doing for a short time. This short term compliance is bought with making children more aggressive, reducing their moral insight in the matter, and damaging their minds. The study goes on to list studies that show that the parent—child relationship is damaged as well.

&gt; I see kids today completely out of control. They don't see a stern talking to as a punishment.

Well, hitting them would make it worse (see the meta-analysis linked above). One of the most central human ways of learning is social learning. If you learn that violence is an adequate way of dealing with conflicts, lo and behold, you'll use it too. 

Also, if given a perspective most youths are more complaint and career oriented than any other generation before them. In fact, the apolitical, conforming, overly well adjusted youth is a constant talking point in Germany. No month goes by without the next opinion piece lamenting the unfortunate lack of political vigor and activism in today's students, for example.

However, if some societies (e.g., Spain, Greece) fail to solve the problem of youth unemployment, it is no wonder that young people without perspectives sometimes turn to crime. 

Another problem is structural discrimination. If you have to fear that your skin color or your family name is enough for employers to throw your application away, it is hard to stay motivated. Several sociological / psychological experiments support this practice. Researchers, for example, sent the same application to a variety of companies. The only difference was that one random half of these applications featured a foreign name and the other a local name. The effects were clear. Similar studies were conducted for gender and social background (by varying the address to a rich or poor part of the city, or by varying the name) with similar results. 

Two example studies:

It *is*, because it's not ""voccat voss"". V is [v] before long, and [f] before short vowels in German, and those 'o's are long because, well, the consonant after them is not doubled in writing.

&gt; I'd rather not use a fictitious one based on rules that the native speakers don't abide by. The same goes for Latin. 

Latin *has* no native speakers. If the Romans (as in people living in Rome) were still speaking Latin, they'd not speak it as in Caesar's times... the Italian pronunciation might thus arguably even be the preferred one.

But then, there's also a good argument to be made that Germany is the rightful successor of the Roman Empire...

You mean democracy? ;)

&gt;If you do how do you prevent it from becoming a simple dictatorship as it has every single time in the past?

You don't. Every rule by ""the people"" (or any derivation thereof) turns into an oligarchy or dictatorship eventually. Just look at the US where corporate capitalism has overtaken the country and everything from politics to laws is dictated by corporate elites. People are just complacent because they are comparatively rich and therefore don't even realize how hard they are getting fucked.

Personally I directly oppose a ""dictatorship of the proletariat"". I fundamentally oppose democracy. It's a really dumb idea.

I support scientocracy and evidence-based policy making.

&gt;If you don't then how are you going to manage a transition from capitalism to socialism?

Just look at Europe or (eventually) China.

You identify every market that fails or will eventually fail due to capitalism being too inefficient and unsustainable to manage it and you socialize it. The most easily recognizable form is government ownership: You either let the government buy up major corporation or monopolize on markets through law. Other than the military and police (which are socialized institutions in any country as far as I am aware), necessary commodities (electricity and water) and things like education and healthcare are usually socialized first in that manner. Things like welfare are also socialized in most developed nations, not doing so usually leads to disastrous results as disadvantaged people will have to rely on charity to subside.     

A more and more common form of socialization is common/collaborative ownership.

The most important part is education and awareness. To make societal progress and finally move on from capitalism, people need to adapt more global, more inclusive, less nationalistic, less egocentric mindsets. You can actually see that amongst younger generations in Europe. They don't really care about owning things anymore, they care more about having access to things. Young people don't care about owning a car anymore. They care more about having access to transport. Sharing things with others usually makes things a lot more efficient. You don't need a car 24/7, you need it to get to and from work and during that time it can be used by someone else. That's why things like Car2Go are becoming more and more popular every day. 

""Me, me, me!"" must turn to ""We, we, we!"". This is a slow process because to many people sharing things with others means having less of something. Which is obviously wrong.


Seriously, though: Do you even know what socialism and communism are beyond what you told me here? I mean, what *actual* socialism and communism are (i.e. not the sort of politics that people like Stalin supported)?

Due to the multitude of reporting methods, the table contains both the operating costs and total final costs (which include various infrastructure upgrades and security costs), known and not estimated. Net loss or gain are measured against the operating budgets. Intangible costs (such as to the environment and [society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_cost)) and not so total benefits (through tourism) are not included here.

Russia already faces international condemnation, Russian ""adventures"" has already cost our economy dozens of billions of $, bill grows each day and will continue to do so (including reputation damage). What i advocated was **not** : ""hey guys, lets forgive Russia, lol, they are nice guys "", but desire to not make things even worse than they already are. And i see plenty of ""calls to arms"" here and in media to ""make a stance against Russia"", i think its a dangerous and unpredictable path, one from which its hard to move away from, since its usually followed by propaganda which changes core views of public opinion on the issues, making politicians unable to maneuvre.

On the other hand [Russia constantly antagonizes the US and its allies](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zuYQQjbk2yqY.keUJQxu7jKGY). Those are only between March and October. Russia flies nuclear capable bombers off the coast of the US, it circles Guam with them, it routinely violates the airspace of European nations including violating Finnish airspace 3 times in one week in August, it routinely flies off the coast of Alaska with military equipment, it routinely violates Japanese and South Korean airspace. 

Despite the Russian claims that the US was behind the ""coup"" in Ukraine, Nuland's call shows that she was trying to get the UN there as a mediator. Reinforcing NATO allies is not war mongering, especially given Russia's actions. 

EDIT: forgot to add a very provocative move.

Im Grunde gibt es drei Gruppen, welche Landwirtschaft betreiben (wobei die Übergänge fließend sein können):

Gruppe 1: traditionelle Subsistenzwirtschaften - Diese Gruppe trägt kaum bis gar nicht zur Versorgung der lokalen Märkte bei, daher spielt sie, obwohl gerade in Entwicklungsländern zahlenmäßig groß, in einer Wirksamkeitsbetrachtung von Agrarimporten auch keine Rolle.

Gruppe 2: marktorientierte, lokale Erzeuger - Bei dieser Gruppe handelt es sich um bäuerliche Familienbetriebe oder Personengesellschaften, welche je nach den Erfordernissen für den lokalen oder ausländischen Markt produzieren. Auf eben diese bezieht sich meine Aussage. Wobei der überregionale Marktzugang für diese Gruppe regelmäßig von der ihr zur Verfügung stehenden Infrastruktur abhängt.

Gruppe 3: ""ausländische Investoren"" - Diese Gruppe besteht aus Kapitalgeselschaften, welche uim großen Umfang Land aufkaufen und dieses bewirtschaften bzw. bewirtschaften lassen. Das Ziel ist in der Regel eine hohe Rendite der Anleger zu erwirtschaften. Daher produzieren derartige Unternehmen auch nur für den Weltmarkt und nicht für regionale oder lokale Märkte.

Du zielst nun vermutlich auf die Konflikte zwischen den Gruppen 1 und 3 ab bspw. das Land Grabbing bzw. die Zwangsvertreibung oder -umsiedlung der angestammten Bevölkerung. Diese Vorgänge bringen eine Reihe von Problemen mit sich, die regionalen Märkte beeinflussen sie jedoch nur marginal (u.U. steigt durch die Vertreibung die Nachfrage nach Nahrungsmitteln, wenn den ""Gruppe 1 Bauern"" die Möglichkeit zur Selbstversorgung genommen wird).

false,Pwndbyautocorrect,EURO,European Union,"What you describe are reactions (some of which I do not support) against a significant influx of those refugees, which even smaller municipalities have had to deal with recently, putting a lot of strain on the local administration and community. The problems with those refugees are (in my view) as follows:

* the vast majority are unskilled (guaranteeing they'll end up unemployed, especially considering the current economic situation)

* they do not speak the local language, which hinders their integration and job prospects

* they will most likely form separate, isolated communities (pretty much a ghetto situation) or join an existing one, making them even less likely to learn the language/integrate

* most people, hearing these points, would want them to go back to Syria after the civil war is over, but I'm not sure they would willingly do so

* bringing in young, unskilled, culturally and religiously distinct people that come here because they are fleeing death and destruction, not necessarily because they wanted to heightens social and ethnic tensions (and that is both **normal** and **foreseeable**)

Now, getting to your comments on East Germans' reactions to these refugees:

&gt; Just take a look what is happening around germany recently, especially the **eastern part**

Which pretty much confirms that an influx of refugees in already poor(er) regions of Europe leads to nothing but more wage competition, unemployment and social tensions. Instead of denouncing these events as racist (no, that doesn't help) and linking them to extreme ideologies, we should take a look at what caused them. The fact that thousands of people participated in protests against these migrants only shows how widespread that social tension has become in affected regions.

&gt; The european Borders are sealed off militarily, it's getting harder and more expensive to get there

As it should be. Immigration policies in many Western European countries have not been given enough thought, which is why we now have debates on them, the amoung of immigrants a society may tolerate and the role of Islam in our societies. Ideally, and provided we make integration a priority of our immigration policy, we would impose limits according to the economic and social realities.

That being said, it's important to distinguish economic migrants from asylum seekers, the former intending to stay long-term for economic reasons and fearing no direct threat to their lives and the latter fleeing from war, starvation and so on.

false,ohthehorrors,ASTR,Österreich,"Den unter dem Begriff ""Politische Korrektheit"" summierten Positionen ist gemein, dass sie von der Allgemeinheit nicht ernst genommen werden. Unter dem Label ""Politische Korrektheit"" werden vor allem Dinge thematisiert, die man bestenfalls als Pseudoprobleme ansehen kann. Die Vertreter der Politischen Korrektheit erwecken mitunter den Eindruck, dass ihnen etwas der Bezug zur Realität fehlt. ""Politische Korrektheit"" richtet sich nicht gegen faktisch feststellbare Probleme wie Verarmungstendenzen, Umweltzerstörung oder steigendern Ressourcenverbrauch. Als Vertreter der Politischen Korrektheit treten vor allem Bedienstete universitärer Einrichtungen im Sozial- und Geisteswissenschaftlichen Bereich oder Künstler in Erscheinung - prinzipiell nicht die Gruppe, der man den höchsten Realitätsbezug zuschreibt. Aufrund dieser Unterstützergruppe scheint die ""politische Korrektheit"" sehr von postmodernen und konstruktivistischen Positionen geprägt zu sein.

""Politische Korrektheit"" wirkt häufig wie ein konstruktivistisches Sprachspiel. Typisch für diese Positionen ist die These, dass sämtliche sozialen und Strukturen flexibel und durch sprachliche Ordnungen konstruiert wären. Dementsprechend müsste nur die Sprache geändert werden, um die Realität zu ändern. Postmoderne Positionen scheinen die Position der politischen Korrektheit in Bezug auf die Immigration zu prägen. Mit ""politischer Korrektheit"" wird häufig dafür argumentiert, dass Unterscheidungen zwischen Eingeborenen und Migranten künstlich erschaffen seien, wesshalb eine Ungleichbehandlung von Zuwanderern wie zum Beispiel Zuwanderungsbeschränkungen Diskriminierung wär.

Die Vertreter der politischen Korrektheit agieren in der Öffentlichkeit in einer Weise, die nicht geeignet ist, irgendein Verständniss für ihre Positionen zu erwecken. Ein Beispiel dafür wären die Debatten um Kinderbettelei, bei der sich der Beitrag der politisch Korrekten auf die Forderung beschränkt, nicht zu sagen, dass die Kinderbettelei ein Problem einer bestimmten Gruppe ist. Ein anderes Beispiel wäre das Ausblenden der Probleme der Immigration. 

Den Vertretern der Politischen Korrektheit ist es gelungen, sich im linken politischen Spektrum zu installieren. Dies wird zum Problem, da die Forderungen der politischen Korrektheit eigentlich nichts mit klassischen linken Positionen zu tun haben und diese in den Hintergrund drängen. Bei den Grünen geht es z.B. immer weniger um Umweltschutz und besseren öffentlichen Verkehr, aktuell gibt es bei dieser Partei sogar eine Parteivorsitzende, die sich den Konservativen anbiedert, Umweltthemen ignoriert und gegen den Ausbau des Bahnnetzes polemisiert. An den Vertretern der politischen Korrektheit fällt auf, dass diese eigentlich mit linken Positionen wenig gemeinsam haben. Sie zählen zumeist eher zum vermögenderen Teil der Gesellschaft und sind häufig in gut bezahlten Stellen im Universitäts- oder Kunstbereich tätig. Diese Leute haben keinen Bezug zu den Problemen, die sich für einen größer werdenden Teil der Gesellschaft stellen, Armut oder begrenzte Möglichkeiten sind ihnen fremd. In Wirklichkeit handelt es sich bei diesen Leuten um Wertkonservative, die in der ""politischen Korrektheit"" samt ihrer schrillen, selbstgerechten und moralisierenden Forderungen einen Sinn, das Gefühl für etwas Richtiges einzutreten in ihre Existenz holen - die Abstraktheit der politisch korrekten Forderungen schützt ihre Vertreter davor, am Ende sich selbst als Teil eines Problems zu erkennen.

Russia essentially agreed to much deeper military ties with the break away region of Abkhazia (Georgia). It vowed to remove its troops in the cease fire it agreed to years ago but has not done so. It also will not allow unarmed military or human rights observers into the region. 

Russia essentially moved its military border into Georgia and will now control customs for the break away region. Luckily for Russia, due to its actions in Ukraine, most people missed this. Even though its two weeks old, maybe its worth its own post.

I don't know a single person who does that. Never have I heard *anyone* doing that. It's ridiculous.

Those ""communist"" states have nothing to do with communism or socialism, so why would they even be of any concern to a discussion about socialism or communism?

I don't need to whitewash the crimes of Nazi Germany, America or North Korea when talking about the benefits and drawbacks of democracy, either.

&gt;They are also ignorant and dismissive of modern economic theories backed with data and research. 

Actually, a bigger problem exists in the exact other way around. Data and research and all evidence suggest that capitalism is a terrible idea. We not only know it on paper, we can see it happen everywhere. It leads to disaster everywhere. Every place on this planet is fucked in one way or another and in many cases it's because of capitalism/right-wing politics. People suffer. It leads to market failure in any sufficiently developed society and the further society develops (especially in terms of automation), the more socialism becomes not only an alternative but an economic necessity.

Not to mention that more socialist countries are generally happier and *a lot* more sustainable. As you can see in Europe and Scandinavia.

In the meantime, countless of people (e.g. you) completely ignore any and all data and research and oppose things for a lack of better understanding. People are blind and indoctrinated.

&gt;Marx was the pinnacle of leftist thought, everything went downhill after him.

Leftist thought is constantly making progress and the more leftist countries are, the better they usually tend to be. Just look at Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, or this country right here, Austria. Things are better when organized by and for the many. In fact, just look at China. Especially in a few years. In 2 decades or so they will pretty much surpass every other nation on this planet.

That's an accusation against the US and in NO WAY does justify invading and annexing parts of ukraine.

&gt; As for dictatorship, i believe mr.Yanukovych as corrupt of a piece of shit as he was, was a democratically elected leader

On the basis of lies and deceit and hiding his corruption while pretending to save the country he in fact was carefully running into the ground and methodically destroying, on moscovite orders, in exchange for vasts amounts of russian money. That's called ""high treason"" for you.

&gt; I am not going to pretend that ""general West"" had no role in Euromaidan, since i see a clear conflict of interest in what West says and what it did. 

We absolutely didn't start it. We supported them pressure him once it became clear how much of an asshole Y' was. Then he decided to ran away, fair enough.

&gt; You were interested in a specific outcome, initially you lost to a Russian diplomatic approach of ""providing aid in terms of gas discounts and cash""

That's what Y' was saying. Reality was ""we lost because we didn't offered 10 billion USD to Yanoukovich personally, unlike putin"". But maybe we should start bribing off warlord too against russia everytime that russia try to court them if that's totally ok ?

&gt; Russia can turn Ukraine into Hell on Earth and make your ""hegemon lives"" 

Yes russia can massacre or torture and destroy the life of millions or even billions of people. How impressive. But let me put it bluntly : You . will. never. survive. that . one. Ever.

&gt;  I believe you had ""pivot"" to take care of on the Pacific theater, can you really afford to reallocate significant amount of resources to counter an extremely hostile Russia unwilling to play by any rules with a goal of hurting or crippling you as much as possible?

It's not the US that will pour all those ressources against russia if it comes to open war : It's the EU. You know, the third or second economic power in the world.

&gt; and Russian diplomacy had no chance of success.

""since russia couldn't force Ukraine to keep Y' in power and him taking bribes in"", we'll kill them all and annexe the country by sending in the wermarcht"".

&gt; **Russia did very little until Ukraine wanted to become a** NATO/**European Union member**

So you admit you are massacring Ukrainians because you decided that they had no sovereign right to join EU instead of getting force annexed by the Soviet Reunion one way or another (""silver or lead"" anyone ?). How nice of you . Another red army invading the EU. How about the EU and western powers goes back to exterminating russian forces then ? Y'know, It goes both way, and we too have in fact lots of weapon and can kill a lot more russian that you can kill european citizens.

I'd agree but this perpetual state of affairs has been going on for decades and it's a steady trend downwards. It has something to do with this basic mindset many of us share. A little bit of this, little bit of that, that small time thievery here and you end up with a gigantic deficit and corner cutting with no end from your local bar, over big corporation, to the government itself. A crushing majority takes this sort of approach as granted.

&gt;And apparently all the whining isn't the right answer to these issues considering what we brought upon ourselves... I doubt the Germans whined their way up to top of Europe...

Funny that you say that, I've cracked myself up so many times watching Germans absolutely lose their shit over a small delay of the train. I was just sitting there, used to our services and was just glad it came along eventually. Here it's the norm that it's either late, or doesn't even show up without replacement, not to mention the desolate state of the infrastructure itself.

Let me just send you back and forth between offices and call-centers until you receive a fine and then you get to pay the fine AND BOTH BILLS! Fantastic, ain't it?

That's what our country is in a nutshell.

The main difference between Italy and Germany is that there people bitch but eventually take matters in their own hands and take PERSONAL pride in fixing the country as a whole, meanwhile Italians see it as train crash with no hope and a ""free-for-all"" mentality. ""Oh, no one will mind if I help myself to a rightfully earned bonus"". We criticise and point at others, instead of fixing our own faults, they criticise and fix shit for the better future of all.

false,cokkish,ITAL,Italy,"&gt; V is [v] before long, and [f] before short vowels in German, and those 'o's are long because, well, the consonant after them is not doubled in writing.

I'm no expert in Standard German phonology but as far as I know 'v' is always pronounced [f] no matter how long the following vowel is unless the word is a romance loanword. As we can see from native words such as 'vater' [faː tɐ] or 'viel' [fiːl]. Am I right? You're the native speaker after all.

I see only now that you're from Low German/Danish lands and I hear pretty much everything is fair game over there. But that wouldn't make it into Standard German all the same.

&gt; Latin has no native speakers. If the Romans (as in people living in Rome) were still speaking Latin, they'd not speak it as in Caesar's times

But you're speaking the language of ancient Romans  every time you speak Latin no matter how you put it, because language has both space and time. Saying that the native Classical Latin speakers died doesn't change how those letters where meant to be spoken. A thousand years from now even if all the modern German speaking community will be dead your 2000's language will have to be pronounced the way you do now no matter which wicked sounds they may come up with. 

Also people in Rome are still speaking Latin nowadays but it's got a different name and it's evolved (it's called *Romanesco*). 

You wouldn't read Old English or Old High German texts with the same pronunciation of Modern English and Standard German respectively so why would you with Latin as though it was Italian?

&gt; [...] the reconstructed classical one as it's a reconstruction and thus not 100% certain.

That is scientifically based though. You don't need to meet a living dinosaur to know that they existed since they left plenty of evidence behind, just like Latin did.

&gt; But then, there's also a good argument to be made that Germany is the rightful successor of the Roman Empire...

true, there needs to be more help from the federal government.

&gt; more wage competition

there is no wage competition between eastern germans and refugees. refugees are not allowed to work (for some months). even after that uncertain amount of time, theres something called ""Vorzugsbehandlung"", which basically means if theres a german who can and wants to do the job, he/she's gonna get it first. 
Eastern germany is also not exactly poor. All of germany, west and east, is rich enough to support Refugees in times of civil war. 

The problems you mention are, in my view, a consequence of the possibilities the people are offered. There are very few. Some of them are lucky to get a language course, that's about it. Being crowded together with a lot of people (some of which are traumatised and not treated) and not being able to work, visit family/friends in another region (because it's forbidden) and so on is not a very good start to ""integrate"" in whatever construction of a german society one would like to think of.

the argument that the majority of refugees are unskilled is just not true, but sadly a very popular one.

&gt; Instead of denouncing these events as racist

i'm not denouncing them as racist, i'm calling them racist for what they are. I've read enough proclamations by these so called ""defenders of the occident"" and heard enough interviews to see that their arguments are, infact, racist. 

&gt; As it should be.

There's no alternative? One that prevents thousands from dying in the Mediterranean? A humane way of treating people which have decided to leave their family, friends, houses work and so on for a very good reason?

That said, Russia is huge. The Baltics cant be expected to fight them alone. They physically cant have a similar military to the US or Russia. The US spends 26 times Estonia's entire GDP on defense. Russia spends 3.6 times Estonia's entire GDP on its military. US expenditure is coming down but it goes to show how outgunned the Baltics are compared to their neighbor and the gulf between what they can spend compared to what major powers can spend.

If the rebels were satisfied with their current territory, they would not have been attacking UA positions so aggressively for the past few months.

Putin needs more than Crimea, he needs a continuous struggle to shore up his support at home.  If the situation stabilizes people will start paying attention to domestic problems, if he makes a deal with the ""fascist Nazis"" in Kiev and Washington (because the EU is actually just the US's puppet after all) people may start to question this entire ""righteous struggle"" narrative Putin has been pushing.

Consider this Reuters article about Putin's meeting with Merkel after the G20 summit:

&gt;For nearly four hours, Merkel -- joined around midnight by new European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker -- tried to get the former KGB agent, a fluent German speaker, to let down his guard and clearly state his intentions.

Of course, we don't know the actual conversation they had, and we can't take these comments completely at face value because the sources didn't want to be named, but this is consistent with the actions of rhetoric of Merkel after their meeting, and with information we've seen about the results of previous attempts of Merkel to negotiate with Putin.  He's had numerous opportunities to try to normalize this crisis: the aftermath of the Crimea referendum when the situation was relatively peaceful, the downing of MH17, the Minsk agreement, the G20, and he hasn't taken them.

Under such circumstances, i came to a conclusion that Russia eventually would be thrown out out of Crimea with an almost 100% certainty, weakening Russian capability to project force of protect its interest in the region.

The need of force projection implies ill will in the region. I thought Russia saw Ukraine as a ""brother"" nation. Why would Russia need military power if it has more than enough soft power through media, movies and fucking family ties.

&gt; Ukraine during Euromaidan and after overthrowing Yanukovych was vocally anti-Russian and their very first steps were quite russophobic or Russia hating in my opinion, even before Crimea/South East business. To pretend that Russia oriented forces had any chances in Rada or Presidential elections, is naive in my opinion, Russia has ""lost"" Ukraine for at least 1 electoral cycle in terms of capability of influencing internal Ukrainian processes (making Western orientation even more cemented in public opinion mind).

Do you really think that Ukrainians will forget Russian intervention in 4 years? Seriosly?

&gt; American warship serves no purpose other than ""we are with you guys, we support you"", its not going to participate in ATO or in fight against Russian backed separatists. Its posturing/dick waving in its finest forms, not a threat to Russia.

The US warship doesn't threaten the Russian territorial integrity for sure, but it didn't make the security better from Russian point of view. It is dick waving in its purest form.

&gt; Sanctions are consequences of Russian actions, they have nothing to do with security.
&gt; There was in no way enough popular support for Nato in Ukraine. Both you and I know that.
&gt; **Russia has examples of Eastern Europe/Baltics/""Central European"" nations to see what is to be expected. I believe all of them joined NATO and Ukrainian membership was on the table as early as 2008 and was later put on hold after Georgian war. Public opinion can be swayed, evidences or ""need"" engineered, population brainwashed and so on and so forth, stop pretending that the ""end game"" would be any different, than the one i described (if they are unwilling and thats a big if when we are talking about Ukraine in Euromaidan hysteria mode media).**

Well, that's most definitely false. I don't think there is any room for interpretation here, either: It's socialism and that's exactly what people who talk about socialism mean.

&gt;If you approve of it you're not a socialist

Well, of course *I* am not a socialist, I'm a scientocrat. 

I don't approve of the dumb masses controlling anything. Neither under democracy nor communism except there is undeniably scientific evidence of them being able to manage things sustainably (of which there is non... whille lots of evidence to the contrary existing). However, I understand that socialist approaches are extremely important and progressive and need to be implemented instead of capitalist ones (while capitalism needs to be abandoned). I'm not defending socialism in this conversation because I'm a fan of socialism (I would like to progress beyond any rigid system of socioeconomic management), I'm defending socialism because it doesn't deserve the criticism you pose against it.


&gt;you're a social democrat, which I have nothing against

Yes. You have nothing against socialism. You have something against the things that you falsely believe to be socialism (e.g. Fascism, Stalinism, Maoism, whatever you hate).

I mean, seriously, you really are blinded by your personal ideologies here. 

What ***you*** talk about is *not* socialism. The same way what North Korea calls democracy isn't democracy.

""Socialism is a social and economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system.""     
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism

""[...] socialization is the process of structuring or restructuring the economy on a socialist basis, usually by establishing a system of production for use in place of organizing production for private profit along with the end of the operation of the laws of capitalism. In its most developed form, the concept of socialization entails the end of money and financial valuation and calculation in the production process. [...] More broadly, socialization is social ownership, encompassing all the various models of resource and enterprise ownership proposed for socialist economies. Usually it refers to various types of employee-ownership, cooperatives or public ownership; but in some instances it refers to a form distinct from employee-owned cooperatives, public ownership and private ownership. ""    
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization_(economics)

That's what socialism is. And what you see in Scandinavia is socialism. What you see in Austria and Germany is socialism. That's what socialism is. 

The people you rightfully hate, like Stalin, had nothing to with socialism. They called themselves communist and socialist because people would support them if they called themselves that. Why? Because communism and socialism are great things that are a lot better than capitalism. Of course you give your support to a person that claims to fight for those awesome things. Well, turns out they lied. They didn't really care about the underlying economic theory very much and cared a lot more about getting power by first gaining support by the people and then delude them.


&gt;Classic Marxism relies on labor theory of value which is a fringe theory in modern economics, on par with laissez faire economics.

No, it's not a fringe theory at all. In fact, in recent years it has become more and more important in *all* countries, including extremely anti-capitalistic nations like the US. 

At this point, if you are an economist and don't understand that necoclassical economics have no place in a globalized beyond a certain point, you are either old and have lost touch or are not actually educated in economics.

Sure, capitalism *can* be great. In fact, it's necessary, as every communist economist recognizes. But not forever. It's just a stage in societal development, like feudalism. It's not the end of development, it's just one of the transient stages in an ongoing process. Which is why it's so incredibly bad that people and countries want to stick to it. We already made progress beyond that. In the developed world we are on our way to socialism already and people clinging to capitalism for ideological reasons are very destructive.

So, yes, capitalism was once useful and good (the same way religion has once been very useful and effective at organizing societies): In a non-globalized world with a low amount of people living in it being part of the game it made sense to use economic growth in terms of GDP as an indicator for national development as it related directly to the well-being of the people affected. That stopped being the case a long time ago and it becomes less true faster and faster. Capitalist economics relies on abundance of opportunity and unlimited growth. It requires that everyone has a fair access to resources and the power to make it on his/her own. Which stopped being the case generations ago and completely stopped being the case in the information age. Citing economists from a few decades ago is already out of touch with current economic needs and analysis.

In the world we live in, real economic efficiency means including *all* resources that affect human well-being in the allocation system, not just marketed goods and services. And on a globalized environment that also means in the long term and on an international scale. Our current market allocation method excludes all non-marketed natural and social capital assets and services that are crucial to human well-being.

Capitalism is not suited to deal with a developed, globalized society and is not capable to efficiently manage capital in a world without abundant opportunity. It can't be used to increase or even maintain socioeconomic equality and, in fact, makes things progressively worse.      

Some sort of central planning can deal with that. It is at least necessary to deal with the inefficiencies caused by capitalism. And it is, in fact, necessary and becomes more and more necessary over time while capitalism becomes more and more unsustainable to the point of destructivity.

&gt;If labor theory of value is wrong then the assertion that wage labor is slavery is wrong as well.

That doesn't follow at all.

Even if the labour theory of value is wrong, the assertion that wage labour is slavery still wouldn't be wrong. Wage labour *can be* ""slavery"".         
In a developed society there should be no place for [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery), yet countries like the US show us that there is.  ",0,1417979323,null,0,1417979650,0,cmnzkfa,t3_2oizs8,t1_cmnzkfa,t1_cmnyiid,null,1425556050,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

Tolle Wochen hattet Ihr alle, hab bis jetzt alles gelesen und freue mich für euch :)

Ich hatte meine letzte Arbeitswoche und feiere nun meinen Resturlaub bis zum Jahresende ab. Im Januar geht's dann zur neuen Firma, mit denen ich gestern schon Weihnachten feiern durfte. Ich war also auf der Weihnachtsfeier eingeladen, obwohl ich da eigentlich nur die Chefs bisher kanne. Treffpunkt: 17 Uhr Weihnachtmarkt. Ich bin extra um 17.10 gekommen und war trotzdem der Erste :P

Naja, alles nicht so schlimm und mein Eindruck, demnächst mit vielen jungen Leuten (die allermeisten also in meinem Alter um die 30), mit denen ich auf einer Wellenlänge liege, zusammenzuarbeiten hat sich bestätigt. Habe auch brav den ganzen Abend nur Bier getrunken und konnte die meisten Schnäpse und Cocktails, die mir angeboten wurden, ausschlagen. Ich wollte nicht riskieren, mir da direkt die Blöße zu geben und bin sogar ein bisschen stolz auf mich, dass ich mir diverse blöde Sprüche verkneifen konnte :D

Um 5 heute morgen ging's dann heim (und ich war nicht der letzte...ich konnte und wollte einfach nicht mehr :P ). Der Abend war also ein Erfolg und ich konnte mir beweisen, dass ich auch noch feiern kann, denn am Vorabend war ich in DA bei meinem besten Kumpel eingeladen. Der ist 30 geworden, seine Frau ein paar Wochen vorher 29 und sie haben gerade ihre neue tolle Wohnung bezogen. Da waren wir zu zweit dann auch bis 5 Uhr, bis es zurück ins Hotel ging. Mit das beste an dem Abend: ein 40 Kilo Spanferkel :P Jammi! UND der Nikolaus kam in der Nacht noch zu Besuch...AUWEIA...ich bin aber dankenswerterweise sehr gut weggekommen...puh :D

Ich muss sagen, das war ein wirklich gutes Wochenende, ich hatte zwei tolle Abende und JETZT langsam komme ich wieder klar im Kopf, nachdem ich eigentlich den ganzen Sonntag im Bett verbracht habe. Es ging einfach nicht anders :P

I agree with your analysis but we're far from being poor. That's the only point I'm trying to make.

Appeasement, also known as negotiation, is a pretty standard way of working out international conflicts, especially when the governments in question are powerful enough to actually make steamrolling them difficult.

The reality is that unless we are willing to risk a full scale war with Russia, in the end a negotiated balance of power is going to have to be discovered.  It's going to go a lot better if we haven't firebombed a few of each other's cities first.  We're not yet irreversibly past the days of quite a bit of good will between our respective people.  If we want to entrench Putin what we need to do is demonstrate that we have ambitions in the Russian sphere of influence and that we're willing to treat Russia as a 3rd world country in order to get our way.

Yes this means that the sovereignty and total independence of Russia's neighbours will be strained.  But that's how things have always been when large powers act like children and can't find a way to live and let live.  Ask Cuba, Mexico or Vietnam how complete and total independent control of their borders, laws and populations are working out for them. You'll see that big players unfortunately sacrifice their ""friends"" all the time in the interest of internal policy or international relations.

The best thing we can do for Ukraine in my personal opinion is develop a strong and binding agreement that protects the status quo and allows Russia enough influence to prevent it from feeling the political need or opportunity to take anything more.

We can't even agree now on how to pronounce it in current times! And I can assure you that people read Goethe and whatnot and not give a shit about how exactly *he* pronounced it.

Do Anglophones use the reconstructed Shakespearean pronunciation when quoting him? Generally, not.

Of course, there's people that have interest in such things. Let them have that interest. Let them reconstruct. 

But there's also a *living* part of Latin. The German pronunciation wasn't made up, it developed out of the practice of people using Latin, generally in scientific fields. Who are the Old Romans to tell us how to use that language?

My understanding, from skimming Wikipedia's coverage of the [present German constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law_for_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany) and [discussion of the present German guarantees of freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Censorship_in_Germany#Incorrect_and_biased_claim:_.22Membership_in_a_Nazi_party_.5B....5D_illegal.22) is that the difference lies in that Germany lies somewhere between Ukraine and the United States.

The United States has a constitution that (a) does not ban any political parties or ideologies, and (b) does not permit for laws to be passed doing so.

Germany has a constitution that (a) does not ban any political parties or ideologies, but (b) *does* [permit for the Federal Constitutional Court to ban parties that oppose the constitutional order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Censorship_in_Germany#Incorrect_and_biased_claim:_.22Membership_in_a_Nazi_party_.5B....5D_illegal.22):

&gt; I think it is important to edit the claim made in the article that ""Membership in a Nazi party [...] [is] illegal in Germany"" as this is both an incorrect statement and implies a certain bias. The freedom of association guaranteed by the German constitution can be revoked for associations by the state under certian conditions and in the past this has effected various political associations, not only those of Nazis. According to Article 9 Grundgesetz (German Constitution), ""All Germans shall have the right to form corporations and other associations"". But this is no absolute right, as the second paragraph of the same article states: ""Associations whose aims or activities contravene the criminal laws, or that are directed against the constitutional order or the concept of international understanding, shall be prohibited"" (see German original wording of the current Grundgesetz article 9 at http://dejure.org/gesetze/GG/9.html and its English translation provided by the Comparative Law Society based on the Grundgesetz from December 20th 1993 (there have been no changes to article 9 and 21 since) at http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/GG.htm#9 ). Furthermore, according to Article 21 Grundgesetz political parties are a privileged form of association in Germany and unlike other organisations they can not be banned by the administration but only by the Federal Constitutional Court (see http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/GG.htm#21 and http://dejure.org/gesetze/GG/21.html ). In the past, these laws have been enforced against political associations and parties of various convictions, including the NSDAP followup Nazi-party Socialist Reich Party SRP 1952 and the German Communist Party KPD in 1956. Only the continued membership in an organization that has been banned for the above reasons is illegal in Germany and this has been put to affect against various political persuasions, including Communists, Nazis and Islamists but also against economic associations used for criminal activities. The question whether the German state has a positive right to ban religious or philosophical associations is a matter of debate and to date no such bans have been put into effect (see Veelken, Sebastian. ""Das Verbot von Weltanschauungs- und Religionsgemeinschaften"", Diss. Münster 1999 (german-language Dissertation about the question of banning philosophical and religious associations). The current articles wording makes it seem as though only Nazis were effected by laws restricting the freedom of association in Germany...

Finally, there is Ukraine's situation, where based upon the article, it appears that the current party is establishing constitutional prohibitions specifically against communism, so that there is a high bar against changing this.

The US approach provided a core of necessary functionality that would be present (barring a enough support being gained to amend the constitution, but at that point, both the German and Ukrainian approach would also fail) to permit democratic mechanisms to function.

Yes, I'd prefer the US approach to the German or Ukranian, but would also point out that even the German and Ukranian approaches differ.",0,1417979812,null,0,false,0,cmnzuev,t3_2oizs8,t1_cmnzuev,t1_cmnr03f,null,1425555922,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Ich erlebe es gelegentlich, dass Witze über Juden und das dritte Reich gemacht werden, finde diese aber geschmacklos, da damals wirklich Gräueltaten begangen wurden. Darüber Witze zu machen finde ich deshalb falsch und dies sage ich dann auch.

Meine persönliche Erfahrung ist, dass politische Korrektheit vor allem für öffentliche und Vorbild-Funktionen (Politiker, Lehrer, bei Ansprachen) relevant ist, aber nicht immer im privaten Bereich. Politisch unkorrekte Witze gibt es viele in Deutschland. Vor allem Erwachsene mit entsprechender Gesinnung und Jugendliche erzählen diese gelegentlich, allerdings nicht ausschließlich. Im öffentlichen Raum ist politische Korrektheit sehr wichtig. Aufgrund der hohen Sensibilisierung für das Thema Rassismus/Faschismus und Intoleranz wird jemand, der sich unvorsichtig über Juden, Schwarze oder Menschen mit Behinderung äussert, schnell dafür kritisiert. 

In den öffentlichen Medien wird Politische Unkorrektheit gerne genutzt, um Aufmerksamkeit zu erheischen. Die Bild (rainbow paper) tut sich hier gerne ganz besonders hervor. Vor allem werden hier gerne Zitate aus dem Kontext gerissen und je nach Bedarf interpretiert.

false,Arel_Mor,null,null,"Le terme de néolibéralisme désigne aujourd'hui un ensemble multidimensionnel de prises de position d'inspiration libérale – ou prétendues telles – qui partagent un socle d'idées communes :

* Dénonciation du développement excessif de l'État-providence dans les pays développés après 1945 et de l'accroissement des interventions publiques dans l'économie
* Promotion de l'économie de marché au nom de la liberté de l'individu et de l'efficacité économique
* Promotion de la dérégulation des marchés (qui doivent se « réguler eux-mêmes » par le jeu de la concurrence et des « lois du marché »), promotion de la privatisation et des baisses d’impôts sur les plus riches qui ""créent de la richesse""
* Promotion de la flexibilisation du marché du travail

A la différence du libéralisme classique, le néo-libéralisme est caractérisé par une extrême hypocrisie et l'importance du rôle de l'Etat. C'est a dire : Moins d'Etat pour les pauvres, mais plus d'Etat pour les riches. Etat qui sauve les banques. Etat qui distribue des aides aux entreprises. Etat qui donne des contrats militaires aux grandes entreprises militaires. Etat qui privatise les services publics mais est obligé de garder la partie non rentable. Etat qui doit baisser les impots des plus riches et augmenter la TVA. Et ainsi de suite.

Le néolibéralisme, est promu depuis les années 1970 aux Etats Unis et au Royaume-Uni. Il est financé par des milliardaires en grande partie (Walton, Koch, Murdoch) et par toutes sortes d'instituts (Cato, Heritage, Fraser, Hoover). En France, les représentants principaux du néolibéralisme sont des gens comme l'institut Turgot, l'IFRAP, Contrepoints, et 4/5 autres ""think tank"" financés par on ne sait pas trop qui. 

**Exemple d'un néo-libéral :** Serge Dassault. Il fraude le fisc, il s'en prend violemment aux ""assistés"", il appelle a flexibiliser le marché du travail, mais, mais, il affirme que Dassault ne dépend pas des aides de l'Etat. Moins, d'Etat oui, mais pour les pauvres.

**Autre exemple d'un néo-libéral:** Steven Forbes, héritier de la famille Forbes. A la tete d'une immense fortune, il appelle régulièrement a diminuer l’impôt sur l'héritage et a couper les aides publiques aux plus pauvres mais ne remet jamais en question l'aide aux grandes entreprises

Even without that, due to their meager language skills, asylum seekers will have trouble finding a job. That forces the state to step in and pay them benefits.

&gt; The problems you mention are, in my view, a consequence of the possibilities the people are offered.

I don't like what you're implying. Can the state be held responsible for a lack of employment mostly due to changes in the macro-economic situation? Your whole argument puts the responsibility of educating asylum seekers (both in language and employable skills) and financing them for potentially long periods of time solely on the state, blaming any problems arising on the ""lack of opportunities offered to them"" instead of questioning the foreseeable effects of their presence. Do you even realise how costly that is? These people are here and there's nothing we can do about it, but that doesn't mean their presence is without its disadvantages.

&gt; i'm calling them racist for what they are

Right, so the reason people demonstrate against the presence of refugees is because of their skin colour, not because of the strain they put on local resources, their higher-than-average share of criminals, their completely different culture and so on? The fact that some of these problems have been highlighted and used by racist groups and populists does not make them non-existent.

To change those you'd have to enact a new constitution. But the Basic Law only ceases to apply if ""the German people enacts a new constitution in free decision"".

As such, if fascists were somehow to pass their own constitution the Basic Law would still be in force. Which would mean that in the next version of the Nuremberg trials there's not much to argue: All resistance against that regime was completely legal (the Basic Law includes the right to resistance) and the deeds of the fascists shall be judged by constitutional laws... thus, not those that they enacted, but the last ones that were within the scope of the Basic Law.

You can't have your cake and eat it too, if international law is not equally applied to every member of international community, Russia has no obligation to follow it either. In case of Libya if you remember France and UK were more than trigger happy, so that also makes European Union a compliance in deceit and outright lies in Russia's face (making you less trustworthy in the process). In case of redrawing borders, i am not going to buy ""this was an exception"" excuse in regards to Kosovo, *you* opened the can of worms, not Russia, don't complain when Russia stops playing by the rules and goes all hostile on your ass. 


&gt;On the basis of lies and deceit and hiding his corruption while pretending to save the country he in fact was carefully running into the ground and methodically destroying, on moscovite orders, in exchange for vasts amounts of russian money. That's called ""high treason"" for you.


Was he tried or even accused by official Kiev of treason? Somehow i haven't heard anything like that, only allegations of corruption and the like. Anyway, how is Ukraine doing nowadays anyway, did new Government reverted the trend and Ukraine is economically prosperous? Perhaps their debt levels decreased or inflation fallen, or their currency and production is doing well? So Ukraine now enjoys full support of West and its institutions, they are very much Western oriented and should ""into prosperity"" right? If You accuse someone of running a country into the ground, you should probably provide examples of improvement by the new leadership, right? Where are the great new economic initiatives, reforms, businesses, improvement of standard of life and so on? 


Ukraine hasn't done shit for itself in its 20+ years of history, only looted themselves to the ground and stolen everything that wasn't hammered, but its all Yanukovych fault i am sure, Yushenko/Tymoshenko/Kuchma had nothing to do with it. 


&gt;We absolutely didn't start it. We supported them pressure him once it became clear how much of an asshole Y' was. Then he decided to ran away, fair enough.


Maybe you didn't and it was a ""genuine"" movement, i don't have capability to neither confirm or deny any of that, maybe in 5,10,15,20 years more of ""documents"" would be declassified and we will learn more about the role of Western NGOs, USAID programs and other organizations during Euromaidan, sort a like we learned about Orange revolution and who had a hand in it. But no way could it happen again, right? Now its different! 


&gt;That's what Y' was saying. Reality was ""we lost because we didn't offered 10 billion USD to Yanoukovich personally, unlike putin"". But maybe we should start bribing off warlord too against russia everytime that russia try to court them if that's totally ok ?


If you are a European i guess you can say that, if you are United States you can't, since they bribe everyone pretty much under nice ""aid packages"" and the likes (including cold hard cash for people like Karzai etc). Russia is more like U.S in that regard, we are just as full of shit as them (which i personally don't like, but it works in Central Asia region etc, so whatever).


&gt;Yes russia can massacre or torture and destroy the life of millions or even billions of people. How impressive. But let me put it bluntly : You . will. never. survive. that . one. Ever.


I was talking more about economic devastation and complete and utter despair of population, since majority of Russian population **opposes** invasion and war in Ukraine. But given a radical transformation of society and if Russia is by chance would decide to go full retard (which is a relatively small chance), you would not survive that either.

 World will be a nuclear wasteland, everyone will have cancer, atomic stations and fuel storages will burn and so on and so forth, water would be poisoned for decades to come etc. Its something that i prefer would never happen, hence my initial suggestion to ""take a breathe"" and slow down a bit in terms of ""lets go to war with Russia, lets sanction Russia into oblivion, lets supply Ukraine with a shit ton of lethal aid"". 


&gt;It's not the US that will pour all those ressources against russia if it comes to open war : It's the EU.


If it will come to war, Europe and Russia will simply cease to exist in my opinion, thinking that Russia will not use nuclear and other means (if threats about its territorial integrity/independence emerges) is short sighted. Last time Russia faced United Europe, coincidentally under German leadership, it lost at least 10% of its population and was crippled for generations to come. The memory of this war still lives in mind of every Russian and the idea of ""never again"" is very much alive, meaning we will drag you with us to hell if we were to perish in flames of history. Keep that mind if you are calculating that Russia will stick to conventional means in case of war with NATO/Europe, **it won't**. 


&gt;""since russia couldn't force Ukraine to keep Y' in power and him taking bribes in"", we'll kill them all and annexe the country by sending in the wermarcht"".


More like destabilize them and look what will happen to them in the future. Russian armed forces involvement was pretty limited in general and ""hybrid war"" is not the one you can decisively win, it creates more of a frozen conflict state when costs for sides of conflict become too much to continue. 


&gt;So you admit you are massacring Ukrainians because you decided that they had no sovereign right to join EU instead of getting force annexed by the Soviet Reunion one way or another (""silver or lead"" anyone ?). How nice of you . Another red army invading the EU. How about the EU and western powers goes back to exterminating russian forces then ? Y'know, It goes both way, and we too have in fact lots of weapon and can kill a lot more russian that you can kill european citizens.


I am not admitting anything, since i am not a Kremlin official or a representative of Russian population public opinion views, but a random citizen with an opinion on the matter. One person, with one opinion, nothing more, nothing less.


As for my response, it initially was targeted at our American redditor, to provide him with counter-example of Russia not giving a shit about Ukraine and being more or less happy with the current status-quo in the region. Things changed there with Euromaidan+Association agreement and overthrow of Yanukovych, Russia reacted to ""new realities"" in the way it did, the rest is history.


&gt;If Russia goes back to cold war contingency plans and decide to first strike again; then we might go back to our own contingency plan too; like Operation Unthinkable.


I loved the part when war with USSR was planned before end of WW2, you guys are excellent ""allies"" and overall great chaps and then you wonder, why is it those pesky Russians don't trust us, we only planned to genocide them again, right after Germans did, whats wrong with that? 


I will say this time and time again, war between Russia and European Union would **not** be conventional, but a war for annihilation and in this case there would no more either Russia or Europe, but a nuclear wasteland.

Die Woche war relativ ereignislos... Am Dienstag Chemie und am Donnerstag Latein geschrieben, in Sport wieder Takeshi's Castle gespielt (Diemal ohne Trommelfellperforation!). Morgen steht TEDV-Klausur an, da geht's um Zahlensysteme, Aussagenlogik sowie Schaltungen. Wird ziemlich leicht.

Das Wochenende bestand dabei wieder mal aus Schlafen, Zocken und Essen. Wobei ich am Samstag von 10-12 in der Schule für den Tag der Offenen Tür eingeteilt war. Musste ins Selbstlernzentrum, das ist so 'ne Art Bibliothek in der man Hausaufgaben machen kann und ähnliches. Unser Auftrag war es Arbeitsstationen betreuen, an welchen die Besucher Arbeitsblätter mit der Hilfe der Medien im ""SLZ"" arbeiten konnten. In dem Raum stinkt es extrem, mein Kumpel beschrieb es mal als extremen ""Hefe-Geruch"", und so kam natürlich kein Schwein, abgesehen vom Bürgermeister und Anzug-tragenden Konsorten herein, und wir beschäftigten uns mit Kesslers Knigge gucken. ;)

Young and educated are supposed to be the driving force behind developing countries' political and economic progress. But when the borders open, it's easier for them to just emigrate where the situation is better then to work on bettering the situation at home.

Sure, they would come back home if the situation improved, but how can it improve if there is no one to improve it; when there is no one left in the country so discontent with the political elite for disallowing them the chance to build a better future for themselves? Those are the people that are supposed to apply the pressure on the political elite to improve the conditions. Pensioner's and pre-pensioners aren't going to fight for their future. They've got 20-30 years left. They've fought their whole life, they wanna sit back and enjoy.

The more people emigrate, the worse the situation at home becomes. The worse the situation, the more people leave. It's a vicious cycle.

Developing countries, Bosnia included, have set the EU ascension as the solution for all problems — once we enter, all the riches will be bestowed upon us and all will be better. That's bullshit.

Developing countries first need to strengthen their economy and conditions at home, before they enter the EU.

If you enter the free market with a shitty product, you'll end up homeless. That means we should work on making the product not shitty, before we enter the free market. But we do the opposite. We say ""Hey, let's enter the free market as soon as we can, then we'll work on the product, which will magically become better!""

Ask Kremlin, Russian ministry of Defence, SVR, specialists in regional conflicts, historians and the like, not me. It seems for me, that they saw the need to ""seize"" the peninsula, for what purposes, i'll use favorite Western line ""its classified"" (unfortunately i am unaware of Kremlin plans for the region, sorry).


&gt;Do you really think that Ukrainians will forget Russian intervention in 4 years? Seriosly?


I was clearly talking about the case of ""if Russia would not annex Crimea and was not involved in South-East Ukraine"". Russia had no chance of significantly influencing processes in Ukraine for at least 4 years as you say, in case Russia would not made its move. After Crimea and South-East its decades worth of damage between the countries and Russia's best case scenario here is dissolution of Ukraine into a bunch of Oblasts', with a future prospect of taking them under Russian sphere of influence (at least this is what i think Kremlin would want to see), sort a like land bridge to Crimea with Odessa and others along the way. Economic turmoil and inability to reform the country in any meaningful way will only bring this possibility ever so closer, thats just my opinion. (i am not a Kremlin spokesperson, contrary to this subreddit notion that flair=representative of the said country with a clear agenda).


&gt;If Russia didn't pose as a threat to the countries in those regions. Look, after WW2 60 years later you have Poland and Germany in the same military alliance.


What threat Russia represented in 90s, or early 00s? What was the need to expand closer and closer to Russia? Why was Russia not accepted as a member of NATO when it asked to join the Alliance? What was the need for missile defend shield, given the fact that Iran hasn't attacked anyone in like 300 years and would never do so, because its a fucking suicide. 


There are other ""whys"" and ""what for"" questions there, but its of little significance, what matters is what was to be expected from Western oriented Ukraine and evidently, Kremlin didn't liked it, hence we have a ""hybrid war"" on our hands with ever so small chances of deescalation or opportunity to ""go back to business as usual"". You honestly are not expecting for Russia to just sit idly and watch how its interests are being shat on and West is constantly spitting in Russia face, do you? Eventually Russia responds and usually this response involves some sort of war as we see in case of Georgia or Ukraine.

The problem is that I cannot find a single native German word that follows the rule of V being [v] before long vowels. V is [v] indiscriminately in all the most recent Latin based words, thus making it an exception of the spelling rather than the rule, only to preserve the etymological V in writing instead of using W.

&gt; We can't even agree now on how to pronounce it in current times.

Regional varieties are another thing and how you pronounce things is the result of historical changes and not rules someone made up one day while sitting at his desk. But Standard German is a whole different thing. 

&gt; Who are the Old Romans to tell us how to use that language?

Who are the Brits/Americans/Aussies to tell us how to use their language? You could come up with your own way to pronounce English. I'm not gonna sign a petition to jail you for that;) but at the same time there's no denying you'd be saying things wrong. You'd be misusing a written source. 

One can do as they please (yay freedom!) but as far as Latin is concerned, seeing the wrong way being favoured over the right way is mind-boggling imo.   

&gt; Just because, unlike other languages, the grammar didn't change doesn't mean that other things have to stay the same.You're just an untenable prescriptivist.

Yeah, I am simply because Medieval Latin had no native speakers while Classical Latin had. And you seem more intrested in preserve the pronunciation of this kind rather than the one which had an actual speakers' basis.

&gt; You read an proclamation made in of the remnants of the Holy Roman Empire of German Nation. Which detractors say was neither Holy nor Roman but who cares about Holy and yes, Rome was part of it once.

The most school violence I experienced (that is not against myself nor with my personal participation) was done by Roma kids in primary school. As most of Roma don't really like to participate in education, they often stay until the age of 16 in primary schools. They beat my friend just because they didn't like that he was well, big. One Roma guy attacked a guy from another class for no apparent reason. And so on. And main good thing the Roma are known for is that they don't beat their children, nor anyone between themselves overall. Hah, even if they were, getting them caught by police would be pretty hard, putting aside the fact the Poles rarely confer anyone to police, unless they are affected personally. The police is also unwilling to do anything to them if they are not caught red-handed as 1. none of them will usually care if anyone got caught and jailed 2. the very getting them caught is pretty dangerous task itself 3. nothing will really change aside for the fact that maybe one of them will spend a year in prison and the country will have to pay for that. Taking their children away is not a method either, as they will start beating others in children's homes and refuse education regardless.

Good luck in ex-commie state with pacifist+idealist attitude.

With sanctions lifted, some of the tens of billions in foreign money that left Russia might return, boosting the rouble and the economy at the same time.

false,Tom1099,POLA,Poland,"&gt;What is bad there is big group of people that urges for even further strengthening of business owners instead of workers. They believe reducing taxes and costs of labor for business will drive salaries up, which is so bullshit. 

We (as I am in that group of people you describe) believe that this will lower unemployment, and more competition on job market will drive salaries up in the long term. 

&gt; Every company is about making money and they will pay the lowest possible wage.

And every unemployed will seek for highest possible wage.

&gt; That's why finally government should help workers and worker unions.

What many people don't realise is that without employers there are no workers (and vice versa too of course). 

&gt; As I mentioned mentality ""every man for himself"" has been put into our brains, that is a combination of post-communism heritage (everything was supposed to be common, so now the pendulum went to the other extreme, everything individual, also lack of social trust) and fact that at the time of transformation Reaganomics and Thatcherism were leading economical thoughts. Politicans in Poland at the time simply didn't have the know-how, so they copied neoliberal model which brought us to this point.

Poland actually has pretty nice economy in comparison to former Eastern Bloc countries that didn't went through transformation fully.

&gt; Basically most of people would like to see less government, less social policies, while often themselves flee to countries with... more social policies and heavy influence of government on everyday life. 

Social policies aren't bad in themselves, it's often the matter of how they are implemented.

""Russia invaded us. So i'm going to attack annexate southern sudan !"" 

That makes just as much sense.

&gt;  if international law is not equally applied to every member of international community, Russia has no obligation to follow it either.

Only thing russia actually follow currently is ""stay out of my firing line"".

&gt; In case of Libya if you remember France and UK were more than trigger happy, 

Which still doesn't grant you the right to bring back the cold war just to make it go horribly wrong with a first strike. If there wasn't a ballistic shield and Ukraine hadn't raised a massive army and the west scrambled in already; Putin's russia would have used atomic weapons already.

&gt;  In case of redrawing borders, i am not going to buy ""this was an exception"" excuse in regards to Kosovo,

If you go with cases so old i can say stalin opened it with the soviet union too.

&gt;  you opened the can of worms

That predate the current EU leadership by a lot actually. So , no, we didn't. Or you want me to hold russia accountable for staline ?

&gt; don't complain when Russia stops playing by the rules and goes all hostile on your ass.

Then don't go crying when all the oligarchs are broke and turn over your gov one after another then we murder your economy some more. You declared war on us in ukraine. Back down or pay the consequences.

&gt; Was he tried or even accused by official Kiev of treason? 

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/25/ukraine-president-yanukovych-hague-trial

Process is ongoing last i heard. But it's going to be hard with the actual accusee and witness having ran away.

&gt; Somehow i haven't heard anything like that, only allegations of corruption and the like.

Destroying the economy, army and services for a 10-billion loans from russia that was stolen by his corrupt arse IS treason; whether you like it or not.

&gt; Anyway, how is Ukraine doing nowadays anyway

Last i heard, better than russia even a few years ago.

&gt; did new Government reverted the trend 

With some luck; that might happen. You don't go from the 90's to EU standards in a few months.

&gt; and Ukraine is economically prosperous? 

One day, yes, maybe, they might, if russia doesn't try to end the world in the mean time with 10'000 nukes ""because fuck the west"" like Putin routinely threathen to do in his tantrums.

&gt;  Perhaps their debt levels decreased or inflation fallen, or their currency and production is doing well?

Oh yeah. 10% inflation is totally ""horrible"" from a country that basically filled actual state bankruptcy 3 months ago. As compared to the mighty russia that looks at a ruble that will stabilise at *95* Rub per USD.

&gt; very much Western oriented and should ""into prosperity"" right?

Yanoukovich had *years* to destroy some more an already sinking ship. The pro EU gov had what, 8 months of actual power ?

But i'm sure Putin instantly ended up the 90's chaos in Russia the very day he ended up in power as opposed to taking 11 years /s

&gt;  you should probably provide examples of improvement by the new leadership, right

- End of systemic graft
- Massive reform of police forces, justice. There was a LOT of people that got recycled/pushed to desk jobs in those branchs and basically lost power.
- Mass lustration of all KGB/FSB-old CCCP related officials that aren't directly elected (they can be elected by direct vote; not NAMED/appointed ever again if i understand the exact detail properly).
- Restoring order without cracking skulls or mass arrests in most of ukraine. Meanwhile wearing a yellow headgear and blue shirt on red square lands you a week in jail in russia.
- Anticorruption bureau
- deep reforms in the energy sector; healthcare one too
- Working at preventing the rise of new oligarchs; working toward ending up some of the most corrupt sources of money that kill the economy (like state-subsidized prices for some goods like coal just to resell behind at market value to said state for the powerplants); plain old money theft
- Re-opening a large number of corruption case for people who don't clean up their act or abused largely.
- Association agreement with the EU
- Related free trades agreement
- Some on human rights (ending up torture and other bad practices; for example among the police forces or during interrogation of war prisonners who have info)
- Economical help (loans, ...). Depending on the political and economical situation in a couple years, potentially they might get a partial bailout in the end actually. Some debts owed to EU countries might get restructured in some cases; negociated to be paid in printed UAH above value etc
- Structural help for reforms (advisors; industrial or technical specialists, etc).
- Some degree of military help should russia decide to go back in.

etc etc. It's too long to list everything i think nor i do know every single details myself sorry.

&gt; Ukraine hasn't done shit for itself in its 20+ years of history

Russia certainly didn't help; ensuring they remained dependant on former soviet industry in the east, that was in russian-influencable areas and totally dependant on cheap gaz; allowing russia to blackmail them at will. Then they either bribed or threathened opposition and government leaders; if not outright poisoned with ~~polonium~~dyoxine and tried to assassine multiple times like Yushenko (you know the orange revolution guy ?).

Then they pushed in rampant USSR propaganda to rile up the ""est west divide"" and proped up Yanoukovich as ""the pro russia soviet guy"" and tasked him to finish the job.

&gt;  Yushenko/Tymoshenko/Kuchma had nothing to do with it.

The first one they tried to kill like 4 time. The second one they bribed then blackmailed when she bailed out then had Yanoukovich disappear her and she basically was tortured in jail. Third one was a former communist official. Strange how the world is small.

I know you suspect the CIA shit. But that doesn't grant you rights to invade and massacre tens of thousands of ukies either. Or maybe we should ask the SBU to rile throught a few of those FSB files lying around ? I'm sure there's bound to probably have a few things making putin hyperventilate a bit.

&gt; If you are a European i guess you can say that,

I'm.

&gt; we are just as full of shit as them (which i personally don't like, but it works in Central Asia region etc, so whatever).

It doesn't in central Europe. Especially when you send military in.

&gt; since majority of Russian population opposes invasion and war in Ukraine.

A good thing. Too bad they don't do much about it like the russian troops going back home.

&gt; World will be a nuclear wasteland,

Actually since we're talking about tens of thousands of very large warheads i'm betting past some point the athmosphere would go off and the entire surface unfit to human life no matter what. Absolute game over for humanity, no coming back., that's the true face of mass destruction warfare. You need only ONE crazy pushing the button. And why i'm a bit nervous with dudes emotional like putin loudly talking about pressing the red button while apparently half high.

The US might do quite some bullshit from time to time but i don't think they plan on ending us all for their own part.

Oh and the ""crazy and dangerous korea"" act might work. But then russia would end up like north korea. Broke; isolated; half starving. That'd be the biggest waste of potential of the century for russia to end up like this honestly :/ Russia could do great things if putin wasn't spending all his ressources and focus on sending tanks under cover in ukraine just to flip us. 

Nobody's talking about stupidly destroying the country Perestroika; but *stop fucking invading european countries with tanks for fuckin' sake*. And no sticking fingers in your ears and saying ""we are not invading ukraine, it's ukrainian separatists who invaded ukraine with thousands of russia-only-tanks they all stole from ukraine"" won't change anything. It's like a 5y old caught both hands in the cookie jar blamming the neighbor's cat.

&gt; Keep that mind if you are calculating that Russia will stick to conventional means in case of war with NATO/Europe, it won't.

Honestly i suspect a few cases : Nobody moves. Conventional forces going at each other. Absolute end of the world.

&gt; (if threats about its territorial integrity/independence emerges) 

That's the sad part. Russia keep lying to it's population it's threathened to justify first striking everyone else ; while it's not. And what should we do ? Take over a russian TV channel to warn them that the kremlin is lying ? Putin would use it as an excuse to declare open war.

&gt;  The memory of this war still lives in mind of every Russian and the idea of ""never again"" is very much alive, meaning we will drag you with us to hell if we were to perish in flames of history.

You know what worry me ? Putin having the FSB ~~blast civilian buildings with bombs~~ ~~loosing control of a cruise missile test~~ ~~nuking a random central russia oblast like sverdlovsk and using it as an excuse~~ ~~to invade Chechenia~~ ~~georgia~~ ~~ukraine~~ declare war to the EU/USA and use his mass destruction stockpile. The guy is apparently dying from cancer and has nothing to loose. He doesn't care and might as well do it as his lasts actions on earth and take everyone to hell with him because Russia-is-nothing-without-me-putin-the-great.

&gt; but a random citizen with an opinion on the matter. One person, with one opinion, nothing more, nothing less.

Yes and i'm just a computer tech bored on a computer at midnight. One single individual amongst others with an opinion varying from some of the other's too. Couch brigade for the win \*shrugs\*.

&gt; Russia reacted to ""new realities"" in the way it did, the rest is history.

Putin's using russian and historical excuses to fullfill his own agenda. That was ""invading everything in the band from odessa to Mariupol, kharkhiv"" and stuff. Then move in. 

Unfortunately, he didn't grasp that the odds of that agenda were let's say ""just fanciful"". Now, he decided he was smarter than anyone, ignored warnings from his own circle, from abroad, fired every general that disagreed, consolidated power and went ahead and now it didn't work. So he's already out of his old battleplan and grasping at straws and boxed himself between his propaganda; his oligarchs looking at their money stockpile freefalling, his failing health and some very, very angry western powers. So he feels cornered and he might do something VERY stupid again. And Russia might be the first to pay for his own acts. What a waste.

&gt; you guys are excellent ""allies"" and overall great chaps and then you wonder, why is it those pesky Russians don't trust us, 

For the records; some of the allied leaders during WWII were just as totally bonkers than Staline.

&gt; we only planned to genocide them again, right after Germans did, whats wrong with that?

Part of why those records were released was exactly for that reason : To admit our past bad actions; and come to an agreement with it; and try fixing of it what we can. And that's something i think Russia has trouble doing : Admitting they did something bad and dealing with it in the best possible way after the fact. Germany had to go throught it. Russia vaguely did it post staline, but then they doubled down during the cold war and with siberian gulags.

&gt;  but a nuclear wasteland.

Then we are all fucked. 'cause we litterally have no control over what putin might or might not do. Best we can do is not shoot back nukes at russia. But not much we can do to prevent him declaring war. 'cause the western powers CANNOT surrender any more ground to russian tanks; that ALREADY went in an European country WAY TOO FAR. Defending each others and the european motherland against another russian tank wave will override any and all western concerns. 

So, admitting we won't use nukes, If putin move further in ukraine seriously, it's general mobilisation in ukraine and *multi million* former CAS soldiers mobilizing. I wish we used those ressources for other things than scrambling to find uniforms and 1980's rusty AK for everyone, but that would leave Ukraine and it's backers with litterally no other choice for survival. Can't led the red army walk into kiev. Just warning you. And if he moves beyond ukraine like the baltics or finland, it's open war with the EU proper and NATO.",0,1417985087,null,0,1417987613,0,cmo2v0s,t3_2oikrc,t1_cmo2v0s,t1_cmo0oba,null,1425554512,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Außerdem habe ich für eine Freundin ihr neues HP Probook 430 eingerichtet.  Ist es echt schönes Teil (Sie aber auch ;) ). Ihr alter Fujitsu Siemens soll ich nochmal für ihre Mutter lauffähig machen.  mal sehe wie lange das hält.

Ansonsten war die Woche sehr gechillt.  Nächte Woche habe ich glücklicherweise noch Arbeit,  danach steht dann Urlaub für den Rest des Jahres.  

Meine Eltern und ich haben beschlossen, dass ich die nicht dieses Jahr im Saarland besuche. Grund dafür ist das mein Vater und Bruder wohl arbeiten müssen. (Sehr, sehr, sehr lange Geschichte).  Da im Saarland eh nicht viel ist, lohnt es sich eigentlich nicht da die Woche zu verbringen und nichts tun.  Stattdessen werde ich die dann nächstes Jahr besuchen.  Heißt Weihnachten werde ich wohl alleine verbringen,  was auch nicht so schlimm ist.  Waren eh nicht sehr Weihnachtlich.

Die letzte Neuigkeit dir mir noch einfällt, ist dass ich überlege ob ich nicht doch studieren möchte.  Da stehen aber noch ganz viele Fragen offen.  Evtl. Dualstudium durch meine Firma, Fernstudium oder ich lege ein paar Jahre die Arbeit nieder und konzentriere mich 100% aufs Studium.  Da weiß ich selber nicht so recht.

Hm, so im nachhinein hatte ich was zu erzählen.

false,RedKrypton,ASTR,Österreich,"It's a way how corporations, unions and the goverment interact. It's founded on chambers and centralisation. 

[Here](http://wko.at/elearningwko/Aufgaben/media/au27kt_1sozialpartner.gif) is an image to explain the social partnership of Austria better. 

WKÖ (Chamber of Commerce) and LWK (Chamber of agraculture) are the representatives of the companies and farmers. On the opposite side there are the ÖGB (Austrian Trade Union Federation) and the BAK (Federal Chamber of Labour) for the employees. It is mandatory to be a member of the WKÖ if you have a buisness, mandatory to be a member of the AK if you are an employee and mandatory to be a member of the LWK if you are a farmer. They all must exist by law.
Only the ÖGB is a voluntarily united organisation.

All got extreme privileges, for example the ÖGB is the only one with bargaining rights.

There then is the Paritätische Kommission (Joint Commission). It's consisting of several different Kommisions, all but 2 of them are either replaced or inactive (EU-membership). Those 2 are the Beirat für Wirtschafts- und Sozialfragen (Advisory Council for Economic and Social Affairs) and the Unterausschuss für internationale Fragen (Subcommittee on International Affairs).
Participation is on voluntary terms.

The social partnership is also built on the balance of interests. Because people can't quit and leave the organisation the leadership has to consider all viewpoints and can't ignore them. In every organisation there are elections every 4-5 years. Also to make the organisations independent from the goverment members pay a ~1% tax from their income mandatorily to finance everything.

So what do these organisations do?

For one the Goverment, the respective Part of the WKÖ and the respective Part of the ÖGB come together and bargain out the collective agreements. In bad years the Union holds back, but they want at least inflation requited. In good years they want to raise the saleries of their people (so all) to raised significantly as much as the buisnesses make more. This closes the wage gap. It works very civilised and there are barely any strikes as a matter of fact.

The second thing they are doing is working out laws. They debate the law and make changes accordingly and then present it to the goverment in a unified voice. The only really big strike in recent years was the education reform in which the goverment ignored concerns from the social partners and approve it anyways. To say the least, it's a clusterfuck. I am in the final year of the Gymnasium (Highschool of sorts) and I am one of the firsts to have the New Matura (Finals, Gives you the permission to study). Because the laws are then approved of nearly all there barely any problems.

They also bring attention to problems which are overlooked or help the goverment if they are totally lostm, which they have been a lot in the recent years.

If you want to look at an achivement of the austrian social partnership, look at the strikehours in the 70s and 80s. They were measured in seconds.

Our problem is strictly internal consumption based, and we are destroying employment related to that demand. And how is that strange? The past years healthcare got more expensive, taxes where raised for the lower income caps, municipal taxes are raised right now, housing taxes will be raised next year in many regions, gross turnover tax (VAT) was raised from 19-21%, mortgages can no longer be gotten on ""no pay"" basis, and mortgage interest deduction is going down slowly etc. etc. 

How can people expect we can spend money, and by that employ ourselfs, if we have less and less money to spend?

Yes our economy is groing by a very small margin, we are fiscally one of the healthiest countries in Europe, but this isn't going to end well in it's current course.

You are oversimplifying it, and being emotional when you need to make cold logical decisions can be detrimental to success and also fatal.

&gt;Is cool, but there is no reason to bar women from such highly specialized roles IF they make the requirements.

I agree, the problem is, and this always happens, is once you tell women they can't meet the standards, they claim the standards are unfair. There are now calls to lower the standards of the Marine infantry so that women will have a better chance. 

Even now the current physical standards for men and women in the military are drastically different. To the point where women are just not physically as capable as the men, and are essentially not as good at their jobs, yet get the same opportunities at advancement.

&gt;But it is much less relevant. We are not swinging broadswords anymore.

You really have no idea how combat and the military as a whole works now do you? The reason women fail at these roles is because they can't ruck well enough, and even when they do they face severe physical damage to their bodies under the stress of all that physical activity. Also holding a GPMG up and on target can be physically demanding. Even holding a basic rifle up for a long engagement is physically demanding. To say that there just isn't enough physical hardship in war these days is just plain ignorant.

&gt;A well-trained woman. Any well-trained person will be more fit than most untrained and those with better training will be likely better than those with a worse one.

This is true, but the plateau is much lower for women than it is men. Also men can get into fighting shape much faster.

&gt;Women athletes are more fit than normal men and some male athletes.

Yes, and even they are weaker than military trained males. You are acting like I am grabbing men off the street and putting them into the infantry, but then for women, I have a huge pool of athletes to choose from. This is just not the case, we have male athletes to choose from, and those males are all stronger than the females. Even more realistically, we have females who are not athletes, and males who are not athletes, and they need to be trained up quickly. Which do you think will get to the standard faster? The answer is men, and while this happens, women will fall out due to injury because their bodies can't handle it.

Letzte Woche viel zu sehr Stress gemacht, um ein Referat, unnötig zum abwinken. War einfach, nur sehr trockener Mund, ansonsten lief das wie am Schnürchen. Vorbereitung ist das A und O, hoffe das ich diese Devise auch für spätere Referate weiterverfolgen kann.

Muss jetzt die nächsten Tage alles mit einem Anwalt klären für das Schmerzensgeld für meine Verletzung. Das wird spaßig, plus noch den ganzen Versicherungskram.

Hinzu kommt jetzt noch die Klärung wie es bei meinen Eltern geht, richtig schön vor Weihnachten. Naja, hab überlegt, das weniger an mich ranzulassen, zieht mich unfassbar nach unten. 

Habt ihr irgendwelche Nahrungsergänzungsmittel, die ihr regelmäßig nehmt? Nicht nur im Bereich Kraftsport, sondern auch allgemeine, körperliche wie geistige Optimierung bzw. Verbesserung. 

Und letzte Frage an die Runde: Hat hier irgendjemand eine Testosteron Replacement Therapy gemacht? Sehe viele Symptome bei mir, wollte das demnächst bei mir mal abchecken. Erfahrungen suche ich einfach für den deutschsprachigen Raum, die amerikanschen Subreddits habe ich schon durchforstet!

Guten Start in die neue Woche euch allen!

&gt; La terapia del morbo di Lyme richiede un trattamento combinato e mirato. Applicando il preparato omeopatico Nosodi di Borrelia (che include la B. Afzelii e la B.Burgorferi) si genera un’intenso carico sul sistema cibernetico cellulare. La cellula registra un’informazione energetica negativa intensa (e misurabile) e reagisce contro la causa che l’ha determinata. Attraverso l’irraggiamento contemporaneo con Bionic 880, la cellula è così in grado di espellere la Borrelia dal proprio corpo cellulare.
Questo porta ad una reazione immunologica misurabile e quantificabile mediante i test di Laboratorio (LTT e IgM / IgG).

l´omeopatia é acqua aromatizzata rispetto alla borrelliosi, il sistema cibernetico cellulare é una supercazzola, una informazione energetica negativa non vuol dire nulla, non esiste un sistema di registrazione di energie negative nella cellula, come espella la borrellia non lo dice, il test LTT é una fregnaccia che fanno in germania, molto costoso e meno efficacie dei classici anticorpi (IgM e IgG)..

Which is simply untrue when you look at USA economy (liberal policies, lesser employment cost) and Western European model. Facts and data over last 30 years show what is good and what is not.  

&gt; What many people don't realise is that without employers there are no workers (and vice versa too of course).  

Yes, but Polish law favors employers over employees.  

&gt; Poland actually has pretty nice economy in comparison to former Eastern Bloc countries that didn't went through transformation fully.  

What do you mean full transformation? Russia has gone full transformation with their flat tax rate. Is it really a good place to live? Economically of course? I bet it is for 1% of newly rich.  

&gt; IMO Poland suffers because it doesn't provide a good environment for small companies and start-ups.  

This is another common myth. We have too many small companies to be competitive on global market. We have few times more companies than healthy economies like Germany. We need big Polish companies. Business lobby is being financed by big corporations (also western ones) that hide behind ""small and medium companies"" myth to keep employment costs low so they can drain Poland out of our money. It's what companies do, maximize profit with all means. It is our job to put stop to that.  

&gt; For example: according to Ease of doing business index Poland suffers  

Biggest economical boom in South Korea happened when you would have needed 300 permits to star company. If someone wants to start a company and it is a good idea and market is not saturated it will work out. I mean, come on, if someone cannot be bothered to get few permits how can he run a fucking business.

false,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"&gt;There is no exact definition of democratic socialism. Some forms of democratic socialism overlap with social democracy, while other forms reject social democratic reformism in favor of more revolutionary methods, and overlap with Revolutionary Socialism.

Now, just because there is no exact definition does not mean you can make up whatever you want and say that's what it is.

What do the Social Democrats that populate Scandinavia have in common with, say, [James Connolly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Connolly)?

Other than the fact both argue for better working conditions for workers(Something not so common to hear about today even from the Social Democrats), there's pretty much no other overlap. James Connolly is anti-capitalist. The Social Democrats you talk about have not made any such moves towards anti-capitalism, not even something like [Cybernetic Planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn).

They don't adhere to Marxist theory, and they don't adhere to the theory of any Utopian Socialists I've heard of, and they don't advocate or act on Anti-Capitalist principles, so precisely what makes them Socialist?

Well, yes, but before any such argument would make sense, you'd have to have a definition of ""work"". What are the criteria? Based on your last question, it seems that your operating definition is that maximum food output is desirable. Well, that's what we're doing now, at tremendous cost to the environment, and we're throwing out food in enormous amounts.

Granted, we don't have a purely ""capitalist"" system, though I'd argue that the CAP and similar are a direct result of the realities of capitalism, because farmers going ""out of business"" is systemically problematic.

As for housing, sure, the idea that you can own land is in itself a little absurd, when you think about it. We're only here temporarily, and I don't see why any baby born today has any less right to the planet and its resources than anyone who happens to be older than that baby. The fact is that land is itself a precious resource, and there are only more and more people. Inevitably, the people who happened to be the descendants of land owners will own disproportionate wealth compared to those who didn't, with nothing but ancestry to show for it. That seems grossly unfair, and is by the way a recipe for world conflict.

&gt; I can understand some degree of income redistribution, but I simply cannot grasp why someone would want to socialize production. The developed world at least is not struggling with a lack of food (or even with access along the socio-economic spectrum, I would argue). So why is production a problem?

Actually, production is already socialised, but poorly. The CAP is an example of that.

I wouldn't argue that the developed world is struggling with *access* to food, but we *are* struggling with *quality* of food, and most importantly we are struggling with the environmental impacts of our food production.

false,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"&gt;Inequality for one

Introducing a Planned Economy which the workers have democratic control over would address this. Inequality is a product of the market system coupled with the existence of private property. This allows wealth to be concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer people and leads to spiraling and dramatic inequality. 

That is, there cannot be equality when there's a section of society that exploits the working class in order to extract the Surplus Value produced by their labour. 

As such, the proper solution would involve ending the market system and ending the system of private property, and introducing democratic management of the economy. 

&gt;Global warming

A phenomenon that is largely going to effect the working class. Actors in the market care mostly about short term profits, due to how ownership of them is structured. 

Due to the market system, people are, obviously, forced to compete against eachother. As a result, they'll cut costs where they can. For example, if I invent a machine that allows me to double productivity, I'll cut my labour force in half in order to cut costs and produce a cheaper product. If I did not, my competitor would do so and would undercut me and drive me out of business.

Similarly, enviornmentalist measures cut into profits and make me less competitive. As such I would avoid doing them. The state is incapable of forcing me to act on enviornmentalism because the state is ultimately managed in my class interests - As those who manage the state are generally members of the owning class/due to being Capitalist states are still subject to the demands of the market and must compete with other states, and even if one state manages to get me to do it, not all of them will.

Many Greens are Socialist because they recognise Capitalism is incapable of tackling this issue due to the structure of ownership and the profit-motive. Introduce a democratically structured planned economy, and you remove the profit-motive from the equation and you address the issue of ownership.

&gt;Military industrial complex

The internationalist aspect of Socialism addresses this... Once you realise that states are artificial creations as a result of the private ownership of property, and that all people are fundamentally the same, anti-militarism is the name of the game. 

That is, Socialists should realise that the working class is artificially divided by state borders which have historically been imposed on us by the ruling class in order to suit their interests. Given that Capitalism is an international system, Socialism must also be international to match it, but in a different manner. That is where the phrase ""Worker of the World, Unite!"" comes from.

Address that, and address private ownership of industries, and you can't have a military industrial complex.",0,1417989337,null,0,false,0,cmo5cc9,t3_2oizs8,t1_cmo5cc9,t1_cmo4pi5,null,1425553282,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Isn't that exactly what we're seeing today?  Only the names have changed.  

So we are looking into a mirror.  The image is labeled ""Soviet Threat"" or ""Russian Threat"", but we are actually seeing the wolf pack that runs the NATO-bloc, the Anglosphere, and Evil Empire #1. 

❧

Back in the early 1980s, when I first learned about things like [""Operation Paperclip""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip) and [""Operation Condor""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor), I found a way to summarize these revelations: ""Germany lost WW II but the Nazis won"".  And now the most vicious fascists have returned to power, once again under the guise of ""Protecting"" the West from the East.

Once again, the aim is global domination -- the sort of domination that the British Empire enjoyed, for example. Whatever the cause, the U.S. has regressed to the master/slave paradigm of the Old Testament: The top 1% give the orders and the whole world obeys.  Obey, or die: the ""peace"" of the slave or the ""peace"" of the grave.  

❧

But don't these devils remember the beating they took in World War II?  They can't even crush Afghanistan, so what makes them think they can crush Russia?  I think we have to assume that they are delusional -- as the original Nazis were delusional.  Supremacist ideology takes the place of reality.  The poisonous supremacist ideology that afflicts Israel also afflicts the ruling circles in the U.S..  Here, it is called ""Exceptionalism"" -- the megalomaniacal belief that our own rulers are inherently ""Above the Law"" and have some sort of ""Divine Mission"" to ""Save the World"", whatever the cost.

For our rulers, one is either on the top or on the bottom.  The middle position, where all are created equal, is something our rulers find inconceivable.  A multipolar peace based on mutuality, reciprocity, and equal rights is something the U.S. seeks to prevent.  

❧

Fascism is the ideology of national suicide -- suicidal bellicosity, suicidal arrogance and ignorance.  It should be seen as a spiritual and political disease.  I do believe that our plutocratic rulers are suicidal.  **They are prepared to sacrifice everything ... to achieve nothing**.

❧

Germany today is a puppet of the Anglosphere -- the real power lies in the U.S. and the City of London enclave.  But the puppet is being well fed and groomed, in preparation for the next war.

Petras provides a concise but profound history of this puppet's rebirth and resurgence.  Here are a few of the milestones: 

&gt; * **[Post-war:]** After Germany’s defeat, division, and disarmament, and with the extension of Soviet power, the US reinstated the Nazi industrial and banking giants, officials and intelligence operatives. 

&gt; * **[Late 1960s:]** The EU served as Germany’s instrument for conquest by stealth. Year by year, through ‘aid’ and low interest loans,the EU facilitated German capitalist’s market penetration and financial expansion,through out south and central Europe.

&gt; * **[Annexation:]** Germany’s projection of power on a world scale would never have occurred if it had not annexed East Germany. .... Germany was transformed from an emerging influential EU partner into the most dynamic expansionist power in Europe, especially in the former Warsaw Pact economies. 

&gt; * **[Colonizing Russia:]** Germany converted its trade relations with Russia from one between equals into a ‘colonial’ pattern: Germany exported high value industrial products and imported gas, oil, and raw materials from Russia.

&gt; * **[Destroying Yugoslavia:]** Germany intervened in Yugoslavia, aiding and abetting separatists in Slovenia and Croatia. It backed the US-NATO bombing of Serbia and supported the far-right, self-styled Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), and engaged in a terrorist war in Kosovo. Belgrade was defeated, and regime change led to a neo-liberal client state. The US built the largest military base in Europe in Kosovo. Montenegro and Macedonia became EU satellites.

❧

We learn why the Stalinist regimes of East Europe were so eager to join NATO when communism collapsed:

&gt; Given the reactionary origins and trajectory into vassalage of the Eastern, Baltic, and Balkan regimes, and given their political fears of a popular reaction to the loss of employment, welfare, and independence resulting from their implementation of savage neoliberal “shock policies”, the client rulers immediately “applied” for membership as subordinate members of the EU and NATO, trading sovereignty, markets, and national ownership of the means of production for economic handouts and the ‘free’ movement of labor, an escape valve for the millions of newly unemployed workers. 

❧

We learn about the ""decade of infamy"" in Russia -- which Evil Empire #1 hailed as a triumph of ""liberal democracy""!

&gt; During the ‘decade of infamy’ (1991-2000) extreme privatization measures by the client rulers in Russia on behalf of EU and US investors and gangster oligarchs, added up to vast pillage of the entire economy, public treasury, and national patrimony. 

&gt; The image and reality of a giant prostrate vassal state unable to pursue an independent foreign policy, and incapable of providing the minimum semblance of a modern functioning economy and maintaining the rule of law, became the defining view of Russia by the EU and the USA. 

&gt; Post-communist Russia, a failed state by any measure, was dubbed a “liberal democracy” by every western capitalist politician and so it was repeated by all their mass media acolytes.

❧

Petras explains what happened when Russia got tired of being looted: 

&gt; At first, Putin optimistically assumed that, Russia being a capitalist state, and without any competing ideology, the normalization and stabilization of the Russian state would be welcomed by the US and the EU. He even envisioned that they would accept Russia as an economic, political, and even NATO partner. Putin even made overtures to join and co-operate with NATO and the EU. The West did not try to dissuade Putin of his illusions. In fact, they encouraged him, even as they escalated their backing for Putin’s internal opposition and prepared a series of imperial wars and sanctions in the Middle East, targeting traditional Russian allies in Iraq, Syria, and Libya.

&gt; As the ‘internal’ subversive strategy failed to dislodge President Putin, and the Russian state prevailed over the neo-vassals, the demonization of Putin became constant and shrill. The West moved decisively to an ‘outsider strategy’, to isolate, encircle and undermine the Russian state by undermining allies, and trading partners

❧

We read about Germany's ""outreach"" to the Balkans and even to Moldova:

&gt; High German officials “visited” the Balkans to bolster their ties with vassal regimes in Slovenia, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Croatia. Under German direction, the European Union ordered the vassal Bulgarian regime of Boyko “the booby” Borisov to block the passage of Russian-owned South Stream pipeline to Serbia, Hungary, Slovenia, and beyond. The Bulgarian state lost $400 million in annual revenue … Germany and the US bankrolled pro-NATO and EU client politicians in Moldavia – securing the election of Iurie Leanca as Prime Minister. As a result of Leanca’s slavish pursuit of EU vassalage, Moldavia lost $150 million in exports to Russia. Leanca’s pro-EU policies go counter to the views of most Moldavians – 57% see Russia as the country’s most important economic partner. Nearly 40% of the Moldavian working age population work in Russia and 25% of the Moldavians’ $8 billion GDP is accounted for by overseas remittances.

❧

What will happen?  Will the fascist disease ravage the planet and propel the human race into a nuclear orgy of self-annihilation?  Or will it be checked?  Petras is optimistic:

&gt; The “Russian Threat” has become the war cry for cringing vassals – the phony justification for imposing frightful sacrifices to serve their imperial ‘padrones’ in Berlin and Washington – fearing the rebellion of the ‘sacrificed’ population. No doubt, under siege, Russia will be forced to make sacrifices. The oligarchs will flee westward; the liberals will crawl under their beds. But just as the Soviets turned the tide of war in Stalingrad, the Russian people, past the first two years of a bootstrap operation will survive, thrive, and become once again a beacon of hope to all people looking to get from under the tyranny of US-NATO militarism and German-EU economic dictates.

Yet that is exactly what you do.

Neither is there much of an overlap between the German SPD and American Democrats.

There also isn't much of an overlap between Barack Obama and Kim Jong Il although both call themselves democrats and officially endorse democracy.

Islam and Christianity also aren't exactly the same, they are still both Abrahimic religions and believe essentially the same crap.

Things don't need to be exactly the same to be described in certain ways.

&gt;The Social Democrats you talk about have not made any such moves towards anti-capitalism, not even something like Cybernetic Planning.

And they don't have to do that to be socialists.

Maybe you should try to educate yourself about socialism before commenting on these topics.

&gt;They don't adhere to Marxist theory

Actually, they do.

As you would know if you actually educated yourself and read the links I provided you with:   

&gt;The Social Democratic Party's position has a theoretical base within Marxist revisionism. Its party program interchangeably calls their ideology *democratic socialism*, or *social democracy*, though few high-level representatives have invoked socialism since Olof Palme. The party supports social welfare provision paid for from progressive taxation. The party supports a social corporatist economy involving the institutionalization of a *social partnership system between capital and labor economic interest groups*, with government oversight to resolve disputes between the two factions. In recent times they have become strong supporters of egalitarianism, and maintain a strong opposition to what they perceive as discrimination and racism.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Social_Democratic_Party


&gt; and they don't adhere to the theory of any Utopian Socialists I've heard of

Who cares what you have heard of? Who cares about what you believe ""Utopian Socialists"" are and what the people you are referring to think? I don't even know what the hell you are talking about. I don't know these people. I don't know what you heard of. I just know it's apparently bullshit considering what you tell me.

&gt;and they don't advocate or act on Anti-Capitalist principles

Why would socialists do that? Capitalism and socialism are both part of communist socioeconomic development theory. Socialists support capitalism in many ways and consider it necessary until certain stages of socioeconomic development are reached. What happens then can be witnessed all over Europe and Scandinavia. What happens after that is a global movement, what happens after that is communism. That's how this works.

&gt;so precisely what makes them Socialist?

The fact that they fit the *actual* description of socialists (i.e. not the definition you apparently made up) and the fact that they are officially representing socialism in Europe. For more information refer to the Wikipedia articles I already linked you to. Repeatedly.

&gt;When wikipedia refers to Social Democracy in that context, it means people like Jean Jaurès, not modern Social Democrats.

No. It doesn't.

Thats because international law was previously thrown out the window and into the dumpster of history with a direct involvement from Western nations and their elites. As it currently stands, Russia is indeed disregarded international law and quite blatantly violate it, pretending that its not in the meantime, plausible deniability, confusion, Western beloved term of maskirovka etc.  


&gt;Which still doesn't grant you the right to bring back the cold war just to make it go horribly wrong with a first strike. If there wasn't a ballistic shield and Ukraine hadn't raised a massive army and the west scrambled in already; Putin's russia would have used atomic weapons already.


Don't kid yourself, missile defense shield in its current iteration is a joke, not worthy of discussion, its danger is in capability of expanding and upgrading it. Ukraine ""massive army"" participating in ATO was 60-80 thousand people last time i checked, by all accounts this is a formidable force, but nothing Russian Army, Navy and Air force could not deal with. The main ""problem"" would be domestic unrest + probability of partizan war against Russian occupation forces is almost a given, not  a fight against regular forces. I am sorry, but Ukraine is in no condition to fight ""real war"" with Russia, regardless of what mr.Poroshenko delusions are. In modern war if you loose means of production (tanks, airplanes, small arms, artillery shells etc), you loose. Ukraine has no capabilities for either defense of factories, nor striking capabilities against Russian industrial base. All of this is in case of ""theoretical full blown war"" between Russia and Ukraine, which i **do not want to see**. 


Western reaction were sanctions mostly to further prevent Russian involvement, it worked i'll give you that, since Russia is not hell bent on conquering Europe or World, contrary to popular opinion here. Nuking Ukraine also serves no purpose, since there is nothing to gain from the fact, unless you believe Ukrainian propaganda of course and that Russia and all Russians want to genocide Ukrainians, to wipe them off the face of earth, just like the stupid vatniks they are. For me this view is borderline insane and right there with an idea that Holodomor was specifically engineered campaign to exterminate Ukrainians en masse just like Germans wanted to kill Jews.


&gt;If you go with cases so old i can say stalin opened it with the soviet union too.


I go only with cases as old as modern Russia, which is about ~20 years. Since the political actors are pretty much the same and views shared of Russia in 1999 have not changed that much it seems. 


&gt;That predate the current EU leadership by a lot actually. So , no, we didn't. Or you want me to hold russia accountable for staline ?


NATO found its ""new purpose"" in this campaign, countries which consists of todays European Union participated in the process, their elites/think tanks all had a hand in it and surprise, surprise, a lot of them still hold influential positions and sometimes i wonder if things are not run by the same Cold-War era ""specialists"" when it comes to Russia. Just an opinion, though. 


&gt; Then don't go crying when all the oligarchs are broke and turn over your gov one after another then we murder your economy some more. You declared war on us in ukraine. Back down or pay the consequences.


My hope would be to see oligarchs hanging from the poles or rotting in Gulags to be perfectly honest with you, but a man can dream :) Sure you are murdering our economy and *you had no other choice* but to murder our economy, since its impossible to deal with current Russian leadership (at least this is the vibe i got from reading articles about Germans and their views), neither could you abandon your Eastern European/Baltics/Central European allies.


 All of it is natural and to be expected, really, its a sort of a geopolitical clash and since both sides were unwilling to compromise or willing to listen to their ""partners"", we have ourselves a hybrid war in Ukraine. Not a real one, not yet, but its getting there little by little it seems and i can't see an end in sight. Perhaps you will succeed and subjugate/humiliate Russia in its current iteration (weak, disorganized, with lack of ideology or any clear designated goals, targets), i just hope that as a result of this ""great victory"" Russia would not turn itself into a real post WW1, pre WW2 Germany in its rage and feel of ""injustice"". A man can dream as i said before :)


&gt;Process is ongoing last i heard. But it's going to be hard with the actual accusee and witness having ran away.


Good, good, lets just hope it won't end like mr.Mubarak case.


&gt;Destroying the economy, army and services for a 10-billion loans from russia that was stolen by his corrupt arse IS treason; whether you like it or not.


Ukraine has been destroying its army long before Yanukovych, Ukrainian ""praporshiks"" (ensign) greed is legendary and i believe Nicolas Cage even starred in a movie about a particular arms dealer and its dealings with Ukraine, ofc its a movie and all, but ""where there is smoke, there is fire"" as they say. 


Russian loan deal was during Euromaidan anyway or very close to it, how could it destroyed the country, when its impossible to destroy/plunder the country on such  a short notice? Or you are one of those, who believe Ukrainians, when they say that Yanukovych ran away with 80+ billion of $ (i don't remember how much exactly is their estimates)?


It was a deal for loyalty, it didn't worked out, to pretend that Ukrainian economy was doing great before Euromaidan and had great prospects in the future is a bit weird. 


&gt;Last i heard, better than russia even a few years ago.


They do? Strange, i've read about 20% inflation, GDP drop of 5+%, production decline, worst devaluation of currency even in comparison to Russia, depleting of foreign currency reserves, problems with heating and electricity, rise in unpaid bills for communal services and so on and so forth. Maybe we are reading different sources though.


&gt; With some luck; that might happen. You don't go from the 90's to EU standards in a few months.


You won't go there in a couple of years either. But i guess luck is an important factor in the equation, well god speed.


&gt;Yanoukovich had years to destroy some more an already sinking ship. The pro EU gov had what, 8 months of actual power ?


Nah, i think he simply continued the work of Kuchma, Yushenko and Tymoshenko with their oligarch cliques. One of many ""pieces of work"" who simply continued the path of ""loot and plunder"". 


List is nice and all, lets hope for good results and ""Hope and change"" being a real desire of Ukrainian population and not an excuse of oligarch clans to ""split the pie among them"". Sorry for being skeptical, i am sure you could understand since i have Russian flair :)


&gt;Russia certainly didn't help; ensuring they remained dependant on former soviet industry in the east, that was in russian-influencable areas and totally dependant on cheap gaz; allowing russia to blackmail them at will. Then they either bribed or threathened opposition and government leaders; if not outright poisoned with poloniumdyoxine and tried to assassine multiple times like Yushenko (you know the orange revolution guy ?).


How is it Russia's fault that official Kiev did not wanted to reform the country for 20 years? Those evil Russkies, selling gas cheaper than anyone in the world, the horror! What stops you from accumulating ""reserves"" in preparation for huge modernization program? Its a profitable business if industry works on cheap gaz, no ? Makes you more competitive in terms of price at least (not quality obviously, but Russia does not control soviet industry in the East of Ukraine). As for blackmail, Ukraine could start a university in that regard in relations to Crimea, gas transit fees, gas prices for population and so on. 


As for mr.Yushenko dyoxine poisoning, is there any evidence of that, apart from ""poor mr.Yushenko"" saying so anyway? What was the public opinion of Yushenko anyway when he lost power during his presidency? How come Yanuk could come to power, when Yushenko+Tymoshenko were such great political leaders worried about the future of Ukraine. Does this not smell funny to you? 


South American leaders every other day accuse United States of giving them cancer and such, does this makes their allegations true or perhaps its something else, something designed to get an emotional response for ""poor victim of bad guys""? Don't buy everything you hear in the media, its quite often bullshit engineered to get a ""sympathizer"". 


&gt;Then they pushed in rampant USSR propaganda to rile up the ""est west divide"" and proped up Yanoukovich as ""the pro russia soviet guy"" and tasked him to finish the job.


Poor Ukrainians, always manipulated and misled by evil Russia, they themselves do not hold their fate in their hands, its always Russian conspiracy to subjugate Ukraine. Sort a like Russia is constantly fixated on U.S and think that everyone is out to get them.


&gt;The first one they tried to kill like 4 time. The second one they bribed then blackmailed when she bailed out then had Yanoukovich disappear her and she basically was tortured in jail. Third one was a former communist official. Strange how the world is small.


I would think that if Ukraine would have proof of Russia actively targeting Yushenko in assassination attempts, they would presented them already, to prove that Russia is a mafia-evil-fascist-murderous-dictator like regime. Nothing speaks louder than truth, so, where is the proof of Russia actively pursuing death of mr.Yushenko. Otherwise we would get right there with Polish President plane level of conspiracies and so on.

Momentan lebe ich in [bearbeitet], in [bearbeitet], **welches** eine Gemeinde Londons ist - Ich habe hier mein ganzes Leben gewohnt und deshalb habe ich nicht so viele Alltagserfahrung**en** in anderen Orten zu leben. Finchley ist ein ziemlich kleines Gebiet in Nord-London, mit guten Verkehrsmittelverbindungen, wie **dem** Woodside Park U-Bahnhof, das **schnell** zu**m** zentralem London fährt und viele Busse, die ich oft benutze. Auch im Zentrum [bearbeitet]s gibt es eine Menge nützlicher (und nicht so nützlicher) Läden, einschließlich 5 Banken und 7 Cafés **nur in der** Hauptstraße [bearbeitet]s, die ich nicht so oft besuche, da die Geschäfte i**m** zentralem London viel besser sind. Zusätzlich gibt es mehrere Parks in [bearbeitet]. Im Norden, Osten und Westen [bearbeitet]s gibt es ingesamt 4 Parks, viel mehr als in vielen **anderen** Städten.

Wie haben Sie letztes Wochenende verbracht?

Letzes Wochenende war ziemlich ruhig**.** Wirklich**!** Ich verbrachte die Mehrheit der Zeit zu Hause und machte relativ wenig, abgesehen von Lernen für meine Probeprüfungen und **das schreiben dieses Essays**. (Doch sowie diese Arbeit ging ich mit einigen Freunden zum Osten Londons aus) **&lt;- what do you mean? I don't understand it!**, um diesen Teil Londons zu erkunden und hatte ziemlich vielen Spaß. **Meine Freunde und ich (first the others, then you..)** sind, wie normalerweise**,** viel gelaufen und haben ein leckeres Mittagessen gegessen aber außer dieser Dingen, haben wir nicht viel gemacht.

Welche Vorteile hat Ihre Gegend?

Ich muss zugeben, dass meine Gegend ein **b**isschen langweilig ist und, dass ich andere Orte in London und der Rest der Welt bevorzuge aber es gibt allen Ernstes viele Vorteile der Stadt. Erstens gibt es, wie ich schon erwähnt habe, sehr gute Verkehrsmittelverbindungen, einschließlich Busse und U-Bahnhöfe, von denen man zu London und außerhalb der Stadt fahren kann. Auch gibt es viele gute Schulen, sowohl Grundschulen als auch Sekundärschulen, wie zum Beispiel meine Grundschule, [bearbeitet], ebenso wie die Vielzahl Läden, die ich schon beschrieben habe.

Wie würden Sie Ihre Stadt ändern?

Obwohl ich der Meinung bin, dass [bearbeitet] ein vorteilhafter Ort **zum aufwachsen ist**, muss ich sagen, dass ich, wenn es nach mir ginge, einige Sachen ändern würde. Zum Beispiel, wenn ich Machtvollkommenheit über [bearbeitet] hätte, würde ich die Zahl Banken, Handyshops und Wettbüros verringern, denn **es gibt einfach zu viele dieser Geschäfte**. Auch glaube ich, dass mein Ortsbereich eine viel interessantere Kulturlandschaft braucht, weil [bearbeitet] derzeit etwa kulturell öde ist.

Wo möchten Sie in der Zukunft leben?

Ich habe viele Meinungen **darüber,** wo ich in der Zukunft leben möchte und sie sind ziemlich abwechslungsreich, in einer Vielzahl Ländern. Da ich in England (und London) mein ganzes Leben gelebt habe, ist es sehr verständlich, dass die Mehrheit der Bereiche, wo ich leben **möchte dort sind**. Die Orte in London wo ich leben möchte schließen Islingtons (da es in der Nähe des Zentrums Londons ist und eine gute Kulturszene hat), Highgates (da es sehr schöne Architektur hat) und Westminsters (wegen seiner Nachbarschaft zum Zentrum). Zusätzlich glaube ich, dass Japan, Skandinavien (als Ganzes) und (natürlich) Deutschland wünschenswerte Orte **zum leben wären**.

Except you didn't define it. You just said ""X is bad, lets do Y"". That's not a rational argument. First you have to define how and why X is bad, *then* you have to establish why Y is better. Thus far, you've said that free market farming is wasteful and environmentally unfriendly. Even if we were to accept these claims, you still haven't explained how collectivization will remedy these problems.

&gt;  because farmers going ""out of business"" is systemically problematic

Why is this problematic?

&gt; As for housing

You don't actually explain why socialized housing works better than what we have now. In fact, you seem to argue that one shouldn't own land (or that land should be allotted in some equal measure), which makes me wonder why anyone would want to develop the land to begin with, if someone it going to come along and hand over the land you've worked on to someone else.

&gt; That seems grossly unfair

The problem, in my opinion, is that you see developed land and housing as something that people stumble onto. They don't build, they don't work the land, they don't maintain it. It all just... appears.

Consider how much a new building built according to modern stringent codes costs. The people who built it will most likely spend a considerable portion of their lives paying off the debt for that building. Let's say 30% of their income goes into paying for it. That means they work 2.4 hours out of every 8 hour workday to pay for it. So I just don't understand how you can argue how their ownership of the building and the land is ""absurd"" and that they're not supposed to be able to pass the property onto their children or whomever they want to give it to.

&gt; I wouldn't argue that the developed world is struggling with access to food, but we are struggling with quality of food, and most importantly we are struggling with the environmental impacts of our food production. Solving that problem is impossible within the current system.

There is nothing wrong with the quality of the food. We all have access to various dietary options. Your argument in reality is that consumers make poor choices in terms of food. Your problem is not with food production, but with consumer choices.

And I still don't see how production can solve the environmental impact. You can socialize it, you can regulate, but none of that matters if people have access to the same food choices as now and choose to consume the same food as before. So, again, your problem is with consumer choices. Granted, you can artificially enforce some dietary choice on the population, but that still isn't a problem with production itself.",0,1417989888,null,0,false,0,cmo5nwd,t3_2okbxl,t1_cmo5nwd,t1_cmo4rmn,null,1425553132,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

false,legion_Ger,null,null,"&gt;Ich habe hier mein ganzes Leben gewohnt und deshalb habe ich nicht so viele Alltagserfahrung ~~mit~~ in anderen Orten zu leben.
Finchley ist ein ziemlich kleines Gebiet in Nord-London, mit guten Verkehrsmittelverbindungen, wie der Woodside Park U-Bahnhof, ~~das der zu zentralem London schnell fährt~~ über den man Zentral London schnell erreicht

Ein Bahnhof fährt nicht selber, die Ubahn fährt oder man kann über einen Bahnhof etwas erreichen.

&gt;und viele Busse, die ich oft benutze. Auch im Zentrum von [bearbeitet] gibt es eine Menge nützlicher (und nicht so nützlicher) Läden, einschließlich 5 Banken und 7 Cafés ~~in nur~~ alleine auf der Hauptstraße [bearbeitet]s, die ich nicht so oft

Läden sind auf einer Straße. Ähnlich dem Englischen (on the main street)

&gt;besuche, da die Geschäfte in zentralem London viel besser sind. Zusätzlich gibt es mehrere Parks in [bearbeitet] als Ganzes. Im Norden, Osten und Westens [bearbeitet]s gibt es ingesamt 4 Parks, viel mehr als in vielen Städten.
Wie haben Sie letztes Wochenende verbracht?
Letztes Wochenende war wirklich ziemlich ruhig ~~wirklich~~, ich verbrachte die Mehrheit der Zeit zu Hause und machte relativ wenig, abgesehen von Lernen für meine Probeprüfungen und dieses Essay zu schreiben.
~~Doch sowie~~ Für diese Arbeit ging ich mit einigen Freunden zum Osten Londons ~~aus~~, um diesen Teil Londons zu erkunden und hatte ziemlich viel~~en~~ Spaß. 
Ich und meine Freunde sind, wie normalerweise, viel gelaufen und haben ein leckeres Mittagessen gegessen aber außer dieser Dingen, haben wir nicht viel gemacht.

Die Zeitform hier ist etwas seltsam, ich würde normalerweise ""Letztes Wochende ist ziemlich ruhig gewesen, ich habe die Mehrheit der Zeit im Haus ..."" schreiben.

&gt;Welche Vorteile hat Ihre Gegend?
Ich muss zugeben, dass meine Gegend ein ~~B~~bisschen langweilig ist und, dass ich andere Orten in London und der Rest der Welt bevorzuge, aber es gibt allen Ernstes viele Vorteile der Stadt. Erstens gibt es, wie ich schon erwähnt habe, sehr gute öffentliche Verkehrsmittel~~ver~~anbindungen, einschließlich Bussen und U-

Öffentliche Verkehrsmittelsanbindung.

&gt;Bahnhöfen, von denen man ~~zu~~ nach London und außerhalb der Stadt fahren kann. Auch gibt es viele gute (höhere?) Schulen, sowohl Grundschulen als auch Sekundärschulen, wie zum Beispiel meine Grundschule, [bearbeitet], ebenso wie die Vielzahl Läden, die ich schon beschrieben habe.
Wie würden Sie Ihre Stadt ändern?
Obwohl ich der Meinung bin, dass [bearbeitet] ein vorteilhafter Ort ~~in dem~~ zum aufzuwachsen ist, muss ich sagen, dass ich, wenn es nach mir ginge, einige Sachen ändern würde. Zum Beispiel, wenn ich ~~Machtvollkommenheit~~ die absolute Macht über [bearbeitet] hätte, würde ich die Anzahl Banken, Handyshops und Wettbüros verringern, ~~denn~~ da es einfach zu viele dieser Geschäften gibt. Auch glaube ich, dass mein Ortsbereich eine viel interessantere Kulturlandschaft braucht, weil [bearbeitet] derzeit ~~etwa~~ kulturell etwas öde ist.
Wo möchten Sie in der Zukunft leben?
Ich habe viele ~~Meinungen~~ Ideen darüber wo ich in der Zukunft leben möchte und sie sind ziemlich ~~abwechslungsreich~~ unterschiedlich, in einer Vielzahl Ländern. Da ich in England (und London) mein ganzes Leben gelebt habe, ist es sehr verständlich, dass die Mehrheit der ~~Bereichen~~ Orte, wo ich leben will ~~sind darin~~ dort sind. Die Orten in London wo ich leben möchte schließen Islingtons (da es in der Nähe des Zentrums Londons ist und eine gute Kulturszene hat), Highgates (da es sehr schöne Architektur hat) und Westminsters (wegen seiner Nachbarschaft zum Zentrum) ein. Zusätzlich glaube ich, dass Japan, Skandinavien (als Ganzes) und (natürlich) Deutschland wünschenswerte Orten ~~in denen zu leben~~ (zum Leben sind oder in denen ich leben will).

Communism isn't responsible for tens of millions of deaths.

The deaths under those regimes didn't occur because of communism.

In fact, non of these regimes were communist. As is made evident by the fact that they directly contradicted communist socioeconomic development theory. What Mao did in his Great Leap Forward, for example, contradicts everything communist economic theory stood for. He directly violated necessary steps in socioeconomic development as outlined by people like Marx.

They just called themselves communist.

The same way North Korea calls itself democratic.

I know a shit tonne more about Socialism than you, that's for fucking sure. Even something as mundane and shallow as a dictionary definition would yield the following;

&gt;socialism   
ˈsəʊʃəlɪz(ə)m/Submit   
noun

&gt;- a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.

&gt;- policy or practice based on the political and economic theory of socialism.

&gt;- (in Marxist theory) a transitional social state between the overthrow of capitalism and the realization of Communism.

And hey, if that's not enough for you, take a quick look at the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) page;

&gt;Socialism is a social and economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy,[1][2] as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system.[3][4] ""Social ownership"" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these.

You know what? Let's just build on top of this a bit and take a look at [Anti-Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-capitalism). What's this? The very first thing it mentions is [Socialism?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-capitalism#Socialism) But according to you, Mr. Knows Everything About Socialism, Socialism isn't an anti-capitalist ideology! 

Let's take a look at what it has to say;

&gt;Socialists argue that capitalism consists of irrational activity, such as the purchasing of commodities only to sell at a later time when their price appreciates, rather than for consumption, even if the commodity cannot be sold at a profit to individuals in need; they argue that making money, or accumulation of capital, does not correspond to the satisfaction of demand.

Hmm, interesting. So Socialists are against Accumulation of Capital. I don't think that's a fundamental aspect of Capitalism - do you? Socialists also think that Capitalism is irrational. Surely that must speak in favour of Capitalism, according to you. I just don't know it, yet!

I wonder if it has anything more to say?

&gt;Socialists view private property relations as limiting the potential of productive forces in the economy.

I see... So Socialists are against private property? Huh, you'd think that with Capitalism being based on private property in all, they'd love it! At least according to you. 

Now, where was it again that my opinions, the opinions of a Trotskyist Socialist, a member of a Socialist Party, and a Socialist activist, are ""demonstrably wrong""?

They should, their country is in a state of war with Russia according to their officials, their media and a public opinion formulated by this media. I would very much like to hear what SBU knows (and pretending that CIA has not gained access to all those files is naive in my opinion) and what is so ""hyperventilating"" there, won't it help both domestically and internationally to prove ""Big Bad Wolf Russia"" approach? Instead of making shit up and montages of bits and pieces of intercepted radio transmissions, random photoshoped images and fake videos, no ? 


Ukraine sort a lost a lot of credibility in my opinion with their daily ""Russia has invaded us this time for realz"" and other propaganda tricks, the same way that Russia lost a lot of credibility with its ""nazi junta, kids crucifying etc"". A bit of truth would not hurt in my opinion.

I am glad that Central Europe is ruled by Law nowadays and not bribery and black mail, you have come a long way. Congratz, hope some day i will see Russia there as well. 


&gt;A good thing. Too bad they don't do much about it like the russian troops going back home.


Russian ""adventures"" could be compared with early 2004 invasion of Iraq, plenty of similarities and parallels, the reality slowly ""sinks in"" in Russian public opinion mind. Economic downfall only accelerates the process. Don't expect Russians to go out and randomly start to protest, we are not a protesting nation, but more of a stoic and ""lets wait and see"" type of people. People watch, tighten their belts, some emigrate, some voice discontent, its a process (especially given the damaged and a bit irrational state of mind of Russian population). 


As for nuclear war, it doesn't really concern me, dead is dead, can't neither help it or do something about it (i know, fatalism, sigh).


As for ""plausible deniability"", it works, kind a. It also helps domestically if anything, when Russians hear how U.S arms ""secular freedom fighters"" in Syria, Russians might think that ""its okay for us to arm our guys as well"". Just a guess though. 


&gt;That's the sad part. Russia keep lying to it's population it's threathened to justify first striking everyone else ; while it's not. And what should we do ? Take over a russian TV channel to warn them that the kremlin is lying ? Putin would use it as an excuse to declare open war.


Nah, concept of first strike has made its way back into Russian military doctrine only relatively recently, just like ""nuclear deescalation strike"". In any case, what you should be doing is counter-propaganda efforts, investigations of Russian dirty money and their publication, disclosure of previous dirty deals (if possible) and assets of rich Russians outside of Russia. Tax havens would be a place to search i think among other more shadowy places. 


As for Putin and rumors of his poor state of health, i doubt that Russian security forces would act on Putins whim. If anything, its not in their interest to die in nuclear blasts, since they actually live pretty good themselves :) FSB&amp;co are pretty well funded and enjoy enormous amount of power and immunity to prosecution on a large scale, why ruin something so great because of one guy, when you can always get another guy? 


Putin gambled in Ukraine and seems like the odds are not in his favor, ""the game"" is not over yet though, but i agree, Russia is the most likely candidate to pay the price. Such is life. 


 &gt;Part of why those records were released was exactly for that reason : To admit our past bad actions; and come to an agreement with it; and try fixing of it what we can. And that's something i think Russia has trouble doing : Admitting they did something bad and dealing with it in the best possible way after the fact. Germany had to go throught it. Russia vaguely did it post staline, but then they doubled down during the cold war and with siberian gulags.


What you are describing is impossible in the next 20 years at least, precisely because it is such a recent experience. If you were to ask Eastern European/Baltics/Central European/Former USSR countries what would they want from Russia in regards to its Soviet History, everything eventually would revolt around **money**. Lots and lots of money in forms of ""reparations for occupation"", money for ""destruction of economy"", cheap gaz and oil and resources (because evil oppressive Russia) money for ""suppression of civilian population"" and many, many, many other examples of ""GIB monies"" under any excuse or pretext. 


Russia will never pay and Russian population will never support such a cause, at least in the lifespan of what i told previously. 


War with Baltics or Finland is an obvious war with EU, everyone understands that i believe.

&gt; Thats because international law was previously thrown out the window and into the dumpster of history with a direct involvement from Western nations and their elites.

That's just the latest excuse putin use this time. Cold war was ""we don't attack each others"". Putin blatantly violated this by attacking an EU aligned country.

&gt; its danger is in capability of expanding and upgrading it.

Well; the way i'm hearing it; everytime putin yell's he's going to terminate humanity with atomic weapons (roughly every two weeks); they're adding capability for another nuke.

&gt; Ukraine ""massive army"" participating in ATO was 60-80 thousand people last time i checked

That's the vanguard. If the mobilisation is declared, we're talking 2/3 million men. Russia is invading the motherland; so if that army exists for a reason this is it.

&gt; but nothing Russian Army, Navy and Air force could not deal with

Air force we can deal with i think altho i'm not privy of everything, and navy can't move inland. And successful use of nuclear weapons would drive western powers litterally berserk. Russia will be forced to rely on it's land forces mainly if they move in ukraine. That already takes out quite a lot of their firepower.

Also; as you underlined yourself the russians aren't all big on going in ukraine killing ukrainians ""because reasons evil west something"". So; i'm not sure the bulk of the army will move in either.

Russia fighting for it's own land at home would be a truly devastating force; i totally agree. But that's not the scenario at hand there; and NATO will blatantly avoid moving if russia if not provocated (like with use of nukes).

&gt;  I am sorry, but Ukraine is in no condition to fight ""real war"" with Russia, regardless of what mr.Poroshenko delusions are.

See, if i read a few reports right; russia lost already 8500+ men while they were boasting they'd be in kiev in 48h if they wanted. See, i don't think russia is in perfect shape either. And Kiev is defending their own land against a foreign invader that called themselves ""their brother"" but repeatedly stole land, publickly kidnapped and tortured their own citizens and called them constantly nazi without any reasons for the better part of a year.

&gt; In modern war if you loose means of production (tanks, airplanes, small arms, artillery shells etc), you loose.

That works for russia too.

&gt;  Ukraine has no capabilities for either defense of factories, nor striking capabilities against Russian industrial base.

Yes nor any capability to defend against anything blah blah blah. I don't think the upper ups are telling us everything on their contingency planes but i would be a bit surprised if they didn't accounted for ""russia moving in and bombing everything"" after 6 months of war in donetsk&amp;luhansk :)

&gt; All of this is in case of ""theoretical full blown war"" between Russia and Ukraine, which i do not want to see.

Nice talks; but the reality is Russia sent yet another couple tanks columns 2 days ago. But keep walking toward that open war saying you don't want it.

&gt; since Russia is not hell bent on conquering Europe or World

So, why do putin keeps thinking he's ""vladimir the ingatherer"" ?

&gt;  Nuking Ukraine also serves no purpose, since there is nothing to gain from the fact

Most russian scenarios were backed on a brutal atomic first strike then asking for surrender and brutally crushing any other sign of resistance with more nukes till it stops on it's own.

&gt; and that Russia and all Russians want to genocide Ukrainians,

No, just absolute domination and if a lot of ukrainians dies putin don't really care.

&gt;  Since the political actors are pretty much the same and views shared of Russia in 1999 have not changed that much it seems.

Then you missed most of the changes. But then i guess that we're just all the same for russians and you can't distinguish us from one another. 

Basically, everything in the EU leadership changed post Iraq-war (the one after 09/11 based on lies).

&gt; Ukraine has been destroying its army long before Yanukovych

Yup. And leaked cables and yanoukovich papers (the ones he throw in the pool before running away; with his personal notes of his private talks with putin or FSB/SBU info etc...) are pointing out at russian orders on that.

&gt; Ukrainian ""praporshiks"" (ensign) greed is legendary 

I'm sorry to have to make fingerpointing there; but that was basically the whole russian plan. Sabotage Ukraine from the inside; then when it was too weak walk in the park like they did in Crimea. Putin never handled well the fact that the former USSR states managed to get independancy while russia was weak immediatly following the collapse of the USSR. And since neither Georgia nor Ukraine were in NATO (unlike the Baltics) they became the low hanging fruits, along of course with Chechenia.

The whole point of integrating Russia in the EU was to prevent such stupid wars; but then Putin finally decided against it and to declare us war instead to get his empire back at all costs. And here we are, after his failure in ukraine.

&gt; Or you are one of those, who believe Ukrainians, when they say that Yanukovych ran away with 80+ billion of $ (i don't remember how much exactly is their estimates)?

Lol no, he planed to ran with around 50b in case things ran hot. He had to run much earlier than planned and probably only got away with a few billions. He and Malofeev spent much of that money as vengance, funding russian military in eastern ukraine and dumb manipulated idiots who thought themselves as separatists. Most of Yanoukovich's wealth *WAS* found. Even if from time to time they stumble upon new stashs.

&gt; to pretend that Ukrainian economy was doing great before Euromaidan and had great prospects in the future is a bit weird.

I never pretended it did. I'm pointing out that in fact it was basically dependant on russian gaz so russian blackmail. And since russia wanted Ukraine to kneel or keel over...

&gt; Strange, i've read about 20% inflation, GDP drop of 5+%,

... have you seen the state of the russian economy ? Half the cash in the country is stolen. Your economy per capita is weaker than Ukraine, and on a volume than fuckin' Italy; and now with the war and sanctions and stuff at 1000% inflation on ruble over a couple years. And if Russia decide to stop selling Energy to the EU they'll loose *40% GDP* altogether (the entire hydrocarbure industry would collapse) and 60% of their foreign currency income.

Sure 20% inflation and 5% GDP is a serious hit. But survivable. And next to *state bankruptcy* and nobody getting paid ever it's not *that bad* in fact.

&gt; problems with heating and electricity, 

You cut gaz entirely (they rely on the EU to sell them gaz.) and blew away with cruise missile half the country's powerplants then destroyed all the coal mines in donetsk &amp; luhansk; then stole the coal for the others; then got coal paid in advance and never delivered it.

I fail a bit to see how this is ukraine fault. Oh ok; maybe they did the mistake of ever trusting russia in the past to sell them energy.

See, it's like if say we banned the entire western economy to deal with russia and russian money, banks over night then acted surprised when russia had not a single buck abroad to spend. Maybe we should do that ?

&gt; You won't go there in a couple of years either

Generally speaking, there's 10/20y between the association agreement and official EU membership. Kiev wants to speed it in 5y but i think they'll have to maintain said reform rate for 10y to reach it :/. It was the case for most eastern members, including very successfull ones.

&gt; Sorry for being skeptical,

Even ukrainians are skeptical , no issue there :) As the saying goes, talk is cheap. People will have to keep delivering.

&gt; How is it Russia's fault that official Kiev did not wanted to reform the country for 20 years?

They paid or blackmailed anyone who wanted to reform to ensure they didn't succeed. Then Yushenko came around, and russia bribed/blackmailed Tymoshenko to sabotage him till the whole thing collapsed.

&gt; Those evil Russkies, selling gas cheaper than anyone in the world, the horror!

See, if we tenfolded the price of food to cash-making-levels to russia overnight, there would be a million dead russian in 2 months, from litteral starvation, like they did in Donbass when they stole the food and sold it at money-making-level. But we didnt. 

But noooo, russia had to rise the price of gaz because-fuck-ukraine. I mean, really ?

&gt; What stops you from accumulating ""reserves"" in preparation for huge modernization program?

Gazprom imposed agreements that prevented stockpiling or reselling/rebuying for this exact reason.

Okay buddy, calm down. I was asking you for a definition, then tentatively hinted at one, but your first response is to attack my *rationality*? Come on. Do you want to have a debate or do you want to troll?

I think I did describe one way that the current food production is bad: It's doing massive damage to the environment. We cannot ignore this as the demand for food increases exponentially with the number of human beings on the planet, and the means to grow food are controlled by fewer and fewer individuals.

&gt; Even if we were to accept these claims, you still haven't explained how collectivization will remedy these problems.

Collectivisation by itself is unlikely to solve anything. However, to produce different behaviours than we are seeing currently, we have to incentivise differently, and currently we are incentivising profit, period, with no regard to the side-effects. How that future system of incentivisation should work in detail is hard to say, and it should probably be adjusted for local circumstances, as long as it solves the major issues that we're having today.

&gt; &gt; because farmers going ""out of business"" is systemically problematic
&gt;
&gt; Why is this problematic?

Because as a farmer today, with no subsidies, you go bankrupt after a single bad harvest. That's problematic, because our climate isn't constant, but our demand for food is, while opening up a privately-owned farm is hardly free, and only barely profitable.

&gt; It all just... appears.

Well, the vast majority of property is inherited or bought, not built. Meanwhile, every single person on the planet needs shelter. Land is a prerequisite for shelter. Why should two babies born to different families have different access to shelter over the course of their lifetimes?

&gt; I just don't understand how you can argue how their ownership of the building and the land is ""absurd"" and that they're not supposed to be able to pass the property onto their children or whomever they want to give it to.

Then I don't think you've considered the end-game. What happens when literally every square centimeter of the Earth is owned by someone else, and you are born into circumstances that don't leave you with any prospect of achieving land ownership within that system? Do you go ""sorry, someone else already built something here, your only option is to be a tenant forever""? That's a massive wealth inequality that anyone born *now* will be faced with, *unless* they happen to be born to someone who already owns land or enough resources to purchase it.

Our current system is designed on the assumption that there will always be unoccupied land, because that has been the reality for the duration of the existence of the human race. However, it is no longer true, or at least the amount of arable, habitable land that nobody owns already is zero.

&gt; There is nothing wrong with the quality of the food. We all have access to various dietary options. 

No, we do not all have that access. Massive amounts of people in the developed world only have access to extremely unhealthy food, and even larger amounts of people have access to healthy food, but do not have the time in the day to cook fresh meals. For a lot of people, it's not a real ""choice"".

Granted, food quality in terms of health *hazard* has gone up over the last century, thanks to advances in both technology and regulation, but in terms of health *sustainability*, your average processed food is not up to par.

Fair enough.

&gt; Though, the U.S political system does shutting ideas out in other ways (like using first-past-the-post voting).

I'm not going to defend the US's election system (it might work well or might not, but I've no real belief that it's overall preferable to a parliamentary system), but on the other hand, I am not very convinced that FPTP (and winner-takes-all in a state) voting is effective at long-term suppression of political ideologies.

In a system like the US's, it's true that there is strong pressure to collapse to a two-party system over any period of time, and even the rare change in these parties usually results, within a few years, of another two-party situation, perhaps a new party or faction of the old party.

However, the reason that these two parties can retain their position is that they must more-or-less adhere to what the median of US society wants; if they did anything else, they would lose their positions by opening the way for a new party to displace one.  The rise of new ideas tends to come not from Big Two party advocacy, but from advocacy organizations and the press, and is merely reflected in what the major parties wind up adopting.

Yeah so basically they do what putin will tell them to the end, including sending their sons to death in ukraine ?

&gt; when Russians hear how U.S arms ""secular freedom fighters"" in Syria

Syria isn't in Europe; and was a huge screw up on our part. That much i agree. So bad that we're at the point were info on ISIS ""accidentally"" ends up in Assad's hands and we're sending the airforce against nusra. Russia doesn't bother doing much to controle the separatists on the other hand.

&gt; Nah, concept of first strike has made its way back into Russian military doctrine only relatively recently, just like ""nuclear deescalation strike"".

Yes, around the time where putin fired all the generals opposing war in ukraine and went in, a few months ago.

&gt; In any case, what you should be doing is counter-propaganda efforts, investigations of Russian dirty money and their publication,

I suspect a lot of people are already doing that. Problem is part of them probably have their fingers dirty with russia too and that slow down everything.

&gt; disclosure of previous dirty deals (if possible)

Can't pass a day without hearing people commenting on the mistrals yeah.

&gt; and assets of rich Russians outside of Russia.

They're all in sight, properly catalogued. They're listed as further sanctions should russia move further in.

&gt;  Tax havens would be a place to search i think among other more shadowy places

We didn't waited for you to look seriously on the tax heaven side :-) Those are a torn in our side since years and decades, tho for unrelated internal issues (IE massive fraud in occident and our own oligarchs stealing way too much)

&gt;  but i agree, Russia is the most likely candidate to pay the price. Such is life.

Annnnnnnd that's probably why russia has so much trouble moving on.

&gt; If you were to ask Eastern European/Baltics/Central European/Former USSR countries what would they want from Russia in regards to its Soviet History, everything eventually would revolt around money.

Probably because they feel like Russia pillaged them and plundered their entire countries for 50 years :/ The baltics feel incredibly fucked over.

Then, russia could say ""ok we fucked up but we're not paying a thing"" and there would be nothing nobody would probably do. It would have worked. The part that *truly* antagonized everyone is when they sent military power in Ukraine and putin being proud about killing people ""while there is nothing you can do"". Not even talking about MH17. People were ready to shrug off and move. But new deads ? We can't accept that, it's a repetition.

But basically, it's divided into three conceptual parts. One is about being a good person (which is the same in all cultures worldwide imo). To tell the truth, to avoid sins, to help the poor instead of spending money on things you don't need et.c. This is the big one, it's your personal struggle against Satan basically.

Another is about spreading and defending Islam. Missionary work basically, and the idea that you shouldn't hide your Muslim identity.

And then there's ""holy war"". The way we learned about ""holy war"" in Iran, was in the context of persecution. Our teachers said that it was necessary and in fact required to use force/violence in order to protect *anyone* that was being persecuted. For example, resistance against fascism in Germany would be deemed Holy War, even though Muslims were not persecuted in Germany.

Basically they argued against pacifism in that sense. You're simply not allowed to stand idly by while someone, anyone, is being murdered. You have to prevent it, with any violence that may be necessary. They call this ""holy war"" to differentiate it from regular war which is regarded as anything but holy.

It may be commentary on the modern German [man?] as viewed by someone who may also be German [and male] but does not hold the same world view or ideologies  etc... 

I am *guessing* that the [possibly very rightwing] artist is criticizing the effigy's inherent self shame/self flagellation as shown by 

1. their ascribing to English news media [NewStatesman] and subsequently the oft highly critical lens through which all Germans are looked at in it.   
2. supporting of foreign companies over German ones [Phillips] 
3. and support of Merkel whom Nationalists may consider to be a/the key cause of their woes [real or imagined]. 

I have chosen this line of reasoning because of 

1. the hidden Dienstflagge der Bundesbehörden (state flag of the federal authorities) that the artist has hidden under the over shirt of the effigy. -- Which says that [in the opinion of the artist] the modern German wants to be proud his country but also feels he must hide this pride. 
2. the hands on the face and rolling back of the head suggest that this person is taking comfort/ pleasure in his surroundings/ situation/ current state.
3. given the context the beer is most likely there as a statement of the modern German's self pacification

I have no idea what is going on out that window though. :/

**ELI5:** People often make cartoons to express what is bothering them in their social or political climate. Some people think that in one way or another all of those things posted around that man are bad influences that he is allowing himself to be ruined by. 

Again, not my view point.
Hope that this helps :)

Ah yes, lets send **thousands** of tanks to a force of (according to different estimates) from 10 to 20k people strong. I am sure no one will notice and its so easy to supply them with diesel and ammunition!


For all the ""evidence"" a random dash cam videos i have seen, or results of ""battles or column destruction"", i have seen 2-3 units being burned here and there and a variety of others on display. Can you provide me at least one video with at least 40-50 tanks on march or in position, maybe a series of pictures with at least 100 combat ready tanks on the streets of Luhanks/Donetsk? 


&gt;The fact they're not telling us means it's probably valuable and probably intended as negociation tokens.


alternatively nothing of the like exists and its just Ukrainians talking our of their ass, as usual. 


&gt;Ahaha, the SBU interception aren't made up. Even separatists like motorola or strelkov admitted so. Obviously they probably didn't got those with ukrainian old soviet technology alone but that's something else.


Some of them are genuine, some faked, its propaganda war. 


&gt;I think you are confusing with RT saying they have ""picture proof that a an ukrainian jet shot MH17"" there. With a picture showing said ""ukrainian warplane"" bigger than MH17 haha.


Shitty propaganda attempt by Russian media, very stupid, never cared about the story, was obvious fake. 


&gt;Russian army moved back and forth the border several times (for example near izvarino crossing). I don't think Ukraine has any control over that.


Crying wolf all the time leads to a well knows result of ""villagers"" having trouble believing the boy.


&gt;Yeah so basically they do what putin will tell them to the end, including sending their sons to death in ukraine ?


No, they will endure and take a cold headed approach of wait and see, sort a like Merkel did with Ukrainian crisis, when things would show signs of improvement/worsening, they could start to act, but sure as hell not because West told them to revolt and overthrow the Government, Russian population will decide the matter, not Berlin/Brussel/Washington. As for sending sons to death, if you are 18 years old you can decide for yourself whether you want to go and fight a war in Ukraine or not. Since the South-Eastern campaign even if you take Ukrainian levels of estimation (which are ridiculous, but whatever, you will refuse to listen to other sources anyway), the amount of Russian participation in Ukraine could be a range from 10 to 30k people over the entire year, which in a 140 million country is pretty small (and given a variety of fringe groups with radical views in a country as big and as different as Russia is, within a realm of possibility).


&gt;Syria isn't in Europe; and was a huge screw up on our part. That much i agree. So bad that we're at the point were info on ISIS ""accidentally"" ends up in Assad's hands and we're sending the airforce against nusra. Russia doesn't bother doing much to controle the separatists on the other hand.


if its a mistake, surely U.S would stop financing and training of ""secular freedom fighters"" right? Wrong, they continue to do so. I think Russia cares little whether Ukraine is in Europe or not, what it cares about is its interests and when they are violated, Russia acts regardless of geography. 


&gt;Probably because they feel like Russia pillaged them and plundered their entire countries for 50 years :/ The baltics feel incredibly fucked over.

Then, russia could say ""ok we fucked up but we're not paying a thing"" and there would be nothing nobody would probably do. It would have worked. The part that truly antagonized everyone is when they sent military power in Ukraine and putin being proud about killing people ""while there is nothing you can do"". Not even talking about MH17. People were ready to shrug off and move. But new deads ? We can't accept that, it's a repetition.


I doubt it would be all rainbows and unicorns as you described, in fact i expect a collective law suit from those countries against Russia as a legal successor of Soviet Union with a clear desire to get a shit ton of money, privileges and perhaps even the revoke of Russian Security Council seat, do you think Russia would risk any of that, given the fact that Russia had paid back USSR debts, contrary to the way Bolsheviks handle of Empirial Russia debts? 


If anything, people here whine and moan how great it would be if Russia were to behave European and aspire to join European Union eventually, do you even realize what kind of leverage it gives to those Baltics, Central Europeans and Eastern Europeans in regards to Russia? 


It is my strong conviction that if Russia were to ""recognize its mistakes in the past"", former USSR block would stick its claws and teeth into a beefy target with a desire of ""compensation"" and would refuse to listen otherwise. Not to mention reputation damage of Black Hole in history spanning 80 years or so.

That's a good and social thing, though. Income taxes should be lower as income taxes harm lower wage earners. This is actually a socialist thing.

&gt;cuts in the cost absorption for medical treatment and drastic cuts in pension benefits, and cuts in unemployment benefits

That's pretty shit, though. Although I think you mean that these things happen as a result of cutting income tax. Which means they can be refinanced by higher corporate tax, higher financial transaction tax, higher capital gains tax, etc.

&gt;A series of changes in the labour market known as the Hartz plan started in 2003 and the last step, Hartz IV, came into effect on January 1, 2005. These changes affected unemployment benefits and job centres in Germany, and the very nature of the German system of social security.

See nothing wrong with Hartz IV. Sure, welfare systems should be better but it was a step in the right direction (i.e. a standardized compensation system, which offers valuable insight for future programs such as basic income, etc.).

Why the hell shouldn't you thank people for doing something that's good?

Every party in a nation exists to serve the country and its people. They should all work on the same fucking goal: Improve the country and the well-being of the people. If your opponents do exactly that, then you should support them.

&gt;Air force we can deal with i think altho i'm not privy of everything, and navy can't move inland. And successful use of nuclear weapons would drive western powers litterally berserk. Russia will be forced to rely on it's land forces mainly if they move in ukraine. That already takes out quite a lot of their firepower.

Also; as you underlined yourself the russians aren't all big on going in ukraine killing ukrainians ""because reasons evil west something"". So; i'm not sure the bulk of the army will move in either.

Russia fighting for it's own land at home would be a truly devastating force; i totally agree. But that's not the scenario at hand there; and NATO will blatantly avoid moving if russia if not provocated (like with use of nukes).


Navy can blockade Ukrainian coast and possible supply lines, it can also help to control coastal cities. As for everything else, its a silly notion in general, since there is little public support for war, not even mentioning nuking anyone. I think Russia nuking Ukraine is a fantasy in general, not going to happen. 


&gt;See, if i read a few reports right; russia lost already 8500+ men while they were boasting they'd be in kiev in 48h if they wanted. See, i don't think russia is in perfect shape either. And Kiev is defending their own land against a foreign invader that called themselves ""their brother"" but repeatedly stole land, publickly kidnapped and tortured their own citizens and called them constantly nazi without any reasons for the better part of a year.


Thats ""human rights activists"" and Ukrainians levels of estimation, for all the ""deaths"", i have heard only **one** story about Pskov paratroopers graves and a variety of ""accidents on trainings"" here and there, but nothing of the magnitude you are speaking of. If i were to take a guess, this could be a total amount of casualties in South-East from separatists side, but the majority of them would be locals. I am sorry, but i find it hard to believe that Russian security and intelligence forces could be so effective in silencing everyone in the country, Russia is not that competent on the matter.


&gt;Yes nor any capability to defend against anything blah blah blah. I don't think the upper ups are telling us everything on their contingency planes but i would be a bit surprised if they didn't accounted for ""russia moving in and bombing everything"" after 6 months of war in donetsk&amp;luhansk :)


I am talking a simple Ukraine vs Russia total war hypothetical scenario. In such scenario, Ukraine has no capabilities to project force on any meaningful distance or to harm Russian production and industrial base, Russia is fucking huge and equipped way better than Ukraine, hence Russia *can* theoretically destroy Ukrainian tank building factories and the like, Ukraine can't. As simple as that. 


&gt;Nice talks; but the reality is Russia sent yet another couple tanks columns 2 days ago. But keep walking toward that open war saying you don't want it.


I no longer follow the conflict pretty much, since its of little interest to me. I doubt there would be any meaningful escalation before spring. 


&gt;So, why do putin keeps thinking he's ""vladimir the ingatherer"" ?


Don't know, don't care. The way i see it, is he plays a dangerous game, some of his tactical moves were borderline brilliant as in case of Crimea, some of them not so much (MH17 etc).


&gt;Most russian scenarios were backed on a brutal atomic first strike then asking for surrender and brutally crushing any other sign of resistance with more nukes till it stops on it's own.


What use does nuclear wasteland has for Russia? This reads more like a computer game of sci-fi novel, not a military strategy of conquering and subjugation of a nation. 


&gt;Then you missed most of the changes. But then i guess that we're just all the same for russians and you can't distinguish us from one another. 

Basically, everything in the EU leadership changed post Iraq-war (the one after 09/11 based on lies).


I guess you are the same, since i haven't seen the slightest change of attitude towards Russia. Perhaps i am blind though, i will admit i have poor eyesight. 


&gt;Mubarak was let go because he stepped down without asking actually himself for violence. An obvious deal of stepping down versus immunity.

Yeah Russia don't care one bit about hiding it.

&gt; alternatively nothing of the like exists and its just Ukrainians talking our of their ass, as usual.

Well, i guess we'll see.

&gt; Some of them are genuine, some faked, its propaganda war.

Show me a single video from an SBU interception from the official SBU youtube channel you know is fake. I'm waiting.

&gt; Crying wolf all the time leads to a well knows result of ""villagers"" having trouble believing the boy.

Especially when the wolf keep going in and out just to create that effect. Don't worry, i don't believe it affects artillery gun lock.

&gt; Russian population will decide the matter, not Berlin/Brussel/Washington

I hope so.

&gt;  As for sending sons to death, if you are 18 years old you can decide for yourself whether you want to go 

I don't think conscripts have much of a choice on whether they show up or not. Sure they can desert but then the police keep looking for them constantly.

&gt; he amount of Russian participation in Ukraine could be a range from 10 to 30k people over the entire year,

There's 40 000 Russians there currently. They keep adding as much as possible before the winter to try and outnumber the Ukrainian ""ATO"" army. Good fuckin luck. Each UA soldier they send to the hospital ; two volunteer reinforcments take his place and he'll be back later.

&gt; if its a mistake, surely U.S would stop financing and training of ""secular freedom fighters"" right?

They cut a lot of funding. And some of the main groups they're funding (like SRF) or recently the kurds don't exactly go along well with ISIS (they kindah shoot each others on sight; and we're kind of helping the kurds do it)

&gt; I doubt it would be all rainbows and unicorns as you described,

I'm not saying it's rainbow and unicorns; i'm saying if russia used their weight to walk out of a few debts; people would have hated them a lot less than using their weight to invade Ukraine with fuckin tanks.

&gt; in fact i expect a collective law suit from those countries against Russia as a legal successor of Soviet Union

To who ? The EU Was in appeasment mode with russia at the time and would have ""lost"" the case somewhere on some bureaucratic desk under the paperwork like most stuff like it; 'cause it's easier that way.

&gt; with a clear desire to get a shit ton of money, 

Yes but russia could have brought in more money from trade than sanctions.

&gt; and perhaps even the revoke of Russian Security Council seat

Lol no. The UNSC seat is there to prevent nuking each others to hell. It worked till no. That's not going anywhere.

&gt; given the fact that Russia had paid back USSR debts

I don't think they paid anything back either; don't take me for an idiot. :) In fact i remember our industrials still asking for even a % of the old USSR pre bankruptcy debts and whining at the time that we should have just had pocketed the mistral money to pay them with it; and the government laughing them away.

&gt; do you even realize what kind of leverage it gives to those Baltics

none ?

&gt; and Eastern Europeans

Little ?

&gt; Central Europeans 

Let me put it that way : Option 1°) Russia get the same say the core country already have in all our affairs; without having to use any form of threaths. They get a say in foreign diplomacy; trade; and can basically stand toe to toe to big countries like germany, UK or France without much people doing anything. They get rebuilding money; access to superpower statut again throught the EU. Equal membership as france, UK or Germany. Another big core decisionnary member.

We would get some power over internal russian affairs; **but nothing we don't already in fact get by strangling russia to hell** like we are currently thinking of doing to deal with the kremlin's yes-we're-attacking-with-tanks-but-it's-not-russia-in-fact-so-it's-ok bullshit. 

In fact, you would gain power over us, tons of money, social progress, and rebuild your country, while the power balance would in fact stay the same for us.

Scenario 2°) The current one. Russia keep using threaths against the entire planet; sending tanks to all their non nato-or-china neighbors if they don't do exactly as asked and opening wars left and right. Everybody, and i mean *everybody* either hate them or will only touch them with a 30 foot long stick at best. 

Your economy is collapsing already even without sanctions, let alone the fact that we are in love with the idea of just knee caping your economy; seal the entire border eastern european by force and be fucking done with it. The Kremlin keep repeating on TV that everything is OK you don't need the world after all and the glorious dear leader just discovered another unicorn nest. Plus the evil ~~south korea~~ Ukraine ""totally started that war by invading Russia and is totally responsible for everyone's starvation, the dear leader who drove them back straight to the white house personnaly and accepted to grant mercy to the poor surrendering very-afraid americans is personally saying so !"".

North Korea II. You are headed full speed there, of your own making. And past some point even the usefull idiots in the EU vouching for you will drop the case and give up on russia.

I'll let you pick which one is preferable for russia.

That statement makes no sense. It's somewhat like saying ""Oh, there's an apple and a fatty piece of chocolate cake. I want to lose weight and eat healthy... I will get half of both.""   

A rational government with a focus on science education, environment, freedom, and equality, and sane economics (from a global societal perspective) is a *left* government.     

People need to get away from the idea of ""centrist"" politics being the ""fair and balanced"" politics. They aren't.

I find it frustrating that people don't understand the left and right spectrum of politics.

Left wing means you support social and economic equality.

Right wing means you work against social and economic equality. 

That's literally how these things are defined.

One is inherently good for society as a whole. The other one is inherently bad for society as a whole. There is no ""reasonable center"". Either you care about society and the planet and want to progressively improve it (i.e. you are left) or you don't care about your society and the planet and only want what's best for yourself right now without caring about others (i.e. you are right). One focuses on GDP and individuals getting rich fast (i.e. the right) the other one focuses on inclusive economics that take into consideration long-term social and natural capital instead of raw profit numbers (i.e. the left).

I am sorry to sound like one of those ""proof or GTFO"" guys, but can you provide me with sources and scans of documents, where parts about Russian/FSB orders are highlighted and such? I always thought that sensitive and important documents are supposed to be burned at least, not left swimming in lakes.


&gt;I'm sorry to have to make fingerpointing there; but that was basically the whole russian plan. Sabotage Ukraine from the inside; then when it was too weak walk in the park like they did in Crimea. Putin never handled well the fact that the former USSR states managed to get independancy while russia was weak immediatly following the collapse of the USSR. And since neither Georgia nor Ukraine were in NATO (unlike the Baltics) they became the low hanging fruits, along of course with Chechenia.


See above, but didn't Georgia rearmed the shit out of itself prior to invasion of South-Ossetia with the help from U.S and Israel forces? Anyway, what parts of Georgia Russia annexed or illegally occupied, which it did not had a peace-keeping force before the 2008 war? I thought they had a crisis after dissolution of Soviet Union and those republics ""broke away"", wanting nothing to do with Georgia, Georgia decided otherwise it seems. 


&gt;Lol no, he planed to ran with around 50b in case things ran hot. He had to run much earlier than planned and probably only got away with a few billions. He and Malofeev spent much of that money as vengance, funding russian military in eastern ukraine and dumb manipulated idiots who thought themselves as separatists. Most of Yanoukovich's wealth WAS found. Even if from time to time they stumble upon new stashs.


And where exactly would mr.Yanukovych get those money given the level of Ukrainian reserves at the time? Or how would he transport them, as cash? How much was found anyway, just interested, i have seen pictures of his garage and estate, but i am more interested in foreign accounts, cold cash and so on.


&gt;I never pretended it did. I'm pointing out that in fact it was basically dependant on russian gaz so russian blackmail. And since russia wanted Ukraine to kneel or keel over...


Or alternatively a country which controls gas-transit of Russian resources to Europe black mailed Russia with Crimea, theft of gas, refused to pay and so on and so forth. Its Ukraine own problems that they had no desire/political will to change the ways of their country, there is no point in blaming everything on Russia and ""its evil malicious plans of subjugation of Ukraine"". Stop removing responsibility from Ukrainian leadership/elites, otherwise you sound like Russian conspiritards where everything is a U.S plot to hurt and destroy Russia.


&gt;... have you seen the state of the russian economy ? Half the cash in the country is stolen. Your economy per capita is weaker than Ukraine, and on a volume than fuckin' Italy; and now with the war and sanctions and stuff at 1000% inflation on ruble over a couple years. And if Russia decide to stop selling Energy to the EU they'll loose 40% GDP altogether (the entire hydrocarbure industry would collapse) and 60% of their foreign currency income.

Sure 20% inflation and 5% GDP is a serious hit. But survivable. And next to state bankruptcy and nobody getting paid ever it's not that bad in fact.


Yes i have seen the state of Russian economy, everything is ""within the norm"" given low oil prices and restriction of access to international financial markets. 


As for 20 and 5 %, sure, in comparison to bankruptcy sure its an improvement, but what are the prospects of things turning around and downfall not continuing in lets say 2015? How long Ukrainian population are willing to ""endure"" so to speak anyway? Didn't one of the reasons of Euromaidan was a poor state of economy and finances in general as well? 


&gt;You cut gaz entirely (they rely on the EU to sell them gaz.) and blew away with cruise missile half the country's powerplants then destroyed all the coal mines in donetsk &amp; luhansk; then stole the coal for the others; then got coal paid in advance and never delivered it.

I fail a bit to see how this is ukraine fault. Oh ok; maybe they did the mistake of ever trusting russia in the past to sell them energy.

See, it's like if say we banned the entire western economy to deal with russia and russian money, banks over night then acted surprised when russia had not a single buck abroad to spend. Maybe we should do that ?


They had debts for months of consumption and refused to pay, surely you could understand unwillingness to provide goods for free? 


What is this cruise missile deal anyway, never heard about it (seriously, do you have article or something), was it one cruise missile that destroyed half of the powerplants in Ukraine with all of its Oblasts'/Krai or did Russia attacked mainland Ukraine with precision missiles? I seriously haven't read anything about Russia blowing up targets on Ukraine controlled territory?


As for coal, i've read something about it, that freight trains got stuck on the border or something because of undisclosed order from RZD, but things were slowly moving there or something. Honestly, haven't heard much about the issue, but i can see that Russia is in the wrong here. 


&gt;They paid or blackmailed anyone who wanted to reform to ensure they didn't succeed. Then Yushenko came around, and russia bribed/blackmailed Tymoshenko to sabotage him till the whole thing collapsed.


Is this why European Union itself was the biggest lobbyist in regards to Association Agreement and freedom of Tymoshenko from prosecution? Seems a lit weird, wanting to get someone out of the cage, who was a Russian agent according to Ukraine?


And again a notion that everything bad that has happened in Ukraine is Russia's fault, those evil scheming Russkies and their KGB. damn them! 


&gt;See, if we tenfolded the price of food to cash-making-levels to russia overnight, there would be a million dead russian in 2 months, from litteral starvation, like they did in Donbass when they stole the food and sold it at money-making-level. But we didnt. 

But noooo, russia had to rise the price of gaz because-fuck-ukraine. I mean, really ?


Price of gaz is an instrument of ""soft power"" in a way. Its not really that soft, but it gets the message across in a simple and easy to understand way. Anyway, Russia did not increased the price tenfold nor is reliant on Western Exports of agriculture that much and 2 months is enough time to get supplies from other sources. Building gaz transportation systems or capabilities is impossible even in 2 years, beggars can't be choosers in that regard. 


&gt;Gazprom imposed agreements that prevented stockpiling or reselling/rebuying for this exact reason.


I was talking not about gas, but about accumulation of ""wealth fund"" sort a like Norway or Russia, for a future prospects of financing modernization program. Alternatively you could always go Corporations way and start a whole bunch of ""front"" companies in a variety of tax havens, building storage facilities across the Europe here and there by different factions, only to be later using those facilities in case of emergency.

Not even close. Local casualties, civilian included, are around 4000.

&gt; Russia is not that competent on the matter.

Hu, when you control all the tv and all the newspapers; and just label any foreign websites as all ""propaganda liars""; it's not that hard.

&gt; . In such scenario, Ukraine has no capabilities to project force on any meaningful distance or to harm Russian production and industrial base

It would be hard to it bar the west of russia; true. But most of siberia is empty. Here's a density map : 
http://www.populationlabs.com/maps/Russia_Population_Map.png

Most of the important stuff is either west or around the urals; potentially within weapon range given proper firing telemetry. As for the siberians, if russia opened open total war they'd make their move for independancy i think. They'd probably loose badly but deny reinforcments and hardware to western russia for some time.

&gt; I no longer follow the conflict pretty much, since its of little interest to me.

So from thousands to 4 or 5 in any given video or a picture, sometimes a dozen of armor carriers, but not tanks. There is a difference between APC and tank i believe, but whatever, i will not deny Russian involvement in supplying of heavy arms, its fairly obvious already, what i find highly unlikely are claims or thousands of units. 


&gt;Show me a single video from an SBU interception from the official SBU youtube channel you know is fake. I'm waiting.


I can't, because when they get caught in their lies, they instantly delete it or simply previously publish through media outlets and ""sources"" who say its SBU, only later when caught, saying that its not them. Part of information war i guess. 


&gt;There's 40 000 Russians there currently. They keep adding as much as possible before the winter to try and outnumber the Ukrainian ""ATO"" army. Good fuckin luck. Each UA soldier they send to the hospital ; two volunteer reinforcments take his place and he'll be back later.


According to whom? Ukrainians? Every other month its more and more people, either Russian intelligence has a firm grasp on every fucking soldier there and got ridiculously competent in silencing everyone and their social media accounts or perhaps the ""reports"" are not that accurate and their accuracy should be questioned. 


&gt;They cut a lot of funding. And some of the main groups they're funding (like SRF) or recently the kurds don't exactly go along well with ISIS (they kindah shoot each others on sight; and we're kind of helping the kurds do it)


I am sure Turkey is happy to hear about that. As for financing groups against ISIS, i have read plenty of times about some ""faction"" who supposedly were to fight ISIS and Assad, outright surrendering and giving out all the heavy weapon arms to ISIS. What a success story that is. 


&gt;To who ? The EU Was in appeasment mode with russia at the time and would have ""lost"" the case somewhere on some bureaucratic desk under the paperwork like most stuff like it; 'cause it's easier that way.


Eastern/Central Europe, Baltics would never let the issue to be swept under the rug. They would scream, beat the drums, shout and bang on the window in their attempts to never let the issue ""go away"". That much i am sure of, they would never let the opportunity to waste nor would U.S keep quiet about the matter. They too would be more than happy to boast about ""the victory in Cold War"" or try to pressure Russia (or previously mentioned countries) into some form of subjugation/humiliation.

http://yanukovychleaks.org/stories-about/

&gt; Anyway, what parts of Georgia Russia annexed or illegally occupied, which it did not had a peace-keeping force before the 2008 war?

""what part of georgia did russia invade before they decided to invade abhkazia and south ossetiah in georgia ?""

... really. :D

&gt; And where exactly would mr.Yanukovych get those money given the level of Ukrainian reserves at the time?

Unreported cash that did exist + mafia money + russian bribes in the millions from russia.

&gt; Or how would he transport them, as cash?

I suspect he planned the same as his energy minister, part through bank accounts, part physical gold bought with it, in trucks or planes; part stock on the trade market.

&gt; How much was found anyway, just interested

The hard issue with yanoukovich is he voluntarily blurred the line between his personnal wealth and the state's. But basically they already found like dozens of billions of money country-wide from his entire gov apparatus. That include cold hard cash, gold, goods of ridiculous value (like his gold plated boat); misattributed contracts to every single of his buddies, institutionnal corruption in several branches like public services, the cops, justice, ....

&gt; Or alternatively a country which controls gas-transit of Russian resources to Europe black mailed Russia with Crimea, 

They blackmailed russia with... themselves ? LOL. That doesn't even make sense.

&gt; theft of gas

After russia cut them for fictive debts backed by artificially inflated prices just to punish them for the orange revolution.

&gt; refused to pay and so on and so forth

That's what people do with fictive debts generally, yes.

&gt;  Its Ukraine own problems that they had no desire/political will to change the ways of their country

The population had; but they either got leaders that got fucked over by russia, were controled by russia or just plain old disguised russians.

&gt; Stop removing responsibility from Ukrainian leadership/elites

Actually i'm pointing out PAST responsability. The current ones will have little excuse if they screw up their own part of course. Well bar a war going on and the bankruptcy.

&gt; otherwise you sound like Russian conspiritards where everything is a U.S plot to hurt and destroy Russia.

the US don't plan to annexate russia. On the other hand, putin would love nothing more than walk as victorious in kiev (that is if half the population wouldn't try to assassinate him there now).

&gt;  everything is ""within the norm"" given low oil prices 

You know the barrel could go back to 35$ , right ?

&gt; and restriction of access to international financial markets.

Which mean basically ""yeah not breathing is normal for a dead patient"".

&gt; but what are the prospects of things turning around and downfall not continuing in lets say 2015?

Bad ,and more bad till at least 2017.

&gt;  How long Ukrainian population are willing to ""endure"" so to speak anyway? 

Probably the duration of the russian invasion then 2/3 more years i suspect.

&gt; They had debts for months of consumption and refused to pay, surely you could understand unwillingness to provide goods for free?

Say, tommorow if the EU collect early their russian bonds (owned throught various holdings and stuff) and Russia default and refuse to pay, then we recover everything they have abroad by force because Russia is unwilling to pay it's debts and then the russian population would starve; what would you say ?
See, it's ""legal"" too. But that's one kind of a shitty move.

&gt; I seriously haven't read anything about Russia blowing up targets on Ukraine controlled territory?

You have heard about how there isn't anymore a luhansk airport; or IIovaisk right ?

&gt; , that freight trains got stuck on the border or something because of undisclosed order from RZD, but things were slowly moving there or something

No they are not. Basically putin cease the whole convoy.

&gt; Honestly, haven't heard much about the issue, but i can see that Russia is in the wrong here.

Yes, stealing billions of dollars of owed coal to cut power to your neighbor is bad. But i think the russian industrials will enjoy even more that nobody will ever deal with them anymore and they're out of the coal business for the entire occident if they don't deliver. Another ruined oligarch that'll love putin.

&gt; And again a notion that everything bad that has happened in Ukraine is Russia's fault, those evil scheming Russkies and their KGB. damn them!

Yes i'm sure the KGB is just a cartoon villain that never did anything wrong and was unfairly feared especially most of it by citizens of the former USSR; for totally no valid reason.

&gt; Price of gaz is an instrument of ""soft power"" in a way

Well then, so are sanctions.

&gt; nor is reliant on Western Exports of agriculture that much and 2 months is enough time to get supplies from other sources

Most of the russian food comes from the EU; and you don't starve because we're smuggling it either way regardless of putin's retarded north-korea-style sanctions because nobody wants a starving russia. And food prices already rose like 20% in some parts i heard, despite alternate supply roads.

&gt; Building gaz transportation systems or capabilities is impossible even in 2 years, beggars can't be choosers in that regard.

Too bad russia can't build an alternate world economy and banking system in 2 years either (the time they have before bankruptcy with current sanctions). Kremlink beggars will have to make a choice too, at some point.

&gt; I was talking not about gas, but about accumulation of ""wealth fund"" sort a like Norway or Russia, for a future prospects of financing modernization program

We have that giant economical fund, it's called the European Union. And they tried to join it.

&gt; bunch of ""front"" companies in a variety of tax havens, building storage facilities across the Europe here and there by different factions, only to be later using those facilities in case of emergency. 

I'm going to give you a tip : It's what we're already doing. But simply put, it's easier for us to have gas just coming out of the pipe without rationing ourselves already; every bits helps. But if it really comes to that, we can power the entire EU and Ukraine without Russia, and still have safety margins. Russia, however, would miss quite a lot of money i suspect.

The bus goes about once an hour. You can get off close to Soto del Real, in Manzanares el Real or further along in Mataelpino. I always see people carrying mats in. You can ""hacer vivac"" there (sleep without a tent in the many protected shelters under rocks). Some of the best spots require heavy-duty hiking, but you can find places on the front (La Pedriza Anterior) that are really fun and closer. 

If you hang out in a climbing gym, you are bound to find other people spend their weekends out in La Pedri--it's totally addictive. Look on meetup and you can also find groups that explore the surrounding area. It's really a rock-lovers paradise.

&gt; either Russian intelligence has a firm grasp on every fucking soldier there and got ridiculously competent in silencing everyone

Or basically just say it's an outrageous lie and yell ""HOAX HOAX"" And repeat loudly on tv WE_WERE_NEVER_AT_WAR_WITH_EUROPA and wait for low attention span people like you to pass to something else while they keep sending in reinforcements 50-100 at a time till it start making huge numbers.

&gt; and their social media accounts

You mean the thousands of soldiers with pictures on their VK like that ?

http://ukraineinvestigation.com/russian-paratroopers-killed-ukrainians-uniform-berkut-photo/

But true now they confiscate phones as a SOP before shipping soldiers in ukraine nowadays. Their opsec increased a bit.

&gt;  outright surrendering and giving out all the heavy weapon arms to ISIS. What a success story that is.

&gt;  They would scream, beat the drums, shout and bang on the window in their attempts to never let the issue ""go away"".

For money ? The EU would offer them to compensate partially to shut up yeah. But that would be it. As opposed for the drum banging they do for russians *tanks* in ukraine, which i think, is justified.

&gt; or try to pressure Russia (or previously mentioned countries) into some form of subjugation/humiliation.

Riiiiiiiiight, because asking russia to remove the red army from ukraine is ""subjugation/humiliation"". Totally.

As for your article at the end :

&gt; The Kremlin claimed Russia 

As usual. Kremlin claims a lot of untrue things.

&gt; Almost half of it was lent by Germany

And if you read a bit between the lines, basically Merkel (who was *very* Russia friendly at the time) decided to wipe out most of their debts she had on them.

&gt; The payment is the latest sign of the country's financial independence, and illustrates how dramatically high oil and gas prices have transformed the country's economy.

On top of the money we gave for gaz without much questions on the prices.

&gt; But now the country - the world's second-biggest oil supplier - is swimming in cash, projecting a budget surplus of $56bn next year.

56$bn is ""swiming in cash"" for a country ? I dunno if the kremlin is that delusionnal but we pay 5x that amount in energy yearly alone just to keep russia afloat not to have to deal with another failed country. If you trust that saying at face value and it's common thinking in russia then you people are kindah ignoring the elephant in the room and are in big economic troubles.

&gt; 
&gt; ... really. :D

Russia had a peacekeeping force in South-Ossetia before 2008 war i believe as a result of a previous war between Georgia and South-Ossetia after the dissolution of Soviet Union. If someone bombards your troops in the region with GRADs as it turns out they might hurt those forces, which are Russian troops stationed in the region for 2 decades. So, who is in the wrong here exactly, peacekeepers being shelled? 


&gt;The hard issue with yanoukovich is he voluntarily blurred the line between his personnal wealth and the state's. But basically they already found like dozens of billions of money country-wide from his entire gov apparatus. That include cold hard cash, gold, goods of ridiculous value (like his gold plated boat); misattributed contracts to every single of his buddies, institutionnal corruption in several branches like public services, the cops, justice, ....


Is this why they are broke and have 10 billion$ of reserves? They found dozens of billions in cash and looted away, but at the same time have no money at all. How come? 


&gt;They blackmailed russia with... themselves ? LOL. That doesn't even make sense.


They blackmailed Russia that they will throw it out of Crimean and Sevastopol naval bases or refuse or redraw the treaty of the lease. Has done so plenty of times and the issue always surfaced during any gas negotiations. 


&gt;After russia cut them for fictive debts backed by artificially inflated prices just to punish them for the orange revolution.


Beggars can't be choosers, Ukraine went with its Orange revolution being heavily reliant on Russian energy supplies, they tried whole ""Baltics"" approach of lets piss off Russia as much as possible, they got the same treatment Baltics or Poles got, increase in gas price. Anyway, isn't this a good thing anyway, since you said that Russia controlled Ukraine with cheap gas prices, so the spike in the price, should help Ukrainian economy to become more competitive and technologically advanced (+ lessen the dependence on Russian energy supplies), no? Choose something, either high gas prices are good or bad, otherwise whatever move Russia makes, its always in the wrong.


&gt;Actually i'm pointing out PAST responsability. The current ones will have little excuse if they screw up their own part of course.


Russia controlled Ukraine for 20 years according to you, interesting, since from my perspective it never looked that way. But i guess it falls nicely into the notion of ""everything bad that has happened previously in Ukraine and with Ukrainians is Evil Russia's fault, but **now** we are going to live like the kings!"" I am sure this is a predominant viewpoint among Ukrainians themselves given the state of their media (just like Russian everything is U.S/West fault).


&gt;You know the barrel could go back to 35$ , right ?


Not for long it won't, price range of 55 to 65 could hold for about half a year, maaaybe a year, then it will steadily climb to 80-85$ a barrel. Too much money and special interest involved in the energy sector, to let it be that way for significant amount of time. Unless of course we will have another Global Financial Crisis, but in this case something tells me no one will give a shit about Ukraine. 


&gt;Probably the duration of the russian invasion then 2/3 more years i suspect.


Optimistic, in my opinion, but i guess Ukrainians themselves will prove which one of us is more accurate in our predictions :) 


&gt;Say, tommorow if the EU collect early their russian bonds (owned throught various holdings and stuff) and Russia default and refuse to pay, then we recover everything they have abroad by force because Russia is unwilling to pay it's debts and then the russian population would starve; what would you say ? See, it's ""legal"" too. But that's one kind of a shitty move.


There is a sovereign debt and corporate debt, admittedly majority of Russian corporations has Government controlling 50% of it or more. But in terms of international law, Russian sovereign debt is fairly low in comparison to corporate one and in case you decide to ""fasten the process"", Russia can declare a moratorium on payments sort a like Malaysia (if i remember correctly, perhaps it was Singapore) did. Russia can also start a legal process blaming sanctions for inability to refinance or pay back loans immediately as one of the clauses (i am not expert in international law, i am sure there are plenty of bullshit excuses to delay the payments, to mitigate some of the damage). + Russia still has National Fund reserves, at least it used to :) 


&gt;You have heard about how there isn't anymore a luhansk airport; or IIovaisk right ?


I haven't heard about Russia blowing up power plants on Ukrainian territory to throw Ukraine into stone age, not about the constant fighting in the airports. As far as i know, airports do not generate neither heat nor electricity.


&gt;I'm going to give you a tip : It's what we're already doing.

Oh they can. But a badly led default with no backing from external political power will further isolate them. Nothing prevents north korea from defaulting on their debts. Apart that they won't be able to loan again enough money to get enough food if they do that.

Uh, no, it isn't. Maybe you need more clarification on the matter.

See, when there is a word lacking definition, *you don't pull a new definition out of your ass*. There are a variety of options on what one can do to correctly set things straight with the undefined word; I'll give you three of them.

One option is to take several different variations of the word, find a common theme, and use said theme as the definition. Odds are, that was the original idea that became lost to time as different versions of the word began to crop up.

Another possibility is to take the variations of the word and to set them as different and distinct words themselves. For example, let us suggest that the word ""platform"" has no clear-cut meaning, and George and Thomas have their own separate ideas on what it means, with no common theme to use for the original word. If we decide to use this option instead, the opposing ideas would become ""Georgian platform"" and ""Thomasist platform"", respectfully.

A third way is to *look up the damn definition*. You yourself threw the Wikipedia page on democratic socialism into one of your replies, yet you forgot to examine the very first sentence on said page: [""Democratic socialism is a political ideology advocating a democratic political system alongside a socialist economic system.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism)

Now, let us take your example from earlier--Germany--and see if it has any traces of socialism. If you aren't aware, socialism happens to be democratic control of the means of production. Do the workers and labourers of Germany have direct democratic control over their workplaces? Their prices? Their economy?

No. They don't. Instead, the German economy is dictated by market prices, set by investors and CEOs who own and have others operate the means of production. In other words, Germany's economy is based on private ownership of the means of production, aka [capitalism.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism)",0,1418012403,null,0,false,0,cmofvbt,t3_2oizs8,t1_cmofvbt,t1_cmo5id6,null,1425547692,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I know, but what about his children? Their children? At what point do they become ethnically German?

&gt;Ethnicity is genetic. Two people within an ethnic group are more related than two people from different ethnic groups. You can actually analyze genetic groups to identify genetic clusters.

Okay, but I fail to see what significant role that plays in anything. My parents are more genetically different than the average north Indian and the average Irishman; what does that make me, ethnically? The genetic model falls flat when you account for interbreeding.

&gt;Yes, actually, the English are a subgroup of the Germanic people.

That is a linguistic marker in this context, not an ethnic marker. I don't think too many people would consider a Norwegian ethnically English, or an Englishman ethnically German, despite all being Germanic people.

&gt;Celtic immigration to the British isles was certainly significant but Germanic immigration outpaced it after the 1000s in England specifically. 

Perhaps, but 6 million people with &gt;25% Irish ancestry is certainly not an insignificant figure. 25% of the United Kingdom has at least *some* Irish ancestry. For the last century or so, the Irish have certainly been the largest immigrant group in the UK. How many generations of interbreeding before you'd consider them ethnically English?

&gt;The people of Alsace-Lorraine are definitely German. For example, Antoine Griezmann. ""His ancestry is Alsatian, hence the German surname."" He is culturally French but ethnically German.

And that's exactly what I'm saying! You're proving my point - ethnicity has little to do with national borders. If Germany is to be a home for ethnic Germans, and France for ethnic Frenchmen, wouldn't that imply that Alsace-Lorraine ought to belong to Germany? You were correct when you said ""he is culturally French"" - *that* is what matters, not something as dubious as ethnicity.

&gt;""British"" is a cultural demonym not an ethnic one.

You're right, I meant English.

I was mainly talking about her pushing everyone for austerity while not practicing it in Germany and her general attitude of telling people what to do. 

Sure the countries should be run as efficiently as possible but cutting on welfare for everyone just scares people into not buying things and people buying things is what our economies are based on. Sure you'll get nice figures the first few years but in the end you will have people giving up things they will never see again (let's be honest, even if things do get better which is not even sure, what is lost will never be put back Cameron has been pretty clear on that) and no guaranteed success at all.

I very much disagree with your assessment of the United States economic recovery. Unemployment has precipitously fallen since the height of the recession and has down so at a greater rate than most of the EU^1,2. The reason this is important is perhaps the most important indicator of economic recovery is the the strong and statistically robust relationship between economic growth and unemployment^3,4. Furthermore, changes in wages tend to lag changes in unemployment. Thus, wages will not start to grow until there is very little ""slack"" in the labor market^5. So wages should start increasing soon if we're nearing full potential. 

This is not to say that US economy is home free which I believe Krugman would be the first to agree with such a statement. For example, I am concerned about international markets such as the EU, Russia and Japan triggering another recession. The U.S. also faces several long term problems. There is $1.2 Trillion in student debt. Labor Force participation continues to decline like all aging societies. Perhaps most importantly, inequality is still rising in the United States and its fundamental causes don't seem to be changing. 

However, the article (like most of Krugman's journalism pieces) is about if stimulative fiscal and monetary policy can decrease unemployment and return an economy to full potential after a recession. The preponderance of economic evidence says yes and that the eurozone should pay attention to these policy implications.

On my 2004-05 deployment, I was really unimpressed with the professionalism of the German Navy.

Yes, definitely. Kretschmann in Baden-Württemberg is probably the best example for that.

Me, too, but with a small asterisk. It depends on the coalition. I don't want the Left as a part of the coalition, and I really don't see how it would be possible to have an SPD chancellor without them in the foreseeable future.

Generally, the entire coalition situation has me worried. If the AfD manages to establish itself above 5%, then it will always be CDU/CSU + X, where X will almost always be SPD as the junior partner. CDU/CSU + Greens is an interesting possibility, though, and one I'd like to see because I don't want SPD + Greens + Left and I don't think an eternal CDU/CSU + SPD coalition is good for the country, either.",0,1418023290,null,0,false,0,cmojz0j,t3_2ok3xc,t1_cmojz0j,t1_cmo87vd,null,1425545778,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4
false,20b812c,null,null,"&gt; I was asking you for a definition

Am I supposed to define your argument? You claimed socialized production is better than capitalist production. I was asking why that is. One cannot respond to an argument until one actually knows what that argument is.

&gt;  It's doing massive damage to the environment.

Ok, now tell me how socialized food production improves this situation.

&gt; Because as a farmer today, with no subsidies, you go bankrupt after a single bad harvest.

Perhaps, but the land doesn't go anywhere. The land is sold in the event of a bankruptcy. I understand that this might not be ideal for the farmer going out of business, but it's hardly an argument against privately-owned farms. In fact, it's the exact manner in which competition in the market place is supposed to happen.

&gt; Well, the vast majority of property is inherited or bought, not built.

1) Buying = building in this context. Most homeowners don't actually build their homes themselves. They pay for someone to do it. According to your argument, that means they don't own their home, the builders do. In fact, none of the individual builders own it. The timbers owns the portion of the frame they personally set up, the glaziers own the the windows (and seeing that installing a window takes two people, apparently the glaziers co-own the windows?), the electricians own the wiring, etc. If you define ownership as only what you physically, personally do, ownership is not even possible.

2) Let's assume you *do* accept some definition of ownership. Are you allowed to sell what you own? Are you allowed to donate what you own? If you can do any of these, why aren't you allowed to give your property to your relatives?

&gt;  Meanwhile, every single person on the planet needs shelter. Land is a prerequisite for shelter. Why should two babies born to different families have different access to shelter over the course of their lifetimes?

Because we live in a finite world. I know that's cruel, but it's a fundamental fact of reality.

&gt; Then I don't think you've considered the end-game. What happens when literally every square centimeter of the Earth is owned by someone else, and you are born into circumstances that don't leave you with any prospect of achieving land ownership within that system?

That's not an end-game. That's the current state of affairs. But people still sell and buy land. It's not a zero-sum game.

&gt; Massive amounts of people in the developed world only have access to extremely unhealthy food, and even larger amounts of people have access to healthy food, but do not have the time in the day to cook fresh meals. For a lot of people, it's not a real ""choice"".

No, it is a choice. It might be an inconvenient choice, but it's a choice. And I still fail to see how socialized production helps with this.

Do you see how we're wandering around in murky tangents? All this started because you claimed socialized food production is better than capitalist food production.

false,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"&gt; I've always been interested in German culture

Well, what do you understand by ""German culture""? If it's lederhosen, dirndls, polka music and beer, that's a ridiculous stereotype. Regardless, being ""interested in the culture"" is never a good reason to move.

&gt; How would one go about getting visa?

Contact the German embassy, or your nearest German consulate. It will probably have this information on its website. Your best shot is to first get yourself lined up with a binding job offer that commands a salary at least 50% higher than the average gross salary; you'll then qualify for a ""Blue Card"", which works like a long-term work permit.

&gt; how much different are the laws in germany compared to the US?

In Germany, the constitutional right to privacy often trumps the right to free speech. Certain political activities are banned. Consumer protection laws are more robust. Tenants enjoy some terrific rights, but this means that landlords are highly selective so it's much harder to find an apartment. You can't be evicted instantly (except in very unusual circumstances), but neither can you terminate your contract instantly. Same goes for jobs: you can't normally be fired instantly, but neither can you quit instantly. Gun laws are very strict; realistically, no guns, period. No hunting without a permit either. Never, ever take roadkill home with you; and if you run over anything larger than, say, a badger, inform the police or at least the local huntsman. Children *must* attend school; if you want to homeschool them, that has to be in addition to their attendance at state or state-approved school. Never film or photograph anyone without their knowledge, even on your own property. Always keep the noise down, especially at night, just after lunch, and all day Sundays and public holidays -- don't even think about mowing the lawn at these times. You must always have valid government ID (your passport will be fine); you don't *have* to take it with you everywhere you go, but it's advisable. Most stores must remain closed on Sundays and public holidays, and in most places stores usually close around 8pm every evening. You are required to register your address with the local authorities.

This barely scratches the surface. What you'll find is that while on the surface things don't seem too different, it's the little things that will trip you up; things you can't imagine could be done differently from what you're used to will be done differently. You will have many rights you're not used to having, but equally things you consider rights may be outlawed here.

&gt; Americans are usually pretty openly welcomed, right?

Well, generally speaking, Germans don't hate Americans just because they're American. However, some of the cultural attitudes Americans have rub Germans up the wrong way. You will need to adjust to the German mindset: if you expect them to adjust to yours, they won't want to have anything to do with you.

&gt; do you think an American ran business would be recieved well in germany?

Don't even think of starting a business in Germany until you understand the laws, regulations and culture. Wal-Mart failed miserably in Germany, partly because they continued with practices that are illegal in Germany (especially concerning things like pay and conditions), and partly because they didn't understand that the German shopping experience is very different.

false,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"It works a bit differently over here, because we have a system of proportional representation (actually, we have mixed member proportional representation, which is... no, let's just leave it at proportional representation) and the Bundestag (lower house, think House of Representatives) then elects the chancellor.  

So, we vote for a party. Parties internally agree on two important documents: The party program, which is a catalogue of where they stand on various policy issues and their general guiding principles, sort of their long term goals for how the state and society should work, and the election program where they lay out what they hope to achieve during the next term.

It's close to impossible for a single party to hold the majority on its own, they almost always need to form a coalition between 2+ parties. So, after the election, parties try to negotiate amongst each other to form a governing coalition, which is based on compromises and policy goals they have agreed on during those negotiations and written down as a coalition contract. Apart from day to day policy issues and events that come up during the term, this contract forms the basis of all major policies and any reform they intend to approach before the next election.

While the leading candidate for chancellor is of course an important factor for many, more people base their decision on the party programs rather than ""I like that candidate"". And then there are ""tactical voters"" (that's me), who don't necessarily go by the party programs, but base their decision on the likeliness of various coalitions to occur and what they might negotiate amongst each other.  
For example, supporters of the CDU might vote for the FDP to help them over the 5% hurdle they need to pass in order to gain any seats in the Bundestag, to make them available for a coalition that would let the CDU get more of its goals into the contract than they would with the much stronger SPD. Or one might vote for the Greens in order to make an SPD-Green coalition more likely than a CDU-SPD one, that would be dominated by the CDU, even though they might not agree with all of the Greens' policy goals. They just assume that those more radical positions wouldn't fly in a coalition anyway. Or they might vote for SPD, even if they'd like to see a the CDU candidate become chancellor, to strengthen the left or centrist leaning side in a CDU-SPD coalition.

In reality, of course, there hardly are any ""pure"" voter decisions, it's almost always a combination between candidate, program and tactics. ",0,1418025580,null,0,false,0,cmoklpd,t3_2ok3xc,t1_cmoklpd,t1_cmo5b0x,null,1425545485,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

There has been some switch from one Soviet state to the other and after the collapse they happened to be different countries. Thats why the Ukraine rented the area to the Russians, to not to disturb the geopolitical situation.

Then the Ukraine had a change in leadership (which might or might not have been a coup) and the Crimea was suddenly in danger of falling under NATO jurisdiction, endangering said geopolitical structures which existed since the cold war.

Last time Russia faced United Europe, coincidentally under German leadership, it lost at least 10% of its population and was crippled for generations to come. The memory of this war still lives in mind of every Russian and the idea of ""never again"" is very much alive, meaning we will drag you with us to hell if we were to perish in flames of history. Keep that mind if you are calculating that Russia will stick to conventional means in case of war with NATO/Europe, it won't.

I have always found this aspect of Russian culture fascinating, other than the Mongols, the Russians have almost no perspective on how it is to be subjugated or be destroyed - except for WW2, which kindled the flames for Russians to do exactly the same thing to other nations (which stopped in 1991 due to the dissolution of the Soviet state). I mean - is the everyday Russian willing to drag the world to hell if Russia falls, but is happy and willing to see other nations fall UNDER Russia?

Scandinavian Airlines published in its in-flight magazine an article which would have been uncontroversial in Sweden, but which graphed the history of the far right in Scandinavia, which saw Vidkun Quisling, the leader of the Norwegian National Socialists, on a timeline with the Progress Party. This lead the Progress Party to decry it as ""disgusting"", and caused a high-ranking party member, founder and former leader to issue a barely-veiled threat against state-owned SAS that it was ""unwise"" to attack the Progress Party now that they had control of the ministry of finance. The deputy leader said that he himself would change his bookings from the union-busting Norwegian Airlines to SAS, to ""personally confirm the magazines had been removed from seats"".

I am not in itself primarily concerned by the uproar reaction from the (ironically named) Progress Party - their crying like a baby at any undesirable coverage is a cliché by now - nor am I concerned with the airline for retracting it; in-flight magazines are not typically a place you expect what is in Norway politically controversial material, and who really expects an airline to stand up for this?

My concern is that they went to the step of actively threatening retaliations, and the rest of our press has taken to self-censorship of criticism of the Progress Party to the extent that after they have been quoted as threatening to use the state treasury as a party-political retaliatory tool against a state-owned airline, nobody in the press has reacted. This would be a political scandal where heads would roll if any other party had said something so authoritarian, but there's not a whisper. The silence is deafening, and petrifying by its implications.

As a member of the social-democratic Labour party and survivor of the Labour Youth massacre on Utøya at the hands of a former member of the Progress Party, I have watched with increasing dismay and disgust the complete absence of any willingness or ability to confront far-right terrorism and hatred in our country. Yesterday I reluctantly came to the conclusion that we simply don't have a functioning free press anymore, and I feel as if my country in reality no longer is functional as a free, democratic nation.

In School, we learn that f is [f] and w is [v], which is mostly, but not always true (e.g. höflich, from ""Hof""), and v can be either.

There's not always a difference between [f] and [v] in German. In ""wollen"" vs. ""vollen"" (*definitely* spoken with [f]) there is, sometimes there's not. It is, indeed, a mess.

&gt;Der Begriff Wutbürger wurde in den Duden aufgenommen, der ihn als „Zeitungsjargon“ für einen „aus Enttäuschung über bestimmte politische Entscheidungen sehr heftig öffentlich protestierende[n] und demonstrierende[n] Bürger“ definiert. [wikipedia](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wutb%C3%BCrger)

Es ist sogar Wort des Jahres 2010. 

Propagandisten sind Pesonen, die versuchen, systematisch eine öffentliche politische Sichtweise zu formen. Das sind hier augenscheinlich die Veranstalter der Pegida, die gezielt politische Belange (u.a. Islamisierung Deutschlands) propagieren.

Und das bringt mich zum nächsten Punkt. Ich unterstelle hier mal, dass Du die FAZ oder die Medien mit ""Progagandisten"" meintest)? Natürlich hat FAZ eine politische Färbung. Allerdings werden dort Kommentare - also Meinungen des Verfassers - als solche gekennzeichnet und nicht als Fakt oder Wahrheit verkauft, wie das z.B. bei Pegida der Fall ist. Wo sind zum Beispiel die Fakten dafür, dass das Geld, welches Asylanten zukommt, das Geld ist, welches den Sozialhilfeempfängern vermeintlich fehlt? Kein Beweis.

Für mich ist Pegida gefährliche politische Propaganda, welche mit der prekären sozialen Situation von Menschen spielt und gezielt Angst bündelt, die sich dann gegen Teile unserer Bevölkerung richten könnte. Und das ist meine Meinung.

false,mkvgtired,null,null,"It also creates an incentive not to invest because holding cash becomes a productive investment. If a business takes a loan it will have to pay back more in real productivity, plus interest, making the loan more expensive in real terms. So if a business would like to expand it will have to take into consideration the cost of spending its cash (and losing future value) and any interest cost on top of that. Many projects that would typically be profitable become unprofitable because it is better to hold cash. 

Also, because the real value of debt increases debtors spend less. This is not offset by increased spending by creditors though due to the fact holding cash is a worth while investment so there is an incentive for them to hold it. This effect coupled with the incentive for businesses not to invest can increase deflation. Because wages do not correct downward very easily, workers are often laid off instead of having their collective wages cut. This is coupled with the fact workers will be laid off due to the fact businesses are hoarding cash instead of expanding. The working population's aggregate purchasing power falls, causing prices to fall further. All these effects reinforce and perpetuate each other which is often why it is referred to as the ""deflationary spiral"", and why it is so hard to reverse.

* Krugman has railed against the popularly-held austerity paradigm that has utterly drained the life out of the EU economy, something that is still very anemic (with record-high unemployment in Spain, Greece, and Cyprus).

* He claimed that the main reason that investors were making a run on the Eurozone periphery countries (that is, bond prices) was due to the fact that there was no ""lender of last resort"" in the Eurozone - this run was halted when Mario Draghi de facto implemented this in the ECB by stating that the ECB would do ""whatever was necessary"" to support the Eurozone periphery countries.

* Krugman argued that Japan needed to induce inflationary measures to get its economy out of its deflation spiral (i.e. encourage consumption in the economy); when Abe was most recently elected, he did just that, and the Japanese economy started to turn around. Now, that economy has sputtered to a halt, and people are pointing to this as a sign that Krugman's advice was wrong; what they probably don't realize (or chose to ignore) is that Abe decided to raise the sales tax (which Krugman implored that they refrain from doing), and this threw the Japanese economy back into a tailspin.
