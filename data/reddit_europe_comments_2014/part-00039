Yes - but not any state. A worker's state, i.e. USSR (or a more idealised equivalent). Keynesianism is not socialism - I think the term social-democratic describes these countries better, as does US under the new deal. 

&gt; The rising cost of health insurance premiums, which pose a burden for the employer and employee, are causing wage stagnation. 

This is part of the free market deal. In terms of products/services that can be afforded the inequality is rapidly rising. It's the same healthcare you were getting 30 years ago.  Note that a two fold increase in food prices/healthcare is nothing for top 20%, but it might mean starvation for the bottom 10%.

Are you talking about healthcare costs? Before medicare/medicaid, the US had some of the best care for the best cost. Why? [Because people payed out of pocket, and not through insurance](http://www.chcf.org/publications/2013/09/data-viz-hcc-national). Employer sponsored insurance initially sprouted out of the ww2 regulated economy; the government set wage and price controls, causing employers to start shifting to it. It was also made tax exempted(and still is). Medicare/medicaid, [due to the fact that it underpays](http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/index.php/2013/05/the-dramatic-difference-what-a-hospital-charges-vs-what-medicare-pays/), caused a major systematic disruption to healthcare, causing costs to skyrocket. Before medicare/medicaid [health care prices were never above inflation](http://bastiat.mises.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/holly1.jpg). Afterwards prices exploded. Following this there were more wage+price controls in the early 1970s(Nixon took the us dollar off gold because of a very bad negative balance of payments due to the Vietnam War). This caused an ever greater shift towards employer sponsored health insurance. He then passed the HMO act, which had the government encourage this kind of shift, in the form of HMOs.

&gt;It's the same healthcare you were getting 30 years ago.

[No?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_medicine_and_medical_technology#1900.E2.80.931999). Medical technology is constantly evolving and advancing. 

&gt;Note that a two fold increase in food prices/healthcare is nothing for top 20%, but it might mean starvation for the bottom 10%.

[Food has greatly dropped in price](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2011/03/images/helbling2.gif). Americans at least spend about 7% of their income on food, which is [one of the lowest rates of any country](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2013/03/blogs/graphic-detail/20130316_gdc223.png). 

&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/business/the-middle-class-is-steadily-eroding-just-ask-the-business-world.html?_r=0

Now I don't disagree with their assertion on wages leading to lower personal consumption expenditures, it's probably due partially to health insurance premiums. [But the consumption poverty rate is very low, and was about 0% in 2007 and is pretty low overall.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/09/21/the-correct-us-poverty-rate-is-around-and-about-zero/). Still scary how bad things are economically, especially for Europe. 

&gt;It's pretty obvious in a lot of cycles what is going on (and the trend can only continue), but unless there is massive state intervention the trend is going to continue. Unlike the 1930s there is no global war looming over humanity (as the prospect of one would mean the annihilation of the species), labour unions are pretty much dead (union membership worldwide is at historical lows) and the 1% is ruling in the name of the 20%. You can't have 1/5th societies, it's a volatile mixture.

Considering that the worst economies are the ones with more state intervention, I wouldn't want that to happen. I wish unions in the UK+US were more like those in Germany. Where they actually want to add value to labour and help the corporation profit, instead of fighting it tooth and nail([ordoliberalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordoliberalism), while it may seem rather proto social democratic, its founder had close connections with Ludwig Von Mises, an austrian free market economist. The SPD in Germany has moved further to the right since its creation). (They've had such a bad name for conservatives in the UK since Thatcher I imagine, considering all the workdays lost as manufacturing was self-destructing and they refused to adapt to an increasingly service-sector economy).

&gt;what the..? Never heard of them, to be honest. Sounds like a bunch of idiots.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Party_%28United_States%29 

They're not so overtly racist anymore, but they're still very much anti-immigration, pro white protestant Christianity and they came close to gaining the highest seat in Colorado, which for a third party is no small feat and would have sent ripples through the country.

&gt;I just had my professor talk about the other day. There is an ""unexplained rest"" of the difference in pay between men and women amounting to 1,27â¬ per hour. This is the actual gender pay gap. These numbers are from the statistical office of Germany.

It's interesting because the pay gap here in the US is almost entirely due to the fact that men often take more dangerous and higher paying jobs, so the actual reality is a lot more gray than American feminist present it as.

&gt;Not really. There has been a huge wave of feminism but I feel as if the society is shifting to an anti-egalitarian perspective. Many young people, even women, are opposed to gender equality because it inflicts with their view of a perfect family. Many are thinking of being oppressed by political correctedness and try to break through imagined borders. If you're expressing what you have always heard and said, you're not breaking borders.

Germany has this whole family values (which aren't even real family values) bullshit?

&gt;I don't really have a scale here, but I think the racism in Germany is hidden behind curtain of education and good manners. But the thinking of ""them"" as foreign and scary is still here and deeply rooted. In the US however I think that racism is much more of a public issue, as there are more PoC who actually will speak up and are visible on the streets. Can't stress this enough: There are just few PoC here.

Except for naked turkish women ;)

&gt;Well I guess if you put the US and EU side by side there are some social services etc here that are not enabled in the US (Until recently health care for everyone for example :P). But on migration policies there aren't that much differences I fear. 

Probably, you guys have Die Linke after all.  But I would correct you on the claim we have universal health care.  We don't and won't (on a national scale anyway) anytime soon.  Obamacare for example isn't universal health care, it's just forcing citizens to buy private insurance.

Hitler managed to begin the Soviet campaign before Stalin managed to launch his European second campaign, Stalin was hoping for Hitler to commit to operation Sea lion(invasion of Great Britain) and then take out Europe with ease as most troops and material would then be stationed/tied up in GB.

The Soviet Union had in excess of 35000 tanks stationed towards the border to Nazi Germany, this is such an immense number nobody would have thought possible at that time.

It was also clear from Molotov and the prior invasions of Finland/Baltic states etc. that the Soviets were continuously inching towards Germany to close any buffer zones and other strategic areas prior to the main thrust, a defensive power doesn't do this, a defensive power wants buffer zones.


This is partly why the Soviet forces were so easily routed in Operation Barbarossa, they were not defensive forces as such, they were inactive offensive forces, recklessly packed and vulnerable, simply waiting for the order to invade further into Europe.

----

&gt;Oh, and I have read everything from Keynes to monetarists like Milton Friedman to motherfucking Krugman.


I'm calling bullshit. Complete bullshit. At best you've read some essays on Mises.org, a few vid-blog posts about Keynes by some right-wing YouTuber, then a critique against Krugman posted on Reason.

You don't even know what the term ""capitalism"" means. Everything you've posted so far about economics can be torn apart by a 14 year old with a copy of ""economics for dummies"".

Even so, your ignorance is not the subject here. 

-----

Cronyism is just the inevitable end result of capitalism. You cannot expect to enforce private property rights on the behalf of property owners then expect those property owners to just pass up the best advantages they can attain to maximize their property investments. 

Without the state, you don't have private property rights, and therefore no capitalism. In order to have capitalism, you require the state (otherwise, no private property rights), which means you *will* have cronyism as the state is the best advantage available in order to compete. 

It's like throwing a bunch of kids in a white room with boxes of crayons, buckets of paint, and paintball guns, tell them that in order to get out they have to cover each other in color... then expecting them to keep the whole room spotlessly clean in the process. It isn't going to happen!

So not only are you incredibly uneducated while simultaneously making completely bullshit claims about your educational background because you're on the internet and can claim anything about yourself, you are also incredibly naive about the very systems you are railing against. 

Crony capitalism *is* capitalism perfected. Cronies are just better at capitalism than you. They use every advantage at their disposal, they outcompete everyone else because they are willing to cheat. They're just better than you and it drives you ""Free market"" capitalists insane. (I use quotation marks on purpose, you're not for truly free markets which can only exist sans private property rights)

For me, and most other anarcho-capitalists and libertarians and neo-liberals I suppose, free markets and capitalism is interchangeable. They mean the same thing. Free trade is how capitalism functions under this framework. You're right about the ownership, but that's the thing about political philosophies, the same words gain different meaning. Now, some socialists, some I've even spoken to today, wouldn't consider it immoral to kill me. I stand in the way of progress you see. This is a similar discrepancy in our philosophies. The same happens with coercion, aggression and a whole load of other words. Learning is fun, huh!?

Some great rebuttals otherwise though. Ranging from nu-uh's to, ""here's a statement, I don't need to back up this statement with actual arguments, because I am the arbiter of truth.""

What now?  
  
&gt;Our banking sector only brings 10% of the bacon home.  
  
Who'd ever know? There's literally no index banks haven't tampered with, diluted or built on a pyramid. The last swiss-bank scandal I can think of is [Julius Baer vs. Wikileaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Julius_Baer_vs._Wikileaks_lawsuit) and if you look at the bookmaking, where would these number show up, the tax-report? Surely. But that doesn't even begin to cover the consequences that are systemic, meaning intended or condoned. Be that as it may furthermore the fact that rich people can park their shady money there has power political consequences far beyond 10% of the GDP, also, it ignores all history of how you'd even get to such a point. I mean who really started that great tradition and then everybody kind of went from there? At some point you of course have another infrastructure supporting a new and better kind of economy, but that came from one place and let's face it, what is Switzerland from a global standpoint, that spot in the midst of Europe, what's the big interest? Your money is secure there, it's very stable, whatever you do and make money of, you get it there, it's done, if you're a warlord, tax-cheater or whatnot, those are clean assets after that. Not clean-clean, but you're not dirty until somebody can prove where the money came from and that it's yours and this is really hard, last but not least thanks to the Swiss legislation. 
  
So, why 4tn?

from [Site](http://taxjustice.blogspot.ch/2012/07/the-price-of-offshore-revisited-and.html)
  
The three Swiss banks I found in the top 20 manage about $2.5tn alone (Credit, UBS and Baer), there a more down the top 50, though, I couldn't identify all of them, but there are some, the top 50 manage ~12tn offshore accounts between them, the estimates for the world vary from [$20tn](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/21/global-elite-tax-offshore-economy) to [~$30tn](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/08/pirate-banking-21-to-32-trillion-in-estimated-tax-haven-money-managed-by-big-global-banks.html).  
  
To find another trillion in Switzerland in between the ~$3tn they have in the top 50 is conservative enough, I think, besides these numbers always tend to be worse than reported, it seems that comes with the profession.  
  
If you think the banking business in Switzerland has an impact proportional to 10% of the GDP as if it would be any other business, that's some self-serving ignorance.

The history of unions is slightly different. German unions were really strong (they had a saying on the board of directors) etc.  There were lot's of agreements that were not quite right (e.g. the status of foreign workers etc), but the german worker had it good until early 90s. Since then the increases in productivity had gone mostly to capital, with the state effectively subsidising production.

That's the starting point.

I hope he knows at least the date of birth of the mother...

Does he know the birthplace of the mother?

If yes, in that Comune (municipality) there has to be some paper trail. He can try and write them (Ufficio Anagrafe , i.e.registry office, or Stato Civile) and ask. Most Comuni accept similar requests by mail.

There are two documents that he could ask and that might help:

* Certificato di Nascita: Certificate of birth
* Certificato Storico di residenza historical certificate of residence (showing not the current situation but the evolution over time)

From the latter, he should be able to know if/when she migrated in another Comune. He can then write to the next one etc.

If the marriage took place, it must be recorded in one of these registries. Even if they married in a church, almost always a marriage in church is also written down in the Comune. Unless they specifically requested a ""religious only"" marriage(which isn't a marriage according to the State)

If he does not have the birthplace of the mother, it's going to be harder. One should theorically write to all the Comuni of the Regione Piemonte (Piedmont). Alas, for historical reasons Piemonte has VERY small Comuni, so  there are a lot of them. (All Italy has 8.090 Comuni, Piemonte alone  has 1206 of them!)  

Writing to all of them might be impossible, but from your description ""mountains of Turin"" you could cut the number down.  Or perhaps he could TRY and email them. Officially this could migth not work (i.e. they don't have the legal duty to answer) but if he encloses some details (I am the Z Y, son of X Y born on nn/nn/nnnn and I would like to know if she was born in your Comune) they might answer, just of kindness. After all, if you are an employee of a registry office and you get an enquiry by a guy who does not even know where his mom was born .... that should pick your curiosity!

Here's the list of the Comuni of Piemonte: http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categoria:Comuni_del_Piemonte

He can follow each one, get the link to the official site, and get to email contact for the Ufficio Anagrafe or Stato Civile

He'll have to write in Italian, though!

best luck

if you look at http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?229138-Taxing-the-Rich/page2
you'll find a commentary by one Avram from Jan 2008 say includes:


&gt;But between 1950 and 1976, Sweden experienced an expansion in government spending unprecedented during a period of peace, with government spending to GDP rising from about 20% in 1950 to more than 50% in 1975. Virtually every year, taxes were increased while the welfare state expanded relentlessly, both in the form of a sharp increase in the number of government employees and ever more transfer payment benefits.
&gt;During the first 20 years, this relentless government expansion took place seemingly without ill effect, as Sweden benefited from rapid global growth â although Sweden's growth had already started to slip in relative terms, from well above average to just average. This changed in the 1970s after Olof Palme, from the left wing of the Social Democratic party became Prime Minister. Palme stepped up the socialist transformation in Sweden, rapidly increasing anti-business regulations and sharply increased payroll taxes.

&gt;The payroll-tax increases, along with increasing wage demands from unions, made Swedish businesses highly uncompetitive on the global markets, something which Palme decided to solve by devaluing the Swedish krona. As a result, price inflation rose sharply, leading to repeated devaluations. Popular discontent from the economic woes created by the global economic downturn, the massive tax increases, the increased regulations, and the increasing inflation enabled the center right to come into power in 1976, breaking 44 years of uninterrupted Social Democratic rule.

They seem to have their shit together more than most national governments and parliaments.

P.S. And lets start reducing the number of embassies we have around the world as well. Not all at once but here's an idea.

- countries that are friendly and confident in an identical foreign policy could join their embassies around the world, together. In a single building and united, single staff.

I'm thinking, we could start with:

- the Baltic states.

- the Nordic states.

- the German speaking states

... and so on.

Until in about a decade or so we can be left with just EU embassies which would have, within the same building, ""a Nordic office, a Baltic office, a French language office, a German language office etc...""

It's not just with the military, there are huge and similar bribes and worthless junk bought in areas such as electronics systems, airports, road building, oil illegal trade, military of course etc.

And then you have to add to that the many other facts of this bankruptcy, such as bloated public sector of political party loyalists, (not so much in size as the narrative goes, but in quality and salaries compared to Greek average), again Greek political party members' and politicians' corruption who looted and raided most EU loans and funds, tax-evasion of the mega-rich and accounts of untaxed billions in tax havens such as Switzerland or off shore accounts,  etc.

Per favore non usare questi termini, c'e' gente che e' stata messa al muro per molto meno.

Comunque, questo passaggio mi ha colpito... negativamente.

&gt;  Allo stesso tempo la sovra-abbondanza di informazioni lascia spazio al genio creativo di ognuno e libera il respiro al pensiero critico del target stesso. La figura del giornalista perde di autorevolezza e dignitÃ  rispetto ai mille blog specializzati in cui ognuno puÃ² impugnare la penna digitale e farsi 'Blogger', senza aver seguito un particolare percorso di studi.

Niente affatto. La sovrabbondanza e l'estrema facilita' di diffusione delle informazioni ha creato un mare di contenuti-spazzatura, nel quale e' sempre piu' difficile per i meno avveduti distinguere il vero dal falso, l'opinione personale dal fatto.

Lungi dal liberare il pensiero critico, questo ha provocato il fiorire di 'idee' (in senso lato) e concetti bizzarri e strampalati, dalle scie chimiche agli Illuminati, concetti che solo qualche anno fa non avrebbero potuto diffondersi semplicemente per non aver gambe su cui camminare.

Inoltre, la rete tende a creare una pericolosa ""illusione di conoscenza""; non basta frequentare un sito web di medicina per diventare medico, come non basta abbonarsi all'Economist per diventare economista.. 

La conscenza, se ha valore, costa studio e fatica - non solo un click del mouse.


Certo,  la rete e' anche una fenomenale opportunita', ma - purtroppo - non certo per la maggioranza degli utenti; e' piu' popolare Facebook di [OYC](http://oyc.yale.edu/) o [ClassiCat](http://www.classiccat.net).

* 'Cyprus Problem' settlement talks will finally resume the coming Tuesday. After almost a year, during which ""single sovereignty"" was not accepted by the T/C side, finally the two sides agreed to a joint declaration, which can be found [here](http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/02/07/joint-communique-draft/). 

* Minor coalition partner anti-reunification party DIKO threatens to leave government if the President (coming from pro-reunification DISY party) accepts said declaration. We can only hope they do. And then go die in a fire. 

* Minor opposition anti-reunification parties also condemn joint declaration, as expected. 

* Official opposition, pro-reunification party AKEL welcomes the declaration and vows to support the government in the new round of negotiation. 

* For some inexplicable reason, Greece's left wing opposition parties, KKE and SYRIZA, do side with the anti-reunification camp, and do not support their Cypriot counterpart, AKEL. And I do wonder who did exactly asked for their opinion in the first place.

It is rumored he might've made this money from his local government times in the 18th district of Budapest. The district issued Austrian-backed bonds to finance themselves a while ago.  He stepped down from all political positions.

They casually named it Team Hungary, because hey, that's totally not the generic name of our national sport teams and it's not one bit offensive for those who dare to consider themselves Hungarian, but not Fidesz-supporters (unthinkable, I know!)

* The new Wes Anderson movie, Grand Budapest Hotel premiered at the Berlinale. It has nothing to do with Hungary other than the title, but we still paid attention to it and were a bit disappointed that itâs supposedly turned out to be on the weaker side of Andersonâs works.

IMF is in the game for money (in the sense that they are the least likely to  waist money for ideological reasons). There probably is an ideological drive to spread free markets in general... but only as long as reforms will be made that will guarantee a pay-back.

USA is a coherent superpower that would like any potential adversary to be weakened as much as possible - so I do not believe that they give a rat ass about democracy for Ukrainian people per se... only as much as it will weaken potential of Russia resurgence. 

EU as unified force (in respect to Ukraine) is not existing. Germany and other exporters nations would love to open new markets so close to them (also Ukrainians will not be able to compete with them, so no real competition)... It is far from clear to me, if Ukraine would have a net benefit from free trade agreement. Eastern Europe want to move border between themselves and Russia as far east as possible, Southern Europe just do not give a damn... and why would they?

Obviously on the individuals' level  there are some desire ""to proselytize western type democracy""/""stick it to the Russia"", but I doubt that people that are making decisions in USA/EU care much about voting system or corruption in Ukraine.

I guess I painted a too bad picture of the lower schools. Not everyone wants to study. In the US its way more common to go to college while in germany after 9/10 years of school you can start your training in practical job. Thats a quality training you get. You work 3 years as trainee with a small, but quite ok pay and after that you are a finished mechanic/brick layer/electrician or whatever you do. 

The force thing is more subtle. Kids from academic background are more supported to go to university by parents than workers kids so its more likely that a doctors kid becomes a doctor than an assembly line workers kid. In the end if you want to achieve higher ed there is a variety of possibilities (see my dad).

University is free, with Bayern the last state abolished univeristy fees. If your family can't support you, its possible to get financial support from the state while you study. You have to pay back only the half of it and the debt you are collecting aren't nearly as much as in the US.

When you come here think of germany as a white paper, only your experience will give you a good insight/perception of the differences between north/south, whatever. I've visited almost every big city and I met nice germans, stupid germans, overly nice germans, annoying germans, cool germans... Even when I was living in a little place with less than 1000 inhabitants, people were SO different from each other, that I could not say ""People in that city were nice"", because 50% were not, and 50% were cool.

The only thing that comes to my mind is that there is LOTS of vegetarians, but just because where I come from I met 1 vegetarian in 17 years, so just thinking that 50% of people i know here are vegetarian, makes a huge difference. If I came from India or something like that, maybe it will look like almost nobody is vegetarian.

Other thing I noticed is that they seem to be too fucking liberal with their children. They shout, they run in the street (even where there is cars and it gets dangerous), they are annoying in restaurants... but maybe I only notice this because my father would beat my ass if I ever pronounced the word ""shit"" or said that I didn't wanted to wear my jacket.

So... what I wanted to say, is that all those generalities depend on you, where you come from and your point of view. Hope it helps (and that i didnt miss the point too much...)

Edit: You are from the US. One of the things I heard about north america is that Religion is a big deal. Well, maybe if you compare some states with germany, it will look like nobody is religious.

true,Yann0u,null,null,"This might be a long read. I'll answer your question in this wall of text, but I thought it might be a good opportunity to shed some light about European Schools. I think [there might be a better written article on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_School) about the functioning of Euroschools, but here goes. 

First of all pupils are put in different language sections depending on their mother tongue, also called LI. There are 5 years of primary school, and 7 years of secondary school. It ends with graduation, also called European Baccalaureate. I'll talk about secondary school here, since its functioning is the most interesting. The curriculum is the same for all language sections in all Euroschools.

Usually, pupils have their first language class, Latin, Maths, and Science in their LI. From the 3rd year on (13 years old), many classes are taught in their second language (first foreign language, called LII) which was either English, German or French. Some schools have Spanish, Italian, Dutch or Danish, I think. Those classes were usually History, Geography, Economics. That same year, pupils choose a third language (LIII). Depending on what classes you chose and your language section, you also had Physical Education, Music or Art class in your LII or even LIII.

In 6th year pupils choose a more literary curriculum or more of a scientific one. There's also more Social Sciences if they want, it's pretty flexible. It's very complicated for the staff, because there are so many language sections, so many pupils, and each pupil's timetable is unique. So you might end up with a Finnish kid in your Chemistry class taught in French (if the Finnish kid has French as LII). It got even more complicated in '04 when the new countries joined and there were kids called SWOLS: Students WithOut Language Section. They were put in English, French or German LI, usually the language they studied most back home.

Now, to your question: as you probably imagine, you can't teach European history the same way when you have German, French and English kids in the same room. They had a rather unique approach: we were simply taught how Europe progressed throughout history. So we studied Spain, Victorian England, the French Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution in all of Europe (not only France/Britain/Germany), etc. When the two world wars came up, the official stance was that there were no winners, only millions of deaths. I had History in German with a german teacher so it was very special: his generation still felt very guilty about WWII and when it came up it was sometimes very sad. On a lighter note, he grew up in West-Berlin and his account of the six months following the fall of the Berlin Wall was hilarious! There was another history teacher from East Germany, and they were constantly joking around and their (firsthand) accounts of the years 1961 to 1989 were just fascinating.

Both my parents worked in the Euroschool I went to and I knew that it was a huge administrative clusterfuck. But it worked all right. For the kid I was, it was a truly awesome experience. The teachers were great and amazed to be teaching in that place (my English as LIII teacher was the best!), I had friends from all over Europe and I speak three languages âalmostâ fluently. It was common there, but I quickly learned that it's rather rare in the real world. It's there that I got my passion for languages (the English language specifically, thanks Mr Leader), and I'm so thankful to have been there. All in all, if you can put your kids there, do it.

TL;DR: fingers hurt, nostalgia overload. Read that shit, it's interesting.

* Top story of the week is by far having our Princess showing up in court to clear any suspicions of her having anything to do with the corruption case that's probably going to send her husband to jail. Nah, just kidding, this is Spain, nobody goes to jail for that (don't you dare look a police officer funny, though)! After 6 hours, our *Infanta* (that's fancy Spanish for princess, you guys!) only answered 14 of the 200 questions the judge asked. Disney, this is not.

* Once upon a time, in the magical Kingdom of Spain, there was a jolly good fellow named Miguel Blesa. He had plenty of politician friends (one of them our very own Aznar, former prime minister!) and he managed a very powerful *Caja de Ahorros* (some sort of regional banks under public management). Of course, since this is Spain, he took as much public money as he could and eventually was caught. In any other civilized country he would've end up in jail and that'd be the end of the story. Here? The judge investigating his crimes has been suspended.

* Things are getting heated down in Ceuta by the Moroccan border. At least 9 immigrants died after the *Guardia Civil* 'repelled' their attemps of crossing the border using rubber bullets and tear gas. If that wasn't enough, a video surfaced showing a group of *Guardias Civiles* escorting a freshly-arrived group of immigrants back to Morocco without offering first aid or anything, which is illegal. And don't get me started with the razor wire we're using on the fences there...

* The violence used by the police in demonstrations in both Valladolid and AlcorcÃ³n has received a lot of attention, considering [this video of them dragging two girls out of a bar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTFhpSPsusw) (**Warning: it's loud!**) and an old lady still in the hospital after allegedly receiving a few hits in the head. Of course there is a nice list of arrested and wounded people, not that you'll hear about it on the TVE.

* Oh, and our flag bearer in the goddamn Sochi Winter Olympics commented that homosexuals should ""lie low"" during the games. Don't blame the poor guy, he's a figure-skater.

And I guess the panini bread is really just an uncooked baguette, but you know, there is something different about it than a traditional baguette. 

Assuming OP is in the US, he is probably going to have to settle for ""french bread"" from the grocery store and a George Foreman grill, since I don't think he'll be able to get either the bread or the grill for a traditional panini style sandwich. I just seem to remember liking that one better than with a baguette, although I might be remembering liking a panini vs. a slam sandwich.

OP, if you come across this, if the stores around have some unbaked bread, you know, pre-prepared and you bake it at home, that is basically panini bread.  Is smooshes better, but you probably won't be able to get as many fries in there.

But the grill is going to probably be your bigger problem, as the panini grill is designed to press flat, where the Foreman or whatever is hinged differently and will want to squish all the insides out.  The panini grill is hinged so that it comes straight down onto the top of the sandwich, so it mashes it together pretty good.  An alternative to a Foreman would just be doing it in a pan and really pressing the sandwich down with something flat as you cook each side.

I agree that it should be expected that everybody by now knows what cookies are and why they are necessary for the Internet to function. However, cookies aren't ALWAYS necessary nor are ALL implementations legal. Using them legally should be easy enough - Google just didn't do so. 

&gt;(take the issue to accounting, not frontpage techies...)

But the case was a tech-problem (cookie-related), not money-related (until the court ordered fines). Surely it's the problem of techies!

Also, adding a message to the national frontpage isn't a huge effort.

Printing apologies (court ordered or not) on frontpages of newspapers is an ages old tradition. The same goes for a service having to inform the users for their failures to respect law. Sometimes these messages are also nailed to the frontdoor of the business. 

&gt;while they're [Google] the main reason the net is still public, free and open nowadays 

The main reason net is still public is because we have laws that make net neutrality mandatory. I pay for my net access - and I'm going to guess that you do too. Google also doesn't usually share their code, so net isn't free in that sense either.  

&gt; you pay for google maps ? No ?

Viewing those ads and giving data on my use practices is how I pay for using Google Maps which Google then turns into money. Ads directly, route planning etc. by using the information in other services they offer. 

Not all services are paid with money or solely by money. 

&gt;I think the CNIL was totally wrong on that one.

Google didn't break French laws?

&gt; Or a space-unlimited email box before them ? haha that one didn't even exist.

And still doesn't on Google (I have 15 gigs which is shared between email, photos and probably by some other services as well). Also: nothing stopped me from having a huge inbox back in 2003. I could have rented or operated one if I had wanted to. It's just that there weren't ad-paid inboxes available - mostly because data storage was many times more expensive back then. The custom was to read and delete. And the ads were put there for reading.

Google changed the game by making the data in the emails valuable - they helped target ads, so suddenly the mail wasn't an additional cost but a new resource. 

&gt;Let's not speak about the search engine and horrors before like paying relevant search results or alternative browsers or patchs for internet explorer 6 inbuilt bugs

If google hadn't come up with a working search engine, some other party would have. And we had alternative browsers back then - Mozilla and Opera come first into mind. 

It's also worth mentioning that Microsoft wasn't going to stagnate Explorer to 6 but instead update it every time a new OS came out. Alas, they had those problems with Longhorn. This is also an example against monopolies - Microsoft didn't have to hurry because there wasn't any real competition back then. And we now don't have any real competition in search engines now. The ""next generation"" of that might well be in the sides waiting to spring up.

&gt;And while companies like facebook nearly-openly sell profiles datas to the highest bidder[1] ,

The operating word there is ""alleged"". 

&gt;My employer or insurance company can't read my emails or personnal pictures just by signing a bribe big enough to google...).

Yes, because that would be against laws. We don't know if Google would do it if it weren't illegal, but we thankfully don't have to find out.

&gt;Maybe the CNIL should have pressured more about the real-name policy on youtube (where they kind of harass you to use your real name to post anything).

I hate the real-name policy myself, but is there any law Google is breaking by trying to implement this? CNIL can't just decide that this is wrong today - they base their actions upon law.

&gt;BTW where's that frontpage admission that MS sabotaged IE6 and the web browser market for 10 years to try to enforce their own ms-only-compatible ""standards"" ? 

BrowserChoice.eu. It opened as a popup for all users of Windows. 

Also, this wasn't something that directly involved consumers. It was about healthy competition, so it was mostly between the different browser developers. 

&gt; Or tried to prevent computers to run any other OS throught hard disk tattoos and bribing/blackmailing large OEM like Acer/Dell/Asus/HP/... ? 

Those manufacturers (and the deals made) were in USA, so this wouldn't have been EU jurisdiction. It was US jurisdiction though, and this was part of the United States v. Microsoft-case back in the late 90s.

&gt;(""get the facts"" and other ms similar campaigns based on outright falsified and made up ""comparisons"", intimidating away concurrents' clients with patent trolling/blackmailing,...)

I believe some of this falls under marketing where shifty comparisons is allowed (if not encouraged). Part of this falls under the Microsoft-monopoly case in EU.

I live in Edinburgh so I'm just going to assume you have a wee bit of familiarity with your own capital city?

First off, the bad areas in Berlin are much less dangerous than the bad areas in Edinburgh. The posh areas in Berlin are also probably a bit posher. In the end, I don't think it matters much where you live because it's a very safe place compared to Scotland; I say that living in a very unsafe place in Scotland where I get attacked by neds randomly. Getting through Berlin is definitely quicker than getting through London because public transport actually works in Berlin most of the time (and runs overnight, too, at least partially); it's about the same as getting through Edinburgh. Getting from Wannsee to Blankenfelde takes about as long as getting from Currie to Leith Links despite Berlin being larger (area-wise it's about the size of London, which is why I did *that* comparison).

When I moved away, Kreuzberg started being sort of populated by British/American expats a fair bit and I hear Neuk&amp;ouml;lln has been going that way, too.

true,io_la,RlP,Rheinland-Pfalz,"When I went to school about 25 years ago in a very rural area the tiered system wasn't that bad. Most students went to Hauptschule (main school) and then to the vocatile school where they learned to be mechanics, barbers, welders, ... all the crafts which were needed at the time. Some people went to the Realschule and became banker, secretaries ect. and those who showed a lot of talent went to Gymnasium with the goal to study later.

Problem was that the demands from the employes changed, they wanted ""better"" apprentices,  where Realschule was enough a couple of years ago you now needed Abitur, about nobody wanted students with a basic Hauptschulabschluss any more, and so parents now force their kids into the school forms which don't fit, im my federal state up to the point that we don't have any Hauptschulen any more.

I don't think that this is the right way. I have a lot of students which are overchallenged all the time. This leads to psychic problems, fear of school and some of them fail for good. But I don't think that the tiered system is to blame for this per se. I like my school kind and I love to teach there and I think there are a loot of kids who fit into this system.

That being said I also think that our whole school system has to change because the job market changed a lot and I don't think that we are on a really good way right now. 

In my opinion the whole system school needs a general overhaul. We need school forms for kids which are not made to sit and listen in classes for 12 odd years, we need school forms where kids can do stuff and move around and find their own ways to learn and find ways which fit them better than the schools we have now. 

But since every federal state deforms their school in their own ways I don't really see any real and positive change in the next years.

European banks issue what are known as chip-and-pin cards, which are much more secure  than what most American banks are issuing, which is the swipe-and-sign type (I'm guessing you're American b/c it's one of the few places that hasn't yet implemented the chip-and-pin cards).  Most businesses will accept the swipe-and-sign cards when you do the transaction person-to-person, and they accept the liability to verify that you are indeed the cardholder, but automated machines cannot verify your identity with anything other than a pin number.

Il indique clairement qu'il ne souhaites pas que la France reste dans l'Euro car il ne pense pas que nous sommes capable de concurrencer l'Allemagne. Quelle logique de perdant.

Un exemple pour montrer a quel point cette logique nous coute:  on mentionnait sur ce sous-reddit que la France allait acheter des drones a l'Ã©tranger. Certains s'offusquaient que la France n'achete pas aux entreprises interieures. Mais pourquoi? Parce que les entreprises Francaises ont TOUTES ratÃ©es le coche. L'innovation en terme de drone, le dÃ©veloppement sur ce point? Pas intÃ©ressant autant se concentrer sur les trucs classiques pas risquÃ©s. Je rigole pas, ils Ã©taient au courant largement avant qu'on pouvait /devait avoir besoin de drones longues distances de ce type mais ils ont prÃ©fÃ©rÃ©s ne pas risquer de l'argent en investissement.

Et aujourd'hui, leur condition pour investir? Des garanties que le gouvernement investissera dans les drones pour eux. Le risque liÃ© a l'innovation est dÃ©portÃ© sur le gouvernement, l'entreprise Francaise a peur d'innover. 

La vraie question ca devrait Ãªtre pourquoi? Une des thÃ©ories est que contrairement a d'autres pays, quand on Ã©choue en France on a rarement de deuxiÃ¨me chance on perds la confiance directement des investisseurs, des banques...

true,bobdole3,UNSA,United States of America,"The primary system can promote some really strange outcomes in the American political system. The primary elections are like the national elections, but heavily shifted to the right or the left, because only one party votes in the primary. 

This is really important because, on the national level, being close to the center is good, especially if your opponent is on the fringe. Hardline Republicans will always vote Republican, and hardline Democrats always vote Democrat, so elections are often made by swing voters, who are typically in the center. 

The same holds true in primaries; you need to hit as many voters as possible to win, but now you can't rely upon the support of the fringes and you active need to appeal to them. The problem is what that ""center"" is. If you're looking at the Republican party, the ""left"" is the Wall St. banker type; rolling back the government, reduce debt, cut taxes, generally avoid legislating morality. The ""right"" meanwhile are basically fascists who are looking to establish a theocracy free of filthy foreigners. There's a reason that McCain did an about face on so many of his more centrist policies as soon as he made a bid for President (to say nothing of why he picked up Palin).

tl;dr Primaries encourage a rush to the edges of the political spectrum. The strongest candidate for the primary isn't always the strongest candidate for the election, because the primaries don't need to worry about appeasing independents or wooing voters from the other party who are on the fence.

 * Edit: latest news: the elephant baby still doesn't suck from its mother. First few days are critical, the calf has to obtain some elephant specific nutrients. Because of this the ZOO asked for elephant *blood*, got it, now they they mix it with the milk.

  * Edit 10/02: elephant mother was put into artificial sleep. Even then the baby refused to suck her. Bottle still used.

* Czech Republic has several ""Highest Courts"". One of them year ago decided that policeman who arrived to a crime scene cannot be treated as reliable witness before the court and neither the information he collects there.  The decision was applied recently and this caused furore in the media and among the police. Now boss of another Highest Court said this decision is crazy [(cz)](http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/326941-svet-se-fakt-zblaznil-hodnoti-verdikt-nejvyssiho-soudu-sef-nss-baxa.html).

* Two gypsy women robbed an old woman in her house in a village on central Bohemia. The victim was after heart attack and had problems with seeing and talking. The robbers sneaked into the house under false pretense and stole the money. After they fled the old woman started to call for help. Scene from action movie followed. One neighbour heard it, caught the robbers and kept them in a cage (used to store bread in local shop) until the police arrived. The old woman recovered her talking due to the incident. The robbers were sentenced to 1 year *suspended* [(cz)](http://kutnohorsky.denik.cz/zlociny-a-soudy/starence-se-vratil-hlas-pri-pronasledovani-lupicek.html).

* A private university may be closed. Unlike many other countries ""private university"" in the Czech Republic is practically synonym for fraud, low quality and academic titles exchanged for money. A state comission recently forbade one such school in Brno (south Moravia) to accept new students because they do not have enough of qualified teachers [(cz)](http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/326762-vysoka-skola-karla-englise-v-brne-asi-skonci-oficialne-to-ale-jeste-nevi.html).

The project is a disaster - it cost much more then expected and fails to provide better usability or additional services. The former city mayor who pushed the project through had connection with organized crime (shown by leaked phone calls).

There are 24 languages in the EU and theoretically your kid could be taught in any of them.

In reality, French, German English is taught in any of them and it varies from town to town for the others. For example in Luxembourg (where I was, and where my dad still works): French, German and English both in Lux I &amp;amp; II. Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Finnish and Polish are language sections in Lux I, and Czech, Danish, Greek, Hungarian, Italian in Lux II. Romanian, Slovak, and Slovenian students are in Lux II and SWOLS are put in French, German or English as LI until their 6th year where they have LI in their language.

As you can see all 24 languages aren't there, but they're trying to have them.

It works more or less the same for all schools (that's the main goal), with less languages. Luxembourg is the place with the most languages, IIRC they're very proud of that :)

As for the English curriculum, I don't remember everything, but in the beginning we did a lot of practical stuff.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I thought about that too. Much of BBC Worldwide's income goes on producing more high quality programmes using less of the licence fee payers' money.

However, I think it is moot to say the reason is because BBC's productions are in English. Britain's public and commercial media industry makes a ton of money from selling formats, of both high and low quality, many of which were bought by German broadcasters: 

Wer wird MillionÃ¤r? (Who wants to be a millionaire?), Bauer sucht Frau (The Farmer Wants a Wife), Frauentausch (Wife Swap), Deutschland sucht den Superstar (Pop Idol), X Factor, Let's Dance (Strictly Come Dancing/Dancing with the Stars), Ich bin ein Star... (I'm a Celebrity...), Das perfekte Dinner (Come Dine with Me), Stromberg (The Office), Junior Docs (Junior Doctors), LindenstraÃe (Coronation Street)... the list goes on, and on, and on. All British formats, all bought by German broadcasters. 

So the question is, IF Germany cannot sell its finished programmes, why can't it create fresh new formats for worldwide sale to subsidise its own business model? I can think of only two, Wetten Dass (titled You Bet on British TV) and Schlag den Raab (Beat the Star, which was filmed in the same Cologne-based studios, but was a flop). 

ZDF Enterprises, just one of several commercial arms in German public media, does seek to sell its programmes with recent successes such as the high quality drama mini-series Unsere MÃ¼tter, Unsere VÃ¤ter ('Generation War') which has sold extremely well worldwide. 

But why so little of this? And if it is because of the German language, why so few fresh formats sold worldwide, from either public or commercial? There is no excuse. 

I think if public media stepped up its game in this department, commercial would have to as well, leading to a better media economy and better programming for all. ",0,1391959224,null,0,false,0,cfax04e,t3_1xfilg,t1_cfax04e,t1_cfawpi3,null,1432320970,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

The historical record. In the space of just a few hundred years, which is a drop in the bucket of human existence, capitalism has wiped out **mass** poverty over much of the earth. The extremely high living standard that you take for granted comes from private property in the means of production. Venezuela, North Korea, and Cuba are all hostile to that idea, with the expected results.

It does feels dirty on the simple page. But really the issue is that it sets a dangerous precedent. Which really smells here ""if you are a big corp like let's say ...t and don't like say one of your concurrents just ""rat"" them on small technical details to the state who will just bring them to knees.

Google is part of the net critical infrastructure. And making infrastructure vulnerable to underhanded tricks like this is bad.

&gt; Printing apologies (court ordered or not) on frontpages of newspapers is an ages old tradition.

Sure, which is prolly why they complied instead of trying to blatantly ignore the orders like some *cough* some fruit company.

The part that just kills me a bit is that the one company providing a web high quality service without bullshit gets hit but concurrents doing ten times worse are totally ignored. I'm pretty sure MS still never paid any of the anti trust fines to the European gov.

&gt; Google also doesn't usually share their code, so net isn't free in that sense either. 

It's free in the sense that you don't have to pay 60 bucks to type something in google to search it or 15$/mo to go above a 10mb yahoo mailbox limit. While there are no equivalent concurrent who can do a tenth of that on the quality side. Before that if you wanted usefull results you had to pay software like copernic.

&gt; Viewing those ads and giving data on my use practices is how I pay for using Google Maps which Google then turns into money

Then look at ms networks. You had BOTH the ads AND the subscription. And buying cost. And needed to had additionnal bills.

Just look at the xbox where they did what they want. First you pay the box. Then you had to pay for the wifi dongle. Then you pay for ms live access (basically net access). Then if you want a web browser, you pay some more. Software all have ""DLC"" which is basically ""pay again 10 times if you want to unlock the rest"". Oh and don't forget the additionnal giant Ads everywere EVEN if you pay.

That's the concurrents model, and that why i hope they just go die in a fire on the mainstream computer market.

&gt; The main reason net is still public is because we have laws that make net neutrality mandatory

You mean the one we still trying to sell to the media oligarchy by for example dismantling the ARCEP and selling them to the CSA (which has no fucking idea how to run the internet, should stick to TV and stop using MPAA laywers and lobbyists as managers) ?

Or the one already dismantled in the US ? 
http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-net-neutrality-20140114,0,522106.story

Or, back to europe, well; lets fact speak for themselves :
http://www.laquadrature.net/en/Net_neutrality

&gt; Google didn't break French laws?

Is there an article on the evening news everytime somebody jaywalk ?

&gt; And still doesn't on Google (I have 15 gigs

OK, sorry i checked again and they put back a 15 gb limit on the free account due to abusers. It's still kind of enormous compared to what it was before Gmail and will probably be lifted up back soon.

&gt; If google hadn't come up with a working search engine, some other party would have

Yeah, Microsoft would probably have patented the whole thing and thrown the current bing down our throats. I mean, ""the microsoft network"" where you have to pay to access ms service, pay for the search engine, and get used to the same ""quality"" where typing ""banana"" used to show you apples.

&gt;  Mozilla and Opera come first into mind. 

You might want to look who funded back the Mozilla foundation from the back of oblivion after the crash of AOL. The admitted reason Google paid forward the devellopement of Firefox was because the incompatible but force installed everywhere IE6 was the only ""browser"" you didn't need to sell your firstborn on the black market to access at the time. So basically google is the only direct reason Firefox , the main second option exist too. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation#Financing

Oh and Opera was sold too like 50$, before the sudden arrival of the new mozilla browser, Firefox shamed them all to death. Again. 

Meanwhile, MS was busy sabotaging the W3C and ensuring that you had to pick between offering the famous ""Site for IE. Site for any other standard browsers like netscape."" page on every web site because it was the only way anyone could watch your site, or just develloping the IE site only because it was 80% of the trafic anyway because there was only that on Windows you could get without paying absurd prices. Windows being force preinstalled on every x86 computers, x86 computers being the only one affordable for the general public.

&gt; It's also worth mentioning that Microsoft wasn't going to stagnate Explorer to 6 but instead update it every time a new OS came out. 

Ahahahahha. ""no sir you didn't caught me red handed trying to shank my concurrents. The knife was only well i wanted to show it to them and definitely not cut their throat with it."". Seriously ?

MS found excuses to refuse develloping update for a full 5 fucking years before they lost an entire 50% of the market overnight because it was so full of dung that when firefox came out free EVERYONE jumped ship almost blindly.

&gt; This is also an example against monopolies - Microsoft didn't have to hurry because there wasn't any real competition back then

Annnnd maybe why we shouldn't hit the one company trying to still move things while MS still get caught frequently bribing officials to get what they want. Like when they got caught red handed last year again :
http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/technology/us-said-to-look-into-microsoft-bribery-allegations.html?_r=0

&gt; BrowserChoice.eu. It opened as a popup for all users of Windows. 

Yep, because otherwise the EU gov basically said they would ban microsoft from the continent if they didn't stop sabotaging the market. And forced them to do that one. MS still found way to avoid the update from working on 2 computers on 3 and blammed it on bugs :

http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/03/07/browser-choice-fine/

And theyyy STILL didn't paid any fine for that one either.

&gt; Those manufacturers (and the deals made) were in USA

Bullshit. For example, the ""vente liÃ©e"" is strictly illegal in France for example. The fact of actively sabotaging computer hardware to brick it if you try replacing Windows from the disk, ""tivoization"" is highly illegal too. They never got punished for it.

http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vente_li%C3%A9e
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoization

And they're starting to try to force it back in again with Windows 8 and ""secure boot"" bullshit. The trick is they force hard disk bootloader encryption with a root key only held by ms ""for your own safety"". If you don't have the crypted loader and the option is enabled in the bios, the computer simply refuse to power on and boot. Enjoy the only thing showing on the screen in that case :

http://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/secure-boot-violation-invalid-signature-detected.jpg

And more and more laptops aren't showing said option anymore so you can't disable it at all. Soon you won't be able to use another os like ubuntu without risky hacking/cracking the bootloader/bios of your own laptop because the computer will refuse to start without Windows 8.

Or if the ""concurrents"" start kneeling before MS insane laundry lists of demands to ensure they die soon like ""impossible-price paying os only. Give all your profits to MS. Banned from computer of such and such size. Your are forbidden to make your operating system viable on computer with screens larger than 10"" or 2 Go memory or 300Gb hard disk  etc etc"". I didn't made that one up, it's the one they pushed on netbooks to make them unusable and kill willfully the entire market and why EEE and similar netbooks don't exist anymore (it hurted too much their cartel profit by not running Vista so they killed it) :
http://www.engadget.com/2009/05/22/microsoft-publishes-maximum-windows-7-netbooks-specs/

This, this kind of bullshit is ""anti concurrency"" largescale abuse we should destroy. But once again, nobody in europe lifts a finger while they should be ripping MS a new one for barely hiding the fact that theyr're trying once again to prevent concurrency from even existing. 

But meanwhile the gov is busy harassing google publicly because they have a cookie expiring a bit too late for their taste. I mean, seriously dudes ?

We had quite a boring week.

* There is an increase in traffic fines, 10,3 million in 2013 while there were ""only"" 9,6 million fines in 2012. Most of these fines concered speeding violations. A quarter (!) of all the fines were giving because of the ""trajectcontrole"" on highways like the A2 between Utrecht and Amsterdam. The trajectcontrole is a system of camera's mounted above the road which measure your average speed from point A to B..
In my opinion, the A2 between Utrecht and Amsterdam is criminal. 10 lanes with a 100km/h speed limit on most parts, some parts 80 and some 130 for like a couple of hundreds metres. It's just money making.. [Just look at this beautifull highway that is ruined.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtKwfRUWeiU)

* For the second time meat needs to get taken back from the stores because the company producing the meat couldn't show exactly what was in it. And the tests on the cow-meat confirmed that it was mixed with horse-meat.

* The judge ruled that municipalities can issue a local ""blowverbod"", places were it is illegal to smoke weed. [These places are indicated by this, commonly stolen, signs.](http://www.nrc.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/mbBlowverbod2.144-586x370.jpg)

* Amsterdam payed 100.000 euros for a new logo. The scandal is, is that the new logo is almost identical to the old one. [The old logo on top and the new one on the bottom.](http://content.nos.nl/data/image/xxl/2014/02/05/606730.jpg)

* Traffic jams have reduced in 2013 by 8% compared to 2012. The cause; widening a lot of highways. It works, despite what those lefties have to say about it. 

* [A new Albert Heijn supermarket opened, and after two weeks a BMW crashed into it. ](http://content.nos.nl/data/image/xxl/2014/02/03/605531.jpg)

Also, I am not religious in the slightest, and am quite used to the secular atmosphere. 

We agree that we can't possibly judge the personalities of entire populations; but, there are definitely differences in overall mindsets which you may be aware of - since you traveled the country extensively it would seem. For e.g: if I was talking about the US I would say that the Northeast is very liberal and secular whereas the South is very conservative and religious; cities such as LA are very superficial; the people in California are noticeably more laid back and lead a specifically different life style compared to people from say New York.

So, as you can see I mentioned a few generalities which may not even apply to everyone in the places which I listed, but they give you an idea of the overall mindset of the places.

It's a vicious circle. If they adjusted their remit to include fee payers of all kinds, they'd be surprised by the positive reaction they'd get.

PoichÃ© RaiNews riporta le stesse inesattezze, suppongo che si tratti di un lancio d'agenzia ruminato per renderlo il piÃ¹ sensazionalista possibile.

*Premetto: tutta la critica che segue riguarda la discrepanza fra gli articoli della stampa e il rapporto originale. Non entro nel merito della questione, che Ã¨ molto delicata e su cui non esprimo pareri personali.*

Si nota innanzitutto che la ricerca di Save the Children *non usa la parola ""minore"" o ""minorenne""* prima di pagina 28. Tutte le domande precedenti parlano di ""adolescenti"", che Ã¨ un termine che non si sovrappone del tutto a ""minorenne"".

Ora, la legge italiana consente i rapporti sessuali dai 14 anni in su (salvo rare eccezioni). E, badate bene, l'unico capitolo del rapporto in cui si usa la parola ""minore"" Ã¨ proprio quello in cui si spiega che *la maggioranza assoluta delle persone non conosce la legge in merito*. A pagina 30 Ã¨ scritto che secondo il 61% delle persone la legge vieta ogni rapporto sessuale sotto i 18 anni. BenchÃ© il 55% degli intervistati si dica ""molto informato"" o ""abbastanza informato"", solo il 5% di loro ha dato la risposta esatta.

Purtroppo, nel commentare un rapporto che prende in considerazione questo problema, il giornalista che ha scritto il lancio non ha solo evitato di educare i lettori, ma ha aggravato la confusione che esiste in materia.

Ci sono altri problemi nell'articolo, per esempio una continua incertezza sulla base su cui sono calcolate le percentuali. Alcune fanno riferimento al campione 25-65 anni, altre al campione 45-65 anni (quel 28%, per esempio). Queste sottigliezze non vengono colte nell'articolo di RaiNews o del Corriere, che parlano sempre e solo di ""adulti"", e minano la credibilitÃ  del giornalista.

Ci sono un sacco di altri dati non corrispondenti (quel 2% Ã¨ in realtÃ  un 1%: probabilmente l'ha preso dalla tabella sbagliata), o che comunque sono stati talmente rimaneggiati da aver perso ogni loro contesto (""l'81% pensa che le interazioni sessuali tra adulti e adolescenti siano diffuse"", vero, ma c'Ã¨ un esplicito riferimento alle notizie di cronaca, non stiamo parlando di conoscenze dirette), ma qui si entra nei dettagli.

Vi consiglio comunque di leggere [il rapporto originale](http://risorse.savethechildren.it/files/comunicazione/Ufficio%20Stampa/Safer%20Internet%20Day%20-%20Interazioni%20sessuali%20adulti-minori%20a%20partire%20da%20Internet.pdf), che Ã¨ uno spunto di conversazione migliore di un articolo sensazionalista.",0,1391971090,null,0,false,0,cfb1axf,t3_1xg2yo,t1_cfb1axf,t3_1xg2yo,null,1432322995,28,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,28

Il se trouve et tu le dis toi mÃªme que adopter l'euro impliquait une respecialisation que l'Allemagne n'a pas eu Ã  faire : Ã§a pÃ©nalisait la France dÃ¨s le dÃ©part .

L'allemagne est un modele qui fonctionne il est normal de vouloir le copier et le concurrencer.
C'est une respÃ©cialisation qui n'a rien a voir avec l'Euro et tout a voir avec la mondialisation. On est qu'on le veuille ou non en compÃ©tition mondiale. Ce n'Ã©tait pas le cas il y a 20 ans et ce n'est pas l'Euro qui est la cause.

&gt;D'autre part tu ignores toute la partie oÃ¹ il parle de l'aÃ©ronautique et des cosmÃ©tiques. Moi je le vois bien avec les produits L'OrÃ©al de ma copine : Ã§a coÃ»te moins cher de les envoyer depuis les US que de les acheter en France... Et c'est directement Ã  cause de l'euro. 

Acheter des produits aux US coute moins cher si tu ne paye pas la TVA. La diffÃ©rence principale c'est la TVA. L'euro-dollar a un impact mais qui est nÃ©gligeable comparÃ© aux taxes.

&gt; Pourquoi Ã©vites tu la question monÃ©taire ? Il y a des politiques monÃ©taires adaptÃ©es et d'autres non. Il se trouve que la politique monÃ©taire est adaptÃ©e Ã  l'Allemagne et pas Ã  la France. C'est expliquÃ© en dÃ©tails et le mec ne confond pas avec la mondialisation mais parle bien des effets monÃ©taires. 

Parce que ce n'est jamais la monnaie le principal problÃ¨me c'est une excuse pour Ã©viter de se poser des questions de fond. Et il n'explique pas pourquoi l'Angleterre hors de l'Euro marche mal, ou l'ensemble des pays dans des unions monÃ©taires (ou qui basent leur monnaie sur le dollar directement), n'ont pas de problÃ¨me. Tout d'un coup tout viens de l'euro c'est un Ã©cran de fumÃ©e. Comme c'est un Ã©cran de fumÃ©e que croire que manipuler la monnaie va changer l'Ã©conomie. Il y a beaucoup d'exemple du contraire, et un mÃ©canisme notamment de ""deflation wars"" qui empeche vraiment les effets liÃ©s a la monnaie.

&gt; Pour les drones, tu oublies que chez les concurrents il y a eu des aides massives des Ãtats avec des commandes tandis qu'en Europe on n'est pas foutus d'aider nous entreprises alors que tous les autres le font.

La crÃ©ation des drones efficaces et a longue distance a crÃ©Ã© la demande et les USA en ont achetÃ©. On est pas foutu de faire la mÃªme chose parce que c'est un investissement risquÃ© sur le long terme. Impossible quand les financiers veulent des rÃ©sultats maintenant.

&gt; Bref, tu vas chercher des causes psychologiques alors qu'on a des causes rationnelles. Je ne suis pas du tout convaincu par ton commentaire. 

Ca n'a rien de psychologique, c'est une question de prise de risque financiere vis a vis de logique de rentabilitÃ©. On le voit dans pas mal d'entreprise en France : pour faire des profits il faut:
- reduire la masse salariale
- reduire les charges sociales
- faire moins cher ce qu'on fait dÃ©jÃ 

OÃ¹ sont les entreprises francaises qui vont te parler de modernisation, robotisation, innovation? Nulle part. Il y a en france des freins a ca tres concrets comme:

- jusqu'a prÃ©sent pas de banque d'investissement qui prenne des risques (les banques francaises ne jouent plus leur role : c'est pas moi qui le dit c'est le patron des PME francaises)

- Pas de logique de dÃ©veloppement mais de rentabilitÃ© pour les rentiers qui est l'enjeu majeur des grands patrons

- Une focalisation importante sur les charges sociales

- une focalisation sur l'Ã©chec. Quand tu Ã©choue bonne chance pour trouver des investissements.

The British pages have had ""WARNING! By law we must notice you that we are using cookies. By using this site etc."" for some time now.

&gt;Google is part of the net critical infrastructure. And making infrastructure vulnerable to underhanded tricks like this is bad.

Adding text to the frontpage doesn't affect anything. Or at least not to my understanding. You are free to enlighten me. 

&gt;The part that just kills me a bit is that the one company providing a web high quality service without bullshit gets hit but concurrents doing ten times worse are totally ignored. I'm pretty sure MS still never paid any of the anti trust fines to the European gov.

I'm fairly certain that they have been paid. Not paying them would have been huge news.

Of course, one can always doubt, but if the officials lie on stuff like this we have bigger problems than if Microsoft paid the fines.

&gt; Yeah, Microsoft would probably have patented the whole thing and thrown the current bing down our throats. 

Microsoft has only shown interest on the search business during the past few years (since they tried to buy Yahoo! in 2008). But all in all, this is just speculation.

&gt;Oh and Opera was sold too like 50$, before the sudden arrival of the new mozilla browser, Firefox shamed them all to death. 

The Netscape-browser cost money as well. They were (are) pretty important and cutting edge technology back then and the development needed to be funded SOMEHOW. Asking money for it seemed (and still does) seem like a good idea. Usually they got the money from OEM's. ""Free browser"" is only possible if it's being backed by a huge corporation who can absorb the development cost and chooses to do so for one reason or another. But creating advances that would make the user want to buy the next version seems like a good business help develop the platform as well. 

Infact, the fact that IE6 stagnated when it was bundled with Windows shows what happens when the software doesn't earn it's own keep. 

&gt;You might want to look who funded back the Mozilla foundation from the back of oblivion after the crash of AOL. The admitted reason Google paid forward the devellopement of Firefox was because the incompatible but force installed everywhere IE6 was the only ""browser"" you didn't need to sell your firstborn on the black market to access at the time. 

I know who funded them. But the project would have been running without them as well. Also it was Google's interest to make a browser that supported their webpages as IE6 didn't really do so that well (and being dependant on your competitor just isn't a good idea).

&gt;when firefox came out free EVERYONE jumped ship almost blindly.

At this point Opera was free with ads or the licence cost something like ten dollars. I know that I didn't use IE since the 90s. There were always alternatives.

Firefox went through because it looked exactly like IE but worked better. Opera worked better but it was (and still is) hugely complicated thing. So was the original Mozilla-browser. People didn't want a better browser. They wanted better IE.

&gt; Bullshit. For example, the ""vente liÃ©e"" is strictly illegal in France for example. The fact of actively sabotaging computer hardware to brick it if you try replacing Windows from the disk, ""tivoization"" is highly illegal too. They never got punished for it.

I don't read French (yet) but I assume you aren't talking about Microsoft's habit of blackmailing OEM's with the price of Windows' licences?

&gt;And they're starting to try to force it back in again with Windows 8 and ""secure boot"" bullshit. 

This is oncoming matter and I don't want to speculate. EU might yet act on it and it wouldn't be ""waking late"".

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN#Internet_Start

&gt; The Netscape-browser cost money as well. 

Noop. AOL Offered it.

&gt; and the development needed to be funded SOMEHOW. 

AOL paid it on the money they printed with the internet provider side which was already bordering on the scam margins (and still hasn't moved that much in half the US in the meantime... 20gb quota 15mb ADSL for 80$/mo in utah before the fiber hahaha).

&gt; asking money for it seemed (and still does) seem like a good idea.

No, it is not. Asking for money for every last speck of dust IS. VERY DEFINITELY. NOT. A . GOOD. IDEA. Stop trying to force insert goddam fuckin ""capitalism"" everywhere &gt;_&lt; . You're reducing the world with that logic to the ""owners"" who own large companies and collect all the money, and the workers who work only to give back immediatly the corporate owners all they have.  We didn't invented power cords and transformers just to make manufacturers very rich but because it's technically needed to use electric power. Same for internet and browsers.

But don't worry, going with that logic soon the atmosphere will be so polluted by chinese factories that you'll happily pay an air filter/conditionner and find it perfectly normal to pay for your clean air too.

Just please keep that kind of shit out of my continent.

&gt; Usually they got the money from OEM's

Netscape got money from internet providing. Google from search. MS from Windows. You won't make me believe MS is so starving they need actual extra money to patch the insane number of bugs plaging IE.

&gt; Infact, the fact that IE6 stagnated when it was bundled with Windows shows what happens when the software doesn't earn it's own keep. 

Or really, that's just microsoft fucking over the customer for 5 bucks and destroying concurents because they can.

&gt; and chooses to do so for one reason or another

Everybody doesn't always do something just to squeeze an extra buck out of your blood. At least outside the US. Some people still want to invent tools to use them instead of force you to pay them for it. As a fact, the internet is infrastructure. And wasn't invented to make money, but to work as a tool. So does all utilities. Do you pay your landlord everytime you want to plug a new item at your house ? No off course. ""but houses creation doesn't come cheap !"". Bullshit. Fuck that logic.

&gt; Also it was Google's interest to make a browser that supported their webpages as IE6 didn't really do so that well (and being dependant on your competitor just isn't a good idea).

And now you're saying it yourself. Google wanted people to use a browser that just didn't explode or break in the average user face every time they try merely opening it. Face it, the fact that IE was so shitty and full of aircraft-carrier-sized security flaws is what allowed the blaster epidemy to invade a computer on 3 on the surface of that planet. There is still half a dozen way to make you download and run a .exe merely by showing you a webpage on IE. And MS didn't gave a fuck about it and still barely fix the worst because otherwise people would abandon back IE10 again and just switch back to FF/Chrome all the way : https://www.google.com/search?q=internet%20explorer%2010%20exploit

&gt; At this point Opera was free with ads or the licence cost something like ten dollars.

Yeah about that : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Opera_web_browser#Version_7 
Altought there was a ""free version"", it was With the GIANT banner spanning at the top : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Opera_7.02.png
And random pub just as big jumping randomly in addition at the bottom on the other side.

While it was free, it was just borderline unusable. There's a difference between ""a few ads"" and a giant fucking billboard taking half the computer screen space, literraly, daylong. As for the paying version it was more frequently like 20-40$. To which you need to add others prices around so it just piles on quite quickely. Damn neocapitalism always just trying to get every last dollars out of you like vampires.

&gt; I don't read French (yet) but I assume you aren't talking about Microsoft's habit of blackmailing OEM's with the price of Windows' licences?

The issue is complexe but yeah. Basically; OEM can either : Ban any alternative OS and cooperate with MS policies of blacklisting anything else, refuse warranty on computer without the original window, put tattoo on the disk etc and get licences for a few dollar each in volume (Volume COA Licences).

Or they can try to refuse the blocking part and MS will at first rise the price of the licence to ""market levels"" (100$ each...) and frequently put caps on the number of licence they sell to the OEM (forcing the OEM to cap its sales or be fucked with windows-less-computers because customers are now too spoonfed MS as soon as they are kids in school that they don't even know a computer can boot without MS and will flee said vendor if there is absolutely no Windows on it straigth from start; and to either add 100$ to the price of the computer and be fucked by concurrents or absorb it and be fucked by the loss).

Or if the OEM try selling other operating systems too; MS start refusing selling new licences or 10x the price. So, really when you saw Dell or Asus selling linux, they stockpiled quietly licences for a while then went totally nuclear on MS by kind of screaming ""stop that Windows Vista bullshit or we cut you from our market and 50% of the world and you die with us."". Not speaking about the disastrous announce of the Xbox One. The entire MS strategy is frequently that for everything : ""You're going with us so deal, whether you like it or not, so we might as well do as fuck as we want"".

&gt; EU might yet act on it and it wouldn't be ""waking late"".

According to that logic, it would be best if a bureaucracy chose everything for us, it would be more efficient to have a small more specialised groups making all the choices and we common folk going on with our lives trusting that our politicians care about us and will chose for us better than we'd choose for ourselves.

Before you know it, we'd throw democracy out of the window and live in an enlightened despotism with a (supposedly) well-intentioned autocrat deciding things for us.

Decisions that affect everybody must take into account the opinion of everybody, it would never be legitimate to support democracy when it suits us and trump over it when it doesn't.

On its own, much of the new deal is considered to be a failure, but a few of its programs are considered to be successful/influential in the long term(like a few public works projects and Social Security). 

&gt;The best cost/quality in the world is the NHS

The NHS is an embarrassment for Britain, I don't think I've seen a worse healthcare system in an OECD country.

While for Britain's NHS, they just had trouble hitting their target of under four hours: http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jul/11/nhs-waiting-lists-data, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10246145/NHS-waiting-lists-are-longest-in-five-years.html, and http://www.semes.org/revista/vol24_1/15_ing.pdf. [And patients will need to wait at least a week for a general practitioner in 2014.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/nhs/10537094/Patients-will-wait-at-least-a-week-to-see-GP-in-2014-it-is-claimed.html) With CABG the average wait time is 57 days, with [2x as many bypass procedures and 4x as many angioplasties in the U.S. per capita but a 36% higher heart disease mortality rate in the UK](http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottatlas/2013/07/05/happy-birthday-to-great-britains-increasingly-scandalous-national-health-service/). Per that Forbes article the mortality rate for breast cancer in the UK was 88% higher than the U.S. Prostate cancer mortality rates are worse. Mortality rates for colorectal cancer are 40% higher than rates in the U.S. (If you can't read his source(which is behind a paywall) this seems to be favorable towards his conclusion: [cdc us stats](http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/uscs/toptencancers.aspx) and [prostate uk stats](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/prostate/mortality/)). [The UK also has the lowest 5-year relative survival rates across various cancers](http://b-i.forbesimg.com/theapothecary/files/2013/11/CONCORD-table12.jpg).

&gt;http://www.worldwatch.org/global-food-prices-continue-rise-0

Globally, yes. A lot of countries were hit badly by the great recession. Those prices are the same as those of 1960s though, and now there's a lot more food to go around now. [As of 2013 they have stabilized](http://therationalpessimist.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/fao-food-price-index-june-2013-jpeg.jpg). 

&gt;The obesity epidemic in the US is partly dude to corporate welfare in the food sector. Crappy food is cheap.

Yes a lot of the market demand driving down prices in the US shifted away from healthy food and towards food with corn fructose syrup because of direct subsidies. Luckily the latest farm bill(Agricultural Act fo 2014) will start cutting a lot of these direct subsidies. 

&gt;The poverty rate is a median. The lower 80% is being butchered, as your own data suggests.

It's actually interesting. While wages are being pushed down, [upward mobility has stayed the same since 1970](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/). [However it used to be much better, during the gilded age and up through the 1920s, upward mobility in the US was better than many other countries, including Britain](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~fe2r/papers/Exceptionalism.pdf)

And being poor is incredibly relative in the US. Being poor in the west is nowhere near being poor in Chicago or Detroit. The latter are suffering while the first are probably not seeing any visible signs of poverty(considering those are the happiest and probably cheapest states as well). 

&gt; I thought the social democratic Scandinavian models was considered the best ? 

No? Healthcare in those countries is somewhat dismal; heck the US has a higher life expectancy than Denmark, and we're so much more racially diverse. 

[Before the 1960s those countries were relative more deregulated than the US](http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa-603.pdf). 

Ever since the 1960s the welfare state was growing, until the 1990s when something very unpleasant happened:

&gt;[**The Nordic welfare states seemed to be standing on solidground during the second part of the 1980s. The economy was booming, Denmarkâs economy was recovering, and Sweden and Finland continued to expand their welfare states, as did Norway,which was still beneï¬ting heavily from its oil resources. Under the calm surface, problems piled up. The 1990s started with an economic downturn that in Sweden, and even more so in Finland, developed into a depression. Both countries experi-enced a dramatic increase in unemployment and negative growth. Severe ï¬nancial problems forced both Sweden and Finland to make substantial cuts in their state budgets, a process that is still going on. Again, Norway was hit less hard by economic problems. Denmark also managed to survive the economic downturn much better than Sweden and Finland**](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3A7ZYp-g2iqU8J%3Awww.crop.org%2Fviewfile.aspx%3Fid%3D380+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us)

Why did this happen? The establishment of the welfare state has introduced significant systematic changes: 

&gt;**Since the early 1980s, especially in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, a new tradition of poverty research has become apparent, though it is very limited when compared with the totality of social science research. The rediscovery of poverty is propelled in large part by radical change in the societal situation. For example, in all the Nordic countries a means tested income support system is aimed at those who cannot support themselves in any other way. In the 1980s all four countries experienced an increase in the number of households dependent on this social assistance. This growth was clearly troublesome because it indicated increased difï¬culties in achieving a sufï¬cient labour mar-ket income, while at the same time clearly showing that the universal welfare system was unable to cope with this situation**

[In fact, over the past few years Sweden has been slowly privatizing their healthcare system](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/dec/18/private-healthcare-lessons-from-sweden) And some of these countries have seen government spending drop as a percent of GDP. Their situation is unsustainable. Norway is holding up with giant oil reserves, [but with 21% waiting more than 4 months to get an elective surgery](http://www.quotidianosanita.it/allegati/allegato2476022.pdf)...it's not in a good place.

[It's complicated](http://www.uni-mainz.de/presse/16797_ENG_HTML.php). The reform has seen reduction, but overall its effect hasn't been negative, but rather negligible:

&gt;**The new study by Launov and WÃ¤lde, published in the renowned International Economic Review, looks into various impacts of the Hartz IV reform on the entire German labor market and on the different groups of workers. This study finds that contrary to initial aspirations the contribution of the Hartz IV reform to reducing unemployment in Germany as a whole has been exceptionally low. In fact, the reform can explain only 0.1 percentage point of the post-Hartz decline of the unemployment rate.**

However:

&gt;**Nevertheless, unemployment in Germany has sharply fallen after the whole set of Hartz reforms became legally effective.**

They do say it can partially be due to the previous Hartz reforms(which could account for a drop of 1.3% in unemployment)

But it definitely wasn't a slaughterhouse. It's Germany after all. It's actually kind of funny: The Social Democrats(SDP) were the ones pushing this. Guess the US isn't the only country with a left party going right. 

&gt;The history of unions is slightly different. German unions were really strong (they had a saying on the board of directors) etc. There were lot's of agreements that were not quite right (e.g. the status of foreign workers etc), but the german worker had it good until early 90s. Since then the increases in productivity had gone mostly to capital, with the state effectively subsidizing production.

I don't know about productivity and income decoupling in Germany, but the issue of decoupling is highly misleading given the most popular data used. In the US the BLS adjusts compensation for CPI, and health insurance premiums with PCE. Productivity is adjusted with the implicit price deflator(GDP). [Once adjusted for GDP, productivety and compensation have closely matched in both the UK and US at least, page 19 and 32](http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1246.pdf). You can see why on page 29, CPI has overestimated inflation. [Another study confirms these findings](http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/07/productivity-and-compensation-growing-together). The IPD reflects business goods and services, unlike PCE and CPI which deal with the consumer side, which makes sense given wages and productivity must respond to business limitations and success on the market. This is not to say that the middle class has seen its income grow enough, it hasn't. And that is at least partially due to the increase in health insurance premiums, which are allocated for healthcare goods and not general consumer goods, decreasing personal consumer expenditures on their part.

Because division of labour is even used within a parliament. The different factions have themselves expert MPs in the respective committees that report on different issues and give recommendations to their colleagues. No single MP can deal with every aspect of our countries.

&gt; Regular folks on referendums only vote if they know what they're voting on. There's always public debate previous to the referendum and experts also make their opinions heard.

Questionable, and even if, they are not subject to public scrutiny or re-election. One can be very irresponsible if one doesn't have to justify the decision to anyone.

&gt; According to that logic, it would be best if a bureaucracy chose everything for us, it would be more efficient to have a small more specialised groups making all the choices and we common folk going on with our lives trusting that our politicians care about us and will chose for us better than we'd choose for ourselves.

&gt; Before you know it, we'd throw democracy out of the window and live in an enlightened despotism with a (supposedly) well-intentioned autocrat deciding things for us.

This is what's called the slippery slope fallacy. I argue for representative democracy, you somehow end up at abolishing democracy altogether. It doesn't follow and I don't advocate it.

&gt; Decisions that affect everybody must take into account the opinion of everybody, it would never be legitimate to support democracy when it suits us and trump over it when it doesn't. And politicians are people just like you or me and just like you or me they put their own interests above the interests of everybody else and so regardless of their intentions, it's a recipe for corruption and exploitation when they have the power to choose against the electorate.

Referenda don't take everyone's opinion into account. In fact, they only take into account the winning side's opinion. Representatives, on the other hand, are under public scrutiny and have to justify their decisions to a lot of people. Often, no party has a majority on parliament and has to form coalitions that help make sure that decision do not disadvantage one group too much. There is a lot of literature on that topic, I'm not sure how useful it is to talk about this here.

I will also add that while some of the criticism of Russia may seem unjust in light of other countries where homosexuality is illegal (such as India and Nigeria), a lot of it stems from the fact that Russia is hosting the Winter Olympics at the moment.

Offensichtlich hat die Regierung die GrÃ¶Ãenordnung der Einwanderung viel zu gering geschÃ¤tzt, wovon wohl auch MaÃnahmen zur Integration betroffen sind.

&gt; Employees have a say, what are you talking about? If they are treated badly, they will leave. If their company is run poorly, they can start up their own and take over the market in that area. They can unionize and band together that way. Consumers can choose to shop wherever they want. If enough people stopped shopping at walmart, it would fail. If enough people stopped buying burgers at McDonalds, they would fail. 

This is the most idealistic and absurd claim I've read all day, I don't even know why libertarians and ancaps continue to discredit themselves with ridiculous assumptions like these. 

Do you really believe that workers would dare to form a union when their employer can fire them any time? Do you actually think the majority of costumers knows or cares enough about working conditions in a company to stop giving them money, even when they can't afford to go to their competitor who pays fair wages? I don't even need to make up examples to disprove claims like these, just look at the behaviour of WalMart customers today and tell me how severely the company has been punished by the customers for their bad practices. The only thing that has power in your vision of society is capital, employees and the average customer can do fuck all against employers and corporations if the latter are free to do as they please. 

Competition is not only about efficiency, but also about capital. I can't just compete against a large corporation, because they can afford to undercut me severely before I even manage to grow the business any bigger. 
 

If it weren't for the state, workers would still be in the same situation as in the beginning of the industrial revolution.

2. Your statistics make no sense for a country where almost 50 million don't have access to health care. Indeed US health care is really good IF you can afford it. I don't think elite healthcare for the elite should be the goal. Pre-existing conditions, massive premiums and bankruptsies are the results of a system that caters for the top. 
They also make no sense, because getting hospitalised in most socialised medicine systems is a big thing, whereas the money game might get you in just so money moves around. Same for the number of tests etc.

I have to admit that the text is very hard to read. Basically it states that crime statistics of foreigners cannot be compared with those of German citizens and are misused very often.

* Statistics are used politically. They are used by politicians to prove points (often against immigrants). Furthermore, they have to be interpreted right which is not as easy as it seems.
* These crime reports are often (mis)used to spot differences between Germans and immigrants. This cannot be done this way, since crime statistics only differetiate between people with a German and a foreign citizenship. Note that many people immigrated and have German citizenship. These immigrants with German citizenship tend to be better integrated. People without German citizenship are thus no representative sample. As a result, these comparisons are plain wrong.
* Crime reports only include supects. The people included have only been suspected of a crime but not been convicted.
* People with other ethnicities tend to get reported to the police more often. Thus, crimes of these ethnicities are overrepresented.
* There are several crimes that only foreigners can commit, things like unpermitted residence in Germany. These crimes make up 13.6% of crimes commited by foreigners. Furthermore, there are several types of crimes that foreigners commit far more often (drug import) and other types that they commit less often (damage to property, resistance against authorities)

&gt;Oh no they did try the whole proprietary-entire-pseudo-internet before (a proprietary non-internet network with dialups built from scratch). It was just so shitty next to anything else that people basically laughed them away :
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN#Internet_Start

Back in 1995 it wasn't clear how interesting people would see the larger Internet. Particularly with the lack of good search engine, it was a chaotic place. Also worth remembering that MSN was roughly analogous to that thing AOL did, and from ads I surmise that thing was relevant well into the new millenium. 

&gt;Noop. AOL Offered it [Netscape].

Yes, after AOL bought Netscape in 1998. By that point Netscape had operated as its own company for four or five years already. As this story involves one of the original stories of Microsoft abusing their monopoly, I would have thought you would know of it.

&gt;Stop trying to force insert goddam fuckin ""capitalism"" everywhere &gt;_&lt; . You're reducing the world with that logic to the ""owners"" who own large companies and collect all the money, and the workers who work only to give back immediatly the corporate owners all they have. 

Are you confusing me with somebody else? Because depending on the context, I usually identify myself as a socialist/social democrat and write accordingly and you are acting like I've written a long list of neoliberal shit.

What I said that for a company to have an incentive to develop a product it must be worth it's while somehow. It's better that the product support itself instead of being supported by some other product, because otherwise the development might stagnate or go into the wrong direction. This has nothing to do with capitalist/proletariat-divide. It is, however, fairly basic setting of project goal targets.  

Things also don't really change if instead of a company we have a foundation (or the state, or volunteers) developing something. Linux is a good example where the coders are building a product for themselves and not for the end-users who can't code (which made Linux rather hard to use by a layman for decades).

You can build the product for the users or for the people funding (either with time or money) the production. Generally it's better when the payer and the end-user is the same party - the product ends up serving the needs better. 

&gt;Just please keep that kind of shit out of my continent.

I'm Finnish. As in, born and raised. I know that I tend to refer to ""the continent"" as something you go to, but I do carry a burgundy passport, too. 

&gt;Netscape got money from internet providing. Google from search. MS from Windows. You won't make me believe MS is so starving they need actual extra money to patch the insane number of bugs plaging IE.

As I said, AOL bought Netscape after Microsoft destroyed their model of offering the browser to OEMs. As I remember, Microsoft blackmailed the OEMs with hiking the licence fees if they didn't stop buying Navigator. Opera works with the same way today (with mobile phones funding the desktop ""freeness""). Mozilla gets money this way too, but also by donations. 

But true, the others work the way you describe. But I don't really think this bundling of an important service with a company that has other responsibilities than just offering a good product is a great idea. 

Chrome in particular I find rather suspicious. 


&gt;And now you're saying it yourself. Google wanted people to use a browser that just didn't explode or break in the average user face every time they try merely opening it.

Indeed. But Google has other motives than just giving a great user-experience. For a long time there wasn't a working AdBlocker on Chrome, for example. 

&gt;Face it, the fact that IE was so shitty and full of aircraft-carrier-sized security flaws

I never said that IE5/IE6 wasn't a shitty browser. Just that Microsoft had a reason for putting the development on hiatus back in the day.

&gt;While it was free, it was just borderline unusable

Well, I used it. At that point Netscape Navigator was completely unusable (not ""borderline"") and IE6 was shitty (just as you said). When I got money, I gave money for the very small Norwegian company that made a product I liked to use and got rid of the ads. 

&gt;Damn neocapitalism always just trying to get every last dollars out of you like vampires.

**NÃ¼rnberg:**
Most people know NÃ¼rnberg for its Nazi history and the trails (the court room can be visited), but it also has a great history, it became a very rich city in the medival times because the trade route to italy passed by.

* [Castle of NÃ¼rnberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) : From there you have a nice view overlooking the city, and it is one of the most important castles in europe because of it's history.

* The market with its golden fountain (SchÃ¶ner Brunnen) and it's Weihnachtsmarkt (in the weeks before christmas)

* [Nazi party rally grounds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_party_rally_grounds): Well, the title tells it. Adolf Hitler built a large rally ground there and you can still see the remains and visit a museum that will give you an insight on the cruelties and his insane mind.

* [FelsengÃ¤nge NÃ¼rnberg](http://www.felsengaenge-nuernberg.de/en/our-organisation.html) (They forgot to translate the text on the frontpage, but the rest should be fine) are tunnels and bunkers, storages etc. under the whole city. Some are from the 14th century and were used as storages to keep the beer cool. During WWII, many of them under the old city centre and the castle got connected and were used as bunkers and there were plans to install factories there, too. There were a ton of art stored in these bunkers during WWII. There is also an Bunker under the train station from the cold war era. One of my special recommendations!

* In the [Handwerkerhof](http://www.handwerkerhof.de/en/home.html) you can see how craftsmen create tradtitional products from the area in an medivial environment.

* NÃ¼rnberg is also home of [Albrecht DÃ¼rer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrect_Durer), one of the most important painter/mathmatican/... of medival europe, you can visit his house and see some of his art in the 

* [Germanisches Nationalmuseum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanisches_Nationalmuseum): Well the largest museum of german history &amp;amp; culture. It's very interesting, you can see there works from great german artists (like DÃ¼rer or Rembrandt ...), but also medivial weapons &amp;amp; armors, other technical stuff like the oldest known globe from 1492 and the oldest known globe with america on it from 1520, etc.

* [Neues Museum NÃ¼rnberg](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neues_Museum_N%C3%BCrnberg) has a great collection of modern and contemporary art and design, for example Andy Warhol.

* [Peter Heinlein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Henlein), one of the first people who built pocketwatches 

* [Lebkuchen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebkuchen) is also a franconian/nuremburg thing

* In the time before christmas: Christkildemarkt + GlÃ¼hwein!

* NÃ¼rnberg has a soccer team and a icehockey team in the highest german leagues, also.

* ADIDAS and PUMA have their headquarters and big outlet shopping centres in the small town of Herzogenaurach, 25km north-west of Nuremberg. If you want to go shopping for cheap sportswear (and more), you should consider a visit. Also if you are interested in [modern](http://www.vb.com/puma/puma-hq-herzogenaurach-m.jpg) [architecture](http://www.herzogenaurach.de/typo3temp/pics/e9cc906d7d.jpg).

**Bamberg:**

* The city itself is about 1400 years old, and also called franconian Rome, as it is built on seven hills like rome. It's *world heritage* as it was not damaged in WWII and therefore has an unique euopean medivial town centre. Actually the whole old town is world heritage with over 1200 single buildings...  

* The [cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Cathedral) there is a over thousand years old. There are the tombs of one Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (Heinrich II. 973 - 1024) and one Pope (Clement II. 1005-1047), which is the only tomb of a pope noth of the alps.

* Right next to the Cathedral, there is the [""Alte Hofhaltung""](http://www.emiksch.de/Lions/2007/Bilder/slides/Bamberg_Alte_Hofhaltung.jpg) where they shot a few scenes from the three muskeers (from 2011, with orlando bloom etc.)

* The [Old city hall, altes Rathaus](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altes_Rathaus_%28Bamberg%29) was built IN the river, because the Bishop was forced to allow the people to build one, but did not give them land where they could), also this building can be seen in the movie ""the three musketeers""

* [Little Venice](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein-Venedig_%28Bamberg%29), mentioned above

* You get the best [view over the whole city](http://home.arcor.de/pahaschi/Bamberg/Blick_auf_Bamberg.jpg) from the terraces of [Michelsberg Abbey](http://www.travelwriter.at/pic/049/bamberg-kloster-michaelsberg-020331g.jpg) (Kolster Michelsberg), and former Abbey, where you find a nice restaurant/cafe today. There is also the [franconian brewery museum](http://www.brauereimuseum.de/) there.

* [Claus von Stauffenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg) had his regiment there and his widow lived in bamberg till she passed away in 2006. He was leading the plot to kill Hitler.

* Bierkeller which are like bavarian beergardens, I recomment you go to the Spezialbierkeller or [""Spezi Bierkeller""](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=49.884757,10.887499&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18) as you'll have a [superb view over Bamberg](http://www.spezial-keller.de/index_files/stacks_image_44.jpg) and can enjoy one of the best beers of the world ;)  If you want to do it local style, bring your own food and only buy the beer there. **I would not recommend this in the winter, quite cold outside**
If you have time, watch the sunset there, enjoy some beer and have classic franconian food like Bratwurst, SchÃ¤uferla (my recommendation, try it at least once!!!) or Schweinebraten.

* Bamberg is maybe the only place in the world, where you can enjoy some [beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoked_beer) like it was centuries ago.  I recommend the [Schlenkerla Rauchbier here](http://maps.google.de/maps?q=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.891835,10.884941&amp;amp;spn=0.004016,0.010568&amp;amp;num=30&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=de&amp;amp;hq=schlenkerla+rauchbier&amp;amp;hnear=0x47a1f8c7d57c34a1:0x41eda32beb5c7d0,Erlangen&amp;amp;cid=0,0,13639531393304887358&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=17), or the [Spezi Rauchbier](https://maps.google.de/maps?q=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;hl=de&amp;amp;ll=49.896912,10.893111&amp;amp;spn=0.001994,0.005284&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;channel=fflb&amp;amp;hq=spezi+bamberg&amp;amp;radius=15000&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=18). Right there you will also find the FÃ¤ssla, where you can enjoy some great beer too.
If you leave the ""Schlenkerla"", turn right you can enjoy the Nightlife of Bamberg. You will find there many US citizens, as Bamberg has the Warner Barracks with over 3000 soldiers.

* Bamberg has a Baskteball team in the highest german league.  It's the dominating team of the last years and also playing in the european league. 

* Bamberg is a University Town with currently about 12k Students (at 70k people), so you'll find young people everywhere.

Also, on your trip from Nuremberg to Bamberg, you will pass Buttenheim, the birthplace of **[Levi Strauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss)**, inventor of the famous [LEVI Jeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Levi%27s_506_back_pocket.jpg) where you can visit a museum. There are also two good breweries where you can eat really good too. I would recommend ""SchÃ¤uferla"" :)

**WÃ¼rzburg:**

* [WÃ¼rzburger Residenz](http://www.grand-i-tour.de/de/images/git_wuerzburgresi13.jpg) Also some scenes from the three musketeers were shot here

* [Feste Marienburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Festung-Marienberg_1409_10_11.jpg)
WÃ¼rzburg is in the centre of [franconian wine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia_%28wine_region%29), which is known for its [Bocksbeutel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bocksbeutel.jpg)

* WÃ¼rzburg has a Basketball team in the highest german league.

* The University of WÃ¼rzburg has about 25k students enrolled, the city if full of them ;)

**Bayreuth:** 

* [The Opara House is Unesco world heritage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margravial_Opera_House)(also change to german version to see the asonishing inside of the opera house) and it's the city of Wagner (Ride of the Valkyries)

* [The Eremitage](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eremitage_%28Bayreuth%29) wiki only in german, but the pictures are what you are going to see

* Bayreuth has a Basketball team in the highest german league. As you see, franconia is quite strong in german basketball with 3 teams.

**Franconian Switzerland / Little Switzerland**
Also, franconia is relatively cheap to live (0,5 litre of beer: beginning at 1,50â¬), and the [franconian switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconian_Switzerland) is one of the oldest touristic regions in germany. It's famous for its beer, its bakeries and 
butchers. It is also called land of the castles sometimes, as there are very many of them. 
You can discover it best by car, but there are is a list of [bus lines](http://vgn.de/freizeitlinien/) (german link) that are esp. for recreational/free time destinations like wildlife parks or hiking from may 1st till november. Click ""herunterladen (PDF)"" to download a pdf with a map and images to see what to expect and maybe use google translate (google translate did not work on the homepage when I tried it, so i recommend the pdf ""workaround""). Here is a [map of the region with public transport lines](http://www.vgn.de/ib/site/documents/media/f387bb36-6624-65dd-c17b-5cde6c7b84f4.jpg/VG_Freizeit_Prospekt.jpg) that are interesting for tourists, green are regular routes, purple routes are weekend and holiday only and only in the summer while orange are weekend only during the whole year. If you need help to find the right trip, message me and I'll translate and help you to find the busses etc.

* [AufseÃ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufse%C3%9F) is the village with the highest density of breweries in the world, there are 4 breweries for only 1351 people.
Also the founder of the german national museum in Nuremberg, Hans von und zu AufseÃ, Knight of the Empire and his family had (and still have) their castle (well, actually two castles) there and live there. 

* [Sanspareil](http://www.bayreuth-wilhelmine.de/bilder/sanspareil/felsentheater480.jpg) is a Park created by Wilhelmine von Bayreuth, the sister of Frederick the great. You'll find the [MorgenlÃ¤ndischer Bau](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sanspareil_-_Morgenl%C3%A4ndischer_Bau.jpg) there and the [castle of the village](http://www.wonsees.de/geschichte/Sanspareil850J/Bilder/Burg_Zwernitz.jpg) is nice, too.

* The Wiesenttal (Valley of the river Wiesent) is very nice too, you'll find some [ruins of castles](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burgruine_Neideck_05112008.JPG) and scenic rocks there, and it's right next to the autobahn from Nuremberg to Bamberg.

* At the entrance to the Wiesenttal you'll find the [Walberla](http://www.walberla.de/uploads/images/walberla-niedlingi.jpg) (or EhrenbÃ¼rg) hill, which is one of the most important hills in the area. First settlements on the hill date back till the stone age, and you can still see remains of the wall which surrounded the whole plateau from about 500 B.C.


**Traditional Food** you can expect in the region:
Aside from the famous [NÃ¼rnberger](http://www.nuernberger-bratwuerste.de/images/bilder/Gerichte_Feuer/46Bratwurst_20110812_437_kleiner_6%20mit%20Kraut.jpg), you should try [FrÃ¤nkisches SchÃ¤uferla](http://www.frankenalb.de/uploads/pics/schaeufele_008_01.jpg) or [Saure Zipfel](http://www.antenne.de/cf/services/img/ccadd//470xx/4112797.jpg). [Spargel](http://www.spargel.net/images/spargel-mit-schinken.jpg) is also very common here. [FrÃ¤nkischer Sauerbraten](http://autoimg.kochbar.de/kbrezept/45625_17700/400x266/rezept-sauerbraten-mit-lebkuchensosse-bild-nr-7.jpg) is a speciality, as there is gingerbread in the sauce. [Krenfleisch](http://www.genussregion.oberfranken.de/images_gen/spezialitaeten_bilder/716_big.jpg) has a sauce of horseradish. As side dishes, [Wirsing / Savoy cabbage](http://www.das-sonnenkorn.de/assets/images/wirsing.jpg), [Sauerkraut](http://www.marions-kochbuch.de/rezept/0283.jpg) or [Blaukraut](http://www.kostenlose-rezepte.eu/upload/Blaukraut-657.jpg) are the way to go next to the mandatory KloÃ / KnÃ¶del which are either [KartoffelklÃ¶Ãe/knÃ¶del](http://bavariaundercover.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/kloss.jpg) (made of potatoes) or [SemmelkloÃ/knÃ¶del](http://www.essen-und-trinken.de/uploads/thumbnails/0009/00000000009/1024x1024/FeineSemmelknoedel_4f5e90da3a46fd18d55c0d07f683cbba_fjt2009040391.jpg)(made of bread rolls). As a dessert, you should try [KniekÃ¼chle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/K%C3%BCchla.JPG).

As drinks, try one of the [franconian white wines](http://www.bad-boys-on-tour.de/sommerhausen/bilder/bocksbeutel.jpg) in their characteristic bottles or one of the countless beers of the [region with the highest density of breweries in the world](http://www.franken-sind-keine-baiern.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Deutschland_Bier_Nebenkarte.jpg)

**Breweries I would recommend, although all are great:**

* Brauerei Wagner in Merkendorf
* Brauerei Goldener LÃ¶we in Buttenheim (where the Levi Strauss museum is)
* Schlenkerla in Bamberg (The Rauchbier - that means Smoked beer- is a famous speciality, tastes like bacon) 
* FÃ¤ssla in Bamberg
* Grasser in Huppendorf
* Klosterbrauerei in Weissenohe (founded 1050, one of the oldest breweries in germany, great food also!)

(Typical beer types in the region are ""helles"" and ""dunkles"", but also ""MÃ¤rzen"" or ""Bockbier"")

Please don't try to imply the Constitutional Treaty is different to the Lisbon Treaty because of some cosmetic changes. Academics, sceptics and europhiles all agree the treaties are almost identical. You can always tell you are arguing with a fraud when a spotty pimpled know-nothing tries to say those two treaties are different, even the authors of the documents say they are not different.  

There is ONLY one logical conclusion that can be reached from that fact is that the French and the Dutch had forced on them something *which they had specifically voted against*. Not ""perfectly democratic"" more like ""technically legal, but against the express wishes of the people"".  

Also, all three major parties in the UK promised a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty and then broke those promises and we got Lisbon without a vote. Yes they *legally* can break a campaign promise, but that doesn't make it ""perfectly democratic"". ""Legal"" can mean almost anything, Kim Jong-un killing people in North Korea is legal.  

There's no way around this, I've had this argument on /r/europe many times. The only arguments you eurofederalists have is to try to split hairs on technicalities and argue that decisions of elected MPs are greater than a vote by the people, which is not democratic, or you reveal your true hideous nature and finally put the EU cards truly on the table which is when you argue against democracy itself. Every eurofederalist will protest and protest they believe in democracy until you corner them with the logical contradictions between believing in the EU and believing in democracy, usually at that point they start foaming at the mouth ranting about the flaws of democracy and how the people are stupid and we need a European Reich. Why? Because technocrats. Tell the people about the wonderful technocratic CAP and the wonderful technocratic euro.

&gt; Puoi elaborare su questo, perfavore?

ci provo. 
Il Fatto Ã¨ un giornale che vedo spesso in mano a molti giovani, mi sembra abbia il ruolo che aveva il Manifesto quando io ero liceo (una sorta di collante identitario per una certa area culturale di sinistra).
Solo che, a differenza del Manifesto, il Fatto ha una linea conservatrice e manettara che ha portato su posizioni retrograde tanti ragazzi, quasi inconsapevolmente.

A questo si aggiunge il fatto che non ha un orizzonte ampio, le pagine culturali sono desolanti, le firme principali sono dei giornalisti rancorosi che si sentono investiti di una qualche missione altissima (siamo i piÃ¹ puri! gli unici difensori della costituzione! neanche un euro di finanziamento pubblico! - come se fosse una cosa buona, io sono A FAVORE dei finanziamenti all'editoria).

In piÃ¹ da quando c'Ã¨ Grillo Ã¨ diventato, tecnicamente, nei fatti, un giornale di partito, e anche tra i piÃ¹ oltranzisti (vedevo piÃ¹ critiche al PDS su l'UnitÃ  di quante ne vedo sul Fatto verso i 5s).

Per questo mi sembra stia coltivando una generazione di ebeti con il cervello all'ammasso, convinti che il mondo inizi e finisca in una visione complottarda della storia italiana (dalle teorie travagliane sul doppio stato, all'idea che tutti i mali siano riconducibili a silvione nostro).

Maybe you can't/shouldn't make money on a browser alone and it shouldn't be a business by itself alone. Other big browser exist because they are like you said a bundle with other services. For example if the Opera's dev had tried bundle with linux they could have gotten a lot of money fast to devellop a good browser earlier on that system then port it to windows. Or maybe they could have gone to a big local network provider too (but then i don't know providers in finland so can't say here... just hazarding a gues).

&gt; But I don't really think this bundling of an important service with a company that has other responsibilities than just offering a good product is a great idea. 

How so ? I disagree here.

The different factions have themselves expert MPs in the respective committees that report on different issues and give recommendations to their colleagues. No single MP can deal with every aspect of our countries.

And politicians have this great record in knowing exactly what they vote on! It's not like they often not even read the laws they pass!

&gt;Questionable, and even if, they are not subject to public scrutiny or re-election.

And yet in the real world the majority of people are very disillusioned with their politics and power only alternates between two major parties. Accountability by politicians is a joke. Since you're a German, please do tell me what your ""accountable"" politicians are doing regarding GEMA.

&gt;This is what's called the slippery slope fallacy. I argue for representative democracy, you somehow end up at abolishing democracy altogether. It doesn't follow and I don't advocate it.

For someone who basically said ""we can't trust people with referendums because voters are ignorant, power must be on the hands of politicians because bureaucrats are enlightened"", yep, you do are arguing against democracy. You're either for democracy or against democracy, there's no middle-ground of only supporting democracy when it suits you, that's what's called being an hypocrite.

&gt;Referenda don't take everyone's opinion into account. In fact, they only take into account the winning side's opinion.

Same thing with politicians.

&gt; Representatives, on the other hand, are under public scrutiny and have to justify their decisions to a lot of people.

What a joke. Representatives only care about themselves and if they keep quiet they can go their whole career fucking up constantly behind the scenes and making things harder for everybody else.

&gt; And politicians have this great record in knowing exactly what they vote on! It's not like they often not even read the laws they pass!

If you know a politician doesn't know what he's voting on, you shouldn't re-elect him. Sounds fairly easy.

&gt; And yet in the real world the majority of people are very disillusioned with their politics and power only alternates between two major parties. Accountability by politicians is a joke. Since you're a German, please do tell me what your ""accountable"" politicians are doing regarding GEMA.

I'm politically active in the Pirate Party and I can tell you that most Germans do find GEMA annoying but not enough. There is not enough public interest to push politicians. I also don't see what this is supposed to prove.

&gt; For someone who basically said ""we can't trust people with referendums because voters are ignorant, power must be on the hands of politicians because bureaucrats are enlightened"", yep, you do are arguing against democracy.

Nowhere did I say that. I simply pointed out that running a government is no less challenging than other tasks in our modern society and requires full time attention.

&gt; You're either for democracy or against democracy, there's no middle-ground of only supporting democracy when it suits you, that's what's called being an hypocrite.

I unconditionally support constitutional representative democracy. I see no hypocrisy in that. Tocqueville discusses the difficulty of balancing the interests of the individual and those of the majority in his book Democracy in America. I can only recommend it.

&gt; What a joke. Representatives only care about themselves and if they keep quiet they can go their whole career fucking up constantly behind the scenes and making things harder for everybody else.

Well, no. That only works if civil society sleeps.

&gt; When it is a choice that affects the lives of all the people, then all the people must have a voice. I don't care how much the guy selling me a car knows about cars, if I'm the one buying it I should have the choice. Same thing with politicians, I don't give two shits what excuse they make up for spending money on x or y, if I as a taxpayer don't want them to waste my money, I should have that choice!

Well, Opera is still in business, so that tactic worked for them well enough. I find it very curious that for a Leftist guy you are promoting semi-monopolies over small companies just so that you can save few bucks on a short-term. 

I don't know how much into ideology you are, but the distinction between capitalists (eg. those who could just hire others to do their work), the bourgeois (who could work for themselves) and the proletariat (who had to work for others) is often seen as important. Anyway, democracy works better if we have small bourgeois-owned companies and less capitalist-owned ones. 

&gt;&gt;But I don't really think this bundling of an important service with a company that has other responsibilities than just offering a good product is a great idea.

&gt;How so ? I disagree here.

Well, as I said, Chrome for the longest of times didn't have an AdBlocker because Google makes their money with ads. There's always a question how much more data Chrome sends to Google than it's absolutely necessary for the operation of the browser. More exactly, I'm interested (or ""concerned"") of the code that's not released as part of the Chromium Project. I think you could only change the default search engine to something other than Google only fairly recently.

Internet Explorer 3, 4, 5 were great browsers but they weren't standard compliant because Microsoft was using the browser to kick the competition out of the market (namely, Netscape, which finally had to sell itself to AOL). Because Internet was becoming more and more of a selling point for getting a computer, you had a situation where where webpages were optimised for browser that wasn't available for other systems than Windows (and OS X when Microsoft owned a part of Apple). So Explorer was part of the operating system lock-down.

After Netscape became part of AOL, AOL bundled it with email, search etc. that directed to their services etc. 

&gt;It allowed (and still do) anyone to just connect to the net, open their own site and try their own stuff.

Back then it was thought that Internet was too confusing for the layperson, so there was demand for a walled garden (as AOL shows, they were right). As I recall, Microsoft didn't try to limit anybody from connecting to the WWW. They were just tools for different uses.

[Aus der Frankfurter Rundschau:](http://www.fr-online.de/politik/volksabstimmung-schweiz-die-schweiz-will-sich-abschotten,1472596,26137512.html)

&gt;EU-ParlamentsprÃ¤sident Martin Schulz hat am Sonntag nochmal fÃ¼r Europa geworben. Doch genÃ¼tzt hat es wenig, die Schweizer wollen den Zuzug von EU-BÃ¼rgern in ihre heile Welt beschrÃ¤nken. [...]

&gt;Der SPD-Europapolitiker lobte die sachliche Debatte im Vorfeld der Abstimmung und erklÃ¤rte:     
*âEs ist nicht von der Hand zu weisen, dass die Einwanderung Probleme mit sich bringt.* Die Schweiz wird dabei in gewisser Weise zum Opfer ihrer wirtschaftlichen StÃ¤rke. Sie zieht als eines der weltweit erfolgreichsten LÃ¤nder neue Unternehmen und Arbeitnehmer an.â

Aus der [Wikipedia zur ""Bilateralen"" EU-Schweiz:](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilaterale_VertrÃ¤ge_zwischen_der_Schweiz_und_der_EU)

&gt;Globalisierungskritiker, linke Politiker und Gewerkschaften, aber auch die BundesbehÃ¶rden, Arbeitgebervertreter und Kantone haben negative Folgen der PersonenfreizÃ¼gigkeit thematisiert. BefÃ¼rchtet wird beispielsweise die Umgehung von Schweizer Gesetzen Ã¼ber Umweltschutz und Arbeitsschutz sowie der durch die Migration von ArbeitskrÃ¤ften von NiedriglohnlÃ¤ndern in die Schweiz entstehende Lohndruck, als dessen Folge Lohndumping befÃ¼rchtet wird. Als Gefahr fÃ¼r kleine und mittlere Unternehmen werden vor allem ScheinselbststÃ¤ndigkeiten wahrgenommen. Gegen diese Probleme sieht die Schweizer Gesetzgebung die oben beschriebenen Â«flankierenden MassnahmenÂ» vor. Diese wiederum kritisiert die EU.

[In einem weiteren Artikel der Frankfurter Rundschau](http://www.fr-online.de/meinung/schweiz-volksabstimmung-angst-vor-fremdbestimmung-in-der-schweiz,1472602,26140932.html) findet sich etwas, was in der Diskussion auf Nicht-Schweizer Seite offenbar niemand interessiert, aber fÃ¼r die Schweizer mit ihrer direkten Demokratie viel entscheidender sein kÃ¶nnte als die angebliche ""diffuse Angst vor dem Fremden"": 

demokratische Selbstbestimmung.

&gt;Und was die Fremdbestimmung betrifft, machen sich die Schweizer zu Recht sorgen. Immer mehr Verordnungen und Gesetze, die in BrÃ¼ssel beschlossen werden, mÃ¼ssen sie schlicht Ã¼bernehmen.

&gt;Dieses Verfahren heiÃt in der Eidgenossenschaft ganz offiziell âautonomer Nachvollzugâ. Es ist ein Euphemismus, weil der Nachvollzug nur dem Schein nach autonom ist. 

Die Ãbernahme der unbegrenzten FreizÃ¼gigkeit von Arbeitnehmern innerhalb der EU ist so âautonomer Nachvollzugâ.

&gt;Mitzubestimmen hat zudem die Schweiz in BrÃ¼ssel gar nichts, weil sie der EU nicht beitreten wollte. Und heute erst recht nicht will. In Zeiten der Euro-Krise wÃ¼rden Beitrittsgegner jede Volksabstimmung glatt gewinnen. Im EU-Apparat gibt es ein evidentes Defizit an demokratischer Kontrolle. Den Schweizern aber ist ihre direkte Demokratie heilig. *Das Parlament kontrolliert die Regierung, und die BÃ¼rger kontrollieren notfalls beide.*

Das gibt es in der EU schlicht nicht, und ein Weg dorthin ist auch nicht in AnsÃ¤tzen zu erkennen.

If the problems with the eurozone had been resolved by now I doubt very much that the Swiss would have felt it necessary to take this step.

The knock on effect of the eurozone's inability to fix their own problems have pushed the Swiss to this position. I think what you're seeing in Switzerland and I think increasingly in the UK is that people keep being told that the EU is essential and that ""we can't live without it"" and yet the eurozone in particular has been generating constant bad headlines for almost four years now, economies that have gone further and faster with integration into the euro are same ones who seem constantly mired in low growth and high unemployment. Even those countries which never had any kind of financial problems in the first place have been at or near recession due to contagion from those with more serious problems who can't seem to fix them.

""Making an example of them"" might just end up proving it's possible to go it alone. If the Swiss can survive outside of the EU then the UK sure as hell can.

&gt; The dialect you refer to is spoken in a single town of Sardinia called ""Carloforte"", people there have their roots in a part of Genova called ""Genova Pegli"".

It is spoken over the whole San Pietro island and on the northern tip of the Sant'Antioco island (around Calasetta), just like depicted on the map. You're right that the people living there have their roots in Pegli. But before moving to Sardinia, they lived for some 200 years in Tabarca (now Tunisia), hence the name ""dialetto tabarchino"". 

&gt; The south part of Sardinia also has a Cagliaritano and Logudorese dialects.

Actually, Logudorese is spoken only in the northern half of Sardinia, not in the south. And it is Campidanese which is spoken in the south, not Cagliaritano (spoken just in and around Cagliari).

&gt; The dialect in Liguria is Genovese, which may change a bit in the whole Liguria, but it's still Genovese, it's variations of Genovese, not Ligure.

TIL - Is it called Genovese and not Ligure because the region of Liguria was in fact the Repubblica di Genova in the past? 

&gt; As for Sardinia, that huge part on the bottom where it say ""Sardinian"" is just plain wrong, because when it comes to Sardinia the dialects are not just simple variations, they're very much different.

I totally agree with you that from that point of view the map generalizes too much. Never said anything different. Nonetheless, no matter how different, you can still find similarities in the Logudorese and Campidanese dialects all across Sardinia and that's why people from different areas can understand each other.

Official MS answer was that since TCP/IP wasn't inbuilt and you added it throught patchs it was ""consistent"" to ~~harass you about~~ suggest dialer to link the computer.

Oh and IE ? Basically it was preconfigured to not connect on the internet, but TMN only. And even if you did stumbled on the internet throught a cd kit, it would lead you straigth to http://home.microsoft.com or http://msn.com on most systems anyway, IIRC.

Oh and then there was the FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt. Basically spreading disinfo and made up bullshit) to scare away people from the internet ""full of virus and dangerous scamers."" they spread. basically running their argument on ""avoid it or you'll loose your computer and money !"" and targeting parents and older senors who where the ones buying computers in the family.

&gt; I don't know how much into ideology you are, but the distinction between capitalists (eg. those who could just hire others to do their work), the bourgeois (who could work for themselves) and the proletariat (who had to work for others) is often seen as important.

If you want to go that way, you forgot the part where nobody asked proletarian to do everything for nothing and shut up and don't be able to do shit about it and where the capitalists/bourgeois mostly inherited their position from their parents. It's no different than the clergy/nobility/serf system. In fact it's exactly the same one reinstated worldwide last generation by Reagan &amp; co and the fuckin CIA overthrowing legitimate govs left &amp; right to put his dictator buddies in place everywhere; who'de do everything for that one more dollar.

I believe so, recently some people started calling the Genovese dialect ""Ligurian"", that isn't right, they're just changing the name because Genovese is spoken in the whole region with variations and I presume they dislike the idea of calling the dialect they speak with a name that recall just one specific city.    
&gt;It is spoken over the whole San Pietro island and on the northern tip of the Sant'Antioco island (around Calasetta), just like depicted on the map. You're right that the people living there have their roots in Pegli. But before moving to Sardinia, they lived for some 200 years in Tabarca (now Tunisia), hence the name ""dialetto tabarchino"".

Or their well known and documented habit of taking customers for mental retards and force to use their position to whore the customer to make even more money. The list they tried to force down customers one way or another includes things like :

- trying making email (a free communication protocol) paying (to microsoft, off course) ""but it's for your own good to fight spam"" : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3324883.stm

- Or recently forcing xbox one customers to keep the console online alltime with an alltime watching and recording kinect on top of it and alltime recording or the console would just shut down and they-would-never-sell-the-data-to-the-NSA-honest :

They basically only stopped that one when they got  (market) ""death"" threats from their international suppliers and entire community due to bad timing or even condescending arrogance (snowden leaks + forced camera in your living room = people thinking it might be a bad idea. MS openly answered with ""[just deal with it](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/05/microsoft-creative-director-on-always-online-deal-with-it)"" and got so many people angry they basically suicided half their plans on that one and prolly lost half the market and is why the PS4 while technically inferior burried them alive).

It should be fairly easy to observe if Xbox One is sending data over Internet. Anyway, it's a good idea to plug these machines out of the wall (or have a switch you can turn to cut energy) when not in use to save electricity.

&gt;* The unrest was the subject of debate at the Munich Security Conference last weekend

&gt;* Joerg Forbrig says EU and U.S. comments there signify a change in Western policy

&gt;* A ""Ukrainian Plan"" must include emergency aid and assistance for broader reforms, he says

----------------------------------------------------------

&gt;*(CNN)* -- Not surprisingly, the Munich Security Conference last weekend saw heated debates on Ukraine and its current political crisis. Yet while government and opposition representatives faced off with their well-known positions, the real news was an apparent change of minds among Western leaders.

&gt;Thus, European Union Commissioner Stefan Fule stated that ""if we are serious about helping this part of Europe to transform, the association agreement is only the first step,"" admitting in effect that only the EU's ""most powerful instrument"", membership, will help in the long-term.

&gt;EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton added that Europe and the U.S. are ""developing a plan -- a Ukrainian Plan"", whose numbers ""won't be small"", to provide urgently needed short-term funding to Ukraine's battered economy. And U.S Secretary of State John Kerry stressed that ""nowhere is the fight for a democratic, European future more important today than in Ukraine"". Taken together, the three statements may signal a major shift in Western policy vis-a-vis Ukraine.

----------------------------------------------------------

&gt;Western indecision clearly played its role in aggravating the political crisis in Ukraine, as it emboldened the government of Victor Yanukovych while driving protesters to despair. As a result, the former essentially attempted to legalize dictatorial rule and, when this prompted further demonstrations, resorted to violence by riot police.

--------------------------------------------------

&gt;In order for necessary reforms to start and succeed, the EU and the U.S. have to swiftly roll out a ""Ukrainian Plan"", as alluded to by Baroness Ashton. A comprehensive aid package must combine emergency funding to prevent an impending default of Ukraine, compensations for a likely economic retaliation by Russia, and assistance for broader market reforms.",1,1391996448,null,0,false,0,cfbbv1a,t3_1xhc4d,t1_cfbbv1a,t3_1xhc4d,null,1432328104,-4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-4

This mechanism is the guillotine clause, because it cancels every treaty at once, and Switzerland will be ejected from the single market entirely. It's a way of giving Switzerland technical sovereignty over the matter, but in reality they're held by the balls and apply everything the EU throws at them.

true,xdey,POLA,Polska,"&gt; I don't want to be offensive, but your posts do show that you live in a country with comparably weak civil society and corrupt establishment. That is what's broken. This is what needs fixing.

It's all about incentives. Portugal has much more corruption than Switzerland ever had because in Portugal there was ever more power in the hands of politicians and less in the hands of the population.

It's like this now with our social democracy, it was like this when we were a authoritarian corporatist state and it was like this when we were an autocratic feudal society. May I remind you that the same thing happened in Germany, be it with the DDR, the Weimar Republic, the German Empire or the feudal states in the HRE. It's not about the smoke and mirrors explanation of ""civil society"".

That's what I admire about Switzerland, they've always had a more direct approach to democracy and they're (one of) the least corrupt countries and (one of) the best countries to live in, and in there the power of politicians was always kept in check by their direct democracy.

Representative democracy should mean that the politicians are there to represent the population, not to substitute them, and it seems to me you want them to do just that. True liberty also means the freedom to do bad choices, and while I also disagree with the outcome of this Swiss vote, we have to accept it, if it doesn't work out for them, I'm sure they'll fix it - which is more than what our politicians would ever do, to fix our problems.

&gt;If you know a politician doesn't know what he's voting on, you shouldn't re-elect him. Sounds fairly easy.

That's about all of them. Have you ever even bothered to watch the assembly channel? I'm not even going to talk about the Portuguese one where the vast majority of the deputies don't even bother to show up and they keep getting re-elected, we could both discuss [what's going on on the European Parliament](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9BC7BlfJfY). 

Yeah, good luck voting those guys out of office. Geez, it's like you don't even bother to check what you're defending.

&gt;I'm politically active in the Pirate Party and I can tell you that most Germans do find GEMA annoying but not enough. There is not enough public interest to push politicians. I also don't see what this is supposed to prove.

It's supposed to prove that while the vast majority of people are against such a measure, it's still shoved down everyone's throats because it's not that big of a nuisance. Just another instance of politicians fucking up the people in favour of their own interests, in this case being lobbied by the copyrights groups.

That kind of shit would never fly in Switzerland, there voters and not politicians hold sovereignty.

&gt;Nowhere did I say that. I simply pointed out that running a government is no less challenging than other tasks in our modern society and requires full time attention.

If you're looking for politicians to pay full time attention to running a society, then you're definitely looking in the wrong place.

&gt;I unconditionally support constitutional representative democracy. I see no hypocrisy in that.

What you support is not representative democracy as you clearly disapprove of the will of the people and think they can't choose what's best for them. Representatives are meant to represent and not supposed to substitute the electors.

&gt;Tocqueville discusses the difficulty of balancing the interests of the individual and those of the majority in his book Democracy in America. I can only recommend it.

Some [Morgan Freeman](http://i.imgur.com/m3Keziu.jpg) for you.

&gt;Well, no. That only works if civil society sleeps.

I'm guessing the German society is sleeping then with regards to GEMA and all the other bullshit programs. And I'm guessing all Europeans are sleeping when it comes to CAP and all the other bullshit programs. Now that I think of it, all the Western hemisphere must be sleeping. I'm guessing we should make Sandman the leader of the free world since all of our societies are always sleeping.

&gt;You have. Vote for a party that won't spend money on that or found a party yourself.

Or instead of having to deal with those artificial barriers, hold a referendum and let the actual people and not the representatives of the people decide.

&gt;Don't force others to invest so much time into the operations of government just because you have missed the last few millennia of democratic development.

Nobody forces you to vote and nobody is arguing for abolishing representative democracy. The only thing that's required is to make sure the voters and not the ""representatives"" have the final say. Like in Switzerland where politicians can focus on managing the country but the population can always step in when they step out of line and choose for themselves and not unlike pretty much every other country where the people are for the most part defenceless and have to just take it.

Vermutlich meinst du *Argumentum ab auctoritate*?  

&gt;Ganz besonders dann, wenn es gar kein Argument ist, sondern eine vage Behauptung.

Es war die EinrÃ¤umung eines prominenten Europolitikers und Gegners der Volksabstimmung, daÃ die starke Einwanderung in die Schweiz auch negative Folgen gehabt hat. 

Wenn dir das zu vage ist, was sind dann:

&gt;Die diffuse Angst vor dem Fremden ist schon lange da

&gt;Das ist kein absurdes jÃ¤hrliches Wachstum mit dem man nicht klarkommen kÃ¶nnte.

Auch nicht sehr konkretâ¦

&gt;Und was hat das damit zu tun, welchen konkreten Effekt der AuslÃ¤nderanteil in der Schweiz hat?

Die EntmÃ¼ndigung der Schweizer in dieser Frage durch einen Vertrag, bei dem die EU aufgrund ihrer Wirtschaftsmacht die Bedingungen diktieren kann, obwohl sie weitaus weniger demokratisch legitimiert ist als die Schweiz.

Der so stark gewachsene AuslÃ¤nderanteil ist eine Konsequenz der Vertrag-gewordenen Unterordnung der Schweiz unter die EU. 

Zugespitzt gesagt genehmigt sich die EU das Recht, die Schweiz politisch zu entmÃ¼ndigen, und zur Besiedelung durch EU-BÃ¼rger freizugeben.

&gt;Die Schweizer sollen darÃ¼ber entscheiden. 

Das haben sie, wofÃ¼r sie nun hier und anderswo verteufelt werden. 

Direkte Demokratie ist offenbar nur dann akzeptabel, wenn sie so wie von offizieller Seite, also den politischen Eliten, gewÃ¼nscht entscheidet. Ansonsten wird die GÃ¼ltigkeit der Entscheidung bestritten - das gab es ja schon bei einigen Volksentscheidungen zum Euro. 

&gt;Aber wenn die Schweiz von der EU profitieren will, dann muÃ sie nunmal auf die WÃ¼nsche der EU eingehen.

FÃ¤llt dir auf daÃ du dir hier selber widersprichst?  Selber entscheiden UND auf die WÃ¼nsche anderer eingehen? 

Und was das ""Profitieren"" betrifft - hier geht es eher ums wirtschaftliche Ãberleben,  denn ohne Abkommen wÃ¼rde der Protektionismus der EU die Schweizer Wirtschaft ruinieren.

Central banks are *politically* independent, which means that their governing statutes state that they should not take orders from the government, and ensure that they cannot be pressured by the government in their day to day operation.

However, central banks are not independent of their constitutional setting, whether that's their country or the EU. National central banks have their statutes determined by their national legislatures - not by decision of the government, but by votes of parliament - and are independent only within, and to the extent, laid down by law. 

In the case of the EU, the ECB is subject primarily to the statutes laid down in the EU Treaties, which are approved by the national legislatures and/or referendum in the member states. Only within that are they operationally independent, which is why the question of whether the ECB's OMT programme is legal can be referred to the CJEU - the ECB cannot just do what it likes, it must be controlled somehow.

The seating arrangements are part of that control, and result from the standard national paranoias about decision-making.
