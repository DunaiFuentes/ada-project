Y'know, cuz' we're friends!"". Listen, dipshits, we're confused as fuck here. Plenty of EU countries recognize Kosovo, but Ukraine and Russia do not. Nobody recognizes Crimea as a part of Russia except Russia. So, on one hand we agree with the EU in recognizing Ukraine's territorial integrity, but we don't agree with them in any form of recognition for Kosovo. On the other side of the coin, we agree with Russia on it's stance on Kosovo, but we don't agree with it's stance on Crimea. It's confusing as fuck and we're too small to take any part in this shitfest. Please leave us out of it.

So, it appears we have hardcore international politics in the speeches of these nutjobs, instead of them telling us about [relevant chapters which need fixing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Serbia_to_the_European_Union), they keep quiet. When they do talk about it, they only blurt out a morsel of info or two, and it sounds to us like they're completely uninterested. Please, for the love of all that is holy, tell us what's wrong directly! I don't want to hear encouragement on one day, and let downs on the next. Tell us what needs to be fixed! We need to know what our government is up to and what they're fucking up. The average citizen is concerned with what's on that list, not about Russia's bickering with western nations!

Serbia has finished with all forms of cooperation with the ICTY. Our press freedom index is 54/180 (better than Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia, Albania, Greece, Bulgaria, Montenegro, Macedonia, etc.). Our homicide rate is 1.2, on par with Portugal, Croatia, Ireland and Poland, better than Finland, Belgium, Romania, Greece, Slovakia, etc. Our diaspora is situated in [mostly western countries](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Serb_diaspora.png). We're tied with South Korea in the World Peace Index (52/162). Our corruption perception index is not great, but it's 3 spots behind Italy. Our birth rate is not anything special, it's on par with Italy. What I'm saying is... we're not that different nor are we that much of an asshole of Europe. We're also tiny. At 7-8mil people, we're not exactly a threat nor an influence to anything.

Serbia is also very pissed that it's being treated with different standards, since Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU. It's the opinion of many that the EU has burned it's tongue with these two countries, and now we're getting the rough end of the stick.

If there was light at the end of the tunnel, this 78% rate would dramatically drop. Serbia is encircled by the EU. Very few are willing to invest here unless they're heavily subsidized to do so since there is no EU to act as a safety net here. Hence - we're cut off. If there were visible changes in how we live, travel or do business, the youth of Serbia wouldn't get scared into leaving. Give us a chance, tell us what's wrong, or tell us to fuck off. Please, no more beating around the bush.

It's mostly the U.K. to blame, as well as our own government at the time. But if it hadn't been for the EEC, New Zealand would be a vastly different place.

In 1960 New Zealand was the third wealthiest country in the world. Our population was barely two million, yet our strong agriculture sector sold lamb, butter and wool to the world. The country boasted high export earnings, generous public services and an egalitarian society, with low levels of inequality unheard of today. New Zealanders enjoyed stable jobs and unemployment was so low, that the Prime Minister boasted he knew the names of every single unemployed person.

This was all because of our close links to the ""mother country"". Britain was by far our largest trade partner, with exports to Britain over half of our total. New Zealand had very strong political links to Britain, in many ways we were part of Britain (much more so than Australia). The British had pillaged the native New Zealanders land, and in response New Zealand had sent thousands of troops to die in Europe's wars, at the request of Britain. 

After the war, New Zealand experienced a significant boom, but unfortunately this couldn't last forever. When Britain joined the EEC, they were swamped by the ""butter mountain"" and New Zealand's exports collapsed. We simply could  not compete with Europe's protectionist agricultural policies and the obscene subsidies. After years of backing Britain, New Zealand was well and truly fucked over. 

Our government at the time was useless, it failed to predict the calamity that would follow and responded with more protectionist trade barriers (e.g. margarine was only available with a prescription!). The economy chugged along, but we rapidly slipped in OECD rankings and accumulated huge amounts of debt. Some seriously stupid government policy at the time didn't help though.

Come 1984, we were on the bring of bankruptcy. A new notionally center-left government was elected and implement a Thatcherite revolution on steroids. ... Thing have only really improved in the last decade with the rise of China, although we still rank twenty-somthing in the OECD rankings, when we used to be in the top five. 

It's far too late to change anything now. The E.U. simply won't open up it's markets, New Zealand's moved on anyway. But the breakup really hurt.",0,1412123486,null,0,1412123686,0,ckx0zbk,t3_2hvol8,t1_ckx0zbk,t1_ckwi2yh,null,1426744773,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Se ti piace la birra ce n'è di mille tipi diversi, con vari pub specializzati che ne hanno di ogni genere.

Se vai in osmizza i salumi sono fantastici, ma non bere il vino. E' quasi sempre atroce. Non capisco perchè i triestini continuano a lamentarsi della qualità orrenda del vino da osmizza, ma poi continuano a berlo quando ci vanno.

La Bora è un fenomeno da sperimentare almeno una volta nella vita. Se è vero che le immagini valgono mille parole, sicuramente [i video valgono mille immagini](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bora+trieste). Se hai problemi col freddo, Trieste non è la città per te.

Sorprendentemente la città ha un locale aperto 24h su 24: il Pane Quotidiano di via XX Settembre. Ci trovi sempre qualcuno perchè a certe ore l'unica alternativa è tornare a casa...

A proposito di vita notturna: in inverno è praticamente assente per ovvi motivi, verso mezzanotte chiude tutto (l'una se va particolarmente bene). In mezza stagione va meglio, in estate può addirittura capitare di beccare qualcuno in giro alle ore piccole: i locali ormai sono tutti chiusi, ma i più notturni si siedono in qualche piazza o al molo, portando bottiglie da casa.

Si dice che i commessi triestini siano noti in tutta Italia per la loro esemplare antipatia, ma personalmente non ho avuto esperienze così traumatiche. C'è anche da dire che sono uno molto easygoing ed è difficile offendermi. Va detto però che in un caso è sicuramente vero: il bar Madison del viale XX Settembre, i cui camerieri sono persone veramente spregevoli.

La Slovenia è dietro l'angolo, la Croazia giusto un pelo più in la. Tanti bei posti in cui andare, paesaggi da vedere e se ti piace il mare un'infinità di spiagge. Avvertenza: Ljubljiana è un bel posto, ma in inverno è **gelida**.

E' una città molto sicura. Nessuno ha paura a tornare a casa la notte da solo/a e aggressioni e scippi sono cose rare. 

Il traffico è da pazzi, e trovare parcheggio in centro può essere un'odissea senza fine. Se vuoi muoverti rapidamente, l'unica è lo scooter.

I assume the definition is the same as the United Nations Research Institute For Social Development has defined it. To be more specific the following:

- Labor market interventions are policies and programs designed to promote employment, the efficient operation of labor markets and the protection of workers.

- Social Insurance mitigates risks associated with unemployment, ill health, disability, work-related injury and old age, such as health insurance or unemployment insurance.

- Social Assistance is when resources, either cash or in-kind, are transferred to vulnerable individuals or households with no other means of adequate support, including single parents, the homeless, or the physically or mentally challenged.

false,newappeal,advanced-english,advanced (native English),"&gt;All the sentence structures have to be in present perfect and not simple past. I think this means it combines either haben or sein and the ge+ infinitive but I might have made my sentences too complex using multiple verbs?

Yes, the *Perfekt* tense uses haben (for most verbs) or sein (for verbs of motion or change-of-state verbs) with the past participle. The past participle, however, is not formed by adding *ge-* to the infinitive. There are two methods:

1. Weak verbs (regular): drop the infinitive ending (*-n* or *-en*) and at a *-t* to the end and a *ge-* to the beginning of the word. If the verb has a separable prefix, put the *ge-* after the prefix, and if it has an inseparable prefix, do not add the *ge-* at all. (which you seem to have done correctly)

2. Strong verbs (irregular): memorize the past participle. It will usually begin with a *ge-* (unless it has a prefix, in which case the same rules as weak verbs apply) and always end with an *-en*.

I should also note that the Perfekt form of *sein* is *bin/bist/ist/usw. gewesen* not *war*, which is the simple past. However, it is rare to use the *ist gewesen* form with modal auxiliaries like *sein*, so your teacher might be fine with using *war*.

Now for the essay: (excuse the length; I tried to include as many hopefully helpful notes as possible)

&gt;Als ich ein Kind war, spielte ich viel mit Booten. 

This is technically correct, but in my (non-native, mind you) opinion, *Als ich klein war* sounds better than *Als ich ein Kind war*

&gt;Als wir eine Kreuzfahrt war ich überglücklich .

I'm not sure exactly what you want to say here. If you mean, ""I was overjoyed when went on a cruise"", a good translation would be *Als wir eine Kreuzfahrt gemacht haben, war ich überglücklich* or *Ich war überglücklich, eine Kreuzfahrt zu machen* (""I was overjoyed to go on a cruise"")

&gt;Es schien wie die massive Schiff war endlos, wie ich an Bord und lief herum.

Here you've used the simple past, not the Perfekt. Were it not for the requirement, I would recommend writing this sentence as *Es sah so aus, immer when ich an Bord herumlief, als ob das massive Schiff unendlich lang wäre.* However, since *sah* and *lief* are simple past, that won't work. Try restructuring the sentence to something like, *Das Schiff hat den Schein gehabt, unendlich lang zu sein.* (lit: ""The ship had the appearance of being infinitely long."")

&gt;Unbegrenzte Essen und Koks war ein Paradies zuvor mir unbekannt.

*Koks* is usually the raw material coke, or cocaine. Did you mean *Kekse* (cookies)? Also, you have to use a relative clause at the end, since German doesn't have the same possibilities for participial phrases as English. Try *Unbeschränkter Zugriff auf Essen und Kekse war ein Paradies, das mir zuvor unbekannt war.*

&gt;Aber wie alle guten Dinge , es war nicht von Dauer.

Your sentence is correct, but the usual idiom is something like: *Alles Gute hat allerdings sein Ende.*

&gt;Auf der einen normalen Tag , schlug ein tropischer Sturm unserem Boot.

*An einem ganz normalen Tag, hat ein Tropensturm unseren Boot getroffen.* (can a native speaker confirm this usage?)

&gt;Der Himmel wurde grau und es regnete stark an Deck.

Again, this is in the simple past, not the Perfekt. It would normally be acceptable to use *wurde* here, but your teacher may think otherwise. Here's *werden* in the Perfekt just to be safe: *Der Himmel ist grau geworden, und der Regen ist stark aufs Deck gefallen.*

&gt;Ich werde nie vergessen, die Wellen , die uns angegriffen.

*Ich werde die Wellen nie vergessen, die uns angegriffen haben.* (*angreifen* means *to attack*--that seems a little odd there to me, but it certainly works)

&gt;Sie waren massiv fünfzig Fuß surft , die den Himmel aus blockiert.

I'm not sure what you mean here. *surft* can only be a form of *surfen*, which only refers to the sport or the internet.

&gt;Das riesige Schiff schaukelte heftig schwer .

*Das riesige Schiff (OR: Das Riesenschiff) hat heftig geschaukelt*

&gt;Papiersäcke für Reisekrankheit wurden an jeder Ecke gebucht, aber es so ein Unwetter auch das Personal arbeitsunfähig war.

*Papiersäcke für Seekrankheit sind an jeder Ecke gestellt geworden...* I'm a little confused with the second part. *Aber* (""but"") doesn't seem to make sense here, so I'm not sure how to restructure this.

&gt;Ich verschanzt in unserem Zimmer den ganzen Tag versucht , die ganze Welt Verschiebung ignorieren. 

*Den ganzen Tag habe ich mich in unserem Zimmer verschanzt und habe versucht, die ganze Welt ... zu ignorieren.* (what did you mean by *Welt Verschiebung*?)

&gt;Obwohl die Fahrt war lustig , das ist, was ich erinnere mich am meisten über diese Woche .

*Obwohl die Kreuzfahrt trotzdem Spaß gemacht hat, erinnert diese Woche mich meist an diesen Zwischenfall.* (lit: *Although the cruise was fun, this week reminds me most of this incident.*)

Man, you couldn't have been *that* great of a explorer if you've been stuck in Chicago all your life.  No offense, but flying from one big city to another big city and hitting all the tourist sites isn't exactly ""exploring"".

I took one trip to the US so far, drove from SF to NY within 3 weeks. My girlfriend spent a month at the University of New Orleans before that and met me in SF. We also had a friend join us on our roadtrip so we were three people.

Since we were in a bit of a hurry we never spent very much time at one place unfortunately. Because of that we didn't talk with too many people since we were driving a lot.

**General impression**

When we planned our trip I was very much against driving all across the country because I was basically freaked out about how huge it is. [I'm from a pretty small country myself...](https://mapfight.appspot.com/at-vs-usc/austria-united-states-contiguous-size-comparison) In the end, this was what I liked best about the US. There's so much space! Especially when we drove through Arizona and Nevada it really put things into perspective. Driving through the desert is awesome.

Europe is crowded. In Austria we can take refuge in some valley but all in all there is barely anywhere you can go without stumbling over some kind of a settlement. In the Western US it's obviously vastly different. We met people who went camping inside Death Valley - you can't pitch a tent outside a camping ground ~~anywhere in~~ in most of Europe. But also in the Eastern US there's so much space.

I didn't spend to much time in cities but they seemed very condensed to me. The few blocks of NYC I explored contained so much more than the same area of a European city. I prefer our medieval buildings but it was certainly interesting. Older city buildings in the US are cool too so if you wait for a few hundred years we'll probably envy you.

**People**

What we noticed first is that Americans are extremely nice compared to Europeans. This is something you hear a lot, often Europeans complain that this niceness is only superficial. I think that's often not the case. People were generally way more helpful and friendly than in Europe. Now I like my typical Austrian grumpy acquaintances at home, but especially when you are travelling you kind of rely on other people being willing to communicate.

After we left SF heading south we stopped to get something to eat. When we wanted to pay we were told by the server that the family on the table next to us had paid our bill and wished us a nice trip. Just like this. We were pretty amazed and wouldn't stop talking about this for the entire trip. Something like this has never happened to me in Europe.

In general people at gas stations, bars, motels restaurants et cetera were always nice and willing to help us out if we had some kind of problem. We had some extremely minor car troubles (being a not very experienced driver this startled me a bit) but were helped without issue. Once we got lost while searching for a cheap motel in Monterey, asked someone on the sidewalk about the way and they called the motel they worked at and organized a cheap room for us.

Small stuff like this made a huge difference to me. In Europe people are nice too, sure, but most will be more reserved at first. There's a chance to meet assholes everywhere but in Europe it's somehow socially tolerated.


There's so much more but that was what sticked out to me most. Definitely planning to go to the US again.

false,WilliamDhalgren,CROA,Croatia,"Allowed? nothing I mentioned is forbidden per se. But national interest certainly doesn't excuse every possible behavior either, otherwise Russia would be perfectly right to defend its national interest by occupying swathes of Ukraine as well, for example.

The question is whence the hostility to how the relationship between UK and EU currently stands, with the claim that the behavior of UK is in no way damaging to anyone else - here are 3 examples of UK's behavior certainly damaging to the EU and interests of all other member states.

It certainly makes the continent less interested in the continuation of such a relationship. And its allies on increasing number of issues few, since alliances are also built on solidarity and cooperation, whilst the UK gives the impression of being focused only on the national prerogatives.

Having a free trade agreement of whatever depth it desires, plus possibly a bilateral defense and/justice cooperation with the UK is certainly preferable than a country with the behavior of the UK having full further vote in internal EU matters, complete with the power to stop others from integrating further or shaping the institutions that practically run the macroeconomic envelope of core EU.

If the UK is an opportunist to take advantage of any weakness it can find to push through its national interest, usually opposite to the interests of the rest of the EU, then it is paramount it can be outvoted on everything of importance at least. Ofc its still a large voting block to push through or block a position that has sufficient further support in the rest of the EU, and hence influence continental policymaking in a fair proportion to its  significance, such as it actually is.

I still think this can be a productive ""divorce"" though, possibly developing an explicit associate status within the EU, a real multi-tier structure, possibly one with ad-hoc arrangements and partial voting rights on matters where one participates only, without commissioner seat, and devoid of any veto, including none on revisions of full-member EU competencies or EU institutional arrangements - an arrangement far fairer and so possibly of interest to Norway, Iceland, or the microstates.",0,1412131446,null,0,1412132745,0,ckx4mxl,t3_2hvnr2,t1_ckx4mxl,t1_ckwxdzy,null,1426743067,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Actually, American football's intricacies become apparent when you learn about the types of plays the offense and defense can run. Even before they hand off the ball, they're constantly reading each other's placement and estimating what the other side will do. Then the ball is snapped and in play, and they need to execute their plan while simultaneously adjusting to the unexpected things that happen (defenseman plows through the offensive line faster than anticipated, etc).

Point taken, though. People here think ""soccer"" is boring as all fuck, but that's just because they're watching guys kick around a ball and never scoring.

I will also give you a direct english translation of my suggestions so you can check whether that's what you're trying to say. some of the sentences are a bit too long and complicated to be entirely in Perfekt without sounding too weird IMO, I'll give it my best though

&gt;Als ich ein Kind war, spielte ich viel mit Booten.

that's simple past if I'm not mistaken. if you want present perfect, it would be ""Als ich ein Kind war, habe ich viel mit Booten gespielt"" (when I was a child, I've played a lot with boats)

&gt;Als wir eine Kreuzfahrt war ich überglücklich.

""als wir eine Kreuzfahrt gemacht haben, war ich überglücklich"" (when we've gone on a cruise, I was super happy)

&gt;Es schien wie die massive Schiff war endlos, wie ich an Bord und lief herum.

""als ich an Bord herumgelaufen bin, schien es, als sei das riesige Schiff endlos"" (it appeared, as if the massive ship was infinitely large). note how I translated ""massive"" with ""riesig"". the germans reserve ""massiv"" for things that are... well... massive. as in ""entirely filled out"". like a block of ice. you can refer to a ship as ""massiv"", but it has slightly different implications in german than it does in english

&gt;Unbegrenzte Essen und Koks war ein Paradies zuvor mir unbekannt.

no, you do not get unlimited coke as a child, even on a cruise. germans use Cola to refer to the soda, Koks is usually referring to cocaine (though the fuel goes under the same name, but that went out of fashion ages ago). ""Unbegrenztes Essen und Cola habe ich zuvor noch nicht erlebt"" (I haven't experienced unlimited food and coke before)

&gt;Aber wie alle guten Dinge, es war nicht von Dauer. 

almost. ""Aber wie alle guten Dinge, ist es nicht von Dauer gewesen"" (but as every good thing, it didn't last)

&gt;Auf der einen normalen Tag , schlug ein tropischer Sturm unserem Boot.

""An einem normalen Tag ist unser Schiff in einen tropischer Sturm geraten"" (on a normal day, a hurrican hit our ship). in german, storms don't ""hit"". they either break through the sky onto us (ein Sturm bricht über uns hinein) or we tumble into them (wir sind in einen Sturm geraten)

&gt;Der Himmel wurde grau und es regnete stark an Deck.

again, almost. ""Der Himmel wurde grau und es hat stark an Deck geregnet"". the second half of that sentence was simple past

&gt;Ich werde nie vergessen, die Wellen , die uns angegriffen.

""ich werde nie die Wellen vergessen, die uns getroffen haben"" (I will never forget the waves that hit us)

&gt;Sie waren massiv fünfzig Fuß surft , die den Himmel aus blockiert

""Es waren riesige, fünfzig Fuß hohe Wellen, die den Himmel ausgeblockt haben"" (they were giant, fifty feet high waves, that blocked out the sky)

&gt;Das riesige Schiff schaukelte heftig schwer .

""Das riesige Schiff hat heftig geschaukelt"" (the ship rocked heavily)

&gt;Papiersäcke für Reisekrankheit wurden an jeder Ecke gebucht, aber es so ein Unwetter auch das Personal arbeitsunfähig war.

""es wurde an jeder Ecke nach Papierbeutel für Seekrankheit gefordert, aber bei so einem Unwetter ist auch das Personal arbeitsunfähig gewesen"" (at every corner, people asked for paperbags against the seasickness, but during such a storm, even the personnel was incapacitated)

&gt;Ich verschanzt in unserem Zimmer den ganzen Tag versucht , die ganze Welt Verschiebung ignorieren.

""ich habe mich in unserer Kabine verschanzt und den ganzen Tag versucht, die schaukelnde Welt um mich herum zu ignorieren"" (I locked myself into our room and tried to ignore the rocking world around me). I exchanged ""Zimmer"" with ""Kabine"" because that's the proper term for the *living quarters* on a ship in german

&gt;Obwohl die Fahrt war lustig , das ist, was ich erinnere mich am meisten über diese Woche .

""Obwohl die Fahrt lustig gewesen ist, ist es das, woran ich mich an meisten aus dieser Woche erinnere"" (even though the cruise was fun, that's what I remember most from that week)

_______________________________________________________________

what I noticed during working over your text is, that you didn't use the present perfect often enough. you often used the simple past (which you often used quite well), but as you said, that wasn't the point of the exercise. germans use the Perfekt very often, even more than the simple past, so it's a good idea to try and improve on that in the future.

you also tried applying english sentence structure to german grammar a lot. not gonna lie, that will require training. a lot of it. but I don't think I saw a single misspelled word, which is something you can be proud of. I bet you can find one or two misspellings in my corrections, so keep a sharp eye on that

Rîbnița is situated on the picturesque valley of the Dniester River and as the rest of Moldova enjoys a temperate climate with warm summers and mild winters. The city is a major economic hub in Transnistria, being the home of a large steel plant dating back to the Soviet era and a significant sugar plant (the first of its kind in Transnistria!). Moreover, thanks to its unique combination of being a major industrial zone and a major transport hub of the separatist regime now controlling Transnistria, you can be guaranteed to find some hustle and bustle year round.

false,dirkt,null,null,"If the NSA was just doing targeted surveillance, it wouldn't be such a problem. But they don't: They are doing mass surveillance, they intercept and store all the data they can get. This is very convenient for them, because they can ""look into the past"" when they find a suspect. But it's also a huge source of power over people: Want to do industrial spionage? Want to make sure that an American company gets the deal, and not a German one? Want to find out some dirt about some politician or official to damage his career? The data is all there, Edward Snowden has shown it's not difficult to get at it, and he's also shown that there's no oversight in practical terms. *This* is the problem. Not that secret agencies are doing their job. And it's all in the jurisdiction of the US, where other countries can't control it.

As I said, I don't mind secret services cooperating and sharing data to look at, say, terrorists.
Actually, I appreciate it. But this is vastly different from what the NSA is actually doing, and certainly not something the German government is asking for. Until you can prove that point, I think that's just an excuse you are making up. And I'm not even speaking about the spying on politicians here. And yes, there's a large difference between ""we have intentionally targeted Angela Merkel's cellphone, and we are not sorry for it"" and ""we have overheard one call by Hilary Clinton using a satellite phone in a plane, because high above these things broadcast all over the place. It should have been deleted at once, it wasn't, that was a mistake, and we are sorry for it"". Apples and oranges.

Democracy is about checks and balances to power. There are no checks and balances in this field for the NSA, at all. And the NSA is pushing the BND, as we know since Snowden.

And it's about power. The US is in a position of power, they don't even offer an apology for spying, and they are using the exaggerated fear about terrorists to consolidate that power and justify it. The actual number of deaths even in terrible terrorist attacks like 9/11 is vastly lower than e.g. the number of deaths in traffic accidents per year. Do you get a nanny that controls every move you are making in your car? Do you get ridiculously low speed limits? No, but you get a violation of basic human rights in the name of the ""war"" against terrorism.

The fear is totally overblown, and Germany would be equally safe without all that spying (and the US would be, too). So far, no actual terrorist attacks have been found using all that data, and there was actually data on the 9/11 attacks, and they still have not been prevented, even with that date. 

So don't let yourself be fooled that this invasion of privacy is somehow necessary, and we all would be knee-deep in terrorist attacks without it.

You don't think Hillary Clinton was using encryption? Even little kids in Mexico use encryption. 

In some parts of your post, you're using broad sweeping language, and its imprecise. I don't know what you mean. You make such large statements (e.g. ""it's about power"") that they are impossible to falsify. 

I have a question. Why is it only Germany who is angry? Why not other European countries? 

There are two issues - Merkel's personal handy being listened in on, and the general 'PRISM' programme, which you call ""mass surveillance"". 

I understand why Germany, specifically, is upset about the Merkel's phone issue, but - are you trying to say, that the US is somehow only engaging in mass surveillance of Germany, and not other European countries? 

Or, rather, are you saying that the US engages in mass surveillance of *all* of the European Union? 

I have only heard of Germans being directly/personally pissed off at the USG/NSA, and so I'm actually curious, I don't really know - I mean, are people in Spain, Italy, Austria, are they also under this so-called ""mass surveillance""? 

Furthermore, you say:

&gt;As I said, I don't mind secret services cooperating and sharing data to look at, say, terrorists. Actually, I appreciate it. But this is vastly different from what the NSA is actually doing, and certainly not something the German government is asking for. 

So, do you believe that the USG/NSA is, *today*, conducting mass surveillance operations in Germany, the way you describe them? That the NSA is just as ""active"" in Germany today, as it was, say, two years ago or so? You think that the governments of Germany and the USA aren't working closely with one another on the entire matter? 

&gt;The actual number of deaths even in terrible terrorist attacks like 9/11 is vastly lower than e.g. the number of deaths in traffic accidents per year. Do you get a nanny that controls every move you are making in your car? Do you get ridiculously low speed limits? No, but you get a violation of basic human rights in the name of the ""war"" against terrorism.

***that old chestnut!***

Look, all I'm saying is that you're wrong if you think that the NSA is copying down every last thing you're doing on your computer in Germany, and the German government is sitting there dumbfounded like a rich man's child, helpless to do anything about it.

* Decrease production freewillingly by giving monetary compensation.
* Decrease agricultural subsidies to drive down over production of sugar.

It is the same thing as with Greece and olive trees. There was over production that was enabled by agricultural subsidies. I myself would have just prefered on cutting agricultural subsidies on growing sugar and olives, it would have had the same effect, but the market would have decided which companies stay alive and which don't.

Another thing to note is that sugar or olive production doesn't really generate money. It is a low value industry that is under increased competition from global markets. The only way countries such as Italy can keep their standards of living is by moving to produce more high valued products and services. 

Case in example: when the [Multi Fibre Arrangement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_Fibre_Arrangement) ended ending the quota system that was limiting the amount of textile products that could be imported to developed countries from developing countries, it caused the end of huge amount of low value textile manufacturers in southern Europe. The textile manufacturers had plenty of time to move from low value manufacturing to more specialised and more valued manufacturing, but they were too lazy and incompetant to do so, thus they went out of business.

I would also like to point out that Italy has all the ingredients to jump starts its economy. There are huge amount of SMEs, usually familly owned, in machine building and high-tech sectors that manufacture world class products. The problem with these firms is that they can't grow because the Italian labour legislation is such rigid mess that it prevents these companies from growing.

You could do a trip on 1800, if you budgeted out, and planned out roughly what you wanted to do.

What's nice about Europe, is that you have quite the diversity of transport options that don't require a car (rentals can be quite expensive).

For example, if you live on the west coast you can actually do roundtrip tickets for a lot less than you'd expect. Check out http://www.norwegian.com/us/. Oakland - Oslo/Stockholm (one way) start at 250$. Once you get into the EU, your flights inside can be quite cheap (much like flying within the US). They also have decent deals from the East coast as well.

After that, check out staying in Airbnb, though google hotel finder worked quite well for last minute deals. A lot of people recommend hostels, which are fine, but AirBnb can be quite cost competitive, and the option of having your own apartment with a kitchen will cut down on cost if you don't mind cooking.

Most places have public transit for a reasonable price within the city (if you're in a city with a population greater than 100,000 people in western europe).

It was the same line the miners unions spun,when they try to prevent pit closures in the 80s and AFAIK, power blackouts were far more prevalent in the 70s and 80s than they are now.

If that's not a clear trend, I don't know what is, but I haven't bothered to look up any other countries.

The rationale for it, though, is that other countries are also lowering their corporate tax rates, including especially Ireland, which makes it opportune for large corporations that make a lot of money to use Ireland as a tax haven and transfer all taxable incomes there. That's a big problem.

The way European law is constructed, corporations and companies are supposed to pay taxes where the money is earned, but when you're a large corporation, you can get around this using various subsidiary holding companies and whatnot.

For repair, black garages who work for cash under the table, and parts from the ""bontó"", the wreckyard where old cars get cannibalized for parts.

As for petrol, car-sharing. Not really officially with apps, more like e.g. 3-4 guys live in the same village and work in Budapest as construction workers, they tend to work together, and share an aging Astra.

Having said that the car traffic in the last 5 years got visibly smaller as most people cannot afford filling up the tank anymore even this way.

For example, had a friend that wanted to go in august to France and if he bought the ticket before aug 15th 2014, ticket was 1300 dollars. If he bought it on the 16th, ticket went down to 900 dollars. This is flying from Miami, though. But you can see the difference.

So look on the calendar and determine when is the so called tourist season to europe and fly either before, or after, but never in it, otherwise, you'll spend sometimes twice as much on airfare.

Also, you can use couchsurfing for free nights, better than hostel sometimes. That's what I did when I came to europe a couple of times and cool thing was, met people also immediately, as my hosts would introduce me to their friends, etc. I did buy a lunch or drinks for my hosts too cause they were nice enough to let me stay in their place.

Also, let's say you arrive in Paris and then you want to hit Amsterdam, make sure you use the european version of the train website, not the americanized version where you can pay more for the same train ticket. In other words, if you're planning your trip and you're in the usa, make sure you visit the european train website.

All I know is that I had searched for a train ticket from Paris to Amsterdam in the USA, and my friend got me the same itinerary for 30 euros less or something like that. Then he sent me the link, and it was their french website...in the usa the site was from the same company, but somehow prices were higher.  Don't know if that was a fluke, but i sat there comparing prices, and they were much higher in the usa, even when the euro to dollars was factored in.

Comme le fait remarquer le rapport du CNCDH sur le projet de loi antiterroriste, il faut éviter les amalgames stupides et investir dans des programmes sociaux:



&gt;Le 9 juillet 2014, un projet de loi renforçant les dispositions relatives à la lutte contre le terrorisme a été 
adopté en Conseil des ministres. Ce nouveau texte intervient dans un contexte extrêmement inquiétant 
où un nombre grandissant de jeunes français quittent le territoire de la République pour partir à 
l’étranger se former ou combattre dans des conflits armés au sein de groupements terroristes, bien 
souvent avant de revenir « aguerris » en France1
. Si ces comportements présentent un risque réel et 
impliquent la plus grande vigilance des pouvoirs publics, l’extrême complexité de ce phénomène doit
néanmoins être soulignée2
. Certains ont pu partir par endoctrinement, par embrigadement ou par 
« idéalisme irréfléchi » sans vouloir passer à l’acte. D’autres ont pu, au retour, renoncer à toute action 
terroriste à l’épreuve des atrocités vécues. La grande diversité de ces situations conduit la CNCDH à 
mettre en garde contre toute approche trop simpliste ou réductrice du phénomène. Il convient 
absolument d’éviter tout processus d’étiquetage précoce et auto-réalisateur. 




&gt;La CNCDH regrette que le projet de loi ne fixe pas au Gouvernement un délai pour présenter un « plan 
national de prévention des actes de terrorisme », alors même que le programme de Stockholm enjoint 
aux Etats membres de l’Union européenne « d’élaborer des mécanismes de prévention, en particulier 
pour permettre la détection précoce des signes de radicalisation ou des menaces, y compris celles qui 
émanent des mouvements extrémistes violents »
89. L’Union européenne a financé à partir de 2005 
plusieurs missions de recherche visant à identifier les causes de la radicalisation violente et les outils de 
lutte contre celle-ci90
. Ces études constituent une référence incontournable pour développer et renforcer
les dispositifs de lutte contre la « radicalisation violente »
91
, en particulier en milieu scolaire, dans les 
quartiers « ghettoïsés » et dans les établissements pénitentiaires où trop de mineurs et de jeunes
adultes ont la conviction d’être sans avenir et sans espérance. A ce propos, il convient de préciser que 
les causes d’une telle radicalisation résident dans « une impression de discrimination (qu’elle soit réelle 
ou ressentie), l’exclusion sociale, les humiliations et les traumatismes, le rejet des valeurs de la société 
dans laquelle on vit, l’absence d’intégration et une faible opinion de soi-même »
92
. La CNCDH 
recommande que les mineurs qui se sont engagés à l’étranger dans des entreprises terroristes et qui 
reviennent en France, fassent l’objet d’un accompagnement particulier par la justice des mineurs, au 
titre de l’enfance en danger ou de l’enfance délinquante. Elle recommande enfin un renforcement du 
soutien, par la politique de la ville, des jeunes sans projet dans les quartiers les plus difficiles.

Firstly, the poll was taken by an *English language* newspaper. While English and Cantonese are the official languages of Hong Kong, most people speak Cantonese as their first language - poor people and people who recently emigrated from mainland China often don't speak any English. So the readership of the newspaper that gave the poll is made up of English-speaking expats and Hong Kongers who are affluent, well-educated, and possibly lived abroad in English-speaking countries. Excluded are the poor, the poorly educated, and people from mainland China. This skews the results. 

Also, the poll's wording is a bit meh. Yes, many people would prefer British rule to Chinese rule, but they aren't given the choice of being an autonomous city state, like Singapore, which many would prefer (totally anecdotal, but, meh). Hong Kongers weren't exactly rolling in freedomz under British rule either; it's just that Britain is preferable to China (to the newspaper's readership).

&gt;*This article is about the chili pepper. For the video game character, see [BurgerTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BurgerTime)*.

&gt;The __peter pepper__, *Capsicum annuum var. annuum*, is an [heirloom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heirloom_plant) [chili pepper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_pepper) that is best known for its unusual shape. It is a type of *[Capsicum annuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsicum_annuum)*, though it is not officially recognized as a cultivar of the species. It occurs in red and yellow varieties.  The pepper is considered very rare, and its origin is unknown.  

&gt;The pepper is most commonly grown in [East Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Texas) and Louisiana,  although it is grown in Mexico, as well.  It was first popularized in the United States by [Frank X. Tolbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_X._Tolbert) in his *[Dallas Morning News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Morning_News)* column about obscure local history, although he saw the pepper only once in his life. It has since been studied by horticulture experts at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin) and [Louisiana State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University).  Though it is rare, its seeds are available from some private suppliers.  It is adaptable to a variety of growing conditions.  The seeds have also been exported to Asian countries, including South Korea.

The fuck. Nope, Germany isn't even growing, which is understandable as the economy is pretty much saturated completely. As such, there's no ""replacing"", we just re-gained that title after the Chinese had their quick go at it.

There's also the issue of products. What do you want Germany do, sell all those factories to itself, exporting more? Stop exporting factories, cutting into growth abroad? We're not actually selling cars to China. Those cars are produced by Chinese in China... with German factories.


That said, the situation is awkward. Yes, unions generally want to increase domestic consumption (i.e. they're done holding back and now want their wage increases). However, with 25% of the work-capable population not working or working for wages that need to get topped off by the state, the position of unions is dire, to say the least, in many sectors.

""Increasing domestic demand"" and ""capitalism"" are actually at odds with each other. Companies rather give out pittance wages and tell the workers to get the rest from the state.

We need some *serious* new thinking in this matter: There won't be much if any growth to be had, we don't need it for it's own sake, either, and at the same time those 25% are only going to increase.

That's irrelevant for anarchists. If they want to pay rent when the rent relationship itself will not be enforced by some authority, then that's their thing.

A good way to understand the point anarchists are making is to juxtapose these hierarchies with indentured servitude (note that I'm not making a moralist comparison) within post-feudal societies. If I want to work for you for nothing but the bare necessities (I am not refering to a formal dependent employment contract paid beneath the minimum wage) and to obey your every order even if those are degrading or may threaten my health, I can do that. However if at some point I choose to stop doing so I can simply do that. You are not justified to use force to make me comply to those orders, neither will the state use force to make me do so. If you take me to court it will simply not enforce the slavery contract and if you do use violence to coerce me you will be prosecuted *for that action* and I will have a legal right to defend myself against your agression with equal force.

Notice that when we say that slavery is prohibited, no one is saying ""oh yeah? What if I want to enter a BDSM relationship with my partner? Will you point a gun at me to stop me?""

This would rightly sound stupid to us. Yet, slavery (in one form or another) was a part of pre-liberal societies and was abolished by the liberal revolutions. But we would scoff at someone claiming that the abolition of slavery is authoritarian because it forces people to not sell themselves in nexum. Besides the obvious implications with the inalienability of rights (can you really argue that you would be unfree even if you were actively forced by others to remain free?) the abolition of these sort of formal hierarchies never takes the form of pointing a gun to that guy that simply *dies* to subject himself to them in the first place.

This goes double for anarchists that don't even believe in directly abolishing hierarchical relationship but instead believe they would organically fail to reproduce themselves in the aggregate if the specific foundational property norms that prop them up were no longer centrally enforced. They're not asking for a positive action to be enforced, they're asking for a positive action to no longer be enforced.",0,1412151082,null,0,false,0,ckxaz98,t3_2hvcn0,t1_ckxaz98,t1_ckx1fq4,null,1426740039,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

But, yes actually, logically we can. Why wouldn't we? I mean if thing X doesn't meet the definitional criteria of A it's not A. What's complex about this?

This is not an appeal to purity or positive consequences. This is simply saying A = A. The definition of socialism (worker ownership and management of the MOP / substitution of dependent employment by associated labor) is both strict (it's neither tautological nor fluid) and certain (it goes back to the 1800s and objectifies a concensus of everyone from communists to anarchists, individualists, egoists and mutualists).

I think the obsession with this must be ideologically motivated. I think this because it's not even a substantive matter. What we label the specific structure doesn't say anything about whether we agree with its actual *concrete* characteristics and in this both the people that claim these institutions were communist and those that claim they were state-capitalist (Though, I'd argue NK is closer to some form of feudalism, however the criticism of the soviet model as state capitalist isn't even new, both Lenin and Bukharin *and* their critics considered it so, though for obviously different reasons) are actually agreeing. They both refer to the same structure and implicitly they both agree that that structure was inadequate (to put it leniently).

The argument that the leadership was proclaiming certain ends is also irrelevant with the concrete policies they applied which should be the object of criticism. I do not see how the faillure of a very specific strategy (state-centralism coupled with vanguardism, both ideas being espoused by only one specific ideological movement and its offshoots) can reasonably be conflated with a completely irrelevant endgame. On the contrary these strategies can be criticised both based on their intrinsic demerit and based on their lacking capacity to lead to the stated end-state.

An example of what I'm saying here is this. If I found a sect that argues humans can double their life-expectancy (let's call this end-state ""postponyism"") by drinking cyanide (let's call this strategy ""Poisonism""), no matter how many times we try this and fail 1. Post-ponyism will not be equivalent to Poisonism 2. Postponyism (doubling our life-expectancy) will not be an intrinsically bad idea or at least it will not be a bad idea because it leads to death by poisoning and 3. Poisonism's faillure would not reveal something wrong with the goal of postponyism but could instead reasonably be questioned exactly in regards to its capacity to lead to the stated goal (it would be evident we might have a means-ends disassociation).",0,1412153318,null,0,1412153572,0,ckxbbq4,t3_2hvcn0,t1_ckxbbq4,t1_ckwfix7,null,1426739877,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I admit that ""neoliberalism"" has changed over the years. But this is largely because the term started as empty category with large hopes. After it had gotten content (examples of policies marked by their makers as neoliberal) it is understandable that we can start to use it in a negative light.

* The Parti de Gauche or FDG (Front De Gauche) : created in 2009 by former socialists, they want to be a far-left gathering and are composed by former communists, former greens and former socialists.

And then there is the little parties, they are smaller today because the radical leftists are now voting for the Parti de Gauche but they gathered all together around 10% of the votes during the 2002 and 2007 presidential elections :

* The NPA (Nouveau Parti Anticapitaliste) it's a revolutionary party, not that big but still kind of important.

* The LO (Lutte Ouvrière, you can translate it by ""Worker's fight"") it's a communist (the troskyist wing) party. They are small in number of adherents but they are still relevant.

* The PCF (Parti Communiste Français) it's kind of dead now because they pretty much blended with the Parti de Gauche but they were pretty big in their time.

There also is some smaller parties but they're not that relevant and never gathered more than 5% of the votes.

Sure, it is good for the individuals, like me, who can work abroad now! But for the country?

The EU paid us some money, only to be stolen by our corruped swine elites, the ""application writing consultants"".  But also wrecked some local businesses as we can no longer protect them with tariffs or anything. We can no longer forbid rich foreigners to buy up agricultural land. We can no longer make laws that treat local businesses preferentially. So overally being in the EU means the government can no longer protect the country and local businesses from the huge economic power of Western competition.

Overally the country is not becoming any richer or better organized due to it, and there is a certain loss of independence and being exposed to very powerful and rich Western business interests.

Maybe if our own elites are not corrupted swine and actually use and not abuse the EU opportunities it would have worked better. But our original hope was that the EU sort of ""overrides"" our corrupted swine elites and does good in spite of them. Well, they don't, and well, it seems the EU looks out mainly for large Western business interests. The EU, to a large extent, is Tesco, Aldi, Spar, Auchan, Media Markt, Penny Market, Obi, Baumax, Raiffeisen, UniCredit,  and everything else that kills the local businesses and destroys jobs and creates only a handful of low-paid retail jobs.

So my experience is not that positive. The EU pays money, but takes away all the protections. Not sure if a good deal at all.

If I could turn back the clock I would say we should have gotten rich first, more properly: should have really entrenched our businesses, then join the EU.

So basically all I am saying the EU is great if a country who is already roughly equal with the West and has decent elites joins it, but when it is inferior, then the EU kills the local business, and if it is corrupted, then the EU does not or cannot override the local elites so it just pays money in the pockets of the corrupted local elites.",0,1412154502,null,0,false,0,ckxbiii,t3_2hvzzd,t1_ckxbiii,t1_ckwov5c,null,1426739789,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I giornali non ne parlano perche' 15 testimonianze non significano assolutamente nulla: e' un esempio di ['bias di conferma'](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_di_conferma) e dei pericoli che si corrono a trarre conclusioni da campioni selezionati perdendo di vista [la loro significativita'](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significativit%C3%A0).  

Il fatto che ci siano 15 persone che sono guarite dopo aver fatto la dieta vegana non dice assolutamente nulla per un botto di ragioni fra cui:

- Non sai quale sia la percentuale di guarigione, vegani o non vegani (e leggevo che siamo sul 50%, su milioni di casi all'anno)

- Non sai quanti sono quelli che hanno fatto la dieta, e non sono guariti (perche' le testimonianze di chi non guarisce, purtroppo, non sono su Facebook)

- Anche se tu sapessi queste cose, non sai se ci sono terzi fattori che influenzano la possibilita' di sopravvivenza o di essere vegano in positivo o in negativo, o quale sia la probabilita' che una eventuale fluttuazione nei dati sia dovuta puramente al caso.

In sostanza trarre conclusioni dai dati (quello che si chiama inferenza statistica) non e' un lavoro banale e richiede un po' di competenze abbastanza specialistiche - e alla luce di questi strumenti le 15 testimonianze perdono ogni signicativita'.

Purtroppo per motivi evolutivi il nostro cervello e' ""programmato"" per commettere questo tipo di errori, ed e' per questo che ogni studio statistico (particolarmente in campo medico) *deve* dotarsi (a priori) di protocolli per il trattamento dati che siano validi e robusti.

Per questo mi sale la bile ogni volta che vedo siti con 'testimonianze' miracolose di chi ha sconfitto il diabete coi cristalli, il cancro con la dieta vegana, la calvizie con l'Acqua Diamante.. e vedo gettar fango su medici. matematici ed esperti di statistica che invece, con il loro lavoro, salvano vite.",0,1412154929,null,0,1412155288,0,ckxbl09,t3_2hx9wr,t1_ckxbl09,t1_ckxb9e3,null,1426739757,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

Are you sure it is a good thing and helps your country? How do you define good: that all rules are always enforced and obeyed? I don' think it is really the most ideal thing. This is a German thing: when you don't decide for yourself what rule to obey, but always obey all the rules. I don't think it is ideal. I find it too robotic.

I think it is perfectly OK for more creative and individualistic countries to interpret rules flexibly, and thus maintain a culture where you decide, not the law, if you care about this red light or not. And hence bribe. This is why I for example like Latin America. They have this mindset.

Because there is only one really important rule: do not harm people, help people instead. Does running a red light harms people? No. Hence: bribe. 

I think it is much more helpful and improving to care about things that can really harm people. Or help people.

Das Zentralkommite der Kommunistischen Partei Chinas hat ja schon jedliche Einmischung von Aussen abgestraft. So wird aus politischer Seite wohl kein positiver Einfluss geltend zu machen sein. Was mMn wohl helfen könnte, wäre die chinesische Bevölkerung technisch bei der Überwindung der Zensur zu helfen. Ich erinnere mich da an ein paar Europäer (?) die vor einiger Zeit ein Tool entwickelt haben um zensierte Zeitungsartikel in Bildform an der Zensur vorbei zu ""schmuggeln"". So oder so ähnliche könnte man versuchen die Informationen an einen großteil der Bevölkerung zu bringen. Denn ich glaube, dass einige Chinesen überhaupt nichts von den Ereignissen in HK mitbekommen.

Weiter ist es eine Schande, dass die ""demokratische"" Enklave Hongkong nach und nach von der Zentralregierung eingenommen wird. 

Nachdem die Briten Hongkong 1997 an die VR China abgetreten haben, hatte die ZK Zugeständnisse zugunsten einer demokratischeren Regionalregierung gemacht. Doch so ein Dorn im Auge der Partei konnte nicht länger steckenbleiben. So war es zu erwarten, dass der Druck auf die liberale Bevölerung in HK immer größer werden würde sich gegen die Repressionen der Hardliner aus Bejing zu wehren.

Es lässt sich nur hoffen, dass sich dort nichts ähnliches Wiederholt wie beim [Tian’anmen-Massaker](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian%E2%80%99anmen-Massaker). Auch, wenn es viele Parallelen gibt, so wir es diesmal für die ZK wohl nicht so einfach alle Erinnerungen an einen Aufschrei der Bevölkerung auszuradieren wie vor 25 Jahren.

Hiring and firing employees is already easy. They only give temporary employment (one year) contracts since basically 15 years. Banks don't give house loans on such contracts, and if you get sick or pregnant, you are not renewed.

Additionally, growing these industries is not easy because growing an industry requires entrepreneur training and networking, something we haven't done for either political or logistic reasons.

Yes neloliberalism is used like a buzzword by people that know little to nothing about economics but on the flip side - Yes, neoliberalism is a very well defined economic strategy. Reagan and Thatcher for example are some of the most recent proponents of neoliberal economics.

There was no genocide in Kosovo. There wasn't even ethnic cleansing. If anything, Serbs were the ones that were ethnically cleansed from Kosovo, which you can clearly see from these numbers:

Serbia was conducting an anti-terrorist operation in Kosovo against KLA — the same KLA which the West classified as a terrorist organization and which trafficked organs from Serb victims and smuggled heroin through Kosovo — Kosovo which is the cradle of Serbian nation, and where Serb minority was being maltreated by Albanians.

I have no data on this. Maybe she wasn't. Maybe she was using a base station that is controlled by the BND, and not aware of it. You know details? Or more assumptions? If you are fond of hypothetical questions, if they targeted Clinton's satellite handy specifically, why is there just this one incident?

&gt; Why is it only Germany who is angry? 

Who says only Germany is angry? I would assume the other countries are equally angry. But, as I have tried to explain before, which you completely ignored in favour of making up some percentages, Germany is *especially* angry because it feels backstabbed and betrayed by a nation it thought of as friend. Also, Germany values privacy highly. You heard about the Stasi and the Gestapo, I assume?

&gt; Or, rather, are you saying that the US engages in mass surveillance of all of the European Union? 

Very likely. It's especially easy for Germany, because (a) some of the main Internet connections between the US and the EU are in Germany (DE-CIX), and (b) due to the structure of the German internet, a fair amount of German-to-German traffic is actually routed outside of Germany. So

&gt; you're wrong if you think that the NSA is copying down every last thing you're doing on your computer in Germany, 

No, they are not copying down every last thing I'm doing on my computer. They are copying down every last thing that gets routed through parts of the internet they have taps on. And the Snowden documents are proof of this. Go read them.

&gt; So, do you believe that the USG/NSA is, today, conducting mass surveillance operations in Germany, the way you describe them? That the NSA is just as ""active"" in Germany today, as it was, say, two years ago or so? You think that the governments of Germany and the USA aren't working closely with one another on the entire matter? 

Yes, and yes, and the government tried to get a ""no spy"" agreement with the US, which the US flat out refused. And then they finally made a counteroffer which would include ""sharing"" even more data. Not what I call ""working closely together"". And if said repeatedly, the BND and NSA *are* working closely together on common goals. Which is fine, I have no objections.

That should also answer

&gt; and the German government is sitting there dumbfounded like a rich man's child, 

Yes, the German government looked pretty dumbfounded throughout all this. Looks like they have given up now.

And it's not that the CDU is any better than the US in this respect. They conservatives are very much in favour of keeping tabs on everybody, from the Volkszählung in the 80s to the Vorratsdatenspeicherung recently. But fortunately they get slapped down by the Bundesverfassungsgericht everytime they try. Until they try again. So not really the best government to stand up against something like this. But maybe they've learned a thing or two after they have been victims themselves.

Language policy is a key component to the Catalan question. Education here is 100% in Catalan, except for Spanish and English classes. A few parents have complained about this, which has led to the Spanish government deciding that classes should be 50/50 Catalan and Spanish. Some Catalan speakers fear that this is a first step back to reducing Catalan to second-class status.

At the same time, the PP (ruling party in Spanish govt) is reducing the need for Catalan/Valencian among public servants in the Balearic islands and Valencia, threatened to remove funding to the Valencian Academy unless it declares that Valencian and Catalan are different languages (they're not), and has renamed the Catalan language when it's used in Aragon. So it's a hot topic and some people do worry that the plan is to recentralize Spain again along very much more Castilian lines.

Edit: I should add that fewer and fewer people in the Islands and Valencia speak Catalan/Valencian. Some say that's a natural process and that rule changes are simply intended to reflect that new reality.

Speaking, on the other hand, is a whole other story.

You might struggle to find back into your sentence after a relative sentence.

Then there's dialectal and colloquial influences on standard language. One might say ""der Butter"" instead of ""die"", one might say ""besser wie"" instead of ""besser als"", switch up ""als dass"" with ""als"", not use the right past tense or something like that.

Sadly, when learning a language, you will find everyone makes mistakes, even the natives.

You have quite good infrastructure. While southern Italy maybe behind western European standards, northern Italy is more than up to standards. Of course there is room for improvment such as lowering price of energy, but that the only way to do that is to build nuclear power.

&gt; Hiring and firing employees is already easy. They only give temporary employment (one year) contracts since basically 15 years.

Hiring and firing of permanent employees is not easy and that is the problem.

* Many bigger companies have big amounts of redundant and ineffective permanent workers. They can't get rid of those and they need to use younger less expensive temporary workers to fill the caps. Essentially older generations are making the younger generations to pay.
* Temporary year long contracts still posses risks. Market situation can change radically quickly thus in worst case scenario you have people doing nothing for the rest of the year.
*  Temporary year long contracts don't buy employee loaylty. If you are employing high valued personel, you need to secure them, you need to have permanent contracts.

I for example have a permanent contract with my employeer. It means that they can't just dismiss me if they don't like my face. However if in case...

* I fail constantly at my work or behave uncostructively, they can start a procedure to fire me: essentially two written warnings that are accepted by me and the union representative to be valid, which after they could fire me with 1 months compensation (have been only a year at current employeer). The compensation can be max 6 months pay with requirement to work the whole time, but that can be only reached if I stay 10 years in the same employer.
* Market situation, production or fiscal conditions change and there are redundant workers, firm can start a procedure to fire employees by initiating co-operation negotiations which after they can fire employees they don't need. Of course they can't start another round of layoffs in the next 6 months, and if they start hiring again, they need to first check availability of workers from people who were fired.

So this is the situation in Finland, and the unfortunate trueth is that our legislation is still too rigid and unflexible for small companies.

&gt;  Banks don't give house loans on such contracts, and if you get sick or pregnant, you are not renewed.

Italian banks requirements to get loans are ridiculously hard thanks to legislation. In here 75% of the value of the appartment/house being bought acts as collateral, 10% can be handled by taking an additional insurance, and the last 15% you need to handle by yourself, for example having your parents give collateral or you having that capital already.

Anyways, your banks and housing markets are another big internal problem that your legislation has created. First of all, there isn't enough new housing being build. Part of the reason being that constructors sell appartment buildins as whole, not as parts. In here we have such thing called as a housing company. When an constructor constructs a new housing complex, they transfer actual owning of the complex to a new company, which issues then stock back to the constructor that allows holder of stocks to live in an appartment. These stocks are then sold to people. In here, most appartment complexes are their own companies which are owned by the actual people living in those appartments. Secondly there isn't enough financing made available to people, the case about your banks having crazy requirements to give new loans.

&gt; Additionally, growing these industries is not easy because growing an industry requires entrepreneur training and networking, something we haven't done for either political or logistic reasons.

When you make starting and running an company easy, anybody with a business idea can do it. You don't need entrepreneur training to be an entrepneur.

Capitalism is a changing historical phenomenon, its neoliberal phase is for example that strange phase where there is a growing lack of international regulation such as tariffs, there is more and more free trade, yet, inside nations it is fairly heavily taxes and regulated. 

Generally speaking any system is capitalist, that is largely based on capital investors owning businesses, but someone else doing the work. For example self-employed farmers and shopkeepers are not capitalist, they are, maybe, pre-capitalist.  Soviets were state capitalist. There is generally not a non-capitalist economy today, it is not really possible at this level of technology. 

The regulatory aspects of it all are actually a secondary coordination, they all tend to address various aspects of this setup. Tariffs and trade barriers exist because capital is internationally mobile, much more so than pre-capitalist businesses. Redistribution largely exists because of the generic income difference between capital owners and workers, and regulation exists largely because capital is so flexible and efficiently pursuing profits that it tends to work around unwritten rules that worked in a pre-capitalist economy. And of course the Soviets and North Korea came up with the ""genius"" idea that maybe it can be somehow be solved if the state is the only, monopolistic capital owner (it was a bad idea obv.).

At any rate, what I described above is not even a leftist perspective at all, just a realistic view of capitalism in history, instead of usual libertarian stories that don't even talk about reality at all.

Because those clothes can be manufactured much more cheaply there than in Europe, not only because of labor costs, but also because they have much bigger scales. That is a fact of life. We used to have textile and clothing manufacturing in Finland, those days are long gone. The firms that are left either specialised to segments that are small and need special knowhow, or moved their production of the country and concentrated their efforts here to marketing and design.

Italy has much more than that. There is huge industrial base in northern Italy. Huge amount of small family owned firms that are excellent in their own field, for example making textile machines and highly automated production lines for textile factories in China.

Part of the reason for this was the reunification, a lot of government spending, especially in social security net etc. Was cut so that we were able to pay for it.

That made people in germany feel obviously less secure.

Add to that that a lot of the east german industry was cut because it wasnt comprtiziv and only still existed due to communism and that a lot of businesses then moved from the west to the east, because the government basically paid them money for that in their plan to help east germany.

So germans everywhere loose jobs and the social security is cut, so a lot of germans feel really unsecure, which one of the worst feelings for germans since we are more pessimistic than a lot of other nations.

So from then on the unions basically said: you dont need to increase our wages much other than for inflation, but in return we want more job security, wed rather earn 100bucks less but be sure we still have our job tomorrow.

Now after reunification and crisis both over, unions are stsrting to rightfulky want higher wages, so i think we are going to see some increases there in the near future!! :D

Prima cosa: fissati in mente la paga/contratto che vorresti in base alle tue esperienze professionali, sia quella desiderata sia il minimo che sei disposto ad accettare. Cerca di scovare i valori medi di mercato, ti potrà venire utile se devi motivare le tue richieste.

Seconda cosa: fai in modo che sia il datore di lavoro a fare la prima proposta. Se ti chiede che paga ti aspetti durante il colloquio conoscitivo, di una supercazzola tipo ""Prima di discutere dello stipendio mi piacerebbe sapere di più su questo lavoro e sulle mie mansioni"", o anche ""sono sicuro che farete un'offerta adeguata rispetto alla mie capacità"". Non parlare dello stipendio, se richiesto passa la palla al datore di lavoro.

Terza cosa: prima di discutere dello stipendio, assicurati che siano veramente interessati ad averti. Quindi anche se ti buttano l'esca troppo presto, non abboccare. Prima di discutere dello stipendio devi averli convinti, devono pensare a te già come un nuovo dipendente.

Quarta cosa: alla fine si arriva alla discussione vera e propria. Se sei stato più bravo del datore di lavoro, sarà lui a fare la prima offerta. Se superiore alle tue aspettative, accetta, se rientra nel range minimo-massimo che ti eri prefisso, prova a contrattare qualche benefit accessorio o di premi produzione. Se l'offerta è sotto il tuo minimo, fagli capire che sei interessato seriamente al posto di lavoro ma la sua offerta è troppo bassa. Devi sempre poter motivare le tue richieste. Ricordati: alla fine della contrattazione, entrambe le parti devono essere soddisfatte.

TL;DR 

Prima regola del colloquio di lavoro: non si parla mai dello stipendio

Seconda regola del colloquio di lavoro: non si parla mai dello stipendio

Terza regola del colloquio di lavoro: se qualcuno tira fuori lo stipendio, fine del combattimento.

EDIT: nota a margine: ovviamente non arrivare a scontri frontali che ti possano precludere l'assunzione. Quindi se ti viene chiesto il tuo vecchio stipendio e chi ti fa il colloquio non è disposto a ricevere risposte tangenziali chiudendo corto con domande dirette, non tirare troppo la corda. Potrai sempre contrattare più avanti, dovrai solo far più fatica per motivargli le tue richieste.",0,1412161382,null,0,1412161710,0,ckxcla0,t3_2hwq92,t1_ckxcla0,t3_2hwq92,null,1426739287,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

Of course there is room for improvment such as lowering price of energy, but that the only way to do that is to build nuclear power.

We can't. We don't have sites, we don't have uranium, we don't have places for waste, we don't have the skills (all research was shut down in 1986), we have a highly seismic, highly prone to floods country. We could produce tons of solar energy, but the germans prefer to put thousans of solar panels on their roofs that generate close to nothing, instead of saying: hi italians. You have a lot of sun, we buy solar panels, you install them on your roofs, and you give back the energy to us. That's european collaboration. What they are doing is not.
 
&gt; Hiring and firing of permanent employees is not easy and that is the problem.
&gt; Many bigger companies have big amounts of redundant and ineffective permanent workers.

And you think that firing them would solve the issue? Yes, you probably keep the company alive, but now you have plenty of unemployed people.

&gt; They can't get rid of those and they need to use younger less expensive temporary workers to fill the caps. Essentially older generations are making the younger generations to pay.

Well, that's something we knew. They stole our future, and hogging our present. 

&gt; Temporary year long contracts don't buy employee loaylty. If you are employing high valued personel, you need to secure them, you need to have permanent contracts.

Tell that to our worker unions.

You are a handful of people. That does not necessarily scale to 60 millions.


&gt; Anyways, your banks and housing markets are another big internal problem that your legislation has created. First of all, there isn't enough new housing being build.

I can guarantee there are plenty of houses that have been built and sit unsold since ten years. The building market is oversaturated.

&gt; In here we have such thing called as a housing company. When an constructor constructs a new housing complex, they transfer actual owning of the complex to a new company, which issues then stock back to the constructor that allows holder of stocks to live in an appartment.

Yes, that's like in Denmark and Sweden. They are long term scams. They force you to pay a lot every month, and they are in practice rentals, where suddenly the association decides to redo all the kitchens and you have to shell out other money, Additionally, the apartment is not yours and you can't do anything with it except live in it. That's also why your rental market is fucked up.

I think the Germans can certainly be criticised for foisting their inflation phobic, mercantilist agenda onto the rest of Europe.   This has caused terrible damage.

When it comes to dealing with that, it's a question of priorities.

I think it's more important to create the economic conditions that lean away from catastrophic political error such as electing Le Pen as President of France in 2022.

If it is necessary to have an increased German trade surplus to achieve the growth in non German Europe that hopefully avoids a Le Pen year zero, that's a payable price.

Or even not even that one, often there is no tension at all - but still a certain celebration of ethnic identity. It is way more complex than some folks being all hatey.

One of my pet theories is that originally sometime back in history the whole idea of race must have been invented in Britain as a way to group Angles, Saxons, Normans, Celts, all kinds of ethnies into one common white/British race. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just makes things clear like the whole idea of ethnicity died long, long ago in Britain (and was taken over first by race then by anti-racism) so you are not really expected to ""get"" ethnicities :) Here is an interesting example: given how Serbs and Croats look exactly the same way, there is no racial difference, and talk almost the same way, mutually intelligibly, why do they tend have strongly different identities?

What, you mean the one that flat-out says:

The statement is pretty clear: 

&gt; Uninvited OSCE military observers attempted to enter the region four times but were turned away, sometimes after warning shots were fired,[95][96] which was another reason given for not dispatching referendum observers.

So all observers were welcome, except those who actually intended to appear.

No, you cannot invade a country because they seek to join a club you cannot be a part of. If that is seriously your best validation for it then no wonder Russia is so ostracized.

Ukraine is entitled to seek a future with anyone it wants. The EU offers a better economic future in the long run than Russia, whose sole ability to coerce governments to remain ""under it's influence"" seems to be armed invasion.

Nevermind the false equivalncy of Russia, a former world power dependant upon energy exports, and ""the West"", an agglomoration of dozens and dozens of sovereign nations with their own interests.

You have enough sites, for crying out loud, Japanease have enough sites, so should you. In case of uranium, you buy that from the world markets, the French would be eager to supply you. Same too with plants. And at the end of day when storing the waste, you just build a large tunnel deep enough and that is the end of that.

&gt; We could produce tons of solar energy, but the germans prefer to put thousans of solar panels on their roofs that generate close to nothing, instead of saying: hi italians. You have a lot of sun, we buy solar panels, you install them on your roofs, and you give back the energy to us. That's european collaboration. What they are doing is not.

You could not produce solar panels, you and neither Germans are competetive against Chinease producers. Not to mention that the whole deal with solar is just huge waste of money. Without subsidies, nobody in Europe would be installing solar panels.

&gt;  And you think that firing them would solve the issue? Yes, you probably keep the company alive, but now you have plenty of unemployed people.

Is it really better to drive the company to a point where it can't anymore invest into itself and is essentially a zombie, or in a worst case scenario goes bankcrupt? Then you don't have that company anymore and you still have all those people unemployed. No, the better idea is to let companies scale down operations if and when they need to do so.

I doubt that. If there would be enough housing, young Italians would move out from their parents either when they start to study or atleast when they graduate and get their first job. However as that isn't happening, I would think there to be a problem with the amount of housing.

&gt;  Yes, that's like in Denmark and Sweden. They are long term scams. They force you to pay a lot every month, and they are in practice rentals, where suddenly the association decides to redo all the kitchens and you have to shell out other money, Additionally, the apartment is not yours and you can't do anything with it except live in it. That's also why your rental market is fucked up.

No, you are mixing **housing stock companies** to **right to occupy the appartment housing companies**. In **housing stock company** you buy shares of the company that give ownershpi and right to live/handle certain appartment. In **right to occupy the apartment housing companies** you buy just the right to live in an appartment, not ownership of the housing company itself. Most appartments in here are of type **housing stock company**.

For example, my appartment building just turned 54 year old and thus we had a big renovatio: water pipes and plumming; electricity; heating; etc.. systems renewed. The cost of the renovation is 1500e per sqm. Our **housing stock company** takes care of everything including getting approx 1.5 million EUR loan from the bank. After the renovation is over, we the shareholders have a chance to either pay back our share immidiately or in the next 10 years time.

It is really handy way to organize everything, and it really doesn't cost much. My appartment is only 22.5sqm and I pay arround 120e per month as maintenance charge that includes Property tax + Water + Heat + Cleaning of common areas + Other maintenance + Company Burecracy (which is outsourced to a hosting company)

&gt; But you need to be one not to go bankrupt.

There is one simple rule of running a business: track your money flow, if more money comes in than goes out, you are doing fine. Of course you also have to track your long term commitments and long term obligations, but still...

Mulhouse does seem to be twinned with the city of Antwerp, though, so be aware that there's a heightened danger of meeting people from Antwerp in Mulhouse.

* The biggest town is [La Rochelle](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:060905_Overlooking_Old_Town_and_Harbour.JPG), known for its [old port](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:La_Rochelle_Vieux-Port.JPG) and its [aquarium](http://www.viree-malin.fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/requins-aquarium-la-rochelle.jpg).

It's also great for [cycling](http://www.iledere-infos.fr/carte-des-pistes-cyclables-de-l-ile-de-re-12-40-76.html).
* There is another island called [Oléron](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%C3%8Ele_d%27Ol%C3%A9ron_aerial_view.jpg), a little less expensive and touristy than Ré, but it also has [nice towns](http://www.ot-chateau-oleron.fr/files/2013/11/Le-Chateau-Thierry.jpg), [beaches](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Plage_de_Gatseau.JPG) and a big pine forest.

* Rochefort is another interesting town with a lot of historical buildings, such as one of the last [transporter bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochefort-Martrou_Transporter_Bridge) in the world and a [long building](http://www.lelogisdelahuppe.com/medias/images/php3yxwcs.jpg) where they used to make ropes for ships.
* [Saintes](http://www.saintes-tourisme.fr/IMG/jpg/image_7.jpg) is also nice because it has Roman monuments, notably an [amphitheater](http://www.cabinet-dromer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Saintes_amphitheatre.jpg) and [an arch](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arc_de_Germanicus.JPG).

If there would be enough housing, young Italians would move out from their parents either when they start to study or atleast when they graduate and get their first job. However as that isn't happening, I would think there to be a problem with the amount of housing.

No. The problem is that houses cost 150k eur and in Italy a doctor earns 1300 eur for a 4 years contract. A postman earns 1100, and a waiter 1200. People don't leave their parents' houses because they can't afford a house. Italy is littered with houses with a ""for sale"" billboard outside. Nobody can afford them.

&gt; It is really handy way to organize everything 

No, and in Italy it would never work, nor anybody would accept to buy an apartment at those conditions. Who pays if the company goes bankrupt? who pays if the roof collapses? who pays if they decide to redo all the kitchens but you just redid yours? Housing is property for us, and we don't want to rely on anything because we know that we can't rely on anything.

&gt; There is one simple rule of running a business: track your money flow, if more money comes in than goes out, you are doing fine.

Not necessarily. Money is just a number. if they start devaluing the currency, you are screwed anyway. Same if they decide to change the tax rate and your assumptions about the budget are altered. Or if you end up with an earthquake in north Italy like two years ago.

&gt; Of course you also have to track your long term commitments and long term obligations, but still... I really don't see what is hard on running a business.

false,[deleted],null,null,"This sounds suspiciously like some kind of dumbed-down, watered-down version of the Keynesian model. 

There is no model that would say that savings are a universal evil, that would be more than silly to say, for two reasons, the economy is not only about ""flows"" i.e. selling stuff for money but also ""stocks"" i.e. owning stuff, so basically if everybody saves money and puts it into building a nice home then we may have less income, but still we get nice homes. Saving is a way to increase stuff that is owned, and it would be crazy to say that everybody should be liquidating their homes, cars, heirloom jewelry just to increase the ""flow"", the circulation of sales and purchases.

The other reason is that savings are rarely stuffed into a pillow, they are put into bank accounts and banks loan them out and they get spent  - often on investments.

Rather, Keynesian models merely say savings can be a problem in **specific circumstances** such as banks not loaning or people not trusting banks, when firms literally hoard money because they expect deflation or shocks, so they don't even put into some form of savings account (where the bank can invest it) just basically let it roll around on a current account expecting to have to spend it at any time.

Savings are a problem only when literally nobody, not even the bank, spends or invests that money, this is what the normal Keynesian models say.

Put it a bit differently - if you save money but not expect to spend it anytime soon you will invest it, which is a way of spending: you can just put it into a savings account and the bank will loan it out to some dude who wants to build a house. So you hoard money only when you fear volatility, deflation or shocks and you save with an intent to spend (you save literally to provide yourself a cushion money to spend if things turn bad) but this does not actually happen - that, and only that kind of saving is problematic!

Most of this ""saved"" money we  talk here is NOT actually saved - it is put into a savings account then loaned out to someone else, who of course have **spent** it on a new car or house or business. This is actually spent money, it is a ""saving"" only because it became a debt i.e. whoever spent it will have to pay it back. If you loan someone €100K for buying a house then it is a saving from your perspective, as you can use it later on (when paid back) but in the economy it is NOT a saving but a bunch of money spent on a house.",0,1412167038,null,0,false,0,ckxdyl1,t3_2hyux6,t1_ckxdyl1,t1_ckxbfy4,null,1426738542,17,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,17

Öffentlich zur Geschlechterdiskriminierung aufrufen (und nichts anderes ist doch die Passage, wo er sagt Frauen sollten ohne Erlaubnis nicht das Haus verlassen dürfen) hat doch nichts mit kleinem Wortschatz und Unerfahrenheit beim Predigen zu tun. Ein klares ""das war grober Unfug, was ich damals erzählt habe, ich glaube an die Gleichstellung der Geschlechter ohne Ausnahmen"" ist das einzige was man sagen kann, wenn man sich von solchen Aussagen wirklich distanzieren möchte, kein wages ""ich war unerfahren"".

Der Bosbach hat für mich leider das bessere Bild abgegeben. Abgesehen von seiner Aussage, dass sich alle Muslime von den IS Terroristen distanzieren sollten, die natürlich wie auch in der Sendung erklärt quatsch war, hatte er mit seiner Kernaussage schon recht: Religionsfreiheit hört genau da auf, wo sie mit unseren Gesetzen in Konflikt gerät.

Da hätte Herr Kamouss einfach mal sagen sollen ""da stimme ich ihnen völlig zu, wir können hier in Deutschland nicht nach der Scharia leben"", anstatt irgendwas von ""ob der Islam demokratiefeindlich ist, hängt von der Definition von Demokratie ab"" zu faseln.


Dass er in die Sendung eingeladen wurde, um ein ganz klares Bild abzugeben, und eigentlich von Anfang an keine richtige Chance gegen die Platzhirsche Buschkofski und Bosbach hatte. ist klar, damit hat er recht. Und jeder wäre wohl etwas irritiert, wenn er in eine Talkshow eingeladen würde nur um dann quasi lauter Dinge vorgeworfen zu kriegen, die irgendwelche extremistischen Idioten zu verantworten haben, die nichts mit einem gemeinsam haben außer dass man den selben Glauben teilt.

Trotzdem fand ich seinen Auftritt unglücklich (was er ja auch einsieht) und die Korrekturen, die da durch den Artikel nachgereicht werden, nicht weitreichend genug.

Secondly, Germany and the Netherlands have an excessive surplus according to the Macro-Economic imbalances procedure which all Eurozone member states are subject to. Tellingly the imbalances procedure set the limit for surpluses at 6 percent while the limit for deficits is 4, allowing these countries to enjoy high surpluses just under the limit. Now they have breached them and have they been told to correct this? No. Have they been threatened with sanctions as part of the corrective arm? No. 

The Eurozone is too big to allow for the kind of export led growth that Germany has benefitted from (it's the second largest economy in the world after the United States). I'm not saying that the peripheral countries shouldn't export more but there has to be greater demand for them to move towards recovery.

His murder was ordered by Oswald Swanzy, a staunch British Unionist and District Inspector of the RIC.

No it isn't. ""General condemnation of economic liberalization policies"" means **all** economic liberalization policies. The summary says ""negative term **associated** with **radical** economic reforms"". 

That's the difference between saying that cults are dangerous and religion is dangerous.

&gt;You may ask how did the meaning change, but I think it's quite obvious. It has been excessively used..

You are generalizing your personal experience in your own country into applying the whole world. 

&gt;leftists as a replacement word for capitalism to reuse old communist aguments since bashing capitalism isn't cool any more.

You are confusing ""leftists"" with ""communists"". 

&gt;Yet it started with very specific meaning not empty as you wrote in your other comment. You proved it yourself with that research article quote.

The meaning of the word dates to ""back to (classic) liberalism in modern times"". That's the literal meaning of the world and you can pretty easily come up with it if you are aware of the original classic liberalism of 1860s. 

German Freiberg School did some thinking on what neoliberalism was in the 1930s, but that it was -- thinking -- before politicians started to use it in political fashion in the 1970s. When today we speak of neoliberalism, we either mean the problems caused by the original liberalism in 1860s or that caused by neoliberalism in 1970s, not what Freiberg School thought in between. 

The connotation changed when instead of spin of ""neoliberalism fixing the problems of classic liberalism"" and few theories from 1930s we got actual real cases and they weren't positive. It's the same thing we got with fascism (which was the golden boy in the 1920s, 1930s and now succesful countries that could be defined as fascist don't want to identify so -- instead fascist just means ""bad"").

I'm also 27, and outside of a family holiday or 2 when I was like 11 to disneyland, I'd never been abroad.  (I'm from the UK btw).

When I was 19 me and some friends decided, on a whim, to use student money to travel to Japan for a few weeks. Amazing. I already knew a lot of Japanese growing up, so I became the default translator and tourguide for everyone, but that was fine.

Then a year later I went to Barcelona, then months later to Poland, then Germany, Sweden, France, Slovenia, Czech republic and Japan another time. Once the travel bug hits you, its really hard to resist. The worlds a huge place and theres so much to see and experience that once you start, you start to wonder why everyone isn't doing the same thing. Made me feel sorry for my grandparents who don't even own passports, they're 80 and never left England before, eventhough its so easy for us to move around.

I genuinely think everyone should travel to a few countries, see the world outside their own culture, really makes you appreciate your own country and see it in a very different light, in my case I really noticed just how many issues England has,  I stayed in some of those countries for months, doing freelance work, and really noticed the pro's and cons of living in each place.

Once they figured out the length of one meter, they calculated 1 dm^3 and they filled 1 dm^3 with water and said that that was exactly one Litre and one Kg. 

The kilogram was later based on something else. The International Prototype Kilogram (IPK). The IPK is made of a platinum alloy known as “Pt‑10Ir”, which is 90% platinum and 10% iridium (by mass) and is machined into a right-circular cylinder (height = diameter) of 39.17 millimeters to minimize its surface area.

We base the kilogram on the IPK and found out, that 1 Litre of water is not exactly 1 IPK. Modern measurements of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water, which is pure distilled water with an isotopic composition representative of the average of the world’s oceans, show it has a density of 0.999975 ±1×10−6 kg/L at its point of maximum density (3.984 °C) under one standard atmosphere (760 torr) of pressure.[27] Thus, a cubic decimeter of water at its point of maximum density is only 25 parts per million less massive than the IPK; that is to say, the 25 milligram difference shows that the scientists over 215 years ago managed to make the mass of the Kilogram of the Archives equal that of a cubic decimeter of water at 4 °C, with a margin of error at most within the mass of a single excess grain of rice.",0,1412170237,null,0,false,0,ckxf25x,t3_2hzchk,t1_ckxf25x,t1_ckxe391,null,1426738029,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

The major difference between racism in Spain and in the US is that there is lettle experience of other races for a typical Spaniard. Since there are so few people with different skin color, there's no racial hate but curiosity in many cases. 

If you had a bunch of green people living a couple blocks from your home that were obnoxious, you could develop a hatred for the green race. If you had only seen a couple of green people in your life, you could be xenophobe and a bigot, but not a racist. 

I've lived in both Spain and US, and while in Spain you can find people in sport courts (Not all of them, mostly soccer stadiums) shouting effensive slurs to the players, and there are, as almost everywhere, a small minority of neo-nazis and that kind of people, I've almost never seen anybody to behave towards a person in a different way because of his race. 

On top of that, there's no self shame in Spain concerning racism because it's never been a segregating country. So, things that could have been an scandal in America, like the basketball national team doing the ""chick eyes"" are not even news here, neither for the public nor for the (few) Spaniard-Chinese people.

In the US racism gets a different meaning because everyone older than 50 remember segregationism and redlining, and many have even used bathrooms for their race only. Mostly because of that, America is a country with a very low tolerance for public expression of racism, but I wouldn't say its less racist than Europe.

Anyway, this's just a rant. It's an issue much more difficult than I can grasp and comparing countries/places is futile.

They want to ban 'racist' parties after SD's success
Published September 29, 2014 at 09:45
DOMESTIC. A new government should declare its intention to ""prohibit organizations which promote racial discrimination"" to come to terms with SD's electoral success. It argues academics Stefan Jonsson and Elena Namli, and is backed by the political scientist Andreas Johansson Heino.


Sweden should ban political parties and organizations that incite racial discrimination, writes Stefan Jonsson, professor of ethnicity, and Elena Namli, Professor of Russian Studies at Dagens Nyheter. they is backed by Andreas Johansson Heino, a political scientist at the Social Liberal Timbro.


""This means concretely that Sweden should follow the sections of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,"" wrote the academics in DN and continues:


""Regardless if we denote the Sweden Democrats' ideology as' racist ',' xenophobe ',' immigration critical ',' nationalist 'or whatever, so we know therefore this: the party is fueling racism by pointing out a particular social group as the root of all problems"" .


A third academic, Andreas Johansson Heino, have quickly joined the proposal.

""Stefan Jonsson wants to ban racist parties. Not unreasonably,"" writes Heinö on Twitter.  , he warns against demarcation problems and suggest that Jonsson actually former Liberal Party has called for a racist party.

After receiving criticism from the former SD senator Erik Almqvist defended himself Heinö with ""several"" other countries have, or at least discussed, prohibition of Nazism and Communism.

A critical part of a modern nation is a well-trained, equipped and effective military to protect itself and it's interests. The matter of fact is that history shows and logic dictates that if you are not willing or not able to protect those interests then they will be lost to someone who is.

The obvious example today is Russia. It's in the EU's long-term interests to open up ties with Ukraine; it's a large nation of over 40 million with a large manufacturing industry in the east and a lot of room for economic growth and investment, and on top of this it's got historical ties to Europe, is Christian and is making overtures towards us. Aiding Ukraine and allowing it to apply for the process of incorporation into the EU would show the world that we are unified in our goals and willing to protect our interests, and in particular show a beligerent, economically unstable and politcally jingoistic Russia run on nationalistic rhetoric that it cannot bully it's neighbours simply because it believes them to be in it's sphere of influence.

Now obviously I've made a leap from talking about Germany to talking about the EU, and I want to acknowledge both that they are not the same and that it is not and should not be Germany's burden to police the EU's interests. That being said, a heightened sense of military cohesion between the EU, led by the Big 3 that drive it only help Europe's aims in the long run. The problem with Europe's military software/hardware versus a system like AEGIS is well-known and owing to a lack of cohesion and a uniform military policy, and this is something the evolving EU should seek to address.

And I know German's have a particular hang-up over their military, which honestly surprises me with how universal your sentiment is over the issue. I can't think of another nation in history so cautious about it's future power-projection because of it's actions in the past and that's an admirable trait. That being said, I doubt that many still fear that Merkel will lead a nuclear-powered Fourth Reich out from the dark heart of Europe.

Honestly, because we need EU protection from our politicians. Our politicians have full control over what's going on and can screw around with laws as they see fit. They can skip over stuff they don't like, they can ignore stuff they don't like, and they have the border to protect us from fleeing so easily elsewhere. Not so under the EU. If in the EU, they can't make shitty laws willy-nilly. They also don't have the border to box us in. If they fuck up, they know we can leave at any time.

&gt;We can no longer forbid rich foreigners to buy up agricultural land.

Under current Vucic leadership, we're selling our valuable agricultural land to the Arabs. We're still screwed either way.

&gt;We can no longer make laws that treat local businesses preferentially. 

That would be the point of the EU. Imagine if you wanted to export your product to e.g. Spain, but Spain has imposed preferential treatment for their products... yours simply can't make it. What chance do you have? This is an issue we have in Serbia. Low quality domestic products make it to the shelves, while quality imports are taxed and burdened to the point where it's not feasible to buy them anymore. Some of our companies are such dicks that you can even buy some of their products cheaper in Montenegro, Macedonia, the EU or even Canada than here at home in Serbia! How about that?

Sure, you get much more competition, but you also get a huge EU market to sell your product. If the locals don't want it, surely somebody else in this huge market will?

There are plenty of drawbacks, but it can't be all sunshine and rainbows, unfortunately.

&gt;Overally the country is not becoming any richer or better organized due to it

What history had shown is that the time we had ridiculously little military spending also was the most propserous timespan, and the longest time we have had peace in written history within our borders. 

&gt; That being said, a heightened sense of military cohesion between the EU, led by the Big 3 that drive it only help Europe's aims in the long run.

The problem with that idea is that German interests are not British interests are not French interests (and, for that matter, are not Cypriot interests), and heightened military cohesion would eventually lead to troops fighting wars for other EU countries against their people's best interests. 

Now, how you are going to explain to a population that their sons return in body bags because for some reason someone in Brussles dislikes a people's right to self-determination in one case, but not another one... You will have to make some kind of propaganda narrative, give them a bogeyman... 

Such use of military forces will likely cause enough tension within Germany to shut down the EU project completely.

&gt; That being said, I doubt that many still fear that Merkel will lead a nuclear-powered Fourth Reich out from the dark heart of Europe.

I don't begrudge you that, but my point still stands.

&gt; The problem with that idea is that German interests are not British interests are not French interests (and, for that matter, are not Cypriot interests), and heightened military cohesion would eventually lead to troops fighting wars for other EU countries against their people's best interests. 

This is why it's important to compromise if we are going to continue with the EU. It's important that we have a military capable of protecting our interests, but one that is used with appreciable nous. Getting there is a tricky path, asbolutely, but it *is* necessary to get there if the EU is going to continue. Obviously military growth should go hand-in-hand with evolve diplomatic measures between member-states (and abroad) and evolving policy initiatives.

&gt; Now, how you are going to explain to a population that their sons return in body bags because for some reason someone in Brussles dislikes a people's right to self-determination in one case, but not another one... You will have to make some kind of propaganda narrative, give them a bogeyman... 

I know, it's a harsh reality. Why should a son of Scotland die because an English Prime Minister tells him to go to war? We should a free man from Wexford die because the ard ri has said so? See, here's my belief, and I think it's one of the EU's strengths; an increasingly educated and contented citizenry will be more understanding of the needs of the supranational body and more willing to enter into the defence of the different parts of it for reasons beyond nationalistic jingoism. As one of the most prosperous and educated parts of the world I think most Europeans understand and will continue to understand the need for unity and protection of all member-states because it's a hallmark of an open enlightened, successful people. 

That's the long-term goal, anyway.

&gt; Go ask the Greeks :P.

Yes, well ...

*ahem*

&gt; You are aware that Germany, in fact, is considered a ""screwdriver-nation""? 

I hadn't actually heard that specific term before but yes, I think we're all aware of Germany's fearsome technological and military potential.

If you're particularly in love with some region, and that region has its own language, learn it also. After this, you MAY have a chance to get a job here.

Last year I did consulting work for an Austrian company. The owner was completely convinced that WSJ only speaks the truth about any issue and is a reputable source of news and advice. He wanted to basy company decisions of his medium-sized company in Austria on things he read in WSJ. It was hilarious and sad at the same time.

He also was completely deluded about the US and Canada and how they are lands of opportunity that welcome competition and are great for smaller companies. No. They aren't. Your company would be immediately killed by entry barriers and the terrible business environment there, the majors would destroy you and your business model. Man, it was hard to convince him that it's better to focus on his established business and his expansion to East Asia (a region which he considered ""unstable"" and ""not business friendly"" as a whole).

I never facepalmed as often as when I was developing entry strategies and layouts with him.

Hunting is very much a working class / middle class pursuit in rural America.  Associating it with ""rich assholes"" is more of a european thing.

The whole American ""gun thing""  is complicated.  It's perceived as: (A) defense against tyrannical gov't, (B) defense against your fellow citizen in the event the gov't is unreliable, and (C) defense against foreign invasion.

Sì.  Scrivi? Ora ad esempio sto facendo strisce sui pirati per un altro sito. Alcune le ho cmq scritte io però. 

&gt;* come hai iniziato?

Alle medie / liceo ero bravo a disegnare poi ho smesso che dovevo fare l'uni e preferivo smettere del tutto visto che 
tanto non l'avrei mai fatto. All'uni ho ripreso perché sono un coglione.

&gt;* come vorresti finire?

Beh vorrei fosse la mia professione ma siccome non lo sarà mai un giorno mi romperò di nuovo e smettero del tutto

&gt;Non è un ama, puoi pure non rispondere :D

The Hungarian experience is that protection from politicians is not possible, there are all kinds of shitty laws - although it is true that now that hundreds of thousands of people left, they might start to take notice...  sure the EU is telling Orbán that, I don't know, fucking with NGO's is not really cool, but he does not really care and the interesting thing is that the EU seems to always criticize things they find too authoritarian, like controlling the media, but they somehow do not criticize stuff that matters more for locals, namely corruption and economic things like renting out state owned agricultural land to cronies. So precisely those things that affect the direct livelihood of people is something somehow the EU cannot really enforce, while they tend to focus on criticizing things that does not matter so much to people like harassing the political opposition or something. So at any rate the protection does not really seem so helpful now.

I think what you wrote about business sounds more like an economics textbook than reality... the issue is that it is simply not possible to compete against 1) much more capital 2) decades of higher subsidies in agriculture. Even in agriculture, Spanish tomatoes and Danish meat is cheaper because simply there is more money, better technology and competing with that is pretty much hopeless. 

However, the main issue is not even making products, but retail so distributing products, banks, utilities.

You are perfectly right that is very good that if someone has a unique, special new product idea it is good to have a big EU market to sell it but frankly this is a very small part of the economy. Most of the economy is all about the boring old things: eat wheat, heat with electricity, buy bricks for building a house... and it is pretty much so that whoever has more money offers it for cheaper as then the technology is better.

My point is: do not see the economy like some Silicon Valley people making all kinds of great new products. It is the same old boring but necessary food, energy, retail shops, clothes, mortgages... 

I am 36 and it is true that the ""supply"" side is improving a lot, lots of nice restaurants and whatnot: it is the ""demand"" side, like jobs, job security and suchlike decreasing... and what is the weirdest today that clearly the many good new restaurants in Budapest do have customers, so some folks have money, but it is not the normal way like learn a degree, apply for jobs... people who do this are underpaid, yet somehow quite some people seem to be able to get money from other sources.",0,1412175169,null,0,1412175478,0,ckxh84a,t3_2hvzzd,t1_ckxh84a,t1_ckxfgnu,null,1426737019,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

""more better"": around 1 million

""way better"": 6 million

""way much better"":4.8 million

""way more better"": 1.7 million. 


From this we can conclude that way better and much better are the favored expressions. The fact that ""more better"" returns questions about grammar that state that it is wrong, and the fact that ""way more better"" and ""more better"" have the lowest amount of results suggests that they are incorrect usages in standard English.

They both have dialogs, exercises, pictures, ""about the culture"" sections, just in slightly different order. Come to think of it, it's weird how similar they are.

Neue Horizonte just came out in 8th edition, which means you can find the 7th edition used for reasonably cheap. I actually prefer the layout of the 7th edition. Either of them new is absurdly expensive, around $200+.

If you just want the basic grammar tables with explanation, without the exercises and little pictures, try [Barron's German Grammar](http://www.amazon.com/German-Grammar-Barrons-Paul-Graves/dp/0812042964/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412176178&amp;sr=8-14&amp;keywords=german+grammar).

There's also a really nice iPhone app called ""Kleine Grammatik"", which has all the grammar tables in it.

Per quanto riguarda gli appunti o si usa ancora carta e penna (che trovo in certi casi migliore) e si scrive su un quaderno oppure molti lettori di PDF per tablet (come anche per PC) danno la possibilità di aggiungere note di testo / sottolineare / evidenziare in qualsiasi parte del libro. Per scrivere basta una tastiera buona che corregge gli eventuali errori ed un po' di abitudine, alla fine ci si guadagna nel fatto che non ci sono più problemi di spazio, tutto è più ordinato e magari è anche più veloce. 

Per la questione della vista: all'inizio può essere difficile a leggere per lungo tempo ma grazie alle ore (per non dire giorni o settimane) passate al PC o sul Tablet a leggere reddit, programmare, giocare via via ci si abitua.

For food you can always go to McDonalds or Quick (France's version of mcD) as a way of saving up money, if not you can go into a supermarket and buy some ready to eat meals which are prepared the same day and you can also go into a bakery and spend around 5eur

Most controversial was the Augustów bypass, which would take the route through the wetlands of the Rospuda Valley, the last area of its kind remaining in Europe,[citation needed] and an area protected by EU law as part of the European Natura 2000 Network. In July 2007 Polish Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński halted work on the bypass after the European Commission applied for an immediate injunction.[2] The Polish environment minister Jan Szyszko had agreed to the route, despite receiving on 2007-02-28 a warning from the European Commission that Poland would be fined for going ahead with the route.

false,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt;  No. The problem is that houses cost 150k eur and in Italy a doctor earns 1300 eur for a 4 years contract. A postman earns 1100, and a waiter 1200. People don't leave their parents' houses because they can't afford a house. Italy is littered with houses with a ""for sale"" billboard outside. Nobody can afford them.

You have seriously malfunctioning job market if an doctor with 4 year contract earns just 1300 EUR month!!! Hear in Helsinki just graduated doctor will earn at min that 2500e (brutto). Doctors who choose to work in rural communities will usually earn 5000e to 7000e, and that is due to nobody wanting to leave big cities.

Anyway Italy is not a poor country, your GDP per capita (nominal) is  	34,714 USD while our is 47,129 USD. Your doctors should be making much more money than they do know. The job market is seriously corrupted due to young (temporary contracts) vs. old (permanent contracts).

&gt; No, and in Italy it would never work, nor anybody would accept to buy an apartment at those conditions. Who pays if the company goes bankrupt? who pays if the roof collapses? who pays if they decide to redo all the kitchens but you just redid yours? Housing is property for us, and we don't want to rely on anything because we know that we can't rely on anything.

I have not heard of housing stock companies that have went bankrupt. They are not in business, they are just there as legal vehicle to manage things. However if an housing stock company would go bankrupt, the owners would be shielded as it is a limited liability company, however they would loose their apartments.

In case if the roof collapses, due to severe storms, the stock owners will pay it. Of course the housing stock company will fix it right away either by using its own capital or buy taking a loan from the bank. The same is true with other kind of repairs.

In case of kitchens, they can't decide to redo all kitchens. What you have inside your apartment is your responsibility, essentially anything inside your walls. However what is responsibility of the housing stock company is the overall building and its shape. And there is legislation that dictates what a housing stock company can and can't do. For example to initiate a major repair like pluming renovation, there has to be an actual need for that and 50% of stock owners have to accept the decision to start a repair. However what the owners have to take into account is that any damages done by for example leaking pluming will have to compensated by the housing stock company, thus meaning that it will come from the pocket of the owners.

&gt;  Not necessarily. Money is just a number. if they start devaluing the currency, you are screwed anyway. Same if they decide to change the tax rate and your assumptions about the budget are altered. Or if you end up with an earthquake in north Italy like two years ago.

True if you are in imports/exports trade that is conducted outside the Eurozone. In case of tax rate, don't you just pass the cost to your customers?

&gt; Then go, become a millionaire in Italy.

The cargo capacity between Helsinki and Tallinn that is currently provided by ferries is probably sufficient, but dropping the travel time from three hours to half an hour would be a tremendous change for passenger traffic. Now it's Estonian workers visiting home over the weekend and Finnish booze tourists, but it could be just random people going to work or shopping or a business meeting ""on the other side of the city"".

From a Finnish perspective, the tunnel (along with Rail Baltica which is intrinsically connected to the project) would also bring the other Baltics and even central Europe much closer – Riga, for example, could be a shorter train journey away than Oulu in northern Finland. It'd actually connect us to Europe in many ways. Southern Finland (where almost everyone lives) is practically an island with sea on two sides, Russia on the third and a long way around on the fourth.

There have been some reports suggesting it could even be worth funding the tunnel locally, but it's so expensive that nobody seems willing to take the risk it isn't, and the ferry companies obviously lobby against the idea. Plus, it's a part of [EU strategy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-European_Transport_Networks), so they will almost certainly fund it partially anyway.

false,Toppo,FINL,Finland,"The difference with the Channel Tunnel and Helsinki-Tallinn as I see it is that the tunnel Helsinki-Tallinn would be *a direct connection* between two capitals that are way closer than London and some other capital. Tallinn and Helsinki are on the opposite shores of the same gulf, 80km apart and on clear days you can see the highest buildings of Tallinn from Helsinki. The combined population of Helsinki + Tallinn is larger than the capitals Brussels + Luxembourg city, and the distance is under a half of the distance between Brussels &amp; Luxembourg. There is already substantial traffic between the cities, the ferry taking two hours from Helsinki to Tallinn.

The Channel Tunnel isn't like London-Paris or London-Brussels. The distance between London and any capital on the other side of the channel is much larger than the distance between Helsinki and Tallinn. The Channel Tunnel does not combine two capital urban areas into a twin city. A tunnel between Helsinki and Tallinn would effectively mean that people can live in Tallinn and work in Helsinki, using the tunnel just to commute, and economic cooperation between the cities would be much greater (Helsinki being the economic hub of Finland and Tallinn being the economic hub of Estonia).

I would also assume that EU might be interested in this because of energy/climate reasons. They were not an important issue 20 years ago when the Channel Tunnel was built, but currently the EU might very well plan that public transport in the EU could shift focus more on rails in the future, meaning that one could more easily travel the capitals Helsinki-(Tallinn-Riga-Warsaw)-Berlin with a train instead of flying from Helsinki to Berlin.

false,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"&gt; Since you agreed to join the EU &amp; NATO.

In no way has the EU or its predecessors - which we did not join but *found* alongside others - required, explicitly or implicitly, military involvment by any member state. That's precisely what NATO was for up to 1990 (around the the the time the EU was created). But let's first talk about the EU. That increasingly supranational entity you're talking about has neither a common foreign policy, any kind of political movement demanding a unified military even after Putin's Crimean debacle and no legal right to demand anything related to military whatsoever from its member states.

Regarding NATO, Germany [did provide](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verteidigungsetat#mediaviewer/File:Verteidigungsetat_Deutschlands_1950-2003.png) for its part in the alliance ([German wiki](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verteidigungsetat#Kalter_Krieg), stating that in 1960 defence spending amounted to roughly 24% of the FRG budget. It was about 15% in 1990 for a unified Germany, including the East German defence spending). It fell rapidly, and Germany has not fulfilled the required 2% for quite some time now.

However, over the past 20+ years, we've spend billions re-integrating a devastated East German economy and integrating East Europe (albeit not alone, cmpr. EU Structural &amp; Cohesion Funds) to effectively block out any attempts by Russia to re-expand into this area. The fact that Putin now attempts to at least grab Ukraine should tell us enough about the effectiveness of this approach.

All in all, Germany has indeed done too little to aid its NATO allies *over the past 20 years*. But to say that Germany has given up on geopolitical strategy is equivalent to ignoring the above points.

Edit: This also forgets the *very* helpful role Germany plays in enabling the US/NATO logistics network to function by its mere existence (e.g. Rammstein), plus a lot of diplomatic clout you're forgetting.

Yikes, the irony of accusing someone of being brainwashed and then spitting out this nonsense is rich.

Perhaps it's not the best place in the world, but I'm not sure that your advice was correct.

false,badlyjester,null,null,"Ich spiele hier mal ein bisschen devil's advocate:

Ich beobachte sehr viele Studenten, die lautstark fordern, dass Bildung für alle zugänglich und kostenlos sein soll. Die Schnittmenge zwischen diesen Leuten, und denen, die ich den ganzen Tag mit Bier in der Hand an der Lahn sitzen sehe, ist - soweit ich das einschätzen kann - relativ hoch.

Worauf ich eigentlich hinaus will: Ich habe den Eindruck, dass es viele Studenten gibt, die gerne und lange Student sind - was nicht zwangsweise heißt, dass sie gerne studieren. Nicht selten berufen sich diese Leute auf die Solidargemeinschaft, die den Preis des Studiums gefälligst zu bezahlen hat. In meinen Augen würde dazu aber auch gehören, dass sie selbst im Gegenzug versuchen die Kosten ihres Studiums nach Möglichkeit zu minimieren und nicht nach 7 Semestern im Bachelor noch Kurse aus dem ersten Jahr vor sich her schieben. Stattdessen wird allzu oft einfach vor sich hingedöst, und die Bildung die so vehement eingefordert wird, ist eigentlich nur eine Randnotiz im ""studentischen Lifestyle"".

Ich behaupte jetzt einfach mal, dass Semestergebühren in Höhe von 500€ sich insofern positiv auswirken würden, als dass die Leute wieder bewusster studieren würden, und damit auch selbst einen Mehrwert erfahren würden. 

Daran hängt natürlich ein riesiger Rattenschwanz, den andere Poster schon angesprochen haben. Es müsste trotzdem gewährleistet sein, dass Leute, die diese Gebühren finanziell tatsächlich nicht stemmen können, unterstützt werden. Außerdem müsste sichergestellt werden, dass das Geld sinnvoll ausgegeben wird, was an einigen Unis z.B. dadurch realisiert wurde, dass die Studenten selbst über einen Teil des Geldes verfügen konnten. Nicht zu vernachlässigen ist außerdem die Ursache dessen, warum viele Leute im Studium so vor sich her dümpeln: Wer mit 18 an die Uni kommt, kann häufig einfach nicht entscheiden, was er vom Leben will. Halte ich für völlig okay und normal - ich habe aber den Eindruck, dass viele Leute einfach in dieser Phase hängen bleiben, u.a. weil das System aufgrund der schlechten Betreuungssituation so anonym ist.

TL;DR: Bildung die nichts kostet verleitet junge Hirne dazu sie nicht ernst zu nehmen; mehr oder minder symbolische Semestergebühren könnten das ändern.",0,1412180741,null,0,false,0,ckxk3p2,t3_2hzldi,t1_ckxk3p2,t3_2hzldi,null,1426735536,-3,false,de,t5_22i0,-3

Don't forget:


- Carry-on limits in terms of size. Luggage limits in terms of weight.


- Getting to the airport (close in Tallinn but a long long way away in a lot of places). Depending on location and travel method, could take a while.


- Getting to the airport at least an hour before departure time. (time may vary based on location/airport size/etc.


- Random cavity search (if we ever sink to the US TSA levels).


- Sitting for hours in an uncomfortable chair with barely enough leg room (poor tall people).  While sitting in a pressurized tube full of crying babies and coughing adults who decided to take off their shoes.


- Traveling *from* the airport to your destination. Which again can take quite a while due to the airport being a long way away from the city center.


All in all it would take a lot more than the flight time.


Point being: actual air travel is faster, but the whole process takes a considerable amount of time/preparation/planning/discomfort.

In the US they can be so harsh sometimes. I know that most cops are pretty friendly but the possibilty of going to jail or having to pay or whatever is pretty damn high. You get stripsearched on festivals and they have sniffer dogs at the entrances. Cops are checking peoples pupils in festivals and kicking them out.

false,flusterer,EURO,European Union,"I don't know neither the guy nor the publishing house, but this is the review that has the most votes on Amazon:

&gt;Perhaps you wonder why ""quality media"" in certain subjects the same opinion is presented (at best in light shades)? ""The euro is good for Germany, Euro bailouts are necessary to stabilize the euro zone, we need a free trade agreement and Germany will it benefit most (Why does the press hardly content on TTIP and as well as not over CETA?) USA is good - Russia is evil, sanctions against Russia are necessary ... etc. ... also reporting on the espionage affair was more than one-sided. Why is usually only written that politicians are bugged - what about the monitoring of the entire population?

&gt;In the present volume 1 (of 3 planned volumes) it's about what secret networks control our information overload. The issue of how ""quality media"" create public opinion or influence it massively is for well-informed citizens certainly not new and has already publicly addressed several times for instance by the ZDF satire show ""[Die Anstalt (eng subs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2hm3v1/the_information_war_for_ukraine_satirical_german/)"" (on 29 April 2014) or in the ARTE documentary - ""[Benutzt und gesteuert (ger)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KxbQGQHjPo)"" (2006) or in the PhD thesis of Uwe Krüger „[Meinungsmacht. Der Einfluss von Eliten auf Leitmedien und Alpha-Journalisten](http://www.amazon.de/Meinungsmacht-Einfluss-Eliten-Leitmedien-Alpha-Journalisten/dp/3869620706) - eine kritische Netzwerkanalyse“ (""Power of opinion. The influence of elites in leading media and front line journalists - a critical network analysis"") or in Andreas Elter ""[Die Kriegsverkäufer: Geschichte der US-Propaganda 1917-2005](http://www.amazon.de/Die-Kriegsverk%C3%A4ufer-Geschichte-US-Propaganda-1917-2005/dp/3518124153)"" (The war Seller: History of U.S. propaganda 1917-2005), etc. ... but not yet, with all the depth and with so many personal accounts as does Dr. Udo Ulfkotte as ex-FAZ journalist in this book.

&gt; Especially when it comes to Russia reporting the leaning of the media was pretty obvious to many, as the corporate media has strongly integrated into the warmongering. From my perspective, this book shows up exactly at the right time - in which it is discussed in the EU on prohibitions of Russian and Russian-speaking Journalists (leaked by the Bundestag Wolfgang Gehrcke, DIE LINKE), so as not to let certain facts become public. On the leaked document says ""The EU must not give the impression that restricts freedom of expression."". Not give the impression but actually do it. It is therefore always attemted to constrain a real diversity of opinion and objective opinions. Media such as  the FAZ attribute their decline to the Internet, since potential customers prefer free information on the Internet. The responsibility for the decline in support of course has nothing to do with the domination and manipulation of the reader!! The manipulation of the media and the massive influence in opinion stinks terribly, that article can be taken as example.

&gt; Although many still want to believe in it, in Germany there is no media diversity and barely objective opinions in major daily newspapers / media. Much information does not appear in these media, the filtering of information is already done by AP, DPA, Reuters, Bloomberg, etc.

&gt; An individual  research can for time and monetary reasons, no longer be performed - but that is not necessarily the journalist's fault, that's just what the system has intended. In addition, just gets even the partiality of some influential journalists by ""guidelines""... no matter if the journalists are aware (certainly some - but not all do this intentionally aware). Also interesting is the manifestation of Willy Wimmer (Willy Wimmer was 33 years part of the German Bundestag from 1985 to 1992, he was defense policy spokesman of the CDU / CSU and then Parliamentary Secretary to the Federal Minister of Defence.) In a recent article in which he writes: ""I can very well remember a long conversation with one known to me for decades leading FAZ staff., he that made clear that whatever the State Department wants to go to the presses at night, then those news appear next morning in the newspaper."" .

&gt; The reader of this book will probably ask himself or herself after reading newspaper ""Who benefits this information?"" And that's a good thing. The media are controlled and we are quite aware manipulated - not only by the content and by many repetitions (The euro is good for Germany, ... etc.), but also in a unconscious way. Although many consider themselves inmune, hardly anyone is protected against subliminal manipulation. It starts with photos, unconsciously suggesting to us something with the word ""reinterpreted"" (financial crisis ... / instead of sovereign debt crisis and tax waste of money) and going to get that with color highlighting and bold print in an article is used to reach directly the subconscious, important information might be deliberately omitted, verbal content quoted from another context out a desired effect to reach the listener and vocally specific information in the context of news (barely perceptible) are highlighted when someone exerts unpopular measures (such as the purchase of bad debt by the ECB - to popularize this measure to a message issued ECB, the ECB recommends to reduce taxes in Germany, ...), glow products only in the heading and in a tiny spot at the other side agree, but otherwise represent the mainstream opinions), ... and much more! About these listed methods of manipulation could already write a thick book...

I don't have the solution, but I know that mastering French, even with the residual accent, will improve the depth and interest of you discussions. I would also suggest mingling with the anglophone community to get some rest and vant when needed :) Finally maybe try to find another activity where you can meet and build some longer term relationships with French people (a hobby? a sport?) - there you'll not be the teacher, and a random guy who doesn't speak French, but somebody who has the same passion as the group, that helps ease relationships.

This bears pointing out, because one of the reasons why this whole, monumentally stupid issue has popular weight is that the Commission tried to ban people from using imperial measurements, even just when used alongside, as a supplement for metric:

- CIA and MI6 overthrew Mossaddegh [because he wanted to nationalize Iran's oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat).

- CIA then propped [Reza Pahlavi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi), as he was easier to control.

- The Shah then started a campaign of torture and kidnappings.

- The Shah also granted US and British companies the largest oil and military contracts of that time.

- Among the kidnapped were many Shi'ite clerics.

- Those clerics then decided to start ruling the country, and thus the [Iranian Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution)
 happened, and the [Iran hostage crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis) also happened.

- Then they decided to nationalize the oil, and thus caused huge losses to many US companies, so the US responded by terminating relationships with them and by propping Saddam Hussein in Iraq, thus starting the[ First Gulf War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War), that only caused 120,000 - 600,000 dead Iranians.

What most-likely happened is that Dacians/Thracians (native people of the Balkans together with Ilyrians and Greeks) shepherds lived alongside Ilyrians for a period of time, hence some common words here and there. It's just the same as with slavs really. People lived together and exchanged words for things that they didn't have. Also Albanian is a partly romanized language and this adds even more to the similarity with Romanian.

However, what we now have remaining from this extinct language in modern Romanian is 2-3% of words maximum and a lot of them are archaisms, but the majority, by a large margin, are Latin derived ~85%.

From wikipedia (Romanian language)

&gt;The origins of the Romanian language, a Romance language, can be traced back to the Roman colonization of the region. The basic vocabulary is of Latin origin,[53] although there are some substratum words that are assumed to be of Dacian origin. Of all the Romance languages, in some respects, Romanian is the most conservative language, having retained, for example, the inflected structure of Latin grammar. Romanian's closest relative among the major Romance languages is Italian,[53] with which it shares a certain degree of asymmetric mutual intelligibility.
During the Middle Ages, Romanian was isolated from the other Romance languages, and borrowed words from the nearby Slavic languages (see Slavic influence on Romanian). Later on, it borrowed a number of words from Hungarian and Turkish.[54] During the modern era, most neologisms were borrowed from French and Italian, though the language has increasingly begun to adopt English borrowings.

.
From wikipedia (Dacian and Albanian relation)

&gt;The Dacian language was an Indo-European language spoken by the ancient Dacians, mostly north of the Danube river but also in Moesia and other regions south of the Danube. It may have been the first language to influence the Latin spoken in Dacia, but little is known about it. Dacian is usually considered to have been a Northern branch of the Thracian language, and like Thracian, Dacian was a satem language. About 300 words found only in Romanian or with a cognate in the Albanian language may be inherited from Dacian (for example: barză ""stork"", balaur ""dragon"", mal ""shore"", brânză ""cheese"").[citation needed] Some of these possibly Dacian words are related to pastoral life (for example, brânză ""cheese""). Some linguists and historians have asserted that Albanians are Dacians who were not Romanized and migrated southward.[65]
A different view is that these non-Latin words with Albanian cognates are not necessarily Dacian, but rather were brought into the territory that is modern Romania by Romance-speaking shepherds migrating north from Albania, Serbia, and northern Greece who became the Romanian people

&gt;Because those clothes can be manufactured much more cheaply there than in Europe, not only because of labor costs, but also because they have much bigger scales. That is a fact of life. We used to have textile and clothing manufacturing in Finland, those days are long gone. The firms that are left either specialised to segments that are small and need special knowhow, or moved their production of the country and concentrated their efforts here to marketing and design.

Not trying to diss Finland at all, but there are entire **cities** in Italy that revolve around textile manufacturing (Prato, for example) or metalworking. You just can't discontinue your industrial base when you reach a certain size. Again, I'm trying to avoid the *tiny homogenous nordic nation* stereotype, but it is true that certain solutions can only be applied on a certain scale. You can't completely subsitute a centennial industry that is deeply embedded within the social, economical, political and cultural structure of a nation without dire consequences that frankly don't even seem to pay off at all. Let's just put aside the causes because I think we both agree on what's the problem and how to solve it: make labour laws less convoluted, streamline bureacracy and so on. Great, let's do an *ad absurdum*. The necessary measures and reforms have been made. Now we just have to decide in what direction to push.

You say that we should subside a significant part of our industry to countries with less labour cost, which is something that is already happening to a degree in every western country, and keep the design process and the excellence of our engineers, designers and whatnot. I think it's not really thinking in the long term. Sure, Italy has a history of excellence when talking about design, clothing, engineering. China doesn't. Bangladesh doesn't. That's true, of course. But eventually the gap closes. In thirty, forty years, do you think there won't be a generation of respected engineers, designers and whatnot hailing from Beijing or Chengduan? I live in Florence, which houses one of the most prestigious design school in Europe (and consequently the world). The majority of the students are chinese, or from adjacent asian countries. Already China and India are building a reputation around the world concerning their engineers. Eventually design will also shift places, it's a slippery slope.

I'm not sure Pakistani would agree that the US army is a force of good, just to give an example.

It's hard to criticize attacking ISIS, but you could argue attacking Iraq enabled ISIS in the first place. Humanitarian efforts are a different story of course, but tanks are not exactly a tool tailored for those.

&gt;You don't get peace through smaller armies. You get peace by preparing for war.

There is definitely some thruth to this, but it's not that simple: 

All of europe was preparing for war prior to WWI; America is the country best prepared for war, yet they've been in war almost constantly after WWII. Of course there are way more facettes to this but the point I'm trying to make is that you could also say preparing for war makes you a tiny bit trigger happy.

In the end it comes down to the different mindsets of Germans and Americans concerning military. They are practically polar opposites. Germans tend to be too critical (as you can see in the picture with the coffin linked in this thread) while Americans tend to glorify their Army.

Centralizing money has allowed the rise of our welfare state so I do beg to differ on that.

A prime minister in Europe must take care of all of Europe and just because we have one does not mean we cannot have intermediate levels of government such as regions that handle certain affairs with the funds they are granted by the central European state.

It is not a straw man, but a misunderstanding of my point. Basically a modern humane country cannot go into a war of aggression and conquest, or at least may not _look_ so, it is beyond debate and question, just no. Or else it would look exactly like Putin's Russia.

Therefore the Iraq thing was made to look like a defensive and just war - maybe not directly Iraqi aggression was claimed, but WMDs yes, harboring and helping the terrorists who committed 911 yes and so on.

My point is not to make America look bad - it could be interpreted both ways, one may as well see my point as Germany and France being bad because not helping an ally.

My point is that alliance are about helping in just wars, defending against aggression being the most common, but not exclusive, kinds of just wars. While it is literally true that no direct attack by Iraq was claimed, something pretty similar was, it was claimed that it is a just, defensive, not aggressive, and not conquering war. And the allies like France and Germany did not help.

My point is neither to look America, nor France or Germany bad.

Rather my point is more like saying when a wife and husband feels so cold with each other, they better divorce.

When true or not an ally claims his war is defensive and just and totally not a conquest, and the other ally gives no help, it is not one side to blame, not the other side to blame, but better to end that marriage because they clearly no longer _care_, that is my point.",0,1412193464,null,0,false,0,ckxr2xi,t3_2hyvaz,t1_ckxr2xi,t1_ckxqiz1,null,1426732280,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
