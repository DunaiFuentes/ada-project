By announcing they were going to do one thing then doing the exact inverse.

First of all by calling maidan place ""nazis"" you are either buying russian propaganda, or a total morron to incredible levels, or a russian or collaborator. I don't know which one is worse. The guys in power are right wingers but basically they represent maidan as of now. And maidan voted them in in their own way. It's still a representation of democracy in it's own way, and there'll be soon more formal elections in the entire country if the russian don't try bombing it to stoneage before.

&gt; And btw. these ""new"" guys previously came to power through the Orange revolution, another violent affair. 

You mean after the last gov they replaced organized soviet style ""elections"" where people where to vote for them or see their family disappear in siberia/[get tortured to death then leaving the body in the wood](http://www.newser.com/story/183529/272-protesters-have-vanished-in-ukraine.html) ?

Then yanoukovitch and his oligarchs buddies basically got help from the russian to get back in power.

But he survived just fine. I love having him at home with us.

You don't have to give him up if you don't want to.

--We asked a vet and a pet-kennel if they knew people who could keep the cat while we were moving around, and not in a stable living situation. Found two wonderful people (at different times) who didn't charge too much. Also the vet suggested putting ads up at animal supply stores and let us put one up at the vet's office.

What's great about the internet is the people who took care of him could send us photos of him so we could see how he was doing. We got him back, once after three months away, once after four months.

--The regulations for cats aren't that complicated. You need to get a rabies shot and a few other things that the vet can easily take care of.

You're probably right that it might be less traumatic for him to be adopted by another family nearby rather than do all that, though. Good luck!

true,HomSig,NETH,Nederland,"Are sorry, but I can't find an English article. But I shall try to summarize it.

The PvdA ('labour party') made a plan to counter all the problems concerning eastern European immigrants. Employers who need an alot of hard working eployees that don't need to have a high education often hire easter Europeans because they're usually cheaper.

Partly because those eastern Europeans don't know their rights, and also have trouble communicating with Dutch institutions. They get less than the minimum wage, their work conditions violate regulations, and the job contract often includes a rent contract.

The PvdA wants to separate rent contracts and job contracts by outlawing the situation in which the employer is also the landlord (I'm actually surprised this is legal). Among other things, they wrote:

&gt; 'Er is niets mis met een Poolse buur, maar er is wel wat mis met vijftien Poolse buren in één eengezinswoning. Dat zorgt voor geluidsoverlast, vervuiling op straat en ruzies in het portiek. Voor de mensen die daarnaast wonen, is hun huis niet meer hun thuis, en juist hen moeten we helpen.'

""There's nothing wrong with one Polish neighbour, but there *is* something wrong with fifteen Polish neighbours in one family home. This results in noise pollution, pollution in the street, and quarrels in the front lawn. For the people who live next to that, their home isn't a home anymore, and we have to help them.""

They then argued for spreading eastern Europeans over the city, so there won't be such big concentrations anymore, and called for a limit of one person on 12 m². (Which is actually quite a high density, can you imagine a house of 96 m² with 8 men in their 20s?)

Especially this last quote, the limit of one eastern European for 12 m², is considered racist by Livable Amsterdam and various far right news sources (most notable geenstijl.nl). They present this not like if it's a limit to increase living space for them, but as if it's a maximum number of allowed immigrants. 

They criticize it in a couple of different ways. Some say it's hypocrite because when the PVV calls for fewer Morrocans it's racism, but when the PvdA calls for a limit it's good. Others say it's hypocrite because the PvdA doesn't want a limit for 'their own voting cattle' (probably refering to muslims).

In case you're wondering; if there was actually such a limit, the Netherlands would have a maximum of 3.460.500.000 Poles.",0,1394841326,null,0,false,0,cg2v3pq,t3_20ezvm,t1_cg2v3pq,t1_cg2puwi,null,1432804767,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Saying that you fundamentally misunderstand how thoroughly tied to culture language is and what's more the more comfortable position to be in now is to be bi lingual - fluent in English to engage with the world but have your own private language for your private national discussions.

You post with a British flag so I'm assuming you've noticed the deep divide of liberal lefties (that lean to Europe more) and the right wing x factor consumers that lean to America.

I'm deeply convinced the shared language divide has been incredibly detrimental to progress. Its deeply divided the UK in two very obvious groups - the right wing that look at america and aspire to their ""fuck you I got mine and limos and bitches"" culture and the left wing that are far more liberal.

If we had our own private language I honestly wonder whether the right wing would feel emboldened when most people tell them to shut the fuck up in national discussions.

""From a European perspective, a key step in developing diversity is the opening of a Southern Corridor, creating a link to the gas reserves of the Middle East and Caspian regions. In parallel, new infrastructures to deliver gas from Russia will play a key role in increasing the physical and technical diversity of supply from producing regions that are already linked to the European markets. For this reason the last decision on TEN-E Guidelines (Decision No 1364/2006/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006) has identified Nord Stream as a Project of European Interest, of the highest possible priority""

&gt;Since now the Russian Navy has both the motivation and justification to send warships into those EEZs to uphold ""ecological safety""?

Because before Nord Stream the Russian baltic fleet never entered the Swedish EEZ in order to sail from Kaliningrad to St. Petersburg?
EEZ != territorial waters btw.

&gt;Why is this more in Germany's interests than the plethora of other projects available that supply gas from the South?

Planning for Nord Stream started in 1997, how would scrapping a project that had been underway for well over ten years at that point have been in German interest? 
And AFAIK the Trans Adriatic Pipeline is still getting built.

* Leads to lagging behind in school, already starting in elementary. 

* Emphasis on unifying group behavior, regarding clothing brands and behaviors, way of speaking. 

The Moroccan immigrant group as a whole should be in it's own category of 'remarkably' , given the vast percentages active in crimes, fraud and unemployment. Discrimination is simply too lame of a ''white guilt'' cop-out excuse to whitewash all that. Fact is about all other large immigrant groups do far better, especially so after multiple generations. And the Moroccan group's youths are actually showings signs of radicalizing and following more extreme versions of Islam. There is an exception among some females, increasingly becoming better educated. But once again we can see the bias in the left-wing media making it out to be far bigger than it was reported to be. Wish-washing I call it. Another brim-reality: Long time Groenlinks leftist leader and feminist pulled her children from a ''zwarte school'' in favor of a more ''witte school'' in fear of her children lagging behind because of the immigrants. That's in a city where less than 50% are Dutch natives. 

Most poignantly we now observe chosen electives mainly in the labor party that appear more loyal to Morocco, and meet with imams and the king of Morocco. People are even creating posters in Moroccan, rather than Dutch and these people are increasingly voting for Moroccan politicians, even to the point where some parties are wondering what to do with this issue and a lot of under-qualified newcomers. I guess that's their freedom, but it shows the lack of integration and them voting along Moroccan lines of conservatism, Islamism. 

Then, regarding social sciences like the SCP: I do not consider them on same-footing with other annual reports from other ministries. Sociology is simply devoid of any empiricism like we can see in the economical activities reported by EPB from which you can deduce far more. Sociology is open to far more personal bias and influences. 

It's also easy to see conflicts of interest and ''brand-loyalty'' [in some of the persons running such bureaus](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Schnabel). Though I guess that's more conspiracy material. 

&gt; It is exactly the antagonistic viewpoint of people like you that drives a wedge between the autochton and the allochton population that hampers the integration of autochtons.

Yes, harsh words in response to increasing crime and wrongdoings by a failed immigrant group are clearly what's wrong here. Their refusal to integrate and other parties reluctance to tackle the issues or even naming the group responsible is what causes large gains in PVV seats.

I'm based in India and recently landed a job in Germany with a startup. For a German National visa for employment, you'll need to have/apply for a work permit. There are two ways to do this:

- Apply for the national visa without a pre-approved work permit - this is a longer process because it involved the Federal Labor Agency looking over your paperwork to grant you a work permit (after which the local consulate can grant you a visa - no work permit = no visa). Can take a few weeks.

- Have your company apply for the work permit in advance, them apply for your visa with that - much quicker, generally just 3-5 days.

My paperwork is taking a while, but my company's position is that they can't get me started on work until my visa is granted (even though I've asked to start early).

If things work the same way in the US as they do here with regards to Germany, then I'd say your best bet is to have the company apply for the work permit for you first - much easier and quicker.

I never attached any, some do, some don't, that won't change anything.

&gt; also, should i colorise my CV to make it more 'interesting' rather than just list it out, in black and white plainly?

If you're applying on an artistic job or computer graphics stuff, yeah, if not, just don't, or be sure that it doesn't make your resume too ""bariolé"".

&gt; what would you do to improve your chances of getting a low level paid job?

I would wait for the second half of April or even May, it's too early for companies to deal with summer jobs, most people working there still haven't decided of their vacations and the HR office doesn't even think about how to manage the situation for the moment. They'll surely have kept your resume if they're interested and they'll call you in time if you're needed.

ICANN is largely in charge of domains, It has little to with free speech. I suppose they could revoke domains and the US does quite a bit, usually for counterfeit and copyright claims. 

I remember the US putting tremendous pressure on any company related to Wikileaks like Amazon in order to hamper them.

Quindi la tua linea di pensiero è: ""se non la pensi come me sei fascista anche se non lo sai"".

One of the many problems with communism is it lacks an effective market-feedback mechanism. Meaning, boom and bust cycles. Bust cycles aren't always bad. When businesses go bankrupt, entrepreneurs can pick up capital equipment on the cheap to fund new businesses to start the boom cycle.

How do you ever have a vibrant startup economy, including lots of failures, in a communist economy? Where does the funding come from for venture capitalism, is that all provided by the state? Then these little startups, how do you know in a communist economy what's a success and what's a failure? In a capitalist market, you run out of money, you are done.

Consiglio d'Europa: esterno all'UE, scarso potere decisionale, ci partecipano anche stati non membri dell'Unione. **Attenzione: in realtà il Consiglio ha un ruolo abbastanza interessante nel spianare la strada nel campo dei diritti umani collegato alla politica di vicinato, sebben non ufficialmente. Esso infatti inquadra e ""nomalizza"" stati che potevano essere ben considerati troppo ""dittature-non euopei-poverererrimi"". Se questi Stati lo vogliono, il Consiglio d'Europa è una buona piattaforma per il progresso nei diritti umani.**


Consiglio Europeo: composto da 28 primi ministri dei paesi membri + presidente + presidente commissione + Alto rappresentante affari esteri + (eventualmente) un ministro per stato e un membro commissione, presieduto da presidente nominato da commissione. Ruolo di ""ispiratore"" dell'azione legislativa dell'UE. **Importante: questo è l'organo che negozia i Trattati e dà la prima agenda legislativa, all'interno della quale si muoverà la Commissione e il Parlamento**


Consiglio: composizione diversa a seconda di cosa si discute, vi prendono parte i ministri incaricati in una data materia degli stati membri. Presidenza cambia a rotazione ogni sei mesi fra gli stati membri. Parallelo al parlamento, una volta era molto più potente. **Ehm ehm. Qui mi permetto di non essere molto d'accordo. Prima di tutto, il Consiglio è ""co-legislatore"" col Parlamento, mai dimenticarlo. E' poi vero che il Parlamento ha ora pari poteri,ma solo sulle materie nelle quali vige la procedura legislativa odinaria (ex-codecisione).

I highly recommend that you do a bit of research about the local shops in the area where you plan to stay and then go shopping on your first day.

The sizes and fitting for Lederhosen isnt so easy, there's a great variety of styles and leather. Especially if you plan on spending more than the cheapest option (most chain stores offer a complete set with shirt, shoes, socks and Lederhosen for 199,-€). But even *if* you buy one of those sets you shouldnt order it online. 

2 reasons: 

you'll look like just another tourist / idiot if the Lederhosen is too small or too big. I'm sure you dont wanna be laughing stock to 1000+ drunk (= even more rude) bavarian guys...

besides, it's a perfectly great experience to walk into a local store and get helped by cute girls in dirndls. I met one guy from the US who looked great in his Lederhosen and he told me how much fun he had trying on all the styles and flirting with the sales girls ;)

this, because there is no common demos that can give rise to a common kratos, with the expectation of legitimacy that would permit decisive and controversial decision making in a time of crisis.

different social and cultural histories give rise to different aims and expectations of governance, and the absence of both representation and accountability would undermine  action.

the decision to spend blood and treasure in elective warfare is the most divisive of issues, and an EU army would be paralysed by lowest-common-denominator foriegn policy.

Rattle the paperclip around while turning it lightly. The lock will eventually just open. If not, try applying more or less pressure, more rattling, pulling the clip in and out of the lock while rattling around and so on. The idea is that the paperclip pushes on the little pins inside the lock until they more or less randomly all ""catch"", at which point the lock is open.

That doesn't constitute ""murdering Belarussians"". The same things are happening right now in Lithuania to Poles.  

&gt;It was all about ""regaining stolen territory""

I was obviously referring to Zaolzie. Apparently in your warped reality Poland was independent after World War II. 

&gt;My grandparents are Polish, Lithuanian, Ukrainian and Austrian

Every 1/4 of you hates the rest. Sad.  

&gt;Any criticism of Poland is met with hostility

It's not criticism, you're just parroting old enemy propaganda, designed to rile the masses. 

&gt;Poland is also guilty of atrocities. 

Poland is guilty of NOT committing ""atrocities"". It's not possible to be an empire without it, every strong nation in the world has ""atrocities"" in its history. When Russians realized that Ukrainians could not be tamed they just exterminated them through starvation. Ukrainians realized that exterminating all Poles is the most effective way for control over Western Ukraine and they were right. The British starved millions of Irish and killed millions of natives all around the world...  no need to list everything here.  

These are not atrocities because a state is an amoral entity, the only thing that matters is effectiveness. The problem with Poland is that it never behaved and thought that way. The only war started by Poland was started by a group of nobles acting completely on their own, the king got offended, nothing came out of it. While others were busy expelling/killing Jews, generally killing heretics and instituting absolute monarchies, Poland was busy taking them all in and democratizing. That's the real shame.  

A Pole believing in Polish ""atrocities"" is really a method of self-appreciation. Because that implies former power. Unfortunately that's not the truth.

Poles even had easier lithuanian language exams. Most lithuanians are outraged about poles in Lithuania, because a lot of them in 20 years of independence haven't yet learned to speak basic lithuanian. They also ask for unreasonable things like to write their names in passports in polish language. Lithuania said no because those are lithuanian passports and for a lithuanian to correctly read what is written there would be the same as reading arabic letters or [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5vEc6PSVwo). Lithuanians keep telling poles no, you can't write that in the front page, but if you really want to, you can write in the second page of passport whatever you like. Lithuania also follows a simple lithuanian constitutional law that says this: The language of the state - lithuanian language. A lot of historians even argue if polish people in Lithuania are really polish or are they polonized lithuanians or ruthenians as people there speak a special kind of dialect of polish called poprostu. I see no need for street signs to be polish.

Poland isn't that great with lithuanians either. In Poland, polish government closes lithuanian schools, not so long ago closed possibly the only newspaper which wrote news in lithuanian there. So you can talk all about how poles are oppressed in Lithuania, but they are not. It's not even their ethnic land here, and Poland has lithuanian ethnic lands.

Finally, if they learn the basics of the language, the hymn, the basic history of Latvia, and swear allegiance to the country, they get a passport. That's easy enough. But not for free, no.

&gt;Denn Normen sind universelle Regeln

Ja, also mein Thesaurus sagt, „Regel“ ist synonym mit „Vorschrift“. Ich könnte damit leben, „Je mehr du wie Heidi Klum* aussiehst, umso mehr Präferenzen triffst du in dieser Gesellschaft“ sowohl als Regel, als auch als Vorschrift zu bezeichnen. Auf meine oder deine Präferenz alleine trifft diese Regel nicht zu, das stimmt, der Normkörper trifft nicht jederermanns Präferenz, nur halt die der meisten Deutschen.

&gt; DIN-A4

Nicht jede Norm wird „definiert“. Es gibt (oder gab bis vor kurzem) z.B. eine Norm, daß bei Frauenhemden die Knöpfe links, bei Männerhemden rechts sind. Es gibt dafür keine DIN- oder ISO- oder sonstirgendeine festgelegte Norm, das wurde einfach so gemacht und hat sich durchgesetzt, und man mußte damit rechnen, daß der Kunde sich darauf verläßt. Oder auch das Microsoft DOC-Format, was in der Industrie zum Dokumentenaustausch benutzt wird. Das DIN hat hat nicht festgelegt daß DOC benutzt werden soll, aber die Meisten machen es und verlassen sich darauf, daß die Anderen auf ihren Industrierechnern MS Office haben und sind genervt, wenn plötzlich jemand ne TEX-Datei schickt. Wir hatten auch mal soziale Normen im Gespräch, da ist auch niemand gewesen, der gesagt hat: „Ich erkläre jetzt diesesunddieses Verhalten zur sozialen Norm“, sondern die ist so entstanden und ist trotzdem eine Norm.

Sinon, puisqu'il faut systématiquement le préciser, je déplore les agressions sexuelles et les viols. Violer, c'est mal.

Clarification faite, il n'y a pas de culture du viol : la dénonciation et la criminalisation du viol sont croissantes. 

C'est un mot fourre tout qui fait partie du classique jargon féministe. Ça permet de différentier ceux qui sont ""avec"" les féministes de ceux qui sont contre et de ne laisser aucune alternative. 

Ça soude les féministes entre eux, tout comme l'emploi d'expressions récurrentes, comme ""cis"" , et des glissements sémantiques ""male privilege"".

Tout ce vocabulaire a un très fort effet social. Le but n'est pas tellement d'avoir un concept derrière ou de convaincre des gens, mais surtout de scander ces mots pour s'identifier et exclure ceux qui sortent du rang.

D'ailleurs, en sociologie, la culture est définie comme ""ce qui est commun à un groupe d'individus"" et comme ""ce qui le soude"".

En philosophie, le mot culture désigne ce qui est de l'ordre de l'acquis et non de l'inné.

Je ne vois donc toujours pas en quoi on peut parler d'une culture du viol ou de la violence en France.

Ce qui est massif c'est la critique du viol. La société est extrêmement sévère envers les violeurs.



En fait, il y a plus de gens qui parlent de culture du viol que de gens qui minimisent le viol. C'est un phénomène marginal qui devrait être qualifié de ""déni de viol"" ou de ""minimisation de viol"".

On surinterprète tout avec un but idéologique, on érige l'exception de l'exception en règle. Tout ça n'a rien à voir avec la justice et tout à voir avec de la manipulation.

Pour moi, il y a un but derrière tout cette surinterprétation orientée, on en a déjà parlé. C'est de dire que tous les hommes sont des violeurs et que toutes les femmes sont des victimes.

&gt;Jesus said, ""Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters"" (Matthew 12:30)

&gt;Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, in a speech discussing the Chief Committee for Political Education, told the assembled delegates that ""It is with absolute frankness that we speak of this struggle of the proletariat; each man must choose between joining our side or the other side. Any attempt to avoid taking sides in this issue must end in fiasco.""

&gt;George Orwell wrote in his 1942 essay ""Pacifism and the War"", ""If you hamper the war effort of one side you automatically help that of the other. Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one. In practice, ‘he that is not with me is against me’. The idea that you can somehow remain aloof from and superior to the struggle, while living on food which British sailors have to risk their lives to bring you, is a bourgeois illusion bred of money and security.""

I've never heard about that Sikorski remark, but TBH it's true - you make that one matter such a big problem, when you need Poland far more than Poland needs you, and it doesn't cost you a thing. It's just irrational.

Regarding minority laws in Poland - minorities in Poland can put multilingual signs with city names etc where there are enough of them, have their own schools if there are enough of them in some area, can choose minority languages in the final exams if they want to, have smaller minimal support level than the Polish parties (5% bias) to get into parliament, etc, etc. You can also put private signs with whatever you want in whatever language you want on your property, it's not even regulated. If you want to put a sign in Welsh on your house it's your matter. I don't understand why that would be a problem in any reasonable country.

And for most Poles that's all that we know about Lithuania - they get our planes defending them, and they don't like us and forbid people to put signs in Polish. I understand it's misrepresentation, but I also think both Lithuanians and Poles would gain much more by dealing with that problem than making it the only point of our debate.

I did get it, but from this conversation I'm guessing you either live by the coast or in the southern parts of the land (eg. south of Stockholm). 

&gt;Good example is snowy stairs to an entrance, when the snow isn't removed, to a school for example. People walk on the snow, pack it, and eventually it becomes really packed -and yes, slippery. I have fallen down stairs like that, because of slippery snow that has been tightly packed. 

Of course, but in situations such as in stairs or where people walk repeatedly the snow tends to turn into slush (over zero) even if the air itself isn't over zero. But you need a lot of people to cause this and it doesn't really affect pedestrian pathways where people don't choose the same narrow path and walk it repeatedly (as would happen in stairs or near doors). 

Anyway, this snow is more like ice.

&gt;. The same principle applies when cars drive on the snow and pack it - so it becomes slippery.

Yes, the pressure causes the snow to melt. The road may also be warmer than the air (as you've probably seen on the temperature meters by the road -- AIR -5, ROAD +2). Again, this isn't really a problem with pedestrian pathways - there isn't THAT much people, and the traffic isn't that heavy. 

But everything you say is true around Helsinki/Helsingfors (and Turku/Åbo).

&gt; And yes- I have been to Finland. 

Would this have been on the coast around the southern part of the land?

&gt;And while one can ride a bike the year around, with winter tiresit is a lot harder and slippier and colder and more dangerous. 

As I said, I haven't had any problems.

Ora che, per fortuna, il fascismo non è più al potere, il problema non si pone più: posso permettermi di essere neutrale senza diventare automaticamente complice di atrocità.

Il fascismo lo considero una cosa passata, nonostante qualche nostalgico, e mi concedo il lusso di poter guardare, da un punto di vista di uno storico, nel modo più oggettivo e neutrale che mi è possibile.

1) As the article itself mentions, one of the key reasons is Putin's successful handling of the Olympics. Right before the Games, sites like CNN were awash with articles about how a terror attack will almost certainly take place in Sochi (""it's not a question of if, but when""), how all buildings and facilities are in terrible shape and present a danger to the athletes, how gays will be beaten on the streets, and how the whole thing will be a disaster. However, everything actually went very smoothly, and the blunders were within reason (technical glitch at the opening? Here's looking at you, Vancouver). Putin's pet project was a success. While people are upset over how he is handling things at the moment, his success from the very recent past still lingers and boosts his popularity.

2) People generally tend to back their leader, despite everything, in times of war. Remember how George Bush's ratings skyrocketed during the twin invasions of the mid-00's, despite beginning his first term as a rather unpopular President? Yet despite his sky high approval ratings, I still generally remember most people complaining about rather than praising him at the time (I was in the US during those years; I travel between the two countries a good deal). Same discrepancy, different President.

3) Let's face it: while ""taking Crimea to protect Russians"" is a bullshit excuse, Russia does have some valid points about Western meddling, Western hypocrisy in terms of invading sovereign nations, and the Bandera extremist movement that, while not as strong as Russian media suggests, is a very real and dangerous right-wing fringe group in Ukraine. While these reasons still do not warrant troop involvement, put a more positive twist on them in the media and people begin to emphasize.

&gt; Le viol n'est pas commun à la société française, il ne soude pas la société française

Ne faites pas semblant de ne pas comprendre ce qui est entendu par culture du viol s'il vous plaît.

14ème définition de la culture du viol...

Je vais laisser parler [Me Vergès](http://youtu.be/AIQ33mHGmmM?t=3m) sur la façon dont on parle d'une victime de meurtre conjugal. Est-ce un exemple de culture du meurtre ? (si c'était un homme, y-aurait-il eu acquittement ?)

Pour le viol, c'est la même chose.

J'en reste à [cette vision](http://badgerherald.com/oped/2013/11/04/rape-culture-does-not-exist/#.UyRRtBBdV8E).

&gt;On apprend aux filles qu'elles ne doivent pas sortir seule la nuit, qu'elles doivent faire attention, qu'elles ne doivent pas boire trop pour ne pas risquer de se faire agressée. Sans oublier les victimes qui doivent décrire leur tenue lors de l'agression comme si elles devaient se justifier.

C'est la même chose pour les garçons. Ceux à qui on ne l'apprend pas l'apprennent à leur dépens. Quand tu es bourré et que tu te fais défoncer la gueule, comme ça m'est arrivé plusieurs fois, c'est de ta faute. Quand les agresseurs sont de pauvres petites racailles, on les relâche.

They don't have street names in polish there either. This is why we don't give poles special laws. Even if we would, it would be a huge blow to our stability.

true,New-Atlantis,EURO,European Union,"Here is a better translation of what Gorbachev actually said:

&gt;In a letter published on his website on Friday the former Soviet President and Nobel Peace Prize winner said that his position on the Ukrainian crisis remains unchanged. “Our main task is to stop the dangerous escalation and find a solution that would be supported by Ukrainian and Russian citizens and prevent a new Cold War,” the message reads.

&gt;At the same time, Gorbachev wrote that he would prefer not to get personally involved in the talks and the diplomatic contacts President Vladimir Putin is having with other national leaders almost daily.

&gt;The former Soviet leader holds that the original cause of the current dire situation in Ukraine and Crimea lies in the “deliberate wrecking of Perestroika and in the thoughtless and adventurist dissolving of the Soviet Union.” “I was fighting to keep the union state by all political means I had at my disposal. I would like to emphasize – these were political means. Both before and after the pact was made by the heads of the Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine in the Belavezha Forest I was warning about the dangerous and destructive consequences,” Gorbachev said in the message. “Unfortunately they did not listen to my warnings. The Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation approved the destruction of the Soviet Union with applause and not a single word was spoken about Crimea and Sevastopol,” he added.

&gt;Gorbachev refers to the events of late 1991 when the three heads of the Soviet Union’s internal republics –Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation, Stanislav Shushkevich of Belarus and Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine signed a pact on the succession of the Soviet Union in the Belavezha Forest government residence in Belarus. The agreement allowed the ex-soviet republics to become independent states within the Soviet administrative borders and according to it the Crimean Peninsula, populated mostly with ethnic Russians and Russian speakers, remained with Ukraine, even though it was officially made Ukrainian territory in 1954 as a goodwill gesture from the Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev.

&gt;Belavezha Accords also put an end to Mikhail Gorbachev’s office as the Soviet President as the country he was heading ceased to exist.

&gt;In his Friday letter Gorbachev also said that in modern times the responsibility of the media was especially great. “You must not stir up passions and kindle the atmosphere. Let us remember that we are dealing with two peoples that are connected with ages-long ties. We cannot allow a tragic schism and must help the people to achieve accord,” the ex-Soviet leader wrote.

&gt; Cependant votre propre argumentaire est parfaitement inutile à ces fins, puisqu'il est creux.

Jugement de valeur dont je n'ai que faire.

&gt;Ne faites pas semblant de ne pas comprendre ce qui est entendu par culture du viol s'il vous plaît

... Désolé d'employer les mots appropriés quand celui de culture ne convient pas.

Et j'en ai déjà parle [ici](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1ltzsp/conseils_pour_une_bonne_baise_hard_lincitation_au/cc2z39t?context=3). Ce terme est flou et le plus souvent faux.

&gt;Il s'agit d'une banalisation des violences sexuelles et d'un renversement de la culpabilité sur les victimes.

Et j'ai donc montré que ce n'est pas le cas puisque la société est extrêmement sévère envers les violeurs. Cet article d'ailleurs en est un exemple puisqu'il dénonce ces comportements et rappelle que le viol est considéré comme insupportable. Tocqueville avait montré que c'était déjà le cas dans les États-Unis du 19ème siècle alors aujourd'hui.

&gt;seulement de considérer qu'une part de notre culture encourage à reporter la faute sur les victime, non sur le violeur.

**Une part**. Comme pour tous les crimes, y compris les meurtres.

&gt;Vous sembliez vouloir caractériser la culture du viol et en faire une critique directement sur la nature d'une telle culture, pourquoi est-ce qu'il est impossible qu'elle existe en tant que tel.

Je donne une définition de culture. Je m'aperçois qu'elle ne s'applique pas au viol car c'est tout simplement considéré comme un crime !

&gt; peux donc voir maintenant que vous n'êtiez pas du tout porté vers une discussion constructive, au temps pour moi.

J'en ai déjà parlé des dizaines de fois. Il n'y a pas de discussion constructive quand on utilise des mots qui ne conviennent pas.

&gt;C'est là tout l'objet de ma critique en point 1. . Ne généralisons pas à toutes les formes de violence, puisqu'il s'agit alors d'une toute autre thèse et que vous déformez dès lors les propos que vous critiquez.

Dans ce cas là, il faut aussi restreindre l'analyse aux seuls viols, c'est à dire, ""les actes de pénétration sexuelle, commis sur la personne d'autrui par violence, contrainte, menace ou surprise est un viol"".

Par ailleurs, en l'absence d'intention, il n'y a pas de crime. Aucune exception.

On the other hand i think putin understand *perfectly* how things goes. It simply serves him multiple purposes :

- Looking strong abroad (he stomped in Crimea)
- Looking strong at home (""look how i sent the evil US running !"")
- He has a ""public ennemy"" he can point and blame
- He paints us european as weak/idiots misled by ""nazis"" (Dear Mr President, i mean, *seriously* , *we aren't the one invading part of another country ""to protect it's ethnic citizens"" with tanks with a page straight from WWII textbooks.*)
- His population forgets momentarily their issues, long enough to finish his current mandate and let the whole thing explode in the face of the next leader
- He feeds ressources and money to his oligarch at ""little cost"" to himself (he doesn't really care about ukraine)
- He can inflate his own ego and portray himself as a soviet emperor coming back to liberate his own citizen from the eviiil-us-led-empire-and-their-EU-lackeys. Guess what, the Ukrainians ain't that dumb and buying it anymore after yanoukovich stole everything shiny and killed anyone standing up to him.

He can either do that or go the hard way and start with painfull short term reforms which would bite him in the arse currently to reform the country for long term. And since he's aging and know it, he made the ""easy"" choice and relapsed in the bad soviet habits and starts a war against us instead of trying to fix his country.

I guess the EU gambit to push him to reform blew in our faces in a way. He's strong enough to rebuild his country with EU oil money but he used it to reinforce his army and buy oligarchs with insane checks instead of rebuilding more his country, fix corruption, toss in jail the biggest abusers or at the very least *stops them from stealing that much* *even if they are his ~~suckers~~ ~~royal bootlickers court~~ ""friends"" for money*, fight corruption and invest in proper non-fuel-based infrastructure for the future of his country (hospitals, schools, high tech infra, R&amp;D, ...), and now it's going to go down again (when the pipe cut or he runs out of fuel) if he doesn't react, and he'll just damage us along and they'll blame us for everything going wrong there USSR style. :(

It feels a bit like giving cash to your ex drug addict neighbor so he can get backs on his feets, and when he runs out due to giving too much to ""old pals"" he use what he still has to buy a gun to racket a neighbor and ""recover street cred"".

The requirement to attend a Studienkolleg is regulated in the university law of the resp. federal state. 

Mannheim is Baden-Württemberg and Rhein-Waal is in NRW, so they have different laws.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"This article comes from a standpoint that views prisons in a fundamentally damaging and absolutely idiotic manner. As a centre of punishment and not of rehabilitation.

The conditions in a prison *should* be good. The best way to make someone your worst enemy is by kicking them while they're down. They've had a terrible life which has lead to them breaking the law, and then they get this horrible news that they're being sent to prison. 

Now, when they get there do we doubly reinforce that feeling of depression and unhappiness, or do we make them a bit more comfortable, try to get them better and gear them towards rehabilitation so that when they get out, they'll have a better perspective and never do something like that again?

If people leave prison feeling that they're improved themselves and that things aren't all bad, they wont fuck up and put themselves back in there. If people leave prison feeling that society has betrayed them in their time of need and that they have absolutely nothing waiting for them, they wont give a fuck.

Et le titre en rajoute une couche ""culture du viol en France"". Alors de un, moi lire ça je prends ça comme une attaque. Je n'ai jamais violé, ni pensé à violer une femme, et suis encore moins d'accord avec n'importe quels attouchements ou encore au fait d'interdire les jupes aux femmes. Donc non, la France n'a pas de ""culture du viol"", faut arrêter avec ce genre de phrases choc bidon qui vont plus énerver des mecs comme moi qu'autre chose. De la même façon que lire et dire que la France est un pays raciste m'énerve plus qu'autre chose (par rapport à l'histoire avec Taubira dernièrement). 

Ce genre d'histoire c'est un rapport entre deux individus, pas entre les deux sexes en général. Des barjots, fous furieux ou quoi que ce soit existent, mais c'est pas pour autant qu'il faut faire un amalgame avec un quelconque sexe en général. D'ailleurs, si vous aviez lu le témoignage dans sa globalité vous auriez vu que des personnes (de sexe masculin) sont intervenues pour virer l'agresseur de la rame. 

Et pour en rajouter une couche, le phrase "" Dans aucun univers la victime n’est responsable de son agression. Le coupable est toujours l’agresseur. "" est débile. Le monde n'est pas blanc ou noir, sans parler de ce cas particulier, les responsabilités sont toujours partagées, pas forcément équitablement, mais personne n'est blanc comme neige. Faut arrêter avec cette démagogie de comptoir.

De plus, les particules sont là mesurées en poids par volume. Le problème c'est que les particules les plus grosses sont moins dangereuses (et plus lourde).

Poland isn't Russia - we won't invade Vilnius to protect our minorities. And even if that was a real possibility - harsh legislation make it more probable, not less.

What stability hit are you speaking about? Are you're afraid Poles will take over Vilnius if you allow them to put signs in Polish?

And when you speak about political consequences - some Silesians in Poland want autonomy, yet nobody is forbidding bilingual signs where there are minorities big enough. It's not about what the country want, it's about what the people want. And Germany (a bigger country) is right beside Silesia. Arguments that national phobias should dictate policy towards minorities are just dumb.

I also highly doubt most Poles in Lithuania came there in 20th century. We had Commonwealth for 300 years and then 123 years we were occupied by the same country. I've heard about many Polish Lithuanians (like Piłsudski or Mickiewicz) that were there before 20th century. Can you give me some sources showing the opposite? Wikipedia says Polish minority in Lithuania is several centuries old.

And you misunderstood me - I don't advocate to stop that debate, I just think we shouldn't be ONLY speaking about that. For example - what is Lithuanians stance on Russia recently? How does the whole business with Możejki rafinery going? Do you consider linking your gas or electric systems with Polish?

&gt; Jugement de valeur dont je n'ai que faire.

C'est dommage. Le fait qu'il soit creux n'est pas seulement une opinion, c'est une observation logique. Je considère encore ma critique valide puisque vous éludez toujours sa réfutation.

&gt; Et j'en ai déjà parle ici. Ce terme est flou et le plus souvent faux.

C'est assez facile de refuser toute définition pour ensuite dire que c'est ""le plus souvent"" faux (alors quand est-il vrai?). Je vous ai proposé une définition, de dire que d'autres personnes entendent autre chose par culture du viol, n'implique en rien que ce dont je parle existe, ou n'existe pas. C'est simplement un autre débat.

&gt; Et j'ai donc montré que ce n'est pas le cas puisque la société est extrêmement sévère envers les violeurs. Cet article d'ailleurs en est un exemple puisqu'il dénonce ces comportements et rappelle que le viol est considéré comme insupportable. Tocqueville avait montré que c'était déjà le cas dans les États-Unis du 19ème siècle alors aujourd'hui.

La société n'est pas un monolithe où toutes les couches agissent et pensent de concert, et dont on peut juger des valeurs à l'aune des accomplissement les plus sophistiqués. Des personnes pensent que cette fille méritait ce qui lui est arrivé. Combien ? Impossible de savoir, et surtout impossible de se baser sur des commentaires sur internet pour conclure quoique ce soit à ce sujet. De toute façon, ce n'est même pas le point que je soulevais ici (comme je l'ai dis dans un autre commentaire, je ne considère pas que la culture du viol soit montrée par cet article). Ce que je soulevais c'est votre argumentation vis à vis de l'impossibilité de l'existence d'une culture du viol. Alors que vous n'en acceptez aucune définition pour les raisons que vous citez, vous comprendrez mon scepticisme.

&gt; Je donne une définition de culture. Je m'aperçois qu'elle ne s'applique pas au viol car c'est tout simplement considéré comme un crime !

Le viol est un terme légal, effectivement. C'est aussi un acte en dehors de ce cadre légal, avec des répercussions qui n'appartiennent pas à ce cadre, personnelles et culturelles. Le fait que différentes personnes aient différentes réactions est déjà un élément de culture, en soit ! Ces réactions ne peuvent être réduites à la loi qui condamne l'acte, parce que l'acte peut être plus large que la loi, et parce que ces réactions ne sont certainement pas calquées sur la loi. La morale et la loi ne sont pas équivalentes, dans un sens comme dans l'autre : notre morale, liée à notre culture, fait évoluer nos lois, et la loi, produit d'une morale du passé, en devient une expression qui impacte notre culture. Cette dynamique est encore un tout autre débat, mais ne peut être niée aussi facilement que vous le faite. Certainement pas simplement en citant une définition qui ne supporte absolument pas votre thèse. Votre définition, concernant ce que serait une culture, certe, n'aborde pas du tout la dynamique citée plus haut.

true,pakap,Franche,Franche-Comté,"&gt;Le viol n'est pas commun à la société française

Ce qu'on critique quand on parle de ""culture du viol"", c'est en partie une attitude très répandue qui consiste à minimiser les agressions sexuelles, que ça soit en blâmant la victime (à cause de ses vêtements, de son attitude, de son taux d'alcoolémie) ou en dédouanant partiellement son agresseur (frustration/misère sexuelle, différences culturelles, etc). L'autre partie étant ce même état d'esprit qui considère les femmes comme des objets et fait que certaines personnes se sentent autoriser à les agresser sexuellement, souvent en se dédouanant avec les mêmes raisons.

Le fait que ces deux aspects d'une ""culture du viol"" soient présent en France n'est pas réellement élucidable sans une sérieuse étude statistique, mais dans mon expérience, ils le sont plus qu'à la marge.

Ora: mettere tutte le cose fatte sullo stesso piano (uccidere, bonificare, leggi ad personam) e solo *dopo* contare quelle buone, è una scelta morale e politica, che necessita di essere contrastata, a mio parere.

È una scelta politica e morale dire ""almeno ha fatto qualcosa di buono a differenza di Berlusconi."": ha un sottointeso pericoloso, cioè che non c'è un piano morale che mette un politico eletto in un contesto democratico in un piano diverso a un dittatore sanguinario.

This thing these people are organising has no legal value, it is nothing official at all. Even among the racist party Lega Nord, that wants the north of Italy to secede, the Veneto independentists are not taken seriously.

Historically, yes it has been its own political unity for a time, but that's true for every region in Italy. After WWII it was one of the poorest regions, but it did rebound well, like the rest of northern Italy, which is much more industrialised than the south.

The image of Veneto in the rest of Italy is a bunch of racist close-minded pricks, and even if it's a stereotype, it definitely exists more here than in anywhere else in Italy. The Venetian independentists, who are definitely not a majority, are more about making up a political unity to legitimate their racist theories than actually building a future for anyone.

true,SoloAlone,LITH,Lithuania,"I hope Poland wouldn't want to invade Lithuania. And I don't think it would unless some drastic change in government would start in both our countries. I'm not afraid for Vilnius. Vilnius these days doesn't have very many Poles living there. The area around Vilnius does though. 

By stability I mean, let's say a part of Lithuania get autonomy(part where there are a lot of Poles). A autonomous region is like a country in a country belonging to that country. So Lithuania would have a neighbor Poland with a ""little Poland"" inside of it self. Stability of the country would be lower, because that ""little Poland"" would of course want to be part of Poland.

Once again, I must say that Lithuania doesn't have land, that didn't originally belong to Lithuanians. Poland has rather a lot of it, especially after WW2. I could say Poland has a moral obligation to let those places have street signs in polish. Yet I still think they(Poles) can do what they want. I mean if you're government thinks it's ok and your people do, great do it. But don't try to force it on other people and countries. There is no need to put any street sings in another language in Lithuania, as any foreigner in that land is obviously a immigrant or related to one. We let Poles learn their language in schools and let them have their newspapers, radios etc... We only ask for one thing, respect the country your in and for the love of God, learn it's language in 20 years of independence. I sometimes hear Poles on the radio(when they call to express their opinion) and they ask their fellow poles, especially ones in the government, to stop bringing shame upon their people by requesting nonsense laws.

People didn't move that much in the commonwealth(that would explain why are there so little of Lithuanians in territory's of Poland not close to Lithuania). So not many of poles here are from those times.
&gt; I've heard about many Polish Lithuanians (like Piłsudski or Mickiewicz) that were there before 20th century. Can you give me some sources showing the opposite?&gt; 

You want me to give a article saying there were no Poles in Lithuania before 20th century? That would be like proving there were no Poles in China before the 15th century. Impossible. Most Poles are from 19th/20th century, but not all.

If we would want to continue the debate at a country to country level, we would be breaking the Lithuanian - Polish treaty of 1994. Your government want's to discuss it, it has to break the treaty.

If you're asking me about what do we think about these things you asked then here: 

1. Russia should get out of Crimea, calm down. Leave Ukraine alone and let them decide what to do on their own. Stop pretending to be ""peacekeepers"". (Lithuania and Poland both addressed NATO, stating that they feel unsafe, so here we think alike)

2. Mozejki, I'm guessing you mean Mazeikiai. I don't know, I haven't read or looked to much into that. 

3. Well I guess Lithuania is planing to do that, but now our priority is to finish the Liquefied natural gas terminal in Klaipeda and get a way to produce electricity on our own. I'm not sure why did these link projects even stopped...

Come hanno scritto gli altri, tutto dipende anche da dove vivi. E' possibile vivere con soli €1000? Volendo, sì - un appartmento o uno studio sui 30m2, stando attenti a quanto spendi di alimenti (i primi anni che vivevo da solo spendevo sui €250 di spesa, più 3-4 uscite ragionevoli al mese). Purtroppo, forse sì, viverai da pezzente con soli €1000 se decidi di vivere da solo/a. Non che morirai di fame, ma se viene da fare un regalo, o se viene di fare un'uscita particolare, non lo potrai fare, e viverai in ansia. Ecco perché ti consiglio come prima esperienza di condividere per ammortizzare le spese.

true,sempiternum,sicilia,,"Ciao ti narro un po' di cose della mia vita da fuorisede a Roma, che per me conta come ""aver vissuto da solo"".


&gt;quanto può venire l'affitto di un mini appartamento (30-50mq)?

Vivi in un appartamento tutto tuo? vivi ""da solo"" o in compagnia di qualche amico, o qualcuno con cui dividere le spese? Città o paese? etc.

Al dilà del costo dell'affitto, che è uno dei primi monti difficili da oltrepassare, ci devi calcolare pure le domiciliazioni, aka bollette, e tasse varie.

&gt;quanto spende in media una persona sola d'alimenti al mese?

Detto questo, si passa alla spesa. Dipende come al primo punto, dove e quanto. Puoi fare una settimana con 60€, se sei poco esigente per la tua alimentazione, ai 150€.


Due conti:
Io in media spendevo 350€ di affitto a roma + bollette divise in tre, trasporti pubblici che stavano prima a 30€ mese poi a 45€ mi pare, e spesa per circa 120€ al mese.

ogni mese spendevo in media 800€, sono tanti soldi, dal mio punto di vista.


Ho fatto un calcolo di quanto costo ai miei genitori rimanendo in casa, tramite differenze tra le bollette prima e dopo, telefono etc.

in media spendono solo 100€ in più di alimentari al mese con me in casa, più un aumento di circa 50€ tra tutte le bollette, e sono pure di larga manica.

Ci ho aggiunto ulteriori 100€ mensili per eventuali spese mediche, abbigliamento etc, quindi circa 250€ mese. Il resto lo pagherebbero comunque, a prescindere o meno dalla mia esistenza in casa.


&gt;è possibile vivere da soli con uno stipendio da 1000€?
Se ti riesci a limitare, certo che si! 
Poi devi vedere dove vuoi affittare casa, e sei da solo.


Quindi, tl;dr: 

&gt;quanto costa vivere da soli?

la parola chiave è dipende.

Bien que ma mission n'était pas directement liée à l'appel d'offre ONP, j'ai pu voir de loin (et du point de vue du troufion de base au sein de ce monstre du conseil) les choses suivantes:

- La constitution d'un seul système est d'un seul organisme gérant la paye de près de 2,5 millions de fonctionnaires d'état est une première dans le monde. A l'époque, le seul pays ayant une problématique similaire est la Chine avec la paye de son armée. Et je ne pense pas qu'ils s'embêtent avec autant d'exceptions et de régimes différents que les nôtres.

- Au sein de ces ministères, j'ai vu des gens en charge des projets s'attaquer courageusement à la mise en place de nouveaux systèmes mais manquer énormément de pragmatisme, notamment pour la commande de prestations de développement ou de conseil: rarement les ces personnes se demandent si telle ou telle fonctionnalité est véritablement indispensable, ils cherchent d'abord à respecter les réglementations à la lettre et à ne pas faire de vagues lors des déploiements auprès des utilisateurs. Et les SSII, bien qu'ayant devoir de conseil, ne se plaignent pas souvent de vendre plus de jours/homme.

Bref, je ne sais pas si cet ONP aurait véritablement pu aboutir et si ca n'aurait pas été une nouvelle usine à gaz. Je suis certain que toutes les sociétés de conseil ont pris leur dispositions pour ne pas perdre de plumes dans l'histoire. Je suis certain par ailleurs que l'estimation chiffrée donnée dans l'article ne comprend que ces dépenses et pas le salaire des fonctionnaires qui ont passé près de 7 ans sur ce projet.

to teach them good behavior

And once they pass their test of will we’ll pass the collection plate

to help fund future causes to further bridge the gap between church and state

Yeah, I always find it hilarious that this is compared to Kosovo. Kosovo, where the Serbian nationalists banned the language, sacked Kosovar civil servants, and crafted a campaign of oppression for a decade, and were heading towards mass murder before something was done - and that was only because of what we let happen in Bosnia.

Even then, Kosovo took many more years to declare independence, and the idea of union with Albania is certainly not pushed as a realistic proposal by the largest Albanian parties.

I think they had the fourth largest air force in the world during the cold war, and air bases were hidden across the country, near highways that could be used as runways for their fighters. And they invested quite a lot in domestic aircraft production. 

They had their own nuclear programme. They had developed all the technical expertise to build a nuclear bomb, but when they signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty at the end of the 1960s, they decided to invest all the money in aircraft production instead. 

The airplanes were pretty good, too. The Viggen was the only aircraft to ever get a missile lock on an SR-71. 

The entire country was armed to the teeth to make an invasion as unappealing as possible for the Soviet Union. Every building was required to have a bomb shelter. And they could mobilise up to a million troops fairly quickly. Every civilian was given dog tags at birth in case of bombardment. 


Right now they have a pretty small military. But their equipment is still good.

&gt;Read the quotes by Prokhanov and Dugin especially. They wanted a new Cold War. Now they have finally got it.

Here's some of the quotes by Dugin. Dugin wrote the book [Foundations of Geopolitics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics) which was previously discussed on /r/europe 

&gt;""Anti-Americanism has become the main ideology, the main worldview among Russians,” he said. “Now, after Crimea, we have passed the point of no return. There will not be another Medvedev. There will never be another ‘reset,’ ever.”

&gt;Aleksandr G. Dugin, who, in the late 1990s, called for “the blinding dawn of a new Russian Revolution, fascism — borderless as our lands, and red as our blood.”

&gt;In an interview, Mr. Dugin was evasive when asked about his personal contact with Mr. Putin, saying only that he had been “in close contact with the Kremlin, and with those in the Kremlin who make decisions,” for the last 15 years. But he said the president, whom he described as a Henry Kissinger-style “pragmatist,” had embraced a version of his ideology because it served his interests domestically.

It may be exhausting, but the thrill of seeing all these places will give you extra boost. I'd use evening/night and the next day to just wander around, because it feels awesome in Paris. You know, walk along a  boulevard, sit on a bench, enter a random cafe if you find it nice, walk along the river, lie on grass in Louvre gardens. At least this is what I enjoy doing in Paris.

I'm someone who doesn't consider food an important part of a trip, but French are really great at cooking. You don't have to try unknown dishes with weird names - French make amazing steaks for example. You know what to expect from a steak, but you still get something with a local flavor. I also never skip a crossaint and a baguette in France. One of my fondest memories from Paris is simply sitting at the river bank and eating a baguette.

If you have trouble finding a place to eat that suit you and is affordable, don't waste time - have a kebab and drink coffee at Starbucks. There's nothing wrong with that.

Just like The Hague bureaucrats.

&gt; And yet they are the ones making the decisions about the common European goals.

EU regulations and directives aren't decided by ""Brussels bureaucrats"" but by the European Council and Parliament, that is, our *elected* governments and MEPs.

&gt; Take carbon tax for example. 

There is no EU carbon tax. Maybe you mean the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, which is not a tax but a ""[cap and trade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_trading)"" system, something which works quite differently and may even generate windfall profits for companies in recession countries like Greece. For instance, electricity companies are allocated emissions rights corresponding to their emissions before the economy went down. Since the economic crisis leads to lower electricity consumption and generation, they can sell their surplus emission rights at a profit.

More to the point, though, the EU ETS wasn't just decided by ""Brussels bureaucrats"" in some smoke-filled room: it was voted by the EU Parliament and Council with overwhelming public support across the EU after plenty of public debate.

One may well disagree and discuss measures adopted by the EU. Hell, I'll be the first to criticize how the EU ETS has been implemented. But it is a good idea to first get informed about:

a) what has been decided, and

b) who has decided it.

Wilders' rants are generally wide off the mark on both accounts. But that's because he simply doesn't give a shit about the issues themselves: he just seeks convenient scapegoats for his electoral basis, and ""Brussels bureaucrats"" are just as convenient as ""Moroccans"" in that respect.

This speaks more of you than me.  For all the defects America has, which are many, it has not yet turned the starting point of a genocide into a national holiday.  In the U.S. the Westward push is generally recognized as the national shame and nothing to celebrate.  

Since you like history lessons, here's some: the Reconquista is not a historical event, but a mistification of later historians.  Christian kings didn't have a notion of ""recovering"" anything nor any notion of a cultural connection with Goth kings.  This is a later ideation of Spanish noblemen hellbent on distinguishing themselves from converts.  Which brings me to the next point.    

Your notion of ""Iberian wedding"" is laughable at best.  A dynastic union is not a national union.  The only ""union"" that happened with the Catholic monarchs is the theocratic state terror managed by the Holy Office.

It's not a normal salt that is mixed into the raw meat, but something called Nitritpökelsalz, which contains anti-bacterial nitrites. This preserves the meat in its raw form. No need to worry about getting sick from it when its store-bought. 

The point where it becomes potentially dangerous is when people think they can make it themselves without the right salt. I friend of mine during his apprenticeship years used to get sent to the butcher by his coworkers to buy a kilo or two of raw pork to provide lunch for the shop. All they did was add normal salt to it. You can probably get away with it most of the time, but that's risking it. If the meat is tainted, you are playing with your life. Plus, even when you mix in the right kind of salt, you're supposed let it sit for a bit to let the nitrites work their magic. Just mixing it in and serving it right away is probably not a good idea. Also, when your using nitrites, be sure to use just the right amount, as it can be poisonous too.

The biggest divide is the one which existed since forever, since Peter the Great or even earlier, it's between the west-oriented people and russophiles. Now that confrontation is absolutely fierce and absolutely polarizing.

West-oriented people, or ""liberals"" are generally young, urbanized middle class. They want to live in European country and so on. Politically they can be left or libertatian, it doesn't matter much.

Second group, ""russophiles"", despite being usually labelled(by liberals) as dumb uneducated  bunch from the lower class isn't exactly that. Sure proletariat generally supports this group, as well as a lot of older people, but it also has huge amount of middle classed urbanized young russians as well. Ideologies can be different there, but generally it's conservatism and dislike of liberals.

They have some points there because of 90s, the time when Russia was ruled by ~~full retard~~liberals(which is arguable, but generally correct) which were showing themselves as irresponsible, corrupt and horribly incompetent and 90s is generally considered as a time of total disaster. Then Putin, from the ""russophile"" group, came and things were improving a lot compared to 90s. But being conservative he's much more authoritarian than liberals can tolerate so he's hated by them with a passion.

Not without a reason of course, together with bringing order to the economy and general life of most people he still couldn't really tackle corruption, reduced the political freedoms and brought media under the government control. So he's lambasted a lot by liberals and it's totally reasonable.

In the eyes of an average russian it's still much lesser evil, comparing to 90s. And it's totally reasonable as well, liberals couldn't really give any fresh ideas or plans or even leaders which are worth supporting. The lack of free press isn't helping them as well. Navalny could've been the leader as he started with the right thing - fight the corruption, but now his popularity decreased a lot.

So that's ""brief introduction to the modern Russian society"" for you. Obviously liberals are marching there in support of Ukraine and ""russophiles"" support Putin.
