false,hitchinvertigo,ANDO,Reus,"&gt;There were 117 NUTS 3 regions in the EU where the population fell, on average, by more than 8.0 per thousand inhabitants during the period 2008–12 

&gt;These 117 regions were largely spread across: the **Baltic Member States of Lithuania and Latvia; an arc in south-east Europe, starting in Croatia and moving through Hungary, Romania (2008–11), Bulgaria and down into Greece; several inland regions of Portugal and Spain; and many eastern German regions.** The biggest reduction in population (20.8 per thousand inhabitants per year) was registered in the Lithuanian region of Šiauliu apskritis, while Utenos apskritis (also in Lithuania) was the only other region to report that its population had declined by at least 20.0 per thousand inhabitants per year. 

&gt;In absolute terms, the highest overall increases in population during the period 2008–12 were registered in Madrid, Stockholms län, Barcelona, Berlin, the Arr. de Bruxelles-Capitale / Arr. van Brussel-Hoofdstad and Sevilla; these were **the only regions where the population rose by more than 100 000 persons**

&gt;The largest population decline in absolute terms was recorded in the **Greek capital region of Attiki (where the population fell by more than 100 000 inhabitants** between 2008 and the start of 2013); there were two NUTS 3 regions in the EU-28 where the population **fell by around 50 000, the Lithuanian region of Kauno apskritis and the Latvia capital of Rīga.**

&gt;Among the EFTA countries, population grew in every region of Norway and Switzerland, as well as in Liechtenstein (a single region at this level of analysis) and the Icelandic capital region of Höfudborgarsvædi (2008–11). The fastest population growth (in relative terms) was recorded in Oslo (the capital of Norway) and in Freiburg (western Switzerland). There was only one EFTA region where the population declined, namely, Landsbyggð (which covers the vast majority of Iceland outside of Greater Reykjavík

&gt;The number of inhabitants in most German, Italian and Austrian regions is only sustained through migration, where natural population change is generally negative. Population levels are also in decline across much of Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Romania and the Baltic Member States as a result of natural population decline — however, this development is often accentuated by net emigration, which has been particularly apparent in some regions following the financial and economic crisis. 

&gt;On the basis of a comparison between 2009 and 2012, crude birth rates fell in most EU Member States — suggesting that the financial and economic crisis impacted upon the decision to have children. Germany, Austria and the United Kingdom were the only Member States to report an increase in their crude birth rates from 2009 to 2012 (in the case of Germany and Austria from very low starting rates)

&gt;Demographic and family policy experts are divided over the reasons for this apparent reluctance to have children; however according to the latest Eurostat population projections **there will probably be a reduction in population numbers in the coming decades, with Germany, Spain and the Baltic Member States among the affected Member States.**

Araba lose it in the Middle-Ages. 
Basque dialects are divised from East to West. The central dialects *Gipuzkera*, *Nafarrera* and *Lapurtera* constitutes the core of Euskara Batua. Extrem occidental (Bizkaiera)and extrem oriental(Xiberera, Erronkariera)  dialects are the farest from standard basque. The original dialect of Araba was considered an occidental dialect like *Bizkaiera*. 

I'm a basque native speaker of the sub-dialect of my village, a speaker of the dialect of my province *lapurtera*, and  ultimately, an  *Euskara Batua* speaker. 

Althought *Euskara batua* means a standard language for every one, I think that what I ought to be standard basque language may sound very *lapurtera* dialect oriented  to your ears. What you ought to be standard language could sound  very *bizkaiera* or *gipuzkera* oriented to my ears.
There are several *Euskara Batua* spoken. The *Euskara Batua* of Bilbo is not like the *Euskara Batua* of *Donostia*, *Iruñea*  or *Maule*. Standard basque still have local variations in phonetics and grammar. 

My generation knew grandfathers and parents only speaking dialect while we were learning *Euskara Batua* in school.

Dialects are still alive but I fear it won't stand for centuries.

I can only really speak about Estonia, since I'm not that familiar with the rest of former soviet block. 

I think the problem is that we're still experiencing the effects of Soviet Union and the poverty right after it. There weren't really many healthcodes in place during the Soviet Union and for a small period after. So people consumed food, used materials, drank water, etc that would've been banned in the western world. Also since people lived in poverty, poor nutrition was a big problem aswell. This still affects those people decades later. The people who have lived their entire lives with good nutrition and health codes will start dying of old age in ~60 years. Subpar medical care left it's mark too, since poor treatment/no treatment might not kill you now, but it might shave off a decade of your life expectancy.  

Medical care is really really good in Estonia now, I don't think it's any worse than in UK, US or anywhere else. We have really well trained doctors, surgeons etc. Tartu University is in the top 3% of the universities in the world. We have all the latest tech, we don't have as many per capita, but we manage. 

We're not that poor anymore, we've successfully curbed smoking and pollution.

Alcohol is still a big issue, I'm a rather big drinker myself, although this is a cultural thing I guess, since Finns are rather big drinkers aswell. It's a problem we need to work with and spread more awerness on.

Fertility rates were lower than 1.50 live births per woman in 13 Member States; the lowest rate being recorded in **Portugal** — one of the countries most severely hit by the financial and economic crisis — at **1.28 live births per woman**.

In developed parts of the world, a total of around 2.1 live births per woman is considered to be the natural replacement rate — in other words, the level at which the size of the population would remain stationary, in the long-run, if there were no inward or outward migration.

It actually was science of the time, and it had long tradition too. And as a proponent of scientocracy that should be no surprise to you as it is a well researched area of history and history of science. But your denial of it is alarming, apparently you're not a scientist - not willing to deal with truth but rather deny it.

We all know science is faulty and prone to error. All human endeavor is. Basically your ideal of scientocracy is just as attainable and desirable as the creation of 'homo sovieticus' was. You even pepper it with active denial of known errors. We do not need it, and we do not want it.

Take a good look at the past century and its errors killing millions. I think Jacob Bronowsky puts it best here, please take your time to watch it: [BBC Ascent of Man - 11 - Knowledge or Certainty](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x20ohne_bbc-ascent-of-man-11-knowledge-or-certainty_tv)

He puts it very well:
&gt; It's said that science will dehumanize people and turn them into numbers. That's false, tragically false. Look for yourself. This is the concentration camp and crematorium at Auschwitz. This is where people were turned into numbers. Into this pond were flushed the ashes of some four million people. And that was not done by gas. It was done by arrogance, it was done by dogma, it was done by ignorance. When people believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality, this is how they behave. This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods.
&gt;
Science is a very human form of knowledge. We are always at the brink of the known; we always feel forward for what is to be hoped. Every judgment in science stands on the edge of error and is personal. Science is a tribute to what we can know although we are fallible. In the end, the words were said by Oliver Cromwell: ""I beseech you in the bowels of Christ: Think it possible you may be mistaken.""
&gt;
I owe it as a scientist to my friend Leo Szilard, I owe it as a human being to the many members of my family who died here, to stand here as a survivor and a witness. We have to cure ourselves of the itch for absolute knowledge and power. We have to close the distance between the push-button order and the human act.

The two lowest crude death rates were recorded for the French overseas regions of Guyane (3.2 deaths per thousand inhabitants) and Réunion (5.0), while the other two French overseas regions (Martinique and Guadeloupe) and four outlying Spanish regions (Illes Balears, Canarias, Ciudad Autónoma de Ceuta and Ciudad Autónoma de Melilla) were also present among the 27 NUTS 2 regions where the crude death rate was less than 8.0 per thousand inhabitants. Otherwise, many of the remaining regions were capital regions, such as Helsinki-Uusimaa, Stockholm, Inner and Outer London, the Comunidad de Madrid, Southern and Eastern (Ireland) and the Île de France; Luxembourg and Cyprus were also present among this group (these two Member States are both covered by a single region at this level of analysis).

&gt;There were four NUTS 2 regions in the EU where infant mortality rates in 2012 were in double figures (see Figure 5). They included the French overseas region of Guadeloupe, the two Bulgarian regions of Severozapaden and Yugoiztochen, and the Sud-Est region of Romania (where the highest infant mortality rate was recorded, 11.6 deaths per thousand live births); 

&gt;At the other end of the range, the lowest infant mortality rates were recorded in Slovenia (1.6 deaths per thousand live births), Finland (2.4) and Luxembourg (2.5). 

&gt;No infant mortality in the Åland islands in three out of the last four years

[Right, except it seems that every country except RoI does it by party list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_to_the_European_Parliament#Voting_system). So while technically, yes we could all use STV, we don't.

&gt; That is entirely correct. And not a problem at all, as they voted for candidates that did not make it to the EP, or, in making it, supported other groups/candidates.

My main point about the EC President is that he is not directly elected, he is elected by a plurality as a proxy of voting for the EU party which you voted for by proxy when you vote for your national party. They do not campaign on their own merit, the fact that nobody in the UK could vote even if they wanted to for the candidate who won is just an illustration of the problem. Most ""Presidents"" are selected by a direct vote.

&gt; So are the UK government cabinets - the only person in there that you're guaranteed to have voted for is the prime-minister (even if, by tradition, most ministers are also MPs).

Sure, not all ministers are elected (some come in through the house of lords), however, the initial line up of ministers after an election is known at the time of the election, also, they are directly responsible for implementing party policies (announced in the election manifesto). While it is rare for a minister to lose his seat at an election, they do regularly lose their jobs when they or their policies fail, or become unpopular. The EU commissioners are neither elected based on their policies, or should their policies be highly unpopular/unworkable, their job is not in danger. Accountability for policies seems rare, the only time I can see this happened was when the [1999 Santer commission had to resign over corruption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santer_Commission#Resignation). The commission is far far more removed from the individual voter than the UK cabinet.

Correct? Do I need to remind you of this again? This claim has nothing to do with whether or not anti-circumcision is fueled by anti-semitism, it categorically denies any link to Islam and Judaism altogether.

Then adding anti-semitism (and *admitting you added it*, too) means I need to support that, and I haven't yet, because that's not what I was responding to. You are confused.

You have a selective memory, don't you?

&gt; I fail to bother citing sources for ""I don't find your claim convincing"", this is due to not needing one.

You need to cite sources claiming health is the only concern rather than political overtones to prove it. Claiming you don't need proof by attempting to claim the proof requirement is for something else entirely is sophism; I figured that's what you were doing all along anyway.

Apparently not, and I'm not pro-circumcision per se, just anti-bullshit.

Try actually undermining *something* with sources, evidence, logic and argument, while remaining abreast with your own comment history, how's that?

This was Putin's offer at the Valdai conference, his bluster masking a desperation to save face.

By the way, here's a quote about the situation in the UK:

""Days after restrictions on workers from eastern Europe were lifted, Mr Miliband also called for a legal loophole to be closed which allows British workers to pay foreign workers less. From the start of 2014 curbs workers from Romania and Bulgaria coming to Britain have been lifted, raising fears of a fresh influx of cheap labour under-cutting people who already live in the UK.""

Well, what's your point? Nobody said human factors should be ignored.

&gt;You have evidence with which you would like to make decisions, OK. Where did that evidence come from? Who undertook this research? With what goal in mind? Who funded the research? Which questions were left purposefully unaddressed? Who commissioned the research in the first place? Who decided the question needed to be researched at all, and for what reason? 

I don't see the point of these questions. Things will get managed the same way scientists manage them in international academia today just with less dependencies on corporate oligarchs and without having to beg for public grants so much.

&gt;You are underestimating how these factors contribute to a warped perception of reality despite being examined through the lens of science.

What am I underestimating?

&gt;Lyenskoism? Phrenology? Polygraphy? Psychoanalysis? Chiropractics? Scientific racism? 

What about these things? These things are all discredited by the scientific community and only people led by irrational ideology still hang on to them (if even).

&gt;Is it a rational decision to keep a mentally ill man alive at large cost to the state? Of course not. Is it a humanitarian and ethical decision? Yes!

What's your point?

Scientists don't act independently from humanism and ethics.

&gt;Another ideal system would be one without rulers, where everyone in society is equal and oppression is non-existent.

That's not an ideal system. That system will show the same flaws democracy does. As it's led by idiots (i.e. the people).

&gt;In practice this results in Stalinism.

No. No, it really doesn't.

Stalinism is the opposite of what you described and not at all developed based on the premises you just set.

&gt;My argument is not with the ideal -on the contrary I also find it a goal to strive towards- but with how you plan to carry out such a policy in reality.

The same way you establish public universities today.

&gt;What governing body decides who's researcher's science is correct?

What governing body decides who becomes a PhD today?   



Once again: I do not see your point. What is a better system? Democracy is obviously shit and definitely not better than a system led by scientists.

Seriously: There are countless of ways to establish a scientocratic system. And the very nature of the system makes it impossible to determine a single, static way of determining such thing as the very purpose is to continuously adapt and improve based on new information.

The premise should be that *everyone* who can show his/her merit in an objective and transparent manner will be able to participate. You can establish a rotating government of scientocrats who make proposals. Those proposals will then be subjected to a public peer review process everyone who has shown the necessary academic merit/factual knowledge can participate in. The proposals who couldn't be eliminated based can be put to a vote of all scientocrats. 

That's only one of countless of ways you can do it.

Verissimo. Ci stiamo facendo sempre piu' la reputazione dei cazzari inaffidabili - vedi anche Matteino il bullo che va a rinfacciare alla Merkel di aver preso piu' voti di lei.

E' un gioco pericolosissimo, che fa leva sia sul supporto di Draghi che sul fatto che l'Italia e' ritenuta da alcuni troppo grande per poter fallire (cioe' andare in default parziale o totale). 

Ricordiamoci pero' che e' bastato un sorrisino fra Sarkozy e Merkel ed un'impennata dello spread per seppellire B.; e c'e' il rischio concreto che anche Renzi finisca cosi', magari con disastri aggiuntivi per il paese.

Indian masters students, phd, postdocs etc who get visas to study in Germany are highly qualified professionals, who have a very high **opportunity cost** of learning a new language. Their time is better spent improving their core competencies. 

German government is narrowly focused on attracting MINT (STEM profession) immigrants who view a new language as an impediment and not as new cultural experience.  These students have increasingly better options back home as well as in USA and Scandinavia, so unless a German university makes a compelling offer these high skilled professionals won't be interested. This is increasingly the case with Asian business students as well.

Now my personal experience,
Lot of students from India, have to spend lot of money to be able to stay in Germany. They cannot go out to eat or party as often as their German peers. They instinctively know they will have a hard time making friends with locals/ creating a social network of locals. So they simply avoid making such efforts. A few who do try to create such social networks face lot of cultural friction. Eventually they get dejected and create social networks of international students, which means the need to learn German is obviated. 

Side note: I am a business student in the beautiful city of Cologne and do learn the language, simply because it is challenging. 

TLDR: 
1. German is not an economically attractive language. 
2. Germans (my experience so far), do not charm people into learning their language.

Science is not an umbrella tool for all policy-making as-is.  It's a great tool for telling us (for example) which gasses we should regulate, but is it a great tool for telling us which type of society we should strive towards?  No - because it depends what your end goals are and here there are no absolutes.  If you want rational decisions to be made, with what goal in mind are they being made, and how do you set that goal?  

Can science tell you whether a social welfare state is superior to a libertarian individualistic state?  Both have their plus points depending on your preference - but science cannot tell you what your preference is.

&gt;What am I underestimating?

The degree to which your ideal of pure science is warped by money, influence, careers, bureaucracy, agenda-setting, and nepotism.

&gt;Things will get managed the same way scientists manage them in international academia today

Do you understand how this process occurs?  I can speak only for astronomy/astrophysics, in which decadal field-wide goals and priorities are announced by groups of survey committee members who all have their own interests as they work for either laboratories, institutes, universities, observatories, or corporations. How would you suggest separating scientific policy makers from their own research interests and goals?  How do you think these committee members should be granted their powers, and how do you think this currently occurs? 

&gt;What about these things? These things are all discredited by the scientific community

They are *now*, which is exactly my point.  You asked me specifically whether anyone had ever regretted listening to scientists, don't act mystified when you get a reply you didn't want. 

&gt;Scientists don't act independently from humanism and ethics.

Scientific ethics is completely relative.  I've received training in 'the ethics of science' and it is nothing but an echo of contemporary cultural values.  Arbitrary and subject to future change - not rational in the least.

&gt;That's not an ideal system. 

Did scientific evidence lead you to that conclusion?

&gt;Stalinism is the opposite of what you described and not at all developed based on the premises you just set.

Hence the term ""in practice"".  This is used to describe what occurs when ideas are put into usage.  The result can be completely contrary to the intention.

&gt;What governing body decides who becomes a PhD today?

&gt;

&gt;__Oh bej! Oh bej!__ (in [Milanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milanese): ""oh so nice! oh so nice!""; pronounced: /o-bay o-bay/)  is the most important and traditional [Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas) [fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair) in [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy). It is held from 7 December (day of the [patron saint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patron_saint) of [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan), [Ambrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrose)) until the following Sunday. The fair is also informally known as the ""Fiera di Sant'Ambrogio"" (""Saint Ambrose Fair"").

&gt;The Oh bej! Oh bej! fair has been held in different areas of Milan; until 1886, it was located in [Piazza Mercanti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_Mercanti) (in the surroundings of the [Duomo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Milan)); from 1886 to 2006, it was held by the [Basilica di Sant'Ambrogio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_di_Sant%27Ambrogio); in 2006, it was relocated again, to the area of the [Sforza Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sforza_Castle).

&gt;The most typical goods that are sold at Oh bej! Oh bej! are sweets and Christmas or winter delicacies, handcrafts such as Christmas decorations, toys, antiques, souvenirs, bric-a-brac, and more.  The fair is usually very crowded; this is partly because, as Saint Ambrose Day is immediately followed by the [Immaculate Conception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immaculate_Conception) Day (an Italian national holiday), and this in turn might be followed by a week-end, Milanese usually have several free days in the fair's days.

Ma réaction sur les 40 premières secondes :

Il y a un réel problème de compréhensibilité au niveau de l'audio. Je ne saurais vraiment dire d'où vient le problème, si c'est la musique, ta diction, le niveau du micro ou bien la qualité de l'enregistrement, mais c'est ce qui m'empêcherait de me concentrer sur le contenu de la vidéo. Si je devais deviner, je dirais qu'il y a un léger problème de timbre sur la piste vocale.

Ça devient d'autant plus problèmatique quand tu commences à rentrer dans les détails techniques, quand tu dis ""l'aérogel le plus répandu c'est l'aérogel **de silice**"" vers 0:35 par exemple, j'ai dû me concentrer pour comprendre ce que tu venais de dire, et pourtant je connais. Si quelqu'un ne connaît pas ce mot tu risques fortement de le perdre à ce moment-là. Risque, donc, qu'il décroche complètement.

En plus c'est au milieu d'une phrase - je pense qu'il faut faire vachement gaffe lors de la rédaction de ton texte à bien placer les termes techniques importants et nouveaux pour l'auditeur. Genre ""...l'aérogel de silice &lt;POINT&gt; &lt;PAUSE&gt; Il se compose..."". 

Et après j'ai remis en marche la vidéo, et là tu m'as perdu avec l'explication sur les phases. C'est quoi une phase ? Ta vidéo s'adresse-t-elle à des gens qui savent ce que c'est ? Si oui, je ne sais pas vraiment si on peut parler de vulgarisation. Si non, désolé mais tu les as perdus.

Entre 1:20 et 2:00, tu perds l'entrain et le bon rythme (c'est pas vraiment le terme, mais je ne sais pas comment dire) dont tu faisais preuve auparavant, et tes phrases deviennent très flottantes, comme quand quelqu'un fait un exposé et perd le fil de ses notes. 

Sur le contenu, j'ai eu du mal à suivre tes explications sur le processus de fabrication, pour plusieurs raisons je pense, mais j'ai peur que je manque de connaissances pour pouvoir bien t'expliquer pourquoi. Déjà, ton explication manque un peu de structure. Explique d'abord ce que c'est, ensuite comment on le fabrique, là j'ai eu l'impression que tu m'expliquais les deux à la fois. Ensuite tes phrases sont un peu vaseuses: ""on va regarder le diagramme de phase de la partie qui est normalement liquide et on va savoir son état"", ça me parle pas vraiment, par exemple. L'état de quoi ? Pourquoi la partie est normalement liquide. Merde, c'est quoi une partie, d'ailleurs ? Une partie de quoi ?

La partie sur les applications est plus facile à suivre, heureusement, et conclut donc la vidéo sur une note plus positive :-)

Voilà pour le texte. Si tu veux que je pousse encore plus loin, poste une transcription et je me ferais une joie de te donner des exemples des problèmes de syntaxe qui limitent la compréhension.

 Sur le visuel :

- Si je me rappelle vaguement mes cours sur powerpoint, quand tu te sers du tableau, il me semble que ça ne doit jamais être pour présenter des informations nouvelles. C'est que tu fais quand tu présentes le surnom de nuage figé, information qui apparaît pendant que tu parles d'autre chose, c'est distrayant et cela ne renforce pas ton propos.

How am I underestimating that?


&gt;How would you suggest separating scientific policy makers from their own research interests and goals? How do you think these committee members should be granted their powers, and how do you think this currently occurs?

The same way we do today. Well, at least at first, most likely.

&gt;They are now, which is exactly my point.

Yes. They are now. What exactly is your point?

&gt;Scientific ethics is completely relative. I've received training in 'the ethics of science' and it is nothing but an echo of contemporary cultural values. Arbitrary and subject to future change - not rational in the least.

Yes. That's what ethics are. So, what's your point?

&gt;Did scientific evidence lead you to that conclusion?

Yes. Most certainly.    

The rule of law has been proven to make society a lot more effective at reaching long term goals and improving everyone's quality of life.

Is there a form of organizing society with a better track record or something that promises better results that hasn't been tested yet?

&gt;Hence the term ""in practice"". 

But Stalinism isn't the ""in practice"" result of the premises you stated.

&gt;In English this is used to describe what occurs when ideas are put into usage. The result can be completely contrary to the intention.

Yes, I understood that. Your point is still invalid, Stalinism doesn't follow from those premises.

&gt;What is your point?

My point is that there are systems today that can be utilized to determining things. 

That means your question doesn't highlight a problem that can't be solved in a sufficient manner, therefore doesn't really discredit the proposed system.

You seem to be arguing against the system I propose. So far I see not a single point made against it. It's still superior to democracy (which you also could ask countless of questions about). If that's the purpose of your comment, your questions aren't meaningful. Why? Because there are countless of ways to implement a system like I propose. You won't be able to determine what the best way is before putting it to the test and incrementally improving upon it. That, by the way, is the whole point of the system and one of the main points that make it superior to democracy.",0,1414441729,null,0,false,0,cllghpv,t3_2kgac7,t1_cllghpv,t1_cllfrzz,null,1426321312,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

What I like about Germany:

* the public transportation which is absolutely great; I left my car back at home and I don't even miss it.
* the order - a program is a program in Germany. Office hours are between 10-12? Then be there between 10-12 and we will help you.. otherwise, see you another day. 
* the silence - people often reading, listening to music or enjoying their Kindle. No useless commercials in the public transport, no  noise, no people turning their music on late at night. In my hometown I used to wake up to the sounds of the wall drill made by neighbours, now I wake up to the  sound of birds singing...
* no stray dogs - compared to Romania where the poor dogs are on the streets and there is no animal police
* drinkable tap water - yes, the water actually tastes good and you can drink it
* recycling - plastic bottles, coffee cups which you can return and get some money back
* really helpful people - yes, people try to help you as much as they can, even if they don't know you. 
* bike lanes everywhere

Der Appell fruchtete: Im Sommer waren 900.000 Euro Startkapital zusammengekommen; die Betaphase soll im September beginnen. Tatsächlich rührend ist die Vorstellung, der Journalismus müsse repariert werden – setzt sie doch voraus, so etwas wie einen deutschen Journalismus hätte es schon einmal gegeben, zumindest in einer Form, für die man sich nicht hätte schämen müssen. Doch der deutsche Journalist ist auch Romantiker, und deshalb bekamen die Entwicklungshelfer in eigener Sache Rückenwind gerade von besonders kaputten Medien, von »Zeit« bis »FAZ«. Rührend romantisch ist auch das Wenige, was die Homepage der Krauts an Ideen präsentiert: Ein »Erzähljournalismus« soll etabliert werden, »Erzählstücke« von »tollen Autoren« sollen erscheinen, abgerundet durch »witzige Überschriften« zu »Themen, mit denen wir uns auskennen«. Vor allem aber dürfen sich die Krautreporter rühmen, den journalistischen Journalismus erfunden zu haben, denn »emotional, relevant, journalistisch« werde es durchaus zugehen, so das Versprechen.

You tell me ""What could possibly be achieved that is better than the rule of scientists?"" and I say: a system without the drawbacks I've mentioned above.  To me this implies you haven't seen all of the potential problems, if you can't think of a better system.  In fact you seem entirely unwilling to address any issue at all, ""what's your point?"" is not a valid rebuke.  

&gt;Yes. That's what ethics are. So, what's your point?

How does a purely rational/scientific government come to a conclusion regarding ethics?  How is rationalism used as a basis for legality?

&gt;Yes. They are now. What exactly is your point?

I think you understand my point quite well. What one day can be considered sound science (by whatever subset of the scientific community is relevant - for there is no such thing as *the* scientific community) can be discredited the next.  Now imagine setting policies that sterilize, resettle, imprison, or execute people based on that science.

&gt;Yes. Most certainly.

Alright, please cite the relevant studies. 

&gt;You seem to be arguing against the system I propose.

Do your research before doing a survey.

Video games are not censored in Germany, censorship is explicitly forbidden by the constitution. Censorship would imply that there is a state organization that censors certain aspects of publications, which doesn't happen.

What you might confuse for censorship is the threat of a media being put on the index. This doesn't mean that it is forbidden in any way to produce, offer, buy, sell or own this piece of media. It's only not allowed to sell it to minors, and not allowed to advertise it at places where minors have unrestricted access. It is comparable to the AO rating, only in Germany you get such a rating for gratuitous, extreme violence and not for flashing a nipple.

For marketing purposes such a rating is of course not particularly desirable for publishers, so they usually send in a toned down version to the board that they cut themselves, in the hope of getting a lower rating and opening the market of underage players.

The USK board (A private organization btw that mostly operates on its own under guidelines) only hands out the rating, it is explicitly forbidden from making any remarks about what would need to be done to achieve a certain rating to not actively 'censor' a product.

There are only very few exceptions. It is in general forbidden to sell products with unconstitutional symbols, most famously the swastika as it was used in the third reich, holocaust denial, and the usual suspects like child pornography, real violence (actual snuff films or something like that), sedition. Though for artworks there is an exception. (That's why for example the Indy movies get away with swastikas).

I am not my flag. Feminism, including third wave feminism, is not an ""American"" phenomenon, but even if it were, its theoretical body of work is broadly accepted in academic circles because it is well reasoned and logically consistent — I'm not sure why you would assume any other cause.

Now:

&gt; Patriarchy is defined as a society or government in which men hold the power, where women are largely excluded, and where power is normatively used for male gain.

You're literally looking at a group of 33 people of whom 6 are women. Those 33 people are the rulers of our continent.

Moreover, it's pretty easy to argue that the EU as an institution generally favours power structures established by existing patriarchal traditions in the private sector — the percentage of women CEOs is even lower in Europe than the percentage of national leaders.

It's not a given that male politicians cannot or will not take issues affecting women into account — but it is plainly obvious that women simply do not have equal access to power.

&gt; As to your last point. There has been a good deal of research into that area, although more is needed. There are a few things researchers have identified: Higher testosterone levels increase impulsivity and risk taking; difference in gray/white matter composition; relative genomic instability in comparative terms in relation between males and females.

I haven't seen a single conclusion like that, that wouldn't be immediately dismissed dishonourably by anyone who had taken just a single class in Anthropology or Sociology. It's very well to study hormones and brain structure, but human behaviour is *significantly* more complex than that.

The issue isn't necessarily that their conclusions are wrong — it's very possible that people with higher levels of testosterone are less 'risk averse'. The issue comes when whatever experimental parameters are interpreted as immediately transferrable to other forms of human behaviour. How was 'risk aversion' measured? Does the measured characteristic directly reflect the suitability of someone for holding powerful positions in society?

More importantly, does the study control for the obvious environmental factors, such as the fact that men in our culture are conditioned from a very, very early age to be ""go-getters"" and risk takers, while women are similarly conditioned to never do anything exciting? If so, how exactly does it control for that, because I'm not aware of a good way to do that, since the impact of such indoctrination is probably impossible to really measure.

**Note:** I'm not saying that all this research is bad research, but that the interpretation of such research almost always is. In most cases because science reporting is extremely poor, and in some cases because people including researchers want publicity surrounding their work, so they make a sensationalist extrapolation for which they have little basis.",0,1414444947,null,0,false,0,cllib1z,t3_2kgb29,t1_cllib1z,t1_cllazx0,null,1426320465,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You cannot simply assume what any of them would have voted (specially by extrapolating from pre war data), as both the borders and the situation has changed

Well I can assume that just extrapolating the data of those who voted in Ukrainian controlled territory in the East. You can check it for yourself in korrespondent.net infographic map.

For example, [here is an extract](http://i.imgur.com/xN2iGtQ.png) from the part of Luhansk controlled by Ukrainian Army and volunteer battalions. It says that ""pro-Russian"" forces got 57,65% of total votes. You cannot suspect fraud for Russia here because that zone was very well monitored by Ukrainian officials. 

And this taking in account that there was a call to boycott the elections because some people argued that: 

1) ""We have voted before and our vote was neglected both in 2004 (Orange Revolution, which lead to 3rd round, and gave opposition almost 2 month to consolidate themselves against elected Yanukovich and have very powerful PR campaign) and in 2014 (when Yanukovich was ousted and new government was formed with 0 representation of the people from South-East), there is no use voting"".

2) Party of Region failed us by succumbing to the coup.

3) Party of Region failed us by being sold out to Russia/West/New Government...

4) Party of Region broke in two (""Sylnaya Ukraina"" and ""Opposition Block"").

While people who voted for Poroshenko had no reason to not come to vote.

So this can be extrapolated easily to Crimea which was always more pro-Russian that Donbas. And that can be extrapolated to the territories controlled by the rebels.

At least that's my argument.

Nah. It's a living joke on Berlusconi policies.

When Finland negotiated for a EU membership in the 90s we were promised to have the [European Food Safety Authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Food_Safety_Authority).

Then enter Berlusconi. For some reason he suddenly was vehemently opposed to the idea of Finland having the authority on food safety. Probably because we should all know how safe Italian food is - it's not like hundreds dying because of poisonous oil or high amounts of enviromental toxins bear any relevance here.

Anyway, everyone was baffled when he out of the blue started his sudden campaign against Finland having that particular agency. He went on to a personal crusade about it. He was mostly taken as the clown he was, but in his personal crusade that clown used insults in need of an answer. Hence the victorious Pizza Berlusconi.

Thanks to him the European Food Safety Authority is now located in Parma, Italy. It has become one of the most costly and least efficient agencies in the EU continuously tapping to the EU budget. Even a single meeting of the board costs ridiculous amounts. And all EU taxpayers pay for that.

Meanwhile the European Chemicals Agency that was given to Finland does not need much EU budget support. The agency has become efficient enough to actually fund itself not tapping into pockets of EU taxpayers while providing its services to all of them.

We still don't know why it was suddenly so important for Berlusconi to do everything he could to prevent Finland from having the European Food Safety Authority. Maybe history will tell us some day. And if the European Food Safety Authority hailing from Parma tells me an Italian produce is perfectly safe to eat, I tend to avoid that product recommended by those croocks.

&gt; The foundations for Franco-Russian cooperation on a program of this size have been laid on several fronts over the last few years. France’s Thales already provides components for Russia’s front line military equipment, from tank gunnery sights to avionics and targeting pods for Russian-built fighters. Recent memoranda of understanding for cooperation in naval R&amp;D external link (Thales) and defense R&amp;D more generally external link (EADS) build on the 2006 MoU between DCN and the Russian government external link to develop technical, industrial and commercial co-operations between the Mistral’s builder and Russia’s naval defense industry.

(...)

&gt; “A Russian combat management system will be installed on board in France. **The communication system will integrate Russian communication equipment with French equipment.** Some of these equipment will be installed and integrated with the French equipment, some Russian equipment will be installed in Russia. The radar is French. ESM(Electronic Support Measures, detects &amp; pinpoints incoming radar emissions) is not planned on board. Only the pre-installation of the self-defence (A360, Gibkha) will be done in France. The installation will be done in Russia, after the delivery of the ship.”

Hong Kong has some of that British orderliness. Bangkok, Thailand meanwhile is insanity.

The key is to just boldly start walking, and they will stop. 

In Paris the problem I see is that *some* people stop and others don't. Some people will stop and hold up a road for 60 seconds to get a parking spot, all while people behind them honk. I've never seen that anywhere else.

Let me know when the humanities or the co-opted pseudo-Marxian field of sociology debase cognitive neuroscience; trying reading the *peer reviewed scientific literature* I noted above. I'm sorry but the rest is simply dribble. Feminism skirting the peer-review process and pushing its adjunct notions contained with the 'theoretical body'  are not well accepted; nor cross-confirmed, or even peer-reviewed in many instances.

&gt; You're literally looking at a group of 33 people of whom 6 are women. Those 33 people are the rulers of our continent.
Moreover, it's pretty easy to argue that the EU as an institution generally favours power structures established by existing patriarchal traditions in the private sector — the percentage of women CEOs is even lower in Europe than the percentage of national leaders.

You ignored my distinction between men/women holding power and that power being used for the benefit of men/women. 

Here you go:

&gt; **There is a difference between a man/woman holding power, and a man/woman using said power for the sole benefit of men/women. A small distinction, but an important one.**



--

&gt; The issue isn't necessarily that their conclusions are wrong — it's very possible that people with higher levels of testosterone are less 'risk averse'. The issue comes when whatever experimental parameters are interpreted as immediately transferrable to other forms of human behaviour. How was 'risk aversion' measured? Does the measured characteristic directly reflect the suitability of someone for holding powerful positions in society?
More importantly, does the study control for the obvious environmental factors, such as the fact that men in our culture are conditioned from a very, very early age to be ""go-getters"" and risk takers, while women are similarly conditioned to never do anything exciting? If so, how exactly does it control for that, because I'm not aware of a good way to do that, since the impact of such indoctrination is probably impossible to really measure.


How about instead of postulating hypothetical ""what-ifs"" you read the aforementioned literature instead of dismissing it out of hand? Because right now all I see is a lot of hand waving.

--

I never made any positive claims in regards to the effects of such studies. While I will posit that irrespective of your aforementioned, and unnecessarily laborious considerations, even if there were confounding factors, which there almost always are, the *very existence of well-explained sexual dimorphism* undermines a lot of feminist theory. Which, as I understand, rests upon primary, secondary, and tertiary socialization processes to explain what we see. *Problem is the inbuilt biases of such study presume what is called the ""blank-slate"" theory of cognitive development; which was discredited nearly 100 years ago.* This is the problem with that so-called 'academic' work you mention: *It ignores science.* Nearly ever point you make in rebuke and contestation of a claim has within it the presumption that the claim in question is true; **that is circular logic, a logical fallacy, and blatantly dishonest.**


For example:

&gt;Moreover, it's pretty easy to argue that the EU as an institution generally favours power structures established by existing patriarchal traditions in the private sector — the percentage of women CEOs is even lower in Europe than the percentage of national leaders.

In rebuke to my contestation of patriarchy you assume patriarchy theory. If I tried doing that with religion you'd laugh at me and realize how silly that is.

In most cases* because science reporting is extremely poor*, and in some cases because people including researchers want publicity surrounding their work, so they make a sensationalist extrapolation for which they have little basis.


When I'm talking about science I source **peer-reviewed academic literature, not articles.**

A cheap option is ""Mitfahrzentrale"". These are organisations that match people wanting to get from A to B with people who have cars and need help with fuel costs.

Otherwise, unless you want to hire a car, the options are coach or train. Coach is cheaper, but takes twice as long so you'd have less time to explore. Train can be expensive, but if you book in advance you can get some very reasonable deals.

&gt; Destinations - I would be interested in seeing the bigger cities like Berlin, Munich, ect

You could spend two weeks in Berlin and still not see all it has to offer. Potsdam is right next to Berlin and is well worth a visit. Munich can be pricey, but is a popular tourist destination, a day trip away from the foothills of the Alps. Other cities might include Hamburg, Dresden, Leipzig, Cologne, Frankfurt and Nuremberg. Besides the big cities, there are so many places out in the countryside it's hard to know where to begin. Usual tourist traps include Rothenburg ob der Tauber, and a river cruise up the Rhine from Rüdesheim to Koblenz.

&gt; Is food expensive or does it usually vary?

It varies considerably. ""Where the locals go"" is, on the face of it, great advice; but *finding* where the locals go can be a real challenge.

&gt; What kind of cultural things should we know about

Tipping -- it's done totally differently over here than in America.

They got something out of it,  not sure if the saudis(limiting Iraqi oil industry modernisation) or the US/israel got more out of it.(surrounding Iran)

ACtually they do, most winners don't stay around. Only the US forgets to completely witdraw. It's kinda of creepy.


&gt;More recently, when China has been getting more aggressive, Japan has requested more US presence.

This would be such a interesting tangent. Confucianist don't have big enough egos to protest the terms of a superior force.

&gt;The current involvement was at the request of the Iraqi government.

I would argue that the US could not ""rule"" over them. Having a empire is hard and expensive.

Both russia and to a lesser extent have imediate(close proximity) threats to their interest. The US does not have any such issues.

Non, ça ne dure pas trop longtemps. Exemple le lien que j'ai mis au dessus, l'auteur a considéré toute activité de dérivés comme spéculatif (du moins, c'est ce que je suppose puisqu'il ne met aucune source). Donc un client qui te demande un produit et toi qui le fournit, c'est du spéculatif maintenant ? Ce qu'il dit est tout simplement faux. Il a fait à une époque une analyse de bilan d'une banque et a inventé des définitions pour les lignes comptables pour aller dans le sens du grand méchant spéculateur risqué. J'ai ajouté un commentaire avec les définitions des lignes en question dans les normes comptables en vigueur (copier-coller) ce qui était directement en conflit avec ses théories. Résultat, commentaire non approuvé. Je le répète encore une fois, ce qu'il fait est de la diffamation. Un mensonge grossier qui ne tient pas à l'analyse.

&gt; Mais au sujet des variables de shock, elles sont ridicules.

Tout simplement parce qu'il ne comprend pas comment elles sont appliquées. Par exemple, appliquer un shock de 140 points de base (et non pas 1.4 points de base comme il le dit) c'est massif. Pourquoi massif alors que c'est relativement crédible comme évolution sur un an me diras-tu ? Tout simplement parce que tu appliques tous ces scénarios comme si toutes les courbes de taux étaient modifiées aujourd'hui (j'imagine que tu sais ce qu'est une courbe de taux, tu peux me dire si tu n'es pas familier avec le principe). Dans le monde réel, les 140 points de base vont être étalés dans le temps, par exemple 25/50 points de base par mois. Çà, c'est combiné avec tous les indicateurs appliqués dès aujourd'hui - c'est à dire qu'on modifie tous les paramètres de prix futur en même temps. On estime ainsi dès aujourd'hui que le prix de l'immobilier dans 3 ans sera 26% de moins que ce que l'on pensait ce matin.

Dans la vraie vie, la durée de vie des dérivés de taux est de moins d'un an et demi. Ce sont des produits très liquides (c'est à dire qu'en une journée tu peux ramener tes risques à quasiment rien et liquider l'intégralité de ton portefeuille assez vite).

They didn't get an ally surrounding Iran. The Iraqi government is openly anti-American. And the oil industry is being modernized by outside companies, so not really a good argument. The US also left at the insistence of the Iraqi government, so they are not surrounding Iran. 

&gt;Only the US forgets to completely witdraw. It's kinda of creepy.

Only that is completely false. If the US is asked to leave it leaves unless it has a long term lease, i.e. Guantanamo. Iraq and Afghanistan asked US forces to withdraw, so they are. The US virtually completely withdrew from Iraq before ISIS started making headway. If a country wants the US to stay it will. France, Iraq, Afghanistan are examples of this. 

&gt;Consider the short temper of the americans combined with the close proximity to someone they(and the american public) would consider a ideological oposition or a traditional enemy(in the case of china), do you think they would have manifested as much precaution as Russia or China?

No, because Russia often has military assets and troops in Central and South America. They are also looking into opening bases in Cuba, Venezuela and elsewhere in the region. At least, as of now, I dont know of any plans to annex parts of Latin America and pretend they have always been the 51st state.

&gt; Your second point I frankly do not get. *Are you seriously arguing that the differences in the testosterone levels and the brain structures justify the remaining inequalities in the social, legal and economical workings of our seemingly egalitarian societies?* Note that I'm not disputing the biological differences, just your implications about them.

Depends on what you mean by justify. Again, I made no positive claims about the inference of the studies I mentioned; which are a drop in the bucket of literature parroting the same point.

--

If by justify you mean expect, then yes, I would expect there to be some differences in career field, consideration, incarceration, and so on. If you mean, should we then not work to improve the status of women? I would answer, as the above data set shows, that you are unnecessarily limiting the question. *We should provide everyone the opportunities they need or want and better enable all peoples to achieve their dreams, of course!* But should we expect parity? No. Not only is that foolish but it delves into trying to engineer parity, or society, in which a way that doesn't work. 

--

Since the 60s-70s we've routinely focused on the problems of women, and young girls. And we've made great progress! That much I am extremely happy about. But in doing so we've forgotten about our boys and allowed them to very much so fall by the way-side in different ways.

They don't know what position in the commission they are going to have before they negotiate, how is that the Conservative's fault? Then that leaves the other 26 ordinary commission positions, which you then have absolutely 0 say in the person who gets it, so by design any one country will only ever get the ability to indirectly influence one out of the 27 commission areas.

&gt; I honestly do not know what you mean. I mean it is natural in national democracies that leader of largest party(coalition,voting block) get highest job position.

Except he isn't the leader of the EPP, that is [Joseph Daul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Daul). Juncker went pretty much straight from being the PM of Luxembourg to the EPP Spitzenkandidat just before the election. Oh, and as an aside, [the EPP got 29.43% of the seats on a 42.54% turnout, not exactly a firm mandate even if you do consider the system working as intended](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2014-results/en/election-results-2014.html)

Ask yourself this. Are there any mechanisms in place where Juncker, as the European Commission president is going to be held accountable by the electorate of Europe for his actions at an election?

Also there are two equalities:
The equality of chance and the equality of outcome. Most times those are not the same, which means you can give everyone the equal chance but the outcome will not be equal. 

For example you won't find many women in technical jobs because often they aren't interested. So is it now bad that not many women are interested? 

One problem with the equality of outcome is the rigging of fair competition in education and different jobs. Should a person be allowed to university to study medicine only because she is a woman and would have passed the test if she was a man?

Bien sûr, cette vision est plus intellectuelle qu'historique, et n'engage que son auteur. 

Le mot ""croisade"" n'a été utilisé qu'après la fin de ces guerres en Palestine. Les croisés parlaient à l'époque de ""pèlerinage"", tout en étant bien conscient qu'un pèlerinage ne s'effectue habituellement pas avec une épée et une armure. 

Les croisés sont souvent animés par la foi, par la nécessité de défendre la chrétienté et le tombeau du Christ. Cela n'empêche pas la première Croisade d'être lancée pour des raisons très prosaïques, relevant davantage de la géopolitique que d'un simple fanatisme religieux. 

Selon les besoins, selon qu'on veuille minimiser ou maximiser l'importance de la religion dans ces conflits, on a pu présenter les croisés comme des fanatiques voulant exterminer l'infidèle jusqu'au dernier, ou comme de simples colons recherchant avant tout le pouvoir et la richesse. Ces deux visions sont très réductrices.

La réalité historique se situe quelque part entre les deux, avec une religion qui permet d'apporter une cohésion et une motivation à des armées européennes, mais avec toutefois des enjeux de pouvoir qui vont prendre de plus en plus d'importance au fil des différentes croisades, les guerres saintes se résumant finalement à défendre ou reprendre les territoires conquis.",0,1414449292,null,0,false,0,cllkmcq,t3_2kg4wj,t1_cllkmcq,t1_cllfqnn,null,1426319385,5,false,france,t5_2qhjz,5

Do you mean that it's weird that those countries are not higher, as a percent of their GDP? After all, normalising for population, their economies are larger and contribution to the EU budget is, for a large part, predicated on a share of GNI. The implication must be that they have more money spent in them by the EU, per capita, than the UK does since their gross contributions should be, on average, larger. 

Anyway, the UK has a markedly lower GNI per capita than all those countries which have higher per capita contributions to the EU. It would seem somewhat fair that the UK lies where it does in the per-capita rankings. 

Some statistics on the UK Correction aka Thatcher Bonus. The correction was worth EUR 3.81 Billion in 2012. [source, page 31.](http://ec.europa.eu/budget/financialreport/2012/pdf/financialreport-2012_en.pdf)

Adding that to its current net contribution, EUR 7.37b, the UK would leap frog France to become the second largest net contributor at -11.18B, leaving France behind at -8.31B but Germany ahead at -11.95B. Of course, the UK Correction is borne by the other member states so Germany's and France's net contributions would actually shrink. I can't find the data for 2012, but if 2011 were indicative, Germany's contribution to the UK rebate was around 0.2B and France's was around 1B. [source](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/22/eu-budget-spending-contributions-european-union)

Per capita, and not adjusting the figures for Denmark and Swede's UK correction contributions, and with a 2012 population of 62.8m, the UK would have been the third largest contributor at EUR 178 per capita. 

As a percentage of GNI, assuming BIP means GNI (the figure is worked out of of theirs), the UK's un-corrected contribution would have been (11.18*100/(7.37/0.4*100)) 0.61%. That is by far the largest contribution of any member state, despite the UK being a relatively poor member state. 

In other words, the UK correction was merited then, and is still merited now, on that basis that it's unjust to ask a relatively poor country to subsidise one which is relatively rich. 

Regarding why Sweden is at the top of per-capita contributions, it should be near the top due to its relative wealth. Denmark and Luxembourg should be higher, all else being equal, but I'd hazard a guess that Denmark's relatively large agricultural sector inflates CAP payments and, similarly, many EU headquarters being based in Luxembourg likewise inflate the value of EU spending there.

- Supporting workers' rights by encouraging the formation of cooperatives, providing incentives for companies to raise wages above inflation, and raising the top rate of the tax, whilst closing loopholes.

- Encouraging the public ownership and operation of public transport, preventing fares from rising above inflation, integrating fares for rail, bus and tram services, expanding north-south rail services, and limiting inter-city flights where travel by rail is a possibility.

- Committing to reducing military spending by £5 billion year on year, withdrawing British forces in Germany, assisting charities set up to help return military personnel to civilian life, ensuring that personnel made redundant will be found alternative employment, and scrapping Trident.

- Utilising the National Drugs Board to aid in the decriminalisation and potential legalisation of currently prohibited substances.
Establishing a cross-party board to manage the devolution of powers to regional assemblies, devolved parliaments, and greater powers for councils.

- Ending the bedroom tax, introduce a living wage certificate, reverse NHS privatisation and prohibit PFIs whilst still reforming the system to adequately cope with the aging population, help people on benefits get back to work via a work program, and strengthen the cradle to grave ethos of the welfare state.

- Promoting a shift to renewables whilst commissioning new nuclear power stations, opposing hydraulic fracturing, handing the ownership of water boards to public bodies, regulating the energy industry, and setting up energy boards to manage, deliver, and regulate energy on a regional basis.",0,1414450205,null,0,false,0,clll366,t3_2kid5d,t1_clll366,t3_2kid5d,null,1426319167,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3
false,kayrizzma,TEXT,Dortmund,"unitymedia costumer here. had simillar problems this summer, lasted about 4-6 weeks. maybe i can shed some light. maybe, in your case, it's something completey different.

in my case, the ipv4 part of the dual-stack-lite technology unitymedia uses most-likely caused problems. unitymedia (and kabeldeutschland) have to use this because native ipv4-adresses are running low and they can not get new ones. instead they get you to use native ipv6-adresses and connect you via this technology to ipv4-adresses. don't ask my about specific information, i don't know. check wiki ;)

the problem in my neighbourhood was that unitymedia got too many new costumers and the hub that bundles all connections in my area couldn't handle the traffic in peak times. result: low incomming speeds and high ms. can't tell you for sure because support hotline wouldn't tell me, but technicans they send told me, simplified, it had to be the case. 

i assume um had to upgrade hardware parts. reading other forums it seems i was not the only one having trouble and there still are a lot of people complaining about the same symptons you and me had, or still have.

unfortunately there was nothing i could do - and if you have the same problem i assume there won't be much you can do. except annoying the costumer service. over and over. 

what you can do:

* restart your cable modem before you contact costumer service. is there a special number for tech-problems? (usually 24/7)
* document 'official' speedtests in form of screenshots and date/time. i don't know about KD speedtests, google it or just ask one of the call agents. just in case.
* make sure you call when you have the problem. try to set a time-frame where you have problems. in my case, i had the connection problems between 5pm and about 1am. i called in between and asked them specifially to check the connection. support saw the problems, asked me to check the speedtest and then verified everything i already told them.
* ask for a tech guy to be send over to your house/ complex to check the equipment. maybe the problem is there. ask them to come in the timeframe you have problems.
* have the tech guy describe the problem to you, verifiy it again and report it back.

after all, the tech guy couldn't do much, but he reported back and somehow, magically, over a few weeks the problems became less and less.

--

I've attended university; both in humanities and natural sciences. My critique was of sociology, especially as it pertains to gender studies. 

--

&gt; For one thing, you seem to be under the impression that peer review isn't an integral part of the humanities, or that the natural sciences aren't part of the discourse.


Again, not of humanities, but of gender studies; where feminist theory calls home. Of which there have been critiques, using the feminist theory lens, on peer-review and attempts to circumvent it. Further as shown above the arguments lack basis in our understanding of natural science and actually run in opposition to it.

&gt; And ""fervent""? You're the one with the shouting match and the personal attacks, buddy.


Yes fervent. An ad hominem attack is an argument that rests upon the vitriolic lambasting of a person's arguments by means of pejoratives. That is to say it tacitly distinguishes its-self from properly used terminology used in addition to criticism.

I think you know what I mean by that! Granted, it has 10 times the area of Hamburg if my memory serves me right.

&gt;The Community of Madrid is an autonomous region within Spain with 6.5 millions of inhabitants, includes a mountain range and rural areas.
The Municipality of Madrid is a urban area with 3.2 Millions of inhabitants.

Mhmm.

&gt;All the region is a province also and the functions of the provincial council are asumed by the metropolitan government.

Indeed. i.e. there is no provincial-level government as I said.

&gt;That's about it. All Spain is divided in 17 autonomous regions and 50 provinces. The provinces were created at 1833 and the autonomous regions between 1978 and 1983. The centralist would like to see the autonomous regions absorbed by the central government leaving only the provinces and some people like me would like to see the provinces be absorbed the autonomous region.

I do have an understanding of Spanish geopolitics but thanks! :)

It strikes me that the Valencian community is a particularly corrupt region - is there any truth to that or is it just a spate of recent high profile reporting?

Consiglio a chiunque faccia il barrel roll oculare ogni volta che si critica l'Unione di guardarsi l'ordinamento della stessa e poi di non ridere di gusto nel vedere come un sistema così assurdo sia ancora in piedi. Essenzialmente, come ha detto il leader dei Verdi tedeschi, la Merkel anestetizza il pubblico, altrimenti non mi spiego come una semplice azione politica neanche tanto conflittuale o antagonista sembra diventi un atto fedifrago di monumentali proporzioni che deve essere punito con una veloce e brutale *strafexpedition*. Per quanto Renzi mi ispiri poco, Hollande è un'ameba che occupa aria e volume, assolutamente incapace di opporsi alla politica economica suicida della Germania, che ormai ha 0% motivi economici e 100% motivi velatamente razzisti del suo elettorato (muh germoney going to lazy southern european countries). Se pensi che sia stata una mossa scorretta e cattiva, renditi conto che sarebbe assoluta prassi politica in QUALSIASI paese del mondo, e se non ti sembra così ti dovresti domandare:

* Perchè io posso solo eleggere un organo legislativo che NON ha iniziativa di legislazione, che è forse la cosa più scema mai vista?
* Com'è che adesso fare politica è diventato vietato? O meglio, fare politica di opposizione quando si è alla guida della coalizione parlamentare di opposizione?

Dal 2008 l'UE non è un esperimento ambizioso. E' un circo in cui regna sovrana la narcolessia di Merkel che in qualche maniera ha convinto ogni moderato d'Europa che nell'UE la politica significa rimanere in silenzio mentre la Commissione e il Consiglio fanno il loro lavoro.

And as I explained before, that's a direct consequence of people unfit to perform their jobs, not of multiculturalism. Multiculturalism doesn't make people afraid, people make themselves irrationally afraid, and they are responsible for their own decisions. The same way that the gender egalitarian movement isn't responsible for people afraid to make certain decisions regarding women in fear of being seen as misogynistic.

&gt; the reality is that respect for other cultures results in reluctance to interfere with them

That is just false. I live in Spain, which is a multicultural place in many aspects; there are several native cultures (some dominant, some in the minority, depending on the area), and there are also multiple non-native minorities who have become increasingly relevant in the later decades due to immigration. Nevertheless, police isn't reluctant at all to enforce the law regardless of the suspects being from different backgrounds than themselves; if they did, they would be considered at fault (just like the British agents who refused to do it are considered now).

&gt; In exactly the same way that other nasty practices like female genital mutilation are quietly tolerated. The lefties who work in social services and government are more terrified of being accused of racism than they are about hundreds of thousands of British born girls being mutilated. Same goes for arranged marriage. They turn a blind eye.

We must live in parallel realities, because the left (a political view which is often predominant in gender egalitarian movements) is more often than not the first one to denounce and stand against those practices.

There is true. There is high profile reporting because there is high profile corruption. Everywhere in Spain the city halls hire irregularly, there is bribes around the public works and some low profile corruption like regional presidents hiring their children, or a personal chef like advisors. 

The key is our extremely corrupt provincial councils and regional government. Two decades in the hands of the same people openly corrupt since the first day getting better electoral results election after election(well they are in free fall now). Usually the city halls are the most corrupt administrations. The guy that won the lottery 8 times, Terra Mitica, the city of the light, the Formula one, the corrupt visit of the Pope, the looting of the public TV with 1,200 employees that nobody knew that were doing, the highway to nowhere(Casinos, 2,800 inhabitants), Ciegsa(the mixed society for building public schools without applying the public works laws), the IVEX affair, The new Football stadium, Brugal(Garbage picking in Alicante), illegal funding of electoral campaign...

And I could continue hours. We have had everything except the fraudulent collective employment regulations of Andalusia, here people that never worked in a company got full pensions as part of the process, asking for it to valid and not valid employment regulations. You can name it if there is been a corruption affair Valencia has participated/leaded or had its own version(except this one).

The last two decades the corruption has been spectacular and we have fallen from 105% of the average GDP per capita to 90%. However, we have growth in population more than anybody(thanks to the biggest construction bubble) and we were around 100% at 2007. We also have the highest regional debt as percentadge of the GDP.


EDIT: A point our local administration is more normal all the corruptest city halls are at Andalusia or Galicia. With the provinces of Cadiz and Malaga. From Marbella to  Jerez including Estepona... There is a big mess of illegal housing, illegal hotels, fake enterprises and rampant local corruption as anywhere else. But a regional administrations we win/lose.

To summarise the main points of the manifesto(Though no summary will do as well as reading the thing itself);

1. Various wage and workplace democracy reforms

2. An expansion of social services for things such as healthcare and social housing as well as various reforms communalising the management of such services

3. Green Energy initiatives, primarily the expansion of Nuclear Energy

4. Abolition of Monarchy and all related and similar institutions, such as the House of Lords

5. Devolution and Federalisation of powers

6. Formation of an upper house comprised of Syndicates/Trade Unions.

7. Reindustrialising the UK in a high-tech and efficient manner

8. Anti-Interventionism, Nuclear Disarmament and withdrawl from NATO in order to pursue these aims

9. Reforming the Education System using new methods that cater much more to the individual rather than meeting systemic quotas as well as a communalisation of the system

10. Increasing scientific research to 1.5% of GDP

11. The weakening of the powers of unaccountable secret services(MI5/6) and bureaucracies and reigning in the infringements upon the privacy of the people

12. Increasing cooperation with organisations like the UN and Interpol in order to foster better conditions for international security

13. Relaxing gun laws and advancing the Right to Bear Arms with trained people's militias intended to keep the government in check 

14. As a result of our anti-militarist stance, the UK's standing army would be dramatically reduced and replaced with a more Swiss-like system of well trained reservist populations.

Wenn eine Leitstelle einer Gemeinde/Kreises/Stadt mit solch einem Alarmstichwort wie ""Reaktorstörfall"" konfrontiert wird, und die Erkundermannschaften positive Messergebnisse zurückfunken, kann man sich darauf verlassen, dass die Bürgermeister sich zwar mit ihren ""Vorgesetzten"" im Innenministerium des Landes absprechen, aber bei diesem Anlass wohl auch selbst tätig werden (z.B. [hierdurch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ssf7jIbF3fw)). Feuerwehrangehörige oder Zivilisten mit entsprechenden Messgeräten werden sofort über Soziale Netzwerke Panik verbreiten. 10 Minuten nach der ersten Erfassung von positiven Messergebnissen weiß die ganze Republik Bescheid und Gemeinden und Länder fangen an Freestyle ihre Bevölkerung zu warnen und Maßnahmen einzuleiten. Das Chaos wird perfekt sein, aber wir werden es alle mitbekommen. Sämtliche ABC-Züge in Deutschland werden alarmiert. Das TV-Programm wird auf allen Sendern sofort unterbrochen. Sirenen ertönen.

No governmental authority has the title of ""Censor"", for a start.

Censorship normally means that a producer of some cultural good has to show his creation before a censor or a censor committee to get approval. 25 years ago you find such things in Germany, in the GDR.

However, if you see that censorship isn't to be defined that way, then the US is directly and indirectly censoring many things. Companies like eBay (in the form of PayPal) tried to ""censor"" the sellings of cuban cigar from German web shops. Despite the fact that PayPal Europe is the legal partner, and this is a register bank in Luxembourg, so no US laws apply.

Or the TV show ""Sesame Street"" ... this is licensed to a german producer, which used the puppets and topics, but translates it into german context (e.g. language, german children songs, substitution of football+baseball with soccer, ...). Now, they made one show about the german Carnival. Small kids in Germany tend to play ""Cowboy und Indianer"". This is no offense here in Germany, especially not after the books of Karl May, which praised the personalities of indians. Now, the US license giver tried to censor this (not allowing to air it), because this (german language!) show no longer was in algin with the US social customs.

Mr. Berlusconi made it his personal mission to grab an agency which had already agreed to be established in Finland. Why do you Italians believe it was so important for Mr.Berlusconi to make his personal mission to grab that particular agency? 

Now that the European Food Safety Authority actually is in Italy it has become an inefficient expensive disgrace and we all EU citizens pay for it with our taxes. What are the current plans to make the agency more efficient and less costly to the EU taxpayers?

For example:
&gt; As the European Parliament’s budgetary control committee has pointed out, each  meeting  of the management board of the  European  Food  Safety Authority (EFSA) – whose work already overlaps with another EU agency and whose board only consists of 15 people – costs on average €92,630 (**€6,175 per member**), nearly three times higher than that of second most expensive decentralised Agency.

Also that particular agency seems to be completely unable to finance itself at all (how do I fund?) as full 100% of its funding is from the pockets of EU taxpayers: 
&gt; European Food Safety Agency (EFSA)  
Budget for 2012: €78.1m  
EU/member states contribution: €78.1m 

Which means the EU taxpayers are paying 100% of those most expensive triple cost board meetings taking place in Palermo, Italy - on average giving €6,175 to a board member who bothers to show up in there. 

The lax spending by the agency was deep enough of concern for the European Parliament to actually *suspend* the 2010 budgetary discharge for the agency. Now, *that* takes a lot.

Then it's supporters are either people who live far away from ""multicultural"" areas or outright delusional.

&gt;It's not about segregation, but about respecting people's decision of integrating as much (or as little) as they decide to, as long as they stay within the common legal framework.

If you have no respect for the culture to which you come then why on Earth should we accept you? I have no respect for people who come here with no intention to integrate. If you come here you come to live in one of the finest countries on Earth; universal healthcare, world famous policing and a generous welfare state. We guarantee your safety, health and to an extent well-being. In return you should have the common decency to participate in the society that was kind enough to let you come here rather than forming enclaves that displace natives and create ghettos.

&gt;A British Muslim who speaks Arabic most of the time and who practices the Ramadan is as British as a British Anglican who always speaks the Queen's English and who never misses his afternoon tea.

Bullshit. What makes somebody British is their acceptance of Western values and their loyalty to and respect for their fellow British citizens. Somebody who can't even be bothered to learn the language so they can interact with the people who make up most of this country is not somebody who respects their countrymen. Many Islamic values such as the subordination of women to their husbands and the promotion of religious imperialism are incompatible with being British. 

&gt;Both have the right to give the same name (if any) to their national identity, even if it means different things for both.

Nobody has the right to come here with a culture, language and set of values completely different to the majority and claim the nation as their own.

&gt; Ukraine, Russia and Europe’s bloody borders

&gt; If nations were again allowed to claim bits of their neighbours, it could convulse the continent 

&gt; Somebody born in Lviv in 1914, who died in 1992 and never moved out of the city, would have lived in five different countries during the course of a lifetime. In 1914, Lviv, then called Lemberg, was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire; by 1919 it was part of Poland and became Lwow; in 1941 it was occupied by the Germans; after 1945, the city was incorporated into the Soviet Union; and then in 1991 it became part of newly independent Ukraine.

&gt; Most of these changes were accompanied by warfare and bloodshed. So when it was suggested last week that, a few years ago, Russian president Vladimir Putin had proposed to Donald Tusk, then Polish prime minister, that Ukraine should be partitioned once again – with Russia claiming the eastern territories, and Poland Lviv and other parts of western Ukraine – there was an uproar. 

&gt; The details of the Putin-Tusk conversation – and indeed whether it ever really took place – were swiftly made murky by denials and clarifications on all sides. But the furore over the idea of a partition of Ukraine was still telling. For it revealed the deep and justified fear in Europe that national boundaries might shift once again, across the continent, with all the dangers that implies.

&gt; The dismemberment of Ukraine has, in a sense, already begun – with Russia’s forcible, but largely bloodless, annexation of Crimea this year. Since then thousands have died in fighting in the east of Ukraine, parts of which are now controlled by Russian-backed separatists. Even though Ukraine held elections at the weekend, the occupied parts of the country were unable to vote.

&gt; There are influential voices within the EU now urging the Ukrainians to “accept reality”. Rather than waging a draining and losing war to win back all of the east – then having to rebuild its devastated cities – they are advised to concentrate on making a success of the large majority of the country that they still control. They can deny the legality of Russian control. But they should accept its reality. 

&gt; That is the “realist” case for partition. But there are other influential voices who think that even tacitly accepting that Europe’s borders can once again be redrawn by military force would be a disastrous mistake. Carl Bildt, who has just stepped down as Sweden’s foreign minister, puts it bluntly: “The borders of Europe are more or less all drawn in blood through centuries of brutal conflict.” Allowing these borders to be redrawn, he thinks, would be an invitation “for the blood to start flowing again”.

&gt; The most obvious risk is that the Russian government would redeploy the argument that it used to justify the annexation of Crimea – that these are lands that are historically and culturally Russian – and use it to justify seizing the roughly one-quarter of Ukraine that the Kremlin now habitually calls “Novorossiya”. That part of the country includes all of the Ukrainian coastline, and losing it would in effect cripple Ukraine as a nation.

&gt; If the dismemberment of Ukraine began in earnest, others might be tempted to join in. Viktor Orban, the prime minister of Hungary, referred to in some other EU capitals as a “mini-Balkan Putin”, has made clear he regards the loss of two-thirds of Hungarian land after the first world war as a tragedy. Parts of historic Hungary now lie across the border in Ukraine – as well as in Slovakia, Serbia and Romania. If Ukraine really began to fall apart, even some Poles might be tempted by the idea of the return of Lviv. 

&gt; The German government, although often accused of being soft on Russia, is particularly adamant in arguing that all talk of redrawing borders within Europe must be banished. It was only in 1970 that Germany itself dropped all claims to the lands it had lost to Poland and Russia after the second world war. Some of these regions were at least as central to German culture as Crimea is to Russia. The area that is now the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, for example, was once Königsberg – capital of Prussia and home of the great German philosopher, Immanuel Kant.

&gt; It was Kant who argued that the morality of an action can be judged by what would happen if it became “a universal law”. Or to put it another way: “What if everybody did that?” That rule explains why an apparently pragmatic acceptance of Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine contains so many dangers. If Europe once again allowed countries to start claiming bits of their neighbours’ territory – on historic or ethnic grounds – the process could convulse the continent. 

&gt; The Russians argue that it is actually the west that started this dangerous process with Nato’s intervention in the Kosovo war of 1999, and the subsequent recognition in 2008 of Kosovo as an independent state. That process remains controversial, even within the EU. But Kosovo, unlike Crimea, was not incorporated into a neighbouring country. It was a province of the former Yugoslavia that sought independence. Within that process, the border between Serbia and Kosovo remained unaltered. The Kosovo war also took place in the context of the many years of fighting that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia. 

&gt; However, the Balkan wars of the 1990s are relevant to Ukraine in one sense. They revealed how much blood can flow once Europe’s borders begin to crumble. ",0,1414456242,null,0,false,0,cllo9xm,t3_2kidev,t1_cllo9xm,t1_cllmkjy,null,1426317610,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

If that is what Canadians wanted that would be their problem. It would be very likely the educated people would leave to the US anyway in a scenario like that so it would be their loss. That is what is happening with Russia and Venezuela now (not just the US, but elsewhere. Most Canadians would likely move to the US due to proximity). Someone just posted an article about venture capitalists leaving Russia for the US. Cant say Russia's short shortsightedness is a bad thing for the US, although it is detrimental for Russians. The Ruble has lost roughly 30% against the dollar since January 1 which is really unfortunate for people who cant get their savings into an alternate currency or commodity. 

&gt;Fascinating, how come?

They value education. They are highly educated, and therefore highly rewarded. Also, many start companies. 25% of US tech an engineering companies have at least one immigrant founder. The number climbs to 44% if you look specifically at Silicon Valley. That is the same for the other highly paid Asian and African nationalities (and European for that mater, although obviously they are white). My largest group of friends came from the ex-USSR as refugees when they were kids. Getting an education is not an option. They all arrived poor, and the least successful is still earning well over the national average. A couple are incredibly successful. One of my friends from Ukraine recently bought a new F430, which is pretty surreal because I remember when him and his family were struggling growing up. 

I have heard the same thing time and time again. This Chinese girl I was hanging out with for a while was earning her Ph.D. She looked at schools in the US and Germany. She came to the US because, ""In Europe I'm Chinese first, a Ph.D. holder second. Here nobody cares that I am Chinese, I am just a Ph.D. holder."" I am currently seeing someone from Congo that almost went to school in France but decided on the US instead for similar reasons, and have a friend from Brazil that also looked at European schools. Despite the stereotypes on this sub about the US, many racial minorities earn *far* more than the white average which is commensurate with their education. The vast majority of companies are overly pragmatic. They want the person that will do the best job, not the one with the least amount of pigments in their skin. Women also earn more than men in several metro areas as well. 

&gt;Do the republicans know that?

They do now. They have backed off their anti-immigration and anti-same sex marriage stances because popular opinion makes supporting those a political loser. 

&gt;you just having right wing racist nutjobs promoted inside one of your main parties.

Sure, but again, its hard for them to win on that platform. You will find rural hillbillies can be racist, but that is less and less the case. My parents moved to a hick town of 5,000 and there are immigrant families from China, Vietnam, Arabs (Iraq, IIRC), India, and Mexico. Its *very* difficult to get away from immigrants. And they are all just as much part of the town as anyone else. So those racists can rally the vote from elderly people but it certainly is not the prevailing sentiment. I certainly would not say US elected officials are as racist as European ones. Even in ""enlightened"" Sweden their elected officials were filmed shouting racial slurs at minority passers by.

None of the above. Both myself and many of the people who I've talked about the topic with live in very multicultural places. We also value a rational approach to the topic, and consider ours as such. You should stop assuming that opinions different from yours are delusional or uninformed.

&gt; If you have no respect for the culture to which you come then why on Earth should we accept you? I have no respect for people who come here with no intention to integrate.

You are mistaking respect with cultural submission, and integration with assimilation into the dominant culture. If someone comes here and follows the law, that's in itself a manner of integration, and you don't have the right to ask any more than that from them (just as they don't from you); integrating further can yield some advantages for a person, but it's not their obligation. And don't forget that the majority of people in such minorities were born in the country just like you.

About respect, it means acceptance of the validity of other people's ways, whether you share them or not. Many people in minority cultures respect the dominant culture (even when they don't share it), and others (which we usually call extremists) don't; symmetrically, many people in the dominant culture respect minorities, and others don't.

&gt;  In return you should have the common decency to participate in the society that was kind enough to let you come here rather than forming enclaves that displace natives and create ghettos.

No. In return they have the exact same set of rights and duties that everybody else has. They don't ""displace"" people; they move into empty places of residence, like you, me or anyone else would. They tend to move into the same neighborhoods for economic reasons, and because being around people with cultural similarities reduces the negative impact of a change that is already overwhelming in many aspects. If I were compelled to suddenly move to the Middle East, I would also look for areas where the cultural similarities with my own were the biggest; and I would be fully within my right in doing so. If my Muslim neighbours felt uncomfortable with the number of atheists (even though law-abiding ones) living close to them and moved elsewhere, that would hardly be my fault.

&gt; What makes somebody British is their acceptance of Western values and their loyalty to and respect for their fellow British citizens.

That's your own personal concept of ""being British"". Other people's will differ.

&gt; Somebody who can't even be bothered to learn the language so they can interact with the people who make up most of this country is not somebody who respects their countrymen.

Learning English would be in their own benefit, yet they have the right to not do so (even though their children will as school is mandatory). It's perfectly possible to not speak English and still respect the rest of your countrymen, by accepting the validity of their ways. Or are you saying that in order to respect a minority one needs to learn their language and immerse oneself in its culture?

&gt; Many Islamic values such as the subordination of women to their husbands and the promotion of religious imperialism are incompatible with being British. 

Subordination of women and hate speech are usually against the law, so as we already established no one is asking you to respect individuals who do so. Many Muslim people disagree with those values, by the way, so if you generalise then that mistake is your responsibility.

&gt; Nobody has the right to come here with a culture, language and set of values completely different to the majority and claim the nation as their own. If you want to be British then I whole-heartedly support you but you must make the effort to learn the language and customs of the people who live here.

Well, tough luck, because they do have that right just as much as you do (and again, most of them were always in Britain, born and raised). If you want to be British (in a national-identity way) then you just have to follow your own concept of ""Britishness"". You don't have any more right to impose yours on other people, than they do to impose theirs on you.

From Mein Kampf

Fascists and Communist were ideological opposites before the Nazi Party. By just focusing on the economic aspect you are completely missing the rest of the picture. Conservatism and nationalism is right wing. By viewing political ideologies on a scale that only includes economic factors you are missing so much depth. Nationalism is rooted in right wing ideology. That is why literally no political scientist uses this scale. 

Even economically they were not on the left. The workers did not have the means of production. In fact Nazi economic policy was based around privatizing public industries.

&gt;[Nationalization was particularly important in the early 1930s in Germany.The state
took over a large industrial concern, large commercial banks, and other minor firms.
In the mid-1930s, the Nazi regime transferred public ownership to the private sector.
In doing so, they went against the mainstream trends in western capitalistic countries,
none of which systematically reprivatized firms during the 1930s. Privatization was
used as a political tool to enhance support for the government and for the Nazi Party.
In addition, growing financial restrictions because of the cost of the rearmament
programme provided additional motivations for privatization.](http://coreyrobin.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/bel-2010-nazi-privatizations1.pdf)

false,Reilly616,EURO,European Union,"Here it is in full in English:

&gt;World peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it.

&gt;The contribution which an organized and living Europe can bring to civilization is indispensable to the maintenance of peaceful relations. In taking upon herself for more than 20 years the role of champion of a united Europe, France has always had as her essential aim the service of peace. A united Europe was not achieved and we had war.

&gt;Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity. The coming together of the nations of Europe requires the elimination of the age-old opposition of France and Germany. Any action taken must in the first place concern these two countries.

&gt;With this aim in view, the French Government proposes that action be taken immediately on one limited but decisive point.

&gt;It proposes that Franco-German production of coal and steel as a whole be placed under a common High Authority, within the framework of an organization open to the participation of the other countries of Europe. The pooling of coal and steel production should immediately provide for the setting up of common foundations for economic development as a first step in the federation of Europe, and will change the destinies of those regions which have long been devoted to the manufacture of munitions of war, of which they have been the most constant victims.

&gt;The solidarity in production thus established will make it plain that any war between France and Germany becomes not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible. The setting up of this powerful productive unit, open to all countries willing to take part and bound ultimately to provide all the member countries with the basic elements of industrial production on the same terms, will lay a true foundation for their economic unification.

&gt;This production will be offered to the world as a whole without distinction or exception, with the aim of contributing to raising living standards and to promoting peaceful achievements. With increased resources Europe will be able to pursue the achievement of one of its essential tasks, namely, the development of the African continent. In this way, there will be realised simply and speedily that fusion of interest which is indispensable to the establishment of a common economic system; it may be the leaven from which may grow a wider and deeper community between countries long opposed to one another by sanguinary divisions.

&gt;By pooling basic production and by instituting a new High Authority, whose decisions will bind France, Germany and other member countries, this proposal will lead to the realization of the first concrete foundation of a European federation indispensable to the preservation of peace.

&gt;To promote the realization of the objectives defined, the French Government is ready to open negotiations on the following bases.

&gt;The task with which this common High Authority will be charged will be that of securing in the shortest possible time the modernization of production and the improvement of its quality; the supply of coal and steel on identical terms to the French and German markets, as well as to the markets of other member countries; the development in common of exports to other countries; the equalization and improvement of the living conditions of workers in these industries.

&gt;To achieve these objectives, starting from the very different conditions in which the production of member countries is at present situated, it is proposed that certain transitional measures should be instituted, such as the application of a production and investment plan, the establishment of compensating machinery for equating prices, and the creation of a restructuring fund to facilitate the rationalization of production. The movement of coal and steel between member countries will immediately be freed from all customs duty, and will not be affected by differential transport rates. Conditions will gradually be created which will spontaneously provide for the more rational distribution of production at the highest level of productivity.

&gt;In contrast to international cartels, which tend to impose restrictive practices on distribution and the exploitation of national markets, and to maintain high profits, the organization will ensure the fusion of markets and the expansion of production.

&gt;The essential principles and undertakings defined above will be the subject of a treaty signed between the States and submitted for the ratification of their parliaments. The negotiations required to settle details of applications will be undertaken with the help of an arbitrator appointed by common agreement. He will be entrusted with the task of seeing that the agreements reached conform with the principles laid down, and, in the event of a deadlock, he will decide what solution is to be adopted.

&gt;The common High Authority entrusted with the management of the scheme will be composed of independent persons appointed by the governments, giving equal representation. A chairman will be chosen by common agreement between the governments. The Authority's decisions will be enforceable in France, Germany and other member countries. Appropriate measures will be provided for means of appeal against the decisions of the Authority.

&gt;A representative of the United Nations will be accredited to the Authority, and will be instructed to make a public report to the United Nations twice yearly, giving an account of the working of the new organization, particularly as concerns the safeguarding of its objectives.

&gt;The institution of the High Authority will in no way prejudge the methods of ownership of enterprises. In the exercise of its functions, the common High Authority will take into account the powers conferred upon the International Ruhr Authority and the obligations of all kinds imposed upon Germany, so long as these remain in force.",0,1414461660,null,0,false,0,cllr8ls,t3_2khmqh,t1_cllr8ls,t1_cllm0md,null,1426316228,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Klappt ganz gut. Kleinstadt - zugegeben. Aber das Wissen das niemand ohne größeres Engagement eine Waffe bei sich tragen darf schätze ich doch - unterm Strich - als positiv ein. 

&gt; Das gilt in Deutschland entsprechend für Messer oder sonstige Waffen. Und es funktioniert trotzdem, oder?

Die Handlungsanweisungen sind andere. Die Prozedur ist eine andere. Im Kopf von einem deutschen Polizisten ist eine andere Bedrohungslage als im Kopf von einem U.S. Cop - und dementsprechend wird gehandelt. Falls du Nachrichten schaust...

Das ist eben die Law-and-Ordner Philosophie. Wenn es nur genug Abschreckung gibt, dann ist schon alles gut. Ich denke der Mensch ist komplexer und bei allen Möglichen Kriminellen Akten spielen viele Faktoren eine Rolle nur eben jeweils das Gesetz nicht. Wenn die Kriminellen in der Lage wären die kommende Strafe vernünftig einschätzen zu können, dann würden sie die Tat nicht begehen. Reale Zwänge und eben ein Mensch sein sprechen da eben eine andere Sprache. 

&gt; Wenn Gangster sich gegenseitig umbringen, ist das kein großer Verlust für die Gesellschaft, wie ich finde.

Oh doch. Wenn es da eine Subkultur gibt, die sich gegenseitig mit Waffen abknallt vor meiner Haustüre dann ist mir das tendenziell nicht egal. Zum einen rutschen da Leute hinein weil die Gangs bestimmte Gesellschaftliche Bereiche für sich in Anspruch nehmen, zum anderen ist es sinnloses Blutvergießen, dass niemanden hilft...

On ne sait rien du tout, d'ailleurs il n'y a strictement aucune preuve dans l'article. On a mille fois plus d'éléments qui montrent que Hollande est vendu au Qatar (voir le dernier livre de Péant d'ailleurs) et aux États-Unis. Que Sarkozy était bien plus vendu à Poutine (tiens les Mistral, c'est pas MLP qui les as vendus, les réunions accords et preuves d'amitié, tu en as pour Sarko, pas pour MLP).

Bref, la paille et la poutre.

&gt;comme le fut Pétain à Hitler

Pff. C'est complètement faux et c'est prouvé. Les archives nazies sont au contraires pleines de mentions où les dirigeants nazis ne se font aucune illusion sur la profonde aversion de Pétain pour les boches. On a de la même manière d'innombrables témoignages de proches de Pétain qui le relatent. Tout a été public et annoté lors du procès Pétain. Je vais me contenter de citer la déclaration de l'ambassadeur de Suisse, M. Stucki, lors du procès :

*Au cours des quatre années et plus de ma résidence à Vichy, j'ai rencontré très fréquemment le Maréchal Pétain. Nous nous entretînmes souvent du problème de la collaboration franco-allemande. Le Maréchal Pétain manifesta toujours à l'endroit des Allemands une grande aversion, voire des sentiments de haine marquée. Souvent, il me déclarait à peu près ceci : La France est battue ; les Allemands sont, pour le moment, Seigneurs tout-puissants dans notre pays. Il faut nous accorder avec eux d'une manière ou d'une autre ; cela est bien amer et difficile, mais c'est nécessaire s'il faut sauver la France pour un avenir meilleur. J'estime de mon devoir de rester dans le pays et d'atténuer par ma présence, dans la mesure du possible, les souffrances de la France. - Je n'ai jamais eu l'impression que le Maréchal Pétain, au contraire de certains autres Français, ait jamais sérieusement cru en une collaboration durable et profonde avec l'Allemagne. Je sais, d'après de nombreuses remarques de diplomates et d'officiers allemands, que l'on ne se faisait point d'illusions, en Allemagne, sur les véritables sentiments et intentions du Maréchal, qu'on ne lui accordait aucune confiance et qu'à toute occasion, on essayait de réduire ses pouvoirs et son influence et qu'il était étroitement surveillé.*

On a aussi une trace de tous les refus de Pétain, que ce soit sur l'étoile jaune ou sur l'occupation de l'Afrique du Nord par l'Allemagne. Refus prononcés à demi-mots, comme s'il croyait que les nazis finiraient de toute façon par s'imposer.

Not at all. They would cost less.

&gt;I think most of France's exports don't leave the continent.

About 40% leave the EU.

&gt;What? Explicitly what do you mean, in practice.

In practice French exports increase more than German exports when the currency depreciates, at the same time French imports decrease more than German imports. On the other hand, French exports are hurt a lot more than Germany's when the currency rises.

France's median non-price positioning means that it must act on both price and non-price competitiveness. You only talk about non price competitiveness, I talk about both.

&gt;THe point is those people want iphones, if iphones become to expensive they will buy second hand iphones, they will not console themselves with alcatels.

Not all production is similar to iphones. In fact a majority of products have substitutes and that's where price counts.

&gt;Do I need to explain what a sorry industry it, it is higly volatile, it creates low end seasonal jobs and it has no economic ramifications.

Lol. You obviously don't know anything about tourism in France. It's not comparable to tourism in Spain.

http://www.entreprises.gouv.fr/files/files/directions_services/etudes-et-statistiques/stats-tourisme/chiffres-cles/chiffres_cles13_gb.pdf

&gt;It's a industry even grecce realised is pathetic to create a budged out of and you want to become poorer just so you can compete with grecce or portugal. Sorry but that is insane.

Sorry but you don't know shit about tourism.

&gt;You know what will stop foreigners in their tracks, loosing 10% of the value in all their foreign assets.

Perspective of growth is more important. Again just look at the UK who had a 25% depreciation in 2008, and look at the situation now :

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/10978395/Foreign-investment-into-UK-hits-record-as-15bn-of-UK-infrastructure-goes-up-for-sale.html

That just proves you so wrong.

&gt;No, it just kicks the bucket down the road, it makes credit harder to get and it focuses your efforts on the wrong issues, you need to become taiwan not Greece. Even greece is tired of being greece.

It's the opposite. And Greece is fucked partly because it's still in the eurozone when its economy does not allow it.

&gt;when? what are you talking about?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling#Current_exchange_value

Following the global financial crisis in late 2008, however, the pound has since depreciated at one of the fastest rates in history, reaching $1.38 per £1 on 23 January 2009 and falling below €1.25 against the euro in April 2008. A further decline occurred during the remainder of 2008, most dramatically on 29 December when its euro rate hit an all-time low at €1.0219, while its US dollar rate depreciated.

&gt;That doesn't matter if the customer wants a iphone, the cheese part was sarcastic, you preduce high end telecomunication and machinery and pharmaceuticals mostly, but those are still not iphones.

Yeah because people only buy iphones.

&gt;People buy what they buy because they want those specific products, they won't buy french and they will not buy up the excees production that exporters didn't manage to sell.

Wrong. Product substitution is a thing...

&gt;You really don't get it do you.

You really don't get it do you.

&gt;Your 2000 euros won't be worth 2000 euros after the depreciation

Yeah that's the point, genius.

&gt;and the added systemic shock would only upset the economy more than negesary

And the sky will rain blood and acid.

It's the opposite, it has been done numerous times in the past. Most of monetary unions have died with no problem. There has been countless devaluations. We know the effects and they are positive.

&gt;If you would ONLY reduce wages by 10 % the rest of the system would be fine. Now the idea is retarded as lower wages don't negesaraly mean more jobs, but it's still more reasonable than a depreciation.

That's what is done in Spain and Greece. Brillant.

&gt;yes, and yes...look at how specialised both of them are compared to france, both in product and in markets.

http://www.jetro.go.jp/switzerland/relations/tradesj.html

You're wrong. They are not isolated at all.

&gt;Exiting the EU does not make you switzerland, being switzerland makes you switzerland, and they would be fine even in the EU.

No kidding. I was refuting you ""isolation"" point.

&gt;So does adding VAT on top of your cost make your prices more competitive?

No. I'm not talking about VAT.

&gt;it means your population is not increasing

Yes it is.

&gt;you just need to make young people enter more productive sectors and not work in the same jobs their parents work in.

And depreciation helps having more productive sectors.

&gt;YES YOU ARE, stop being a idiot

Now compare French productivity with UK's,  Germany's or even Switzerland's productivity. You're just picking up data without looking at what it means.

&gt;Goverments do 2 things [...] in the next 40 years)

Agreed.

&gt;I see only one side with a different degree of reluctance.

For the war in Irak we clearly had countries opposing the war and others supporting it. For Ukraine we have countries opposing the sanctions and other supporting them.

&gt;I am arguing, that non residents that are repeat offenders get more severe punishiment and can be banned from entering the country for a certain period of time. Our criminals prefer to do it there because your police is weak and the rewards and bigger than ours. They don't dare pull that shit in hungary or austria, because they know that breaking the law hurts.

I agree but was not talking about that.

&gt;Pick one(other than tourism), and be great at it. That is the whole point of a specialised economy.

Yeah. ""Be great"". What a plan. Like no one is going to compete. Oh wait, every country does that.

In order to ""be great"" we have to use all means available, including currency. The US and UK do it, we have to use it as well.

&gt;Specialisation creates the economy of scale negesary to be globally competitive and the needs of your citizens are taken care of imports

Specialization isn't a thing that you declare.

&gt;in the case the national tax systems would be replaced by a german tax system

Changing the tax system without changing the economic structure is suicide. But so was having a common currency without fiscal harmonization and important transfers between rich and poor regions.

&gt;can you get away with that, god that would be amasing. 24 cents in tax and you get the rest under the table

That's currently a thing in Germany.

&gt;because that is the retard's solution, like cutting spending. It's stupid governing and reactionary policies, it is pointless.

From my perspective growing up with the horror genre, it is the movies that have changed.

It was a short time window (70s and early 80s) were they boomed. 

Maniac was apparently the most recent one to be banned this year, the remade one with Elijah Wood. 

&gt; A fun fact about banning via §131, the media of a particular release is banned, not the content itself 

Which made no difference in reality. If you would mailorder a ""banned"" movie, customs would check the title with their list and if it was on it, it was confiscated as evidence (rather fictious charges against the sender). No fucks given about which release it was. :-/

For the same reason the proponents of stronger copyright laws like to use expressions like ""intellectual property"" and ""theft"", because we all know that stealing is wrong, so the language used biases the debate.

Of course it won't be possible in certain circumstances, I was organized and I prepared food at a friend's that was hosting us in Bologna, brought bottle of water, food container, camera, sunglasses, mobile and a backpack. Picked up few places to visit, the rest is an adventure! 
One thing that i find ridiculous is to pay to get into a ""public"" toilet (in Florence it was €2), my ex couldn't resist but I'd never pay for peeing, it's just a f***ing right, not a service. 
Anyway there are so many ways to visit a place and pay less. For instance hostels, of course don't get shitty ones (read feedbacks online first), then it's fun and you meet lots of people. If you need your intimacy there are also rooms for 2 people. 
If you want to pay even less (almost free) get into couchsurfing, you need time to fill up your profile describing a bit of yourself(ves) and it's easier if you have references.. Basically you can find a place to stay to whom has a place to offer, also if they have time the host can show you the city. Also there are plenty of events depending on which city you are staying. Normally couchsurfing meetings are weekly or monthly. This is another way that I love to make new friends, and a great way to travel really cheap! 

If I'm visiting a place I never go to restaurants unless it's really cheap and they serve the food I like (basically impossible to find cause I don't eat plenty of stuff like gluten or diary). What I do is bringing my food container (preferably not a plastic one, stainless steel would be the best) and buy in supermarkets, or if you have a kitchen I enjoy myself cooking!

While I may not be a fan of PO on the national level, they're helping the president to change the city, alongside with a few councillors who were willing to leave PIS to help the president.

Why, you ask? Because when you're in PIS you are not allowed to vote with PO, like, never. Our local PIS is even worse.

Germany on the other hand was among the first to industrialize on mainland Europe, and Prussia in particular was among the first in the world with widespread literacy, enacting general education in the early 18th century.

So the formerly German part of Poland had a more than a century headstart in education, and half a century in industrialization. Prussia, the part of Germany that is now Polish, was also considered to be German homeland, while it was always conquered territory to the Russians.

Cool story, give an example of such a system.

&gt;To me this implies you haven't seen all of the potential problems

So what potential problem haven't I seen?


&gt;if you can't think of a better system.

That doesn't follow. At all.

&gt;How does a purely rational/scientific government come to a conclusion regarding ethics?

You are arguing from a flawed premise: That ethics are necessary. They aren't. Necessary are just an expression of incompetence to argue rationally. You are implying that ethics are necessary for productive decision making.

&gt;How is rationalism used as a basis for legality?

The same way it is used for everything else.

&gt;I think you understand my point quite well. 

No.

&gt;What one day can be considered sound science (by whatever subset of the scientific community is relevant - for there is no such thing as the scientific community) can be discredited the next.

Yes, science is a process that's improving over time. Once something can be discredited with evidence, the scientific community will usually quickly adapt (except you have ideologies repressing science... which is a problem with democracy).

&gt;Now imagine setting policies that sterilize, resettle, imprison, or execute people based on that science.

Yes. I imagine it. What now? What's your point?

&gt;Alright, please cite the relevant studies.

Source troll.

First cite relevant studies for every single of your claims and explicitly explain how the silly points you are trying to make against the system.

&gt;Well, I'm not. I support scientific rule

That's why I'm constantly asking what your point is.

&gt;I support scientific rule, but I don't support blind advocacy of the model. 

What else do you support?

&gt;I think there are many currently intractable problems that require some form of technological advancement or social progress to address. 

*What's your point?*

&gt;The largest challenge remains that of morals/ethics/justice and end goal. 

I don't agree that those are challenges. Policy and law shouldn't be based on morals and ethics. There is no need for those. Feel free to explain how those are necessary.

&gt; I could imagine a hybrid system being superior, or one where AI have decision making powers.

A hybrid system of what?

Feel free to provide the world with an AI.

You really don't seem to even remotely understand what I'm proposing. Your refusal to explain what your point is makes me assume that you don't even understand why you are arguing yourself.

Nothing you said contradicts anything I said. The points you try to make are not discrediting my system. They aren't pointing out problems that somehow threaten my system or make it a bad system. You can point out problems with any system. The difference between what I support and any existing system is that my system improves over time while all existing systems stay shit (e.g. democracy).

So, I really don't see what you are arguing here and I don't think you are either. All of your concerns are equally valid for *every other system*. Every single one.    
Your concerns only make sense if they would point out that the system I support is inferior to others. So, is there one? If you can come up with a better system: That's great! Amazing! Let's hear it.

Direct taxes are things like income tax, corporate tax etc. It currently raises a levy on the VAT for a portion of its budget though - I think nothing would legally change for the supreme court to complain about if it were charging a percentage of VAT (or fuel levies - that's why I choose the 3 examples I gave) instead, though not absolutely sure. And both their forms and levels are still bound by unanimity voting - EU institutions have no power to raise any own resources without prior governmental consent and hence control, though once agreed they are obligatory.

Now a fairer distribution of parliamentary seats would require treaty change (and agreed would be desirable), but interestingly it can get fairly normal with simply lowering the minimum from 6 to 3 (and I don't think its desirable to go any lower than that, just to enable a bit of a flavor of proportionality in the elections), even while keeping the principle of degressive proportionality. Principle which is not a compromise likely to easily change. 

The article linked argues how the constitutional court's judgement would have much less to stand on in such a case even in general.

What might help push it along, and make decision-making procedures on the EU level more efficient though, is if the supermajority requirements in the councul of ministers were also dropped. 

Soon they're to fall to 55% member states having at least 65% population - an old decision slow to take effect. Something like 50% with 50% (or less) of population concurrently with a more proportional parliament could restore political balance, while making laws pass the upper chamer more easily.

Not using the term biases the debate just as much. Call it what it is, even if it's loaded. Btw, I don't agree that censorship is always wrong, I just think it's too excessive when it comes to video games in Germany.

Saying that indexing a game isn't censoring it is weaseling out based on semantics in my opinion. Yes, technically it's still allowed to sell the game, but in praxis the game is gone from German shopping shelves. If you insist on such a narrow legal definition of Censorship, it doesn't fit into what a lot of oppressive regimes do either. Because more often than not such regimes don't outright ban any dissent but use various kinds of discrimination and chicanery to prevent it.

&gt;And indexed games never get ""seized"" in Germany.

That's just not true. [Dead Rising](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Rising#Indizierung_und_Beschlagnahme) got seized to name one example. It is now illegal to sell or import the game.

This system means there is little to no direct accountability. 

You vote for MEPs who directly approve or disapprove Commissioners by plenary vote. The EP should get more powers, but whenever that comes up some members states start whining about sovereignty. So how is that the EU's fault?

&gt;You can't get vote for/against an individual MEP because his party controls the regional lists. 

That's organized according to national rules, so don't blame the EU for something your state decides.

&gt;You do not vote for a Commission President

Neither do you vote for your PM. In most countries the exective power is appointed by the legislative body, and that's the way it should be IMO. There's no point in giving the executive power even more legitimacy, it would undermine the relative position of the legislative body and concentrate too much power in the hands of very few people. Separation of powers is important. (In addition, voting for the head of the executive power stimulates sterile party polarization, which makes it harder for new parties to arise in response to changing situations).

L'estetica di Milano non è assolutamente brutta. E' vero che a Milano non ci sono monumenti da vedere, ma l'architettura dei palazzi antichi è sempre molto elegante e coerente con l'ambiente circostante. Poi ci sono certi vicoletti di Brera o di Porta Genova che, a mio parere, caratterizzano molto quelle zone della città.

I trasporti sono efficientissimi e c'è una gran cultura del mezzo pubblico unitamente a quella del car sharing e del bike sharing. A differenza del romano tipo, il milanese tipo utilizza i mezzi pubblici assiduamente e ciò contribuisce alla creazione di una cultura della pubblica mobilità che invece manca nella ""capitale"".

Assolutamente in disaccordo sul fatto che Milano non sappia valorizzare ciò che ha . 

Dalle grandi manifestazioni alle piccole iniziative di quartiere si nota sempre una gran voglia di fare e di emergere. Spesso, a mio parere, anche troppa visto che si tende a pompare a mille qualsiasi evento.

Inoltre i milanesi partecipano sempre attivamente agli eventi culturali organizzati in città. Io, ad esempio, sono socoio FAI e ti posso dire che gli eventi organizzati dal FAI sono sempre molto affollati di milanesi di tutte le età e classi sociali. Ci sono addirittura famiglie con bambini. Agli occhi di un pugliese tutto ciò è molto strano, perché giù da me la domenica il pranzo dai nonni è sacro e inviolabile ed è impensabile passare la giornata domenicale con il proprio nucle famigliare a visitare questo o quel posto o a partecipare a questa o quella iniziativa.

Diciamo poi che c'è anche la Milano degli aperitivi tutte le sere e del tavolo in disco il sabato, però è solo una parte della città e, secondo me, si sbalgierebbe ad identificare tutta Milano solo per quella parte.

false,simonask,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; My critique was of sociology, especially as it pertains to gender studies.

Please be aware that 'sociology' means something slightly different across the Atlantic. Sociology in Continental Europe is a field that deals mostly with statistics and quantitative data processing, while North American sociology is much more focused on cultural studies, which in Europe is taken care of by fields such as, well, Cultural Studies, Ethnology and Anthropology. Both sides are informed by the other, but the focus is different. (Similarly, Anthropology in North America is much more focused on biological history, but it's a broad field everywhere.)

The reason I react to this is that your (un-)academic prejudice shines through, and it's not constructive if you want to have a debate.

&gt; Again, not of humanities, but of gender studies; where feminist theory calls home. Of which there have been critiques, using the feminist theory lens, on peer-review and attempts to circumvent it. Further as shown above the arguments lack basis in our understanding of natural science and actually run in opposition to it.

If you have any concrete criticisms of feminist critique in academic discourse, I'd be happy to weigh in, but so far you've presented nothing but baseless slander.

&gt; I used the word 'fervent' to denote the willingness to retreat to baseline feminist theory, not even look at the evidence, dismiss it out of hand, and go on to say it is wrong. That is text-book 'fervent'.

Asking ""what is this actually evidence for?"" is not dismissal or going on to say that it is wrong (which is explicitly what I did *not* do). It is rational scientific thinking. Feminist Critique as a whole is about examining and interrogating the assumptions and biases that lead to wrong and pseudo-scientific conclusions, and yes, this happens *all the time* in the natural sciences, particularly when scientists and media want the natural sciences to explain culture to them. Cultural practices get reified and promoted to natural phenomena, when in reality it is trivial to prove unequivocally that they are social constructs. One classic way to do that is to point to a culture where such conclusions *don't* hold, while its inhabitants share the biology of the rest of the human race.

Taking this one step further, there is a strong general trend for certain *themes* in cultural practices that get promoted to ""natural phenomena"": Those cultural practices that seem to perpetuate existing power structures in the cultural context in which the researcher making the naturalistic hypothesis is situated (and quite often while making a [Naturalistic Fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy) as well). Statements such as ""Men are naturally better equipped to hold power than women"" or ""Black people are naturally subservient"" or ""Homosexuals are neurotic"" are all inferences that have been made based on sound natural sciences, but don't hold in reality, because they are conclusions made on interpretations of scientific data that simply does not describe the things the people interpreting the data want it to.

Nobody is saying that biology can't play a role, or that all these things are anything but correlations. But if you want to follow the principles of sound logic, keep Occam's Razor in mind: The hypothesis with the fewest assumptions should at least be examined first.

Grammatical person | Number | Personal pronoun | Possessive pronoun/adjective | English equivalent

2nd (informal) | sing. | du | dein | your(s)

2nd (formal) | sing. &amp; pl. | Sie | Ihr | your(s)  

When the possessive ~~pronouns~~ adjectives precede nouns (attributive adjectives), they take endings based on the gender, number, and case of the noun they refer to as described [on this page](https://deutsch.lingolia.com/en/grammar/pronouns/possessive-pronouns). When they do not precede a noun ~~(predicative)~~, they ~~do~~ *may* not receive endings~~, just like adjectives~~. Note that this is also the difference in usage between English possessive forms like ""my"" (possessive adjective, always acts attributively) and ""mine"" (possessive pronoun, always acts predicatively). You say ""That is *my* cat"" (possessive adjective) but ""That cat is *mine*"" (possessive pronoun). Similarly, ""Das ist *meine* Katze"" (attributive adjective, therefore the ending must agree with ""Katze""'s gender, number, and case) but ""Die Katze ist *mein*"" ~~(predicative, so ""mein"" does not take any ending)~~. Hopefully ~~that makes sense~~ my edits haven't made this too confusing.  

Edit: I have been informed that when possessive pronouns precede nouns, they are actually [possessive *adjectives*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive_determiner), not pronouns, since pronouns *replace* nouns (and you'd think I'd never forget that after [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koZFca8AkT0)). I have edited the above paragraph accordingly.  
Apparently using an ending for ""mein"" as in ""Die Katze ist meine"" is more common than not using one, but such constructions are unusual enough that you probably don't need to worry about it.

no, they wouldn't, internally they would apear as if they cost the same, the revenue would only go up relatively. At the consumer side the price would be offset by added VAT and logistics cost.

&gt;On the other hand, French exports are hurt a lot more than Germany's when the currency rises.

why? Functionally why is france only negatively impacted by the euro. 

&gt;In fact a majority of products have substitutes and that's where price counts.

That is the think, they don't, most go for brands when it comes to higher end products, some are even fussy about low end products. Just having inported goods be more expensive is not enough.

&gt;You obviously don't know anything about tourism in France.

tourism is tourism, it's a opportunistic venture, you create no value, it is as flaky as entertainment, just more costly for the end user.

&gt;Perspective of growth is more important. Again just look at the UK who had a 25% depreciation in 2008, and look at the situation now :

I don't see anything about depreciation, I see a governmental development contracts offered by a traditionally very pro bussiness government. Now if you would end up paying 10% less for those contracts, I am sure those investors will run as soon as possible.

&gt; And Greece is fucked partly because it's still in the eurozone when its economy does not allow it.

It's economy allows it, it's political class and culture just don't make it easy. You will see a lot of this happening as time progresses, people/local governments / eu politicians  conflicts.

&gt;Following the global financial crisis in late 2008, however, the pound has since depreciated at one of the fastest rates in history, reaching $1.38 per £1 on 23 January 2009 and falling below €1.25 against the euro in April 2008. A further decline occurred during the remainder of 2008, most dramatically on 29 December when its euro rate hit an all-time low at €1.0219, while its US dollar rate depreciated.

Now I get it, you aren't suggesting volundatary depreciation, you are just arguing you get back a volatile exhcange rate, That is cool, it will only impact private assets, and if held back with an apropiate monetary policy you will addapt. However I need to mention that , relatively speaking, that just means it handled the shock worse than it's competitors(euro and dollar). http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=GBP&amp;to=XAU&amp;view=10Y It has been traditionally more volatile than both. And the UK's recovery has more to do with  the cuts and developement programs the goverment did combined with the massive amounts ob debt the bank of england absorbed. http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/17/uk-better-off-quantitative-easing Lowering their debt technically so they where able to borrow more to invest in the economy, without increasing taxes or lowering their credit rating.

&gt;Yeah because people only buy iphones.

kinda, that is the point I am trying to make.

&gt;Wrong. Product substitution is a thing...

A theoretical thing, In practice if it was realistic all the money large companies spend on marketing would be useless.

&gt;It's the opposite, it has been done numerous times in the past. Most of monetary unions have died with no problem. There has been countless devaluations. We know the effects and they are positive.

We know significantly more about currency than 100 years ago. And most devaluations are hard to control, once you are loose, your economy will set the currency, if labor happens to be less efficient, if you have a very protectionist policy or if you have high labor costs, that exchange rate will go down, and you will feel it. And just like stacks the lower it goes the higher the pressure. Now your exporters will rejoice, but any industry that relies on imports will crash. and then the sky will rip open and rain acid blood.

&gt;You're wrong. They are not isolated at all.

look at that nice break down per industry and per partners, compare the diversity of the swiss with that of austria(so you don't argue that france is bigger therefor more diverse)

&gt;And depreciation helps having more productive sectors.

no it doesn't

&gt;“The factors affecting labour productivity or the performance of individual work roles are of broadly the same type as those that affect the performance of manufacturing firms as a whole. They include: (1) physical-organic, location, and technological factors; (2) cultural belief-value and individual attitudinal, motivational and behavioural factors; (3) international influences – e.g. levels of innovativeness and efficiency on the part of the owners and managers of inward investing foreign companies; (4) managerial-organizational and wider economic and political-legal environments; (5) levels of flexibility in internal labour markets and the organization of work activities – e.g. the presence or absence of traditional craft demarcation lines and barriers to occupational entry; and (6) individual rewards and payment systems, and the effectiveness of personnel managers and others in recruiting, training, communicating with, and performance-motivating employees on the basis of pay and other incentives.

&gt;For Ukraine we have countries opposing the sanctions

&gt;I agree but was not talking about that.

To bad, criminality is criminality, it's not a immigration issue. Imigration is just a factor that needs to be taken into account sometimes.

&gt;Yeah. ""Be great"". What a plan. Like no one is going to compete. Oh wait, every country does that.

that is the whole fucking point of trade, you find your niche and then you thrive. General economies are good at self sufficiency but that mindset limits your focus and specialisation.

&gt;Changing the tax system without changing the economic structure is suicide.

It depends, I don't think even the germans would complain about lower taxes.

If you use torrent, emule and similar filesharing without a proxy and download/upload a movie of the last couple of years or a tv show you can wait a couple of month till you will get a letter from a lawyer almost guaranteed.

I have to correct the other commenters with the fact that the problem is only the upload. That used to be the case, but have been changed a couple of years ago. Now you also get problems for downloading, as long as it's from a so called ""offensichtlich rechtswidrige Quelle"" / ""obviously unlawful source"". Which means that if you download a movie for free which is currently in the cinema, you can get problems as well, since it had to be obvious to you that this can not be legal. If it is a well done website which would make you believe that it is legal and the movie there is older, you might successfully argue that you believed it to be legal.

Streaming is most probably legal, there is still some dispute about it between the legal profession but most signs right now lean towards it to be legal. This is only true however if you don't make a permanent copy, like DivX for example does automatically.

Megaupload &amp; Co are not legal by themselves, the thing about one-click hoster that it is pretty unlikely that you get caught if you only download.
For somebody to prosecute you for downloading, they would need your ip-adress, which only the hoster has. So the hoster must either give up your ip-adress,
which would be kind of suicide if it comes out because nobody would use that host, or the hoster must get prosecuted himself and then the prosecutors obtain that data.


The latter is not completly unrealistic actually, because it just happened. The german prosecutors obtained kinox.to and apparently there are a couple of hosters connected to this (apparently bitshare, freakshare, mygully, shared.sx). At least theoretically it is possible that the prosecuters obtain data from downloaders (if the people running the sites were dumb enough to save the ip-adresses) and / or use these hosters as a honey pot in the future, though both actions would be unprecedented in Germany. Normally, the prosecutors only go for the big fish, the cease-and-desist letters with the fines come from the media companies and they can't access this information directly. When the predecessor to kinox.to, kino.to got raided by the police and the people running got prosecuted, there was no news about anybody getting prosecuted but the people running it",0,1414486993,null,0,false,0,cllzsp7,t3_2khvfg,t1_cllzsp7,t3_2khvfg,null,1426312165,7,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,7

I've read in the thread that you've already booked your flights and hotel so I will skip that part, just on a passing note, if you are landing in Pisa the cheapest way to get to Florence is [by bus](http://www.terravision.eu/florence_pisa.html). Provided you've booked an hotel within the Viali di Circonvallazione belt (i.e. in the city center) you can probably avoid getting bus tickets and just walk everywhere you go, since the  historical center is not that big. On the other hand, if your hotel is not in the center, you should consider getting multiple-day tickets, here you can find [the fares](http://www.ataf.net/en/fares/tickets.aspx?idC=82&amp;LN=en-US). You should also keep in mind that buses generally don't run late at night, so that might be an issue, check a timetable to make sure.

There is a lot of stuff to do in Florence, and while almost every museum requires a ticket, they are not that pricey and if you are student and/or under 25 you are entitled to price reductions ut to 50% off (as an example, an Uffizi ticket runs from 6,50 to 11€ for a full price ticket and half of that for a reduced one). You can buy tickets online for some of the museums (Uffizi, Galleria dell'Accademia, Boboli garden and a few more) [here](http://www.firenzemusei.it/), altought the website design is really messy.  

As already stated somewhere else, you can probably get in a lot of churches for free, altought that kind of admission is usually reserved for cult occasions (e.g. mass). Santa Maria del Fiore (the Duomo) requires a ticket during normal ours and especially to get on top of the dome, but you might consider attending a 10:30 Sunday morning mass, in latin. You should also plan a visit to San Miniato al Monte, near Piazzale Michelangelo, which is probably one of the best viewpoints on the historical center. On a side note, if you happen to be still around in the middle of the night on a week day, the whole center is pretty empty at that time and it feels really different from the crowded day. Consider checking Piazza Duomo and the Uffizi.

Regarnding the places to eat I will just leave you a couple of notes on  cheap or off the path places.

The first is a small typical sandwich joint near piazza Santa Croce, [Lo Schiacciavino](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187895-d4830858-Reviews-Lo_SchiacciaVino-Florence_Tuscany.html), it's *really* cheap (approx. 8 € for a glass of wine and a focaccia) and makes for a fast and tasty meal. A similar one, albeit well known, is [All'Antico Vinaio](http://www.tripadvisor.it/Restaurant_Review-g187895-d1102253-Reviews-All_Antico_Vinaio-Florence_Tuscany.html) on via De' Neri, still cheap and a bit more crowded.

If you'd rather have a pizza, my favourite place is [da Gherardo](http://www.tripadvisor.it/Restaurant_Review-g187895-d3832392-Reviews-Da_Gherardo-Florence_Tuscany.html), in Borgo s. Frediano. The place s really small and you might have to sit on a table with some other people, but the pizza is pretty good and quite cheap. 

The last one is the bar on the top floor of the [Oblate Library](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187895-d2433470-Reviews-Caffetteria_delle_Oblate-Florence_Tuscany.html). It's a really quiet place, and despite the food not being great, makes up for it with a nice view on the Duomo and it's not pricey (you can have an aperitivo for around 8 euros). It's should be open until midnight from tuesday to saturday, but you'd better check that since I am not so sure.",0,1414487425,null,0,false,0,cllzvbh,t3_2kgwfp,t1_cllzvbh,t1_cll6t9y,null,1426312131,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

&gt;You're still assuming something I don't accept.

I'll give you something to think about, from Finnish perspective. Finnish girls outperformed the boys in all categories in the Pisa study (that is, reading, science, maths). This sparked a discussion here, if our education system is failing the boys, even if the gender differences were still minimal. But the studies that looked into the issue revealed something else: the teachers were actually favouring the boys, giving them better grades for less work, and one might argue that this perhaps even unintentionally caused them to be outperformed. 

But all that being said, we also have a disparity regarding the women and STEM fields in universities. And this is something that should be carefully studied, to understanding *why* that is.

&gt;Do you expect parity? That is to say is your goal, and do you expect, 50/50 distribution?

No, I don't. Even in a perfectly egalitarian society some disparity is to be expected. But as it is, we're still far from that.

Are not teenagers used to seeing much worse? Shouldn't there be an economically viable (for sellers) alternative for adults who want to buy the original games? Etc.

Pretending that this is somehow about the suppression of freedom of expression (which for some reason is something Americans quickly do, while in their own country it's a major scandal if a naked boob gets shown during Superbowl), and the poor Germans are censored by a repressive government, misses the point completely.

And *prohibition* of material for example because it glorifies Nazis or insults basic human dignity is a completely different thing. What would happen in America if a game was made that shows how the Klu Klux Klan tortures and burns black people? In all gory detail? Your own freedom of expression ends where it starts to infringe on the freedom of others. And that's a good thing, even if Americans see that differently.

false,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"How on earth am I exaggerating the 2011 numbers? The only time I used 2011 numbers in that entire post was as a quick-and-dirty method for divvying up who was contributing to the UK's 'Thatcher Bonus'. All the other figures were from 2012. There was no exaggeration of any number. That is what the UK would have contributed without the rebate, in 2012, the year which the figures you're linking to examines. 

I'm well aware that the funding for the EU doesn't lie directly on GDP per capita, but it's heavily funded based on a proportion of GNI, which is automatically tied to GNI per capita if you just take a percentage share out of it. Simplistically, what happens is the budget is decided, a percentage of each member states VAT is taken, customs duties are collected, and then the difference between what was collected and what will be required for the budget is paid for based on each member states GNI share of the EU's GNI. The latter 'correction' is far and away the biggest source of revenue. To a rough approximation, the per-capita payments in to the EU should roughly depend on GNI per capita. 

The only way one member state, then, should, with similar GNI per capitas, pay in more in net would be if they were receiving less out of the EU budget. 

In any case, as you say, it's a gamble then, for those states who pay more in. If the economic boost to their trade, and thus tax figures, is larger than their contribution to the EU then it will be a good idea to remain within the EU. That doesn't mean it's fair to make one member state pay for others disproportionately. There were three points I made in my comment, when it's boiled down. 

The first was that it's not weird that, normalised for size of economy, Netherlands and Belgium pay the same as the UK, as though the UK is slacking. It just means those countries receive more benefit, or perhaps enjoy a skewing based on being the collector of a lot of EU customs taxes. Not weird, kind of unfair on the UK actually, give it's relatively poorer. 

The second was that the UK correction is justified. When the burden per person of the corrected, and uncorrected, figure is looked at, British people would be huge net contributors, bigger than any except the very wealthy Sweden and Denmark. Corrected, countries with higher GNIs per capita all pay more in, per capita. I think that's quite just. Just because, as you say, it's a gamble, it doesn't mean you can't talk of the stake being just or unjust. 

Thirdly, the reason Sweden is at the top isn't borne out of altruism, it's there for the same reason that the Germany is where it is. A percentage of GNI is called upon to make up the budget difference, the budget difference is usually large in comparison to the total budget, so the size of GNI per capita is going to be a good predictor for location in the EU contributions per capita rankings. The reason Sweden leapfrogs Denmark and Luxembourg is that both benefit from EU funding (cap, or admin relatively speaking) more than Sweden, increasing the monies received side of the equation.

This is incorrect, and in fact the page you linked to shows the endings required by what you call ""predicative possessive pronouns"" (that page calles them ""independent possessive pronouns""). The example on that page is ""[Der Koffer] ist meiner.""

However, I have never heard a German ever say that: it's more usual to say, ""Er gehört mir"" or, more colloquially in at least some regions, ""Er ist mir.""

On a side note, it's more usual to talk of possessive *adjectives*, which are used attributively (""my"") and possessive *pronouns*, which are used independently (""mine""), and most grammar references will follow that convention. Possessive adjectives are declined like ""kein"", while possessive pronouns are declined like ""der"".

Well, it's complicated. The primary identity is still overwhelmingly the ethnic one, but there is also a regional Transylvanian one, mostly within the Romanian ethnicity. Of course, there are some, mostly Transylvanians, who greatly exaggerate the difference (think [along these lines](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwDrHqNZ9lo) :) ), andthere are some, mostly Southerners, who get angry whenever anybody mentions that there might be some differences.

Anyway, communism also did some leveling of the differences, and the Hungarians here are also more ""blakna"" than they'd like to admit :)

&gt;What is the main difference between the two candidates?

Main difference? The party supporting each. PSD, the center-left (so to speak), has always been strong in the Regat, while the right-wing parties (here, PDL, center-right) has always had an advantage in Transylvania.

You can see this Transylvanian anti-PSD sentiment in many presidential elections:

&gt; Jésus est mort en martyr après une vie de pauvreté, tandis que Mahomet est mort dans son lit après avoir tué ses opposants

Nous ne sommes même pas certains de la réalité historique de la vie de Jésus, encore moins des circonstances de sa mort. Les évangiles ont été écrits bien après, et peuvent difficilement être considérés comme une source impartiale.

Mais bon, si on va faire des comparaisons, l'Espagne musulmane a toléré des chrétiens et des juifs dans son sein pendant quatre siècles, même si c'était avec le statut de ""dhimmis"", tandis que l'Espagne chrétienne, après la reconquête, a bouté tout le monde dehors en quelques années.

Je ne vais certainement pas défendre l'Islam en tant que tel. Mais que toute religion, indépendamment de ces principes fondateurs, peut servir à manipuler le gens et à justifier la violence sans une séparation stricte d'Eglise (Mosquée, Temple, Sanctuaire...) et Etat est plus que prouvé par l'histoire et l'actualité.

Déjà merci de ce retour conséquent et sans langue de bois :p
Si j'ai bien compris j'arrive à résumer tes propos en 2 thèmes principaux :

* le fond, la vulgarisation, les explications. Je sais que de mon point de vue je dois faire un travail pour rendre abordable un sujet, j'avoue que je m'étais absolument pas posé la question pour le mot ""phase"". Après je dois être honnête je fais pas du Gulli, en 5 min je ne peux pas du tout remplacer des heures de cours même si je peux (et même dois par définition) faire un effort. 
Reste que ça doit pas gâcher le côté technique : mon but étant d'aborder des sujets de plus en plus profondément, et ça viendra avec de l'expérience et du recul de ma part :) Mais je prends note ! Dans la prochaine vidéo je vais devoir montrer des formules avec des exponentielles, le problème est que je n'ai pas le temps de redéfinir cette fonction, mais je vais devoir l'utiliser ! 
Le soucis se pose aussi quand Bruce d'epenser parle de champ quand il parle d'une force, ce sont des notions post BAC :p

* la forme, la façon de parler. Là je crois que c'est le manque d'assurance devant le micro (et la difficulté à imaginer la personne en face) car j'ai des facilités à l'oral et j'ai déjà travaillé avec des enfants à leur expliquer la science donc je pense que ça se réglera tout seul avec l'habitude. Par contre pour le texte il y a les sous titres de disponibles qui sont une retranscription de mes paroles si tu veux :)
Au final je sais qu'il y a des erreurs de syntaxe, j'ai un langage très parlé car j'improvise beaucoup : un texte écrit perd chez moi beaucoup de sa saveur (il suffit de voir la bande d'annonce héhé).
Mais je vais travailler ça.

En tout cas j'ai pigé : faut mettre des images plus grandes, ça on me le dit partout :)

Pour les accents c'est la police qui est comme ça, si je met un accent ça fait une petite lettre qui rend tout moche le reste, je vais me renseigner pour savoir si je peux la modifier.

Oddio, dipende dalla definizione di 'ottimo uomo politico'.

 Ottimo politico? Forse nel senso di Machiavelli; di sicuro ha fatto piu' danni della grandine.

Basically if you vote for individuals it is winner-takes-all, if you vote for party lists, that is proportional and from that viewpoint obviously better. But on the other hand, it would be good if politics would not be so strongly party focused. The issue with party lists is that it turns MPs into button pushers. They have no loyalty to the voter because nobody elected them directly. They are loyal to party leadership, because if they are 10th on the list they get in no matter what if they are 150th then not. So they are not real representatives of the people, only the party as a whole is. From this angle individual candidates are better. They are more directly loyal to voters and often voters should vote on them because they are personally OK and not because of what party they are members of.

In practice, this does not works. Even individual candidates are button pushers, no loyalty to voters, and they are 100% loyal to party lines. And voters elect them because of what party they are in and not due to their individual merits.

For this reason, individual representation does not work. So I would prefer proportional, as we cannot make the other work. But I would prefer much more if individual representation could work again somehow - that more people would think I vote for X because he is a cool guy and not because he is a member of this party or that. And the MP too would think like I do what is best for my district, not what my party line says.

Note that this happens for all subjunctions (at least I think so), such as ""weil"": ""Ich bin genervt, weil die Bauarbeiter draußen Lärm machen."" Not sure why the German language does this, but there it is.

If you invert the sentence structure like in the English original, you get, ""Ich denke, dass ich, wenn ich Biologe werden würde, ziemlich glücklich sein würde.""",0,1414494210,null,0,false,0,clm13qq,t3_2ke0wr,t1_clm13qq,t1_cllnhfl,null,1426311555,2,false,German,t5_2qq51,2

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Do families need to pay for care?

Pregnant women, during pregnancy, and women who gave birth to a live child, as well as that child have free healthcare for 12 months after childbirth.

&gt; How many mothers are there to a hospital room?

Anywhere from 1 to 6 (or maybe even more, somewhere, not sure). Depends. If there is only 1 pregnant lady in the room, this means one of two things: 1. she is the only pregnant lady at that moment in the hospital or 2. she payed extra for that room. 

&gt; Can there be visitors?

No. No one except doctors and nurses is allowed near the ladies and recently born babies, for 2-3 days or maybe even more if there are some complications. Phone calls, video calls and visits where you can see and talk to mom and baby via TV screen are allowed. In some hospitals it is like that, in other hospitals father can be present during childbirth, but has to pay extra for that. It depends on hospital policy.

&gt; What's the standard procedure?

Ladies go to state or private doctor that they choose, this doctor is following pregnancy and baby development. State doctor is free, private doctor you have to pay. Visits to the doctor become more frequent as the childbirth is getting closer. Then the doctor gives a paper (don't know the English word) to the pregnant lady, with that paper she goes to the hospital. Then after the child birth, mom and baby have to stay in hospital for 1-2 days, then if everything is OK they go home. After that every new mom has a state appointed, free of charge, baby nurse that comes to visit them at their home, and this nurse gives advice, monitors the baby development etc. This baby nurse is obliged to come 5 times.

I think that main influence is that Poles who moved to the area 'have been torn out of traditionalism', as conservatives call it, or have broader views because of adaptation to new environment and diversified society, as liberals call it.

The king of France then said to the viking chieftain, Rollo, ""hey, you see those lands between Paris and the sea ? It's yours if you prevent other vikings from passing through."" And thus Normandy (North-men-place) was born. 

It was kind of an independent state until 1204, when the king of France said ""stop this madness, it's a part of France"", but even though we were now part of France, we still had our own laws until the aftermath of the French Revolution in 1790. And we remained the counterpart of Paris in terms of industry, culture and arts through the XIXth and XXth century (look at all those beautiful French paintings and books that came from Normandy).

But alas, World War II happened, D-Day in Normandy. Yes, the ground assault was heroic and welcome, but there were also aerial bombings that utterly terraformed the land (Normandy was kind of a field test for the rest of the war, where the Americans ended up learning ""yup, let's use lower yield but more numerous bombs"").

The 1973 oil crisis was the icing on the cake, and now Normandy is but a shade of its former glory. But hey, with the downfall of Normandy, our neighbors from [Brittany](http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Flag_of_Brittany_\(Gwenn_ha_du\).svg) started waking up and shoving their d*cks all over our faces.

Italy - you are still pretty much the definition of style. Anything from clothes to furniture, from architecture to how to arrange food on a plate, Italian means stylish, and stylish means a good enough emulation of Italian.

Denmark - cold, wet countries generally can't good food. This is almost always true.  You are the exception. Keep up with the fine bakeries and show the Swedes how it is done right.

UK - you take rights seriously. I mean the part where speed cameras (gatsos) must be visible, not allowed to entrap car drivers. And there are stripes on the road, so that speeding can actually be proven compared to them (like a ruler). This suggests the state needs to prove it before fining a driver, cannot be arbitrary. This is generally how a country should treat its citizens. 

Austria - what can I even say? Pretty close to how to do things perfectly, if a bit boringly.

France - you were always the culture hardest to understand, because you cannot be described with a few simple words like UK: individualism, Germany: organization and so on.

Man sieht hier deutlich wie die Medien sich angegriffen fühlen, da kommen doch einfach andere, brechen das Meinungsdiktat und sind für Frieden, ohne dass sie um Erlaubnis fragen oder die Medien das Ganze erst angeschoben haben. 

So geht das natürlich nicht in Deutschland im Jahr 2014. Meinungsfreiheit war gestern. Für Frieden darf nur sein, wer politisch korrekt auf der Seite der Guten steht. Alles andere ist Verschwörungstheorie.

To clarify, you being okay with us receiving less money or actually starting to contribute instead prevents you from being a hypocrite. I suggested as much in my previous post. I do think that it may make you a bit irresponsible though.

Currently, we tend to have very tight budgets which barely pass all EU criteria and there's still a lot of problems here (from high unemployment rates to questionable quality of all sorts of public services, not to mention complaints from NATO that our military expenses are too low). Being forced to cut our already shaky budgets down would bring a plethora more.

I believe more than dealing with United Kingdom's vagaries (that goes only for poor countries like us or poorer of course).

&gt;Just because we are small and relatively poor country, net beneficiary, means we should just shut up and can't have opinion ?

Why do we in the UK constantly have to remind every the majority of us are pro-EU, pro-EU!!!!! Understand?! Just look at that poll results.

It is incredibly frustrating having to defend ourselves against waves of claims of something we are not. This nonsense is just blocking discussion on the real issue of how we fund the EU.

The UK is bankrupt to the tune of £1.4trillion and rising! Essential services like Social Care and Road maintenance have all been cut back in recent years to the point many are closing and charities like Food Banks are growing in number. 

We need that £1.7billion. For the EU to ask for more off a country that is facing such a huge funding shortage just underlines how broken and unsustainable the current EU structure is.

false,vernazza,HUNG,Glorious Workers' Democracy by Viktor,"Officially the care is free, but in practice everyone bribes the doctor (~500€) and the nurses (a lot less, like 10-15€ as their work is only vital during the hospital stay itself). Some people can't afford giving this much and there's a growing group of people who refuse to hand out any money out of ethics, but these people usually also have the luxury of being able to afford a private clinic.

We call it ""gratuity"", it's completely illegal but because health workers are so terribly paid, it has become the norm a very long time ago. Recent graduates with just the MD to their names (who didn't start the specialization yet) get a net salary of ~450-500€, which rises to roughly twice that after 5 years of experience and completing a residency.

Hospital facilities: I think the standard room is for 6 mothers, but it varies wildly depending on the hospital and how long ago was it refurbished. Because we have a very weird mix of health care facilities (some places are brand new, other's haven't seen a mallet in 30 years), people often go jumping hoops so they can give birth at the location of their choice (AFAIK the hospital you must go to is zoned depending on your home address). 

There can be visitors of course and also the new and relatively new hospitals have private rooms for rent where the mothers can basically get a private clinic level of care from the public hospital's workers, obviously for an added fee.

so choose from this 3, good luck.

there are other small parties but people dont even hear from them because orbán made it so hard for new parties to emerge with many regulations and fully controlling media.

and honestly the only reason orbán still got more votes, is because hungarians from serbia/romania voted for him since they got hungarian citizenship due to him (for the sole purpose of getting votes, but nonetheless i support that decision of his) and he always supported people working abroad, so most of the people from London (200.000 Hungarian) voted for him. all these hungarians outside the border more than 90% of the voters voted for orbán as i heard.

edit: oh and there was a joke-like party MKKP, who might have had a huge voter base, but for some mysterious reason the court didn't allow them to be a party because their name doesn't represent their political view and aims.

Comme si c'était le mal absolu...

Robert Schuman avait avant 1939 toujours cultivé contacts et amitiés en Allemagne...

Le Pen a toujours été anticommuniste il fera son premier voyage en Russie en 1991.

&gt;C'était le 12 juin dernier, dans un salon du ""bunker"", l'ambassade de Russie à Paris. Zakouskis et vodka glacée pour célébrer la fête nationale, l'ambiance est chaleureuse, et la salle, bondée.

https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Orlov_(diplomate)

Orlof n'est pas l'*émissaire de Poutine*, c'est un diplomate chevronné qui a en particulier été conseiller d'ambassade de la fédération de Russie auprès de la république française de 1993 à 1998 et représentant permanent de la fédération de Russie auprès du conseil de l'Europe à Strasbourg de 2001 à 2006.

Mais bon, il est Russe, donc forcément un crypto fanatique fasciste.

L'interview source est [ici](http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/interview-with-french-front-national-leader-marine-le-pen-a-972925-2.html).

Les phrases exactes sont les suivantes :

SPIEGEL: *Do you admire Putin?*

Le Pen: *I have a certain admiration for Vladimir Putin because he doesn't allow decisions to be forced upon him by other countries. I think he focuses first and foremost on what is good for Russia and the Russians. As such, I have the same respect for Putin that I do for Ms. Merkel.*

&gt;A tel point qu'elle souhaite que ""la France quitte l'Otan et s'allie militairement à Moscou"".

&gt;La télévision, qui invite régulièrement des leaders d'extrême droite, diffuse la propagande du Kremlin en français.

Tandis que la télévision, la vraie des grandes chaînes, diffuse non stop la propagande américaine.

&gt;A son retour, la benjamine de l'Assemblée accorde une longue interview à ses amis de ProRussia.tv, dans laquelle elle déclare :

&gt;La Russie a jeté son dévolu sur le FN. En tout cas, je l'espère...""

L'interview complète est [ici](http://www.prorussia.tv/Le-Depute-FN-Marion-Marechal-Le-Pen_v189.html), elle est extrêmement mesurée mais bon ça a dû échapper au journaliste.

&gt;Marine Le Pen se fend aussi d'un éloge passionné pour le régime de Poutine, à la prestigieuse université Mgimo, repère des futurs diplomates et espions. Elle rend hommage à son ""cher Ilya Glazounov"" et assure le pouvoir russe de sa ""loyauté"".

La déclaration complète est [ici](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-G0ddKAmxg), il n'y a rien de tout ça. Elle parle de loyauté concernant la seconde guerre mondiale et la guerre contre le fascisme... Des relations franco-russes qui durent depuis 9 siècles. Mais quand on est malhonnête on l'est jusqu'au bout n'est-ce-pas ?

&gt;Cette ""loyauté"", elle la prouve neuf mois plus tard, lors de l'annexion de la Crimée.

Encore là-dessus ? Annexion largement et incontestablement soutenue par le peuple de Crimée suite à un coup d'état à Kiev, dont j'ai déjà largement parlé.

&gt;Et, en juin, le parti du Kremlin, Russie unie, annonce qu'il va s'associer officiellement au Front national (tout en conservant ses liens avec l'UMP).

Merde, le parti de Poutine aurait des liens avec l'UMP depuis longtemps ? Mais c'est le FN qui fait allégeance ?

&gt; Poutine était un pro occident et un modéré en Russie. 

Non mais lol quoi. Si on a pu avoir l'illusion d'un rapprochement lorsque Medvedev était (relativement) au pouvoir pendant que Poutine prenait un mandat sabbatique pour contourner la limite des mandats successifs, et que ancien directeur du KGB, il est expert dans l'art de dire le contraire de ce qu'il pense et a pu rassurer les partenaires européens tandis que ces troupes foulaient déjà le sol de l'Ukraine, il n'a jamais fait preuve d'une sympathie autre que celle nécessaire pour corrompre ou amadouer quelques leaders.

Répéter un mensonge ne le fais pas devenir vrai. As t'on attendu le soutient des américains avant d'aller au Mali ? Au contraire le ""Fuck the EU"" dans le contexte que tu connais, montre bien qu'ils n'attendent rien de nous. Si tu avais un soupçon d'honnétetée intellectuelle tu le reconnaitrait. En as tu ? 

&gt; Effectivement, il n'a que mépris pour ceux qui sont faibles et sucent leur maître américain. 

Tu penses que Poutine aura plus de respect pour ceux qui le suceront que pour ceux qui lui résistent ? Indice : ouvrez grands les fesses car vous allez nous faire mettre dans les grandes largeur. Enfin, surtout vous. Moi j'aurais choisi mon camps et combattrais les collabos.

&gt; Regarde à qui tout ça profite : uniquement aux États-Unis. Conclus. 

J'ai surtout vu les Chinois réussir à faire des contrats très avantageux avec la Russie aux abois. Si je devais utiliser ta logique simpliste, je devrais conclure au grands complot Chinois. Il n'y a donc aucun argument derrière ton ton pédantesque.

Dann noch mehr Ukraine. Nicht zu vergessen: Ukraine. Puppyhaltender Rebell (so hot right now!). **ACHTUNG Einwurf Pakistan** Typ macht sich über Journalisten lustig weil sie in nem Hotel saßen. In Pakistan. Die Zusammenhänge der Situationen vor Ort zwischen Deutschland (Anfang des Videos) - Urakine (weiterer Verlauf) und Pakistan sowie Syrien (im weiteren Verlauf) sind natürlich für die Zielgruppe total vergleichbar und eigenen sich wunderbar...für eine Verschwörungstheorie. 

Schneller Switch. Der Prophet Ken wieder einmal am Tisch. Dieses Mal mit Bartalmai. Der selbsternannte Journalist der aber erst seit der Ukrainekrise (ja wir sind wieder da) existiert und eigentlich seit dem nichts anderes gemacht hat als für die Pro-Russische Seite zu ""berichten"" (der hat nen super Twitter Account. Noch bevor er den ersten Post am 17. Juli gemacht hat ist er erst einmal den passenden Gruppen beigetreten: **Mark Bartalmai folgt jetzt southfrontpr, European Front, Vera Graziadei und 2 andere
** ). Der ist natürlich TOTAL ""unabhängiger Journalist"" (Zitat Video). Der Mark erzählt uns dann etwas von Pressekodex wird aber dann blitzartig weggeschnitten denn die 2. Regel des Pressekodex sagt, dass man beide Seiten zeigen sollte. Was der Mark halt auch nicht tut. Er ist ja aber auch kein Journalist. Der Mann ist Blogger mit nem Facebook und Twitter Account und irgendwie Kohle um im Ostblock rumzureisen.

Schneller Zapp zurück zum Anfang. Wieder ein Ausschnitt aus dem Fleck-Interview. Der erzählt uns TOTAL SECRET SHITT! ""Würde kein Mensch glauben!!"". Die 6 US Medienhäuser kontrollieren die Medien in den USA. No shit Sherlock...noch nie gehört...Ich hab da noch einen: 3 Telefonunternehmen kontrollieren Deutschland! Würd dir kein Mensch glauben! Wirklich! 

&gt; Davon sind 4 Rüstugnsunternehmen und 2 Energieunternehmen

Schauen [wir](http://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/194705/umfrage/die-10-groessten-medienkonzerne-in-den-usa/): 

1. Comcast 
2. Google
3. Disney
4. News Corp.
5. DirectTV
6. Time Warner

Also Disneys Einfluss auf kleine Kinder darf ja nicht unterschätzt werden aber als Rüstungsunternehmen würd ich die jetzt auch nicht bezeichnen. Ken wird sicher nachfragen. Nope (ich wette das wird auch nicht im großen Interview erklärt. Das weiß man einfach als Zielgruppe). Schnitt zu Scholl-Latur. Ein weiterer raus gerissener Teil eines Gesprächs. Natürlich auch hier wieder nur die Sachen die verallgemeinert sind. Jaja die Verleger kontrollieren die Verlage...wie gut, dass der gute Mann nichts von Aktiengesellschaften gehört hatte. Schnitt. Gabi Krone-Schmalz und wieder einmal ein Ausschnitt eines Interviews. Aussage natürlich total nachvollziehbar. Der Kontext ist aber vollkommen unbekannt. Egal. Der Schnitt ist es die übliche für die Zielgruppe vorgekaute Verallgemeinerung. Mehr muss man nicht sagen. SCHNITT. Es ist wieder Mark der uns aus seinen umfassend nicht vorhandenen Erfahrungen als Journalist berichtet. Natürlich auch hier wieder dramatisiert und generalisiert (Mit Bonuseinlage von Ken: **""Gleichschaltung"".** Das Wort müssen wir unbedingt drin haben. Das liegt die Zielgruppe!). SCHNITT. Wieder der Typ der ein Problem mit Hotels hat. Stating the obvious: die Realität ist anders. No shit Sherlock! FYI: der Mann ist damals freiwillig in die Wirtschaft gewechselt nicht vom ZDF gegangen weil er die Lügerei nicht mehr ausgehalten hat. Heute Hartz4. Da würde ich mich auch für YouTube Hipster hinstellen und Videos machen wo ich das sage was die hören wollen SCHNITT Ukraine wieder einmal. Hatten wir ja schon lange nicht mehr und siehe da! Fucking Hell! Da haben doch glatt Nachrichten die falschen Demonstrantenzahlen durchgegeben!!! No way!! So etwas passiert NIE. SCHNITT Mehr Ukraine SCHNITT South Front PR Agent Marc ist wieder da. Was wird er uns neues erzählen? Nix. SCHNITT Jemand hat einen alten CDUler ausgegraben. Der erzählt uns aus erster Hand von seinen Erfahrungen die er zur aktuellen Krise gemacht hat. Oh wait. Seine Erfahrungen stammen aus einer anderen Krise von vor 14 Jahren aber hey, lauschen wir seinen Worten, denn er war 33 Jahre Politiker! Leider doch wieder nur die übliche verallgemeinernde Scheiße: ""Die Medien,...die Bevölkerung..."" [inzwischen bin ich sauer, dass ich das angeguckt hab] ""Wir können doch nicht vom politischen Diskurs sprechen wenn wir nur eine Meinung zulassen..."" Die übliche Mär von der Meinungsfreiheit. Du kannst sagen was du willst Willy, du hast aber keinen Anspruch darauf, dass dir jemand zuhört. Das Internet ist voll von Meinung. Du kannst da sogar den Holocaust leugnen. An dieser Stelle frag man sich warum der Schnittmeister des Videos das mit der blauen Bluse drin gelassen hat. Was soll das bedeuten? Warum wurde gerade das nicht raus geschnitten? Sozialistische Propaganda?!?!?!?!!! SCHNITT. Mal wieder ein Stückerl aus dem Gabi-Interview. SCHNITT. Der zielgruppentypische Verweis auf Orwell. Hat keiner aus der Zielgruppe gelesen aber jeder hat das Bild von der Straße mit der Kamera gesehen. ENDE

Also was haben wir hier? Ein wirrer Zusammenschnitt verallgemeinernder Aussagen teilweise von brauchbaren Leuten, teilweise von offensichtlichen Vollidioten und selbst Propaganda streuenden Internetpappnasen (woher bekommt der Typ eigentl. seine Kohle) moderiert vom Conspiracy-Jesus. Das alles auf die Ukraine getrimmt. Kein Hauch Blick von der anderen Seite. Kein Hauch Kritik an Russland. Pure PR. Also Leute die 1. Semester PR anwenden um sich über 4. Semester PR zu beschweren. Und natürlich Ukraine.

WAS ZUM TEUFEL DENKT IHR EUCH?!

Wie bekommt ihr die Dreistigkeit zusammen einen solch Haufen billiger Scheiße auch noch als Vorlage für eine WEITERE Verschwörungstheorie bzgl. dieses Subs herbei zu ziehen? Alle Downvotes hier sind mehr als gerechtfertigt. Ihr hättet VIEL MEHR Downvotes verdient und wenn ich mehr downvoten könnte, hätte ich lieber die 10min damit verbracht den entsprechenden Button zu spammen. 

Ihr seid ein Witz. Eure Verschwörungstheorien führen (wie ihr hier und an den zahlreichen anderen Stellen sehen könnt) dazu, dass sich Leute über euch lustig machen. Kein Amt oder Organisation würde auch nur einen Cent dafür hinlegen euch zu diskreditieren weil ihr es ganz einfach selbst tut. Niemand muss mich dafür bezahlen, dass ich euch bloß stelle wenn ich wieder in der Stimmung bin. Ich mache es einfach. Es kostet mich nicht einmal so viel Zeit weil die Fehler die ihr begeht so grundsätzlich und billig sind, dass sie eigentlich sogar BILD Leser riechen müssten. Aber das ist es ja worauf ihr ansprecht. Billig und simpel. 

Ja Mädels. Ihr schwimmt gegen den Strom. Während der Rest einfach über die Brücke geht und den Kopf schüttelt. 

Edit: Warum hat eigentlich keiner von euch Klonen hier geposted: Versucht es doch mal damit: https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/2k6rs4/krautreporter_die_wahrheit_%C3%BCber_die_l%C3%BCgen_der/ Ich bin sicher jeder von euch hat das entsprechende Buch gelesen und ihr scheint ja TOP informiert zu sein wenn es um das Thema geht.

Ça j'ai bien vu.

&gt;ce n'est pas une conquête si elle porte sur un territoire préalablement conquis dans l'autre sens?

Tu vois un adjectif religieux accolé à ""reconquista"" ?

J'ai dit "". On parle d'ailleurs de **conquêtes musulmanes**, ce qui n'est absolument pas le cas pour le protestantisme ou le catholicisme.""

C'est un fait historique que l'Islam s'est développé par les conquêtes militaires. La guerre est intimement lié à l'Islam. Encore une fois, je ne m'en lasserai pas, Mahomet est un guerrier et un tueur.

Il n'y a pas de phénomène historique de ""conquêtes chrétiennes"". Et pour te répondre, ce n'est pas une conquête si elle porte sur un territoire envahi précédemment, c'est une reconquête.

&gt;Pratiquement toute. Parmi les évêques espagnols à l'époque, seulement cinq n'ont pas signé cette lettre.

Sans déconner, ils étaient contre la Terreur rouge dès le coup d'état de 1936 et le meurtre de milliers de membres du clergé  ?

le nombre de victimes représente 13 % des prêtres diocésains, 23 % des religieux et 3 à 4 % des religieuses. Les proportions, qui concernent l'ensemble du territoire espagnol, sont largement dépassées s'agissant de la seule zone « loyaliste » : les assassinats de prêtres concernent 87,8 % de ceux du diocèse de Barbastro et 63,5 % de ceux du diocèse de Lérida. D'autres diocèses perdent 30 à 50 % de leurs prêtres.

https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terreur_rouge_(Espagne)

Et tu voudrais un soutien ou une neutralité ?

Un peu d'honnêteté.

&gt;Justement. Les évangiles mêmes sont donc pour la laïcité stricte de l'Etat.

Bah oui. À l'inverse de l'Islam qui est une doctrine religieuse, politique et militaire. Les deux ne sont absolument pas comparables.

&gt;Celle d'un parti politique qui se prétend ""option de gouvernement"", pour un groupe religieux fort minoritaire qu'il invite officier des messes dans ses meetings.

Il n'y a pas de préférence pour les intégristes. 

Par ailleurs, les messes sont courantes aux Antilles pour les réunions politiques le dimanche, et les prières à Mayotte. Il n'y a pas de prosélytisme, pas de conversions ou de tentatives de conversion.

Sure, the article is being biased by the order in which they presented his words - but I don't see how you are doing any differently by quoting the only positive thing he says.

Alors, toutes les conquêtes seraient des ""reconquêtes"", puisque je peine à penser à un seul territoire sur terre qui n'aie pas été conquis ou envahi en plusieurs sens tout au long de l'histoire.

Je répète: parler de ""reconquista"" n'a de sens que si on parle de reconquête *chrétienne*. A part la foi chrétienne, et bien que les rois chrétiens des royaumes du Nord de l'Espagne et du Portugal et leurs chroniqueurs aient fait preuve d'une fertile imagination en essayant de faire remonter leurs lignées respectives aux rois visigoths d'Hispanie, la vérité est qu'il n'y avait aucun lien entre eux.

How did the author arrive to this conclusion? A decline in population can have very different reasons depending on the historical context. As an Estonian living in Estonia, I *do* see Estonia as a very dynamic and forward-looking place, especially technologically.

Additionally, I believe the author *chose* not to show the full picture, consciously or not, by only including the recent statistics. If you look further back, you can see that there's more going on.

Je n'excuse rien du tout.

&gt;mais le fait que tu te plonge à la fois dans la défense de Marine et Pétain reste une très bonne indication de la ligne du FN

La ligne du FN, c'est la recherche de la vérité contre les manipulations médiatiques. 

Je suis gaulliste, crois bien que je n'ai aucune admiration pour Pétain. Par contre on a abandonné la recherche de la vérité et la réflexion pour tomber dans le sentimentalisme et où on nous impose une pensée au lieu de nous laisser réfléchir par nous mêmes.

&gt;et excuse moi d'avoir plus de sympathie pour les résistants que les collabos.

Pff, ce n'est pas une histoire de sympathie. Je déteste Pétain. Mon grand-père et tous ses frères étaient prisonniers de guerre, mon arrière-grand-père a été déporté en 1940 alors qu'il avait 60 ans et était à la retraite, Vichy n'a strictement rien fait pour eux, qui étaient pourtant tous militaires ou fonctionnaires au service de la France. Les sentiments n'ont pas leur place en politique ni en histoire. Les faits et les données oui.

&gt;Non mais lol quoi.  Si on a pu avoir l'illusion d'un rapprochement lorsque Medvedev était (relativement) au pouvoir pendant que Poutine prenait un mandat sabbatique pour contourner la limite des mandats successifs, et que ancien directeur du KGB, il est expert dans l'art de dire le contraire de ce qu'il pense et a pu rassurer les partenaires européens tandis que ces troupes foulaient déjà le sol de l'Ukraine, il n'a jamais fait preuve d'une sympathie autre que celle nécessaire pour corrompre ou amadouer quelques leaders.

Non mais lol. Tu n'as aucune idée des courants politiques en Russie, Poutine est un modéré qui voulait un rapprochement à l'Ouest plutôt qu'à l'Est. Écoute des experts de la Russie, l'académicienne Hélène Carrère d'Encausse en premier, Chevènement en second, et même d'autres personnalités politiques comme Attali.

Il y a eu un coup d'état soutenu par les États-Unis en Ukraine, après la Révolution Orange déjà financée en partie par les États-Unis. À un moment il faut aussi comprendre qui déstabilise la région.

&gt;Répéter un mensonge ne le fais pas devenir vrai. 

Lol. Tu répètes la propagande journalistique sans aucun recul...

&gt;As t'on attendu le soutient des américains avant d'aller au Mali ?

Aucun rapport. On s'est soumis pour la Syrie et l'Ukraine.

&gt;Au contraire le ""Fuck the EU"" dans le contexte que tu connais, montre bien qu'ils n'attendent rien de nous.

Ça montre un réel mépris et le fait qu'ils s'imposent et nous considèrent comme soumis.

&gt;Tu penses que Poutine aura plus de respect pour ceux qui le suceront que pour ceux qui lui résistent ?

Personne ne suce Poutine. Par contre Hollande suce bien Obama et Netanyahu. On a des images. Compare les déclarations de MLP avec celles de Sarkozy ou de Berlusconi et reviens me dire qui suce Poutine.

Ensuite la culture russe ne valorise pas les toutous. Et force est de constater qu'aujourd'hui celle qui dans le paysage politique est seule contre tous , c'est MLP.

&gt;Si tu avais un soupçon d'honnétetée intellectuelle tu le reconnaitrait. En as tu ?

Si tu avais un soupçon de recul ou de culture politique tu admettrais que la diabolisation de la Russie n'a aucun sens pour l'Europe.

&gt;Indice : ouvrez grands les fesses car vous allez nous faire mettre dans les grandes largeur.

Et comment ils vont nous la mettre gros malin ?

Si tu veux un bon exemple de comment les US nous la mettent, regarde la situation économique et le traité TTIP qui vient.

Les faits sont de mon côté, pas des paroles dans le vent.

&gt;Moi j'aurais choisi mon camps et combattrais les collabos.

Tu es un collabo des US.

&gt;J'ai surtout vu les Chinois réussir à faire des contrats très avantageux avec la Russie aux abois.

Rappel : ""Il va se tourner vers la Chine et l'Asie maintenant alors qu'on aurait pu le rapprocher de l'Europe"". C'est ce que je disais.

Et la Russie aux abois ça me fait doucement rire. Regarde la situation en Europe.

&gt;Si je devais utiliser ta logique simpliste, je devrais conclure au grands complot Chinois. Il n'y a donc aucun argument derrière ton ton pédantesque.

Les Chinois ne sont pas du tout intervenus en Ukraine. Les US oui et n'ont eu aucun désagrément.

Mais bon visiblement la réflexion et l'examen des faits n'est pas ton fort.

&gt;Par contre je vois que le FN et ses représentants défendent Poutine et pas la France, et je conclue.

I disagree - because there's simply no objective way to tell if something dehumanizes people. And you can tell it's arbitrary because sometimes verdicts get overturned - what's unacceptable to one judge is perfectly fine with another.

So you end up with judges and officials being critics and deciding what can be published, what movies you're allowed to watch in the cinema or at home on DVD, what video games you're allowed to play, what kind of violence you're allowed to be confronted with on a TV or computer in your own four walls.

&gt; OTOH there's really no need to trade materials that promote the enjoyment of cruelty

But who gets to decide what promotes ""the enjoyment of cruelty"" and what doesn't? Ultimately, that decision should be up to the individual. When you're shielding them from perceived horrors, you're just treating them as children.

Ich habe kein Verständnis für Homophobie. Oder sagen wir so: Wer ein Problem mit homosexuellen Menschen hat oder deren Freiheiten einschränken will, der ist nicht unbedingt ein schlechter Mensch, aber er sollte etwas gegen seine Abneigung tun. Für mich ist das mit Rassismus vergleichbar: Dieser Affekt ist gesellschaftlich nicht mehr akzeptabel, und wer mit solchen Normen nicht klarkommt, der braucht eben Hilfe beim Klarkommen. 

Man kann anderer Meinung sein, das finde ich aber falsch. Argumente? Nein, da reicht persönliches Interesse. Ich erwarte Toleranz, so wie ich beispielsweise gegenüber frommen Menschen tolerant bin. Jeder hat sein Heiliges, und ich finde es problematisch, anderen da reinreden zu wollen.

Aber für eine wirklich sachliche Auseinandersetzung bin ich nicht zu haben, ich bin in diesen Fragen sehr parteiisch und voreingenommen.

Du meckerst und meckerst über die Schnitte die ich vorgenommen habe und laberst und laberst, dass alles eine Verschwörungstheorie ist, hast aber keins der Beispiele, der Propaganda oder falschen Informationen, die im Video sind wiederlegt. 

Das gezeigte kam alles so in den deutschen Medien und teils wurden danach sogar Entschuldigungen für die Falschmeldungen gebracht, in einem Fall leider über twitter. Waren wohl Kostengründe. :&gt; 
In anderen Fällen wurden die Bilder durch neue ersetzt, WDR5 oder Artikel ganz gelöscht Huffingtonpost. 

Über die Aussagen der Interviewten kannst du denken was du willst, das ist nicht mein Problem und KenFM hab ich extra kein Statement abgeben lassen in meinem Video, weil ich wusste, dass einige darauf rumreiten werden aber selbst wenn man seine Meinung weglaesst, finden manche etwas an seiner Präsenz auszusetzen. Das ist etwas bedenklich aber gut, ist ja nicht mein Problem.

Warum in dem Video viel Ukraine gezeigt wird ist relativ einfach, das ist aktuell. Man will ja nicht zuweit in die Vergangenheit abschweifen und Dinge an den Haaren herbeiziehen.

Wieso wenig gegen Russland vorhanden ist ? 
Die Aussage, dass von beiden Seiten Propaganda kommt ist vorhanden, genauso wie die Aussage, dass man die Interessen, egal wo sie ihren Ursprung haben kenntlich machen muss, egal ob aus Washington oder Moskau oder Peking.
Aber eigentlich solltest du selber darauf kommen können, warum kein Beispiel gegen Russland drin ist. Sowas ist viel schwerer zu finden aber das liegt nicht an mir, das liegt an den Medien und ich wollte das ganze auf deutsch halten, deshalb kamen englische oder gar russische Quellen nicht in Frage. Dazu kommt noch, ich spreche kein russisch. Duh!

Dennoch vielen Dank für die Kritik, das nächste mal eventuell ohne Beleidigungen. Immer gut durch atmen und wenn man am explodieren ist, vielleicht erstmal drüber schlafen. :D

In the Westminster system, politics and political debate is seen as being more inherently oppositional and not a collaborative process.

La  c'est complètement faux. 

 L'europe de l'est n'est pas devenu chrétienne volontairement ainsi que l'actuel territoire de l'Allemagne.

Au moment ou les arabes envahissaient l'Anatolie et le bassin de judée.

Charlemagne poussait son armée de l'autre coté du rhin
 forçaient les saxons a se convertir sous peine de peine de mort et les rois de Danemark effectuaient une politique systématique de poussé vers l'est.

C'était bien des guerres de conquetes  au nom de la chrétienté avec bénédiction du pape

Sans compter le fameux *Capitulaire De partibus Saxoniae*: *Loi promulguée en 785 par l'empereur Charlemagne, pendant les guerres contre les Saxons, ordonnant que les païens soient convertis au christianisme ou tués*

dire que l'Islam est guerrier et conquérant tandis que la doctrine catholique jusqu'en 1700 justifiait la conversion forcé.

&gt;Pope Innocent III pronounced in 1201 that even if torture and intimidation had been employed in receiving the sacrament, one nevertheless:

&gt;..does receive the impress of Christianity and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling. ... [For] the grace of Baptism had been received, and they had been anointed with the sacred oil, and had participated in the body of the Lord, they might properly be forced to hold to the faith which they had accepted perforce, lest the name of the Lord be blasphemed, and lest they hold in contempt and consider vile the faith they had joined.[6]

&gt;La vérité c'est que l'Islam est par nature guerrier et conquérant, depuis le début pas le christianisme.

Les conquetes arabes ont commencé au moment meme ou les roi chétiens d'europe ont lancé leur premiere croisiade.

Che se costruisci ospedali e scuola quando il problema è la guerra (visto che parli di profughi) non risolve il loro problema.

Tantopiù, che se leggevi ciò che è stato linkato, vai incontro a mille infrazioni del diritto internazionale.

&gt;**2. Non li possiamo accogliere tutti, rimandiamoli a casa.**

&gt;Chi arriva in Italia in fuga da una guerra (come quella in Siria) o da persecuzioni ha diritto di chiedere protezione. Lo dice la Costituzione italiana, la Convenzione di Ginevra sullo status di rifugiato del 1951, svariate normative europee inclusa la Convenzione Europea dei Diritti Umani e la legislazione italiana attualmente in vigore sull’immigrazione.
Il 23 febbraio 2012 la Grande Camera della Corte europea dei diritti dell’uomo ha condannato all’unanimità l’Italia per violazione dell’art. 3 (per aver esposto i ricorrenti al rischio di essere rinviati nei rispettivi Paesi di origine), dell’art. 4 Protocollo n. 4 (“Le espulsioni collettive di stranieri sono vietate”), nonché dell’art. 13 della Convenzione Europea dei Diritti Umani perché il 6 maggio 2009 circa 200 persone, che viaggiavano su tre barconi diretti in Italia, sono state intercettate da motovedette italiane, in acque internazionali, trasferite a bordo delle navi italiane e riportate in Libia, da dove erano partite, in conformità agli accordi bilaterali fra Italia e Libia. Era l’avvio della c.d. “politica dei respingimenti” che, secondo le parole del Ministro dell’Interno italiano dell’epoca, Roberto Maroni, doveva rappresentare un “punto di svolta” nella lotta contro l’immigrazione irregolare. La sentenza della Corte europea ha chiarito ufficialmente e senza dubbio che quella operazione di respingimento, così come tutte le altre condotte dal governo italiano fino a tutto il 2010, erano pienamente e senza alcun dubbio illegittime ai sensi del diritto internazionale. Altri respingimenti di rifugiati ai confini, effettuati più recentemente da diversi Paesi europei, sono stati denunciati dall’UNHCR.
Chi cerca protezione internazionale non può essere rimandato a casa, né in un altro Paese dove la sua incolumità potrebbe essere a rischio, prima che si sia esaminato individualmente e accuratamente qual è il motivo per cui chiede protezione.
Intercettare le persone nei Paesi di transito o pattugliare le coste africane per bloccare le partenze, misure a volte adottate dall’Unione Europea e dai singoli Stati membri, in molti casi costituiscono vere e proprie violazioni del diritto d’asilo e in quanto tali vengono denunciate dagli enti di tutela. Violare una legge dove è meno probabile di essere scoperti non rende la violazione della legge meno grave o meno condannabile.

Allerdings bin ich in letzter Zeit nicht mehr so aktiv, dass ich diesen Kommentar gelesen hab war auch reiner Zufall, denn ich überspringe deine Textwände die ganze Zeit normalerweise. Hattest also auch schon n bissl Glück, dass ich überhaupt drauf anspringen *konnte*.

Jedenfalls:

Bevor ich hier als Erster das Schema der Falsifikation in die Verschwörungs*theorie*-/Verschwörungs*ideologie*diskussion -und insbesondere als Reaktion auf die zunehmende Radikalisierung des users Knorkator- eingebracht hab wusstest du doch nichtmal wie man Falsifizierung *schreibt*. Mal abgesehen davon, dass du Falsifikation ganz offensichtlich weder verstanden hast, noch in deinen zahlreichen erbrochenen Beiträgen anwendest - nein sogar zu 100% missachtest. Womit wir wieder bei deinem sinnlosen und zeitverschwenderischen Trollen und Shittalken wären.

Insofern sind deine  Köder echt sau gut mittlerweile (auch wenn du schon öfters diese kleinen, versteckten, rhetorischen Provokationen verbaut hast und ich nur nicht drauf geantwortet habe), aber leider gilt bezüglich der versuchten Erregung meiner Wenigkeit immer noch:

To give outsiders a bit of context, this death occurred in the midst of a week-long protest by Croatian veterans in Zagreb demanding the resignation of certain center-left ministers. The reasons for the protest are fairly confused, but the root of the discontent is a change in the legislation affecting the benefits of the veterans. However, those benefits have not even been decreased, it was only a matter of various services and benefits being reshuffled in between ministries and having their budgetary classification shifted. Moreover as with all veteran protests, there seems to be a clear political component, the veteran organizations traditionally being aligned with center-right parties like the HDZ, which helps explain why the new wave of protests started over an issue that is apparently so inconsequential in the midst of the pre-election season. 

And of course, since we are in the Balkans nationalism is of course ever present as well, as a key cause of the protests is the harmonization of pensions for Croatians who found themselves on opposite sides of the conflict in the chaos of the early 90s.

There are two Polish football players from back then that have near hero status in Greece, [Józef Wandzik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Wandzik) and [Krzysztof Warzycha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krzysztof_Warzycha) both rocking the moustache in the 90s :)

There is a funny story about Krzysztof Warzycha, when he first came to Greece to play the journalists were trying to find out how to pronounce his last name (the first one would of course just be Kristo and that's it). So when he arrived at the airport all the sports journalists there started shouting his name in different iterations as they thought it would sound, so the one that managed to get him to talk to him gave him the pronounciation BAZEXA (vazeha - the ending ha is more of an aspiration but sometimes 'hard'). And that is how this legendary guy got his name in Greece that everyone called him and was even written on his sports jersey :)

have fun in beautiful Poland and much love from Greece :)

Est ce l’intérêt de la France que de laisser l'Europe tomber bout par bout comme juste avant la seconde guerre mondiale ? non. L’intérêt de la France c'est de maintenir la stabilité en Europe. La détruire c'est l’intérêt du FN, mais ce n'est pas l’intérêt de la France. Le FN travaille donc pour ses propres intérêts contre la France. Ils sont *littéralement* des traitres à la patrie.
