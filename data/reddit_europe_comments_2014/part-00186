Focus hard on your studies and you too can go abroad but this time with a job at the many German chemical companies. Focus on the long term. I don't disagree with anything said by others, but if you are serious about living abroad, you can make it happen. Try looking into internships for next summer NOW! And perhaps one of them will let you have a job for a year or two. If at that time you still feel like becoming a doctor (please keep in mind in a recent survey an overwhelming majority of doctors said they would not recommend the job to others) you can do so easily and with a new set of skills. If you realize you really like it or even want to become a doctor while studying in Germany, well that option is open too!

I guess what I'm saying is it's not the end. You are just getting more time to prepare :)

(Additionally, I lived abroad in college, it's great! But living abroad with a job that gives you money to actually experience a place and do a bit of traveling is, frankly,, even better :) )

true,Robotobot,,Irischer Irre," /u/shaboubalah  hit the nail on the head. There are exceptions, but Germany has a population of tens of millions, these cases are rare at best. Knowing German well will greatly enhance more than just your ease of employment, but your life over there. I never heard one person who could actually speak German whinge about life in Germany when I was a barman over there, yet people who didn't always complained about it. I've lived in places where I didn't speak the language, and despite expat groups and stuff, it's still an isolating and lonely experience, like everyone knows somthing that you don't. 

And imagine having to depend on someone else to lead your life - you would be completely dependent on others to read you lease agreements, talk to police in emergencies, fill out immigration forms, go to the employment agency with your (interpretation services are rare in German government agencies), help you read train times and get directions. It isn't nice, and a lot of expats (I hate this term but still) become very disdainful, even proud of the fact that they don't speak the language. 

It's not just in America.

Can you cite a source, or give a credible opinion as to why you think it is politically motivated? A US official stated the fine would not have been so severe if BNP would have stopped the transactions in 2006 when the Treasury alerted the bank it was in violation. 

Given channeling billions of dollars to a genocidal regime is a ""minor"" offense in your book I'd like to get your take on European Union fines against US companies. 

I would personally say bundling a streaming media player with an operating system is a much more ""minor"" offense than substantially assisting a genocidal regime, yet Microsoft paid $1.2 billion in fines to the EU. 

How about Intel offering rebates based on the volume of chips a company purchases (which is common in many industries)? Almost all of the customers that received a rebate were American computer manufacturers yet the EU fined Intel $1.5 billion. 

Unless you consider those ""crimes"" worse than substantially assisting a genocidal dictator, I think the EU owes those companies (and others) an apology fruit basket. 

EDIT:

&gt;Disgusting hypocrisy given US banks caused the global financial crisis.

I should point out the US has fined financial institutions over [$100 billion](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/802ae15c-9b50-11e3-946b-00144feab7de.html) in relation to the financial crisis. Its not picking on a poor little European bank (which happens to be one of [the largest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks) financial institutions in the world). Only $15 billion of that came from foreign banks. 

The US has been *very* active fining the financial industry over the financial crisis, despite what you read on /r/europe. Where legitimate complaints exist is personal criminal prosecutions.

Avendo tempo posso permettermi di cucinare grandi quantità e conservarle in frigo e congelatore, dopo aver fatto una spesa che mi consente di mangiare relativamente bene.

This seems to break the cyberwar code conduct (if there is such a thing). Sure people spy on each other, even sabotage specific things, like the US did to Iranian nuclear weapons research, but you don't just park weapons in a nations civilian power grid on the off chance that you want to take it out. That is the equivalent in real world terms of parking a bunch of nukes in a country ahead of time in case you just feel like nuking someone. Sure you have the capability to take out a power grid but you just don't seed malware to do it out like candy. Has there ever been anything like this? I don't mean the US targeting Iranian nuclear research, has there been a case where a nation state has systematically planted essentially one of the most powerful cyberweapons we have thought of causally? I mean taking out another nations civilian power grid is one of the most severe cyber attacks that can be done against a society.

And the military wasn't the ones to violate the cease-fire, the ~~terrorists~~ separatists were. Both Poroshenko, and the previous interim President Turchynov offered them endless opportunities peacefully resolve this conflict, including amnesty.

I think you need to reread your post.  It comes across as implying anything good about the UK is the result of EU membership.  Your point about London being a financial centre is just flat out wrong.  London was a massive financial centre well before the EU was ever thought of due to it being the capital of the British Empire.  In fact, a good claim could be made that London was the first financial centre in the modern sense of the word.

&gt;  Let people wear whatever they want, but walking around in public with a mask over your face is not fair on society.

Have you ever lived in a society where people do this regularly? Perhaps you personally are just not used to this? I lived for years in an area of East London where many people cover their face. It really did not bother me. (It would bother me a lot more if, as a result of legislation requiring them not to cover their face in public, they decided never to leave their homes...)

Okay, I'll further elaborate.

All an Arsenal football shirt shows is a person's preference for a sports club and that they don't care much for trophies. That is it.

A full-face veil hides the person's face. The face is one of the most essential communication tools. Your facial expressions give away your stance towards those around you, they give away your feelings, thoughts or even intentions.

Humans are social creatures. A human's life is based around social interaction.

Hiding your face is telling people around you that they cannot see any of that. It doesn't give people around you even the courtesy of having the most basic interaction with you. It also means they cannot know whether they are safe or not. It is completely anti-social.

That is why it is uncomfortable to see a person with a full-face veil. Because they are acting in an anti-social manner.",0,1404212352,null,0,1404212560,0,cilmdga,t3_29ju0h,t1_cilmdga,t1_cilm7kp,null,1434495965,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Show me that evidence! 

&gt; We should all be equal before the law - if a subculture within society mandates the wearing of masks/disguises in public, it makes a mockery of this.

TBH, I don't know how I feel about it. On the one hand, it is important that you are identifiable in public spaces. Recently, a couple of policemen got into a brawl with a Muslim man (emphasis on *man*) who  tried to stop them from doing an ID check on his wife because that would force her to take off her veil. He got arrested, and his arrest led to minor riots against the police station.

On the other hand, the woman in the case says wearing a niqab is her own choice, that she accepts identity checks and takes off her veil when asked, and if she does her freedom of religion should be observed. It's the scumfuckers like the man I mentioned above that need to stop.

On the gripping hand, it's all about the message. The only community to wear face-covering gear outside of balaclava-wearing rioters are Muslim women. Instead of a law that ultimately uses different language to target a Muslim custom, I would have preferred a strengthening or extension of the ban on ""obvious religious signs"" that we already have.

&gt; Just because there's freedom of religion, doesn't mean you are or should granted any protection from law interfering with your practise

Religious freedom most definitely grants protection from *unjustified* laws that interfere with religious practice. You might say that laws must be justified anyway, but we all know it's not always the case, as there are all sorts of not-strictly-necessary restrictions in the public sphere. Usually they're just practical nuisances and nobody cares, but if their subject has religious connotations then it understandably becomes a big deal.

Also, things are rarely black-and-white. A restriction may be technically, secularly justified but if the reason isn't very important and the restriction would severely limit people's ability to practice, it's probably better not to enact it.

So while you're right that in principle all that matters is presence of a legitimate secular justification, in practice religion is special in a sense, simply because it matters a lot to people and plays a unique role in their lives. That's why we should take religious sensitivities in the account (though, of course, we shouldn't be held hostage to them).

true,maefuckingeri,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Religious freedom most definitely grants protection from unjustified laws that interfere with religious practice.

But I don't agree with that sentiment at all. What happens is that *freedom* grants you protection from unjustified laws. The religious part as nothing to do with it. 

&gt; You might say that laws must be justified anyway, but we all know it's not always the case, as there are all sorts of not-strictly-necessary restrictions in the public sphere. Usually they're just practical nuisances and nobody cares, 

It does happen to an extent. 

&gt; but if their subject has religious connotations then it understandably becomes a big deal.

And again I completely disagree with this notion. Religious groups shouldn't be more protected than non-religious groups. 

Consider the issue of drug consumption. Sure one can argue prohibition infringes on your own personal liberties, yet we as a society mostly put up with it. But a religious group whose practise includes drug consumption shouldn't be more protected than anyone else who wishes to consume drugs. That's effectively discrimination.

No. Because ultimately liberty is too important a thing to give away. Liberty is of itself the supreme cultural value. That's why it really doesn't make sense to take away people's liberty in the name of cultural values.

&gt; Wider society already enforces what we wear.

Laws should aim to restrict behaviours that are pernicious to other fellow citizens, not to uphold arbitrary values or customs further than that.

Everyone, part of a minority or not, has to follow the common legal framework (which should be neutral and not aimed for or against any particular subgroup of the population), but integrating beyond that should be their choice.

Now, what happens if you try to force integration with targeted laws? you get an opposite reaction from those minorities who feel their identity is under attack by the state (and we are not only talking about immigrants, a big part of those minorities is composed of people born in those same countries).

&gt;

&gt;___Rickettsia___ is a [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) of [non-motile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility), [Gram-negative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-negative), [non-sporeforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endospore), highly [pleomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleomorphism_(microbiology\)) [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria) that can present as [cocci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocci) (0.1 μm in diameter), rods (1–4 μm long) or thread-like (10 μm long). Being [obligate intracellular parasites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obligate_intracellular_parasites), the *Rickettsia* survival depends on entry, growth, and replication within the [cytoplasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytoplasm) of [eukaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote) host cells (typically endothelial cells). 

&gt;Because of this, *Rickettsia* cannot live in artificial nutrient environments and is grown either in [tissue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_tissue) or [embryo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo) cultures (typically, chicken embryos are used). In the past it was positioned somewhere between viruses and true [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria). However unlike *[Chlamydia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydia_(genus\))*, *[Mycoplasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoplasma)*, and *[Ureaplasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureaplasma)*, Rickettsial organisms possess true cell walls similar to other [Gram-negative bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram-negative_bacteria).  The majority of *Rickettsia* bacteria are susceptible to [antibiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic) of the [tetracycline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracycline_antibiotics) group.

&gt;Despite the similar name, *Rickettsia* bacteria do not cause [rickets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickets), which is a result of vitamin D [deficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis).

A few years ago my uncle had an american exchange student, a girl about 18 years old, staying at his house for 6 months. One Saturday evening my aunt and uncle were out having dinner with friends, she stayed home. At about 11 my uncle got a very hysteric call from her and the only thing she said was ""There is some one out there, Where do you keep your gun??"". 

After she calmed down she explained that she locked herself up in the bathroom after she saw someone in the garden. Naturally her first instinct was to look for a gun and from her experience in the US she assumed everyone keeps a gun somewhere. We live in Germany and of course my uncle doesn't own a gun or even knows anyone who does.

Next morning they find out that it was the neighbor's kid who drunkenly went through the wrong gate, looked around and then left the garden realizing his mistake. He came over to apologize because he trampled over some flowers in the front. If my uncle owned a gun, that kid would probably be dead.

Dal sito Helica http://www.helica.it/geofisica.php

&gt; Il rilevamento geofisico aereo è un processo di misurazione delle variazioni di alcuni parametri chiave fisici e geochimici del suolo terrestre. La strumentazione utilizzata misura i parametri più importanti ovvero la conducibilità (che è l'inverso della resistività), la suscettività magnetica, la densità e la concentrazione dell'elemento radioattivo.
I sistemi elitrasportati di Helica, utilizzati per misurare questi parametri, sono il magnetometro e lo spettrometrometro gamma-ray (AGS). Il rilievo magnetico mappa la variazione tridimensionale nel terreno della conducibilità indotta da minerali, **inquinanti**, contenuto d'acqua, salinità e da vari altri fattori.
L'indagine attraverso il metodo Airborne magnetico evidenzia la variazione della suscettività magnetica, generalmente causata da cambiamenti nel contenuto di magnetite della roccia, mentre le indagini di ampiezza dello spettro dei raggi gamma misurano il valore dei radioelementi naturali quali potassio, uranio, torio o **un radioelemento specifico generato dall'uomo.**
I sistemi magnetici e Gamma-ray sono, per la maggior parte delle missioni, installati contemporaneamente sulla medesima piattaforma aerea (elicottero).


Stanno facendo queste rilevazioni facendo solo in Campania, Calabria, Sicilia e Puglia.

This is a huge issue which goes pretty much under the radar in most gun conversations. Gun laws very by state to an absolutely absurd degree, and this variation completely undercuts any meaningful change. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. 

So, let's say that Georgia decides that they've had enough of gun violence, and really clamp down on gun control. From now on if you want a gun, you have to get a license, go though a bunch of training classes, register all of your guns and new purchases with the government, and pay an extra tax for each weapon. 

A person can go through all that hassle if they still want a gun...or they can drive 5 hours to Florida, and buy a gun off the street, and just take it back home. No one will ever know. So the new law is a massive pain in the ass for law abiding citizens, and does absolutely nothing to deter criminals. 

For any actual change to take place, you *need* sweeping reform and power consolidation to be done at the federal level. But that's pretty much impossible because of how unpopular it would be. Even if it did somehow get accomplished, it would likely be decades before we saw any positive outcome; right now there are hundreds of millions of guns in the US, and no one's sure where most of them are.

I said hijab, not niqab. They're really quite different - the former just refers to the practice of women covering their hair, something common amongst Abrahamic scripture, or indeed of Sikh men being required to cover their hair.

&gt;See, while the amount of skin covered and the design by which this is achieved through, varies between the different regions you have pointed out, it is consensus, that a muslim women of age should cover herself.

Hijabs don't cover skin at all, and some don't even cover all of a woman's hair. I singled out niqabs in particular because they are motivated by the political-religious thought of hardcore Islamism. They're a radical interpretation of a rule which is textually far more moderate, and often itself interpreted even more so. These more moderate forms of head covering cannot be made illegal in a democratic, pluralist society because covering the hair is a sincere statement of faith that is fully compatible with religious tolerance and liberalism.

First of all, many girls start wearing a veil around the age of puberty, maybe not a full veil, but it certainly shows that their decision is at first one which in influenced by their parents or community, and isn't a choice of the individual. 


It doesn't matter what one person thinks, but what society thinks as a whole. Some individuals may want to wear the veil as a sign of piety, but some people want to wear a balaclava into a bank because they are cold. We do what is best for society as a whole. 

&gt;And if the women don't feel oppressed, is it really something we need the Civilized Europeans to come ""correct?""

Again it comes down to the consensus of the majority. 83% of people in France believe the veil should be banned in public places. They believe this because they see the veil as a sign of oppression, that it cuts those wearing it off from the rest of society, that it prevents integration. Some of the people wearing it might disagree, for many reasons, they might have been indoctrinated into its use their whole life, or they might genuinely feel happier with it. Regardless, society has said that they find the veil to be incompatible with French society, with French culture, and they do not want it to be a part of it. That is their decision to make. There are many countries where wearing the veil is acceptable, and you can move their if you choose, but you should respect the culture of the country you live in.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt; It's not a set time period you can do it for. It's the level of debt. The US is only around 70% if you ignore the amount the govt owes to its own social security fund. Greece is at 160%.

Greece has been ignoring wacky bookkeeping constructions for too long, that's why they came into trouble.

&gt;The collapse of the cajas in Spain or the property developers in Ireland weren't because of Greece.

They weren't caused by irresponsible government spending either, nor by ordinary people who are now subjected to austerity. Most of that was directed by a rather small group of people in the real estate and financial world.

&gt;I badly phrased my comment. What I should have said was ""a loss of faith in the currency"". I actually think Koo is wrong on this, so won't labour the point too much, but the view of Koo (and a LOT of other economists) is that hyper inflation would set in as a result. That would certainly be worse than long term high unemployment. See Zimbabwe.

Sure, eventually it will. But not right away, not on its own; there are plenty of examples of countries defaulting that didn't ruin their currency completely and forever.

&gt;So you accept there's a point where austerity is needed when you get to that limit?

Yes. We're just nowhere near it.

&gt;The ""other options"" you mention we have discussed and you have apparently accepted as either temporary measures (monetisation) or limited (tax raises).

Austerity is also severely limited. The point is that you never should deny yourself the use of a method to get out of trouble.

&gt;Your last line ""having to cutback on useful expenses either way"" is otherwise known as ""austerity"".

What an astute sense of reading comprehension do you have, just getting what I intend to say right away :p 

&gt;Because if you have a deficit immediately after the default from the resulting contraction, you simply would not have any access to the debt markets at all at that time. So in order to get to the point where you can get away with a default, you need to move from a fiscal deficit to a sizable fiscal surplus. To get there you need austerity.

The difference is the interest payments. That can make up a sizable difference - the difference between a budget surplus and a budget shortfall.

&gt;Again, you're bringing in morality to a discussion of cause and effects. 

Economy is the distribution of goods and services. Morality is essential to it, Adam Smith wrote his theory of moral sentiments before his wealth of nations.

&gt;I have no problem with screwing the wealthy if it's in the interest of the country. The problem is that you can't just force people to lend. Inflation won't smoke them out because they will just move their money out the country.

Causing other currencies to appreciate, improving our export position and reducing our relative debt to outsiders. Or we can tax the returns as personal income. Anyway, it's money that is useless to us so it doesn't matter either way.

&gt;Again, this is silly use of emotive language that suggests your emotions are clouding your logic.

Emotions regulate human behaviour, and this issue has been framed as the lazy crickets vs. the prudent ants from the beginning. Or the sin of profligacy punished with the atonement of austerity, if you wish. As I've said, it's a political choice based on moral ideas to use only austerity as a tool to get out of the crisis.",0,1404225493,null,0,false,0,cilq1qc,t3_28xkwz,t1_cilq1qc,t1_cikrx1v,null,1434498202,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"Yes. I really liked being able to stay with a host family and study at a Spanish university, that was one of the best parts (had a couple professors/classes I really liked). I also met a lot of locals through participating in a neighborhood orchestra, and we played a few shows around Catalunya, as well, and played some good music together. I also met some locals through a glbt university group, where I made a couple friends who I would hang out with and still talk to now, which was a major highlight of my time there. I ended up learning a surprising amount of Catalan, which was really fun and continues to be really fun. I really like the culture overall-- La Merced is a fantastic festival for those going in the fall, although I became a little bit claustrophobic that weekend from all the smoke in the streets, hahah... lots of great events in the street from wine tastings to castellers to parades to various dance shows from all over europe (saw some great ballet for free).

I guess I like Barcelona because it feels very safe, transportation is easy and enjoyable, and the people are nice, there are a lot of young interesting people not afraid to pursue their passions despite the shitty economy. People seem to have a balanced perspective on life, more or less. 

As for its tourist rap, I was not the hugest fan, but I contributed to it so I can't really complain. As much as I like Gaudí's work and I'm happy it exists I find the constant references to it a bit nauseating and I really think Sagrada Familia is a bit over the top (also I really dislike Subirachs but that's another story). The main drawback for me of Barcelona is the sort of '#barcelona'...things  and a lot of the kids in my study abroad program I had to put up with (I didn't want to go out by myself, but I also really didn't enjoy going out to Oveja Negra or the university shots bar repeatedly...). Talking about Barcelona when getting home is also sort of a minor ""problem""-- I was there to study and learn but people just think of partying and/or their experiences going on vacation (admittedly for good reason), so it feels a bit embarrassing sometimes to mention having ""studied abroad"" in Barcelona. 

The study abroad program was great in that it allowed me to be fairly independent and take a wide variety of classes, while still having a lot of downtime to read or go out or watch tv (Aída...). I could just be in my house and didn't have to report to anyone, just had to go to class. The program offered some classes which were really stupidly easy, although I still learned a fair amount, I only took one so I didn't have to spend much time there. If I could do it again I would have spent even less time doing study abroad program stuff and more time doing my own stuff/local university stuff.

Basically, great experience, I wish I could do it again, I really want to learn more Spanish and Catalan and there are a lot of cool classes offered at the UB that aren't offered at my home institution that I'd try out, although I can't really academically take another semester off.

I agree. 

&gt; When enacting restrictions, you clearly have to weigh relative importance of each group's rights. 

I also agree. 

&gt; What I'm saying is there are some things that hold a special place in the person's identity, such as gender, sexual orientation, and religion. They deserve more consideration and must be given extra weight when compared against the more mundane, practical needs. 

This is where we disagree. 

I cannot accept my needs to be deemed mundane as opposed to someone's religious needs. That they choose to believe in a magical daddy in the sky shouldn't make them and their needs any more special. 

It'd be profoundly idiotic for atheist me not to have the right to do drugs, but for my wiccan friend to have because a magical faerie told him so. You have the right to hold such beliefs, but in a secular society such beliefs cannot be taken to justify law.

&gt; Aha. Ein *Positionspapier* - letztlich eine Meinungsäußerung - 

Nach wie vor basierend auf zahlreichen Zitationen. Es ist ein Unterschied ob man einfach nur etwas behauptet, oder ob man etwas äußert und mit wissenschaftlichen Quellen untermauert. 

&gt; in der *hauseigenen* Postille der Diätassistenten ist also bei dir ein ""peer-reviewed-journal""?

Auch wenn die ADA das Journal herausgibt, bleibt es ein Peer-Reviewed-Journal. Bei einem impact factor im Bereich 4, ist Postille vielleicht auch nicht ganz das richtige Wort. 

&gt; Diätassistenten

Ein registered dietician in den USA ist nicht das selbe wie ein Diätassistent in Deutschland. Ein RD ist in jedem Fall Akademiker. Hättest du das Paper der ADA gelesen wäre dir auch aufgefallen, dass die drei Autoren auch alle PhD oder MD hinter ihrem Namen stehen haben. 

&gt; Da sie sich ausdrücklich nicht an Fachleute widmet, ist es etwas albern das Fehlen von Quellen zu monieren.

Finde ich irgendwie nicht. Quellen, und seien es nur einige wenige, machen eine Aussage belastbar und nachvollziehbar. Von einer Organisation wie der BZgA kann ich erwarten, dass sie Quellen nennt und sei es nur, damit diejenigen die es ganz genau wissen wollen nachlesen können. 

Halten wir fest: Du hast keine inhaltliche Argumentation und hast auch noch keine einzige wissenschaftliche Quelle genannt. Vermutlich wirst du auch keine finden, die deine Position unterstützen. Die Anzahl an Papern explizit zu veganer Lebensweise im Kindesalter ist nicht allzu groß so weit ich das sehen kann, aber sie sind sich eigentlich alle in dem Punkt einig, dass es wenn man auf die Ernährung achtet prinzipiell möglich ist. Es gibt außerdem einige Case Reports zu Vitamin B12 Mangel bei Kindern in Folge einer nicht vernünftig geplanten Ernährung, die allerdings in der Regel eine vegane Lebensweise bei Kindern auch nicht per se ausschließen sondern den eben genannten Punkt, dass man auf die Ernährung achten muss aufgreifen. Die Literatursuche musst du aber schon selbst machen. 

Und der vermutlich schwerwiegendste Punkt: Es gibt da draußen eine ganze kerngesunder vegan lebender Kinder und Erwachsene die vegan aufgezogen wurden. Scheinbar sterben sie nicht alle. Nein! Doch. Oh. 

Was sehr helfen würde, wäre wenn Organisationen wie die BZgA und die DGE ihre Positionen auf den Stand der Wissenschaft basieren würden, insbesondere für Eltern die ihre Kinder gerne ohne Tierprodukte aufziehen möchten, weil sie dann verteufelt zu werden, vielleicht auch Unterstützung erhalten würden und nicht auf sich allein gestellt wären. 

Es gibt da draußen eine ganze Menge Kinder die schlicht und einfach vernachlässigt werden, weil ihre Eltern nicht in der Lage sind sich um ihre Kinder zu kümmern. Manche Kinder werden als Folge davon ""nur"" krank, sei es körperlich oder psychisch, manche sterben leider. Die allermeisten Fällen landen nicht in den Medien. 

Teil der Definition von Veganismus ist übrigens der Zusatz ""so weit wie praktisch möglich"". Ich persönlich kenne auch keine vegan lebenden Menschen (ist natürlich nur anekdotisch) die Medikamente verweigern würden, wenn ihr Leben dran hängt, nur weil Tierprodukte enthalten sind (ja, alle ganz furchtbar inkonsequent, muhaha...).

In dem im Fall im verlinkten Artikel handelt es sich einfach nur um eine Mutter die ihr Kind dramatisch vernachlässigt hat. Dass sie vegan lebt ist vermutlich ziemlich irrelevant, sie hätte ihr Kind vermutlich auch vernachlässigt wenn sie omnivor wäre.

I agree however with requiring immigrants who want to gain citizenship to achieve a certain proficiency in at least one of the official languages of the place they live in within a reasonable amount of time, as long as the state can subsidise that education (with free language courses, which I think are common in many countries).

The gripe I have against this law is that it is very likely to make things worse. The problem about the burka is that it's often imposed upon women, but the way of targeting that would be through education and making it clear that the state is ready to help anyone who finds themselves a victim of coercion. On the other hand, measures like this, making specific clothes illegal no matter the reason for wearing them, is causing many women to want it themselves as they feel their culture is being arbitrarily attacked.

It's necessary to understand that the cultural clash is the lifeline of both dominant-culture ultra-nationalism and minority-cultures' extremism.

true,sdtp,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Mate it's not just about robbing a bank. It's not about security. It's about relating to a human being. When I interact with a human being, I take note of their facial features, their body language (a huge part of which comes from their facial features moving), a smile, a wrinkling of the nose, movement in the eyebrows.

Every day, I interact with loads of people. The guy on the train whom I politely ask to move his briefcase off the seat so I can sit down. The security guard at the front of Tescos to whom I smile and nod, who smiles and nods back. The girl on the gym reception desk to whom I say hello to, ask her how her day is. The guys I see every day in the gym  to whom I say hello when I walk into the room. The lady behind the till at the petrol station who I ask about her day and smile and wish her a pleasant evening. To the girl I smile at as I catch her eye when we walk past, to the man who plays his saxophone outside the train station who I smile at and ocassionally give some coins to to thank him for the music.

If you replaces any of those people with someone in a Niqab, the interaction and the relatability drops down to zero. I treat them the same, but I honestly would rather be served by a machine. There is very little relatability with someone in a Niqab. I can barely see their eyes, I can't see them smile. I don't know anything about them. I cannot relate to them on any level, and to be frank, this is a very unpleasant interaction. It's like they don't *want* me to be able to relate, like relating to them on a human level is against their wishes.

It's about integration. If I go to a country where Niqabs are the norm, then, well, I guess I can't fucking complain. But in Europe, they're *not* the norm. In fact, they are completely against the norm, and there is no integration with society. We can talk about multiculturalism until the fucking cows come home, but the fact is: if you decide to act differently to everyone else (i.e. go against Integration), you can't fucking complain about being alienated. I have no desire to befriend anyone wearing a Niqab. I have no desire to have a conversation in person with anyone wearing a niqab. I have no desire to interact with someone wearing a niqab in person on any level. And if someone got hired here at my place of work, who wore a Niqab, I would feel very uncomfortable interacting with them.

None of this is because of the Niqab or its religious or cultural significance, it is purely a human standpoint.

Disclaimer: I fully recognise that the wearing of a Niqab is rarely the choice of the woman wearing one, I just didn't want to type this out every time I said the collective 'they'.

Edit: I'd also like to add that I fully support if someone wants to wear a Niqab. I don't think there should be a law against it. If you want to wear a Niqab, fine, do as you please. I will choose not to interact with you. Live and let live.",0,1404227003,null,0,1404227532,0,cilqo7n,t3_29ju0h,t1_cilqo7n,t1_cilpk1s,null,1434498419,21,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,21

Opposed in what way? Many muslim women see it as the appropriate way to dress and that anything less is immodest. In many/most countries it Europe it is *illegal* for a woman to uncover her breasts in public (whilst it's not for men) as it is seen as immodest. What's the difference? Even if it was legal I imagine you would still find many parents telling their daughters to cover up. Would it then be sensible for a law to be passed banning women from covering their breasts to protect them from misogyny?

What about eating Chinese food? Should that be banned in public because it is at odds with European culture? What about wearing low rider trousers? That was originally a sign of political protest in black South Africans. What about screening Bollywood movies in public? Or Speaking another language? Why not criminalise those?

Was eigentlich interessant wäre, wären Fragen über Taktik und Strategie. ""Warum haben sie den und den Pass geschlagen?"" ""Haben Sie gesehen, dass der Torwart zu weit links stand?"" Die Perspektive des Spielers auf dem Feld ist ja ganz anders als jede Kamera und Einsichten wie es auf dem Feld aussieht wären für den (interessierten) Zuschauer deutlich wertvoller.
Nicht jeder Spieler kann 1/100Sekunden Entscheidungen hinterher in Worte fassen, aber es müssen ja auch nicht alle Spieler Interviews geben. Und viele Spieler im modernen Fußball haben ein tiefes analytisches Verständnis einzelner Spielsituationen und können diese auch formulieren.

Allerdings wird Journalisten beigebracht Interviews zu emotionalisieren. Angeblich wollen die Leute Emotionen sehen. Das ist eine altes Medienparadigma an dem aus welchen Gründen auch immer nicht gerüttelt wird. Angeblich bringen Emotionen Quote. 

Darum werden nur „fühlen-Fragen“ gestellt. „Wie fühlt es sich an wenn man…?“ „Wie fühlt man sich, nachdem …?“. Das ist aus mehreren Gründen schwachsinning.

1. Direkt nach einem Spiel fühlt man sich in der Regel überhaupt nicht. Man ist entweder müde happy, weil man gewonnen hat oder müde unhappy weil man verloren hat. Eine größere Bandbreite der Emotionen ist in diesem Zustand eigentlich nicht möglich.

2. „Fühlen fühlt man fühlt sich?“ ist nichts worauf man eine emotionale Antwort kriegt. 
Man kriegt keine interessante emotionale Antwort, nur weil man jedes mal „fühlen“ sagt. Dafür muss man dann doch ein klein bisschen subtiler vorgehen. Es ist erstaunlich, dass Journalisten dieses grundsätzliche Regel des zwischenmenschlichen Umgangs nicht zu verstehen scheinen. „Haben Sie schon mit ihrer Familie telefniert?“ „Wann haben Sie zum ersten mal daran gedacht für die Nationalelef zu spielen?“ „Was haben Sie gemacht als Sie nominiert wurden?“ Es gibt noch bessere Fragen, das sind nur Vorschläge.

Wer wissen will, wie man wirklich emotionale ehrliche Aussagen von Sportlern kriegt muss sich „Die große Ekstase des Bildschnitzers Steiner“ anschauen. Ist schon etwas älter und sehr langsam erzählt, aber ein exzellentes Beispiel für seriösen und trotzdem unglaublich emotionalen Sportjournalismus.

Zusätzlich wird Spielern von PR Beratern Flsokeln beigebracht um „Interviews zu überleben“ Das sind dann Phrasen mit möglichst wenig Inhalt. Das ist teilweise verständlich, da Fußballspieler soviele unterschiedelich Fans haben, dass immer irgendjemand angepisst ist, egal was man sagt. Allerdings kann man es dann auch ganz sein lassen. 

Interviews in ihrer jetzigen Form helfen wirklich niemandem.

Eine dritte Möglichkeit wäre es konkrete Kritik an Spielern zu üben. Das funktioniert in Der Regel auch nicht. Entweder der Spieler sagt „ja ich hab nicht gut gespielt heute und jetzt?“ oder er sagt „doch ich hab wohl gut gespielt, und jetzt?“

Eine ernsthafte Kritik müsste sehr konkret und fundiert auf sehr konkrete Sitautionen eingehen, und da schalten dann auch die meisten interessierten Fans ab.

I grew up catholic in a mostly catholic country so I do understand it pretty well. 

&gt; They see religion as just another activity, ideology, state of mind, whatever. 


Yes. 

&gt; I would say that's objectively wrong. It's not only incorrect from a scientific point of view as I'm sure any anthropologist would tell you, but it also represents a lack of empathy.

First you have to agree that the ""nature of religious experience"" can vary a lot. My experience was lighter than my parents, and their own lighter than that of their parents. And you can't compare the experience in Portugal or Spain with that in Pakistan. 

And of course, while more common to religion, this sort of emotional investment and identity entanglement can be tied to other ideologies. There's people for whom communism is simply a big part of who they are. Their parents were communist, they lived a communist revolution, and they dedicated their whole lives to their communist cause. 

So not only I disagree that the ""religious label"" determines the experience, I claim that it's not relevant. Beliefs and emotional investment shouldn't make people special in the eyes of the law.

Consider these two scenarios:

* (1) ""Alan, your burgers are to die for, and the place looks great. Well done. Whipping up a menu in Catalan *(not català — happy?)*, whenever you have a moment, would be the icing on the cake.""

*—or—*

* (2) ""Fuck you, you Francoist/foreign swine, I can read Spanish perfectly well but just to drive home my point about being a proud Catalan I will pretend I can't, and instead I will force you to verbally translate the menu into Catalan for me.""

The customer [chose option number two](http://www.reddit.com/r/Barcelona/comments/28dzt1/meta_catalan_nitpickers_are_ruining_this/cici100) (although their wording at the time may have been different). Apparently, this is the option you would have chosen as well. *(Plot twist: /u/viktorbir was that opening-night customer.)*

/u/viktorbir, instead of being fascist about it, how about thinking that maybe it was Alan's opening night and as a result of the hubbub perhaps not all the desired preparations had been completed, so perhaps the customer should have been more compassionate, instead of shoving the law up Alan's ass the way you're trying to do? **Just because you CAN does not mean you SHOULD.**

For reference, Alan currently has his menu in not one, not two, not three, but **four** languages — but I won't blame him one bit if he doesn't invite you down to Sitges to see this for yourself.

I understand the Catalan people were downtrodden *(understatement alert!)* under Franco, and as a result that has helped the pendulum swing violently in the other direction since those dark days, but holy fuck man, be reasonable and compassionate.

Fact: ISIS kills people by smothering them to death with veils?

ISIS has *nothing at all* to do with veils, and more than that restricting them won't serve to do anything to counter extremism. Nothing at all.

Except there are no women who actually wants it. Try finding more than a single example disproving what i said.

&gt; 2) Victimizes people who have to wear the coverings by making sure they're simply not allowed outside - also restricting their ability to report things like domestic violence.

I'm not big on describing the mechanism but basically we have way to ensure that kids go out at least till they are adults (18y) if only by school registers. If people go missing, we notice it really fast and notify child protection service, who do have wide discretionary powers. Also, sequestration and predators generally make a big, biiiiiig scandale when found. They are extremely rare.

No, they beat or stone to death women who don't wear it in their areas of control.

Tra i vari significati della parola ""scienza"" è contemplato anche
&gt;a. Sapere, dottrina, insieme di conoscenze ordinate e coerenti, organizzate logicamente a partire da principî fissati univocamente e ottenute con metodologie rigorose, secondo criterî proprî delle diverse epoche storiche: la sc. è ultima perfezione de la nostra anima (Dante); l’amore per la sc.; il lume, i lumi della sc.; spezzare il pane della sc., fig. insegnare; uomo di scienza, scienziato, o più genericam. studioso, persona colta, erudita: sapeva leggere ... e passava, in quelle parti, per un uomo di talento e di scienza (Manzoni); in frasi iperb. o iron.: essere un’arca di sc., un pozzo di sc., persona dottissima; avere, o credere di avere, la sc. infusa, di chi presume di sapere tutto.

o anche


&gt;c. Con opportuno aggettivo o con altre determinazioni, e per lo più al plur., complesso di discipline che hanno affinità tra loro sia per i metodi d’indagine che applicano, sia per le conoscenze che vogliono acquisire, e che costituiscono anche, spesso, la denominazione di facoltà, corsi di laurea, istituti e dipartimenti universitarî: sc. naturali (v. naturale, n. 1); sc. umane o sc. dell’uomo, quelle che hanno per oggetto l’uomo in sé, nelle attività che svolge, nelle varie sue manifestazioni (antropologia, sociologia, psicologia, linguistica); sc. umanistiche (v. umanistico, n. 2); sc. sociali (v. sociale, n. 1 b); scienze della vita, sotto cui si comprendono talvolta le sc. biologiche e mediche; sc. storiche; sc. giuridiche; sc. economiche e commerciali; sc. politiche; sc. matematiche, fisiche; scienza dell’informazione; scienze della Terra, l’insieme delle discipline fisiche, chimiche e naturali che si occupano delle diverse caratteristiche fisiche e inorganiche del globo terrestre (geofisica, geochimica, mineralogia, petrologia, vulcanologia, geografia fisica, geologia, ecc.). Sono nomi di facoltà universitarie e di corsi di laurea, oltre ad alcune fra quelle già menzionate, le sc. agrarie, le sc. delle preparazioni alimentari, le sc. forestali, le sc. statistiche, demografiche e attuariali, le sc. della comunicazione, dell’educazione, e altre. Al sing., in denominazioni piuttosto recenti, può indicare una singola disciplina, anche come materia di studio nelle università: così, sc. dell’alimentazione, sc. delle costruzioni, sc. delle finanze, sc. dei metalli, sc. della vegetazione, ecc. (v. ai singoli sostantivi); sc. dell’educazione, espressione con cui si tende a sostituire il tradizionale termine di pedagogia quando si voglia sottolineare l’aspetto teorico di questa disciplina distinguendolo dal carattere pratico legato alla didattica; la sc. dell’assoluto, la filosofia; le sc. dell’essere, l’ontologia; la sc. di Dio, la teologia; le sc. del bello, l’estetica, ecc. Raggruppamenti più ampî, sorretti da una lunga tradizione ma fondati su considerazioni esterne e generiche, e comunque non delimitati in senso univoco, distinguono le sc. esatte, le sc. positive, le sc. sperimentali dalle sc. speculative (v. i singoli aggettivi), e, con riguardo ai fini che si prefiggono, le sc. pure e le sc. applicate, secondo che l’attività speculativa sia fine a sé stessa o sia al servizio della tecnica e delle attività pratiche: carattere proprio, ben distinto, hanno le cosiddette sc. occulte

I for myself like it very much, since the vocabulary can be completely different, which makes this variant interesting and complicated.

Ah, so that protects...well, practically no one. Most Muslims don't wear face coverings when they're children, and adoption among 2nd generation Muslims isn't too high either. So most people wearing them won't fall into this category.

Notice the place and time. It's **very** important!
There are relevant things called *context* and *purpose* which appear not to be taken so much in consideration by many redditors here.

The Niqab, because of its symbolism and its lack of social/health benefits, hardly fits the standards upon which the French society has developed and thanks to which it flourishes. It's also unlikely that it could play any significant role in improving the well-being of its (lady) citizens.

Making sure that every person can be recognized in the streets for public safety reasons is an issue for you? Do you live in Airstripe One? Are there ""finger men"" roaming the streets detaining those who violate the curfew? Probably not. And unless we're developing into such terrible society or that's already the reality, we should try to keep things in balance.
Probably you live in a society where putting on a balaclava isn't associated to ill intent, provided it's cold or you are going to a fancy dress party. It's a matter of dressing accordingly. You wouldn't see me wearing a Ku Klux Klan garment anywhere at anytime, if you ask me.

On a related issue: Once I saw this British girl who, along with her mum, had (then) recently converted to Islam, saying on TV that the veil gave her the *freedom* to choose which man could see her.

Alright, you manage to find the only three people who wants to wear it. As opposed to the thousands that were forced before we cracked down. I'll still pick the thousands any day, sorry.

&gt; Most Muslims don't wear face coverings when they're children

... Yes, but salafists coming from countries like arabia saudi tries to and only stop because the school send CPS immediately in that kind of case.

&gt; Grew up in an area that was right next to a 40%+ Muslim area. Try again.

Muslim != Salafists. Maybe you were surrounded by moderates. The immense majority are. But this law target salafists and extremists, which are an issue here.

&gt; The veil ban will do nothing about this.

Actually i won't bother with legalese speech because i'm not a laywer and too dumb to understand technicalicities but it did help close a number of loopholes and remove excuses. ""yeah i want it, Very_Definitely_Not_Due_To_My_Husband"" is also blocked that way and really much of an issue around. We had a salafist in the neighborhood murdering is ex wife he bought because she dared divorce him in france; and some of them would routinely beat them if that wouldn't get them the cops on the doorstep immediately.

It's not ""religious law"". It's ""religion"". Someone following it voluntarily.

So when someone doesn't say what you want you just make things up? Bulletproof argument style there.

&gt;Exactly :) And for that... you need to make that stuff ... Illegal. Yup. You can't send cops after people for legal things. What a surprise.

No one is going to fault you with using police to take down shadow-courts. Banning religious/cultural practices that do nothing to harm you or others is different.

Yes and you point at the core issue. Women are forced under threaths of violence of ""following Totally_Very_Voluntarily"" religion, and if they don't they get beat to blood. It's a big issue around here with fanatics, and we really need such tools to curb.

Then please note our justice system is EXTREMELY different from yours. Judge and courts applies every laws at their discretions, which mean if they want to opt out because they feel it's not needed they will. It's a tool at their disposal for when they want to act on it.

Now the anti niqab law will probably be enforced for once, but most of those anti extremists laws doesn't serve 99% of the time till you stumble on that asshole who tries to use that one loophole.

&gt; No one is going to fault you with using police to take down shadow-courts.

Actually without proper laws to incriminate them they have to let them go. Because otherwise cops start doing their own justice pretty quickly. 

Now we can actually go two ways :

- Give laws to cops for everything under the sun and keep them in check by looking them *verryyyyyyyy* closely (and cracking down heavily on any cops not toeing the line). Cops really don't do what they want in France.

- Or we can get the other way around like in the US with cops who can arrest you how they want without reason (but who frequntly use it because they don't like your face).

Since we had very bad experience with the second case (immense abuse, corrupt cops, case where they arrested people without proper justification, racial stop &amp; frisk which made brown-skined people *run for their lives on sight of cops*, not kidding, etc. We had horrific incidents on the same level of rodney king in california with consequences even worse) before we are going back to the first one (and cops are all volunteers, it's a job so if they don't like following orders on the street they can change job or get reassigned to another thing... Better to force pressure on cops to act only when truly needed *and illegal*).

&gt; The difference being that you see this as a strike against an entire people - the point of the law isn't actually the law. The point is to make people who make you uncomfortable feel uncomfortable.

The only one targetted by such application are the salafist. They don't want to respect basic societal norms like ""don't beat your wife at home silently for not wearing a niqab"". So we have to find new ways to enforce it. And sometime that means keeping a very, very limited fringe of people on their toes. That's called collateral damage, and that's bad. 

But i'm sorry, i'd rather have collateral damage meaning ""a few salafits unconfortable, 3 women who can't wear a niqab"" than thousands beaten like before we started reviewing our policies.

&gt; There's a million laws you could pass or enforce that would actually target what the behaviors you're worried about, but you're not doing that because the behaviors aren't the actual point.

Yes and no. We HAVE already an enormously large number of laws. And that one is another ""loophole patch"" one. 

Justice is a complicated thing in france because *you need your case to fit precisely the law to nail them down in our country. We're back to a *everything is legal except which is specifically banned.* 

And since salafists ignore the ""specifically banned* by social norms, we have to write it down, line by line. No niqab. No beating your wife. No special clothing on your kids.

Un  costume qui te va bien va renvoyer une image de toi différente, même pour des gens qui ne s’intéressent pas DU TOUT à la mode.

J'ai tendance à tout rejeter en bloc quand il s'agit de mode, car je trouve ça futile, mais je me rend petit à petit compte qu'il est nécessaire de savoir manipuler son image pour pouvoir être pris au sérieux parfois. Et cela passe par la maîtrise de sa garde robe.

En fait, la question n'est pas d'avoir du gout ou quoi, mais simplement de maîtriser les standards. Comme quand tu parles français, même si ton truc, ça n'est pas les expression alambiquées, il peut être décisif parfois de maîtriser un certain niveau de langue.

- In the US if there is a suspected shadow court, the cops just go in and arrest everyone and toss them in the dungeon, am i wrong ?

- In france cops are not allowed to go in without proof or valid elements. So to prevent that we go that way : (cop talking to the women) ""why do you wear a niqab ? It's illegal"" (husband) ""she's volunteer to do it"" (wife, afraid) ""it's true"" (cop) ""it's illegal, i'm confiscating it"". And if the husband try to fight the cop he get arrested.

Because without such laws it would go :
""why do you wear it ?"" ""it's my religion, i'm volunteer"" and the cop would'nt be able to do shit about it, even if he knows the husband force it down on his wife. No proof, no laws, can't act. 

that seems unfair, but fortunately : that loophole case don't exist anymore; and that prevent worse rampage from the cops (sometime ago under sarkozy they killed two ""suspicious"" youth in scooter by chasing them in a high tension power transformer without motive, because people feared cops.

Ask the Greeks what they think of the IMF. If the trend goes on, they'll have to sell the Parthenon.

&gt; Nuland is the secretary of European and Eurasian affairs. Its not that odd for her to be in Europe.

It's not odd considering Washington's plans for Eurasia, but it violates the UN charter (no interference). Also, this function shouldn't even exist. Why don't we have a Secretary to North American affairs ?

&gt; Instead they completely backed off (hence the ""fuck the EU"" comment, they were partially to blame for causing the mess then assumed someone else would clean it up). 

They did so because doing otherwise would have been as efficient as shooting yourself in the foot (Russian gas). They still have to bark at Russia on Washington's orders.

&gt; You forget the right nations have to join NATO. For some reason Russia's neighbors seem to feel they need protection from someone. 

I never forgot it, however everyone else forgit to try and understand how the Russians feel about this. NATO was born in response to the Soviet threat. De Gaulle thought that once the USSR disappears, so will NATO. The Russians liberated themselves of this oppressive system, and they're still seen as the enemy. NATO members are the useful idiots of Washington governments hellbent on hegemony (again, Wolfowitz and Brzezinski's doctrines). France and Germany showed it's possible to make peace with multisecular 'enemies', Eastern Europe should take a leaf out of their book.

&gt; You could make the same argument about Russia reigniting the cold war by annexing part of a neighboring country. 

The EUS are the one who re-ignited it by supporting a neo-nazi coup, overthrowing a democratically elected president who refused a deal which couldn't have been accepted. I forgot to mention that McCain was there also. He financed all the color revolutions around Russia. 

How would Washington react when seeing Lavrov distributing corndogs to OWS protesters, supporting the Tea Party and approving a coup ? What if color revolutions were organized in Mexico and Canada, and have them join the Warsaw Pact ?

It is more like you can buy Finnish bread or British bread, but with abolished roaming fees (and without any limits) the Finnish producers can no longer charge more for shipping internationally =&gt; they have to raise the local shipping prices to the international shipping level.

Currently, even with the free movement of goods, producers can still charge more for shipping to Europe than for shipping locally.


Sure, there may be air in the roaming fees now, and this regulation is indeed a good thing, but it is still more expensive for a carrier if you use their plan outside their own coverage zone (since they still have to pay non-zero wholesale roaming fees to the other carrier), causing customer prices to raise if a significant part of their customer base starts doing that all the time.",0,1404234681,null,0,false,0,ciluekq,t3_29jq07,t1_ciluekq,t1_ciltmza,null,1434500895,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

&gt;They still have to bark at Russia on Washington's orders.

That is demonstrably false. EU nations are the ones who got the US to even back off of sanctions. Hardly the US running the show if it cant even impose sanctions because of pressure from the EU. 

I am familiar with The Grand Chessboard. The author thought of Eurasia as the center of power. Although that can hold somewhat true, its a bit of an outdated mentality.

&gt;The Russians liberated themselves of this oppressive system, and they're still seen as the enemy.

The thing is they weren't as of late. The US was working on free trade agreements with them. The West was more and more seeing them as a partner than a threat. The countries that never saw them as a partner were the old Eastern Bloc or USSR countries. 

&gt;NATO members are the useful idiots of Washington governments hellbent on hegemony

I would argue at this point its more beneficial for most non-US NATO members. They spend next to nothing on defense, yet still have a vote in the organization. Libya is proof non-US NATO members can also influence the US into action for their national interests. 

&gt;The EUS are the one who re-ignited it by supporting a neo-nazi coup

The notion that it was a neo-Nazi coup has been debunked many times over. I am sure the US would not like that, but I doubt they would annex part of Alberta. 

I think reading other sources is important, but many of what VOR and RT prints is debunked by facts. The problem is they dont often back up their articles with facts, so if another source responds to them with facts its easy to see who wrote a well researched article.

&gt;The severity of the punishment relates to the bank's lack of cooperation over a period of years, the U.S. official said. The bank continued to process transactions that the U.S. says violated the law even after the investigation began. [Source](http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/30/investing/bnp-paribas-sanctions-fine/). 

The US has fined financial institutions over [$100 billion](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/802ae15c-9b50-11e3-946b-00144feab7de.html#axzz36A4tEdFP) since the crisis. Only $15 billion of this has come from foreign banks. Its not picking France. HSBC and BNP were breaking the law so they were fined. JP Morgan and other US institutions were breaking other laws, which is why they were also fined. 

Part of their punishment is they cant process dollar transactions through New York for one year (which is what they were doing for banned clients). The fact they were actively hiding the names of the clients leads me to believe they knew full well they were breaking the law, so I dont feel all that bad for them. 

**TL;DR:** this has nothing to do with their European operations, and everything to do with them blatantly using New York's financial infrastructure to violate US sanctions. They hid the names of their Sudanese clients because they knew what they were doing was illegal. Even after they were told they were breaking the law they continued their illegal practices for years.

&gt;

&gt;The __Schulze method__ is a [voting system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system) developed in 1997 by Markus Schulze that selects a [single winner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-winner_voting_system) using votes that express [preferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting_systems). The method can also be used to create a sorted list of winners. The Schulze method is also known as __Schwartz Sequential Dropping__ (__SSD__), __Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping__ (__CSSD__), the __Beatpath Method__, __Beatpath Winner__, __Path Voting__, and __Path Winner__.

&gt;The Schulze method is a [Condorcet method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method), which means the following: if there is a candidate who is preferred over every other candidate in pairwise comparisons, then this candidate will be the winner when the Schulze method is applied.

&gt;The output of the Schulze method (defined below) gives an ordering of candidates. Therefore, if several positions are available, the method can be used for this purpose without modification, by letting the *k* top-ranked candidates win the *k* available seats. Furthermore, for [proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation) elections, a [single transferable vote variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_STV) has been proposed.

&gt;The Schulze method is used by several organizations including [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian), [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system\)), [Gentoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_Linux), [Software in the Public Interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_in_the_Public_Interest), [Free Software Foundation Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation_Europe), Pirate Party associations and many others.

Inejiro Asanuma was assassinated by a 17 year old Japanese guy with a sword. How did the current Ukrainian-Russian war start? Ukrainians had enough of Russia and decided to fight.

I doubt that, AI is far from letting them operate autonomously. They might do simple tasks on their own, but will not be able to fight in an environment like Afghanistan or Iraq on their own. 

There are also still huge problems with friend foe ID.

&gt; We desperately need international agreements on their use and capacity.

Agreed, but those never really helped. 

&gt; They're the continuation of fighter jets, and will render them obsolete. Agility of fighter jets is constrained by how much G-force a human pilot can take, and by the pilots' reaction time. Twenty years from now, drones will literally run circles around fighter jets. They will execute evasive maneuvers autonomously, and lock into targets just as autonomously as modern missiles already do today. It's inevitable.

I also doubt that. Once again, AI is far from that and there are more problems to be solved. 

AEGIS coupled to Lasers should be able to get down those drones easily. 

One should also keep in mind that there are different types and roles of drones that will affect warfare in different ways.

Disassembly would depend on the action of the firearm. I think the UK defines it (loosely) as being rendered inoperative, in that the parts cannot be used as a firearm without assembly, and cannot quickly be assembled into a working firearm. I have no idea how they define quickly.

Essentially if the weapon can be fired by simply loading with ammunition, then it would not be considered disassembled.

I realize that there are many holes in this argument, not least covering people who want to carry weapons, such as hunters.

1 - all residency permits have to be renewed; not sure how long the retiree visa is but I would bet five years. 

2 - depends on the visa, not sure

3 - yes and what's more as an American they won't even look at your passport, they'll just wave you through. 

4 - you'll have to provide proof of solvency; I think it's something like 75,000€ liquid. 

5 - There are many, and they are pretty cheap. Your documentation will have to be certified, then translated, then have an apostille afixed. There is going to be a lot (a lot) of paperwork and red tape and rubber stamps and oh-no-this-one-isn't-right-start-all-over-again. Welcome to Spain. 

6 - They will tax you on any income you earn here (sounds like none) but they may also require you to pay into social security (this is around 200€/month I believe) but that is speculation on my part. Of course everyone gets to pay the 21% VAT on anything you buy. You might be required to have  private medical insurance but I'm not clear on that. If so I paid around 200€/month for a comprehensive plan for a while before I figured out it wasn't markedly better than the free health care. 

7 - Your first stop should be the Spanish consulate nearest you in the US; they can put you in touch with certified translators and will likely be able to recommend a visa service.

This is especially true, if you take the data for Greece, Hungary, Netherlands, Poland and the UK with a bit of salt.  (In the intro it is explained, that there are a significant numbers of accidents without a specified road type)

However the values for Finland and Romania are truly impressive.

In general Germany seems to be mostly on par with the Netherlands (which have a 120 km/h limit), of the immediate neighbors, only France seems to be significantly lower.
If you look at the other statistics (fatalities / 1000km, fatalities on motorways / non motorways), Germany doesn't seem to stand out very much either.

However, as far as I can tell the statistic for fatalities / x km traveled is missing. In my opinion this would be by far the most telling statistic. Since in a country without motorways or in which motorways are rarely used, there will be less accidents.

On the other hand you have countries like Belgium and Luxembourg with pretty disastrous results, which I would attribute to their relative small size and low number of inhabitants, coupled with well used motorways.

Le thread revient donc uniquement à prendre les gens de haut et dénigrer par faciliter, sans justification aucune.


Toi tu arrive avec la facilité d'avoir le public avec toi et au lieu de répondre de façon constructive, tu es arrogant, tu me met dans la case de ce que toi tu entends par conspirationniste et tu me dénigre à l'aide de cette étiquette là, sans justification aucune. Surtout que au final tu n'en sait rien, peut être que je suis aussi critique que toi sur ce que vous appelez les théories du complot mais le fait de vous voir moutonner ainsi m'a tellement donné pitié que je me suis permis d'intervenir.

Quand a ton argument part rapport à l'attitude d'éveillé ça me fait bien rire car ce que je fais cad chercher le débat, cela signifie que je met tout le monde sur le même plan et que je tiens compte de ce que disent les autres, contrairement à toi qui a l'attitude que tu critique, cad mettre des gens dans des cases (""conspirationiste"", ""mec pseudo éveillé"") pour pouvoir ensuite les dénigrer sans effort car de toute façon aucune justification est nécessaire car tu as amalgamé la personne dans une catégorie qui a tord par essence.

Also alot of questions revolve around the company itself and their product. That's what I always had for my interviews (I'm an engineer).  
Last interview for the current job I'm doing I got asked if I informed myself beforehand about what their product is and what the machines we're manufacturing are all about. He was basically just checking if I went to their homepage and read all the information I could possibly get on there.  
Also I had one interview where I got asked about the company's history and how they got where they are today (well that day).  
You should focus on getting as much information about the company as you can.  
~~It's not totally uncommon~~ It's really rare but it's possible to even get asked about your private life as in your religion, political preferences, family.  
Those are questions you don't have to answer and THEY KNOW that. That's why they're asking them. They try to get you out of your comfort zone and see your reaction.  
If that happens you can either answer or politely tell them you don't want to answer. Just don't lose your cool that's the purpose on those questions.  
Idk if it's the same in the US but if you talk to someone you always make eye contact. Looking down on your lap while answering is not a good thing over here.  
OH! And btw your portfolio/resumee. prepare for any questions they might have about it. Like if you have a gap in it (like half a year/year) you might get asked what you did there and why you took a ""break"". It's always a good thing to have a prepared answer for those because if you stutter around when asked that it doesn't look good.

Also, ja, weibliches Anhängsel Sailor Moon ist spätestens ab der allerletzten Szene überdeutlich.

Männliches Anhängsel ist niemand spezifisches, einfach der übliche, meistens ""unnütze"" Sidekick, den ich einfach im Steampunkstyle haben wollte. Als kleiner Nod an Steamboy gedacht, aber im Prinzip einfach der 08/15 Meistensnutzlossidekick wie Rocko, Krillin,...

Shaddolord ist eine Art Mischung aus Skeletor und Queen Beryl (der Hintergrund der ganzen Szenerie wo er ist soll an ihren Thronraum erinnern), aber auch hier eigentlich einfach als typischer Bösewicht angelegt, der auf niemand spezifischen Bezug nimmt.

Der Name vom blauen Viech ist sogar ein Anagramm für Pikachu: Kapuchi. Und pokemonmäßig gab's noch die ""Guess that thing"" Sequenz vor der Werbung, ziemlich überdeutlich halt an ""Who's that Pokemon"" angelehnt.

Die Kristalle sind viel, die sind wie die Dragonballs, wie die ganzen Sailor Moon Kristalle der Macht, einfach alles was immer wieder in Animes vorkommt, das wahnsnnig mystisch ist und irgendwelche Kräfte verleiht, Wünsche erfüllt oder was auch immer...das MacGuffin der Story im Prinzip. Aber optisch, jap, komplett Zelda nachgeahmt. ;) Mir war's so nebenbei ohnehin wichtiger, eine Art Durchschnitt von typisch auftretenden Charakteren und Elementen im Genre darzustellen, ohne dass jetzt alles 1 zu 1 auf etwas anderes spezifisch angelehnt ist.

Facecovered Suitguy's Name soll eine Verarsche von Tuxedo Mask's genau so... wahnsinnig ""mysteriösem"" Namen sein. Und er selber ist wieder vieles, ohne auf einen Charakter speziell Bezug zu nehmen. Halt der typische schlanke, haargegelte, homoerotisch angehauchte schleimige Bösewicht: Paradebeispiel, James von Team Rocket.

Yes! :D Der erste, der den Phoenix Wright Moment erkannt hat. Auf den ersten, der mich auf POMF anspricht, wart ich noch. ;)

Mnjeh, nach Baka heißen die Worte leider gar nix mehr und ergeben so viel Sinn wie der Text vom Introsong oder die geheime Fatshimutshi-Technik. :P Ich hab da ordentlich viel Nonsensejapanisch reingehaut, ein paar Sachen heißen aber was, Chaibuschild ist zum Beispiel Schnittlauchschild...don't ask why, irgendwas amüsiert mich dran. xD

Yop, König der Löwen, und danach noch ziemlich unübersehbar die wohl am öftesten wiederverwertete Filmszene der Welt, Luke ich bin dein Vater. Aber das musste irgendwie rein, hat so gut gepasst dass Shaddolord sein Vater ist. :P

Und ja, Facecovered Suitguy hat Meister Gokiburi wirklich umgebracht, irgendwann zwischen dem Moment an dem Kamono von Gokiburi den grünen Kristall bekommen hat, und der Konfrontation vorm Palast der Albträume. Dazwischen lagen ja immerhin wahrscheinlich 4 inexistente Staffeln von Ryoshi Shupigeru wo man das vielleicht gesehen hat. ;) Aber ja, umgebracht hat er ihn definitiv, weil er den grünen Kristall wollte, den aber zu dem Zeitpunkt schon Kamono hatte, weswegen er ja dann das Baka Haka Hu machen kann. Wenn er ihn nicht umgebracht hätte, hätt Gokiburi am Ende ja auch nicht als Geist in den Wolken auftauchen können. ;)

You clearly weren't, unless you were saying all of Europe (which is the only plausible alternative to meaning specifically me given the context) are idiots with no idea what they're talking about. On a more practical level, since you can't differentiate between the two, probably best that you don't use them. 

&gt;You never answered my point either. Which is that in the current political climate any attempt at legislation will result in a large and armed group of people feeling that they are being persecuted.

I was going to, but it's pretty absurd. You're trying to imply your government is barely one step above a failed state; unable to legislate what is required to reduce high murder rates and gun crime statistics for fear of an insurrection. You do realise that's what you're effectively saying, right? That the US Government is too weak to govern. It's farcical. 

&gt;That's the reality of the situation and it's easy to sit on your computer in Europe and explain to us all these simple solutions.

I may be in Europe but, frankly, you have no idea of my exposure to America or Americans. I have many American friends, interact with many more on a daily basis, having American family (both naturalized and by birth), family in the US military, and a large exposure to US culture both from frequent visits and through the dominance of it on the internet and media. You can try and say I'm too distant to understand what I'm talking about but, in reality, that's just a way for you to try and shut out what you don't want to hear. US Gun control can be stepped up; saying it can't because the Government is too scared of its people is just a twisted perception of reality that circulates back to justify the earlier quotes you made. I really just don't see that it has any basis in reality. 

In any case, what kind of stupidity is it to come in to an /r/europe thread, where the question is what Europeans think of US gun laws, and then call them all stupid?

Its also not freedom for freedoms sake, its freedom so everyone can have a chance to be happy without unnecessary interference. That freedom is still not allowed to encroach on the freedom of others though.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt; I'm neither a lawyer or a firearms expert so I would expect my argument here to be picked apart by either, but I'll have a go.

Fortunately, there are not many of those on reddit, and even less so on /r/europe, so your argument will not be picked apart. I certainly can't because I too am none of those things.

&gt;I realize that there are many holes in this argument, not least covering people who want to carry weapons, such as hunters. I guess if you're not currently using it (at a range, hunting, or some other legal purpose) it should be disassembled

Just out of curiosity, why? Why do you believe gun owners should only be able to transport a firearm that is disassembled? I don't have numbers, but I think violence linked to people transporting assembled firearms would be quite low. It also defeats the purpose of people who carry side arms for protection, something millions of Americans do on a regular basis. Would you make a distinction between different types of firearms? I.e. pistols vs. hunting rifles vs. assault rifles?

&gt;unless locked up in your home.

Yeah I think every gun owner should own a gun safe and keep their firearms locked up. But how do you enforce this? How do you enforce making firearms be disassembled at someone's home?",0,1404243379,null,0,false,0,cilz227,t3_29jxc8,t1_cilz227,t1_cilw5xh,null,1434503374,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

must *means the same as* have to  
must not *means something different from* don't have to

As a native speaker, you probably never noticed that before.

The German ""müssen"" then behaves more like the English ""have to"". If you say, ""Du musst nicht..."" then you're negating the obligation: you are not obliged to.

The English ""You must not..."" actually means that you are obliged to not do something. In other words, it is forbidden: it's not the opposite of ""must"", it's the opposite of ""may"". So to express that in German, you must say: ""Du darfst nicht...""

Here, of course, you're not using ""nicht"" but ""kein"", but in this case it's still a negation so the principle is the same.

Summing up:

you must X = you are obliged to X = du musst X  
you must not X = you are obliged to not X = you may not X = du darfst nicht X

you have to X = you are obliged to X = du musst X  
you don't have to X = you are not obliged to X = du musst nicht X

If you have a dual band phone and it's 850/1900, it won't work in Europe. If it's 850/1800 (for example) it should work on at least some networks, but I don't think this type of phone is common.

A tri-band phone should work: an American tri-band phone is usually 850/1800/1900, so should work on some networks in Europe. If you're lucky, it may even be a quad-band phone, which will work on all German networks.

That's the first thing. The next thing is whether your plan allows roaming. Basically, a roaming tariff will allow you to use at least one network in Germany. Your provider should be able to tell you which networks. Of course, this does mean that you'd be making and receiving international calls all the time, even if you're phoning a German number: this is because the call goes through the local network *and* your own provider, which involves a transatlantic call. You'd need to ask about roaming charges on your plan as well.

If you want to, you can in theory get a pre-paid German SIM card for your stay in Germany. This does mean you'll have a new number, though; but it will much cheaper to make calls within Germany (and receiving calls is always free in Germany, as long as you're not roaming). Some phones will accept two SIM cards and you can switch between them as you wish; the chances are, however, that you'll have to take your American SIM card out to put your German SIM card in. Unfortunately, it's common in America to have your phone permanently ""locked"" to a specific SIM card, but I believe most providers will unlock your phone for a small fee.

If we still put the speed limit high, then countries that wanted constant lower limits would have to sign them all over since it would be regulated that the speed limit was, say 130 otherwise.

* ""if"" translates to ""wenn"" (slightly confusing because it sounds like when): ""Wenn du müde bist, geh schlafen (if you're tired, go to sleep)""; ""when"" translates to ""als"" (reference to an event in time): ""Als ich müde wurde ging ich schlafen. (when I got tired I went to sleep)""; ""ob"" is used like ""whether"": ""Sag mir ob du müde bist (tell me whether you're tired (or not))""; ""falls"" is used like ""in case"" (easy to remember because ""der Fall"" = ""the case""): ""Falls es regnet bleibe ich zuhause"" (in case it's raining I'm staying at home)""

* alles = everything; alle [something plural] = all of [something plural]; the [something plural] is optional when it's clear what you're talking about from the context, so instead of ""alle [Leute/Menschen/hier]"" you'd just say ""alle"" and it would translate to ""everyone""; ""alls"" doesn't really exist, unless you mean ""des Alls"" (genitive space)

* ""man"" is used like ""one"", or ""you"" (when you're not meaning ""you"" but people in general). ""One does not simply walk into Mordor"" = ""Man geht nicht einfach so nach Mordor""; Mann = ""man"" (a male person); ""mann"" (lowercase) does not exist.

* ""weshalb"" is for asking for a reason or cause (same as ""warum"" and ""wieso"") and translates to ""why"". ""deshalb"" (when used alone) can be a snappish answer to that (""Deshalb!"" - ""That's why!""), or as a conjunction indicating a reason/cause: ""Er war müde, deshalb ging er schlafen"" - ""He was tired, that's why/which is why he went to sleep""

If they use laser to measure your speed, you generally subtract 3% from your speed (if you're driving over 100km/h) or 3km/h (if you're driving under 100km/h) in addition you have 10% headroom before the cops actually bother to fine you for the most part.

Then the unmarked cruisers generally use something called ProVida, which records video and the cruisers speed. The cop will then match your speed and record for a while. It will then be sent to a tech who will calculate your speed using the video recording. It will be calculated as close to accurate as it can be, in your favor obviously, so the 3%/3kmh can't be used here.

After that..

We have two sorts of fines. It's about 75 - 115 euros if it's only a little (this apparently depends not only how much you were going over but also what's the legal speed limit as well).

If you go over 20 kilometres over the limit, you will be given day fines. These are the things that sometimes get us into news. Basically, if you are seen to be really reckless, the police wants to make sure that you're really hurting for your mistake. So the fine is X times the amount you make in a day.
