true,Gro-Tsen,null,null,"I don't really care whether the Parliament's seat is in Strasbourg or Brussels, but there's something which is always taken for granted and I think shouldn't be, namely that it's a good idea for the Parliament to hold sessions next to the Commission and the Council.  I can imagine reasons for this, of course, but *it could also be good, in the interest of the separation of powers, for the Legislature NOT to have its seat next to the Executive*.

The idea of having a different set of agents and civil servants for each institution is not something we should try to save money on: it is important for democracy; having them reside in different places also helps keep them distinct.  And it could make corruption and lobbying harder, or at least easier to track, if lobbyists have to have agents in two places (or send them back and forth between these two places).

Instead of having the Parliament move next to the Commission for part of the year, why don't we have it the other way around, have the Commission come to the Parliament when they need to interact?  The Commission is meant to be responsible, and therefore summonable, before the Parliament, not the other way around.

Now, if Strasbourg is too difficult to reach, that's a valid reason to move the Parliament elsewhere, but I think there are serious reasons *not* to put it in the same city as the Commission (and the Council should probably also meet in a different city).

&gt; Je regarde comme impie et détestable cette maxime, qu'en matière de gouvernement la majorité d'un peuple a le droit de tout faire, et pourtant je place dans les volontés de la majorité l'origine de tous les pouvoirs.  Suis-je en contradiction avec moi-même ? […] Quand donc je refuse d'obéir à une loi injuste, je ne dénie point à la majorité le droit de commander ; j'en appelle seulement de la souveraineté du peuple à la souveraineté du genre humain.

English translation:

&gt; I hold it to be an impious and an execrable maxim that, politically speaking, a people has a right to do whatsoever it pleases, and yet I have asserted that all authority originates in the will of the majority.  Am I then, in contradiction with myself? […] When I refuse to obey an unjust law, I do not contest the right which the majority has of commanding, but I simply appeal from the sovereignty of the people to the sovereignty of mankind.

How does this work in practice?  Not easily, of course.  This is, for example, the reason why we have judges, *who are not elected*, and we give them the power to overrule the executive and sometimes even the legislative (ah, here's another quote I like: [""de prendre mon moulin ? oui, si nous n'avions pas des juges à Berlin""](http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Meunier_Sans-Souci)).  But more generally, this is why have *checks and balances* in a Constitution.  There is a very famous quote by Winston Churchill, which you basically paraphrased in an earlier comment:

&gt; No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise.  Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.

This citation is almost always taken out of context.  It was spoken on 1947-11-11 (when Churchill was Leader of the Opposition), during a debate in the House of Commons on a bill (brought forth by Clement Attlee's government) that would become the [Parliament Act 1949](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Acts_1911_and_1949#Parliament_Act_1949), whose essential content was to limit the House of Lord's power to block passing of a law.  Churchill was arguing against the law, so, in favor of bicameralism, and in favor of the usefulness of the House of Lords' power to block passing of a law until new elections (not that I at all agree with him on that particular *form* of bicameralism, but the general argument is worth hearing): his main point is that the Lords should be able to compel the people to think twice about a question.  The [whole debate transcript](http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/nov/11/parliament-bill) is worth reading, but let me just quote the following, to restore the proper context of the above quote:

&gt; The whole history of this country shows a British instinct — and, I think I may say, a genius — for the division of power.  The American Constitution, with its checks and counterchecks, combined with its frequent appeals to the people, embodied much of the ancient wisdom of this island.  Of course, there must be proper executive power to any Government, but our British, our English idea, in a special sense, has always been a system of balanced rights and divided authority, with many other persons and organised bodies having to be considered besides the Government of the day and the officials they employ.  This essential British wisdom is expressed in many foreign Constitutions which followed our Parliamentary system, outside the totalitarian zone, but never was it so necessary as in a country which has no written Constitution.

&gt; The right hon. Gentleman spoke about Parliament, about the rights of Parliament, which I shall certainly not fail to defend.  But it is not Parliament that should rule; it is the people who should rule through Parliament.  That is the mistake he made, an important omission. [...]

&gt; The object of the Parliament Act \[of 1911 — Gro-Tsen's note\], and the spirit of that Act, were to give effect, not to spasmodic emotions of the electorate, but to the settled, persistent will of the people. [...]

&gt; All this idea of a group of super men and super-planners, such as we see before us, ""playing the angel,"" as the French call it, and making the masses of the people do what they think is good for them, without any check or correction, is a violation of democracy.  Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe.  No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise.  Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time; but there is the broad feeling in our country that the people should rule, continuously rule, and that public opinion, expressed by all constitutional means, should shape, guide, and control the actions of Ministers who are their servants and not their masters.

The concord, called for in De Tocqueville's quote, between the power of the majority and the rights of the minority is a very tricky one to get right.  But it is by no means obvious, as Churchill reminds us, that giving complete, direct and unchecked power to the people *at a given instant in time* is the best way to serve the general principle that all authority originates in the will of the majority.",0,1407015379,null,0,false,0,cjf64z5,t3_2cdyrn,t1_cjf64z5,t1_cjetwqx,null,1435036571,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,bureX,SERB,Serbia,"It was all about scapegoating. Jews didn't have anybody to back them, nor did the Romani, nor did homosexuals, secret societies, the disabled, etc., so they were pretty much an easy target for the nazi regime. Who's at fault for X? Point the finger at the unprotected people - problem solved. Also: free slave labor, grabbing all of their belongings, doing medical experiments, murdering them when they are all used up... when you're a crazed nazi, hellbent on taking over the continent, what's not to like? ""Genetic inferiority"" did plenty of backbreaking labor for these sickos in their clean, pressed uniforms; and since there was nobody to stand up to the aggressors, it was an apparent win win.

Fortunately, things have changed, and we do stand up for these people nowadays. Most European countries are protectors of all of their citizens, no matter their ethnic background. Even if there are plenty of hiccups, it's not a *standard* anymore to openly discriminate against any ethnic group based on their ethnicity alone. I'm glad we've come so far.

Due to a lower education rate and general isolationist tendencies among the Romani people, I'm saddened to say many stories from this holocaust will remain untold, and many secrets will be and have already been taken to the grave. I don't know if we can change that in any way, but gathering testimonies and writing down any story, no matter how small, will contribute to the world not making the same mistakes ever again.

I see plenty of people talking about ""assimilating"" of the Romani, but in the EU, even a nomadic lifestyle is acceptable if it's within the means of the law... the only thing the Romani need, just like anybody else, is a proper education. An expansion of one's horizons, teaching a man ""how to fish"", is a sure way out of isolation and poverty. The more they can explore the world on their own, the more we will see the best of the Romani people, hear their stories and feel what they feel. Even though they may roam the lands freely, many Romani are still in their own little prison.

Neat fact for me: one commemoration event is being held in Niš, Serbia:

&gt;**Red Cross Concentration Camp, Crveski Krst, Niš, Serbia**

&gt;Organiser: Reconstruction Women’s Fund

&gt;Reconstruction Women’s Fund runs a programme entitled „Mirror“ that aims at supporting associated young women to actively participate in decision making that affects their lives. As part of this programme, „Indigo“ Group for Children and Youth in partnership with Terra del Fuoco organises the project „Step In – Step Out“, a summer camp with 30 youth, Roma and non-Roma from Italy and Serbia, in Niš (2-6 August 2014). Within the summer camp, participants will commemorate 2 August at the Red Cross Concentration Camp, they will also visit the Roma and Jewish Cemetery, Roma cult place Zajdebaca, and Bubanj, and will learn about the project ‘Train of Memory’ organized by Terra del Fuoco for Italian students to learn about the Holocaust.

Wait, what?  Do you not consider Athens at the end of the fifth century BC to be a direct democracy?  Or do you not consider the battle of Melos of 415 to be an act of war?

I think, in the context of the EU versus Switzerland, one should do well to remind oneself of this [particular incident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melian_dialogue) of the Peloponnesian war, because it should provide food for thought to every side of the argument: Melos *wanted to remain neutral* in the conflict between Athens and Sparta.  Athens flatly said that they could not: that they should either submit, pay a tribute, or be destroyed; the Athenian orators didn't try to make their decision sound just, fair or equitable: they were doing it because they were the stronger force.  The Athenians' vote was unquestionably democratic, and nearly unanimous.  All valid Melian males were massacred, and the women and children were sold into slavery.  What can we learn from this?

I've heard that argument so many times. Just because some members of a culture go out of their way to show everyone around them that they are part of that group doesn't mean that they are representative of that group or culture in any shape or form. It's the same with the internet. Everyone on the internet is an asshole? Maybe the assholes are just more vocal.

There are many Sinti and Roma groups that speak out against abuse of the social systems (e.g. Zentralrat Deutscher Sinti und Roma in Germany). Most Sinti and Roma are citizens of the EU and their respective country they live in, not immigrants. Judging people on the way they talk, look and dress is also not the best way to solve social issuses.

edit:

A thing or two about the lack of work. A cultural leaning agains employment might be a reason for the high unemployment rates (about 50% in countries with high Sinti and Roma populations, much less in other countries), but I don't see it as a bigger course than poverty in itself. And a will to not work is a bold statement when you suddenly see high child labor numbers in the Sinti and Roma communities (up to 10% in Romania). Between 30 and 60% of Roma job seekers have encountered racism against them during their job interview, which doesn't help much in finding one. Most Sinti and Roma lack a basic education and states fail to show interest in motivating parents to send their kids to school. In Greece 30% of Roma children don't attend school while the rate in Slovakia a higher percantage of Roma go to school than non-Roma. If you didn't notice it, we have an extremely poor minority that encounters hate and racism on a daily basis and has at the moment no chance in landing a job that puts them above the poverty line.

Stop acting like ranting about that one minority makes the situation better for anyone. It doesn't. The EU member states have to figure out how to solve the many social issues over an extended period of time, not avoiding it until someone else comes along.

true,Pianopatte,GERM,Germany,"&gt;Juan Linz, whose 1964 description of authoritarianism is influential,characterized authoritarian regimes as political systems by four qualities: (1) ""limited, not responsible, political pluralism""; that is, constraints on political institutions and groups (such as legislatures, political parties and interest groups), (2**) a basis for legitimacy based on emotion, especially the identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat ""easily recognizable societal problems"" such as underdevelopment or insurgency;** (3) neither ""intensive nor extensive political mobilization"" and constraints on the mass public (such as repressive tactics against opponents and a prohibition of anti-regime activity) and (4) ""formally ill-defined"" executive power, often shifting or vague.

Here an excerpt from the the wiki page since you seem to have failed to read it. The bold sentence means that whenever a authoritarian government deems something in its country as problem it will take the legitimacy to act on it not by law like a democracy but solely by emotion. Even simpler: If the Singaporean government sees its current economic policies as problematic it will do whatever it wants to change them.

You might say that the current system is perfect but a later Singaporean government might see it totally different.

As far as jobs go, what do you want to do with your qualification? While most people here speak decent to good English, everyday life happens in our native tongue and if you're not working in specific fields (such as certain IT or logistics ones for example) you'll need to know German - pretty much wherever you have to deal with people. 

You should ask yourself how much you actually know about this place and consider visiting with that in mind (""interviewing the country""). Being US citizens, you could potentially switch your 3mo tourist visa to a Blue Card should you find a job (which is unlikely in three months). You might also want to find out where you'd end up and check what job options you have (monster.de is one of the big sites but there are tons more) as the Blue Card is tied to a minimum salary.

So my recommendation: 

Come for a visit (if you want to stay and find a job that's fine)

Ask the folks at r/iwantout, they might have some good advice also

&gt;Preschool coverage for Roma children in South-Eastern Europe (SEE ) is low, ranging from 0.2 per cent in Kosovo13 to 
17 per cent in Romania.14 This lack of access has been identified by the Roma NGOs as a major contributing factor 
in the educational failure of Roma across the region. According to World Bank data, educational enrolment in CSEE
among primary-school age Roma children is on average a quarter of the corresponding rate for non-Roma children.15
In South-Eastern Europe, gaps in enrolment are the greatest in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, 
ranging from 45 to 50 per cent. Some 20 per cent of Roma children in Bulgaria and 33 per cent in Serbia never go to school.16 Moreover, even if they gain access to primary school, drop-out rates are high. In Slovakia, Roma 
children are 30 times more likely to abandon school than the rest of the population, and in Bulgaria, most of the 
45,000 students who drop out annually are of Roma ethnicity. According to recent multiple indicator cluster surveys, 
of the 63 per cent of Roma children who enter primary school in the the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
only 45 per cent complete it; in Serbia, only 13 per cent of Roma complete primary school.17 A survey conducted by 
the United Nations Development Programme (UND P) found that two out of three Roma do not complete primary 
school, as compared with one in seven in majority communities.18 Declining participation begins at the primary level, 
with enrolment between cohorts decreasing, whereas there is little or no decline for the non-Roma population.

It's also worth noting that many Roma believe it is their right to steal with impunity because one of them spared Jesus a nail on the cross:

Die Hamas geht nicht zimperlich um mit ihren Gegnern. Es ist ziemlich gefährlich, gegen sie zu demonstrieren, wenn man in ihrem Herrschaftsbereich lebt. Man wird schnell als ""Verräter"" oder ""zionistischer Agent"" umgebracht, oder schlimmeres. In Israel kann man als Staatsbürger gegen die Regierung demonstrieren, ohne solche extremen Repressalien zu fürchten.

Soweit ich mitgekriegt habe ist die Hamas derzeit aber in vielen arabischen Ländern ziemlich unten durch, vor allem Ägypten, wo es ja vor nicht allzu langer Zeit eine Revolution gegen die Muslimbruderschaft gab (deren palästinensischer Ableger die Hamas ist).

Diaspora-Palästinenser &amp; pro-palästinensische Muslime in Europa wiederum müssen nicht unter der Hamas-Diktatur leben, und manche unter ihnen haben sicher romantisierte Vorstellungen von Hamas.Sie blenden alles aus, was nicht ins Bild passt, also auch dass Hamas keine Rücksicht nimmt, wenn sie durch Brechen des Waffenstillstandes weitere tote palästinensische Zivilisten mitverantworten. Und bei anderen wiederum liegt Antipathie gegenüber Hamas vor, aber sie sind zu empört über Israels Kriegsführung und sehen diese als Hauptursache für das aktuelle Leiden in Gaza. Dazu auch sicherlich in Europa Druck durch die eigene Community, kein ""Verräter"" zu sein, ein Verdacht der leicht entstehen kann, wenn man allzu sehr Hamas kritisiert und dadurch gar manche pro-israelische Position zu legitimieren scheint.

**3)** Slim to none (right now/the next 5-10 years) for a number of reasons, the obvious one being legislative alignment outside of the Copenhagen Criteria, but the real issue is the size of Turkey - Turkey would hold massive influence in the EU due to it's population and could effectively change the whole dynamic in both the parliament and the commission. Especially with the former point in mind, I think most europeans are not quite sure to make of Turkeys policies and see them going in completely different directions than the ones we agree on in the EU. The demonstrations that turned ugly last year was also a clear sign of a country that is not at all in agreement with itself and the direction it is going forward. If Turkey was in a more stable place politically and socially, it could happen, sure.

**4)** Perhaps out of ignorance, I actually thought until about a year ago, that Erdogan was somewhat secular, especially compared to his opposition at the time - It's probably just me not following it close enough but it seems to me like there was a transformation with him at some point on this issue. He got pretty unpopular here during the times with the riots in Gezi Park and the crackdown on media and social media that followed. Most turkish people that live here are not big fans of him at all.

**5)** He was a great man, I can only imagine what it would be like to have our nations ""creator"" live only a few generations ago. I guess I can sort of understand the conservatives in Turkey distancing themselves from him, since he did ""europeanize"" the country quite dramaticly (calendar, alphabet etc.) and they now feel like they lost something along the way. I don't agree with them per se, but I can sort of understand where they are coming from, especially now since Turkeys admission to the EU has been rejected quite a few times by now. He did indisputably introduce democracy into the middle east and managed to wield the power gently yet firmly - a rare balance and is still to this day an example that other countries can aspire to.

true,Bobo-_-,NETH,The Netherlands," In my opinion the best solution for BiH and all the former Republics of Yugoslavia is to join the EU. This will ease alot of tension, and make it easier for people to return to there former homes.

If they really want it so bad then let all the people who lived prewar in the so called republika Sprka vote, if they get a 75% majority im oke with it. Assuming that the ones who died because of the war are against it. And the ones who are living in the region because the had to flee a other part of the former Yugoslavia cant vote, i don't see this happening.
 
The Serbs in Bosnia must not forget that Dayton was and still is a pretty good deal, had the not stopped with fighting and negotiate there would have been no Republika Sprska and a lot less Serbs in BiH. The Serbs forces in Bosnia were a few weeks/months away from total defeat. the Croatian and Bosnian forces were 15km from Banja Luka. NATO stopped then and the Serbs joined the negotiating table.

BiH's, and to a lesser all the former republics of Yugoslavia's biggest problem is corruption and personal political interest. People at the top do not want change, because it will probably mean they will lose there power and money. 

Ethnic tension was not the only problem Yugoslavia had prewar. It had a huge debt and needed economical reform to become a viable economy, this would mean cutting the social programs and a host of other unpopular measures, this was something the political elite in Yugoslavia did not want to do.

true,gtk_gg,Normandie,Normandie,"Bonjour !

The general theme, a double tower castle-town with a crowned fleur-de-lys could be a pointer toward Angoulême. Angoulême was under german occupation, but it's not really a small village, with a population of ~40,000 people during the war (not counting the neighboring dependent town).

However, if you watch a little closer, you can see that the crown is somewhat out of the coat of arm. I highlighted it [here](http://imgur.com/sigskvq).
I mention it, because the fleur-de-lys on top of [a double tower-castle](http://vexil.prov.free.fr/coursegoules/Gr%E9oli%E8res.png) without a crown, is the symbol of a really small french village, in the south-east: [Gréolières](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Gr%C3%A9oli%C3%A8res/@44.2271295,8.1929085,8z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x12cc30afacc4d139:0x40819a5fd979b90), but that one was under Italian occupation.

I should also mentioned that this theme (although, with a small crown) appears in a composed coat of arm of another village, in Gironde (south-west), near Bordeaux this time: [Cavignac](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Blason_Cavignac_%28Gironde%29.svg) (bottom right). Cavignac (and all of the French Atlantic Coast) was under german occupation.

Sorry I cannot help you more at this time, it's getting pretty late here, but you might have more luck by googling for some french groups/forums that study ""Héraldique"" (French for Heraldry, the study of coat-of-arms) and post your question there, or checking out /r/heraldry, as thompsonandthompson mentionned, it does exist, but not sure if it is really that active...

true,NotInMyGarden,null,null,"Il n'y a pas de mots assez forts pour qualifier l'incommensurable absurdité, pour rester poli, que représente l'existence même des péages.


La vision étriquée et court-termiste du problème, trop souvent rabâchée, c'est ""il faut bien financer les infrastructures"". Argument invalide. Si on prend de la hauteur, on voit que:


- Un péage est une infrastructure très coûteuse, servant **uniquement** à transférer l'argent d'une poche à une autre. Donc dans sa globalité, la société y perd. Ce seul argument devrait mettre fin à toute discussion, mais continuons.


- Un péage n'est pas seulement un non-sens économique, il est aussi un non-sens pratique: bouchons, perte de temps, proportion à être accidentogène.


- Mais c'est également un non-sens écologique: on ralentit, on accélère. Il faut l'éclairer, l'entretenir...


- Et du point de vue de la sécurité routière. Les péages dissuadent les gens les moins riches de prendre les routes les plus sûres. Sympas.


- ""Oui mais ça crée des emplois"". Non, tout emploi non créateur de richesse détruit de l'emploi par ailleurs, voir le ""Sophisme de la vitre cassée"".


- ""Oui mais il faut bien financer l'entretient des autoroutes"": balivernes. L'entretient est une volonté politique et n'a rien à voir avec la choucroute. Il se trouve que pour le moment, les sociétés d'autoroutes soignent l'entretient pour ne pas perdre leur poule aux oeufs d'or. Les autoroutes peuvent être ""gratuites"" et bien entretenus dans certains pays, voire certaines parties de la France (exemple en région Lyonnaise).


- Le fait de devoir coller un péage à chaque entrée/sortie limite bêtement leur nombre.


- Les péages sont arbitraires et introduisent une distorsion. Pourquoi l'autoroute se paye au prix fort, alors que la route nationale est 100% gratuite. Effet pervers, le fameux problème des camions qui pourrissent le réseau secondaire et la vie des riverains pour éviter les péages. Argument qui a poussé l'introduction de... l'écotaxe. ""Les péages sont un problème ? bah, on n'a qu'à rajouter des péages"" (problem ?).


- Ils sont un frein à la mobilité, et donc à l'activité économique, la vie des travailleurs et de leur famille. On voit ce que ""rapportent"" les péages. Ce qu'on ne voit pas, c'est ce qu'ils coûtent par leurs effets pervers sur l'économie, et donc indirectement sur les rentrées fiscales. La France est compétitive face aux pays émergents grâce à ses réseaux routier et télécom, il ne faut pas les pénaliser.


- Ils sont un désastre sur le **logement** et la mobilité face à l'emploi, donc le **chômage**, LES deux plus gros problèmes en France actuellement. Pourquoi ? Parce que les péages sont un facteur de tension sur les prix de l'immobilier proche agglomérations. En gros on force les gens à rester locataires (donc ""pauvres""), entretenant cette autre absurdité française.


- ""Oui mais il faut punir la voiture, c'est pas écologique, il faut prendre le train"". Degré zéro de l'argumentation écolo niveau militant lycéen. La vie réelle est plus compliqué que ça, on n'aura jamais une gare devant chaque quartier. Et puis, on interdira les grèves ? L'avenir est au transport individuel non polluant et aux voitures qui se conduisent seules. Le train, c'est bon pour le fret.


- Les péages sont une perversion même de l'idée de service publique. On puni le travailleur, mais celui qui profite le plus des autoroutes, n'est-ce pas celui qui n'a jamais à les emprunter ? 


- Enfin, attention danger ! accepter les péages, c'est ouvrir un jour la porte à une ""écotaxe"" implantée sur 100% du réseau secondaire, s'appliquant à tous les véhicules. Ne jamais oublier qu'une taxe est toujours introduite progressivement.

The definition of the term genocide within the CPPCG is:



&gt;    Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Article II:  
&gt;
&gt; ...any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
&gt; 
&gt;         (a) Killing members of the group;
&gt;         (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
&gt;         (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
&gt;         (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
&gt;         (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
&gt; 
&gt;     — Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Article II

In no way whatsoever is it necessary for the population to actually decline. In fact, the article states that ""any [...] act"" mentioned is commiting genocide, as long as the intent is to destroy, even if only in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.

Israel has, without maybe lit. (d), fulfilled all the acts mentiond in the CPPCG, even though only one has to be committed, so as to be counted as genocide. And while having committed pretty much any form of genocide there is, you are still saying that the acts of Israel are not genocide?

The EU has only succeeded elsewhere through an amazing amount of lying about the true goals of the project. If the EU had been proposed to the UK as a political union back in the 1970s the chance of the UK joining would have been zero (or rather the chance of the UK leaving would have been 100%, let's not forget the UK was taken in without a vote by people who knew it was a political union). As the project is further along now it's getting harder and harder to disguise it as a peace project or just a trade zone, it's obviously a massive political union that's going to require taxation powers to administer the common currency.   

So at this point the Norwegian political class are stuck because they can't win a referendum on that basis. They didn't join early enough when the lies had more traction, but if they join without a referendum at this point it will be obvious that they will basically be ending the country without having asked the people.

true,OnkelMickwald,SWED,But a simple lad from Sweden,"&gt;Long answer: Homosexuality was once socially unacceptable and thus it was punishable. It became socially unacceptable due to multiple reasons and thus it was no longer punishable.

That's my point, why should my individual freedoms be at the whim of the majority? This is more of a question of principle for me, either you let the majority decide for the rest what's okay and what isn't, *or* you have a base set of rights that not even the majority can affect, no matter how much they hate it.

&gt;So, individual rights should be guarded and protected. Why aren't you protecting/guarding my right to threaten someone with death?

&gt;There's a boundary of individual freedom that should be guarded, and that boundary stops at displaying ISIS flags.

Displaying an ISIS flag is legally and logically not a death threat, and saying that it is *kind of* a death threat since ISIS are extremists is not a proper motivation. The problem is also that you assume that there's always an easy answer to what is extremism and what isn't. People in Europe are already pointing fingers to the left and right and identifying ""fascists"" sometimes amongst the ranks of nationalists, sometimes islamists, sometimes left-wingers. This is a dangerous development. What happens when a relatively large nationalist movement - say the BNP in the UK for instance - is labeled ""extremists""? Then the voice of a relatively large portion of society becomes silenced just because the majority is uncomfortable with their opinions.

And what if we turn the scenario around, and nationalist hardliners all across Europe gain more ground and *they* start deciding what is extremism and what's not? I could easily imagine the Feminist party of Sweden being labeled ""extremist"" by a hard-line nationalist movement, and so would many of the far left-wing parties.

And will it stop there? How do we know that the definition of ""extremism"" won't start to creep into the political mainstream? Aren't the Social Democrats of Sweden extremists in the eyes of nationalists because of their vigorous defense of a liberal immigration policy and opinion that nationality and ethnicity are nothing but social constructs?",0,1407047635,null,0,false,0,cjfihxj,t3_2cf44e,t1_cjfihxj,t1_cjf0cb4,null,1435042868,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt; You, the taxpayer, are shelling out £700 million to Fujitsu in a case so egregious that even the BBC reported it. 

You realize when states are parties to a contract they can be sued right? [Here is the article on the Fujitsu](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-28464002) case. It says nothing about an investor-state dispute clause or even a free-trade agreement for that matter. 

Also, Japan and the EU do not have a finalized free-trade agreement in place, so it is likely there is no investor state dispute clause or free trade agreement governing this dispute. It is a simple contract case.

In the Canadian case, the paper company closed down a plant, and the Government of Newfoundland immediately [expropriated the company's assets](http://www.thecourt.ca/2010/08/27/canada-settles-abitibibowaters-nafta-claim/) in the entire province, worth roughly $300 million.

&gt;Less than two weeks after the final closure was announced the province rushed through the Abitibi-Consolidated Rights and Assets Act, S.N.L. 2008, c. A-1.01 (“Abitibi Act”), which expropriated the majority of the company’s provincial assets. In part, this canceled water and hydroelectric contracts and agreements between the province and Abitibi, ongoing legal proceedings Abitibi had against the province, and **blocked Abitibi’s access to Newfoundland’s courts.**

Given the government of Newfoundland was acting like Hugo Chavez, it seems like a legitimate arbitration request. Especially because the law blocked the company's access to the court system so it was precluded from getting a local remedy and had to sue under an external framework. What Newfoundland did was very third-wordesq. It seems like the company was short changed given it was only awarded $122 million out of $300 million in disputed assets. 

That said, the company could have very likely sued anyway even without NAFTA. WTO regulations prohibit uncompensated nationalizations. The EU [threatened to sue Argentina](http://www.ibtimes.com/eu-threatens-wto-suit-against-argentina-over-trade-restrictions-oil-nationalization-692908) over illegal nationalizations under WTO rules. WTO rules are also why Yukos shareholders were recently awarded [$50 billion](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/business/international/yukos-shareholders-awarded-about-50-billion-in-court-ruling.html?_r=0). Under WTO rules, the Russian government takeover was considered an illegal nationalization. 

So you are essentially posting inflammatory headlines blaming free trade agreements and investor-state dispute clauses for something something they had no affect on. Many people are doing this as of late. 

Can you please explain how a free trade agreement played a part in the Fujitsu case? To me it seems like a contractual issue. Can you also explain how the Canadian company's rights would not exist under WTO regulations so the only recourse was through NAFTA? Either I am missing something here or you only posted inflammatory headlines that really have nothing to do with free trade agreements.

In my experience, though, when Italians discuss the man with foreigners, they are desperate to get  at least two major points across: 

1. No, Berlusconi did NOT win every election since 1994. He was not prime minister for 20 years straight. He's won three  general elections and he's lost three or four. It's amazing how many people ignore this. 

2. Most Italians do NOT vote for him, and in fact the vast majority of Italians do hate the guy. Those 80% who doesn't vote for him, for the most part, really do dislike him. So saying ""Italy fell under the spell of B."", ""Italy loves B."", ""Italy can't see what a corrupt asshole B. is"", etc, is at least misleading and really paints the wrong picture about the general consensus of the population on the matter of B. 

So really, it's not about 'true and false' here, as much as it is a matter of emphasis: there's this notion that the whole Italian population has been bewitched by this magic piper, that we've been hypnotized and that we, unlike the rest of the world, fail to see how incompetent and corrupt this person is. And this, even with all his electoral success, simply isn't true.

When there are so many different people saying THEIR interpretation of the Bible is right, and nobody can prove anything, I think it's pretty clear that trying to figure out who's right is waste of time.

They just had no reason to as there wasn't anything of value there that they knew of. 

Roman wars were waged for money, and no general or emperor would embark on a campaign where he didn't think he could become fabulously wealthy as a result. That's why for example major slave rebellions took so long to put down -- no general and legions really wanted to go fight a battle that would end in little glory (killing slaves isn't special) with no chance of making any money (they couldn't take slaves since rebelling as a slave was a capital offense and they couldn't plunder their own territory). 

This actually explains really well why they moved so aggressively into Greek-speaking lands and went for Pontus, Syria, Egypt, etc. with so much dedication. In an economy powered by conquest you go where you can make the most money. 

Only Persia and India were known to Romans as wealthy lands that they couldn't really attempt to conquer, for a combination of logistical and tactical reasons. Both were far away from the biggest population centers in the Empire, both fought in ways the traditional Roman heavy infantry could not challenge, and both had large organised armies of their own. Horse archers, cataphracts, and huge Indian elephants are pretty damn awesome.

true,Zilvervos,NETH,The Netherlands / Turkey,"1) I love Turkey. I moved to Istanbul a year ago from The Netherlands, and I much prefer living here now than in The Netherlands. I also like to travel around a lot in Turkey and am amazed how different each city/area can be. Just got back from a road trip in the southeast and it's like visiting a different country. 

2) In general Turks are really friendly and hospitable especially compared to the Dutch. However I must say that I (obviously) hang around in Istanbul and all my friends are progressive/openminded. I don't want to make general assumptions about all Turks, and as with all places there's enough assholes here too. The only things I sometimes take issue with is that Turks prefer not too be direct if it offends people, pretty much the complete opposite of Dutch social conventions, but tis is not their fault of course, just a cultural difference which I am used to now, but it took a while. 

3) as others have said in the comments this will probably not happen anytime soon. in my opinion this country is too big and diverse for it to even work culturally. Sure (most of) the Turks from the westcoast of Turkey are pretty much the same as any other European but go to Anatolia and there are masses of people that think quite differently and I don't see that fitting in with Europe (not saying it's a good or a bad thing, just stating an observation) 

4) I am incredibly biased here having moved to Istanbul about a month before the Gezi protests happened, not being able to use certain rooms in my house because the gas would make it unbearable and almost having been arrested for no reason. However would this not have happened I would still think that politics/democracy are a joke here. To compare it to the Netherlands (not that everything is so great there, but it's my only reference) if a scandal like this would happen there the people involved would probably resign themselves or the cabinet would fall and there would be new elections ASAP. Seriously to me it's a big joke, but it's cute that they try the democracy thing. 

5) Sure he's done a lot of good for the country, but the man is definitely not a saint. What boggles my mind though is that a lot of people adore him like a god. This is definitely a cultural difference as well, in The Netherlands such a thing doesn't exist and would be quite awkward. Sometimes it feels like walking around in a dystopian movie with all the pictures and sometimes complete building covering banners of him around. Same goes for Erdoğan though (but it's election season now, so it is to be expected) 

still, even though a lot of things are quite messed up in Turkey I still love the place and will probably not leave anytime soon. I'll probably not live in Istanbul for the rest of my life since this city will wear you down, but moving somewhere to the south and just chill the fuck out is a really viable option.

Anyway, coming back to our subject, the idea that Gaudi would be appalled to see himself associated to a ""Spanish symbol"" like the bull is, to start with, highly anachronistic: regardless of how hispanophobic Gaudi's catalanism actually was (and it is telling that you choose Gaudi, since the loss of his personal papers in the 1936 makes him a very convenient figure to claim without risk of being contradicted by any document), back in his lifetime the bull was **not** perceived as a ""Spanish symbol"" (which explains how Pere Mila could conciliate being a Catalan nationalist and a bullfighting impresario). Although bullfighting had been previously pictured by Goya and used by Mérimée as a touch of ""local colour"" in ""Carmen"", it was simply perceived, in the whole Iberian peninsula and Southern France, as popular entertainment. It wasn't until after Gaudi's death in 1924, by the late 1920s and 1930s, that a handful of authors and artists, mainly Garcia Lorca, Hemingway and Picasso (none of them suspect of Francoist sympathies), started celebrating bullfighting as something uniquely significant and Spanish. And still then, the bull didn't start to be seen as a national symbol until the 1960s, with the [Osborne bull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_bull), while the propaganda apparatus of the Franco regime, under the rather intelligent Manuel Fraga, promoted bulls and bullfighting as a symbol of Spain just *because* it was then popular throughout the whole of Spain (Catalonia and Basque Country emphatically included), regardless of political sympathies.

Ironically, it was the rampant urbanisation of Spain started at the same time that will ultimately condemn bullfighting: strangely enough, urbanites seem to care more about animal rights the less we are in contact with animals, and what was popular in the rural Spain of the 1950s can no longer stay so today. As a result, bullfighting is now the preserve of old, conservative men, and will be buried with them. Catalonia has only been the start.

Ironically, the only thing that can keep it alive is if you guys turn it into a bone of contention: already you seem to have given that banshee Esperanza Aguirre and her friends some bad, bad ideas.

So from what I gather what you are trying to say is that we should alter our system of rule of law, because a small minority of people think differently than 'we' do? Suppression of political organisations is unfavourable and the Dutch recognise this (that's why these people have all freedom to protest); things will just go underground and will potentially become more of a mess if forbidden.

There are certain boundaries one must practice, however. If a political organisation promotes the annihilation of a certain people (and readily chant this during their protest: ""kill all jews"" - and it isn't just jews, mind you; Muslims that aren't Sunni also need to be destroyed, let alone heathens - and that's just the manifestation of the organisation we see within our borders - in other countries this organisation is much, much worse) then that is promotion of violence (especially if you consider that the organisation that these people champion is actually killing people right now on the basis of those tenets). A symbol that represents such a movement can cause a lot of distress in a society (as it does here); same goes for Nazi symbolism. Flying far-right symbolism is prohibited by law in the Netherlands for the distress it causes (not to shut people up) and the ISIS flag is just that - it's very contemporary, it's very painful, it represents an ideology that is meant to incite hatred and moves people to use violence. We make rules to keep society civil: some of them ensure freedom of speech is not impinged upon, some of them prohibit certain symbolism for its implications - at times these rules might conflict. We have the rule of law to ensure that if a person feels that this is the case he/she might bring her case before an independent judiciary to see what is in the public interest.",0,1407055239,null,0,1407055727,0,cjfk9bl,t3_2cf44e,t1_cjfk9bl,t1_cjf4ifr,null,1435043636,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Compare it to racial, sexual, and other forms of discrimination.

&gt;The so-called ""law on bloggers"" forces any website that publishes posts or articles that receive more than 3,000 readers each day to register with the government.

...

&gt;Bloggers will now be held to the same standard of mass media outlets: Writers are forbidden from using foul language and spreading false information. The punishment for violating this rule is much more stringent than it is for mass media broadcasters: Violators make themselves vulnerable to a fine of between 10,000 and 50,000 rubles (US $285-$855) and blacklisting from the Russian Internet.

It's not a law that ""forces Putin critics to provide home address"", it forces **every** blogger with certain amount of visitors to **register with the government**.

 The idea of the law seems reasonable to me -- any outlet that has a certain amount of visitors should be held to the same standards as regular media outlets. Now, what those standards should be is open to debate.

I don't really agree with some aspects of the law, e.g. harsher punishments for bloggers than for regular media and, sure, the law **could** be and it's very likely that it will be used in some way to suppress critics, even if it is just through fear of de-anonymization, but that doesn't mean the law is specifically targeting ""Putin critics"" as the very editorialized title suggests.

Reddit has taught me that redditors, like a lot of other people, often just read the title and presume what's in the rest of the article without reading, and so shape the image of the subject that is based on incomplete or even false information.

That's why we shouldn't encourage posting articles with editorialized titles.

Masses in general don't act in their best interests. The average Joe wont be an expert in politics, economics, medicine, hell - anywhere.

While politicians' job is to act on behalf of their voters, the voters themselves are busy with their own lives and obviously wouldn't be able to make an educated decision on every aspect of their country. And how could they - the average Joe is not a doctor, nor an economist, nor a scientist - he (she) is just an average person at best an expert just in a relatively narrow industry and at worst someone who thinks he is an expert.

So let's allow people to censor racially identifying information from the internet and their CVs. Surely that will solve the underlying problem!

Obviously, no. The problem is that there is prejudice towards that group in the first place, not that people can tell you can belong to that group. If prejudice against a group is unwanted, find a way to remove or compensate for that prejudice, rather than ask the prejudiced-against to hide part of themselves.

You just made those dead soldiers a ""card"". 

&gt;Is that what we should be expecting for any future wars we may fight together? 

From the all deaths 90% were civilians. And in the question of Europe vs. Russia, no. The death toll will be 90% Europeans (Russia is Europe). 

Europe has might and formidable military forces. Poland it self can mobilize over 600.000 strong Army. EU has over 550 million people, Russia is 110 million. And this isn't some 3rd world country area we are talking about. The technical and other advance west has is big against Russia. Russia is no where near the old USSR military strength, it is still using that era equipment, artillery, tanks etc. Not to mention aircraft etc.

The thing is that European NATO countries who don't have that 2% military spending, they are already rapidly lifting that up. But it's also a very marginal question at the moment, it doesn't solve anything. The real thing is that NATO needs to be united and stop having these quite annoying dilemmas like NSA and other shit. But also there is people who love to see NATO/EU being a quarrelling bunch of individual, selfish nations. And those are mainly in Russia and China.

true,doomblackdeath,null,null,"And yes, the real problem in Italy today is, well, old people. They're resistant to change, have no knowledge of how the world works outside of Italy other than hearsay, and live in a perpetual 1960's Italy mentality. The average age in Italy is around 50, I believe, so as you can see they have a huge voice in elections. The blame for Italy's economic problems today can largely be laid squarely at their feet; they were born after WW2 and retired around the 2000s. They lived in the most prosperous era of Italy in modern times and quite literally screwed it up for the next two or three generations with their belief that contratti indeterminati and growth-strangling unions are a good thing. They have no idea what a meritocracy is, only that their entire life's ambition is to have the same job with the same pay for 40 years and then retire with complete job security. 

The answer is, frankly, more old people need to die more often in order for there to be any real change in Italy. As an American who has lived here for the past ten years, I have seen the pros and cons of both countries, and I can say that the only thing holding Italy back is Italians themselves and their unwillingness to embrace change, at least the older majority.

For the most part they primarily speak French, even among each other (probably the *biggest* factor in being seen as ""French"", as per France's emphasis on exporting French culture to her colonies by encouraging residents of those colonies to speak French), wear French clothes (especially Lacoste, ironically enough!), enjoy French activities, French TV, French sports, and (aside from the occasional kebab, merguez, kouskous) French food. 

The problem of crime in the banlieues isn't a new one - Victor Hugo wrote nearly all his novels about the miserable life of criminality in the faubourgs in the 1800s. It's just a new face on an old problem. That said, there is a tendency to associate the huge crime rates in immigrant communities with Islam. I'm not fan of Islam, TBH, and I hate to see truly extremist communities (like in the UK) growing...but I think this is false. The gang mentality, the racaille mindset that dominates young people in the banlieues, is not a Muslim trait - maybe Arab, but definitely not Muslim. As SpanishNinjitsu said above, it's a socioeconomic phenomenon, not a religious one. 

This isn't to say that there isn't a growing shift towards identifying as Muslim first, French second, especially among the youth, and actively rejecting elements of French culture. But I feel that this is a pretty recent trend. For the past 20 years, when all this talk about ""integration"" was really just beginning (since the 2nd and 3rd generations of Muslim immigrants were just beginning to hit their teens in those years), French Muslims - while overwhelmingly poor, and therefore located in a very different social class than most white French - were much more ""integrated"" than anyone in France would like to admit. While I congratulate the French for building a much more open society than any other European country, and despite what critics of French policy say, doing a great (maybe even too good) job of welcoming immigrants and encouraging their ""integration"", I think it's a self-fulfilling prophecy - the more both the white French and the Muslims emphasize exaggerated differences and the perceived incompatibility of their societies, the more the Muslims are drawn to foreign concepts and interpretations of Islam which *are* in fact completely incompatible with French society (salafism, etc.).

TL;DR French Muslims have integrated fine in the past, and it's much deeper and more complicated issues within French society that have caused the split between Muslims and the French.",1,1407062563,null,0,1407062918,0,cjfljx8,t3_2chc2m,t1_cjfljx8,t3_2chc2m,null,1435044246,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

We have a base set of rights not even the majority can effect. Displaying ISIS flags isn't one of those.

&gt; Displaying an ISIS flag is legally and logically not a death threat, and saying that it is kind of a death threat since ISIS are extremists is not a proper motivation.

We think it is proper motivation.

&gt; The problem is also that you assume that there's always an easy answer to what is extremism and what isn't.

No, I don't. That's your assumption.

&gt; And what if we turn the scenario around, and nationalist hardliners all across Europe gain more ground and they start deciding what is extremism and what's not?

I would be against it, but if the majority is truly in favour of those nationalist hard-liners there's little I can do. In a perfect world, the majority will never have the last say. But sadly this world isn't perfect. Every political thing, will somewhat be influenced by the majority, whether you like it or not.

&gt; And will it stop there? How do we know that the definition of ""extremism"" won't start to creep into the political mainstream?

Now you're just creating scenario's that would never happen anyway and call upon them as arguments. 

Extremism is a subjective word. It's meaning can thus only be decided by the majority. So if we're talking about words like 'extremism', the majority will always have the final say.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcher halbwegs geistig gesunde Mensch würde Anlagen einer ""Bank"" kaufen, 

die zehn Jahre vorher schon mal Pleite gemacht hat, explizit um unliebsame Anlagen durch die Insolvenz los zu werden,

übrigens Spott billig  zu 20% des Nennwertes IIRC, eben genau wegen der letzten Insolvenz/der absehbaren Nächsten,

und dann erwarten, dass er nicht nur übliche 30%, nicht nur exorbitante 65%, sondern volle 100% des Nennwertes bekommt. Was dazu führen würde, das ALLE Anderen ebenfalls zu 100% ausgezahlt werden müssten.

Als einziger Anleger mit ungefähr 1% aller Anlagen. (Und das sind bereits beide Geier zusammen.)

Wer die richtigen Werte hat möge sie gern posten.

Fakt ist: selbst mit den 30% der Einigung, die 99% aller anderen Anleger akzeptiert haben, würden die Geier FETTE Gewinne machen.

=&gt; Jetzt die Insolvenz zu fordern ist einfach ein Arschlochzug reinster Gier und ich hoffe sie bekommen GAR NICHTS.

DAS ist der echte Kapitalismus, wo Spieler die zu hoch pokern eben verlieren. So einfach ist das.",0,1407063117,null,0,1407063505,0,cjflnen,t3_2chm5y,t1_cjflnen,t3_2chm5y,null,1435044293,2,false,de,t5_22i0,2

true,FF-TT,null,null,"As a French-born Arab Muslim, or ""French Muslim"", I've personally never integrated or even felt french a second of my life. While traveling abroad (US, Canada, Asia) I've always said I'm from my parents' country (which is incidentally mine). Even in France I tell, when asked, that I'm from North Africa.

Why?

1) Politically and on the media, there is a constant bashing and Muslims are stigmatized 24/7. This has led (or maybe the other way around) the society to be extremely suspicious and intolerant towards the Muslim population in France. In my University and Engineering School I've been boldy told by professors to NOT speak arabic on the school campus, because ""people didn't like that"". Notice they didn't tell me ""not in class"" (which would be normal) but on the school campus. What if I was speaking in English or German?

2) France has a horrible colonial past. The french state and army massacred literally millions of West and North-Africans. Even though France recognize the Armenian genocide, the horrible actions of Vichy's regime during the Nazi occupation, they don't want to recognize the massacres, tortures they did to our ancestors. Why the difference? Are we subhumans?

3) If having a college degree, working and paying taxes is being integrated, you have countless of integrated Muslims. Personally I don't think that's integration. The overwhelming majority of my educated Muslim friends (University degree, Engineering degree, PhD) do not feel french, do not mix with them, and to some extent seek expatriation. I have noticed the ones in UK/Holland/Scandinavia, while they see some of the problems that are in France (ghettos, stigmas), also feel definitely more respected and better treated in those countries.

I think the main problem is social (low class ghetto people that struggle to climb the social ladder), however the cultural suspicion/xenophobia of the french society and furthermore France's past might have something to do with it too.

Just think about it: why do you think it was always males who fought all battles? Was it because they were stronger or because they were evil patriarchal oppressors?

If women were sent to war and suffered heavy losses, the society would basically die out because of all the unborn children. If in WW2 women were sent to the front lines, Europe would now have half the population it has now.

Liberals insist on conscripting women in the army, when in case of a conflict with high casualties it would have a seriously negative effect on the society. The leaders would probably never deploy the women in that case anyway, if they were wise enough.

Der Protest gegen die ISIS ist doch gerade in Bagdad allgewärtig, da wirkt ein Demo doch lächerlich  Ich erinnere mich auch an Bilder vor ein paar Wochen aus Bagdad, wo tausende Freiwillige mit Waffen in der Hand ein Art Demo veranstaltet haben. Damit wollten sie zeigen, dass sie zum Kampf bereit sind.

&gt; Gibt es analog in arabisch kontrollierten Gebieten Demos gegen Hamas und deren Tunnel/Raketen? Im Palästinenser-Gebiet eine offene Demo gegen Hamas?

Ich denke schon, dass es viele Palästinenser in Westjordanland und auch in Gaza gibt, die gegen den militanten Widerstand gegen ihrer Besatzer sind. Weil sie die Folgen dieser Gewaltspirale sehen und es einfach für falsch halten. Aber gegen die Hamas zu protestieren, ist in diesem Konflikt das Gleiche, wie sich auf die Seite von Israel zu stellen. Und das ist zuviel verlangt, von Menschen, die unter Israel leiden. Es gibt aber sicherlich auch viele aus dem Westjordanland, die denken, dass die Hamas auch für ihre Interessen kämpfen. Du kannst es nicht vergleichen, weil die Westbank im Gegensatz zu Deutschland ein von Israel besetztes Land ist.

For example would you be happy for a government to decide to arbitrarily extend the length of their rule from 5 years to 10 years without an election? And why not?

true,Aluhut,TEXT,der einzig Echte,"&gt; Nein und Nein. Ich möchte das durchaus mal verstehen, woher die Ansicht kommt, das der Kapitalismus die menschliche Natur widerspiegelt und etwas sein soll das aus der Natur (von Gott) kommt? 

Ich sehe da mehrere Aspekte. Schon der einfache Vorteil gegenüber anderen (so evolutionär) ist ein unglaublicher Motivator. Deswegen funktionieren diese Scoring-Listen so gut. Das ziehst sich durch die ganze Kette vom Individuum bis zum gesamten Unternehmen oder gar Land. Die Art und Weise zum Erfolg zu kommen ist da schon sekundär. Warum sollte ich z.B. Regeln beachten und mich um einen Vorteil bringen wenn ich sehe, dass andere es schaffen Regeln zu umgehen und damit davon kommen? Das geht soweit, dass man heute ja inzwischen Prozesskosten mit dem Möglichen Gewinn verrechnet. Die Moral wird hier zu einem Teil der Rechnung.

Dazu kommt auch noch, dass wir etwas faszinierendes erfunden haben um auch noch mögliche Zweifel im Prozess zu beseitigen. Autorität. Das Konzept ist so alt, ich kenne mich da nicht aus aber ich kann mir vorstellen, dass das ein essenzieller Teil unserer Entwicklung war. In dem Moment als wir aufgehört haben nur für unsere Familie zu jagen und unsere Höhe zu beschützen mussten wir bestimmte Tätigkeiten ""outsourcen"". Die Tatsache, dass heute der ""Verwalter"" der Güter die mächtigste Person geworden ist (im Vergleich zu den Dronen die diese herbeischaffen) war damals schon absehbar. Früher muss das jemand gewesen sein, der so kräftig war, dass er die Verteilung der Güter unter Kontrolle halten konnte. Heute reichen Symbole. Dazu kommt heute auch noch die Möglichkeit selbst zum ""Verwalter"" zu werden. Ein weiterer Motivator. (Politiker sind hier ein Konzept welches m.M nach noch weiter entfernt ist vom klassischen ""Verwalter"" als der CEO). Zudem stand wahrscheinlich dem Verwalter schon früh ein grösserer Anteil an Gütern zu. Einfach aus dem Grund, dass diese Person ihren Dienst ja weiter erfüllen musste. Er musste ja kräftig bleiben um auch/vor allem in schweren Zeiten den Rest davon abzuhalten die restlichen Güter zu plündern z.B. Die natürliche Entwicklung war hier, dass sobald es nicht mehr darum ging ""kräftig"" zu sein, man seine ""Mitverwalter""/""Soldaten""/etc. bezahlen musste. Sobald die Verwalter ein stehendes Heer hatten, ging es los gegen andere Verwalter usw.

Was steht hier auf der anderen Seite? Moral? Ethik? Moral war immer ein fließendes Konzept. Es wird immer von der ""Verwalter""-Klasse (später auch mal von religiösen Verwaltern. Religiöse Verwalter sind so etwas wie politische) vorgegeben. Die Ethik ist da ein anderes Thema. Sie kommt immer aus dem Menschen heraus. Da tut sich was. Wir sind ja nicht mehr die derben Barbaren von früher. Also irgendwie bewegen wir uns. Jedoch hat sich das obere an diese Situation einfach nur angepasst. Alternativ hat sich die Ethik vielleicht dem Fortschritt angepasst. Schon eine Fernkampfwaffe wie ein Bogen hat einen geringeren Gore-Faktor als eine Axt die du jemandem in den Kopf rammst während er dir ins Gesicht schreit. Heute haben wir Dronen, Bomben und irgendwann haben wir Satelliten und Roboter die diese veralteten Probleme für uns lösen ohne, dass wir uns direkt Gedanken machen müssen. Die Toten auf einem anderen Kontinent wird deine Ethik nicht so sehr hinterfragen wie jemand den du eigenhändig ermordest. Das gleiche Prinzip funktioniert in der Wirtschaft. Ein Chef eines kleinen Schreinerbetriebes in einer dörflichen Gegend wird sich mit seinen Mitarbeitern und Kunden ganz anders sozialisieren als ein CEO eines 100k Mitarbeiterbetriebes welcher virtuelle Güter auf der ganzen Welt umschwingt, und dadurch vielleicht eine Fabrik in Bangladesh umfällt. Der Mann wusste nicht einmal wie die Firma hiess die die Fabrik betrieb. Kaum zu schweigen von den Menschen die da drauf gegangen sind oder einfach nur ihren Job verloren haben. Zu dem ganzen Block hier kommt auch noch Milgram. Also hier passiert was. Es wird aber noch länger dauern.

Ich sagte nicht, dass es keine Alternativen geben wird. Ich glaube einfach nur, dass es derzeit keine gibt. Jedenfalls nicht für die bereits ""zivilisierte"" Welt. Ich sehe keine die auf der einen Seite die Vorteile des bisherigen Systems aufrecht erhalten könnten und auf der anderen Seite ethisch verträglicher wären. Zudem glaube ich, dass es keinen Weg zurück gibt. Das ist nicht was wir Menschen machen. Das machen manchmal Individuen. Vereinzelt sogar Gemeinden wenn sie z.B. die Wasserversorgung wieder verstaatlichen (was auch nicht wirklich sicher ist. Ist es dann halt nur in der Hand von anderen korrupten Verwaltern), aber es gibt ja auch noch Menschen die heute auf Pferden reiten. Ich kann mir aber nicht vorstellen wie die vorhergehenden Systeme dazu dienen sollten die heutige Komplexität dessen was schon da ist vernünftig zu Verwalten. 

Deswegen sehe ich auch die einzige wirklich populär (ich denke das ist sehr wichtig. Alle müssten daran glauben) gewordene Idee vom bedingungslosem Einkommen kritisch. Ich muss da nicht einmal so weit gehen die klassische Kritik vom Faulen Sack anzufassen (glaube auch nicht, dass das das wirkliche Problem ist. MEHR verdienen bleibt ja relevant). Was wäre denn wenn sich plötzlich Preise erhöhen? Das bedingungslose Grundgehalt (BG) müsste sehr fliessend angepasst werden damit es nicht wertlos wird und da sich die ganze Warenvielfalt an diesem BG orientieren würde, wären Erschütterungen der Währung fatal. Andere Länder könnten diese Dynamik in einem Währungskrieg missbrauchen. Einfach nur weil in solchen Manipulationen und dem Spiel mit den Möglichkeiten eines BG-Empfängers auf dem Markt Gewinne zu holen sind. Wieder würden sich auch Finanzprodukte rausbilden die z.B. einen Faulen Sack fördern würden ""Holen Sie das meiste aus ihrem BG!"" und das ganze Spiel fängt von vorne an. Am Ende ist das BG auch nur ein HarzIV auf das du klar irgendwie zurückfallen kannst aber eigentlich nicht wirklich willst. Selbst wenn du nicht von einem Amt mit seinen drakonischen Methoden verfolgt wirst, wirst du von deinen Nachbarn schief angeguckt. Mindestens. Was ist mit den wirtschaftlichen Asylanten? Kann man ihnen wenn man ein solch ethisches Niveau erreicht hat noch die Flucht verwehren? ""Wir sind doch die toll evolutionierten die den BG haben während der Rest der Welt wie Sklaven im alten System arbeiten."" Mir würde da wahrscheinlich auch noch mehr einfallen aber wie du hab ich irgendwie noch Restalk im Blut ;)

Andere Alternativen sehe ich jetzt nicht. Meiner Meinung nach ist der Gipfel einer ethischen Evolution die Anarchie. Jeder kann sein System erfinden und betreiben solang er nicht gegen die Goldene Regel verstößt (die Systeme müssten sich denke ich auch an diese halten). In solch einer Umgebung könnte auch ein universelles System wachsen (gute würden blühen, schlechte würden untergehen). Ich glaube auch nicht, dass uns das langfristig zurückwerfen würde. Das würde ja diesem Drang zur Neugier und Fortschritt widersprechen. Aber wir sind noch weit davon entfernt.

Im Moment versteifen wir uns auf das was wir haben. Es läuft so gut und die vorhergehenden sind noch so nah. Da will niemand der halbwegs bei Verstand ist zurück. Was könnte der nächste Schritt sein? Ich weiß es nicht. Schaut man in die Natur sind z.B. Ameisen schon sehr lange da. Die haben viele Systeme durchprobiert. Das Ergebnis ist u.a., dass die Verteilung auf eindeutigen Befehlen folgende Gruppen von Individuen verteilt wurde, der ""Führer"" zu einer Gebährmaschine verkam und die Konflikte mit anderen Systemen nicht verschwanden. Könnte man vielleicht in der Zukunft schaffen. Vielleicht können wir aber Aspekte davon nutzen. Ich glaube die KI wird hier in der Zukunft vielleicht eine große Rolle spielen können indem sie den Verteilern nach und nach die Macht aus der Hand nimmt was ihre Rolle hinterfragen wird. Die Frage ist ob die KI ein ethisch besserer Verwalter ist.

true,_delirium,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; my essential point is that access to publicly available non-libellous information should not in any be limited - surely that's agreeable?

No, I don't think that's a reasonable position. There is no unlimited right to invade the privacy of non-public figures. Even if you can dig up some publicly available information on someone, e.g. go to a municipal office and find information about their past employment, past residences, etc., I don't see any reason there should be an unlimited right to republish it.

I think that's ultimately what this debate comes down to. Google wants to digitize *all* information, including information that traditionally was publicly *available* but not widely accessible/searchable, such as bankruptcy filings, arrest records, property records, in some cases school and employment records, etc. You could go to an office and look them up, but they didn't just casually show up. Many people in the EU think that Google's drive to make all this information casually searchable online is bad for society and should be regulated.

The only real alternative I see is to actually completely close that information, e.g. no longer make this information public *at all*.

1. There are around 500 killed Ukrainian servicemen/members of volunteer battalions (according to the list in Ukrainian Wikipedia) and at least ~1000 (I took the lowest reasonable estimate) killed pro-Russian militants. So even if 800 civilians were killed (this looks like an overestimation), it's around half of killed combatants from both sides. Check NATO bombing of Yugoslavia -- ~1000 killed combatants, and at least 500 killed civilians. Or take [2003 Invasion of Iraq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq). Or take the current Gaza war. It's just a large-scale, intensive conflict, thanks to Russia the 'rebels' armed with heavy artillery, tanks and Grads, and sadly civilian deaths are inevitable against well armed enemy.

2. It seems that these guys without much doubt attribute most if not all of civilian casualties to the actions of Ukrainian army. While of course UA army killed some civilians (and some of their servicemen with friendly fire), no doubt that majority were killed by the separatists. Kidnappings, murders, killing people on checkpoints, mining everything with anti-personnel mines (forbidden in Ukraine), etc., etc. But probably the most lethal was their terrorist tactics to intentionally shell residential areas with mortars and Grads to put the blame on UA army.

3. Then they uncritically repeat findings of the HRW ""report"". HRW... fuck HRW, seriously. I read their report, and it's just a piece of garbage. The only ""proof"" of UA guilt they got -- they found directions of the shellings. In most of the cases they described (I am not sure about Maryinka shelling myself) just having the direction of the shelling was not enough -- there were _both_ UA and separatist forces in these direction. For example, they found that Pervaya Ploschadka (Donetsk) was shelled from the west on July 19. Ok, look at the map, separatists controlled Krasnogorovka 15km on the west from the Pervaya Ploschadka, minimal range of Grad is 5 km, separatists were easily able to carry out that attack. Then they blame UA army for July 21 shelling of Kuybushevskyy district of Donetsk, while there are very good reasons that it was committed by separatists from Avdiivka, e.g. there is a video [recorded that day at 12:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5JHX1a4t98) how Grad positioned near to Avdiivka shell in the direction of Kuybushevskyy district; locals [immediately identified](https://imgur.com/aC604BL) that Donetsk was shelled from Avdiivka direction (before the video was even published), and even pointed to Yakovlevka; the direction of shelling from the north is confirmed by the shells (see e.g. [this article](http://pauluskp.com/news/3830485f6)).

First of all, I've never heard of Siberia wanting autonomy, and I don't see why they would, considering that:

&gt;It would be a serious mistake, however, to regard Siberia as any less Russian that European Russia. It may have been a colonial realm in the 1600s and 1700s, but massive settlement by Russian speakers subsequently transformed the region. **Today, Siberia is substantially more Russian than European Russia in terms of its population. In the country as a whole, Russians* constitute 80 percent of the population; for Siberia, the figure is over 90 percent.** A significant number of indigenous ethnic groups live in Siberia, but most are very small and many are close to extinction. The largest Siberian group, the Sakha (or Yakut), number only about half a million.

true,doctorheredoctor,BELG,Belgium,"This is interesting because your post hints at what discussions in the far (near?) future will look like.  Let me go on a rambling introduction to get to my point.

When the USA was still in its infancy the population had an inherent distrust for a standing army controlled by a centralized authority - only local militias were tolerated.

Over time you (as a population) have forgotten that a standing army is something to be ashamed of as Americans.  Once the 20th century put an end to American isolationism the tool of power projection was too much to put back in the drawer and as a result both military and hero worship became commonplace (despite the hiccup of the late 1960s in which American civilians were confronted with the horrors of war thanks to technology) as the government decided to publicly embrace the militaristic national spirit.

Today, even socially progressive Americans are proud of their military while a large part of the population is easily rallied to show broad support for foreign interventions.  In fact, military pride and patriotism have since 9/11 become deeply intertwined, and my American relatives in the military seem the most ferociously proud of their nation - to the point of forgetting that they fight not for the flag, but for what the flag represents.

This reversal is amusing.  Americans went from distrusting an army to having military support and patriotism firmly linked - and exercising that patriotism by proudly quoting the founding fathers out of context to support military excess.

So, while the US flourished for so long under the premise that an individual's rights were paramount and that interference from the government is negative, an equally slow reversal took place regarding personal privacy.

In Europe we have gone out of the way to protect individual's privacy regardless of what they've done.  It is their right, even if you don't find it ""just"" for them to be able to hide.  

So you (who thanks to your flair appear as a representative for all Americans) come to r/Europe to tell us to restrict individual's rights in the name of your own value system.  

Well I also think it is pretty screwy you let people like the WBC incite hatred in public, but I bet you'll understand the premise that while you may not agree with how someone exercises free speech, *it is their right.*  Understand?

Back to my first sentence, I believe that as Americans became strong supporters of their military, as counter-intuitive as it sounds I believe that in the future you will become strong defenders of privacy intrusion.  The ""you shouldn't be worried if you've got nothing to hide"" crowd is growing, fast.

(*Amusing aside:* I served my conscription with Greenpeace, at the same time as they got fined according to the so-called ""terrorism paragraph"" for one of their protests. Got a good chuckle out of the irony.)

We don't really need the draft because we have easily enough volunteers to fill the ranks. However, arguments for maintaining conscription:

* It prevents a situation where military service ends up being mostly for poor people without other prospects (no real risk of that in Denmark at the moment, but in theory).

* The conscripts balance out the volunteers so the military isn't exclusively made up of people who actively *want* to go to war.

* General preparedness for civil defence, etc. etc.

The discriminative nature of male-only conscription is regularly brought up, but the argument never seems to take much hold. Most women I've talked to handwave it away with silly references to childbirth, as others have mentioned in this thread, which just seems dumb to me - as if those two things are even remotely related.

(EDIT: I should also add that you are probably unaware that the people most likely to support the military, the conservative right-wing, are ALSO deathly paranoid of government intrusion!

I am absolutely in favor of legal protections of PII, or Personally Identifiable Information, and believe that laws in the USA don't go far enough in protecting the dissemination of said information, as we are forced to ""opt-out"" of the sharing of this kind of information by default. Addresses, online behavior patterns, dates of birth and the like should be protected because of the damage that can be done with the abuse of this information, such as falsified credit lines and harassment. 

I also believe that the method in which our media publishes the identities of *accused* criminals, as opposed to waiting until a conviction is achieved to do so, is quite harmful and stupid.

I think you'll find that my views on this type of protection of privacy are actually very common among many Americans.

true,majambela,ANSY,You have nothing to lose but your chains,"&gt;Schon der einfache Vorteil gegenüber anderen (so evolutionär) ist ein unglaublicher Motivator. Deswegen funktionieren diese Scoring-Listen so gut. Das ziehst sich durch die ganze Kette vom Individuum bis zum gesamten Unternehmen oder gar Land. 

Ich denke das ist etwas ganz wichtiges. Der Vorteil. Jeder ist auf seinen Vorteil bedacht und handelt jeden Tag in jeder Situation so, das er den größtmöglichen Vorteil für sich herausschlägt. Man steht also mit anderen permament im Wettbewerb. Aber warum? Warum sollte ich mit jedem anderen Menschen zu jedem Zeitpunkt im Wettbewerb stehen (wollen)? Ich halte den Wettbewerb für nichts schlimmes. Im Gegenteil. Fußball ohne den Wettbewerbsgedanken wäre das langweiligste Spiel das jemals gespielt werden würde. In bestimmten Bereichen ist der Wettbewerb also sehr förderlich. Aber warum sind wir so sehr bemüht diesen Wettbewerbsgedanken und damit das Konzept der Konkurrenz auch auf das zwischenmenschliche zu übertragen? Sowas schlägt sich ja auch überall nieder, wir vergleichen uns permament mit anderen: wieviel Likes bzw. Upvotes hat mein Post bekommen? Ich halte dieses Denken aber nicht für einen wichtigen menschlichen Zug. Natürlich ist er in jedem Menschen unterschiedlich stark ausgeprägt. Nur denke ich das dieser menschliche Zug schon früh von der Gesellschaft forciert wird. In der Schule geht es dann erst richtig los mit Noten, Leistung, Wettbewerb. Da ist man als Schüler ja schon gezwungen sich dieses Denken anzueignen um im System bestehen zu können. 

Und eben das halte ich für die falsche Richtung. Ich möchte nicht mit jedem permament im Wettbewerb stehen und ich denke, würden wir unseren Alltag dahin gehend analysieren, würden wir erkennen das wir uns sehr viel, ich sag mal, antiwettbewerbsmäßig verhalten als dieses System uns empfiehlt. Der Arbeitslose ist für mich auch kein Verlierer der eben auf der Strecke bleibt, ""Gut, ein Konkurrent weniger!"", sondern ein Mensch. Und er ist eben gescheitert. Ja und? Wir alle scheitern, täglich, mal mehr und mal weniger. Warum sollte ich da jetzt unbedingt auf meinen Vorteil pochen und ihm nicht unter die Arme greifen wollen, nur damit ich eventuell einen Konkurreten weniger habe? Diese Art von Denken hat sich auch, geschichtlich betrachtet, erst vor relativ kurzer Zeit entwickelt. (Natürlich war es vorher schonmal da, aber ich denke nie in dieser extremen Form wie heute). Und vorallem, wäre es nicht möglicherweise ein viel größerer Vorteil, wenn ich diesem Menschen helfe, ihn unterstütze und er dann ein nützliches Gerät entwickelt das mir in meinem Alltag hilft, oder einfach etwas schönes herstellt das ich mir als Deko irgendwo hinstellen kann? 

Also. Wettbewerb gut und schön. Aber eben nur da wo er auch wirklich nötig ist. Und das ist er im zwischenmenschlichen nicht bzw. nicht in dieser ausgeprägten Form. 

&gt;Früher muss das jemand gewesen sein, der so kräftig war, dass er die Verteilung der Güter unter Kontrolle halten konnte. 

Warum ""muss""? Vielleicht wurde per Wahl oder in einer Ratssitzung innerhalb der Gemeinschaft jemand bestimmt der als vertrauenswürdig galt und fähig war die Güter zu verwalten? Wenn sie das Konzept der Konkurrenz nicht kannten, würde nichts dagegen sprechen. Er müsste sich dann auch keinen Angriffen erwehren, da die Menschen der Gemeinschaft wissen, das der Vewalter die Güter in Zeiten des Mangels unter der Bevölkerung verteilt. 

&gt; Ich sehe keine die auf der einen Seite die Vorteile des bisherigen Systems aufrecht erhalten könnten und auf der anderen Seite ethisch verträglicher wären 

In vielen Epochen und fast allen (eigentlich allen) Ecken der Welt war es völlig normal innerhalb eines Kreditsystems zu leben. Münzgeld (aus Kupfer, Silber, Gold) war nicht immer im ausreichenend Maße vorhanden. Es war nicht selbstverständlich das man alles sofort Bar bezahlte bzw. wollten das auch die wenigsten. Es wurde also ein Kreditsystem entwickelt und allen Gütern, Dienstleistungen etc. wurde ein bestimmter Wert (in Münzgeld) zugewiesen um es gegeeinander verrechnen zu können. Wenn man also etwas benötigte holte man es sich bei dem entsprechenende Händler und der eigentliche Betrag wurde dann auf einem Kerbholz (bzw. was eben in der Zeit und Region üblich war) vermerkt. Irgendwann wurden dann alle Schulden miteinander verrechnet sodass am Ende eines Jahres alle Schulden sozusagen beglichen waren. (Das ist nur ein grober Überblick, aber so ungefähr lief es). Münzgeld kam nur im Handel mit Fremden bzw. als Steuer zum Einsatz. Was Sinn macht, da man einen fahrenden Händler nicht so gut kennt wie die anderen Mitglieder der Gemeinschaft. 

Natürlich sind heutige Gemeinschaften größer und man müsste Anpassungen machen. Aber das wäre ein Alternative. 

Zum Thema BasisEinkommen würde ich mich nur ungern äußern. Ich sympathisiere sehr mit der Idee aber bin nicht wirklich drin in der Materie um da wirklich gute Aussagen treffen zu können. 

&gt;Ich glaube die KI wird hier in der Zukunft vielleicht eine große Rolle spielen können indem sie den Verteilern nach und nach die Macht aus der Hand nimmt was ihre Rolle hinterfragen wird. Die Frage ist ob die KI ein ethisch besserer Verwalter ist. 

Interessanter Gedanke. Und ich hoffe wirklich das wir es schaffen ein System zu entwickeln das allen zu gute kommt. Wir haben die Kapazitäten und wir haben das Know-how zumindest jeden Menschen mit Nahrung zu versorgen. Jetzt müssten wir nur mal eben unseren Arsch bewegen und als Menschheit einen großen Schritt in die richtige Richtung machen.

Countries like Hungary have come out from communism with people used to social security and don't want to give that up. At the same time, the economy is struggling because of too much social security (although that is not the *only* reason why it's struggling). 

What Orban in his speech said was that simply, if you look at the world today, the developing countries are authoritarian and are making better progress than the developed countries. He wants Hungary to develop just as fast (economically), so he proposes a nation state based on the principles of countries like Russia and China. Those countries can take away social security in exchange for better economic throughput.

Although that sounds horribly if you think about the freedoms we would lose, what other alternatives are for the economy to pick up pace? With current growth it would take over 50 years to catch up to Western Europe.

Edit: It's not about ""we don't want to wait for 50 years"" but actually a matter of survival. With the current pace Hungary will have no doctors left in 10-15 years, they will all move to Germany. Most of the smartest, most talented people are moving abroad because they get better salaries, and the EU is not even discussing this issue (it's even worse in Romania I hear).

true,doctorheredoctor,BELG,Belgium,"&gt;This tangent of yours is a bit of a non-sequitur.

The tie-in was at the end of my post, here: 

&gt;Back to my first sentence, I believe that as Americans became strong supporters of their military, as counter-intuitive as it sounds I believe that in the future you will become strong defenders of privacy intrusion.

And as a matter of fact that is what you are arguing for here.  Your definition of privacy is different than ours.  Mind you this comes right after walking out of this thread: [Aircraft carriers and how to be proud of them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2cgkyd/til_that_america_has_19_aircraft_carriers/)  Military support is independent of politics.

&gt;You make a fundamental error here: It's not a matter of revealing that which is already concealed, but of concealing that which is already revealed, and that sets a dangerous precedent for censorship.

It's interesting that you consider this a ""fundamental error"" on my part and not a different cultural view.  I make no distinction between the two and find it very strange that you do.  

For the rest, your post is entirely fair and reasonable. 

*Edit to your edit:*

&gt;I should also add that you are probably unaware that the people most likely to support the military, the conservative right-wing, are ALSO deathly paranoid of government intrusion! Probably because Obama's our President. I know, I know, it doesn't make sense. It confuses me too. But this also undermines your hypothesis, sadly.)

No, I am not unaware of that.  I've lived in the US a total of roughly 3 years and have frequented both ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" circles.  I see absolutely no reason why this undermines my ""hypothesis"", military supporters fear physical government intrusion but don't blink twice when logging onto facebook, tweeting their location and behavior, or supporting a regime that silences whistleblowers.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;You know the average tax rate when you know the final sum and its composition.

It's a number that doesn't mean anything. Due to differences in consumption and regressiveness of different costs the average tax rate says nothing about the use you can get out of money.

&gt;Have you heard about inflation baskets? They assume spending composition. Just add things not counted there in the same vein.

Assuming you mean a standard basket of goods and services, it still doesn't make sense. People don't buy standard goods, and if they did they wouldn't accept losses from crime because they still wouldn't have what they need, and what they want and need varies *vastly* depending on which needs are already fulfilled. People buy a car, but people who are a hundred times as rich don't buy hundred cars.

&gt;Obsessed? Money is the only reliable estimator that exists. Everything else is just emotional hand waving with stereotypes.

Now that is handwaving based on an emotional commitment to the imaginary reality of money. The value you get from a given sum of money varies with place, time, personal preferences, available goods, the other demand, inflation, etc. etc. There's nothing more fluid than the value of money - that's the point of the existence of money: to be a fluid medium of exchange.

&gt;HDI measures just three variables. It assumes that longer education is always better. It assumes that expected life is purely environmental, while it's mostly genetic, outside of really serious pollution or malnutrition.

Places with a low life expectancy are shitholes, so they're justified in accounting for it. In addition, epigenetic factors are influenced by the environment but inheritable and therefore life expectancy is a solid indicator of general wellbeing, in addition to being a widely available and unambiguous statistic. It's a well-reasoned element of the HDI. The same for education - the time spent generally mirrors the commitment to and importance of education in a society, and the measure is unambiguous, no subjective quality assessment needed.

Of the three factors I'd distrust PPP the most, since it's not corrected for inequality and externalized costs.

You actually raise an interesting point that I hadn't considered, that the very definition of the term privacy is something in question. 

Privacy in the USA is commonly thought of as information that is kept 'in secret'. Anything you write publicly on the internet, anything you have done in public will relinquish this status and does not retroactively become private after a certain period of time. This also means that opinions that you may have (publicly) expressed in the past cannot be retroactively deemed as private. I've never thought to actually define privacy so I apologize if this is a bit rough.

*Edit to your edit to my edit*:

When you invoked the phrase ""you shouldn't be worried if you've got nothing to hide""; I took it to semantically mean government intrusion of privacy, because it is almost *exclusively* used in the context of the government violating the US Constitution's Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure. I apologize for any misunderstanding.

Furthermore, Americans are extremely sensitive about letting employers gain full access to their Facebook profiles, as there have been numerous documented cases about employees being fired for stupid posts that were made public. It is well known by now that it would be illegal for your employer to demand access to information on your profile that was not already made public or available to them.

&gt; Also. Wettbewerb gut und schön. Aber eben nur da wo er auch wirklich nötig ist. Und das ist er im zwischenmenschlichen nicht bzw. nicht in dieser ausgeprägten Form. 

Aber das ist es doch. Sobald wir etwas Wettbewerb haben, haben wir dann im späteren Verlauf einen komplexeren und erweiterten Wettbewerb. Da hast du die Entwicklung wieder. Der ""schlechte"" Wettbewerb ist aus dem guten hervorgegangen. Deswegen ist es auch so schwer sich den schlechten wegzudenken. Bzw. ein System welches die Autorität, die ethische Kompetenz (dafür müssten wir uns erst einmal auf eine Ethik einigen) und das know-how hat um zu definieren was guter und schlechter Wettbewerb ist. 

&gt; Warum ""muss""? Vielleicht wurde per Wahl oder in einer Ratssitzung innerhalb der Gemeinschaft jemand bestimmt der als vertrauenswürdig galt und fähig war die Güter zu verwalten? 

Ich weiss nicht. Ich bin kein Ethnologe. Vielleicht liest das ja einer. Ich denke einfach, dass das Bedürfnis nach einem Verwalter eher da war als solche komplexen Sozialstrukturen wie ""Wahlen"". Bis die kamen waren die anderen Verwalter schon da und wie es scheint hat sich ihre Art der Verwaltung durchgesetzt. Was auch einiges über uns aussagt.

As a Romanian citizen, I can only say that the Turkish minority in Romania, is very peaceful, living a healthy existence with the other ethnics in the region of Dobrogea: Romanians, [Aromanians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromanians), [Tatars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatars), Bulgarians, Greeks, [Lipovans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipovans) and the remaining and shrinking Jewish minority.

As a tourist I can only say good things about the services in Turkey, I can recommend any fellow European to visit them.

It would be cool if Turkey:

- Get rid of Erdogan and replace him with a real leader, not a demagogically religious zealot. I mean you need  a leader like Ataturk, to help Turkey make the next leap towards a new society, a person who will build more bridges instead of demolishing the existing ones.

- Turkey should focus on gaining more leadership in the area, and become an example for its neighbors, especially in the east. And why not in the West. For example Greece can learn a lot from the way Turkey is making tourism right now.

- Resolve in amiable way the problems with the Armenian and Kurd minorities. Recognizing the Armenian Holocaust, it's not an act of weakness, on the contrary it's an act of courage and normality, that will increase the overall image in the long run.

- Don't get to involved in the Israel - Palestinian war, from a political/military perspective. Instead focus on humanitarian acts, and show the world that the values of Islam are also about helping others, not imposing an unidirectional view (backwards) unto others.

Most people I know who did Zivi spent their time taking the paramedic shift on the convention grounds that no other wanted, serving out food for meals on wheels, training and, at the end, ambulance duty. It all depends on the organisation. Which you can choose. None of it was pointless: That meals on wheels experience counted towards their license as an ambulance driver (knowledge of the local streets etc).

If you want to become a professional paramedic, then being a Zivi in the organisation I was in is a perfect choice: You'll end up with the second-highest paramedic qualification there is and ample experience. If you want to become a cook, you should do what I did, but man that field kitchen instead of tents, trucks and kindergarten (and only get the basic paramedic qualification which, yes, is glorified first-aid).

Frankly, that's quite sad:

""Torturing bulls is inhumane!""

""And Spanish!""

""What! BAN IT!""

If you don't see why this seems incredibly hypocritical (especially since the ""bou embolat"", while equally inhumane, gets a reprieve for being *Catalan*), then you've clearly lost all critical sense.

Did I? Where? I'm Spanish, and I've certainly never liked bullfighting. That doesn't mean that I'm a ""self-hating Spaniard"", as Aguirre and the TDT Party would put it, simply that I don't feel compelled to follow a cultural norm, *especially* if some authority, or parliament, tells me.

&gt; Is it just me or you are trying to justify her using us as scapegoats?

Not at all: it's just that, since she works on pretty much the same ""völkisch"" principles as you, and you both seem to agree that bullfighting is ""quintessentially Spanish"", you are providing her the best alibi to force-feed bullfighting on the rest of us.

Yes, for example when the Caliphate conquered the Palestine region some of the Jews there chose to accomodate, keep their land and converted, while others chose to keep their religion, kept being stubborn and fled, keeping their religion and leaving their land. Turns out they have the upper hand now. So in that's actually and endorsement to be a stubborn asshole with an elephant's memory in the Middle East.

Well, I typed that before I read your piece, but consider this: Palestinians are genetically the closes relatives of the Jews when you filter out the European genes they picked up along the way.

&gt;But others, like the Persians, understood that a neverending resistance was futile and instead sought to make the best of their circumstances.

That works both ways. Israel isn't going to be able to beat them into submission, apparently, so this charade is just going to continue until the last man standing. If you plead for accomodation, then why not with both sides?

&gt;Again, Israel may be the bad guys here, but they are never going to disappear. To continue to attack them with pathetic rocket attacks is beyond idiotic and serves no useful purpose whatsoever. Imagine if the natives in America were still running around scalping people; what do you think would happen to them?

They would end up in enclosed spaces where they would languish in poverty and drug abuse.. wait a moment.

Ils arrêtent l'école à la fin du collège, et tu les vois traîner toute la journée dans les centre-villes, comme les saoulots du coin mais plus jeunes. Je n'ai jamais vu de bagarre en pleine rue, mais plusieurs fois en rentrant relativement tard chez moi (vers minuit typiquement) j'ai vu des tas de policiers qui cernaient une place ou une rue et gueulaient des trucs à des gens que je ne voyais pas. J'ai aussi vu des grosses descentes de police dans des cités, à Bagneux notamment.

J'ai assisté à une scène assez mignonne l'autre jour. Vers 22h, je rentre chez moi en passant par la place où ces types (qui ont dans les 20 ans) traînent tout le temps, et juste devant moi il y a un maghrébin trentenaire avec un gamin, et personne d'autre dans la rue. Quand on passe devant la bande, ils disent tous bonjour au trentenaire, dans le style ""wesh machin ça va !!!!!!?"", font des blagues sur le gamin (rien de méchant). Le type répond d'un air gêné et continue de marcher. 50m plus loin il explique à son gamin que s'il ne travaille pas à l'école il finira dans la rue comme ces types.",0,1407077589,null,0,false,0,cjfp62t,t3_2chc2m,t1_cjfp62t,t1_cjfoqe3,null,1435046194,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

You don't know about the quenelle thing ? I thought it was kinda ""international"" now (or at least european). It originated from french humorist (or polemist) Dieudonne as an anti-system gesture and has been used by a part of its fanbase in front of jewish symbol making the gesture ""antisemitic"". There is even an [english wikipedia page for it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenelle_%28gesture%29). For instance Nicolas Anelka was banned for making the gesture on a pitch.

It's a complicated and polarizing issue in the francosphere. But more info about Sébastien Courtoy and Henry Laquay: they are the lawyers of Nemmouche (the french killer) and also of Dieudonne. Courtoy has been known to be VERY critics towards Israel (that's an euphemism).

There are a lot of girls that come to Milan to work as models for agencies. These girls usually don't know anybody in town and start hanging out with the PRs (also known as ""modellari"") that ""recruit"" them outside of castings. Those guys take them around for free at night, because they get paid from restaurants and clubs to fill the place with hot girls.

Now a lot of the ""working-for-real"" models hang out at night, and don't necessarily do cocaine. In my experience most don't, but it really depends on their personal tastes. No one forces them in any way. They usually go out when they don't have castings or jobs in the next day, so they can get smashed and don't affect their look.

So there's no such thing as the ""bad cocaine snorters"" and the ""real working"" models. Sure there are some that are more into drugs and less into work ethics than others, but in my experience most girls are pretty down to earth and don't self sabotage intentionally.

Let me quote myself from the other reply:

Why did you instantly stoop to this shit?  We aren't even talking about soldiers.  We are talking about women in the navy.  Why do you imply I do not care about the safety of military men and women?  Do you know me?  Do you know my relatives in the military?

All you're claiming is that men cannot be trusted with keeping their own penis under control, which puts you at moral equivalence with religious fundamentalists, just sayin'.

I'm not sure if you realize that similar arguments kept women out of the space program for many years.  If a woman can hold her own against 5 men on the International Space Station for 3 months of tin-can confinement (no surfacing for fresh air either) as they have, I see nothing left in your argument beyond some vestigial chivalry.

Welcome to Germany. First, get a [European Health Insurance Card](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Health_Insurance_Card) from your current Irish provider if you haven't got one already. It'll provide coverage for the first few days.  
After that, it depends on what you do. If you are going to be employed earning less than €54000/year, then you **must** take out health insurance from a ""gesetzliche Krankenkasse"". This is simple, just look up their offices on the Internet, walk in and become a member. Then you tell your employer which Kasse you have chosen. That's it. Which one should you choose? They are heavily regulated, all cost the same (15.5% of your income, however your employer pays a little less than half for that) and all cover pretty much the same stuff. Best service have Techniker Krankenkasse (TK) and Deutsche Angestellten Krankenkasse (DAK) but there are many more.  
If you earn more than that OR are self-employed then you can opt out and take out private insurance. It is cheaper than the public ones while you are young but will become more expensive as you age.  
Under certain circumstances you can get away without insurance, of course that is not recommended!  
Or are you a student? In that case you take out insurance at a ""Gesetzliche Krankenkasse"" too but get a special, discounted flat fee (€90/month or so).  ",0,1407083714,null,0,1407083998,0,cjfrkk9,t3_2cide0,t1_cjfrkk9,t3_2cide0,null,1435047326,5,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,5

true,Mazon_Del,null,null,"An interesting topic of discussion between my friends and I has been what China would do if war broke out between the US/EU and Russia.

The way we see it there are three options.

- Option 1: China joins Russia (China trying to take over Taiwan while we are distracted counts here, since it just leads to war with the US.)

Pros: They are backing up a country they ostensibly are on the same 'side' with on a lot of issues. If they win then China does end up as THE single superpower on Earth. Glory, money, etc.

Cons: It will have an immediate destabilizing effect on their economy, just as it would ours. This could be seen as a rather large negative or 'something to be endured'.

Analysis: Least likely scenario, Russia just isn't favored to win in the EU/US situation, backing them up would mainly involve sending Chinese troops thousands of miles away from their usual supply chains. Just too many variables to safely predict what will happen. Note: If they are planning with Russia and already secretly have Chinese troops in place (all those underground forts in Moscow perhaps?) then this goes out the window.


- Option 2: They do nothing. Continue on business as usual.

Pros: Safest option. They risk basically nothing (except of course for Russian trade), and make no commitments to any costly endeavors.

Cons: Russia is likely to lose, and this will cause a fairly substantial destabilization of a massive nuclear armed neighbor, which is never good. This can be mitigated somewhat with various tactics, less costly than a war.

Analysis: Most likely scenario, China's military, while quite adequate on land and in the air, is currently somewhat abysmal on the ocean. At least against an opponent like the US Navy. They are trying to shore this up with carriers, but that is a minimum of 5 years away from even really starting to pick up the slack. We'd be able to land troops with nigh impunity on any coastal area after dealing with their navy.

- Option 3: They attack Russia.

Pros: The US/EU would back this up. This guarantees that Chinese troops have actually a 'low ball' opponent to fight because as scary as Russia is, they are not set up for a two front war over such a massive frontage, this would virtually guarantee Russia's loss in the war. There are plenty of things China could do to keep a good bit of the land that it captures. In exchange for favorable trade deals the US could likely be convinced to, if not agree to this, choose not to block it.

Cons: Well, it is a war. No getting around that. To some extent this would make them a little less trustworthy as China and Russia have historically had each others backs before. Refugees would likely abound. More so than if they did nothing (those sectors of Russia would likely have received little in the way of attention from the US/EU forces).

Analysis: Wildcard.


- Caveat statement: Nukes. If this fight happens, nukes are heavily likely to be utilized at some point. However, nobody is stupid enough to use them to outright go city-destroyer on someone, though this is a worry for the final stages of a Russia collapse. As the US/EU forces push back on the Russian line (or are pushed back) the one having problems is at all likely to resort to the secret actual advantage of nuclear weapons. Defensive deployment. Troops are going to deploy across highways, it is just the path of least resistance. As your troops fall back, set nuclear mines for remote detonation. As the enemy advances, detonate the nukes in your own territory. Not city busters, but tactical mines, 10-20 kilotons. The enemy will be pissed, but they will not have any 'justification' for indiscriminate bombardment of your cities. Both because their cities are intact, and if they DID jump to city busting, then THEY would be the cause of Armageddon and because no civilian targets were the primary target. Callous though it is to say, when you send military forces against an opponent, you don't 'get' to get pissed off internationally when the enemy kills them in defense of itself. So in reality, though they have escalated to nuclear weapons, the offensive side still can't use them.

tldr: Russia is likely to lose without China. China isn't likely to join Russia, but they MIGHT attack Russia. All bets are off if nukes come out.",0,1407084007,null,0,false,0,cjfrp07,t3_2chb1d,t1_cjfrp07,t1_cjfjsgk,null,1435047383,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

This is where you say that it's a duty for women to have children. You don't say it word for word, but that's what it says. 


Also the part about society thinking it's normal that childbirth hurts is because it fucking does. Not a construct of society. Carrying the baby is also something we can't really do nothing about. 


Yes, men don't go through that, but they are still responsible for taking care of each other and for the baby and the woman they got pregnant. 


The reason for men being drafted and not women historically is that women were more valuable because they can give birth. One man can impregnate several women, but a woman can only have one pregnancy at a time. Now wars aren't so extensive and common that this is a problem. People conscripted don't go to war, they train for it, and they are used for other things, like civil work and to help in emergencies. Because conscripted people don't go to war and die this reason doesn't hold up. 


But isn't it unfair that women have to give birth and men don't? Well, yeah, but there ain't nothing we can do about it. Life isn't fair, people outside of the first world die and have shitty lives. Should it be that way? No. But poverty is something we can fix, and likewise we can end wars and cure diseases. 


Eventually we might be able to clone children and have artificial incubators so women don't have to give birth to have a child. 


Having a children should be a choice, and in Europe it is for the most part, with good birth control and legal abortions being somewhat common. When a woman has a child, it should be her choice (and if it isn't that's what's wrong). Everyone has to deal with the consequences of their choices, and it's not like women haven't heard about how pregnancies are going to affect them. 


If you don't want to have children you should have a choice. If you chose to have children you have to deal with the consequences, and so does the father. Having children has it's shitty sides, sure, but based on what I've heard it has a lot of positive sides too.

As far as it is known, the police did not react to the tenants complaints. The whole operation was conducted in a rather ridiculous way. The police was unable to guard the truck with its road barricades, which were consequently seized by the punks and used for their own barricades. When asked, the police was unable to say how many officers it was using in this operation. When the officer responsible for press communication was asked weather the number of 1.700 officers was true, he said, that it was a lie. The number came from the ministry of the interior and was later confirmed again.

I've living in the area for 6 months now, and I have a mixed opinion. 

Overall I like living there, but if I could afford living somewhere else I would probably do. 

pros : it's well connected, by car you have both m40 and m45 that connects with almost every other neighborhood, by subway you have line 1 which is 30 min apart from Sol station.

Upon its third year on the market KETOS was Italy's most widespread fodder variety of Barley. Its leadership is still undisputed. Coming from a new, revolutionary genetic trend which has changed the way barley is cultivated in italy, the kg/hl weight is comparable to two-row varieties (although being poli-row itself) and its height, resistance to lodging and its record productivity are its strengths.
KETOS is a high productivity barley variety which is at its best when grown in good, fertile conditions and shows that the concept of cultivation on low productivity soil is now obsolete.

Jordi Pujol, government was a lot of low profile corruption during many years. Other regions(including mine Valencia) had very high profile corruption.

However, I admite that low profile corruption(small irregularities in normal contracts, some exceptions to zoning laws in exchange of hiring a relative as advisors, cultural subsidies at the service of the party, irregularities in the usage of the institutional advertising funds, and the same in tourism promotion...) is harder to fight that fuckers like the ones in Valencia that build a ghost airport, a  highway to a village in the middle of nowhere,  ghost cinema studio(ciudad de la Luz), a crazy Museum city(Ciudad de las Artes y las ciencias)...

true,pasbeaucorrea,Lorraine,Lorraine,"Salut,
Je bosse davantage dans le côté logiciel, et je suis assez éloigné de ce qui touche aux propriétés physiques et à la performance des pièces, donc prends ma réponse avec des pincettes.

Aujourd'hui on fabrique des pièces en série pour certains clients qui répondent à certains critères de qualité permettant leur utilisation de manière fonctionnelle. Dans le domaine automobile, j'imagine que c'est possible déjà à l'heure actuelle pour certaines pièces (certains plastiques, certains matériaux aux propriétés anti-électricité statique, anti-combustion). 

Ça demande un certain temps avant de mettre en place un processus qui permet de fabriquer des pièces de ce type et de s'assurer que chaque pièce fabriquée soit de qualité constante.

Il y a des grands groupes automobiles qui disposent de leur propre parc d'imprimantes, quelques uns fabriquent des pièces métalliques. Par contre si demain un mécano leur demande d'imprimer une pièce pour la monter direct sur une bagnole, je suis quais certain que même le mec le plus expérimenté ne pourra s'assurer de la fiabilité de la pièce avant même l'impression. Il lui faudra surement plusieurs essais avant d'arriver au résultat voulu.

Il y a beau y avoir des logiciels qui permettent de faire des stress tests, la qualité d'une pièce imprimée se joue sur beaucoup trop de variables pour qu'aujourd'hui on sache faire du premier coup une pièce fonctionnelle ET de qualité.

On pourrait aussi évaluer le coût d'une pièce imprimée face à une autre fabriquée en série, pas sûr que le premier soit rentable dans l'immédiat.

Personally (as someone who has spent all his life in Madrid), I'm used to measure distances using the Metro network rather than km. Any place that is inside the central network (A1) is probably going to be less than 45 minutes away from any other place. Move away of the central metro zone and, among other things, you'll probably be left with no transportation at night (since you'll be out of reach of the buhos). Using that logic, ventas is a perfectly fine place to live.

However, if a metro pass is not something you're willing to use, then I'd really be wary of going to live too far of the places where you have events (and of the city centre, which is the go-to place for hanging out with newly made friends and to go partying). That is specially important if you're here only temporarily living here, because a larger, more cozy house plus increased distance will make you more interested in staying at home rather than seizing your time in a foreign country.

true,boq,BAVA,near Germany,"1. You are swapping cause and effect. Gaza was not under blockade at all until the first Intifada and today's level of blockade only came about after Hamas took power and continuously attacked Israel.

2. Funny, Israel gave up its settlements in Gaza and in return they get tunnels and rockets trying to kill them. Israel has demonstrated willingness to disengage, and has gained nothing in return. 

3. I concede that the arrests of many Palestinians following the kidnapping was probably unnecessary. But let's be honest here, this would only have postponed the current flare-up of the conflict, not prevented it.

4. I'm not sure what the sentence about ""surrender from the PA that conceded all the settlements and the Right of Return"" means. Perhaps you could re-phrase that.

5. No, there is no indication that this wouldn't have happened if Israel recognised Palestine as a state. Hamas is not in control of an actual state and yet it attacks Israel. Absolutely nothing suggests they would stop if they had formal recognition.

6. There's nothing to negotiate with a group that doesn't recognize Israel's legitimacy. You can't compromise with someone who wants nothing less than your destruction because any kind of compromise would be a complete defeat for that someone.

Next, equating Israelis and Palestinians to Nazis and Jews is nothing short of repulsive. Israel wants nothing more than to be left alone. They would have gladly given back Gaza to Egypt, but even they didn't want them.

Finally, Palestinians *are* in fact victims here. But the mistake is to think that they are victims of Israel when in reality their enemies are Hamas. Instead of giving up they continue this hopeless fight. Hamas' rockets and tunnels cannot possibly beat Israel, their attacks *only* serve to provoke Israel to be able to point at all the alleged civilian victims for propaganda purposes when Israel does retaliate. And people like you really fall for that cheap tactic and blame the IDF instead of Hamas. It's baffling. To go back to your Nazi analogy, at least the Nazis gave up when Germany was beaten. Even they had enough common sense to know when it's time to give up fighting.

If the Gaza leadership had given up violent resistance in 2005 and started turning Gaza around, the blockade would have been lifted and today Gaza would be on its way to being one of the most prosperous places in the Arab world.

According to *someone's* definition of whose territory is whose, surely. We've had retroactive legalisations in 2012, we have the whole E1 situation. You can't reduce all of this to percentages.

We also have settler mobs waging their own private war against Palestinians, and insufficiently-radical Israelis. More or less, it seems, with silent assent of the government, as long as it happens where they don't see it.

We have massive and very dodgy bullying about ""building permits"" involving bulldozers. Somehow, settlers never have problems with non-existing building permits.

All this follows a very clear pattern. You may bend laws and details until it fits your notion of ""Israel is doing nothing wrong"", but in the end Likud still follows its statues, and those say that settlements are to expand until there's no Palestine.

For those interested I peace what matters is that by any definition the settlements aren't expanding in territory. They have clearly defined borders and anybody who knows about the conflict knows that they will be largely incorporated into Israel and the Palestinians will be compensated with land swaps. That has been the baseline for the negotiations since Clinton. The percentages do matter because that is what they have been negotiating over.

That's the problem with limiting the freedom of speech, someone has to decide whether there's a good reason or not and that is too much power for one person to have.

Besides, disclosing the names is important requirement of a fair and open trials.

Someone is accused of speeding in a school zone - should his name be published? No? What if he's a politician? Yes? What if he's a public figure? Well what is a public figure? Some TV show host or owner of some multi-billion business who can more easily manipulate the trial through pressuring or bribing the politicians or judges if there is no open trial and the public isn't aware of who being tried?

And that's a very minor offense. What if it was something more serious? Like a robbery, embezzlement of millions of €, murder, rape, etc...

Then there's a question of who decides when there's a good reason to not publish the name? Who monitors that person in order to prevent them from manipulating the system?

What about the ""right to be forgotten""? Does an investor who has a really bad history on the stock market have the right for that history to be forgotten and hidden from his potential clients? 

Limiting the freedom speech and implementing the right to be forgotten maybe aren't bad ideas on their own, but the problem lies with the person who decides how they're implemented.

It will obviously be the government and the government always has the most to gain by implementing such concepts, because they are imposing those concepts on the media - the very entity whose main purpose is to monitor the government.

**EDIT:** I just wanted to add that I believe that transparency is of utmost importance for democracy to function properly.

If a child was born out of wed lock they were taken off the mother and brought to one of these homes where the mortality rates were much higher than the rest of the country. They were treated like they were different and kept separate from the 'normal' children. Doctors performing Symphysiotomies on women without their permission. The Magdalene laundries where the nuns pretty much used women as slave labour and treated them like shit. The child abuse and cover up by the Catholic Church. Less serious but important things like separation of church and state. The Catholic church runs nearly all primary schools in Ireland. Huge amounts of time are wasted with prayers, confession, communion and confirmation. Then there is the whole abortion thing. Women have to go to England to get an abortion. In 2007 there was a 17 year old girl with a baby who had anencephaly. The HSE wouldn't let her leave the country for an abortion and she had to go to the Supreme Court. It should have been a private matter but everyone knows about her now. Then there is Savita Halappanavar, she was having problems with her pregnancy and needed an abortion or risk her life. The rights of the unborn fetus come before the woman in Ireland so they refused to carry out the abortion, she then died of Sepsis. It goes on and on and on. The mother and child homes, laundries and the Symphysiotomies don't happen any more but its still a black stain on our country.

It is! If it were a dialect, it couldn't be protected at the level it is by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. It's also, at least IMHO, too far from Standard German (phonetically and grammatically) to be the same language, otherwise one could argue that Platt and Frisian and English (without all those romance and gaelic words) are one and the same language. 

(Of course, they're all West Germanic languages).

As to it's inner-German status, it's a bit complicated. There's a federal law saying that the executive language of the federation is ""German"", and most people understand that to be ""Standard German"". The Schleswig-Holstein constitutional court, however, interprets it as ""*any* German"", and as Platt is *a* German language (as is Standard German), Platt is considered admissible if you want to correspond with federal authorities in Schleswig-Holstein, as it is when you deal with state or municipal authorities.

Then, however, when a farmer submitted his patent application for resting mats for cows to the Munich patent office they thought ""WTF we don't deal with gibberish over here"" and rejected it on the reason that it was written in Platt. Courts then decided that they had to accept it, but the farmer would have to pay for translation costs, which is a very, very strange and illogical judgement, but whatever: They argued that Platt was German, (not *a* German) (therefore the patent office had to accept), but not ""in German language"" (therefore the translation costs).

That said, Platt nearly died and we really need to resurrect it, we're lucky there's still proper native speakers around, in many families the grandparents are still fluent, so the kids have someone to learn from. Which is why several states now  teach it in some way or the other in school (though teachers to do it properly are rare). If you ask me, the NDR should do a full-time programme in Platt, at least a radio station, if not TV.

And as an endnote: Platt has also mutually (nearly) unintelligible dialects. I've got serious trouble with Westfälisch and anything in Brandenburg.",0,1407097917,null,0,false,0,cjfxs5s,t3_2bphu7,t1_cjfxs5s,t1_cj7mixc,null,1435050406,1,false,German,t5_2qq51,1

Other than that I really object to the notion of conscription since it's temporary slavery. I can't understand how people here complain about sexism of gender-selective conscription and do not complain about being conscripted against their will in the first place.  I understand temporary military (or related non-military civil service) training during school for all citizens. That makes some sense but selective conscription is just harmful and stupid.

I don't think that passage actually has any conflict. Christliche Nächstenliebe doesn't require you pray to Jesus. If this guy has an active religious life, he meets what they've written and you quoted. The only ""hard"" thing for him might be ""Eintreten für christliche Sitte und Kultur im privaten und öffentlichen Leben"" but this isn't religious either, norms and culture don't need to be the religion itself. If he works with immigrant organizations to help integrate people into the Christian culture of Germany, he fits. His Abiturfach was Catholic Religion, which might get him somewhere. 

You have to go up a level to the Dachverbund... which also doesn't help, because the members it's talking about are the actual Bruderschaften, not the members of those Bruderschaften. 2.2.1 (a) says members of Bruderschaften of other Christian confessions have the same rights and duties, but nothing says you can't be a muslim. Nothing says you must be Christian. Nothing says what rights or duties non-Christian members of Bruderschaften might have.

If I represented the anti-EU forces in Norway I would say that we prefer the *financial independence* being outside gives us. 

While I agree that we're not exactly free or completely outside (EEA), the freedom we *do* have is something Italy and other EU members miss dearly now! The Italians would just have devalued their currency and avoided a lot of the problems they now have to suffer as Eurozone members. Norway's currency is a problem for exporting industries, but it was a ""safe haven"" during the crisis. That caused other problems for us, but lenders were more than willing to lend money to the Norwegian state (bonds). Placing money in Norwegian banks was attractive and safe.

I'd say he acted the way he did because a Ukraine free of Russian control is literally one of the most dangerous things to an imperial Russia. It'd be dangerous because it would contest several inviolable 'truths' that the current Russian regime (and the previous ones, for centuries) have been perpetuating:

**'Truth' nr. 1:** liberal democracy can't work in the 'russosphere'. As long as Russia, Ukraine and Belarus were safely contained, that claim went uncontested. If Ukraine is allowed to at least give it a go, there's a danger that the old 'truth' about Russians (and by extension Ukrainians and Belarusians – because they're just uppity Russians anyway) needing a strong benevolent-enough hand to guide them will turn out to be false. It might just turn out that Russians _aren't_ some sort of freaks who can't survive without a czar looking over/after them.

**'Truth' nr. 2:** Russia (and Moscow) are the uncontested centers of the 'russosphere'. The 'West' has no trouble with being multipolar - there's the United States _and_ Europe, for example. Within Europe there's Germany, France, UK, etc. This doesn't hold in 'russosphere' – there's Russia... and there are peasants, that's it. There's Moscow... and there are provincial backwaters. Now, if we'd have a liberal Ukraine rise to... not even contest the throne, just to _compete_, Russia's perfect unipolar wold would be thrown in disarray. Lest not forget that Ukraine is effectively bilingual - a 40+ million strong _free_ Russophone market of ideas would give the heavily controlled Russian one a run for their money.
