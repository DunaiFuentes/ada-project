Maintaining World Police is less economical, yes. US spends a lot of money on their armed forces, it is very impressive.

With its natural resources, Russia has the potential of being one of the worlds fastest growing economies, if Putin could eliminate corruption, streamline bureaucracy and regulations, and get crime under control. 

There is also nothing stopping Putin from turning Russia into one of the most free states. Well besides the obvious **he relies on corruption to stay in power**.

And that's why Russia is still under-developed, still not doing well, and **is still doomed to lose out to the West**. It can not compete with the EU at all. No remotely democratic country would freely chose Russia over the EU.

And that's why Russia is so afraid of the EU expanding to Russia's borders. Because it will. And those countries' economies will improve faster than Russia's. And their societies will be more tolerant and free. And the best and brightest of Russia will start to leave Russia even faster than they already do.

And in the very long term Putin's whole regime is doomed. Doomed just like the USSR always was. Russia will be stuck between the world's biggest economic blocks. The EU to its west and China to its east. And Russia's current future looks like a corrupt banana republic, but with energy instead of bananas. 

Sooner or later the few at the top who get most of the profit from the energy exports will fall. It might take a long time. Belarus sure is taking its time. But it will happen. Putin has very good reasons to be paranoid.

Realistically Latvia only has to fear a Russian invasion, and if that ever happens the bigger countries will do most of the work regardless. For example, Estonia meets the requirements and spends 2.3% of their GDP on their military, but that is ultimately irrelevant if Russia ever decides to invade.

You can read article 111 of the constitution of Ukraine if you want to know how the parliament can impeach a president. Instead of following the process they only voted on it, and they failed to achieve the required majority. So that's pretty clear. Europe had already negotiated with the old government and they had already agreed to re-elections, but apparently re-elections is not what the new government wanted. Makes it much harder for Europe to declare support - a legitimate election would have been a powerful argument that they now don't have.

Myth 2... the cultural divide is real and the article even states that. It's hard to say how great the desire for separation is without asking them. But you know how it turned out in Czechoslovakia (peaceful separation) or in Yugoslavia (not so peaceful) and it's foolish to dismiss this without at least a referendum as basis. The division is not as clear cut as it was in Czechoslovakia, which already was a federation of two states, but at least Crimea is an autonomous republic with its own government.

Myth 3 is also a bit silly. The Black Sea Fleet alone is about 1/5 the size of Ukraine's military and that ""surprise inspection"" exercise Russia just held near the border with Ukraine was reported to include more troops than Ukraine has. Also, you bet Russia has been preparing at least since December because that's what you do when there's large scale civil unrest in a neighboring state that's capable of toppling the government.

You guys often overestimate Americans. No, just because we have a high GDP/capita, doesn't mean the average American is as wealthy as the average European.

We have a *much* higher percentage of millionaires and billionaires, and for good reason. Our tax laws, real-estate market, etc. make our country much more comfortable for the wealthy than Europe's, so what does that mean? M/billionaires *flock* towards our country, leaving a *massive* wealth imbalance. I mean, just [look at the GINI coefficient](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/GINI_Index_SVG.svg/2000px-GINI_Index_SVG.svg.png) 

Most of the wealthiest people in the world live in the United States, like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Zuckerburg. And even though only a small handful in comparison to the general population, their *massive* amount of concentrated wealth really tips the scale. So because we have such a high number on the GINI scale, our GDP doesn't necessarily represent our wealth, unlike the population of Sweden or Slovenia. 

And remember that the United States isn't solely NYC and LA, nor are we a homogeneous suburban behemoth. States like Iowa are roughly on the same level of countries like Poland. Remember, your average American makes less than 20.000 Euros a year, lives in a home less than 100 square meters, and owns a 15-year-old car. Not a crazy amount of money, not to mention how weak our dollar is. 

So it's funny that someone living in a country with an HDI as high as France's is telling me to shut up and be quiet. Last time I checked, I work to pay for food, shelter, and my and my younger brother's education, not strangers 7,000 miles away who wouldn't think twice about beating and/or raping me for being a queer woman.

Though those numbers dont seem that far off in percentage terms, they are very substantial.

Sull'ambizioso sono anche d'accordo, enorme proprio no. Tutt'altro. È proprio il film più sciatto e di vedute strette che abbia fatto Sorrentino.

E sono d'accordo anche su McQueen, che non mi piaceva neanche prima (certe sbandate nella videoarte al cinema mi fanno orrore), ma qui ha fatto un compitino pulito pulito fatto apposta per vincere 300 oscar.

Ma non era candidato come film straniero, ovviamente, e nessuno ne ha parlato né qui né nell'altro thread. Perché tu l'abbia tirato fuori è un mistero.

Su Vinterberg secondo me hai preso uno sfondone. The Hunt è la summa di tutto ciò che ha fatto prima, asciugata e rifinita con una pulizia formale incredibile (considerando la scuola danese da cui viene).

Recently though, Statoil (Norway) has started to be more competitive by untying its gas prices from the oil price and selling more on the spot market, so Russia's share has actually been shrinking.

Natural gas used to be seen as a waste product of oil drilling and was simply burned instead of used as fuel, so during WWII it would not have been as relevant (if at all) as it is today. But near the end of WWII, Germany *did* actually lose its capability to produce enough oil and this significantly contributed to the downfall of the Third Reich. Germany did produce some fuel [from coal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer%E2%80%93Tropsch_process#History), cars and weapons like the V2 used  ~~vodka~~ *potato alcohol*, and they invented fuel efficient (compared to existing engines) [turbojet engines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinkel_He_178), but in the end the lack of oil and the destruction of Germany's refineries as well as trains transporting oil obviously being a target prevented the Luftwaffe from establishing aerial superiority again.

That depends on what you want to measure.

An invention without patent has no economic value since everyone can copy it. And since the validity of a patent is 20 years, this also gives you a good projection for the future.

Whitewashing of communism and Stalin, along the line of: ""Sure, Stalin and Lenin were  cruel people, but first of all they weren't really Russian, and besides, only through cruelty we could stand up to the evil genocidal Europeans and industrialize in record time.""

Great Patriotic War became a de facto founding myth of Soviet Union. Russia was the greatest contributor to the European war, and felt betrayed by the Western allies, who pitied the cruel but European Germans more. (the Holocaust, btw, wasn't present in the Soviet curriculum). That and the resulting Cold War further alienated Russians from the West, but that didn't start in the 20th century.

Russian nationalism seems to me to be founded on the Third Rome legend. Moscow (or St. Petersburg) is the spiritual successor of Rome and Constantinople. Imperialism, whether communist, tsarist or currently post-soviet, seems to come naturally to such Russian nationalists. A common argument I often hear as a Pole is ""Poland-Lithuania argued for control over Eastern Europe, Russia won and therefore could do anything to Poland"". You can't argue with Russians since they are naturally superior.

Russians seem to combine the persecution complex with superiority complex - they seem to think that their country is the worst, but decry others whether they agree or disagree. (not that Poles are much different). Russians, unlike Poles, can't understand that smaller states can be independent.

All’andata nessun problema,  imbruniva ma c’era una buona visibilità. Parecchi  giri di vino rosso  dopo si avvicina l’ora del coprifuoco e barcollanti ci avviamo sempre a piedi sulla via del ritorno, con una splendida luna piena sopra di noi.

Cantiamo. Saltelliamo come polli. Improvvisiamo le battaglie di Star Wars con due rami gentilmente offerti da madre natura.

Arrivati a metà strada sentiamo dei rumori e notiamo delle figure in un bosco in una riva venti metri più in basso.  Qualcosa non torna. Ok la luna ma erano quasi fluorescenti.

Come due gonzi rimaniamo fermi impalati a guardare. Le figure si bloccano e sembrano girarsi verso di noi. Stringendo gli occhi alziamo una manina per fare ciao. Le figure cercano di nascondersi dietro agli alberi, ma il loro profilo luminoso sembra passare attraverso i tronchi dei castagni.

Io ed il mio amico ci guardiamo. Anche lui ha visto la stessa scena che ho visto io. 

Copriamo i dieci minuti di strada rimanenti  in cinque minuti scarsi, correndo come forsennati al buio sullo sterrato, spingendoci e rialzandoci l’un con l’altro, nel più completo silenzio.

A parte qualche livido e due ginocchia sbucciate (una a testa) arriviamo a casa sani e salvi. E completamente sobri.

&gt;Perchè sbatterci per ricercare cure per il cancro, che ci si arricchiscono le big farma? Se l'evoluzione è vera ci evolveremo in modo da non averlo. Invece no, c'è la spinta a inventare cose nuove anche per il denaro che una persona può ricavarne (il cjan no'l mene la code dibant, si dice in Friuli - Il cane non agita la coda per niente). E allo stesso modo, se tu scrivi un libro, lo fai solo per la gloria? Se con la tua band incidi un cd, lo regali ai concerti? Se inventi un processo per costruire i migliori muretti di sempre, vai in giro a farli aggratis? No, perchè un uomo deve pur vivere e le risorse investite le vuole indietro, anche proteggendole da altri che potrebbero guadagnarci. Prova a pensarci, tu non lo faresti?

Appunto qui caschi su una cosa che ho già espresso prima, devi porti il problema in un modo: ""come posso continuare a fare quello che faccio?"" e non ""Devo fare qualcosa che mi permette di fare il cazzo che mi parrà dopo averla fatta"".

For a car with a manual gearbox, the most fuel efficient speed is the lowest speed in top gear that the engine can run smoothly, typically 1000 or 1200 rpm (on a flat road). Depending on the gearing, this is typically around 40 mph.

Fuel consumption is due to air resistance (most significant at higher speeds), tyre rolling resistance (speed related), engine losses (engine speed related) and other minor losses.

At 30 mph, you would be in 4th gear. And also at 20 mph. At 20 mph your air speed and engine speed are less than at 30 mph, your fuel consumption will be less.

di Luca Pierattini - Repubblica.it

&gt;La libertà di stampa in Europa migliora solo in Italia, ma non c’è da sorridere. Secondo l'indice 2014 di Reporters sans frontières, il nostro paese progredisce di 9 punti rispetto al 2013 ed esce da una ""spirale negativa"", tornando tra i Paesi con una situazione ""piuttosto buona"", al 49esimo posto sui 180 della classifica. Secondo l’associazione che pubblica ogni anno la fotografia globale della libertà d’informazione, ""l'unica evoluzione positiva si verifica in Italia che sta preparando una legge incoraggiante per depenalizzare la diffamazione a mezzo stampa"".

&gt;Nel resto d’Europa la situazione rimane pressoché invariata, con la conferma in testa di Finlandia, Paesi Bassi e Norvegia. Male invece Gran Bretagna e Francia che scendono al 33esimo e al 39esimo posto della classifica. Londra è colpevole di aver fatto pressioni sul quotidiano The Guardian nella vicenda legata alle rivelazioni di Edward Snowden sulle attività dell'intelligence americana e britannica;  in Francia, una sentenza che ha imposto al settimanale Le Point e al giornale Mediapart di ritirare dai loro rispettivi siti internet le registrazioni sull'affaire Bettencourt. Ancora peggio va in Grecia che perde 14 posti e scivola al 99esimo posto a causa della crisi economica e dalla febbre populista, così come è accaduto all’Ungheria (64esima . Ad Atene i giornalisti sono vittime di aggressioni fisiche, firmate da Alba Dorata, il partito di estrema destra che è entrato nel parlamento greco nel 2012.

&gt;La situazione non va meglio dall’altra parte dell’Atlantico, dove scendono anche Stati Uniti (-13 posti al 46esimo posto  e Brasile (-2 al 111esimo posto . Su Washington pesa la condanna a Bradley Manning nel caso Wikileaks e lo scandalo-intercettazioni dell’agenzia Nsa. In Brasile il pluralismo dei mezzi di comunicazione è ostacolato fortemente dalla collusione tra politica e editoria: molti politici infatti, sono anche imprenditori e proprietari di media.

&gt; * Between 74% and 75% of women in a professional capacity or in top management jobs have experienced sexual harassment in their lifetime, and one in four of these women have been confronted with sexual harassment in the 12 months prior to the survey.

&gt; * 12% of women have experienced some form of sexual abuse or incident by an adult before the age of 15 (8% genital exposure, 5% touching genitals or breasts, 1% forced sexual intercourse)

This is precisely the sort of thing we are trying to get at.  If you were to draw it, you would draw the white one but you also recognize that the green one counts as asparagus as well.

So it may be easier to think about the task this way: what are words (presented in English) where a German and an American would draw different pictures.  Back to our Asparagus example, you would draw the white one while an American would draw the green one.  Hope this clears things up!

France is probably the only country in Europe ready for everyone to be driving electric cars with the amount of electricity demand that will create. Electricity demands are increasing exponentially, we can't replace generating methods 1:1.

&gt;As a direct result of the 1973 oil crisis, on 6 March 1974 Prime Minister Pierre Messmer unexpectedly announced what became known as the 'Messmer Plan', a huge nuclear power program aimed at generating all of France's electricity from nuclear power. At the time of the oil crisis most of France's electricity came from foreign oil, and while it was strong in heavy engineering capabilities, France had few indigenous energy resources.

&gt;The announcement of the Messmer Plan, which was enacted without public or parliamentary debate, also led to the foundation of the Groupement des scientifiques pour l'information sur l'énergie nucléaire (Association of Scientists for Information on Nuclear Energy), formed after around 4,000 scientists signed a petition of concern over the government's action, known as the Appeal of the 400 after the 400 scientists who initially signed it.
The plan envisaged the construction of around 80 nuclear plants by 1985 and a total of 170 plants by 2000. Work on the first three plants, at Tricastin, Gravelines, and Dampierre started the same year and France installed 56 reactors over the next 15 years.

Speaking about their ""deep concern"" and ignoring criminal activities on their own soil - this is what Europe was doing this whole time. If only they followed their own laws and froze the assets of the biggest ukrainian thieves, PERHAPS there would not be so many victims in Kyiv now.

Auch wurde in den Fragen nicht nach männlichen und weiblichen Tätern unterschieden, sondern vorausgesetzt bzw. suggeriert, dass die Täter männlich sein müssten - und die Frauen natürlich Opfer.

Hoch problematisch ist auch die Altersgrenze von 15 Jahren. Denn das umfasst einen Bereich, wo Mädchen und Jungen noch in der Pubertät bzw. der Phase des Ausprobierens sind und erst durch Versuch und Irrtum lernen müssen was angemessen ist und was nicht. In den Umfrageergebnisse werden also Taten, die aus Unreife geschehen mit Taten vermischt, die trotz entsprechender Reife geschehen (ab 21 Jahren).

Den Fragebogen zur Studie findet man hier:

http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-violence-against-women-survey-questionnaire_en.pdf

""Unwelcome touching, hugging or kissing?""
""Inappropriate staring or leering that made you feel offended?""
""Sexually suggestive comments or jokes that made you feel offended?""
""Inappropriate invitations to go out on dates?""
""Intrusive questions about your private life that made you feel offended?""
""Intrusive comments about your physical appearance that made you feel offended?""
""Inappropriate advances that offended you on social networking websites such as Facebook, or in internet chat rooms?""

Hier lernt man, dass es schon eine Erfahrung sexueller Gewalt ist, wenn man in einem Internet-Chat einen Post der Art bekommt: ""Du siehst ziemlich heiß aus, ich würde dich gerne kennen lernen!"". Oder wenn einer Frau im Schwimmbad auf den Busen geschaut wird. Oder sogar, wenn man auf einer Party zur Begrüßung umarmt wird.

In der Studie wird offensichtlich die Schwelle für sexuelle Gewalt derart niedrig angesetzt, dass es praktisch unmöglich ist, keine ""GEwalterfahrung"" gemacht zu haben.

Streng genommen wird auch gar nicht nach Gewalttaten gefragt, sondern ob die Frau ""Offended"" war, also sich ""gekränkt"" gefühlt hat. Natürlich fühlen sich empfindliche Frauen eher gekränkt. Derselbe Vorgang kann einmal Gewalt sein und einmal harmlos, je nachdem, wie empfindlich die Frau ist. Das Ergebnis der Studie ist also eher: ""Ein Drittel der Frauen in Europa sind ziemlich empfindlich!"" Man könnte auch ""zickig"" sagen. Eine Einschätzung, die tatsächlich gut zur Alltagserfahrung passt.

Die ""Studie"" ist also ganz bewusst darauf angelegt, die Gewaltzahlen künstlich aufzubauschen. Das Motiv ist das übliche: Das Klischee von der Frau als Opfer zu zementieren.

Dass trotz der tendenziösen Fragestellung aber nur en Drittel der Frauen entsprechende Erfahrungen gemacht hat, zeigt, dass ECHTE Gewalt gegen Frauen praktisch nicht mehr vorkommt.

Nuclear is much more expensive. Even today in the news: the company running the plant is only responsible for 1% of the costs of a major accident. And at least solar stops costing money when stop using it. Nuclear is just putting a mortgage on the future for present consumption.

Nuclear is more expensive. They're always over time and over budget, and have gotten a lot of subsidies and will keep costing money long after they stopped delivering power.

Solar panels do still produce electricity on less-than-sunny days, just not at peak capacity. It would be silly not to pick that up and save the coal/gas instead.

&gt;L'ensemble de ta théorie du combat tombe seule après ça.

Pourquoi ?

La biologie existe. La compétition sexuelle existe.

D'ailleurs, ne pas voir les impacts sociologiques de la natalité (il naît 105 garçons pour 100 filles), de la mortalité (il meurt 105 garçons pour 100 filles, avec 6 ans d'espérance de vie en plus pour les femmes), et de la fertilité (période plus réduite chez les femmes) dans les comportements masculins et féminins est une grave erreur.

&gt;Bourdieu, De la Domination masculine

Déjà lu la domination masculine. L'utilisation d'échantillons ad-hoc et le concept fumeux d'hommes ""prisonniers de leur domination"", en niant totalement les aspects biologiques et la compétition sexuelle, ont achevé de me convaincre de l'erreur que faisait Bourdieu là-dessus.

Par contre, il a élaboré des concepts dont je me sers pour expliquer que les hommes ne dominent pas : 

Il y a une répartition inégale de tous les types de capitaux, et les données montrent que les hommes ne dominent absolument pas. Une minorité d'hommes dominent dans le domaine économique, mais dans tous les autres, dans les domaines culturel et social, ce sont les femmes qui dominent.

Le fait est que l'on occulte soigneusement, systématiquement, les hommes dominés, pour faire croire à une domination genrée.

Concrètement ce sont les femmes qui ont l'autorité à la maison, à l'école, au collège, au lycée, au tribunal, à l’hôpital... Les hommes qu'on croise en dehors du monde professionnel, ce sont les flics, les éboueurs et les ouvriers...

Era luglio 2010, 7-8 di sera (quindi c'era ancora abbastanza luce essendo estate) e stavo rientrando da un bel giro in bici nella campagna sud-Milanese. Mi fermai ad una panchina lungo il Naviglio, appena fuori Milano, per ammirare lo splendore del tramonto padano (in realtà avevo il fiato corto...), quando notai in cielo qualcosa che all'inizio mi sembrò un elicottero; non era molto in alto (ad occhio avrei detto 1000-1500m), come dimensione poteva essere benissimo un elicottero, ma due dettagli mi saltarono all'occhio (e alle orecchie) poco dopo: non c'era rumore di elicottero, di solito a quella distanza si sentono parecchio gli elicotteri (soprattutto se in hovering), e inoltre questo presunto elicottero sembrava lampeggiare di verde, come se stesse ruotando su se stesso, e riflettesse il sole che proveniva dalla mia direzione (sud-ovest). Nonostante sembrasse vicino, per via di questo lampeggiare non riuscii a distinguerne bene la forma.

Decisi di avvicinarmi seguendo il Naviglio, e l'oggetto non sembrava muoversi. Dopo circa cinque minuti, appena dopo un sottopassaggio a una strada ( precisamente qua](http://goo.gl/maps/ESwwG) ), rialzo gli occhi al cielo, e boom, sparito.

I would agree, but there is an enthusiasm on all sides for the rule of law and against rule by oligarch, which has been happening on and off since independence.

As we go closer to the edge of the EU (Bulgaria, Romania even Poland) these things falter but they are arguably better than they would have been without an outside pressure to reform.

&gt;One would almost think that the EU in it's present form is unable to survive without permanently expanding and gobbling up countries,

There *is* a business around accession (I know, I have worked for a consultancy that is part of it). However new members generally do mean new headaches but a new source of trade. Personally I believe that many countries were pressed to take the Euro too soon but it doesn't mean that I don't believe in the principles of regulatory alignment.

&gt;If the EU really wants to help the Ukrainan people, why not offer a better contract on more favorable terms, without forcing Ukraine to give up it's independence?

Again, a good point. However, there has been considerable blowback from giving assistance without suitable controls in the past. For organisations to step in with concrete assistance during the current political climate, they have to demonstrate a benefit for the EU, i.e., better regulation.

For me, EU accession should not be the goal for Ukraine. The implementation of rule by law, better regulation, suppression of criminality is a win-win situation for the Ukrainian people and the rest of the EU. In the most recent years the EU is a more important trading partner than the Russian Federation. I have not been able to find anything in the association agreement that prevents bilateral trading arrangements with other countries.

The Hunt senza compromessi proprio no, è un film molto bello ma è la fiera delle scorciatoie narrative.  
Non so se hai presente la storia di Rignano Flaminio, cioè la vita vera, di cui la trama the hunt sembra una versione depotenziata.    
i compromessi sono tanti:  
- il più grave è quello di mostrare chiaramente da subito l'innocenza del protagonista, per cui lo spettatore non viene mai messo al livello degli altri cittadini, nella condizione naturale di sospetto. Il film ti porta a giudicare l'irragionevolezza delle persone evitando di fartela sperimentare in prima persona.    
- E' stata completamente ignorata la dimensione mediatica del caso, le dinamiche di paese sono una semplificazione che funziona ma solo fino ad un certo punto: nella storia del film nessuno esce vincitore, nella realtà i media speculano attivamente sugli sconfitti e ne traggono profitto.  
- Alla fine viene mostrata l'impossibilità di un ritorno alla normalità, ma il fatto che il padre della bambina e protagonista siano amici fraterni è uno stratagemma facile per dare un senso di chiusura al film e alla storia. un abbraccio fraterno, la bimba ripresa in braccio e ci sentiamo tutti un po' meglio.  
Tra le altre cose: la moglie è già cattiva da subito, si evita di spiegare la dinamiche di coppia (accennate in maniera troppo semplice con la ragazza), e gli amici che lo aiutano non subiscono l'influenza dell'opinione pubblica, la tipa perché è straniera e il padrino perché è di status sociale più alto.  

Insomma, il film è una grande lezione di storytelling e Mads Mikkelsen come al solito è gigantesco, ma conoscendo Vinterberg e conoscendo storie simili, alla fine salta all'occhio una certa mancanza di coraggio nelle scelte intraprese, motivo per cui l'ho paragonato a 12 anni, che nonostante l'orticaria che mi provocano i film a tema Epica Americana è anch'esso un'ottima prova registica e narrativa a cui però troppo spesso manca il coraggio di fuggire dai canoni classici di genere.  

La grande bellezza, al contrario, non è sciatto e di vedute strette, nonostante la stampa si sia fermata ad una sua lettura semplicistica e manichea. Lo studio del personaggio di Jep, che poi è Sorrentino (nichilista, esteta e innamorato del grottesco), è tutt'altro che lineare: la sua ricerca della bellezza non è avviene attraverso la contrapposizione bello/brutto ma dall'analisi delle tante contraddizioni che il mondo presenta. Nella contemporaneità, chi si interessa all'arte sa che i canoni classici non sono più in grado di dirci cosa è bello e cosa no: il brutto può essere bello, serve uno sforzo intellettuale per giudicare ciò che la realtà ci offre. Da qui la valanga di contraddizioni che Sorrentino mette in scena: personaggi grotteschi ma amabili, relitti di nave come rovine architettoniche, citazioni di scrittori famosi che non dicono nulla, mentre frasi che sembrano cazzate (le radici sono importanti) rivelano significati più profondi, l'action painting paraculo e meschino della bambina che però riesce a diventare creare bellezza.  
Chi nel film ha visto solo il Bramante e Serena Grandi, e pensa che il film sia una critica sociale verso la seconda, si è perso l'immenso mondo che esiste tra i due estremi e su cui Sorrentino si concentra maggiormente (pure il personaggio della Ferilli è bello e cafone, e forse bello perché cafone).   
E Sorrentino fa scelte coraggiose, non paraculo come hanno detto alcuni: a tre quarti del film chiude la storia lineare, da li in poi cessa la trama ma continua per 45 minuti il solo percorso di ricerca del protagonista, che ora ha uno sguardo diverso sul mondo che lo circonda.  
A me Sorrentino non è mai piaciuto, per la sua mancanza di umanità ed il suo gusto per le macchiette, e mi sono approcciato al film con molta diffidenza, però qui finalmente (facendo un film su se stesso, essenzialmente), riesce a dare una direzione concreta al suo universo di personaggi grotteschi e virtuosismi. Non credo sarà in grado di fare un altro film altrettanto riuscito.

IMHO, il problema delle discussioni di cinema (e di arte in generale, ma per il cinema è più grave come problema) è che si fa confusione su alcuni piani, provo a elencarne:

* critica ""tecnica"" (regia, prova attoriale etc)
* critica della sceneggiatura\scrittura\racconto (la storia è ben scritta, è fluida? Ha buchi? i dialoghi sono decenti? il montaggio aiuta?)
* è il tuo genere?

Ora un film può essere impeccabile e non piacermi, avere buchi di sceneggiatura e risultare piacevole etc...

Dire ""non mi piace"" ha senso, dire ""è brutto"" ne ha un altro. Spesso capita di invertire i due sensi o di essere incapaci di spiegare il perchè di una idiosincrasia. 

Infine, può anche esserci una vera e propria cattiva educazione al film (come una mia amica che definì Tarantino ""un regista che prende in giro il pubblico"" perchè non aveva capito la trama di pulp fiction, non avendo capito la differenza tra fabula e intreccio del film), però sono pochi i casi reali.

&gt;Concrètement ce sont les femmes qui ont l'autorité à la maison, à l'école, au collège, au lycée, au tribunal, à l’hôpital... Les hommes qu'on croise en dehors du monde professionnel, ce sont les flics, les éboueurs et les ouvriers... Tu parles d'une domination.

Pas seulement. Le regard social n'est pas le même sur l'homme et sur la femme. Je vais prendre des arguments déjà utilisés mille fois et que chacun peut vérifier lui-même dans la vie de tous les jours :

- Les hommes ont plus de temps de parole lors des discussions de groupe. C'est assez impressionnant. A moins que les hommes soient lourdement en sous-nombre, quand il y a une discussion polémique (je ne sais pas si cette expression veut vraiment dire quelque chose), les hommes ont d'une manière générale plus tendance à interrompre les filles que l'inverse, et s'interrompent moins entre eux qu'ils n'interrompent les femmes (mais les hommes entre eux semblent s'interrompre plus que les femmes entre elles). Vu que je l'ai observé dans d'autres groupes que les miens, c'est peut-être propre à la région parisienne.

- Autant c'est vrai au tribunal (nul besoin de prouver que les femmes ont l'avantage lors de la garde des enfants, lors de la conclusion du divorce, etc), autant ça ne l'est pas spécialement ailleurs. Peut-être à l'école, mais alors au collège et au lycée, non. Ou alors je ne vois pas ce que tu veux dire.

Ensuite, c'est généralement une conséquence de cette même discrimination genrée. L'homme fait des études scientifiques et de la politique, la femme fait dans le littéraire et s'occupe des gamins. C'est une division genrée de la société qui tourne massivement à l'avantage des hommes dans les questions de hiérarchie, de symbolisme du pouvoir, d'accession à la légitimité. Ca tourne parfois aussi à l'avantage des femmes (comme dans le domaine domestique).

Mais en soit, tu confirmes quelque chose : il y a une division genrée de la société, et tu sembles effectivement trouver ça anormal, en tout cas quand ça désavantage les hommes.",0,1394023994,null,0,false,0,cfuwyz2,t3_1yz2xi,t1_cfuwyz2,t1_cfuw7we,null,1432667064,2,false,Politique,t5_2sppv,2

It doesn't matter that not all patents result in products. It is a strategic means for companies to position themselves in the market. And that in itself means economic benefit. 

With a price tag of 30k plus for a European patent, companies don't register a patent if there is no economic benefit. Thus, I maintain that patents are the most important indicator. And I haven't seen an argument showing the contrary.

* 1. ""Because we're by law required to get a higher pay than those who are under 25.""

Not the case in Germany. So no problem there.

* 2. ""In Denmark the education is separated into school and work experience""

Same here. But you are in a bakery from the start, the *Ausbildung* is 3 years - half school/half bakery.

* 3. ""I'm not entirely sure how to approach this, though.. This is where I'm going to need some help and information.""

As I said, I can't help you much there, hope someone else will answer this. But you should write *Bewerbungen* to *Bäckereien* who have open *Ausbildungsplätze*.
Personally, I think you could find some. Baker isn't that popular because people have to get up early. :P
(You must have a ""Hauptschulabschluss"" to apply in most cases. Did you finish a school in Denmark? If yes, it won't be a problem.)

* 4. ""As far as I know, if I do this, I'll be working at the german apprenticeship wage. That's fine""

Yep. But in most cases it won't be enough to make a living from. In Germany we have *Berufsausbildungsbeihilfe*(BAB), you get money if you make a *Ausbildung* and your parents can't financially support you. Don't know if you could get that as a  Dane too, but since you are a EU citizen I would tend to say yes.

The salary for a *Bäckerausbildung* is like this normally:

1st year: ~400€ - 2nd year: ~500€ - 3rd year: ~600€

* 5. ""but I'll need to go back to Denmark for school those three months a year, as well as for my final exam.""

Why's that? Did you already start? 
Normally I would say do a full *Ausbildung* in Germany.

* 6. ""As for languages.. I speak a bit of german. Not much.""

That would be the biggest problem. I doubt you'll get a *Ausbildung* when you don't speak german.
You can have a strong accent, no problem, but people have to understand you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some thoughts:

Your age won't be a problem that much.
Back in my ""Berufschulklasse* the age range was 15-30.
You would probably be the oldest in your class, but it happens, it's not that uncommon.

People in their early-mid 20s happens more often, so while you could be the oldest, you won't be in a class only with teenagers. 

As long as you're honest, know what you want and are a good worker, 28 shouldn't be a big problem at all.

The only problems I see are:

1. Your financial situation. Employers don't care about how you get there. You have to find a flat which you can afford etc.  You have to make sure you can really get there, no one will sign a contract with you when you are in Denmark and don't even know if you would really be able to start a *Ausbildung* there. They really need to know if you mean it serious and don't quit the *Ausbilding* one week before it starts. :P
But again, not sure about this, but I think you could get financial support.

2. This is the bigger problem. The language. You are a EU citizen, and you're not ""too old"". No problems there. But you need to speak german. Not necessary perfect as long you don't get in contact with costumers, but talking english (or even danish) at your work won't work.


Some more thoughts:

Ever thought about *Schleswig* (the region, not the city)? There is a danish minority (and many Danes hopping over the border). And speaking danish could be a plus. Sure, you have to speak german, but if you speak german and danish, that could give you some extra points. Especially when you have to get in contact with costumers too.

(maybe you could even find bakeries with danish speaking owners, so that your german doesn't have to be that good at the start. but I don't know how you could find them. ""Danish names"" are common for german speaking people too there.)

Here you can find *Ausbildungsplätze*:  http://jobboerse.arbeitsagentur.de/

I searched for *Bäckerausbildungen* 60km around Flensburg and found some, for example.
3 of them within 6-7km to the danish border.
As a Dane, the region at the danish border would probably the first thing to think about.

Do you have a drivers license/car btw? For rural areas that would be better. There's always a bike, but still.

Anyway. Your age wouldn't be the problem, you are a EU citizen so there wouldn't be a problem as well.
The only possible problem is that you don't speak german.

Well, I goes that depends on what you mean by ""feta"". Cheese made from sheep or goat's milk can be traced all the way back to antiquity, but we have no real conception of what that would have tasted or looked like. Feta-type cheeses have of course traditionally been made all over the Eastern Mediterranean, but, if their producers were not Greek, they were naturally not called ""feta"", so I don't see any problem there. 

For the rest, yes, it is conceivable that a Greek cheese-maker might decide to set up shop in Denmark to make good quality feta - but not only is this unlikely, not only would this have the effect of cutting her off from the knowledge circle or other good feta-makers and subject her to other cheese-making influences, but the penalty of calling her cheese ""Greek-style goat cheese"" of whatever would really not be that great. And it diminishes even further when you consider the actual facts, which is that all actual currently existing Danish ""feta""-type cheeses taste like ass.

&gt; Is this really a defence of quality, or is it protectionism?

Oh, it is protectionism, clearly. I don't think anybody's disputing this?

Non capisco parte delle tue critiche a Jagten. Sinceramente della fedeltà e del realismo ad una eventuale vicenda di sospetta pedofilia non me ne frega nulla, e credo neanche a Vinterberg.

La scelta di mostrarlo da subito innocente in un territorio diventato da un giorno all'altro totalmente ostile, mi sembra funzionale al tipo di racconto che si vuole portare avanti. Ossia l'odissea angosciante di un uomo vittima delle riperscussioni di un sasso in uno stagno.

Quello di The Hunt è un dramma tutto personale del protagonista, una discesa in un girone infernale di paranoia e ingiustizia che è giusto rimanga confinato nel perimetro del villaggio sperduto, si sarebbe persa la sua forza se si fosse allargato ad un contesto più ampio.

E infatti il film inizia a mettere ansia dal minuto 2 e spinge con la solita sgradevolezza di cui solo Vinterberg tra gli ex Dogma è ormai capace. Quel misto di disagio e rifiuto che quelle narrazioni spigolose portano.

Vinterberg è stato sempre un pessimista, ed è spietato nel non lasciare neanche nella chiusura un minimo di speranza di redenzione e normalità.

La macchia del sospetto rimane come una cappa addosso al protagonista dall'inizio alla fine.

Non capisco sinceramente il coraggio cosa c'entri.

Per quanto riguarda 12 anni schiavo, non lo ritengo un brutto film, è un compitino bello pulito, leccato, white guilter quanto basta. Mi sono goduto i due o tre tocchi di classe che comunque sono innegabili (il piano sequenza sulle frustate a Lupita è da mani nei capelli), ma è il classico film strappaoscar che permetterà a McQueen di tornare a fare, con più soldi e più libertà, le sue cose con Fassbender nudo (che a me non piacciono, ma sono gusti).

Su La Grande Bellezza:
ritengo che sovrastimi il tutto, ma è una mia impressione.

Il film è abbastanza chiaramente la rappresentazione di un percorso alla scoperta della bellezza vera (che per il protagonista è poi l'ispirazione per scrivere il suo secondo romanzo), nascosta sotto strati di paccottiglia e ciarpame tipicamente italiano.

Quello che tu chiami passaggio da storia lineare a percorso di ricerca mi sembra in realtà solo questo: Gambardella capisce finalmente dove cercare la bellezza che tanto andava cercando, e da lì è un percorso di disvelazione (la metafora un tanto al chilo delle porte chiuse a chiave che finalmente si aprono) della vera bellezza - che poi è nei ricordi.

Paraculo (ma non amo il termine e non l'ho mai usato in questi post, mi sembra) perché Sorrentino è abbastanza furbo da lasciare ampio spazio a tutti i discorsi che poi si stanno facendo. La narrazione è abbastanza sfilacciata e sognante da poter giocare ad un gioca jouer in cui ogni tre parole si grida ""FELLINI!"". Si indugia continuamente nei paesaggi di Roma così si può dire che è un film che fa vedere le tante bellezze dell'italia pizza e mandolino e rovine romane. La sceneggiatura è puntellata continuamente di frasi estrapolabili e citabili a casaccio, così da far sentire intelligente chi le ripete. E infinitamente illuminato chi le trova criptiche e bellissime nella loro semplicità.

Ma poi il film si risolve in una struttura scombiccherata e piuttosto letargica, mentre Sorrentino carica di profondità e ""maggia"" cose generiche e esteticamente discutibili come i fenicotteri in cg, la giraffa, e il terribile, terribile, terribile personaggio de La Santa.

Trovo infinitamente più umani i primi due film di Sorrentino, da L'Amico di Famiglia in poi mi sembra che abbia deciso di mettersi sopra le sue storie e i suoi personaggi e di farci la lezioncina, con un'arroganza e una supponenza che non possono stare sulle spalle solo della sua abilità innegabile nel muovere la telecamera.",0,1394024814,null,0,false,0,cfux59l,t3_1zkraq,t1_cfux59l,t1_cfuwuv6,null,1435499374,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Nuclear energy is another example of human recklessness. Gambling with everyone's fate without even consulting them. That alone should be grounds for a worldwide ban on nuclear energy.

I understand where you are coming from but i disagree. It's a calculated risk between the progress of technology giving us tools to contain the issue vs the energy gains. Our entire civilisation is based on that. Oil is just the same thing with climate change and apocalyptic pollution destroying our climate, except slower on multiple decades so you don't see it. Like a slowly boiling frog.

I don't think banning it is the solution for the single reason that we can't run realistically without it or going back to the medieval dark age technological level. Hell you can't even heat without power or fossile fuel one way or another. ""green power"" isn't capable of providing *a tenth* of what we need AND is totally unreliable and depending on the weather or such.

Basically, nuke powered heaters running save more lives than radiation poisoning might kill and it's sure safer chinese levels of coal smog (which WILL kill millions of chinese in the coming years). It's a sadistic choice of a gamble but realistically we only have shit choices. So the right answer doesn't seem a ban to me but putting the accent as much as humanely possible on safety, risk management, proper planning and such.

Maintenant, t'es moins forte en sport que les mecs, même si tu fais autant d'efforts. Maintenant, il y a plein de trucs chiants qui arrivent, t'as tes règles, tu dois mettre un soutif, tu dois penser à prendre de la contraception. Les garçons deviennent des espèces à part. On te suggère que plus tard t'auras des gamins. Tu commences à remarquer et à t'identifier à l'image de la femme autour de toi. Tes parents te parlent d'autres choses...

Bref, tu passes de l'insouciance d'une gamine qui était plus ou moins comme un garçon du même âge, à ceci près qu'on te pardonnait un peu moins ta turbulence, à une femme, dans un monde ou ce rôle est très bien pré-déterminé, et on t'y a d'ailleurs préparé avec tes jouets depuis la naissance.

Tu te projettes comment dans l'avenir? Si t'as vraiment beaucoup d'affinités pour les maths, pas de soucis, on va de toutes façons continuer sur la même voie.

Griliches, 1990; Archambault, 2002). Most patents are not cited our used (you see they are a measure of invention and not innovation). Sometimes they are used as bargain chip, other times they are used to block competitors or, mostly in some countries, they are used as a economic signal. Furthermore, patents are no equally effective in all sectors (see aeronautics and space industry for low patenting versus pharmaceuticals for high). 
Therefore, several empirical studies have proposed alternatives such as new product sales (Liu and White, 1997), changes in firm-level stock market value (Pakes, 1985), literature-based innovation counts (Acs et al., 2002), the number of
new products (Fritsch, 2002) and the number of patent citations (Trajtenberg,1990).

true,___alt,,19eme,"Note that drinking water in Paris come from different origins depending on where you live in Paris.

&gt; do you drink the water? why or why not?

Yes. Because it's cheap, good enough and I don't have to carry it over 4 flights of stairs.

&gt; what do you think of it? taste? price? safety? health? ...?

Tastes is ok as long as the water is chill enough. Price is obviously excellent compared to alternatives (bottles) and the cost of drinking water compared to water used for showers/dishes is marginal.

&gt; what qualifies according to you as ""clean"" water?

Minimal chemical/biological pollution.

&gt; do you watch how much water you use? if yes how?

I don't.

&gt;  do you know where the water comes from? where it goes? how it is treated? (no last minute googling please!)

From what I've read once, water comes to my area from a source northeast of Ile de France through an aqueduct. I don't remember the details about treatments.

&gt; how likely you think it is that the water might be contaminated?

Unlikely.

&gt; do you trust water authorities to control water quality at all times? What measures do you believe are taken for that?

I trust them a bit more than the bottled water industry. I know that there are regular quality tests and treatments performed to ensure proper drinkable status.

&gt; do you feel like enough information is available on how water is treated? Do you think it matters to know?

Yes. Eau de Paris is a public operator and gives away tons of information. I think it's important that this information is available.

&gt; how do you expect an unexpected drinkable water crisis (for example bacteria) to be treated by authorities?

Resolution 1244 guaranteed the territorial integrity of the Serbian state, until NATO in one of its fuck the rule of law moods decided that all the principles of international public law (sovereignty, fixity of borders, uti possidetis iuris, equality between states, freedom from interference in domestic affairs) were inconvenient and look, Milosevic is Hitler/Saddam/Stalin. The least said about Iraq the better.

Basically, as far as I'm concerned (and I don't entirely like this, I think fucking with borders is potentially incendiary and I don't like conflagrations) ""the West"" is crying crocodile tears about a purported better time of peace and lawful order that never was, except to some extent for its own states, after having done an excellent job of proving to the world how little it respects the rules it proclaims.

Hopefully we managed to fall into a better equilibrium this time. After all Europe was more or less free from wars from 1870 to 1914, without there being a clear hegemon. What's clear is the appeals to order and law and the rights of small states sound hollow from those who have done the most in undermining them and proving that between equal rights, force decides.

il nocciolo della questione è che avendo seguito la storia dell'asilo di Rignano Flaminio sui giornali, la trama si è svolta esattamente come immaginavo ed il film non è riuscito ad aggiungere considerazioni o chiavi di lettura a quelle che avevo già incontrato, e questo forse ne ha diminuito di molto la potenza.

true,ptitz,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt;Solar, wind: Too expensive, lots of maintenance, technologies aren't 'on point' yet

Wind is actually pretty well integrated already. Spain is already producing [1/5th](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/06/wind-power-spain-electricity-2013) of its electrical energy using wind power. Portugal had achieved as much as [70% output](http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Portugal-Generated-70-of-Energy-from-Renewable-Sources-in-First-Quarter.html) last year. The only technological issue right now is storage of all this energy, and there are more and more new and efficient ways to do that.

&gt;Nuclear: Too much pressure from Green groups, generally mistrusted by the populace

There are new developments in nuclear power as well. To me, as an engineer, nuclear power actually seems like the most efficient and *clean* of all power sources available today. And these days you have the [closed-loop cycles](http://analysis.nuclearenergyinsider.com/operations-maintenance/nuclear-fuel-cycles-close-or-not-close) being developed. The waste that they produce is much less toxic than the conventional open cycle and they can potentially produce MORE energy than they consume. This technology is still expensive, but it definitely has a future.

&gt;Shale gas: Same as above

Once again, it is just a matter of technology. I am not that familiar with shale gas, but I see no reason for it to remain untapped as the methods of mining it are improving, especially considering the abundance of it.

&gt;Coal: Horrible for the environment

Not as horible as [meat industry](http://encognitive.com/node/2186) for example. Coal isn't going anywhere and there are [very impresive developments](http://www.co2-cato.org/cato-2/locations/regions/western-netherlands/eon-maasvlakte) in this field as well.

&gt;Am I missing something here?

Yes. Geothermals, hydro power, biomass power, [molten salt storage](http://cleantechnica.com/2009/11/03/united-technologies-rocket-scientists-to-build-150-mw-solar-heliostat-in-sonoran-desert/), there are many more. Norway is actually [running out of garbage](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/30/world/europe/oslo-copes-with-shortage-of-garbage-it-turns-into-energy.html?_r=0) right now. The technologies are there, they are being developed, tested and implemented, it won't be long for them to become widespread and eventually replace what we got already. It is a highly politicized issue with many misconceptions on both sides. I don't think it should be. In the long run renewables can be just as viable economically as conventional sources. Alternative energy is of course by no means *clean*, but it is *renewable*, so there really is no reason to panic that we will run out of fuel any time soon.

Aucun ou presque n'a été installé devant les écoles, et comme les zones identifiées comme dangereuses ont été rapidement couvertes par la première génération de radars, chaque radar supplémentaire se trouve dans un endroit moins accidentogène que le précédent. On retrouve donc des machines les unes derrière les autres sur des autoroutes où ont lieu très peu d'accidents (dus principalement au brouillard et à la fatigue). On peut donc soutenir l'idée d'installer des radars, tout en remettant en question le choix des sites d'implantation.

Ensuite, la cartographie des limites de vitesse en France frise l'absurde: changements de vitesse maximale toutes les centaines de mètres par endroits, autoroutes limitées arbitrairement à 70km/h ou 130 km/h malgré la même infrastructure, et donc un système incompréhensible pour l'usager qui se voit déchargé de sa capacité de prise de décision. A force de mettre en avant la limite de vitesse on diffuse en creux l'idée que &gt;limite=danger, donc &lt;limite=sécurité, alors que ce n'est absolument pas vrai, une vitesse sûre dépendant de l'environnement, du trafic, de la météo, etc. 

Enfin, toute évaluation objective du système est impossible. Si le nombre d'accidents baisse c'est que les radars font leur travail et donc qu'il faut en installer plus; si le nombre d'accidents stagne ou augmente c'est qu'on a pas installé assez de radars et donc qu'il faut en installer plus. Cette fuite en avant du contrôle-sanction automatisé occulte les autres problématiques et AMHA mobilise des ressources qui seraient mieux dépensées ailleurs (qui s'est déjà dit en voyant les deux gendarmes planqués derrière un bosquet au bord de l'autoroute avec leurs jumelles laser qu'il s'agissait d'une utilisation optimale des forces de police ?).

There's been an enormous democratic deficit and this sort of communication on the options is a start: Here they are by the way:

* **Option 1**: Pro-EU = More EU = USE = Liberal Democrats + Labour (no referendum and no changes unless Article 48 TEU Lisbon Treaty is invoked).
* **Option 2**: Pro-EU with concession + referendum to stay in = Conservatives invoking Article 48 TEU Lisbon Treaty to change and agree with all other 28 member countries on their preferences (immigration control, city of london protections, working time directive etc ie a snow ball's chance in hell: See Hollande for domino effect).
* **Option 3**: Eurosceptic ""only authentic renegotiation"" via Article 50 Lisbon Treaty after a Referendum shows majority of UK people want Brexit.

What is potentially so rewarding about this debate is:

1. Will Clegg come clean on the USE ""Ever Closer Union"" mismatch of the EU with the UK's preferred position? That it is a political union that is not what the UK signed up to? How can he justify that being better for the UK and being fair to what the people signed up to 40 years ago with never a say again on it?
2. Will Farage be able to expound on the benefits of Brexit and inform the heinously lacking in being informed public on the valid (democratic) and viable (economic) choice of Brexit live on National Television for the first time?

or

&gt; Ich glaube normalerweise versteht man nicht, warum meine Sätze nicht sinnvoll sind.

Also in the last sentence you are using contradicting words: ""schon"" and ""nur"" in this context can't go together. ""schon"" means in this context, that it's a fairly long period of time. It's best translated to ""already"".

The ""nur"" means that it's rather short. It's best translated to ""only"" in the context given. In the example it would be kind of an excuse for errors, because you only study it for a short period of time.

If you meant ""nun"" instead of ""nur"", which indicates a point in time which is right now, than the structure of your sentence is a bit off, but I think that's quite common, because I had similar problems when I learned English and I think I still make errors in that regard. However in that case the sentence should be like this

I see this as cover for strategic, economic, diplomatic and political interests. In a perfect world where power equated to virtue, maybe we could trust powerful sovereigns to intervene to prevent catastrophes. However, history shows that such interventions tend to be motivated by other motives, and do not particularly protect victims.

Just as an example, the NATO intervention in Serbia which was spuriusly justified on the basis of a non-existent genocide, did result in reprisals on the Kosovar population it was meant to protect. At the end, of course, how terrible, well, done is done, Serbia's territorial integrity is gone and the US and NATO/EU get quasi-colonial powers in Kosovo. But from the best of motives!

I can't say I trust ""the West"" to intervene for justice or human welfare, or to assure such interventions, for whatever motives, lead to good and stable results. History, at least, tends to back my distrust. If ""the West"" becomes a less interventionist entity, the world will probably sigh in relief.

Oh, much information. Let's start at the beginning: 

Language: If it's what it takes, I'll just learn the language. It won't be an issue. I can take courses up here and learn it to a point where I can build upon easily.. With the trade lingo and such. Hell, it'll be fun. :-) 

Financial situation: I believe there's a fund for this kind of thing.. They should be able to compensate me for rent of a flat and basic public transportation. €400 is basically half of the under-25 wage in Denmark, which is half the over-25 wage - but I'm going to manage. When I've been to Germany, it seems like the cost of living is a lot less than in Denmark. 

Schleswig: I haven't actually given this any thought. I wonder why I haven't done this, since it's a brilliant idea. Awesome. I've been mainly thinking of the bigger cities, but anywhere I can get an ausbildung, I'll take it. All logic suggests I could have a leg up there when I learn the language. 

Driver's license: No. Unfortunately. It's never been an option due to bad eyesight (40% - required for driver's license in Denmark is 50%). 

As for school in Denmark - I think it's a requirement by said fund that I go to school in Denmark during the entire thing.. 

I've taken the 'grundforløb' (basic course) which basically teaches people the basics of everything in a given trade (there are 'grundforløb' for carpenters, mechanics, everything..), and sorts out the people who can't get up at ten in the evening to go to work - after that, I need an ausbildung (I hope I'm using this right..) to continue and complete the entire thing. 

As far as I know, the german version has a few days of school a week, and work for the remaining days - up here it's the same, only instead of a few days a week, it's a few months a year - I hope it makes sense. 

I think I got around it all now - and thanks for the links, I'll be reading up on that!

Russia never understood the negative effect it had on it's neighbours and continues to believe bullying is an acceptable form of interaction. So yeah, that sensation is what Russia sowed and is well deserved for the damage and pain it inflicted on millions of lives.

Apart from the occasional Hebrew word, I wouldn't say that Catalan has Hebrew roots, Spanish has words of Hebrew origin as well. In both cases, it's mostly names: Gabriel, Manuel, Samuel, Raquel, etc.), and that happens in most other languages.

Actually, Catalan is a mix of Spanish, French and Italian. When Latin spread through the Mediterranean area, the areas closest to Rome acquired the more recent Latin words. For example, that's why you have mesa (from mensa) in Spanish and Portuguese, and taula in Catalan, table in French and tavolo in Italian (all three from tabula), since tabula comes from Late Latin.

There might be a point where sanctions might become necessary. But even then, we should be wary of making his position as the guy who stands up to the West stronger.

C'est vrai. Les femmes se font bien plus couper la parole. Les hommes ont plus tendance à interrompre les autres, pas seulement les filles.

Par contre, les femmes disent en moyenne plus de mots que les hommes par jour. Il y a pléthore d'études là-dessus.

&gt;autant ça ne l'est pas spécialement ailleurs. Peut-être à l'école, mais alors au collège et au lycée, non. mais alors au collège et au lycée, non.

Il suffit de regarder les stats d'échec scolaire ([100 000 garçons sortent du système scolaire sans diplôme du secondaire contre 50 000 filles](http://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualite-economique/l-echec-scolaire-se-conjugue-au-masculin_1421461.html)), d'orientation (les garçons sont plus souvent orientés dans des filières courtes). Au final, la moitié des filles va en licence, contre un tiers des garçons.

Il y a une division sexuelle de la société. Mais pas de domination masculine.

Je suis différentialiste : je pense qu'il faut promouvoir les ""valeurs"" féminines chez les hommes, et que les hommes ont beaucoup à gagner à apprendre à s'occuper de leur corps et des autres au lieu de se détruire.

Inversement, je pense que les femmes ont beaucoup à perdre à rentrer dans la compétition en utilisant les critères masculins de domination de l'autre.

true,Paladin8,null,null,"For reference: In Germany we have an institution called the ""Werkstudent"", which means that students working in a company in their field of study (e.g. software developer while studying CS) can be employmed without much of the work protection laws (work time and workplace safety is still there, but we can be fired easier) and much lower social insurance tariffs (about half, unless I'm mistaken). Werkstudenten usually get payed by the hour and a little more than one would expect, due to lower social insurance premiums.

That being said, I often took employment which didn't pay very much on paper, but had benefits of some kind.  
For my first employment I got 12 €/hr, but I got about 10% of my yearly earnings as a bonus for christmas. I could also buy electronics at about 30% rebate from my employer and was sent on a few congresses during my time there.  
My second employment was at a university. On paper I only got about 9 €/hr, but they expected me to work only 2/3rds of the hours on paper, which works out to 15 €/hr. Plus the aforementioned 10% bonus for christmas.  
My third employment paid only 12 €/hr, but paid my student health insurance (about 80 € per month), offered free lunch and all kinds of small rebates (10 to 25%) for stores around our office. I also got bonuses for large projects completed (a few hundred € each) and I was salaried, so I could take sick time and vacation instead of just not working. Plus I liked the company and the working environment a lot. I was also a bit out of my element (mobile app development for Android and iOS, while I consider myself more of a data processing type).  
My current employment pays 16 €/hr and offers vacation, but no other benefits. The guy I replaced earned 20 €/hr, but again I'm a bit out of my element again (web development) and my boss already offered to renegotiate my salary come summer, given that I've cought up on the knowledge I need.  
I was offered a position for 18 €/hr last year, but couldn't take it due to not owning a car.

Paet has already pointed to the delayed publication of the recording as a means of discrediting the newly formed government. Apparently Russian news outlets are drawing pretty different and way more radical conclusions from the call than what was actually said, eg. some third party Olga said this and that and according to her opinion there is a suspicion of the snipers on Maidan being on the new coalition's payroll.

Precisely.

Stiamo tutti dando per scontato che debba essere un pagamento, che l'arte sia un prodotto. Fino al vinile (nell'impossibilità di produrre il supporto), il supporto stesso era considerato il prodotto. Adesso il supporto non è più rilevante, in alcuni casi completamente assente. Esattamente come l'informazione, e in molti l'hanno capito: è possibile leggere notizie in tantissimi siti di giornali, senza spendere un euro. Eppure anche scrivere notizie richiede lavoro e denaro, non dell'artista ma del giornalista.

Se il mercato della musica pretende ancora di vivere in un mondo in cui ti costringerà con la forza ad acquistare l'equivalente del giornale cartaceo, multandoti in alcuni casi a prescindere per non averlo fatto, quel mercato va affossato..

Se il mercato invece si abitua all'idea che ormai deve trattare l'arte come informazione pura, e non come prodotto, FORSE ha possibilità di sopravvivere.

E come spesso capita per molti blog, l'offerta libera (che avviene, solitamente) finisce per essere un modo, per il ""cliente/utente"", di permettere il perpetuarsi del ""gruppo/artista/produttore"", in modo da avere altri ""prodotti/arte/canzoni"".

Peccato che in questo sistema le major e la siae non riescano a far da parassiti, e quindi sia combattuto o comunque disincentivato e relegato a operazione di nicchia.

Sono stato sempre pronto ad appoggiare i miei 5€ per finanziare un crowdfunding di un album di un gruppo indie in cui credevo, e se vado in qualche locale e una band fa musica che mi piace, pago volentieri i 7€ del loro dvd. E magari il compenso è meno limitato alle grandi colonne della musica e pure qualche gruppettino piccolino riesce a sudarsi la pagnotta.

The different importance of patents in different sectors is no argument against patents in a country-comparison since you don't compare German pharmacy with French aerospace. The relatively small number of patents in aerospace is easily explained: only the US and the EU are capable of providing the big item products at present. However, increasing competition from third parties in this field will change that in the coming years. And we'll undoubtedly see an increase of patents in that sector too.

As I said, patents are the 'cream' of IP. Copyright is so abundant and cheap that it is meaningless as an indicator. Trade Marks can also be registered in great number at little cost. They don't require any innovation. Moreover, in the balance between 'promoting innovation' and 'allowing monopolies detrimental to innovation', that has plagued the IP debate since the 19th century, trade marks are clearly on the 'innovation-preventing-monopoly' end of the scale. While the 'monopoly' aspect of patents is counterbalanced by by a substantial increase in innovation while, at the same time, the disclosure allows for further innovation, which would be prevented by 'secrecy'. 

I don't have a PhD, but I have worked in industry for over 40 years with contact to some of the most important high tech companies in Europe, Asia and the US.

It's been a hallmark of European and US policy, and, I guess, of whoever had enough strength to get away with it.

Regarding the premature recognition of Croatia, it's an interesting question to speculate about. Perhaps Operation Storm could have been avoided. Perhaps there would not have been CIA or NATO embedded advisors and intelligence sharing as well as arms embargo violations in favour of Croatia. Probably this would not by itself have avoided the disolution of the SFRY, but it may have made for a different dynamic.

The EU to its west and China to its east. And Russia's current future looks like a corrupt banana republic, but with energy instead of bananas.

This to me is THE reason Russia invaded Crimea and is threatening the rest of Ukraine. It *has* to keep Ukraine unstable, because if it stabilizes and has at least moderate economic success, it is basically a defiant challenge to Putin's way of doing things. And it's not some ""foreign"" Estonia which lives better but that can be dismissed by them being so ""different"".

The christmas bonus was in lieu of vacation, which is another special clause of Werkstudent employment. You can however get a full or half additional salary for christmas called Weihnachtsgeld (many established companies pay this, young or small companies usually don't), a full or half additional salary for summer/vacation time called Urlaubsgeld (much less common, big or established companies only) and a flat bonus depending on company performance called Konzernprämie, which is paid so that every employee recieved the same amount after taxes (medium to large companies, also successfully growing smaller companies).  
I wouldn't expect any of these, but if their initial offer sounds low it's worth asking if any of these bonuses apply. Sometimes you only get these after you've been employed there for some time.

Public transport between cities is excellent and the larger cities also have good to excellent public transportation. Prices are a bit steep for my taste, up to 200 €/mo if you travel from one end of Rhein-Main to the other, but in most cases it works out. Especially if you get a position where you can come in late, then there's a rebated ticket called 9-Uhr-Ticket that's only good after 9am. If you only need to come in earlier from time to time, it's often still cheaper to buy an occasional single way ticket than to pay for a full monthly ticket.  
Once you leave the cities, the situation becomes worse, though. You can still get there and with some planning it won't even disrupt your day much. The towns immediatly outside the cities more often than not have good public transport, but once you get out of the immediate vicinity, you often only have hourly connections with busses that stop at every garbage bin. I personally commute 1.5 hours a day, spending 45 minutes for the first 50km and another 45 minutes for the last 10km.

I said the same thing as your pdf? ""Economical potential 3-7x"" for 2020-2030. Compare that to my number, 4-8. Even then, they say that social and environmental concerns could limit that number even further. The point stands: we""d have to cover areas the size of more than just one country with wind farms to power Europe.

If you put them on roofs, you lose efficiency compared to special plants in the southernmost regions. They can produce 15 W/m, rooftop installation in more northern regions are closer to 5 W/m, effectively tripling the area to up to 15%. Germany is rather densely populated and has only constructed on 7% of its land. Even then, you need a long term storage or alternative energy system to compensate seasonal variations and day-night cycle... which we don't have.

Finally, countries who did invest in renewables now experience fuck all. Electricity is only a sixth of our energy usage, and even there the demand being met is an exception, requiring costly backup capacity for all the rest of the time. ~90% of European energy demand is stilled by burning something we dug out of the ground, or having someone else do that before shipping the resulting products to us. This will stay like that for the foreseeable future. You can continue blaming past subsidies or shady lobbies or whatever, but the global temperatures will continue to rise and so will the numbers on Russia's bank statements if we continue buying so much fuel from them.

&gt;European leaders have been more cautious: Dutch diplomats have stated that they will not impose sanctions, and British Prime Minister David Cameron has said he wouldn't lend his support to punitive trade measures or prevent the flow of Russian money into the UK.  
   
Funny trivia, [British position caught on camera](http://news.sky.com/story/1220388/ukraine-document-reveals-uk-stance-on-crisis). Sanctions? Yes! Consequences for us? No!    
   
&gt;The New York Times reported on Monday what Merkel really thinks of the Russian president: The paper wrote that she told Barack Obama via telephone that she is not sure if Putin is ""in touch with reality."" Berlin did not officially confirm the quote, expressing it in more diplomatic terms -- that Putin and the West have a ""very different perception"" of the events in Crimea.   
   
For heaven's sake, that *statement*, for lack of a better word, showed up in the [N.Y. times at one point](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/world/europe/pressure-rising-as-obama-works-to-rein-in-russia.html???) allegedly paraphrasing *people briefed on the call*, without any form of proof, and still, to my knowledge, has not been confirmed by the German chancellery and every major outlet, from the Guardian (shame on you I expected more) to the BBC has been quoting it citing the Times, but nobody can get a confirmation.  
I've marked this down and if after the whole affair has ended there has not been any confirmation, I'll add that to the Times' (and any other outlet which went with the story, of course) long record of questionable journalism.  
  
Does this look like an assessment a leader of one of the G8 nations would make about another leader of another G8 nation? Is this the level they do politics on? This would be quite unbelievable in any way, but it looks more like a media campaign to discredit any argument Putin could make regarding his position as the ramblings of a mad man. Totalitarian? Sure. Does he belong in jail if he wasn't running a country? Yes (but so do a lot of people). Masking a totalitarian state as democracy? 140% of people voted on that. But mad, as in having problems formulating a coherent reality?  
  
Putin is a lot of things, but not delusional and be it as it may, a statement like that can severely harm any form of negotiations, if one side declares the leader of the other a physically incapable. Who still has a brain in western diplomacy would be a difficult bit of investigative journalism.   
  
I'm really waiting on somebody to officially confirm this *assessment*, this is quite a strong bit and evidence of incapacity for everybody involved.

Do women there ask man out, to avoid the aforementioned problem? But, due to your excellent gender equality, isn't that also considered a crime (sexual harassment)?

&gt;**CryptoLocker** is a [ransomware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware_(malware\)) [trojan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing\)) which targets computers running [Microsoft Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows)  and first surfaced in September 2013. A CryptoLocker attack may come from various sources; one such is disguised as a legitimate email attachment. When activated, the malware [encrypts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) certain types of files stored on local and mounted network drives using RSA [public-key cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), with the private key stored only on the malware's control servers. The malware then displays a message which offers to decrypt the data if a payment (through either [Bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) or a pre-paid voucher) is made by a stated deadline, and threatens to delete the private key if the deadline passes. If the deadline is not met, the malware offers to decrypt data via an online service provided by the malware's operators, for a significantly higher price in Bitcoin.

Here's the original question put to the public for retrospective fun:

&gt;*""Do you think the UK should* **stay** *in the European Community* (**Common Market**)?""

I think barely anyone who voted on that (almost 40 years ago now) would agree with what you're saying that they were expected to know about a Federal USE future. I know you're saying the politicians did, but they've been signing Treaties with that knowledge since then.

Secondly the Cold War is over now (or so we thought...).

Thirdly that's the only vote the UK ever had - anyone under the age of 58 (&gt;50% of the population never voted on that).

Fourthly all the subsequent Treaties between then and now have profoundly changed the original Treaty by adding to it.

Anyway, not meaning to jump down your throat, it's all fun and games: but I think I like the idea of the EU = pro-EU = More EU = USE is quite a substantial transition for people. Whether or not Nick Clegg is really going to illustrate that's the path this ship has set sail for the past 40 years, I'm not he's going to own up to that?

*That* seems to be the problem. You have no idea about Germany at all and are just working on preconceived notions.

&gt; I don't know anything about Martin Luther, and I understand that you're making a joke.

No, I'm not. [Martin Luther](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther) was very important in the development of [Protestantism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism) and indeed demanded a mandatory schooling.

&gt; I'm just saying that the idea behind mandatory schooling in the 3rd Reich and in Germany today is probably the same.

Like I alluded in my initial comment, the idea goes way back into th 16th century and stems from 

1. the different assumed relationship between God and the believers in catholicism and protestantism. The historic catholic view being that education is not as important as the main goal is saving the souls and there's the priest who is indirectly (via the pope) God's voice on Earth so he can tell all the Christians what's right and wrong.  The Protestant idea of the personal relationship with God changed that. The protestant believer is supposed to better himself and educate himself by reading the bible (which was not even translated into lesser / common languages before) etc.

3. The enlightenment enhanced on these ideas and developed the ideals of [humanist education](http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=humanistic_education). 

These are the general influences on the German education laws long before the Nazis introduced their propaganda system.

&gt; I'm not calling the modern system nationalsocialist, the motives being different, it's the means that remain similar.

I think the US Department of Defense, elected officials, and public are sick of spending so much on defense for one of the highest income regions in the world is what it all boils down to. I would not be surprised if a presidential candidate got a lot of support for running on a platform of withdrawing from NATO and pulling resources out of Europe.

The problem is one week ago, almost every person on this sub, and many Europeans in general would have said ""Good riddance, we dont need a strong defense anyway, Russia is clearly no longer a threat."" I have heard ""Russia is no longer a threat"" countless times. Although I agree, for NATO countries it probably isn't, but how much of that is because of the threat of US force, and how much of it is because Russia no longer has any imperial leanings? The UK and France could repel Russia from their borders, but not sure they could stop any attack along much of the EUs eastern border.

&gt;But don't look at me, I'm in favor of organizing the defense of the EU collectively as a first step instead of maintaining toy armies.

This has been the US stance for a very long time relayed by the highest level officials. The people who say the US would stop it or be opposed to it are living in a fantasy world. Its a delusion European governments and citizens tell themselves to feel better about not taking their defense seriously.

Right, but isn't (medieval) Florentine just the Etruscan (Tuscan) dialect of Vulgar Latin? So if modern Italian is just (medieval) Florentine, and Florentine is just a dialect of Vulgar Latin then isn't it reasonable that modern Italian would be Vulgar Latin? Especially since Tuscans are the descendants of the indigenous peoples who made up the *cives romani*. I suppose Romanesco would be the most ""Latin"" dialect since it's the direct modern descended language of the Latini. But I think that's too picky especially since they are mutually intelligible.

But this is just an argument why standard Italian *could*, or perhaps *should*, be considered ""Modern Latin"". 

As you mention, there are other dialects within Italy that are direct descendants of Vulgar Latin too. Also, the existence of non-Italian Romance languages makes it appropriate to differentiate between the language spoken during the republic and empire, and the languages that developed after its collapse. Finally, when people say ""Latin"" they tend to mean Classical Latin which is a specific literary language that has existed independently over the centuries even as Vulgar Latin developed into modern languages.

I think it would be hard for contemporary Italian people to adopt Classical Latin as a language. Classical Latin is cumbersome, and more ideas can be expressed in modern Italian. 

But I do think it would be great if Italian readopted Latin words for certain things. For example, I think *bello* is a better word for 'war' than *guerra*. I've always thought there was something poetic about the contrasting of *bello* and *bella* - war and beautiful. It also evokes the myths that Rome was founded by the children of Mars and Venus.

The European **Economic** Community was part of the **European Communities**. Coal and Steel (the 'peace' community originally drafted up), Euratom and the EEC together made up the European Communities. That's three.

They were seperate until the Merger Treaty in the 60s, but **Britain applied and joined the EC (all three)** in the 70s. At that point we already had a common Commission, Council and Assembly (precursor to the European Parliament).

Briefly said: The Treaty of Rome (ECSC) was the first step, the Treaty of Paris (EEC, Euratom) was the beginning of the modern EU, the Maastricht Treaty (EU) set up the EU we know today and the Lisbon Treaty consolidated the different bodies and made the EU more democratic.",0,1394039693,null,0,1394040016,0,cfv2n5a,t3_1zmc7b,t1_cfv2n5a,t1_cfv1kgo,null,1432669810,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Yep, I agree with you entirely. If the British public were too lazy or apathetic to look into what the UK was signing up to, then that's all on them. 

I think you're over-estimating somewhat the ability of the 1977 British public to be able to look into what the UK had signed up to. Nowadays with the internet and google we are much more able to research things by ourselves and we can all see with a couple of minutes research that ""ever closer union"" is a preamble to the treaties and do our own research as to what that might mean. 

It would have been much harder for even the politically-minded and well-informed British public in 1977 to have been able to read the treaty or research what it might mean in practice - this would have meant extensive time and research in reference libraries and so forth. The British public then were therefore much more reliant on the publicity produced by the UK government and the editorials of newspapers and so forth. Given the UK government's own material, it is not really surprising that a lot of people thought we were just signing up to a ""[common market](http://www.harvard-digital.co.uk/euro/pamphlet.htm)"" and had no idea of ""ever-closer union"".

Hence most modern countries have moved away from difficult symbols, CoA's or drawings and instead use a tricolour, cross, stars or anything of the sorts. A 5year old is able to properly draw most flags. One can go to the world cup and draw his national flag on his face without it becoming hard to recognize.

As of now US gas, liquefied and shipped, costs about $1 more per million BTUs, than Russian gas, once delivered to the port of Hamburg, . That is about 7%, which can add up very quickly. 

Russian PM Medvidev ""predicts"" this one dollar spread will continue into the future. I am not sure if he meant the fundamentals will not change or Russia would adjust its price to make sure US and Canadian gas never became more competitive than Russian gas. I am going to guess the latter. 

Japan and South Korea have both offered to build LNG export hubs on the US or Canadian West Coast. They actively want to tap into this energy resource, and Europe seems to be on the fence about whether spending more to diversify resources is worth it. 

There was a pipeline, Nabucco, that would have connected Europe to Middle Eastern gas instead of Russian (namely Iraq). This was strongly supported by the US (even with some funding coming from the US IIRC) to help taper Europe's dependency on Russia. Germany pushed through Nord Stream, and Italy's state owned energy giant pushed through South Stream, both supplied by Russia, and Nabucco was shelved. 

It does not seem the EU us all that serious about diversifying its energy sources. Nord Stream was agreed to behind closed doors because Russia was obviously staunchly against Nabucco. This agreement was the beginning of the downfall of the Nabucco pipeline.  

**TL;DR: Long story short, I am not sure Europe will see any US or Canadian gas anytime soon. It is more expensive, and Russia will ensure it always is. Japan, SK, and several other Asian nations are much more willing to import it without the ""maybe we should, maybe we shouldnt"" dilemma that seems to be happening in Europe.**

EDIT: A German energy company signed a deal with Canada last year, so that is promising.

No.

German beer is great ;)
If you have a leaning for sight-seeing i would say, 
take a look at the 
[Eifel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eifel) or th landscapes in the [Saargebiet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saargebiet) or 
[Bavaria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayern)
You can find a lot of historical Museums, for example about World War I, the Roman era, ""coal break down"" and stuff.

The [Nordsee (North Sea)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea) is also a nice place, some locals use to spend their holiday there, there are a couple of small islands you can visit, with great fish markets and very clean air because on some of those islands they aren't allowed to drive vehicles.

For food, i would say that you have to try our famous ""turkish/german"" fastfood [Döner Kebab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%B6ner) ... but i would advise you to ask some local people to find a good takeaway, some are waaaaay better than others.

For traditional food i personally prefer asparagus( i know, it's not the season yet ;/), or some kinds of casseroles. A lot of people here appreciate [Schnitzel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnitzel) or stuff like [Sauerbraten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauerbraten), but i'm not a big meat-fan, even if i'm not a vegetarian... for that i really like Lyoner and sausages from local butchery's... not the packaged stuff from supermarkets.

true,DeathToMyHometown90,null,null,"&gt;  €400 is basically half of the under-25 wage in Denmark, which is half the over-25 wage - but I'm going to manage. When I've been to Germany, it seems like the cost of living is a lot less than in Denmark.

Cost of living is indeed a lot less. But 400€ wouldn't be enough.
400€ is what you could pay for rent when you're lucky. (though, depends where in Germany for sure. There are major regional differences)

I looked it up, as a EU-citizen you should get support (BAB) too when needed. But I'm not a official. 

&gt; I haven't actually given this any thought. I wonder why I haven't done this, since it's a brilliant idea. Awesome. I've been mainly thinking of the bigger cities, but anywhere I can get an ausbildung, I'll take it. 

&gt; Driver's license: No. Unfortunately.

Schleswig is very rural (like danish Jutland). For private purposes you don't need a car in towns which have a train station or public busses. Like Niebüll for example.
But for work you should find a flat in the town you're working in and I don't know how easy/hard that would be. 
The only cities are Flensburg and maybe Schleswig (city) being a half-city. :P

Bigger cities could be ok too, but be careful some university cities are either very expensive for renting or it's hard to find a flat there. (Hamburg, Munich, Oldenburg, etc)

I thought about Schleswig because you speak danish, there it could be a plus (closer to the border, including Flensburg) while in, for example, Stuttgart, no one would care about danish. :D

&gt; As for school in Denmark - I think it's a requirement by said fund that I go to school in Denmark during the entire thing..

Then it wouldn't be a german *Ausbildung*. Maybe still possible, but you should ask the danish institutions first how that would work.
Don't know if german employers would do this since they are used to the german system.

But, in case you would speak german, I don't see why you shouldn't do a german *Ausbildung*.

I don't know how long you want to wait, but at some time age might become a problem.
I don't see a problem at 28, but 31/32 might be a problem for many employers.

&gt; I've taken the 'grundforløb' (basic course) which basically teaches people the basics of everything in a given trade (there are 'grundforløb' for carpenters, mechanics, everything..), and sorts out the people who can't get up at ten in the evening to go to work - after that, I need an ausbildung (I hope I'm using this right..) to continue and complete the entire thing.

Oh. It exists here too, but not for bakers afaik. As a baker you start with the real dual *Ausbildung*.
So it wouldn't help you on paper. But being experienced would definitely help you to find a *Ausbildung*. (when you mention it in your application/job interview)

edit: Just looked it up, it exist here too for bakers. But it's not a must, you don't have to do it.

&gt; As far as I know, the german version has a few days of school a week, and work for the remaining days

[Exactly.](http://www.thejobofmylife.de/en/dual-vocational-training.html
)  (scroll a bit down)


One advice: Ask if you could do a *Praktikum* (internship, is this the right english word?) for one week or something. It could help to get a place when you're good at it. Some bakeries even require this. Unpaid for sure.

Though, this for sure only works in cities where you can sleep in a youth hostel or pension overnight. In a small town you probably won't find a place to sleep for small money.

&gt;**Scientists do not believe in EU report on violence against women
Danish women are among the most severely battered in the EU. Grotesque and untrustworthy study, says researcher.**

&gt;A new EU survey shows that 32 percent of respondents Danish women have been victims of physical or sexual abuse by a former or current partner - a high figure compared to other EU member states.

&gt;This corresponds on average 22 percent , to a partner or a former girlfriend has exposed them to such abuse .

&gt;However, the survey by EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) is behind , is both ludicrous and misleading.

&gt;It feels specialist Karin Helweg- Larsen, who for years has researched , among other violence against women as a senior researcher at the National Institute of Public Health, University of Southern Denmark .

&gt;""It can not be right. The answers are completely dependent on what you perceive as violence in the different EU countries , ""said Karin Helweg -Larsen and continues:

&gt;""It is absolutely ludicrous in comparison to a country like Croatia, which is much further down . They have been through one of the bloodiest civil wars in Europe for many years . Of course, many of the women experienced violence during that period . ""

&gt;**Researcher: Nordic women find themselves in less** (AKA_Sotof note: Wrong translation, means ""Nordic women are more easily offended"")

&gt;Karin Helweg -Larsen points out that Denmark in the study ranks close to countries such as Sweden , Finland and the Netherlands - all countries that have greatly gender equality.

&gt;This indicates , according to Helweg -Larsen , women in these countries simply taking in less than women working in the South.

&gt;"" In fact , I would say that when you ask a woman whether she is in her life has been abused , it should of course not really be 100 percent .""

&gt;""Who in his life not been exposed to being pushed , torn into hair or got a slap ' , asks the specialist .

&gt;She emphasizes that Denmark is among the countries with most years have focused on the area - and all indications are that it is going in the right direction.

&gt;"" We have even been investigated for many years in Denmark , and what we have seen is that the violence rate has declined, especially when it comes to domestic violence ,"" said Karin Helweg- Larsen.

true,Mmmmm_Napalm,null,null,"I mixed views regarding the subject of homeschooling in Germany, although they are influenced by my experiences with the US. school system.

As others have stated, the U.S. public education system is rather poor (although they don't have science classes that teach creationism, at least mine didn't). I myself was homeschooled from 3rd grade to 8th grade, and I believe that as an individual I benefitted from my separation from the public school system. Upon reentering the public school system, I found that my peers were at an astounding disadvantage in regards to many subjects.

Now what homeschooling parents are really concerned about is their children being influenced by things that might be encountered in the public school system. Indeed,  I believe that this is where I most benefited from my separation from the public school system. I saw the other children engaging in remarkably uncouth behavior that I myself wouldn't dare engage in. Drugs, rude behavior, coarse language, even pornography spread among 6th graders! It was appalling. I however, was spared those things, and I believe that I am so well-spoken and happy today because  was able to avoid such things.

Now, the public school system in Germany is likely quite different, superior, even. However, I believe there is a compromise. Perhaps in order to homeschool their children, parents should be subject to quarterly inspections evaluating their children's education and progress in comparison to the children in the public education system.

Perhaps diplomatic efforts might even remove the Russian forces from Crimea, if we're lucky. However the only other way that is going to happen is if we attack the Russian troops in Crimea, which would cause war.

That's just it, we don't want war, but we do wish to send a message. That's why we send security forces to Ukraine to ensure Putin does not invade further, thus cause more deaths, and send a strong message his regime that he better back down.

Look, I'm with you here. I don't want war, but I don't want to leave the Ukrainians to rot either. We need to show solidarity for one, but we also need to show Putin strength and unity.

The only way he will learn that he has gone too far is if we point a gun at him. We can't just do empty words or economic sanctions. It's way too soft for what he is doing here. This is the time where you need to be a bit pragmatic and wave the European flag.

You cannot make any statement about equality, if we only have data for one gender. That is my point. Violence against women is only a violation of gender equality, if the violence is specifically directed towards women. If the violence is ""general"" violence, i.e. directed against men and women, it has nothing to do with gender equality, because both genders are affected equally.

Because only women were interviewed for this study, we can not conclude anything about gender equality from it, as we do not have the comparison.

Cancellando come fa il Sistema Operativo (quindi con dei marcatori di cancellazione ma senza cancellare fisicamente i dati) si, i dati sono recuperabili.

Per il fatto di cancellare roba che non andrebbe cancellata e quindi piantando il SO, sarebbe un problema solo in caso di cancellazione indiscriminata di tutte le celle del disco. Ma se la cancellazione si fa su file e dati ben definiti (come nel caso di queste crittazioni), non c'è questo rischio.

Ora, io all'uni non ho preso il curriculum di sicurezza e crittazione ma quello di sistemi informativi su reti, ma a meno di dire castronerie, per crittare i dati devi prelevare i dati, crittarli (modificandone quindi la composizione basandoti su una chiave di crittazione) e poi riscriverli. Il fatto che abbiano fatto tutto sto ambaradan piuttosto che sovrascrivere i file incriminati con valori a caso e video di rickroll, fa capire che lo scopo non è eliminare i dati in quanto scomodi, ma spillare i soldi.

Which country are you talking about? NATO doesn't have any bases in Ukraine. The Russian Sevastopol base has been granted operational rights before the Budapest Memorandum, so it's still legitimate for another thirty years.

&gt;A dictator doesn't own the people's land, nor does he own their lives, so it is it fair for that dictator to make decisions like that?

These situations have to be taken case by case. Technically there never was a Ukrainian state, since it was always part of whichever form Russia went by. Does that mean Russia should be allowed to claim that again?

I do agree that if an ethnic group, which does not coincide with the ethnic majority of a country, is the majority in a specific area, it should be allowed self-determination. Otherwise it's really a passive form of oppression. As far as Crimea goes, it would be just about as independent as Bashkortostan. If would be engulfed by Russia pretty much the day after independence (as it pretty much happened already). 

The problem is that there's no guarantee that Putin will stop at Crimea. As the Georgian crisis proved, a country which was under the influence of the Soviet Union before 1990 and has not become a member of NATO since then can be overrun by Russia without any major risks - aside from the occasional slap on the wrist by the EU.

Anyways, there's not solid line for Russian-Ukrainian ethnic borders in Ukraine. Yes, one can be made for the MAJORITY of areas which are separated, but there are pockets and bubbles of Russians living in the Western half and Ukrainians living in the Eastern half. So a partitioning wouldn't work, since many populations might become newfound minorities in their new states.

 * 2002: Hero, oscar vinto dal dimenticato Nowhere in Africa.
 * 1998: Central Do Brasil, evito di dirvi chi ha vinto.

Ma ritengo ""La Grande Bellezza"" un film tutto sommato apprezzabile. E' un film che non ti costringe a prendere nessuna posizione su niente, e ti inserisce un tarlo in testa difficile da estirpare, è un film filosofico che non ha niente a che vedere con forzate analisi sociologiche che partono sostanzialmente dal titolo per arrivare a rimpiangere una grande bellezza che non c'è più. Tutte scemenze di gente troppo impegnata a concretizzare ad ogni costo e solo per futili motivi di convenienza. Si disse lo stesso del film di Fellini al quale si ispira e quindi sarebbe il caso di incominciare a pensare che questa famosa grande bellezza che non c'è più non ci sia mai stata. Ed è questo ciò che a me dice, siamo solo umani piccoli che amano illudersi. Siamo tutti, nel nostro piccolo, i re dei medriocri (tanto per citare Milos Forman).
È un film che galleggia sulla vita e ci plana sopra senza pretese, offrendone semplici squarci e possibili interpretazioni. Partendo dalla vita alla quale tutti aspireremmo, quella dei ricchi che non hanno bisogno di lavorare, per arrivare a dipingerne le piccolezze e le miserie di chi teoricamente dovrebbe essere, secondo l'immaginario collettivo, felice.
Vite misere e vuote sapientemente affiancate da chi di ciò ne è perfettamente cosciente e nel suo esserne cosciente trova il modo di affrontarle con ironia. La bellezza esteriore non riuscirà mai ad intaccare neanche minimamente una vita piatta costruita sull'assenza di bisogni, solo una spiccata sensibilità emozionale può farlo, e anche se immersa nel brutto ne vedrà la bellezza.

E' questa la grandezza di questo film: non ha una trama ben definita, eppure dice qualcosa di diverso a chiunque lo guardi. E questa è una cosa che mi fa impazzire.

Di film sottovalutati e da rivalutare ne ho un milione che non saprei neanche da dove cominciare, però se proprio dovessi sceglierne uno direi ""Rosencrantz e Guildenstern sono morti"" di Tom Stoppard.

But the highest ranking US defense official said he understands most European NATO members wont be able to meet their minimum targets anytime soon, but should at least consolidate forces to avoid redundancy and ""do more with less.""

&gt;Europe has the capability of holding its own today but currently the largest nations rather look after their own individual interests while the periphery nations are left floating on their own.

I am not sure I agree with that. That is precisely why the US is reluctant to pull forces out of Europe, despite expressing the interest in doing so. The UK and France are capable, but many other nations do not take their defense seriously, and expect the US, UK, and France to pick up the tab. This deferral of responsibility made the highest ranking US defense official threaten to leave NATO if trends continued. His speech has changed behavior very little, many European NATO members have cut even more since he made it in 2011.

Here is a list of NATO members and the last time they met NATO's 2% target:

* **Albania**: Hasnt met target since **1996**, save for 2008, 2009
* **Belgium**: Hasnt met target since **1992**, now at about half
* **Bulgaria**: Hasn't met target since **2010**
* **Canada**: Hasn't met target since **1990**
* **Croatia**: Hasnt met target since **2004**
* **Czech Republic**: Hasn't met since **1995**, save 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005
* **Denmark**: Hasn't met target since **1992**
* **Estonia**: Hasnt met target since records began for that country in **1992**, Save 2007-2009
* ***France: Always met target***
* **Germany**: Hasn't met target since **1993**
* ***Greece: Always met target***
* **Hungary**: Hasnt met target since **1995**, now less than half
* **Iceland**: Data started in 2009, **never met**. **At 5% of funding target**
* **Italy**: Hasnt met since **1994**, save 1999-2004
* **Latvia**: **Never met**, now at less than half

* **Netherlands**: Hasnt met since **1995**
* **Norway**: Hasnt met since **2000**
* **Poland**: Hasnt met since **1999**, Save 2007
* **Portugal**: fairly consistent. Missing the target and meeting it about 50% each since 1999
* **Romania**: Hasnt met since **2006**. Steep decline.
* **Slovakia**: Hasnt met since **1998**
* **Slovenia**: Hasnt met since **1993**
* **Spain**: Hasn't met since **1990**, well under half of target today

I can't speak for Germany and Poland but for all our history of conflict and subjugation by the British we still forged history together, we contributed and gained from each other in all our developments, from England we were given Shakespeare to England we gave Joyce, Berkeley for Hume, Boyle for Newton.

This is where the brotherhood of Europe comes from its from us on the ground, we have at the same time a history of conflict but where did that arrise from? In our more civilized era a town east of the Rhine did not decide one day to march on a town to the west, no it has always been directed from above, even in Ireland while we starved while our produce was being shipped to England who benefitted from this? Not us thats for fucking certain but at the same time neither did our English brothers, no, it was simply the land-owners, the bankers and the aristocrats of all sorts who had them toiling in factories while we starved in fields, at the same time it wasn't the German people who benefitted from invading your lands and its not the Russian people who are benefitting from invading Crimea.

This is why a joint defence force is necessary, one tasked with upholding the wellbeing of each and every threat to our members with *no exception*, because as is the leaders in the West who fear losing out on a bit of business with the Russian Oligarchs will happily sit back let our Eastern preiphery burn while Putin plays Tsar if he offers a higher price in return.

Parce qu'il passe son temps à les flatter. Il y une flatterie commune à l'ensemble de son lectorat qui fait qu'il termine une phrase sur deux par ""pour comprendre il faut avoir le niveau"". Mais cette partie de son public fait l’objet d'une attention toute particulière, Soral va systématiquement trouver des excuses pour tout ce qui peut être reproché à un membre de cette communauté, par exemple:

* Le 11 septembre et Merah n'ont évidement rien a voir avec l'Islam.

* C'est pas sa faute si le jeune traite les filles de pute dans la rue, c'est celle de la pornographie qui lui a donné une mauvaise image de la femme occidentale.

* En plus il n'a pas d'argent le pauvre donc il ne peut pas niquer donc il est frustré d’où les violences sexuelles.

* Les rappeurs analphabètes qui passent en boucle sur Skyrock ne sont pas là parce qu'ils vendent des disques. C'est les maisons de disque qui les choisissent juste pour donner une mauvaise image des banlieues, tout le monde sait qu'elles se foutent de faire de l'argent.

Je m’arrête aux exemples que j'ai en tête, j'ai la flemme d'en chercher d'autres. Son public étant extrêmement fière et arrogant, Soral est sûr de faire mouche.

En fait je me demande pourquoi Soral est tout colère contre les associations comme SOS racisme, ils utilisent exactement les mêmes méthodes.

Actually, it is relevant. USA along with most of it's NATO allies, from 1999 to the present day, has been infringing on the sovereignty of Yugoslavia (latter Serbia) through an illegal military intervention, and later set up a terrible precedent by recognizing the unilateral independence of Kosovo in 2008. This recognition was illegal and violated the the UN Charter, the Constitution of Serbia, the Helsinki Final Act, UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and the Badinter Commission. When the majority of UN Security council members violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a nation, this gives the excuse to other nations to do so as well.

&gt; This is because the money supply depends not just on monetary base, but also velocity of circulation. For example, if there is a sharp fall in transactions (velocity of circulation) then it may be necessary to print money to avoid deflation (see: example of US and increasing money supply)

&gt; In the liquidity trap of 2008-2012, the Bank of England pursued quantitative easing (increasing the monetary base) but this only had a minimal impact on underlying inflation. This is because although banks saw an increase in their reserves, they were reluctant to increase bank lending.

&gt; However, if a Central Bank pursued quantitative easing (increasing money supply) during a normal period of economic activity then it would cause inflation.

I don't know if this explains it, but it's all I could find. So basically if there is a sharp fall in transactions, a lot of money must be printed in order to stop deflation thus we can conclude that if we print money during such a moment, the amount of money will increase without inflation.

It apparently has been done before.

My guess would be that it isn't the right moment now because there isn't a sharp decrease in transactions. Still a guess though.",0,1394055089,null,0,1394055352,0,cfvabxk,t3_1zmdvo,t1_cfvabxk,t1_cfv65ts,null,1432673500,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Il en existe dans plein d'autres professions, par exemple en restauration collective. Je m'étonnais auprès d'un patron d'une cafétéria où je travaillais du fait que le repas n'était pas ""offert"" comme il se doit en restauration et la réponse à été :""c'est une convention collective"".

Das belegt allerdings überhaupt nichts, ich könnte jetzt auch 20 Artikel oder Dokus auf Youtube posten, die das genaue Gegenteil behaupten und zeigen. Schon in den Kommentaren des von dir geposteten Artikels finden sich haufenweise Gegenbeispiele.

Sind eben nicht alle so naiv - besonders nicht diejenigen, die schon mal im echten Leben das Vergnügen hatten längere Zeit Kontakt mit Zigeunern zu haben.

&gt;Aber die Ursachensache erfordert eben etwas mehr Denken und könnte ja schlimmstenfalls sogar darauf hinweisen, dass man selbst womöglich auch eine Ursache des Problems ist..

Das wage ich zu bezweifeln. Es gibt durchaus auch andere Bevölkerungsschichten, die ähnlich sozial und finanziell schwach wie Sinti &amp; Roma sind. Komischerweise gehört dort Klauen nicht zum guten Ton, Kinder werden nicht Betteln geschickt und besuchen trotzdem die Schule und man zieht auch nicht durch die Gegend, baut fragwürdige ""Unterkünfte"" und hinterlässt dabei überall seinen Müll und Abfall. Das ist nun mal ein Verhalten, dass zur ""Kultur"" der Sinti &amp; Roma gehört.

Dass Sinti &amp; Roma diskriminiert werden, liegt einzig und allein an deren Verhalten. Im Gegensatz zu Afrikanern, Türken oder sonstigen Gruppen, die gelegentlich unter echtem Rassismus leiden, sind Zigeuner nämlich oft rein äußerlich überhaupt nicht von (Ost-)Europäern zu unterscheiden. Wenn man aber natürlich nur in seinem versifften Ghetto abhängt oder in selbstgebauten Hütten haust, die Nachbarschaft zumüllt, auf der Straße pisst und scheißt und dann auch noch die Leute durch Stehlen, Klauen, Betteln und sonstige asoziale Verhaltensweisen belästigt, muss man  schon mal mit Ressentiments rechnen... das ist kein Rassismus, sondern vernünftige Ablehnungshaltung.",1,1394056277,null,0,false,0,cfvay0h,t3_1zm89r,t1_cfvay0h,t1_cfv9014,null,1432673789,0,false,de,t5_22i0,0

We use one of [these](http://media.maginea.com/m2/products/00/00/88/69/M20000886921_2.jpg) in my family, so yes but it's filtered. However I regularly drink unfiltered tap water and that's not a problem for me.
&gt; . what do you think of it? taste? price? safety? health? ...?

There is a slight taste to it, but otherwise pretty good considering how cheap it is, and fairly safe.
&gt; . what qualifies according to you as ""clean"" water?

Water that doesn't get me sick. 
&gt; . do you watch how much water you use? if yes how?

Kind of. I turn it off when I don't use it (while brushing my teeth, using shampoo in the shower...), I try to not turn it off full blast, that sort of thing. 
&gt; . do you know where the water comes from? where it goes? how it is treated? (no last minute googling please!)

Not really. 
&gt; . how likely you think it is that the water might be contaminated?

Rather unlikely, the water is treated beforehand. Or maybe it's contaminated with something nobody heard about yet.
&gt; . do you trust water authorities to control water quality at all times? What measures do you believe are taken for that?

I don't really think about it, I trust them mainly because I do't recall any incident in the past, so I guess they know their shit.
&gt; . do you feel like enough information is available on how water is treated? Do you think it matters to know?

I don't really look for that kind of information but I know it's available, and I think it's a good thing.

http://money.msn.co.nz/businessnews/world/8794913/irish-unemployment-rate-hits-4-5-year-low

The unemployment rate is now at 12.3%, which is the lowest it's been for nearly 5 years(12.1%). This is a drop from the peak 14.2% in 2011. 

The youth unemployed are still higher than EU average but half that of Spain and Greece.

I've read some conflicting sources in terms of general unemployment vs. EU Average(Some say we're lower some say we're higher), but from my own looking we're still 0.3% above the EU average unemployment rate.

Ireland has been one of the fastest countries in unemployment rate reduction in the EU. Though part of me is suspicious as to the reasoning(Emigration?).

Dallas Buyers Club è spaventoso - nel senso buono del termine-. Matthew McCounaghey è irriconoscibilwe, e non solo perchè ha perso nmila chili. Lo vedi e dici ""ma questo è lo stesso di true detective, di sahara, di come farsi lasciare in dieci giorni - assurdo""

Gravity IMHO è un bel film oltre che uno showcase impressionante di effetti speciali - ma amo l'horror spaziale, e questo è quanto più si avvicina.

HER è splendido. HER è veramente onestamente genuinamente uno dei più bei film che abbia mai visto.

Philomena l'ho trovato lento, noioso e sopravvalutato -  è retto solo su judy dench e quell'altro che non ricordo, ma non è imho abbastanza.

He was not impeached, he was removed. Impeachment is a democratic way of suspending a president, with clear procedures that were not respected in this case. 

Here's from another redditor that explains:

&gt; Section 111 of the Ukraine constitution states the following Article 111. The President of Ukraine may be removed from the office by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in compliance with a procedure of impeachment if he commits treason or other crime. The issue of the removal of the President of Ukraine from the office in compliance with a procedure of impeachment shall be initiated by the majority of the constitutional membership of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine shall establish a special ad hoc investigating commission, composed of special prosecutor and special investigators to conduct an investigation. The conclusions and proposals of the ad hoc investigating commission shall be considered at the meeting of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. On the ground of evidence, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine shall, by at least two-thirds of its constitutional membership, adopt a decision to bring charges against the President of Ukraine. The decision on the removal of the President of Ukraine from the office in compliance with the procedure of impeachment shall be adopted by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine by at least three-quarters of its constitutional membership upon a review of the case by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, and receipt of its opinion on the observance of the constitutional procedure of investigation and consideration of the case of impeachment, and upon a receipt of the opinion of the Supreme Court of Ukraine to the effect that the acts, of which the President of Ukraine is accused, contain elements of treason or other crime.
They had to get 3/4 of the Rada. Constitutional Rada membership is 450. (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkhovna_Rada[1] ) and last I checked 75% of 450 is 337.5 so 338. The vote they took was 328:0, with 122 deputies absent and of course their was no review by the constitutional court at all.

The US would like to shift resources to Asia, but has not ""sold out"" Europe even though they continually cut their defense capabilities. The US has been warning Europeans it will not finance European defense indefinitely for two decades. 

If the US ever did pull significant forces out of Europe it would not be ""selling out"" anyone. It would be making good on a warning its been repeating over, and over, and over for two decades. I responded to you above, I invite you to watch that video of the US Secretary of Defense (highest ranking defense official) speaking to European defense ministers, and take a look at those statistics. 

Given force consolidation has pretty much been shelved and European NATO members have even cut more after this speech, I think the notion that the US would be selling out anyone is laughable. If anyone is selling out anyone, it is most European NATO members selling out the US. They want all the benefits to NATO membership with none of the costs. The US has spent more on Europe's defense than it would like for a *long* time now. 

Also, Ireland has not spent over 1% of GDP on defense since 1997. Today it is at 0.6%. Therein lies the problem. For a credible defense force European nations, aside from the UK and France, actually have to put forth an effort. This has clearly been easier said than done.

The US would not be selling out Europe should it leave. It would like to move resources elsewhere, but has kept them in Europe because Europe is not ready to defend itself. If it ever decides to withdraw support or leave NATO, its not because a ""better deal came along"", its because the vast majority of the continent makes no effort to form a credible defense force, and expects the US to indefinitely pick up the tab.",0,1394059839,null,0,false,0,cfvcpqh,t3_1zn037,t1_cfvcpqh,t1_cfv8g2e,null,1432674623,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

The thing about Ireland is that we see ourselves entirely as peacekeepers. Fun fact; Ireland is the only country to have peacekeepers abroad every single day since the UN's first mission. Our national identity doesn't coincide with the idea that we could fire a shot at an enemy with intent to kill. This stems from as far back as World War II where Churchill was threatening to invade us if we didn't join the war, and we *still* told him no.

One of the *major* talking points of the Lisbon Treaty was that we would never be forced into a European military. That our neutrality would never be infringed.

The problem, is that we don't ever want to place ourselves in a situation where we might fight a war we don't want to. We're small, our military is weak, and we don't exactly have good defensive capabilities. Many people would rather us wait it out and try our luck with whoever wins than to end up on the losing side. The only way I can see this changing is with Federalisation of the Union, where we see being Irish and being European as one in the same thing, to the point where we feel the moral obligation to defend our fellow Europeans. We're getting there slowly. The fact that this is a relatively active debate within the country is sign of that. 

I can see Ireland in the future agreeing to join defensive pacts, but I don't see us pushing military agendas or agreeing to unify the military for decades yet, it requires a cultural shift in our mindset.",0,1394060381,null,0,false,0,cfvcyxt,t3_1zn037,t1_cfvcyxt,t1_cfvcntz,null,1432674747,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,pfdwxenon,null,null,"Been there and studied (although finished 14 years ago) and also was born there.

So school first:

1.) It depends on the subject you´ll study. The school has a very good reputation on anything advertising/marketing. Manufacturing is quite new (around 12 years) but they usually do have good money and build up their courses quite fast and with quality - and they surely have some fine connections to the regional industry, which includes names as Porsche/Mercedes/Bosch, etc.
Another very high reputation course is automobile design - they normally produce some of the best next generation car designers in the world.

Generally you have to see it very different from US colleges (Ivy league vs. non, etc.) because many universities/FHs are on a equally high level and the differences (especially the reputation) is much less relevant then in the US.

2.) Pforzheim...well well. City has around 120k citizens and is just on the north of the ""Schwarzwald"", which is very pitoresque area. It was always a ""better off""-city, but was bombed to ground zero in WW2 (relative to it´s citizens it was the worst destruction in all of Germany, even worse then Dresden). Therefore you won´t find many buildings older then 50years. Pforzheim has a long tradition as ""Gold- and Jewelry-city"" and still there are some big companies there.
Student life might not be plentiful, but special - because of the very mixed cultures of designers (fashion/car/industrial/visual design), economics (from advertising to logistics) and recently some engineering folks, and always some foreign students doing great parties (recommending the spanish folks there). 
For what it´s worth you need 40minutes by car to get into Stuttgart nightlife, which has some fine house club scene.

You also need 40minutes to get to France for very fine dining.

So baseline here: It´s a ""not so good-looking"" city, slightly conservative, good infrastructure, nice nature, small but fine student scene. Nonetheless most ppl I know took the first chance to leave, when they grew up there ;-)

Im pretty much on the same page as you, with maybe the exception of Poland. They're at a fairly consistent 1.9%. Granted its not the 2% target, but still, it shows an effort. 

I have had this conversation about NATO targets in the past, and almost unanimously people would say that there is no need to meet these targets, or even attempt to, and the sooner the US made good on its threat to leave NATO the better. I have heard ""Russia is no longer a threat"" more times than I can even count. I have heard the same arguments by Europeans in actual conversations as well. Usually followed by the US wants to spend that much money in Europe to have control over them or to fuel its military industrial complex. If you read the comment I linked above, it is the exact opposite of what the US has been trying to achieve.

I wish there was a better way to search comments so I could see who of these commentators are now advocating the US, UK, and France expend their resources for the ""common* good"".

Maybe if you guys and France form an alliance we can join that instead of contributing the the money sinkhole that is NATO. In 2011 the US provided 75% of NATO funding, I would guess the UK and France made up most of the rest. That is more than even during the cold war. Its getting ridiculous. Voters, politicians, and the Department of Defense are sick of it. 

Hopefully it can be remedied by a more binding agreement before a presidential candidate runs on a platform of pulling resources out of Europe. Abrupt action like that would cause a serious shock to European economies. Either they would have to abruptly increase government spending to increase their militaries or remain unprotected. The economic impact of tax/spending aside, the defense capability uncertainty would probably not be good for European financial markets either. 

I certainly dont think a candidate running on that platform is out of the realm of possibility though.

The United States does not comply with EU restrictions on product naming, however we do strictly enforce origin labeling. If you pick up a wheel of cheese in an American market, the country of origin will be clearly labeled. Thus there is no reasonable way that one could assume an American brie, roquefort, or bleu is French, because it would not say ""Made in France"". Similarly, it is okay to sell your brie as ""brie"", but not at ""brie de Meaux"". You say that American cheese makers are taking advantage of ignorant consumers, but they should know what they are getting. And in most cases, the American cheese will be of comparable quality and perhaps lower cost. So the real issue here is the French cheese makers trying to remove their American competition.

I do not agree that the US should start following EU regulations on cheese names. However, I think that it would be hypocritical on our part if we did not, because we have in the past pressured the EU into following ours. It is shameful how so many ""fair trade"", ""fair trade"", and ""consumer protection"" agreements are negotiated in the form of secret treaties, and ratified without so much as a vote from the people they will impact most.",0,1394061050,null,0,1394061238,0,cfvda4b,t3_1zj0p3,t1_cfvda4b,t1_cfv8nl9,null,1432674891,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The crisis in Ukraine should serve as a reminder that the EU would benefit from advancing in the area of common foreign and security policy, but that shit takes time, and international events (such as the Ukraine crisis) should serve as a catalyst to this.

Is it a staged show of dissent designed to make the Russian media look more independent than it really is? Is it that by having their English language services look independent they lessen the external scrutiny of their internal Russian language services? Or is it that the Kremlin is losing control of its messaging even within loyalist circles because its economic and strategic weaknesses are showing and it no longer looks like such a safe ally? 

Like everything to do with Russian internal politics there seems to be a thousand possible answers and no clear indication about which is right. 

I can understand why people watch Russia Today and listen to Voice of Russia even if they know it's not neutral, the Main Stream Western Media doesn't do a very thorough job of covering the Kremlin's sphere of influence, especially in the Caucuses and Central Asia, a problem compounded of course when Russia and it's allied governments actively impedes them through restrictions on foreign journalists, so for many with family or connexions in those areas biased news from the Russian State media may be preferable to no news at all.

There has been neither a single military clash nor a single shot. All we did was reinforce the security of our facilities. 

by surrounding the ukrainian armed forces with machine guns? Maybe lets go follow the rabbit hole. http://m.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26447682

&gt; The use of the military is an extreme scenario. But we have received a direct appeal from the legitimate Ukrainian president, Yanukovich, for military assistance to defend Ukraine’s citizens

Well there goes that. 

oh and note the video of troops shooting warning shots. Unless its theae mysterious ukrainian protestors again shooting at everyone in a false flag or whatever it was. 

&gt;We are seeing carousing by neo-Nazis, nationalists and anti-Semites in some parts of Ukraine, including Kiev. Sending in forces is an extreme measure.

The rest of your analysis I broadly agree with, although I think a free and fair referendum in Crimea may not be as overwhelmingly pro-Russian as many pundits predict, the area has had a degree of autonomy, at least nominally, from both Russia and Ukraine for a very long time and the Russian majority at around 60% is not completely dominant, nor are all ethnic Russians or Russian speakers in the area going to be impressed with tanks and soldiers appearing on their soil. 

I'd guess at a vote for continued autonomy under Russian auspices rather than those of Ukraine and a lesser chance of a vote for full integration with Russia - if the vote were to be free and fair.

Was muss der ökologisch korrekte Konsument nicht alles überprüft haben, bevor er auch nur eine Hose guten Gewissens kaufen darf: Stammt die Wolle aus biologischer Schafzucht, welche Chemikalien wurden eingesetzt, wurden dabei Mindestlöhne bezahlt, wie steht es um die Beachtung von Compliance- und Gender-Richtlinien?
