After this incident, and looking at the fact that this conflict is not ending in nearest time, and that our deputies completely broke us and they grabbed our funds for children even- we have decided to move away from being under government and be on our own. 

We have moved children to another major Ukrainian city, and have found them temporary stay. We have funds lasting only 3 weeks now for them. But after September - we have nothing - how to help them with education, shelter, clothes and food... And nobody to help us.

We were then suggested to come to Reddit, and also seek crowdfunding.

true,PreppyDoge,campania,Campania,"Being mostly in southern Italy, I am not all too familiar with Venice and Florence.  I could give you a list of all the stereotypical tourist things for those cities, but I will spare you. My apologies if the things I highlighted for you are things you assumed you'd already see. 

Rome: 
Trevi Fountain: It is not the oldest landmark in Rome, being built in 1762, but the architecture is gorgeous none the less. 
Roman ghetto: Regardless of religion, I recommend visiting the Roman ghetto. It is in the Rione Sant' Angelo. (basically the district of Sant Angelo) it lies along the Tiber. It is very historical and the synagogue is there. There are good kosher restaurants there, but obviously if wanting to peek in the synagogue or try a restaurant try to avoid going on Saturdays, as the businesses aren't open since that is their holy day. 
Roman forum: It's a forum (obviously) from Ancient Rome. It's between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills. Since most are fragments they may be hard to identify but there they have the Regia and the temple of vesta. 
Villa Borghese Gardens: Think of it like the Central Park (providing you've been there) of Rome only the landscaping is much nicer and there are villas to see in the gardens. This is only good if you aren't pressed for time, as you probably will get lost and/or lose track of time. 
Most other things like the colosseum and St Peters Basilica I'm going to assume you were planning on seeing. 
Now for restaurants, there are so many good ones so
I'll only highlight a few. 
La Piazzetta: It is at Vicolo del Buonconsiglio 23a. If you're traveling up Via Cavour near the Roman Forum (attraction listed above) turn off to the right at the height of Cavour 313. Closed Sundays. 
Da Nazarene: On Via Magenta one block from the west side of the Termini (train) station. It is an old fashioned trattoria style. 
Taverna dei Fori Imperiali: It's a popular and unfussy trattoria with the locals. It is on Via della Madonna dei Monte 9. It's closed on Tuesdays and open on Sundays. 
La Carrozza: A pizzeria in an alley off the same side of Via Cavour just before it Cavour reaches Via dei Fori Imperiale. Open only on evenings. 
These restaurants are all near the colosseum and forum and some of the best in my opinion. If you want more location specific restaurants (example: near Vatican City, near Trevi Fountain) let me know and I can help. Sorry if there are some typos. Typing this on an iPhone was tough!

It boils down to a handful of specialist services, engineering firms and to a lesser extent our entertainment sector.

The banks and financial services alone in London account for 20% of all the revenue the UK produces.

From a nation by nation perspective the UK is doing decently. But for the 60 million labourers and folks not so lucky to have made the cut to those highly competitive positions? Well, we're left out on benefits, competing with immigrant workers (no offence to the people themselves) and generally increasingly impoverished.

Our labour market is collapsing faster than most other industrially developed european countries. And our coalition government has no fucking clue what to do about it, so they're just abandoning the ""youth.""

At this rate we are going to end up undergoing some form of workers revolution by the mid 21st century.

The good news is the British passport is one of the most powerful passports in the world. So we get our pick of where to emigrate to. If only I had more cash and friends in other countries...

The principal driver of Catholic v Protestant history in Western Europe is one of Spain and France (Catholic), versus Britain (Protestant), with the Netherlands, Germany/Holy Roman Empire and the Nordic Countries taking sides depending on the circumstances.

Edit:

Adoption of the [principles of the enlightenment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment), which originated mostly in France, the UK and the USA is a much better correlate with modern economic success that Protestantism or Catholicism.

&gt;

&gt;___La petite mort___, [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) for ""the little death"", is an [idiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom) and [euphemism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism) for [orgasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgasm). This term has generally been interpreted to describe the post-orgasmic state of unconsciousness that some people have after having some sexual experiences.

&gt;More widely, it can refer to the spiritual release that comes with orgasm or to a short period of melancholy or [transcendence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentalism) as a result of the expenditure of the ""[life force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_(spirituality\)),"" the feeling which is caused by the release of [oxytocin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin) in the brain after the occurrence of orgasm. [Literary critic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_critic) [Roland Barthes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Barthes) spoke of *la petite mort* as the chief objective of reading [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature). He metaphorically used the concept to describe the feeling one should get when experiencing any great literature.

&gt;The term ""la petite mort"" or ""the small death"" does not always apply to sexual experiences. It can also be used when some undesired thing has happened to a person and has affected them so much that ""a part of them dies inside"". A literary example of this is found in [Thomas Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy)'s *[Tess of the D'Urbervilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tess_of_the_D%27Urbervilles)* when he uses the phrase to describe how Tess feels after she comes across a particularly gruesome omen and meeting with her own rapist:

&gt;Ровеньки: огромная колонна ополченцев 27.07.2014

What we are seeing here is two Russian Artillery Batteries with close anti-aircraft and mechanized infantry support on the move. 

They are 130mm long range Guns and 122mm Howitzers (6 guns/how's in Battery)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1954_M-46

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/122_mm_howitzer_2A18_%28D-30%29

They are going with close anti-aircraft support (tracked SAM 9K35 and 23mm ZU-23-2's lifted on trucks). The Mechanized Infantry is on the lead with 5 Infantry Fighting Vehicles, BMP-2's. It has a 30mm autocannon, Anti-Tank Guided Missiles and a 7.62 machine-gun. It carries typically 1+6 soldiers (plus crew 2-3).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP-2

You can see numbers 002,006 and 014 on the first five BMP's. Then comes the first tracked anti-aircraft missile launcher SAM9K35 (up to range 3,500m) with 4 missiles, then BMP-2 and another SAM9K35. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K35_Strela-10

Then comes two 130mm M-46's Guns towed by a tracked MT-LB. What is intresting is that they are in a hurry and don't have the covers on the gun. It means that those have just been on a fire mission and are moving to another.

Then comes the 122mm D-30 battery howitzers, five of them, towed also by MT-LB. What's intresting is that the 4th MT-LB has ""Otshin mnoga"" very many soldiers on it. It looks like the Battery's one gun is towed by a GAZ truck behind and the crew is loaded here. They have lost one MT-LB (technical problems or military).

Then comes one 130mm M-46 and two GAZ trucks with 23mm anti-aircraft guns pointed back and the one 122mm howitzer I mentioned. Then propably civilian buses, a white van that is waving the ""Novorossiya"" flag, a military truck GAZ and a white large truck. But also those vehicles could be part of the column! They can move things in civilian vehicles. And they had. You don't let civilian vehicles to disturb military convoys, there is usually Military Police etc. that secures the cross-roads for this. But who knows. 

When they tow artillery with MT-LB's (tracked vehicles) it's usually a Mechanized Infantry Brigade formation, otherwise (with wheels) it would be Motorized Infantry Brigade. One artillery battery usually doesn't move alone, it is three Batteries that makes a Artillery Battalion (3 x 6 guns/howitzers) and that can give some serious fire power.

This is Russian Army going into Ukraine. Could be some reservists and/or volunteers with them, but those weapons are not usable without weeks of training and need trained officers to coordinate that action (locations, weather reports, calculations, spotters, ammo supply etc.).

Looks like the Ukraine Army has cut of Donetsk and these Russian troops are going to there to help separatists flee/ re-establish connection to there? Donetsk is the capital city of the area and the Donetsk republik will fall if Donetsk falls. There is ~2 million people in Donetsk and the area.

Source: I'm familiar with all those vehicles and weaponry. I've been teaching conscripts to use those Artillery pieces, both. And of course shoot with them live rounds multiple times. And no, I'm not a active member of Finnish Army, I'm in reserve now. And doing this because I'm full of this Russian propaganda. Truth is my co-pilot. Perkele.

i wrote about this column yesterday too, but this is updated version. Hope it is helpfull. Cheers and Good Luck! Pray for Ukraine!

Whether people want to acknowledge it or not, Russia will probably never have the power, weight or influence of the Soviet Union again. They're a wounded bear and will never be able to directly challenge American hegemony in a global sense again by most accounts. 

China has that honor. And thus, China is our most threatening competitor and rival when it comes to global influence.

But Russia can challenge us on the regional level, and since the European Union's military capabilities are ridiculously divided, and in many individual country's cases, underfunded, the continent is reliant on American military power through our commitments to NATO. This means we have to re-direct focus and assets to the continent *(instead of to other places like the Pacific)* every time Russia decides to act up. 

We can't just abandon Europe, but at the same time, we can't afford *(well, maybe we can, but painfully)* to both relive the Cold War and carry out a *""Pivot to the Pacific""* to shore-up Chinese influence in Asia *(which is commonly pointed out as the economic engine of the world)*. We're kinda between a rock &amp; a hard place, which is why we've seen such urgency from the United States in regards to pushing Europe to integrate militarily and increase military spending *(which probably wouldn't be needed if the EU integrated militarily)*, as well as offering limited support for things like Mali in a attempt to push Europeans *(especially the Germans)* to help out their fellow Europeans instead of outsourcing to the United States *(as was notably done in Libya)*.

&gt;The line runs from the western termini of [Saint-Germain-en-Laye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Germain-en-Laye) (A1), [Cergy Le Haut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cergy) (A3) and [Poissy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poissy) (A5) to the eastern termini of [Boissy-Saint-Léger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boissy-Saint-L%C3%A9ger) (A2) and [Marne-la-Vallée – Chessy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marne-la-Vall%C3%A9e_%E2%80%93_Chessy) (A4).

&gt;


&gt;* Inaugurated: 12 December 1969

&gt;* Length: 108.5 km (67.4 mi)

&gt;* Number of stops: 46

&gt;* Traffic (2007): 300,000,000 journeys per annum  *(figure for both the RATP and SNCF section of the line)*

&gt;Line A is one of the world's busiest lines with over 1,200,000 passengers/day.  It is formed from the connection of the [Saint-Germain-en-Laye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Germain-en-Laye)-[Nanterre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanterre) line in the west to the [Vincennes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincennes_(France\)) – [Boissy-St-Léger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boissy-Saint-L%C3%A9ger) line in the east. Two branches were added in the west, to [Poissy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poissy) and the new town of [Cergy-Pontoise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cergy-Pontoise), and in the east to the new town of [Marne-la-Vallée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marne-la-Vall%C3%A9e). The two latest extensions were to [Cergy-Le Haut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cergy_-_Le_Haut_(SNCF\)) and [Disneyland Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland_Paris).

But, i think, our highst court said this year, the partnership is the SAME as a marrige.

I FOND THIS:
In der Begründung des Urteils vom 19. Februar 2013 findet sich zudem folgende Aussage des Bundesverfassungsgerichts, die zeigt, dass das Bundesverfassungsgericht es als einen Verstoß gegen den Gleichbehandlungsgrundsatz in Artikel 3 Absatz 1 der Verfassung ansieht, wenn gleichgeschlechtliche Paare nicht exakt dieselben adoptionsrechtlichen Möglichkeiten erhalten wie verschiedengeschlechtliche Paare:
 Unterschiede zwischen Ehe und eingetragener Lebenspartnerschaft, welche die ungleiche Ausgestaltung der Adoptionsmöglichkeiten rechtfertigen könnten, bestehen nicht.[94]

Basically people don't want to see some modern steel skyscraper next to old monuments which are centuries old. It's for this reason the Eiffel tower was considered a disgrace then (although now its a landmark) and same for the tour montparnasse which many people still consider ugly and an abomination in the paris landscape. 

Another reason is that when you build a skyscraper you have to fill it afterwards and there just isn't a high demand by big companies I guess, some already use la defense or for Paris for example alot of companies have the top execs in a very nice old building and then their departments spread across the region or france.

I believe there is a plan to build some sort of La defense like neighbourhood in Lyon called La Part Dieu which already has some skyscrapers though.

Das ist schlicht und beweisbar nicht wahr:

Lenin

- schon einmal vom Aufstand der Kronstädter Matrosen im März 1921 gehört, gegen den diktatorischen und ausbeuterischen ""Kriegskommunismus""?

- oder von seinem ""Hängt die Kulaken!"" Befehl vom 11. August 1918?

- von der offiziell verkündeten und durchgeführten Periode des ""Roten Terrors"", beginnend am 5. September 1918?

- vom mörderischen Treiben der Cheka unter Felix Dserschinski?

Ho Chi Minh

- nach dem gescheiterten ersten Aufstand gegen Briten und Franzosen von 1945 bis 46 verbrachte Ho die späten 40er Jahre damit, systematisch, und gewaltsam,  alle konkurrierenden bzw. unabhängigen politischen Organisationen des vietnamesischen Widerstandes zu beseitigen.

http://www.viet-studies.info/kinhte/Autopsy_Massacre_Dec2010.pdf

- Ermordungen von Zivilisten und Nicht-Kombattanten während des Vietnamkrieges sind so gut genug belegt, daß man sie eigentlich als bekannt voraussetzen könnte. Ein konkretes Beispiel ist [das Massaker in der alten Kaiserstadt Huế](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massaker_von_Hué). Zu den Opfern gehörten auch drei deutsche Ärzte.  

&gt;Außerdem widerspricht sich der Begriff ""kommunistischer Diktator"" schon selbst. Entweder ein Mensch ist Diktator oder Kommunist. Aber nicht beides gleichzeitig. 

Diese Behauptung ist angesichts der geschichtlichen Tatsachen schon jenseits von absurd. Deprimierend, daß die Propaganda einer weltweit wieder und wieder blutig gescheiterten Irrlehre immer noch Anhänger findet.

&gt;Austerity prevents that the bad guys can just ""pay off"" the people, because there's no money.

Corruption means that you take money for yourself first and for the public interest later. Reducing money just means hurting the public interest.

In Slovakia it's the hardest because if I'm not mistaken those people who applied to become Hungarian nationals lost their Slovakian identity card immediately, so not many people applied for it.

So I did not explain this well.

It does help, but only indirectly. Because corruption is a cultural thing, ingrained in society. Each and every individual has to decide for themselves to stop being corrupt. Not just ""the politicians"".

&gt; Corruption means that you take money for yourself first and

But not only as a stereotypical ""politician"". It means that *everybody* is okay with doing it. If it were just a number of bad guys in politics doing it, there would be no problem. They also exist in northern Europe.

The difference is that in northern Europe, if there is even a hint that a politician could be corrupt, they are usually removed from office immediately. Because the *public* will not accept it.

And that is the one big and decisive difference.

The public in the south has to get so angry and fed up with corruption, that they will drag any corrupt politician out of the town hall, if there is even a hint of corruption. Or tell their own uncle that he's an asshole, if he brags about getting this ""job"" in some government office where he doesn't even have to show up.

Hungarians in Transylvania, Southern Slovakia and Serbia can get Hungarian nationality if they speak Hungarian and they prove that they have Hungarian ancestors. In total there are about 3 million Hungarians living in those countries.

The government made it secret how many people applied and received dual citizenship, so that no one would know how many people could vote for them. It is very easy to receive Hungarian nationality nevertheless: In Serbia for 300€ you can become an EU citizen without speaking Hungarian and finding one person in your ancestors who has a Hungarian name, of course I'm talking about corruption here.

In Slovakia it's the hardest because if I'm not mistaken those people who applied to become Hungarian nationals lost their Slovakian identity card immediately, so not many people applied for it.

Edit: When I said Hungarian ancestors I didn't mean that they have to have Hungarian ancestors who have lived within the current Hungarian borders, but it historical bigger Hungary. So basically if you find a great-great grandmother who has a Hungarian name that is enough.

true,moriquendo,null,null,"Sorry, but you are commiting several fallacies here.    
First, I am not talking about 1,7 billion Muslims, but *specifically* and exclusively about those that have implanted themselves in Europe.  
Second, Canadian and US Muslims are typically much better educated than the relatively poor, and often not very well educated masses that have come to Europe. They move in a totally different socio-economic environment. It is much likelier to be exposed to racism on a factory floor (most Euro-muslims) than while you are doing surgery on someone's liver, or a lecture at Uni (a plurality of Amero-muslims). This creates a very different experience with the host societies, and makes the poorer group a more fertile ground for the worst Islam has to offer.   
Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, you assume that all have the same peaceful reading/understanding of the Koran and the hadith as you do. This is clearly not the case. And my whole original post was about how the ones that have a different reading are the ones that are shaping what Isalm is to become in the future - a constructive or a destructive force. With respect to European Muslims this can be framed as a simple question:  
**Are Muslims going to be part of society, or are Muslims going to be apart from it?**  
And at this stage, the answer tends toward the second alternative. And this is principally driven by that other interpretation of Islam than the integrative one you propose. Not because Islam cannot integrate, but because the fundamentalists do no want it to integrate. And that is a serious problem that needs to be dealt with and cannot be simply ignored by insisting on superficial niceties like multi-cultural ""tolerance"" (true tolerance is acceptance, not mere indifference or, worse, a pernicious ""You're not supposed to talk about this!""). It can also not be made disappear by a mantra-like repetition of ""but true Isalm is peaceful"". Because, like all religions, Islam is not inherently peaceful, and it is also not inherently warlike. It is what its believers make it. And the world knows what fundamentalists want to make of it. But it still remains somewhat of a mystery as to what moderates want it to be.

By virtue of your following paragraph - Russia can and will. 

Threats to US hegemony aren't coming from one single player. The US empire will die like previous empires have - a death from a thousand cuts and not one single defineable player or incident.

Hoping Europe will pick up the slack when Europe for the past decade has been brutally slashing military budgets - UK, one of the 4 european countries that actually pay 2 percent of their GDP into military budgets was harshly criticised by Karzai as well as a bunch US Commanders/diplomats in wikileaks cables as being wholly ineffectual in Afghanistan between 2007-09

The United States isn't like the European colonial empires of the past. Texas will not break away from us like India broke away from the British, New York will not revolt like Algeria &amp; we will not shrink to a area a little larger than Washington with a population &amp; economy closer to California than a leading world power. ;)

I have no illusions of forever being a Super Power, but *we will remain a international great power*. Because once again, we're not going to fade away like the British Empire because we're not a colonial empire, we're a *hegemony*. 

And yes, the military budget slashing has had a large impact on Europe's power projection capabilities, but the United Kingdom, along with France, still remain the only other two sizable countries in Europe pulling their weight *(Poland is catching up however)*. But that doesn't excuse every other country in the EU. They can't do it all by themselves *(and I believe you just pointed out some of the inefficiencies)* and this was made more than evident with both Libya &amp; Mali. This is particularly relevant in regards to Germany. If anything, your examples and the above should go to support my argument for more integration *(and/or military spending)* in the EU, not go against it.

Also, we've already began our pivot:

[#1](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/10/11/americas_pacific_century)

[#2](http://www.foreignpolicyi.org/content/obama-administrations-pivot-asia)

[#3](http://thediplomat.com/2013/05/americas-pivot-to-asia-a-report-card/)

And you talk about a bunch of countries challenging American hegemony to be our downfall, but don't realize we have the same weapons in our arsenal. Propping up a strong EU to deter Russia and ease American presence in the region, strong ties with Japan, Korea, Australia &amp; the Philippines to counter China and strengthen American influence there and building ties with China-weary countries like Vietnam as well.

Plus you act like India &amp; China's national interests arn't going to collide, especially over border disputes &amp; Chinese support for Pakistan. Not to mention Russia's own Pivot to Asia, which while they've been improving ties with China, they're still rivals with a number of differing fundamental national interests. 

China has just as many nations trying to challenge their bid for hegemony as the United States has countries trying to challenge it's existing hegemony. 

It's not the world vs. the United States. It's a bunch of Great Powers competing against each other, not united with each other, and at the moment, America is in a pretty damn good position for the coming free-for-all of a multi-polar world.

Although honestly /u/LibDependancyHell I can't take you seriously after this:

&gt;Does it look like I care what a yank thinks?

&gt;Your media, your business's, your government and your apathetic population are the cause of most of the worlds problems

&gt;This thread is why I hate Americans and resent the fact we share a language with them.

&gt;Without the ability to have our national conversations in private (our own language) we get yanks poisoning the well with the amount of uneducated, retarded idiots commenting on social phenomena they know nothing about bar the squalid little shit hole they occupy in the South let alone a sovereign country 2000 miles away.

Erstmal scheinst du trotz intensiver Nutzung es für notwendig zu erachten mir, also einem anderen Nutzer, ohne Not etwas zu unterstellen. Angeblich, zumindest behauptest du das, kommentierst und lurkst du in /r/de nur, trotzdem unterstellst du mir tägliche Nutzung. 

Wie passt das zusammen?

IMHO gar nicht.

Sarkasmus finde ich super, aber Flachwitze gehen halt nicht als Sarkasmus durch nur weil man das will. Und ich sags mal einfach so: Ich habe selten so viele bescheuterte Internetuser gesehen wie in /r/de die sich selbst so unglaublich gut finden: Nix submitten, aber downvoten. Oder was du schreibst: ""fühle ich mich ... keinster Weise ... verantwortlich""

Wer ist denn Reddit? Die Community oder?

Ich finde derartige Internetnutzung problematisch. 
Und das ganze ist so absurd, wenn man bedenkt, dass hier immer der anbiedernste Kommentar mit der maximal-konvergenz-Meinung Upvotes kriegt...da können die Leute doch gleich ihre eigene Pisse trinken. Das tut /r/de im endeffekt.
Du hast das definitiv nicht verstanden!

&gt; Aber musst du jedesmal in den Hausflur scheißen wenn dir der Wein nicht schmeckt?

Also deine Unterstellungen, der primitive Rotz an Kommentaren der meisten /r/de User...das ist Wein und nicht Scheisse? 
Wenn man hier schreibt, das etwas (z.B. dieses Smoothiefoto) nicht ganz so originell ist wie es die Digitalmigranten hier wahrnehmen, scheißen die von dir hier verteidigten Redditoren inklusive DIR doch in den Flur.
Und offensichtlich merkst du es nichtmal.


&gt; Dann liefer eine Alternative, starte eine Sub, poste mehr Content den du für richtig hälst oder sonst etwas. Immer wieder auf die ganze Sub eintreten wie sau blöd wir doch sind weil wir das und das hochgevoted haben, führt nunmal zu genau garnix.

lol. Aber gehts noch? Ich habe gdoch gerade gesagt, dass die User in /r/de böd sind. Was meinst du passiert, wenn man ein Sub öffnet?
Geeeenau.... /u/maripool und die vielen anderen Webprimaten downvoten da auch alles. /r/CDU /r/de_tech /r/de_IT usw...
Es geht doch nur darum, dass Digitalmigranten eigentlich offline bleiben sollten. DU...du machst das natürlich nicht, weil du ja auch glaubst nicht angefangen zu haben Bullshit zu schreiben mit deinen Unterstellungen.
Ich wusste vorher gar nicht das es dich gibt...aber der rote Umschlag hat dann gesagt, dass Obraka ohne Not einfach mal Bullshit über andere schreiben musste.

Did you look at the link? I specifically used data from Q1 2012 and Q1 2014, to minimise the impact of seasonal workers. It is actually very clear from these statistics that more than a million jobs have been created in the UK in the last two years.

The author is right that it's just not politically possible for Putin, domestically, to be seen as ""giving in to Western pressure"". Propaganda in the Russian media appears to be fueling itself at this point, and we have to leave him an open door within the constraints of the perceived reality in the Russian public. Otherwise potential challengers won't come from the more moderate side of the Russian political spectrum.

The way I see it, the maximum we can realistically achieve is to get Putin to quietly starve the separatists off support. That would already be a big success, since it would make it possible to stabilize Ukraine in the mid term. The minimum we absolutely *must* achieve is to contain Russia and discourage others from pursuing similar actions.   
Putin has already lost much of what he had had in international politics when Russia was kicked out of G8. With this round of sanctions, long term economic stagnation is about the best he can hope for for Russia, which should be an incentive for said quiet starving of the separatists.  

We need to make a credible case that we're ready for more, but if it comes to that, Russia will get drawn into an economic downward spiral that can only destabilize the country. If we max out realistic economic sanctions, then there will be nothing left to lose for Putin internationally, and he will only act within the context of domestic politics.

qui non sto difendendo gli scienziati, boschi peraltro mi sta sul cazzissimo per vari altri motivi, ma sto difendendo la ragione, semplicemente. sono stati condannati per aver fatto la cosa giusta, solo che con la sfiga e il senno di poi diventa molto difficile discernere che era davvero la cosa giusta (almeno per chi è prevenuto o in malafede). se poi la legge trova i cavilli per arrestarli, vuol dire che c'è un problema nella legge.

American craft beer tends to the high ABV. 7% is what I would consider average, with some going up to 12 and above (imperial IPAs, Belgian style ales, imperial stouts, and sours). 

Its not a negative statement in quality toward British beers: I love cask ales. There's something very unique to the flavor that I haven't experienced either in the US or Belgium. Armchair psychologist/historian time (i.e. time for me to spew bullshit guesses): it seems to me that British beer really represents the pub culture from which it came.

uno dei ristoranti più buoni dove ho mangiato in tutta la mia vita era un ristorante [cajun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun_cuisine) a Ithaca (NY). ostriche fritte, pomodori verdi fritti (sì, quelli del film: eccezionali), [gumbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumbo), [grits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grits), tortini di granchio, cornbread (una specie di pane di mais che ha più la consistenza e il sapore del pan di spagna, se vogliamo, strano ma davvero buono), e millanta altre cose che non ricordo. 

poi esiste [il soul food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_food), che è un po' la cucina tipica dei neri del sud. robe semplici, pesanti, ma eccezionali. hanno anche un sacco di verdure bizzarre che non esistono in europa, come l'[okra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okra). hanno poi un talento eccezionale nel rendere preparazioni semplici estremamente saporite. prendi del pollo fritto: ecco, lo sanno fare *bene*: la panatura è speziata al punto giusto, l'interno è ancora succulento e morbido. mangi un pollo fritto e ti sembra di mangiare un pasto da re.

ma anche i posti più classicamente ""ammerigani"", se un minimo di livello, sono eccezionali. ho mangiato in un (pare) celeberrimo ristorante di Brooklyn dove sono famosi per le bistecche. e beh, le bistecche erano effettivamente eccellenti, ma anche quello che mangi prima e dopo non scherza. i gamberoni, ragazzi, i GAMBERONI, grandi come piccole aragoste, dolcissimi. le salse. etc.

altra cosa da provare a NY è la cucina da asporto ebraica. puoi andare in varie piccole botteghe a Manhattan e trovare dei banconi immensi di pesce affumicato e salse/formaggi freschi di ogni genere. storione affumicato, trota affumicata, anguilla affumicata, you name it. ti fai mettere queste cose deliziose dentro un bagel fresco (quella specie di pane a ciambella), con su del formaggio fresco al sapore che vuoi tu, e poi mi ringrazi.

i ristoranti messicani, ecco. anche quelli, non hanno niente a che vedere con quello a cui siamo abituati qua. best. guacamole. ever.

in generale poi la qualità degli ingredienti, una volta usciti dal discorso fast food, è elevatissima.anche in un supermercato, se non vai a prendere proprio lammerda, trovi in generale carne, pesce, formaggi e in genere ingredienti ottimi e saporiti. davvero, mangiare in USA è stata una rivelazione.

l'articolo del Scientific American, che ne pensi?

&gt;se poi la legge trova i cavilli per arrestarli, vuol dire che c'è un problema nella legge.

Recentemente, mi sono reso conto di una cosa. Noi ""operatori tecnico/scientifici"", STEM, ingegneri, scienziati e similia, abbiamo un pessimo modo di approcciarci alla legge e alla giustizia. Non è raro trovare gente del ramo che si lamenta di ""non capire le leggi"" o che condannano le decisioni di giudici. Beh, amici, mi viene da dire, è normale: a meno di rare eccezioni, la legge segue una logica e delle regole che non ci sono chiare perchè NON LE ABBIAMO STUDIATE. Non le conosciamo, non ci lavoriamo, non è nostra roba. [Si finisce col fare la figura dei pisquani](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/26ogx7/til_that_stem_degrees_solve_every_problem_in_the/), la stessa figura che fanno gli ""inesperti"" che vogliono toccare le nostre materie e sparare sentenze.

Le leggi e la gestione della giustizia possono sembrarci irragionevoli, ma sono fondate su basi di logica piuttosto solide. 

&gt;quindi stai, in pratica, difendendo una questione di pura lana caprina per il gusto di vedere della gente in gabbia.

Ma che gusto, ahò?

Quello che per te è lana caprina è invece **molto** importante in vari settori (per dire, l'esempio che ti ho fatto non è una cosa ampata in aria, ma è l'applicazione peraltro di una disciplina di gestione del rischio che, spero, non ti tocchi mai gestire). Se si hanno delle responsabilità, si devono ben gestire (e di nuovo, dimmi che ne pensi dell'articolo del SA), altrimenti si va al gabbio, ed è giusto così. 

&gt;ma sto difendendo la ragione

Oddio sembri non capire che ""NON fare X"" e ""fare X male"" e ""avere sfiga facendo X"" sono concetti diversi. Io davvero boh. 

&gt;non ho capito, dovevano dire che non dovevano preoccuparsi ma che il terremoto era imminente?

The downvoting thing has been an issue on Reddit for a long time. It *should* be reserved for spam, offensive posts and the like, but people keep abusing it to silence views they're opposed to. Theoretically, upvotes *should* be for well written comments that contribute to the discussion, regardless of whether or not one agrees with the author's conclusion, but I realize this is asking a bit much.

You're certainly right that this ideal doesn't reflect the reality of Reddit, and /u/boq has been around for long enough to be aware that partisans like to put opinions and even facts to a vote, but without going into how he put it, the occasional reminder of the Reddiquette is still appropriate.

If we surrender Reddit to the political fringe, then I'm guessing boq is indeed wrong on Reddit, and so am I.

Che si contraddice implicitamente da solo:
&gt;""The experts met for several hours, discounted the radon-based prediction, and agreed that the tremors could not help predict whether there would be a major quake. The scientists then left town without speaking at all. A local civil defense official who ran the meeting was asked about it by a reporter and casually and inaccurately described the discussions. “The scientific community tells us there is no danger, because there is an ongoing discharge of energy. The situation looks favourable.” Dr. Bernardo De Bernardinis, deputy chief of Italy’s Civil Protection Department, added laconically that local citizens should go have a glass of wine. A little over a week later 309 of them were dead.""

Ovvero, non nega che i sismologi abbiano correttamente indicato che non potevano prevedere un rischio. Dopo di che se la prende con De Bernardinis (forse l'unico con delle vaghe responsabilità, avendo detto la cazzata del rilascio di energia, ma non certo tali da meritare neanche una multa). Dopo di che aggiunge ""309 of them were dead"". Senza capire che *sarebbero morti comunque*, anche senza De Bernardinis, perchè la situazione comunque quella era: non c'era nessun rischio prevedibile, tornate nelle vostre case.

E peraltro il post dice che l'AAAS condanna la sentenza. Dovendomi fidare, mi fido di più dell'AAAS che di un blogger, ora come ora.

&gt;Le leggi e la gestione della giustizia possono sembrarci irragionevoli, ma sono fondate su basi di logica piuttosto solide. 

Non ne ho mai avuto il minimo dubbio, ma in questo caso hanno oggettivamente fallito, c'è poco da fare. 

&gt;Se si hanno delle responsabilità, si devono ben gestire

Giusto. Quello che sto argomentando è che hanno gestite benissimo.

&gt; Oddio sembri non capire che ""NON fare X"" e ""fare X male"" e ""avere sfiga facendo X"" sono concetti diversi. Io davvero boh. 

Lo capisco benissimo. Infatti hanno fatto X bene, e hanno avuto sfiga facendo X.
Tu continui a dire che hanno fatto X male, e questo è **falso**.

&gt;come si è scritto in questi mesi, ma per aver fatto una “inefficace” “superficiale” “negligente” analisi del rischio sismico. 

E infatti di questo sto parlando: hanno fatto un'analisi invece corretta, comunicata in modo perfettamente coerente con la necessità di non spaventare ulteriormente una popolazione terrorizzata.

Quello che tutti implicano in questo discorso è che avrebbero dovuto avvertire di un rischio. Rischio che non era prevedibile. Stanno tutti ragionando col cazzo di senno del poi, e siamo buoni tutti così.

true,gocarsno,POLA,Poland,"&gt; Most people, except the most zealous of free market fundamentalists of which the thread in question had a few, realises that water should be a right and not a commodity subject to profit maximization. 

See, that's exactly what mean. This is a false dichotomy and completely the wrong way to frame the problem. Water being a right means nobody can be *actively denied* access to it, not that access to it should be free because there is no such thing as free. You pay for it one or the other. So the real question is, what's the most efficient way to provide it at the best quality? 

Whether or not somebody makes profit on it is a red herring. It stems from a zero-sum game fallacy: the idea that if someone is making a profit, it means people are getting screwed. In reality, it's possible for all parties to benefit. So it may very well be that the solution that ensures cheapest water for most people involves a for-profit provider.

&gt; We already cited in the introduction Dmitry Trenin, who, in the same vein as the two aforementioned authors, wrote: “The Russian empire is over, never to return. The enterprise that had lasted for hundreds of years simply lost the drive. The élan has gone.”[4] Unlike the other authors, who gave their optimistic assessments before the Russian invasion of Georgia, *Trenin’s book was published after the invasion of Georgia and after the gas wars with Ukraine in 2006 and 2009*. Trenin, who gave his book the title Post-Imperium, added the subtitle A Eurasian Story. He probably did so without any prior knowledge of Putin’s latest geopolitical project: his book was published before Putin wrote his famous Izvestia article in which he announced the formation of a Eurasian Union[5] and also before the summit on December 19, 2011, during which the presidents of Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, officially launched the project of the Eurasian Union. *Paradoxically—and ironically—Trenin added Putin’s latest, and most important imperial project as a subtitle to a book in which he argued that Russia had definitively lost its imperial drive.*

* It is believed at least some of the indictments prepared by the EU special investigative task force (SITF) are against top figures still actively involved in politics.

* In his report, Williamson said the investigation had been rendered far more difficult by pervasive intimidation of witnesses, describing it as ""a dark cloud over the country"".

* The crimes include ""unlawful killings, abductions, enforced disappearances, illegal detentions in camps in Kosovo and Albania, sexual violence, other forms of inhumane treatment, forced displacements of individuals from their homes and communities, and desecration and destruction of churches and other religious sites"".

* ""This effectively resulted in the ethnic cleansing of large portions of the Serb and Roma populations from those areas in Kosovo south of the Ibar river, with the exception of a few scattered minority enclaves,"" the SITF report says.

* ""We believe that the evidence is compelling that these crimes were not the acts of rogue individuals acting on their own accord, but rather that they were conducted in an organised fashion and were sanctioned by certain individuals in the top levels of the KLA leadership. The widespread or systematic nature of these crimes in the period after the war ended in June 1999 justifies a prosecution for crimes against humanity.""

I think that if you say ""You can get married but we will call it differently because you are not the same as a man woman couple, shows to me that you have a society who says 'you are almost completely the same, almost, but not the same'.  In my opinion the Governement should give the right example and treat people the same regardless of sexuality.
The reason it is important to some people, also in Germany, is that the only reason gays and straight couples are not being treated as completely equal (only if it's just a name and 'just' not getting better taxes and being able to adopt kids) it seems is that it might offend conservative people.  This is why it is 'bad' to me, appearantly not hurting feelings of conservatives is more important than giving gay people exactly the same rights. Being seen as the equal, both in name and in rights, in itself, is also a right.

You might call it whiny, but if you are part of a minority (I'm not gay but part of a different minorty in Europe), it's really a strange feeling if you are treated differently, even if it's just a name, for some people it  still feels like they are somehow not being allowed to be part of the rest of the people.",0,1406632206,null,0,false,0,cjaw1wb,t3_2byunk,t1_cjaw1wb,t1_cjavsjg,null,1434954433,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

For the US the priority was to support the pro-west movements in Ukraine and pro-west Government, and bring Ukraine to our sphere of influence. For the EU while that's attractive, it was more important to maintain a stable Ukraine and good ties with Russia.

They did choose a river. The border runs along the river Oder and its tributary, the Neisse. Actually, there are two rivers called Neisse in the area, it was first assumed the eastern one would be the border (which would leave left bank Breslau in German hands), but Stalin changed it to the western one. Why? For one, it made his empire bigger, he didn't know if there was going to be a DDR. Additionally, as seen in both World Wars and even before, Russia is too big and too flat to stop an invading force reasonably quickly, without abandoning western cities. [Take a look at this map.](http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/images/2010/Dec/polish-funnel.jpg). There is a corridor of plains between the Baltic Sea in the North, and the Sudettes and Carpathians in the South. The shortest line between the two, more or less (they did use two rivers flowing there, so it's not an exact straight line) is the modern Polish - German border.

No but shouting stuff like ""death to all jews"", assaulting jews and destroying jewish properties is. That is happening in Europe as well.

Still, Id wager that we wouldn't have heard as much about the palestinian conflict if israel wasn't a jewish state. There are plenty of groups in north africa and the middle east that are being repressed and murdered, but that doesn't get protested with same ferocity and hate as this. 

&gt; It's a state built from massacres, that still continues to murder civilians left and right. 

Massacres? Hamas doesn't have to fire those rockets you know. If I would hit you in the head you would hit me back wouldn't you? While Israel diggs shelters and built Iron Dome to protect its citizens, Gaza spends money on rockets and digging tunnels to smuggle weapons and carry out attacks. This should at least indicate where the priorities of both parties lie.

&gt; Rockets that barely ever actually reached Israel, let alone killed civilians.

In the UKs case We're linked by common geology and a common culture that started in France and Germany and has been affected by Scandinavia. Geologically the Cliffs of dover match up with france as well. In the modern era we're linked by transport as well as our economy. 

Your argument works better for Australia because the UK basically plonked a british prison colony (at devastating cost to the aboriginals) in the middle of an area that worshipped different gods and had no cultural link through civil society. Bit more extreme example, but Israel again is a society being plonked into the middle of a seperate area without a common history or linkage through civil society. 

While yes an Island has a strong argument for not being part of a continent. We are Socially and Economically linked now, and we have been linked like this for thousands of years (not to mention common geology in terms of the physical island anyway, although that isnt my area).

true,bleahbloh,ANAR,null,"&gt; Italian tax police have seized property and cash worth €104.5m from Nomura International related to allegations that the investment bank defrauded the regional government of Sicily with the sale of derivatives in 2002.
&gt; The seizure was undertaken following an investigation by Italian prosecutors that showed that the bank allegedly had duped managers of the regional council causing a loss to the region of about €175m, the tax police said in a statement.
&gt; 
&gt; According to the police, Nomura created three complex derivatives transactions and interest rate swaps related to debts owed by a holding related to Sicily’s healthcare authority.
&gt; In a countrywide swoop involving police from Sicily to Milan, 54 properties, share holdings in 13 companies and cash were seized, they added.
&gt; Nomura said it was aware of the action taken by the Italian prosecutors and was reviewing the situation and would co-operate fully with the authorities, according to Reuters.
&gt; The swoop is the latest on international investment banks in Italy. Several regional governments and local councils have sought to take investment banks to trial over the sale of derivatives made mostly in the early 2000s. The investigations were almost exclusively focused on interest rate swaps.
&gt; Between 2001 and 2008, 525 Italian local authorities entered into almost 1,000 interest swaps with an aggregate value of €35bn, according to Italy’s audit office and central bank. This was equal to almost one-third of all the debt owed by Italy’s regions, provinces and municipalities.
&gt; In the largest case, led by Milan city council, the banks were all eventually exonerated.
&gt; Italy’s tax police said the interest rate swap struck between Nomura and the region of Sicily had involved the region having to pay interest that was “onerous” in relation to the market rate. This transaction had caused Sicily €115m in damages, prosecutors allege.
&gt; A second line of inquiry had revealed the restructuring of Sicily’s regional debt through three derivatives contracts in which Nomura had acted both as consultant and as counterparty. Prosecutors allege this renegotiation of debt had cost the region damages of about €60m.
&gt; In addition, the tax police said that they were also investigating payments worth about €20m made to two brokers in Palermo who had allegedly helped to secure the deals with the Sicilian regional government.
&gt; The tax police said they were also investigating the extent of the involvement of local politicians in the agreements with Nomura.",0,1406635101,null,0,false,0,cjawqch,t3_2c1abf,t1_cjawqch,t3_2c1abf,null,1434954805,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

They don't even come cose to being as easy to learn as English, not just in terms of grammar or vacabulary but also in terms of accessibility.

If you buy a movie on DVD, it will always be available in German and English, but not always French. Sometimes importing an English only DVD from another country, paying for shipping and even import fees, the DVD will still be cheaper than the German equivalent.

So you're saying the 2005 [national priority projects](http://economic-sciences.net/articles/view/20) were irrelevant. In particular the Health project, to improve the medical technology in use, vaccination programs, free preventive check ups, and other initiatives. And on the same vein the 2011 healthcare reform was irrelevant?

""Telling gay people to keep it to themselves for the sake of the children under pressure of prison?""

You just made my point, by immediatly replying with something that has nothing to do with their organisation of the olympics. The event was politicised, the organisation was pretty good. 


&gt; All the hotel rooms that weren't finished, that had acid water in them? All the money it took away from more important projects? I think it was pretty lousily organized.

For centuries they had endured Ottoman oppression, which at the most extreme saw children of Christian Serbs [enslaved on a mass scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosniaks) and at its best still forced Serbs to simmer under heavy taxation and an erosion of their culture. This system imposed such bitter hardships that [many](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosniaks) chose to surrender and convert to Islam in order to rise to a higher social class and these converts then turned on their former compatriots collaborating with the Ottomans to keep them under tyrannical subjugation. The waning days of the Ottoman Empire suggested that the Bosnian Serbs would finally win their freedom, just as was happening in the rest of the Balkans, however they soon found these hopes dashed to pieces when Austria [annexed Bosnia and Hercegovina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Bosnia). 

The Serbs across the Drina separating the two Serbian lands of Serbia proper and Bosnian Serbia saw the plight of their ethnic kindred but could do nothing in the face of overwhelming Austrian power. During the first World War, through a heroic effort of the Serbian Army Serbs came close to reuniting the Serbian nation, only to be swallowed up in 1915 by the overwhelming combined power of the Austrian Empire. Nevertheless, the determined struggle of the Serbian to liberate their brethren inflicted a heavy cost on the Austrian army and represented a major contribution to the Allied war effort. In recognition of this sacrifice and taking into account the natural desire of the Serbs across the Drina to finally live in one nation, Serbs were finally allowed to unite on the basis of the principle of self-determination backed by Wilson.

&gt;So you're saying the 2005 national priority projects were irrelevant.
 
Yes, join the rest of the world russia. This is not something european citizens should think of as ""something to really like about russia"". it's nice that this happens, the gods know how you can fuck this shit up, right US, but it's kind of irrelevant from a european perspective.

You may be right, but as long as the source is the cristian science monitor, I don't think I can trust that source. And the problems they did have ""don't matter, big deal"".

But I think you can detatch anything from anything to find something good, it won't get you closer to something like the truth. Detatching the games from the homophobia in russian society (and this truly is the people, not the government, they instrumentalize the hatred within the population) from the orginasation is just dishonest.

As for one of your earlier points;

&gt;This is a false dichotomy and completely the wrong way to frame the problem. Water being a right means nobody can be actively denied access to it, not that access to it should be free

This in of itself is a contradiction. If I have to pay for something that means that I *can* be actively denied access to it. What happens if I don't pay? I get no water. So as a *right*, I don't have a *de facto* right to clean water, the most necessary building block of life.

&gt; Mi spiace, ma temo che questo sia un po' pensiero magico: vuoi credere ai vecchi titoloni e alla teoria per cui i giudici sono degli inquisitori medioevali. Non è andata così, non hanno scritto quelle cose.

No, il pensiero magico è quello di giudici e opinione pubblica. So benissimo che non hanno scritto quelle cose. Ma il substrato da cui nasce la sentenza, al di là del tecnicismo, è esattamente quello.

Mi spiego. Se ci fosse veramente questo problema di fondo di comunicazione così grave, allora sarebbe un problema *a prescindere* dall'esistenza del terremoto o meno. Ovvero, se veramente la comunicazione manchevole (che poi manchevole non era, ma va beh) fosse tutto il problema, staremmo qua a fare lo stesso discorso, terremoto o non terremoto.

Ma lo staremmo facendo, questo discorso? Ovviamente no. Stiamo facendo tutta questa discussione solo perchè il terremoto c'è stato. È solo in base al senno di poi che siamo tornati indietro a dire ""uhm, ci hanno detto quello che, *pensandoci adesso*, avrei voluto che mi dicessero? No. Posso trovare un cavillo per incriminarli per non avermi detto questa cosa? Sì"". 

E qui sta il vero sottofondo di pensiero magico: ""È successa una tragedia, quindi deve essere colpa di *qualcuno*"" È una reazione psicologica naturale e irresistibile: qualcuno dovrà aver per forza fatto qualcosa, ecco, ci hanno detto di stare calmi anche se noi, *ggente*, avevamo capito che c'era un pericolo. Quindi è colpa loro. Dovevano dirci che saremmo morti, e non ce l'hanno detto. 

È quello a cui ti stai appigliando anche tu: stai continuando a lamentare che loro avrebbero dovuto comunicare:
&gt;""sì, c'è un rischio, ma c'è sempre stato, non è che ora, per noi, è aumentato"",

Ma che differenza pratica avrebbe fatto? Le risposte sono opposte a seconda del ragionare col senno di poi o senza:

- Senza, o non sarebbe successo niente, o sarebbe stato scatenato del panico non necessario. Quindi, non avrebbe fatto alcuna differenza col non dire nulla/rassicurare, o avrebbe peggiorato la situazione.

- Con il senno di poi, e solo con questo, uno può sperare che se l'avessero detto qualcuno in più si sarebbe salvato - ma solo col senno di poi diventa una decisione razionale: sai già cosa è successo. Razionalmente, aveva molto più senso la prima ipotesi.

Per questo è un problema di previsione del terremoto, anche se lo nascondiamo sotto un arabesco di capziose giustificazioni legali. Perchè solo se lo hai previsto, il corso razionale diventa ""avvertire del rischio"".

&gt;Invece, superbertolaso voleva la città tranquilla.

Giustamente. Volere la città tranquilla era la cosa giusta da fare - la prima, e principale cosa da fare, specie con i vari ciarlatani come Giuliani che gridavano al lupo. *La cosa giusta.* Non mi interessa per niente se non era la cosa legalmente a tenuta stagna, era la cosa eticamente e praticamente corretta.

Hamas is aided by a significant part of the Arabian/Persian world, and a significant part of the Western world ( see below ). Does this legitimize hatred towards Palestine?

Europe is consistently favoring the side of Palestinians since [the oil crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis).

It doesn't really work that way, or does it? You can't blame Israel for being good at protecting their citizens from Hamas violence.

We're not actually producing iron or gold, either, but they still have cost... Water has cost because a) it is a scarce resource b) the process of providing it has cost. Maintaining the infrastructure requires resources (both physical ones and human labour) therefore it has cost.

&gt; This in of itself is a contradiction. If I have to pay for something that means that I can be actively denied access to it. What happens if I don't pay? I get no water. So as a right, I don't have a de facto right to clean water, the most necessary building block of life. 

*Somebody* has to pay the cost. If we all just sit around and wait for the water to magically appear in our taps, then nobody would have any water. *Somebody* has to lay the pipes and maintain them. That somebody has to acquire necessary supplies and be compensated for their labour. So people, the consumers, can a) pay to that somebody individually b) raise money together and pay collectively (i.e. taxes) c) make that somebody work for free as a slave.

&gt; Everyone needs water, it's one of those things that should never be monetized for profit.

Die Misogynie des Christentums ist immer noch schlimm genug, und sie ist auch noch deutlich zu spüren... aber hier ruft keiner nach der Steinigung von ""fremdgehenden"" Frauen (die vergewaltigt wurden). Die Protestanten und Katholiken haben nicht mehr den Hass und die Menschenverachtung gegeneinander wie einst....

Aber nun geh' mal in den Iran / Irak / nach Syrien etc. und frag mal Sunnis / Schiiten / Wahabiten was die voneinander halten - und was man mit Apostaten machen sollte. (Siehe auch [diesen ZEIT-Artikel](http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2014-07/christen-verfolgung-muslime-fluechtlinge-deutschland-vorab) oder [diesen Artikel der Washington Post basierend auf einer Umfrage](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/05/01/64-percent-of-muslims-in-egypt-and-pakistan-support-the-death-penalty-for-leaving-islam/) oder [diesen Artikel des Pew Research Center zum Thema Scharia](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-beliefs-about-sharia/))

Natürlich heißt Moslem sein nicht automatisch, dass man irgendeine dieser Anschauungen teilt. Ich stelle mich gerne an die Seite jedes Moslem, Christen, Juden, Buddhisten, der für Gleichstellung, Freiheit, gegen das Aufzwängen religiöser Normen etc ist - und das ist glücklicherweise bei weitem die Mehrheit, auch unter Muslimen (zumindest global und bei uns... in vielen Ländern ist leider jedoch die Mehrheit für die Todesstrafe für Apostasie... siehe Washington Post Artikel).

Dennoch haben Religionen - alle Religionen - hier strukturelle, inhaltliche Probleme. Und der Islam aktuell leider anscheinend mehr als andere. Dagegen sollten wir alle tun was wir können. Das ist nicht das verteufeln von Muslimen, aber dazu muss auch gehören, die Probleme der religiösen Ideologien zu nennen. Wenn Ultraorthodoxe Juden ""westlich"" gekleidete Frauen mit Steinen bewerfen, wenn Muslime Apostaten köpfen, wenn christen Kindern Bluttransfusionen verweigern oder den Schulbesuch untersagen wollen...

Religion ist problematisch, weil dogmatische Ideologie unangreifbare Motivation und Rechtfertigung für alle möglichen Greuel liefern kann. Das wird leider meist unter den Teppich gekehrt - darf es aber nicht. Und es geht nicht nur den Islam an, aber die Islamischen Länder, welche einst nicht nur die Hochburg von Wissenschaft und Kunst, sondern auch von religiöser Toleranz und Friedfertigkeit waren, haben eben Ihre Aufklärung durch sektiererische Gewalt schon lange wieder zunichte gemacht und sind aktuell weit hinten an. Eine aus freiheitlicher Sicht problematische religiöse Ideologie mit ethisch zweifelhaften Normen für die Behandlung von Frauen, Andersgläubigen und Apostaten ist das, wonach sich das ganze Leben richten soll und muss... natürlich hat das Auswirkungen... und oft eben keine guten. Da sind sehr viele Faktoren beteiligt - nur dürfen wir nicht die Religiöse Ideologie im Namen von ""Toleranz"" ausklammern.

Iraq was...well....idk. We're the largest economy in the world with the biggest military and the holder of the international reserve currency, not to mention our various defense agreements *(NATO, Japan, ANZUS, Singapore, The Philippines, Korea, etc.)* and the fact that we have a permanent seat on the UNSC.

So none of the big-players could really sanction us without hurting their own interests, plus to do so would probably be taken at face-value by the international audience as being in defense of a genocidal authoritarian dictator *(which Saddam was, even if the WMD shit was bullshit)* who had only tried to annex a neighboring country a decade before.

And then what happens in the long term is that those companies drive up the prices and the government owned post offices can't move anything as cheaply as they could previously.

&gt;Private companies maximize profits and strive for efficiency.

And they do that by lowering the quality of the service to cut costs and then driving up prices. They attempt to maximize profits with the *least effort* and this has consistently proven to be the situation every time a major national service gets privatized. The quality goes down and the prices go up.

Public ones don't need that incentive because every dime of tax payer money goes straight back to services provided to the tax payer, whereas in a privatized service where the primary interest is turning a profit, the services need to get massively cut, people need to get laid off, and the quality needs to go down. 

This always leads to worse services provided for the consumer, poorer working conditions for the workers in the service, and higher costs for the consumer.

If they're getting subsidies on top of that(As they usually do), we get all of the above + our taxes go towards it as well as an extra cost.

&gt; if we remove their nuclear threat they will have not much left

The whole nuclear strategy of russia is based on making this *absolutely fucking impossible*. Russia possesses around 8,500 nuclear warheads. They have 489 land based missiles carrying up to 1,788 warheads, 12 submarines carrying up to 609 warheads, 79 bombers carrying up to 884 cruise missiles. They also have hundreds of ""suitcase sized"" nuclear weapons.

 Because their technology to aim and hit a target is slightly inferior to that of the US they have built [shit like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9AMtUeyDP0). If such a thing gets set off the blast can still be measured after it went around the globe for a third time. These things are so massive it doesn't matter if they get dropped 3km besides the aimed target, they blow up everything anyways. 

How can anyone believe we could just ""remove their nuclear threat""? It just doesn't work. If any serious conflict with Russia arises no missile shield and no conventional army will save us from anything.

If someone is making a profit, there's an imbalance between supply and demand: when supply and demand are in balance, profit is zero. Everything but steadily dropping profits are a sure sign of a dysfunctional market.

true,InternetFree,EURO,European Union,"&gt;So the European Union has no interests in Ukraine as a buffer-state between them and Russia? 

Without US aggression, they *would* have Ukraine as a buffer state. This would never have happened without the US escalating the situation.

Everything would be fine if the US didn't destabilize the region. But the US doesn't want Russia gaining economic influence.

&gt;They have no interest in Ukraine having more ties with them instead of Russia? They have no interest in Ukraine being in their sphere-of-influence?

What's your point? Of course they have. That doesn't justify escalating the situation into what is pretty much a war at this point... like the US did.

&gt;Russia has no interests in forcibly keeping Ukraine in their sphere-of-influence? 

The US is the party that brought force into the game after spending billions of dollars on anti-Russian politics and polarizing populations in the region to the point of open conflict. Then they started blaming Russia for pretecting its interests. It's hilarious.

&gt;Of strong-arming Ukraine into their Eurasian Union? Of retaining warm-water naval bases in Crimea? Of maintaining a stronger presence in Eastern Europe?

The US has military bases all over Europe and is building a rocket shield right at the Russian border. So... you are saying Russia should do nothing? Russia tolerated American aggression for a long time now. Now that Russia finally took a step against US aggression (because the US pushed things right to their border this time), everyone suddenly starts hating Russia and sanctioning Russia. It's like a shitty movie. 

The US should have been sanctioned years ago but nobody did *anything* against US aggression. The end of the cold war never stopped the US from enticing anti-Russian proxy conflicts yet *nothing* happened. In fact, Europe supported them.

And now Russia does things not even close to what the US is doing and people sanction them. It's a joke.

This only shows double standards among every country sanctioning Russia while not sanctioning the US even more... and total hypocrisy on behalf of the US. It says a lot about what kind of shitty society we live in.

&gt;Did the Taliban not provide safe-haven, support &amp; protection to a group which targeted not only my country's military infrastructure, but it's civilian infrastructure as well?

Yeah, the US destabilized them, too, so it has an excuse to invade.

Wait... you believe the wars in the middle east happened because of terrorists? Holy fuck.

&gt;Did Russia have no interest in protecting one of it's last warm-water ports, and it's only one in the Mediterranean? 

Yes. It had.

&gt;Did Russia have no interest in propping up one of the few friendly regimes it has left in the Middle East, one which is strategically situated between Turkey &amp; Israel?

Yes. It had.

&gt;Are the majority of corporations extracting oil from Iraq not European &amp; Chinese?

What has that to do with anything?

&gt;Or wait, is the United States the only country in the fucking world that pursues it's interests while everybody else is a isolationist pacifist?

No, the US is just the most aggressive and destructive one and - once again - the main reason why things escalated and people die.

&gt; Please, you work in the oil and gas business (fortune 500 company) so you got ALL of this shit figured out like a fiddle.

Yes, pretty much.


It's sad and pathetic how the general population is misled by lies. People are completely spammed by insane propaganda and excuses as of why they act against Russia. The leaders of Europe and the US should at the very least be honest about their actions and state their real intentions. Instead they make shit up and try and explain how this is all about human rights and Russia being evil.

No. It's about the West not tolerating Russian competition.     
""We don't like competition"" should be what they say. ""We, the ruling elites of this planet, do not want others to have any kind of power"". ""We would rather have war than peace if that means securing our profit"".        
 
It's all ""do as I say, not do as I do"" and ""might is right"". However, the US propaganda machine deludes the people and that gives the US an excuse to fuck with Russia.

&gt;il Senato è il banco di prova della legge elettorale

Ossia si prova a testare una maggioranza che poi si tenga quando ci sarà da introdurre l'Italicum.

Io ci aggiungerei anche che per Renzi ormai è una delle tante cose su cui non può perdere la faccia, anche solo per questioni di immagine e di principio, visto che poi a livello di risultati concreti la Riforma del Senato mi sembra ne porti pochi.

Le cose positive: si semplifica il percorso legislativo (il Senato vedrà ridotte le competenze), si riduce il costo dei Senatori.

Le cose negative: sembra un po' una riforma a metà, con un Senato che è (quasi) non elettivo (si potrebbe dire che lo è indirettamente), e una soluzione che non accontenta quasi nessuno, e quindi potrebbe accontentare molti.

I 5 stelle si lamentano del fatto che si arriverà a coprire con l'immunità che hanno i Senatori amministratori locali nominati: immunità che altrimenti non avrebbero. Questa secondo me è una cazzata perché poi si è visto quanto, proprio in questi giorni, valga poco la presunta immunità dei parlamentari.

More than half are motivated by that conflict. A recent study on ""hatemail"" the ""Zentralrat der Juden"" got showed that only 3% of it were anonymous and attributable to rightwing extremism. The rest has been from people freely giving their names, meaning they aren't even aware enough of their action to notice they should under no circumstances put their name under that letter. 

The lines between Israel and Jews and between antisemitism and Israel critique can appear extremely blurred to anyone listening to the wrong people and suddenly perfectly respectable Germans send hate mail to an organization representing their interests in Germany because Israel killed X Palestinians. And few sides are trying to unblur those lines.

1. You said Afghanistan was ""perfectly legitimate"".      
2. You are blaming the Taliban for what's happened.   
3. You believe the war happened because of terrorism and the US being threatened by it.  
4. You believe manipulating others to do what you want legitimizes your actions. (Well, technically it does, but not from a logical perspective, so this one I think is up for debate, same goes for the next 3 points.)       
5. You think acting selfishly and ""for your own interests"" is an excuse for atrocities.       
6. You think ""people agree with me"" is an argument.  
7. You think ""others are doing it, too"" is an excuse.   

These are the points I would call delusional.

I actually agree with the rest of what you are saying. The reasons you listed for why there are no sanctions against the US are absolutely valid. However, there really is no excuse for the US atrocities and it *deserves* (from a logical perspective and a perspective of internationally recognized human rights) sanctions more than Russia. 

The US is a huge problem for this planet and the single biggest threat to world peace and freedoms. It would be in the interest of every person on this planet to sanction and isolate them until they have demilitarized themselves (and therefore the world). The US should pay for its aggression. It just doesn't. For many fucked-up reasons.

The problem I have is that people delusionally hate Russia because of the propaganda they are subjected to, but from a logical, humanist point of view it is the US that should be hated. Especially in the long term it is in no one's interest to support the US as is. 

Yes, it *does* come down to realpolitik. But that is not something many people discuss. People hate Russia and want Russia sanctioned because they believe they are evil and the ""good guys"" need to punish that bad, bad Russia. Just read any thread on reddit.

~~I'm sorry I attacked you like I did, you actually seem like a reasonable person.

Pretty much nothing is worse for this planet than US exceptionalism. Especially because the country itself is such a destructive shithole.

But that's exactly the point: It wouldn't be fair to Russia and only show inconsistency in the West's behaviour.

Yes, I *would* support sanctions. But I only support *consistent* sanctions. I would only start supporting sanctions against Russia as long as significantly worse sanctions have been imposed on the US. I don't want sanctions imposed on Russia as long as the US isn't treated equally.

If you think Russia deserves sanctions for those past actions, then be intellectually consistent and admit that the US deserves sanctions for its past and present actions. :)",0,1406643848,null,0,false,0,cjazxlj,t3_2c13ms,t1_cjazxlj,t1_cjazqg7,null,1434956313,-6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-6

Questo, unicamente, è materia su cui si può, in parte dibattere: ovvero se c'è stata una correlazione causa/effetto tra dichiarazioni mendaci e morte. Per loro sì.

&gt;Allora non hai capito niente, niente, niente del discorso costi/benefici sul panico che abbiamo fatto ieri. Ma niente niente. 

Senti, io non ci lavoro più col rischio da cinque anni, ma non è che stai tirando fuori chissà quali novità. Proverò a ragionare come sembra sia l'unico modo che vuoi utilizzare.

Hai presente l'albero degli eventi nell'analisi del rischio? Semplifichiamo enormemente e diciamo che abbiamo un solo punto di partenza (qualche scossetta e popolazione agitata) e vediamo quante scelte ci sono per minimizzare il rischio: si tira fuori che qualsiasi sia la nostra reazione, a meno dell'evacuazione compelta, il rischio di morte/danni resta uguale qualsiasi sia la nostra scelta. 

*Lievemente* maggiore è il rischio se chiudiamo tutti in casa, *lievemente* minore se lasciamo fare come vogliono. Questo perchè se R (rischio) è uguale a fxD (frequenza e morti/evento), f non viene modificato da nessuna delle nostre azioni, D solo se la gente non si trova in casa, ma f resta molto basso.
 
Per modificare R, s'ha da modificare D, e ci sono azioni realizzabili (informare la popolazione di ciò che capita), azioni irrealizzabili (evacuare, imporre per legge marziale che tutti dormano in casa) e azioni da non realizzare per altre costrizioni, per esempio legali (dire balle, tranquillizzare ""eccessivamente"" la popolazione). 

In pratica, quello che dicono i giudici è che l'azione ha aumentato D (ed R) senza una motivazione valida (quello che a te pare fondamentale, ""tranquillizzare"", non pare essere una giustificazione), oltre che agire non in buonafede. Aumentando il rischio, hanno causato la morte di alcune persone. 

Quello su cui potresti argomentare è: siamo *davvero* sicuri che la gente che ha dormito in casa non avrebbe dormito comunque in casa nonostante l'INGV? Secondo il loro studio, probabilmente fatto con un albero degli eventi più complesso di quello che abbiamo immaginato adesso, 30 persone si sarebbero salvate. Poi boh, possiamo andare a vedere se lo studio è malfatto.

And the lyrics have nothing anthem-like, such as about the strength of the people, or the beauty of the country, or pride, or anything like that. I would sum it up as meek.

I'm one of those crazy folks that think Saule, Pērkons, Daugava should be the anthem. Other than being somewhat of a difficult melody, I think it's perfect. It's emotional, it's a powerful melody, it has lyrics that refer to the country's entire history and the oldest beliefs of the people. I think it would easily be one of the world's best anthems.

Yes it had, but its member states are the vassals of the US.

&gt; Russia had no hand in escalating it

Russia didn't overthrow a democratically elected president with the help of neo-nazis.

&gt; And American aggression against Russia is shown by allowing former Soviet satellite states to voluntarily join NATO? 

The people who use this argument ALWAYS fail to mention how this is seen by Russia.

All the information is there if you compare and contrast the Eurobarameter, conducted by eurostat themselve and the /r/europe survey.

Look at the question on page 5 ""the image of the European Union""

http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb80/eb80_first_en.pdf

The responses were: negative (28%), positive (31%)  and neutral (39%).

Now, if you look at the /r/europe survey, first question under the 'politics' topic titled ""my feelings towards the European Union are...""

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WDXB3lWQTFcBsowwmse5VnnkZQWtcsx3Vy0a068ZXo8/viewanalytics#start=publishanalytics

You can see that 66% of respondents had either positive or very positive feelings towards the European union (compared to the European average of 31%), 16% said they were neutral (compared with 39%), and only 18% said they had a negative or very negative view of the European Union (compared with 28%). 

The conclusion I would draw from this, is that the effects becoming a geodefault will pull us closer towards the centre, and that centre is generally less positive across the board, and so we'll naturally become more eurosceptic.

My guess is people just don't ""feel like a EU citizen"" - we have the lowest salaries in EU, times below the average for the Union. People are just disillusioned - they thought (naively) that joining EU is gonna change their lives with a magic wand, and reality is while we're better off and there are more opportunities than before - we still live in a swamp of corruption, idiotic governments that do little to nothing to bring us closer to EU values and living standard.

EU initiatives are largely invisible here, only used sporadically for the corrupt status quo political parties to get some political gain and then slowly forgotten and sunk in the above swamp. 

EU funds assimilation (I'm not sure that's the right word) is partial, slow and hindered by bureaucracy, incompetence and said corruption.

Most people here are pessimists in life in general, they don't see much good coming from the EU - they just fail to reach them or claim and advertise the good they do with their funds and initiatives, so people just think they don't help at all. And what's more - recent (idiotic) nationalist anti-EU parties' sentiments use this and spread their propaganda to make people think EU is all the time hindering us and some evil foreign force that's stopping us from becoming a super-power or something... sarcasm's lost on them.

(I personally think that EU is one of the few straws that keep holding us to sanity, though they're not doing a proactive enough job, and we on our own part sure don't do enough too, at least not a lot of the people)

true,MarrymeCaptHowdy,null,null,"&gt; Klingt wie ein frühkindlicher ""Plan von der Abschaffung des Dunkels"".

Die Kritik der ""Gleichschaltung"" und ""Dressur"" von Kindern in staatlichen Einrichtungen wurde hier ja schon mal erhoben. Ich kann dem aus meiner eigenen Erfahrung nicht folgen. Ich habe keine eigenen Kinder, aber die Kinder meiner Freunde kommen gerade ins Kindergarten- oder Schulalter. In den großstädtischen Kindergärten findet sich oft eine bunte Mischung von Kindern und Eltern aus allen Bevölkerungsschichten und auch ein hoher Migrantenanteil. Und was wird doch gemacht - es wird gespielt, gesungen, Ausflüge gemacht, mit Musikinstrumenten experimentiert, die Kinder freunden sich miteinander an - es fällt mir schwer, in dem, was ich da sehe, irgendeinen dunklen Plan zur Auslöschung von Individualität zu sehen. Und auch keine ""höher, schneller, weiter""-Dressur für Vorschulkinder.

Im Gegenteil, ich denke, auch bemühte Eltern können ihrem Kind nur schwer die Abwechslung und Möglichkeiten, sich selbst auszuprobieren, bieten, die ein stinknormaler Tag im Kindergarten bietet. Einfach, weil selten zuhause ein Dutzend anderer Kinder herumlaufen und (unter Aufsicht) für Experimente jeglicher sozialer Interaktion zur Verfügung stehen. Nicht zu sprechen von Angeboten wie Ausflüge etc., die für viele Eltern privat einfach nicht zu machen sind.

Natürlich ist das nicht die Lösung und holen wir nur mehr Kinder in die Kindergärten, löst sich alles in Wohlgefallen auf. Es darf da nicht aufhören - aber warum darf es da nicht anfangen? Der Kindergarten kann auch ein Kontaktpunkt für Eltern sein, aus ihrem üblichen Umfeld herauszutreten und Kontakte zu knüpfen. Selten hab ich ein so gelungenes ""Multikulti"" gesehen, wie auf dem Sommerfest des Kindergartens einer befreundeten Mutter. Da stand nicht nur friedlich Bratwurst neben Börek auf dem Tisch, davor standen die Eltern und haben sich über die Kinder, den Kindergarten und alles drumherum unterhalten, das schafft Gemeinsamkeiten und Anknüpfpunkte, die auch die leider ja auch oft bei den Eltern vorhandene Sprachbarriere zumindest punktuell überwinden können.",0,1406648850,null,0,false,0,cjb2e3w,t3_2bup2c,t1_cjb2e3w,t1_cjabhjc,null,1434957475,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

I'm on my phone, but basically if you earn less than 100000 euros per year you be state insured as an exception.
If you have more questions, go to your local Seguridad Social office. Search on google for which one you have to go to, because each district has its own.

Also, try to make an appointment online if you don't want to queue for hours.

Tatsache ist doch auch, dass die Durchgeknallten Gewalttäter, egal von welcher Religion, eine verschwindend geringe Minderheit (weit unter 1%) darstellen. Dabei ist es völlig wurscht, und für die Religion als Ganzes egal, ob das jetzt ein paar mehr oder weniger sind.

Und nur, weil ich mich auf Deinen Namen berufe, wenn ich jemanden abknalle bist Du dann daran schuld oder was? Ich bin deshalb schuld an dem, was die Lord's Resistance Army in Afrika anstellt, oder was? Weil ich Christ bin? Ich bin an den NSU-Morden schuld, weil ich Deutscher bin? Was ist denn das für eine völlig verkorkste Argumentationsweise. Dein Rassismus kannst Du verteidigen so lange Du willst. Gute Argumente wirst du wenig finden, die nicht leicht vollständig und schnell zu entkräften sind.

&gt; Der Islam hatte seine Aufklärung weit vor dem Christentum. Aber er ist auch z.Zt. die Religion mit den deutlichsten Problemen was z.B. die Gleichstellung von Frauen und die Behandlung von Apostaten angeht.

Noch keine fundamentalistische Christen getroffen oder was? Ja, die gibt es auch in Deutschland. Schon mal mit Katholiken über Frauen in Priesterämtern diskutiert? Oder über Homosexuelle im Kirchendienst? Da gab es mal einen. Der wurde nach seinem Coming Out achtkantig rausgeworfen.

&gt; aber hier ruft keiner nach der Steinigung von ""fremdgehenden"" Frauen (die vergewaltigt wurden). Die Protestanten und Katholiken haben nicht mehr den Hass und die Menschenverachtung gegeneinander wie einst....

Schon mal darüber nachgedacht, dass es vielleicht nicht an der Religion liegt? Dass die Christen im selben Land wie die konservativen Islam-Anhänger sehr ähnlich denken? Dass es vielleicht eher daran liegt wo man aufwächst und wohnt, als daran, welchen Namen die Religion trägt, der man seit der Geburt angehört? Schon mal probiert mit irgend jemandem (Christ, Muslim, usw.) auf der Straße über Theologie zu reden? Die meisten Muslime wissen weniger über ihre Religion (gerade in den muslimischen Ländern) als die Christen hier. Hier wirft man vielleicht mal wenigstens ab und zu einen vorsichtigen Blick in die Bibel. Ich möchte wetten, dass die meisten Muslime das hocharabisch im Koran gar nicht wirklich kapieren. Vielleicht die, die studiert haben. Wie ist die hochschulquote in Ägypten? 5%? 3%? Und welcher Student der Biologie interessiert sich für Theologie und liest wirklich mal nach? Alles was die Menschen machen, hier wie dort, ist die lokalen Rituale befolgen. Und so, wie der Weihnachtsmann in keiner Bibel auftaucht, werden die muslimischen Rituale meist auch nichts mit der ""echten"" Religion zu tun haben. Weshalb ich die Versuche von Islamphobikern immer so bescheuert finde den Muslimen anhand ihrer Religion zu erklären, warum sie so schlecht sind. So wie man irgend welchen ""Christen"" (die, die Weihnachten und Ostern feiern und noch nie eine Bibel in der Hand hatten) anhand von obskuren Bibelzitaten erklärt, dass sie alle Terroristen sein müssen, weil sie ja gegen ungläubige Krieg führen. 

&gt; Aber nun geh' mal in den Iran / Irak / nach Syrien etc. und frag mal Sunnis / Schiiten / Wahabiten was die voneinander halten - und was man mit Apostaten machen sollte.

Das ist purer, echter Rassismus. Geh mal nach X und frag die mal nach Y. Geh mal nach Rumänien und guck Dir die Zigeuner an, wie sie da hausen. Echt mal. Auch dafür nicht zu schade?

If you happen to just to what you have to do, maybe.

In this light, it does happen in undergraduate education as well. In any case, this whole discussion is about master studies where it will happen on a regular basis.

That may be true. But it's also true that any French scientist who doesn't *also* publish in English isn't internationally recognised.

I *love* it. The song is about how beautiful and grand our nature is, and it's also a nostalgic piece about legacy and times past when Sweden was truly influential (the Swedish Empire I would guess). These days no one really cares about us or what we say, which I suppose is the natural order of things. It's almost exclusively sung at sporting events.

Also of note is that the second verse speaks warmly about wanting to live and die in ""Norden"" (Scandinavia at large). I think it's great having a national anthem that isn't particularly patriotic, which is why I was disappointed to hear that they changed the lyrics in this [Volvo commercial by Zlatan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbvdzQ7uVPc).

true,waveswan,SWED,Sweden,"The problem with dropping wages is that it causes people to live on very low margins, and if a shock to the economy then hits ( russian gas price hike, housing market bubble, corruption scandal, uncertainty regarding trade agreements) the consequence could easily be that people start to default on their debts, business goes slow because people will not buy their goods when they are afraid, governments try to respond by increasing the money supply, thus causing inflation which further squeezes the poor, and then we're back in 2008 again.

Stimulating business to recover from a recession can work, but it is very risky business to do so at the expense of low income earners and middle class families. People are already having issues paying their rent, debts and bills despite very low levels of inflation. What do you think will happen if it starts to rise? Job-creation through tax cuts and expansion of the money supply cannot fix the issue if the workers are denied increases in pay because of limited bargaining power. The consequence in such a situation will be reduced faith in the financial market, slowdown in economic activity due to demand destruction caused by low wages, and if you keep on staying close to this territory then it is only a matter of time before some external shock to the market comes and causes the entire house of cards to crash and burn. 

Markets depend on both supply and demand, but it is only centrist politicians that are willing to deal with both. The left will ask for tax and spend in any possible situation, justifying it by appealing to fairness and equality, while the right will consider job creation through tax cuts and austerity the solution no matter the actual causes of recession. 

The recession we recently experienced was caused by demand destruction as people defaulted on their debts, oil prices spiked driving up the cost of living, and the far too ""libertarian"" policies of western countries failed to take measures to help struggling citizens until the disaster was obvious. The Americans did the right thing in electing Obama. In Europe we tried to fix the Greek economy with austerity, and the outcome was disaster. 

This is not to say that left-wing policies are always the correct way to go. Some times it is indeed the supply side that has problems, and in those cases measures aimed at boosting business activity is the right way to go, but that was not the case this time, and Britain is playing a very dangerous game. All it takes is some trouble in the housing market or a spike in fossil fuel prices. ",0,1406650021,null,0,false,0,cjb30f6,t3_2bz04d,t1_cjb30f6,t1_cjb1dvb,null,1434957764,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,VincentClebard,ZZZZZZchiot,Chiot,"Ce sont uniquement des preuves sorties d'un documentaire à charge. On va les reprendre les unes après les autres...

Premier exemple : l'article affirme lui-même qu'il est erroné. On passe.

Second exemple (voiture) : il s'agit du phénomène de *mode*, pas d'obsolescence programmée. Qu'on élargisse la définition pour l'inclure est juste de la malhonnêteté intellectuelle.

Les bas nylon : exemple très intéressant, car il correspond clairement à un cas identifié. Mon intuition, c'est qu'il s'agit principalement d'une baisse des coûts de production. En attendant, depuis 1940 et l'introduction du bas nylon par DuPont, il y a du chemin parcouru et la concurrence s'est intensifiée.

Apple, je valide ; c'est un cas connu.

Sur les ordinateurs, j'ai pouffé. Considérer que la montée en gamme des processeurs constitue un cas d’obsolescence programmée, c'est comme si l'on considéraient que le remplacement des vieilles normes du web par les nouvelles, et l'accroissement des capacités de communication (débit, étendue des réseaux, etc) étaient de l'obsolescence programmée. Cela n'en est pas plus que le remplacement des fabricants de bougie par les ampoules électriques.

Idem sur les téléphones mobiles (Apple mise à fond sa stratégie sur l'achat d'adaptateurs et de connecteurs dédiés à certains produits !).

Les seuls arguments pro-obsolescence programmée comme pratique courante me semblent être directement associés à des cas très particuliers de monopoles/quasi-monopoles. Et ce sont également des cas se répercutant directement dans la société civile par... une réaction en termes de procès, mauvaise comm', etc. Parce que ce genre de pratiques est absurde dans un marché concurrentiel (où si vous proposez le même produit que votre concurrent, mais défectueux, vous lui tendez la joue) ou non-oligopolistique/monopolistique.

D'ailleurs, as-tu lu l'article que tu cites ? Regarde la partie ""étude scientifique"". Si si, la partie qui traite d'individus qui ne sont pas directement à charge/décharge de ce genre de théories.

&gt; Dans un article de Pour la Science, un membre de l'ADEME précise que : « Ces exemples (ampoules, bas nylons) sont toutefois anciens et l'obsolescence programmée ne semble pas être la règle aujourd'hui. De nombreux témoignages d'utilisateurs font peser de sérieux soupçons sur quelques produits, telles des imprimantes qui tombent systématiquement en panne après un certain nombre d'impressions, mais ces cas restent rares et aucune stratégie des industriels pour limiter la durée de vie des produits n'a pu être prouvée. ».

&gt; Il existe très peu de publications scientifiques dans des revues à comité de lecture traitant de cas réels. L'une des plus référencées concerne les rééditions des manuels de cours, que l'on peut légitimement suspecter d'être planifiée afin de rendre obsolètes les éditions en vente sur le marché de l'occasion. Pourtant même dans ce cas l'auteur conclut que la fréquence des rééditions ne peut s'expliquer par l'obsolescence programmée seule, mais que la réédition de manuels concurrents ou la durée depuis la dernière réédition jouent également un rôle.

Globalement, je n'ai rien contre la critique de la société de surconsommation (ce qui est plus souvent le cas : modes, innovations mineures forçant au rachat, comportements surconsommateurs, objets chargés symboliquement, etc), mais les théories autour de l'obsolescence programmée sont généralement pourris par quelques moutons noirs (ce qui ne signifient pas que tous les moutons sont noirs, encore une fois) et une grosse dose de simplification de la réalité. C'est plus simple de se dire ""oulala, les industriels font de l'obsolescence programmée !"" que de se pencher sur les mécanismes de marché, l'offre et la demande, les stratégies industrielles, l'innovation technologique, les comportements des consommateurs, les tendances sociologiques à l’œuvre, les dynamiques techniques et technologiques propres à certains secteurs, les rapports concurrentiels entre entreprises, etc.",0,1406650455,null,0,false,0,cjb38wr,t3_2bvz42,t1_cjb38wr,t1_cjay1p7,null,1434957874,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

Siehe weiter oben: ""wenn Christen Kindern Bluttransfusionen verweigern oder den Schulbesuch untersagen wollen..."" - ich schließe die Christen hier nicht aus, aber das liest du nicht... vermutlich damit du mich als Rassisten beschimpfen kannst.

&gt;Die meisten Muslime wissen weniger über ihre Religion (gerade in den muslimischen Ländern) als die Christen hier. 

Halte ich für gewagt - Koranschule ist meist pflicht. Bibelschule hingegen nicht. Ob und wer dadurch was dann auch versteht ist streitbar... 


Man muss kein Theologe sein, oder auch nur Theologie verstehen, um Religiöse Ideologie, wie man sie vermittelt bekommen hat als Motivation und Rechtfertigung für Verhalten heranzuziehen. Das ist ja schließlich ihr Zweck. Die religiösen ""heiligen Schriften"" der abrahamischen Religionen haben es nun mal so an sich, dass die nicht nur Friede und Liebhaben predigen, sondern auch tatsächlich Rechtfertigung für alle möglichen Greuel liefern... aber nein, dass zu sagen ist jetzt bestimmt auch Rassismus... keine Ahnung gegen wen, aber muss ja...

&gt;Und so, wie der Weihnachtsmann in keiner Bibel auftaucht, werden die muslimischen Rituale meist auch nichts mit der ""echten"" Religion zu tun haben. 

Schon mal was von der ""No True Scotsman""-Fallacy gehört? Klar - nur die ""lieben"" interpretationen sind ""echt""... dabei sind die auch im Christentum eine sehr neuzeitliche Erfindung. Noch Luther war für die Vertreibung und Enteignung der Juden, und wir wissen ja was der deutsche Klerus und deren religiöse Auffassung mit dem 30-jährigen Krieg zu tun hatte.

Nein, so geht es nicht - das Ketzer-jagende, Hexen-verbrennende, Häretiker-folternde Christentum ist nicht weniger durch die Bibel legitimiert als das moderne ""wir haben uns doch alle lieb""-Christentum.
Genauso mit dem Judentum und dem Islam. Die entsprechenden Stellen in Bibel, Torah, Koran und den Hadiths kann jeder nachschlagen.

Natürlich ist auch gesellschaftlich bedingt, welche interpretation einem denn nun vorgesetzt wird - aber es bleibt dabei, dass die religiösen Ideologien so wie sie vermittelt und geglaubt werden alle möglichen Gräuel rechtfertigen und auch motivieren. 

Zu versuchen, Ideologien vollständig schuldlos zu halten - und Kritiker als Rassisten zu beschimpfen ist das niederste was mir je diesbezüglich untergekommen ist. Schäm dich!",0,1406652227,null,0,1406659315,0,cjb47ev,t3_2bxexo,t1_cjb47ev,t1_cjb2p8d,null,1434958395,2,false,de,t5_22i0,2

&gt; At the end of its hyperinflation, Germany locked itself into a currency regime, the international gold standard, which was deliberately designed to be so limiting that exit was impossible. The anticipated consequence was that the country would appear credible and become attractive to foreign capital.

&gt; As the strategy worked, capital inflows sparked both public-sector and private-sector booms. Governments at all levels funded politically attractive but expensive infrastructure projects. 

&gt; But there was a downside. The boom’s vigor, coupled with prior experience of inflation, led to wage increases that were not matched by productivity gains. As a result, Weimar Germany lost competitiveness in the late 1920’s, in the same way that Southern Europe did in the 2000’s. In both cases, it was clear that the capital inflows could not continue forever, and weakening competiveness meant brought the end forward.

&gt; When the reversal came, Germany was trapped. As foreigners and Germans alike withdrew deposits, banks were driven into insolvency and forced to liquidate their assets at very fire-sale prices. The government had to prop up failed banks; but it could fund deficits only by borrowing from the banks. Given its commitment to the fixed exchange rate of the gold standard, that meant that it had to impose ever more unpopular austerity measures.",0,1406653879,null,0,false,0,cjb53il,t3_2c1ccd,t1_cjb53il,t1_cjb4s4t,null,1434958817,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Er fragte die Cops natürlich, ob er es nicht auf eine Fensterbank legen oder es einem der Beamten in die Hand geben dürfte. Die Antwort war darauf ein strenges Nein und wie es eben so ist standen die Herren Polizisten dann einige Momente später zu siebt auf ihm drauf. D.h.: auf seinen Knöcheln, Handgelenken und vor allem seinem Nacken/Gesicht. Rieben seine Fresse dann noch ein wenig auf dem Asphalt, was man am nächsten Tag auch unschwer erkennen konnte.

Die Schuldfrage sei bei sowas mal dahingestellt aber was viel wichtiger ist der Besuch beim Arzt am nächsten Tag, bei dem ich draußen wartete:

Irgendwann kam mein von Blessuren gezeichneter Kumpel raus und meinte, dass sogar der Arzt ihm davon abgeraten hatte, eine Anzeige zu erstatten, weil er ähnliche Fälle so gut wie JEDES Wochenende behandele. Fälle, die dann wie durch Wunder im Sand verlaufen oder sogar für legitime Opfer im genauen Gegenteil enden.

Im Polizeibericht stand dann etwas davon, dass mein Kumpel mittels ""einfacher körperlicher Gewalt"" von seinem Handy getrennt wurde (einer der Beamten nahm es an sich, lol).

We have a war in Germany???

Oh and I just watched 60% of the video before I stopped, because it's at most (very) mildly funny. Not a SINGLE mention of the war thus far (one very short reference to British stereotypes of Germans goose stepping). So I guess it's all in the last 40% - those of you only interested in that part can skip the first half (you won't miss much).

What Germans and British have in common (I lived in the US not the UK so correct me if I'm wrong): A love of (the kind of humor produced by) Monty Python or Rowan Atkinson but I could name plenty more.

What separates them: We Germans will never, ever in this millennium (nor did we in the previous one) be able to produce such humor, we have to import it from the UK.

I'm fine with that, the best kind of German humor that I know is very educational. Political cabaret that isn't just stupid jokes but *teaches* something, a(n important) side to stories that most people overlook.

I had no idea about Kinshasa overtaking Paris. It actually never occurred to me that Paris was the largest French speaking city. I mean if someone asked me the question, I would have guessed Paris, but otherwise I had never thought about it. I don't think being the largest French speaking city is very significant though. 

Otherwise, with these developing countries seeing such a demographic boom, it's understandable that the number of speakers is growing, but I'm not sure the percentage of French speakers is growing, considering other languages are also growing. Regardless, I don't think this will change much. Also, English is displacing other languages as a second language and a lingua franca, but I don't see that as bad considering other languages (at least the large national languages) are in no danger of dying off (except those directly affected by English, like Irish Gaelic and stuff). It's true though that cultural influence through language is important and good for a country's economy, so it's too bad for France and others, but there's not much that can be done about it.

true,BlueHatScience,null,null,"Der Islam ist (im Vergleich zu Christentum und Judentum) recht jung, hatte aber sein goldenes, aufklärerisches Zeitalter weit früher als das Christentum (nämlich ca. vom 7.-13. Jh). Zu der Zeit, und leider auch lange danach, war es das Christentum in dem am meisten Intoleranz, Verfolgung und Gewalt gepredigt wurde.

Da das Judentum im Gegensatz zu den anderen beiden abrahamischen Religionen nicht missionarisch ist, und sich dessen Anhänger lange Zeit nicht regional abgegrenzt haben gab es hier weniger Glaubenskriege und Verfolgung. Aber es gibt sie - bei den Ultraorthodoxen, die Leute vertreiben, mit Steinen bewerfen und den Umgang mit allem und allen die ""goy"" / ""nokhri"" sind verbieten. Diese haben im modernen Israel lange Zeit viele Privillegien gehabt (Lebensunterhalt komplett vom Staat bezahlt damit sie Religion studieren konnten, keine Wehrpflicht etc.) - sie haben immernoch viele, aber die meisten Israelis haben das langsam satt, und die Privillegien werden abgebaut. 

Ich halte alle dogmatischen Ideologien für gefährlich, politisch wie religiös - aber es gibt eben Unterschiede in dem Ausmaß, in dem Intoleranz, Verfolgung und Gewalt in der Ideologie gepredigt, motiviert und gerechtfertigt wird. Lange Zeit war das Christentum hier globaler Vorreiter, und wie erwähnt gibt es hier immernoch genug Probleme.

Aber - aktuell gibt es die meisten Gewalt und Intoleranz predigenden, motivierenden und rechtfertigenden ideologischen Strömungen mit den meisten Anhängern relativ zur Gesamtzahl der Gläubigen eben im Islam. Das ist kein ""Nummernspiel"", das ist leider Fakt. 

Das ist auch keine generelle ""Islamophobie"" - ein Sufist wird z.B. nur mit sehr sehr geringer Wahrscheinlichkeit das Ermorden von Apostaten gutheißen. Dürfte bei den meisten Sunniten innerhalb von Deutschland ähnlich sein. Aber eben - wie die Umfragen zeigen, nicht generell. Erschreckend große Minderheiten in einigen nicht-mehrheitlich muslimischen Ländern (zwischen 25 und 40%) und leider auch tatsächliche Mehrheiten in mehrheitlich islamischen Ländern befürworten die Todesstrafe für Apostaten! Mehrheiten dort, und große minderheiten anderswo befürworten Scharia-Gerichte (eine Beispielhafte Quelle: [Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/29/thinktanks.religion)). Von der Rolle und den Freiheiten von Frauen wollen wir lieber nicht sprechen. Unter den deutschen Muslimen die schon länger hier leben wird es nur eine extrem kleine Minderheit sein, die explizit Gewalt gegen Andersgläubige befürwortet. Unter den neu Zugewanderten (siehe Zeit-Artikel) und im Rest der Welt sieht es oft anders aus.

Das sind keine rechtsextremen Schundblätter die ich hier als Quellen aufführe - es sind die Zeit, Pew Research, Washington Post und Guardian.

Natürlich sind die meisten Muslime gegen Selbstmordattentate... aber bei theokratie, der Behandlung von Apostaten und Geschlechter-Gleichberechtigung z.B. sieht es eben - faktisch - unter den Strömungen des Islam derzeit schlimmer aus als unter den Strömungen von Christentum und Judentum. Das war mal genau anders herum... wird es vielleicht auch wieder. Aber aktuell ist das nun einmal so.

Ja, ich fälle sehr harte Urteile gegen z.B. den Wahabitismus... das sollte jeder, der etwas von Freiheit und Gleichberechtigung hält. Ich fälle ähnlich harte Urteile z.B. gegen den Pentecostalismus und das Ultraorthodoxe Judentum. Christentum und Judentum haben Probleme mit derartigem Gedankengut... nur eben aktuell nicht so stark wie der Islam.

Jeder Muslim dem egal ist, ob ein anderer vom Islam abfällt, dem egal ist, ob ein anderer einer anderen Strömung des Islam oder einer anderen Religion angehört, der nicht erwartet und verlangt, dass der Mann über die Frau das Sagen hat, der hat das Potential mein engster Allierter zu werden. Und solche gibt im Islam - weshalb ""Islamophobie"" und ""Rassismus"" wohl absolut falsch sind um meine Position zu bezeichnen.

Aber gerade bei Geschlechtergleichstellung im Alltag und bei Apostasie sind es eben keine kleinen Minderheiten, die hier problematisch sind - leider.

Ich sehe die Gefahr in Ideologien, in denen Intoleranz, Unterdrückung und Gewalt gerechtfertigt wird - das ist nicht(!) die Gesamtheit des Islam - aber eben leider auch nicht eine kleine Minderheit. Es muss ja nicht gleich die Befürwortung von Selbstmordattentätern sein. Es fängt bei der Rolle der Frau im Alltag und der Behandlung von Konvertiten an. Und im Islam gibt es hier ein größeres Problem als in den meisten anderen Religionen.

Wie gesagt - gesellschaftliche Gründe hinter den Ideologien gibt es immer. Aber das Obige in Angesicht der Tatsachen (für die ich auch Belege angeführt habe) zu Leugnen und als ""Islamophobie"" und ""Rassismus"" abzutun ist Augenwischerei.

Mein Problem ist nicht mit dem Islam weil er Islam ist - mein Problem ist mit jeder freiheits-, friedens- und gleicheitsfeindlichen Ideologie. ""Der Islam"" kann vieles sein, vom sufistischen Sunnitentum bis zum Wahabitismus, und ist deshalb nicht als ganzes zu behandeln - was ich auch nicht tue. Ich sage lediglich: Im Islam gibt es hier aktuell größere Probleme mit freiheits- &amp;  gleichheitsfeindlichem Gedankengut als in den meisten anderen Religionen (die dennoch, nur eben weniger, solche Probleme haben). 

Ich habe meine Position nun im Detail dargelegt - die Urteile darüber, wo das Problem derzeit größer ist mit Zahlen untermauert, und nochmals bekräftigt dass jeder, der eine - nenn wir sie ""humanistische"" (egalitäre, libertäre) Grundeinstellung hat mir ein Freund ist, unabhängig von der Religion.

During conversations with people on the street I always have to be careful to answer the question ""And what did you do before that?"" because the same person that just chatted nicely with you may just spit in your face (or in a more polite case end the conversation awkwardly quick) if you mention being a former soldier. While everybody is bloody quick to tell you, that what you did was wrong, nobody wants to hear your stories about the children you saw- maimed by mines and UXOs (the very same mines and UXOs that we were out there to destroy), of the women and men terrorised by fear when going outside and how you find them a week later having been killed by insurgents because they were not following ""the right way"".

We sought to establish closer ties with Ukraine and shut out the Russians from what was originally their sphere of influence. This prompted the Russians to pressure the president of Ukraine at the time, Yanukovych, into signing a treaty with Russia instead. This instigated the riots in Kiev which spiraled out of control, eventually resulting in the Russian occupation of Crimea and the current situation of civil war in Ukraine.

With this knowledge in mind, how is Ukraine's current predicament anyone's responsibility but the EU's and Russia's?

However, the road to where Ukraine wants to get is shitty to say the least and your political class has to change the most. Number one priority is removal of corruption, since EU doesnt give away money without tracebility and justification (unlike Russia). The moment your political class and business interests start to interfere with the targeted spending of EU cash, the flow stops.

Also, investment from EU is not free money. Some of your local companies will be bought by European transnational equivalents (like railways) and many will scream that Ukraine is selling out.
