true,[deleted],null,null,"Russia hasn't been at war with anybody. And the Crimea is different, it has been part of Imperial Russia and Soviet Union for centuries, that's why the people there are over 60% Russians. And that's why over 2/3 of the Ukrainian soldiers (in Crimea) has defected to the pro-Russian side. Also Russia has a legal right to keep over 20,000 troops in Crimea, Sevastopol. It is their home for Black Sea Fleet and other troops. 

&gt;The city continues to be the home of the Russian—formerly Soviet—Black Sea Fleet, and is now home to a Ukrainian naval base and has Russian naval facilities leased from Ukraine through 2042. The headquarters of both the Ukrainian Naval Forces and Russia's Black Sea Fleet are located in the city.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevastopol

Why Crimea is part of Ukraine then? In 1954 leader of the USSR Nikita Khurtshov gave it to Ukraine SSR and when USSR failed, Russia didn't have the power (political, economical etc.) to have it. So the new-born Ukraine got Crimea, a ticking time-bomb in their east region.

D'une façon générale, il faut éviter de crier au loup en matière d'insultes sexistes en politique. Ça risque de sérieusement desservir les femmes. Les insultes fusent en politique. C'est triste mais c'est comme ça. Les femmes qui vont en politique s'en prennent dans la figure, des insultes plus ou moins subtiles, souvent des insultes traduites imparfaitement au féminin. C'est le jeu et je trouve assez maladroit de crier au sexisme quand justement se retrouver cible de quolibet montre au contraire une intégration à ce joyeux bordel.

Le ""Barbie fait de la politique"", par exemple, pour une femme blonde qui se nomme Barbara, ça peut tout à fait sortir le jour où elle dit une connerie. Il y avait dans mon école un type dont le nom de famille est Parseval, tu sais qu'il doit se manger des références à Kaamelot dés qu'il dit une connerie. Si c'est une femme qui les sort, c'est du sexisme ? Quelle différence ?

L'égalité en politique, c'est d'avoir le droit de dire à une femme qu'elle a dit une connerie, qu'elle est trop cassante, qu'elle emmerde tout le monde. C'est également qu'elle réponde à tout ça sur le même ton. Tu t'es fait traitée de Barbie ? Traite ton vis à vis de couille-molle. L'avantage des insultes sexistes, c'est qu'il y en a des deux cotés.

Le sexisme en politique, c'est de siffler une ministre lorsqu'elle entre en jupe dans l'hémicycle (quelle honte pour la France a été ce jour là). C'est de promouvoir une jolie fille pour qu'elle fasse potiche. C'est de harceler sexuellement. C'est de préjuger des compétences à cause du sexe.

It never happened. Rada voted and send him the law, but he didn't sign it neither on Feb 21 nor on Feb 22.

At this point the deal was null and void, and Verkhovnaya Rada had to take further measures, because de facto there was no president in Ukraine anymore.

true,New-Atlantis,EURO,European Union,"&gt; I've never advocated an all-out trade war,

It doesn't matter what you or I advocate, what matters is that UK/US trade relations have always gone that way ever since the days of captain Drake.

The very fact of the free trade talks (with Europe, the Pacific, etc.) proves my point. The US cannot compete on a level playing field, it needs to replace multilateral trade under the WTO by a series of bilateral trade agreements to isolate China. That is the whole point of the exercise, nothing else! In this game, Europe is to serve US foreign policy as pawn. That is not in the interest of Europe!

&gt;at a time when an energy boom due to shale gas 

In the global market, natural resources are typically exploited at the expense of domestic manufacturing. Both Germany and Japan have developed a competitive industry without natural resources. Norway, which is blessed with oil also has the lowest level of technological innovation of all Nordic countries. And the decline of UK manufacturing coincided with the North Sea oil boom. ...

There is a lot of hype about US fracking, but even if there were to be a boom, it will bring down prices globally, hence, also for Europe. Anyways, Europe has lived with higher oil prices than the US for decades already.

&gt;can they bridge the massive gap in innovation between them and advanced economies?

China has overtaken the US in the number of patented inventions a couple of years ago. They have achieved in the last 20 years what Europe has achieved in the last 200 years. Sharing the same culture with Japan and Korea, they will develop in the same way and become technology leaders.

&gt;It's manufactured in Asia but the development is done in the U.S. or Europe.

This is complete nonsense. You can't develop a product if you don't have the manufacturing. I have worked in industry in Europe and Asia for over 40 years (including development and intellectual property). 

&gt;If companies decide to promote their environmental/social responsibility, it will be to use it as a marketing argument 

That's a rather cynical view. I know plenty of cases where this isn't true. Anyways, you dodge my point that, in Europe, we have beneficial traditions that we should not sacrifice on the alter of globalization and profit.

US style monopoly capitalism is basically dysfunctional. It has hollowed out domestic manufacturing and resulted in a gigantic trade deficit (and sovereign debt). Even though this unbalance is due its own erroneous policies, the US can only correct it by constantly putting political pressure on other countries, which is ultimately backed by the global US military presence.

Nevertheless, in many situations, the use of military force is not possible. Hence, the battle will be decided on the economic field. That is where Europe needs to win. 

Cooperating with China is often a lot more beneficial than cooperating with the US. In a number of corporate takeovers, European companies have benefited from Chinese cash and a long-term commitment to jobs and products, while an American investor would have just gutted the company and sold the rest for scrap without regard for products and employees.

Moreover, the gap between the US and Europe regarding climate change, social standards, management/labor relations, corporate culture, confrontational versus diplomatic resolution of conflicts (""fuck the EU"", etc.), the international court of justice and human rights, NSA mass surveillance, GMOs, ... is getting constantly wider.

true,Sypilus,null,null,"&gt;The very fact of the free trade talks (with Europe, the Pacific, etc.) proves my point. The US cannot compete on a level playing field, it needs to replace multilateral trade under the WTO by a series of bilateral trade agreements to isolate China.

I don't see how free trade agreements mean that a country can't pull it's own weight. The US has had free trade agreements long before China was a threat, same as European countries.

&gt; Both Germany and Japan have developed a competitive industry without natural resources. 

The industrialization of Germany was built on coal and iron, and both Japan and germany are among [the top coal producers](http://www.worldcoal.org/resources/coal-statistics/coal-steel-statistics/).

&gt;There is a lot of hype about US fracking, but even if there were to be a boom, it will bring down prices globally, hence, also for Europe. Anyways, Europe has lived with higher oil prices than the US for decades already.

OK? He was talking about an economic boost the the US economy that the European economy wouldn't receive. The fact that gas prices everywhere will drop doesn't change the fact that more money is going to American businesses.

&gt;Sharing the same culture with Japan and Korea, they will develop in the same way and become technology leaders.

While there are similarities between Chinese (Han), Japanese, and Korean cultures, they are still wholly distinct, much like both Tibet and Vietnam have distinct cultures despite being either neighbors to or annexed by China. Culture aside, China will probably develop technologies used as widely as those developed in Japan/Korea, but it will still take some time.

&gt;You can't develop a product if you don't have the manufacturing.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. The iPhone is designed by Apple in the US, then manufactured elsewhere. The lack of manufacturing at Apple HQ doesn't seem to pose a problem. There's also the fact that the manufacture of electronics [isn't](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-20626376)[ restricted](http://news.lenovo.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=1691) [to East Asia](http://www.techhive.com/article/2048551/made-in-the-usa-moto-x-manufacturing-facility-opens-its-doors-on-google-street-view.html), if that's what you meant.

&gt; It has hollowed out domestic manufacturing and resulted in a gigantic trade deficit (and sovereign debt)

While I agree that the US should regulate companies better, I'd like to point out that [a lot of European countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt) have significant sovereign debt as well, so it isn't accurate to say that the less restricted corporations are the cause.

&gt;Cooperating with China is often a lot more beneficial than cooperating with the US. In a number of corporate takeovers, European companies have benefited from Chinese cash and a long-term commitment to jobs and products, while an American investor would have just gutted the company and sold the rest for scrap without regard for products and employees.

I'm not aware of the companies that were ""gutted,"" but I know of the ones that haven't (like skype). It seems like an exaggeration to say European/Chinese businesses never buy out and ""gut"" foreign businesses, while that's all American businesses do.

&gt;Moreover, the gap between the US and Europe regarding climate change, social standards, management/labor relations, corporate culture, confrontational versus diplomatic resolution of conflicts...

There are significant gaps between European countries as well on these matters.

&gt;""fuck the EU"", etc.

&gt;Unless the US changes, there is no way Europe can possibly enter into a trade pact.

The EU already has FTAs with Turkey and Egypt, even with their current problems.

 I think Europe is divided on what to do. As a German myself, I believe we like to avoid any kind of conflict. And while on the business side this might seems wise, international law is being violated. You cannot let business interests take your country hostage. 
In my opinion: Sanctions are justified and morally right. But should they be imposed?   … Näh… 

It’s not about right nor wrong, neither for economic considerations. It’s about political realities. The big nations do what they do because they can… I find it hard not to sound hypocritical by sanctioning Russia with regard of the US invasion of Iraq.

To me it’s a similar move from the same playbook. Both nations try to ‘protect’ some strategic interests. The Russians are just very bad at selling their propaganda. I think, they don’t have that rhetorical training you get by dealing with western media. 


Anyway, things are happening and they will have consequences. Unfortunately, the EU cannot rely on US leadership anymore. And it shouldn’t. US foreign policies have shown inconsistencies in upholding democratic principles and human rights when those collided with security issues. 
I want neither Russian nor US self-interest to disproportionately influence an EU’s assessment of what is right to do.

Sebastian Edathy war Bundestagsmitglied der SPD und dort in einigen Ausschüssen aktiv. Zuletzt unter anderem als Vorsitzender im Untersuchungsausschuss zur NSU-Affäre. Im Januar kam dann die Meldung, dass sein Name auf einer Kundenliste von Pädophilen auftauchte. Die Liste wurde schon 2011 ans BKA übergeben, die aber lange Zeit nichts machte. Ende 2013 fing das BKA dann mit Ermittlungen an und eröffnete Ende Januar 2014 ein Verfahren bei der Staatsanwaltschaft Hannover woraufhin Wohnung und Büro von Edathy durchsucht wurden.

Und hier brach dann der Zirkus aus - Fotos der Hausdurchsuchung wurden veröffentlicht; es gab unterschiedliche Angaben dazu, was gefunden wurde und inwiefern/ob es strafrechtlich relevant sei und ob das gesamte Verfahren überhaupt rechtens gewesen sei. Edathy hatte sich mittlerweile nach Kanada(?) abgesetzt und bekommt Morddrohungen, und fällt zunächst durch Facebook-Statusmeldungen auf, die Zweifel an seiner geistigen Gesundheit zulassen.

""Nebenschauplätze"": Wer wußte wann von dem Fall und sagte es wem weiter? Der damalige Innenminister Hans-Peter Friedrich gab die Info wohl schon frühzeitig an Sigmar Gabriel weiter (und das alte Waschweib erzählte es dann wiederum innerhalb der SPD weiter). Friedrich trat deshalb zurück und mittlerweile läuft ein Verfahren gegen ihn wegen Verletzung des Dienstgeheimnisses.

Außerdem fand man auf der Kundenliste einen BKA-Beamten, der daraufhin zwangsweise in den Ruhestand versetzt wurde.

-	The EU is dependent on Russian natural gas imports.

Actually this is wrong. The EU main imports by country of origin are from Qatar,  Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt and Trinidad and Tobago (in that order). Despite Russian gas imports increasing, the overall volume is too small to be listed separately and is therefore accounted in “Imports from other countries.” (Page 14)

Here you’ll find the EU’s Commission report on the gas market: http://ec.europa.eu/energy/observatory/gas/doc/20130814_q2_quarterly_report_on_european_gas_markets.pdf


-	EU sanctions might hurt the EU’s economy more than Russia’s:

According to information published by the EU Commission, that doesn’t seem accurate: http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/russia/
 
* The EU is the most important export market for Russia. On the other side, Russia’s market ranks third for the EU. 

 * Actually, Russia exports more to Europa than the other way round. This creates a currency surplus that helps stabilizing the ruble and creates wealth.

 * At the same time, it is estimated that up to 75% of Foreign Direct Investment stocks in Russia come from EU Member States.


After reviewing this information, I believe that if the EU is willing to pay the price, sanctions will have a harder impact on Russia’s economy than the other way round. Still, I am just guessing. What I know for sure though, is that the prospect of armed confrontation already had a negative impact on stock and currency markets worldwide.

Also, saying 'when this big company that you arent using messes up, you will know, whereas when this other big company that you are using does, you wont' doesnt make sense. Why do you assume server hosters are more evil than mailservices?

On top of that, its easy to have automized data collection and analysis when you actually engineered the system yourself, whereas it is way more difficult if every single system is different. 

I think its way more likely an employee of a mailcompany will just do a database query instead of an employee of my server hoster snooping through my system in particular until he finds the mailbox folder.

Finally, arguing that reducing the number of people you need to trust decreases security just doesnt make sense.

true,LostInACave,EURO,Liberal Europhile,"I've been in favour of a unified EU military for a few years now. The US is shifting it's military/foreign policy away from Europe and towards the Pacific, Ukraine may alter this slightly though. As a result Europe no longer has the same security guarantees it once had. 
Because of this I believe it's time to step up the EUs Common Foreign and Security Policy to begin greater military integration. That isn't to say that tomorrow we should have a continental army, but steps need to be taken across the EU to ensure that European army's are trained and use comparable equipment. There are already strives for the EU to start using cross-national missile systems for aircraft and air defence therefore any EU plane can land, rearm and refuel and be back in the fight. This needs to continue and increase.

The EU has a combined manpower which rivals China, however a significant amount are conscripts, this needs to end as Europe should begin full adoption of a modern professional military. In war you don't want professionals and conscripts together, it causes operational chaos. 
It would also serve to create a more flexible and sustainable military. The UK has over 400 Challenger 2 MBTs, most of which are a relic of a military possibility which is unlikely now. As such half of them could be relocated to Germany, France or Poland, in which they would better serve the terrain and remit that MBTs function as. The Challenger 2 MBT is only an example of equipment which would be better served else where in Europe. If a unified EU military were to exist they could ensure that the right equipment is where it needs to be and you can significantly cut down on duplication. 
To add the Eurofighter Typhoon, the A400M, the Eurocopter Tiger and the NH90 are all examples of EU/European military R&amp;D developing advanced and effective cross-national equipment which are suitable for the European and international theatre of conflict. Specifically the A400M and NH90 are very versatile and useful as they can be used in a large variety of missions across the globe. 

Finally as new flash points arise; SE Asia, Indo-Pakistani border, Black Sea, Iran etc.. The EU needs the capabilities to secure it's interests and project power. We're entering a multipolar world where the hegemony of the US is no longer absolute. The rise of China, India, Brazil, and the resurgence of Russia and Japan mean that if the EU wants to maintain economic dominance it needs to effectively increase military spending and cooperation with the long term objective to create a unified EU military; as such the EU Rapid Response Forces and Battlegroups are a good start but it's only a start.

&gt;Trenet, Piaf, Gainsbourg, Aznavour, Ferrat, Ferré, Montand, Salvador, même Hardy et Dutronc valent mieux. Après, j'ai un petit faible pour Higelin et Bashung, t'as le droit de ne pas accrocher.

Pour les comparaisons : Trenet est une grande inspiration de Brassens et les deux avaient beaucoup d'admiration l'un pour l'autre : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRXJyw200TI
Piaf : c'est une interprète, pas un compositeur, la comparaison ne parait pas adaptée. Pareil pour Aznavour, qui en plus est beaucoup, beaucoup moins riche dans ses thèmes et ses interprétations (je ne crois pas que j'arriverai à me faire l'intégrale sans saigner des oreilles). Idem pour Montand. Hardy et Dutronc sont loin d'avoir une oeuvre aussi riche... Salvador, je ne connais pas assez. Ferrat, oui c'est assez proche, le placer très au-dessus, j'ai du mal à comprendre pourquoi.

Bref, parmi ceux que tu cites, je suis persuadé qu'aucun d'eux ne s'estiment meilleurs compositeurs ou se sentiraient blessé d'être mis dans la même catégorie que Brassens.

There are many more, especially by some half crazy Russian politician which babbles about greatness of USSR on a weekly basis. Almost every month I see an article or an interview from him in Lithuanian news webpages about how it would benefit FSU countries to reform back the soviet union or join back with Russia by other means.

Also there is constant flow of Moscow funded articles about ""how degenerate west and it's values are pushed on our pure, fragile souls"" and almost always a solution is - resign from EU and ask Russia for guidance. This type of propaganda will only increase in the coming years. The ""Nationalists"", ""Greens"", some of the minorities parties are guaranteed to be funded from Moscow. One ruling party was accused of links to Kremlin and demanded proof threatened impeachment for slander, but shut up after seeing the documents. About the others mentioned here, it is real easy to spot. Anything Moscow does = good, anything from EU = terrible. Example: Recent events in Ukraine.

England and France have a long tradition of involving themselves in power games. Even today, it is not uncommon to see French or English involvement in the affairs of a large array of nations, particularly former colonial conquests.  I don't think that is what people would want from a European military. Europeans do not want to be involved in a backing coups in the Central African Republic. No one wants to see the EU act as the US has.

The Germans, despite being the aggressor in two World Wars, do not quite have this tradition. In fact, a lot of tension can be said to have arisen from the fact Germany *didnt* have it.  While World War 2 was predominantly German aggression, I do not think its a fair characterization of Germany. World War I had many points where a number of nations could have pulled back and avoided the bloodshed that occurred. The treatment of the Germans *was* harsh. The Germans had already perceived a French/Russian alliance as an existential threat. The terms of the treaty only fueled the nationalism that have rise to World War 2.  Even there, on a very basic level, if the allied powers had not been so intent on neutering the German state, it is unlikely the structure for Hitler to rise would have existed at all.

Ukraine was the most important character behind Transnistria. It was they who pushed most for Transnistria's break free and gave support. Check [this map](http://adevarul.ro/assets/adevarul.ro/MRImage/2013/01/15/50f5a73e7bdf470905482381/646x404.jpg) to understand why it's important to Ukraine.

Also, have a look at the ethnic structure of [Transnistria] (http://historymaps.ro/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Transnistria-harta-etnica-2004b.jpg).

Russian and Ukrainian interests were until now more or less aligned. But now we see a violent rupture, and each will see a new course.

Russia has 1200 soldiers in Transnistria, that they are only under control of Russia and not under control from transnistrian authorities (who say they have an own army?).

Transnistria was lead until 2011 by an ethnic russian which received huge support from Russia, [Igor Smirnov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Smirnov) but in [2011's elections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnistrian_presidential_election,_2011) a new figure won, an ethnic ukrainian named [Yevgheny Shevciuk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Shevchuk) and even a runner up (as Igor Smirnov got only 3rd place) was another ethnic ukrainian named [Anatoly Kaminski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoliy_Kaminski).

Yes he never signed it. Because even after the deal the situation didn't calm down. 

Here, the day before the deal: 

&gt; Feb 20: Violence resumes within hours of a truce being announced. Government snipers shoot protesters from rooftops leading to deadliest day of the crisis so far with over 70 deaths.

You know, those government snipers that apparently were not from the government after all? So there was a truce, but someone had interest and pushed hard for destabilisation, and even then they reached a deal, and protesters ignored it and took over the streets. Then he ran away. 

And fuck off with the victim blaming. No one's saying those shot, or their parents are to blame. Those are the victims. As are some of government police who got shot, and some Russian soldiers who have to 
follow orders they don't like. 

But don't act like there's not blame on all sides because there is.

I think it's split, depends on country. But i don't think either party (for/against) is over 60%. I don't have any data for Romania, but we're pretty russophobic so i see the majority going for anything that would hurt Russia. I believe the more educated to be against, as they would see how it could return to bite our ass.

&gt; (2) What is your personal opinion about it? Are sanctions morally justified (assuming Russia proceeds the way they seem to do, practically annexing Crimea)? And if they are morally justified, can Europe stand the economic fallout that might result?

Morally justified? Not really, as we never took any actions in far worse situations where people were actually killed. We should firstly sanction ourself it it was about morality, for supporting Libya, Irak and even Syria. 

More over, i don't think it would help our (EU) interests in any way. Distancing yourself from your ""opponent"" means both have to shout harder to make themselves heard by the other party, and most times, a lot of it will get lost on the way.

About the economic fallout, i'm sure we can stand any economic fallout, just as Russia can. But do we want economic fallout? Do we want to decrease our economies? Remember that this isn't the world against Russia as they are not NK, or even Iran. They have very powerful allies, with BRICS countries having almost half of the globe's population.

true,New-Atlantis,EURO,European Union,"Here is a rough translation of some of the passages from ‘NachDenkSeiten’ published by two SPD politicians who served under previous German governments in various capacities. The text is in reply to Egon Bahr’s claim that the current crisis will not lead to war. 

**Reduction of confrontation culmination in 1989 and the subsequent increase of hostilities that led to the failure of a European peace order**

The successful political efforts of Egon Bahr and its actual failure demonstrate this fatal development. As a close collaborator of Willy Brandt, Egon Bahr and others made a substantial contribution to the reduction of tension between East and West in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. We need to recall some of the basic ideas of the policy of détente of these years because they are now disregarded: understanding the other side, renunciation of violence, change through rapprochement, reduction of ideological confrontation and ‘enemy images’, and consequently, disarmament and reduction of military blocks.

1989 is the culmination of this policy and also the start of a new ideological rearmament. The Berlin Wall fell, … the Warsaw pact and the Soviet Union were dissolved. People regained self-determination. 

Egon Bahr was among those who submitted the proposal for the basic program of the SPD that was adopted in Dec. 89. The relevant passages are:

""**Our goal is to replace the military alliances by a European peace order.** Until that can be achieved, the Federal Republic of Germany shall realize its security objectives in the Atlantic Alliance, provided the Federal Republic can realize its own security interests in said Alliance. The upheaval in Eastern Europe reduced the military and increased the political significance of the alliances and assigns a new function to said alliances: organize the dissolution of the alliances and the transition to a new European peace order while maintaining stability. This also opens the perspective for an end to the stationing of Soviet and US forces in Europe, outside their respective territories.

The Warsaw pact was dissolved, but Nato expanded to the borders of the modern Russia. Nato was ‘manipulated’ to change from a defensive alliance to a military alliance for interventions outside Nato territory.  

The armament interests and presumably also the interests of economic resources in different regions of the world were stronger than our dreams of December 1989, no matter how justified our dreams were and still are to this day.

At the same time - and that is probably worse than the maintenance of the NATO alliance - the goal of a European peace order has been disregarded and a new ideological rearmament and enemy images have been built.

**The confidence created by the policy of detente has been thrown away.**

Put yourself in the position of the Russians and the Russian leadership: Gorbachev created the hope that there could be true partnership in Europe and that Russia would belong to this partnership. Viewed from the perspective of many Russians, this aim justified the loss of the Soviet Union. They then had to experience how the country was plundered by Western interests and Russian oligarchs under Yeltsin. And then they experienced that different from the Warsaw pact, Nato was not dissolved but instead drew closer to the Russian border. In the case of Germany, they observed in detail how the mandate of the military and the Alliance as defensive organizations, stipulated in the constitution, was then rededicated for military interventions outside Nato territory.

- The Russians have seen how the US, supported by Nato, built new missile bases in Eastern Europe, …

- The Russians experienced how the West deals with formally democratically elected governments if they don’t comply with Western expectations:

- US diplomats disregarded the elected leaders of a sovereign country and consult about which opposition figure was to form the next government.

- The biggest party of the coalition government in Germany picks the political leader it likes in the Ukraine and sponsors him through its party foundation.

- The US spends millions to sponsor NGOs and probably also right-wing thugs.

- Western leaders turn up on the Maidan to heat up the atmosphere. 

- The EU tries to attract the Ukraine while rebuffing Russia.

- Why does the EU not offer closer cooperation to Russia? Why is the EU building new walls between “Europe here” and the “Russians there”? It is not the task of the EU to use its institutions to divide Europe and to increase confrontation.

- It is moreover highly probable that the US used the Ukraine for secrete detention camps like Lithuania, Rumania and Poland. 

- The way Putin is represented in the Western media is a constant provocation.

- Did we impose sanctions when G.W. Bush systematically lied to the world public about his invasion of Iraq?
	
- Do we appreciate how difficult it is to govern a country like Russia? 

- With a few exceptions, the media in Germany have shown themselves to be undemocratic and dominated by stupidity and one-sided agitation.

- The mediation of the EU foreign ministers was celebrated as a success while ignoring that the agreement failed because the protesters didn’t respect it and thereby triggered the flight of the president.

The authors come to the conclusion that war is a distinct possibility due to the escalation of tension since 89. They failed to mention how the West carved up the former Yugoslavia and bombarded Serbia.

The average entry salary for those holding a Master's in Betriebswirtschaft is ca. 40.000 Euro. It depends on the field you are working in and the size of your company, but reaching 44.800€ should be possible. 

&gt; Are 18 months long enough? I'll probably be speaking intermediate German by then, have a bachelor's degree in law and a master's in business or something similar, with a couple of internship experiences. If you've seen someone of my qualifications get a suitable job, please, share the story with me.

18 month should be enough. Brush up your German and get a certificate for it. Do some internships and writer your Master's thesis in a company. They might be interested in hiring you afterwards.

And France should have more influence over Canada than any other country for the same reason.

And Denmark/Norway/Sweden should be a self contained bloc of mutual influence because of how often they warred with one another.

And German Schleswig-Holstein should be influenced primarily by Denmark because it used to be a possession of the Danish monarchy.

Ukraine, on the whole, does not want to be influenced by Russia. There is no good reason why Russia **should** have any influence over them.

1. Das Parlament kann sich nicht anders entscheiden, obwohl es will. Vielleicht fehlt mir hier das Problembewusstsein, aber ich sehe hier kein Problem.
2. Durch Volksabstimmung ist eine Barriere, wie du es nennst, entstanden, die aus Sicht des Parlaments beseitigt werden muss. Auch das ist kein Problem meiner Ansicht nach, denn fuer wirkliche Notfaelle kann man entweder Eilkompetenzen einraeumen (z.B. fuer den Verteidungsfall) oder abaendernde Entscheide forcieren.

You don't need to make a European army - you can start with stuff like having all the kit across Europe be compatible so that joint operations can be launched at short notice. 

I also think people here who think the current Russian leadership is reasonable and will be swayed or appeased by diplomacy are very naive. The question for me is not whether we have to take a stand but when we're going to take it. Putin has said that he regards the break up of the Soviet Union as the greatest tragedy of the 20th c. I don't think we should be complacent about his desires to reverse that and get back Eastern Europe. I don't think he'd try anything major tomorrow, but I can see a danger of a piece-by-piece land grab.

Equality should not only not be a goal, it should be purposefully be avoided. Humans are different beyond our basic needs we have different requirements and everybody values things differently. Also differences spur us on to be creative, competitive or hardworking. That basic productivity increase that capitalism is so good at providing disappears.

Great, then we don't need the TTIP if there are already similar agreements in force.

&gt;The iPhone is designed by Apple in the US,

And that's probably the end of Apple too, because most of the hardware development is now in the Far East. In fact, Apple relies on its competitors to develop and build Apple products. How long do you think that'll work? Why should anyone pay for an iPhone if you can have a superior Smartphone, or other products, for less? Once Apple loses its ability to charge an indecent premium for its quasi-monopoly the collapse will be rapid. When the shareholder smell blood, it's time for the junk heap. Apple had to buy back its own stocks for nearly a year just to keep the stock price from falling. And that is the whole story of US capitalism.

The capital accumulates in the Far East while the debt accumulates in the US.

Anyways, I don't have time to reply in detail, but what I said remains valid.

I disagree, people that deal with the money of millions should be paid milions. Particulary a CEO has no responsibility to the pensioners but to his shareholders. It is not they're fault for the system to allow them to risk other peoples money and not face consequences. It's like blaming the teachers that children are stupid, and neglecting the system that dictates how they should teach.

The difference between a guard dog and a guard isn't made by what they guard but by the oportunity cost and the sacrifice they make with doing their job properly. The same thing is valid when dealing with a salemen or the director of yahoo. One position can be filled by anyone and incompetence has limited effects, the other is so complex any candidate is underqualified and incompetence has deep consequences. Now that is from a theoretical perspective, in practice even administrative boards have monkey brains and their decisions are mostly driven by loss aversion.

Limit power and you stop corruption. If no man has significant power over any other man then there is no corruption. The power of a law is only apparently linked to its coercive properties. The true power rests in the fear of lawlessnes and individual vulnerability that acompanies it. We are raised to think that law define justice and then we are suprised by tha lawless nature of the men that create those laws.

 Currently we have laws to protect individuals, people in general and the state. The first 2 cases can be judged by ordinary people and you would achieve the same level of justice that you have now. You do not require overly excessive power and a moderate level of force is needed to enforce them.

Russia under Putin is very stable (compared to the Ukraine for example). And let us be grateful for that. Trying to destabilize Russia like the West has destabilized the Middle East would be criminally insane. Russia has always had a European outlook since the time of the Czars. 

Anyways, this is not about the EU swallowing up Russia, this is about an equal partnership. For Russia that would be a lot more attractive than the only alternative: an alliance with China. 

The foundations for this partnership is trade and mutual dependence. The game the West has played in the Ukraine is dangerous. The avowed aim of Western diplomacy to ""isolate"" Russia is also extremely dangerous.

They don't want to cooperate with ""the West"". They oppose democracy.

&gt;Nach diesem „Zehnten Gesetz zur Änderung des Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetzes"" wird in § 22 BImSchG ein neuer Absatz 1a eingefügt. Dieser bestimmt, dass Geräuscheinwirkungen, die von Kindertageseinrichtungen, Kinderspielplätzen und ähnlichen Einrichtungen durch Kinder hervorgerufen werden, im Regelfall keine schädlichen Umwelteinwirkungen sind. Außerdem dürfen bei der Beurteilung der Geräuscheinwirkungen Immissionsgrenz- und -richtwerte nicht herangezogen werden.

Just think about it, children playing were seen as bad as loud music or construction or something.

I used to go to Italy with my family on vacations a lot and one thing that always struck us was how the free the children were.
Say you were in a restaurant, there were children running around, being loud ... being children. That was in immense contrast to my experiences at home.

It may be my own experience and I do not claim to be 100% right, but I do feel that in order for our birthrate to get higher, it will not suffice to throw money at couples. The culture has to change.

* [Since 2010, the state paid over 2 billion Euros for purchasing stakes in companies of strategical importance.](http://www.politics.hu/20140305/state-has-paid-out-huf-657-billion-for-company-stakes-says-opposition/) Opposition doesn't like that and nor does the majority of people because of the shadiness of these deals. 

* Fidesz is well known for its questionable business standards, lack of transparency in deal making, and their fondness to grant huge contracts to companies owned by ""friendly"" entrepreneurs, and the topic was definitely on the menu this week. [An Olympic surfer's 6-month old company with no experience in the field \(database handling\) was granted an 80k€ state contract](http://www.politics.hu/20140305/olympic-surfer-girlfriend-of-former-official-scores-government-computer-contract/), and the fact that she's the girlfriend of a Fidesz-leader, ex-undersecretary to the Minister of Justice surely played no role in the decision. 

* In another sports related scandal, a transparency institute successfully sued the National Olympic Committee to release the list of premiums handed out after the 2012 Olympics, total 6,5 million Euros. Countless questionable recipients were found on the list, including coaches who retired well before the qualifications started for the Olympics, administration officials who played very minor roles in the sportspeople's successes and such. If I recall correctly, we are 3rd in the world in the size of premiums given after Olympic medals, a gold is worth ~100k€ and a lifelong stipend of 800€/month after the age 35.

*Election*

* [Hungarian election system explained](http://www.politics.hu/20140306/everything-you-need-to-know-about-april-election/). 

* A former Socialist politician who was released from jail last September after serving a 6-year sentence for stealing over 200k€ from government funds under the disguise of non-existent NGOs came forward and claimed [Socialist Party leaders bribed him 160k in 2006 to avoid him running for a position again](http://www.politics.hu/20140307/former-socialist-says-he-was-bribed-by-socialists-not-to-run-in-2006-election/). He stepped down from his roles in 2004 after making a Holocaust joke at a memorial event and is conveniently releasing a book on Monday. First this case was treated by the media as something huge, but he failed to come forward with any evidence and then people kind of remembered he is an ex-con, so the story is pretty much dead now.

The electoral system in Romania is made in such a way to prevent any alternative from the corrupt mainstream parties.

**Registering a party** requires 25.000 signatures from across the country (there is a minimum number of signatures from at least 20 counties). You have to pay a ""guarantee"" (more than half a million euros) per election. If you don't get any seats, you lose it. If you don't get enough votes for two consecutive elections, the party is automatically disbanded.

The number of signatures for registering a party is higher than every other country in Europe. For instance, in the UK it's as easy as paying a £150 fee. Even Putin's Russia makes it easier to register a party!

**Registering an independent candidate** for European Parliament elections in Romania requires 100.000 signatures. Other countries which allow independent candidates for European Parliament elections (many do not, but that's a different thing) require far fewer signatures for the same election: 

* Malta: 4 [osce.org](http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/eu/38680)
* Ireland: 60 [Europarl.ie](http://www.europarl.ie/en/european_elections_/european_elections_1/candidates.html)
* Luxemburg: 250 [osce.org](http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/eu/38680)
* Austria: 2.600 [osce.org](http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/eu/38680)
* Slovenia: 3.000 [osce.org](http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/eu/38680)
* Belgium: 5.000 [uni-mannheim.de](http://www.pedz.uni-mannheim.de/daten/edz-ma/ep/09/EST24511.pdf)
* Spain: 15.000 [osce.org](http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/eu/38680)

**The media** tends to be affiliated with one party or another. Sometimes, the owner is the leader of a party, using the TV stations and newspapers as propaganda machines. Even if you have some popularity, the media will simply ignore you. They'll pretend you don't exist, or, if they do present you, they'll do it derisively.

Basically, if you want to participate in the elections in Romania, you need lots of money and the only people who have the money are the local oligarchs and corrupt politicians and their family.

&gt;___L.H.O.O.Q.___ (French pronunciation: ​[el aʃ o o ky]) is a work of art by [Marcel Duchamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp) first conceived in 1919. The work is one of what Duchamp referred to as [readymades](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readymades_of_Marcel_Duchamp), or more specifically an assisted ready-made. Pioneered by him, the readymade involves taking mundane, often utilitarian objects not generally considered to be art and transforming them, by adding to them, changing them, or (as in the case of his most famous work [*Fountain*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp\))) simply renaming them and placing them in a gallery setting. In *L.H.O.O.Q.* the *objet trouvé* (""found object"") is a cheap postcard reproduction of [Leonardo da Vinci](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci)'s *[Mona Lisa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa)* onto which Duchamp drew a moustache and beard in pencil and appended the title.

But if you should follow the decisions made by the Riksdagen, we need to lower our energy consumption from fossil fuels and increase our use from renewable energy. A higher price/kWH should motivate a move for more efficient use of electricity. 

We did re-divide them for the sole purpose of semi-automatic construktion of power-producers, That the region that use the most electricity vs produced MWH has the highest prices -&gt; which will in the end, generate more power producers in that specific region. 

Sweden is a country which is dependent on export, so yes on cheap, but not necessary produced for us. 

The only thing that's keeping the electricity prices from going up is the old hydro-power-plants Sweden got upnorth, delivering 48% of the total electricity last year, or 2012. Otherwise we would stand here with the same prices as Germany already. But the EU(Ruled by Germany) wants the ""free"" power generated up here in the north so they have decided that we should sell it cheap to them. Which is also a self-sanitation, just like the different energy areas in the Nordic countries.

I *kinda* understand why they're doing that. They keep saying that Ukraine/Kiev was taken over illegaly by fascists, so they have to ""protect"" Crimea. If they agree to meet and talk, it's like saying ""yeah, you're the representative of this country"". If they accept the current government as legitimate, then there is no longer a reason for them to keep ""protecting"" Crimea. By sitting down to talks they immediately lose the talks.

Essentially, the current Russian stance is ""there is no legitimate power in Ukraine right now, we're here to keep peace"".

true,derFreiBierFred,GERM,Deutschland,"&gt; Aber du musst bedenken, dass der ordentliche Feminismus Frauen**rechte** und nicht Frauen**privilegien** fördern will.
&gt; Deshalb ein Beispiel: Die Frauenquote (in Vorständen).

Mir persönlich ist es wichtig, dass man klar zwischen Privatpersonen und dem Staat trennt. Ja, Frauen werden von Privatpersonen (Arbeitgebern oder wem auch immer) sicherlich diskriminiert, und das ist nicht gut so. Privatpersonen morden auch gelegentlich aus Rache, und oft wird das von der Gesellschaft als richtig angesehen (""War ein Kinderschänder, der hat das verdient.""). Der Staat jedoch sollte meiner Meinung nach nie zum Mörder werden (keine Todesstrafe), und genau so sollte der Staat auch nie zum Diskriminierenden werden.

Deswegen sollte der Staat Frauenquoten so formulieren, dass es sich eben nicht so anhört als räume man Frauen hier ein besonderes Privileg ein, dass man Männern nicht eingeräumt hat.

&gt; Formulierung 1: Frauenquote: 40% aller Vorstandsposten müssen von Frauen besetzt werden.

Das ist in meinen Augen eine sexistische Formulierung, die Frauen ein Recht einräumt, dass Männern nicht eingeräumt wurde.

&gt; Formulierung 2: ""Geschlechterquote"": Das Geschlechterverhältnis in Vorstandsposten darf niemals ungleicher sein als 40:60.

Die Formulierung ist etwas holprig, aber was solls. Hier wird den Frauen UND den Männern ein Recht eingeräumt, und somit ist es eben kein Privileg mehr sondern ein Recht, wie du sagtest. Das das in der Praxis wohl irrelevant ist ob man Formulierung 1 oder 2 nimmt ist mir klar, aber mir geht's hier ums Prinzip.",0,1394385519,null,0,false,0,cfya57j,t3_1zsxql,t1_cfya57j,t1_cfxikf2,null,1432725151,2,false,de,t5_22i0,2

 My dad came into my room holding his hat
 I knew he was leaving,
 He sat on my bed told me some facts.
 Son, I have a duty, calling on me
 You and your sister be brave my little soldier
 And don't forget all I told ya
 You're the mister of the house now remember this
 And when you wake up in the morning give ya momma a kiss
 Then I had to say goodbye
 In the morning woke momma with a kiss on each eyelid,
 Even though I'm only a kid
 Certain things can't be hid
 Momma grabbed me
 Held me like I was made of gold
 But left her inner stories untold
 I said, momma it will be alright
 When daddy comes home, tonight

 Greed is a weapon of mass destruction

 We need to find courage, overcome.
 Inaction is a weapon of mass destruction

 I'm holding it in.
 We taking sides like a politician
 And if I get friction we get to fighting.
 I'll defend my dad he's the best of all men
 and whatever he's doing he's doing the right thing.
 It's frightening, but it makes me mad, 
 Why do all of these people seem to hate my dad?
 And if that ain't enough now I get these spots.
 I go to sleep every night with my stomach in knots
 And what's more, I can hear momma next door
 Explore the radio for reports of war.
 And all we ever seem to do is hide the tears.
 Seems like daddy been gone for years.
 But he was right, now i'm geared up for the fight
 and he would be proud of me,
 If my daddy came home tonight.

 And you ain't going to nirvana or far-vana,
 you're coming right back here to live out your karma.

 waiting for someone else to make us free?
 And we refuse to see

While living in Zurich, he has assualted people he believed to be homosexual. In at least one case, he tried to set one of his victims on fire. ""Puber"" is subspected to be involved in arson attacks and the ""Bellevue-Riots"". Appart from the fact, the he has been living in Viennas 15th district after leaving Zurich, little is known about his person. He is said to have been working for a cleaning company, the magazine ""Vice"" has published [a picture of him](http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRv7JuFiRoo3zT4j-OPYojiNn_wYKQfLj_6syAmAJjIMa4gq3KF), which shows him wearing a diaper with the words *""I am god, you are gay""* written on it. For vandalizing property - the damage is expected to go into millions - he will face up to five years in prison, but commentators expect him to be sent into an instution for mentally disturbed offenders. 
* The second problem of Vienna has been solved. The citizens of the 6th and 7th districed have voted for keeping the pedestrian area in the Mariahilfer Straße. Last Summer, the town government has installed a pedestrian area in parts of this street, that is one of the main shopping streets. The conservative and the right extreme parties have started a campaign against this pedestrian area, that was not really motivated by the issue itself. The town governemnt, a coalition between the Social Democrats and the Green Party has reduced the public transport fares, and extended the parking managment zones, thereby reducing the commuter traffic in the outer districts. The problem with the conservative and right opposition parties is, that they are extremly car-concentrated. The voted was not only about the pedestrian area, but rather about the question weather there is a majority for reducing car traffic. The majority for the pedestrian area is expected to be a motivation for the town government to set measures, that may not only benefit car drivers. The decision increases the chances for an expansion of the tramway network.
* Communal elections in the federal state of Salzburg: The Social Democrats and the Greens remain stabile, the conservative Peoples Party and the right extremists loose, the Neoliberals seem to have entered local parliaments. ""Team Stronach"" was not up for the election.

&gt; &gt;The prices are the in their lowest in years,
&gt; 
&gt; What on earth are you referring to? Take a look at this. Cheapest in year - what about the 90's? 

I was born 1990 I cannot say something about that period, but you are looking at the 2010 and forward, which will make it cheapest in years. You cant compare prices, that is 20 years old, straight of without recalculating for the worth of todays money. 



&gt;&gt;But if you should follow the decisions made by the Riksdagen, we need to lower our energy consumption from fossil fuels and increase our use from renewable energy. A higher price/kWH should motivate a move for more efficient use of electricity

&gt;What? Most of our electricity is from nuclear, hydro, bio or wind? You are confusing petrol with electricity? How can driving less make our electricity cheaper.

After we lifted the CO2-taxes from power producers, Sweden is returning to the use of more and more coal in heat power plants.



&gt;&gt;We did re-divide them for the sole purpose of semi-automatic construktion of power-producers, That the region that use the most electricity vs produced MWH has the highest prices -&gt; which will in the end, generate more power producers in that specific region.

&gt;Wrong again! We had to re-divide them because of the Danes! And the Danes made the electicity more expensive.

Well that's just *ridiculous*, But I could've seen that one coming through lobbying also, but not for that reason.

&gt;&gt;The only thing that's keeping the electricity prices from going up is the old hydro-power-plants Sweden got upnorth, delivering 48% of the total electricity last year, or 2012. Otherwise we would stand here with the same prices as Germany already. But the EU(Ruled by Germany) wants the ""free"" power generated up here in the north so they have decided that we should sell it cheap to them. Which is also a self-sanitation, just like the different energy areas in the Nordic countries

&gt;Yes, which is A) why we should quit NordPol B) Quit the EU C) Tell the EU to stay the fuck away from energy. D) Build more nuclear. E) Stop selling to the Danes.

Da habe ich zwei Einwände

1. Ich glaube nicht, daß hier eine soziale Norm gemeint ist. Die Ausage der Demonstrantinnen verstehe ich so, daß sie meinen, daß die Gesellschaft ihnen ihren Körperumfang oder Körpermasse vorschreibt. Sie würden wahrscheinlich mit dem BMI argumentieren und den mit der DIN-476 vergleichen (Papiergrößen), und einen dahingehenden Vergleich bemühen. Sie fühlen ihren Körper mit einem „Normkörper” verglichen. Um ihr eigenes Sozialverhalten geht es hier sicher weniger.

2. Die Frage, wie die Norm nach Punkt 1 entstanden ist, implizierst nebenbei mit „irgendjemand“, der der Ansicht ist, daß die Demonstrantinnen sich daran zu halten haben. Mein Gegenargument, das du gerne aufgreifen kannst, habe ich bereits im letzen Kommentar vorgebracht.

Aus diesen Punkten und meiner letzten Antwort folgere ich, daß es doch um Attraktivität geht.

Ich weiß, daß es leider diese Menschen gibt, die sich über Dicke lustig machen; das wollte ich auch keinesfalls von „körperlichen und sozialen Konsequenzen aus dem Übergewicht“ abgedeckt wissen, alleine schon, weil das eine latente Bevormundung wäre, und somit ein Versuch, die Freiheit der Betreffenden, mit ihrem Körper zu tun, was sie wollen, einzuschränken, was aber eingangs meine Voraussetzung war.

Nach meiner Erfahrung kommen solche Angriffe hauptsächlich von Menschen, die in ihrer Art, ihr eigenes kümmerliches Ego durch Ruck-Zuck-Gleichungen an Oberflächlichkeiten wie Körpermasse, Geschlecht, Konfession oder sozialem Status aufzuhängen auf bemerkenswerte Weise den Nazis gleichen. Es gab sie immer, man kann versuchen, was man will, man wird sie nicht los, und jeder wird irgendwann in seinem Leben mit ihren oder einem ihrer Artverwandten zu tun bekommen.

&gt;(Zumal ich sagen muss, dass Menschen dafür zu kritisieren, dass sie ""unnormal"" seien, für mich auch schon mehr als nur ein bisschen Geschmäckle hat.)

Lo scopo di queste pratiche è quello di accentuare sempre di più la nettissima divisione tra corpo e spirito, su cui si basa la fede cristiana. E tanto più sposti l'importanza sullo spirito (mortificando corpo e sensi) e tanto più sarai pronto a far di tutto pur di accettare la salvezza dello stesso (per la quale dipendi dalla parola di Dio, ovviamente). La carne è ciò che ci trattiene lontano dal cielo, la prigione dello spirito immortale, e perciò può essere martoriata, mentre la sofferenza è un dono, perchè ci avvicina a Gesù, che ha sofferto per noi (leva del senso di colpa).

Rationally it makes no sense whatsoever and only emphasises the theory that it is a personal obsession with the old USSR and an embryonic Nazi style mentality.

The fact is he already had everything he wanted in Crimea. A huge naval and military base. Acquiescence of the people of Crime should any war arrive in that region.

Now it looks like he will end up annexing Crimea. But the result will be years of recriminations. A renewed militarisation of the relationship with Europe and Ukraine. A more activated and energised NATO at a time when the whole atmosphere was becoming sleepy and non threatening. And let's remember, though he has the upper hand as regards gas and oil now ... that won't last forever.

Had Putin taken a conciliatory and friendly and supportive line with Ukraine from the start, he would probably have gotten a self governing Crimea to an even greater extent than before. A friendly and cooperative Ukraine that would pass on NATO and maybe even the EU.

That's not true. Yanukovich still controlled police forces, there was no danger to him whatsoever at this point. He safely left the city without any interruption. But **even if** there was danger for him in Kiev (thought experiment, he was safe), he was able to move to some place safe for him -- like Crimea -- and work like a president there. He didn't do this. Instead he just voluntarily disappeared, stopping to communicate even with his own party.

Nope, but I know that you are just repeating bullshit Putin propaganda again. See the map of the snipers: https://mapsengine.google.com/map/viewer?mid=zVKhquFCeTxo.kGCJAOCfBD7U Only few positions were accessible to protesters, and they were accessible to Yanukovich forces just as well. Most of the shots were fired from positions controlled solely by Yanukovich, and were inaccessible to protesters. Sorry to disappoint, but the snipers were from the government.

Yes, that's classic victim blaming. When you are says something in ""both sides are guilty"" in situation when guilt of sides are incomparable, when one side's actions are criminal, while other side's action are just mistakes -- that's victim blaming.

true,Dantemius,null,null,"Hey Sypilus, 

New-Atlantis seems to have a sophisticated insight into what the EU is thinking about the upcoming power shift. Indeed I agree with two things already mentioned that will make the change happening:

Culture and Technology – 

&gt; Sharing the same culture with Japan and Korea, they will develop in the same way and become technology leaders.

I believe New-Atlantis is referring to a similarity focused around strong work ethics that are typical for cultures whose main source of nutrition comes from growing rice. Rice is very labor intensive. Those cultures survival depended on hard work. They’ll literary outwork the rest of the world and it might just feel natural to them.
Furthermore, Western culture is centered on the individual. Therefore, to have personal ownership of property and even ideas (enforced through patents and copyright laws) seems to be rather obvious. Well, Eastern Cultures are much more focused on the collective. In fact, for the Chinese ‘imitation is the highest form of admiration’. To the US it’s unlawful use of propriety information. But if it’s good and it works, they’ll assimilate it. 

-
&gt; Technology:

Apple once was a very good example on how product design and marketing can create success. But New-Atlantis is absolutely right. Actually, even if they wanted, Apple couldn’t facilitate their production in the US because they wouldn’t be able to recruit the amount of skilled workforce required. (Jobs told that to Obama according to his biography).

 At the same time, the Chinese elite is educated in US and EU universities. They understand the markets very well. They are already investing more in clean energy research, building new and state of the art infrastructure, while quickly producing a domestic education system that trains more engineers than the US. 

And don’t forget. Even when there seem to remain areas of expertise in which there are big leads in in Technology… Technologies can be bought. A few years ago, Chinese investors bought a German steel mill, deconstructed it here and shipped it to China. Actually in recent time a German multi-national (Thyssen Krupp) tried to build a German designed steel mill in China to then ship it to their customers to South America. It didn’t work out and the Company ended up losing ~ 5 bn over that attempt. But I am sure they’ll learn from their mistakes.

Compared to such ambitions, building a better and cheaper Chinese iPhone sounds easy… I believe that neither US nor EU companies have yet felt the cold and efficient breath of real Chinese competition on their neck… It’s coming. Do you think, the US domestic market is prepared to adapt to face the changing tides?

Whataboutism

Come again, Comrade?
Jan 31st 2008

SOVIET propagandists during the cold war were trained in a tactic that their western interlocutors nicknamed “whataboutism”. Any criticism of the Soviet Union (Afghanistan, martial law in Poland, imprisonment of dissidents, censorship) was met with a “What about...” (apartheid South Africa, jailed trade-unionists, the Contras in Nicaragua, and so forth).

It is not a bad tactic. Every criticism needs to be put in a historical and geographical context. A country that has solved most of its horrible problems deserves praise, not to be lambasted for those that remain. Similarly, behaviour that may be imperfect by international standards can be quite good for a particular neighbourhood.

 No legal nihilist, heReuters
But it can be overdone—and in the case of Soviet propagandists, it was, and gave rise to subversive jokes For example: A caller to a radio program asks, “What is the average wage of an American manual worker?” A long pause ensues. Then the answer comes: “U nich negrov linchuyut” (“Over there they lynch Negroes”)—a phrase that, by the time of the Soviet collapse, had become a synecdoche for Soviet propaganda as a whole.

Whataboutism seemed to have died a natural death at the end of the cold war. But now it seems to be making a comeback. Your columnist took part in a live television conversation with some Russian colleagues last week, supposedly to discuss the bad image of Russia in the British press. It would be possible to make some quite reasonable points from the Russian side: is the media reaction to the Kremlin's treatment of the British Council selective or disproportionate? Are there angles to this story that nobody is exploring that might put Britain's stance in a different light?

Instead, the viewers were treated to a lively display of whataboutism. How could the West criticise Russia for sabre-rattling, asked the eloquent Aleksei Pushkov, when America and its allies had not just rattled sabres, but actually used them in Iraq. And so on and so forth.

It would help if Russia had a word for whataboutism. Literally, it could be kaknaschyotism. A crisp remark about lynching also raises a laugh and makes the point.

But the bigger problem is finding a way to discuss Russia's problems in a way that does not immediately lead to a sterile argument reminiscent of the ponderous tirades of the 1980s.

One solution is to use points made by Russian leaders themselves. Guess who said this: “Russia is a country of legal nihilism at the level...that no European country can boast of…Corruption in the official structures has a huge scale”. That sounds as though it came from some opposition politician such as Garry Kasparov—the sort of marginal (or marginalised) figure that Russians often say gains far too much western attention. But the speaker was Dmitri Medvedev (pictured above), successor-designate to Vladimir Putin.

Another is for outsiders to show a bit more self-criticism. It is worth noting early on in the discussion some outrageous flaws in American (or British, or German, or French) foreign policy, as well as recent scandals involving corruption and abuse of power.

The most powerful western asset during the last cold war was not bigger nukes or higher living standards, but self-criticism. However bad western governments may be, they risk trouble eventually—from the media, the courts or the voters. That is not something that one can say with much confidence about Russia now.",0,1394400953,null,0,false,0,cfygk9e,t3_1zz7lb,t1_cfygk9e,t1_cfyf7og,null,1432728555,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

&gt; Paet was poorly informed and based his thoughts on hearsay (funny thing that even hearsay he based his opinion on didn't support his claims). It was taped on February 26, and he didn't know at the time that actually there was active investigation. 

This is hilarious. So he talks about it in great detail, referencing specific evidence, and talks to a colleague as if it were sound. When caught, suddenly he was misinformed and also misquoted his source... How surprising! I'm sure had this been a leaked conversation from the Russians you'd also value those affirmations after the fact, more than the private conversation itself. 

Funny too  you don't bother to provide a source. Provide some reference for your claims. If he said what you claim, and if there is an investigation in course, I'd actually like to know. Best I could find was [this](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/05/world/europe/ukraine-leaked-audio-recording/). He where he releases a small statement, and no claims of having been misinformed nor any claims his source was poorly informed. So, show me your references.

All I can say is, getting a work visa in Germany is easy. You need a job that pays as a minimum more than €659 per month. That is all. With a job that pays you €659 a month, you get a visa which has to be extended once every year. However, to extend your visa, you need to show that your job contracts extends atleast the next year. Also, €659 equals a tight living standard, so you obviously want to earn more. With a Masters in Germany, you can quite easily get more than €44,800, if not immediately, atleast within a year of working in Germany.

The EU Blue Card is not a prerequisite for a work visa here. It is just a confirmation of your eligibility to work. I know a lot of foreigners who earn well above €60,000 p.a. and haven't considered getting a EU Blue Card yet. From my understanding, the only advantage is shortening the time towards EU citizenship and reducing the dependency of having to show a job contract to get a visa extension.

 ""Den som stiftar lagar, skall icke döma. Den som dömmer, skall icke fängsla. Den som fängslar, skall icke stifta lagar."" The same principle applies to Companies ""Those who makes/generates power, shall not deliver it, those who deliver it, shall not sell it and those who sells it, shall not make it."" It's the same principle, applied to every god damn institution or company acting within the Swedish borders. 

That's the basic of democracy in Sweden while applied to each field.
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't! I am not old enough, and even if I were, I'd voted no, and at least, I, unlike you, are trying to change things. Why aren't you?
&gt; 

I, unlike you, are acting within the range of what is possible to make. And who are you to procrastinate about me and my definition of how long time is(or the closest to measure time is [τ\(Tau\)](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidskonstant)), when you apparently are in the same generation as me. I doubt it, that you can relate to the low costs made in the early 90's(Which is a fact because you couldn't vote in '94). 

&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; That is the worst excuse I have ever heard. Serioiusly, grow up. With every single one of your answer you just prove that you have no clue what you are talking about. That is not how competitive, energy or security policy is made. That is why one has ""energiuppgörelse"" and deals. With your ""explanation"" or attempt to explain that means, that every fourth year, we and every other single democracy, would change the policy about everything. Well, guess what, that doesn't happen. There is absolutely no reason, none, for S and M not to make a grand bargain, and the fact that you are attempting to claim your ignorance on that it is just a four year stretch. One does neither build an nuclear, or repair your precious dam on four year budgets, and you dam well know it. So again, you are extremely out of touch with politics, and with energy politics.

When you think competitive, all you can see is the closed nuclear power plant in Barsebäck, and the 1 or 2 generator at Oskarshamn, Forsmark and Ringhals, which intervals of services, would determine that they are out of Juice to deliver on those cores. 

What Sweden and the Nordic countries really need is to expand on efficiency on their current generators. Sweden needs to go forward on the big front, like we have done, we don't want to stand their bare-handed when uranium or some other particles is out of reach for us(look at waste, importing from Norway in some cities)

A country can make a total different turn in 4 years time(Depending on a change of PM). Just look at the 4 years ('06-'10) were it has made a lot changes(, not all for the good but they did at least save Sweden with immigration(with all what its worth with more housing and other things) around the crisis of 2008). 
&gt; 
&gt; Are you afraid, or can't you answer them?

I am sure of that I'm answering your questions and you keep on harassing me.

&gt; When you don't know about prices, Denmark or the EU, you try to save yourself by talking about coal, and oil - not really relevant are they?

No, I was introducing you to more fact because I thought that you wasn't well informed. I am currently studying energy technologies, so I am well informed on the pro's of different power suppliers and with the environmental consequences of those suppliers.
&gt; 
&gt; Because things are so brilliant in the Greece, Spain and Italy now? Have you even started to understand the disaster that is the Euro?

Well, you did certainly translate/understand that answer wrong. I vote for EU, for what's best and for what I think is good for Sweden and the relation to EU and where it shall go. On the same principle does Italians, Greeks, Londoners, Belgians, Germans.

I know you are well-aware of why Allied forces sat down with Germany after the ww2 to initiate business. 
&gt; 
&gt; Explain to me then in detail, how you are going to make sure that corrupt countries in the EU are going to stop being corrupt and make sure that the transfers work? I am dying to hear, because I have studies (here for example that says that the structural funds are ineffective. Yet you claim, that you can change the energy policy in the EU.

Well, I do not have a solution for the problem with corruption, neither does you. Because that's one of the reasons why you want to leave EU, it's easier not to look on the problem. 


&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; OK, prove it. I'd like for you to post academic studies that prove that it will happen, through the EU. In detail. Because, if the EU helps against CO2 emissions, why did Germany choose coal instead of nuclear? Wtf is Greece up to for example, they have been in the EU since 1981?

Well, shutting down their nuclear instead of coal is not the brightest moment. But! I would like to present to you if you are unaware of the [20-20-20 deal!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_climate_and_energy_package)

Well, I can't defend actions taken years before I was born, the same way as you can not relate to the prices from the early 90's. This is an easy way out but I can't defend why the initiated countries around the Mediterranean Area before, just for an example, Sweden.

I can't for the love of God!(smashing keys!)

Sweden is an net-payer of EU, just the same way as New York State is an net-payer for some redneck area in USA. It's the way it got to be so that areas don't get uncivilised and we could still use the areas for further profits in the future.

National elections work like this:

&gt; Seats: 80 (only 56 filled (70%), the rest remains vacant (must be elected by Turkish Cypriots)

&gt; Proportional: Direct election with party-list proportional representation (open list) and preferential system 

&gt; Voters first select the list of a single party (or coalition of parties or a single independent candidate) and then, within the list, can mark one preference for every four seats to be filled in their constituency. 

&gt; Seats are distributed among lists within each constituency by dividing the total number of votes cast for each list by the electoral quota (the largest remainder method using Hare quota). 

&gt; The remaining seats are distributed among the parties or coalitions of parties that won at least one seat in any constituency pursuant to the first distribution or, for single parties, *at least 1.8 per cent of all valid votes cast throughout the island* (for coalitions of 2 or more parties, the applicable figures are 10 and 20 per cent, respectively). Notwithstanding the above, 3.6 per cent of the total number of votes cast are required for lists of single parties participating in the second distribution to be entitled to a second seat.

The problem with it is that it often lead to exploitation of the unfortunate and downtrodden. The US is a good example of a state struggling between Laissez-Faire economics and implementation of a Welfare State.

Die Katastrophe ist nicht die Autonomiebewegung, sondern ein Regionalparlament dass in einer Nacht und Nebel Aktion von Spezialeinheiten eines anderen Landes besetzt wird und daraufhin die aktuelle Verwaltung aus dem Amt hebt (fast so wie das Ukrainische Parlament mit Janukowitsch übrigens - nur ohne Begründung, aber dafür während russische Soldaten überall in der Region die Kontrolle übernehmen) und den Anschluss an Russland verkündet.

&gt; Die Bevölkerung der Krim besteht zu 58 Prozent aus Russen. Einer der ersten Pläne der neuen – nicht gewählten – ukrainischen Regierung war, Russisch als zweite Amtssprache abzuschaffen. Ist es wirklich unvorstellbar, dass die Bevölkerung der Krim dies mehrheitlich als feindlichen Akt ansieht?

https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine#Sprache

------------------------------
""**Seit 1991 ist das Ukrainische die einzige offizielle Amtssprache des Landes**, obwohl große Teile der Bevölkerung fordern, Russisch wieder als zweite Amtssprache einzuführen.""

**[...]** 

""Die „Sprachenfrage“ ist in der ukrainischen Politik ein ständiges Streitthema. Die nach Russland orientierte Partei der Regionen sowie die kommunistische Partei treten für die völlige Gleichberechtigung des Russischen als zweite Amtssprache ein. Die „orangen“, westlich orientierten Parteien rund um den ehemaligen Präsidenten Juschtschenko und Julija Tymoschenko sowie nationalistische Parteien lehnen dies jedoch ab.

**Unter Wiktor Juschtschenko wurde eine aktive Ukrainisierungs-Politik betrieben, so wurde etwa das Russische in Schulen, Universitäten und im Alltag stark zurückgedrängt und zahlreiche Maßnahmen eingeführt, die den Gebrauch der ukrainischen Sprache fördern sollten. Der 2010 gewählte Präsident Janukowytsch hob jedoch zahlreiche dieser Maßnahmen wieder auf, wogegen die Opposition um Julija Tymoschenko vehement protestierte.**[19]

Janukowytsch äußerte sich aber zunächst auch gegen die Einführung des Russischen als zweite Staatssprache, da die Verhältnisse im Parlament die notwendige Änderung der ukrainischen Verfassung, für die eine Zweidrittelmehrheit erforderlich ist, bislang unmöglich machen. Zudem fürchtete Janukowytsch Proteste aus dem nationalistischen Lager.[20] Im Frühjahr **2012 griff seine Partei der Regionen die Sprachenfrage jedoch wieder auf. Trotz heftiger, zum Teil handgreiflicher Proteste der Opposition im Parlament, wurde ein Gesetz verabschiedet, wonach in einer Region, in der mindestens zehn Prozent der Bevölkerung eine andere Muttersprache haben, diese den Status einer regionalen offiziellen Sprache bekommt.[21] Damit ist Russisch künftig in 13 der 27 Regionen der Ukraine, darunter in der Hauptstadt Kiew, dem Ukrainischen gleichgestellt.**""

--------------------------------
2012, also wahrscheinlich noch keine zwei Jahre ist Russisch erst zweite Amtssprache und das überhaupt auch nur in 13 von 27 Regionen?

Der Konflikt um die Amtssprache besteht also schon über 20 Jahre und auch während der Kampagne von Wiktor Juschtschenko ([der heute noch behauptet von Russland vergiftet worden zu sein...](http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-66803948.html)) gegen die russischsprachige Bevölkerung ist die Lage auf der Krim nicht eskaliert.

Read [the assessment of Svoboda by the leader of the Association of Jewish Organisations and Communities of Ukraine](http://www.vaadua.org/news/pravozashchitnik-iosif-zisels-o-evreyah-i-svobode) (edited Google Translate):

&gt;    In practice, there are really some anti-Semitic elements in ""Svoboda"", and we monitor them more than 20 years, since the days when the party was still known as the Social-National Party of Ukraine. Anti-Semitic rhetoric is becoming less and less prevalent. For example, of the 37 deputies of the Verkhovna Rada of the party ""Svoboda"" only six or seven people in the 20 years indulged in anti-Semitic statements.

&gt;    There is nothing directly antisemitic in the program of ""Svoboda"", nothing directly xenophobic either, although there are indirect xenophobic elements in this program. From the rostrum of parliament deputies ""Svoboda"" did not say a single - stress! - a single anti-Semitic statement, unlike the deputies of the party ""Jobbik"" in Hungary or deputies of the party ""Attack"" in Bulgaria.

&gt; Unless there is a political science definition as anti-Semitic party, which may be to hang on ""Svoboda ""? ""Svoboda"" - a radical nationalist party , and I think that's the right name . It pursues a number of objectives in the struggle, and the priorities of these goals requires a separate study. For example, the government of Ukraine - one of the main goals , maybe even the most basic to the ""Svoboda"" . Russian authorities - another important goal. Homophobia - a very important goal. Migrantophobia much less important goal, as in Ukraine, this problem is not an important cultural and ideological feature of society. Communists - an important goal for the ""Svoboda"" as well as collaborators, people who cooperate with the authorities and with the ""pro-Russian authorities"" in Ukraine. And finally, the Jews, and I think that Jews control purposes of ""Svoboda"" are the last or penultimate position, and fight with the Jews - is not the goal of ""Svoboda"" as an organization, it's only the purpose of only some members of the ""Svoboda"". ""Svoboda"" is not a homogeneous party, it is not stable stable party, and we take this into account. I largely distance myself from the ""Svoboda"".

If I remember right, L'As du Falafel is the best known place that will have the long lines out the door, and one place a few doors down is about as good but quieter. Most people do take-out, but at least one of the two has a sit-down space with table service as well.

You can get a vegetarian tagine in almost any North African restaurant and many are pretty good. (I don't have a specific favorite. I went to Chez Bébert at Porte Maillot a few times and it's fine but not remarkable--just look at LaFourchette or TripAdvisor for one in the neighborhood you want.)

Some of the better crêpes places have huge menus of savory crêpes. One of the best known, and one I liked a lot is Crêperie Josselin (67 rue du Montparnasse -- note NOT Boulevard de Montparnasse) - very traditional crêperie where crêpes become a full meal. Cool old fashioned decor. Many, many choices for both savory and sweet crêpes. Great for lunch. No reservations taken. There's usually a line outside but it moves pretty fast. Be sure to have sparkling cider. (I prefer ""brut"" (dry) over ""doux"" (sweet).)

Two places I meant to try but did not get to:

Of course not, and yet he used the term and it's clear what he means. 

&gt; There is a full-on massive investigation going on right now involving doctors, attorney general and multiple police and SSU investigative teams. 

This should be an investigation by an independent organisation such as OSCE. There's no way in hell Prosecutor General Oleh Makhnitskyi would ever announce investigation results that incriminate those in power today. 

&gt; ""OMG it's been 5 minutes and no investigation"" is not even a valid concern, much less anything approaching evidence. It's truly unfortunate that you think any of this amounts to evidence.

First of all the hypothesis is a very plausible one. It is known that [extreme right members](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25826238) did participate in the protest and pushed for them to become violent. 

While these groups incited violence, Yanukovych on the other hand had no interest in escalating the situation further. (Not to mention even if he wanted to, at the very least he wouldn't be shooting his own policemen since he can just order them to be violent, so at least those shots came from elsewhere). 

The proofs were not just that the investigation hadn't started. They claimed they were refusing to investigate, which is different. And that was just one point against many. As he said, that hypothesis was becoming more and more evident. It's weird that he'd be so specific and taking seriously something completely baseless. 
 

&gt; but you say you're pro-EU so it's quite puzzling.

Well as events were unfolding, I was dumbfounded by how the EU was acting, and guessing it would turn to shit with Crimea and other regions going ape shit. I didn't predict an invasion of Crimea but didn't surprise me either. 

Since I hold  a decent amount of stocks in the EU I have all interest that they handle this situation well, and throughout I was rather disappointed. 
They had to be extremely critical of both Yanukovych and opposition. They did voice some concerns, e.g. when they started passing laws affecting many Russian citizens, but they were way to light on them.  
You could tell it was not going to end well. 
&gt; &gt; I'm sure Russia will also be quick to legitimize Crimea's secession.

Exactly, point being that claims that ""what matters is whether it gets legitimized later on, and how soon"" is rather shortsighted. People are quick to quickly legitimise whatever is convenient for them.

:D yeah right, have another opinion and suddenly you are on the ""Russian nationalistic"" side...

Look, I see every fucking day Russians, I was visiting USSR before you have born, my country has a huge border with Russia etc. etc.

Media in ""west"" has forgotten happily everything what has lead to this situation. But internet wouldn't.
