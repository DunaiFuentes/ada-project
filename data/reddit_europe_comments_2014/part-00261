true,Jaquestrap,UNSA,United States of America,"They didn't actually have to be on Polish soil to help. Had the British and French actually launched any kind of attacks on Germany they would have met remarkable success, as the Germans had left essentially the barest military screen on their Western borders and most German generals were convinced the war would end quickly as the French and British would attack from the West and sweep through into the heartland of Germany. Germany had also yet to reach it's military potential in 1939, hell the Poles managed to hold them off for over a month. Instead, France and the UK sat at their lines and waited for the Germans to attack a year later. 

And the ""betrayal"" not only stems from the inaction in 1939, but the way that Poland was sold to the USSR later in the war, before Russian troops had yet to set foot on Polish soil. Granted this was *more* on the part of Roosevelt, however the British failed to uphold their guarantees to Poland to protect the sovereignty of it's borders. Had it just been one of the two ""betrayals"", maybe that would be understandable, but twice the Poles were betrayed. And as frozenbananarama pointed out, Poles were then deported back to Communist Poland, then trivialized and made out to be nuisances for speaking out against the USSR, and given very little recognition for the part that Polish soldiers played throughout the War, both in the East and the West (for example, there were more Polish troops deployed in the Western theaters than Canadian, and they *regularly* were deployed into high-intensity conflicts with excellent results).",0,1409927216,null,0,1409942031,0,ck9wgo2,t3_2fjgyv,t1_ck9wgo2,t1_ck9vbvy,null,1427184505,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

On page 6 of the pdf(numbered as 3) there's a table describing how many percent of people described their attitude as ""sympathetic"". On page 7 the table contains percentages of people who over the years expressed their negative attitude towards the given nations.

The page 10 contains chart showing change in attitude compared to the last years' polls.

The researchers found a strong positive correlation between the education level and number of countries the person sees as positive(tertiary education ~15.5 positive countries, primary education 9.1 positive countries). The same trend, however, was not observed when it came to the number of countries seen as negative.

Household income per capita was also a strong factor. Compared to others, people who earn less than 750PLN a month see more countries as negative.

Age is also one of the factors which correlate, this time negatively, with the number of liked countries(14.5 for people 25-34 years-old, 9.6 for people over 65 years-old). Older people on the other hand are less likely to see countries negatively(6.3 for people over 65 compared to 10.5 for people 18-25 years-old)

Residents of cities were found to like other countries more than the average Pole, while residents of villages tend to dislike other countries more than the average Pole.

People who take part in religious ceremonies tend to like less people than people who don't take part in them at all(10.6 compared to 13.9).",0,1409927813,null,0,false,0,ck9wqks,t3_2fjrlr,t1_ck9wqks,t3_2fjrlr,null,1427184377,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

He doesn't want swedish-kurdish people to go fight ISIS (not clearly at least).

I think Sweden should act neutral (ie not join NATO), in most conflicts, however, global threats like Russian and ISIS needs to be nipped in the bud and requires a strong response. Taking a stand against facism and dictators is not the same thing as ""not being neutral"". Sweden should be a force for good and support the factions that encourage freedom and fairness. Both Russia and ISIS are the opposite of this.

To me, Löfvens  statements shows he lacks a spine, which is needed as a head of state in discussions with Russians. If the social democrats really wanted what they say they do, for everyone, helping in these conflicts should be top of their priority.

Ho capito la domanda in una seconda rilettura... ma avevo già scritto questi giochi e te li lascio... possono servire come filler =)

Giochi di dadi:

* Perudo
* Yahtzee
* Tokyo: bastano 2 dadi da 6, Le regole le trovi tranquillamente anche su wikipedia e ti diverti per un pò... la fortuna coi dadi viene compensata con il bluff.

Giochi di guerra (risko-like) con tiro di dadi:

Solitamente io evito giochi con troppa componente aleatoria quindi non sono espertissimo... ma dato che ho ""studiato"" il settore un mese fa per un regalo ad un appassionato di risiko ti cito: 

* Futurisiko (ci ho fatto 4-5 partite, non male... lo preferisco al classico)
* Risk Legacy (sembra sia il migliore della saga Risk, non ci ho mai giocato. Solo in inglese)
* Il trono di spade (2° edizione) - Ripeto, almeno 3 ore di gioco ma ne vale la pena... soprattutto se sei un fan della serie. Nelle regole opzionali si possono usare delle carte presenti nella scatola che rendolo il gioco + variabile e meno ""calcolato"".
* Civilization - Questo è stato il regalo al mio amico (assieme a il trono di spade). Non l'ho ancora giocato e sto aspettando una recensione da parte sua. Ma anche qui metti in conto almeno 3 ore a partita
* Coloni di Catan - anche a questo non ci ho mai giocato ma me ne hanno parlato piuttosto bene.

Se hai bisogno di altre info chiedi pure. Se specifichi quanti giocatori siete e che tipo di giocatori (hardcore gamer o casual gamer) provo a darti qualche titolo in più.

&gt;The __nothing to hide argument__ is an argument which states that government [data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining) and [surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance) programs do not threaten privacy unless they uncover illegal activities, and that if they do uncover illegal activities, the person committing these activities does not have the right to keep them private. Hence, a person who favors this argument may state ""I've got nothing to hide"" and therefore do not express opposition to government data mining and surveillance.  An individual using this argument may say that a person should not have worries about government data mining or surveillance if he/she has ""nothing to hide.""

true,Jaquestrap,UNSA,United States of America,"The French and British had over 100 divisions sitting on the border with Germany in September of 1939. The Germans had left around 20 on their Western border. Most German generals agreed that had France and Britain launched a concentrated attack within 3 days of war being declared (as was outlined in their military alliance with Poland) then Germany would have been unable to hold out for more than 2 weeks. In fact French/British military doctrine at the time had been outlined for launching full-scale assaults into German territory, it's a myth that France's military doctrine exclusively called for sitting on the Maginot Line, that was only in the case of a German attack against France. 

Nobody expected France and Britain to ship troops over to Poland to fight against the Germans there. However the plan had been for Britain and France to swiftly and powerfully attack Germany from the West, with Poland simply holding out against German invasion for the few weeks necessary for their Allies to bring about a decisive victory against the Germans from the West. Poland managed to hold out for over a month, not only against the Germans but also against the Soviet invasion that it was unprepared for--this was well above the expected couple of weeks that French/Polish/British command had planned for. That would have given the Western forces plenty of time to either decisively defeat the mediocre German troops stationed in the West (not only were there relatively few German troops stationed there, they were also among the worst-equipped and lowest quality divisions in the German army, positioned there only to act as a military screen to dissuade what was thought to be an inevitable attack through evasive actions and feints), or at least put Germany under sufficient pressure to cease it's invasion of Poland and call for peace. Chances are had Germany quickly been brought out of the conflict with Poland, the USSR would have hesitated in moving into Polish territory, as Stalin had delayed Soviet involvement in Poland until September 17th (the Germans launched the invasion on September 1st) specifically in order to gauge the situation, both the level of German success against Polish troops and what the West's reaction would be to the German invasion. Had Germany pulled out of Poland (particularly prior to the 17th, which would have been very likely given a full-scale invasion from the West), the USSR would have likely felt it too risky to invade, at least at the time. Soviet troops in 1939 were relatively poor, as was seen in their poor performance against Finnish forces in the Winter War, and as was further highlighted in their horrendous destruction in the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa, performing far worse against the German military than Polish troops did in the September campaign.

In 1939, France had the most powerful military in the world. It was Germany that needed more time to finish rearmament and organize, hell German rearmament plans had stipulated that Germany wouldn't be ready for war against the West or the USSR until 1941--they went into Poland relatively unprepared. However by 1940, the quick pace of German rearmament had pretty much brought Germany's military up to par with that of the French (and Britain's expeditionary forces) and enabled it to launch the invasion of France.

This submission has been removed as per rule six. 

&gt;This is a moderated forum, to maintain a civil environment, and a *high level of debate*. We reserve the right to actively moderate the subreddit as is reasonable, to achieve those aims.

Emphasis adding by myself, to illustrate the relevant section. We're accepting of a very wide range of content here, but it is felt that this sort of content is infectious to large subreddits (which /r/europe is very quickly becoming) and we can't allow low quality, instant gratification content like this to prosper in /r/europe without the quality of discussion here nose diving. We want people to be able to come here and enjoy themselves, but also to be able to have discussion about serious topics and it is felt that a stand must be taken against low quality, instant gratification content so as to ensure this does not become like /r/adviceanimals or /r/gaming. We are very proud of the high levels of discussion found here, and it is felt that image macros and purely humorous content, which is not even satirical, would drown this out. 

Thank you for your understanding.

Instead they sat there, naval warfare or no, and let the Germans invade Poland almost completely unmolested by Poland's Allies from the West.

You make it all seem so simple and obvious, which shows a grave lack of historical context. In 1939 the Germans had the most powerful army in Europe. The French and British still remembered WW1; and they assumed that a strong push would be atrocious and could not be done unless there was a ready reserve of of men in the rear to support the vanguard and defend from a German counter attack.

I could also say that had Poland spent more money and effort in creating a formidable fighting force they could have held out long enough for the British and French to prepare and launch an offensive. So Poland was stupid for not having done this. But this would be speaking with hindsight and ignoring historical nuance and would make me seem very silly.

true,_lmp_,POLA,Poland,"It's not supposed to fight the entire Russian army. Three points:


1) Soldiers are also citizens, any attack on a NATO force would result in much greater problems for politicians trying to backtrack on a guarantee. 
I think what people in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania fear is that Russia could reach the coast of the Baltic, or carve out a corridor to Kaliningrad, within a couple of days and it would be hard for many politicians in the West to launch an invasion to liberate those countries. Essentially Kremlin would be presenting everyone with ""new facts on the ground"". If Russians have to kill or capture a few thousand UK/French/German/etc. soldiers in the process, it raises the stakes. Also it ensures that an invasion won't be bloodless on the Russian side. 

2) It's a rapid reaction force intended to counter deployment by Russian rapid reaction forces. In general, launching a mass invasion (think multiple divisions, tens of thousands of soldiers, thousand of armoured vehicles, hundreds of aircraft) takes time. You have to move units from other areas of Russia. When troop movements are significant, they are really hard to hide from satellite surveillance. 5 Russian divisions sitting on the border would not be unnoticed giving NATO time to move more troops.  

3) what the Russians could theoretically do is use airborne units, like those stationed in Pskov and Ivanovo to launch a surprise attack, the only way that Russia could achieve strategic surprise is if they attack with a smaller, more mobile force. Rapid NATO deployment is supposed to counter that, not fight the Great Patriotic War Part 3.

true,elrohir_ancalin,null,null,"&gt; &gt;The example of Spain being owned by all spaniards is not true, if it were Catalunya wouldn't pay the extortionate amount of tax that it pays to the government.
    
&gt;But Catalonia doesn't pay any tax to the government, the individual catalonians do. Wealthier regions have more wealthy individuals, who pay more tax. But there is no special tax you pay for being catalonian.

This is a very important remark! In fact, in a federal country like US states DO have separate taxes for state and federal government. In Texas you hardly pay taxes and get benefits and in Massachusets you pay and get almost as in a northern European country.

Now, *after* paying the same percentage in taxes, the government distributes these. It is in this area where Catalonian claims have a lot of legitimacy: they do not receive a share on investment as big as their share on the contribution. So, the easy problem ""does Catalonia pay more?"" clear now, we must enter the more fuzzy area of ""where does government money go, and is it well invested there?""

&gt; I understand why that is, Catalunya is one of the wealthiest parts of Spain and needs to help support poorer parts like Extremadura, fine!

OK so you think that ""redistribution"" is fine. This is not even as common an agreement as you may think. Many people, specially those with a typical ""poverty is the poor's fault"" republican mentality, would opose to this.

&gt; But the problem arises when I notice certain benefits other parts of Spain get that the Catalans don't (one example is school books, Andaluzia get their books paid for by the state, Catalunya doesn't;

The government and the autonomous communities have a percentage of the budget and completely separate ""duties"" (70%-30% I think). If you have a problem with education, health, airports, etc... go ask the Generalitat why they don't pay the books. The central government puts its money in things like Policía Nacional, the Armed Forces, etc...

&gt; Example 2 motorways, you have to pay for them in Catalunya, something free in most other parts of Spain).

This is blatantly false. For example the Rande bridge in Vigo is, in cent/Km, the most expensive toll in all the EU.

&gt; Catalunya's fate should be in the hands of the citizens of Catalunya, not in the hands of lawyers and not even in the hands of politicians.

This is plainly demagogic. Laws must be written with guidance of experts in law-writing with the proper training. Of course people MUST vote their opinion but there are many menial tasks in creating law and you need professional writters for these tasks.

&gt; Saying it's unconstitucional is a cheap excuse to not allow people a proper democracy.

I'm not saying ""its uncostitucional so don't do it"", so don't accuse me of the same cheap narrative Rajoy uses. 

All I am saying is: As of today, the constitution says the army should go to Catalonia if they try to separate. Like, any lunatic could SUE the government into it if they don't want to. 

Any half-brained person would agree that it is better to change the constitution to allow Catalonia to vote, than letting them vote in a ""technically illegal"" way and paving the way for some crazy-ass Franco II to rally up the army and screw us all.

&gt; I have been brought up in Catalunya and no, I'm not a supporter of catalan independence (as in i will vote for federalism), I am a strong supporter of the peoples right to decide what happens to them and their land!

This is what I was referring too. See, the problem with primary legal documents such as constitutions is that there is no superior authority, they are documents that define themselves. In the current law, even if we don't like it we are in a sort of ""matrimonio sin separación de bienes"": the land of catalonia is as mine as yours and the bridge of Rande is as yours as mine. Birthplace doesn't mean anything in internal sovereign-land disputes!

This is why I insist so much into this ""separacion de bienes"" constitutional reform: we must write down what the frak means to be Galician or Catalonian (born? empadronado? having main residence as of January 1st 2014?), and what the frak means Catalonian sovereign land (The current region? Any council that volunteers? What do you do if you choose the later and some counciles in the middle choose 'no' and become an enclave? Do you force them to change? What do you do with the rights on the Ebro water, etc?). All this shit must be writen in unambiguous, precise terms (i.e. more lawyers) before the separation. Not because I want to, not because you want to, but only because if we don't then the vulture funds from all around the world are gonna come at us both and sue the shit out of us for any ambiguous comma we leave behind. 

And finaly, when we have given separate IDs to each Catalonian and written a separation procedure with a ton of small print. Then, and only then, the Catalonians read it and answer [yes/no]?

Everyone was too exhausted from the past 6 years of devastating war, and who knows how that conflict would have turned out. In the best case scenario it would still have resulted in millions of more lives lost--the Red Army in 1945 was the most powerful military force the world had ever seen, the only thing they lacked was nuclear weapons, and the United States only had a few to speak of at the time. Not to say that the US would have necessarily lost, given it's relatively untouched manpower and overwhelming industrial might, but the Soviet forces could have just as well defeated their less experienced Western counterparts (the vanguard of the Red Army in 1945 was *incredibly* experienced, very well armed, very well-led, determined, used to a brutal level of conflict that Western troops hadn't experienced, and *huge*) and pushed further into the West, creating a much more protracted conflict. I do think however much more pressure should have been put on the Soviets, more support should have been given to independent elements in Poland and Eastern Europe, and the *threat* of military action should have been used to dissuade Soviet land/power grabs in Eastern Europe. However suddenly turning around and engaging Soviet troops would have been foolhardy. Even if the negotiations failed, at least history would know that the West had done everything they could to help save Europe from tyranny short of starting a potentially more devastating conflict.

Also, it's unrealistic to expect the West to have instantly started an offensive against the USSR. The Western powers were not dictatorships, they were and are democracies, and the people of those countries would not have suddenly acquiesced to fighting a nation that had up to that point been their valuable Allies who did the brunt of the fighting against the Nazi forces.

Really? What did Russia have that stood up to the P51 Mustang or the M26 Pershing? Or the M46 that came after?

They wiped the floor with the T34s.

Furthermore, you are glossing over the Navy far too much. The 'Pacific naval power' was the 'world naval power' after the conclusion of WW2 and Russia had absolutely nothing that could remotely compare.

That 'pacific naval power' would be in the North Atlantic within 3 months completely wrecking anything the Russians could have done in western europe.

Again, you're falling into the modern thought-trap of thinking Russia was just this massive badass. Russia won the eastern front because of conscripts and the fact that germany was split and made a foolish invasion in the winter that cost them a lot of troops.

No, this was the established plan of operations that British, French, and Polish military command had developed in the months leading up to the conflict, based on significant levels of espionage, strategic discussion and development, troop training, armament, and even troop deployment. The Western forces *were deployed to follow this exact plan, this was actually all outlined in the military treaties and agreements the French and British had made with Poland in the years and months leading up to the war.* No hindsight, the British and French simply *did not follow through on their plans and very detailed promises.* They didn't just promise to declare war, they actually laid out exactly what they would do and then did not do it--hence why most military historians agree that this was a betrayal.

&gt; In 1939 the Germans had the most powerful army in Europe.

No they did not. Look at the levels of rearmament during the 30's and WWII, try reading actual books about this. In 1939 the French army not only outnumbered the German army, it was also better equipped and better supplied. The rearmament rate of the German military was rapid, however it had yet to surpass the men, material, tanks, artillery, and aircraft of the Western forces in 1939--it wouldn't surpass their levels for another year. German rearmament wasn't even going to be complete by the standards that German generals had requested for a potential conflict with France and Britain until *1941*. Even at the time of the Invasion of France in 1940, the French and British militaries in France outnumbered and outgunned that of Germany's military, 144 divisions to Germany's 141, only being surpassed in the number of military aircraft.

&gt; they assumed that a strong push would be atrocious and could not be done unless there was a ready reserve of men in the rear to support the vanguard and defend from a German counter attack.

You should look up what British, French, and German generals had to say at the time. Many Western officers called for immediate attacks on Germany due to the paltry German forces deployed against them and the overwhelming military advantage of the Western troops at the time. German generals decried the Polish invasion as a folly because they knew that should the British and French attack from the West, Germany would collapse *in a matter of weeks*, with about 20 weak divisions deployed on the West facing over 100 well-armed French and British divisions. **There was no capacity for Germany to launch a counter attack, it's forces were deployed in an evasive military screen in the West and almost all of its powerful offensive armies, Panzer divisions, etc were deployed in the fight against Poland. The troops stationed in the West were only capable of mediocre holding actions, hell the entire fucking invasion was literally just a gamble by Hitler who assumed the British and French wouldn't even declare war on Germany given their prior behavior.**

&gt; I could also say that had Poland spent more money and effort in creating a formidable fighting force they could have held out long enough for the British and French to prepare and launch an offensive.

The order of operations as outlined by the Allies had been for Poland to hold out for only two weeks against a German invasion, giving the Western troops plenty of time to launch their attack from their prepared positions, which the Western militaries had decided would require only *three days after a German invasion of Poland* to prepare. The Polish forces held out for *over a month* against not only the German military, but an invasion from the East by Soviet forces as well. Not only did the British and French have more time than they had planned for in order to launch attacks on Germany, they failed to do anything more than two small raids against the German forces. During the invasion of Poland, the German military met *far* more resistance than expected and lost several major engagements, taking significant casualties and getting bogged down in a conflict that lasted a month. The Western troops were already deployed at the border with Germany, once deployed it should have taken less than a week to launch the *already planned and prepared* operations into German territory. Nothing happened because British and French political leaders twiddled their thumbs and didn't want to get involved in a conflict that wasn't affecting them. That is not an excuse, that is a betrayal.

&gt; Poland was stupid for not having done this.

Poland *had* rearmed, and very efficiently at that. Given it's devastated economy, it being a relatively young nation, it's lack of military infrastructure, Poland had done a remarkable job of preparing it's military. It did not have the industrialized economy of Germany or the West, yet despite that Polish troops held out against an invasion on two fronts for *over a month*, with no natural barriers to aid them (Poland lies in the center of the European plain, it's virtually entirely flat) against forces that outnumbered them. To compare, the French and British capitulated in roughly the same amount of time **(Poland held out for 1 month and 5 days, France held out for 1 month and 12 days)** against a one-front attack, with far larger and better equipped militaries, better infrastructure, and virtually every single greater advantage than the Poles had (hell they didn't even have to conquer half of Poland's territory, the Soviets took the eastern half of Poland). The Germans had gotten plenty of practice against the Poles in fighting a rapid conquest, and got the advantage of being on the attack against the Western troops in 1940, along with having had plenty of extra time to continue rapid rearmament and match the Western forces militarily--time that the British and French had happily given them between 1939 and 1940. Poland spent all of the money it could on preparing it's military, there was no way it could have been better prepared *which is why it made an alliance with Britain and France.*

&gt; how about we avoid armchair genius and think that maybe the Generals of France and Britain who had spent a lifetime practicing the art of war...

Yeah, how about we let them decide. Oh wait, those same Generals had *actively called for invasion of Germany in 1939, an invasion they were prepared for and knew they could win. Go read about it.* It wasn't the French and British militaries that betrayed Poland--they were not responsible for the betrayal. It was the French and British politicians that refused to allow their militaries to carry out what had been planned and promised. They forced the Western militaries to sit on their hands and watch as everything went to shit. This isn't ""armchair general"" logic, I didn't come up with any of this. This is the knowledge I have accrued from actively studying the political and military history of WWII, and isn't an outlying opinion so much as it's generally accepted knowledge based off of professional historical study of the facts; recorded statements and communications from Allied and German generals, statistical data regarding the number of troops and armaments in the various armies, statements from politicians, recorded troop deployments, drawn up military plans, etc. 

But the most effective argument is this: Britain and France made a military alliance with Poland, *and in writing*, specified that they would launch an invasion of Germany within 3 days of Germany invading Poland, given that Poland would be able to hold out for at least two weeks (again, they held out for over a month). This was agreed upon, planned, prepared, situated, and understood by all parties. Then when it was game-time, the British and French *did not do this*, failed to hold up their end of the bargain, and stood back as Poland was subject to one of the most brutal invasions and occupations in history. Make any argument you want to try to justify their actions, **if Britain and France weren't going to follow through and invade Germany as promised then they shouldn't have signed a military alliance with Poland and made those promises.** Maybe then Poland could have tried to find some other avenue and done something else to help ensure it's sovereignty and existence. If I sign a business contract with someone telling them that I will pick them up at the airport when their plane lands, and then *of my own free will, consciously never go to pick that person up*, then I am wrong, pure and simple. That is a betrayal, and there is literally no way to debate that point--it was formally agreed upon by all parties.

You're the one spouting off uneducated nonsense because you haven't actually looked into the subject sufficiently, and as a result fall back on the pseudo-historical habit of careful justification. Just because oftentimes when studying history it's safer to assume that things would have likely inevitably played out the same way no matter what, doesn't mean that when there is a plethora of information on the subject we cannot deduce that in certain situations, incredible mistakes were made and tragic events occurred because of them. It's widely acknowledged by most military historians that the British and French had a golden opportunity to nip the war in the bud in 1939, and failed to do so out of short-sighted self interest. If you like I can reference you a number of works by different historians so you can do the readings yourself.

I'm not some biased anti-Western idiot who ignores reality and runs around claiming that Poland could have been saved, I am a historian first and foremost and I wouldn't be arguing this point if it wasn't something I haven't gone into depth studying. There are countless other subjects regarding Polish history that would come off as negative, where I just as firmly would and have opposed people with a pro-Polish argument because it's simply historically accurate to do so. While Poland was overall incredibly admirable during WWII, it wasn't a pure shining angel--it readily jumped into the fall of Czechoslovakia to grab territory, and during the inter-war years did it's fair share of oppression against Ukrainian minorities and self-determination movements in the East. But what I'm arguing here is something that I've done a *lot* of reading and research on, and not only from Polish sources (in fact those make up a small minority of the sources I've read). When it comes to history I'm a historian first and foremost and I follow the facts and views that have the most support, I do not follow bias. But in this case, the facts, the research, the study have all lined up to support this argument, and in this case it readily supports the Polish claims.",0,1409935731,null,0,1409937502,0,cka0p6t,t3_2fjgyv,t1_cka0p6t,t1_ck9z6t9,null,1427182490,24,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,24

true,Jaquestrap,UNSA,United States of America,"It was very obvious actually--the plans had already been drawn up, developed, and *prepared for action* months before and leading up to the conflict, based on significant levels of espionage, strategic planning, professional evaluation, etc. They were prepared for war, there were dozens of divisions literally stationed right on the border with Germany in September of 1939 that had long ago prepared for planned attacks on German positions, with dozens more waiting in reserve--over 100 Western divisions total facing just over 20 German divisions of poor quality that were only deployed there to act as a screen. Even German generals at the time readily admitted that should the British and French launch a counter-invasion of Germany during Germany's invasion of Poland, it would have only taken about *two weeks* for Germany to be handily defeated. After breaking through an incredibly weak German ""line"" (more like a threadbare screen) the Allied troops would have faced virtually open ground. French and British Generals protested the orders to stand down, and called on their political superiors to launch attacks against Germany as per the well-prepared plans and *written promises to the Polish government.* It was actually pretty damn obvious, and historical research shows that the only reason it didn't happen was that French and British politicians were happy to shirk their duties and continue avoiding full confrontation with Germany so long as it didn't affect them--why fight for Poland and have to make sacrifices when it's obvious that Germany wouldn't dare launch a full-scale attack on France? It was an incredibly short-sighted and selfish move that not only served to betray the Poles (they literally failed their written obligation to launch an assault on Germany within 3 days of a German attack on Poland--an assault that was planned out and prepared for well in advance) but ultimately betrayed themselves and the rest of Europe by not confronting an evil until that evil finally confronted them--resulting in years of devastating conflict, tyranny, and the loss of millions of lives.

[I get further in depth on the subject here. This isn't my own ""armchair general"" speculation, this is me straight up just relaying what you yourself can read that has been researched and written about by many respected military historians--this is generally regarded as a correct assessment of the situation in 1939 by the scholarly military-history community, not just pro-Polish rhetoric.](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fjgyv/with_headquarters_in_poland_the_united_kingdom/ck9ytll)

I'm not some biased anti-Western idiot who ignores reality and runs around claiming that Poland could have been saved, I am a historian first and foremost and I wouldn't be arguing this point if it wasn't something I haven't gone into depth studying. There are countless other subjects regarding Polish history that would come off as negative, where I just as firmly would and have opposed people with a pro-Polish argument because it's simply historically accurate to do so. While Poland was overall incredibly admirable during WWII, it wasn't a pure shining angel--it readily jumped into the fall of Czechoslovakia to grab territory, and during the inter-war years did it's fair share of oppression against Ukrainian minorities and self-determination movements in the East. But what I'm arguing here is something that I've done a *lot* of reading and research on, and not only from Polish sources (in fact those make up a small minority of the sources I've read). Like I said, when it comes to history I'm a historian first and foremost and I follow the facts and views that have the most support, I do not follow bias.

On the contrary, not only is it possible, it's actually very common. Most people in low-level security prisons in Berlin are there for fare dodging. As you say (and as I point out later in my post), this only actually happens to serial offenders, but it does happen, and it's very common.

Debtor's prison has nothing to do with it; you're not being sent to prison for being in debt: if you are taken to court you are actually charged with an offence (""Erschleichen einer Dienstleistung"") and then fined. This is now a punitive fine, not a charge for using the public transport without a valid ticket. If you are unable to pay, you can (and this regularly happens) be sentenced to a term in prison, which is calculated on the basis of how high the fine is and how much you can be expected to earn in one day (this is called a ""Tagessatz"" and can be between €1 and €30,000). You can be sentenced to anything between 5 and 360 ""Tagessätze"" (sometimes more). All this is regulated in § 40 StGB, which is legal fact and common practice. If you ever read in the papers of somebody being sentenced to 56 ""Tagessätze"" at €371 each, it's always in lieu of a fine.

And believe it or not, Berlin's prisons are full of fare dodgers. There are calls to end this practice for Berlin's fare dodgers, at it costs the taxpayer and patently isn't working, but the powers that be defend it on the grounds that it is a deterrant. In practice, for various reasons, most fare dodgers manage to escape going to prison, but those who are unlucky enough to get caught are typically shown no mercy at all.",0,1409937521,null,0,false,0,cka1mh8,t3_2fjbp4,t1_cka1mh8,t1_ck9tfxi,null,1427182007,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

Thanks for your reply, but I know lots of people who make minimum wage or only make about 1200-1500 lei a month, so you don't know the whole situation. You've clearly worked with people that were lucky enough to make 2000 euros a month, that's an incredibly big salary here in Romania (a couple of euros bigger than the President's actually) where most old people have to wait freezing their ass off till the government turns on heating during winter because they can't afford to buy a real heating system that runs on gas and electricity. IT has zero unemployment and it pays a lot but unfortunately STEM isn't for everyone and not everyone can work as a programmer or as an engineer.

Jobs here, especially one in the public sector are very hard to get because of corruption, you and your colleagues were lucky enough to find a great paying job in the private sector probably but such a high paying job is very hard to get even in richer cities like Bucharest. To get a job in the public sector that requires some sort of written test and interview is almost impossible to get unless you know certain people.

40% of Romania is still rural and very poor, my grandfather had a pension that was only a few hundreds lei big and he worked hard all his life in factories and on the field. My grandparents relied on their animals and crops for food, mostly, and only used money to pay the bills and sometimes buy beer, sweets and vegetables that they couldn't grow, their entire village was like that and it wasn't such a poor village considering there are still areas in Romania that don't have access to electricity either. My grandparents' village didn't even have a sewage system or gas, they relied on fountains, wood and gas tanks to survive.  Besides for a TV and a couple of light bulbs they were almost living like during the medieval times. Such a thing is unheard of in America, England, France and other developed countries. Looking at forum and reddit posts most people haven't even seen a cow in real life, but here in Romania 40% of the population have to rely on farm animals to survive. 

&gt;And fucking hell stop looking to the government for help. Politicians from any country won't help you. The best you can hope is that they stay out of your way. Fuck minimum wage. Your goal in life isn't to earn that. If you push on that you'll end up with a country full of chavs like the UK. 

True dat but I don't want to live in a welfare state but I don't want to be negatively affected by the government either. It's stupid that I have to go to a private hospital to get treated because they're far better equipped and I don't have to bribe anyone. It's stupid that everything besides rent is as expensive or more expensive than in a much richer country like the UK. I don't care about beer being cheaper when I have to pay 300$ for a phone that's costs the same in the UK or costs 150$ in America or a car being slightly cheaper despite Romanians making on average a lot less than 80% of what westerners (or even some other Eastern European countries like Poland or Hungary) are making. It's silly because this country has lots of potential in tourism, agriculture, industry and we have mountains, access to water and we're also in a great geographical position but corruption manages to ruin everything.


&gt;and you're in the european union. If that's not opportunity I don't know what is. There's no border between you and the rest of europe so use that! Some of your countrymen know that and their ventures are taking over europe.

 I'll probably move to England (despite censorship and lack of privacy) or another Nordic country after I brush up my English. Looking at old people and how they live here doesn't encourage me to spend my entire life in Romania contributing to it in any way. 

I like this country, its history and its nature but a handful of people managed to ruin it.

In regards to dropping a nuke on Moscow in the 40s, that would have been pretty much impossible prior to the advent of nuclear missiles. For a bomber to reach Moscow from Allied territory would have required it to fly over *hundreds* of miles of enemy territory, full of anti-air and enemy aircraft--it would be essentially guaranteed that this bomber wouldn't have made it 30 miles into Soviet territory, let alone be assured that it could fly all the way to Moscow (check out a map, it's really far away from Western Europe) and have enough gas to make it back, not run into mechanical issues, and somehow manage to avoid being brought down during the hours of flying over heavily armed hostile territory. Also, the time frame you outlined (1949/1950) would have been much too late as the Soviets had developed their own nuclear bomb in 1949.

No, there's only one : ""China"". The day China stop covering their arse, NK will cease to exist within weeks. China is stable and nobody wants to bother them, this is all.

&gt; I don't know what you're referring to.

Then maybe you should learn why your country handed those over back : Nobody trust eastern europe with those. Long story short, allegedly there's a rumor the russians lost some mass destruction weapons at the end of the cold war, and that the totally not corrupt transinistrian gov tried to sell some to the highest bidder to make some quick bucks.

I know most of the high level gov was cleansed in Ukraine, but you really want to take that risk with people like pushilin's or avakov's buddies everywhere ? honestly ? While even part of the generals are under investigation for being moles and giving their ammo piles to the russians ?

&gt; It's even feasible to do so in secret if some kind of a behind-the-scenes understanding with the US is reached.

Sweet, more ""let's murder millions upon millions in a split second"" buttons and ""let's end the world"" button floating everywhere around in a war zone. What could possibly go wrong.

After tchernobyl i'd thought you'd know how bad it is. Let me refresh your memory about the smallest of small tactical devices : http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/hiroshima-2f.jpg

And what happens when one of your leaders decide he has enough and use it on luhansk ? Or Rostov ?

Oh, and if there was one day a picture of what it would look like after a big mass destruction weapon exchange with a nuclear power, it would probably look like this  : http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/msss/00719/mcam/0719MR0030550060402769E01_DXXX.jpg

Tell me, do the end justify the means ?

If the US make that kind of retarded deal i hope at least it will be THEIR weapon on loan under THEIR guard without selling the technology or building new ones. At least their own men won't try to pawn it away.

How do you foresee that happening. Certainly not militarily, that's unthinkable. Economically - maybe.

&gt;Then maybe you should learn why your country handed those over back : Nobody trust eastern europe with those. Long story short, allegedly there's a rumor the russians lost some mass destruction weapons at the end of the cold war, and that the totally not corrupt transinistrian gov tried to sell some to the highest bidder to make some quick bucks.

Well, I'm not from Transnistria and frankly I don't much care whether ""nobody trust eastern Europe"" with nukes. We don't actually need anything from anyone to proceed on that front. We have the factories to manufacture the payload and delivery mechanisms, and nuclear plants that can easily be converted to produce the material.

&gt;I know most of the high level gov was cleansed in Ukraine, but you really want to take that risk with people like pushilin's or avakov's buddies everywhere ? honestly ? While even part of the generals are under investigation for being moles and giving their ammo piles to the russians ?

If the alternative is Ukraine ceasing to exist because it has resolute enemies and spineless friends, then yes absolutely I want to take that risk.

&gt;Sweet, more ""let's murder millions upon millions in a split second"" buttons and ""let's end the world"" button floating everywhere around in a war zone. What could possibly go wrong.

Saved millions of lives so far, as I said. All those millions of Indians and Pakistanis that are alive today thanks to the nukes that are stopping their gov't from going beserk. But they'd be incinerated with conventional bombs so that's way different, I guess.

&gt;And what happens when one of your leaders decide he has enough and use it on luhansk ? Or Rostov ?

I'll let you in on a little secret: no one gets nukes to use them.

&gt;If the US make that kind of retarded deal i hope at least it will be THEIR weapon on loan under THEIR guard without selling the technology or building new ones. At least their own men won't try to pawn it away.

Many people are afraid that a federation would mean the death of their culture and heritage.

And as i said countries would still exist as entities inside the federations ( some suggest breaking them up into regions to avoid larger countries dominating.

Precisely. And each one of those times after several hundred soldiers died, generals and politicians got together and decided to stop hostilities before a conflict progresses too far and nukes have to be used.

&gt;The entire donbas war is what ? 20-30 000 dead ? That's horrible. I agree. I totally agree.
&gt;Now imagine kiev + karkhov + odessa + Mariupol cease to exist. How many people would go missing ? And i speak only about tactical use there.

Yes, that's the situation now. One side has nukes, the other does not. But if both do, such threats go both ways. If Kiev, Kharkiv, Odessa and Mariupol cease to exist, so do Rostov, Volgograd Kursk and Moscow. Which is why it will simply not happen. There's a good chance no hostilities will take place at all.

There is no policy that says inspectors should let you off if you're a day late. What's happening in your case is that a monthly ticket valid for a *calendar* month is additionally also valid for the last day of the previous month and the first day of the next month. This isn't merely some policy that you're being ""let off"", it's actually written into the regulations.

However, and this is important: this does not apply to ""gleitend"" tickets; that is, tickets that begin on an arbitrary day and are then valid for the next month. Those tickets become invalid immediately.

The reduced fine is possibly only for ""personal"" tickets, that is, tickets that bear your name and photo. That has to be on the ticket itself; if your ticket is transferrable and doesn't have your name and photo on it, you can't prove that somebody else wasn't using it at the moment you were caught. There will then be no reduction in the fine.

Also, the reduction is only possible if the ticket was actually valid on the day. If it wasn't -- no reduction: you didn't have a valid ticket.

The policy that *is* in place is that ticket inspectors are allowed, and encouraged, to use their own discretion. The classic case is the obvious out-of-towner with an unvalidated ticket. Genuine, and quite common mistake, so they take you off the train, explain how you goofed, watch you validate it and wish you a pleasant day.

They might also be lenient if they think you genuinely did just accidentally leave your ticket at home, or left home with the wrong one.

But this is at their discretion: they *can* give you the benefit of the doubt, but you have no right to expect it.

So, to sum up:

Your ticket is valid on the last day of the previous month and the first day of the next month, but ""gleitend"" tickets are not.

The reduced fine is available only to holders of valid non-transferrable tickets.",0,1409942244,null,0,false,0,cka444r,t3_2fjbp4,t1_cka444r,t1_ck9ta1s,null,1427180845,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

Non sono molto daccordo con l'articolo, i tagli lineari possono pure essere fatti.
O meglio, la linearità non doveva essere verso il grado, ma verso l'anzianità.
I giovani di oggi stanno pagando gli aumenti esagerati di chi è entrato nella nella PA negli anni 80 e certamente fino ai 93. A loro si dovevano bloccare gli stipendi totalmente, ai giovani bisognava solo rimodularli e farli progressivamente abbassare col passare dell'anzianità (per meritocrazia chi va avanti dovrebbe prendere più stipendio per l'aumentare del grado, non per anzianità ""dovuta"").
Mentre è ovvio che l'altro problema principale è che in questi 3 anni di blocco non si è fatto assolutamente nulla per riportare l'italia a livelli di galleggiamento. Allontanare le pensioni vuol dire avere comunque più dipendenti statali con anzianità enormi ingiustificate. Al contrario pensionarli significava abbattere le anzianità e volendo far entrare giovani con stipendi di 1/10 dei quasi pensionati (senza stare a dire che un giovane è produttivo 10 volte un quasi pensionato).

Sul tema forze dell'ordine è anche più complesso, perché il rapporto dei poliziotti con lo stato è strettamente legale alla criminalità, che in periodi di magra (credo) aumenti notevolmente, e la spending review doveva essere un palliativo, un ritardante, non ""la soluzione"" al problema.",0,1409942775,null,0,false,0,cka4e9x,t3_2fkjc5,t1_cka4e9x,t3_2fkjc5,null,1427180714,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5

true,Jaquestrap,UNSA,United States of America,"Oh yeah, I completely agree with you that the unit is not there to fight Russia alone. Hell that 5,000 man unit (while it would certainly come in handy) is still *much* smaller than the Polish military alone and wouldn't be decisive in and of itself in any conflict. Eve moreso than being a fast-response force, it's job isn't specifically to hold off the Russian forces, that's the overall job of the Eastern NATO armies (Poland, the Baltic States, Romania etc), and it would again be of negligible importance in this overall mission compared to the armed forces of said nations.

What it really serves for is, as people have laid out, more of a symbolic reassurance that Polish/Baltic troops would not be fighting alone, only ""hoping"" that Western troops would eventually make their way there a la WWII. It's just a bit of concrete proof from the Western NATO allies to Poland and the Baltic states that the West is ready, able, and determined to back them up with troops on the ground. Kind of like a ""Don't worry, we understand that words are only words so to reassure you, here's some tangible troops on the ground right now so you know that we are committed and will send more if necessary in the future."" This also serves the added purpose of not only NATO obligations demanding that the rest of NATO goes to war if one NATO member is attacked, but also directly ensures that if the Baltic States and Poland are invaded, the armed forces of Western NATO Allies will also be subject to attack thus **absolutely** guaranteeing that said nations will go to war against an invader, under the domestic laws of those nations and not only under NATO obligations. 

I disagree however that the US wouldn't need to intervene--even though Europe combined might have the necessary military strength to defeat Russia, Europe *isn't* a centralized entity and wouldn't want to have to put such an all-out effort into fighting that war alone just to ""let America sit this one out."" America is the linchpin of NATO, it is pretty much the reason that NATO continues to exist and is so effective, without the United States NATO would be hardly more cohesive and effective than the League of Nations was. America would jump into that fight right away for a number of reasons, as it is clearly the leader of the Alliance, it has made its own guarantees to Poland and the Baltic States, it is one of the few NATO member nations that is fully capable of fighting that sort of conflict at any given time. No other nation has the same level of military infrastructure (I mean there are hundreds of floating military supply depots stationed all over the world for U.S. expeditionary forces to use at a moment's notice, not to mention the mobile armies that are U.S. Navy Aircraft Carriers), troop readiness, military supply, military funding, military *experience*, technology, armaments, etc necessary to react rapidly to an all-out war away from it's immediate geographic location, and not only react but actually be able to decisively *win* a conflict against a military power like the Russian Federation. In reality, the EU has been able to confidently spread to the East primarily because it for the most part falls under the military umbrella of NATO and subsequently, has the backing of the United States of America. If the EU wasn't backed up by NATO, it would have met far more resistance from Russia in it's spread east and wouldn't be nearly as bold in doing so--the EU has yet to organize a cohesive and reliable level of military unity that would suffice to confront a military like Russia's--NATO was *literally founded* for the purpose of opposing the USSR and later the Warsaw Pact. The EU has started to develop it's own military international components, such as the EU Battle Groups, but those are still only the nascent stages of a full-fledged EU military arm, similar to how the European Coal and Steel Community was simply the nascent stages of what would become the EU.",0,1409944003,null,0,1409945264,0,cka51v1,t3_2fjgyv,t1_cka51v1,t1_cka49c2,null,1427180408,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Since it is his first time the chance for him to be taken to court is zero since this *only* happens to people who did it several times in a row (as far as I know the threshold in Berlin seems to be four times within a year). 

The mistake you are making is this idea about not paying the fine might lead to a court hearing and then an arrest warrant. That's simply dead wrong - you are confusing the very elementary division of the legal systems. The Inkasso guys may try to take you to court if you don't pay them, but it will be a *civil* court. The offence of serial fare dodging is heard before a *criminal* court. Huge difference. A civil court CAN NOT throw you in jail (that would be the debtor's prison), no matter how high your debt is. On the other hand serial fare dodgers are taken to court REGARDLESS if they paid the fine or not.  

&gt;Most people in low-level security prisons in Berlin are there for fare dodging.

That's not entirely correct either. They are the largest group but far from being the majority.

&gt;Eine Anlage für die LSL-Rhein-Main-Brüterei – eine der größten in ganz Deutschland – müsste aber das 20-fache schaffen. Also 200.000 Eier am Tag.

The mating ritual of the German Youth has so far not been studied extensively, but at this point it is probably safe to assume that sheer sound intensity is **not** used to bait the females. It rather seems to be a habit born out of necessity, since everyone else is loud, too, so that in order to be heard at all one needs to raise their voice.  

The singing, especially in Bierzelten, is used to establish and reassure a sense of camaraderie. However, since the female specimens also take part in those rituals, it can in fact be used to bond with a potential mating partner.

If you had read my post all the way through, you would have noticed that I went on to explain that while this is the theory, it's unlikely to happen to the OP.

&gt; The mistake you are making is this idea about the Inkasso guys taking you to court and this leading to an arrest warrant.

I condensed my explanation for reasons of brevity. But if you don't pay the erhöhtes Beförderungsentgeld, you can be prosecuted, and people frequently are. A complaint is filed with the police, the police do their stuff. Yes, you're right, the Inkasso doesn't directly prosecute you, but that's not quite what I said. At this point, it's a bit academic: a process has been set in motion which, in theory, if you do nothing, could potentially result in a prison sentence.

That this is highly unlikely to happen to the OP was something I went on to state quite explicitly. I think it's useful to know what *could* happen (in theory), although not necessarily in every single detail, to get a better understanding of *why* it's unlikely to happen.

true,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"&gt; Paying a fine or not has NO IMPACT on you being taken to court.

I don't even know where to begin with this. Either you have completely failed to understand what I've been saying, or I'm hallucinating.

If you don't pay the erhöhtes Beförderungsentgeld, you can end up being prosecuted for the crime of ""Erschleichung einer Dienstleistung"", obtaining a service under false pretences. This happens very, very often indeed, and this fact is routinely criticized.

&gt; In reality the BVG/S-Bahn/whoever will not even notice you paying the the fine or not since they routinely sell their claim to the Inkasso company.

You think they just ""sell their claim"" and then forget about it? This is Germany: they have it on file when you are caught without a ticket, and if you pay the fine the Inkasso notifies them of this fact. They have your name and birthdate, and they know exactly how often you've been caught and at what stage you paid up (assuming you did). And the fact that your case has been referred to Inkasso goes on your Schufa report, for good measure.

How do you think they catch all these repeat offenders and successfully prosecute them if they don't know whether or not they have outstanding fines to pay? How do you think people even end up in jail for exactly this if it's an ""impossible"" chain of events?

Propaganda run by  the right wing sympathizers, which became more vocal in Poland recently. My personal guess is: rights found a scapegoat to 1) strengthen their anti-west stance with islam radicals actions that ""decadent West is allowing on their soil"" (that's the main message about the islam that is present in Polish web); 2) to promote a catholic religion as a savior and the opposition for the islam (arguments ""if we won't be a catholic, muslims will come and make bad things"" are quite often present during discussing the topic). 

The fun fact is that Poles of the current 18-30 yo generation, the main target of the rights, don't really know Turks and Turkey. The minority of Turks in Poland is marginal (and are completely harmless, running food and catering businesses), and the main message and negatives comes from the medias and (unfortunately) internet. What is more funny, for them every arab is basicaly the same, and they don't really see a difference between Iraq, Turkey or Egypt, sunni or shia, wahhabi or sufi. Not to even mention Iran and the surprise and disbelief when they find out, that Iran is not arab but Persians (plus the little detail that Persian and Slavian people has the same ancestry, is almost mindblowing for some of the thick headed).

Nazi Germany fashioned itself as a mostly homogenous entity which fit the human condition of the time in Europe (ethnic nationalism/fascism). Being German in Nazi Germany wouldn't have meant automatic guilt either. If anything, the Nazis are proof that any society is capable of spiraling down a bad path if the conditions are right. If you look at Germany today, obviously they were salvaged. I think the same goes for anybody who indirectly supports the sick shit that those jihadists do.

On se focalise à tort sur son étiquette libérale gnagnagna, mais ce qui pose problème, c'est sa personnalité: soit il ne décide rien, soit il va directement au choc frontal par maladresse ou arrogance, et entre les deux extrêmes, rien du tout.

Die sieht wie folgt aus: Der Islam ist rassistisch, homophob, menschenverachtend und jeder der an einem friedlichen Miteinander interessiert ist muss diese Elemente dieses Aberglaubens ablehnen. 

Man kann keine Ideologie in einer freien Welt tolerieren, die offen den Rassismus von seinen Anhängern fordert, einen Großteil der Menschen in der aufgeklärten Welt als Untermenschen bezeichnet die getötet gehören, Homosexuelle zu Freiwild erklärt und Frauen unterdrückt.

Es bleibt das große Mysterium unserer Zeit, wie es Linke und Grüne geschafft haben sich mit dieser Weltanschauung zu verbünden und die Anhänger dieses Aberglaubens zu benachteiligten Opfern zu machen. Das haben vor ihnen nur die Nationalsozialisten probiert, alle anderen lehnten das ab.

Man hat es so weit gebracht, dass der Hass mittlerweile an deutschen Schulen unterrichtet wird, das Antisemitismus in Deutschland wieder geduldet wird, man hat sogar Gesetze eingeführt, welche die barbarische Genitalverstümmelung von Kindern straffrei stellen, nur um den Anhängern dieses Aberglaubens ... ja was eigentlich zu geben?

Von dem Nazi verlangt man ständig, dass er sich ans Grundgesetz halte und die Menschenwürde achtet, vom Mohammedaner wünscht man sich, dass er seine Kultur hier auslebt und Zustände wie in seinem Land schafft, denn diese Menschen mit ihrer vielfältigen Kultur sind ja eine Bereicherung für uns alle. 

Wieso diese doppelten Standards? Was ist falsch daran von einem Mohamedaner die Achtung der gleichen Gesetze zu fordern? Von ihm Toleranz zu verlangen? Ihn genau so hart zu bestrafen wie nicht Abergläubige?

Dieser vorauseilende Gehorsam, nur nie in den Verdacht zu kommen man könnte ja rassistisch sein und deshalb die Mohamedaner mit Samthandschuhen anzufassen, macht aus denen keine besseren Menschen.

Und ich weiß, gleich werden mir hier wieder alle erzählen wie toll es sich doch mit dem Islamischen Nachbarn lebt, der seine Frau unter einen Schleier zwingt, einer deutschen Frau nicht die Hand reicht, auf Schwule schimpft, Segregation von Frauen und Männern fordert, ein Joch von dem wir uns nach hunderte Jahre langem Kampf endlich verabschiedet haben.

Stellt euch einfach mal vor ein Rechtspopulist verhält sich so. Oder ein Neonazi. Oder jemand von der AfD. Was hier los wäre, wie alle zetern und schreien würden. Wenn das aber ein Moslem macht, dann ist das völlig okay. Meine Güte, diese Heuchelei.

&gt;The principal goal of Albanian forces was the **creation of a Greater Albania** that would include Novi Pazar in it. As a consequence, **efforts were made to Albanize the Bosniak population of Novi Pazar** – one of the policies that created the greatest revolt among the local Bosniak population was the prohibition of wearing the Muslim hat, fez.[6] During a public speech made when the first Albanian military forces penetrated into Novi Pazar in October 1941, **Hadžiahmetović warned the public present that they are ""Albanian, and not Bosniak""**, and stated: ""Behind us stand three million Albanians, our Pazar is the centre of Albania, and **we will create a Greater Albania.**"".[6] At another public speech, **Hadžiahmetović is recorded to have said that the population which occupies all lands spanning from Raška (a town in southern Serbia) to the southernmost point of Albania is Albanian.**[6]

true,New-Atlantis,EURO,European Union,"&gt; The tiny island nation is the rest of the EU's largest export market - and has a significant trade surpluss with the rest of the EU. I expect you will want to keep being able to export to the UK.

After all these years of anti-EU rhetoric, why is it that you people can't come up with a single real argument? About 50% of UK exports go to EU countries while European countries export on average between 6 to 9% to the UK. We can do without the UK market easier than without the Russian market, because the future is in the emerging markets not in little old England.

&gt;As you know, in the last two years this sweatshop economy in the UK created significantly more new jobs

As you know the jobs created are mostly low-wage jobs and precarious employments. Which shows that you are on your way to a sweatshop economy and increasing inequality. Moreover, the recovery is primarily based on real estate speculation. Every speculative bubble bursts in the end. Besides, the UK has higher unemployment than Germany and other comparable European countries.

And don't forget that trade is always a two-way street. If you think you can beat Europe with tax or social dumping, Europe will just put import duties on your goods. The EU was created to prevent that sort of unfair and ruinous competition that led to the great war.

true,dClauzel,Rhone,Rhône-Alpes,"&gt; vous verrez qu'on a tort d'envisager l'hypothèse d'une dissolution de l'Assemblée.

S’il y a dissolution de l’Assemblée Nationale, il faudra organiser des élections législatives. Tous les partis politiques (significatifs) étant aux fraises sauf le Front National, ça ferait des ravages.

L’UMP est pour encore un long moment incapable de s’organiser, et encore moins de proposer des candidatures uniques dans beaucoup de circonscriptions.

Le PS ne tient que parce qu’il a la présidence et la majorité à l’Assemblée Nationale — il est effectivement en semi roue-libre.

Les Verts sont… les verts. Biens, mais… organisés comme des Verts, quoi :P

Le Front National a une direction forte, une base électorale qui se décomplexe, et le vent dans les voiles.

Donc la dissolution est politiquement impensable à moins de vouloir mettre le bordel dans le pays.

Comme solution, je dirais… 

1. virer Valls qui cristallise les problèmes pour mettre un Premier Ministre consensuel, entrainant… et donc probablement pas encarté PS
2. faire passer une rafale de petites lois symboliquement fortes, liées aux promesses de la campagne électorale : suppression de la Hadopi, revenir sur les parties liberticides de Loi de programmation militaire, arrêter les lubbies d’élus locaux qui font hurler les gens (NDDL, etc)
3. réaliser la réforme fiscale tant promise et attendue : taxation des revenus et non des capitaux, principe du pollueur-payeur, etc.

Mais ça implique de travailler autrement que par des coups de comm’, en donnant des postes clés et des responsabilités à des gens qui ne sont pas forcement au PS (et en virant des gens qui y sont), donc ça n’a aucune chance de se faire :(",0,1409949695,null,0,false,0,cka803q,t3_2fk81l,t1_cka803q,t1_cka750i,null,1427178962,6,false,france,t5_2qhjz,6

In fact, the institutions have held better while being confronted to other crisis (Algeria war, oil shocks, riots and big demos...). The past few years have seen an almost uninterrupted streak of scandals of corruption, nepotism, incompetence among the main two parties. For the past 40 years, parties distributed fiscal gifts and public money to ascertain their power, while raising taxes or suscribing more loans, with no will to reform or evolve. The conjugation of many elements brought de facto an end to this system, as we can't afford it anymore. In France, when you take the power, you take the power primarily to make sure your opponent doesn't. And when you hold the power, you postpone issues and transmit them to your successors, while placing your friends in strategic positions, and enjoying the life of a king.
On many aspects, French political system is very much like Greece's, with a major difference (until now): France is very good at collecting taxes.

(many syntax errors and mistranslations, sorry je being tired)



Let me state it differently, and mark my words:

French politics are like Game of Thrones, maybe with less physical murders (as we live in an era where pictures or stolen confidences can be more lethal than daggers), but with much more corruption, plot twists, living dead, dragons and sex.

true,Bobo-_-,NETH,The Netherlands,"The first formal agreement between Bosnian Chetniks and the Ustaše was concluded on 28 May 1942, in which Chetnik leaders expressed their loyalty as ""citizens of the Independent State of Croatia"" both to the state and its Poglavnik (Ante Pavelić). During the next three weeks, three additional agreements were signed, covering a large part of the area of Bosnia (along with the Chetnik detachments within it). By the provision of these agreements, the Chetniks were to cease hostilities against the Ustaše state, and the Ustaše would establish regular administration in these areas.[81] The Chetniks recognized the sovereignty of the Independent State of Croatia and became a legalized movement in it.[85] The main provision, Art. 5 of the agreement, states as follows:

As long as there is danger from the Partisan armed bands, the Chetnik formations will cooperate voluntarily with the Croatian military in fighting and destroying the Partisans and in those operations they will be under the overall command of the Croatian armed forces. (... ) Chetnik formations may engage in operations against the Partisans on their own, but this they will have to report, on time, to the Croatian military commanders.

However I think surface wise the RN is very limited.  Only six Type 45s (and a total of 10 PAAMS capable ships in the world) honestly creates creates issues in terms of depth.  Quality is excellent, but one of those ships needs emergency maintenance and you have a serious capability gap.  It's the downside to building an air defense destroyer designed to protect a large area and not having too many spares around.

Personally I think the RN's big mistake was not following the Japanese method of adopting Aegis and modifying it.  The Japanese Navy got what they wanted and can still plug into USN battle groups for big events.  With PAAMS the theoretical battle group would be 6 Type 45s and 4 Horizon Frigates (2 French, 2 Italian) assuming no one is undergoing refit, repair, etc.  Plus two UK carriers and the French carrier.  It's nice striking force, but if we are in a situation where we need to escort joint forces across the Atlantic or elsewhere I think the inability to tie into an American Aegis network will hurt from an operational standpoint.  Even if PAAMS is better, the lack of hulls that operate it hurts.  Back when the French and Italians were going to operate 8 total hulls it was a bit better, but they halved their order and the UK also cut down on the Type 45 order, so the result is 10 total.",0,1409951114,null,0,false,0,cka8pbe,t3_2fk9nz,t1_cka8pbe,t1_cka5eco,null,1427178635,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

The Royal Navy was involved in fighting from very early on against Kriegsmarine submarines and surface raiders, but lacked the ability to land a theatre-scale army in hostile territory. It had relatively few carriers, all of which were required to support possible fleet actions in the Mediterranean, Atlantic and Pacific rather than invasions, and modern amphibious assault ships weren't to be developed for another few decades yet.

Even as late as 1942 at Dieppe, the RN and USN were unprepared to wage an amphibious war, because it required entirely new types of ship like large landing craft to be built on a massive scale. An amphibious invasion of Germany would have failed early in the war without the large fleets of specialised landing craft, years of planning, American reinforcements and complex deceptions based on the Allied decryption of the Enigma machine that allowed D-Day to be won.",0,1409952082,null,0,false,0,cka95uu,t3_2fjgyv,t1_cka95uu,t1_cka772t,null,1427178421,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

While I cannot tell you what the situation might be like in Munich (should you be looking to go there), generally I think it's safe to say that Geographers are welcomed in Germany. Places like planning bureaus and places dealing with land registry (=Katasteramt) tend to find a liking towards the more holistic and open-minded approach Geography takes and will employ Geographers, or at least you have a good shot at landing an internship and hopefully a paid position will result in due time. Your minor in biology might come in handy if you want to apply at a conservation firm or something of that sort. But yeah, if you haven't already got some sort of experience dealing with GIS, definitely start, and if you do, start anyway and expand your knowledge! GIS is probably the most valuable skill you'll take with you as a Geographer, so make sure you kick butt at it. Of course, should you be serious about entering the German job market, you should be able to speak German, for even though Germans tend to speak English well enough, it isn't going to be easy not knowing German (especially in Bavaria, but then again, not even the rest of Germany understands whatever language they speak there :D )

As for masters programs, it depends on what direction you want to specialize in. If you are into (city) planning, I heard there's a good masters program in Osnabrueck, and the Geography institute in Muenster is pretty renowned (not trying to be all too biased, but I have to advertise my Uni when I get the chance!). But you sound like Germany would be a good match for you, it's a rich and wonderful country, I don't regret choosing it over the US!

Anyhow, hope this has been of some help to you, let me know if you'd like more information. My overview on the Geography situation in Germany is humble at best, but I'm always willing to help a fellow Geographer out!

Cheers, and good luck!

true,Cai_E,UNSA,United States of America,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAAMS

Multiple ships in a battle group network together to share tracking and targeting info, along with determining who has the best shot at the hostile missile, plane, etc.  

America uses Aegis for the same task and we've exported it to Norway, Spain, Japan, South Korea, and upcoming Australian warships will use it as well.  

France, the UK, and Italy decided to jointly make a destroyer and make their own combat system al la how the Eurofighter happened.  However there were disagreements from the get gone in terms of requirements.  The UK pulled out of the joint destroyer project but stayed in the group on the electronics/combat side of things.  

Problem is PAAMS is incompatible on multiple levels.  PAAMS ships can't network into an Aegis group or vice versa.  So if you have a pair of American destroyers and a British one, the Americans can support each other, the British one has to operate solo.  Also American missile launchers are built to handle both the Tomahawk and our Aegis Standard Missiles.  The French and Italians did not consider handling Tomahawks an issue so the PAAMS cell wasn't designed to fit them.  However the UK does operate Tomahawks and thus had an issue with fitting strike capability into their Type 45s.  On top of that now these three countries and their ten ships are on the hook to redesign and upgrade the system to deal with emerging threats.  Whereas America, Japan, and the ROK all contribute to testing and designing Aegis upgrades (and selling them to Norway and Spain helps defray some of the cost).  Australia has indicated it wants to contribute once it has its Aegis hulls in service.  

My personal guess is that while PAAMS is an excellent system currently, budget issues will make it harder for it to stay current.  For example Aegis is being systemically expanded to handle shitty ICBMs (ex: The old and low tech types North Korea might shoot at Japan) and has done well in tests.  We and the Japanese have both used it to shoot down old satellites as well and when Mir (the Russian space station) was taken out of orbit, a pair of American Aegis destroyers were near Australia in case the Russians screwed up and any debris looked like it might fall on them instead of into the ocean.  Anti missile/satellite capability was cut from PAAMS due to budget issues and I think over time these cuts will build up since these ships and their services need to last for decades while remaining current.

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"Yeah, so chances are Hollande will not even try for reelection, which would be the first time a president does that in recent memory I think. But frankly, that's the smartest move for the Socialist Party, and anyway even if Hollande were stubborn I don't think he'd have the courage to even try.

It's pretty much a certainty that Le Pen will be in the second turn, unless things somehow change until then. Le Pen will surely be against the mainstream right wing candidate in the second turn, whoever it is, and the latter will surely win. That's because the mainstream left wing are so terrified by the Front National (Le Pen's party) that they'll certainly vote for the mainstream right to counter Le Pen. 

However, the mainstream right isn't that much against Le Pen, so in an unlikely scenario where Le Pen gets to the second turn against a socialist, the right wing electors will prefer Le Pen than some leftist. 

As for the FN's ideals, one can consider that they're socially conservative (against gay marriage, against immigration, nationalistic..etc..), whereas they're economically leaning to the left. The left wing denies this however. In recent years though, the FN has attracted people from the far left concerned with socio-economic issues, and people from the mainstream right concerned with conservative issues. That's where most of the FN's growth comes from.

Anyway, with Marine Le Pen, the party has successfully, but not completely, changed its image into something more accepted. There's still an uneasiness towards them, but support for them has never been so much out in the open as the party is considered more presentable. I think people from outside France however still see them as much more extreme than the average Frenchman does.

Very personally, I think, or rather know that there are still extremist nationalist, and racist elements in the party. However if they somehow get to power, I don't think it would be catastrophic because the party will likely still act with a minimum of restraint or within the bounds of internal and external pressure. If Le Pen were elected, she'd still probably have a minority in the National Assembly. Regardless, the party would surely try out some controversial reforms here and there, serve its term, and if they did well they'll be reelected, if not they won't. The worst thing that'll happen is that there will probably be protests and riots all the time, just because they're in power, which will constantly freeze the country.",0,1409952779,null,0,false,0,cka9htl,t3_2fka03,t1_cka9htl,t3_2fka03,null,1427178266,-3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-3

true,Louis_de_Lasalle,ITAL,Italy,"Haha I see you know Italy. Honestly it is a great mix of things. There is a great deal of semi institutionalised corruption, which makes the people naturally distrustful of government and looking for a way to cheat it at every turn, this leads to people believing that their vote is of no importance and they often sell their votes for a quick favour (this is both true in the literal and figurative sense) and this in turn strengthens and propagates corruption. It is a vicious cycle. The Italian people have the bad habit of voting for whoever offers them the best quick promise; regardless of weather it is good or bad for the nation.

Also, the fact that Italy is two nations within one nation. The south and the north are different in everything. A man from Milan and a man from Palermo have two utterly separate cultures, values, world views, and expectations of how life ought to be lived and run. I have long maintained and I still believe, that the honest truth, is a person from Milan or Turin have more in common with a Person from Vienna or Geneva, than they do with a Neapolitan or a Syracusan.

Also the modern Italian Republic was born out of a civil war between communists and fascists, and Italian politics is still incredibly diverse and polarised. We still have 1960's style communists and De Gaullian like right wingers, although they are the old guard and are starting to loose their hold on politics. But we have new and young radical movements like  the 5 star movement and the Lega Nord which have taken their place. Unfortunatly the table of discussion in Italy is not between centre, centre-right, and centre-left; it is between centre, centre-right, centre-left, Jacobins, Communists, Fascists in all but name, the organised crime, the contrarians (who much like reddit will oppose out of principle anything that is seen as majority approved of), the church, and whatever the flavour of the month is. Add to the fact that politicians will often switch sides based on whom the public is leaning in favour of, and parties are dissolved and reformed with the same regularity as the rain cycle; and that In Italy you cannot vote for your representative, you can only vote for a party who will select a representative for you.

This is a rough picture and the strokes are broad and the colours are a bit off, but it is honest enough to show that in this landscape, political stability is simply not part of even the naivest idealist's presumptions.

true,Emnel,POLA,Poland,"About Crimea I'd go with the article too. Actually, it was my view on it all along. 

It was more about short victorious war to rally people to the banner and blame West for that train wreck in slow motion called Russian economy, than anything else. 

It, however, was quite logical. Made in a very clean fashion and costs both via sanctions and of integrating Crimea into Russia were more or less manageable. Especially for such a political boost. 

Both creating a rebellion and invading Ukraine seems beyond pointless tho and it gets worse with every passing day. 

Sanctions are piling up, Rubel sinks, cargoes 200 keep coming, parts of population start to get uneasy and even NATO is getting more assertive by the day.  Russian military victory seems within reach, but that's not the end of the problems - annexing Eastern Ukraine will bring more sanctions further killing Russian economy and costs of rebuilding it after conquests will be huge and long term. Even his successful propaganda can't keep people fooled forever and once they'll start losing jobs and money it won't be long till they start to blame Putin along with the West. 

Frankly, I don't see how any kind of Russian control over E. Ukraine (be it direct, or via those Republics) can end in anything other than disaster for Russian Federation and possibly even Putin himself. 

To make things worse, since nationalistic genie is out of the bottle there is no telling how far Putin will decide to go once he realises that things are starting to crumble around him. 

I assume he's simply using this far-right hysteria rather than believing in it, so he may stop, do the math and back off soon, but that's everyone guess, really. ",0,1409953716,null,0,false,0,cka9xdl,t3_2fjb4y,t1_cka9xdl,t1_ck9rf0z,null,1427178064,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Even more likely however he would try to portray the situation as a defensive action, with Russia simply responding to aggression on the part of it's neighbors. The most likely situation would be another cold-war era baring of teeth at each other, with slight escalations across borders until maybe something spontaneously erupted in such a way that it wouldn't spark a massive conflict, just a localized one.

But there is always a chance that Putin could go for broke and go just far enough in that the situation blew up into full-scale war. In that case, I don't really think that the Russian people would be willing to put up with anything less than victory, and if/when the Russian military would start to be pushed back and lose, Putin would be ousted and there would be a power-shift in Russia. The only way that Putin could reconstruct a new Russian ""Empire"" would be slowly and gradually, avoiding overt and direct conflict with the West. These latest developments may not seem slow to us, but relatively speaking they aren't part of a greater overall push at quick expansion so much as they're reactions to what Moscow perceives as Ukraine breaking away and potentially being out of Russia's grasp in the future--so Moscow acts now while it still has a chance.

But it remains to be seen what happens. The only way that war between NATO and Russia would take place is if a NATO state comes under attack by Russian troops, and I guess we'll just have to see if Putin is dumb enough to do that, or confident enough to take the risk of trying covert action again.",0,1409954032,null,0,1409954220,0,ckaa2p2,t3_2fjgyv,t1_ckaa2p2,t1_cka8opj,null,1427177995,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Den Strafantrag kann – muss aber nicht – das vom „Schwarzfahren“ betroffene Beförderungsunternehmen stellen. Die Staatsanwaltschaft entscheidet nach Abschluss der Ermittlungen, ob ein hinreichender Tatverdacht vorliegt und gegen den Beschuldigten Anklage erhoben wird oder ob das Verfahren wegen geringer Schuld oder wegen fehlenden öffentlichen Interesses an der Verfolgung eingestellt wird. Die Strafverfolgungsbehörden werden angezeigte Beförderungserschleichungen bei Wiederholungstätern anklagen.

true,RomeVacationTips,null,null,"Firstly, the local train doesn't go where you need to go, so you can dismiss that as an option. Secondly the monorail (such as it is) is just between the gates and the terminal building in the airport, so don't worry about that either.

You therefore have two public transport options to get from the airport into the city: coach (€4) or fast train aka the Leonardo Express (€14). Both arrive into the same place: Termini station, which is the Metro hub for the city. Once you're there you get on the blue Metro line (Linea B) south for three stops and you're at Circo Massimo. It's a fairly short, painless journey.

Coach tickets are available from booths in the terminal building after you exit customs. There are several companies offering the service, but 'Terravision' is the biggest and most reliable. The coach takes 45 minutes upwards, depending on traffic.

To buy tickets for the Leonardo Express, follow the signs for the train station and there are automated kiosks or a manned booth, both selling the same tickets. I find the kiosks to be a little confusing so aim for the booth where the staff speak English. Make sure to frank your ticket as you enter the gates to the station platform (no tourist is aware of this, so the ticket inspectors usually give them leeway, but it's best to do the right thing. Dumb system if you ask me, but that's Rome...).

You buy tickets for the Metro from the machines in the station, just before the turnstiles. They have an English-language option. For a single journey get the 100-minute ticket (€1.50), though you may want to use the same machine at that time to grab a week-long ticket (€24) and save yourself screwing around for the next few days. The weekly ticket is all you need to take unlimited journeys on all buses, Metros, trams, night buses, and some of the commuter train lines going into the far suburbs of Rome, until midnight on the seventh day after you bought the ticket. It's pretty good value for money.

Churchill was the only voice saying anything against the nazi's. GERMANY IS ARMING. And Germany armed at full capacity for a full five years even before they invaded Poland.

true,Ren_the_unclean,null,null,"The biggest problem when discussing chetniks is the fact that they weren't a homogeneous organization. The best description I can think of is that chetniks were armed gangs of a few thousand people each with their own leader and agenda. Some of these groups would commit terrible revenge killings on Croats and Bosniaks. Some as you said would sign agreements to work directly under German command. Others would fight tooth and nail against the ustase and germans. This ambiguity makes it very difficult to say whether they were in general ""good guys or bad guys."" When I referred to chetniks in my original post I meant the largest and founding group of chetniks under the command of Draza Mihailovic. In the eyes of most Serbs this group is the only legitimate chetnik organization and all others are traitors and not real representatives of the chetnik movement. Like I said in the original post Draza only collaborated with germans in order to get arms to fight the ustase and partisans. He remained true to the allied cause throughout the war and constantly fought against the ustase despite the meager supplies that he had. After the war, the communists attempted to smear him by saying he was the leader of the chetniks during the battle of neretva. This is 100% false. If Draza was working for the nazis at this time why did they have a 100,000 reichsmark price on his head in late 1943? If he was a Nazi, why did he organize operation halyard for the allies in 1944? Its these kinds of inconsistencies that show just how paper thin the communist smear campaign is. 

Now, the passage you refer to is the agreement signed by representatives of Kosta Pecanac and the croat ustase in bosnia. You are 100% right that Kosta Pecanac and his 8000 chetniks were nazi collaborators who actively worked for the ustase. The problem though is that Kosta and his facists are not true representatives of the chetniks. When Draza Mihailovic learned of how Kosta had turned into a collaborator he was appalled and sent out death squads to kill Kosta. In May 1944 these assassins were successful in killing Pecanac and his group of collaborators ended up dispersing.

it's a huge area but to put it in a few sentences I can *choose* to give my say/vote to someone else (lets say someone who does it full time, like a moderator here) but importantly I can also take it back at any time. 

It's not much different to the tyranny of the masses we have now (or at least allude to having) but rather power that can be withdrawn at anytime.
If you do the right thing more people will back you in the long term.


you have to admit election cycles create pressure for short term plans.

They have the Standard Missile 2 which is an American/Aegis mainstay for self defense but they couple that with Thales radar and control systems.  Also they can track ballistic missiles, but do not operate the Standard Missile 3, which is what you need to shoot at them and it's not entirely clear if they all the pieces of the fire control needed to control a SM-3 or they are just meant to serve as spotters and help provide tracking data to a ground station/Aegis vessel.  However the warships are designed to partake in the American missile shield and can relay data to American Aegis warships.  

I think by the end of the 2017 modernization program the Zeven Provincien class will be a form of Aegis-Lite that can at least cooperate at some level with Aegis warships but might not quite be able to do it all.  Older vessels like the Karel Doormans have some ability to share information, but nowhere near at the level of an Aegis or PAAMS like system where the entire battlegroup is linked.  

Likely a big factor in the  modernization program is the role of the Dutch Navy.  Unlike the Americans, French, and British, the Dutch Navy isn't in the carrier escorting business.  It could be that the NATO doctrine are for the Dutch warships to hang out as spotters in certain areas where they would not be in immediate danger of an overwhelming missile attack and just provide tracking data, so the capabilities of the warship can scale.  America keeps talking about an Aegis Frigate for that role, to just service as mobile anti-ICBM platforms and not designed to handle a swarm of drones trying to blast through it on their way to a carrier.

Joking aside, the murder example was just an oversimplification on my side. The Twelve Tables was an attempt at a proto-constitution and has nothing to do with religion or human insticts. The concept of reward or punishment in the afterlife, according to one's deeds during his time in the mortal realm, still existed in the form of the Elysian Fields/Tartarus. There are also countless mentions of divine punishment in Greek myths (the torture of Promitheus for disobeying Zeus and providing mortals with sacred fire for example, which is clearly an allegory ofcourse). The Gods themselves were personifications of human vices and virtues. 



&gt; The Code of Hammurabi also only mentions the Gods in their tasking the rulers of Babylon to pacify the world.

Why, exactly? The massive cost increase in going nuclear brings practically no benefit. 



No other surface ships in the RN are nuclear powered and a carrier can only sail as fast and as far as it's escorts.



There is no infrastructure for building or maintaining a nuclear reactor for that ship in the UK. The nuclear reactors in the subs are a completely different ball game and the RN, quite frankly, doesn't have the expertise. The French thought it was a good idea and and a result the CDG spends most of its time in port. 



There's an even an issue of docking. There's plenty of countries out there that aren't keen on having nuclear powered aircraft carriers docking at their ports. The only reason America gets away with it is because it's America.

The British army on the continent was too small to take on the Germans on their own, they had to act in concert with the French, and unsurprisingly the French were focused on fighting a defensive war, which had worked for them the first time around. 

*After* the war, the Soviets outnumbered the combined allied forces by *four to one* in men, and two to one in tanks. They also had some of the best generals of the war. There absolutely was no hope of winning against that. And, frankly, Poland wasn't worth the risk of losing 2.5 million men and having Western Europe fall into Soviet hands. 

So talk about ""betrayal"" all you want, but the people at the time were making the best decisions they could with what they had, and with what they knew, to try and get the best possible outcome for the most people in Europe.

Debate away, I want to hear your opinion on that. What should we have done? You're clearly not happy with the course we took, what course should we have taken?

&gt;So while I personally don't hold a grudge, I think it's understandable why we felt betrayed.

So do I. I mean on a very basic level the UK failed in its obligations. We promised to help Poland and while, I would argue, we tried, we failed in doing so. We had pledged to protect Poland and we failed at that. I just want you to tell me what we should have done differently.

&gt;Another issue is how little recognition we got for our contribution to fighting Nazis.

Well, perhaps that's the case. I'm a guy from the highlands of Scotland, growing up one of my neighbours was the son of two polish immigrants who'd stayed here after WW2. They'd stayed because the Soviets stole Poland from the Poles and I was very aware of that. I grew up knowing that this family, in an historical sense, were refugees. I was happy that the UK had taken them in and given them a home but I was sad that they hadn't had a home in Poland because of the USSR.

&gt;one example being not inviting polish pilots to the 50th anniversary of Battle of Britain.

I honestly don't understand this, and I don't agree with it. I don't know what was going on there and without a bit more knowledge I don't want to condemn anyone, but it sounds awful. I'm fully aware that Poles fought for the UK. We had many Poles in this nation fighting side by side the UK forces, and they fought for the same reasons we did, because they were scared for the future of Europe and they wanted people to be free. Each and every one of them were brave people and, having grown up around the sons and daughters of these people, I grew up with a respect for the Polish people. This was only reinforced by my multiple visits to Poland where I found a welcoming, friendly, generous nation.

I love Poland, I really do, and I think that Poland has so much in common with the UK that it's almost unfunny how we're two separate nations. It makes me very sad that we weren't able to achieve our goal in WW2 of freeing Poland, but we weren't. In 1939, the UK was simply not able of gettin enough men to the front line to actually counter Germany, and in 1945 if we'd pushed against Russia we would have been perhaps more honourable but we would have lost and the entirety of Europe would have been red.

It makes me sad to hear that some Poles are so hateful towards us, becuase Britain did not want what happened, Britain tried, but ultimately by the 1940's Britain was not a superpower and we were not able do to as much as we would have wanted.

I'm sad about that. I'm also sad about the fact that people hate us for our lack of being able to do anything about that. Good intentions might not be worth much, but we had them. Churchill himself said that he felt that we'd lost WW2, for the simple reason that Poland was not free at the end.

I know friend. It just hurts. Try to view it from our eyes. Prior to WW2 we were a world power, we had an empire, we were powerful, we were important. Was any of that just? No, not really, but that was how it was. WW2 cost us all of that. WW2 took the UK from being a massive, powerful empire, to being a small nation under threat from the USSR. We let that all go in order that we could fight the Nazis and help stop their goal.

Agreed. The French *could* have done something. They almost did with the Saar offensive and then they stopped for reasons I do not understand, but from the UK, I just don't know what more we could have done.

We tried, we failed, and now people hate us for it. It makes me sad. Not because we lost the power we had in the world, every empire or world power loses its crown eventually, the UK ruled the world for hundreds of years and we were bound to lose that at some point. It hurts just because I know that we were on your side and Britons more than most people wanted Poland to be free and happy and the USSR took that and we couldn't save you, but we wanted to.

Your point of religion being utilized as an instrument of control is one that was resurrected by Marx in the contemporary era. Marxist interpretation of things isn't necessarily communist, just based on certain elements of his philosophy. For example, a lot of historians who base their attitudes 

&gt;The Twelve Tables was an attempt at a proto-constitution and has nothing to do with religion or human insticts. 

However, that is of particular importance to your point of view. Look up the ~~Basic~~Pure Theory of Law: a law always needs to derive its authority from a higher law. So to develop your argument, that would mean that The Twelve Tables derived their authority from God(s). However, there is no mention within the Tables of that.

&gt;The concept of reward or punishment in the afterlife, according to one's deeds during his time in the mortal realm, still existed in the form of the Elysian Fields/Tartarus.

Elysium itself has been an evolving concept, and wasn't always the place where good people go when dead. Some myths state that Elysium was only for heroes and regular joes -- no matter how well they did -- were stuck in Hades. That was how religion was like in Ancient Mesopotamia and is described in detail in the Epic of Gilgamesh. In fact, by the time the Solonian Constitution was fully accepted and in effect in Athens, many -- Pericles, for example -- had already turned to atheism. 

&gt;Why in your opinion kings always had to make clear to their people that they ruled by ""Grace of God""? Some even going as far as creating myths about how their bloodline was directly descented from the Gods?

That point is simple: you wouldn't oppose someone anointed by the gods, or the person was in fact so wise/powerful that his powers seemed to be supernatural. However, the mere fact that one was Chosen by Heaven/the Gods would not necessarily lend legitimacy to one's acts. There is still a sense of pragmatism to take into account and also personal strength by the part of the ruler. Look to the End of the Warring States Period in China: the legalists who helped lay the foundation for the Qin/Han system were decidedly apatheists, and much of their written statements is more pragmatism than morality. A Chinese ""Son of Heaven"" needed only to rule ""like a gentleman"" to be legitimate.

It's an old book, but it has a great layout with simply-explained grammar, plenty of vocabulary, useful exercises (when I started with the Penguin Course, I was struck by the similarity of the exercises), and an abundance of various translations (again, a lot like the Penguin Course). My personal favorite thing about the book is the short German paragraphs at the end of each chapter that talk about some location in Germany. They're written in ""regular"" German, not simplified for beginners, so they give you experience with useful vocabulary, grammar, and phrasing before you formally learn the concepts.

I should also note that I was a Biology major for 3.5 years and just recently switched to Geog, so I have a ton of Bio classes under my belt. Also, my specific major is called ""Environmental Studies"", which I forgot to mention is another reason I'm drawn to Germany in particular. I heard the German government is very environmentally proactive and dedicated to conservation. That's the exact kind of stuff I hope to get a career in someday, so it seems like a smart idea to try over there! 

I just took the most basic GIS course at my university last semester, and I'm in the general ""GIS"" course right now. They have a few more classes I can take, but I'm not yet sure how I'm going to take those and graduate next semester haha. Anyway, I'm very tech savvy and artistic, as well as a nature lover, so I enjoy GIS a lot. On that note, I feel like my personality will match a lot of Germans as well. I'm very straightforward, rule-abiding, detail-oriented, and morally driven. My heritage is 75% German so that could have something to do with it. I don't speak the language at this time, but I have a close friend over here who minored in German (and travelled there a few times) so I'm sure that won't be too problematic, although I have heard....things...Let's just leave it at that!

* Reactors(and trained personnel) are very, very expensive.  Adding a reactor immediately adds hundreds of millions of dollars to it.  The USN opted to restart the *Arleigh Burke* line rather than design a new surface combatant from scratch after the *Zumwalts* because there's actually a Congressionally mandate out there that the next new large surface combatant has to be nuclear powered.  $750mil was the number being thrown around as the cost increase of a ""*Arleigh Burke*, but nuclear powered"".  Admittedly, this means there's less lifetime fuel costs and if enough ships are nuclear powered than the fleet train can be reduced...but the initial capital costs are enormous and that's what democracies look to cut when defense cuts are made.

France is very Rousseau-ist. Whatever bad happens comes from the society or the institutions,  not the individual. Hence this permanent illusion for France to imagine a better world and institutions.

I believe in a more Locke vision of the world, or whoever said the opposite to Rousseau in this case. Our institutions are good, they could be better on some points (le rôle du Sénat, les commissions d'enquêtes parlementaires qui ne vont pas assez loin, une meilleure indépendance de la justice, la ridicule immunité judiciaire du président, etc...) - what is happening is that since around Chirac-Sarkozy, and now with the PS, our politicians are seriously harming the institutions by refusing to take responsibilities for their past and present actions.

Also, you forget the problem of the extreme concentration of media ownership in both the [U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_cross-ownership_in_the_United_States#Owners_of_American_media) and the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership#European_Union).

In the U.S. **90% of the media** is controlled by only **six companies**:

&gt;But this ignores the fact that in 1983, 50 companies owned 90 percent of the media consumed by Americans. By 2012, just six companies — including Fox (then part of News Corporation) and Time Warner — controlled that 90 percent, according to testimony before the House Judiciary Committee examining Comcast’s acquisition of NBCUniversal

http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/26/business/a-21st-century-fox-time-warner-merger-would-narrow-already-dwindling-competition.html?_r=0

Just six CEOs control the policy of how and what information gets sent into the world over 90% of media in the U.S.

Second, you obviously didn't read my comment I linked you too:

&gt;I understand, but I'm just saying that when one liar accuses the other, we shouldn't believe either one of them right off the bat.

&gt;U.S. has a [long history of overthrowing regimes of sovereign countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_United_States_foreign_regime_change_actions) and NATO has a shady history too, i.e. [bombing of a sovereign country that didn't threaten any of it's members without the approval of UN and against it's own charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_of_NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia).

&gt;Don't you remember that in 2003 a war was launched against Iraq that left hundreds of thousands dead, after U.S. and UK claimed it had WMDs, which turned out to be a lie?

&gt;Do you know what Rasmussen, then Danish PM, [said about Iraq in 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Fogh_Rasmussen#War_in_Iraq):

&gt;&gt;Iraq has WMDs. **It is not something we think, it is something we know**.

&gt;And this after Danish intelligence produced a classified report stating that there is no absolute proof of WMDs in Iraq!

&gt;The man is now the head of NATO.

&gt;That is my whole point. Russia lies, but the U.S., Europe and NATO lie, too.

&gt;When either of them accuses the other of something, we shouldn't believe *either* of them blindly.

Third, again, read this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_model

My point is, again, that both sides lie. It's just more obvious in Russia, because there is ~~now~~ no illusion of media plurality and Kremlin simply doesn't give a fuck.

We live in a world that is far more dependant upon forces that transcend traditional nation state boundaries. One problem with this is that if you do ever go to war with someone upon whom you are relying it has potentially serious economic ramifications. Frankly, I very much doubt that the British people would get behind any war 'in a far away land' that impacts their own self interests. I'm not sure this is limited to the uk either. The fact is that in the capitalist society that we live in, I don't think people would tolerate a knock to their quality of life. In terms of all out war, then of course the people don't have a choice, but in terms of foreign intervention I don't think the political environment is favourable any longer (particularly post Afghanistan and Iraq).

It doesn't mean there's no connection at all, it means that many carriers, irrespective of the fact that a possible crime has taken place, rather than immediately file a complaint with the police, charge an enhanced fare (in the case of most German public transport, €40 or twice the adult fare, whichever is higher).

But if you don't pay *that*, then they still have the option of filing a complaint, which will lead to a prosecution, which can potentially lead to a prison sentence. As I said, this happens quite often in Berlin, where the authorities consider it to be a deterrant.

I know perfectly well the difference between a civil case and a criminal case. I simply glossed over all the fine detail in order to give a broad picture, and you're just getting stuck on that. Your attention to detail is laudable, but not really helpful, if I'm honest.

&gt; Even if you pay each fine right away you still risk getting prosecuted if it happens to often.

That may be the case, and that option is available. The carriers are not *required* to charge the higher fare and can file a complaint immediately, if they so wish.

However, that's not what they do. I've known enough people who have been caught without a ticket several times. Their approach is a lot more nuanced than you give them credit for. Basically, you've taken a description of what options are available to them, and confused it with a description of what they actually do.

You'll notice that the last sentence says that the question of whether the enhanced tariff is a debt, a fine or a previously agreed fare is still open. If they did prosecute people despite them having paid the fine, there'd be a court ruling on exactly this point by now -- at least, you'd think so (it's hard to say -- you've quoted a reference article and on this point it fails to cite a source).

Who ultimately decides whether or not to prosecute is neither here nor there -- whether it's the VBB or the Staatsanwaltschaft. The point is that in theory, if you don't pay, you have committed a crime and can be prosecuted. You stated this is ""impossible""; it is not, merely highly improbable for a first or second offence, which is not the same thing at all.

Basically, when it says that the enhanced fare is ""independent of the criminal offence and its sanction"", it doesn't mean that prosecutions go ahead regardless of whether or not the fine was paid. It means that the *existence* of an enhanced fare is not dependent on the existence of the possibility of being prosecuted.",0,1409989949,null,0,false,0,ckamkf8,t3_2fjbp4,t1_ckamkf8,t1_ckaa78k,null,1427171017,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

true,maripool,null,null,"I'd recommend Union Berlin instead of the obvious choice Hertha. Yes, Union is ""only"" second league and did not have a good season start, but I'll make my case in favor of real football-culture:

- Union Berlin has a [real football stadium with bleachers next to the field](https://static.fc-union-berlin.de/cache/9da949b46fb39cd9795628674f426fe9.jpeg), while [the huge Olympic Stadium with Hertha is multi-purpose, with a running track separating fans from the field](http://www.olympiastadion-berlin.de/uploads/pics/Hertha-Bayer04_-_03.png). Football fans prefer a real football stadium and Union has Berlin's largest ""pure"" football stadium. (tickets will also likely be cheaper; -)

- Union Berlin is one of a few stadiums left (only St. Pauli and Kickers Offenbach also?) where one entire sidelines of bleachers is for standing tickets only. All other stadiums have pushed the standing bleachers behind the goals, no more on the sidelines. Standing fans are considered the more ""hardcore"" ones who define/dominate the atmosphere and historically, football stadiums almost only had standing sections.

- Union has, while lower spectator numbers, a more dedicated and interesting fanbase than Hertha (Sorry, Hertha-Fans, I know....your own sympathies might vary. I am not a fan of Union though, just an outside observer)

- Herthas opponent would be Wolfsburg. Wolfsburg is perhaps the most boring club in the league, even worse than Leverkusen. Extremely few fans and stirs little emotions in fans of the opponent. They do play good because of the financial input of Volkswagen, but else, avoid them if you can. Only little football culture there.

What dates would be possible for you? [Union plays for example at home](https://www.fc-union-berlin.de/profis/spielplan/):

- September 21: RB Leipzig. This will be carrying a lot of emotions, but of unique kind. Red Bull's owner ""bought"" a small club near Leipzig a few years ago und wants to build it into a major Europan club. It has been storming through the leagues ever since, but oldschool fans hate them because of the commercial notion behind it. At the same time, Leipzig has a growing fanbase at home with fans who like the antagonist role. This is RB Leipzig's first year in the second league, they are already ranking high in the league, so there might be lots of emotion in the bleachers against them. (I also wish they would disappear ;-)

- September 28th: SV Darmstadt. A small club near Frankfurt, but also with a dedicated fanbase and interesting football-culture. Also a bit of a success story recently: They were 3rd league and barely avoided going into 4th league last year due to a technicality (another club was suspended from third league), then stormed into 2nd league this past season and are now playing on the top.

You can't arrest them unless they actually break the law.

If what they're saying is, ""If you go into that club, you will receive fifty lashes,"" then that's intimidation and action can be taken.

It's possible that their orange jackets could be argued to constitute an unauthorized uniform. But that's not enough to start arresting people and possibly handing them a massive propaganda coup.

You see the problem? Obviously we don't want these people radicalising impressionable young men and turning them into terrorists. But you can't arrest people for crimes you think they might commit at some point in the future. That's the kind of thing we, as a democracy, condemn in dictatorships and theocracies -- it serves nobody at all if, in our zeal to get rid of these people, we ourselves become like them.

Such dir eine Lerngruppe zusammen (hoffe auf ähnliches Niveau), und dann löst ihr die Aufgaben zusammen, jeder schreibt sie für sich nieder. Du bekommst jede Woche einen Aufgabenzettel, der wirkt anfangs immer sehr heftig, aber nach ein, zwei Tagen Nachdenken solltest du erste Ansatzpunkte haben. Im Tutorium (falls vorhanden) kannst du dazu nachfragen, in der Übung bekommst du deine korrigierte Lösung zurück, wirst manchmal vorrechnen müssen und kannst auch Fragen stellen (der Fokus liegt aber klar darauf, die alten Aufgaben vorzurechnen, damit jeder eine korrekte Lösung kennt (mitschreiben!)). Übungen werden meist von älteren Studenten gehalten, und wenn du nett bist und auch kompetent wirkst, ist da durchaus auch Spielraum bei den Regelungen zur Anwesenheit, Abgabeschluss und Punktzahl zur Klausurzulassung. Rechne nicht damit, aber habe keine Panik, wenn du nur aus wichtigen Gründen nicht hinkannst und so zu häufig fehlst, oder frage den Übungsleiter, wenn du mal anders abgeben willst, oder habe keine Panik, wenn du anfangs zu wenig Punkte hast (ich habe immer anfangs im Semester besonders hart korrigiert, um später mehr Spielraum geben zu können und die Studenten anzuhalten, ordentlich zu arbeiten). Wichtig bei den Übungsaufgaben ist, dass du mit Kommilitonen drüber redest und niemals Lösungen nur abschreibst ohne sie zu verstehen (vorrechnen klappt dann nicht und noch wichtiger, du hast diese Aufgabenart dann nicht für die Klausur gelernt).

Dann geh zum Prüfungssekretariat und frage dort nach, ob du als offizieller Student eines anderen Faches diese Vorlesungen hören kannst (falls nein, frage nach den anderen Optionen) und sie dir auch nach einem Wechsel anerkannt werden können. Falls das nichts bringt oder du so zuwenig Vorlesungen hören können wirst, gucke in die Prüfungsordnung und suche dort gezielt, ob ein Nebenfach im Bachelor nötig ist (diese Vorlesungen kannst du auch jetzt schon anfangen) oder ob dort was von Soft Skills oder Studium Generale steht. Diese Veranstaltungen wirst du auf jeden Fall auch als Student eines anderen Faches hören können, allerdings haben sie einen entscheidenden Nachteil: du siehst dabei nicht, ob du Maschinenbau studieren willst oder doch lieber ein verwandtes Fach (und bei Bafög hast du nur recht kurz zum Studienfachwechsel).

* Ceux qui achètent un F-35 parce qu'ils aiment beaucoup lécher les bottes des ricains, même si leur coucou est un vrai tas de ferraille avec un coup de maintenance 5 fois plus élevés que celui d'un Gripen. (Coucou, le Canada et les Pays Bas)

Typhoon a aussi du mal à s'exporter, ceux qui l'utilisent sont ceux qui ont participer à sa conception (UK, Allemagne, Italie, etc.)

On a deux contrats en négociation pour le Rafale : l'Inde et les EAU. Le Rafale est comme d'habitude favori, a dominé ses concurrents en test d'efficacité, et on est rentré en négociation exclusive. Ça devrait le faire mais on est jamais à l'abri, c'était le cas pour le Brésil avant qu'ils choisissent le Gripen parce qu'il créera plus d'emploi. :/

true,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"You have to understand that *Mein Kampf* is an important historical document; also, in the interests of free speech, what constitutes illegal propaganda involves more than just spin and misdirection. Pretty much every election poster you've ever seen is propaganda of one sort or another, but making them all illegal would obviously not be practicable. It's propaganda, but not necessarily illegal, to say that high levels of immigration are responsible for social problems, unemployment and whatever -- it's not illegal to jump to the wrong conclusion, basically. Saying that immigrants are the scum of the earth and should be deported is, though, going to get you into trouble.

*Mein Kampf*, basically, is propaganda, but not, in the opinion of the BGH, the type of propaganda that is illegal. Actually, most of it is incredibly dull. It sets out Hitler's beliefs (or what he wants his readers to think his beliefs are), and it tries to explain, from his point of view, how he came to believe those things. It also describes his rise to power as he wanted people to see it, and how he reformed and modernised the party.

There is quite a bit of antisemitism in the second volume, some of it based on a forged historical document and some of it just nuts (such as the claim that the Jews deliberately used prostitution to spread syphillis among the Gentile population). There's also a lot of hugely ironic stuff, such as the insistence that Germany should not make the mistake of trying to fight a war on two fronts, and to that end must seek an alliance with Great Britain.

It may well be that, **IN THEORY**, it matters not one jot whether or not you pay the contractural fine as to whether or not you get charged with a criminal offence.

But when it comes to the ""erhöhtes Beförderungsentgeld"", there it is quite clearly stated that the question of whether this constitutes a contractural fine or something else **HAS NOT BEEN CLARIFIED**. If that is true (and I can't tell because you only cited a reference, not a source), then the **ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION** is that the courts have so far never had to deal with a case in which this was an issue. In other words, it appears that nobody has ever been prosecuted despite having paid the ""erhöhtes Beförderungsentgeld"" -- or if they were, they were too stupid to defend themselves by claiming they paid a previously agreed fare as set out in the company's terms and conditions as the fare for people who wish to travel without a ticket. Maybe you know of a case where somebody was prosecuted even after paying the enhanced fare -- I personally know of none. If you can point me to one, I'll concede the point.

In any case, **IN THE INTERESTS OF SIMPLICITY AND BREVITY**, I glossed over many aspects of the situation. This is something you don't seem to be grasping: it is by necessity a simplified sketch, not a legal text. Essentially, your complaint boils down to the fact that I said you get prosecuted for non-payment of fines when you believe I should have said you get prosecuted for fare-dodging.

Also (again, like u_0ffline already said), don't rely on stereotypes to judge whether or not you'll integrate into German society, we're not just a nation of loyal Engineer-people. ^^ 

As for my move from Cali to Germany, I had it a lot easier than you most probably will, because I, for one, am a half-German (mothers side, hailing from the Black Forest) and thus have a German passport and citizenship. Also, I have lived in Germany before, so I already knew the language, culture, customs, and so forth. I So I won't be able to tell you how difficult the integration process is because I have never experienced it, but knowing Germany, as long as you have all the correct paperwork with you, you won't have any trouble and the whole bureaucratic stuff will get done relatively quickly (in other words, NOT the DMV in America).

Still, you may ask me specific questions about Germany such as how the academic system generally works or cultural stuff one should be aware of. Having lived many years in the US and Germany, you learn to notice the similarities and ways in which they differ. Also:

&gt;Do they really not drink tap water?!?

Uh, no, that's the Americans. Tap water here is great, no chlorine or anything like that!

EDIT: Also, forgot to ask - have you ever been outside the US, and do you have any experience living on your own / being independent and self-sufficient? That will definitely come in handy when moving to another country. Especially Germany, because that's one of the most noticeable differences between the US and Germany - in America, people are very friendly and neighborly, and will often go out of their way to make sure you are faring alright (at college, for example, they help you with your course scheduling, there's open doors at your counselors office, etc.). Germans, while they can be friendly (like, super-friendly!), the collective German mindset seems to be that you focus on your stuff, they pride themselves in being strong-minded and being able to face their obstacles without help (or at least, that's how it feels). Don't expect much help from your superiors (professors, etc) when it comes to stuff like figuring out what classes you have to sign up for, the general idea is that ""you're on your own"". Once you have a good network of peers in place, though, they'll help you, because they probably face the same issues you do, so sticking together and consolidating knowledge is key to survival :)",0,1409998026,null,0,1409998806,0,ckanwfr,t3_2fkx9c,t1_ckanwfr,t1_ckaix2a,null,1427170347,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

Primo problema: la linea 2 della metropolitana usa i treni delle FS, quelli con tre scalini alti per salire. Assicurati che i tuoi sappiano sollevare i bagagli e sappiano salire gli scalini con i bagagli.

Secondo problema: il trasferimento di circa 150metri dalla stazione di Mergellina (sempre se devono andare lì) al porto. La strada è facilissima perché usciti dalla stazione di Mergellina è sufficiente andare in discesa e si trova il mare, penso si veda addirittura... O quasi.

More cuts to social benefits untill there are none left, more cuts to the healthcare system untill it's all privatized, more cuts to the police force untill private security forces patrol gated communities. More deregulation to environmental protection because it affects corporate profits and GDP numbers, untill our habitat is unhabitable.

&gt;Beim Schwarzfahren erwischt worden?


&gt;Erste Hilfe für den Umgang mit Kontrolleuren, Polizei und Staatsanwaltschaft von Rechtsanwalt Steffen Dietrich, Strafverteidiger und Fachanwalt für Strafrecht aus Berlin-Kreuzberg 


(...)

&gt;**Zunächst muss man sich vergegenwärtigen, dass mein Schwarzfahren zwei verschiedene Rechtsgebiete betroffen sind: Das Zivilrecht und das Strafrecht.**


&gt;Zivilrechtlich ist die Schwarzfahrt ein Verstoß gegen die Beförderungsbedingungen des jeweiligen Verkehrsunternehmens – z. B. der BVG oder der S-Bahn in Berlin.

&gt;Strafrechtlich kommen, je nach vorgeworfenem Verhalten, das Erschleichen von Leistungen (§ 265a StGB), die Urkundenfälschung (§ 267 StGB) oder der Betrug (§§ 263 StGB) in Betracht. **Weil die Strafbarkeit unabhängig vom Zivilrecht bewertet wird, entfällt sie auch nicht durch bloße Zahlung des erhöhten Beförderungsentgelts. Die Straftat wird auch nach Zahlung regelmäßig weiter verfolgt.**


Or this here: 

http://www.ferner-alsdorf.de/rechtsanwalt/strafrecht/das-beruhmte-schwarzfahren/3481/

&gt;Damit ist schon einmal das erste Klar: Ein “Schwarzfahren” gibt es als tatbestand nicht, nur ein “Erschleichen von Leistungen”. Um diese eigentlich kurze Regelung ranken sich nun derart viele Mythen, dass es schwer fällt, einen Einstieg zu finden. Ich versuche der Reihe nach die verbreitetsten Mythen aufzugreifen:

&gt;Zivilrecht, Strafrecht – Uh?



&gt;**Als erstes muss man unterscheiden zwischen den zivilrechtlichen Ansprüchen und evt. strafrechtlichen Problemen. Wer schwarzfährt, muss ggfs. ein so genanntes “erhöhtes Beförderungsentgelt” bezahlen. Das hat aber nichts mit dem Strafrecht zu tun. Die Ansprüche des Verkehrsbetriebs auf Zahlung von Entgelt sind das eine, die Frage ob man ein Strafgesetz verletzt hat, ist eine andere Frage.**

true,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"First of all, you need to know the extent of the problem. Are we talking here about a few small groups of radicals, or is there somethng more dangerous afoot? Also, who, exactly, are these people targeting, and how?

Let's say, for example, that you discover they are targeting young Muslims in the hope of radicalising them. Your next step is to talk to the communities these targets come from: their families, their Imams, social workers, that sort of thing. You need to get them on your side, to understand the problem and to develop strategies to counter it. Education is going to be a very important key here; typically, if you're going to radicalise somebody, you're going to take advantage of their ignorance and perhaps a sense of isolation (often people who are radicalised in this way are first or second generation immigrants, born in Germany but still don't feel they belong to Germany), convince them that they lack a specific thing, then promise them that thing, all the while drip-feeding them with virulant propaganda.

I once interviewed an old gentleman who was a schoolboy in the Nazi period. He remembered with fondness a Jesuit priest, who used to hold special ""religious"" classes, where he asked the children what they'd been taught in school, and then explained what was wrong with all the Nazi propaganda, unpicking absolutely everything and, as he put it, inoculating them against it. This is the sort of thing you really need to do.

Obviously, that alone is not nearly enough. You also need to investigate these groups very, very thoroughly. They are quite likely to have connections with terrorist groups, and these might have a massive organisation behind them. You need to try to locate any cells that are in Germany; but this will require covert surveillance and infiltration (it's possible this is actually happening, but this information won't be made public or even hinted at, because it would jeopardise everything). You need to liaise with your counterparts in other countries, because obviously this will be an international organisation.

Basically, the people wandering about the streets in orange jackets are the symptom of a problem, like an infectious rash.

These treaties sometimes give competences to the EU, but still most discussions are diplomatic-type, not legal-type, in the sense that all countries must individually say 'yes' to any decision and they may opt out of things they don't like (UK and the Euro, for example). Enforcement always comes in the form of withrawal of future access to funds. There is still no european citizenship, european rights, european sovereign land, or anything like that.

For example, instead of having a constitution saying ""EU citizens have right to healthcare"", we have a Spanish constitution saying ""Spanish citizens have right to healthcare"", a French constitution ""French citizens...""; and on top of all that an EU treaty that says ""Any member state shall give any citizen of other member state residing in its territory the healthcare rights of its own citizens"".

Within this framework, I think the EU has no enforcement power to make Spain let Catalonia leave, but they can ""strongly recommend"" a reform of the state and fine Spain if they do not complish.

The big issue, both at Catalonian, Spanish and European levels, is that everything is grey areas: there is no clear yes/no answer.

Fruits: There's a lot of apples, pears, damson plums and [quinces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quince) to be eaten, made into jelly, cakes/tarts, marmelade, juice or Obstbrand (Fruit-schnaps). An autumn beverage I find very delicious is what we call [Sauser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federweisser) in Switzerland. It's slightly fermented grape juice. Not normal grape juice, but also not wine yet.

As in most other countries too mushrooms are popular food in autumn, either in a gravy or sautéed.

Venison in all forms is also a typical food in autumn. Mostly deer and boar. Either prepared with a gravy and a side of cooked red cabbage,  [Spätzli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%A4tzle) and glazed chestnuts, or as sausages and cold meats like [this](http://media05.regionaut.meinbezirk.at/2011/07/19/2199041_web.jpg?1311108251).

We must sometimes distinguish between te urgent and the important, and make a balance.

Re: Galician, the proportion is about 51% Spanish, 49% Galician. But Geographically it is 5%/95%. Basically everybody speaks Spanish in the 5 big cities and nobody in the countriside. In theory they have to teach 40-60% in each language, but this is only enforced on the rural side. Meanwhile, in the cities, teachers ignore the law sistematically and teach even Galician class in Spanish. You hear many disheartening stories, like people who get a 7 in Galician in Selectividad but can't speak a sentence (they learn it like Latin or like some Irish learn Gaelic), or the parents who don't want their kid to repeat a course and say to the director ""He only failed Galician, and he doesn't need to know it for any practical purpose"".

The big issue with ""Galicia Bilingüe"" a few years ago wasn't that they were arguing for ""the right to school your children in the language of your choice"". This is what they said, but what everybody read between the lines was ""the right to not have my children's academic transcript diminished because I taught them that Galician is an inferior language and they shouldn't learn it"".

EDIT: Another story: One of the protestors from Galicia Bilingüe literally said ""You can not teach math in Galician.

If you look at the two leaders we had b4 Merkel, they were both full of action and big words and they were charismatic in a way, they had their own goals and they pushed them.

However if you look at Merkels entire carrier, she mostly does problem solving instead of springing to action, friends of hers have said, she would go through every possible thing she could do, and try to to live a day as if that was the desicion she had chooses, also beeing the physicist that she is, she would get as much data on the subject as possible.

That leads to slower, more deliberate actions, but the absence of impulsive fast actions can make her seem emotionless and can give you the impression that she is just waiting things out, eventhough she is taken desicive action, just slower and after long consideration.

She has no realy agenda, she just looks at everything and decides what she thinks is the best, she is even able to do a 180° if new circumstances suggest that another action is superior.

I actually kinda like that style tbh.

Now I just want to stress that I don't aggree with all the actions she has taken, just that general style of politics is very intriguing to me.

So a lot depends upon your negotiating skills and how you go about it. It is also not the HRE's problem if you sign a contract with a lower salary than what you orally agreed upon.

It's not perfect or impenetrable, but I think it could have been a good idea. Í think the main problems are that; Ukraine can't afford it. Ukraine won't be able to finish it in time since they are already losing territory. Ukraine cannot build a wall across rebel held territory where it is most important.

Ukraine is already trying everything to secure the border, whenever it seems like Ukraine is close to winning we hear about Russia giving out more assistance and Ukraine being pushed further out of the region. 

Ukraine has tried many times to get into NATO, while most of the west want Ukraine to win this, it probably won't happen because NATO is a defensive alliance. They cannot just hand out memberships to countries in conflict so they can solve their problems; that would make it aggressive, it would invalidate the membership process (countries in conflict will want to join, not those who genuinely want to contribute), and it would force all of the west to engage in direct conflict with Russia, their biggest gas supplier &amp; a nuclear power.

1. All'uscita del treno potresti incontrare delle persone che ti offrono il loro servizio ""taxi"". Ti porteranno dove vuoi, a un costo ridottissimo, ma sono abusivi senza licenza, quindi a te la scelta.


2. Raggiungere il molo dalla stazione Garibaldi a piedi non è difficilissimo, ma per due persone anziane con bagagli può risultare piuttosto faticoso, specialmente se è una giornata calda; si può prendere la linea 2 della metro direttamente in stazione (come consigliava /u/doxep ) ma è sempre molto affollata, oppure se si ha qualcosina in più da spendere meglio taxi.


3. Al ritorno prestare un po' più attenzione alla zona dei moli (via marina) che di sera non è proprio il massimo. Ma se non esponi ori incensi e mirre vai tranquillo.
In linea generica la stazione non è chissà quale brutta zona, anzi, decisamente meglio rispetto a qualche anno fa. Semplicemente basta avere le accortenze e il buonsenso che avresti in ogni stazione di una grande città italiana.


4. I traghetti, soprattutto nel weekend, soprattutto in belle giornate, sono come l'arca di Noè: affollatissimi e pieni di ogni genere di animale. Ma niente di pericoloso, semplicemente un po claustrofobico. Poi magari gli dice culo che c'è poca gente e i tuoi genitori si godono anche una bella passeggiata via mare con uno dei panorami più belli del mondo.

Wer für eine freie Gesellschaft kämpft, kämft eben oft auch *für* ihre Gegener. Das kann nach hinten losgehen. 

&gt; Man hat es so weit gebracht, dass der Hass mittlerweile an deutschen Schulen unterrichtet wird, das Antisemitismus in Deutschland wieder geduldet wird, man hat sogar Gesetze eingeführt, welche die barbarische Genitalverstümmelung von Kindern straffrei stellen, nur um den Anhängern dieses Aberglaubens ... ja was eigentlich zu geben?

Weiss nicht.

&gt; Von dem Nazi verlangt man ständig, dass er sich ans Grundgesetz halte und die Menschenwürde achtet, vom Mohammedaner wünscht man sich, dass er seine Kultur hier auslebt und Zustände wie in seinem Land schafft, denn diese Menschen mit ihrer vielfältigen Kultur sind ja eine Bereicherung für uns alle.

Nee, sehe ich nicht so, und ich denke, die meissten links/liberal denkenden Menschen auch nicht. Man erwartet von allen, die hier leben, dass sie sich an's Grundgesetz halten. Und das soll auch das Kriterium sein, wenn man irgendwen beurteilt: Was er/sie tut, nicht, was er/sie glaubt.  

&gt; Wieso diese doppelten Standards? Was ist falsch daran von einem Mohamedaner die Achtung der gleichen Gesetze zu fordern? Von ihm Toleranz zu verlangen? Ihn genau so hart zu bestrafen wie nicht Abergläubige?

Wenn es da doppelte Standards gibt, dann ist das nicht gut. 

&gt; Dieser vorauseilende Gehorsam, nur nie in den Verdacht zu kommen man könnte ja rassistisch sein und deshalb die Mohamedaner mit Samthandschuhen anzufassen, macht aus denen keine besseren Menschen.

Ich würde nicht zwischen Islam und Rest unterscheiden, sondern von Fanatikern sprechen. Die gibt es überall. 

&gt; Und ich weiß, gleich werden mir hier wieder alle erzählen wie toll es sich doch mit dem Islamischen Nachbarn lebt, der seine Frau unter einen Schleier zwingt, einer deutschen Frau nicht die Hand reicht, auf Schwule schimpft, Segregation von Frauen und Männern fordert, ein Joch von dem wir uns nach hunderte Jahre langem Kampf endlich verabschiedet haben.

Genauso toll wie mit dem deutschen Spießer, der seine Frau hinter den Herd zwingt usw. 

&gt; Stellt euch einfach mal vor ein Rechtspopulist verhält sich so. Oder ein Neonazi. Oder jemand von der AfD. Was hier los wäre, wie alle zetern und schreien würden. Wenn das aber ein Moslem macht, dann ist das völlig okay. Meine Güte, diese Heuchelei.

Aber das stimmt doch nicht, oder? Und wenn doch, dann sind wir gerade dabei, das zu ändern. Siehe Schariah-Polizei. Da schaltet sich sogar der Innenminaziere ein. 

&gt; Ich will hier noch was anmerken. Das gilt im Übrigen für jeden Aberglauben und jede Gruppe von Menschen. All die Freiheiten für die hier geblutet wurde sollten nicht für Appeasement aufgegeben werden.

Hmm, Freiheit IST Appeasement, ein Stück weit zumindest. Und ""Freiheit"" ist auch eine Art Aberglaube. 

Aber im Ernst: Sehe mich als ""Verfassungspatrioten"" (hätte ich auch nie gedacht, sowas mal zu sagen) am eher linken Ende des erlaubten Spektrums. Wenn Links-Rechts überhaupt bei diesen Fragen Sinn macht. Viele Probleme, mit denen unsere Gesellschaft konfrontiert ist, sind jünger als die Links-Rechts-Unterscheidung, und viele Haltungen wurden mal der einen, mal der anderen Seite zugeschrieben. Zur Zeit ist da wieder viel Bewegung. 

Aus linksnaiver Perspektive ist es so, dass man dem Islam mit der Haltung der sozialen Gerechtigkeit und
Chancengleichheit begegnen wollte, um heute zu sehen, dass ein großer Teil des Islam Ideen vertritt, die man als Linker als ""rechts"" empfindet. Und als Rechter ist man vielleicht angepisst, dass die eigenen Ideen radikal abgelehnt werden, aber bei den Moslems ein Auge zugedrückt wird.

You aren't representing the whole story either though. We've got room here so lets get the entire exchange you are quoting. 

&gt;[...]  
ANNA SAZONOVA: Yes, it has a different name now.

&gt;Everybody is talking about nationalism in Ukraine nowadays. However, we are concerned about a different situation, namely the growth of nationalistic sentiments in Kazakhstan, in the south of that country in particular. In our view the acting President, Mr Nazarbayev is the main restraining factor here. An adequate perception by Kazakhs of Russian political rhetoric is also an issue. This is obvious from the internet, from the activities of public organisations and in personal conversations.

&gt;Our question is should we expect developments in Kazakhstan to follow the Ukrainian scenario should Mr Nazarbayev leave his post? Is there any strategy designed to prevent this? We have some proposals; we would like to join this work, if possible. What are the prospects for Eurasian integration?

&gt;And on a personal note, I would like to say you look well, this cardigan suits you very well. Thank you.

&gt;VLADIMIR PUTIN: So this is a cardigan? (Laughs) Ok. Thank you for the compliment.

&gt;Here is what I can say about Kazakhstan. It is our closest strategic ally and partner. First, President Nazarbayev is alive and well, and, thank god, has no intention of resigning; however, being the wise and experienced leader that he is, he is always concerned about the future of his country.

&gt;As for some individual comments on the internet and some discussions with citizens of Kazakhstan – naturally, people are different and they may express different views. In population that country is about ten times smaller than Russia, its population is about 15 million, but by European standards this is a large country. However, I am convinced that a vast majority of the citizens of Kazakhstan favour stronger ties with Russia. We see this and we know it.

&gt;As you may know, Mr Nazarbayev is a very wise leader, I believe he is the wisest on the post-Soviet space, and he would never go against the will of his people. He can feel what his people expect of him. Therefore, everything that has been done lately – largely due to his talent of an organiser and his political expertise – is all in the interests of Kazakhstan as a state.

&gt;I already said that he has performed a unique feat: he has created a state on a territory where there has never been a state. The Kazakhs never had a state of their own, and he created it. In this sense, he is a unique person on the post-Soviet space and in Kazakhstan. However, I would like to repeat, that this is not about him, but about the sentiments of the people, of the vast majority of society.

&gt;So now, we are working to create the Customs Union, the Common Economic Space and the Eurasian Union – which, by the way, was his idea. I have to admit that he was the one who came up with the idea, not I. And we are helping; we got involved in this effort and are bringing it to a logical close. Philosophers know where this idea of a Eurasian union came from and how it developed, who supported it in Russia. The Kazakhs picked it up proceeding from the understanding that it is good for their economy, it helps them stay within the so-called ‘greater Russian world’, which is part of world civilisation, it is good for the development of their industry, of advanced technologies and so forth. I am convinced that this will continue in the same vein for the mid- and long historical term.

http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/22864

The most complete version of Nazarbayev's later response I can find is:

&gt;""If the rules set forth in the agreement are not followed, Kazakhstan has a right to withdraw from the Eurasian Economic Union. I have said this before and I am saying this again. Kazakhstan will not be part of organizations that pose a threat to our independence. Our independence is our dearest treasure, which our grandfathers fought for. First of all, we will never surrender it to someone, and secondly, we will do our best to protect it,"" the President said.
 
&gt;Many say that Kazakhstan will be discriminated in the Eurasian Union, but ""that's not true. When the Presidents of Kazakhstan, Russia and Belarus get together to make decisions, if any one of the three is against something, the decision is not made. This is called consensus. If I do not like their decision, I will speak up against it, and it will not be adopted. This means that we all have equal rights,“ Nursultan Nazarbayev said.
 
&gt;""In the Eurasian Economic Commission, there are three representatives from each country and three Vice-Prime-Ministers. They also make their decisions together. The same applies to meetings of the heads of governments,"" the President concluded.

On the face of it you are I think correct that Nazarbayev himself is being misrepresented as feeling threatened and as threatening to leave the Eurasian Union. It looks like what he meant is ""we are not being threatened, I wouldn't allow us to be part of an organisation that threatened our independence.""

However just looking at the face of it might miss subtext and context.  
Why did Putin and/or his handlers allow that question?  
Particularly why this format which specifically couches Kazakh opposition to Russia in the context of Ukrainian opposition to Russia?  
Why does Nazarbeyev response leave room to be misinterpreted as responding to a threat?  

My answers would be that the subtext and context is that it is a fully deniable threat. The threat is towards those who would wish to depose Nazarbeyev. The suggestion is that without Nazarbeyev there would be no Kazakhstan but he purposely leaves out the conclusion of the threat of what would happen if Nazarbeyev was no longer in power. Yes he mentions the sentiments of the majority is what matters **but** only after clearly stating that those sentiments are pro-Russian. This is, I think, to make it sound like he respects the will of the majority but the threat underneath is that he only respects those sentiments.

Nazarbeyev's response, which I wouldn't be surprised if it was prepared in conjunction with Putin's response to the question, is designed to be balanced for the Kazakh audience. It gives him a chance to stand up to Putin in front of nationalists but at the same time attempts to allay their fears of the Eurasian Union. It says at the same time a nationalist ""Russia can't bully us"" and a pro-Russian ""Russia isn't trying to and won't bully us"".",0,1410006836,null,0,false,0,ckapef5,t3_2fmk9l,t1_ckapef5,t1_ckao53g,null,1427169581,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5
