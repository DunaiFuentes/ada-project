Our defence minister recently made a pledge to save a ton of money because the forces can't sustain their current state without increasing the budget. Some even think the Austrian armed forces are on the verge of collapsing.

Our latest change in military policy was to make military service ""more fun"" for conscripts.

Our latest big procurement should have been about two dozens of modern multi-role jets. We ended up with a dozen (half of them used) Typhoon fighters that are effectively barred from air to ground missions and a huge corruption case.

Our trainer / light bomber planes are some of the oldest in the western world and should have been replaced a decade ago but we don't have the money for it so we quietly keep flying these museum pieces.

We also need new light APCs, new helicopters, new utility vehicles and a lot of our other equipment is older than the oldest people serving.

We like to tell ourselves that we are non-aligned or even neutral but the fact is we could barely keep up our territorial integrity against anyone or anything and should be worried about Liechtenstein-ian bankers invading us.

I might be slightly biased but I am not a super militarist. I don't think we should spend huge amounts of money that could be used wiser otherwise but I think we should keep a military force that can perform tasks if needed.

This I saw as well. But you cannot forget those of us Europeans who also point out that our governments are even worse in helping the US. Which you also see on this subreddit.

&gt;[..]but as soon as Russia stops fucking around, the subreddit expects the United States to intervene.

Many expect the US to take a leadership role, not a neccessary military one. 

In any case, how do you know that those who, at times unfairly, at times without looking at their own governments first, criticise the US aren't simply not writing now and it is those who do think the US is a viable ally might are now speaking up?

In Tsar Ukraine, everything was owned by a very small elite and the common folks had nothing.

In sovjet Ukraine everything was owned by a very small political elite and the common folks had nothing.

At the fall of the sovjet union everything was owned by a very small elite that bought everything up and looting the governments money, and the common folk had nothing.

A parte far fare servizi del telegiornale per chissà quanto, l'oscar a la grande bellezza non servirà a nulla.

E poi ha vinto non un film, ma una certa visione di Roma e della romanità, superficiale e da cartolina. Il solito ritratto autoindulgente però tanto poetico, signora mia.

Hanno vinto cose che mi fanno orrore, e di cui non ci libereremo più.

Benigni ci abbiamo messo dieci anni per togliercelo dai coglioni al cinema, proprio dopo che l'Oscar aveva premiato il suo più brutto film, non per gli sprazzi di comicità surreale, ma per il buonismo mellassoso e revisionista. Su cui poi ha infatti imperniato le altre merde che ha girato.

I'd remind them that despite the UK being terrified of war we did end up fighting it anyway. It needs to be understood, privately and publicly where the line lays. Then there needs to be no quibbling over it.

Much could be gained by integrating the European defence market further, instead of having 28 different defence markets. This leads to significant inefficiences and waste of money that could go towards actual defence capabilities. In addition, we do not need 28 armies, air forces and navies that, more or less, are trying to uphold most, if not all, core capabilities themselves, especially when some countries' budgets are just too small to have any meaningful capacity anyway. 

EU member states should develop the confidence to specialise in certain areas and rely on other member states to fill the gaps that such a specialisation would create. The Czech Armed Forces, for example, have a specialty in CBRN capabilities if my memory serves me right, so if other member states could rely on this, they could reduce their own CBRN troops and spend the money on something the Czech Armed Forces cannot provide - a capable navy would be one example. But it could be more fine-grained.

This requires significant political and legal effort so that situations like we saw during the Libya intervention do not happen again where one member states - Germany - withdrew its AWACS crews from the operation because of domestic political concerns, depriving other states of the intelligence capabilities of these aircraft (Germany is not the only country with these capabilities, but there are only two or three others). It demonstrated to e.g. Britain and France that Germany is (was) not a reliable partner and could not be depended on.

They sent just three guys in a suit, and Russia is totally panicking and feels the need to resort to send a whole *army* to regain lost influence. I wouldn't call that inadequacy.

&gt;but I have the impression that without having a coordinated strong response to the events EU will not make any difference in finding a solution to the Ukraine crisis.

What do you want them to do? Send an army and turn Ukraine in a battleground? I don't think that would be a sensible option.

So far the EU is living up to its pacifist rhetoric, so they're gaining credibility, while Russia is seen as untrustworthy (playing the sovereignity card in Syria but ignoring that in Ukraine). Yanukovich seemed to be impossible to remove too, but where is he now? Not in the presidential seat.

The new government consists largely of moderates and so does the parliament, where Svoboda only has 10 %.

Let's go through the new Ukrainian government one by one and see how right wing radical it is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Ministers_of_Ukraine#Cabinet

The cabinet has 17 minister posts, including the PM, and Svoboda holds 4 of these. Obviously we don't need to go through the four Svoboda ministers, since we know their ugly views already. 

Then there are 6 members of Batkivshchyna (Fatherland), which we know is a pro-EU moderate party, so we don't have to go through them either. 

There are 3 Euromaidan activists who have become ministers:

* Health Minister Oleg Musiy was in charge of medical services for protesters during the rebellion. He played a key role in putting in place secret clinics to treat wounded patients. Many young people responded to his call for young medical students to come and help deal with the treatment of protesters.

* Culture Minister Yevgen Nyshchuk a well known actor who played a prominent role in the 2004 Orange Revolution but then kept his distance from politics, apparently disappointed with the results of that uprising. This time he has emerged again as the main speaker and animator for the demonstrators on Independence Square.

* Sports and Youth Minister Dmytro Bulatov was an active member of the so-called ""Avtomaidan"" of activists who used their cars for protests against Yanukovych. He was abducted in January, only reappearing a more than a week later after being tortured and beaten. His case became a symbol of repression of activists.

[Source](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10665800/Ukraines-new-government-Whos-who.html)

None of the above are known to be right wing radicals.

Then there are the non-affiliated:

* Foreign minister Andrii Deshchytsia is a Ukrainian diplomat and politician, who has served as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Ukraine to Finland and Iceland and as Special Representative of OSCE Chairperson-in-Office for Conflict Resolution - Not known to be a right wing radical, and with those credentials it would be very strange if he was. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Deshchytsia). 

* Minister of Finance Oleksandr Shlapak has a distinguished career in Ukrainian finance and economics and has served as a minister and public official in previous governments - Definitely not a right wing radical. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksandr_Shlapak).

* Minister of Economy Pavlo Petrenko is educated in the US, he founded the economic school at the Kyiv Mohyla Academy and until now was head of the Kiev School of Economics - Not known as a right wing radical. [Source](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10665800/Ukraines-new-government-Whos-who.html).

* Education Minister Serhiy Kvit has worked as President of Kyiv-Mohyla University since 2007. The school is considered one of the best in Ukraine, but has not developed much in 2007. **Kvit has been a member of right-wing organizations in Ukraine**, and an ardent enemy of previous Education Minister Dmytro Tabachnyk - Now he is a right winger, although we don't know how much. [Source](http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/op-ed/katya-gorchinskaya-the-not-so-revolutionary-new-ukraine-government-337768.html).

* Minister of Energy is **Russian-born** Yuriy Prodan. He had already been in this job under President Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko in 2007-2010. [Source](http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/op-ed/katya-gorchinskaya-the-not-so-revolutionary-new-ukraine-government-337768.html)

Lastly, even though he is not a member of the cabinet, let's not forget that the President has a lot of power in Ukraine and that he is now [Oleksandr Turchynov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksandr_Turchynov), a moderate from Fatherland, who vetoed the repeal of the minority language law. As a side note, when parliament repealed the minority language law they did so on the promise that a new one would be enacted very soon.

It should also be noted that the powerful post of minister of internal affairs, which you would need to control if you actually wanted to persecute a minority, is held by the moderate Fatherland member Arsen Avakov.

*In conclusion*: Out of a cabinet of 17 posts there are 4 confirmed Svoboda members and 1 other minister, the minister of education, who is a right winger, although we don't know how much. The rest are moderates and pro-western. If anything the will of the new government to sign the EU association agreement should be proof of this, since Svoboda loathes the EU, as all extreme right wingers do. But Svoboda has seats in the cabinet, unfortunately, but that was needed to appease the right wingers. Who knows if they'll even be in the cabinet after the election? Probably not.

No, Putin is, as always, behaving like a ruthless thug, but a perfectly rational ruthless thug. Crimea is strategically very important to Russia, especially for naval reasons. If, for example, the Polish government could get away with annexing a strategically interesting region without major backlash, then they would, because it's a perfectly rational thing to do, and that's exactly what Russia is attempting now.

Right now, Russia is just profiting from a situation in which is MIGHT be possible to annex a strategically interesting region without negative consequences that outweigh the benefits, which is perfectly rational, and also why I'm convinced that they'll back down as soon as becomes clear that the backlash will outweigh the benefits, which isn't the case yet.

Basically, on of two things can happen, either the EU remains relatively passive and Russia takes Crimea, or the EU start applying serious(economic) pressure and Russia will back down, quite simply because it isn't worth it anymore. Anything else is very implausable. Russia is economically very dependent on the EU, we could basically bleed them dry if we wanted to, and they are perfectly aware of the fact that they are not a superpower anymore.

Truth is, Yanukovich was deposed of power through violence.

And the fact that Yanukovich was elected by a majority of ukrainians was a reason of why he shouldn't have been thrown over by violence.

Dazu zwei Sachen:

1) Es ist ein Bürgerkrieg. Natürlich hat Assad Leute, die ihn unterstützen bzw. sogar eine ganze Volksgruppe hinter sich. Die Tatsache, dass Demonstrationen stattfinden, bedeutet daher praktisch nichts.

2) Auch ich hab hier einen deutschen Armeeparka. Und einen niederländischen. Mit Flaggen.

Russia sent 6k troops (according to news reports) to a region of a sovereign nation where they have, by treaty, the right to have 25k troops stationed but likely did not have that many. Said sovereign nation basically just revolted, and the new government had nothing better to do than announce that they were going to back out of that treaty (which was re-negotiated and extended by the previous government) and reduce the rights of the Russian majority in the region (although that law didn't make it because Ukraine's acting president had the good sense to veto it).

&gt; Putin accepted Merkel's proposal to establish a ""fact-finding mission"" like a contact group, possibly under the leadership of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), to start a political dialogue, the spokesman said.

Shortly afterwards it turns out that Merkel made a comment about Putin's grip on reality in a phone call with Obama.  The leak was attributed to 'US reports' by the [Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/03/ukraine-vladimir-putin-angela-merkel-russian)

&gt; US reports said Merkel phoned Barack Obama on Sunday evening after speaking to the Russian president to press him to back down from his invasion of Ukraine and occupation of the Crimean peninsula.

&gt; ""She was not sure he was in touch with reality, people briefed on the call said. 'In another world,' she said,"" the New York Times reported.

Based on that it's reasonable to speculate that the US leaked the call, I think.  We can speculate further about their motives:  this crisis has the potential to drive a wedge between the US and EU (and Putin's well aware of this) because our interests are divergent.  The US is working to keep Merkel away from the Russians (and by extension, firmly in the US camp).

I beg to differ. A lot. 

I don't think that the atmosphere and the sentiment of what's going on is soon to die down even if there's no war.
How's Russia actually profiting from this situation AND this sentiment? I understand that you don't expect the West to really do anything and let Russia get away with it? Because this is the only scenario with no major repercussions for Russia. In any other scenario, Putin is just putting his country in a very bad position internationally. **This** is what I call irrational and desperate. I'm not talking about a nuclear war, I'm talking about how detrimental this behaviour is for Russia itself - providing that the West will ""remember"".
Don't get me wrong, I don't think Putin is an idiot, I think it is quite the opposite. But if you think about such options as Russia being left out of G8, WTO and other organizations, distancing Ukraine more than it is necessary, personal visa bans for Russian oligarchs, weakening of the ruble, asset freezes, investors pulling out, a perspective of the West getting off the Russian gas addiction (it IS quite possible) and last but not least - something that might seem rather impossible but more impossible things happened before in Russia - Russian people getting tired of his internal and foreign politics, well, with such options in mind, his actions might seem rather irrational, don't you think? Or there's something much bigger going on, but I can't imagine what if nuke war is not an option for anyone.

&gt; without Sevastopol Russia has no ""mainland"" warm water naval base

One of Russia's largest commercial ports is in Novorossiysk, another warm water port on the Black Sea. Russia started expanding/moving the Black Sea Fleet there a while back when it wasn't clear yet whether the lease on the Sevastopol base could be extended.

&gt; By 2013 that had risen to US $430 per 1000 cubic meters.

Correct, but in December 2013 they [lowered it to $268](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17_December_2013_Ukrainian%E2%80%93Russian_action_plan). 

It's perhaps interesting to note here that because of the high prices, Ukraine imported some natural gas from Germany at just below $400 per 1000 m^3. Also note that the price has gone as high as $600 in the recent past, which Ukraine never had to pay.

&gt; Ukrainians saw a 50% price hike in their gas utility bills in 2010 and significant increases every year since then.

1) Na, wenn ich da diverse Meiden lese muss ich den Eindruck bekommen dass Assad sich mit Waffengewalt und ausschließlich durch Unterstürzung v. Russland und Iran gegen den Willen aller an der Macht hält. (Gespräche mit deutschen Freunden, die das Thema nicht intensiv verfolgen, bestätigen das.) Das ist aber nicht der Fall, da Assad sehr wohl einen großen Rückhalt in der Bevölkerung hat, und vermutlich die größte Fraktion auch bei fairen Wahlen erhalten würde.


2) Klar, wenn man will kommt man an alles. Und wenn nicht näht man halt die Flagge selber drauf. Es ist aber viel wahrscheinliche, dass eine Lieferung von ""non-lethal aid"" an ""moderate"" Rebellengruppen schiefging, genauso wie die Mehrzahl der amerikanischen Direktlieferungen von Waffen (siehe Vorwürfe an Idriss).


Aber auch darum geht es mir gar nicht, es ist nämlich egal wie genau es war, wenn es das ist was bei Jugendlichen die Runde macht, schadet das dem dt. Ansehen ungemein. Und einen (kritischen) Bericht wären solche Sachen allemal wert.


Und dass DE *vorsätzlich* an AQ liefert glaubt hoffentlich keiner.


3) Gar nicht, deshalb gehen die Schätzungen so auseinander. Es gibt diverse ""Umfragen"", allerdings wurden die in Flüchtlingslagern durchgeführt, weshalb man noch viel Höhere, aber vollkommen unbrauchbare Ergebnisse bekommt.

Do you remember how when protests were huge in Kiev, there was quite a popular opinion among redditors that the west should do something, that they should send in troops to overthrow Yanukovich and preserve peace. The point is that many people are very interventionist when it suits their beliefs and interests, but not when they are not in their own interest or conforms to their beliefs.

Another example would be human rights. We the west, tend to see the human rights through a very simple paradigm, that people must be free to speak and act as they wish (at least i hope we do). Others see human rights in a different way, that people have a right in having a job, a house and what to eat.

I mean Jokes aside, I am happy that France was and is able to take decisive actions in the African conflicts. It was the right thing to do. 

Right now, Germany’s Foreign Minister and Defense Minister are actively pushing for more adequate German involvement. I too believe that modern Germany has to take more responsibility and actively carry it's fair share. 

But besides the general public opposing more military involvement, our Military has some serious identity issues caused in part by political division, laws and historical reminiscences. Honestly, even for me, the idea of having a powerful offensive army feels kind of wrong. I think it’s going to be easier for Germans to participate in establishing a EU Force with offensive capabilities than to change everything else...

Furthermore, until 2011 Germany’s military heavily relied on the draft. The Idea that you expect to get good soldiers by taking fresh recruits right after school and teach them “war” for few month, seems silly to me… “Go Hans, shoot the bad guy…”

I mean if anyone is going to build up a real army again, it has to be really badass. I am talking 'Liam Neeson type badass professional soldiers… trained, respected and feared like Roman Legionaries once.

And Crimea is hardly the only claim Russia has. Within each bordering state there is a strong ethnic Russian presence: Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Baltic states, Uzbekistan, Kyrgystan. Almost each of these nations will eventually have to suffer political turmoil to overcome stagnant regimes. And in each case Russia can use the same excuse to intervene: ethnic Russians are in trouble, we must station troops.

Except, of course, for the Baltic states. And they have been hardly *accommodating* for ethnic Russians; in none of the three is Russian an official language despite the strong presence of Russian speakers. Indeed the Russians for long have threatened strong action against the Baltic states, accusing each Baltic nation of being neo-nazis, russophobes, anti-semites or anything in between (sounds familiar?). But did they invade in the interests of ethnic Russians? No. That is not an option considering the Baltic states are both EU and NATO members. Instead the Russians oft for more sane and acceptable measures to address their grievances; diplomatic influence, economic posturing, etc.

Che per me è la cosa più imperdonabile. Il pensiero che le giovani generazioni vengano su credendo che ""A Fra', che te serve?"" l'abbia detto Vittorio Sbardella mi leva il sonno.

Più in generale, credo che il problema dei registi che si mettono a fare i film di politica recente sia proprio quello di partire da quest'idea che la storia da sola non valga il biglietto e che sia pertanto necessario romanzarla, indirizzarla, volere farle significare per forza qualcosa che sta nella testa del regista e che fuori di lì non esiste. Il caso di scuola è *Buongiorno notte*, che alla fine non è la storia di Moro, non è la controstoria Moro ma è un mischione dove entra di tutto incluso Moro che a un bel momento se ne va a zonzo per Roma coi Pink Floyd in sottofondo. Confronta questo (o *Piazza delle Cinque Lune*, che è ugualmente disonesto e delirante ma che almeno prende un teorema e lo porta fino in fondo) col *Caso Moro* di Ferrara e la conclusione viene da sé.

Attenzione, con questo non voglio dire che l'unico approccio possibile da parte del cinema alla materia storico-politica debba essere quello rigorista.

Nah, but on South Ossetian soil, and they're required to stay out of there by a peace treaty they themselves signed. There's some validity to Georgia's claim on South Ossetia, but ignoring the minority rights of the people living there and waging a war against them isn't the smartest of things if they actually want to have it. Same goes for Abkhazia, though with vastly different details.

The whole situation is eerily reminiscent of Kurdistan. Strategic mountain ranges and ethnic differences. Seen from that POV Russia has no interest in either South Ossetia or Abkhazia, as they're both on the wrong side of the Caucasus, and I don't really believe the Russians started independence movements in those regions for fun. Otherwise, they'd be better at integrating them into Russia proper and keeping them complacent, like they're doing with Chechnia, with lots and lots of independence (but in foreign affairs) and money.

Si può dibattere sul fatto che magari ci vuole una certa distanza prima di poter romanzare, ma in America ormai non si pongono più quei problemi da mo (guarda l'esempio di Zero Dark Thirty, ormai siamo all'instant war movie, e di qualità).

Il Divo mi è sembrato più sbagliato che brutto, un po' come altri film di Sorrentino manca di coerenza e sbarella un po' qua e là senza mai trovare un terreno solido.

Forse abbiamo l'idea della politica e della storia di qualcosa troppo sacrale, io invece voglio la carnazza al cinema, e dagli americani dovremmo imparare che si può scrivere il mito e l'epopea anche usando i grigi democristiani.

Ukraine has [some limited gas production mostly over in Karkov region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas_in_Ukraine). There is also some storage but the key point is that both Rostov and the whole Krasnodor region (where Sochi is located) gets its gas from Siberia, but via Ukraine.

In Soviet times Ukraine was the headquarters of whatever Gazprom was in those days. It was in the middle of the gas network. Even with Northstream and Southstream (not there yet), the pipelines and storage in Ukraine remain over immense significance.

Germany hasn't been able to participate in military actions largely because of treaties and conditions put on them by World War 2. It does however have a well equipped, well organized, highly professional army, and they work closely together with both the Dutch and French armies. 

I'd be surprised if they'd sit idly by when the shit hits the fan. Especially because I've heard explosions coming from Zwolle's live round exercise area (tank/howitzer/apc training ground for Dutch/German armed forces) and an increase in training flights for the Dutch F16's in the North.

As /u/crouchingtiger has pointed out your facts are not correct. You might have been thinking about the other agreement, the truce, which was made on the 18th of February. [See timeline here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2014_Euromaidan_riots#Timeline_of_the_events).

&gt; Truth is, Yanukovich was deposed of power through violence.

That is a controversial claim. Parliament voted Yanukovich out of power after several Party of Regions MPs shifted allegiances after they saw how brutal and bloody the crackdown became. And who can blame them? Killing protestors on that scale completely removes your legitimacy, elected or not. 

The question is how much pressure were the MPs under when they shifted their allegiances? Were they forced in a way which would make their votes ineligible because they were hostages? The protestors never entered the parliament, so it was not like they had a gun to their head forcing them to vote out Yanukovitch. Many Party of Regions MPs still supported Yanukovitch at the vote. Later the party would completely denounce him. 

Here is what some of the Party of Regions MPs said themselves when they changed their allegiance:

&gt; Party of Regions MP Sergiy Tigipko called for the resignation of Parliament Speaker Volodymyr Rybak (to be replaced by an opposition parliamentarian) and the urgent election of a prime minister supported by all factions. According to Tigipko ""The president, the parliament speaker, the acting prime minister and opposition leaders have completely lost control of the situation in the country and do not offer any solutions to pacify the country. Their inaction is leading to increased confrontation and deaths.[156] Immediate concrete steps, rather than negotiations, are needed to resolve the crisis in the country"".[156] In the evening Tigipko held talks with opposition politicians Arseniy Yatsenyuk and Vitali Klitschko.[157]
Head of the Kiev City State Administration Volodymyr Makeyenko and 17 MP's resigned from the ruling Party of Regions.[158] In Rivne and Zhytomyr, the Party of Regions formally disbanded with all MPs from these regions leaving the party as well.

[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2014_Euromaidan_riots#Ukrainian_political_developments)

The reason your claim is controversial is that if Yanukovich was indeed deposed through violence, and not through legitimate parliamentary procedure, then there can be doubt about the current government's legitimacy, which is also the narrative of the Russian government at the moment. However, personally I don't see any proof that the parliamentary procedure was not carried out in a legitimative fashion.

Even if it wasn't you'd still have the problem of Yanukovich being an illegitimate President, having ordered the killing of so many protestors. [See this video of protestors being shot, for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joIi5T3xpfk&amp;feature=youtu.be) - don't watch it if you don't want to watch people being shot and killed on camera.

I honestly don't know if they can do that, but I don't think they have done it ever before. Which is why I didn't put them up there because they haven't done it yet.

Germany hasn't had the will to commit do these actions ever before. They have an impressive air force who probably could at least move a considerable sized force to Ukraine and supply them and if not having air superiority at least seriously deterring anyone else from trying. But as I said, they haven't and Russian gas is important to Germany. So maybe Germany technically could, but I don't think they will.

Russia buys very little from the EU, but EU buys a lot from Russia (gas, mainly). It would be shitty expensive to buy something else, sure it could try but that would depend on which countries sided with Russia. No gas wouldn't be a major problem for another 10 months or so, but oil would.

That is a controversial claim. Parliament voted Yanukovich out of power after several Party of Regions MPs shifted allegiances after they saw how brutal and bloody the crackdown became. And who can blame them? Killing protestors on that scale completely removes your legitimacy, elected or not. 

The question is how much pressure were the MPs under when they shifted their allegiances? Were they forced in a way which would make their votes ineligible because they were hostages? The protestors never entered the parliament, so it was not like they had a gun to their head forcing them to vote out Yanukovitch. Many Party of Regions MPs still supported Yanukovitch at the vote. Later the party would completely denounce him. 

Here is what some of the Party of Regions MPs said themselves when they changed their allegiance:

&gt; Party of Regions MP Sergiy Tigipko called for the resignation of Parliament Speaker Volodymyr Rybak (to be replaced by an opposition parliamentarian) and the urgent election of a prime minister supported by all factions. According to Tigipko ""The president, the parliament speaker, the acting prime minister and opposition leaders have completely lost control of the situation in the country and do not offer any solutions to pacify the country. Their inaction is leading to increased confrontation and deaths.[156] Immediate concrete steps, rather than negotiations, are needed to resolve the crisis in the country"".[156] In the evening Tigipko held talks with opposition politicians Arseniy Yatsenyuk and Vitali Klitschko.[157]
Head of the Kiev City State Administration Volodymyr Makeyenko and 17 MP's resigned from the ruling Party of Regions.[158] In Rivne and Zhytomyr, the Party of Regions formally disbanded with all MPs from these regions leaving the party as well.

[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2014_Euromaidan_riots#Ukrainian_political_developments)

The reason your claim is controversial is that if Yanukovich was indeed deposed through violence, and not through legitimate parliamentary procedure, then there can be doubt about the current government's legitimacy, which is also the narrative of the Russian government at the moment. However, personally I don't see any proof that the parliamentary procedure was not carried out in a legitimative fashion.

Even if it wasn't you'd still have the problem of Yanukovich being an illegitimate President, having ordered the killing of so many protestors. [See this video of protestors being shot, for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joIi5T3xpfk&amp;feature=youtu.be) - don't watch it if you don't want to watch people being shot and killed on camera.

The first is because it was the first war with conscription, meaning innocent people died, not just people that had volunteered to be soldiers. Unfortunately, a lot of these men got sent to war to fight alongside their friends and neighbours, meaning some entire villages were wiped out of all their sons / husbands / fathers etc in a single day. Obviously that led these towns / cities to want to permenantly remember the war. 

Second, the date WW1 ended is definite, whereas the date WW2 ended on isn't. This led to Armistice day in the UK being held on the closing date of WW1, despite WW2 being the war people are generally thinking of when commemorating the war dead.

true,Dantemius,null,null,"I strongly agree that EU/NATO needs to reform in order to adapt to future challenges. But I also believe that we have to be really smart about identifying the real issues. 

E.g. You mentioned Russia’s invasions. I doubt that increased defense spending would have prevented Putin from going into Georgia in 2008. And I also don’t think that he just would have stud by while losing control over his base for the Black Sea Fleet. All those “aggressions” from Putin are calculated maneuvers to hold on to a weakening influence over the region. He knows that neither the EU nor the US would risk an open confrontation.
Therefore, I am not sure that a bigger budget would have help at all.
Also, consider the fact that currently the members of the European Union maintain more than 100,000 more active military personal than the USA: 1.5 Million.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_the_European_Union)
If we (EU) could coordinate our military resources and establish rules and command structures, we would be far more powerful than a collection of single NATO States just throwing more money at things that blow up.

Don’t get me wrong, I am not arguing that there might not be a need to spend more to address future security threats. But I feel it should be mandatory to ask on what are we spending the money on? 

In the End, I think the EU will learn from its uncoordinated and passive response to the whole Ukrainian crisis and become stronger.
On the other side, Putin might understand the economic reality of the 21 century. I mean, the stock market is punching him in the face right now.  (http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=MICEXINDEXCF.ME&amp;t=5d&amp;l=on&amp;z=l&amp;q=l&amp;c=)
And then, maybe someday he’ll experience civil unrest at home, once he realize that Russia’s Elite owns assets in the West, prefer to drive German cars, wear French suits with the stylish Italian belt and shoes, eating Scottish haggis (&lt;- not so sure about that), while playing X-Box on their Swedish couch. 
I don’t see them sustaining such a life-style once they have to ditch a worthless ruble in favor of a vodka and natural gas based economy.

And maybe we are not being creative enough in the way we approach possible solutions. 

Seriously, if we really want to take revenge on Putin, send Goldman Sachs in! Let them do their thing. And before you know it, Russia joins the EU in need for foreign aid.

&gt; Germany hasn't had the will to commit [t]o these actions ever before.

So, their recent peacekeeping missions were a fluke? As I said, Germany hasn't been allowed to put their army to the test outside of their own country because of (very understandable) repercussions following World War 2. In fact, their first peacekeeping mission (in Afghanistan I believe) was big news in The Netherlands. 

So, when it comes to military intervention, Germany will definitely be there in my opinion. The gas can be bought elsewhere (like in my country, Norway, the UK etc.), and every country has a strategic supply of oil. 

&gt; Russia buys very little from the EU, but EU buys a lot from Russia (gas, mainly). It would be shitty expensive to buy something else, sure it could try but that would depend on which countries sided with Russia. No gas wouldn't be a major problem for another 10 months or so, but oil would.

Yes, I already said so. Again, it's doable. In fact, in the near future it's necessary. If anything, Putin's recent move has shown that the EU should *not* allow itself to be dependent upon Russia for this type of thing.

What Italy needs is not so much less taxes, but taxes being collected more fairly in input: less taxes on work, less taxes on startups, less taxes on the lower classes, while rising taxes on who can and should pay them.

In Britain we never speak about ""celebrating"" the fallen. We always speak about ""commemorating"" them. 

Our attitude to WW1 is much more complex than our attitude to WW2, however, it is true that we are emotionally connected to it still. Almost every child in Britain still studies WW1 literature and poetry for example. 

This year it is getting much more prominence than usual because of the centenery and it might be the case that after the 100th anniversary of the ending of WW1 passes, it will start to fade from our collective consciousness.

One big difference between Britain and Germany is that in Britain we tend more to think of current Britain as being a direct continuum of the Britain that fought WW1.

You'd think so, but people today are still entirely ignorant of Nationalism and what it means to be Nationalist. 

There is nothing wrong with pride in one's country. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be better than other countries. There is nothing wrong with wanting to rule yourself for yourself.

Many Europeans are strongly Nationalist but never use that term because the layman doesn't understand the difference between Nationalism and Fascism. 

In Fascist(Chauvinistic Nationalism) ideology, other nations and people are inherently inferior and subservient to your needs and your nation's needs. You believe in things like a strong, singular leader, akin to a Monarchy. 

There is nothing inherently wrong with Nationalism until it goes to far into the spectrum of Fascism. Then you have a problem.

Poland has 2600 soldiers in Afghanistan, Russia significantly more in Crimea. Also I'm unaware of when Poland had to supply a large force on foreign soil most recently, they have the planes to be able to do it if nobody stops them. 

&gt;So, their recent peacekeeping missions were a fluke? As I said, Germany hasn't been allowed to put their army to the test outside of their own country because of (very understandable) repercussions following World War 2. In fact, their first peacekeeping mission (in Afghanistan I believe) was big news in The Netherlands.

No international body did ever stop Germany from having a peace keeping role in the international community, but they haven't had one. Now I'm not saying that's unreasonable - I'm saying now is an unlikely time to step forward.

&gt;So, when it comes to military intervention, Germany will definitely be there in my opinion. The gas can be bought elsewhere (like in my country, Norway, the UK etc.), and every country has a strategic supply of oil.

Norway's production would in that case pretty much all go to Germany. With an infrastructure that doesn't exist yet.

&gt;Yes, I already said so. Again, it's doable. In fact, in the near future it's necessary. If anything, Putin's recent move has shown that the EU should not allow itself to be dependent upon Russia for this type of thing.

Well that's your opinion but it would seem the leaders of Germany and several other EU states doesn't agree with you.

&gt;Diplomacy. Also, Russia is a big potential market for European companies. That's considered to be more important than the small crimes of Putin (because he hadn't invaded Ukraine yet, the second he did, Sochi was cancelled).

The only oblast in Ukraine with a Russian ethnic majority is Crimea.

This is why you have diplomatic channels.

Putin on the other hand, clearly does not believe in diplomacy. I do not need to be brainwashed to believe that, his actions speak for themselves. He unlawfully deployed a military force to Ukraine under a false pretext. That constitutes as an invasion.

Whether you like it or not, Crimea is sovreign territory of Ukraine.

Yep. One of the great paradoxes about Maidan movement and the new Ukrainian government. They are not elected as we all know. In a way it is not even legal. 

The living standards and income is higher in Russia than Ukraine. But sure Crimean people would like to be part of any bigger economy that can increase their economy. Why not Turkey? 

Russia has already its Black Sea Fleet and other military things in Crimea because they have leased them from Ukraine. Actually the Black Sea Fleet has been there since WW1 or something and the first Crimean War was Russia against British and others in 1853:

&gt;The Crimean War (pronounced /kraɪˈmiːən/ or /krɨˈmiːən/) (October 1853 – February 1856)[7][8]:7 was a conflict in which Russia lost to an alliance of France, Britain, the Ottoman Empire, and Sardinia. While neutral, Austria played a role in stopping the Russians.

There wasn't even Ukraine then. 

But does Poland seek here something like this?:

The Russian soldiers in Crimea... I think any other nation would have done the same. If somewhere is over 1.2 million USA citizens in a same kinda danger as they are in east-Ukraine and Crimea, USA would have started a full blown bombing operation against Ukraine weeks ago and would be assaulting Kiev with tank divisions and marines and stealth planes etc.

This whole shit started from Maidan. Russia was just waiting, it had plans if Yanukovitch would loose but Maidan people didn't have any plans to avoid the break of their country. Nor to answer Russia's move in the situation. 

This is not a bad vs. good thing, this is a very gray shit on the fan.

&gt;Secondly, e.g. Finland gets 100% of its gas from Russia.

[They apparently have better negotiators](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/13/finland-gas-idUSL5N0IY2SW20131113). Or maybe Russia just didn't want to offend Finland too much so they wouldn't block the Nord Stream pipeline they wanted to build...

&gt;Third, even if what you say were true, it'd still be strange. Why should buying in bulk and with a shorter transport distance make it more expensive?

Because the demand won't go away if they just refused to buy from Russia at these prices?

If Poland had overthrown them in 1970 then you might have an argument. 2 years before the economic, and therefore political collapse of the Soviet Union? It was a given it was going to happen. A foregone conclusion. 

That's like running into the boxing ring at the end of the fight and kicking the KO'd guy in the face and claiming the belt is yours. 

Anyway, back to the original point. The USA fucked us on Poland as much as you. Churchill wanted the Allies to continue east and push back the Soviets but unfortunately the Americans had no will to do that and completely fell for the 'Uncle Joe' image of Stalin. Then Churchill got voted out and that pretty much put and end to the small will there was to help Poland after 6 years of intense war and the complete ruin (financial and physical) of Europe as a whole.

Poland has a lot more than 2600 soldiers in Poland ;) They also have more advanced main battle tanks, helicopters and aircraft than the Russians have (note: based on wikipedia numbers). 

&gt; No international body did ever stop Germany from having a peace keeping role in the international community, but they haven't had one. Now I'm not saying that's unreasonable - I'm saying now is an unlikely time to step forward.

While it is possible that Dutch media fucked up royally, I tend to believe them here. Currently the Germans have a role (it's not specified what kind of role) in 8 peacekeeping missions. That started from 1994 onwards, before that, Germany was not allowed to move troops outside of it's borders. 

Also take into account that Germany has a leading role in the European Union. If they are to retain this role, they are going to have to get involved *if* this escalates. I don't see them retaining a leading role in the EU if they just sit idly by. 

&gt; Norway's production would in that case pretty much all go to Germany. With an infrastructure that doesn't exist yet.

Again, I never said it was easy. I've always mentioned that it'd be very costly. 
&gt; Well that's your opinion but it would seem the leaders of Germany and several other EU states doesn't agree with you.

Yes, that's why Germany is one of the leading countries in the world when it comes to renewable energy sources. So much so, that it actually exports this energy because it generates too much of it. 

&gt; I seem to remember Georgia 2008 and Syria 2011. Talk is cheap, withdrawing from planning a G8 summit isn't exactly taking a stance.

Neither were close enough to the EU to matter. Also take note of the EU's official stance regarding Georgia and what happened there. That's a complete opposite of the current situation and how the EU has apprised it. 

Diplomatically speaking it's unheard of. G8 summits generally don't get cancelled. Withdrawing from the planning of it serves a clear purpose: To isolate Russia and diminish Russia's influence on the economical-political stage. As you can tell by the reaction in the various markets (the rouble, bonds, stocks and stock markets are devaluating like crazy) it's quite effective.

Also, even if the region is actually absorbed by Poland, I doubt its NATO status would immediately change. There's no precedence for a NATO country expanding its borders, thus having expanded NATO's borders as well. Negotiations would have to be conducted which tend to last at least a year or two, somehow just long enough for the problem to be sorted out on its own first. 

If NATO would be brought into this question from the beginning, NATO would probably be the first one to tell Poland to forget the idea; it would put the whole organization in an uncomfortable position, since Poland didn't comprise that region when entering the Organization - basically, it wasn't ""what they signed up for"".

Genauso ist es, denn schlieszlich interessiert es mich nicht. Ich bin da konsequent. Und was folgt daraus, auszer dass ich in deinen Augen mit meinem Desinteresse Behinderte und Frauen diskriminiere. Warum ist das eigentlich so. Die Erklaerung bist du mir schuldig geblieben. Kann es sein, dass du heftig projizierst und dir einbildest, ich wuerde die Leistungen der Sportler abwerten, indem ich sie nicht bewusst zur Kenntnis nehme oder aehnlich abwegiges. Wie gesagt, dann muessten sich auch alle Curlingspieler dieser Welt als diskriminiert betrachten. Oder alle Eishockey-Fans. Oder alle Dackelzuechter. Interessiert mich alles nicht sonderlich. Aber gut, rational begruendbar ist deine Ansicht sowieso nicht, also lassen wir das.

&gt; Kannst du den überhaupt begründen warum für dich Behindertensport langweiliger ist?

Ja, kann ich. Wobei du vielleicht der Ehrlichkeit halber haettest vorausschicken sollen, dass wir in unserem Gespraech zwischen Behindertensport im Allgemeinen und den Paralympics trennen. Denn wenn zwei koerperlich Behinderte miteinander Schach spielen ist das genauso interessant fuer mich, wie wenn es Gesunde spielen - entsprechendes Niveau vorausgesetzt. Denn dort macht es schlieszlich keinen Unterschied, ob jemand behindert ist oder nicht. In anderen Sportarten fuer mich schon.

Was also meine unfundierten Vorlieben fuer und Meinungen ueber bestimmte klassische Bewegungs- und Spielablauefe bzw. Zuege angeht: es wundert mich etwas, dass es noetig ist diese zu erklaeren, denn wenn ich beispielsweise Basketball, was ich mir ab und an gerne ansehe, mit Rollstuhlbasketball vergleiche, dann ist meiner Meinung nach offensichtlich was interessanter ist und warum. Bei Rollstuhlfechten oder oder Rollstuhlrugby ist es uebrigens genauso, aber auch da ist meine Meinung natuerlich nicht gut fundiert, weil politisch anscheinend nicht korrekt oder so. 

Aehnlich ist es uebrigens bei den Winterspielen, aber da du bereits eingangs festgestellt hast, dass es diskriminierend ist, wenn ich es mir anmasze eine Vorliebe fuer beispielsweise normales Basketball gegenueber paralympischen Basketball zu haben, brauchen wir das nicht zu vertiefen, denke ich.

Und was die mangelnde Qualitaet aufgrund meines und des Desinteresses anderer Leute angeht: Frauen haben nunmal x % weniger Muskelmasse als Maenner.

Only if you redefine 'words' as 'action'. Poland is all words, it has no power projection capabilities to turn them into actions. That's why Poland is so loud now, because they don't have to back up their rhetoric with actions. They're trying to shame and goad the rest of the EU into action.

UK, France and Germany -- the actual EU powers with the ability to project their power -- they're all sitting quiet for now, deliberating on the best course of strategy. They're not stupid and they know that if they talk the talk they have to walk the walk or else they will look absurd waving their fists and yet doing nothing. You can always wave your fists without using them, but there is a limit to the degree to which you can do that. 

In short, Poland doesn't have shit, it's just a dog yapping. There is nothing to be proud of there, they aren't doing anything. When EU or NATO finally get off their arse and do something, *that's* that time to be proud as a Pan-European. Alas, I doubt they will do anything. Not that I care much anymore. I'm Pan-European, but Europe has no balls or any semblance of political unity. Might as well stay loyal to my country if the European community refuses to flex its muscles as the *Economist* has been crying for in the past ten years.

Es wird wohl eher so gewesen sein, daß es zu umständlich war immer beide Geschlechter getrennt anzusprechen, weswegen es eine gemeinsame Form brauchte, bei der jeder weiß, was gemeint ist, und nur noch wenn ein Geschlecht herausgehoben werden musste, dann spezielle Formen verwendet worden.

Eben, und das ist historisch die maskuline Form,  Ich denke die Gesellschaft hat sich weiter entwickelt und sollte Männer und Frauen wertschätzen indem - wenn es keine geschlechtsneutrale Form gibt - beide Formen generalisiert Verwendung finden.

Wie sich die grammatikalischen Geschlechter entwickelt haben kann ich auch nicht belegen, nur vermuten. Lerne aber gene dazu: Sprachforscher irgendjemand hier? :)

&gt; „Wir haben jetzt hier weibliche und männliche Form aber aus Schlechtigkeit benutzen wir jetzt nur noch die männliche, harrharr“

Sagt ja niemand, zumindest ich nicht. Es geht nicht um Schlechtigkeit, sondern um Bequemlichkeit, mangelnde Empathie, festgefahrene Rollenbilder und Hierarchien und das Desinteresse an gegenseitiger Wertschätzung.

Natürlich darf jede/r so reden wie es beliebt. Und ich möchte auch keine Genderpolizei, die für jedes mal vergessenes gendern einen auf die Mütze gibt. Aber für mich zeigt ein generelles Desinteresse an geschlechtsgerechter Sprache oder gar eine aggressive Reaktion darauf eine Unsicherheit oder Überhöhung des eigenen Rollenselbstverständnisses, und das die so beteuerte Gleichbehandlung sich noch nicht im Kopf und damit in der eigenen Sprache niedergeschlagen hat. Das kann ich doof finden, das hat nichts mit Fundamentalismus zu tun.

In this specific case, very little because the aggressor has a vast stock of nuclear missiles, and the treaty doesn't define how the parties must act in order to guarantee the Ukraine, how quickly they must act.

NATO is a military Alliance, they're not the same thing. But it's worth as much whatever comes of it when Article 5 is invoked after a real military strike. Given the levels of integration within NATO and the infrastructure around running the Alliance there's enough desire from all parties to keep it going and stay committed to it.

They're not the same situation at all.

Thanks for the credit, but I'm just an amateur in this field. For a professional answer I really suggest asking the fine folks from /r/linguistics. They are actual linguists, with actual degrees (other than Wikipedia Uni, like myself) :)

Now, speculating a bit, I think they are listed as ""separate letters"" because they show separate [phonemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemes).

Also looking at the wikiarticle for [digraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_\(orthography\))

&gt;A digraph or digram is a pair of characters used to write one phoneme (distinct sound) or a sequence of phonemes that does not correspond to the normal values of the two characters combined. The sound is often, but not necessarily, one which cannot be expressed using a single character in the orthography used by the language.

&gt;In my opinion the Germans were spread too thin

Because of the constant fear of a western front. If Britain had surrendered then there'd be less fear of a western front and Hitler could have concentrated his forces better in regards to Russia. 

That combined with the purges which basically got rid of everyone in the military that was even half competent and it would have been a recipe for disaster.

&gt;You ask a very very hard question, to which I must give my utmost attention in order to answer properly.

&gt;You see...

&gt;On one hand, Slavic women are very very beautiful.

&gt;On the other hand, Russia gave China communism, resulting in the ""Cultural Revolution"" The great persecution of intellectuals, scientists, wealthy landowners, and the wholesale destruction of a two thousand year old culture.

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution

&gt;Do I think western capitalism and democracy would have been better? No.

&gt;They seek to undermine China by pushing for a system of governance that it is not ready for. Look at India, a country which used to be ahead of China in every department, is now laden with an ineffectual democratically elected leadership. If democracy is so great, then why doesn't India have the second highest GDP in the world?

&gt;When westerners talk about democracy and capitalism, Chinese people think Luis Vuitton and Porsche. Do you see the problem? Chinese people don't even understand what democracy and capitalism are. They just think money money money because after the communist approach that's all they're capable of thinking.

&gt;When Americans talk about freedom for Tibetans, how can I take them seriously when their entire country is founded on the genocide of its native inhabitants? They can't even point to where Tibet is on the map. What a joke.

&gt;So as far as I can tell, China has no allies, no friends, nobody to really rely on. When the Soviet Union gave aid to Mao, did they think, oh hey this guy knows what he's doing, he is great for China. Or did they think, ok this guy will buy weapons from us and provide a buffer between us and American allies. Korean War? No problem, just ask Mao Zedong to send in one million Chinamen to soak up damage.

&gt;You know what's strange? Chinese people used to love Russians, in fact some of the old people still do, what with the whole ""comrade"" thing and all, but now most hate them. For some reason, northern China is the most racist area of the entire country. When they meet a white person, the first thing they ask is, ""Are you a Ruski?"" If the person says yes, they grimace, but if he's not they become happy and want to have a drink with that person. It's like the Opium Wars never happened or something. Ah such short memory.

&gt;All in all, I am invariably a pro-China Chinese person, not because I don't respect or admire other countries, but because in the game of nations, there are no friends. Only temporary allies with similar interests.

&gt;Ukraine has an unenviable and tenuous geographical position between the EU and Russia.

&gt;I cannot tell you what is right because I am not Ukrainian.

&gt;However I know one thing to be true.

&gt;In every situation where a country invades or takes another under its ""protection"", there is always a hierarchy, wherein the more powerful one tries to erode and destroy the identity of the weaker until they are essentially wiped out or become practically identical to their ""big brother.""

Also the idea of a ""Stealth"" tank is kind of ridiculous. 

I've seen  dozens, if not at least a hundred ""tank-kill"" videos from Syria, using ATGM(Anti-Tank Guided Missile)

The biggest threat a Tank has is not being spotted by a plane but by the single trained guy with an ATGM missile that can fire a pin-point shot onto the Tank and killing everyone inside. 

The moment that Tank fires a single shot, the stealth is gone and its as open to an ATGM as any other Tank. 

ATGM's are Wire guided, meaning that Stealth won't affect its usefulness at all.

Say the stock dropped to $20 US a share, the Market Capitalization of Microsoft would drop to 166 billion, and Bill Gates' estimated net worth would be somewhere around 42 billion.  But, Gates would still have all the cash he previously had, both in the bank and in his wallet.  He wouldn't lose any money, he'd just lose the potential to convert his stock into 78 billion worth of money.

If this turned out to be nothing more than a rumour, the stock would probably rebound to roughly the same level, and potentially he would once again be in a position where if he sold his stock he could get 78 billion for it.

In reality though, because there has to be a buyer for every share he sells, if he actually wanted to sell every share, he'd get a lot less than 78 billion for it unless he sold it very slowly, over decades.  That's because for each block of shares he sells, he'd have to look harder for the next buyer, and would have to lower the price he's offering as a result.  So, this net worth of his is only theoretical.

The market capitalization of a company is also not representative of much other than the current value you could get for buying/selling a single share of that company's stock times the number of outstanding shares.  When the price per share drops, the market capitalization of the company drops, but other than a theoretical value changing, it doesn't mean all that much.

When you compare the market capitalization of a company, or the net worth of someone in shares to something with a ""hard value"" (say someone owns a lot of steel) it's more volatile because shares tend to be valued based on future earnings of a company, often with the assumption that the company will grow.  The ""hard value"" of a company is nothing more than the market value of its assets, from things like patents to computers, buildings, etc. that it owns.  That's normally a tiny fraction of the value of a company (but obviously is much higher for a company that has real assets like say a shipping company that owns ships, vs a tech company that simply owns code).

Implying that European countries, or any other nation for that matter, doesn't do the exact same thing.

&gt;I don't think the US should impose on Europe just because they're having a harder time dominating the world these days.

The US isn't forcing Europe to do anything. What I'm trying to say is the United States hasn't reaped any tangible benefits from its alliances and heightened defense spending, so it is a good thing that we are continuing to cut defense expenditures, continuing to withdraw our forces from other countries, shutting down our bases, and cutting support for other nations' militaries and defense programs, particularly in Europe, while winding down our diplomatic burdens across the planet. So, it is up to Europe to decide how to fill the void left by the United States, especially in its own neighborhood, if at all, or not at all.

&gt;The lack of a European response isn't ""an internal problem"" as you put it - it's the natural state, since the EU doesn't have a foreign policy because we're not a country and we aren't united except in our desire to live peacefully with each other.

And you can certainly choose to continue operating that way. The choice is not whether to live peacefully with each other, but how to respond to common and external threats. A common foreign and defense policy may or may not be a more effective approach. But the United States won't (and shouldn't) continue to take responsibility for Europe's security.

true,cheio,ANAR,Zensiert,"&gt;Eben, und das ist historisch die maskuline Form

Ja, das ist eben die Frage. Ich bin immernoch der Meinung, daß das nicht als maskuline Form entstanden ist, sondern als Utrum. Es könnte z.B. sein, daß erst die Römer mit lateinischen Texten, die übersetzt werden mußten, eine spezielle weibliche Form nötig gemacht haben, weil da eben dann segregiert wurde. Es wurde dann weiterhin die Utrum-Form verwendet, mit der beide angesprochen wurden, und wenn ausschließlich Frauen gemeint waren, wurde die weibliche Form hergenommen. Alles nur Vermutung, wie gesagt. Wenn es so war, dann gäbe es für mich keinen Grund, das generische Maskulinum überhaupt Maskulinum zu nennen, aber es wurde so genannt, obwohl eben nicht nur Männer gemeint waren, weswegen man es „generisches Maskulinum“ nennen mußte, obwohl es eigentlich geschlechtsneutral ist. Das generische Maskulinum kann ja auch für reine Frauengruppen verwendet werden. Deswegen fände ich ein generisches Maskulinum auch nicht ungerecht, sondern einfach nur den Namen falsch. Ich interessiere mich für Sprachen, und naja, es gibt außer dem Schwedischen noch X sprachen ohne Femininum, z.B. Englisch, da gibt es nur manchmal eine aus dem Französischen entlehnte weibliche Form.

Ich glaub leider nicht, daß sich ein Sprachforscher bis hier hin durchklickt :-/. Ich wurde glaub ich auch ganz am Anfang mal weggevotet, mich würde wundern, wenn hier überhaupt noch jemand außer uns rumgeistert.

&gt; Desinteresse an geschlechtsgerechter Sprache oder gar eine aggressive Reaktion

Also vielleicht kann ich darauf noch kurz Bezug nehmen: Die meisten ablehnenden Reaktionen kommen, soweit ich das persönlich beobachte, nicht auf die bloße Benutzung von gegenderter Sprache; also niemand stört sich daran, wenn Frau Merkel sagt „Liebe Wählerinnen und Wähler“. Sondern die Probleme entstehen in Fällen, wo z.B. die gegenderte Sprache selektiv eingesetzt wird. z.B. spricht Frau vdL gerne von Vergewaltigern, Tätern und Schlägern ohne gegenderte Sprache, auch wenn die angesprochenen Gruppen sehr heterogen sind, aber achtet peinlichst genau auf „Soldatinnen und Soldaten“, obwohl es fast keine Soldatinnen gibt. Kürzlich hörte ich im WDR5 „Die Gärtnerinnen — es sind ja hauptsächlich Frauen — ...“ und im Folgenden nur noch das Femininum. Also es wird nicht gegendert, wenn Frauen davon einen Nachteil haben können. Dann gibt es lächerliche Diskussionen darüber, wie gegendert werden soll. Binnenmajuskeln, oder Schrägstriche, Gender-Stern, Gender-Gap, etc. Dann noch das Gleichsetzen von gegenderter Sprache mit geschlechtergerechter Sprache mit der Implikation, daß nicht gegenderte Sprache automatisch ungerecht wäre. Dann kommt es — auch wenn du nicht so bist — recht häufig vor, daß das generische Maskulinum von einer Art selbsternannter Genderpolizei gerügt wird, und dann durch Doppelformen oder sogar, wie an der Uni Leipzig komplett durch das generische Femininum ersetzt werden soll, obwohl sich außer ein paar Gutmenschen niemand daran gestört hat. Wenn man auf Stellenausschreibungen das generische Maskulinum benutzt und vergißt, ein „(m/w)“ hinzuzufügen, kann man sich schnell mal ne Arbeitsrechtsklage einhandeln, aber wenn darunter steht „Bewerbungen von Frauen werden bevorzugt berücksichtigt“ oder sowas ist kein Problem. Das sind so die Dinger, die negativen Reaktionen hervorzubringen geeignet sind, was auch sicher verständlich ist, denn das sind im Gegensatz zu „jede/r darf so reden, wie es beliebt“ teilweise sehr bevormundende Maßnahmen. Das erzeugt eben Trotz.

Sorry, ich wollte gar nicht so viel schreiben. Eigentilich wollte ich nur darlegen, daß generische Formen, egal welche, nicht unbedingt ungerecht sein oder was mit Rollenverständnis und Empathielosigkeit zu tun haben müssen. Aber die dummen Hände haben einfach nicht aufgehört. Nächstes Mal fasse ich mich kürzer. :3",0,1393870917,null,0,false,0,cftd9f4,t3_1z9dys,t1_cftd9f4,t1_cftanl9,null,1432640336,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

Especially because of the UK and France defence alliance, they have committed themselves to developing the UCAV drones together, the newest summit emphasised this and gave a [two year feasibility study](http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/dassault-and-bae-systems-welcome-anglo-french-ucav-pact-395445/) before it begins (although after what happened with Telemos, it may not reach the production stage...).

Not at all. You explicitly rejected it as being of 0 information value and that you were assuming this and therefore dismissed it entirely from your world. And yes, I find that disgusting.

&gt; Fine you poor shithead of crap.

How quickly we stop pretending to be civil.

&gt; There is only TRUE and NOT TRUE in this world. An information can't be a bit true. When somebody is lying, than their ""information"" is simply NOT TRUE and therefore it's not an information it's a story.

The cold hard truth is that Crimea isn't worth anything like this to the West. It's also not worth anything like this to Russia, but Putin still is willing to pay much higher cost than anyone in the West.

As for economic sanctions, if the whole West introduces them simultaneously, then Russia will feel it, but it's not clear that Russian decision-makers would. Meanwhile, look at [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_in_the_European_energy_sector). If Russia responds with cutting off NG supply, the effect will ripple through the whole Europe.

&gt;Not at all. You explicitly rejected it as being of 0 information value and that you were assuming this and therefore dismissed it entirely from your world.
That wasn't my intension to say. I was talking about a ""single piece of infomation"" like when somebody says ""The street is wet"" it's wheater true or not, maybe a part of the street ist wet, but that's not the point (I could say ""the entire street is wet"" or ""a part of the street is wet""). Then I said: 
&gt; In fact propaganda or fake-news are not infomation, it's the opposite, it's anti-information. It's simply lying and lying has no value of information, it's only an instument to convince people to believe in a ""non-reality.""
This is just a general statement and has nothing to do with RT at all. I wanted to say ""fake-news"" = no value. Because they are not true. And then if RT is all propaganda it would have no value. Like the ""information"" in 1939 that polish soldier attacked germany. It wasn't an information/fact, it was lying and had no real information content. So in a historic view we can see that the german gov. lied and thats good so we can see that they used propaganda and the people believed them. 
And **IF** RT is lying (for propaganda) than they have no information content, then they only want to manipulate and give the imagination of information.

I hope you understand what I mean/ that I expressed myself right.

**Alles ist erlaubt, so lange es keinem anderen schadet.**  
Und was wem schadet, ist relativ… also Geschmackssache (Siehe: S/M). Kann also nicht global entschieden werden. (Die Frage wäre so absurd wie „An welchem Ort steht *der Mensch*?“.) 

* *Schaden Sarrazin’s Aussagen anderen Menschen?*  
  * Nun, direkten körperlichen Schaden verursachen sie natürlich nicht.  
  * Aber natürlich können sie, wenn sie durch die Sinne in Hirne gelangen, deren Neuronen diese Informationsmuster mit dem Schmerzzentrum o.ä. verbinden, zu Schmerz und Leid führen. Ob das dann Schaden ist, ist wie gesagt relativ. Sarrazin kann ja nix für die Assoziationen die Menschen haben. Aber er weiss sehr wohl dass es welche gibt die die haben, und wenn er’s dann mit Absicht macht, ist das rational betrachtet *wohl* Körperverletzung.  
  * Und natürlich können die Veränderung die die Erfahrung dieser Informationsmuster im Hirn auslösen ach zu Verhaltensänderungen führen. (Z.B. jemand der sich in rassistischen Gedanken bestätigt sieh.) Und damit z.B. auch zu Gewalt. Aaber *das* jetzt auf Sarrazin zu schieben… Ein Mensch muss ja schon ’ne Menge Vorbedingungen erfüllen, um überhaupt in der diesen Schluss bedingenden Mentalität zu sein. So einfach *isses* einfach nicht.
* *Schadet die Zensur der Debatte anderen Menschen?*  
  * Nun, sie wird sehr wahrscheinlich schonmal Sarrazin schaden. Das ist zwar für uns wie oben erwähnt wahrscheinlich nicht von Nachteil… doch wenn wir uns als was besseres erheben und sehen wollen, als die die wir so verabscheuen… dann können wir nicht hingehen und das *selbe* Verhalten der Intoleranz und des Hasses an der Tag legen. … Wie unterscheiden wir uns sonst von der Sarrazin-Geistenhaltung? (Garnicht.)  
  * Dann ist ja wahrscheinlich allen klar, dass wir uns in eine Abwärtsspirale des Totaritarismus begeben, wenn wir plötzlich für unsere Grundrechte Ausnahmen definieren. Dann sind es ja keine Grundrechte mehr! **Der ganze Sinn** von Grundrechten ist doch, dass sie *immer* und für *jeden* gelten. Auch für massenmordvergewaltigende Terrornazis oder was auch immer! Auch für Adolf Yong Stalin-Mobutu persönlich! … Machen wir Ausnahmen wie es uns grad passt, sind es keine Grundrechte mehr, und wir sind moralisch auf der Stufe unserer Gegner.

**Mein Fazit:** Warum sind wir eigentlich so unsichere Heulsusen? Ein Durchgeknallter … von dem alle wissen dass er durchgeknallt ist … macht durchgeknallte Aussagen… Nein! Doch! Oooh! … Das einzige in dem sich Sarrazin von einem gewöhnlicher verrückten Penner an der Straßenkreuzung unterscheidet ist doch **dass wir ihn ernst nehmen**!!  
→ *Lasst das!*… Seid nicht solche unsicheren Pfeifen! … Die korrekte Reaktion lautet: „Haha! Was für ein Idiot!“. Umso mehr er sagt, umso mehr lachen wir. **Dann fühlen sich die verkappten Nazis die ihm hörig sind nämlich garnicht erst selbstsicher und bestätigt, und wir haben das Problem garnicht erst!**

Je ne vois pas le problème. Pourquoi le droit de voter devrait-il être ""acheté"" en publiant des articles ? On devrait avoir le droit de ne participer qu'aux discussions sans contribuer au contenu. Et ""downvoter juste pour le fun"", c'est toi qui le dis, peut-être que les gens qui downvotent le font en toute bonne foi.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"Hard economic sanctions on Russia until Putin relents and withdraws all troops from the Ukraine and sets stable long term gas prices for the EU and Ukraine on a collective basis (to prevent punitive measures afterwards). It is absolutely unacceptable to have an occupied (and possibly annexed) country right on the EU's borders with no repercussions, that would tell the world that the EU is a joke and would signal to others that the West's dominance is at a clear end. 

I posted this elsewhere, but economic sanctions would be effective because

&gt;Putin's regime is kept afloat through a careful balancing act of keeping the oligarchs happy, and by promising a modicum of economic stability to the country to the regular people. An overwhelming majority of the voters recall the economic chaos in the years following 'shock therapy' in Russia following the collapse of the Soviet Union, where the economy just... didn't function, whilst the oligarchs want to be able to have easy travel and access to the West, whilst also keeping their enterprises in Russia in good shape. Economic sanctions threaten both those groups, as Russian foreign exchange reserves are abyssmal and the terms of trade could quickly turn very bad for Russia. The change in the Ruble alone, since the crisis began, has made imports a lot more expensive. Putin wants to keep his regime together, and he can't do that under sustained economic sanctions.

Especially if Europe targets Russian energy exports, then Putin's regime is fucked. Gazprom currently accounts for about 20% of the Russian government's income. As imports become more expensive and the state is able to fund fewer services, social unrest will build to a critical point until Putin will have no choice except to either escalate or withdraw.

Now, this plan is not without risks. It kind of puts Putin's back up against the wall.

Im [Vorwort zu Animal Farm](http://home.iprimus.com.au/korob/Orwell.html) beschreibt Orwell, dass ihm ähnliches wiederfahren ist: Niemand wollte zum damaligen Zeitpunkt ein Buch drucken, das Russland so scharf kritisiert.
(""At any given moment there is an orthodoxy, a body of ideas which it is assumed that all right-thinking people will accept without question. It is not exactly forbidden to say this, that or the other, but it is 'not done' to say it [...] At this moment what is demanded by the prevailing orthodoxy is an uncritical admiration of Soviet Russia."")

Vielleicht meinst du, dass man Sarrazin nicht mit Orwell vergleichen kann, dass er Intoleranz und Lügen verbreitet etc., und dass deshalb zivilgesellschaftliche Zensur gerechtfertigt ist.
Aber das läuft darauf hinaus, Zensur nur dann zu verurteilen, wenn man mit der zensierten Meinung übereinstimmt.
Es sind aber gerade die Meinungen, die unbeliebt, ja verhasst sind (im Falle der zivilgesellschaftlichen Zensur vor allem von denen, die etwas mit Verlagswesen oder Journalismus zu tun haben, also vorwiegend in links-intellektuellen Kreisen) die Schutz vor Zensur am meisten brauchen.
Und das auch wenn die Meinungen totaler Blödsinn sind, denn wenn sie ans Licht kommen, kann man sie widerlegen.

Despite people saying these are ""recommendations"" they have caused the US to threaten to withdraw from NATO. European defense ministers were aghast the US Secretary of Defense would be so blunt and have such little regard for their feelings when he made a scathing speech in Brussels.

Despite popular belief, the US wants a strong EU centralized force. In the same speech the US defense minister said he understands its financially and politically impossible for European members to meet the minimum anytime soon, but encouraged them to ""do more with less"" by consolidating resources. This has mostly fallen on deaf ears. 

What people that keep bringing up the UK's and France's militaries (or the US via NATO agreements) fail to realize is NATO was supposed to be a collaborative effort with all members contributing. France, the UK, and US might not want to be dragged into a conflict where they're required to do 95% of the work due to a complete disregard for a member's own defense. 

Personally I believe the US has every right to leave NATO. Considering European members show such little commitment to the agreement and their own defense, I fail to see why the US should.

The ""hard value"" of a company is nothing more than the market value of its assets, from things like patents to computers, buildings, etc. that it owns. That's normally a tiny fraction of the value of a company (but obviously is much higher for a company that has real assets like say a shipping company that owns ships, vs a tech company that simply owns code).

**Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Qin Gang's Remarks on the Current Situation in Ukraine**

*2014/03/02*

Q: On March 1, the Russian Federation Council authorized Russian President Vladimir Putin to use armed forces in order to protect Russians and Russian military officers and soldiers in Ukraine. What is China's comment on the current situation in Ukraine?

A: China is deeply concerned about the current situation in Ukraine. We condemn the recent extreme and violent acts there and have been urging the relevant parties in Ukraine to resolve their internal disputes peacefully within the legal framework so as to safeguard the lawful rights and interests of all ethnic communities in Ukraine and restore normal social order at an early date.

It is China's long-standing position not to interfere in others' internal affairs. We respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. There are reasons for why the situation in Ukraine is what it is today. China will follow the development of the situation closely and call on relevant parties to seek a political resolution of their differences through dialogue and negotiation based on respect for international law and norms governing international relations in order to uphold regional peace and stability.",0,1393874551,null,0,false,0,cftf0s6,t3_1zfyri,t1_cftf0s6,t3_1zfyri,null,1432641167,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

I personally prefer bigger national banks like Deutsche Bank, Targo, Postbank or Commerzbank. The big downside to Sparkasse/Volksbank is that these are unions of small local banks. They look big, but are actually small.  

If you have an account with Kreissparkasse Tuebingen, you can withdraw money from other Sparkasse banking ATMs all over Germany. But since these other Sparkassen are practically different banks, they do not have access to your account. 

For example I once lost my wallet with my EC debit card, all my money, my ID card and my train tickets in Leipzig. Luckily I still had my passport, so I went to my bank (Targo) and used my passport to identify myself. The clerk locked my EC debit card, then looked up the balance in my checking account and paid me money out of it. This money allowed me to pay for the hotel that night and buy a new train tickets to get home the next day. 

If I had been a customer of a Sparkasse, I would have been screwed. Since they are seperate banks, there would have been no way for the clerk at Sparkasse Leipzig to look up the checking account at the Sparkasse in my home town. I would have needed to spent the night at the Bahnhofsmission and hitchhike back home. 

This is also interesting in regards to Sparkassen:

BHL explique le lien entre sa judéité et son engagement international. Il n'y a qu'à citer ce qu'il dit. C'est lui même qui l'explique. Je n’interprète rien du tout, je ne déforme rien, c'est lui qui le dit lui-même.

Gesellschaftspolitische Themen wurden im konservativen Spektrum gemäß dem Thatcherschen Spruch ""There is no such thing as a society"" durch einen Marktradikalismus ersetzt, der bei einem Teil der Journalisten nicht so schlecht anzukommen scheint. Das Resultat davon ist z.b. dass sogar im eher linken Standard Kampagnen gegen den öffentlichen Verkehr bzw. die entsprechenden Betreiber im öffentlichen Eigentum geführt werden. Eine ""Linken Mainstream"" in den Medien gibt es eher nicht - dies korreliert mit der Tendenz linker Parteien wie z.B. der Sozialdemokraten, Positionen ""der Mitte"" einzunehmen, die von den nach rechts rückenden Konservativen aufgegeben wurden.

Let us consider the shift in the map here and the historical context.


Part of the Communist Bloc's (dominated by Russia) main goal was to provide Russia with a buffer zone of states under its control to the West, in response to the two world wars where it was attacked from the West. The bloc collapses, and what happens? Russia is losing ground in its geopolitical sphere. [Check out this map of NATO expansion](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/History_of_NATO_enlargement.svg/733px-History_of_NATO_enlargement.svg.png) , notice how it has been spreading pretty consistently since the fall of the USSR; what do you think that looks like from Russia's point of view?


Considering their historical context, how do you think they feel about Western expansion into territory that used to be, basically, Moscow's? Ukraine is next, we've been courting them to join the EU (and probably eventually NATO), and they're right there on the Russian border, right up in Moscow's grill, and have been a prized possession of Russia for some time. After they fall, what next?


They probably feel pretty fucking alarmed, their foreign policy of the past century is falling, and fast. That's what this is about. And you can say ""oh they have nothing to fear, no worries."" Promises mean nothing in international relations, they don't care if the West ""means them no harm,"" because you never know, and now we have our military alliance right there on their doorstep. And they need those Crimean bases, which they'll lose if Ukraine joins the West, and they want that puppet state to stay with them, to block further Western expansion.

I am absolutely not defending them, their actions are unacceptable and they should behave more responsibly for sure. But I understand why Putin and Moscow would feel threatened.",0,1393876394,null,0,false,0,cftfxtv,t3_1zfdae,t1_cftfxtv,t3_1zfdae,null,1432641598,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

As a verbal shorthand, I understand. But taking this seriously and literally, I still disagree and claim there is real information there, but it's an admittedly nuanced and minor quibble, really.

&gt; On a personell level: I want to know whats going on on crimea and a lot of things what RT writes is just junk, so I am ignoring it's mostly. Like it's said in this thread the title (and so the cliffhanger) is completly misleading and just to upset people and to manipulate.

I agree *almost* entirely. But the thing is...it is still talking about something that I find very important. Because all of the ""truth only"" Western sources that you presumably (?) have no problem with, they don't discuss any of this. They won't acknowledge that there might be any reason why the people of Crimea might be dissatisfied with the current government in Kiev. And I think that's really important. And it's something that RT *is* trying to address.

This headline is bad. But the article itself helps to correct it. Would I like to have another piece that's an awesome blog going through and correcting this and other details and such? Sure! But the only way I can get that is if people agree first that it's worth reading and responding to RT rather than autodownvoting and banning and ignoring.

Like there was one I wanted to submit to /r/nottheonion: [Seriously, what?! Kerry tells Russia 'you don't invade a country on completely phony pretexts'](http://rt.com/news/kerry-russia-us-pretext-494/). But it was autobanned, because RT. And then when I sent it to the modmail just because I thought they might enjoy it for a laugh, I just got a short response that thought I could and should just find a non-RT version. ""We"" hate RT so much that we can't even laugh at it anymore. You know what this reminds me of? AJ post-9/11.

&gt; I've never mentioned bias.

No, of course not. That's my entire point. I'm trying to talk about bias; I'm interested in shades of grey and all you have is your:

propaganda = 100% false lies = autoignore

&gt; I've talked about propaganda (which is in fact lying or pervert the facts) and that lies are not true. 

Gee, thanks. I don't feel insulted at all by your constant patronization.

Io personalmente considererei questa una certezza più che altro. La loro policy della cancellazione dei messaggi fa abbastanza acqua di fronte alle rivelazioni giornalistiche degli ultimi tempi.

&gt; che ne sai che il governo russo non possa leggere i tuoi messaggi ?

Se è criptato end to end e il gestore non ha le chiavi di cifratura, tutto quello che possono intercettare è solo spazzatura. La verità è che potete usare anche Facebook per comunicare, se le comunicazioni sono criptate in modo che gli unici ad avere accesso ai dati sono mittente e destinatario, cambia ben poco.

&gt;  La cosa non insospettisce nessuno ?

Alt. Non ho detto che Telegram sia una soluzione, tutt'altro, sono ultracritico verso questa soluzione per quanto riguarda la comunicazione, ma algoritmi di cifratura forti fanno in modo che tu non debba preoccuparti del mezzo, vedi sopra perché. L'OTR per esempio lo puoi usare pure su Gchat ripeto, non cambia nulla. L'unica cosa che Google riesce ad intercettare sono i cosiddetti metadata.

&gt; penso che le probabilità che ciò accada davvero sono praticamente zero, visto che io non conto un cazzo.

Verissimo, ma non rende meno totalitario il fatto che tutte le tue comunicazioni siano catalogate e schedate come fossi un terrorista o un assassino, al di la di tutto. Esigere privacy dalle proprie comunicazioni non vuol dire obbligatoriamente voler progettare attentati o colpi di stato.

&gt; invece furti di password e di account succedono a milioni di persone tutti i giorni

Verissimo, ma quasi sempre è colpa dell'utente quando questo avviene. Mi dispiace dirlo ma è così.

Yes, but the problem is that it is in *no country's interest to do that*. It will be long-term suicide regardless.

Many possibilities here, among them sanctions harsh enough to sway public opinion against him (he clearly brought this on himself, and regular Russians have no interest in a war, especially not with the West).

If you are above a certain monthly income the monthly fee gets waived. The amount of monthly income required for a free account varies. Sometimes banks have promotional offers, making the required monthly income for a free account as low as 600 EUR (Targo and PSD a while back). Others require 1500, 1700 or 2300 EUR a month.

They charge a small fee for their service, but it is well worth the money. Sadly the next big center is in Stuttgart.

Russia actually owned the Crimea during the formation of the USSR. It was handed over to the Ukraine control during the 50s because the two regions blend into one another. That they lost the Crimea after the fall has been a sore point for Russian nationalist pride ever since.

The other issue is that the Crimea is a strategic asset because of portage. It is currently home of the Russian Black Sea fleet. This is critical for Russia because they have no natural warm-water ports that access the Mediteranian on their southern borders, so they've had to rely on foreign ports to host those fleets.

&gt; Economic sanctions (or other outside pressure) usually have the effect of the leaders becoming more popular rather than less.

Korruption ist auch bei uns ein weit stärkeres Thema als bei euch. Bei euch muss ein Präsident oder Minister bei Verdacht zurücktreten. Bei uns wird sowas ausgesessen und von den dummen Wählern auch noch gewählt. Mir schauderts dabei jedesmal, echt. Sicher, wir haben weniger Probleme als in Irak oder Afghanistan, aber das sollte wohl nicht der Maßstab sein?

Zu Griechenland: Das ganze Geld, was die EU runtergepumpt hat blieb nicht dort, sondern wurde dazu benutzt, die Schulden bei der deutschen Bank (und anderen Banken) zu bezahlen. Das Geld ging also (fast) alles wieder zurück. Ich meine, ist auch ok, weil wenn die Deutsche Bank umfällt, dann geht die EU drauf. Aber wirklich helfen tuts den Griechen nur minimal. Für wirkliche Investitionen, die alles bessern würden, ist kein Geld da. Das müssen sie dann schon alleine machen.

Das Problem mit diesen Ländern ist aber nicht die Regierung, sondern die Arbeitslosigkeit unter Jugendlichen. In Spanien immerhin 37% die keine Zukunft sehen. Das ist eine verlorene Generation, die da rangezüchtet wird, ohne Hoffnung. Was denkst du, was da passieren wird? Vielleicht nix. Vielleicht schon? Werden die auf den Resteuropäischen Arbeitsmarkt ziehen? Vermutlich. Was dann? Wird es dann zu Integrationsproblemen kommen?

Ich weiß nicht. Ich hoffe natürlich das Beste, aber Friede, Freude, Eierkuchen ist das alles nicht. Es gibt Baustellen. Und die müssen angegangen werden.

If you mean the UK, you're correct. But almost all NATO members haven't been meeting [the 2% target since the 90s](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zdy2t/in_light_of_what_is_happening_in_ukraine_what_is/cftevwm). They expect the US, UK and France will bail them out should anything happen. 

The US defense budget has been steadily decreasing over the past couple decades. It has been very blunt and clear it will not provide European defense forever, and advocated ""spending smarter"" by consolidating forces. So far no consolidation, except between its traditional allies the UK and France, and more cuts by everyone else.

The US has talked about withdrawing from NATO because of these abysmal spending figures of NATO members. I am not sure if further integration between the UK and France is signaling the same thing (although I doubt it). But it seems the UK and France could be much more agile without NATO, and have far fewer obligations to defend countries that put no little effort into their own defense.

&gt;film

Per andare al cinema più vicino dovrei farmi tre quarti d'ora di autostrada e pagare una cifra assurda perché è un multisala uberfighissimo col treddì e tutto quanto. Non mi va, soprattutto se poi al 90% sono merdate americane che guardi una volta e dimentichi; per tale ragione non solo ho smesso di andare al cinema, ma completamente di vedere film recenti quasi. Finché avevo il cinema vicino ci andavo spesso, avevo addirittura l'abbonamento e ci ho visto parecchi film sin dalla più tenera età. Sotto casa quasi, prezzo contenuto (o abbonamento) e lontananza dal caos dei multisala. Il top, peccato abbia chiuso grazie alla crisi e ad una gestione non perfetta forse.
Se mi capita di scaricare un film comunque non è mai un film recente o famoso, ma roba particolare che mi consiglia mio zio che cerca film poco conosciuti e ne guarda a centinaia. 

&gt;mp3

L'alternativa alla pirateria ancora non esiste. Lo streaming ancora è in fase embrionale (e lo sarà ancora per molti anni), non mi va di farmi trattare da criminale da Itunes e Amazon e il CD è un formato morto e sepolto che non ha senso di esistere per il prezzo a cui vorrebbero venderlo.

I'd rather everyone just spends 2% of their GDP for EU defense. But they don't. Some countries REALLY insist on being pacifist. In that case, fine, they have a choice. Either they build a respectable military force relative to their size (ie, with 2% of their GDP), or they ""delegate"", and by that I mean they give 2% of their GDP to an allied EU nation which is willing to offer defense.

This isn't unheard of. I mean there are plenty of small countries which don't have an army at all, and delegate their defense to another sovereign nation. The EU, however, is different. We're an economic union. The burden of military defense shouldn't be on the UK and France (and a few smaller nations) only. If an EU country doesn't want to waste its time on building an army, it should at least help finance those willing to build a military force capable of defending the EU. It's the least they can do, considering they won't risk the lives of their citizens in case of war.

Even very small countries like Luxembourg could just offer 2%. If need be, Luxembourg could be represented relatively to their financial contribution in some military/political counsel.

&gt;**Total war** is a [war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War) in which a [belligerent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belligerent) engages in the complete [mobilization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization) of all available [resources](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production) and [population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population).

&gt;In the mid-19th century, ""total war"" was identified by scholars as a separate class of warfare. In a total war, there is less differentiation between [combatants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combatants) and [non-combatants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-combatants) than in other conflicts, and sometimes no such differentiation at all, as nearly every human resource, combatants and non-combatants alike, can be considered to be part of the belligerent [war effort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_effort).

Of course, Turkey is also a member of NATO, so if there were to be a conflict between NATO and Russia, Turkey could easily use their NATO obligations to justify closing off the Bosphorus to the Russians. But things would have to get pretty far for that to happen.

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"&gt;Das ist auch eine Art von Zensur, nicht staatlich sondern zivilgesellschaftlich.

Was für ein Unsinn. Zensur ist die Unterdrückung oder Abschaffung der Freiheit, Informationen zu verbreiten, bzw deren Inhalte zu kontrollieren.

Wenn zufällig alle Verlage der Welt sich frei von äußeren Zwängen dazu entscheiden, dass Sarrazin ein Vollidiot ist und sie seinen Müll nicht abdrucken wollen, dann ist das einfach keine Zensur. Wie auch?!

&gt;Vielleicht meinst du, dass man Sarrazin nicht mit Orwell vergleichen kann, dass er Intoleranz und Lügen verbreitet etc., und dass deshalb zivilgesellschaftliche Zensur gerechtfertigt ist. Aber das läuft darauf hinaus, Zensur nur dann zu verurteilen, wenn man mit der zensierten Meinung übereinstimmt. Es sind aber gerade die Meinungen, die unbeliebt, ja verhasst sind (im Falle der zivilgesellschaftlichen Zensur vor allem von denen, die etwas mit Verlagswesen oder Journalismus zu tun haben, also vorwiegend in links-intellektuellen Kreisen) die Schutz vor Zensur am meisten brauchen.

Extrembeispiel: Willste mir jetzt sagen, dass es schlimme ""zivilgesellschaftliche"" Zensur sei, wenn sich zufällig alle Verlage der Welt einigen, faschistisches Gedankengut nicht abzudrucken und zu verbreiten?

Ich nenne sowas Vernunft, aber nicht Zensur. Dann wäre das Gegenteil von der Zensur ja der Zwang zum Abdruck von ideologischem Müll und das kann nicht der Sinn des Ganzen sein.

(Und v.a. wie sollte man vor dieser angeblichen Zensur in einer freien Gesellschaft deiner Meinung nach ""schützen"", wenn doch gerade die Entscheidung **gegen** Sarrazin frei gewählt worden wäre? Dann wären wir ja auch wieder beim Gegenteil von Freiheit, also Zwang. Und der liegt wiederrum auch Zensur zugrunde.)

Ich würde halt einfach gerne in so einer Gesellschaft leben, in der Sarrazin und seinesgleichen einfach keine Zuhörer und Unterstützer, geschweige denn monetär profitierende Verleger hat.

Ist das schlimm sich sowas zu wünschen? Ist das der Wunsch nach Zensur?

Ich wäre nie dafür solche Vollidioten wie Sarrazin in der Realität tatsächlich (staatlich) zu zensieren, das ist nicht vereinbar mit der FDG und dafür sind die auch viel zu lustig. Aber wenn du meinen Wunsch nach einer vernünftigen Gesellschaft als Wunsch nach Zensur bezeichnest, dann wünsche Ich mir echt gerne so manche ""Zensur"".

Und die Untergrundverbreitung schändlichen Gedankenguts erübrigt sich eigentlich auch in meiner Wunschgesellschaft, weil da von vornerein eigentlich niemand so einem ideologischen Müll anhängen sollte. Denn genaugenommen wünsche ich mir sogar eher eie Gesellschaft, in der es Leute wie Sarrazin gar nicht erst gibt. Davon mal abgesehen.

I don't think anyone is circlejerking about evil Putin vs innocent Ukraine, because in this case Ukraine *is* innocent. It has been demonstrated time and time again that the rationale for the Russian 'intervention' was a bullshit pretext. Regardless, it's understandable from the Baltics and Poland because they have a very strong vested interest in anchoring Ukraine to the west, as well as because of historical mistreatments of Russians against those countries (it was only a little over 20 years ago that the Russians shot hundreds of people in Lithuania). It's not an argument about Black and White, it's an argument about factually correct, and blatant Russian propaganda.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Colgo l'occasione per dire la mia opinione sul diritto d'autore.

È una boiata.

Prima di tutto specifico di che parlo: il diritto d'autore è inteso per colui che scopre qualcosa (chiamiamolo scopritore), per qualsiasi finalità, e ne registra la proprietà, guadagnando la capacità di gestire il modo in cui se ne può usufruire.

Alcuni esempi sono: quadri, libri, film, musica, medicinali (sì, intendo anche quello) etc.

Ora, vediamo su che basi viene costruito il diritto d'autore: di solito si dice che gli scopritori devono pur mangiare. Su questa base dovremmo però chiederci perché. Se la finalità è artistica, o sociale (come un farmaco) non deve essere retribuita, ma va fatta per passione e per un fine umano. Si può contraddire che alla fine è un lavoro, ma così non è: un lavoratore non guadagna diritto d'autore (non devi prendere dei diritti su come si fa un muro e farti pagare dagli altri che usano la ""tua"" stessa tecnica). Di solito questa linea di difesa è portata a dire: se io faccio qualcosa è giusto che venga pagato. Ma si paga per dimostrare la propria riconoscenza o per ricevere qualcosa. A questo punto potremmo facilmente dire che è meglio quando uno scopritore usa il sistema del finanziamento o delle donazioni piuttosto che quello della rapina nonviolenta.

In fondo uno scopritore non fa altro che scoprire prima di qualcun altro un metodo per fare qualcosa. Gli si può dare il merito di essere stato il primo, e ringraziarlo per questo, ma pretendere altro è da pazzi.

L'unica cosa che si può chiedere è: siccome sono bravo a scoprire questo genere di cose è meglio finanziarmi e permettermi di continuare a farlo così da aumentare la possibilità di nuove scoperte che aiutino le persone. Così ha senso. Fare una canzone e farci la bella vita sopra, costruirsi un personaggio per pretendere di soldi, col cazzo.


Perciò sono a favore della pirateria, in ogni forma. Se poi in qualche modo date sul supporto allo scopritore è una vostra scelta, ma di sicuro non è un obbligo.

Die Nato-Beitritte osteuropäischer Länder sind ein Beispiel dafür.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"I posted this elsewhere about what happens if Russia completely invades Ukraine, but I'll do so again here because it's relevant

Hard economic sanctions on Russia until Putin relents and withdraws all troops from the Ukraine and sets stable long term gas prices for the EU and Ukraine on a collective basis (to prevent punitive measures afterwards) is the best way to deal with the situation here. It is absolutely unacceptable to have an occupied (and possibly annexed) country right on the EU's borders with no repercussions, that would tell the world that the EU is a joke and would signal to others that the West's dominance is at a clear end.

Economic sanctions would be effective because Putin's regime is kept afloat through a careful balancing act of keeping the oligarchs happy, and by promising a modicum of economic stability to the country to the regular people. An overwhelming majority of the voters recall the economic chaos in the years following 'shock therapy' in Russia following the collapse of the Soviet Union, where the economy just... didn't function, whilst the oligarchs want to be able to have easy travel and access to the West, whilst also keeping their enterprises in Russia in good shape. Economic sanctions threaten both those groups, as Russian foreign exchange reserves are abyssmal and the terms of trade could quickly turn very bad for Russia. The change in the Ruble alone, since the crisis began, has made imports a lot more expensive. Putin wants to keep his regime together, and he can't do that under sustained economic sanctions.

Especially if Europe targets Russian energy exports, then Putin's regime is fucked. Gazprom currently accounts for about 20% of the Russian government's income. As imports become more expensive and the state is able to fund fewer services, social unrest will build to a critical point until Putin will have no choice except to either escalate or withdraw.

Now, this plan is not without risks. It kind of puts Putin's back up against the wall. The challenge for the West will be give to find some token symbolic victory for him that he can play up back at home so that he doesn't escalate.

There would be some economic troubles in Europe as a consequence. But such sanctions would not have to be kept up for long to have an effect given what I said earlier (in fact, given the waffling the West has done thus far, it might be a short sharp wake up call that he didn't expect and so would convince him to back down), and it would be worth it for the following reasons:

* It would absolutely preserve the legitimacy of the NPT int he eyes of the world. Ukraine gave up it's nukes in exchange for assurances about it's territorial integrity. States will be considerably more likely to follow a nuclear path if Ukraine doesn't keep Crimea.

* It would reaffirm many aspects of international law, especially the Helsinki Accords. Maintaining the sanctity of international law is an absolute good, it's long been in too precarious a state.

* It would represent a big change from the world seeing Europe as a laughable international entity, to one that can actually achieve collective action.

* It would help anchor Ukraine firmly in the West's sphere of influence.

With all this in consideration, I can't help but think that stronger measures is something that Europe absolutely has to do, instead of acting in the decrepit fashion it has been for decades.",0,1393893283,null,0,false,0,cfto18p,t3_1zh89k,t1_cfto18p,t1_cftnova,null,1432645490,-9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-9

true,JasonWaterfall,null,null,"&gt;Was für ein Unsinn. Zensur ist die Unterdrückung oder Abschaffung der Freiheit, Informationen zu verbreiten, bzw deren Inhalte zu kontrollieren.

Wenn aber eines der wichtigsten Mittel, Informationen zu verbreiten ist, von einem großen Verlag abgedruckt und vermarktet zu werden, und somit diese Verlage kontrollieren, welche Inhalte Verbreitung finden, dann scheint das von mir beschriebene Phänomen selbst deine Definition von Zensur zu erfüllen.
Zumindest eine Einengung der von dir beschriebenen Freiheit ist definitiv gegeben.

&gt;Extrembeispiel: Willste mir jetzt sagen, dass es schlimme ""zivilgesellschaftliche"" Zensur sei, wenn sich zufällig alle Verlage der Welt einigen, faschistisches Gedankengut nicht abzudrucken und zu verbreiten?

Ja, das ist genau das was ich sagen will (und wäre wohl kaum Zufall). 
Was macht es für einen Unterschied, ob die Mächtigen im Staatsapparat eine Meinung unterdrücken, oder ob die Mächtigen in der Medienlandschaft das selbe tun?  
Ob das jetzt faschistisches Gedankengut ist oder nicht, sollte keinen Unterschied machen. Wir müssen ja eine allgemeine Regel finden, wie mit solchen unpopulären Meinungen umgegangen werden soll. Wir können nicht sagen ""unpopuläre Meinungen dürfen/sollen unterdrückt (oder wie auch immer du das jetzt nennen willst) werden, aber nur wenn sie offensichtlich falsch oder schädlich sind"", weil wir ja nicht wissen können, was falsch ist, wenn wir keinen gesellschaftlichen Diskurs darüber zulassen, bei dem sich die besseren Ideen durchsetzen können.
Beim Faschismus spezifisch ist es zugegeben nicht sehr wahrscheinlich, dass es zu einer völligen Neubewertung kommt, aber umgekehrt ist die Gefahr, dass ein paar pro-faschistische Bücher reißenden Absatz finden und Deutschland politisch umkrempeln würden, wenn die Verlage sie drucken würden, auch nicht besonders hoch.
Verallgemeinert: Wenn eine Idee offensichtlich falsch ist, dann kann es auch nicht so gefährlich sein, sie offen zu diskutieren.
Wenn man aber glaubt, dass sie populär wäre, dann muss man sich fragen warum, und sollte sich mmn. der öffentlichen Diskussion stellen.

Jetzt könnte man natürlich sagen:""Die Idee ist schlecht, und wir (im Journalismus und Verlagswesen etc.) erkennen das ob unserer überlegenen Bildung, aber der Pöbel versteht nichts von diesen Dingen und lässt sich leicht in die Irre führen.""
Aber so toll Bildung auch sein mag, ideologische Scheuklappen ziehen sich quer durch alle Bildungsschichten, und zu glauben, dass eine kleine, ideologisch homogene Gruppe immer weiß, was richtig ist, ist Hybris. 

&gt;Dann wäre das Gegenteil von der Zensur ja der Zwang zum Abdruck von ideologischem Müll und das kann nicht der Sinn des Ganzen sein.

Wenn einzelne Verlage aus persönlich-ideologischen Gründen das Drucken eines Buches ablehnen, dann habe ich damit kein Problem. Wenn alle Verlage das gleiche Buch ablehnen, nicht, weil es keinen Markt gibt, sondern weil sie jeder einzeln es nicht mit ihrem Gewissen vereinbaren können, es zu drucken, dann sehe ich ein Problem mit der ideologischen Homogenität der Medienlandschaft, aber würde (tendenziell, so genau hab ich darüber noch nicht nachgedacht) keinem einzelnen Verlag die moralische Pflicht auferlegen, das Buch trotzdem zu drucken.
Aber ich habe deinen ursprünglichen Kommentar als das genaue Gegenstück interpretiert, nämlich als die Behauptung einer moralischen Pflicht, das Buch *nicht* zu drucken, auch wenn ein Verlag das eigentlich will, und dem muss ich aus den oben genannten Gründen entschieden widersprechen.

&gt;Ich würde halt einfach gerne in so einer Gesellschaft leben, in der Sarrazin und seinesgleichen einfach keine Zuhörer und Unterstützer, geschweige denn monetär profitierende Verleger hat.

Naja, das wünsch ich mir auch, aber natürlich brauchts keine Meinungsfreiheit, wenn alle einer (vorzugsweise meiner) Meinung sind. Dann brauchts auch keine (Selbst-) Zensur der Medien, weil gegenteilige Meinungen eh keiner liest und deshalb kein Profit aus ihnen zu schlagen ist.

&gt;Wo ist denn da eigentlich der Unterschied zu heute? Nur dass ""glücklicherweise"" die rechten Flügel der Volksparteien und den rest eben die rechten Splitterparteien die 15% unter sich aufteilen.

Bin Österreicher und kann zu Deutschland nicht so viel sagen, aber hier eine Anekdote aus Österreich:
Hier ist das Ausländerthema in den letzten Jahren etwas in den Hintergrund getreten, aber zur Blütezeit der (sehr rechten) FPÖ, als diese zweitstärkste Partei wurde etc., waren viele Kommentatoren auch auf Seiten der Linken der Meinung, die FPÖ sei so stark geworden, weil sich die anderen Parteien geweigert hätten zuzugeben und zu thematisieren, dass es in Sachen Immigration überhaupt ein Problem gibt.
Statt das Problem zu ignorieren, hätte man vielleicht besser den gehässigen Sprüchen humane Lösungsvorschläge entgegengesetzt.

Aber beim Thema Immigration zeigt sich eben auch das Problem mit dem Glauben, die Intellektuellen in Medienkreisen wüssten alles besser, und das Problem sei die Dummheit des gemeinen Volkes: Wenn niedrig qualifizierte Arbeitskräfte zuwandern, sind es nicht die Hochgebildeten, sondern die Hilfsarbeiter, die vermehrter Konkurrenz ausgesetzt sind. 
Und es sind nicht die Politiker in den Nobelbezirken, die im Gemeindebau auf engem Raum mit ganz anderen Kulturen zurechtkommen müssen.
Deshalb halte ich es für wichtig, sich auf die Debatte einzulassen und sie nicht von vornherein durch Beschämen und Zensieren (oder was auch immer) potenzieller Gegner abzuwürgen: Nicht nur dass man dadurch niemanden überzeugt, man beraubt sich auch selbst der Chance den Gegner zu verstehen, was unabdingbar ist um ihn auf anderem Wege doch zu überzeugen oder, Gott behüte, seine eigene Meinung zu ändern.",0,1393895177,null,0,false,0,cftow5z,t3_1zfcq5,t1_cftow5z,t1_cftmii8,null,1432645888,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

&gt; Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security .

First of all, relations with Ukraine were never great after '89 but the coldness culminated with the trial for the Black Sea Plateau dispute at Hague won by Romania. Besides this trial Romania has a minority of ethnics in Ukraine, and let's say  they didn't receive stellar treatment so far. 

Second of all Romania's goals in the Eastern vicinity portray to Moldova, the second Romanian state which, as does Ukraine, has a significant Russian minority. Besides this minority there's also a frozen conflict, with a separatist region, where Russian ethnics form a majority with Russian boots on the ground in Transnistria, much like what Crimea seems to become. The goal of Romania is to manage to pull Moldova in the EU, and this  won't happen without the Russian troops leaving the territory of Moldova, or separation from Transnistria. 

Add to that historical bad relations with Russia, a big chunk of gas imports , and no real lever of negotiation and you can see why Romania is and should tread very lightly regarding the situation..

true,intangible-tangerine,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Yeah, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands have also already stated that they don't want trade sanctions - because they didn't work in 2008 when Russia invaded Georgia and Russia can retaliate by cutting off gas and oil supplies to Eastern Europe. But let's make it all about British bankers. 

Europe is not going to use trade sanctions against Russia at this juncture for the exact same reason that the US did not criticise the Saudi government whilst it was dependent on Saudi oil. 

Until we get all those alternative energy sources covering our energy needs Europe needs Russian gas and oil. If we don't buy it Eastern Europe suffers just as much as Russia does. 

And no, oil and gas is not just about the rich people who own the companies and profit from it, ordinary people need to be able to heat their homes and fill up their petrol tanks. The consequences when Russia have cut supplies in the past have been very bad and that's why Europe backed down every time.  

It's a shitty world in which Russia holds the cards, but it's the world we have. Sanctions have been tried in the past against Russia and have never worked. If we want to put real pressure on Russia and not just posture than the options are supporting an internal regime change or military intervention. 

Sanctions would be a game of bluff, Russia is not Iran or North Korea. It would just result in tit-for-tat until one side backed down because neither Russia nor Europe could manage without the oil and gas flowing for very long at all. 

Oh and the city of London is Europe's financial capital, what Cameron wants to protect it from is the impact of another potential Eurozone crisis that would be triggered if economies dependent on Russian trade and fuel imports suddenly retract. 

So far, the situation in Crimea has not turned very violent, yes people have been killed, but it's not all out war..yet...so far the costs of sanctions are not justified by the gains that could be got from them, because like in Georgia Putin would still be able to entrench his position. If he goes further in to Ukraine then sanctions along with other actions will be back on the table, but we have nothing to gain by raising the stakes before he does.

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"&gt; Was macht es für einen Unterschied, ob die Mächtigen im Staatsapparat eine Meinung unterdrücken, oder ob die Mächtigen in der Medienlandschaft das selbe tun?

Lenk doch nicht mit vertikalen Machtunterschieden im Hinlick auf Zensur ab. Das war alles eine fiktive Vorstellung, eine Welt in der einfach (möglichst) jeder Leute wie Sarrazin ablehnt und boykottiert. Eine Utopie praktisch.

Da kannst du in deinem folgenden Abschnitt noch so viele geistige Ergüsse über Meinungsfreiheit haben, eine Welt ohne Knallidioten wie Sarrazin wäre nun mal supergeil. Das ist zwar alles aus meiner Position gelabert, aber ich glaube, bei ganz objektiver Betrachtung Sarrazins seltsamer argumentativer Strukturen und Logik, kommen da sogar noch einige mehr Leute dahinter.

Also frag Ich mich jetzt erst mal, was es bringen soll, wenn du vage Wunschvorstellungen die einer persönlichen und idealistischen (egal mit welchen Werten, hier natürlich mit meinen Werten) Gesellschaftsutopie entspringen, 1:1 in die Realität überträgst.

Was du da redest das weiß ich erstens selber und zweitens geht es an meiner fiktiven Vorstellung einer für mich utopischen Gesellschaft grandios vorbei.

So läuft das nunmal: Man wünscht sich einfach das Blaue vom Himmel ohne tatsächlichen Realisierungsanspruch. Hast du das noch nie gemacht?

&gt;Wenn einzelne Verlage aus persönlich-ideologischen Gründen das Drucken eines Buches ablehnen, dann habe ich damit kein Problem. Wenn alle Verlage das gleiche Buch ablehnen, nicht, weil es keinen Markt gibt, sondern weil sie jeder einzeln es nicht mit ihrem Gewissen vereinbaren können, es zu drucken, dann sehe ich ein Problem mit der ideologischen Homogenität der Medienlandschaft, aber würde (tendenziell, so genau hab ich darüber noch nicht nachgedacht) keinem einzelnen Verlag die moralische Pflicht auferlegen, das Buch trotzdem zu drucken. Aber ich habe deinen ursprünglichen Kommentar als das genaue Gegenstück interpretiert, nämlich als die Behauptung einer moralischen Pflicht, das Buch nicht zu drucken, auch wenn ein Verlag das eigentlich will, und dem muss ich aus den oben genannten Gründen entschieden widersprechen.

Siehste, und das fänd Ich ja eigentlich doch ganz geil. Denn in meiner Wunschgesellschaft soll es natürlich erstmal keine Sarrazins geben und dementsprechend auch eher keine Anhänger solcher Typen geben. Und dann druckts natürlich auch niemand, weil ihn weder jemand verantworten, noch lesen möchte.
&gt;Naja, das wünsch ich mir auch, aber natürlich brauchts keine Meinungsfreiheit, wenn alle einer (vorzugsweise meiner) Meinung sind. Dann brauchts auch keine (Selbst-) Zensur der Medien, weil gegenteilige Meinungen eh keiner liest und deshalb kein Profit aus ihnen zu schlagen ist.

In meiner kleinen Gesellschaftsutopie muss ja nich jeder meine Meinung haben. Wär aber schon, wenn es keine dümmlichen Sarrazins, Luckes, Apfels, usw gäbe. Dann wär die Welt gleich schöner.

&gt;Bin Österreicher und kann zu Deutschland nicht so viel sagen, aber hier eine Anekdote aus Österreich: Hier ist das Ausländerthema in den letzten Jahren etwas in den Hintergrund getreten, aber zur Blütezeit der (sehr rechten) FPÖ, als diese zweitstärkste Partei wurde etc., waren viele Kommentatoren auch auf Seiten der Linken der Meinung, die FPÖ sei so stark geworden, weil sich die anderen Parteien geweigert hätten zuzugeben und zu thematisieren, dass es in Sachen Immigration überhaupt ein Problem gibt. Statt das Problem zu ignorieren, hätte man vielleicht besser den gehässigen Sprüchen humane Lösungsvorschläge entgegengesetzt.

&gt;Aber beim Thema Immigration zeigt sich eben auch das Problem mit dem Glauben, die Intellektuellen in Medienkreisen wüssten alles besser, und das Problem sei die Dummheit des gemeinen Volkes: Wenn niedrig qualifizierte Arbeitskräfte zuwandern, sind es nicht die Hochgebildeten, sondern die Hilfsarbeiter, die vermehrter Konkurrenz ausgesetzt sind. Und es sind nicht die Politiker in den Nobelbezirken, die im Gemeindebau auf engem Raum mit ganz anderen Kulturen zurechtkommen müssen. Deshalb halte ich es für wichtig, sich auf die Debatte einzulassen und sie nicht von vornherein durch Beschämen und Zensieren (oder was auch immer) potenzieller Gegner abzuwürgen: Nicht nur dass man dadurch niemanden überzeugt, man beraubt sich auch selbst der Chance den Gegner zu verstehen, was unabdingbar ist um ihn auf anderem Wege doch zu überzeugen oder, Gott behüte, seine eigene Meinung zu ändern.

Schön, dass du mir auch hier die Grundlagen der demokratischen Diskussionskultur erklärst. Hätte ohne dich fast vergessen wie das geht ;)

Most of us would be willing to take this burden I wager but our own Elite class are not and Ukraine is not worth the political clout our politicians will take from this privaledged and money obsessed few if they did take what only amounts to a small financial sacrifice.

&gt;The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (or Union; since the 17th century often referred to as the Republic of Poland[4] and after 1791 officially the Commonwealth of Poland, Respublica Poloniae) was a dualistic state of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch. **It was one of the largest[5][6] and one of the most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe**, with some 390,000 square miles (1,000,000 km2)[7] and a multi-ethnic population of 11 million at its peak in the early 17th century.[8]

Specifically, from the article:

&gt; Europe accounts for around a third of Gazprom's total gas sales, and around half of Russia's total budget revenue comes from oil and gas.

But the government in place was not voted in. The Crimean population certainly had no say in it. And this government acted as if it had the legitimacy to overturn law recognising Russian as a second language, and toughen up dual citizenship laws. 

Yanukovich on the other hand was voted in. And with the new government no being recognised in Crimea, he is still seen as the nation leader. And he did ask for Russia to intervene.
