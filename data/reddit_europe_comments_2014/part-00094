* Roman theatre 

* Muralla púnica

* Castillo de la concepción

* Refugios antiaereos (quite expensive and very small)

* Naval museum (with the first electric submarine)

* Cartagena is also know for it modernism architecture...

If you got a car , go and visit ""Castillitos"" and ""Batería de Cenizas"" (abandoned military coast fortress), Portman's bay, some of the old mines of La Unión, La Manga...


Anyway, cost of things:
I'm paying 400€/month for two-bedroom flat, it could be cheaper if further from the city centre.

Mobile plans: I have 4€/month for 500Mb with PEPEPHONE, but you have to check yourself, Tuenti, Yoigo, MasMovil,... those are the cheapest I think

Groceries are cheap, but I can not tell you how much

Train is expensive, bus in cartagena is around 1.10 - 1.20€ I think (inisde Cartagena), around 3.20-3.60€ Cartagena-Murcia

true,essaloniki,GREE,Greece,"&gt;Where only a few percent of the population were actually allowed to vote.

Yes, you are right. I dont want only few percent of the population to vote, but the whole population. (18+ years old)

&gt;Yes, so why did you vote for them then?

Personally, i didn't vote them. I suppose people voted because they thought, were the least worse than others. Also, don't forget that ND is one of the two parties that brung us in this situation. 

&gt;That is impossible, for several reasons. Say that you want higher pensions, lower taxes and retire early. And then you vote no to no more loans? And, democracy doesn't mean that every single thing should be voted on. Then people would have to vote every day, not have time to work etc. That is why we have parliaments, so they can vote every day for us. It is completely unrealistic to sat that the public should vote on every single issue.

We could just decide the major issues, like this multi-law ""packet"" We have the means to achieve a more direct democracy and avoid corruption. You say that, by revolution the minority will decide of majority. I say, that this is happening today not only in Greece but everywhere in the world. The elite decides, the ones that have capital and its absurd to believe the opposite. 

&gt;If you don't like the system you have why have you created it, kept it, voted for it, and why can't you change it democratically?

The same answer as in the question ""Why people accept poverty"". Because they are apolitical and they are a huge propaganda against the ones that try to change the way the system is. I can not believe people in 2014, still accept the fact that there are people who die in hunger while in the 1st world throw food away. Also, i can not believe people accept that fact that they are poor and don't know whom to blame or don't even react.
In addition, in every riot, the police is there and use violence even when there is absolutely no need. (Against disabled people, old people, etc) Even if somehow i could gather millions of people who want to overthrow government, government will try to break this gathering. For example in June or July 2011, they wanted to sign a similar to this recent multi-law ""packet"". They gathered people with masks and sticks to provoke police and break the gathering. 
With this, even if people wanted democratically and peaceful want to overthrow the current government is pretty difficult.

Ps. on many of these events i mentioned, there photos/videos.

And the collective desire to be together and linger makes street food less appealing. Not to mention the taboo of being seen eating while walking down the street. If you are over 10, you're going to get some disapproving looks for sure.

The closest you might come to serious ""street food"" are the tostas and tapas you can take to go during the Rastro.

For instance it would add the value of the benefit a British citizen received in the form of national health ""insurance"" to their income. 

The problem with this is it does not take into account the differing costs between services in different countries. So say the median income was $10,000 PPP for the UK and $15,000 for the US. Say the UK citizen got a $3,000 credit for the benefit of his healthcare, but similar care might cost the American $5000. The real value of the British benefit is added back in, but the fact the market price is higher in the US is not taken into account. The equivilized values would be $13,000 UK, $15,000 US (at least that's how I read it after reading their methodology) despite the actual purchasing power being the same after healthcare purchases, $10,000.

Eviction can be a lengthy process, so in an imbalanced market with a lot more demand than supply they can comfortable ask for evidence that you will be able to pay and apply that strictly as a filter. If they don’t get concrete evidence of that, they can just pick someone else who can provide evidence.

Nevertheless, it’s never wrong to try and communicate if you can’t provide the specific type of evidence they are asking for. Maybe some will still be unwilling to talk (because they have so many interested people they don’t have to), but I would guess that at least some are more receptive.

Just think about what they want to hear. How can you demonstrate that you will be able to pay for the apartment in the future? What are your sources of income? How steady are those? How can you provide evidence on how steady those sources of income are? Just try and answer those questions.

(And just a tip: Be straightforward. Tell them right away what information you can’t provide and what alternatives you have. Especially when someone is renting something out privately a lot depends on whether they think they can trust you. If it looks like you are hiding something not even the most convincing evidence that you can pay steadily will convince them. I see it with my parents all the time. They rent out three apartments in a house they inherited from my grandparents – in a much less crowded market than Hamburg – and if it seems like potential candidates are hiding something that tends to immediately kill their chances, pretty much no matter what.)

Please note that you don’t have to show renters anything – but they can also just refuse if you don’t. However, some documents may be of a confidential nature (e.g. an employment contract), so you definitely don’t have to and should not show those documents. There should, however, be alternative ways to prove, for example, your employment.

I nevertheless fear you might be destined for WG life, at least for a bit longer. Sucks. And the fucked up apartment market in Hamburg sucks, too. Good luck!

* These countries are all members of the EU and NATO

* Many EU member states have big business interests in the region (Sweden is by far the biggest foreign investor in the Baltic region, but this is true also for Finland, Denmark, Germany and lately Poland)

This is why any Russian aggression would most likely be met with a total (more or less) world-wide boycott of their economy and a military response from a number of nations. Russia would suffer badly... and for what? Sorry if I hurt some feelings here, but the Baltic states doesn't hold any significant amount of valuable natural resources or is a strategic landmass worth all that trouble. Putin may be an asshole, but he's not dumb.

That being said, I think it's important that the EU member states stop being so naive about their energy policies and increase military spending, because Russia is clearly moving in the wrong direction, and its shameful that we still expect the US to bail us out whenever there is trouble.

I was on my way back to Diyarbakir to spend a few days there (but that got cut short due to the PKK activists being murdered in Paris). Im a 186 cm, white, American with blond hair and blue eyes, so I didn't exactly fit in. People there even told me to stay inside because I was ""too white"" after the murders, so I left back to Istanbul early.

On my way from Iraq to Diyarbakir I ended up in Cizre. I paid for a taxi ride the entire way. I know because I gave a friend I made the phone and he spoke to them in Kurdish and verified I'd be in a shared taxi the whole way. But the taxi company dropped me off at an abandoned bus depot in Cizre, paid for my bus ticket, and left. After sitting there for a while this group of teens came in and said ""money, money"" and I said no. They came back with a knife. I stood up to them and they kept their distance a little bit. Then the guy from the bus station saw and helped get them out of there. 

Although I guess it all worked out in the end. With the border crossing I got to talk to a guy from Mosul, Iraq for about 5 hours. He didn't speak much English but we made due. Mosul has been kind of a flash point since US intervention there, so I got to get an insider's perspective on things, which is incredibly rare.

So long story short, I wasn't supposed to be there. But the taxi company ripped me off so I was stuck there. Such a long stressful day. With the Iraq/Turkey border crossing taking hours, waiting hours for the next bus in Cizre, almost getting robbed, etc. I was so exhausted. If the nice people on the bus didn't wake me up I would have completely slept through my stop (and I dont even remember falling asleep, I was trying not to).

Stay in a small village near [Vaison-la-Romaine](http://www.vaison-la-romaine.com/spip.php?page=history-heritage) (that's where I live). It's a very nice small town that has great Roman remains, including a theatre and 2 whole roman city neighborhoods; you can walk around in their streets.

For accommodation, find a nice B&amp;B (""chambre d'hotes"" in French) - much more authentic than a hotel.

Also, beware of distances when there's no autoroute. We have a lot of hills and mountains, so 2 cities that look close by on a map may be further apart than they seem.


Personally, I'd stay 3 days in this area ([Avignon](http://www.avignon-tourisme.com/menu/discover-35-2.html)-Orange-Vaison) and then move further South. Stay a night around Nîmes (visit the arena) and the Pont du Gard (another must see). Also worth it (count a whole day): [Les Baux de Provence](http://www.lesbauxdeprovence.com/en) (covers the castle aspect of your trip), if you go there, make sure to stop at the [Cathédrale des Lumières](http://www.carrieres-lumieres.com/en/home), it's a sound and light show in the bauxite mines at walking distance from les Baux. You walk right through moving projections of great paintings of famous French artists. Google it, but be aware it's not possible to truly capture the experience on photo, you just have to be there to get the whole impression.

Then either turn east to visit the Mediterranean coast - Marseille then continue to the French Riviera with Cannes, the various famous beach towns (St. Tropez etc.) [Nice](http://en.nicetourisme.com/) (my favorite city!) and Monaco. Or turn south east to [Carcassonne](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/345) and [Perpignan](http://www.perpignantourisme.com/gb). Though personally, if I had to choose between Carcassonne and Les Baux, I'd choose Les Baux.

EDIT: if you want more info concerning anything in the South, just ask!

Also: getting a rental car is the best way to visit around here. By far the best to get to many of the smaller towns/villages and you'll be able to stop where you want. Most agencies allow you to rent in one place and drop the car off in another. So you could f.e. go by train to Avignon, rent a car and drive it to Nice Airport.

You can explain about 40% of Russian nationalism with their quest for warm ports.

And Putin has certainly reignited Russian nationalism. He explained his recent actions as ""defending Russian minority against fascism"". Now it could only take some Latvian bald idiots to force Russian idiots like Zhirinovsky to pressure puting to defend Russian minority against ""Latvian fascism"". Putin might do it if he's reasonable enough that NATO will not intervene. He doesn't even have to enter these with the army - he could start a coup or a revolution, for instance and then attempt to ""stabilize the region"". And as you say yourself, Baltics don't have any valuable resources nor they are in strategic position - and that also holds true for the West.

The stake is Riga and Klaipeda, and the fate of Russian minority in the Baltics. Would the Putin gamble WWIII for these? Probably not at the moment, he's still eyeing Ukraine and Transnistria. But if the sanctions could become, you know, effective and they actually hurt Russian economy, even if only potentially, then all hell can break loose.

One thing we know -- the ocean levels will rise (are rising). We're realtively safe from that danger -- the Baltic is separated by Danish straits from the North Sea. And we only have the Tricity on the coast. I mean, due to climate change the **whole** Amsterdam can end up underwater. No money could buy you out of this. And I don't think moving the whole city is viable -- it will just be destroyed, kind of like it's happened to New Orleans after Katrina. I can't even imagine the scale of losses. This is the fate of many coastal cities in the world. Poland's got 99 problems but that one isn't ours :).

true,[deleted],null,null,"The problem is that this kind of thing does not depend on the rules and laws and unions and whatnot. It is entirely personal.  Let me share a story.

My wife was cleaning hotel rooms in Schladming. And if you look at the rules, it was fine, no overtime etc. etc. But basically she was given 40 rooms to clean a day, and this is something you cannot regulate against. And it was incredibly stressful and the only way to do it was to cheat - clock out then go back and finish it. And no, she could not have been fired for not finishing, the worker protection was good. But. But!

But she could still have hew self-esteem destroyed by constant criticism and chewing. Even when the boss said nothing, just glaring and like sending negative vibes made her think she is worthless, she dreaded going to work, because the positive motivation, the good feelings were not there. And yes, these negative feelings forced her to quit. Easier than firing people.

And this is something you cannot legislate or unionize against.

So I am saying, these rules are not so important - they do not help much. If your employer wants to destroy your self-esteem or your good feelings and positive vibes about your work, and force you to quit that way, they can. No amount of rules and unions can change it.

So at the end of the all these rules and unions are not much use. Actually unions are useful for bargaining salaries, but for all the other things, protection or dignity - it is simply not possible.",0,1396511320,null,0,false,0,cgiwa37,t3_2213iw,t1_cgiwa37,t1_cgiedep,null,1433189332,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

Smith was aware thart negotiations favor employers because they can easier go for 1 year with 90% capacity than an employee for 1 year with 0 income. Smith also talked about the idea of the fair wage - this is basically a social agreement, if society thinks a good, industrious worker must be able to afford a linen shirt (in the 1700s) and people not wearing linen are lazy, then the fair wage is a wage that affords it.

However Smith was not a social democrat, but something closer to a Distributist. [Distributism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributism) is a similarly third-way idea as Social Democracy, but it is much more natural and simple, because it does not try to ""balance"" Big Capital with Big Government but rather it would keep BOTH small. 

For example in the Disributist a fair wage does neither evolve from a general free market nor from a governmental rule. Collective bargaining is closer, but still no cigar. Instead, if you can distribute productive wealth so that most workers would own some farmland or easy start a small shop so they do not have to depend on wages for surviving  - _then_ the market would evolve a fair wage.

**I would really recommend all Europeans to look into [Distributism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributism) because it is based on a similar set of principles as Social Democracy - combining markets and distributive justice or equitable instutions - but is way less bureaucratic and way more natural and easy.**

I am curious about this rhetoric. Because it sounds like without a minimum wage the employers are ""not allowed"" to pay a decent wage.

I mean practically this can be a good idea, no questions, but the philosophy behind your rhetoric is weird - it suggests that if something is not forced by government it is the same as it not being allowed, it just doesn't happen.

I mean, did anyone at least ponder the opposite: somehow boost the economy so much that there would be a dearth of laborers, there would be a _labor shortage_, and thus employers should compete for employee with higher wages?

Although with EU migrations labor shortages don't really happen, that may be a major reason.

Un libro ti dà un solo punto di vista e raccoglie l'esperienza di una sola persona che non ha contradditorio all'interno del libro stesso. Una sorta di easy-mode del pensiero. Ovviamente uno serio quando scrive pensa alla fondatezza dei suoi argomenti, alle possibili critiche e alle conseguenze della sua pubblicazione, ma tu non le vedi direttamente. 

Su internet, se scrivi una stronzata te lo sbattono in faccia subito. E se non lo fanno, ci metti un attimo a cercare e consultare fonti. È più immediato e ciò tempra il pensiero.

Anche la brevità ha un ruolo fondamentale. Per dire, nella Filosofia si è andati avanti secoli a botte di tomi lunghissimi in cui si sovrappongono centinaia o migliaia di implicazioni che rendono incomprensibile il discorso a chi non ne fa una disamina estremamente approfondita, precludendo di fatto la comprensione. Se tu invece vuoi coltivare il pensiero forte su internet, ad ogni passo devi scontrarti con critiche che individuano le fallacie nel tuo discorso prima che diventi troppo complicato. Se tu scrivi un tomo di 2000 pagine e fai un errore nel tuo ragionamento alla pagina 652, ci vorrà una marea di tempo a trovarla, sopratutto se hai voluto occultarla. Su Internet e in generale nei tempi moderni questo incedere è impossibile.

That isn't true though. Russia has historically sought to control the Baltics because of their strategic location on the Baltic. Russia is pretty much open ground all the way to the Urals. Despite the talk about invading Russia being impossible the truth is both Napoleon and Hitler were able to cross a massive swathe of Russia causing untold destruction to the richest parts of the Russian economy. If anything the problem with Russia is that you can run unchecked for so many miles that your supply lines break from overextension. Controlling the Baltics means that one flank is secured by the sea. This reduces the amount of land that an invasion can realistically go through.

Regardless Russia hasn't invaded these areas time after time because it could. It has done so because it has a long term strategic interest in holding the region much like it has in Crimea.

As for referendums, that would not be a solution in Latvia. We have few municipalities that are clearly Russian-dominated. The most significant Russian-majority place is Daugavpils, the second-largest city, but while the Russian language dominates there, a fair amount of people are Poles, and I doubt that a majority in Daugavpils would sincerely want to be part of Russia. We also have some tiny municipalities like the Zilupe municipality, which is Russian-dominated, but has about 3000 people in total.

Latvia, like many such small countries, is very much centered around the capital.

While both groups mostly get along fine, the political differences are significant.

Salerno is a beautiful city, very different from Sorrento (Salerno is actually a province!) and much less touristy. There's definitely stuff to do in Salerno and you can easily get to Amalfi, Pompei and Positano from Salerno. If you get a rental car, you can also get to Ercolano and Naples.

I absolutely recommend visiting Sorrento for at least one day and stop taking pics of the peninsula on the road, it's awesome.... But please, if you're not staying in Sorrento, do NOT go to Sorrento with a car on a Sunday. The traffic to exit from Sorrento at about 6-7pm is ABSURD and you want to avoid that.

The problem with the national guard is that it's a volunteer formation and guardsmen (except for a few hundred, AFAIK) aren't permanently located on a base or anywhere near their weapons. The guard could be mobilised, but in an event of a real invasion, Russia would first try to seize control over key sites with special forces (like in Crimea), and that would further delay any mobilization. If it takes 3 days or more to mobilise the force, it wouldn't matter at all.

Not to mention the other problem, which is that even of the 5k people in active service, only part has any combat capability.

""Catholic hogwash"". Sure. Because the natural (up to the industrial revolution) way of working, namely that you own the stuff you work with, instead of an employer owning it, like a farmer owns his land a shopkeeper his shop, is ""hogwash"".

Surely it is totally a good idea to keep working for large corporations who separate owning stuff from working with stuff, who separate work time from free time (a farmer would never do that), who make us commute to work instead of just living above our shop, who make us work for strangers instead of having our own neighbors as customers and vendors, and when we realize we get a shitty deal from these big structures, then we set up huge bureaucratic institutions that make a thousand rules and forms to fill to solve it. Sure it all makes sense.

Surely, ending all this and basically having people work form themselves and not for employers, as independent, family businesses, that would be surely hogwash, because there was never such a thing as Bauernhof or a cobbler shop, people always worked for employers, sure.

Surely a small government is some American fanaticism because in 1800 or 1600 European governments were just as big as today. And it surely cannot be that back then they could afford to be small because there was no big business either, and small business does not require big government, so if today we would have a small business world again, like medieval guilds, we would not need big government again.

Seriously, get real. The WHOLE reason we invented big government recently, around 1900, was to somehow deal with big business. Without big business it would be totally unnecessary.

Russian minorities feel entitled to use their language over the official language in all situations. In fact they refuse to learn the Latvian language alltogether, even though we've been a free country for 23ish years now, giving ample time for everyone and their grandma to learn at least a few phrases in Latvian (which they don't). This is a part of the dislike. The dislike also floods into different cultural sectors - many Russians openly parade Soviet and Russian flags during the 9th May celebrations (Soviet symbols are forbidden unless used for educational purposes), which by many Latvians is considered the day when Latvia was occupied by the Soviets officialy (end of WW2, our land was not given sovregnity, Russians just stayed here). Another issue is the Latvian Waffen SS Legioneer parade, which has the same meaning as the Russian 9th May celebration - to give recognition to the fallen Latvian people during World War 2, which both Russians and Russian media describes as a ''meeting of fascists''. I find it terribly offensive that the side that occupied and deported us are hailed as heroes, but only the other side is recognised as fascists (let's exclude the fact that most Latvian SS troopers weren't a part of the Holocaust, and it was recognised in the Nuremburg (no idea how to write this city name) as an organization not responsible for the Holocaust alltogether.

I would also like to mention that the Russians here were forcibly placed here while Latvians were removed, so any question about regions splitting off of Latvia is absolute bullshit, this is has been the Latvian land for centuries, and just because Russians colonized us a few decades ago gives them no casus beli to take away any meter of our land (which they already did in '91).

* EU has no demos; only Nation states have that. Don't believe that statement to be true? Let's look at it:

1. This is backed up by every time there has been a vote (EURO = Sweden and Denmark ""NO""
2. EU Constitution = Holland, France and Ireland ""NO""; Lisbon Treaty = Ireland ""NO"" (then yes until the right answer)) people have voted against the EU political project yet have been betrayed by the EU on their result. This is indisputable factual reality that is recorded observation of a track-record of the undemocratic aka anti-democratic EU. See the Troika for another eg.
3. Finally the UK has not been given a vote since 1975 on a post-legislative referendum for the common market with clear knowledge ahead of time that Community Law &gt;&gt; Common Law of our nation to a level of loss of sovereignty unprecedented. This was known years before the referendum and not divulged to the people hence we know see a political union and a economic relationship.
4. Finally let's look at the EURO: It was clearly known the substantial defects of it's creation and the likely scenario of DIVERGENCE and the answer was ""use that crisis as an opportunity to further integration"". 

Now tell me how democratic and how sane all the above is? If the above is true and it was disseminated more widely it would be the death of the EU instantly imho. This is why the Pro-EU debate has lost the democratic argument and attempts to fear-monger the people about economic arguments and that takes the UK back to 1975 all over again.

* Let's talk about Democracy in a wider picture:

1. Sovereignty of Pariament
2. Laws of the Land and Border security
3. Right to Self-Determination
4. Citizenship

These all come under the general usage of the term ""democratic"" that people use as a ""catch-all"" term. They're right.

* Let's look at the loss of influence and clout the UK has in the EU:

1. UK Percentage of the Vote in the Council of Ministers under QMV = 8.2% (down from 17 in 1973)
2. The Number and UK Percentage of the Vote in the European Parliament = 73/751 ; (down from 19%-9.7%)
3. Number and Percentage of UK appointed Commissioners = 1 (down from 2), 3.6 (%)
4. [BRITAIN’S LACK OF INFLUENCE IN THE EU REVEALED](http://businessforbritain.org/2014/03/25/britains-lack-of-influence-in-the-eu-revealed/)

&gt;*EVERY UK ‘NO’ VOTE SINCE 1996 IGNORED*

&gt;*FOI documents reveal that, since records began in 1996, Britain has opposed 55 measures in the Council of Ministers, and been overruled 55 times Matthew Elliott, CEO of Business for Britain: “It is clear that Britain’s influence in Europe is not as high as many would have us believe. With the EU regularly acting against the UK’s national interest, the Government must push for proper safeguards in the forthcoming renegotiation.”*

&gt;*The clout Britain gets from being in the European Union is a myth, according to a new report.*

&gt;**Smaller countries like Switzerland are able to negotiate better trade deals with other countries than the European Union, it said.**

&gt;*The study by the Civitas think tank will be seized on by Eurosceptic critics of Britain’s membership of the EU as further reasons for why the UK should pull out. It also counters claims by Nick Clegg, the deputy Prime Minister, in his EU debate with Nigel Farage, the UK Independence Party leader, last week.*

&gt;*Mr Clegg has said: “We are better off in Europe - richer, stronger, safer - and that’s why I will fight to keep us in, for the sake of jobs, for the sake of our clout in the world, for the sake of Britain.”*

* Let's talk about the problems of democracy in the UK now:

1. Once out of the EU there will be more representation of all powers in Westminster to then DEVOLVE more locally
2. Voting system, Lords all need reform
3. Recall, Primaries and **DIRECT DEMOCRACY** initiatives all need to be fought for.

The EU by contrast is a centralist Federal structure that takes more powers over time, that makes more laws (eg we'd have 80% less laws in the EEA than present and more influence and it would cost less!) and people would have more say over their country.

TL;DR: That's why people complain the EU is undemocratic

I understand what you are saying, but I don't think British people would feel flattered by this. (I actually find it really surprising that so many Europeans want Britain in the EU but are so against Turkey being in the EU for example. I like Turks just as much as I like other Europeans.)

In the debates about Scottish independence, English politians are careful not to be involved in any of the debates. This is partly because we know that Scotland would hate it if we did get involved. And also the English know that ultimately it is a decision that Scotland must make for itslelf. And so it also is with the UK in the EU.

&gt; Verhofstadt has the same style of Farage, just on the other side.

On the other hand, Clegg is a privileged child who has no idea of what is population target is, how the live and how they think, and even the way he talks unnerves the common people. 

In some ways I agree with this too. Emotional arguments are much more interesting than purely economic arguments. The trouble with this approach is that very few British people really feel European in an emotional way or have an emotional belief in the idea of a common European destiny. British emotional identity is very distinct. 

To appeal to Brits emotionally, all Farage needs to do is quote Shakespeare:

""[This scepter'd isle, this precious stone set in the silver sea, this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/richardii/richardii.2.1.html)""

or perhaps Churchill:

&gt; The real problem is the EU mechanism on this mandates daft stuff like green energy and recycling as the answer. We have been improving the energy efficiency of houses which actually does something. We can generate more clean energy or use less energy. The latter works much better.

Why not both? The EU [20-20-20 objectives](http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/g-gas/progress/index_en.htm) are reaching -20% GHG emissions, 20% share of renewables, and a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020. And EU as whole is well on track to meet those targets, in fact even overshooting the GHG target: [graph](http://i.imgur.com/ntLxuNF)

true,essaloniki,GREE,Greece,"I ll give you an example about the democracy now. Think how many people download illegal things and how much governments around the globe want to limit it. Its disproportionate. (its an example, let us don't discuss about piracy). The same applies about the taxes of the riches/corporations and low-income people. As you said, there is not time to riot every week about every wrong decision.

I agree with you, about the wrong choices all these years. You can't imagine how wrong is our attitude. But all these things happened by our parents and the next generation is just in the eye of tornado. I don't say we should be spared but at least any action taken in order to fix economy should be well thought. Since 2009, the riches became even more richer and the poor people, poorer. That is not good at all. This is a sign that nothing achieved. And believe me, everything falls apart.

Also, if i can recall correctly, there countries that have bigger debt than us and yet we have the most brutal crisis.

Of course, i cant prove that more than 50% percent of population protested and no one cant. But if i was in government's shoes, after all these scandals (just yesterday broke a huge scandal) and all these riots with ridiculous worthless violence i would let people to vote again. Its decent but all these elected people just want to have power.

As for the euro, pretty much the biggest parties want it. As far as i know, syriza, the 2nd biggest party, plans to negotiate the debt by saying: ""We know that the debt is huge.With these actions, we will never be able to pay it. Help us by loosening the actions and we will pay.""
Personally, it looks more feasible than what the government says. Austerity and austerity. Strangely how many countries in Europe don't want austerity but we are ""lucky"" to have austerity!

Not to forget, almost every day there is a gathering about some wrong government's choice.
Also, after the surplus achieved only the police got a 500 euro(!!) raise and some homeless people got some money. If i start bashing the current government it wont end :p",0,1396521336,null,0,false,0,cgixsxv,t3_21ybdy,t1_cgixsxv,t1_cgivfzc,null,1433190048,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I don't think this statement was racist or xenophobic though. I agree that it was unhelpful and I certainly would not have made it myself.

&gt; The problem is that this goes both ways, kid. In my very Mediterranean country we have around 2 million British citizens living here on a permanent basis, many of them taking advantage of our better healthcare system and setting up business that accept pounds instead of euros therefore ensuring none of that wealth ends up benefiting the rest of the region.

I think you will know better than me whether or not the presence of Brits in Spain is good for Spain or bad for Spain. I expect you will probably agree with me that there are some good things about it and also some bad things. If Brits leave, then house prices will collapse further. I also understand that Britain has to pay Spain for the healthcare costs of Brits using the Spanish system. I also expect that those businesses in Spain that accept pounds do help the wider region too, as many people will transfer money. Presumably some of those businesses employ Spanish people, who then spend their earnings in Spain? And pay taxes in Spain?

And btw- Greece by far have the highest debt in all of Europe. No other country is even near Greece's debt/GDP ratio of 170 %. In fact, Greece lied and cheated its way in the Euro. Also,several countries knew that of course but it doesn't absolve Greece. So, no, it is not comparable to any other country. I am on my phone but you can google it. Also, austerity is the consequence of the current Euro and joining it. If you do not like it you should leave.(which is what I personally think would be the best, but that is beside the point, the Greek people should decide, or possibly the other Euro countries if they refuse to pay for Greece any more) But that is exactly what the Greeks have voted *against*, leaving the Euro. 

It seems to me you want to have the cake and eat it to. You want the Euro, but not the austerity. But at some point Greece have to start paying its bills. If you for decades vote for low taxes, early retirement, high pensions while not becoming more efficient- who is going to pay? Please tell me that. Who is going to pay the Greek states bills? 


Also, while I understand that things are horrendous, you are the minority view. If the Greek people had wanted things differently, why did the Greek vote for the people you did? 


If you want the changes you describe (tax the rich for example) it is perfectly legal to go through the parliament and get that legislation through. Since you do not I suppose the Greek do not want it. 

I mean, I can only begin to understand the frustration you feel (things are not good in Greece), but going from that to saying you need a revolution is not right.

true,yogavidya,earth,,"Mi permetto di intercalare un'opinione che condivido con parecchi buoni amici, tra cui alcuni insegnanti.

Nel corso della mia vita (50y) ho visto cambiare il modo in cui l'opinione pubblica, nel mio ex Paese, racconta e descrive il mondo della cultura e della formazione ed i valori associati.

Ho visto il rispetto pubblico per gli insegnanti e gli intellettuali diminuire vistosamente, in particolare dagli anni '80 in poi, assieme alla pratica ed all'apprezzamento della proprietà di linguaggio e del rigore (che non è rigidità) nel pensare. 

Ho visto questo nel parlare comune come nella televisione e nei giornali, e mi sono fatto l'idea che tre fattori concorrano a determinare questo sgradevole corso:

1) la termodinamica ;-) nel senso che, se non si coltiva attivamente - a livello pubblico e privato - la cultura, questa non cresce spontaneamente. Più facilmente crescono e si diffondono l'ignoranza, il sapere aneddotico ed il pensiero magico - espressioni culturali di entropia, appunto;

2) il contesto globale: dal crollo del Muro, è scomparsa la necessità, per le democrazie occidentali, di tenere sotto controllo i potentati economici - come dico spesso, il bisogno di poter dire ""ecco, qui da noi c'è libertà e benessere, e non è vero che le nostre società sono ingiuste"". Da allora ha preso a tirare un vento di laissez-faire che non mi porta certo a rimpiangere il socialismo reale, ma mi pare comunque un passo indietro rispetto al primo dopoguerra;

3) la storia specifica del nostro Paese, con le sue anomalie ed i suoi errori drammatici, che sfocia nel terribile periodo berlusconiano, in cui si manifesta una volontà precisa e consapevole di fare della scuola pubblica non il luogo in cui si sviluppano strumenti di pensiero e capacità critica, ma un servizio di formazione di esecutori.

Rileggendo, mi viene il dubbio che fosse meglio scrivere nulla che scrivere troppo poco. Se impreciso o poco chiaro mi perdonerete o volendo mi interrogherete, mettendo in crisi la mia timidezza da introverso; se sgradevole o inopportuno mi ignorerete o mi fanculizzerete.

true,essaloniki,GREE,Greece,"Wherever you say Greek people, just replace it with Greek Government.

In the last elections, the biggest party(ND) had... 29,66 % of the votes or 79  members. But the law says, the first party gets 50 members bonus so the 79 members becomes 129(!!). The second biggest party couldnt get +50 memers even if it had more votes than ND just because it was a mix of small ""parties"". In the end, ND collaborated with 2 other smaller parties just to get more than 150 members in order to be majority (the parliament has 300 members).
After some months the smallest party decided to leave and now there are just above 150 members. And it was said, just because some members of gd got in prison, they could be 148 and still the government will be legal.

If they can bend the rules so easily, how can we make them leave?

&gt;No other country is even near Greece's debt/GDP ratio of 170 %.

You are wrong. Luxembourg, Ireland, UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Monaco, Switzerland, Portugal, Austria,Sweden,France and Denmark's  debt/GDP is bigger than Greece's 174%.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_external_debt

&gt; Please tell me that.

Don't forget that we are talking about humans live here. You may seem to devaluate humans live so much.
I didn't say we shouldn't pay, but it should happen by a human standard. At least, make sure that no people will die cause of the hunger and just take away some of our ""luxuries"". I know its extremely ignorant and childish to demand a gently capitalism but i refuse to let people die because of some money. Do you accept/want it?

&gt; Also, while I understand that things are horrendous, you are the minority view. If the Greek people had wanted things differently, why did the Greek vote for the people you did?

1)As i told you, the biggest party was only 30%. So you cant say, the majority. 
2)In the past, ND and Pasok (the 2 biggest parties) made many wrong choices just to please people and vote them. People still remember that! (mostly old people voted ND/Pasok)
3)One another reason is because others parties are not so trusted

&gt; If you want the changes you describe (tax the rich for example) it is perfectly legal to go through the parliament and get that legislation through. Since you do not I suppose the Greek do not want it.

1. I didnt say that other parties aren't corrupted
2. Many times, riches people threatened to leave the country if government decides to tax them more.

If i may, they got us from the balls. That's why i want a more direct-democracy. I d prefer to have a direct-democracy and even fail from having a failed government which every year says, the year after we will leave recession.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; But then again Farange talks about white working class and not just working class and therefore you end up here trying to whitewash his words when you know there is just no way to do so. He's racist, he's a xenophobe and I find cute that you think none of his remarks are racist or xenophobic, but that's exactly what they are.

It sounds like you and I have different ideas of what the word ""racist"" means. I don't think you can conclude that the statement ""It [immigration] has left the white working class, effectively, as an underclass and that, I think, is a disaster."" is a racist statement. Surely for racism to have any meaning it must involve some kind of discrimination or disparagement based on race? This statement didn't do that. A mention of race itself is not racist. 

&gt; And that's exactly my point. Immigration in some aspects benefits the economy and in other aspects harms it, but the end result is always positive. Those immigrants Farange complains about pay taxes and strengthen the British economy. Salaries are now lower, sure, and in Spain those British business usually hire other expats rather than local people, but you can't have one thing without the other.

Well, it sounds like we are agreed. Personally I think that the UK (as a whole) benefits from relatively lax immigration laws. The UK can still have these laws once it leaves the EU. I think Spain has benefitted much less than Britain, partly because a generation of the most entrepreneurial and hardest working Spaniards have moved out of Spain.  

&gt; Also I find quite hilarious how they can afford to call themselves liberal while advocating national protectionism by kicking out immigrants.

If you look at the top graph on page 7, you can see how many PJ (Peta Joule) the various ""vedvarende energikilder"" (=sustainable energi soures) are based on. Wind power (=vindkraft) makes up less than a third of the sustainable energy, just shy of 40 PJ, which out of the total 801PJ  Denmark used in 2012, is more like 5% of the total energy, not even close to 25%.

Often you will hear here in Denmark we talk about wind power is about 20-25% of our energi, but it's about 20-25% of our *power* use, not total energy (so it's without heat). The main part of our sustainable energy comes from burning biomass, such as. Wood, wheat/straw, trash (both biodegradable and non-biodegradable), and import of sustainable energy (mainly hydro power from Norway when they have excess amount. When we import it hydro power, it looks like Denmark is more green, because in our numbers, our energy source is green, however we just sell our (meager) oil to other countries to burn when we can, which isn't exactly green.

We are despite this criticism getting better, the future numbers for win power will grow a good deal, a lot of wind farms are getting completed in 2013+.

tl;dr: In 2012 about 5% of Danish energy came from wind power. Denmarks total production of sustainable energy = about 20% of our energy consumption, we import the last 5-6%, but just sell the fossil fuels we don't need due to importing.

Edit: Would just like to point out the source is the governments own Energy Agentcy, and they put the total sustainable energy on 24-25%, not 26% as the graph does. Again, in 2012 numbers, 2013 (and 2014) would be better.",0,1396525388,null,0,false,0,cgiyi6g,t3_222p7o,t1_cgiyi6g,t1_cgitsql,null,1433190379,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

First point here is that the EU telco regulatory framework is premised on this idea of guaranteeing competition, for example, in most areas broadband access is still a 'bottleneck' (e.g. an oligopoly that stimulates monopoly pricing), and regulatory authorities can impose all types of obligations on big telcos to compensate for this (eg access for competitors to their network). Mergers are also subject to regulation and the European Commissions Competition Commissioner (Almunia) has been very strict on this and is highly critical about the benefits of further consolidation (there is little evidence).

Second point is that through the adopted provisions we're actually guaranteeing that providing broadband access remains extremely profitable (as it is now). In that sense content drives demand for more bandwidth, and through net neutrality we're allowing a free flow of data regardless of content or applications.

Then why support someone with an openly xenophobic discourse. Because even if you don't believe it, this is all about kicking out immigrants. Right now all EU citizens can move freely around all member states, but what happens when those citizens are without a job and need a social security net? Leaving the EU allows you to kick them out without (barely) any repercusions. Germany is trying to find a way to do so without rocking the boat, but you guys can do it openly once outside of the EU.

I understood the emphasis of what you said as above. But it's a chicken-egg conundrum:

1. We get all powers back from Brussels
2. We have Westminster MP's directly responsible for all the above powers.
3. We vote in changes to the democratic process in the UK with a strong opposition party forging this change via bottom-up representation of politics against vested interests that stop these improvements.
4. This direction is devolving local democracy; whereas the EU is centralizing a supranational undemocratic body that is taking powers every year. Once powers are returned then the debate can continue this direction first away from Brussels/Strasbourg then away from Westminster (Scotland is already ahead in this respect).
5. UKIP need to gain access to Westminster via the will of the people and their share of the vote growing to effect these changes: [PMQs: No proper 'recall' law for bent MP's (05Mar14)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swZyIyx1_ug)

true,mberre,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; The Germany economy is booming with such low unemployment because they have no universal minimum wage,

I'm not sure if this theorized causality can be proven. It seems to me that:

- According to financial economic studies, the booming German economy has more to do with capital flight from the rest of the eurozone than anything else. It is certainly empirically true that EZ sovereign risk spreads AND the DAX have been increasing since 2009. What that means in a practical sense is that investors and banks from the rest of the EU are bringing their money to Germany. 

- Comparing to other Northern EU countries, there certainly doesn't seem to be much causality. NL and BE have minimum wages, and also seem to be in decent shape economically. Finland on the other hand has the labor market system the same as Germany, but is't really doing any better than NL or Belgium at the moment. 

But overall, I'm with you that the idea of industry and region-specific minimum wage is probably a better policy. I wrote my thesis about the employment effect of the minimum wage in the US, and I found divergent employment effects in different industries. So, it might make sense for each industry to have their own minimum wage.  

On the other hand, it would suck i it lead to strikes and lockouts everytime the minimum wage came up for discussion.  ",0,1396526918,null,0,false,0,cgiytvr,t3_223atw,t1_cgiytvr,t1_cgiyl4c,null,1433190532,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; I'm afraid making a distintion between white and non-white working class, particularly when you claim you worry about the effects of widespread immigration on the first instead of on the working class as a whole, is racist. I'm sure many people thought ""separated but equal"" wasn't racist either since it didn't exactly discriminate another race.

As I have said, I don't think Farage's statement was a helpful one and it certainly isn't the kind of thing I would ever say. But I don't think it is the moral equivalent of ""separate but equal"". 

When judging whether or not Farage is a racist, I think it makes sense to judge the policies of UKIP as a whole and also Farage's statements and actions as a whole. From these, I think a conclusion that Farage is a racist is utterly wrong.

&gt; Because even if you don't believe it, this is all about kicking out immigrants. Right now all EU citizens can move freely around all member states, but what happens when those citizens are without a job and need a social security net? Leaving the EU allows you to kick them out without (barely) any repercusions. Germany is trying to find a way to do so without rocking the boat, but you guys can do it openly once outside of the EU.

I don't think this is all about kicking out immigrants. The UK has always had a long tradition of both emmigration and immigration well before the UK was a member of the EU. I have spent my entire life living along side immigrants (and second and third generation immigrants.) I don't see this ever changing. For me this is all about sovereignty.

The majority of EU immigrants to Britain come to work and don't need benefits. But, whose responsibility is an EU citizen on benefits? Certainly I would find it very embarrassing British people were moving to other EU countries and claiming benefits. It is Britain that should be responsible for British people on benefits rather than some other member state. I think the proposals Germany are making are sensible. Britain is currently the most generous of all EU countries as you can get benefits in Britain (if you are an EU citizen) even if you have never worked in Britain. 

&gt; Forwards to where? Britain for the Britons BNP style? And this is the problem with populism, you never know where this slippery slope is going to take you.

No, I think Britain's immigration policy should relate to Britain's needs. There should be no distinction based on nationality. Britain should welcome equally immigration from the whole world (rather than just Europe).",0,1396528286,null,0,false,0,cgiz612,t3_2221lc,t1_cgiz612,t1_cgiysce,null,1433190692,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I don't think it is a hollow threat. Everyone is taking it seriously. Everyone in Europe is watching the debate in the UK right now.

I agree it is a big trump card. But is it a card that the EU will play? And how will the UK respond if the EU does play this card? Better-off-outers like me need to be prepared for this card and be ready to respond to it.

I think that the EU might threaten it, but I would be surprised if they play it. We have already seen how the EU has played its cards with Russia after Russia annexed Crimea. We will see how the EU plays its cards against Switzerland after their referendum. We are watching the EU play its cards with the US in relation to free trade.

Which *you, the Greek people elected*. Honestly, I am going to stop having this conversation with you. It seems impossible to get you to admit that the Greek people elect, and have elected your politicians and governments for decades. No wonder that Greece is in bad shape, you refuse to take repsonsibility. 

If you prove that Greek is a dictaorship - post the links to it. If not, admit to the fact that *you elect your government*!!!!!!!!!! Why can't you admit to that? 


&gt;In the last elections, the biggest party(ND) had... 29,66 % of the votes or 79 members. But the law says, the first party gets 50 members bonus so the 79 members becomes 129(!!)

So, you have a minority government. Just like Sweden, Finland and Denmark at the moment, or why not Germany who has parties that make a coalition - like you have had to. That doesn't make you a dictatorship. You are still a democracy!!! Or are you saying that every single country with a minority government or coalition is a not a democracy? 

&gt;You are wrong. Luxembourg, Ireland, UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Monaco, Switzerland, Portugal, Austria,Sweden,France and Denmark's debt/GDP is bigger than Greece's 174%.

What are you talking about? I was talking about debt/GDP ratio, and Greece is by far the biggest. No pne is talking about your numbers. Also, if you recall, the rules for joinoing the Euro was 60 % **debt/GDP ratio**. Why are you talking about other numbers. So, when you joined the Euro, your debt was already higher and you lied about the numbers.

Please, look at this link[Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_debt) of Greece's public debt. Greece 155 %, Sweden 38 %, Switzerland 49 %. And, Sweden and Switzerland is not in the Euro, I don't even know why you are bringing up countries that have nothing to do with this. 

Furhtermore, you are talking about sovereign nations. No one cares about Sweden's debt, *since Sweden do not ask anyone else for money*. Same for all the other countries. The problem with Greece is that the Greece finances are so bad so that a whole lot of other countries have to pay for Greece, since Greece can't pay for themselves. Greece even have a primary deficit. So, all the Eurocountries, plus all countries that are in the IMF have to pay for Greece. Frankly, I don't care if Greece have a 3000 % debt/GDP ratio, if the Greece would pay for it, but they don't. That is why it is a concern. And, for your information, the number that Greece have is far, far to high and seen as unsustainable. 


&gt;Don't forget that we are talking about humans live here. You may seem to devaluate humans live so much. I didn't say we shouldn't pay, but it should happen by a human standard. At least, make sure that no people will die cause of the hunger and just take away some of our ""luxuries"". I know its extremely ignorant and childish to demand a gently capitalism but i refuse to let people die because of some money. Do you accept/want it?


What? I asked you to tell me why other people should pay for you. That is not an answer. And, poorer countries than Greece, are paying for you. Estonia, African countries, Asian countries. Who do you think the members of hte IMF are? So, please answer the question, why should the rest of the world pay for you since you do not want to make cuts`? 

Honestly, I do not want to keep this discussion with you. You refuse to accept that Greece is a democracy, and that you have chosen this situation ,and that you over and over again choose your government. Also, you refuse to accept that it was decades of democracy and mismanagement that brought you to where you are. 

If you want a serious discussion, please answer, but unless you actually accept that Greece is a democracy and take full responsibilty for the deciscions, I ask you not to answer. You seem to claim, that Greece is not a demcracy, but you have no proof. To me it seems like you are refusing to accept that the Greek people actually make really bad choices, which lead you to this situation .I think it is sad, you need to accept responsibility. 

Personally I think Greece should leave the Euro, but that should be a deciscion made by the Greeks and other Euro countries. If they (and the IMF) refuse to pay for you anymore, you could be forced to leave anyway.

Now you're just stalling. His statements are out there, I don't think they need further clarification. He said what he meant and I think everybody understood him just right.

&gt;The UK has always had a long tradition of both emmigration and immigration well before the UK was a member of the EU.

Sure, the question is now what you guys are going to do with the tens of thousands of Mediterranean and Eastern-Europe immigrants looking to find a future in the UK. When it comes to immigration, what's sovereignty good for? Well, sovereignty means you can say no and don't have a pesky EU telling you to play fair. And British people do enjoy benefits in other countries, that's one of the benefits of being a member of the EU, there is nothing wrong with that. You guys are paying for it. Take that away and I can tell you many British expats and business overseas are going to hurt.

&gt;Britain is currently the most generous of all EU countries as you can get benefits in Britain (if you are an EU citizen) even if you have never worked in Britain. 

Same thing in Spain, even if you're a non-EU illegal alien. It's called universal healthcare. So let's not get crazy here.

&gt;Britain should welcome equally immigration from the whole world (rather than just Europe).

This is a nice speech until you realise you don't mean you'll welcome non-EU citizens as EU citizens (free movement and right of residence), but EU citizens as non-EU citizens (VISAs and deportations).

Case and point, in Ireland the Supreme Court saw no problem in upholding a ban on homosexuality (more specifically homosexual acts), despite that being Z clear infringement of people's right to privacy. That only changed without the ECHR's ruling on the issue in Norris v. Ireland.

I think this point is worth debating, but I don't really think there is a wrong or a right answer. The ECHR isn't something I feel terribly strongly about and think of it very separately from the way I think about the EU anyway.

However, one point I would make out is that in the UK there is a very long tradition of protection of civil liberties (even though we have not traditionally used the expression ""rights"" to describe those liberties). Think of the Magna Carta, or Entick v Carrington. If the UK were to leave the ECHR, I expect that the UK would make some other arrangement.

Swedes complain that their military is weak and not capable of defense. I find that hard to understand (though then again, I am from Latvia, which has easily one of the weakest non-micronation militaries in Europe, and there we look at Sweden as our potential saviours). Sweden produces its own military equipment quite a lot, making a jet fighter is quite an achievement, Sweden builds some ships and submarines, builds IFVs, has MBTs. Instead of calling that weak, well, I could agree to just saying it's not capable of fighting Russia. But Russia is huge. To have a sufficient force to stand up to a Russian invasion, Sweden would probably need to quadruple the military size - it's difficult to have an army matching Russia's when Sweden has fewer people than Moscow.

So it seems like the Swedish military is actually quite capable, except against Russia. But Russia is the only serious threat to Sweden and to Europe in general. At the same time, Swedes generally oppose NATO, and I also do not understand where that comes from. NATO is far more military capable than Russia (and this is true even if you subtract the US), but the majority of Swedes oppose participation in an alliance that is stronger than Sweden's only external threat.

I think you are overplaying the significance of the expression ""white working class"". This isn't an expression dreampt up by Farage. This is an expression used for years by sociologists, journalists, psephologists, educationalists to describe a particular demographic. Nobody thinks that the use of this expression or a discussion of this demographic is, of itself, racist.

&gt; Sure, the question is now what you guys are going to do with the tens of thousands of Mediterranean and Eastern-Europe immigrants looking to find a future in the UK.

What does Britain already do with the tens of thousands of Africans, Asians and Americans looking for a future in the UK? The UK already has this dilemma, in or out of the EU. The debate about immigration is there whether or not we are in the EU. My own view is that the UK should not prefer Europeans to Africans.

&gt; Take that away and I can tell you many British expats and business overseas are going to hurt.

We will see! I think it will depend a lot on what their skills are and what their businesses are. I am someone who has been a British expat overseas.

&gt; Same thing in Spain, even if you're a non-EU illegal alien. It's called universal healthcare. So let's not get crazy here.

In Britain you also get unemployment benefit without having worked in the UK, a constant stream of money. I don't think Brits get that in Spain without having worked in Spain.

&gt; This is a nice speech until you realise you don't mean you'll welcome non-EU citizens as EU citizens (free movement and right of residence), but EU citizens as non-EU citizens (VISAs and deportations). 

I don't think we will require visas for most states. Already the UK does not require visas for many non-EU countries and we didn't require visas for much of Europe before joining the EU. I don't see a need for visas. I think deportations would only apply for those people who come to Britain illegally.

&gt; And talking about Britain's needs sounds awfully protectionistic for a liberal.

Every country in the world has limits on immigration. Every single one.  For that limit to be based on ""need"" strikes me as sensible.

However, I can answer a bit about NATO. Sweden have been neutral since forever (well, as long as anyone in Sweden have lived anyway), at least officially neutral, and frankly, it has worked. We have not been invaded. Might not be the whole truth, but still, there is a certain logic to that. Adding that NATO is seen as run by the US which wars have been extremely unpopular in Sweden (like most Europe) and the fact that we then have to join in all this NATO operation. What about Syria? Do we have to help Ukraine? What about X,Y,Z?  

So, with regards to NATO, Swedes prefer not to do military stuff abroad unless is peace keeping by the UN. We fear that it will not be the case with NATO, but we will be forced to join in loads of operation that we don't really want to join in, or have anything to do with. And, for a long time our neutrality has worked, and we have not been sufficiently scared by Russia to overcome our opposition towards NATO. We are still not sufficiently scared by Russia to join NATO, but scared enough to raise the military budget.

true,essaloniki,GREE,Greece,"&gt;If you prove that Greek is a dictaorship - post the links to it. If not, admit to the fact that you elect your government!!!!!!!!!! Why can't you admit to that?

First of all, did i say that we don't take responsibility for our mistakes in the past and present? No,i didn't. It's a fact.

I didn't say that we are in dictatorship but we have a model of democracy that is not working as **it should be**.
You probably say that we are on the right direction,i say that we aren't and we won't be *any soon*. Its a vicious circle.

&gt;What are you talking about? I was talking about debt/GDP ratio, and Greece is by far the biggest. No pne is talking about your numbers. Also, if you recall, the rules for joinoing the Euro was 60 % debt/GDP ratio. Why are you talking about other numbers. So, when you joined the Euro, your debt was already higher and you lied about the numbers.

I saw this [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_external_debt) about debr/gdp

&gt;What? I asked you to tell me why other people should pay for you. That is not an answer. And, poorer countries than Greece, are paying for you. Estonia, African countries, Asian countries. Who do you think the members of hte IMF are? So, please answer the question, why should the rest of the world pay for you since you do not want to make cuts`?

Do you believe that EU-world is paying us and doesn't gain anything? I hope not. Nothing in world economies happens because of generosity. So if, EU wouldn't gain anything they would let us default and let us alone. If i remember correctly papandreou wanted to do a referendum if we wanted eu to help us by lending money. But everyone tried to prevent it.
Also, i don't believe that Europe didn't know how bad our economy truly was. 

Even, IMF said that acted wrongly. Simply these mistakes costed some lives but they don't worth to them.

As i said in the beginning, i don't say that we were doing the right things all these years. Pretty much exactly the opposite. But believing that only our mistakes are the ones to blame for the crisis is **utterly** wrong. Crises are bound to happen.

I agree, you're going to do with those south and eastern European immigrants the same thing you'd do with the immigrants of African nations, and that frequenly means being forced to claim asylum in order to be able to immigrate legally. You're closing your borders, that's the reason you want sovereignty. Nothing wrong with that, mind you! But at least admit it.

Things have changed a lot since 2008, but in pre-crisis Spain immigrants (even illegal ones) had access to rent aids and several other subsidies, but that changed depending on the region you were on. And you know what? Those were humanitarian policies I felt quite proud of. Nowadays Spaniards are as screwed as immigrants, but thankfully we still recognise populism for what it is.

Of course, citizens from rich states are not a problem, but I'm talking about Greece, Romania or Spain. Oh, well, that's different, I'm sure.

It makes perfect sense to pay a minimum wage when unions are being eroded and businesses are failing to fulfil their social responsibilities to the societies that create the conditions for them to thrive and make and buy their products.

&gt; I agree, you're going to do with those south and eastern European immigrants the same thing you'd do with the immigrants of African nations, and that frequenly means being forced to claim asylum in order to be able to immigrate legally.

Why are Southern and Eastern European immigrants the UK's responsibility? Surely countries like Spain should be able to look after Spanish people? Really, why should they claim asylum unless there is genuine reason to claim asylum? Surely you don't think that the asylum system should be abused? 

&gt; Of course, citizens from rich states are not a problem, but I'm talking about Greece, Romania or Spain. Oh, well, that's different, I'm sure.

In this respect the UK would be like Spain (and every other country in the world). Spain currently requires visas from the nationals of some countries but not others. Every country does this. By all means criticise the UK for this, but be aware that you are criticising every country. Feel free to critcise the UK for having immigration controls.

true,durandaI,UNSA,Occasional lawful permanent resident,"&gt;Will we be able to live in France with a budget of $1000CAD (~$660euro) a month with or without working?

If you are traveling, then no. Say you spend 20 euro a day on accommodation (the cheapest hostels), you're already done right there. If you make all you own food, that's another 80 euro. Transportation will probably be at least 60 euro, more like 250 with a Eurail pass (€ 442 for 10 days of travel over 2 months). Museums and fun stuff will be another 100 euro. Drinking and going out is expensive, and if you do it more than once a week, that'll be another 120 euro. In this simple budget, I have you spending 1150 euro a month. You also will probably not be able to rent an apartment for a month either if you guys want to cut down on costs.

A reasonable monthly budget would read thusly for every member of your party:

| Lodging  | Travel    | Food    |  Museums &amp; Such | Eating out and parties| Total|
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:| :------------:| :------------:| :------------:|
| 750€| 250€         |    80 €  |100€ | 120€? | 1300€


Or, around 2000 CAD, or around twice what you thought.

It is pretty hard to find a short term contract job in France (by walking in and applying) as a foreigner. As someone just out of high school, with no contacts, I'll go ahead and say statistically improbable. This is excepting hostels and such which sometimes let you work for free lodging. Even so, that's pretty hard to do.

Again, I want to reiterate, with you're current budget, you could have a nice little holiday for a few weeks, but you'll want to up it to around 1300 euros a month if you are planning on staying in France.

For comparison, in 2007, as an American I needed 3,000 USD to Stay in Cadiz in the south of Spain for a month (language school with lodging, 500 euro, plus 200 euro towards drinking and eating the cheapest stuff we could find) plus travel around the rest of Europe (meticulously planned, with Eurail, Hostels, and everything preplanned) I spent the remaining 2000 USD over that next month. And I lived frugally, but unfortunately the traveling itself is the primary expense, and it is expensive. 

So save some more money.

Also this is distressing: 

&gt;Would it be optimal to learn any other language than English? (Of course, if we stayed in France we would learn French beforehand)

You can't learn French in 4 and a half months well enough to get a job here outside a hostel. That is a fact. 

&gt;Rumor has it many Europeans do not like Americans but like Canadians. As a Canadian should we were some sort of symbolism to identify ourselves as Canadian?

No. People like Americans just fine. Just try not to bring up Corsica too often. 

&gt;Where in Europe would you suggest staying if not for France? Must be able to work there

If you want to go somewhere cheaper than France, where you can still be employed, you're entering a conundrum, since the cheaper the place, the higher the unemployment, generally. That said, I think Spain is a wonderful country and is pretty cheap, in my experience.

HOWEVER, the great news today that the EP passed an amendment on the proposal (tabled by D66). This amendment removes this special treatment clause, resulting in adequate protection equivalent to that of the Dutch national NN laws. 

Don't take my wordd for it though. Check Bits of Freedom, Open Rights Group, EFF and all the other online rights groups. Everyone's celebrating!

Funny thing is, on Twitter, Kroes is still trying to take credit for her 'victory' as regards Net Neutrality. The truth is that it's been achieved despite her efforts, rather than thanks to them.

Ma come, dentro di me è chiarissimo ;-)

Scusami tu, intendevo dire che la scuola di cui ho esperienza era figlia di una cultura, quella dell'Italia di Peppone e don Camillo, che trovava un accordo sui principi - visti diversamente quanto si vuole - della solidarietà e della giustizia sociale.

Cose che oggi fanno quasi tenerezza. La scuola intesa come strumento di mobilità sociale era forse lo strumento piu' importante per implementare questi principi: tanto che cattolici e comunisti si contendevano il terreno della scuola e della formazione con alterne fortune. Ma quando il risultato del contendere era l'insegnamento del latino alle medie e piu' in generale un dibattito culturale di qualità, tirava un'aria diversa - e lo si percepiva dall'outcome a livello delle professioni, dell'informazione e della vita culturale.

Quest'assetto culturale e politico è morto quando il Muro è crollato: e non dico che non dovesse morire, dico solo che cio' che lo ha sostituito - finora - non mi piace tantissimo, per molti versi.

Most people didn't own anything in the Middle Ages. It was a much more unequal system than we have today. Furthermore you really can't use the term ""natural"" to describe subsistence.

And Southern and Eastern European immigrants living in the UK are UKs responsability because we live in an interconnected world.

British expats living in the rest of Europe are also a responsability of the respective European governments. Nobody is complaining about that, the deal benefits everybody.

And visas are stupid. I told you already: economy is global, capital has no borders. You want as much free trade agreements with as many countries as possible, and that includes immigration. People are going to migrate, defending open borders for the capital while closing them for the people is hypocresy and leads to an unstable diplomatic position.

Again rural feudalism was unequal but city people actually less than today - because instead of one man owning one factory it wa fifty competing workshops.

A small, one-classroom school. Although being an intellectual is precisely that kind of vocation that does not require any physical capital.

&gt;These weren't very good for anyone who wasn't member.

Everybody had a chance after being a journeyman, and it benefitted customers, because while today there is only competition between corporations, in the guild there was competition in the guild as well, not just between. Their major job was setting price floors that ensured that competition happens in quality, not price, so no corners are cut.

&gt;Guilds were used to consolidate power and create monopolies in order to control prices. 

Every system had monopolies, including trust capitalism and state socialism. So monopolies are really a phase every system goes through. Today, instead of having  50 shoes stores in 5 corporate chains, each having the same price and quality inside the chain, you could have 50 stores in 5 guilds, where the price is similarly fixed inside the guild, but the guilds compete in prices.

Se guardi la discussione non sono io quello che ha dissotterrato l' ascia di guerra - ne stavolta, ne quelle prima. Gli insulti arrivano dopo, sempre a causa della mancanza di argomenti. E dopo quelli la sdrammatizzazione, così prima vengo insultato e poi devo sentirmi dire che sono quello che non la mette sul ridere quando chi insulta sdrammatizza per stemperare. Se guardi la storia dei miei commenti (e di chi non parla col coro, non sono l' unico) va sempre così.

La mia sensazione è che ci sia del dolo, e chi pilota la ""discussione"" così sa molto bene quello che fa. Ma ripeto, non è che abbia tutto questo interesse a stanare gli influencer, *io* non vengo pagato per questo.

Ripeto, tutto questo arriva *dopo* gli insulti e le ""sdrammatizzazioni"". I downvotes mi preoccupano non per la discussione in sè ma perchè indicano che 

a) chi legge e vota qua non sa cos'è la retorica e (ammesso e non concesso che chi sia qua rappresenti la popolazione italica) di conseguenza è drammaticamente manipolabile a piacere (I weep for my people) oppure 

b) qualcuno tramite un voting ring indirizza le discussioni

Yes, those are the EU targets and for Germany it's 18% of *gross final energy consumption* by 2020. And with the 12.4% Germany is well on track.

The target is defined as:
&gt; Renewable energy sources cover solar thermal and photovoltaic energy, hydro (including tide, wave and ocean energy), wind, geothermal energy and biomass (including biological waste and liquid biofuels). The contribution of renewable energy from heat pumps is also covered for the Member States for which this information was available. The renewable energy delivered to final consumers (industry, transport, households, services including public services, agriculture, forestry and fisheries) is the numerator of the Europe 2020 target. The denominator, the gross final energy consumption of all energy sources, covers total energy delivered for energy purposes to final consumers as well as the transmission and distribution losses for electricity and heat.

.


&gt; The current target for 2020 ist 35% they adapted it, after it was so succesfull.

Yes. That target is 35% share of *gross electricity consumption*, not to be confused with gross electricity production nor with gross energy consumption (not saying you did, but just to clarify to a casual reader).

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; I had no idea things were that bad in the UK, you honestly see nothing wrong with making a distintion between white working class and non-white working class? Really?

I'm going to assume that you didn't click on the links I sent you earlier. One of the reasons why politicians and policy makers and sociologists sometimes need to talk about race is because often different races seem to be in different situations. For example, if black people are over-represented in prison, then it is right for policy makers to think about this and talk about it. Or if white working class males are underachieving at school, equally it makes sense for policy makers to talk about it. Or if people vote differently depending on their race then this is a subject journalists can discuss. 

Personally I don't think that the white working class in Britain are affected by immigration in a different way from the black working class in Britain, but I don't know. Given that in relation to prison and educational attainment race does seem to be a factor, it does not strike me as inconceivable that race might also be a factor when it comes to immigration. Certainly to raise the discussion is not of itself racist.

&gt; And Southern and Eastern European immigrants living in the UK are UKs responsability because we live in an interconnected world. 

Here I was talking about those Sourthern and Eastern Europeans who hadn't yet moved to Britain but were planning to move. These are the people that would be impacted.

I agree we live in an interconnected world, but the UK is very much part of that interconnected world. The big driver for the UK to leave the EU is for the UK to be able to connect more directly with the rest of the world.

&gt; And visas are stupid. I told you already: economy is global, capital has no borders. You want as much free trade agreements with as many countries as possible, and that includes immigration. People are going to migrate, defending open borders for the capital while closing them for the people is hypocresy and leads to an unstable diplomatic position.

I see what you are saying, that there should be no borders or visa restrictions anywhere. But that is really a very minority position and not the position of any EU country. There is currently no country in the world that has this position and certainly not Spain. I don't think you should single out the UK here for having immigration controls. Every country has these.

In fact, that is likely still the deterrent. In the first couple weeks of Crimea Russia spent $16 billion of its dollar reserves defending the Ruble (I'm sure its considerably higher now). The Russian ex-Finance Minister, and Putin ally, estimated if US/EU sanctions are fully implemented 20% of Russia's economy worth of foreign capital will leave the country per year. 

The US also released a small fraction of its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (5 million bbls) to ~~remind Russia it is sitting on 700 million bbls of oil~~ test the distribution capabilities of a new pipeline system. Russia needs the price at $120/bbl for a balanced budget, its far less than that currently, and oil analysts estimate the US could depress the price by 12-15% for a prolonged period of time.

You are wrong, since the EU has a common system for people applying for asylum. 

&gt;I mean, you have gone back to the 1980 to take the number for the US (the 3 million figure I don't see it) and you compare it with the ones living in Europe right now.


A person doesn't lose refugee status, so the total admitted since 1980 (which is 2,671,511) are all still considered refugees. Thus, the 3 million seems reasonable, since it would also include refugees coming into the U.S. before 1980, and still living. The 1.5 million figure is the number currently living (i.e., people who are alive with the status of refugee, not asylum seeker) in the EU, Norway, and Switzerland. I'm unsure where you got confused. 

[Take a look at this page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_in_the_European_Union), for an example of current rates of acceptance. The EU in 2012 actually accepted about twice as the U.S. (110k to 58k). 

It might be of interest to you that your country, Spain, only accepted 565 people as refugees last year, which is less than Malta, a country with a population of around 450,000 people.

The discrepancy comes from terminology. A person who flees their country for reasons of war or persecution is always a refugee.
However, legally they are divided into two camps: asylum seekers and those granted refugee status. The EU has a lot more asylum seekers (who are granted temporary permission to remain in country until their case is resolved) than they accept as refugees (people allowed to stay permanently in the host country). My numbers from the U.S. refer to asylum seekers granted asylum and allowed to stay in the U.S. as refugees. The same goes for the European numbers.

Thus you get the large discrepancies, since Germany, for example, gets a lot of asylum seekers (according to you, 130 000 in 2013), but does not actually accept that many. 22,165 were accepted in 2012, for example. And that number is from Eurostat. So around 10% of asylum seekers in Germany are granted asylum and recognized as refugees legally. The rest are put through a process of deportation. The problem with getting solid numbers is that some sources site all 130,000 asylum seekers as refugees, and some don't. It gets confusing quickly, since the person in question, be they an asylum seeker or someone granted asylum, are both called refugees. Throughout my original post, I use the term refugee to mean someone granted asylum. Christ, this shit is linguistically confusing. Thanks English.

I am familiar with Sweden doing that. [Sweden, actually, is the country in the EU that accepts the second most refugees per capita \(behind Malta\).

(“Catalonia’s very real grievances,” by Geoff Cowling(British Consul in Catalonia 2002-2005), Financial Times, 26 February 2014)

“The article by Cayetana Alvarez de Toledo, ”Europe cannot afford to give into the separatists” deserves comment. It is wrong to describe the Scottish independence referendum as “a grave challenge from regional separatists.” Scotland is not a region. It is a nation in its own right within the United Kingdom. The Scottish and English parliaments were joined in an Act of Union in 1707. It is the democratic right of the people of the Scottish nation to vote for the repeal of that act if they so wish. Catalonia too is a nation as defined by the Estatut, an act passed by the Spanish parliament in 2006. To describe both nations as tribes betrays a colonialist mind. The UN is quite clear on the rights of nations: “All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.” For the European Union to “confront separatism” to “unmask the hypocrisy of nationalism” and “play the legal card of the EU treaties” against Scotland and Catalonia would be to tread on very controversial ground. The article accuses the Catalan government of distorting historical facts in this 300th anniversary year of the fall of Catalonia at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession. It is worth recalling that Catalonia was effectively an independent nation until 1714. During that war, Catalonia was allied with England under the Treaty of Genoa of 1705 and fought for the Habsburg cause against the Bourbon Spain. When the British government withdrew its support for the Habsburgs and signed the treaty of Utrecht in 1713, Catalonia fought on alone. It took a one-year siege by a combined French and Spanish Bourbon army to break Barcelon‘s defences which fell on 11 September 1714. Thousands of defending Catalans were killed in the siege and in the retribution which followed. Catalonia‘s ancient parliament, its identity, language and culture were crushed. Large parts of Barcelona were razed to the ground. Catalonia did not voluntarily join Spain, it was brutally conquered. Catalonia was treated little differently during the Spanish Civil War when Barcelona was bombed by Franco‘s rebel air force, killing 1,300. Catalonia‘s elected President Lluis Companys was forced to flee into France. He was extradited and shot by Franco in 1940 at Montjuic Castle overlooking Barcelona. Lluis Companys remains the only incumbent president in Europe ever to have been executed. No apology or posthumous pardon has been given. Catalonia remembers these historical facts -they are not “imaginary historical grievances.” On its National Day (La Diada) on 11 September 2012, one and a half million Catalans filled Barcelona‘s streets waving the Catalan Senyera flag and calling for independence. On La Diada last year they formed a 250-mile independence human chain from the French border to Valencia. The independence movement is deeply rooted in Catalan society, fuelled by every rebuff from Madrid. Like Scotland‘s, Catalonia‘s parliament has a majority in favour of an independence referendum. The Westminster parliament has given Scotland the right to decide its future. In contrast, the Spanish parliament in Madrid refuses to debate Catalonia‘s request. Democracy is not feared in the UK -it is embraced. Democracy should not be feared in Spain either.”

En attendant le retour de documentaires sur un sujet qui m'intéresse vraiment, je regarde des flims ou des séries;
* Je me suis fini les 3 premières saisons de Dexter, c'est une bonne série mais qui commence déjà à se répéter au bout de 3 saisons. Je me demande à quoi ressemblent les autres.
* J'ai également regardé [The Outsiders](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086066/), un film très gai sur deux gamins qui appartiennent à un gang et à qui il arrive plein de choses sympathiques. Je n'ai pas vu le temps passer mais je trouve qu'il est assez peu agréable à regarder, mais même si je n'ai pas particulièrement apprécié l'ambiance, il vaut tout de même le coup d'être visionné, je ne saurais pas dire pourquoi (mystère, mystère...).
* J'ai été fasciné par le clip de [The Heart of No](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wWGvSrNu9Y&amp;list=LLNkzR43cJLlDP7MjI6hjB4g&amp;index=3) du groupe  Z▲Z▲Z◎Z◎.

One thing that might be legitimate is averaging exchange rates over time, or even combining such averaged rates with somehow averaged and combined forward rates of different maturities.

To further my argument with examples,  if I wanted to buy a car, computer or other product traded internationally then I would be using my nominal income.

The problem with PPP in my opinion is that it makes countries where shoddy goods or cheap but unhealthy products may be sold look better off, when it might even be evident from a careful look at the country that the people aren't.

A final example might be a McMansion. It may have a large floor area, but not actually be very nice quality-wise, whereas the typical Swedish house built until perhaps 2000 was built with far greater quality. Even so, now-days the same pressures affect us and I have seen rather terrible destruction wrecked by new styles, because over time these houses will not retain much appeal and the quick methods of construction using large amounts of gravel and the use of levelling instead of building to the contours of the ground takes space away from other things, to a degree that makes me doubtful that it is even economical in the long run, considering future generations and not just the actual externalities of the effect on the landscape.",0,1396544127,null,0,1396552031,0,cgj5o6q,t3_2213iw,t1_cgj5o6q,t1_cgijslh,null,1433193826,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Concrètement, les décideurs n'agissent plus en fonction de l'intérêt général, mais en fonction des répercussions médiatiques de leurs actions : c'est le ""politiquement correct"" et le règne des diversions, avec la diffusion de ""dérapages"" pour ceux qui sortiraient des lignes autorisées.

But there's many ways to look at it and in reality both Germany and France are well on track to meet their GHG targets.

From [the progress report](http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/g-gas/docs/com_2013_698_en.pdf):
&gt; According to the GHG inventory data from 2011, eight EU-15 Member States (Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom) are likely to achieve their individual GHG reduction targets through domestic emission reductions only, as shown in Figure 6. Ireland and Portugal are expected to achieve their targets with the use of carbon sinks. Austria, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Spain could meet their target by using Kyoto flexible mechanisms. Taking into account the use of Kyoto credits as it is currently planned, Luxembourg is not yet on track to achieve its target (by a 1.7 % gap) and for Italy, the present shortfall is small (by 0.7 %) (see Figure 6). Both shortfalls can be addressed during the true-up period.
&gt;  
In most of the thirteen Member States which acceded to the Union as from 2004, emissions are reported to have slightly increased between 2009 and 2012. However, based on the data currently available, all these eleven Member States that have a Kyoto target are expected to meet or over-achieve their commitments. It is estimated that for the 1st commitment period these Member States overachieved their Kyoto targets by a total of 2.4 Gt CO2 excluding LULUCF and emission reduction credits. The  remaining two Member States, Cyprus and Malta, have no obligations under the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period.

2010	73,293
2011	56,384
2012	58,179


Total: 262,458

Over the last four years Europe granted 1,797,600 people asylum? The thing is, Europe only gives asylum to 15% or so of people seeking it. That put the number expected to receive asylum (the number comparable to the U.S. number) at around 269,640 people. And that's only if the 1,797,600 is from the last four years only. The 2.6 million comes from people granted asylum, in the U.S., since 1980, if we assume they are alive. That's the the total number of people given asylum since that date.

The elephant in the room is that Spanish is one of the biggest languages by a long shot, and way more cultural material is produced in Spanish than in Catalan. And almost everything that is produced in other languages is translated to Spanish and not to Catalan. 

Beside that, the Catalan-speaking regions have been way more prosperous that the rest of Spain except Valencia lately. Therefore,  we have been getting a lot of immigration from the rest of Spain. And the Spanish governments specially the dictatorship saw this immigration waves as a tool to culturally assimilate us.

And since we got self-government. Catalonia has had strong policies to assimilate the immigration and to integrate them in the Catalan culture. Not so much in Valencia and Balearic Islands in a middle term.

Fast-forward Catalan is a minority language actually in most of my region and Balearic Islands. The spokeman of the CUP(pro-independence party) David Fernàndez is a 2nd generation *immigrant*.

You're comparing the number of asylum seekers that have been admitted to the US for the past 34 years to the number of people seeking asylum in Europe *right now*. Hardly a fair comparison. 

And the acceptance rate in the US is probably higher because you don't border any conflict zones or developing nations. The ones that make it there have for the most part probably already been admitted in refugee camps abroad and then resettled. 

And the [Mexican border](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_deaths_along_the_Mexico%E2%80%93United_States_border#Incidents_of_Border_Patrol_use_of_force) is still more heavily guarded than any European border. People coming from Mexico are not allowed into the US as refugees. In Europe, *anyone* can ask for refugee status and it will be granted. The ones that are bullshit (most of them) will in some cases not be given asylum.

Inoltre copertura 3g traballante a dir poco. Appena tolgono la mia opzione da 6 euro mensili (lo faranno di sicuro) cambierò gestore pure io.

Tim ha dei prezzi folli, che non stanno né in cielo né in terra. La copertura è generalmente buona, ma le offerte sono oscene da un paio di anni a questa parte. Ogni tanto impazziscono e tirano fuori qualche offerta decente, ma non appena se ne accorgono rimediano subito.

Vodafone fa un'offerta buona all'anno, se la prendi bene se no aspetta il prossimo giro, altrimenti lascia perdere.

3 fa delle offerte che sembrano molto convenienti dalla pubblicità, ma la sola è sempre dietro l'angolo (le soglie divise settimanalmente e spacciate come mensili ad esempio). Inoltre se se in una zona non cittadina il rischio di andare in roaming e pagare esiste, come esiste anche per gli operatori minori, Noverca, Postemobile etc.

Cosa fare: vai in ogni negozio dei singoli operatori chiedendo di voler effettuare un passaggio con un'offerta, generalmente sono più convenienti con un passaggio. Non fare contratti con pagamenti mensili, solo ricaricabili a meno che non vuoi un telefono nuovo. Scegli la più conveniente. Appena tolgono forzatamente l'opzione passa ad un altro operatore.

&gt;The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates there are approximately 15.4 million refugees in the world. **The UNHCR reports that less than 1 percent of all refugees are eventually resettled in third countries. Of these, the United States welcomes over half, more than all other resettlement countries combined. More than 3 million refugees have come to the United States in the last 35 years, according to the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.** The United States is also the single-largest donor to international relief efforts for refugees.

And for European Statistics, [here](http://www.ecre.org/refugees/refugees/refugees-in-the-eu.html):

&gt;**There are approximately 1.5 million recognised refugees living in the twenty seven Member States of the European Union plus Norway and Switzerland**...All the EU Member States make a distinction between asylum seekers and refugees. **An asylum seeker is a person submitting a request for refugee status. The asylum seeker is not granted refugee status unless the Member State decides they qualify, following a defined legal procedure**.

Asylum seekers are, in general, accepted at a low rate in the EU (Sweden not withstanding).

I did come across the drop in people granted asylum in the 2000's, which was due to the War on Terror and the attacks of September 11th. Historically, it's typically a lot closer to what it is currently, and occasionally higher (see the early 90's, for example). 

The complications from the UNHCR comes from the large numbers of asylum seekers in Europe who are currently there. However, it is more than likely that most of these people will not be granted asylum and have to leave, if the current rate of 15% stands. Sweden, of course, has been a great country for refugees, and deserves credit. I was not trying to single any one country out, just curious about the reasons.

&gt;In Europe, anyone can ask for refugee status and it will be granted

One discourse goes in English - the content follows along following lines: 

- We are nice, tolerant people, who have been subjugated by Soviets... now evil Putin is trying to conquer us once again. We treat our minorities as good as possible, so Putin has no reason to say anything bad.. he is just crazy. Help us!!!

Discourse in Russian:

- Fuck... We are Latvian citizens, we do not plan (have nowhere) to migrate to Russia (btw who would want to?). As a side note, we are often of mixed families, our ancestors are from all parts of USSR/Czarist Russia: Ukrainians, Belorussians, Poles etc. Another side note there have been Russians in Latvia before independence of 1918... Old Believers tribes and such. Latvian state now is hell bend on eliminating right on education in Russian language... We do not mind having 50% of classes in Latvian... we want our children to be integrated after all, but there is gradual push to reduce % of classes in minorities' languages to 20% at most. Basically in the sense of ""ethical-linguistic self-preservation"" Russians and the rest of minorities are in the worst position than Latvians were in USSR times. 

Latvian discourse:

- Russians are these stupid bunch, that cannot learn our language, they are plain disrespectful, we have no business to respect minorities rights *a la* Western Europe style... we have been occupied after all. So now we gone eradicate sounds of occupants languages as soon as we can. If these pesky Russkies have anything to say aginst forceful assimilation... our first reaction is: fuck off to your beloved Russia (we cannot be bothered to see that many ""occupants"" are from mixed families, some have been living in the country for generations etc.). When something bad happens in the country - it is subversive work of KGB or local Russies.  

Sadly, that is how I see that: separate communities. They have enough of self-control to avoid face-to-face confrontation, but behind closed doors, all suppressed bigotry goes berserk... At least half of the national politics is about solving all kind of ""national"" questions and not about managing the country.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"Well, here's to successful market liberalization then! If done right you'll have more choises with competitive pricing from multiple power companies.

Over here it was done in the 90s and I'm pretty happy with the results. You can easily get competing bids for electricity from the numerous power companies. They call you from time to time with cheaper deals, or you can use [web services](http://www.sahkonhinta.fi/search) to compare the latest prices.

And you can choose exclusively renewable sources or even all nuke. According to that website currently the cheapest deal for me would be 100% renewables electricity at 4.49 cent/kWh from power company 220 Energia. 

The deals vary according to your usage patterns and pricing scheme. Often using pricing binded to the [Nord Pool Spot](http://www.nordpoolspot.com/) power market gives you very competitive prices. For example Vattenfall Spot pricing history for home contract:

                     2012   2013 
        Average:     4,17   5,34  cent/kWh
        Max monthly: 6,75   6,17
        Min monthly: 1,93   4,67 
    (=Spot + 0,25 cent;  not incl. tax 24% and transfer)

You also have to pay the 24% tax, and the transfer to the utility running the power infrastructure. Unfortunately you really cannot have competing bids on that as the utility has an effective monopoly in your area. The transfer prices vary according to where you live roughly between 6-10 cent/kWh. With all expencens combined electricity in Finland is about 16-18 cent/kWh on average, but YMMV depending on deal, consumption pattern, area, etc.",0,1396550097,null,0,false,0,cgj8m27,t3_222p7o,t1_cgj8m27,t1_cgj574v,null,1433195209,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Of these people, there are 1.63 million in the Europe and 0.28 in the US. The vast majority of the people who seek asylum do so because they want to live in a richer country, not because they fear for their safety. In other words. They don't have a legitimate claim to asylum. Those have to be sorted out and sent away. 

The net admittance is still higher in Europe. Both per capita and in total. I linked directly to the OECD. That's a reliable source, right? The OECD. You just need to download the spreadsheet and look. 

1980:

USA: **26 512**

#Germany: **107 818**

1990: 

USA: **73 637**

#Germany:  **193 063**

2000:

USA: **40 867** 

#Germany: **78 564**

These were the people who received permanent residence. Not just temporary asylum. Keep in mind that Germany has around one quarter of the US's population and that it is only one of the 56 countries in Europe.

I do not think the Russian population should just be told to deal with it or fuck off. Maybe the Russian population could do a better job integrating and learning the culture.

So what can be done? It looks like the two groups just dislike each other so much that all of the nation's energy is spent dealing with this problem, and not the other problems ailing Latvia. It seems like this is a country that could be torn in two, so how does a country go about a)Preventing these different groups from splitting entirely, ripping the country in half or b)Dealing with the fallout from such a split.

Since obviously the majority of the populace are Pro-Russia, everybody zoomed in on the Tartars who are blatently anti-Russian and not afraid to say it. These guys have been struggling since the end of the USSR with land rights, housing, education and building mosques. They face opposition from Russians and Ukrainians who have taken property or land they used to live in obviously never liked it. The Ukrainian government has barely done anything to help. Not Yanukovich, Not Tymoshenko, Not Yukaschenko. The EU or the US hasn't championed their cause either until now. 

It's just a hollow political move to use them as a tool to bash Russia with, without doing anything to really help them. Just like Russia using ""protecting Russians from fascists"" as an excuse to annex Crimea. 

When it comes to the referrendum they choose to boycott to siginal their opposition to it. It didn't matter anyway since they are a minority and their votes would have changed nothing. The promise that was broke was the one with the qouta. Their reasoning is that Russian law doesn't allow ethnic minority quotas which is true. Crimea isn't an autonomous republic anymore, it's an province and a city which means they don't have their own special rules.

Personally I don't think they have much to worry about. Russia has changed since the '90s especially under Putin when it comes to treatments of ethnic minorities. The country is full of ethnic minorities especially Muslims and the government has no desire to go through another Chechnya. They will find a way to please them just like the Volga Tartars, Chechens, Ossetians and etc. Tartarstan is the the posterboy for Russia's treatment of Muslims and Putin has already sent representatives to talk to the Crimean tartars.

The fact that several hundred thousand of them have not been bothered to pass the citizenship test by learning a few phrases of Latvian, some history, the hymn, and swearing loyalty to the country - that says a lot. Twenty years! You can learn those things quickly, if you wanted to, get the citizenship, and forget about it.

It's not at all confusing when keeping in mind what numbers are being dicussed.

The map is the % share of renewables of *gross final energy consumption*. That is the number of interest because that's the one to keep track of the EU 20-20-20 targets for different countries (38% for Finland).

It is to be expected that the number differs from say electricity consumption, electricity production or energy production. And it would be quite amazing if they didn't differ because those are all different measures.

Here's the definition for the number in the map:
&gt; Renewable energy sources cover solar thermal and photovoltaic energy, hydro (including tide, wave and ocean energy), wind, geothermal energy and biomass (including biological waste and liquid biofuels). The contribution of renewable energy from heat pumps is also covered for the Member States for which this information was available. The renewable energy delivered to final consumers (industry, transport, households, services including public services, agriculture, forestry and fisheries) is the numerator of the Europe 2020 target.

true,CreepyOctopus,LATV,Latvia | Sweden,"The situation is not as bad as some present it. But yes, I would say Latvia has a distinctly split society. There's the Latvian part, and the Russian part, where the Russian part includes not just ethnic Russians but also a large amount of Ukrainians/Belarusians/Jews living in the country. The split is a social one, not geographic or otherwise. Basically, we have different schools, different newspapers, different TV channels, different entertainment. This may be contributing more to unease in society than purely geographic aspects such as certain areas of cities being dominated by one group. They don't even celebrate Christmas on the same date.

It's a big difference when Latvians read Diena, get news from TV3 and Nekā Personīga and watch Smalkais Stils, while Russians read Chas, get news from TV5 and Bez Cenzury and watch Margosha. In the end, it's quite possible for these two groups in society not only to end up with very different perspectives on the same events (happens all the time), but actually to be aware of completely different events in the first place.

Integration is getting better, in my opinion, if for no other reason than the mere passage of time. The current generation of 20-year old Russians has grown up hearing a fair bit of Latvian. The old diehard Soviets are dying out. Frankly, the old generations would have never been possible to integrate. It's an uncommon situation in the world. Some of those people were born in Soviet Latvia, lived there for 40-50 years, were happy with it, and one day found themselves in an independent Latvia. Which is a stark change, Soviet Latvia was essentially a region of Russia, and Latvia later moved quickly in a completely different direction.

I even get how they might want to reconnect with their heritage and maybe have a traditional Jewish meal once in a while. But why are they trying to out-Jew the many secular Jews? It's as if they aren't capable of being their own person, like a vessel that takes in any identity you pour into it.

Angenommen, du hast vor jemanden zu töten. Typisch für nen Uni Fall wäre: deinen Nebenbuhler z.b.

Jetzt hast du irgendwo gelesen, dass du ab ner gewissen Promillezahl (fängt irgendwo jenseits der 3 Promillegrenze an, hängt aber vom Einzelfall ab) nicht schuldfähig bist.  

Also besäufst du dich hemmungslos, mit dem Plan dich in diesen Zustand zu versetzen und so deine ursprüngliche Absicht straflos in die Tat umzusetzen. 

Angenommen, du warst tatsächlich so willenlos besoffen, dass du bei der Tötung entweder Recht von Unrecht überhaupt nicht mehr trennen konntest, oder deine Steuerungsfähigkeit dermaßen eingeschränkt war, dass du jedenfalls dein Handeln überhaupt nicht mehr unter Kontrolle hattest. 

Was die Rechtsprechung dann macht, ist quasi deinen Vorsatz als du noch nüchtern warst zu nehmen, deine Schuldunfähigkeit bei der eigentlichen Tatbegehung zu ignorieren und deinen ursprünglichen Vorsatz auf diesen Zeitpunkt zu verlagern/zu fingieren. Der ursprüngliche Vorsatz müsste dir natürlich nachgewiesen werden.

Voilà: wir haben einen vorsätzlichen schuldhaften Mord, obwohl du naturwissenschaftlich bei der eigentlichen Tatbegehung gar nicht mehr zu Vorsatz bzw. Schuld fähig warst. 

Sorry, kürzer kann ich es nicht erklären ;)  Der Wikipedia Artikel zu dem Stichwort enthält noch andere Konstruktionen, die vertreten werden um das gleiche Ergebnis zu erreichen (du machst dich selbst zu deinem eigenen Werkzeug etc.) und auch die (mE sehr angebrachte) Kritik an diesen Konstruktionen. 

Wo steht das im Gesetz? Nirgends.. 

Tl;dr : wenn du bei der Tat nicht mehr zu Schuld fähig bist, nehmen wir eben deine Schuld als du noch nüchtern/wohl genährt warst.

I haven't read the Russian Delfi and TVnet comments much, because there is only so much time and patience in the world, but from what I've seen of them they are often very hateful and revanchist. Glorify the USSR, say that Latvia isn't their homeland, but rather the Latvian SSR, that they feel no need to speak the ""dog language"" of the ""barbarians"" and other trash. And the thing is, that there is much more unanimous agreement on the Russian comments (upvotes/downvotes), whereas on the Latvian comment sections, the controversial comments are more, well, controversial.

About France and its cultural/linguistic intolerance - I could (and would) say that Latvia has more reason to be culturally/linguistically ""intolerant"" than France, since French is spoken in several different countries around the globe and there is no possibility of it dying out for a long time to come.

Latvia, on the other hand, is the only homeland of Latvian speakers, who number around 2.5 million people in the whole world. Every red cent should be put towards strengthening the cultural identity of Latvians (ethnic Russians, Latvians, and everyone else).

Now, that doesn't mean no national funds should be used to support and develop the culture of Russian-speaking Latvians. I would be happy to give money to, for example, Russian-speaking Latvians who create and/or perform folk songs about Latvia. But as far as I can tell, there aren't many (or any) musicians like that. I would be happy to put money into free Latvian and Russian-language courses, for both ""sides"".

I don't and won't support, however, financing state schools where the language of instruction is in Russian, where subjects like history(!) are taught from Russian textbooks. Just recently, the Language Centre found that history textbooks had been sent out and provided to Russian schools that denied the occupation. What the fuck is that?

Without prior knowledge of a person, a practiced cold reader can still quickly obtain a great deal of information about the subject by analyzing the person's [body language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_language), [age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing), [clothing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing) or [fashion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion), [hairstyle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle), [gender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender), [sexual orientation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation), [religion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion), [race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(classification_of_human_beings\)) or [ethnicity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity), level of [education](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education), manner of [speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_communication), place of origin, etc. Cold readers commonly employ high probability guesses about the subject, quickly picking up on signals from their subjects as to whether their guesses are in the right direction or not, and then emphasizing and reinforcing any chance connections the subjects acknowledge while quickly moving on from missed guesses.

true,CreepyOctopus,LATV,Latvia | Sweden,"Right, there's the difference between assimilation and integration. I am not at all a nationalist, I don't like our nationalist politicians, and don't agree with their goal of assimilation. So I am fine with Russians who identify as Russians. No problem by me. My desire is merely that they would be well integrated, which means able to speak Latvian well, respectful of and somewhat knowledgeable about Latvian culture, and definitely that they should not think it's land that belongs to Russia.

That integration is probably achievable, but it's not that easy so far. One problem is that too many politics are expressed in terms of Latvians vs. Russians. Like the latest municipal elections in Riga were essentially like the Russian party vs. the Latvian parties. Parliamentary elections also have that feeling. Another problem is the lack of something to truly unite the country. It's not like the different ethnic groups hate one another, it's not a situation similar to Serbs vs Croats, there is no violence or anything like that. But there's also nothing really that unites everyone.
