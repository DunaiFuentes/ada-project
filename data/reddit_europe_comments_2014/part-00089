The nature of federalism means individual and state disputes (going to simplify this into these 2 layers right now) have seperate decision making processes.

A dispute between two individuals is done on a state level, and so the individuals have to view the state mechanism as fair.

A dispute between two states will be done on a federal level, so the states have to view the federa; mechanism as fair.

This layer system of conflict negotiation means that each unit only has to give direct consent to govern to the unit above. The breaking of this seperation flaws the federal model.

In short the theories on EU governance consisting of applying a concept of ""demos"" as shorthand for ""consent of the governed"" fails in that the EU does not govern individuals, and ideally shouldn't, the EU governs states.

I would extend to say that the term ""demos"" is being used as ""ideal governable population"", which is inherently flawed because the characteristics of a good state is not how easy the population is to govern but how well it deals with conflict resoltion when conflict arrises.

La questione morale di Berlinguer arriva nell'81 (la famosa intervista a Scalfari) a completamento del processo isolazionistico iniziato nella seconda metà dei Settanta che porta il Pci nella condizione di essere l'unico partito al mondo che ha il 30% e non è buono di farci niente. Stante la necessità di darsi una spiegazione sufficientemente consolatoria della situazione, Berlinguer sceglie quella più facile e di sicuro effetto che è la questione morale: noi siamo onesti, gli altri sono mascalzoni e  siccome oltre che mascalzoni sono anche di più ci tengono fuori da tutto perché non ci perdonano la nostra onestà. 

Questa tendenza - storicamente da sempre presente a sinistra - vive una fase di incubazione molto forte nel periodo in questione (questo perché si presentano diverse occasioni in cui viene utile per spiegarsi quello che succede: la frattura politico-sociale col cosiddetto movimento del '77, il fallimento della solidarietà nazionale, le avvisaglie di Caf incipiente e della relativa marginalizzazione del Pci) e una volta che inizia a camminare sulle proprie gambe è una forza della natura. Agevolata dalle condizioni in cui si trova ad operare: il Pci passa infatti i successivi dieci anni a non contare una mazza e prendere schiaffi da Craxi (ognuno dei quali brucia il doppio). Questo fa sì che la convinzione di essere le vittime designate (e di esserlo unicamente perché colpevoli di essere delle brave persone) del marcio sistema si rafforzi. Tangentopoli fa il resto, fornendo il pretesto per poter dire visto che avevamo ragione ed erano tutti ladri tranne noi. Nel frattempo - e questo è un elemento che non va sottovalutato - si è pienamente compiuto il processo di santinizzazione del compagno Berlinguer, processo in forza del quale tutto quello detto o fatto da Berlinguer diventa dogma da cui non è ammesso deviare.

I comunisti arrivano dunque alla seconda repubblica col riflesso pavloviano della questione morale bello piantato nel mezzo del cervello. E iniziano a fare danni: compare Berlusconi e l'unica contromisura che viene adottata per contrastarlo è dire che lui e chi lo vota sono moralmente inferiori (e si è visto come è andata a finire); capita di andare al governo e la principale preoccupazione è quella di non deviare di un centimetro dall'immagine di sé pura e diversa che si è propinata nel tempo all'elettorato (il range delle conseguenze pratiche di questo atteggiamento varierà dalle gare di vaffanculi intra-maggioranza alle crisi di governo vere e proprie); si finisce ad inseguire sul terreno della purezza e della diversità mostri della diversità e della purezza che evidentemente non era bastato avere creato.

Più in generale, nei tent'anni passati tra la teorizzazione berlingueriana della questione morale ed il momento in cui gli eredi di Berlinguer si ritrovano ad esserne finiti dalla parte sbagliata (com'era la storia che quando fai la battaglia sulla purezza salta sempre fuori quello più puro di te che ti epura?), la questione morale medesima evolve adattandosi all'ambiente circostante (il sintomo più evidente è il forte innesto legalitario-manettaro seguente al '92) ma nelle linee fondamentali resta sempre uguale a se stessa: cioè una spiegazione cosmica ed onnicomprensiva del proprio fallimento.

Questo il quadro, non ci possiamo sorprendere se gli eredi degli eredi di Berlinguer (e, per quanto male possa fare ammetterlo, una più che significativa maggioranza della galassia grillina sull'argomento in questione è integralmente erede di Berlinguer, o almeno del suo mito) ne evidenziano in pieno gli aspetti salienti: il settarismo (solo noi buoni, tutti gli altri cattivi), la paranoia (ci tengono fuori perché non possono tollerare che l'onestà gli metta i bastoni tra le ruote), la pulsione isiolazionistica (noi insieme a quelli neanche un caffè).

true,OweH_OweH,,Hessen,"Some insight from a person being responsible for hiring inside a German public institution:

Several laws are involved. You have to make sure you don't disregard any women or disabled applicants.

This is checked not only by HR but also by the employee committee, the women's representative or equal opportunity commissioner and finally the handicapped employees representative.

It really takes an annoying amount of time for this process. If any of the involved committees has a problem with your candidates or your selection you may have to start all over again.

And then you only sorted through all applicants, pre-selecting the ones you want to interview and the ones you decline right at the beginning, you have not conducted one interview.

Normally it takes about 4 to 6 weeks until all involved bodies have met and came to a decision and you can invite for interviews and then another 4 weeks to get this finalized.

The fastest turnaround for one position I have seen has been 2 weeks before the interview and 3 weeks from the interview until the applicant was told he got the job. And this was only because he was the only one applying for it.

Yes, this is ludicrous, not only for the applicants but also for the person responsible for hiring the right person.

The bigger the company is, the more bureaucratic the process becomes and the longer it takes.

true,Andreahb,veneto,,"Guarda, ammetterai che però questa è una visione a tesi della campagna, fatta dal PCI, sulla questione morale; campagna che era partita anche prima di quella intervista fatta a Scalfari, in cui Berlinguer l'ha cristallizzata e resa esplicita.

Su alcune parti di questa analisi potrei anche essere d'accordo, ma su alcune delle premesse che hai fatto non ce la faccio.

il PCI riuscì a mettersi in quella posizione perché, 30% o meno, non era mai riuscito a entrare nel governo: non so se questo si configuri come ""non riuscire a farci niente"", però quantomeno  escluderei l'intento consolatorio.

Sul fatto che poi la questione morale sia stato un terreno solidissimo in cui il Pci, marginalizzat,o poteva trovare un sostegno sempre forte, questo è vero ed è innegabile. Come però è innegabile che se Berlinguer ha potuto concedersi quelle parole è perché, perlomeno a quei tempi, il pci era inattaccabile sulla gestione della cosa politica.

E sono d'accordo con te sul fatto che poi di Berlinguer si è voluto fare un santino perfetto e immacolato da tirare fuori quando se ne aveva bisogno, e quello che ci troviamo ora a gestire è più il mito di Berlinguer che il Berlinguer vero e proprio.

E ti assicuro che è stato poi un mito più sventolato da chi nel PCI si è staccato per andare su posizioni più moderate e centriste: dentro Rifondazione - perlomeno la base che ho frequentato io - c'era quasi un fastidio a voler tirare in mezzo Berlinguer e la questione morale.

E da qui salta fuori il problema secondo me di fondo di questo discorso. Quelli che tu chiami ""eredi di Berlinguer"" sono gli eredi della figurina di Berlinguer, figli del manettarismo di mani pulite - il momento in cui secondo me si è passato ad una concezione della questione morale come momento altissimo del fare politica, ad una questione morale che invece si identificava con un antipolitica ceca e qualunquista.

Su cui Berlinguer forse, secondo me, avrebbe preso le distanze, e di un bel po'.

Il fatto che ora gli eredi politici di Berlinguer si siano estinti (per colpe loro), ha lasciato il campo a tanti autoproclamatisi eredi spirituali del Berlinguerismo, che ora è conteso tra una parte del PD, una parte dei Grillini, e chiunque se ne voglia servire alla bisogna.

* Il Pci non riesce ad entrare nel governo per demerito suo. Si può discutere all'infinito su quanto l'uscita di scena di Moro renda l'esito inevitabile (il mio personale giudizio, per quel poco che vale, è no) ma dopo l'Andreotti IV (che parte come da programma con l'astensione del Pci) il Pci perde quel po' di piede che era riuscito a mettere nella porta e da quel trauma non si riavrà più, rendendosi necessaria la ridotta della questione morale: i democristiani, con i quali fino a poco prima si facevano le prove generali di maggioranza, tornano tutto d'un tratto ad essere i forchettoni come negli anni '50 e '60 (periodo nel quale, guarda caso, la Dc governava col Psi tenendo fuori i comunisti), ai socialisti viene ritirata l'aperturina di credito che si era concessa loro a maggior gloria della solidarietà nazionale 

* Perdonami la brutalità, ma la storia del Pci che poteva permettersi la questione morale perché alla fin fine era davvero più onesto degli altri è la madre di tutte le favole autoconsolatorie che ci si è raccontati per anni a sinistra. Il Pci campava da sempre di finanziamento illegale (proveniente da Stato ostile, per giunta), dove amministrativa si comportava in maniera sostanzialmente analoga agli altri partiti (che questo sia accaduto solo a livello locale perché a livello nazionale non si toccava palla incide nel volume complessivo ma non nella sostanza), dove esercitava potere di sottogoverno (e cioè, secondo la grande divisione per competenze che fu la Yalta della repubblica italiana, ai settori cultura e spettacoli) lo esercitava con gli stessi metodi che altri partiti usavano nelle proprie sfere di competenza. Capisco che all'idea del Pci diverso ci si sia andati affezionando nel tempo, ma è davvero fuffa

* Gli eredi di Berlinguer sono gli eredi di Berlinguer. Cioè la generazione che con Berlinguer segretario esce dai quadri giovanili per arrivare al partito e che prende il potere in nome del celebre rinnovamento nella continuità una volta che Berlinguer è morto e si è presentata la prima occasione disponibile per rottamare il povero Natta. Sono i famosi [""ragazzi di Berlinguer""](http://books.google.it/books/about/I_ragazzi_di_Berlinguer_Viaggio_nella_cu.html?id=agxkYkQmaYQC&amp;redir_esc=y), in pieno responsabili della santinizzazione di Berlinguer (per loro una necessità, dato che era da essa che traevano legittimazione come gruppo dirigente) ed in pieno responsabili della propagazione del berlinguerismo. Che oggi siano gli stessi ad avere interesse a farsi passare (anche con del successo) come eredi del mito e non della persona è - di nuovo - una mistificazione storica per attenuare la portata del proprio fallimento al contempo salvaguardando l'integrità del mito

How are Germans hypocritical?

I don't know maybe it has to do with believing that Eastern Europe should be dominated by Russia and that NATO has pushed them to the brink and therefor they are justified in aggression? Or it could be their resistance to sanctioning Russia for aggressive expansion all the while screaming about punishing the United States for NSA surveillance?

- Secondo me è discutibile il motivo per cui il Pci non è entrato nel governo, ma mi rendo conto che si starebbe discutendo dei se e dei ma, e si tratta di letture diverse della storia. Con questo non dico che non ci siano state delle responsabilità del partito, ma non esaurirei le motivazioni a quello (si usciva da un contesto politico che tuttora si fa fatica a delineare, se c'è un periodo su cui c'è poca chiarezza della storia politica italiana, è proprio in quegli anni lì).
Detto questo, quello di legare la frustrazione per il non governo con la ""costruzione"" della questione morale è un passaggio secondo me discutibile, una tesi che in molti sposano ma che a me sembra semplicistica e anche un po' dileggiante nei confronti di un partito e di un uomo politico che meriterebbero un po' più di considerazione.

- Sul ""solo il PCI non rubava"" ovviamente ci troviamo solo fazioni contrapposte, e io non sono neanche quello della difesa a tutti i costi, anzi. Però vanno fatto dei distinguo. Le magnitudo delle ruberie sono ben diverse tra un partito (la DC) che ha un monopolio del governo per anni e anni e un altro che si muove solo a livello locale, anche ammettendo il ""tutti rubano"". In più quantomeno nelle amministrazioni locali, non vorrai ascrivere l'idea del buon governo delle regioni rosse a delle favolette a cui i comunisti si sono affezionati. Lì le cose funzionavano, e si è creata un'ossatura di buona amministrazione che è quella che secondo me ci permetter di rimanere tuttora a galla.

Maybe chocolate but not the fries we have here in Belgium. We have thousands of dedicated stands and eatplaces for fries called Frituren all over the country to the point that we have one of the lowest amount of McDonalds per citizens. Where you can also get lots of fat meat food that you only really find in the Netherlands and Belgium (Bitterballen for example). I have yet to see frituren in most other countries, only the Netherlands is a country I know who has them and they call it Flemish fries. 

Our fries are also fried twice, I have yet to eat good fries in another country. They just taste salty most of the time and are cut too thick (like those in France), like in McDonalds. I also ate fries in Canada which barely had any taste at all. They're also almost never served with mayonaisse but with ketchup which is ridiculous. 

I find fries from most frituren not even that great, the fries my stepfather makes are really the best I ate. When you put a whole bunch on them on your fork and then dip them in mayonaisse it is the best thing ever. Although it's so drenched in fat my bowels can't take it.

Waffles aren't even that of a big deal here.

true,OWKuusinen,FINL,"Terijoki, Finland","&gt;The problem with this is I think it would be pretty much impossible for Russia to mobilize enough troops for some massive scale westward assault without advanced warning nowadays.

It's completely legit to bring forces to the border ""for training"" or for founding new bases. Russia has done both during the past few weeks.

&gt;The US sent Russia a warning when it added 10 thousand troops to the Ukrainian border, I don't see a massive WW2 era army buildup going unnoticed.

Yeah, after they had completely dropped the ball with Crimea. 

Also the whole army doesn't have to cross at the same time. You just have to have enough troops and vehicles to keep the blitzkrieg going until they reach earlier established targets (for example, the river that leads to Gdansk). These would be tanks etc. and could easily be found in the bases near the border or brought to the border ""for training"". 

As the front goes forward to reach the previously named target you can leave few armoured vehicles behind and drop more soldiers by air for support.

Ansonsten: Du kennst dich da offensichtlich viel besser aus als ich.. ich hab die AfD in letzter Zeit ignoriert - nach ein wenig Recherche auf Wikipedia scheine ich aber nicht allzu abseits vom Konsens in der Richtung zu sein... was du meinst sind offenbar neuere Flügel in der Partei bzw. potenzielle Spaltungstendenzen... ich hoffe einfach mal die Idioten bleiben in der Minderheit bzw. sieht es ja so aus, als ob die sich zumindest gut genug zerfleischen um unattraktiv für den Protestwähler zu werden.... wer weiss.

Somehow the debate only focused on the overblown threat of 'terrorism', and most of the measures implemented to combat this supposed threat were directed at citizens.  
European intelligence agencies have circumvented their national laws by trading intel with the 5/9/X Eyes community; We'll spy on your citizens if you'll spy on ours.  
  
With all this in mind, I don't think German politicians are naive about spying. I believe they're feigning outrage to win the voters' favor. (2013 was an election year in Germany.) I also believe they're doing it because they can benefit from it.  
The German proposal for a 'European internet', keeping data within the EU, creates an advantage for European intelligence agencies. They won't have to try and fetch the data in transit or from American data-centers anymore. It will all be stored right under their noses.

I comment on stories from the Middle East and about Christian persecution, as a Middle Eastern Christian I feel in these situations I can share an interesting outlook on such situations. I have no personal vendetta against Muslims, that's complete bullshit. It just so happens that Christian persecution is rampant in Muslim-majority countries, which has to do with a growing trend of intolerant extremist streams in Islam.

Nuclear power plants are centralized and owned by one company. One company has the power over hundreds of thousands of people's energy. Decentralized power generation is good for the consumer.

Nuclear power plants are worse than coal and especially gas power plants at regulating the fluctuation of energy levels that results from using wind/solar.

Do you have comprehension issues? As I've already stated that I know you didn't say Labour caused the recession. The point I made about you thinking that it was somehow their fault appears to have been validated so thanks for that.

&gt;Or perhaps you'r reading my mind?

That shouldn't take too long.


&gt;their policies might have made it worse.

You think that Labour policies made a world-wide recession worse? Really?


&gt;And heading for a recession.

That's a news article from 2008. There was a general election in 2010. The recession had already hit and the country saw growth prior to the tories taking power.

&gt;Facts. Facts, facts, facts. You're a bit rubbish with them.

* It was an ego thing. After all, what more can you be than the president. 
* He doesn't mean to stay in politics for ever (in 2009, he said ""by 2014, I will have retired from politics""), so he wanted to end his political career big. 
* He doesn't seem to have much idea about how to solve the country's problems (unemployment, debt...), so the presidential office might have been a way of running away with style.
* His party is very loyal to him. It might be that the new PM (which would imho be the current interior minister Kaliňák) would be pretty much Fico's puppet.

&gt;In and around [Miami-Dade County](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County) and [Broward County](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broward_County), a unique dialect, commonly called the ""Miami dialect"", is widely spoken. The dialect developed among second- or third-generation [Hispanics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans), including [Cuban-Americans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban-American), whose first language was English (though some [non-Hispanic white](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_white), [black](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people), and [other races](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_in_the_US) who were born and raised in Miami-Dade tend to adopt it as well.)  It is based on a fairly [standard American accent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_American) but with some changes very similar to dialects in the [Mid-Atlantic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_States) (especially the [New York area dialect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_dialect), [Northern New Jersey English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_English#North_Jersey_English), and [New York Latino English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Latino_English).) Unlike Virginia Piedmont, Coastal Southern American, and Northeast American dialects and Florida Cracker dialect (see section below), ""Miami accent"" is [rhotic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_and_non-rhotic_accents); it also incorporates a rhythm and pronunciation heavily influenced by Spanish (wherein rhythm is [syllable-timed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrony#syllable_timing)).

So yes, I believe in pluralism very much. Just as a member of the EU believes in a European identity and European community and European unity. I see zero difference, other than the fact that Arab countries are historically much closer than European ones. 

Second- I'm not a ""hardcore"" pan Arabist at all. I don't support Ba'ath, I don't support Asad, and I'm not a Nasserist. So I'd love to hear how you define a ""hardcore pan Arabist"". I support pan-Arabism just as I support the EU.

Third- who are you kidding Kimi ? Are we really going to have this argument? Come on man, look at your posting history. I comment in dozens of subreddits about socialism, history, economics, philosophy, religion. You have one interest. Just one overwhelming obsession.

* Oui, faire un truc aussi simple qu'une horloge qui reste à l'heure demande à être connecté à internet. Faire un truc qui reste  l'heure GMT, il suffit d'un timer 555. Un truc qui reste à l'heure dans n'importe quel fuseau, il faut une connexion net.

* Tu dois intégrer à tes programmes qu'entre deux heures identiques à des dates différentes, parfois il y a une heure en plus, parfois une heure en moins.

* Ce changement d'heure utilise des règles différentes en fonctions des années et des fuseaux horaires, donc une opération simple comme le calcul de la différence entre deux dates demande un putain d'appel à une base de données pour vérifier si on a un nombre impair de changement d'heure à l'intérieur.

* Comme de part le monde il y a deux ou trois changement de système par an, la base de donnée doit être mise à jour manuellement. Donc la solution pratique c'est de la synchroniser par internet en utilisant une source réputée. On est loin d'un petit 555 là.

* Dans certaines zones il est impossible de connaitre 20 ans à l'avance la date des changements.

* Les serveurs qui ont besoin de connaitre l'heure locale de leurs clients doivent, pour ce cas particulier, prévoir énormément de cas spéciaux. Si tu dois synchroniser un rendez-vous à 2h30 avec des gens de différentes timezones et que tu veux par exemple envoyer une alerte 40 minutes avant pour prévenir, ben il faut tenir en compte que 2h30 n'existe pas, que ça doit être transformé en 3h30 mais que 40 minutes avant 3h30 c'est 1h50. Mais attention! Si tu changes ce rendez vous de timezone parce que tu t'es planté initialement, il faut refaire tous ces calculs, sinon en transposant tu risques d'avoir une alerte 1h40 avant l'heure au lieu de 40 minutes avant.

So most journalist go for the easy polical corruption scandal.

Regarding the political influence the church has, its innocent enough, look at russia, and don't think for a moment our plebs are more worldly than theirs. 

Is it fundamentally the church's fault that Romanians still need divine guidance in the unsure waters of democracy. Is it the people's fault for having a medieval civic behavior and lack of interest in the institutions that keeps them at an almost medieval level of development? 

I think the church should be more transparent and priests should be held to some earthly moral standards and judged accordingly. But in this particular case most people are still at the level of not caring about the democratic process, I do not blame politicians for organising electoral feast or giving away buckets for votes, that is our level of democracy, and we have so many poor people that are so detached from the government that a good meal once every 2 years for a vote is a bargain.

On commence à parler un peu trop sérieusement pour /r/rance/ mais je doute que les étiquettes droite/gauche s'appliquent vraiment aux partis nationalistes. Dés qu'on s'éloigne du centre, cet axe a moins de sens.

Économiquement, le FN est non-conventionnel, mais pas extrêmement à droite (l'extrême droite économique, ce serait plutôt un Alain Madelin ultralibéral). Socialement, sur certains sujets comme la place de la religion ou le mariage gay, ils sont plus modérés que l'UMP. Ce n'est que sur d'autres sujets comme l'islam ou l'immigration qu'ils sont extrêmes.

Je rappelle que la Lemagnene-Asie avait une politique économique qu'aujourd'hui on situerait bien à gauche (forte intervention de l'état dans la vie économique). 

A mon sens, le nationalisme est un axe en lui-même, orthogonal à l'axe gauche/droite.

Estimado señor,

Hoy le escribo porque quiero agradecerle el maravilloso tiempo que tuve en Málaga. Decidí viajar con Thomas Cook al ver su anuncio en el diario porque nunca había viajado a España. ¡Que buena idea! Me acompañaron unos amigos del colegio, y juntos pasamos unas vacaciones buenisimas. Antes de salir compré una guía de España en la oficina de Thomas Cook. Ha sido sumamente útil. Además, le agradezco su ayuda en vendernos euros y el seguro de viaje.


Al llegar al aeropuerto de Málaga, tomamos un taxi para ir directamente al hotel. Allá, desempaquetamos nuestras cosas y, sin perder un momento, fuimos a la playa. ¡Que alegría! Hacía sol y muchísimo calor. Por la noche fuimos a un restaurante en la ciudad. La comida estaba deliciosa y me encantó el ambiente. Los demás días los pasamos entre conocer la ciudad y divertirnos en la playa. Lo que más me gustó fue la comida. Comí bastante pescado y perritos calientes, pero la comida que más me gustó fue la paella. Espero que haya otra oportunidad de visitar España en el futuro. Quisiera ir a Córdoba a ver la Mezquita.


El año que viene tengo ganas de ir a España con mis amigos porque sería genial descansar sin tener que estudiar. Cuando vaya a Europa en el futuro viajaré definitivamente con Thomas Cook porque no nos dió ningun problema.



* señor should be lower case
* ""a usted"" is not needed and sounds bad (but it's not wrong)
* agradecerle is without ""por"", ""por"" is used when it's a pasive sentence ""estoy agradecido por"" 
* ""en el diario **porque** nunca"" you could use ""porque"" or a comma "","", but not both at the same time
* ""buean idea"", idea is feminine , so ... ""buena"" instead of ""buen""
* colegio = school (up to 12years old more or less), instituto = high school, universidad = university / college
* unas instead of las vacaciones, this is hard to explain why
* En realidad should be used to offer a different point of view, like some unexpected event/result
* again, agradecer goes without ""por""
* los euros, los shouldn't be there, similar to las vacaciones, you could remove ""los"" or use ""unos""
* llegar a SOME PLACE, llegar en TRANSPORT/VEHICLE . LLegar a mi casa, llegar en coche.
* a + el = al (aeropuerto)
* desempaqueTAmos
* Hacía instead of hizo, hacía means the action took place and had a durantion. You just arrived to the hotel and are describing what was happening at the moment. ""I arrived. It was raining"" vs ""I arrived. It rained""
* muy deliciosa is not wrong, but sounds weird to mi, deliciosa is already ""very good"", it's similar to say ""very fabulous"" ... fabulous already implies it's better than good.
* los pasamos, depends on meaning, ""pasar"" needs a direct object, in this case ""los demás días"", so you could say ""pasamos los demás días entre ..."" or ""los demás días los pasamos entre..."" both are right
* calienteS (needs a S at the end)
* agradable is not wrong, but sounds really weird to me when talking about food ""que más me gustó"" sounds way better
* haya oportunidad is not wrong, but it implies that there wasn't an opportunity yet, like you never when to Spain (and you did!), better to use ""haya OTRA oportunidad""
* visitar España, visitar + some place   or    visitar A + someone, without the a this time
* some extra commas not really needed
* lindo sounds very south american, genial (cool) is more common in Spain


**IMPORTANT** Overall is great, and if I were you, I wouldn't change a thing or it will raise some doubts about your work! I already had bad experiences with Spanish teachers in the US. I helped some friends and later the teacher said their homework was wrong, her corrections were wrong, very wrong, like first year spanish student will know. It's true that the Spanish taught at the US is influenced by south american Spanish, some words or expressions that are not wrong, but it will be weird if used in Spain.

**USE this at your own risk!** I'm Spanish, but I'm not a language major,so I could have made mistakes too

The best way to learn is to expose yourself to situations in which you'll need to speak/listen to the language - even if you don't always understand, just by hearing how people structure sentences and use words will help in your comprehension, and at some point things should just start to click.  Don't take the attitude to just use English as a fallback, rather try and use German even if you think you're awful.

*Main Story*

* Golden Dawn Cyprus (ELAM) managed to siege the conference hall in where Mehmet Ali Talat (T/C centre-left politician, former leader of n. Cyprus) was giving a speech about the prospects of Cyprus reunification. The event was organised by Europe Direct and many foreign officials were present.

* Police (initially a couple of them, reinforcements arrived very late) and around 80 ELAM supporters clashed outside the building. Three were briefly detained on that night, one (ELAM's MEP candidate and apparent mob leader) was detained the next day, and at least one more is wanted. The district court found the police’s arguments to be “unclear and vague” and did not uphold the detention of the 4.

* ELAM's statements defend their actions, saying that Talat should be considered a war criminal as he was a 'grand slaughterer' of [TMT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Resistance_Organization) in his youth, and that it is unacceptable that Talat was allowed to have armed bodyguards in the 'free' areas. 
Talat, in a radio interview denied both accusations. His guards weren't armed, if they were, they wouldn't be able to cross the border. More importantly, it was completely impossible for him to have committed criminal actions with TMT because during the war he was a university student in Ankara and only returned to Cyprus in 1977. He added that as a dedicated Marxist, he would harm his friends and brothers. “If they have proof for those accusations, I will agree to receive trial from a Greek Cypriot court” 

* The public outcry has been unanimous calling for a criminal investigation of ELAM. The Police was criticised in the harshest terms for this utter failure. The Government described ELAM's action as “terrorist”. Protest marches against neo-fascism were organised the very next day.

* Talat said that minority actions like this reinforce the need to cultivate a culture of peace, and that radical nationalists of any side must become isolated. He shared that he immediately received an apology call from the President of Cyprus. He added ""If Greek Cypriots didn't want a solution, they wouldn't invite me in the south in the first place"". He suggested various measures that could work towards creating a culture of peace, like creating a bicommunal university on neutral ground (in the DMZ), and teachers exchange (T/C teachers visiting Greek schools, and G/C teachers visiting Turkish schools)

* ELAM's popular support is barely 1% (~2000 voters), and they are not represented in any elected office.

* Trade unions from south and north, through their federations, decided that the time to resume their common struggle has come. South's PEO and the north's DEV-İŞ will hold a joint protest on May Day, in the Demilitarisation Zone in Nicosia. Common May Day protests and industrial actions used to be the norm in Cyprus, but this wasn't possible since 1958.

* Private-practising doctors (80% of the doctor population in Cyprus) push for a delay in creating a National Healthcare System, planned for mid-2015. Cyprus is the only EU country without an NHS, and 60% of medical bills are paid out of the pocket, 15% by private insurance plans, and  25% being state-subsidised by temporary arrangements [WHO 2010 data]. The current plan has a provision for a single health care provider, founded by a) working population, b) employers, and c) the state, where private insurance companies offer complimentary plans, similar to France and UK's system. The private doctors' union and private insurance companies call for adopting the Dutch model of using private insurance companies as healthcare providers, citing it as Europe's best NHS scheme, clearly superior to England's 'waiting list nightmare'. Another argument in favour of the current system by the private doctors is that right now Cypriots can directly go to the specialist, without having to go through a “GP” or “family doctor”, which is 'tedious'.

* [Orbán said the country is against economic sanctions for Russia](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21nubs/hungary_opposed_to_economic_sanctions_against/), which makes sense, they just signed away the biggest business deal of the past 30 years, the building of the new reactors of the Paks nuclear plant, to them. 

* [Orbán visited Saudi Arabia.](http://www.politics.hu/20140324/pm-says-wont-preach-to-saudi-arabia-about-human-rights/) The most significant information from that trip was that Hungarian media found out from a Saudi article that Orbán has a middle name (Mihály= Michael) that he never uses and so far did not mention anywhere. ^^^muffled ^^^WHAT ^^^IS ^^^HE ^^^HIDING?!?!?!?!?!? ^^^plays ^^^in ^^^the ^^^distance Minor note was given to the fact that a member of the extended delegation of entrepreneurs was János Kóka, prominent Liberal Party member and former Minister of Economy and Transport, and that he was also given a diplomatic passport by a high ranking Fidesz official for this and other trips. 

* Jobbik VP and main economy expert János Volner was found to have gotten his university degree from a suspected degree mill in St. Petersburg, Russia only last year. He is the Jobbik appointee to basically every economy-related committee, meetings and such and likely the mastermind behind Jobbik's election program's finance side. Needless to say, the biggest criticism for that was that it's unrealistic and fails to account for the most basic laws of economics - now we know why.

taxes really are confusing and complicated, and without speaking German really well you'll have a hard time doing your own taxes. But there are ""Steuerberater"", tax consultants, who can do it for you - for a fee, of course. There are some non-profit clubs that help with taxes, too, but I believe they only do income tax. Check the internet if there are self-help groups or similar things for ""Firmengründer""; the local chamber of trade or commerce can also help (""Handwerkskammer"", ""Handelskammer"").  
A bank account shouldn't be difficult to get; what you need is a proof of address by your local ""Einwohnermeldeamt"" or local council. Also to start a business you'll need a ""Gewerbeschein"" which is fortunately easy to get and only costs twenty Euros or so for a year. With that, you can basically employ yourself.  
Also choose your bank carefully, some charge a monthly amount for running an account, some don't over a certain income level, and again others don't charge at all (e.g. Sparda, PSD Bank). The latter usually only do private accounting though so maybe you'll need a different bank to handle your business. 
An apartment, now - well I've never tried that as a self-employed person. You will probably be more successful if you a) have some savings that you can show to the landlord as proof that you can pay while your business takes off, and b), explain to them what you are trying. No guarantees, though. There are also council- or municipal- owned apartments to be had but for some of them you need to qualify through low income, having kids etc.  
My strategy, if I were in your shoes, would be to either rent a very small, cheap place for starters and try to get something nice once I have regular income, or if my business entails renting office space, rent one with a bath and sleep there. Electric cookers, a fridge and a microwave are quickly bought (or brought overt form the UK).

true,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"As an EU citizen, you have most of the rights a German has.

Taxes are... complicated, yes; but when are taxes ever simple? A lot depends on how much you earn: if it's little enough (if you made less than €17,500 last year and are unlikely to make more than €50,000 this year), you have the option of taking advantage of the ""small business"" regulations, which will spare you the chore of doing the VAT and double-entry book-keeping. But if you don't know your way around the German tax system, you would be well advised to hire a tax consultant.

To get a basic current bank account, you need a passport and proof of police registration (""Polizeiliche Anmeldung""). This registration is required within two weeks of taking up residence (although, despite the name, registration is not directly with the police, but at the local ""Meldestelle"", which is usually in the town hall) and requires a written confirmation from the landlord as well as your passport.

Without proof of employment, you'll still get your bank account, but you may not have an overdraft facility.

There is no requirement of any kind to actually have proof of employment or a bank account to sign a tenancy agreement. But obviously, a landlord is going to need convincing that you will actually be able to pay the rent, so some landlords may want to see a statement of earnings. Payment is customarily done via direct bank transfers, but if you don't have a bank account you can pay cash directly into the landlord's bank account. Of course, if you're renting a cheap little bedsit for a couple of months, the landlord may accept cash (or even insist on it, if it's a slightly shady landlord keen on avoiding taxes).

This is important because even when you're going 300, on a German autobahn there is always someone faster than you, and overtaking someone on the right side is madness at these speeds. Thus, staying in the leftmost lane is putting you at risk of being approached fast from behind (sounds crazy, I know).

* 50s: The Audi proves the importance of my previous point by overtaking him at about 320 km/h (lol what spells did they cast on that A3)

* 1m25s: See how the Audi has to start braking hundreds of meters before the next car? It can happen that other cars overtake slower ones in the left lane while going 130. From the Audi's perspective that's like approaching a parked car at 190 km/h, much faster than most people will ever drive.

That is actually the quickest way to lose a war as a democratic society, simply because the general population will have none of that and they will want out. That's exactly what happened with the US airforce bombing every suspected inch of non-allied Vietnam and also the French counter-insurgency campaign in Algeria. 

And, when utilised by non-democratic nations where domestic support is not an issue, the result is often counter productive.

Then there also is 21% VAT tax, which is applied to everything you could spend your money on legally, so you are only left with 2,89 euro.

So effectively there is 54% tax rate. Also regular taxes (electricity, water, heating), basic food, anything else you can not go by without and you're nearly out of money.

In fact, I'm leaning toward the somewhat excentric but strangely appealing ""One-[norrlänning](http://imgur.com/ejwcR6q) universe""-theory made famous by physicist Richard Feynman. This theory states that there is in fact only one northener, bending spacetime as to appear at several places at the same time.

&gt;c'est toujours un service de pietre qualité mais les prix ont explosé en plus. Ca coute plus cher de faire Paris -&gt; Les Vosges en tgv seconde classe que Tokyo -&gt; Osaka en Shinkansen en premiere classe.

La comparaison est ridicule. D'abord la SNCF est une entreprise privée. Ensuite tu compares le trajet entre deux villes de plusieurs millions d'habitants. La plus grande ville des Vosges, Épinal, a 32 000 habitants. Et en plus tu dis n'importe quoi : un Tokyo Osaka c'est dans les 100€ en 2^nde classe contre 80€ max pour un Paris Épinal le jour même sans réduction.

true,bobdole3,UNSA,United States of America,"Obvious troll is obvious, but I'll see what I can do. 

The idea that problems in other countries are ""not my problem"" is a very common one in American politics, and in the American public. The general feeling among a large chunk of the public is that the rest of the world is filled with sponges and hipocrites. No one wants America around until they need something, and every problem gets blamed on the US. Oh, there's a dictator in Africa comitting genocide? Why haven't the Americans stopped him? The US has intervened in a country to depose a dictator? Those damn imperialists! Everyone critiques our warmongering ways, but the only reason that they can say that is because our armed forces have massively subsidized global defense.

Whether the sentiment is true or not is irrelevant. One of the great things about being in America is that we have exactly zero reasons to give a fuck about what anyone says. 

We *do* however have many fucks to give about what non-Americans actually *do* though. All of the problems brought up, Russia, Mexico, terrorism are very much our problems. Russia taking Canada's arctic territory (theoretically) provides Russia access to both valuable resources, as well as a foothold on the North American continent. The oceans are our best defense, and letting a hostile power gain a hold on our landmass is a threat. 

As for radical Islam and terrorism, why do we even need this discussion? We already know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that these are people interested in hurting America. We know, because it **already fucking happened**. Our best defense against extremism is to educate at risk people and improve their standards of living, which by default is something you've got do do in their own country. 

And of course, Mexico is a much bigger security threat to the US than Islamist terrorists and Russian expansion put together. Some of the South American cartels are ""gangs"" in name only. They've got armed forces composed of hundreds of thousands of soldiers. In many cases they've infultrated the military, special forces, and government. The reason that in Mexico the drug kingpins are always caught by the navy is because that's the only branch of the Mexican armed forces that can be trusted with the task. And this isn't some far away banana republic, this is a large country *that we share a largely unsecured border with*. The US is their primary market, and drug dealers kill innocent American citizens each day. If the Mexican government ever totally collapses, we're going to see a massive rush of immigrants, as well as a huge inflow of dealers and dangerous gang members. All of the propaganda you hear from far right groups about the dangers of immigration is going to look positively liberal in a situation like that. 

As for that missing jet, the 24/7 coverage is stupid for sure, but there were still Americans who went down on it. Besides, it's a good practical test for some of our location equipment. Much better to try it out now than to wait to see if it works on a Chinese sub.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_railway_companies_in_Japan

&gt; There are 27,268 km of rail crisscrossing the country. JR (a group of companies formed after privatization of JNR) controlled 20,135 km of these lines as of March 31, 1996, with the remaining 7,133 km in the hands of private enterprise local railway companies. Japan's railways carried 22.24 billion passengers (395.9 billion passenger-kilometres) in fiscal 2006.[2][better source needed] In comparison, Germany has over 40,000 km of railways, but carries only 2.2 billion passengers per year[citation needed].[3] Because of the massive use of its railway system, Japan is home to 46 of the world's 50 busiest stations.[4]

&gt; Japanese railways are among the most punctual in the world. The average delay on the Tokaido Shinkansen in fiscal 2006 was only 0.3 minutes.[14] When trains are delayed for as little as five minutes, the conductor makes an announcement apologizing for the delay and the railway company may provide a ""delay certificate"" (遅延証明書), as no one would expect a train to be this late. Japanese passengers rely heavily on rail transit and take it for granted that trains operate on time. When trains are delayed for an hour or more, it may even appear in the newspaper.[15] However, some argue that railway staff are under too much pressure from the public. These stringent standards are considered contributors to the cause of serious accidents such as the Amagasaki rail crash in 2005.[16]

Je pense que ça suffit. Mais bien sur ""best"" est toujours subjectif.

&gt;Source ? À quel prix ?

Source c'est ma vie là bas écoute. Fais une commande sur amazon.jp et tu verras les délais de livraison. Ils utilisent majoritairement [Yamato Transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_Transport) ([Tarifs](http://www.kuronekoyamato.co.jp/en/send/ta_q_bin/kanto/)).  
A quel prix? Au prix le plus juste que le marché accepte. Et en l'occurence le prix est tout à fait raisonnable. A vrai dire, je trouve la poste francaise extrement chere en comparaison. La seule fois où j'ai decidé d'envoyer un paquet du Japon à la France, j'ai d'abord été étonné du prix (ca avait du me couter peut etre 500 yens), mais surtout de la rapidité à laquelle c'est arrivé. Dans l'autre sens j'avais le choix entre quelque chose comme 15 euros, et en express 50 euros (pur nonsens sachant que j'envoyais un telephone de quelques grammes). Et les delais de livraison sont à plus d'une semaine.

&gt;La comparaison est ridicule. D'abord la SNCF est une entreprise privée

rofl. Avec un état actionnaire à 100% et un monopole complet. Elles sont bien les entreprises privées en France.

&gt;Et en plus tu dis n'importe quoi : un Tokyo Osaka c'est dans les 100€ en 2nde classe contre 80€ max pour un Paris Épinal le jour même sans réduction.

Et bien écoute, je suis peut etre tombé sur une mauvaise période (decembre) mais j'ai payé plus de 100e pour faire Paris -&gt; Remiremont.  
De toute façon ça n'est meme pas de prix dont il s'agit. Mais de rapport entre prix et qualité de service, et de choix.  
Mais si tu es content de ce qui t'es proposé, très bien pour toi.


EDIT:  
&gt;Comparaison des prix et services par rapport au niveau de vie moyen ?

J'ai zappé ta question. Au niveau du prix par rapport au niveau de vie c'est  correct. C'est dur a comparer parce que les tickets varient selon la distance. Ce qui est logique. Un ticket a paris c'est un prix fixe de 1.70e, soit 240 yens. La majorité de mes déplacements à tokyo tournent autour des 150-200 yens. Et bien sur ils ont meilleur GDP/PPP.

When we look at a data map, we expect to be able to compare apples to apples. A common context and data adjustment for outliers, seasonality, locality is what makes it useful.

You brought up that Belgium data can be explained by a local law. How many people are aware of that law and can make that intrinsic adjustment when comparing the numbers?

I will give you another one: the changes between 2008-2013 in Romania and Bulgaria. At first sight the data looks a bit weird, I mean why is Bulgaria at 41% in both maps? Well, the answer is because Bulgaria's Lev is pegged to the Euro. 

But then what can explain the change from 10% to 32% for Romania? Can that be explained by inflation? But if Romania had inflation, then Bulgaria didn't? So how is inflation captured in these 4 numbers? Can we even compare them in a a meaningful way? How many people here even know the Lev is pegged to Euro?

And I am sure if we spend some time we will find similar arguments for a lot of numbers on those maps.

Double book keeping you only need once you have some sort of limited. Before that a trade licence/Gewerbeschein does it. (and it takes one short trip to get it) 
Collect all your invoices (in and out) over the year and dump it on your tax accountants desk.

Don't do the taxes yourself, btw. A tax accountant always pays for himself many times over with the money he saves you. (Unless you REALLY make &lt; 17.5k or something around there)

If you do get a limited there is a bit more overhead in accounting, but it gives you a bit more freedom in creativity with the taxes.

As for working living/space it really depends on what you want to do. Legally you have no problem running an office type business out of your apartment. On top of that you can deduct part of your rent then.

The difference was their final years (2008-2010) with very strict austerity measures which truly branded the scarlet letter on them (A for austerity?), whereas Fidesz made everyday life easier and cheaper for many during the current term, at the price of risking future investments to the country.

That and the former VP of the Socialists was found to have multiple hidden bank accounts in Austria, now totalling nearly 1m€ on them which he didn't report for over 6 years.

Mmm, no. The methyl alcohol content, that could blind or even kill you, is very, very low, even if the proper technique is not followed when distilling (it just tastes horrible). This is an american scare about moonshine from the prohibition era, but even then the few health issues were caused by using improvised/improper stills, not methyl alcohol poisoning.

Not using sugar because it's expensive is sometimes mis-represented as a matter of pride (""pure fruit, no sugar added""), but all alcohol comes from natural fructose in this case. Depending on the fruits used, sugar may even not be necessary. Not in any way dangerous.

I don't get the burning rubber part, except for maybe using rubber instead of wood while distilling. I very much doubt even the poorest of the poor do that (plenty of other less nasty things to burn).

Not true. Andalusian Spanish and Canarian Spanish are recognised dialects. There's more that one dialectical variation within a single country.

Be aware that *one* thing is ""Castilian"" as a term for the Spanish language and *another* ""Castilian"" as the dialectical variety of the Spanish language spoken in Castile. 

 For example, in Argentina the major dialect is Rioplatense Spanish (also spoken in Uruguay), which is **not** the same as the Spanish spoken in the northwest (Salta, Jujuy, etc.). ""Chilean Spanish"" can also be divided into northern Chilean (that has quechua influences) and southern Chilean, that doesn't have them. Bolivian Spanish can be divided into Andean Spanish in the west and the Spanish of the Lowlands in the east.

There isn't such a thing as one country = one language. Within Spain there are several dialects of Spanish, just as within England there are different types (""accents"" if you wish) of English.

true,thefrenchdoctor,PACA,PACA,"Imaginons que Marine Le Pen gagne en 2017. C'est peu probable que le FN ait la majorité au parlement ensuite.

Ce sera certainement pas le cas au Sénat, parce que même si tous ses candidats municipaux sont élus aujourd'hui, ils resteront moins nombreux que les UMP, PS, EELV (FDG aussi ?) et indépendants. Ils seront donc loin d'être assez nombreux pour avoir une majorité de sénateurs, sans compter le fait que le Sénat se renouvelle par moitié, et rien ne dit les hypothétiques maires et conseillers FN soient reconduits (surtout quand on regarde leur histoire municipale). Je pense que les FN joueront plutôt la nuisance envers les partis de gouvernement, voire le parti au gouvernement.

Pour les législatives, l'implantation locale du FN laisse encore à désirer, bien qu'elle soit meilleure qu'en 2008 ou 2012. Là le FN sera obligé de présenter ses maires, qui sont connus, pour avoir ses chances, mais ça ira contre leur rhétorique anti-cumul. Il faudra aussi que lesdits maires aient un bon bilan de mi-mandat, ce qui est loin d'être acquis. Ce sont essentiellement des militants de longue date, mais ils n'ont aucune expérience de gestion, donc je doute de leurs capacités à faire changer les choses en 3 ans.

Enfin, le point le plus important : si le FN gagne la présidentielle, on va sans doute avoir une mobilisation aux urnes massive, comme en 2002.

En bref, la question c'est plutôt que fera un président FN minoritaire ? Pas grand chose. La tradition voudrait qu'il s'occupe de politique étrangère, mais cette tradition repose sur un quasi-consensus gauche-droite en la matière. Or quel est le programme du FN en politique étrangère ? Une alliance franco-russe ? Le président peut signer tous les traités qu'il veut, ils ne seront pas ratifiés par le parlement ou appliqués par le gouvernement. Une sortie de l'UE ? Idem.

Si on extrapole encore un peu, soit le président démissionne (parce qu'il y a de la contestation sociale : des grèves, des manifs...), soit le congrès modifie la Constitution pour le renverser, soit il devient aussi utile que le président allemand ou italien pour 5 ans.

TL;DR : la France dirigée par le FN, c'est pas pour 2017. 2017 c'est jamais que dans 3 ans, ils sont pas prêts.

true,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"That's the point. Since Osborne, and representatives from the two other major parties, announced Scotland could never use the pound, Salmond has been calling it a bluff and analyses have come out that undermines (well, at least calls it in to question) the original supporting evidence for refusing a currency union. Against that background, a poll was carried out in Scotland that showed the majority were convinced Osborne was bluffing to gain advantage in the referendum. 

A few days back, the guardian ran a story about a senior pro-union minister leaking that it was a bluff and that 'of course' there would be a union, potentially as a quid pro quo for allowing nuclear weapons to remain based on Scotland. 

The safest assumption to draw from all this is Better Together are not at all unified on how to go about things. The next is that everything will be on the table going into negotiations, even if a currency zone doesn't end up happening. 

The major implications isn't so much in persuading people that a currency zone will happen but in undermining confidence in what the BT campaign says.  Even pro-union papers have run 'sunk' front pages with pictures of 'HMS Better Together' since the leak. It'll be interesting to see how the polling goes  whether this affects the rate of the swing to yes (it's currently to slow to win), and whether even more people will now view it as a bluff. Either way, the best part of last week was focussed on the failings of Better Together and not the potential failings of an IScotland, that would not have been planned for.
