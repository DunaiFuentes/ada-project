In that context, I am happy they are restraining themselves to tiny re-enactments of marching defeated 'Nazis' through streets in soviet WW2 tradition rather than than the more ""visceral"" practices of that era they could have went with.

I am in fact 99% sure that the primary reason Kiev has deployed Azov battalion and is allowing them to conduct themselves as they do is exactly to escalate vitriol and get these kind of reactions in order to further decrease any possibility of successful negotiations.

I have never heard of any such specifications, I doubt they exist, and even if they do I don't see how you can claim that ISIS will never meet them.

&gt;i see no real problem with uk not recognising them as a state and yet stating they will not be left stateless in their own terms, by their own thinking. 

It doesn't matter what the people think. It's what the state thinks. the state says that one should not be left stateless. The state says ISIS is not a state. How can the state then say that someone has citizenship of a country that to the states mind doesn't exist? In any court case that would be brought about citizenship revocation the burden would be on the state to prove that the person has the citizenship of another state. The UK can not argue in court that ISIS is a state, then deny that on the world stage. It's not something a state can do.

&gt;it speaks to the crux of the matter: what they consider civilisation, the rest of us don't.

true,Solokian,null,null,"Bon sans surprises je suis d'accord avec toutes les réponses, mais comme la tienne est la seule ""contre"" je réponds ici.


Pour commencer, je suis entièrement d'accord avec toi pour dire que le danger d'aggravation des symptômes des schizophrènes est un point qu'il faut mentionner systématiquement dans toute discussion sur la légalisation du cannabis. Dire que ça n'existe pas, amoindrir cet argument, c'est aussi stupide et stérile que de classer le cannabis en drogue dure dans l'autre sens.


Maintenant, examinons la situation actuelle. Un jeune avec des tendances schizophrènes se voit proposer un joint par des potes. Qui, vraiment, sérieusement, honnêtement, va lui parler des risques pour sa santé mentale ? Pas ceux qui lui tendent le pilon.


Si, dans le meilleurs des cas, il en entend parler, ça sera par ceux qui font les campagnes de sensibilisations dans les collèges et lycées, ou en tout cas par une voix de l'autorité publique. La même autorité qui, aujourd'hui encore, continue à parler du cannabis comme une drogue dure, qui rend physiquement dépendant, assimilable à et entraînant la consommation de drogues comme l'héroïne. La même autorité qui refuse complètement et totalement le moindre débat, la moindre discussion sur la question de la légalisation. Oui, même un ministre peut se faire grossièrement réprimander quand il propose l'idée d'un débat. Pas d'une légalisation, ni même d'un assouplissement de la législation, juste un débat.


Pour en revenir au jeune, tu penses bien que ce que dit cette autorité là, il a compris depuis un bout de temps que c'était des conneries. Il voit bien que le cannabis c'est pas de la mort en barrettes. Donc il pense que tout ce qu'on lui dit de négatif dessus, c'est faux. Même les vrais risques.


Maintenant, imagine qu'on légalise le chanvre comme au Colorado. Même limite d'âge que l'alcool, contrôle extrêmement strict des papiers avant d'acheter, points de ventes limités et très encadrés. Au-delà de tous les avantages pour la société dont les autres ont parlé, pour notre jeune, ça veut dire quoi ?


Tu connais ce pays comme moi, tu sais donc que si le cannabis devient légal mais accessible aux majeurs seulement, le marché noir continuera de fournir les mineurs. Entre autre parce qu'après des décennies d'illégalité absolue, l'habitude s'est ancrée, mais passons. 


Pour commencer, la qualité de la beuh en circulation augmente. Je ne sais pas si cela joue sur les risques pour les schizophrènes, mais je vais gager que non. Cependant, un changement fondamental va s'opérer. Le cannabis va passer d'un tabou dont on ne discute ni en famille, ni en politique à une vérité au grand jour. 


Compare avec l'alcool : tous les français, dès l'école primaire, connaissent l'essentiel des dangers qu'il pose : dépendance, malformations prénatales, possibilités de comportements violents, coma éthyliques, accidents de la route... On parle de ces choses. Tous les parents les connaissent, c'est devenu, grâce à la recherche médicale, grâce aux campagnes de prévention et d'information, une connaissance admise.


Imagine-toi à une soirée avec des amis. Il y a une fille à côté de toi qui vient de te dire qu'elle est enceinte, même si ça se voit pas forcément. Est-ce que tu lui proposes de goûter ta dernière recette de cocktail rhum-soho-coca ? Non, évidemment. Parce que même si t'es encore au lycée et que c'est la première fois de ta vie que tu vois une fille de ton âge enceinte, tu saura que c'est une mauvaise idée.


Pour finir avec le jeune de tout à l'heure : il est à une soirée, ses potes savent qu'il a quelques tendances schizophrènes, avec une bonne information sur les dangers du cannabis, ils ne le laisseront pas faire.


Bien sûr, il faut qu'il soit au courant de son propre statut. Mais tu vois bien que cela se règle par un meilleur dépistage de la schizophrénie et des autres maladies mentales.

Also do you really think it's possible to have 40% cheaper prices and the costs for gas and wear&amp;tear is something every service has to deal with? drivers in some areas are already complaining that the make very little money after the last price cuts.

&gt; Uber's surge pricing kicks in very infrequently, and you're always alerted when it is in effect. 

And that helps me how when I stand at the club at 3AM and want to go home? Can't wait to pay 30€ instead of 15€ every time...



&gt;  So why would a criminal target an Uber driver if he doesn't carry any money?

He probably still has some nice electronics and just because Uber requires not cash doesn't mean the driver does not carry any.",0,1408998577,null,0,false,0,ck09j53,t3_2eimdj,t1_ck09j53,t1_ck00utt,null,1427362524,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

* al-Qaida in Afghanistan gegen die Russen und in Syrien sowie Libyen
* LIFG in Libyen 
* Ansar al-Islam im Irak
* Islamischer Djihad in Syrien
* ISIS/IS in Syrien
* Terêbazên Azadiya Kürdistan – TAK im Irak


Dies sind nur die aktuellsten im Nahen Osten. Von den ganzen Terrororganisationen in Südamerika fang ich gar nicht erst an. Manch einer zählt ja mittlerweile auch den Verfassungsschutz dazu, aber das ist ein anderes Thema.

&gt;und warum? Ist/sind da ein politischer Wille/politische Willen dahinter?
Da kann ich nur spekulieren: Wirtschaftsinteressen, Destabilisierung, Teile &amp; Herrsche Strategie. Es besteht bspw. kein Interesse daran ölproduzierende Länder ihre Rohstoffe in Fremdwährungen handeln zu lassen. Auch sucht man sich stets radikale Muslime, wenn man mal wieder eine Friedensbewegung braucht, die man zum Sieg bomben kann. Oder wenn man sich ein wenig Hilfe bei der Invasion eines Landes wie dem Irak verspricht. Was da alles an kurdische Terrororganisationen gegangen ist ...

&gt;Wieviel davon läuft schwarz und über unkontrollierte Kanäle? 

Auch nur spekulativ: Kontrolliert bedeutet sowas wie der Kongress weiß davon? Ich erzähl dir jetzt mal was schockierendes: Es interessiert von den Geheimdiensten und im Militär keine Sau was Hinz und Kunz da im Kongress machen, ob die sich da für oder gegen Krieg aussprechen, empört tun oder sonst irgendwas. Der Kongress selbst wird bespitzelt wie zuletzt rauskam, die werden bei jedem Hearing angelogen. 

Ist nun also Obama schuld? Natürlich nicht. Auch der ist nur ein Gesicht, ob da nun Bush am Steuer sitzt oder Clinton oder Obama. Stets heißt es Bomben auf andere Länder. Ist das politisch gewollt? Ja. Wird es trotzdem mit Menschenrechten begründet? Ja.

&gt;Wie stark ist die Intransparenz weltweit bei Geheimdiensten u.ä. ausgeprägt?

Woher soll man das denn wissen? Was ist das für eine Frage? Alles was man weiß ist Folgendes: 

Die lügen und betrügen in einer Tour und die Presse druckt diesen Schwachsinn auch noch ab. Glaubst du die geben Listen raus auf denen steht: ""Diesen Monat waren wir zu 50% transparent."" Was für eine dumme Frage. Die leben davon, dass niemand weiß was sie tun. Deshalb heißen die **Geheim**dienste und wenn man sich anschaut was die alles aufgebaut haben(NSA-Skandal) ohne dass eine große Öffentlichkeit etwas davon mitbekam, da kann man da schon von einem hohen Grad an Intransparenz sprechen.

&gt; Welcher Krieg (nicht Plural, sondern Singular bitteschön) wurde denn grundlos anzettelt - und wie war die internationale Reaktion darauf?

Afghanistankrieg. Breite Unterstützung weltweit. Es wurde ein Land angegriffen in dem ein Staatsbürger eines anderen Landes vermutet wurde. Die Afghanen boten die Auslieferung bei klaren Beweisen für dessen Verwicklung in die Anschläge vom 11. September an, das Angebot wurde ausgeschlagen. Das Afghanische Volk hatte nichts damit zu tun. Nichts. Es wurde mit Krieg überzogen. 

&gt;Wie hat Deutschland und andere Teile des Westens auf den Irakkrieg reagiert?

Von Unterstützung bis Ablehnung alles dabei. Frau Merkel flog damals übrigens noch in die USA und versicherte in vorauseilendem Gehorsam die Beteiligung Deutschlands im Falle eines Wahlsieges. Schröder, getrieben von schlechten Umfragewerten(nicht etwa weil er gegen völkerrechtswidrige Kriege war[siehe Kosovo] setzte alles auf eine Karte und kam durch). Massenproteste in der Bevölkerung, inoffiziell durch die Regierung natürlich breite Unterstützung. Unvergessen der BND, welcher Zielkoordinaten lieferte die mehre hundert Zivilisten das Leben gekostet haben. Unvergessen auch, dass so ziemlich alles logistisch über Rammstein lief.
 
&gt;Wieso hat die USA in den zwei Weltkriegen so lange gezögert einzugreifen?

Es wurden Kredite auf beiden Seiten verteilt. Zum einen an die Briten, zum anderen an Deutsche Rüstungsunternehmen. Spricht nur niemand gern drüber. Ging denen wohl darum den Sowjet fern zu halten.

&gt; Wie war nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg die Außenpolitik der BRD im Bezug auf Konflikte?

Nie wieder sollte von deutschem Boden Krieg ausgehen, eben verfassungstreu. Bis in die Ära Kohl hinein, der selbst Familie im Krieg verloren hatte, war dies auch elementarer Bestandteil deutscher Außenpolitik. Es wurde vielleicht das Scheckbuch gezückt, eine Beteiligung deutscher Soldaten an einem illegalen Angriffskrieg wie im Kosovo war aber undenkbar und hätte auch nie unter Kohl stattgefunden. Gleichzeitig war die Bundeswehr eine reine Verteidigungsarmee und hatte deshalb auch so enorme Probleme die Einsätze in allen möglichen Weltregionen zu stemmen.

&gt; Welche friedfertigen Staaten wurden bisher von den USA überfallen?

Honduras
Panama
Dominikanischen Republik
Kuba
Nicaragua
Mexiko
Haiti
Laos
Vietnam
Korea
Bolivien
Kambodscha
Afghanistan
Irak
Lybien
Syrien
Grenada
Jugoslavien
Somalia

Die USA mischen sich ständig in innenpolitische Angelegenheiten anderer Staaten ein, sobald man dort einen Putsch startet bzw. militärisch interveniert um der bevorzugten Partei zum Sieg zu verhelfen ist dies für mich ein Überfall.

&gt; Hast du Zahlen dafür, wie viele Menschen in letzter Zeit durch (islamistische) Diktaturen und Terroristen (Irak-Iran-Krieg, Taliban in Afghanistan, Assad in Syrien, Al Quada im gesamten Nahen Osten und bei 9/11) ins Elend gestürzt wurden?

Dazu wird es keine verlässlichen Zahlen geben, wäre alles hoch spekulativ. Grobe Schätzungen vielleicht, die Zahlen werden sich aber weit unter denen befinden, die durch westliche Militärinterventionen umgekommen sind. Ein Großteil dieser Zahlen fällt sowieso auf die USA zurück, weil diese die Terroristen erst in die Lage versetzen ihrem Treiben nachzugehen. In Syrien gab es vor dem ISIS Terror kaum Opfer muslimischen Terrors. Dank der Unterstützung der ""Friedensbewegung"" ISIS durch die Amerikaner sind tausende umgekommen.

&gt; Wie viele Menschen haben den Interessen ""des Westens"" im Weg gestanden?

Was sollen denn diese völlig bekloppten Suggestivfragen? Kein Mensch kann das beantworten.

&gt; Von welchem Westen reden wir hier? Ist der Westen politisch homogen und oppositionslos?

Beim Westen ist zumeist von der Nato die Rede oder den die USA unterstützenden Mächte inklusive dieser. Natürlich gibt es dort auch Opposition gegen militärische Intervention, siehe Franzosen im Irakkrieg, aber wie auch im deutschen Parlament ist nichts gegen den Willen der Regierenden zu unternehmen. Machen die Franzosen eben nicht mit, gebombt wird trotzdem.

&gt; Inwiefern ist Deutschland USA-hörig? Wie erklärst du dir die Opposition zum amerikanischen völkerrechtswidrigen Irakkrieg?

Was das Volk hier fordert steht ja mitunter diametral dem entgegen, was unsere Regierung veranstaltet. Totalüberwachung? Volk beschwert sich, Regierung mahnt Volk. Beendet dann nicht einmal den Ausbau der Überwachungsstationen, hört nicht einmal den wichtigsten Zeugen geschweige denn bietet ihm Asyl an, leitet keine Ermittlungen ein, verhaftet keine Kollaborateure. Das ist die Definition von hörig. Jemand den man demütigen kann und der trotzdem nach deiner Nase tanzt.

&gt; Wieso ist Deutschland und seine Regierung kriegstreiberisch, weil wir die organisierte und trainierte Kurdenarmee, statt der jesidischen Zivilisten ausrüsten?

Man will hier Waffen in eine Region geben, die von (Bürger)kriegen überzogen ist. Das ist so als wenn ich ein Feuer mit weiterem Brennmaterial versorge. Es geht hier auch nicht darum die Jesiden zu schützen. Keine Sau interessiert sich für die, das sind die üblichen Berichte um ein solches Vorgehen zu rechtfertigen. Was sollen denn die Kurden mit noch mehr Waffen? Den Jesiden geht es trotzdem scheiße. Die sind bereits vertrieben worden und leben in Flüchtlingslagern. Deren Lage ist überhaupt nicht entscheidend dafür, ob man Waffen an irgendwen anders liefern sollte. Es kann der Regierung daher gar nicht um die Unterstützung der Hilfsbedürftigen gehen. Die brauchen keine Waffen, die haben alles verloren. Warum bietet man denen nicht den Flüchtlingsstatus an und holt diese nach Deutschland? Nein, stattdessen sollen die da erstmal in ihren Zelten leben bleiben und jemand anderes bekommt Waffen. Diese Logik ist absurd.

I see middle-class white families get houses that they have to hire help for while not having any savings. I've also seen fairly rich white folks go on hunting trips and having to ""scrape"" the money for it after going there.

The thing is, there are different strategies for shopping for food when you're poor and rich. When you're poor, your major concern is getting enough food for the week, and not having anything spoil. It's pretty heartbreaking to have to toss something like fruit/veggies when you could've bought another days worth of food with the money you paid for it. On the other hand, when you're rich, you don't care if something costs 5 or 0.5. You don't care if you toss 1 or 5 of an item. I've been in both situations and the difference is staggering.

Also, did you know that isn't how the economy works. IF the ecomomy is growing faster than the rate of population growth, the wealth per person increases. That is the situation the UK is in now that it has moved out of recession (a recession that Japan also enjoyed by the way).

The Japanese economy is only marginally bigger than it was in the early 90s and spent most of the itnervening period well below that. The UK economy is significantly larger than it was in the 90's (talking double the size) and is now past its peak from 2008. It has hardly spent any time below peak in comparison. 

Average Wages are higher in the UK. 

Government debt is lower in the UK.

If you are still willing to come by yourself you could just e-mail some universities here in Spain. I know that at least UPM (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid) for some careers provides some courses in english so exchange students can take them, though they are usually for the second year, not the first.

Since you also want to study math/engineering degrees I guess it will be easier to understand than, say a history class, since numbers are always numbers.

TL;DR: search for a college in USA that has a student exchange program with Spain, or start e-mailing universities in Spain to inform yourself about the possibilities.

Aus welchen Glaskugeln informierst du dich eigentlich? Und wieso nimmst du für die Kurden die bestmögliche, für den Islamischen Staat aber die schlechtmöglichste Zukunftsprognose an? 

Was hälst du denn davon: Die Kurden feiern dank der Waffenlieferungen große Erfolge und machen Fortschritte auf dem Weg zum eigenen Staat. Irgendwann fällt denen auf, dass auch Teile des Natopartners Türkei gut dazu passen würden, schließlich ist das ja historisch Kurdistan. Es kommt wieder zu Terror und bürgerkriegsähnlichen Zuständen in den kurdischen Gebieten der Türkei, diesmal steht denen aber eine islamischer Fundamentalist namens Erdogan gegenüber, der zudem noch die ISIS Terroristen in Syrien und im Irak unterstützte. Na, wenn das nicht die besten Zutaten für ein Desaster sind ...

Auf der anderen Seite bekommt die Welt einfach nur ein 2tes Saudi Arabien. Damit kann man doch leben, oder?

Deine Wahrnehmung ist völlig verzehrt. Die Geschichte lehrt uns, dass Waffenlieferungen noch nie etwas gebracht haben außer noch mehr Elend. Als ob es so einfach wäre. Ich erinnere mich auch noch an die Presse vor dem Irakfeldzug. In 4 Wochen kann der Krieg beendet, die Iraker frei, die Menschen glücklich sein. 10 Jahre und mehrere hundertausend Tote später. 

Ist das Zynismus auf deiner Seite oder glaubst du wirklich an den Quatsch den unsere inkompetente Presse zu jedem Konflikt von sich gibt?

&gt;Oder wäre für dich eine massive Intervention durch UN Truppen die beste Lösung?

Nein. Weder die UN noch irgendwer sonst hat sich da anders als politisch einzumischen.

&gt; Inwiefern gelingt die Gehirnwäsche der Schafels von historischen Non-Interventionalisten[1] /Isolationisten hin zu Kriegstreibern? Wie weit ist sie vorangeschritten? (vllt findest du da ja Umfragen dazu)

Natürlich finde ich keine Umfragen dazu, weil das eine weitere sinnlose Frage ist die keine definitive Antwort kennt und nur zum spekulativen Schwafeln einlädt.

&gt; Wen haben wir in Syrien unterstützt? ISIS oder FSA?

Der ganze terroristische Aufstand hätte nie ohne die Truppen der ISIS Traktion bekommen und wäre von der syrischen Armee im Keim erstickt worden. Die FSA ist das Label welches man erfand um der Weltöffentlichkeit zu erzählen, dass es gute Terroristen gibt. Die FSA ist so etwas wie der DGB, ein Dachverband in dem sich alle Terrororganisationen in Syrien gesammelt haben, ob es Al Nusra, Al Quaeda, ISIS oder irgendwelche Überläufer der Assadtruppen waren. Dass ISIS sich dann irgendwann entschied zu moderate Gruppen aus der FSA auszuschließen, spricht Bände über die Machtverhältnisse dort. Letztendlich blieb von dem Terroraufstand in Syrien nur die ISIS übrig. Der Rest verschwand in der Bedeutungslosigkeit. Dazu vielleicht auch mal im Syrian Civil War subreddit lesen. Da schreiben Betroffene über das praktische Verschwinden der FSA, weil nur noch ISIS übrig blieb.

&gt;Welche Optionen hätten eine ""Bombemkampagne"" der FSA gebracht? 

Nochmal, die FSA ist zum größten Teil ISIS. Eine Bombenkampagne hätte ISIS zur Machtergreifung verholfen und die hätten dann die staatlichen Strukturen genutzt um Syrien in den jetzt etablierten Islamischen Staat zu verwandeln.

&gt;Hätte durch die internationale Gemeinschaft ein ""Zweifrontenkrieg"" gegen Assad und ISIS ermöglicht werden können?

Das ist pures Wunschdenken und Spekulation. Dazu eine Gegenthese: Die paar Moderaten wären direkt nach der Machtergreifung durch ISIS hingerichtet worden und ISIS hätte sich bedankt und wäre wie oben beschrieben verfahren.

&gt; Wieso ziehen die Amerikaner aus dem Irak und Afghanistan ab? 

Sie rücken ja gerade wieder im Irak ein. Auch Afghanistan wird alles andere als verlassen. Was dort an privaten Sicherheitsfirmen unter Kontrolle des Pentagon verbleibt, übertrifft in Größe und Struktur die meisten westeuropäischen Armeen. 

&gt;Ist Besserung der Kriegstreiberei in Sicht, oder bieten sich andere Erklärungsmuster für die verkorkste Situation in Nahost an?

Nein. So lange der Krieg gegen den Terror nicht beendet wird, kann es keinen Frieden geben. Er ist die ultimative Rechtfertigung für alle Gräueltaten die der Westen begehen kann, von Drohnenangriffen bis zu Foltergefängnissen. Zum Nahen Osten, der muslimischen Welt im Allgemeinen bleibt zu sagen, dass der Interventionalismus der Kolonialmächte, der UN und später der US die Länder dort erst in diese missliche politische Lage gebracht haben. Der Iran war mal eines der fortschrittlichsten Länder der Region, bis sich die Briten und Amerikaner wieder einmischten. Der Irak war einst Vorbildstaat im Nahen Osten, reich und progressiv, bevor die Amerikaner ihn zum Einmasch in den Iran brachten. Libyen war ein Musterbeispiel einer aufstrebenden Nation mit großen Ambitionen wie der Gründung einer Afrikanischen Union um die Ausbeutung des Kontinents durch Dritte zu stoppen, bevor die Amerikaner auch dort eine muslimische Friedensbewegung auftrieben und das Land in einen Bürgerkrieg stürzten.",0,1408999250,null,0,false,0,ck09wh1,t3_2eizi0,t1_ck09wh1,t1_ck035fa,null,1427362351,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

And I do not in any way believe poverty is primarily due to laziness even if it plays a role (doubtful though since IMO many poor people work much longer hours than me), but it is important to keep in mind that the poor oftentimes have different priorities from the middle and upper classes and sometimes these seem irrational and irresponsible. Many times unfortunately these skewed priorities lead to even more poverty and trap people in an endless cycle of despair. 

Here in the UK it is striking to see how quickly some poor immigrant communities become middle/upper class compared to others because they place a comparatively low value or material goods and instead value things like education far more than even the average wealthy Britons.

&gt; since it's the same app everywhere in the world

For now. Local markets are different and a local company could come up with a service that fits better and becomes more dominant. Germany already has very popular taxi apps, if this unrgulated driving becomes legal nothing stops them from implementing a payment system etc.

&gt; Roaming charges + Uber is still less expensive than using a shitty traditional taxi that will rip you off more likely than not.

Yes, but not every country has shitty taxis. Also if you don't care about roaming then just look up the route before on google maps.

&gt; Wtf? This makes no sense, and is horribly inefficient.

I have the number of some taxi drivers saved and already do it, although he still uses the meter. Friends of mine do it, too. The main citiy centre of my city is pretty small so from main the popular taxi waiting positions it would take the driver 3-5min to get to me. If I'm in a bar I could also just give a call and ask how it looks in the next 30min. Not to mention that there are other apps that can show the location and people could start using that. Also hotels etc. could have their prefered drivers and even make deals with them, like fixed rates to the airport/trainstation/city centre.

If it were like the UK, where civil partnerships did bestow exactly the same rights as marriage, then I'd possible say that gay marriage did exist except in name but, as diference do exist, I don't think anyone should say that. 

In any case, the whole idea of 'separate but equal' is bullshit. It doesn't work in practice. It leads to resentment and it warps people's views on those with the 'lesser' status. There are multiple examples of gay marriage not causing the world to collapse so there really is no reason why the stupid half-way house of Civil Partnership should continue to exist.

As for vocabulary, it's very hard to memorize vocabulary that quickly, but obviously it's necessary. I would say make your own vocab lists, don't just assign the textbook lists. My prof would tell us to memorize the vocab on 2 pages(~100 words, or more) for a test, but really we only needed maybe 25 or 50.

1) Professori più preparati. Al momento, va a culo. Per esempio, io dal mio professore di elettronica a momenti non ho imparato neanche la legge di ohm.

2) Più spazio all'inglese, è una materia molto importante e due/tre ore alla settimana non bastano a fare niente.

3) Mi piacerebbe vedere più materie scientifiche e meno umanistiche, ma questa è solo una mia preferenza.

4) Via la religione, materia assolutamente inutile.

5) Più attività extrascolastiche, magari anche opzionali.

6) Una migliore preparazione verso il mondo universitario/del lavoro (parlando delle superiori). Adesso ti danno una pacca sulla spalla e ti dicono ""buona fortuna"".

7) Corsi di aggiornamento obbligatori per tutti, **specialmente** per le materie in sviluppo come informatica e simili. Per esempio, la mia professoressa di informatica sapeva Pascal e VB6 (e neanche troppo bene). Nulla contro il Pascal, ma mi piacerebbe venisse insegnato qualcosa di più ""vivo"".

8) Utilizzo delle nuove tecnologie nell'insegnamento, con relativo corso obbligatorio per i professori. Per fare un esempio di cosa fatta a cazzo: sempre nella stessa scuola hanno dato tablet &amp; portatili agli studenti di prima e seconda. Non sono **mai** stati usati dagli studenti per la scuola. Hanno anche installato alcune lavagne multimediali, con successive lamentele da parte della maggior parte dei professori perché non potevano più usare i gessetti e le lavagne tanto rimanevano spente.

9) Più soldi alle scuole, e più controlli sulla gestione dei suddetti soldi.

10) Una bella lavata di capo a tanti studenti e tanti genitori. Sono il primo ad ammettere che ero (e sono) una testa di cazzo, ma ho visto certi comportamenti...

11) Classi con meno studenti, direi al massimo intorno ai 20/15.

12) Meno imparare a memoria. Più imparare come applicare le nozioni. Sono dell'idea che l'importante sia sapere come applicare le funzioni, non saperle a memoria.

hey buckaroo!  just because you haven't heard of them, doesn't mean they don't exist.  the basic concept underlying the truth of this statement may help you get along a little better in life if you examine it more closely.  your opening statement was shockingly stupid: it posits you squarely in the 'earth is flat, there are no viruses because i can't see them, the sun revolves around the earth"" camp.

according to customary international law, the state as an international person must include a  permanent population, a defined, recognised territory with recognised borders, a government and the ability to enter into relations with other states as international persons.    further it must not have used violence to gain the recognition of sovereignty.

there is play though between this constitutive definition of statehood, used by virtually every nation, the un, and international, and the self-declarative right of a state, its political existence being independent of recognition of by other states.  

and therein lies the space in which uk can act to restrict the return of uk nationals who are in fact jihadists.  as switzerland so admirably put it: 

""""Neither a political unit needs to be recognized to become a state, nor does a state have the obligation to recognize another one. At the same time, neither recognition is enough to create a state, nor does its absence abolish it.""

In das Stadion passen 75.000 (fünfundsiebzigtausend) Zuschauer und heutzutage ist es Heimat für Hertha BSC Berlin. Jedes Jahr wird das deutsche Pokalfinale im Olympiastadion gehalten.  
  

Das Stadion wurde vom Architekten Werner March konstruiert. Es ist vom riesigen Olympiagelände umgeben. Das Stadion kam fast unversehrt durch den zweiten Weltkrieg und wurde bis 1994 (Neunzehnvierundneunzig) als Zentrale des britischen Heeres eingesetzt.  


Das Stadion besteht aus 70.000 (siebzigtausend) Kubikmetern Beton und 20.000 (Zwanzigtausend) Kubikmetern Betonelementen. Das Dach über dem Stadion umfasst eine Gesamtfläche von 37.000 (Siebenunddreißigtausend) Quadratmetern und wiegt 3.500 (Dreitausendfünfhundert) Tonnen.  



Als die Nazis 1933 (Neunzehndreiunddreißig) an die Macht kamen, entschieden sie sich dazu die Olympischen Spiele für Propaganda zu nutzen und Hitler verlangte einen Reichsportplatz mit einem neuen Stadion.  


Als der Sportplatz 1936 (Neunzehnsechsunddreißig) fertiggestellt wurde, bedeckte er 1,32 (Eins komma drei zwei) Quadrat-Meilen, mit einem Stadion, einem Amphitheater und 150 (einhundertundfünfzig) Gebäude für Schwimmen, Hockey und weiteres. Das Stadion hatte 110.000 (Einhundertundzehntausend) Sitzplätze für das Publikum. Auf dem Rasen ”Maifeld”  gibt es Raum für 250.000 (Zweihundertundfünfzigtausend) Zuschauer.  

Das Stadion wurde am 1. August (ersten) 1936 (Neunzehnsechsunddreißig) von Adolf Hitler offiziell eingeweiht und das olympische Feuer wurde von dem Athleten Fritz Schilen entzündet.

Until B1 you might be fine with the Assimil-German with Ease course (only get it with the audio or it is useless) and then create your own memrise course based on that course. Your brain seeks sense and context. Random vocabulary that isn't used pretty much right away will be forgotten more quickly. Rather create levels with ~25 words only than one big level with too many words.

I personally would stay away from DL or any other software as you are learning German for a professional purpose and not just for leisure. I have started a rather vivid discussion about this topic [here](https://smartergerman.com/duolingo-learn-german/) and [here](https://smartergerman.com/duolingo-review-discussion/).
  
Rather spend your free minutes creating or learning vocab with memrise.

true,A_Nest_Of_Nope,veneto,,"&gt; Penso che per alcune materie, come quelle scientifiche, ci debba essere un coinvolgimento molto maggiore degli studenti, che vanno abituati ad essere responsabilizzati.

Il concetto di meno studenti per classe è preso dal sistema scolastico in Nuova Zelanda, lì lo studente viene seguito e valutato sin dall'asilo, ogni bambino mentre gioca, parla, legge e interagisce viene valutato in base a dei punteggi ottenuti. Tutti i bambini in una fascia di punteggio vengono messi insieme, lo stesso per tutte le altre fasce di punteggio.

Questo sistema mette i bambini in aule con altri elementi che hanno circa la stessa capacità di apprendimento ed interazione, in questo modo non ci sono più differenze come nella scuola italiana dove in un aula, nella materia di matematica, ci sono 4 studenti con la media dell'8, 10 con la media del 6 e altri 7 con la media del 4.

Questo non vuol dire che tutti i bimbi con una fascia di punteggio bassa sono dei ritardati che faranno una vita da pezzenti, anzi. Significa che apprenderanno nello stesso modo dei loro compagni di classe e alla fine capiranno i concetti come gli studenti che hanno ottenuto punteggi di fascia più alta.

In questo modo nelle scuole superiori e all'università non ci saranno più le differenze di voti enormi che si vedono in Italia, e allo stesso tempo questo impedirà la nascita di situazioni ostili nelle classi, come quando i tuoi compagni ti prendono per il culo 24/7 perché prendi 4 e loro 7, impedendo quindi che lo studente si demoralizzi o si senta inferiore agli altri.

Edit: Nelle scuole in Nuova Zelanda le classi delle elementari sono al massimo da 6 studenti se non ricordo male.

true,ZeMilkman,GERM,Germany,"No, I'm saying I'm not a fan of violent executions such as beheading or hanging or even a lethal injection, all of which cause emotional distress. If the death of a person is decided that death should come swiftly and without prolonging the subjects suffering.

Imprisoning people is a different thing and I think it should be reserved for repeat offenders of non-violent, yet damaging crimes such as theft. I believe any crime involving someone inflicting severe bodily injury to another innocent party should be met with euthanization.

I believe torture is a questionable yet sometimes justified means to an end. If a child abductor is caught and they won't give up details on the location of their victim I would be fully in support of using violence to gather the necessary information. If a terrorist is caught and tortured to gather information which are immediately relevant to the safety of innocent people I won't blame the people responsible for said torture.

The job of the government should be to protect the innocent and remove threats and when someone is corrupted to the point of murdering, raping, battering people I don't think we should take any chances.

I couldn't help it. 

Realistically, in most former communist countries, whoever you chose is still going to a member of the ""old guard"", most likely someone who was fairly ""up and coming"" during those regimes who probably answers to someone who was somewhat ""in power"" back then. Democracy still seems like a fairly lofty ideal over here.

Say the Ukrainians stand up to Russia by themselves,suffer heavy losses, and manage to drive them off. What's to stop Russia from picking another target? Is that target willing to put up a fight too? Why wouldn't we show an united front to deter Russia?

Ehm ... yes ... but I wouldn't use _that_ example to counter my comment. They did declare war but http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoney_War didn't act on it and when they finally did it was too late for Poland. 

&gt; Besides today Estonia is a part of a military alliance.

&gt; Which is way more solid than whatever the Poles and the west had.

Yes, the current alliance probably is really more solid. But how long would Estonia hold out in such a case? When NATO forces arrive Talinn probably will be already occupied.

true,bobdole3-2,UNSA,United States of America,"As it stands, not really. The EU has a lot of people and money, but it's completely fragmented. There's very little sense of shared community. Nationalism might not be as apparent as it is in the US, but just about everyone considers themselves part of their country before their continent. The fact that there are 28 states with unique agendas hamstrings any potential power that the EU could wield.

Worse still, the need to form a single, united power is continuously decreasing. The richer states don't want their economies dragged down by the weaker states, and the weaker states are able to get their security guaranteed by NATO (or rather, America), not the other parts of Europe.  Consolidating power at the European level might be good for dick measuring, but what does it actually accomplish? There's no one left to fight. The number of countries which could even conceivably fight a European state right now can be counted on one hand, and they all have nuclear weapons anyway. Right now, any event that could ""awaken the war machine"" would just be taken care of by the US, so there's not much opportunity for a spark at all.

In order to ever actually become a superpower, a few major shifts in the global order would need to happen. The EU would need to consolidate power at the top level, and reduce the power of individual states. There would need to be a pretty big souring of relations between Europe and the US to provide the impetus to beef up the need for power.  We would also need to find a way to circumvent MAD, because as long as it's in place, there's limited utility to having more power than the minimum you need to defend yourself. Finally, people would need to start dropping their old national identities and pick up a new European one. 

TL;DR The EU of today isn't all that different from the US under the Articles of Confederation. Too divided and contradictory to become a superpower. The EU would need to be revamped from the ground up to truly be strong, but as it stands there's not really any purpose for it.

Probabilmente, vogliono permettere ai professori di poter variare il proprio programma, in modo che abbiano ampia scelta su che testi svolgere. Oppure, sono così grandi per permettere agli studenti di poter approfondire gli argomenti.

It's the usual problem with european foreign policy... we don't realy have a european one. (I wish we would, but that's it.) We need a foreign policy on a european level, rooting in the parliament (as the most democratic legitimated institution, that we currently have.)

My opinion on this whole mess isn't explained in a few short sentences.

I believe that the people in a region have the right to decide how they want to be governed and by whom this should be done. Given there would be transparent information and discussion about this, followed by a true democratic election, they should have the right to seperate and/or join russia if they vote for it.

In the current events there seems to be a lot of propaganda (most likely on both sides - not to the same extend though). Russia (or at least a lot of russians) are supporting rebel forces in a sovereign country. 
A violent seperation, should always be the last possible action, only legitimate after peacefull and democratic ones (mentiones above) have failed due to continious oppression. 

It's a pity the new president couldn't be elected in the eastern territories, because that would have strenghten his legitimation.
I strongly support the idea of having a more decentralized Ukraine. (I'm gernerally in favor of decentralization.)

I just hope this conflict will end soon, without causing many more casualties. But I don't see this happen at the moment.

Should we send troops there, to help the Ukrainians? No - not under the current circumstances. That would only cause russia to send more ""volunteers"". We also lack a good legitimation to do so. This is not about the EU or the NATO (yet). If there would be some kind of ""peace mission"" by the UN, things would be different of course. 

Should we send weapons or military goods? Well, Germany already exports way to much weapons to many countries it shouldn't. (Because of human rights violations or a lack of democracy in those countries.)
We currently have a huge discussion about sending weapons to the kurds. Basically sending weapons to a area of crisis might not be a good idea at all. But then allowing ISIS to conquer more territory and tyranize the people isn't either. 
Back to the topic: I doubt the Ukrainian army lacks weaponry at this point. It's more about the continuous uprgades and resupplies of the seperatist, that it keeping this conflict alive.
I think we should focus on humanitarian aid here.

Should we allow russia to further destabilize the region? Hell no. Increase the sanctions until we're back in soviet times.

Will that hurt us? Sure it would. But we can't allow economic concerns to be more important than our ideals about human rights and democracy. We musn't allow the bully to oppress the whole schoolyard.

Now I'm tired... and this is full of mistakes ... and I'm not done here yet. I'll eat something and answer comments later.

Deterioration will occur as and when Putin pulls off more bad shit. He'll pull of more bad shit when he thinks he'll get away with it. He'll get away with it when everybody else hasn't already decided what the response will be.

In short what needs to happen is that the west needs to decide what the next wave of sanctions are and lay down the conditions so that Putin knows we will have no choice but to impose them.

If the territorial integrity of the Ukraine had been backed by a pact which obligated the EU to intervene militarily then Putin would not have annexed Crimea.

He knows what he's doing and he's no fool. He knows the EU/NATO will not push forward with an attack and will only act reactively, so all he needs to do is one step at a time until we get unified.

The problem is the overwhelming majority of the immigrants in question (African and Middle Eastern people) are not net taxpayers and will not in any way help in this regard. They actually use far more government spending than they ever contribute for multiple generations, meaning they put *more* strain on the governments in question rather than support it as new taxpayers.

It isn't the same case as in North America where immigrants are some of the best-educated, highest-income, and least government-dependent people in the country. But of course, in North America the governments are able to choose which African and Asian immigrants they accept, which means they tend to allow the local ""elites"" to immigrate and the end result boosts the tax base. Plus, those countries have virtually no social safety net so they don't have nearly as many costs associated with poorer immigrants from Mexico and central America.

The only way to achieve what you want is to also take advantage of brain drain in the developing world and invite the best and brightest in India, China, Nigeria, etc. to move to Europe, but this ignores the fact that hundreds of thousands simply come here illegally from extremely violent societies with no education, no money, and no prospects whatsoever and we're stuck with them.

&gt;The __M163 Vulcan Air Defense System__ (__VADS__) is a [self-propelled anti-aircraft gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-propelled_anti-aircraft_gun) (SPAAG) that was used by the [United States Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army). The M168 gun is a variant of the [General Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics) 20 mm [M61 Vulcan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M61_Vulcan) rotary cannon, the standard cannon in most U.S. combat aircraft since the 1960s, mounted on either an armored vehicle or a trailer.

Now that Russia struck back, they felt it and they're desperately trying to sell their apples to the US or asking the EU for support. I think decisions like these deserve to be mocked. The same thing applies to the EU. The US doesn't have much to lose when sanctioning Russia, but the EU does.

If they insist on going to France, Germany, England, Sweden, etc., they are no longer just seeking asylum. Instead they're now economic migrants looking to improve their lives in a richer society.

Regardless, the idea that they will be taxpayers is unworkable no matter what we try. It cannot happen in a generation and based on our experiences so far, not even in two.

isis therefore will never have the borders they claim.  they will never have the native population who will remain syrian and iraqi, etc. 

so, no, they haven't met those criteria, and certainly no nations will have relations with the so-called isis state.  thus in fact, it can be truly said that they will never meet the criteria for recognition.

so look at it this way: uk is not recognising isis.  the uk's terms for recognising a state would be the constitutive one, with its 4 criteria.  isis's terms would be the self-declarative.  (if they even were to take it so far as to think legally)  the british jihadi is situated somewhere in between.  in joining the isis jihad, he joins isis which has declared itself a state.  he must therefore support the notion of the caliphate as a legitimate state since this is the basis for isis' claim of statehood and he is fighting for its establishment.  so the jihadi has recognised that he himself has another state, one which he thinks is superior to his old state which he is now waging war on.  which right there, in a lot of legal minds, is a DYI revocation of citzenship.

you and i may see very clearly that the 19 year old, who feels there is no hope, no prospects for him, who is mired in a dead end job, who is angry and full of youthful testosterone, and fed the rants of an extremist iman,  isn't giving great thought to his own notions of what constitutes statehood when he does what he does.  but the fact still remains that he did it.  

that's an argument that going to get made.  maybe not publicly, but yes, somewhere in the corridors of whitehall.

the thing about violence is so that puppet regimes cannot be established that are controlled from some other point, and it doesn't apply neccessarily to revolution.  (and of course, the difference is the usa won ;) )

also the 'montevideo convention'  there's probably things of interest to be found in the un charter and other documents.  the montevideo convention is in regards to statehood in the pan american states, but it restated customary international law rather well so its language has been pretty much adopted throughout the world.

It was written by Maria Konopnicka as a protest to the germanization in Prussian partition of Poland. So it was meaningful only to those people who lived there (the others were Russian and Austro-Hungary partition, of which the third was actually pretty civilized when it comes to the treatment of Poles, as they were not treated with disrespect and differently than any other national minorities inside the empire).

As the movements to free and reunify Polish partitions were born, there was a need for an anthem that would be universally understandable and possible to relate for all these groups of Poles, who were very different after 123 years of partition. Mazurek Dąbrowskiego just makes more sense, since it's about returning to the homeland, preparing to fight for independence, militarily and politically. While Rota is about preserving the Polish culture and identity against state that actively wanted to destroy it.

Nevertheless Rota was assumed as an anthem by some Polish political parties, including existing ones (Polish People's Faction f.i.), and by some Polish diasporas (f.i. in Lithuania, but very shortly). During the last years of communism in Poland it was even rewritten as anti-soviet song.

Personally I love it. It is somewhere deep inside me, and I always hear it, when learning about horrible things that were happening to some of my compatriots. But I wouldn't want it to be our anthem. First of all it'd be awkward to host anyone from Germany :D But secondly, I don't think it should be brought up casually. I like to hear it from time to time, being sung as an artistic performance, but I hate when people do it on the streets or inside churches.

Russia is currently invading and has already annexed part of the sovereign country of Ukraine. This is an unprecedented international ""crime"" and failure to respond with sufficient power will forever shift the balance of power between Europe and Moscow.

With that said, German policy needs to be two things: 

* 1) Consistent
* 2) Unambiguous

Merkel should **unambiguously** denounce the aggression in Ukraine, and make it clear that there will not be a return to ""business as usual"" until the Russians withdraw from the border and stop supplying aid across the border. She needs to stop having her cake (denouncing) and eat it too (continuing to support private trade deals between Germany and Russia). 

True, it is going to hurt the economy, but once you start you need to stay **consistent.** By tempering earlier statements, going back on certain agreements, showing a lack of resolve, and second-guessing the impacts of sanctions, Merkel decreases the credibility of the current action, and also ruins the ability to react ""tougher"" in the future. No matter what the course of action was, changing it only weakens the outcome and strengthens Putin's hand. 

These two things would strengthen Europe's stance against Russia, help give other countries a strong leadership figure to rally behind, and prevent further deterioration in EU-Russian relations because it shows that negotiations will not happen until Russia gives up their ambitions in Ukraine. Russia is going to bleed dry first, and the definitely need someone to sell energy to (the Chinese have been taking advantage of the situation to lock in deep discounts), so time is on Germany's side. By changing or redefining their stance though, Germany is undermining the entire European response to Russia.

This is the game theory solution to the problem, but it also makes a lot of practical sense. You don't even need to have chosen the perfect policy (maybe we just need Russia to leave the border, not stop arming the rebels) but you NEED to have credible enforcement for it to work. Germany seems to be losing credibility fast.

Tu me nomme premier ministre, je te retrouve les 4 ou 5% de croissance ""sans problèmes"" (j'exagère un peu), et en 2050 la France sera toujours 5ème économie mondiale.

Ah, bien sur pour cela il faudra faire quelques petites réformes... Flexibiliser complètement le marché du travail, rendre indépendantes les universités pour qu'elles puissent sélectionner leurs étudiants et former des cadres de l'industrie plutôt que des sociologues du sport, réduire drastiquement les impôts sur le travail et le capital (et pour cela amputer très largement les prestations sociales), autoriser l'exploitation du gaz de schistes et des OGM, libéraliser le régime de retraites pour permettre l'épargne -volontaire- dans les entreprises françaises, supprimer la taxe sur les transactions financières, etc.

I'm not saying it was able to do that. I'm only saying that if this trend would continue it could end with Russia dictating prices. It is a forced decision now, to diversify, but it's a positive necessity. And as our saying goes, Poles work best with a knife next to their throat.

&gt; What I'm mocking here is that despite knowing that Poland is dependant on Russia for some of its exports, they went ahead and supported the EU-US sanctions against Russia, acting like Russia is powerless because Poland's allied with the EU and US and nothing can hurt them.

It's not like that. I told you we are accustomed to Russian embargoes, so do you think we didn't know that some will follow our position in EU on the matter? I can't speak on behalf of whole Poland, but Poles I know are pretty idealistic, comparatively to the rest of the world.

You can call it impractical - and you will be right - you can call it insensible - and you will be right - you can call it hopelessly romantic - and you will be right - but that's what the majority of us is.

I think our department does a decent job at structuring the first semesters of German.  It's by no means perfect, but they tried to strike a challenging balance:

The students are exposed to many grammatical concepts at a quicker rate than Romance or Scandinavian languages here.  It's a sort of adventure in 'drinking from the firehose.'  It's not easy, but it's a difficult language.  At least that goes the argument.  To compensate for it being difficult, there's a higher tolerance for failure.  Just a handful of section exams, each worth 3% of your final grade.  Meaning, you can absolutely bomb tests and still be relatively okay grade wise.  More emphasis is placed on daily assignments, participation, projects, all things that tend to get full credit as long as you do them.  So if you do all the assignments and show up everyday, you shouldn't bomb the tests, but in case you do, it's not the end of the world.  Some people have complained that that lowers the expectations of learning the language, but I'm not sure it does.  Who knows.  Either way, unfortunately, I have next to no control how fast grammar gets introduced.  It's a department thing.

Vocab definitely requires some creative solutions, I think.  I had to memorize pages of vocal too.  It was a pain, but I did it, until after the test, then I forgot it.

For this reason I disagree with any and all sanctions leveed against Russia, I find it far more valuable for us to do well than for Russia to do poorly. Schadenfreude won't pay the (extremely inflated) water bills.

The biggest thing Germany has to start working towards now is energy independence. There's a big focus on renewables like solar and that's commendable, but it still relies heavily on state subsidy. Fracking is a terrible idea as evidenced by what's happening in the US, we should avoid it at all costs. With this in mind there's no alternative but Germany going nuclear against the wishes of a misinformed environmentalist lobby. Germany isn't near a fault line, it doesn't have an ocean coastline vulnerable to tsunamis, there's no natural threat to putting NPPs in the area. I think that's the biggest thing Germany should take out of this whole situation, nuclear is the future.

In the short term while its still reliant on Russian gas Germany should distance itself from relying on Ukraine as a middleman since that country experiences a revolution every 10 years nowadays and is far too unstable. Use the North Stream at full capacity, do what you can to get South Stream completed.

Contrary to the popular belief on this sub I really don't think it's Putin's end-game to recreate the USSR through conquest, Crimea was a special case due to its military value along with the demographic makeup which I don't see extending to the rest of Ukraine or the Baltics. For this reason I don't think his motivation with supporting the DNR rebels is territorial annexation, likely it's just a bargaining chip (either to get to keep Crimea, BRICS stuff or over geo-politics in the middle-east). As such I'm sure Germany can trade with him over the situation in Ukraine. At worst if he's insistent on keeping the pressure on Kiev then try to score some trade privileges (gas discounts or the like, I'm not an economist I don't know) in exchange for agreeing to federalise the country. I'd personally be happy with whatever outcome will minimise civilian casualties at this point. Obviously military confrontation is out of the question, that never ends well. Also, Crimea's gone, no need to turn this into another Cyprus with people living in legal limbo, I have seen no evidence to suggest that the majority of the population there is unhappy with being part of Russia.

I do think further European Integration would help though. An unified defense and foreign policy, in my opinion, is key to show that Russia can't just fuck around with Europe and get away with it. 

Sure, the German economy would suffer a bit from bad relations with Russia, but you know what? It will suffer even more if we fuck over our allies and neighbours (and I btw think that we have some sort of obligation to side with European countries over anyone else, y'know, solidarity and shit). The current sanctions are a joke and if Merkel actually gave a fuck about everything between Warsaw and Moscow ( because I definitely do), the sanctions would be much harsher. I appreciate that we don't advocate a military solution to the whole crisis, but a clear line has to be drawn at some point. If Putin isn't supposed to lose face, then maybe he should not invade and annex sovereign countries.

Ukraine needs help. Ukrainians have shown that they want to be European, this is what started this whole mess. Stabilisation of the eastern part of the country takes top priority. You know that military deal Germany had with Russia about a training base that got called of after MH17? Yeah, we should offer that deal to Ukraine, with a discount of course. Other than that, the usual kind of help, like, monetary or humanitarian aid should go towars Ukraine asap.

I also think this is the perfect moment to reduce dependency on Russian gas, whether its the expansion of the green-energy sector, finding other countries that would sell gas to us or the diversification of source-countries. And if Putin will be mad about us not buying his filthy gas anymore, well, then go fuck yourself, Vlad.

And furthermore, we can't completely alienate Russia. The whole point of the European project isn't to make a larger European state which essentially does all the same things states did in the past, but bigger. Its point is to ensure peace and co-operation amongst European nations and the World in general. We're not gonna be able to achieve that if we turn it into a biggest dick competition. We need a co-operative Russia we can work with willingly, rather than one which will cut our throats the first chance it gets. The solution to this is not military, it's political. Yeah, that sounds crazy given what we have now, but we need to leave ourselves open to Russia calming down and getting back on the negotiating tables. 

We have to both not alienate Russia and aid in the development of a more fracture world, that's what we learned in World War One, but we also have to not appease Russia, that's the lesson we learned from World War Two. Those two lessons may seem contradictory, but there's a fine line which we can easily walk down. Your suggestions are far too much in the wrong direction. It's the centenary of World War One.

Sure, some Germans are dickheads, but there are dickheads in every corner of this beautiful Earth. I'm sure most Germans, along with many others throughout Europe have realized that while different, there's really no escuse for everyone not to function in a friendly social manner. If we are governed properly, that is.

I really think many Germans were disappointed because they wished the Russians would eventually join the big European family, but they can distinguish Putin and Russia. And with the current regime it's going to be hard to get along. 

That said, i think you're on to something there. The perception of Germany may be the one you mention in the US and northern Europe, but many in Europe regard it's actions in the crisis as somewhat dictatorial and with a hint of punishment. And this is only possible due to the imbalance in the size/productivity of different member states.

With that in mind, maybe a fragmentation of Europe, while maintaining a union, would make it more democratic. I've read a while ago about some German states playing with the thought of becoming more autonomous, maybe a German can clarify if this is something plausible. 

In any case, elsewhere in Europe independence movements are resurging (Scotland and Catalunya are the most mediatic), which interestingly enough manifest interest in staying within the EU. 

From my perspective, the way things are going EU policy will be dictated by 2-3 countries at best, which will not end well. 

As for Germany and Russia right now, maybe the Germans should take the hard road and prepare to lose some of it's reserves this winter, while working on reactivating their nuclear reactors. Honestly, ditching nuclear when they did was the worse possible decision. If only Portugal had invested in its own nuclear energy program in the days of Salazar we wouldn't be in this ditch right now.

Another direction to go in is with the poetry-- so for example I have a The Penguin Book of German Verse which covers from way-back undated epic poetry to about the 1950s/60s. Comes with english translations beneath german text.

1. Any potential war between nuclear powers would be a limited, quick &amp; decisive war so as to avoid escalation *(which can very possibly happen anyway)* for the very reason you just mentioned. So that requires a advanced military that has proficient power projection capabilities and can respond to a regional crisis quickly. Crimea is the perfect example of this. You go in, win a few short battles/actions, occupy and than threaten nuclear war to whoever tries to dislodge you once you set-up camp &amp; secured your position. Those few short battles/action will probably be what determines future wars in my opinion. 

2. It shows solidarity &amp; commitment to Germany's Eastern European EU/NATO allies. Even if it's only symbolic, it's very important. It also aides with building a strong, broad EU foreign policy as the members feel they can rely on &amp; trust Germany. 

3. It will put Germany in a better position to help it's other EU/NATO allies, France &amp; the United Kingdom, in things like Mali &amp; Libya, both of which were called for by European powers. If Germany wants to see the EU integrate, for a common foreign policy to be established &amp; a consolidated military to actually exist, it needs to actually aid France &amp; Britain in helping maintain regional stability instead of forcing them to rely on America. A consolidated military &amp; single foreign policy, which I think something like this would encourage, would happy heavily in something like Ukraine in my opinion.

true,postmoderno,no-borders,,":D haha ma mi stai prendendo in giro? nel caso fossi serio, ti rispondo seriamente. 
&gt;Vedi, il problema è che tutta quella monumentale produzione non ha portato il benché minimo contributo alle scienze sociali, con l'eccezione degna di nota di diverse applicazioni delle tesi marxiste ad ambiti diversi dall'economia... e questo solo perché tuttora in alcune discipline la teoria marxista è l'unico esempio o quasi di economic way of thinking. Non saranno teorie cospiratorie, ma fino a prova contraria queste ""critiche del sistema"" sono prive di una base scientifica soddisfacente.

la produzione critica di sinistra e' tuttora il modo prevalente di interpretazione della realta' nelle scienze sociali, persino qua in usa, centro dell'impero. credo che non esista un solo dipartimento di geografia / studi urbani / culturali / letterari / antropologici/ filosofici (con l'eccezione degli analitici) / comunicazione / roba umanistica / addirittura religious studies / che non sia PESANTEMENTE orientato su teorie critiche di sinistra. seriamente. anche perche' non esiste un sistema critico altrettanto complesso e profondo. semplicemente non c'e'.

parlando del mondo al di fuori della torre d'avorio accademica (e magari fuori dall'occidente) generazioni di attivisti politici e culturali hanno letto e assorbito e reinventato idee di pensatori venuti prima di loro. voglio dire, i movimenti di liberazione coloniale dall'algeria all'indocina, dall'america latina all'africa nera leggevano gente come Gramsci, come Fanon, come Labriola, come Malatesta, eccetera. Voglio dire, rendere indipendenti paesi da secoli sotto il dominio coloniale di potenze mondiali non e' avere un impatto sul reale, sulla storia?

prive di una base scientifica soddisfacente? senza offesa, ma cazzo questa e' la cosa piu' imbrazzantemente neckbeard che abbia letto qua su reddit. per curiosita' quale di questi pensatori credi che non avesse una ""base scientifica soddisfacente""? althusser? foucault? deleuze? intendi dire che lo studio della storia non e' scientifico? che lo studio della geografia e della demografia non e' accurato? illuminami ti prego. 

&gt;Nessuno direbbe che sostenere che il cancro è un fungo sia una ""critica della medicina"". Perché dovremmo dare ascolto a chi racconta che l'economia di mercato genera disastri di ogni tipo, mentre il socialismo reale funzionerebbe alla grande, se solo lo applicassero nel modo giusto. Ci sono svariate centinaia di milioni di persone tra cinesi, indiani ed est-europei, a smentire queste tesi con le loro conquiste economiche, sociali e più semplicemente umane.

non riesco a capire l'analogia col cancro / medicina, non ha il minimo senso. forse ti sfugge che la critica al capitalismo non e' necessariamente socialista e che il pensiero di sinistra ha criticato anche il sistema socialista sovietico, nelle sue OVVIE derive imperialiste e repressive. Idem per quello cinese. voglio dire, nella mia modesta esperienza di lettura di questo tipo di pensiero credo di non aver mai letto una sola riga che dicesse ""il socialismo reale funzionerebbe alla grande, se solo lo applicassero nel modo giusto"". Nessuno descrive societa' utopiche a cui aspirare, quello lo facevano i francesi nell'800 e oggi quei poveretti degli ancap/libertarian  E' normale che in un sistema in cui esistono indigenza, violenza dello stato sui cittadini, disuguaglianza, disparita' di accesso ad un'esistenza degna di esseri umani ci si chieda: perche'? cosa crea queste condizioni? come funzionano questi fenomeni? 

per vedere i danni di un certo modo di intendere l'economia di mercato mi basta uscire di casa qua nel sud becero degli stati uniti. poverta', ignoranza, oppressione continua, marginalizzazione, distruzione totale dei diritti dei lavoratori, irrispetto assoluto delle elite nei confronti delle masse.

Can you think about the way the UK government would act if it were offered 20 years of free gas so as not to interfere in Eastern Europe affairs? 

You see, the westerners have a dissociated view about Russia, they never dealt with it to understand the futility of acting by the book with them. They also don't get the fact that easterners feel genuinely threatened by Russia.  And it is not necessarily of an invasion,  because Russia has a very thick cookbook of how to properly fuck a country from the backstage,  the energy policy being just one prime example. 

That's why most of the easterners try to suck as much American  cock as they can because deep down they know security guarantees from Western Europeans don't cover subversive aggresion and in general are shit. 

Now Germany has bulged. This is a signal to others.  Ukraine may be sacrificed for the sake of gas. Moldova and Georgia can say goodbye to any chance of joining the EU,  Orban is eating from Putin's hand, Bulgaria only needs discreet signs to assume the blowjob position, Greece has several pipelines from Russia coming it's way, don't even get me started with Serbia... 

That leaves Romania very, very isolated. That explains the shift in foreign policy announced almost a decade ago by the Romanian president,  placing the first pivot in Washington which raised eyebrows in Berlin and Paris.

He was always happy to be there, happy to help, and fun.He always wore a big grin on his face and he was one of the people who really got me into German simply through his joy to be there alone. He was passionate about the subject and he was great at making the class fun. (z.B. he made everyone in the class emotions like wütend with the same emotion that the word represented.)

He was a bit older, I'd say mid 50s or so, but he was definitely on the up and up with modern German media, TV, and culture. We talked about Wetten Das. . . ? and other 'newer' German media. It made transitioning into the culture and language easier when he knew of contemporary sources we could use and enjoy.

Compare that to my second year German teacher (The head of the entire foreign language department). She was strict, unfair, talked to the students like they were unintelligent for not picking up a concept she only used once the entire semester, and was not at all connected in any way to modern German culture. Needless to say she also rode on a **very** high horse. She very nearly killed all the desire the first year teacher imbued. I'm glad I stuck with it in the long run, but it was hard to even have the will to go to her class. Other students felt the same way. Her first 201 class had 25 students at the start of the semester, and 16 by the end. Her 202 class (which I did not take) had 13 students.  

I guess my point is, as a student if you are happy to be there and happy to share your knowledge you'll do just fine. 

Hope this helps!

Non sono nuove teorie critiche, prendono solo la teoria che già c'è (sostanzialmente marxista - ma non solo) e la applicano al loro ambito. Poiché le cose basilari del pensiero economico sono tutto sommato condivise, questo porta a conclusioni ragionevoli.  Ma se chiedi nel dipartimento di economia, ti diranno che la teoria marxiana non è più considerata scientifica, se vuoi raggiungere conclusioni davvero accurate (sia descrittive che normative) faresti meglio a usare una teoria diversa.

L'esempio della teoria marxiana è solo quello più eclatante, in realtà il discorso è sostanzialmente analogo per la psicanalisi di Freud, che gioca tuttora un ruolo in certe analisi di fenomeni culturali. Al dipartimento di psicologia ti diranno che è pseudoscientifica, però molte delle conclusioni più basilari probabilmente restano in piedi.

Tutto qui. Non è un grande mistero, e non dimostra nessuna superiorità di queste teorie, neanche in ambito accademico.

Sui risultati dei movimenti di liberazione che come tu dici si rifacevano a teorie di sinistra, meglio stendere un velo. Non per la liberazione in sé, ovviamente, ma per quanto è successo dopo. In molti casi non si è poi riusciti a garantire un governo soddisfacente della società, e allora qualche dubbio su queste teorie di sinistra ti viene.

Non so cosa intendi per ""un certo modo di vedere l'economia di mercato"" ma il sud degli stati uniti non è certo la sua applicazione migliore, proprio per il predominio di certe vecchie élite e la scarsa attenzione alla redistribuzione dei redditi come contrasto alla povertà.

I've said (typed) this many times, but I'll do it again.  German pacifism (or is it profitism?) is leaving a huge vacuum in Europe.  Instead of the establishment of meaningful European defense capability (even if not intergrated), Europe relies on NATO.  This prevents the EU from growing into a self-sufficient entity.  It just isn't natural for the largest economy/population in the EU to be removed from matters of defense.

On voit que Métro ne doivent pas suivre souvent l'actualité spatiale.

Déjà on peut pas dire une orbite elliptique à environ 17000 kilomètres d'altitude, ça n'a aucun sens. Une trajectoire elliptique a un périgée et une apogée qui peuvent être des altitudes fondamentalement différentes ce qui signifie une grande excentricité de la trajectoire.

En plus de cela, des lancements ratés il y en a eu des dizaines et des dizaines depuis le début de la conquête spatiale. Il est relativement difficile de mettre des satellites sur orbite et quand bien même ce processus est bien en place maintenant, certaines anomalies peuvent survenir, c'est normal. Alors c'est une excuse pour les gens de critiquer le lancement des satellites du programme Galileo car celui-ci a pris beaucoup de retard. Ça n'a aucun sens. Comment le citoyen lambda et le journaliste peut-il comprendre les causes d'un échec? Et comment peut-il se permettre de le juger?

Ces satellites ne sont pas forcément perdus dans l'espace intersidéral. Si aucune utilité, il seront désorbités puis retomberont dans l'atmosphère. Et si les propulseurs sont utilisés correctement, par exemple, on peut imaginer au périgée, la où la vitesse du satellite est maximale, on pourrait économiser du carburant et rectifier le tir. La charge utile de ce satellite a bien d'autres fonctions qui pourraient être utiles au projet.

Juste, laissez faire les pros. On croirait presque que les médias et l'opinion sont en train de traiter Arianespace et l'ESA d'incompétents. L'industrie spatiale est une industrie de haute technicité et on envoie des satellites sciemment dans l'espace. Des erreurs peuvent survenir mais peut-on en vouloir à des gens qui envoient des équipement ultra-modernes, conçus pour tenir les charges mécaniques mais également les agressions extérieures comme les rayonnements électromagnétiques, à des distances supérieures de 3 fois le rayon de la Terre, à des vitesses vertigineuses de quelques km.s^(-1) de faire une erreur? Il y a des milliers de paramètres à prendre en compte, et chaque paramètre est crucial. C'est normal que si une erreur survient on aboutit à un ""couac"". 

Ça me fait juste mal qu'on critique leur boulot. Si le projet Galileo a pris du retard, ce sont des soucis de gestion de projet, donc cet échec n'est pas à mettre sur le même plan. D'un côté les aspects techniques, d'un autre les aspects administratifs. ",0,1409016193,null,0,false,0,ck0i6zw,t3_2ejrd9,t1_ck0i6zw,t3_2ejrd9,null,1427358342,11,false,france,t5_2qhjz,11

Problem is that they are trying to do that with an autocratic state with imperialist ambitions. Here is where I have problems with this approach. You should not support or condone this kind of behaviour in Europe or anywhere in the world. The position here should be strict and clear: denounce imperialistic antidemocratic attitudes and continue cooperation once it is gone. 

Today you ""solve"" the problem in Putin's favor and what guarantees will you have tomorrow? What if he tries to Anschluss Belarus next? What if ""concerned citizens"" and ""polite men"" appear in Northern Kazakhstan next? Then in Narva? Can you trust and cooperate with leader who openly denounces the West, openly confronts it and openly challenges it? I don't know, I'd rather not. I'd rather have a democratic and Western-oriented Russian nation with people sharing European values instead of ""spiritual braces"" or orthodox fundamentalism. That would make cooperation much more fruitful.

That being said the way Europe should find ways to build up the energy independence and diversify the gas dealers instead of playing same old tune hoping that it'll pass. Europe should keep political pressure on Russia to change it from the inside, to make it evolve from the corrupt criminal state it is now into a functioning democracy.

J'ai souvent entendu cet argument, mais j'ai du mal à le comprendre.

Si on légalise le cannabis, on peut le taxer à un niveau tel qu'on garde les prix à peu près inchangés : du coup, les acheteurs¹ achetant à peu près autant (puisque de leur point de vue les choses sont essentiellement les mêmes), on a principalement un transfert d'argent des vendeurs vers l'État.  L'État peut alors, si c'est indispensable², réinjecter cet argent dans les quartiers en question (sous forme d'aides sociales, de subventions aux collectivités territoriales, etc.).  Il faut quand même vraiment être pessimiste pour ne pas espérer que des aides publiques soient à la fois plus efficaces et plus justes qu'un système mafieux pour assurer le développement social d'un quartier défavorisé.

¹ J'imagine que les acheteurs sont globalement plus aisés que les vendeurs, et qu'en plus on n'a pas spécialement envie de promouvoir la consommation de la substance, donc on ne tient pas à faire baisser les prix au bénéfice des acheteurs.  En tout cas, il n'y a aucune nécessité à le faire.

That means a lot of heavy-handed changes that people need to be willing to make and Germany in particular, together with France and the UK, need to be united behind this:

1. Sanctioning the Russian energy market. This is the only sanction that matters and everybody knows it, everything else is just nibbling away while the bear does what he wants. This feeds into 2 related points.

2. Accept that a deterioration in diplomatic relationships with Moscow is an inevitability and that the EU gains nothing by bending over backwards to placate and entertain a government that has demonstrated again and again it is only interested in advancing it's own interests with little thought to those of it's neighbours, which it itself so often demands of others.

3. Reduce energy dependency on Russia and explore other sources. The EU is in the enviable position of having a fairly positive diplomatic image and stable, growing economy overall with a wealth of trade partners, several of whom have intimated that they'd be interested in expanding their trade deals if we ever decided to explore other options. This should have been considered long ago - one sole energy supplier for around 33% of the continent's energy should never have been allowed to happen; it only hurts us, it never helps.

4. Boots on the ground in Ukraine, at Kiev's invitation, for both medical, subsistence and military aid. This conflict needs to end and Ukraine needs help consolidating and rebuilding the Donbas. 

5. Oversight into whatever administrative restructuring needs to occur in Ukraine to insure that all parties are equally represented, while being wary of ongoing Russian destabilization that I would have no reason to believe would end simply because the armed rebellion is put down.

6. A concerted push for an organized, unified military funded and contributed by all states. I'm not suggesting American levels of investment which frankly even they should scale back on, but there is no reason the EU shouldn't be fielding the top military in the world when it has Germany, the UK and France as major contributors on top of Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden and everyone else.

7. An effort from both Berlin and London to integrating the UK into the EU more. I'm concerned about the long-term direction of the body where France is the only counter to German interests. I'm also aware this is at best tangentially related to the topic at hand, but it's key to the ongoing success of the EU.

While we love Grilling and sometimes BBQ (if we know it), and certainly like some/most US recipies (we probably don't like the fat ones)  we have our own Grilling tradition, and that tradition is doing it yourself. BBQ will be mistaken for grilling, and you won't be able to attract customers. 

Details: A german grilling event is always in your own garden/at a lake, or in nature. We grill the meat ourselfs. Tradition dictates that everybody who can/wants brings something, usually a salad. Also, sausages. More sophisticated (favoured by vegetarians and students) is the usage of Grill chease (Feta /Haluni). The charm is the open and informal atmosphere. 

I don't think a BBQ restaurant would have much success or even be able to attract customers - unless you style/sell it as something different, best go for sophistication as a Steakhouse p.e. ""Original American Steakhouse and BBQ"". (Or, a Korean BBQ (that is different, yes; also ""Korean"" is an adjective for sophisticated food) but seriously, a good (moderately priced) and atmospheric Korean style BBQ restaurant would be really profitable - at least around Munich)  

Your biggest problem would be the ""move to germany and open American style BBQ restaurant"" - you would need to speak perfect german; years of education in taxation, laws and regulations; a lot of money or significant collateral/qualification to get a credit; and, last but not least, a german citizenship/work permit. 

**TL;DR:**

1) Problem: Avertisement. To most BBQ just does not read like something you would want do in a restaurant, and ""American"" is not an adjective for sophisticated food.

2) Problem: Execution. German bureaucracy and 1) will make it really difficult without beeing fluent in german.

Once they get there, you will typically find nicer, newer, and cleaner cars than taxis. The drivers are all nice because they have to be if they want to continue driving.

One school of teaching says you shouldn't give negative feedback and correct mistakes, but in my experience demonstrating the wrong way together with the right way is really effective. I sing in a choir, and the conductor is also a professional singer, and he teaches it that way, both with respect to correct pitch and how the vowels should be sung.

Tuition is more or less free, you have to pay a [nominal fee](http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/studieren/studium/admin/gebuehr/) of 150 EUR per semester that will also allow you to use public transport for free (""Studententicket""). A similar fee applies to all universities in Germany.

It's possible to get a [grant](http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/itlr/fakultaet/html/aktuelles/StipendienAusschreibung2014.pdf) to support you as a foreign student.

The faculty is located on the campus in Vaihingen outside the city centre. There are [dormitories](http://www.studierendenwerk-stuttgart.de/en/accommodation-0) in Vaihingen, or you can share a flat in Vaihingen with other students (google ""Wohngemeinschaft (WG)"").

true,curson,europe,,"The route is more or less correct. Keep in mind, though, that the Malpensa Express train from MXP doesn't have a station at Terminal 2 (the one from where EasyJet operates) but only one at Terminal 1. So, if needed, count additional time to move from one terminal to the other (with a shuttle bus).

You're seeing *only* Trenitalia tickets available because Trenitalia is the only railways operator in Italy, so that's (unfortunately) your only option. 

Now, take the next with a grain of salt, as I've been living in the UK for a while, and while I am Italian (and originally from Milan), I've been a bit removed from the goings of our railways system as of late... anyway, the main thing to consider is the ""Type"" of train.

**Freccia Rossa**, **Freccia Bianca** trains, are high-velocity ones. They will take you from Milano Centrale direct to Torino Porta Nuova (wihtout need for any exchange) in about 1 hour. Those trains **will require** you to have a seat assigned/booked to board. This means that there is the possibility, especially since it's a reasonably busy commuter route, to end up with a fully booked train and thus unable to buy a last-minute ticket when you arrive at Milano Centrale station. I am not aware of any requirements to have the ticket booked in advance, that to say, that if **available**, buying one last minute at the ticket office of the station should always be possible within reasonable time from departure.

There are also commuter trains on the line, called ""Regionale Veloce"". They will stop at intermediate stations, and will take up to 2 hours to get you from Milan to Turin. That said, they should be fairly cheaper and **do not** require for you to have a pre-assigned seat. As far as I recall, they sell ""standing"" tickets as well on these trains, meaning that they don't cap the number of passengers to the number of seats available. While I wouldn't really recommend this choice (even if 50% cheaper than Freccia Bianca/Rossa), it's always a last ditch option.

As for the timing of all of it, unless you have stringent requirements for your arrival time in Turin, I'd play it safe. Italy is Italy, and while the transport connections look fine on paper, you still run the risk of a small delay here and there. All in all, I'd suggest booking in advance a ticket for the afternoon, within a reasonable time cushion: it will allow you to have time to get through the airport formalities (that, admittedly, should be quite speedy: MXP isn't a terribly busy airport), allow for any potential travel issue, and at the same time be safe and sure to have a seat already waiting for you on the train.

Hope this helps a bit :) Turin is beautiful, by the way, but don't look at the top of the ""Mole Antonelliana"", it's supposed to bring bad luck! Enjoy. ",0,1409034739,null,0,1409040758,0,ck0phwn,t3_2el3gc,t1_ck0phwn,t3_2el3gc,null,1427354831,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5

&gt;
&gt;__Ruby Weapon__ is one of the two superbosses of *Final Fantasy VII*, along with the Emerald Weapon. In *Final Fantasy VII*, it is one of the three Weapon enemies added in the North American, PAL, and International versions of the game. Ruby Weapon is one of seven Weapons the Planet has produced and dispatched to cleanse any threats to its continued existence, and one of the five awoken as a result of Sephiroth summoning Meteor.
&gt;Ruby Weapon is an optional boss that resides in the sand around the Gold Saucer on the world map. To get it to appear, the player must defeat Ultimate Weapon and then fight one random battle afterward to trigger Ruby Weapon's appearance, although some players have reported Ruby Weapon not appearing at all, or that it appears but is invisible and the player can only initiate the battle by running into it by chance.

Maintaining relations with Russia and a good situation for Eastern Europe aren't mutually exclusive

&gt; An unified defense and foreign policy, in my opinion, is key to show that Russia can't just fuck around with Europe and get away with it. 

A system of automatic military alliance between world powers ? Now, where have I heard that before...

&gt; Sure, the German economy would suffer a bit from bad relations with Russia, but you know what?

Europe's economy will be even worse despite already being in the shitter ? *Cui bono ?*

&gt; It will suffer even more if we fuck over our allies and neighbours

Yes, we want harsher sanctions which will definitly not affect Europe's economy and unemployment

&gt; If Putin isn't supposed to lose face, then maybe he should not invade and annex sovereign countries.

Maybe the EUS shouldn't pose next to the founder of the Social-National Party of Ukraine and a notorious anti-Semite just because the latter hate a democratically elected president who refused a 600M EU in favor of a 12B Russian deal. You know, just follow the EP recommendations...

&gt; You know that military deal Germany had with Russia about a training base that got called of after MH17? Yeah, we should offer that deal to Ukraine

Oh yes, military support for a country whose western parts collaborated with Nazi germany, that will sit well with the Russian population. 

More seriously, it's obvious a country as polarized as Ukraine can not join the European Union nor the Eurasian Union and especially not NATO, it should be ""finlandized"" for the benefit of all. Joining the EU should not be a goal in itself, prosperity can be reached outside of it.

 And that's completely putting aside wether EU member states want Ukraine to join at all, the minimum wage there is lower than in China. Will this benefit the peoples of the EU or corporations ?

true,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"As far as driving is concerned, the unwritten etiquette is different enough to throw Americans at first, but don't worry. Make sure you understand what the signs and road markings mean, keep to the right unless passing or turning, and keep your distance from the car in front at all times. Americans often say that in Germany, on-ramps and off-ramps are shorter than they're used to. Although many stretches of the autobahn have no speed limit for cars, the recommended driving speed is 130 km/h -- if you drive faster and are involved in an accident you may have difficulty with the insurance.

You'll likely be driving in icy or snowy conditions some of the time -- don't panic, just keep a cool head. Accelerate, brake and steer gently, never ever allow the wheels to spin. Remember that whatever the posted speed limit is, you are still required to reduce your speed if the road and weather conditions demand it. You are legally required to have winter tyres fitted if you are driving in snowy or icy conditions. Note that calling them ""snow tyres"" is a slight misnomer: they're not only for more traction in snow, they're also formulated to stay supple in colder weather, so highly recommended to have them fitted in the winter even if there is no snow. All-weather tyres are legally acceptable, but not recommended.

ETA: Studded tyres are illegal in Germany, except on a few routes close to the Austrian border (because they're legal in Austria -- go figure.)

For the most part, you should be fine. Most roads, at least the important ones, will normally be kept clear most of the time.

If you want to drive to Austria -- highly recommended, and it's really close to where you are -- you'll need to purchase a ""Vignette"", a sticker that goes on the windshield. This allows you to use Austria's autobahns and express routes. (If you can plot a course that completely avoids these roads, you won't actually need the Vignette.)

Apart from that, *do* try to explore the area, and don't be afraid to go off the beaten track. You're going to be in picture-postcard Bavaria, and before the winter sets in you should probably grab a camera and explore all the little villages and the mountain pastures (""alm"", as they are known locally). A road map of the area (the ADAC, the German motoring organisation, publishes pretty good maps) will usually mark scenic routes, sights and villages that are particularly worth visiting, and places that offer good views. If you're a keen walker, a larger-scale map will show hiking trails -- there are always dozens of these, ranging from two-hour strolls to three-day hikes. Sometimes there may be information signs on the history, geology, flora and fauna of the area, and if you're really lucky, they may even have English-language summaries.",0,1409036200,null,0,false,0,ck0pudd,t3_2ejsrd,t1_ck0pudd,t1_ck09sk1,null,1427354669,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3
true,Kologne,null,null,"In bigger cities you can already choose from Albanian to Zimbabwean food, so there probably is an American restaurant already. And successful at that. But American food has a rather singular and low reputation in Germany of Kraft and fastfood. Your competitor will cook oversized hamburgers and spare-ribs mostly. Because it's what people expect. 

Many foreign restaurants are very cliché if people don't know the real thing. While most Germans know what an Italian restaurant's menu in Italy will contain, they're oblivious to Chinese or Mexican food. So they will expect a Chinese or Mexican restaurant to be like every other of its kind in small town Germany. Which is probably nothing like the real deal.

So if an American restaurant wants to be successful, it either has to deliver to the customers' low expectations or it has to set itself aside by very good marketing.

Think of German restaurants in the US. They're nothing like a restaurant in Germany, at best similar to what can be found in a comparatively small region south most Germans (the Bavarians themselves included) wouldn't even think of as typically German.

When asked about their origins, they would probably mention Naples as the best known city as well as the capital of their former nation.

Nel primo dovevi saltare prima su piattaforme che apparivano all'ultima frazione di secondo, e poi su una serie di piattaforme mobili che ti sparavano pure (e spesso per un bug non potevi atterrarci sopra mentre sparavano), con in più dei nemici che ti arrivavano addosso, tipo i proiettili di Super Mario, ma con traiettoria ondulata.

Il secondo era un livello in quattro parti (nel senso che in teoria erano quattro livelli, ma ne cominciavi ognuno nelle stesse condizioni in cui eri alla fine del precedente), e c'erano dei boss abbastanza impestati, tra cui uno che potevi sconfiggere agevolmente solo sfruttando un *glitch*.

&gt; How do trains work in Europe?

Compared to American trains, they're very punctual, so be on time. Each train has a unique number, which will be printed on timetables and displayed on departure boards. I can't speak for Poland, but in a German station the electronic departure board will tell you which track your train is due at, and any information about delays, etc. If you have reserved a seat on the train (highly recommended), a plan on the platform (a ""Wagenstandanzeiger"") will show you where exactly your coach is due to stop so you can be standing on the right spot on the platform so you don't have to fight your way through narrow corridors with all your stuff, looking for your coach. Bear in mind, though, that it can sometimes happen that trains arrive with their coaches in a different order -- the electronic departure board will warn you ahead of time if this is the case.

&gt; Can I purchase train tickets ahead of time

Up to three months in advance. And you should, because you can usually get better deals. However, you might be able to buy tickets from the Polish operator, and this might be cheaper. If the Polish operator has a website that allows you to purchase tickets online (which you simply print out at home), do that, or ask your friend to buy tickets for you and send them to you.

If you can buy tickets online, you print them out, and they have a QR code which the ticket inspector simply scans. A recent innovation is an app that allows you to buy tickets with your phone, and then you don't need to print anything out at all: the inspector simply scans the QR code on your phone (make sure the backlight is on).",0,1409039343,null,0,false,0,ck0qi1m,t3_2ekvh2,t1_ck0qi1m,t3_2ekvh2,null,1427354362,6,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,6

What it has to do with EU exit clause?

Ukrainian politicians commenced the procedures to join our Union in the 90's under Kuchma administration, then Ushenko illegally came to power and halted the procedures but kept benefiting from the deal. Then Yanukovich finally came to power and said that the process would be continued, so the benefits kept coming until his ousting. 

Basically Ukraine had all benefits both as completely independent country and as a member state of our Union. Which is estimated $200-250BNs. While Russian Federation got almost nothing from these arrangements.

That would be almost $2000 for each Russian citizen.

true,MauvaisConseil,YAFrance,France,"&gt; Comment légaliser et faciliter l'accès pourraient diminuer la consommation ?

Légaliser ne facilite pas l'accès. C'est là tout l'intérêt. Actuellement, tout le monde a déjà accès de toute façon. Surtout chez les mineurs c'est difficile pour un lycéen qui en veut de ne pas en trouver.

Quand tu as 50% de la population qui y a accès, on ne peut pas parler de restriction. Regarde les statistiques : la Hollande fume moins que la France, et particulièrement chez les jeunes.

Ce qui diminue la consommation, c'est le fait de ne plus considérer ça comme une contre culture et d'informer au lieu de dire n'importe quoi. Arrêter les mensonges permet de diminuer la consommation.

&gt;Il y a forcément des gens qui sont plus réticents à consommer s'ils doivent aller se fournir auprès de personnes louches de manière illégale, et qui seraient encouragés par un cadre légal et plus mainstream

Pas chez les jeunes en tout cas. Chez les vieux, la consommation est basse et il vaut mieux que ce soit l'état qui s'occupe de la qualité et qui prenne l'argent.

&gt;Imaginer le contraire défie la logique

Imaginer que la solution actuelle est efficace défie la logique.

Right after the reunification, this was essentially the ""Wild East"". People were optimistic and curious, but these feelings soon met the harsh reality. Many east german companies couln't compete with western companies, in quality and productivity. The socialist ""Planwirtschaft"" ruined that, so they had to close. Other companies that were actually well were bought by western investors and closed in order crush competition. The job market was shit, millions were unemployed. Especially in rural areas jobs were non-existent. Who could went west. 

This bred a problem with violence and neo nazis. The youth were hopeless, had no perspective and they were just looking for acceptance, for a group, for something. Suddenly, lots of foreigners showed up: Asylum seekers and ""Russlanddeutsche"". Especially the latter were a problem. They were the family of germans that stayed in teh eastern territories after the war. There were at least two in every class in school. They barely spoke german - and they were brutal. If you looked at them in the wrong way you got your ass kicked *hard*. Really hard. And they got the good jobs. Believe it or not, call it a right wing stereotype, they got good jobs at public employers. I remember one instance were I called the public library and the lady on the phone could not understand me because she couldn't speak german. That didn't help with the nazis!

The enviroment was shit because there were no safety and enviromental regulations for power plants, factories, waste disposal, ... in the GDR.

Everything was grey, ugly, it smelled bad and was dirty.

The wage gap was enourmus, eastern workers got just 50% of the wetern counter parts.

And now? I got so much better! The rebuilt the infrastructure with modern technology. There were programs to recultivate the forests and so on. The local goverments did their best to get investors. The job market recovered. Saxony is actually a place worth living.

There is still a wage gap, but the living expenses are also lower than in the west. There a great universites and good jobs in IT and engineering.

The older generation that struggled around 1990 is sadly lost, but for their children it is so much easier. They have good perspectives.

East Germany improved greatly in the last 20 years and the social differences are noticable if you live here.

Before someone starts talking about the soli: EVERYONE pays it, not just westerners. 


EDIT: I forgot something important: Since the economy is better there less neo nazis. When I was a kid I saw groups of them from time to time, but I haven't seen one (obvious) neo nazi in years.

&gt;Poroshenko said the dissolution, which was prefigured by the breakup of the majority coalition last month, was in line with ""the expectations of the vast majority of the citizens of Ukraine"" and called it a move toward ""cleansing"" the parliament.

&gt;Many members of parliament ""are allies of the militants-separatists,"" Poroshenko said, referring to the pro-Russian rebels who have battled government troops in the country's east since April.

&gt;The Party of Regions, which is backed by much of the country's industrial, Russian-speaking east and was supported by pro-Russian ex-president Viktor Yanukovych, was the largest party in parliament before Yanukovych fled the country in the wake of massive protests in February and still has a substantial presence.

&gt;Most of these members ""accepted dictatorial laws that took the lives of the Heaven's Hundred,"" he said, using the common term for those killed during the protests against Yanukovych, many by sniper fire.

&gt;He emphasized the need to elect new leaders from the war-torn areas of east Ukraine in order to represent the region in the new government. It wasn't clear how it would be possible to conduct elections at such short notice in Donetsk and Luhansk, where hundreds of thousands have fled their homes and shelling between rebel and government forces continues daily.",0,1409042497,null,0,1409049776,0,ck0r31i,t3_2elsdl,t1_ck0r31i,t1_ck0r0nq,null,1427354090,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Les médias généralistes ont tendance à voir cette affaire comme la démonstration d'un sexisme et d'une misogynie généralisée chez les *gamers* et les *geeks*, ces affreux puceaux boutonneux qui compenseraient leur frustration sexuelle en déversant des torrents de haine contre les femmes.

Alors que la communauté des gamers voit le ""Quinnsgate"" comme une démonstration flagrante du copinage entre l'industrie du jeu vidéo et la presse vidéoludique. Avouez que l'occasion était trop belle: des journalistes de médias vidéoludiques qui sont *littéralement* dans le lit d'une créatrice de jeux vidéo. 

Le ras-le-bol des internautes s'est déversé lorsque des modérateurs de forums tels que /r/gaming ou des sites tel que Kotaku ont essayé d'étouffer l'affaire et d'en faire un non-problème, entraînant un magnifique effet Streisand. La chasse à la sorcière qui a suivi a forcément entraîné des abus et des atteintes à la vie privée, mais en même temps, je ne sais pas si on doit forcément attendre un comportement civilisé de la part des cinglés de 4chan.

Le principal problème c'est que Zoe Quinn sort elle-même la carte du sexisme, comme si être une femme lui garantissait une immunité absolue qui lui interdisait d'avoir à répondre de son comportement dans sa vie professionnelle. La majorité des internautes qui lui courent derrière avec une fourche se fichent pas mal qu'elle ait couché avec cinq gusses. Le problème, c'est que trois de ces gusses ont potentiellement fait avancer la cause du jeu qu'elle a créé. Et que l'un de ces types bosse à Kotaku.

Quel est le comportement le plus sexiste ? Décrire Quinn comme une manipulatrice prête à tout pour faire avancer ses intérêts personnels (une description en partie confortée par les faits) ?

Germany had to be dragged to implement sanctions, when pretty much every single NATO and EU member was pushing for sanctions, Germany couldn't afford to look like they were defending Russia by themselves, but in no way did they implement the sanctions willingly.

&gt;contradicting what Putin says and further legitimizing Kiev's government with her visit a few days ago?

Oh you mean the one where she said she favors ""autonomy"" and one day latter her Foreign Minister has a Freudian slip and says ""Federalization""? Is that the trip you're referring to?

&gt;Russia has been escalating this confrontation into a hot war for months. Continuing the escalation is swallowing the bait they've thrown out. Russia has lost the diplomatic and economic game at the moment Yanukovich was chased back to Moscow. They lost the whole of Ukraine in the battle with ink and gold and now they're just seeing how much of their loss they can recover with blood and iron.

There wouldn't be a problem if Merkel was pushing for de-escalation by asking Putin to withdraw the Russian troops from Ukraine and stop military support for the terrorists, but she isn't. On the other hand Berlin is ""worried"" about Ukrainian military successes that won't let Putin ""save face"". Well fuck Putin and fuck Merkel.

When she means de-escalation what she's really referring to is stopping the Ukrainian army from advancing and possibly pulling back some so that Putin can ""save face"", that is what I mean by appeasement.",0,1409043321,null,0,false,0,ck0r84n,t3_2ejcuc,t1_ck0r84n,t1_ck0qz47,null,1427354024,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

You're off-topic. The point is that EUS representatives are not taking pictures with Stalinist nostalgics, they shouldn't take pictures with nostalgics of Nazi collaborationists. But they did so.

Well it's not excuse. It's how things are, called competitive advantage.
Our country can already buy all final consumer goods with money we get from our resources.

1. Western countries won't let their companies to sell ours their patents or shares.

true,BigFrigginShit,null,null,"My two cents:

1. Travelling/Airport: Winter temperatures would hover around -5 degree Centigrade to +5 which isn't much as you are from Canada. So pack your usual jackets and woolens, a good rain jacket and shoes. Add a travel adapter for your electronics if the outlet pin differ from Canada (I assume it does). Carry a good backpack or a rucksack for travelling or hiking. For the Airport, when you exit the aircraft, follow the baggage sign and it will take you to the bag pickup lines and exit (seems obvious but in an airport with foreign language signboards, this tip helps a lot).

2. Culture Shock / Homesickness: Well Canada-&gt;Spain is not such a big culture shock as lets say India-&gt;Spain. The biggest change will be the language as most people will be speaking Spanish and you will be out of your English comfort zone which will be fun. As this is short trip, homesickness would not be a factor unless you hate the food in Spain.

3. Money: Euros, I don't know how well credit cards are accepted in the city you are going to. You can buy a prepaid card and top it with cash while in Canada and withdraw that money in Spain, or carry cash and keep it safe. Depending on what you are paying I assume 300 euro rent + 200 Groceries + 200 entertainment ~ 1000 a month will suffice for you on a basic level (or even less). 

4. Language Barrier: If you haven't learnt Spanish before, becoming fluent in 2.5 months is an uphill task (or for that matter any language). With an intensive Spanish course, one can reasonably expect to learn till the B1 level of European framework in a couple of months. So use your time with your partner to kickstart your learning process and build on it when you are in Spain. Living in Spain solely will not make you good at the language automatically, its a lot of work.

Studies like this can be very unreliable, and it depends who you ask and exactly how you phrase the question. Experiments performed under laboratory conditions are, well, probably unrealistic.

But if East Germans really are more distrustful of others, the explanation would be very simple: by the late 80s, the Stasi had managed to engineer a situation where half the population was spying on the other half. I've seen one former East German's Stasi file: she'd unwisely accepted a lift from a westerner, so the Stasi recruited one of her closest friends who then reported everything she could. The file was full of stuff like ""The subject was insufficiently critical of capitalism"".

I also had a friend who worked for a western company that supplied medical equipment, and he was their only rep for the whole of the GDR. On one visit, the doctors asked if he had time to take a quick look at a piece of equipment that was malfunctioning. He found the problem: it had been bugged.

Of course, that's all balanced out by the observation that has often been made, that people living in totalitarian regimes tend to stick together on the principle that they're all in the same boat. If you need to get hold of something that the stores have run out of, one of your friends has a sister-in-law whose uncle knows somebody who can get it for you.

So I guess it depends what the experiment was actually testing.",0,1409044729,null,0,false,0,ck0rghz,t3_2ekutu,t1_ck0rghz,t1_ck0nxa1,null,1427353916,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

Zitat: *""Deren [Israels] gesamtes Abwehrmodell zum Palästinenserstaat basiert doch auf der Idee,""* - ist die denn abwegig? *-""dass die gewaltbereit sind und ständig angreifen,""* - ist das denn abwegig oder unrichtig? - *""da kann man denen doch nicht den Nachschub zumachen!""* - Hm. Oder wäre das vielleicht sogar eine nachvollziehbare, relativ milde Eingriffsmöglichkeit? - *""Was macht Israel denn, wenn die eines Tages nicht mehr angreifen,""* - oh, die Israelis möchten angegriffen werden? Oder brauchen das sogar? D.h. die wollen gar nicht, dass die Angriffe aufhören? - *""weil sie keine Bomben mehr haben?

Das kann Hamas unmöglich annehmen und Israel hätte endlich was, wo in dieser ganzen Chose Hamas wie die Bösen aussehen und nicht sie.""*

Einen noch (http://blog.fefe.de/?ts=b3428770): *""Ägypten will dann mal die Blockade des Gazastreifens einstellen. Israel ist natürlich wenig begeistert, denn deren Idee war das ja, um die Palästinenser (insbesondere Hamas) als Terroristen zu brandmarken.""* Was genau ist Hamas denn, wenn nicht eine terroristische Vereinigung?

No, that is absolutely wrong. Kiev would have preferred not to have these units at all. But they are volunteer units, staffed mostly from the people of the Eastern Ukraine, who do not want Russian imperialist scum on their land. The support for the separatists is far from unanimous there. 

Kiev was forced to legalize these volunteer battalions in order to insert them into the chain of command and have some control over them. Otherwise, they would have become partisans, out of control, and without restraint.

This is the biggest lie capitalism ever invented. Lower taxes, flat taxes only make the difference between rich and poor higher. You need redistribution of wealth to grow a middle class society. Without that you have oligarchs and peasants. Higher taxes stimulate innovation because it forces rich to increase efficiency. Without that they just store money on accounts.

&gt;

&gt;__Plonk__ is a [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) jargon term for adding a particular poster to one's [kill file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_file) such that the poster's future postings are completely ignored. It was first used in 1989, and by 1994  was a commonly used term on Usenet regarding kill file additions.

&gt;The word is an example of [onomatopoeia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomatopoeia), intended to humorously represent the supposed sound  of the user hitting the bottom of the kill file (imagining perhaps the kill file as a bucket). It is also sometimes given as an [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym) standing for Please Log Off, Net Kook, though this is a [backronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym). Other used expressions are ""__p__ut __l__amer __on__ __k__illfile""  and __P__lease __L__eave __O__ur __N__ewsgroup: __K__illfile!

&gt;It is also used as a verb: ""I plonked that idiot"". As a public repudiation of the plonked poster, it is appended to the end of one's reply (or may constitute the entire reply). A user might also simply reply to the impugned post with the word ""Plonk"".

Sure, in that regard they were dragging their feet at that point.

&gt;Oh you mean the one where she said she favors ""autonomy"" and one day latter her Foreign Minister has a Freudian slip and says ""Federalization""? Is that the trip you're referring to?

What's wrong with federalisation or autonomy? Germany itself is a federal republic where the Länder have a great deal of autonomy, why would it be strange that it's an obvious way to them to resolve regional differences?

Regardless of what scenarios they floated, it still marks Kiev as important and legitimate.

&gt;There wouldn't be a problem if Merkel was pushing for de-escalation by asking Putin to withdraw the Russian troops from Ukraine and stop military support for the terrorists, but she isn't.

Now *that* would be naive and ineffective. What do you expect that the reaction to that is going to be? ""I'm sorry Frau Merkel, I'll never do it again, please don't punish me!""? If anything that will just provoke them into more rash actions just to show that they don't give in to demands from anybody.

&gt;On the other hand Berlin is ""worried"" about Ukrainian military successes that won't let Putin ""save face"".

Of course, because that will necessitate Putin to strike back just to show he's still the biggest badass in the Kremlin, or face a deep fall down from power. That's the logic they're caught in.

&gt;When she means de-escalation what she's really referring to is stopping the Ukrainian army from advancing and possibly pulling back some so that Putin can ""save face"", that is what I mean by appeasement.

If that's enough, why not? Time is on the side of Ukraine. Let them starve, they'll surrender on their own. Alternatives are relative autonomy or some language rights within Ukraine (which they were getting anyway), or a cooling down of the conflict until it's no longer a military matter, or whatever has enough symbolic but little practical value.

So I was right and you were wrong, thanks for agreeing with me.

&gt;What's wrong with federalisation or autonomy? Germany itself is a federal republic where the Länder have a great deal of autonomy, why would it be strange that it's an obvious way to them to resolve regional differences?

Are you a fucking idiot? Federalization of Ukraine transforms Ukraine into a Russia puppet permanently, there would be no EU integration, not now not ever since Russia would practically have direct control of Ukraine's eastern provinces. Federalization is **NOT** an option.

&gt;Regardless of what scenarios they floated, it still marks Kiev as important and legitimate.

No, it fucking doesn't. It looked more like she went there to tell Ukraine to knock it out and give Putin what he wants because she wants business as usual.

&gt;Now that would be naive and ineffective. What do you expect that the reaction to that is going to be? ""I'm sorry Frau Merkel, I'll never do it again, please don't punish me!""? If anything that will just provoke them into more rash actions just to show that they don't give in to demands from anybody.

I expect it would show some fucking leadership, I expect Germany to stick by its allies, I expect for Germany to support a country that's been invaded and not actually take the side of the invader because your gas price might get higher.

&gt;Of course, because that will necessitate Putin to strike back just to show he's still the biggest badass in the Kremlin, or face a deep fall down from power. That's the logic they're caught in.

No, that's the logic you're caught in, the rest of us know that you don't stop a bully by giving in or ignoring him. The only ""logic"" Putin and Russia's political elites in general understand are those of strength.

&gt;If that's enough, why not? Time is on the side of Ukraine. Let them starve, they'll surrender on their own. Alternatives are relative autonomy or some language rights within Ukraine (which they were getting anyway), or a cooling down of the conflict until it's no longer a military matter, or whatever has enough symbolic but little practical value.

You truly have no fucking idea what you're talking about, if Ukraine backs out now, they at the very best scenario will be forced into a Federalization that will cripple the entire country or at worst Russia will outright annex the entire eastern part of it, with the possibility of episode three happening with the entire south of Ukraine.

You think this would be the end of it? Not by any measure, if Ukraine lets Russia annex the east, we'll see the same exact movie again, only this time the city will be Odessa.",0,1409046749,null,0,1409047683,0,ck0rsdv,t3_2ejcuc,t1_ck0rsdv,t1_ck0ro7x,null,1427353762,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

D'après ces calculs il est possible de réduire cette période de chaos a 10.000 ans, en créant une fondation pour archiver tout le savoir de humanité.

Like former cabinet ministers **Lord** Mandelson and **Lord** Adonis?

Like UK ministers, European Commissioners are *not* directly elected. In fact, as in most continental systems, they do not have to be parlamentarians at all (in fact, in many countries, MPs even have to vacate their seats if they enter the cabinet, membership of the executive and legislative branches being considered mutually exclusive).

In the EU as in most parlamentary systems, the executive is indirectly elected by the legislative, and that includes in this case the European Parliament, not the national legislatures. And the European Parliament has made it abundantly clear that it wants a minimally representative number of females in the Commission.

Now, I can imagine that, even with a male candidate, the UK would have a chance of getting a good portfolio if it had nominated a somewhat significant figure.

That just depends on the context. A female doctor on a medical conference full of doctors will think of herself as a woman, but in other circumstances she will think of herself as a doctor. Likewise Europeans think of themselves as members of their region/country while interacting within Europe, but internationally they are much more likely to see themselves as European.

&gt;Worse still, the need to form a single, united power is continuously decreasing.

No. The need is still just as high.

That's counterproductive. They wouldn't be as rich without the markets and labor market of the weaker states.

&gt;and the weaker states are able to get their security guaranteed by NATO (or rather, America), not the other parts of Europe

Pivot to Asia reduces American attention, and the mutual defense guarantee already exists in the EU.

Agree with you there. But like I said, its the same with Russias ""representatives"" and to a larger degree. So I don't really see where you are getting with this.

&gt;See the interview of von Rompuy who said he didn't know if the peoples of Europe were okay with EU enlargement but that it will have to occur anyway.

He might have said it, but this is not how EU works. Newcomers do actually vote whether they want in or not - plus they have to meet certain criteria. And fundamentally, if criteria is met and referendum says yes the Union accepts the member, this is the core of the EU project.

Ein hehres Ansinnen.

Ich glaube, ein direkter Appell ist hier wirksamer, notfalls mit Dementi, ohne hätte er eine provokative Komponente, was einer Dialogisierung zuträglich wäre.

Das versteht man so nicht. Als Nichtmathematiker nicht, weil man Integralrechnug nicht kennt, und ein Mathematiker, würde er der Stichpunkte angesichts in diesem Kontext überhaupt auf Integral- oder Differenzialrechnung kommen, würde zunächst reklamieren, daß da keine Integrationsvariable vorhanden ist und nicht klar wird, ob es sich vielleicht um uneigentiche Integrale handle und fragen, ob diese lösbar sind, dich wahrscheinlich damit in Verlegenheit bringen, und dir schlußendlich vorhalten, daß das eine Steigerung der Perversion oder sowas ist und keine Integration, und du mit Fachbegriffen aus Disziplinen agitierst, die du nur von der Durchreise kennst, also sowohl die Fachbegriffe als auch die Disziplinen — Ich bin kein Mathematiker, kenne aber welche, und die sind manchmal wirklich so ;-)

Mag sein, daß er ordentlich sein wollte, er war aber zumindest nicht ordentlich genug, obwohl die Aufgabe eigentlich ganz einfach war. Und ich sehe da eigentlich keinen Widerspruch.

&gt; 1.    Unbewusste Inkompetenz: Das Individuum versteht nicht, worum es geht oder weiß nicht, wie es bewirkt werden soll; ebenso erkennt es seine eigenen Defizite nicht oder hat ein Problem, sie zu erkennen. Für die Tendenz, die eigenen Defizite nicht zu erkennen, hat sich populärwissenschaftlich der Begriff Dunning-Kruger-Effekt eingebürgert.     
&gt; 2. Bewusste Inkompetenz: Die Person versteht oder weiß nicht, wie sie etwas erreichen kann, kennt jedoch ihre Defizite, kümmert sich aber nicht darum.
&gt; 3. Bewusste Kompetenz: Die Person versteht oder weiß, wie sie die Dinge anpacken muss, um ein Ziel zu erreichen. Trotzdem erfordert das Zeigen des Könnens und Wissens eine hohe Konzentration und Bewusstheit.
 &gt; 4. Unbewusste Kompetenz: Das Individuum hat soviel praktische Erfahrung mit seinen Fähigkeiten, dass sie ihm in Fleisch und Blut übergehen und jederzeit abgerufen werden können, oftmals ohne höhere Konzentration in Anspruch nehmen zu müssen. Diese Person kann ihre Fähigkeiten, da sie sich ihrer nicht bewusst ist, nicht problemlos weitervermitteln wenn seit dem Erlernen ein längerer Zeitraum vergangen ist.

true,diodi,FINL,Finland,"There might be moral obligation help, but I argue that morality is not how international relations  work. I'm interested in understanding how things work, not how they should work. 

There are two main branches of  international relations theory: idealism+liberalism and realism. You are taking idealist/liberalist viewpoint. I represent realism. 

1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism_in_international_relations_theory
2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_international_relations_theory
3. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_%28international_relations%29
4. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-intl-relations/

I argue that the reality of international relations can be explained by realism. Countries look mainly for  their own interest, they only explain and rationalize them using moral principles. 

Only when the world powers and their internal goals reach equilibrium  where no one will gain from changing the system, international organizations and agreements have value and the the system based on idealist or liberal ideas of international relations can grow. Relations between states are anarchic, organizations above  states are not strong, nor do they have independent power. International agreements are more of codifying current intentions, less about binding states to them.   Once the  equilibrium changes, we are back to realism and power politics (This equilibrium roughly the idea presented in War and Change in World Politics (1981) by Robert Gilpin).

Nach vorläufigen Angaben des Statistischen Bundesamtes (Destatis) war dies im Vergleich zum Jahr 2012, als nur 43,9 Millionen Tonnen importiert wurden, ein Anstieg um 15,2 %. Gleichzeitig sank der Preis pro Tonne um 22,3 % von 105 Euro im Jahr 2012 auf 82 Euro im Jahr 2013. [...]
Die wichtigsten Steinkohlelieferanten für Deutschland waren im vergangenen Jahr Russland (12,5 Millionen Tonnen für 992 Millionen Euro), die Vereinigten Staaten (12,0 Millionen Tonnen für 980 Millionen Euro) und Kolumbien (10,0 Millionen Tonnen für 638 Millionen Euro). Aus der EU erhielt Deutschland vorrangig Steinkohle aus Polen (3,4 Millionen Tonnen für 252 Millionen Euro).

There are no secret beautiful places in Italy. Rome, Florence, and Venice are the most crowded, but so are the smaller places. If you've never seen Venice I recommend it despite the crowds. Some other places up north and easier to work into a trip to Germany... 

The Dolomiti (Italian Alps) are a little less crowded and very beautiful. I recently stayed in Dobbiaco. They speak German here as much as Italian.

Cinque Terre is beautiful. It was considered non-touristy about 10 years ago, but isn't anymore. On the plus side, you can't build up here, so it still looks the same (no big resort hotels).

It's pretty far from Germany, but Pulgia gets less tourists (partially b/c it's so far).

Sicily for similar reasons, it's harder to get to. But Beautiful beaches and architecture.

true,TelevisionAntichrist,UNSA,Bad since 1776,"First of all, the U.S. will never export remotely large amounts of coal mined using the technique of mountaintop removal mining. Information recently [came to light that some companies *were* exporting such coal,](http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2012/new-congressional-report-reveals-dirty-mountaintop-removal-coal-exported) and while in relatively small amounts, this is a highly politically sensitive topic. As such, MTR coal exports to Germany will likely never reach more than a few percent of total U.S. coal exports to Germany (and that number is even too high - it should be zero!)

Second of all, according to your wikipedia link

&gt;Almost half of the electricity generated in the United States is produced by coal-fired power plants. MTR accounted for less than 5% of U.S. coal production as of 2001.[10] In some regions, however, the percentage is higher, for example MTR provided 30% of the coal mined in West Virginia in 2006.[16]

So, if the U.S. generates around 50% of its electricity from ""coal"", and of that amount, only 5% (barring a few regions) is mined using dirty mountaintop removal coal, what are the methods of mining the other 95%? Why don't you mention those, I wonder? Why just mention the absolutely worst method of coal extraction - even though that method accounts for a tiny percentage of U.S. consumption and an even less percentage of methods used to mine coal in the U.S. destined to be exported to foreign markets? 

Is it because you're trying to make a cheap and superficial Deutschreddit jab against the U.S.? 

You make it sound like all U.S. coal imports to Germany will come from MTR mining. Then you say I imagine that that is what you infer* here:

&gt;Not in Germany. No chance. But we have a lot of Coal. And we really like Coal, because it is cheap as fuck, thanks to American Mountain-Top-Mining.

Do you think I can't fucking read English or something? 

I've lived in Germany for five years, and the thing I really can't stand is how you Germans weasel yourselves out of anything resembling a guilty position regarding international politics while attempting to place the blame on the U.S. (another example being the situation with the [German trade surplus](http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2012/new-congressional-report-reveals-dirty-mountaintop-removal-coal-exported))

It is an insult - an insult to the intelligence of /r/europe readers - that you *infer* that Germany's overall coal consumption is inexpensive *precisely* because Germany is importing and burning enourmous amounts of Appalachian MTR coal. That isn't true. But fuck me, right?

Quelle proportion de la population a accès au tabac ? 90% ?

En quoi le fait de faire de la prévention est lié avec la légalisation ?

* Pack as small as you can. Getting around with a huge amount of luggage is not fun. 
* Your hairdryer/straightener/etc will probably not work here.
* Really light makeup, and gel/solid deodorant are not easily found here. Bring enough for the whole stay. 
* Bring Canadian stuff over to share so that you know you'll have space in your luggage for anything you buy here. Maple syrup is super expensive here and not very good. 
* Shoes take up the most space/weight. Think carefully about what you'll need. Runners are not common except for when exercising. 
* You will need a coat, although snowboard/sport type coats are uncommon here. 

Culture shock/Homesickness:

* I made a facebook album called 'Weird European things' when I first moved over. It helped me share the strange foods and things that I saw. I found that it was the small things that were harder to accept. 
* You'll probably be busy most of the time. If you're doing things you don't really notice as much.
* There are loads of North Americans in Madrid, which is 45 mins by train from Segovia. There may be quite a few 'language assistants' in Segovia as well, generally aged 20-25 working as English teachers for the year. 

Money:

* Things will be more expensive for you, the exchange rate is not in your favour. Sales tax is already included in the prices, and is around 20%.
* Euro coins are in different amounts than dollars. 1 cent, 2cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents, 1€, 2€. This takes some adjustment. 
* You may need to order Euros from your bank a week or so in advance of your leaving date, especially if you are in a smaller town. 
* Your bank will not accept back Euro change. Try to get rid of the red coins as you go.
* Make sure your cards are all chip and pin. Lots of places won't accept cards without it. You'll also need a photo ID when you use it. Your driving license should be OK. 

Language Barrier:

* I made a phrase book. You can probably pick up a pocket sized tourist one. If you speak no Spanish to begin with you'll probably need it in a small village. You'll learn the phrases as you use them. 
* A Google translate app on unlocked smartphone can replace this. You can get a pay-as-you-go SIM and use data if you need a translation.

Armchair warriors soon found numerous social profiles in VK of the persons from the list -- they really were troopers from Pskov, and many of them disappeared from the Web since August 15-16. Wife of Leonid (one the found persons) wrote on VK that her husband was killed in Ukraine and that he will be buried on Monday (yesterday). One of the friends of Leonid in VK posted mourning words about him.

However, strange things started to happen soon. The wife removed all posts about his death, and posted new status claiming that ""Her husband is alive and well, celebrating name day of my daughter"". Mourning status of one of Leonid's friends disappeared, too. Journalists called to the phone number in Leonid's wife profile, she confirmed that he is ok, and even passed the phone to a man, who said that he is Leonid, and has no idea about rumors about his death.

PS. Journalists of several Russian independent outlets (yes, there is such thing) visited the cemetery where Leonid supposed to be buried, and found his fresh grave, indicating that he indeed died on August 19.

Give me some reliable sources which says this is true, that MTR mining accounts *predominantly* for ""falling"" coal prices. Oh yeah, that's right, there aren't any. 

You guys are just exasperating. 

The reason that coal prices have been falling as of late, is because of America's ***fracking revolution***. To not get into too much detail:

[America’s gas boom has prompted its coal miners to seek new export markets, sending prices plunging on world markets. So long as consumers do not pay for coal’s horrible side-effects, that makes it irresistibly cheap. In Germany power from coal now costs half the price of watts from a gas-fired power station. It is a paradox that coal is booming in a country that in other respects is the greenest in Europe. Its production of power from cheap, dirty brown coal (lignite) is now at 162 billion kilowatt hours, the highest since the days of the decrepit East Germany.](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21600987-cheap-ubiquitous-and-flexible-fuel-just-one-problem-fuel-future)

Germany is whole-heartedly ***against fracking***, yet, as it turns out, Germany benefits tremendously from fracking. Germany doesn't like the idea, so it makes us a story that cheap prices are the result of MTR mining. Then the German media repeats that lie, and Germans don't look into the truth, because the lie makes them feel good. This is called hypocrisy. 

So, again, it seems that I'm only getting half of the truth - if that - from a German guy about international politics. ",0,1409054167,null,0,false,0,ck0t8l9,t3_2ek2wv,t1_ck0t8l9,t1_ck0t41e,null,1427353085,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Russia is protecting its interests. The reason the US backs Israel is because Israel extends American interests in the Middle-East. The reason the US goes against Iran is because Iran challenges American interests in the Middle-East. 


&gt;Now this Russian mentality is ultimately Russia's fault. If Russia weren't so imperialistic, if it accepted that it lost the Cold War and moved on, I'm pretty sure it would be greeted with open arms in an alliance with the West, be it NATO or even the EU. How peaceful would the world be if Russia had moved on to a truly democratic and free society, working for mutual benefit with its European partners? Hell, Russia would be a powerful decider from within the Western alliance.

This is dreamer's talk. A working democracy requires a cultural platform and that can only be established over time. Russia didn't have that and when its old form of government blew up, all riches were looted by various individuals and groups. Those same individuals and groups are now the political powerhouses in Russia. Why would they ever want a truly democratic and free society to take form? Example: the rich in the US are crusading against the unions, because it benefits them. Yet unions benefit society as a whole because it protects the rights and standard of living of a fragile working class. Another example would be how austerity measures within the EU cut deeper in the gaunt body of the poor than the meatier body of the rich. It's simply how politics and society works: people defend their interests.


&gt;But it hasn't evolved, and the West did disregard that fact. It doesn't make it all the West's ""fault"" of course, but the West should have understood that Russia hasn't changed its confrontational mentality. 

The West invaded or intervened in how many countries over the last 25 years? How many nations has it 'bullied' to make them adopt the Western way? I'm not trying to paint Russia as a good guy here, I'm trying to point out that the way Russia plays the international game is simply how the international game *is played* by all big nations. That's why there's such a field as international relations. Sorry, I hope I didn't sound rude or denigrating. Governments like to show their moral flags when the other side does this or that, but then fail to show said flag in their actual actions.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;You are maybe mixing cause and effect. Maybe they won't sell because your president is engaged in dick wagging contest.

Yeltsin was Western puppet. Same things happened, even worse I'd say. Because in the 90's the West took all Soviet high tech by the famous ""brain drain"", because they appealed to freedom of market and movement for professionals. But - when Russian companies tried to hire people in the West - no security clearance.

&gt;Maybe you simply are not competitive because you don't finance it enough?

Yes, because it's impossible to monetize afterwards because of the patent trolls in the West. Because when you make an investment you expect to monetize it, to have a return. The larger the market you have the better price you can put for your product because the more quantity of products share the ""fixed and development costs"".

So imagine Russian company that goes with it's product on Western market, something good quality and innovative. Then some patent troll company comes and sues it. And since it's local company against some Russian company - who would win in most cases? That's one of the reasons why '[bork](http://www.bork.com.pl)' had gone 'international', for example.

Another good example: [Optimus Maximus](http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/maximus/) - they are all right now, but when artlebedev started selling it in the West - there was a serious patent case claim against them, and it was solved only because the patent troll company failed even to produce a prototype.

And there is another couple dozens of Russian corporations that relocated part of their quarters to the West, only to protect themselves against 'European patent justice system'.

And those who failed to do it are mostly bankrupt, because they cannot manage to sell their product in the West even if it has better quality/price ratio. And without Western market it is very difficult to recover the investments in R+D.

&gt;Lower taxes, flat taxes only make the difference between rich and poor higher.

Yes.

&gt;You need redistribution of wealth to grow a middle class society.

Not necessarily, if you have oil/gas money, then you can make taxes rates low for everyone and cover the holes in the budget with it.

&gt;Higher taxes stimulate innovation because it forces rich to increase efficiency.

What it forces to do - is to create offshore schemes and move production abroad where conditions are better.

&gt;Without that they just store money on accounts.

Why would someone do that? If you see the oligarch list in Forbes or similar - you will see that most of their wealth are in shares of their corporate-empires. Which means that only fraction is stored in the accounts, as reserves. 

&gt;Sweden and most of western Europe introduced socialist policies to prevent that, and look they do excellent.

You are oversimplifying things. Northern Europe do excellent mostly because they stole high-tech consumer markets from their Southern 'partners' from European Union, which also have similar social policies and are not doing any good right now.

&gt;Yeah I know Russia is Mecca of neoliberals. This one reason of Russia's failure as innovative economy.

I don't like liberals. But: 1. Russia is not a failure in innovate sector, it's just our products are mostly home-consumed because of what I explained you before and thus far cannot compete in prices with Western products. 2. That is not a reason. USA is also Mecca of neoliberals - they are the #1 in innovations. 

&gt;Truth is you choose people that deliberately turn the stream of goods toward oligarchs. You chose that. Not West.

Some advice.

Spain and Canada are not really that much different. Canada is very ""european"" there will be some stuff that will shock you (and some that will shock your exchange student), don't worry too much for culture shock.

For weather, etc, ask your exchange student for advice, she will know better. That said. Segovia is cold when you are arriving (January, if I made my calculations right) it will get colder, then milder before you leave. I went to Ontario and was shocked by the amount of snow, not so much the cold itself. As someone said before me, the cold/mildness sensation will depend on where are you from and what are you used to.

Travelling: I suppose that is more or less covered by the program. In case it isn't, assuming you are not very tall/big, you can shop clothes here. They will be not very expensive (also of average quality), check http://www.zara.es or https://www2.hm.com/es_es/ to get an idea of what I am talking about. There isn't issues like TSA here, so nothing out of the ordinary for airport, etc.

Homesickness: you'll get homesick, and you need to get over it. You are going to be out for a couple months and you need to get the most out of that experience. If you spend your time on reddit / facebook / chatting with your family and friends you will miss a lot. When I went there there was no Internet (really!) and I was allowed one phone call home per week (overseas phone was expensive). I think that was great to make me integrate myself more in the experience. This should also help with the language.

Language:  I suppose you have already taken some Spanish, if you haven't do so fast. It is much easier to go from 2 to 10 in an immersion scenario than from 0 to 2.

General Advice: you might get along really well with your exchange student or not. If you do, great! become friends. It will make your experience much better. But plan for just tolerating each other. Help her make acquitances with people in and outside your social circle, let her find her friends at Canada and work to find yours here. Try to enroll her in school activities (sports, clubs, etc) and do the same when you come here (try investigating now what your options are and get in touch with the people running them, it might be hard to enroll mid-term).

Food: we eat some stuff that is going to be weird for you. Try everything once if you can ;)

School might be harder in some subjects and softer in others, don't worry about that too much.

And relax, you are going to have fun, learn a lot, and get an experience you'll never forget. Maybe, even, some new friends for life.",0,1409056199,null,0,false,0,ck0trza,t3_2eltwy,t1_ck0trza,t3_2eltwy,null,1427352834,1,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,1

Ok, so you still don't get it. *Anything* which affects your country positively as a result of international trade, trade taking place within the international system, is something which you must take a position on. If you don't, then you're simply saying ""I don't care!"", putting your hands up, and admitting that you are simply refusing to think about the issue. In other words, to not have an opinion on such matters - especially regarding where your country gets its energy sources from - is a weasel move. 

According to your 'posts' (I can't call your posts an argument because it's much too simple), I would *infer* that you *support* fracking in the United States. This is because it effects your country positively, and you support that positivity. 

I *highly doubt* that you have ever told anyone in your life that you support fracking in the U.S., because it makes coal cheaper for Germany to buy on the international market. In fact, I would bet that you have only bitched against fracking in the U.S. 

That makes you a two-faced hypocrite. Unless you can say here and forever that you more support U.S. fracking than don't support it.

Si des journalistes vidéoludiques ou des développeurs de la scène indé prennent la défense de Quinn, c'est souvent parce qu'ils sont eux-mêmes terrifiés de passer pour les bourreaux d'une demoiselle en détresse.

Poroshenko ran on the premise of early parliamentary elections. Ukrainians have from the very beginning been for early parliamentary elections (much like they were from presidential elections).

Actually I wrote it as something to keep in mind because there's little protection against power consolidation happening as it stands.

And I'm sorry, but openly fighting for seperation as well as trying to gain power in the parliament is a having-the-cake-and-eating-it-too situation; you either recognize the legitimacy of the parliament or you don't. 

In the latter case don't be surprised if the country's leadership will attempt to kick you out of office.

My comment isn't about whether or not Russia had the right or should have invaded Crimea. It is about on how the situation evolved to where it was. And what preceded the military conflict was a political one. Firstly the manner in which Yanukovych was removed from power, him being the elected leader and choice of most easterners. Then the changes in parliament (in particular party affiliation) and government that were not put to vote. And finally making the situation blow up, immediate attempts to revoke the 2012 bill regarding language policy and to criminalise dual nationality.

In my opinion especially when we look back how the 1st World War broke out in 1914 it is a dangerous game to play with the fire of geopolitical escalation especially when you have a atomic power on the other side. Of course the EU does not have to accept everything what Russia is doing but we should be very carefull to unnecessarily escalate this conflict. 

It cannot be in the interest of Europe to start a second Cold War with Russia, but we should rather try to integrate them in our political and economical organizations.

&gt;How does it feel when literally every single country that has escaped your sphere of influence since the 90s is better off than it was under Soviet rule, AND better off than mommy Russia itself ?


You tell that to Ukraine and all the stans. You argument would be more accurate if you avoided stuff like :""literally every single country"", but then again, it would require balanced approach, avoidance of labeling people and generally more mature way of communication.
 

Its a shame that Russia went the path it went and countries, politicians, leaders and institutions never seemed to care in 90s, neither in early 2000s when Russian interests/positions were repeatedly violated/disregarded. Might makes right though, history is written by victors and all that jazz. 

Now we are reaping the fruits of what was sowed for the last couple decades at least, current Russian mentality/attitude is just a backlash+attempts to preserve power by corrupt politicians and their buddies oligarchs.

Russia is heavily dependant on European technology and financial institutions, both continents are pretty equal when it comes to ""but i'l cut off x"". Plus LNG ports are being constructed in the baltics, which will open up Europe to the international trade of fracked gas from the US (Currently the world leader in gas production and just second on oil thanks to fracking) and elsewhere etc.
 
Also many countries in the EU have massive reserves of gas and oil as well as both way pipelines just in case a situation like the one in Ukraine ever arose so they can reverse the flow of gas/oil.

Its not like the EU has no answers to Russias gas cut off threats.

&gt; Look at Germany's response to the Ukraine crisis: it is highly tempered by the knowledge it needs Russia.

Yes Germany needs Russia, but Russia needs Germany (holding massive sway over the EU as it does). As i said earlier, both nations can badly affect the other.

The dual nationality issue is something all ex-USSR republics struggle with since Russia *doesn't* allow dual citizenship, which acts as a barrier to naturalization for those Russians that were moved to the satellite states during Soviet times because of the bureaucracy involved in visiting family in Russia if you're not a Russian citizen. Russia also uses the nationality issue as an excuse for getting involved in the domestic affairs of these countries since it needs to protect its expats.

The game has changed but Putin is still playing by the old rules and because of that he is currently losing. The new game is about trade, growth and economic strength. The weapons are not nuclear but agreements between nations and blocks such as EU, NAFTA, WTO etc. Putin may have won Crimea and he may stalled Ukraine and he may even invade but his people and his nation are falling behind because of it. Putin himself may have been strengthen by war-mongering but a strong position in your country is not winning the game on the international level, or Kim Jong-un would be announced the winner by a margin (only in North Korea). Putin may very well find himself in a similar spot, unless he realises that the game has changed. That would have been a better analysis IMHO.

&gt; Your hairdryer/straightener/etc will probably not work here.

This is a fact with this kind of device - stuff that is A/C. You are better off buying a blowdryer, etc when you get there than ruining one you like. And it's just one less thing to pack. But other kinds of electronics like laptops, stuff that is actually DC with a power supply, will work fine with an [adapter](http://www.amazon.com/Ceptics-Grounded-Universal-Adapter-Europe/dp/B007YL84VA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409056074&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=spain+travel+adapter). Just look on the power supply and it should say something like ""A/C 100-240Vac"". This applies to your phone charger, etc.

&gt; A Google translate app on unlocked smartphone can replace this. You can get a pay-as-you-go SIM and use data if you need a translation. If you bought your phone through a major provider this probably won't work for you.

Actually most major providers allow you to unlock your cell phones. Who is your provider and what kind of phone do you have? If you have AT&amp;T or T-Mobile, you are fine with any model phone as they are GSM. Sprint, VZW, etc is hit or miss because they operate on CDMA. Just call the provider and get them to unlock your phone for you. Then you can purchase a pre-paid SIM card from Amena or Vodaphone over there and just pop it in. You can also check with your provider about international roaming plans. When I went over there, they were extremely expensive but that may have changed. Also a smart phone will be invaluable even if you are not able to unlock it or use it on the local networks.

Le cannabis est quelque chose qui est privé (comme faire l'amour quoi), qui se fait entre ses quatre murs avec qui on veut.

true,LimitlessLTD,EURO,Brtish/European Citizen,"&gt; Its a shame that Russia went the path it went and countries, politicians, leaders and institutions never seemed to care in 90s, neither in early 2000s when Russian interests/positions were repeatedly violated/disregarded.

So you are saying that what Russia/Putin is doing now is in retaliation for what NATO and the west did after the USSR fell?

What do you think the next steps for Putin will be? Also are there many level headed Russians in Russia? They seem to be quite rare in /r/Europe (probably just shy because of all the Russian hate there is here). How easy is it to get non-propoganda news in Russia? (I mean news outlets that arent state owned).

true,coolsubmission,null,null,"&gt;Können wir wirklich sicher sein, dass die NATO hält was sie verspricht und die einzelnen Länder nicht den Schwanz einziehen oder anders okkupiert sind?

Ja, das hätte nur negative Folgen für die Länder und die NATO wäre de facto aufgelöst würden sie der Bündnisverpflichtung nicht Folge leisten. Für den Fall eines Angriffs hält die Bundeswehr btw. im Zuge der [nuklearen Teilhabe](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nukleare_Teilhabe) immer noch rund 20 [B61](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/B61_(Kernwaffe\))-Bomben beim Fliegerhorst Büchel bereit.

&gt;Was wäre, wenn Putin weiterhin seine jetzige Schiene fährt und als nächstes Polen angreift? 

Du gehst fälschlicherweise davon aus, das das irgendwie in Putins jetzige Schiene passen würde oder er ein irrationaler Expansionist wäre. Putin ist allerdings kein einsamer Irrer mit Macht, sondern ein ziemlich rationaler, wenn auch rücksichtsloser, Machtmensch. Er würde niemals in ein NATO-Land einmarschieren, da dieses einfach zu große Nachteile bis zur eigenen Vernichtung in sich birgt. Abseits davon ist Russland mit Europa und den USA so stark wirtschaftlich verknüpft, das ein Krieg gegen Europa, selbst wenn sie ihn allen Wahrscheinlichkeiten zum Trotz gewinnen würden, eine Niederlage für Russland darstellen würde. Davon ab ist die NATO Russland militärisch haushoch überlegen. Sie würden, selbst wenn sie sämtliche Geheimdienste austricksen und überraschend in Osteuropa einmarschieren nur wenige dutzend Kilometer weit kommen. Europa selbst hat schon einige dezente Armeen und die USA sind einfach nur lächerlich überdimensioniert was ihre Armee angeht. Die USA geben 7,5 mal soviel für ihre wesentlich modernere Armee aus als Russland. Grossbritannien alleine gibt fast soviel aus wie Russland. Die Kosten-Nutzen Rechnung geht da einfach nicht auf für Putin. 

&gt;Wären wir nicht ein logisches Ziel, alleine schon da wir durch die NATO eingreifen müssen?

Ein logische Ziel wofür? Sollte Putin ein NATO-Land angreifen wären wir ein legitimes Ziel als Kriegsgegner. Aber wiederrum, wenn er nicht bereit ist nuklear anzugreifen (was seine eigene Vernichtung implizieren würde) sehe ich da keinerlei Erfolgschance. 

 &gt;Bei den ganzen Krisen derzeit kann ich mit nicht vorstellen, das wir so gar nicht gefährdet sind, so als eine der führenden Mächte Europas.

Welche Krise und Welche Gefährdung soll es denn sein?
Russland wird nichts machen, das ist vollkommen ausser Frage mMn.
Der Rest hat noch unrealistischere Fähigkeiten zur konventionellen Kriegsführung -&gt; klappt nicht.
Asymmetrische Kriegsführung? Dazu fehlt in Deutschland die Möglichkeit unterzutauchen in der Bevölkerung/unwegsamen Geländes. -&gt; klappt nicht.
Einzelne Terroranschläge -&gt; könnten mit 'Glück' klappen, ist aber realistisch betrachtet eher eine 'Unannehmlichkeit' als eine ernsthafte Gefährdung des Bestands der BRD.

&gt;Davon mal abgesehen, wenn wir überraschend angegriffen werden, haben wir dann wirklich noch Zeit aufzurüsten?

1. Halte ich es für sehr sehr unwahrscheinlich überraschend angegriffen zu werden. Wir leben nicht mehr Anfang des 20ten Jahrhunderts. Große Truppenbewegungen fallen auf.

J'habite au-dessus d'un groupe de jeunes et ils en boivent comme des trous, ça gueule super fort tout le temps. Et les buveurs pourront me dire ce qu'ils veulent sur le cannabis, je maintiens qu'un mec qui boit de l'alcool sera beaucoup plus dangereux, surtout au volant.


L'alcool est quelque chose qui est privé (comme faire l'amour quoi), qui se fait entre ses quatre murs avec qui on veut. Le légaliser voudrait dire vouloir voir des gens faire des comas éthyliques dans la rue, demander des indications à un mec bourré (elles vont être supers les interactions dans la société, etc). C'est comme la religion: il y a des trucs auxquels les gens n'adhèrent pas et ça peut faire polémique. La messe se fait dans une église et l'alcool doit se boire chez soi.


Et puis finalement c'est détruire une économie pour une autre. La vente illégale d'alcool se porte bien et ce n'est pas nécessaire d'aller s'y servir. Le pays a d'autres choses à faire plutôt que de rendre tout le monde alcoolique sous prétexte qu'on a absolument besoin d'argent.


Quant à l'argument sur l'origine du produit, que ce soit par réseau privé ou issu d'une entreprise (pharmaceutique), il y aura toujours de la merde dedans. C'est pas en légalisant que vous allez vous trouver un moyen d'obtenir le meilleur alcool luxueux de la terre les mecs...


Voilà. Est-ce que tu comprends mieux pourquoi ton argumentaire tombe complètement à plat pour tout ceux qui ont déjà testé ou vu quelqu'un fumer en vrai ?


Que tu sois contre l'odeur, je peux comprendre. Personnellement je déteste l'odeur de la clope. De là à vouloir interdire le tabac, y'a de la marge quand même.


Quand à ce que tu dis sur les dangers du cannabis au volant, c'est [contredit par les faits](http://www.slate.fr/story/66097/cannabis-alcool-voiture-conduite-dangers). Tu peux avoir ton avis, mais les faits sont têtus, et l'alcool est nettement plus dangereux que le cannabis au volant. Pour autant je suis pas contre pour coller une bonne amende bien sentie et virer plusieurs points de permis à l'abruti qui prend le volant défoncé.


Si tu préfères l’expérience personnelle : j'organise des soirées depuis plus de 10 ans maintenant. J'ai dû plusieurs dissuader, voire prendre les clés de mecs ou filles complètement bourrés qui se sentaient ""très très bien, bien sûr que chpeux conduire !"". Avec les fumeurs de joints ? Jamais. Ils sont tout aussi incapables de conduire (voire d'ouvrir le coffre), mais ils s'en rendent compte.


Quant à l'économie parallèle qui se porte bien...je sais pas où t'habite, mais dans le 94, l'économie se porte très bien t'inquiète. Les vendeurs de coke peuvent investir de grandes sommes d'argent grâce aux bénéfices de la beuh. Des fois ils sont de mèche avec les politiques et ils font du trafic de gamins aussi. Ça marche tellement bien qu'ils peuvent s'acheter des flingues et même des kalachs pour foutre la trouille aux gens et aux flics. Ça serait dommage de leur prendre leur thune, pas vrai ?


Pour finir, l'argument de la qualité du produit. C'est quand la dernière fois que t'as entendu parler d'un type qui était devenu aveugle ou fou à cause d'une bouteille d'alcool frelaté ?

But let's say they could. It still doesn't matter for two reasons. The first is that having enough power to deter a broken regional power does not a superpower make. Remember, OP is asking about a ""sleeping giant"", not just a regular country. Besides, it's all well and good if European forces alone could force Russia out, but with American backing, the Russians won't even mount an invasion. 

Even more importantly though is that, regardless of how strong the western members of the EU are, no one else has faith in them. Even on this incredibly Eurocentric board, I honestly can't recall seeing anyone from eastern Europe who trusts Europeans to fight for them more than Americans.

Trying to talk as if ""The Left"" supports Russia is just not very accurate. Anyone who's spent time on the left knows that trying to get us to agree on anything is like herding cats, let alone support a regime like Russia. 

What the majority of the left *does* think, however, is that the Ukrainian government is literally just as bad as the Russian one, and that it's not really very relevant that Ukraine is being invaded as that doesn't change who the Ukrainian government is, fundamentally speaking, and therefore they're not worth supporting.

What's pretty much leading the charge on that stance is the fact that Svoboda had disproportionate government power and that Right Sector/Azov Battalion is allowed to exist, which gives incredibly ultranationalist/Nazi tones to the Ukrainian side, to which leftists are fundamentally opposed. It doesn't help that the Ukrainian government has attacked leftist ideology in a way not even Russia has attempted(yet). 

But make no mistake, the vast majority of leftists do not support Russia - organizations like WSWS(Probably the most obvious example of Russian shilling) are widely disliked amongst the leftists that *aren't* WSWS(Though that's because they're huge pieces of shit, not specifically because of Russia) - however, while leftists don't support Russia, that absolutely does not mean they support Ukraine.  

Most either don't know what to think, or think they're both incredibly shitty, or a few minorities think either Russia is still USSR in disguise and therefore it is perfect, or they think Ukraine is a brand new country that is on the path to great democracy and should be supported against evil Russian fascists.

I didnt realise we where talking about super powers (seeing as there is currently only 1, China isnt for a number of reasons, including lack of blue water navy and almost 0 force projection). 

&gt; Besides, it's all well and good if European forces alone could force Russia out, but with American backing, the Russians won't even mount an invasion.

I wish this comforted me, but the fairly blatant invasion of Ukraine and increased air activity near the baltics and naval activity near the North Pole dont really help your point.

Russia is a belligerent provocative and uncaring nation, its citizens are (increasingly so)fanatically patriotic, which can lead even the most stable person to do stupid things for the sake of ""muh country"".

&gt; Even more importantly though is that, regardless of how strong the western members of the EU are, no one else has faith in them. Even on this incredibly Eurocentric board, I honestly can't recall seeing anyone from eastern Europe who trusts Europeans to fight for them more than Americans.

This is due to Americas leading role in wars around the globe. It is united under one person/political position. The same is possible in the EU, but just takes time for people to get used to the idea.

IMO for the EU to be ""awoken"" as it where it needs a clear cut belligerent (Russia/Putin fits fairly well, just needs to continue to harass eastern european countries) and a politician that can gain the support of the EUs biggest countries (Germany, France, Britain, Spain and Italy are the biggest ones) and has good charisma (seems rare these days, only person i can think of with Charisma is Nigel Farage, and i fucking hate that guy).",0,1409065883,null,0,false,0,ck0xpha,t3_2ekfym,t1_ck0xpha,t1_ck0x8ey,null,1427350960,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,KGB_for_everyone,RUSS,༼ つ ◕3◕ ༽つ,"&gt; So you are saying that what Russia/Putin is doing now is in retaliation for what NATO and the west did after the USSR fell?


Its just one of many other factors, its not the ""one and only, root of all evil"" type of thing.  


This is my personal opinion, but i think Russian mental health was heavily damaged during perestroika/shock therapy and quite a number of our compatriots have a ""mess in their heads"". We lack national identity, we lack directions in which we want to go, we lack motivation to do anything meaningful or strive for any efficiency whatsoever, after all - we live from oil and gas revenue mostly. 

The only good things oligarchs good at is stealing other peoples money or businesses, meaning if someone creates a successful enterprise in Russia with decent profit, immediately pop-up local ""friends or protectors"" or if it was even more lucrative - oligarch who raid or ""acquire majority of control"" via not so legal practises. 



Naturally, Russian government officials are as efficient as U.S Congress, probably worse. To be completely honest i cannot name you a single reform in Russia which could honestly be labeled as ""successful"". Maybe i am ill-informed , but this is a general feeling in population - ""Leave us the fuck alone with your ""care"" and ""initiatives"" "".


In terms of economy, everything was going downhill before any Euromaidan activities, Russian economical model of living from oil/gas has reached its peak and our budget runs deficits with oil even at 100$ barrel, now it will be used as a convenient excuse and scapegoat for our own failures and missteps.


I don't know how many Russians on reddit there is, but this is pretty much the same as Russians in r/dota2, vocal idiots are easily noticed, people who are not interested in flame war just behave and try to blend in. I personally stopped visiting this sub for about 3 months and ""checked it out"" right about MH17 got shot down, i rarely comment anyways, mostly because people see Russian flair or opinion which differs from theirs and automatically label you as a moron, astroturfer, ""insert random isult here"". 


It is also worth mentioning that level headed Russians tend to express desire to leave Russia, there are enough polls out there with data, Russia is far from lawful place with ""fair rules, fair game"". They might not act on this desire, but they express it nonetheless, worth mentioning i think.


As for Putin steps, who knows? It all depends. For example i can see Russia leaving START treaties some time in the future if situation escalates, after all nukes are cheap and cost-effective deterrent. 


Yukos 50 billion$ fine was curious as well, i have a hard time believing that Russia will pay anything at all. I don't know the legalities and in which European/Western treaties Russia is engaged, but i can see us leaving them or acting extremely aggressive to any attempts to seize Governmental property. Maybe shareholders of Menatep group would have ""a clear case of suicide"" some time in the future. We are somewhat of a mafia state and if anything mafia is known for, it is the fact that no one likes when someone messes with their money. 


In terms of relations with European Union, current sanctions are damaging enough for Russian economy and will continue to damage it even more, mostly due to lack of access for ""cheap credit lines"". I expect Russian GDP to contract this year, inflation on food to skyrocket, taxes to rise, jobs to be lost, full scale economical crisis to be short. It was long due, structural reforms do not exist due to reasons mentioned above, so we are in for a tough ride. 


Are we going to ban machinery from Germany? Somehow i doubt it, after all, almost everything in terms of electronics is being produced in the West, nations without machines or means to repair them in 21st century are destined to fail. If we resort to China again, we will get crap **and expensive one**, beggars cant be choosers :)


It was also somewhat funny to read that Russia imports 80-90% of seeds for potato from Netherlands or something, talk about: ""lets help our agricultural sector"" and other things like sperm from animals to produce meat etc.


Basically Russian Government is **incompetent** and they have no *grand designs*, just stupid and short-sighted reactionary measures to boost domestic morale. 

I would still call Crimea annexation although a questionable move, but pretty well executed and i honestly think that if we did not pushed in Eastern Ukraine, West would have swallowed the pill. Putin pushed too far.


In terms of propaganda, i would say for a non-Internet user pretty hard, everything is state controlled, state owned or heavily influenced. It used to be a bit better, but serious pressure was exerted during Ukrainian uprising. Overwhelming majority of information is controlled is some way, filtered or blatantly misrepresented (lies). 


Even with Internet RosKomNadzor has done plenty of blocking anything with opposing views to ""general party line"", ofc you can still work around it, but its annoying. If you need a general sense of direction, probably Chinese Great Firewall.


I don't like Gorbachev. I can understand a Western feeling that he was great for you guys, united Germany, peace of our time and his actions led to what might be considered as a golden age of Western Civilization (up to date), but for Russians it was not all rainbows and unicorns. 

But as a politician he was quite weak, he went with both radical political and economical reforms and kind a failed in Russians eyes. I would say that he is right there with drunktard Yeltsin, a lot of people lost everything or almost everything, this is not something that is easily forgettable. Shock therapy was a disaster, 90s were a mess and term ""shitocrasy"" emerged (дерьмократия). A lot of disappointment, depression, despair and no one seemed to care how Russia was looted to the ground by crooks who stored their money abroad :) 


Btw i still fail to see any of London (or other place) ""new residents"" punished or expelled, this is a ringing bell for me personally that no one ever gave a fuck about Russian citizens at all. Ofc this is like an arms exports, if not you, then someone else will do it, such is the game :) 


I am also more and more disappointed with Putin approach and Government actions, i fail to see any coherent policy at all + nothing but desire to ""hide the head in the sand"". 


Sorry for long list of answers, complicated matters are hard to present in couple sentences and they would give quite an inaccurate viewpoint otherwise. (not that i think my views are accurate or represent majority of Russians, just a random opinion on the internet).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-ballistic_missile#The_problem_of_defense_against_MIRVs

&gt; i dont think that building defensive systems which make you less vunerable to a nuclear strike is the same as upsetting nuclear balance. 

I think it really is. much of the nuclear weapons arsenal is aimed at counter-force targets, which is to say, ICBM silos and the like, to limit the retaliatory strike that would follow. If you can shoot them in the air instead and limit the retaliation thus, you're achieving the same goal as you would have with more nukes. Effectively freeing your nukes to do more damage, just as if you built more missiles. This could provoke an arm's race. That was the worry by say McNamara at the time antibalistic systems first became a technical reality, and with time an Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty was signed, limiting the capabilities and number of systems each side could so protect. One system for each. US defending some counter-force for a plausible retaliation, USSR defending Moscow and ICBMs in its vicinity. Eventually US unilaterally withdrew from this arms control treaty, in 2001.

 Today many nukes are not on positions so targeted (but on subs), which ensures a second-strike capability to a country, as a deterrant from pursuing a first strike. But if you could withstand a limited retaliatory strike with the missile defense shield, first strike option becomes more appealing, a destabilizing effect.

Mutually Assured Destruction logic pretty much depends on both sides being totally open to being converted into a wasteland and not being able do anything about it with a first strike or otherwise. Given the stakes, ie medium term habitability of the only planet we've got, not something to be dinked around with at all.

Perhaps a way to do it is by simultaneously announcing reductions on your nuclear stockpiles to keep the balance in place, not sure. Re its strategic risks, some similar points are raised here:

The phrase ""sleeping giant"" pretty explicitly refers to a willfully weak state taking up the mantle of militarism. Specifically, the US transitioning from an economic power to a military superpower. If OP was just asking ""Will the EU ever be more united?"" or something like that, i'd have a different answer.

&gt; I wish this comforted me, but the fairly blatant invasion of Ukraine and increased air activity near the baltics and naval activity near the North Pole dont really help your point.

Putin is messing around in Ukraine and the Arctic because they're the only places he *can* do anything. The man is a a violent borderline fascist, and Russia is a belligerent nation, but there's nothing to indicate that they're Kool-Aid drinking levels of crazy. They're getting the jump on everyone who's not in NATO while they can, because they know that everything within NATO is off limits. The air shows meanwhile are just shows. They happen all the time, they just didn't get reported on because no one cared before now. 

Finally, I don't disagree that a belligerent outsider would go a long way towards uniting Europe into a single entity. The problem is that America needs to go away first.

Si elle a vraiment couché avec des journalistes pour avoir plus de notoriété et que l'on fasse plus de promotion de son jeu (ou des tests plus positifs), alors ce *Quinnsgate* ne sera que le dernier exemple des relations assez floues entre testeurs et éditeurs de jeux vidéo.

On a par exemple la chaîne youtube Yogcast qui veut un pourcentage des ventes d'un jeu si l'on constate une hausse des ventes après qu'ils aient fait des vidéos dessus (quelques semaines après la sortie pour que ce soit plus facilement mesurable), on a pleins de testeurs pros ou amateurs qui se font invités par les boites pour tester des jeux, qui reçoivent des goodies ou même des copies du jeu gratuitement pour en faire des reviews positives, **c'est** un problème et il ne faut jamais oublier de prendre tous les tests avec des pincettes (dans tous les domaines d'ailleurs).

Que des sites comme Kotaku (qui sont une vaste blague) ou des forums comme /r/gaming essaient d'étouffer l'affaire, c'est un autre problème puisque ce n'est pas la première fois sur Reddit que des modos (anonymes, dont on ne connait pas les liens avec des entreprises) abusent de leur pouvoir pour étouffer certaines histoires ou mettent en avant des liens vers des sites qui les ""parrainent""

I 100% agree, Crimea was strategic military base with legitimate Russian defence in mind when taken (only black sea port for Russia). But I dont really understand what Putin wants with Eastern Ukraine. Its oil and gas maybe? But Russia has plenty of that already.

&gt; Btw i still fail to see any of London (or other place) ""new residents"" punished or expelled, this is a ringing bell for me personally that no one ever gave a fuck about Russian citizens at all. Ofc this is like an arms exports, if not you, then someone else will do it,

Are you saying that Russian Oligarchs are fleeing to London with their money? Because when that has happened in the past [the FSB has sent their agents to deal with the ""traitors""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Litvinenko).

Also what would you expect the British government to do, send a person back to Russia, a country that has, at best a ""patchy"" human rights record. Under certain conventions Britain isnt legally allowed to return people to countries where their lives will be put in danger. Which is the case for many Oligarchs that flee Russia. You might see this as a flimsy excuse but the same applies to terrorists like [Abu Qatada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Qatada), and we definetly want to deport that fuck face.

&gt; complicated matters are hard to present in couple sentences and they would give quite an inaccurate viewpoint otherwise.

Im happy to read your insightful comments, i learnt a great deal.

[Rudy's](http://www.rudysbbq.com/page/home) is a fairly popular chain in Texas that most consider a good baseline for brisket joint. It maintains the authenticity of a Texas BBQ joint fairly well. Customers order meat by the pound and they are given however much bread, onions, and pickles they want. Also, BBQ sauce because it adds to the flavor, but is certainly not needed. If you cannot meet Rudy's level of quality, do not attempt.

Aside from Rudy's, most of the best BBQ joints in Texas are in the hill country... where the Germans and Czech settled. Bunch of small places with individual styles.

But here is a [nice map of local places](http://www.texasmonthly.com/eat-my-words/list-top-50-barbecue-joints) which are doing just fine alongside Rudy's.

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Plus the fact that US-UK relations would become extremely strained if there is another Iraq war type scenario any time soon.

There was, Syria. The UK rejected going in, whereas the French were game. People questioned whether this would be the end of the 'Special Relationship', but they couldn't have been more incorrect.

&gt; Obviously things would still be bad if relationships with the French became strained but that is much less likely to happen.

That is purely conjecture. There is nothing to suggest the US-UK relationship could turn sour much more than the UK-French one.

&gt; Why do you think it is a feature of modern warfare?

Without wanting to appear simplistic, its a feature of modern warfare because that's precisely the direction we are all heading. NATO and the  EU's CSDP both prioritise interoperability because, amongst other reasons, modern warfare is significantly more expensive than at anytime in history.

&gt; serve as auxillary forces for superpowers and forcing themselves to rely on other states with no way to enforce any obligations if things turn sour.

This is overly dramatic. Taking the UK as an example, the UK is nowhere close to being reliant on other nations. It is however stronger through its partnership with them (US mid-air refuelling being one example). The UK is not an auxiliary force of the USA. Syria proved that. Iraq should also be seen as evidence, but the UK media and population like to scapegoat our decision to send our troops to war on the USA (seriously - it was our decision, we should accept that).

&gt; How many alliances last for ever? How many times have former allies turned on each other, either diplomatically or in open warfare? I feel it is very naive, especially as the US isn't exactly to be trusted to do anything but serve their own ends if we look at it's aims and actions across the world since the end of WW2.

Again, massive conjecture. France and the USA have been allies for 100% of the USA's history. France and the UK have been allies pretty much since Waterloo. Stating ""nothing lasts forever"" is a very poor argument.

Regarding your final sentence, I would ask you what the USA has done that is so massively against UK interests since the end of WWII? Our military is stronger through cooperation with them, our respective HQs and educational institutions benefit from sharing our experiences with one another, Trident (whether you support or detest it) does make us stronger and is considerably cheaper than making our own.

So either find a lawyer that is willing to work for next to nothing or expect to pay serious cash (a consultation fee is up to 190 EUR, which is roundabout 1,8k EGP).

He will probably qualify for legal aid (both out of court - Beratungshilfe - and legal aid proper - Verfahrenskostenhilfe). Costs would be a 15 EUR flat fee for all out of court aid and correspondence. The application for Beratungshilfe has to be filed at the district court where the father lives. Forms are available online (http://www.justiz.de/formulare/zwi_bund/agI1.pdf). He can also ask a lawyer to file the application for him. To find one go to the bar association website of the city the father lives in (google city name + rechtsanwaltkammer) and search for a fachanwalt für familienrecht and filter by language. If you take that route and contact a laywer directly please make it perfectly clear that the mandate depends on legal aid being granted. Other than that the german embassy might be able to at least point you in the right direction and help you get things started.

Pretty sure Russia is playing the game, but i wouldnt say they are playing it ""well"".

The only thing Putin and Russia have gotten out of this is Crimea, which for me (a non-ukrainian) is fine. Its strategically important for Russia to own a black sea port and Crimea is the only one.

However, Putin failed to divide Europe over sanctions and is subsequently suffering horrible economic problems. Massive Inflation, Food shortages and the over reliance on natural resource revenues only make Russias recovery look bleaker.

That being said i am angry the west doesnt do more to help Ukraine. But as usual no one wants to go to war when Putin keeps dangling peace in front of us.

But, what we are seeing now is the decline of Russia.  With an ageing population, a mortality age of ~58, massive social, cultural and governmental problems and an over reliance on oil/gas revenue whose use is set to decline rapidly by ~2020. The only way for this mafia state to go is down. Unless they start to make some serious, **SERIOUS** changes.

EDIT: This is a quote from /u/KGB_for_everyone a Russian national.

&gt; I fail to understand how people are unable to see long term consequences of Russia's actions around the world.
For example with Crimea we ruined relations with Ukraine for a long time, scared Finland, gave an excuse for China for future ""protection of oppressed minorities"" possibly on Russian turf as well, created points of tension in relations with Central Asian republics + Belarus and Kazakhstan (Eurasian union used to be somewhat voluntarily organization, now we are ""messing"" with other nation borders, which makes you wonder).
China gas deal also look quite weak in terms of prices and we gave them plenty of trump cards to negotiate.
European partners also probably has reviewed their approach with Russia to a certain extent, but i obviously don't know much about that :)
Of course we also look like hypocrites on international stage, look incompetent with MH17 flight, captured Russian soldiers with documents and all that stuff. This does not look as a carefully constructed master plan to improve Russia's positions on world stage or in our own backyard, makes you also wonder what the fuck our Intelligence services are doing.

true,LimitlessLTD,EURO,Brtish/European Citizen,"&gt; The phrase ""sleeping giant"" pretty explicitly refers to a willfully weak state taking up the mantle of militarism. Specifically, the US transitioning from an economic power to a military superpower. If OP was just asking ""Will the EU ever be more united?"" or something like that, i'd have a different answer.

But the US wasnt a superpower when it was referred to as a sleeping giant, at that time there was a number of great powers but no definitive superpowers. Russia, Japan, Britain and America where all fairly equal in terms of military capabilities and force projection.

By the end of WW2 the US was an undisputed super power, along with Russia, but before that; not so much.

In that same sense then yes the EU could be a sleeping giant, it has some forms of military capability but nothing on the scale that the US has currently but it wouldnt take a particularly long time to get to the levels that the US is at. All that needs to happen is a push from outside and a strong leader (hopefully a German) to emerge and i think the EU could really be a superpower.

&gt; Putin is messing around in Ukraine and the Arctic because they're the only places he can do anything. 

But hes not only messing around with Ukraine and the Arctic, look at the interceptions over the Netherlands, Sweden, Britain and Japan. Look at the buildups of troops and weapons in its exclaves, transnistria and Kaliningrad.

&gt; The air shows meanwhile are just shows. They happen all the time, they just didn't get reported on because no one cared before now.

Not true, they are usually reported by that countries defence ministry and almost all of them are reported on in aviation websites.

&gt; The problem is that America needs to go away first. As long as the US is in a position to stomp out anyone who becomes a credible threat to Europe, Europeans will have no reason to coalesce into a more united front.

I disagree, America doesnt need to go away per se, just to leave NATO.

Ce qui m'avait le plus marqué, c'est que même les personnes qui étaient riches dans une partie de Monopoly commençaient à exhiber ces comportements, même si leur réussite était dû au fait qu'ils avaient tiré à pile ou face qui aurait des avantages énormes tout le long de la partie (2 lancers / tour, 2 fois plus de monnaie à chaque tour du plateau) et ce bonhomme en a tout les signes :p",0,1409072748,null,0,false,0,ck117uj,t3_2emd6j,t1_ck117uj,t1_ck0wwut,null,1427349322,6,false,france,t5_2qhjz,6

Ça me paraît beaucoup plus normal de voir des verres d'alcool dans un évènement publique (ex: un match de foot) plutôt que de voir des joints dans les mains de tout le monde dans un stade. J'espère que ça n'arrivera jamais.

Franchement essayer de détourner mon argument sur la vente illégale c'est très bas. C'est incomparable et juste absurde. T'achètes de l'alcool chez un dealer toi? De plus, oui c'est en effet en légalisant l'alcool qu'on trouve les meilleurs vins en France.

Tu mélanges tout en ce qui concerne les armes. Il n'y a pas moyen de faire ce débat sans mélanger tout et n'importe quoi. Arrêtez de comparer le cannabis à l'alcool.

Tous les produits chimiques qu'ils mettent dans la bière, etc. Y a pas assez de glucose-fructose et d'autres merdes dans les produits alimentaires, faudrait aussi en mettre dans la fumée évaporée?

true,KGB_for_everyone,RUSS,༼ つ ◕3◕ ༽つ,"&gt;This seems like an extremely weird thing from a former communist state. Surely it should be the opposite?


This is how Russian Government deals with problems, golden trio if i may:

1) Raise prices/Taxes.

2) Deny, Forbid, Restrict.

3) Shift the responsibility to population, avoid any accountability at all costs.  


Presented in every single piece of legislation, law or reform at least since 1998, maybe it goes even further in history.


People vastly overestimate desire of Russians for Communist state, nanny-state, complete and total regulation of every aspect of our lives. We just want a decent enough live with clear and simple rules, which do not change every 6 months. 


Its probably hard for you to grasp, but for example Russian pension system was reformed quite a number of times already, they plan to change it again and already froze ""accumulative part of pension fund"" for 2nd year in a row and expressed desire to abolish it. 


Basically Russia's laws change every other day, tax codes are constantly changing as well, everything is resembling ""a madmen in asylum during a seizure"", nothing even close resembling strategical thinking. It is sad to see how Russian budget is being ""forecast"" for 3 years in advance by our ministries only to change outlooks every 3 months or so (naturally downward trend). 


&gt; Do you want to leave Russia? and if so do you/will you ever have the means to?


I never seriously considered it, but i heavily dislike current trends :


1) Blissful ignorance (i don't know how much of that is genuine, for example on our local news site i started to think that a lot of people either are crazy or being paid to write idiotic comments which can be described as ""hoorah, patriotism!""). Hoorah patriotism is when we get sanctioned, ban food imports, involve ourselves in Ukraine and generally express a negative viewpoint of the west *and everyone approves of it*, sort a like ""yeah, we'll show them bastards! Glory to Russia!"".
 

I fail to understand how people are unable to see long term consequences of Russia's actions around the world.
 
For example with Crimea we ruined relations with Ukraine for a long time, scared Finland, gave an excuse for China for future ""protection of oppressed minorities"" possibly on Russian turf as well, created points of tension in relations with Central Asian republics + Belarus and Kazakhstan (Eurasian union used to be somewhat voluntarily organization, now we are ""messing"" with other nation borders, which makes you wonder).

China gas deal also look quite weak in terms of prices and we gave them plenty of trump cards to negotiate.

European partners also probably has reviewed their approach with Russia to a certain extent, but i obviously don't know much about that :)


Of course we also look like hypocrites on international stage, look incompetent with MH17 flight, captured Russian soldiers with documents and all that stuff. This does not look as a carefully constructed master plan to improve Russia's positions on world stage or in our own backyard, makes you also wonder what the fuck our Intelligence services are doing. 


2) Censorship and desire to avoid any public discussion of our problems (witch hunts, ""you are not patriot!"", ""you are state department agent or paid by CIA!""), ""everything is good in Danish Kingdom"", ""we are a quiet harbor"". Goes hand to hand with lack of accountability, people who failed national projects time and time again and shown nothing except ""hey we are a natural monopoly, lets raise prices!"" are still working in important positions, high profile cases are swept under the rug (because ties, corruption, buddies in crime etc).


3) General trend of blaming everything on others or lack of accountability. I dislike when i read that Sochi cost 50 billion dollars and *everyone is fine with it*  no one is in jail, all is well. Well guess what, Russian citizen, World Cup 2018 would also cost a shit ton of money. Russian summit in Vladivostok cost us 20 billion$, the new road which was constructed specifically for the event got ""washed away"" at least 3 times already. 


There are others of course like ""lets raise taxes"", a whole bunch of them. But back to topic of emigration, i don't think i represent a typical Russian, i was heavily exposed to Western world from at least 6 years when i got my ZX-Spectrum, now i am 27, i have stopped watching Russian TV about a decade ago because it was piece of shit, i tend to have a skeptical view and has grown into a cynic.


In terms of can i earn enough money to travel abroad and live there? Yes. Am i restricted in movements? No, we are not North Korea yet, neither Iron Curtain has befall on Russia, i doubt it will in the next year or two. I also have some responsibilities and tend to plan ahead, meaning if i were to decide to leave Russia, i would not live on streets in the next couple of months and would have enough information or funds to last at least half a year without serious cutbacks in standard of living, this requires time to accumulate funds, investigate possible destinations and other details. 

Plan ahead basically :)


Oligarchs and stolen Russian money stored abroad is a slippery slope and while from the point of Law Britain is following its hundreds year of judicial traditions, Russia seriously lack in that regard, thus Russians tend to favor Social Justice more. ""If its fair it does not have to be lawful necessarily"" type of approach.(Russians also respect Ordnung as in ""order"" quite a lot, which is why some people like Stalin a lot, since in their minds he was ""strong and fair leader with functioning state apparatus"")
