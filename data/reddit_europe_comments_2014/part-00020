You have a lot of culture inside of France and it's a lovely country with an extremely rich history, great food, great wine and you make some great films too.. But your export market for all those things is reasonably small.

The anglosphere is much more homogeneous culturally than the francosphere. For example, someone comes over from one anglosphere country to another anglosphere country and there's going to be very little culture shock and no one is going to think they stand out or don't belong. 

What happens in France when African francophones come over and want to live in France. From what I can tell, a clash of cultures which France is publicly dealing with at the moment.

*Frankfurt, Harare (dpo) - That's real solidarity! After it became known that Deutsche Bank had to suffer losses of 1.2 Billion EUR in the fourth quarter of 2013, people all over Africa have started collecting money.
The goal is to raise at least a billion EUR, so that the starving stockholders of Deutsche Bank will receive a decent dividend after all.*

I am donating 2 monthly wages so that the managers' bonuses don't have to be cut. That's at least 50 EUR.""*

true,Etular,UKGB,United Kingdom,"To most of your above post, I offer a quote from Edmund Burke:

""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.""

Whilst you might interpret such a quote as ""Therefore, we must combat 'evil' cultural differences!"", I take more of an interpretation in favour of ""To do nothing in a time of inequalities is to maintain such inequalities"". Whilst to do nothing is to ""normalise"" the issue, such may not be favourable insofar as inequalities still exist (and trust me when I say, dabbling even a little bit into the statistics shows that inequalities do exist - you, yourself, point at differences in culture to explain this).

On certain other points:

&gt; Believe it or not, a culture of vengeance is not good. Believe or not people should probably assimilate enough to function in the society they live in. We should not turn our country upside down so they can colonise us. That's not how immigration works.

A culture of vengeance may not be good, however, believe it or not, but the idea of assimilation also isn't seen as the most effective view, and certainly not something that you can force with legislation (on the contrary, to most sociologists I've read of who've studied the topic, trying to force people to integrate has a counterproductive effect in causing them to intergrate even less and become even more culturally defensive - Steve Bruce is the name of the first Sociologist who springs to mind).

As for the idea of ""assimilation"", I champion the Canadian ""cultural mosaic"" over the Western ""melting pot""; the former actually supporting the coexistence of different cultures rather than forcing them all to be the same. Such success is apparent when you look at crime statistics etc. - there's claims, for instance, that Toronto has one of the lowest crime rates in North America, for instance.

&gt; The Muhammed drawings are very different from this. They were drawn to agitate and provoke, and with good reason too. How can you not draw a picture of Muhammed? Because of their deluded religion? It's not real, so why should we care about it? Because they get up in arms and kill people over being oh-so-offended by a mere drawing? They're the ones at fault and they are ultimately responsible for the destruction they wreak - not the ones who make the drawings. The ones making the drawings are just pointing out to you have ludicrous and terrifying this kind of insanity is.

And, thus, we see your cultural ignorance, from an inherently Western, secular viewpoint. Their religion may not be ""real"" to you, but it certainly is to them, which explains why they were offended. A similar analogy would be (although I'm not sure if it has the same meaning in Denmark as the UK) that I wouldn't be able to burn a poppy or anything resembling a poppy (resemblant of soldiers) without causing such mass-riots (and trust me when I say, I have seen someone do so, and it was not pretty - they had their house burned down).

It's agitative because you're taking something that is intentionally a touchy topic for them, and trying your best to cause offence with it. If those drawings weren't culturally insensitive (and discriminatory towards Middle-Eastern culture), I don't know what were. Like with individuals, if you push a sensitive topic enough times, of course they're going to get pissed - to then go and say ""This is how barbaric they are!"" afterwards is inane.

&gt;EDIT: As for Janteloven, we never really lost that. It's probably one of the reason we're not so nurturing for those poor wobbly immigrants. They're not above us and they're not special either. If they want to come here they will have to live according to our laws and make an effort to integrate and assimilate. We'll help them with the latter two, but they won't get any kind of treatment a Dane won't get.

On the contrary, last I checked, Janteloven (which most, regrettably, will now say is ""outdated"") was meant to be an internalised set of beliefs, that ""You will not think that you are better than us"" etc.

Your people have access to the Nordic model and the welfare state that is a part of it, yet (like every other country everywhere) still have people getting in arms about immigrants using it, in the same way that every Dane has the ability to. 

Then, of course, there is the similar issue of ""Only a Dane is allowed to fully speak their mind in Denmark"", ""Only a Danish opinion really counts"" (including the application to religion, where the secular war against Christianity is mild at best), and ""If you don't like something that the country does, you can get out!"". That is hardly equality.

&gt; We all live in this world where people find racism where there is none more often than finding some where it is present. If you think any ""race"" needs special care or privilege, you are the racist.

And to top it all off, of course, a fundamental misunderstanding of racism.

Whilst it is true that race is a fairly recent conception (compared to the previous focus on nationhood as a form of discrimination), it's pretty universally accepted that ""racism"" as a definition refers primarily to the *negative* discrimination against a group of people.

This is in contrast to *positive discrimination*, which has been adopted by many socially-democratic and liberal nations who promote an *equality of opportunity* and have realised that, in minorities, there lacks such an opportunity to do as well as the majority. I support fully such attempts to give minorities a better education than they have currently, trying to improve their economic status and decrease their inclinations towards crime as a result of alienation, negative discrimination and the aforementioned lack of socio-economic status.",0,1390310782,null,0,false,0,cev10nt,t3_1vigfi,t1_cev10nt,t1_ceumtwl,null,1432037645,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;Britain's parliament even rejected the possibility of joining the US, its closest ally, in a possible mission against Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. 

Britain's *everything* rejected that idea, not just parliament and they did the right thing. Adding ""dictator"" to the sentence (and it's not like it's a secret that Assad is a wanker) just makes it sound like David Cameron put his feet up on his desk and said ""I love dictators, let's let this guy do his own thing!"" and not ""Oh, the entire country doesn't want to go into another pointless war, best not then.""

&gt; it remains to be seen whether German involvement in Africa will go beyond that of pure logistical support. Germans as a whole are highly skeptical of foreign combat missions. 

Does it though? It's not like Germany created GSG9 to sit around looking cool all day, it's fairly obvious the ""aid"" will be more than just supplies.

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"&gt;Ich hab zwar nie von Wachstum gesprochen aber OK. Das Inflationsziel der EZB ist 2% (Und das hält die auch mehr oder weniger ein) und solange die Löhne, Renten, Sozialleistungen usw. nicht mindesten auch 2% pro Jahr steigen sondern stagnieren (wie seit 15 Jahren) haben wir da effektives negativ Wachstum. Eine Steigerung der Binnennachfrage um 2% pro Jahr wäre ein effektives Nullwachstum. Also nichts mit unendlich oder so.

Schlussendlich bringt uns dieses Gerede auch nicht weiter, die Konjunktur wird unterm Strich weiter steigen und auch weiter schwanken. Das is normal und wird in einer Marktwirtschaft immer so sein. Stetes Wachstum is gut, aber man wird auch immer Phasen des moderaten oder negativen Wachstums haben.

&gt;Ja absolut. Die Arbeit liegt sprichwörtlich auf der Straße. Der Staat hat einen hochgradigen Investitionsstau in der Infrastruktur. Da kann man tausende von Stellen schaffen. Außerdem müssen viele Leute heutzutage aufgrund niedrigere Löhne mehrere Jobs gleichzeitig machen. Mit einem ordentlichen Mindestlohn kann man das verhindern und es werden wieder mehr Stellen frei. Wenn man dann noch unbezahlte Überstunden verbietet, kommt man der Vollbeschäftigung denke ich schon sehr nahe.

Einerseits richtig, aber bei unbezahlte Überstunden verbieten fängts schon an komisch zu werden:

1) unbezahlte Überstunden sind größtenteils verboten, irgendein Ausgleich muss immer da sein, alles andere ist nicht akzeptabel. Kommt natürlich auch auf den Arbeitsvertrag an.

2) Überstunden können auch in Freizeit bezahlt werden, wird afaik oft im Handwerk gemacht.

3) Überstunden werden größtenteils bezahlt nehme ich an, wüsste aber auch nicht inwiefern man das jetzt überprüfen kann, wegen Dunkelziffer &amp;so

&gt;Das Wort ""Untergang"" hab ich nie verwendet. Ich glaube auch nicht, dass Einwanderung alleine für unsere Probleme verantwortlich ist. Ich halte es aber für politischen Sprengstoff,  in ein Land einzuladen, in dem es den durchschnittlichen Bürger seit 15 Jahren konsistent immer schlechter geht. Denn am Ende werden diese Einwanderer nämlich dann zum Sündenbock.

Andererseits werden sie genau deswegen zum Sündenbock, weil du Ihnen den Status als Wirtschaftsschädling aufdrückst.

&gt;nicht wirklich gebrauchte Einwanderer

Das Demografie-Problem is auch irgendwie an dir vorbei, oder?

Schlussendlich hab ich jetzt[ einen Artikel](http://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/cps/rde/xbcr/SID-2A5C2FD7-9825CE24/bst/xcms_bst_dms_37927__2.pdf) gefunden in dem davon gesprochen wird, dass empirisch belegt ist, dass Einwanderung in DE schlechtenfalls marginal geringfügige negativen Auswirkungen auf einheimische Potentiale hat und bestenfalls empirisch belegt leicht positive Auswirkungen auf den Binnenmarkt hat. (ab S. 20 und Fazit S.31)

Grob zusammengefasst: Es ändert sich tatsächlich kaum etwas. Das ist genau die Abpufferung der Migration durch den Markt die ich in dem comment thread hier schonmal angesprochen hab.

Darin wird auch nochmal ausführlich auf Auswirkungen auf den Sozialstaat eingegangen, den wir bis jetzt ja komplett ausgeblendet haben.

Das ganze ist natürlich mit ""normalen"" Einwanderungsdimensionen errechnet, bei exzessiven Einwanderungswellen kann das sicherlich durchaus negative Effekte haben.

Dennoch: Alleine also wegen dem Demografie Problem kann unser **Sozialstaat**  zumindest im momentanen Zeitraum durch Einwanderung schon mal eindeutig richtig gut wegkommen.

&gt;Wenn wir wirklich irgendwann mal soweit sind dann kann man vielleicht wieder über Einwanderung nachdenken. 

Meiner Meinung drückt alleine diese Aussage schon dein Unverständnis und Sturheit in diesem Thema aus. Nach der Logik, dass Einwanderung in direkter Abhängigkeit Lohneinbußen der Einheimischen mit sich zieht, setzt einen starren Markt voraus.

Die Flexibilität des Marktes kompensiert Einwanderung aber bis zu einem bistimmten Maß. Und dieses Maß is atm ja wohl nichtmal ansatzweise ausgeschöpft.

Merci de prendre la peine de cliquer sur les liens avant de faire ce genre de remarques déplacées.

&gt;Quelques exemples, mais pas tous

Les garçons ont besoin de plus d'attention que les filles parce qu'ils meurent plus. Fais un tour en hôpital pour t'en convaincre.

C'est biologique : il naît 105 garçons pour 100 filles et à chaque âge les garçons meurent plus que les filles. La vie d'un homme est celle d'une lutte pour la survie et la procréation dès le plus jeune age.

Entre 0 et 24 ans, il y a plus de garçons que de filles (regarde une pyramide des ages). Il y a donc plus de compétition entre garçons pour être sélectionné par une fille. Ensuite, comme les femmes ont la ménopause, la compétition s'accentue vu que les femmes de plus de 45 ans ne peuvent avoir d'enfant et ne rentrent pas dans l'ensemble de gemmes désirables biologiquement.

Grosso modo les hommes de 18 à 55 ans voire plus sont en compétition pour les femmes de 18 à 45 ans voire moins. Il y a un déséquilibre qui ne sera jamais compensé et qui est en lien avec une fonction fondamentale de toute espèce : la reproduction.

Ainsi, sur une classe d'age, le taux d'infertilité chez les femmes (nombre de femmes qui n'ont pas d'enfant) sera de 10% contre 14% chez les hommes, avec évidemment un taux bien plus élevé pour les agriculteurs et les ouvriers (18%) et un taux beaucoup plus faible pour les cadres (3%).

Because if you seriously think its final version is changing anything you need to do a little more research. Who was asked how the Volcker rule should be implemented? Oh yes, the banks. Is this stopping them from doing risky investment? A little. Is it stopping them from sending money to subsidiary organisations, that then can do those trades? Nope, and it won't. There is too much money to bed made, and somebody has to bring that return on all the money invested by the super-rich. (Keep in mind the final version of the Volcker rule aren't even out yet)

&gt;You do if you have been notified. The law says that notification can be handed to your ""representative"" without definition what it means.

That's a bit of an issue, the law needs to be specific as possible, but the good thing is that you'll be notified the ""how"" doesn't really matter as long as it's done.

Although I'd expect it to be someone from the court, that's what I'd consider under ""representative"" anyway.

&gt;In criminal case without hard evidence of your knowledge about the existence of a case?

No, but that's not the case in Ukraine either - judging by your comment, you'll be notified of the case against you.

&gt; Anyway, these laws maybe would look not so bad if we had a fair justice. 

That's the real issue IMO, the law itself, while not perfect, isn't that bad if you assume it's followed fairly and as expected.

German post-WWII public opinion regarding war was that war is bad, so participating in it must be immoral. I can still remember debates about whether German participation in unarmed UN missions would be acceptable, or whether any kind of deployment outside NATO territory would inevitably lead down a slippery slope (""Salamitaktik""). Participation in Bosnia was a major breaking of a long standing taboo and resulted in quite a back-lash against the government.

From that perspective, we've come a long way (which I guess means the slippery slope argument had something to it), but there still are a lot of reservations.

We begin by taking two things that vary continuously as we wander around on the surface of the Earth. As you say, temperature works for that purpose, and another good choice could be pressure.

Now we ask ourselves the following question: can we cook up places on the Earth where these two parameters have the same values? For instance, it could be the case that the temperature in Amsterdam is the same as in Berlin, but perhaps the pressure is a little different, so that's no good: we really want both of those two things to be the same.

It turns out that the answer to the question is ""yes"".

true,Areat,null,null,"J'insiste sur le sujet des salaires parce que ce n'est pas la première fois que je vois ton message sur différents fils sur le féminisme, et que de mémoire celui çi se focalise en partie sur cette question, alors que les théories du genre ne s'y focalise clairement pas.                       
 
Cela revient souvent sous la forme d'annonce médiatique sur des écarts énormes entre les deux sexes, ce à quoi est à bon droit rétorqué que les différences de salaires à emploi et poste équivalent sont bien moins importants. Le problème est que ce contre argument certes véridique est souvent présenté comme mettant fin au débat. Or, même s'ils existent et se doivent d'être réduits, ces relativement léger écarts ne sont pas du tout le point sur lequel se focalisent les théories du genre.                          

Ce qui fait l'objet de l'attention des féministes à l'heure actuelle, ce sont les raisons qui amènent à cette situation où un individu ne se dirige pas de la même manière vers un emploi donné selon qu'il s'agit d'un homme ou d'une femme. Nous élevons très différemment nos garçons et nos filles - notre société toute entière traite radicalement différemment un petit garçon et une petite fille- ce qui les mènent en moyenne vers des carrières différentes, et celles choisies par les filles payent en moyenne moins que celles choisies par les garçons, et c'est là l'origine de ces grandes disparités de salaires.                       

Oui, à emploi égal, les hommes ne gagnent pas tellement plus que les femmes, mais *justement*, pourquoi est ce que les hommes et les femmes n'ont pas les mêmes pourcentages d'occupation d'un emploi donné? Hors emploi réellement physique, pourquoi il y a t-il beaucoup plus d'hommes ingénieur et de femmes assistante sociale ? Les théories du genre tentent d'analyser ces faits et concluent à l'importance déterminante de l'éducation de l'enfant,  même lorsqu'il est en bas age.                              

Tu me dit que les ""garçons ont besoin de plus d'attention que les filles parce qu'ils meurent plus"", mais quel rapport avec l'éducation? Parlons par exemple des faits analysés dans le lien que je t'ai fournis.   
Dans une école maternelle, les garçons sont-ils bien plus sollicités et encouragés parce que les professeurs se disent que les garçons ont plus de chance de mourir?  
Favorise t-on davantage certains traits de caractères justement énergiques chez les garçons parce qu'ils ont plus de chance de mourir ? N'est ce pas un peu contradictoire?                           

Les jouets des garçons et des filles sont ils à ce point sexués parce que les garçons ont plus de chance de mourir?                    

Non, cet argument n'a rien à voir avec les théories du genre. D'ailleurs, pour le reste de ton message, je ne vois vraiment pas le rapport entre pyramide des ages, fertilité à l'age adulte, compétition sexuelle et ce sur quoi se concentre les théories du genre : **Pourquoi éduquons nous radicalement différemment les enfants selon leurs sexes?**

true,Quetzacoatl85,null,null,"although I don't have any definite data on this, I have a feeling that the gender of closely related nouns plays a huge role in influencing the gender of a newly created or imported noun. for example, the gender of a German noun, which is the direct translation of a foreign term, would get copied over to that said noun if it's used as a loan word. let me try to elucidate that a bit with the help of console names, and other stuff:

* the PlayStation -&gt; German DIE Station -&gt; DIE PlayStation
* the XBox -&gt; German DIE Box, DIE Schachtel -&gt; DIE XBox
* the computer -&gt; German DER Rechner -&gt; DER Computer
* the counter (as in bank counter) -&gt; German DER Schalter -&gt; DER Counter


other nouns get their influence from the gender of a category of which they are an element themselves. for example, shop names normally take the male gender, probably because of the genders for the German nouns DER Händler or DER Laden:

* DER McDonalds
* DER Burger King
* DER H&amp;M
* also, in general, any store: DER Nike-Store, DER Handy-Store


sometimes it can be really random though. why is it called DER Nintendo 64 but DIE Nintendo Wii? also, since language is always changing and evolving, the majority of speakers is definitely having a regulating influence on people who maybe in the beginning used a different gender. staying with this example, at its introduction, I called that specific console DER Wii, probably stemming from DER Nintendo. DIE Wii just sounded plain WRONG in my ears. but since everybody else seems to be using DIE, I've heard it so often now over the last few years that lately I've caught myself using it too, and it doesn't sound wrong to me anymore. 


now if just somebody could give me a good reason as to why the new electronic currency should be called DAS Bitcoin, that would be great. (I saw that used in a newspaper article, but in my opinion, since it is DIE Münze -&gt; DIE Coin, it should clearly be called DIE Bitcoin, again, everything else just sounds wrong. but maybe that's just me...) ;)

Mr. Lavrov is referring to members of EU governments going to the protests.

All of you from former soviet states, could you imagine Russian diplomats participating in and encouraging a protest against your government? It would be completely unacceptable. 

Moreover, we always cheer these things from afar but when protests get violent in our countries it's very much unacceptable. I mean, the Spanish government just passed some very prohibitive laws against protesting and it made the headlines for a day.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Lavrov was specifically saying he found the idea of EU politicians showing up at the Maidan protests if their countries had diplomatic relations with Ukraine to be ""interfering"". This is because Lavrov considers the protests to be ""anti-government"" protests. So by Lavrov's logic, it is uncouth for a politician from a country on good terms with Ukraine (and by extension the government of Ukraine) to participate in protests against the Ukrainian government. 

This may sound whack, but it depends on how protests fit into your moral worldview. I suspect the majority of /r/Europe (myself included) does not see a conflict between loyalty to your country and protesting, because by supporting what you think is good for the country and participating in a democratic society, you *are* supporting the country. Plus, respect for country ≠ respect for the people running the show. 


However, the worldview of the Russian establishment seems to be that protesting specific policies or politicians of, say, Ukraine is the same as being anti-Ukraine generally. To Lavrov, the politicians he criticized might have well been holding signs that said ""FUCK THIS COUNTRY IN PARTICULAR"". While this has the pleasant side effect of stifling dissent, I don't think this worldview is completely to blame on corrupt politicians twirling their mustaches and laughing maniacally. I suspect that on some level they actually buy into the idea that this is how a good society is supposed to work.

true,AKA_Sotof,DENK,Denmark,"&gt;To most of your above post, I offer a quote from Edmund Burke:

&gt;""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.""

&gt;Whilst you might interpret such a quote as ""Therefore, we must combat 'evil' cultural differences!"", I take more of an interpretation in favour of ""To do nothing in a time of inequalities is to maintain such inequalities"". Whilst to do nothing is to ""normalise"" the issue, such may not be favourable insofar as inequalities still exist (and trust me when I say, dabbling even a little bit into the statistics shows that inequalities do exist - you, yourself, point at differences in culture to explain this).

So you can quote things. Bravo. Please come back with an actual argument because this is not one. There is a point where you have to stop hunting witches otherwise you will start killing innocent people as you already killed all the witches. 

&gt;A culture of vengeance may not be good, however, believe it or not, but the idea of assimilation also isn't seen as the most effective view, and certainly not something that you can force with legislation (on the contrary, to most sociologists I've read of who've studied the topic, trying to force people to integrate has a counterproductive effect in causing them to intergrate even less and become even more culturally defensive - Steve Bruce is the name of the first Sociologist who springs to mind).

&gt;As for the idea of ""assimilation"", I champion the Canadian ""cultural mosaic"" over the Western ""melting pot""; the former actually supporting the coexistence of different cultures rather than forcing them all to be the same. Such success is apparent when you look at crime statistics etc. - there's claims, for instance, that Toronto has one of the lowest crime rates in North America, for instance.

It does not matter if it is the most effective way. The end result we want is not a powderkeg of many different cultures. We want the nation as homogenic as possible because that is when it is most efficient.

&gt;And, thus, we see your cultural ignorance, from an inherently Western, secular viewpoint. Their religion may not be ""real"" to you, but it certainly is to them, which explains why they were offended. A similar analogy would be (although I'm not sure if it has the same meaning in Denmark as the UK) that I wouldn't be able to burn a poppy or anything resembling a poppy (resemblant of soldiers) without causing such mass-riots (and trust me when I say, I have seen someone do so, and it was not pretty - they had their house burned down).

This has nothing to do with a ""Western"" perspective. It has to do with a reasonable perspective. Of course their religion is not real. When they start killing, looting and murdering over a delusion they have a problem - not the ones who draw bloody cartoons. Also burning something resembling a soldier is much different to making a silly cartoon. You are essentially saying you wish to kill someone by setting them on fire. A cartoon of Muhammed is just making fun of a historical figure that happens to have a cult of personality.

&gt;It's agitative because you're taking something that is intentionally a touchy topic for them, and trying your best to cause offence with it. If those drawings weren't culturally insensitive (and discriminatory towards Middle-Eastern culture), I don't know what were. Like with individuals, if you push a sensitive topic enough times, of course they're going to get pissed - to then go and say ""This is how barbaric they are!"" afterwards is inane.

There's a big difference between essentially creating the message you that you wish to burn someone alive and criticising religion. If you cannot see that you are deluded as hell. They have a choice not to go and turn the streets upside down over a silly cartoon and they choose not to do that. It is not our fault that they decide to be barbaric. They have the freedom to not act in such a manner. Just because we provoke them with a silly cartoon does not make us guilty of their actions. The fact we can provoke them with something as petty as a cartoon should scare you.

&gt;Then, of course, there is the similar issue of ""Only a Dane is allowed to fully speak their mind in Denmark"", ""Only a Danish opinion really counts"" (including the application to religion, where the secular war against Christianity is mild at best), and ""If you don't like something that the country does, you can get out!"". That is hardly equality.

Try to read what I wrote again. They're not above us, but no where did I write they were necessarily below us. As you say yourself, the idea of Janteloven is that you are not above anyone else. 

&gt;And to top it all off, of course, a fundamental misunderstanding of racism.

Actually you are the one who misunderstand the term in its entirety. When a ""race"" gets any sort of benefit or discrimination solely from being that ""race"" you have racism. This whole idea of positive discrimination is ludicrous. You will never combat racism when you are essentially saying ""You are lesser than us, here is some help to bring you up to our level"". Positive discrimination is still discrimination, and it is still racism, sexism, etc. no matter where you apply it.

If you have a problem with many people struggling at the bottom of society you should instead look towards programs that help those people indiscriminately. If you choose to start discriminating you have become part of the problem and are as vile as the most hardcore sexist or racist.",0,1390317445,null,0,false,0,cev33bm,t3_1vigfi,t1_cev33bm,t1_cev10nt,null,1432038583,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Per bergamaschi, che spiega di aver ""segnalato, da imprenditrice agricola, più volte la situazione"", la rottura dell'argine è stata dovuta ""alla presenza di diversi buchi all'interno degli argini, fatti dalle nutrie e da altri animali"", che hanno reso fragili le strutture. Inoltre ""la manutenzione manca anche all'interno del letto del fiume"", continua la presidente, e questo lo ""può vedere chiunque"".

Nachgedacht und vorgelaufen wird auf dem Blog vorsichtig ausgedrückt wenig. Die Hälfte des Textes beschäftigt sich mit sich intellektuell gebender Sprachkritik ohne auch nur den Anschein eines Arguments zu liefern warum ""Einsatz"" jetzt so ein böses Wort ist.

Aber das ist ein Trend in diesem 'Artikel'. Es wird eigentlich nur suggeriert. Für den aufgeklärten Leser der ""Rationalgalerie"" ist das ja eh alles völlig durchschaubar. Er kann nur eins schlussfolgern: ""Schutztruppen im Goldrausch"". So der dämliche Titel.

Also es geht um Bodenschätze. Und um sich von der Ausbeutung dieser möglichst weit fern zu halten hätte Frankreich das Land Mali selbstverständlich seinem eigenen islamistischen Schicksal überlassen sollen. Man kann sich vorstellen wie dann geschrieben werden würde, dass Frankreich seine besondere Verantwortung als ehemalige Kolonialmacht nur zur Ausbeute und nichts anderem nutze. Aber das ist ja eh das Selbe, das haben wir nun gelernt.

In der ZAR dient dann die Gabe eines Diamanten seitens des früheren Herrschers an den vorvorvorvorletzten französischen Präsidenten als Hauptbeweis für die reine Ausbeutungssucht und Gier westlicher Staaten. Aber gut, die Welt ist schwarz und weiß. Militäreinsätze sind immer böse und giergesteuert. Das wissen wir ja spätestens seit dem Irakkrieg der ein riesiger Erfolg für die amerikanische Wirtschaft war. 

Nur bei den ganz schlimmen Situationen. Wo dann wirklich jeder denkt, dass 'man' was machen müsste. Da hätte dann... wer... die UNO intervenieren sollen? Die NATO auf jeden Fall nicht. Siehe Kosovo.

Ich seh in dem kompletten Bericht kein einziges mathematisches Modell, dass in der Lage ist quantifizierbare Vorhersagen zu machen.

Hamburg sold it to Kretschmer to prevent [Schill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Schill) to take advantage of it. Kretschmer stated he wouldn't change it. The city later changed the local zoning laws to assure it (and iirc there is also a paragraph in the contract which prevents easy gentrification). 

&gt;They can sometimes get violent which is what prompted the police presence locking down a large part of the area. That pissed off the lefty organizations even more and they rioted.

The police locked down due to an alleged attack of leftists(eye-witnesses tell another version) on a police station after christmas. The big riots were before christmas on the 21rd December. There was a big demonstration planned to protest for the preservation of the Rote Flora and the Esso Häuser as well as the right to stay for the Lampedusa refugees who are in church asyl in St. Pauli. The police however blocked the demonstration after ~ 50m and then the rioting began.

edit: To OP: I would recommend reading the wiki article of: [Rote Flora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rote_Flora), [St. Pauli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Pauli), [Bambule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambule) as well as [Hafenstraße](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafenstra%C3%9Fe)

To further answer OP's Questions:


&gt;Is there still a lot of anger? 

Yes, but mainly in leftists/centre-left circles. Conservatives also, but more so about the riots. However i wouldn't expect any bigger riots soon apart from 2-3k demonstrations with a tiny bit of police vs protesters fighting.

&gt;Is it economically related like the Occupy Wall Street protest?

Not as general as the OWS. It's more about local gentrification issues and introducing racial profiling crackdowns on lampedusa refugees in the same time as ~400 refugees dies in the mediterranean sea right in front of Lampedusa, shedding a light on the migration politics of the EU.

When it comes to agriculture Norway is really bad. The agriculture sector is run by cooperatives and monopolies. There are quotas for production and farmers get 60% of their wage from the government. I hope the new minister of agriculture can clean up this mess.

If it were a private company and there was competition other producers would come in and provide butter. Also if the import tolls were lower butter could be imported. But Tine is too greedy for that shit.

That is very true, and crucial. We have learned a lot until now in terms of how important it is to include civil society in the accession process, and how important it is to represent something positive, something to look for. If to be an EU member is a positive thing, then we need to prove it.

We also need clear, scientific assesment of progress, although it should be noted that political will is just as much important.

&gt; Russia who are seeking a weakened dependency that they can sell oil to reliably and a buffer against the spread of their imaginary enemy

I agree with what you said except the 'imaginary' part. The 'color revolutions' in Yugoslavia, Central Asia and Ukraine all have the same same smell.  Zbigniew Brzezinski was a national security advisor to Jimmy Carter and recommended Russia to be surrounded in his book The Grand Chessboard. That project doesn't seem to be outaded looking at these events. 

The Baltics joined NATO despite the US telling Russia they wouldn't. I wonder how the US would feel about having Mexican missiles just next to their border.

&gt; im honest the EU has done far more to protect me from the ravages of bankers and big business than my government in westminster has ever tried to do

That is understandable since you're not using the euro but still...

* article 123 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU forbids states from borrowing from themselves at 0% interest rates, they now have to turn to financial markets, who ask for an interest rate

* article 63 forbids states from restricting capital movement within the EU and between the EU and third states like China. This puts you in direct competition with extremely low-wage labour, and states who haven't accepted the same labour protection, wage policies and capital flow regulations. 

You respect the rules, they don't. You lose your job because you can't compete with wages up to 50 times lower than yours, workers in China still suffer from their situation, all for the greatest benefits of big business. That's not to say the goverments aren't at fault here, they're the one who accepted this asymmetric free trade agreement.

&gt; Im also allowed to criticise it viciously for stupid things like the strasbourg movements 

Of course you are, discussing irrelevant and non-strategic topics is allowed and even supported by the media at the service of the powers that be. Feel free to talk about this, just not about what really matters.

The media only allows people criticizing the system if they also have extremist positions with regards to immigration. Is that the real issue ? No.

Try having any big media exposure after creating a neutral, moderate, political party that wants out of the EU for example, see how fast you're ignored, ridiculized or assimilated with the extremists.

&gt; According to Austrian media the man initially claimed that the woman had offered him sex

She claims she was raped but the man said she consented. Who to believe? If there was no evidence that she was raped then obviously there can be no conviction.

In addition, this article is misleading and has several basic errors.

&gt; But once they had walked into an underground car park underneath a five-star hotel in Yemen

Did this take place in UAE or Yemen? They are different countries.

&gt; Just last year a young Norwegian interior designer Marte Deborah Dalelv was sentenced to 16 months in prison after suffering a similar fate and being raped and convicted of sex outside marriage.

That was actually never legally a rape case. Dalelv was only sentenced [because she told police she lied about being raped, and the sex was consensual](http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/courts/facts-behind-the-headlines-of-the-marte-deborah-dalelv-dubai-sex-case). This was on the (bad) advice of her employer. 

Consensual sex outside marriage is sadly illegal in Dubai, which is why she was sentenced, plus an extra 3 months for perjury (lying to police). 

If she had stuck to her rape claim, she would never have been sentenced. Rape is illegal in Dubai and victims of crime are obviously not punished for it. 

&gt; In the United Arab Emirates, as in some other countries using Islamic law, a rape conviction can require either a confession, or the testimony of four adult male witnesses. 

This is not true. [There is no requirement for a confession or four witnesses to prove rape](http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/international-coverage-of-uae-law-ignorance-is-no-excuse).

This is true, except that Work is not a unitary thing. The advantages of an EU workforce are higher education levels, more specialist knowledge and generally better at english. 

I live and work in Germany for instance for a german company so I do actually get affected by the fate of the Euro pretty heavily, I took someones job most likely, but thats because of the skillset I have and the money that I make for the company. But my skills are going to be equivalent to another candidate for the role, and that candidate will have probably found a similar role somewhere else. Im personally lucky enough that Im not competing with some peasant who will work for nothing. But I moved because young labour in the UK are screwed and probably will be for at least the next 5 years. And im not going to sit around and wait for them to sort it out while my life wastes away. 

I can understand Its a LOT more of an issue in Low Skill occupations, and If im honest I cant answer that question personally. To me I agree the EU should be looking at restricting free movement of labour especially in low skill areas. 

If im honest on the geostrategic thing. I dont really mind if the US is getting involved if they arent backing the authoritarians. All of these struggles come down to a side that wants to control the other using the levers of power, and Ill always personally support the side that is pushing back against that, the US's past actions dont enter into the equation for me because I only care about whats right in this specific case.

No way. They are neither naive nor idiots. They understand fully that the EU politicians are against the regime, not anti-Ukraine. They also understand what the EU is really doing - informing the oligarchs who hijacked Ukraine's economic and political life that their aspirations of legitimizing their ill-gotten wealth and being able to use it outside of Ukraine depend on them dropping support for Yanukovych if he crosses the line.

true,mberre,UNSA,United States of America,"well, if you ask me, I don't see it as a ""north vs south"" issue. It's more of a Germany's interests (tight monetary policy) vs. everybody else's (who would more benefit from an anglo-saxon monetary style). 

EBC wrote a working paper in 2011 pointing out that the deeper the crisis got, the wider the sovereign risk premia get (indicating that the more capital fleeing was moving towards Germany from ALL other EZ members). 

What that means is that despite what the media says about Spain and Portugal, the economic figures indicate that Germans are getting subsidized by the Euro at the expense of the other members, but since we are talking about capital flight and borrowing costs rather than direct transfers of money at the national level (the latter of which is easier for the lay-press to understand). 

In terms of national interest, it would certainly have been a good idea from any of the economic stable countries whose econ would be large &amp; insulated enough (like France) to have exited as early as 2009. The result would have been a short-lived recession as incoming capital temporarily dried up (iceland recovered in two years), but this would have come at the expense of other EZ members. 

A German exit on the other hand would have resulted in their currency becoming extremely expensive, and this would basically have killed their export market (as the world's no. 2 exporter, this would have lead to a sharp recession in Germany). Furthermore, the financial markets (which are generally very pro-cyclical) would have panicked, making the recession even more severe and longer-lasting. 

A Finnish exit would kind of like the French one I described above I think, except that its impact on the EZ would be smaller.

Mais si je peux me permettre, ce texte me troue le cul sur plusieurs aspects:

* Tout d'abord, la manière dont le sujet est amené invite sérieusement le lecteur à se demander qui est derrière tout ça? Les femmes sont moins considérées que les hommes, ça on l'a bien compris, mais par qui, bordel?

* Ce qui nous amène à mon deuxième point. Il est mentionné dans ce texte que les filles auraient un traitement différent des garçons dès la crèche. Or, une statistique évidente montre que les femmes sont largement représentées dans les professions de la petite enfance. Ce texte nous inviterait t-il à penser que les femmes sont les propres actrices du privilège masculin? Ça n'a aucun sens.

* Vient le troisième point et la bonne vieille rengaine des sous-représentations des femmes dans les études scientifiques. Donc le privilège masculin, ce serait des femmes qui n'iraient pas vers les sciences? Mais donc serait-il mauvais de penser à parler de privilège féminin étant donné leur large domination dans les domaines littéraires? L'argument est fallacieux et il n'y a ABSOLUMENT pas de lien de cause à effet. Soyons sérieux deux minutes, les hommes et les femmes sont bien évidemment différents -sans relation de supériorité- car nous sommes différemment constitués génétiquement. Mais faut pas raconter des niaiseries.

En conclusion, le sexisme existe, il doit être condamné et éradiqué; que ce soit du sexisme envers les femmes ou les hommes. Ceci dit, les hommes et les femmes sont éminemment différents dans leur constitution. Où est le privilège masculin de dire qu'une femme est corporellement différente d'un homme?

Notre système pénal et civil, les forces de l'ordre, et les entraineurs sportifs justifient que l'on associe machinalement le sexe d'un nourrisson avec sa force physique ? Excuse moi mais tu n'as pas un peu l'impression de partir hors sujet, là ?                            

&gt;Parler de privilège masculin est ridicule. Si les femmes se retrouvaient soudain à être un forte majorité en prison, une forte majorité à perdre systématiquement la garde de leurs gosses et à devoir payer des pensions en cas de divorce, à être systématiquement l'être fort qui abuse de l'être faible lors des problèmes judiciaire... bah, on parlerait pas de privilège féminin. Même l'abus sexuel est un peu mignon et coquin quand il est commis par une femme.          
                
Parler du privilège masculin dans certains domaines n'empêche pas de parler du privilège féminin dans d'autres, et inversement. Le fait est que ces mêmes différences d'éducation des enfants dès leurs plus jeunes ages conduisent également aux problèmes que tu cites. L'association garçon/agressivité qui influe sur les comportements et plus tard pénalise judiciairement les hommes, ainsi que l'idée que c'est en priorité aux femmes de s'occuper des enfants, aux détriments des hommes lors de divorces. Et la façon dont notre société considère le viol des hommes est vraiment à vomir.                  

Maintenant, je le répète, parler des privilèges des uns n'empêche pas de parler de ceux des autres, et surtout ça ne les justifie pas. On a parfois un peu l'impression dans ce genre de débats que citer une discrimination contre l'un des deux sexes ""compense"" aux yeux de certains une situation défavorable pour l'autre.             
   
Il manque vraiment en France une association pour l'égalité des sexes, au sens de la lutte contre les stéréotypes dans les deux sens.

true,Etular,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; So you can quote things. Bravo. Please come back with an actual argument because this is not one. There is a point where you have to stop hunting witches otherwise you will start killing innocent people as you already killed all the witches.

If you think the witches are all dead, then you're more than deluded. The witches will never all be dead because it's very difficult to ""kill"" a belief; especially one that, even now, is so ingrained into the norms and values of modern society. Such a statement is, ironically, in complete contrast to the rest of your post.

Ofcourse, then we have normative ethics coming into play as to how we ""define"" a witch. No matter which standpoint you take in that respect, you will not find a position justifying the belief that ""Racism is dead and buried"", because it quite simply isn't.

&gt; It does not matter if it is the most effective way. The end result we want is not a powderkeg of many different cultures. We want the nation as homogenic as possible because that is when it is most efficient.

I disagree, and you seek only to justify a statement I made earlier - that individuals who are openly racist would never dare admit it, simply because it's so socially unacceptable. That, however, doesn't make them any less racist in their views. To cite you earlier:

&gt; Also just want to note that DF does not ramble about ethnic homogeneity. If they did then we may actually start to seriously call them Nazis.

Without wishing to delve too much into an argumentum ad Hitlerum - as it's used far too often, and has quite the negative reputation - but it's pretty obvious that there are parallels. ""But one is about culture and the other about race, so they are not comparable!"", you may cry, but what does that even mean? ""We don't hate you because you're Black, Asian or Arabic; we just hate you because you're not Western""?

Besides, how would you even define ""efficient"", and how does a lack of homogeneity fit into that definition? I would argue that plenty of the most famous and successful European states are far from homogeneous - Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland; all merely a collection of city states, rather than some united whole sharing norms and values, and all only very recently defined as unified ""countries"".

&gt; This has nothing to do with a ""Western"" perspective. It has to do with a reasonable perspective. Of course their religion is not real. When they start killing, looting and murdering over a delusion they have a problem - not the ones who draw bloody cartoons. Also burning something resembling a soldier is much different to making a silly cartoon. You are essentially saying you wish to kill someone by setting them on fire. A cartoon of Muhammed is just making fun of a historical figure that happens to have a cult of personality.

You claim it's ""reasonable"", then go on to say that their religion isn't real (with a lack of evidence to justify such a claim); support both the disrespect of aniconism **and**, even more notably, the links of Muhammed to Islamic terrorism in the article, whilst then claiming that disrespecting soldiers is something completely different? How can you sit/stand/lie there and try to justify such exceptionalism?

How can you even make a comparison that burning a flower is suggestive of wanting to burn soldiers (who are, in effect, paid legal murderers) to death? You claim such a suggestion is no stretch of the imagination, and worthy of mass-condemnation, whilst defending your ""right"" to call an influential Muslim leader (not just a religious leader, but a political one, who helped foster progression within the Middle-East) every accusation people can think of, and depict him as some offensive cartoon caricature, of all things? 

Ofcourse, ""reasonable"" and ""rational"" would be the first two words that certainly *wouldn't* come to mind about your standpoint on the matter, and I'm running out of analogies to make that you wouldn't either accept as reasonable or say ""It's nothing like that!"" to.

&gt; There's a big difference between essentially creating the message you that you wish to burn someone alive and criticising religion. If you cannot see that you are deluded as hell. They have a choice not to go and turn the streets upside down over a silly cartoon and they choose not to do that. It is not our fault that they decide to be barbaric. They have the freedom to not act in such a manner. Just because we provoke them with a silly cartoon does not make us guilty of their actions. The fact we can provoke them with something as petty as a cartoon should scare you.

I've already laughed at your absurd suggestion (""Burning flowers = wanting to burn soldiers; because flowers have a connotation with dead soldiers""; by the way, does burning a flag mean you want to burn a country down?), so I'll address the other aspects of the above paragraph.

You ignore the fact that they're obviously offended, and want to express their dissent like people generally do - through protest (although, even nowadays, respect for Gandhi and Luther King's methods is patchy; and we're often more than supportive of their violent protests if it means overthrowing their governments); but such ""barbaric"" actions can even be seen from your side of the fence - The [Insert-Country-Here] ""Defense League""s, the Swedish ""Democrats"", individuals such as Breivik (who most people will dismiss as ""the exception"", because ofcourse they do) etc.; all those people who actually go marching about, targeting minorities to assault out of ""duty"" for their ""country"". You hardly have a moral high-ground.

The fact that people can get peeved at cartoons doesn't surprise me, because many people do get peeved at works of art and writing. I get peeved at anyone who says ""I love Ayn Rand"", or ""I believe in the Elders of Zion"", and sometimes feel the desire to kill them out of my duty to seek the improvement of society. 

I don't find it surprising that people will get agitated over it, and find it surprising that other people are surprised by that - you'd have thought that people would learn by now that such is what happens, and have decided to be respectful and not do it again, instead of ""Hey, we've made 'em angry! Let's piss 'em off some more! DANMAG!"". 

If this took place on an individual level instead of state level, you would rightfully be seen as a dickhead, because that's what happens when you take the piss out of other people's beliefs and try to force them to conform to your own.

&gt; Try to read what I wrote again. They're not above us, but no where did I write they were necessarily below us. As you say yourself, the idea of Janteloven is that you are not above anyone else.

What I wrte is, following that same logic, you shouldn't be above them either. If you believe that you are above them, then that needs justified in terms of Janteloven; if you believe you aren't above them, then you need to justify the evidence that points against that statement.

&gt; Actually you are the one who misunderstand the term in its entirety. When a ""race"" gets any sort of benefit or discrimination solely from being that ""race"" you have racism. This whole idea of positive discrimination is ludicrous. You will never combat racism when you are essentially saying ""You are lesser than us, here is some help to bring you up to our level"". Positive discrimination is still discrimination, and it is still racism, sexism, etc. no matter where you apply it.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have a problem with many people struggling at the bottom of society you should instead look towards programs that help those people indiscriminately. If you choose to start discriminating you have become part of the problem and are as vile as the most hardcore sexist or racist.

I agree with you up until the last sentence - the most apparent/noticeable problems of racism *at the moment*, as I mentioned, tend primarily to be socio-economic; thus, the solution should also be socio-economic, in decreasing that level of inequality.

However, the reason I disagree with your last sentence is that attempts to be ""counter-racist"" still attempt to and succeed in bridging the gap - both consequentially and in terms of virtue ethics (which focus on intention), this is morally sound.",0,1390324774,null,0,false,0,cev67v8,t3_1vigfi,t1_cev67v8,t1_cev33bm,null,1432040059,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Just to be clear, the Aquis Communotaire  is the accumulated body of EU law (or at least it was called like that when I was a student). 

But okay, the reason why is of course a question of national interest. The EU is only credible if its able to maintain it's own stability. 

On top of that, the fact that the Aquis Communotaire restricts a lot of the crisis management that the individual members can legally do, creates the obligation for the EU's crisis management institutions to actually do their jobs. Otherwise, it would really not be in the national interest to actually abide by the Aquis Communotaire in the first place. 

The law works this way on all levels. In order for the law to be viable, people have to be willing to follow it. In order for that to happen, the state has got to deal with the second-order problems that the law creates. 

&gt; Are you referring to the ECB.

Well, in part. But actually to the totality of EU institutions. Keep in mind that the Vienna Initiative which rescued eastern europe was undertaken by the until-then little-known EBRD. Having the EFSF and the ESM jump into action quickly might have been useful for instance. Expaning the EBRD's mandate to also cover southern europe might also have been useful.

There are few reasons for that. Mainly because historically there were a lot of cultural and trading ties between two peoples.

Even thou those territories were never Ukrainian and populated by ethnic Russians.

&gt;pourquoi est ce que les hommes et les femmes n'ont pas les mêmes pourcentages d'occupation d'un emploi donné?

Parce que les hommes ont besoin de gagner plus pour avoir une femme puis des enfants. Si tu n'as pas d'argent, tu as plus de chances de rester seul et qu'un homme qui gagnera plus prendra ta place, comme en témoignent les taux d'infécondité que j'ai donnés.

*edit : Ensuite, il y a des raisons purement productivistes : j'ai bossé dans une usine, et après de nombreux tests il s'est avéré que les hommes étaient meilleurs que les femmes quand il faut travailler dans l'urgence, tandis que les femmes étaient meilleures pour fournir un travail régulier.

&gt;quel rapport avec l'éducation?

Tu ne vois pas le rapport entre éducation et attention des parents puis du système éducatif ?

Quand tu parles d'éducation, tu veux dire niveau d'études ?

&gt;Dans une école maternelle, les garçons sont-ils bien plus sollicités et encouragés parce que les professeurs se disent que les garçons ont plus de chance de mourir?

Ils sont plus sollicités car ils sont en retard et veulent moins s'exprimer oralement. Les gênes responsables de la communication et de l'empathie semblent moins présents chez les garçons, et [semblent liés à la présence de testostérone dans le foetus](http://www.autisme42.org/spip.php?article25). D'ailleurs, [l'autisme est une maladie principalement masculine](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autisme#En_France) (à 80%).

&gt;Favorise t-on davantage certains traits de caractères justement énergiques chez les garçons parce qu'ils ont plus de chance de mourir ?

Ils ont non seulement plus de chances de mourir mais également moins de chances de se reproduire s'ils survivent. Les adultes apprennent aux enfants à survivre et à être forts pour se reproduire. Il est donc tout à fait rationnel de consacrer un part plus importante de son temps pour ceux qui auront à faire face à une concurrence plus intense. Ça n'a rien de contradictoire : un homme timide et faible a moins de chances de se reproduire qu'un homme fort et charmeur.

&gt;cet argument n'a rien à voir avec les théories du genre

Si. Et l'argument de la reproduction que tu as tout à fait ignoré.

On fait en sorte que nos enfants aient le maximum de chances de survivre et de se reproduire. C'est pas compliqué à comprendre c'est la base de la [sélection sexuelle](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9lection_sexuelle), qui fait partie de la théorie de l'évolution :

I posted something on my IamA which I'd prefer to post here.

Russia is a massive country and its interest lies in Ukraine because of its geopolitical location, and most importantly because of its culture, language and the demographics we have here. Half of Ukraine was formed after giving away by Russia. Crimea, and Eastern area (Donbass, Kharkiv) in the 50s.
Joining the Customs Union is not as big deal as hyped out to be - since its purely an Economic union. And as for association, please read 900-page report and then come back with what was offered to Ukraine and what it could really do.

The truth is, Ukraine needs Russia. If not, we just offered over $12 Billion worth deposit to Ukraine, to cover its impending debt which it had to pay back in 2014-15. This debt was taken from IMF in 2009.

China brought a huge area roughly 5% of Ukraine for $8 Billion, renting it for roughly 30-50 years.

All this simply because Ukraine needs money. Please bring something to the table and stop acting like a pissed off younger brother, and act like an adult.

Sorry if it sounded like a rant, because it was. I'm someone who has very closely introspected into the details of the Association Agreement and Russia-Ukraine relations, and without any political bias, I can tell that Ukraine must understand its priorities, clean its mess at home first, build better politics and motivation in people and then be ready to spit on others.",1,1390326851,null,0,false,0,cev77js,t3_1vr928,t1_cev77js,t1_cev07p7,null,1432040640,-10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-10

Dazu käme dann noch die Elektronik im Umkreis der Basen, aber das ist im Gesamtbild geringfügiger Kollateralschaden.

Hierzu nötig ist lediglich die Entwendung eines halben Dutzends B61-Nuklearwaffen, die allem Anschein nach auch immer noch in Deutschland gelagert werden, d.h. man muss nicht mal weit reisen um sie zu bekommen. Zu beachten wäre lediglich, dass man einen Bombentechniker benötigt, der einem die gewünschte Explosionsstärke vor Verwendung einstellt - variabel von 0,3 (0,02 Hiroshimas) bis zu 340 Kilotonnen (22 Hiroshimas). Es sollte nicht zu wenig, aber auch nicht zu viel sein. Solche Bombentechniker müssten auf der Basis anzufinden sein.

Anschließend muss man auch noch ein Flugzeug besorgen (könnte man praktischerweise auch sofort auf der selben Basis erledigen), die Sicherheitssysteme der Bomben umgehen und deaktivieren, sie scharfmachen und ihren Zündungsmechanismus so ändern, dass sie in luftigen Höhen und nicht auf der normalen airburst-Höhe detoniert.

Sollte machbar sein.

For instance, EA's origin platform uses my gmx email adress as username and I chose a password that I only ever used for that account.   
  
Now, they say they have captured email adresses along with *a* password. But nobody knows where this password belongs. So, say you just change your email accounts password, the password contained in this cache might be the one you used on facebook. Or virtually any other account where you log in with your email.

1) State *when* these accounts were found to get a rough estimate how long ago the ""incident"" occured  
2) Tell us exactly where they got the information so people would know if this data stems from Facebook, or Origin or different Email provider themselves etc.  
  
I know many people use email adresses specifically for a certain online platform. Like mystandardnick+ebay@bla and mystandardnick+amazon@bla and so on. If it were known that the information they obtained contained such email adresses we woudl know *what* system was compromised.  
  
Hell, some people try to tell you if your email happens to be contained in this cache that your PC has malware on it that might have snatched the PW. But I already read of people who use Linux so the malware situation sounds unlikely. Especially since it is 16 million adresses. That person also stated that he tested several other email adresses of his and only one was found. But he logged into all of his email adresses from that Linux PC so in case there actually were malware isntalled, his other accounts would have had to be compromised as well.

the characters of IASIP are brutally mean to each other to the extent that they might have psychotic traits. They can make you cringe and feel honestly bad for themselves and it is more of a tragic comedy show on the misery of life. 

aida is plain boring (to me at least), it leverages on cultural cliches (the old woman, the unemployed, the racist ""but still a good man"" bartender) rather than developing unique characters because it has to appeal to the most broad audience possible, being a public tv show. 

la hora chanante/muchachada nuí/museo coconut are probably some of the most authentic and genuine comedy shows in spain, they create something out of nothing really, both in terms of script and characters, also being pretty surreal.

One day after the election, Merkel announced that she had already spoken with the SPD, but would not rule out other possibilities.[30] An opinion poll conducted shortly after the election showed that 65% of SPD members were opposed to entering a Merkel-led grand coalition,[31] however the SPD executive voted to enter coalition talks[32] with the proviso that they would seek a vote from their membership before making a final agreement on entering a coalition.[33]

&gt; Finland wish to send 40 % of their GDP to Brussels to make sure that the Portuguese pensions are secured. 

See, this is what I'm saying that the media goes on about. According to the ECB, what Fins are paying for, (via their borrowing costs) is the subsidization of Germany's post 2009 economic boom. 

Also, it's worth considering that if Jan. 2009 had not occurred, Portugal would not be in any trouble with their sovereign debt, since it had been at 63% of GDP prior to austerity. Any money paid to Portugal now is just having the effect of paying the cost of economic damage caused by austerity and contagion. Frankly, we'd all have been better off if something had been immediately to counteract the spread of the crisis to portugal.

this one contains various laws (stpo, stgb, bgb, zpo ....) is bigger and more expensive

you'll see 90% of students in my class using one of those versions. the focus lies on the laws with these though, so you won't have a lot of/any additional information

the book you linked is a commentary. every § from the stgb is explained (definitions, important information etc) and common problems with opinions concerning their solution are presented

But on the other hand, since being in some way unified is essentially imperative to European national interest (both in terms of conflict prevention, and in terms of relevance on the world stage), **SOMETHING** has got to be done. 

As for the currency itself, you are right that not enough integration was had. For example:

* If there had been better unified financial regulatory structure, the housing bubble in spain might not have occurred. 

* If there had been EU reporting standards, Greece might not have been able to hide its massive debts. 

* If the EBRD's response could have been allowed to work in the rest of europe and not just in the east, then the south of europe might have had a similar outcome to eastern europe. 

* If the EFSF and the ESM has been enacted **as part of the maastricht treaty**, then the markets might not have panicked in the way that they did.  

* And if the ECB set its monetary policy with the entire EZ in mind, and not just the core countries, we'd have a result which looks more like anglo-saxon style monetary response. it's telling that the US and the the UK are having stronger recoveries than the EZ, while the crisis never even came to canada at all.  

&gt; Why are you so angry?

Sorry if I sound angry, I dont mean to. I'm actually enjoying this immensely.

It was not started by any change of laws, but reburial of very offensive monument and buried remains from center of capital to cemetery where such things belong. 

To put this in perspective for non ex soviet occupied nations imagine this fictional chain of events. Nazis were to occupy Jerusalem. Put up a monument in middle of town for the soldiers that died while occupying it and bury their remains under it. Many years later when Israel had gained freedom, they would take down the monument and put it back up on cemetery and rebury the remains there as well. You would say they had shown far more respect the nazis had deserved wouldn't you? But the answer from neonazis would be to go on streets, pillage shops and throw molotov cocktails(which to the leaders of the event would later testify to be organized and funded by the government of another country). Then years after that go on forums and post that they were fighting for their rights and freedom. So thats what happened, except well replace the nazis with russians and also now you see how this has no connection what so ever with whats happening in Ukraine.

That's just a few random indicators at which it's better. The most important indicator, [GDP per capita \(PPP\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(PPP\)_per_capita), is significantly lower in Serbia than either in Romania or Bulgaria.

&gt; Not true. See [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Inequality-adjusted_Human_Development_Index.png). (Serbia's HDI without GINI is slightly lower than Mexico's, but GINI is veeeery important, because it's responsible for Mexico's situation: crime lords, slums etc...)

Yes, it's true. The fact that the ineuality-adjusted HDI of Serbia is higher doesn't change the fact that the overall HDI is lower than that of Mexico.

&gt; This is just ridiculous. I don't know should I even give a serious answer. Neither is Czechia in Western Europe. Half of Serbia was in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Romania, Greece, Bulgaria are also orthodox. And most importantly, what the hell does religion have to do with anything???? You're being discriminatory and a bigot. 

Czechia is in Central Europe. All other countries in the EU except for Romania, Bulgaria and Greece belong to the Western sphere of Catholicism and Protestantism, while Serbia belongs to the Eastern sphere, together with Russia and Ukraine.

For your question, the mathematics do not really care about the altitude: all that matters is that things vary continuously. (I thought about using wind magnitude instead of pressure but decided that that's probably a bad example because you have things like tornados where wind does not really behave continuously.)

In fact, why don't I just try to come up with a plausible explanation for why the claim is true (and sorry that it's a little long). Instead of considering the full claim about the Earth, let's just consider the following 1-dimensional analogue:

""At every given time, there are two places *on the Equator*, on opposite sides of the Earth, having the same temperature.""

Let's see why this could be true: suppose you go to the Amazonas in Brazil, and I go to the complete opposite side of the world; that would be a place in Indonesia.

Now, if both of us record the temperature and find that they're exactly the same, then we've found the two places, but that's probably not going to be the case. Instead, suppose that one is warmer than the other -- I'll just assume that the Amazonas are hotter than Indonesia. What we do now is check what the temperatures are around the Equator; I'll check them in one direction, and you choose the same direction (but still on the opposite side of the world; that is, the temperatures we now measure are still on opposite sides -- [crappy illustration](http://pred.dk/dump/crappyillustration.png)). When we have checked temperatures half the way around the world, I'll be in the Amazonas, and you'll be in Indonesia. Now my thermometer shows a higher temperature than yours which means that somewhere along the way, the thermometers have gone from yours showing the highest temperature to mine showing the highest temperature. At this point of change, our two thermometers must necessarily show the same temperature (because temperature varies *continuously* along the Equator), so we've now find the two places on the Equator, on opposite sides of the world, with the same temperature!

The same sort of idea applies to the case where we consider the entire world, but I hope this sort of explains why it should be true (and that indeed, I could have picked any numerical parameter -- for instance pressure -- instead of temperature)!",0,1390330883,null,0,false,0,cev95vs,t3_1vnsez,t1_cev95vs,t1_cev2oot,null,1432041540,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I don't understand. Why should we face the hate for Holodomor? Did WE do it? Its purely because people think modern Russia is successor to the Soviet Union.
No. - Westerners have a habit of substituting “Russian” and “Soviet,” as if they are one and the same. They weren’t. By the late 1980′s the Soviet
Union’s population was a little more than 50% ethnically Russian.
The Russian Federation, on the other hand, is currently
about 80% ethnically Russian. Minorities play an important (and growing!) role in Russia today, and make up a growing percentage of the population.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;But on the other hand, since being in some way unified is essentially imperative to European national interest (both in terms of conflict prevention, and in terms of relevance on the world stage), SOMETHING has got to be done. 

Is it? And some way unified does in now way mean that we have to share a currency. 


And - the suggestion you had was a) EU suggestion. The EU is *not* the Eurozone, not at all. If the EZ want accounting standards or stuff like that, - go ahead. Not an EU problem. Why should my non EZ tax money go to solve EZ problems? It is rather clear - they have to solve it themselves. I did not create this - we voted no to the Euro. 

Furthermore - it still will not work. Housing bubbles (which Sweden has one coming btw), Greece's debt etc - that will still not solve the underlying problem that the Euro is a very, very badly constructed currency. 

And, to change that, not only do one need to change treaties, statues etc, which then need to be OK'd in 28 states (will not happen) one also need the will of the people to do that. As it is now, we do not want a United States of Europe. The Finns is not interested in sharing debt with Greece (why should they be) nor is the Netherlands interested in the Italians essentially voting on what will happen with *their* money. The Germans are in no way signing up to guarantee the Spanish social system and France do not want to cut their pensions by 20 % to guarantee Portugals. In short - we do not want a United States of Europe, where we share stuff, share debt, pay for other states schools/hospitals/social welfare etc, have massive transfers and can influence other states to a much larger degree. We do not want that, not at all. So, the treaty changes will not happen, nor the necessary changes to the Euro. 

So, the way I see it there are really two alternatives for the Euro. A) Go on like this. I don't know for how many decades, but several. Maybe worse, when Germany runs into problems, which they will. France is not exactly looking perky either. B) Split somehow. This is really what I wish would happen. Not because I particularely enjoy for example Greece being bankrupt, but because I truly dislike the Euro and in the long term I think it is better for them to leave. They should never have entered, and should have left at the first crises. However, it doesn't look like it will happen, so now I am hoping for countries like Finland to leave. They will not have the massive increase in currency from the Euro that Germany would have. 

It is interesting to discuss with you to. Most of the posters here defend the Euro - nothing that can't be fixed with a pinch of austerity, or that everything will be fine if they just ease up on the austerity. It seems like they don't want to think about the underlying problem at all.

Gut, nach dem Schwachsinn können wirs eigentlich sein lassen. Gehen wir jetzt eher in Richtung die-da-oben-verschwören-sich-gegen-uns-hier-unten-Tinfoil heads oder eher Geweine über ""Multikulti""-Politik?

Und nun? Es zeigt ganz empirisch anhand unserer Geschichte, dass die Beobachtung die du denkst gemacht zu haben so nicht haltbar ist.

&gt;typische Vermischung von Korrelation und Kausalität.

Wo?

&gt;von Bertelsmann

Ich weiß was Bertelsmann ist und um den Inhalt Ihrer Kritik. Das war mir aber grade sehr egal, weil die Bedingungen die den negativen oder positiven Ausgang für heimische beschreiben breit gefächert dargelegt wurden.

Außerdem wurde manchmal sogar durchaus differenziert geschrieben und schließlich die eigene Kritik an der Gegnerposition geäußert.

&gt;Das Demographieproblem ist eine direkte Konsequenz der wirtschaftlichen Stagnation.

Richtig. Dasselbe kann man ja auch in Afrika und Asien beobachten, wo die Wirtschaft fast so scheiße wie in Deutschland läuft. In Deutschland kann man es sich ja gar nicht mehr leisten mehr als 1,4 Kinder großzuziehen, treibt einen ja in den Ruin.

Schuld ist selbstverständlich das erbärmliche Wachstum der letzten 30 Jahre und keineswegs Familienpolitik oder stukturelle Gesellschaftsveränderungen. Schuld sind einzig Politiker und Ausländer!

Jetzt mal im Ernst: Checkst du eigentlich was für realitätsfernen Unsinn du da gerade verzapfst? Darüber kann ich nichtmal lachen.

Denk in nem ruhigen Moment mal nochmal über das Thema nach, und wieso das hier echt nix zu suchen hat.

**Zurück zu dem Studien-Gedöns:**

Zu dem Urteil dieses Bertelsmann Blatts kommen übrigens [unglaublich viele andere Studien](http://www.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/wirtschafts-und-finanzportal/was-die-einwanderung-den-gastlaendern-bringt-1.18225411) auch, eben auch in der Schweiz.

In dem Artikel sind alleine ca. 10 Quellen verwendet worden.

Jegliche andere Quelle die ich gesehen hab, ungeachtet ihres Ursprungs, kommt entweder zu dem Ergebnis dass *(immer abhängig von der Qualifikation, etc.)* **leichte negative Effekte** oder **leichte positive Effekte**  auf den Lohn, Arbeitsmarkt usw wirken.

zb ([Hamburgisches WeltWirtschaftsInstitut ](http://www.hwwi.org/uploads/tx_wilpubdb/HWWI_Research_Paper_3-4.pdf)(schlechtere Quelle, siehe wikipedia)

oder [DIW Berlin](http://www.diw.de/sixcms/detail.php/286188#HDR6)( imho beste Quelle bis jetzt)

Das Endergebnis ist in JEDER Studie an Bedingungen gekoppelt (größter Faktor ist Qualifikation: je höher qualifiziert, desto positiver der Effekt).

Zweitens wird in JEDEM Artikel auf die Marginalität der Effekte hingewiesen. D.h. da sowieso nur geringe entweder positive oder negative Effekte auftreten könnte man fast schon sagen, es hat gar keine Auswirkung, wolle man sich im Durchschnitt treffen.

Und drittens: Niemand, aber auch wirklich keine Sau kommt auf die Idee hier Einwanderung als auschlaggebend für die nicht mehr so gute wirtschaftliche Lage nach dem Wiederaufbau-Boom zu nennen. Das machen nur die Spinner auf einschlägigen Seiten/Foren.

Und jetzt sag mir nicht, die NZZ sei nicht reliable da liberal, sonst kack ich dir auf den Tisch. Seh einfach ein, dass die Majorität der (seriösen) Studien zu differenzierteren Urteilen kommen, als du.

Die Majorität der Gegenstimmen dagegen belaufen sich auf google in dümmlichen Amateur-Blogs.

Wär zwar echt schön, wenn alles immer so einfach schwarz/weiß wär. Ist es aber leider nicht ;)

The way I see it, Germany is divided into two groups about those issues.

The first group thinks that for the life of the average citizen these are no important issues. At least not compared to the economy and the question if I, my family and my friends will still have good jobs in the future. These people trust Merkel and her party to take care of that economy. In exchange for that, they don't care what else she does or doesn't (do) concerning less important issues. Conservative, liberal, her stance on Snowden.. all that doesn't matter one bit to them, compared to the economy. If they had two parties to vote for and both would be absolutely equally trusted in economic matters, those lesser things would come into play, but simply don't have such a party.

The other group (mostly younger people) see Snowden as a hero, think Merkel is too conservative and are rather concerned about our privacy. Looking at the election results, this group seems to be a lot smaller than the other.

In general: Germans don't blame Americans. They might blame the American Government, but not its people. Me personally, I'm mostly angry about the way our government handles this.

&gt;

&gt;**Web scraping** (**web harvesting** or **web data extraction**) is a computer software technique of extracting information from websites. Usually, such software programs simulate human exploration of the World Wide Web by either implementing low-level Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), or embedding a fully-fledged web browser, such as Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox.

&gt;Web scraping is closely related to web indexing, which indexes information on the web using a bot or web crawler and is a universal technique adopted by most search engines. In contrast, web scraping focuses more on the transformation of unstructured data on the web, typically in HTML format, into structured data that can be stored and analyzed in a central local database or spreadsheet. Web scraping is also related to web automation, which simulates human browsing using computer software. Uses of web scraping include online price comparison, contact scraping, weather data monitoring, website change detection,  ...

Let's make one thing clear, however. Russia is in it to maintain or even strengthen its geopolitical position. So is the European Union. It serves no one to claim the moral high-ground, or play down the true meaning of ""economic association"".

This is nothing less than Ukraine chosing its respective sphere of influence, for the next few decades at least. And it's in our interest to convince the people of Ukraine that they are better off with us, rather than with Russia.

I certainly believe so, and I'm quite sure you believe otherwise. The developments in the Baltics have made quite clear what Russia thinks of Europe's eastern member states. Your current administration will not give up control voluntarily, and so we will have to force you. 

Edit: 

To clarify myself - my sentiment does not stem from a personal fear of the Russian government. The point is that Russia (or Moscow, in any sense) controlled much of central and eastern Europe for more than half a century. And, more often than not, by oppressive and violent means. 

In my view, the still present fear in Poland, the Czech Republic or the Baltic states that while the names might have changed, the game played in Moscow remains the same is not unfounded. There's no requirement for escalation or unneccessary confrontation. That being said, there's still plenty of diplomatic and economic measures we can take, and should do so to secure our control over eastern Europe, and with that, to create safety in the long run.

Literally the only thing questioned, the only law broken, is the stain that is Kosovo.

We'll have to agree to disagree, but there is a reason why that ruling will forever be controversial. Pretending the ICJ is some paragon of justice is laughable at best.

true,modomario,BELG,Belgium - Flanders,"Another answer would be: Belgium wouldn't fight such a conventional war solo.

To put things into a different perspective. Let's ignore the rest of NATO as if America &amp; co don't exist to give them a better chance.

Russia has a military spending of 90.749.000.000$. The combined EU has a military spending of 275.173.000.000$ Now let's throw them another bone and say their friends in the EAU can join. A combined spending of 93.909.000.000$ (potential members not included). Still not even half of what the EU spends. 

Now let's assume hostilities build up in a timely manner as wars between big powers never came completely out of nowhere resulting in militarily expenditures getting raised to high (but sustainable) levels.

Russia currently spends about 4.4% of it's GDP on it's military to reach that number. The EU on average a mere 1.7%.

Some other things to keep in mind is that Russia doesn't even have close to 1/3rd of the population of the EU.

But to get back at your examples I'd like to note how you picked them considering how pacifist Germany is and the focus Russia lays on it's ground forces. 

Also note that a very large amount of that ""reserve"" contains lots and lots of soviet era antiques (t-72 and older). In a field where modern advancements such as newer reactive armors can make a vehicle nearly useless when compared to the newest models this is something to keep in mind. Especially considering the example you gave is from a nation leading in tank technology with expensive little jewels like the Leopard 2A7. Meanwhile the most modern Russian tank in service and production is the t-90. They're cost efficient for sure as shown by their commercial success but I'd still opt for some of our quality. 

In the end I'd bet on the Europeans in a conventional war. Not to say it wouldn't be devastating but just to point out that Russia wouldn't think of going for it anytime soon.

Politics is not about making-feel-good game. Its power and influence thing.

When Ukraine was proposed to join NATO, are you sure its altruism on the US part? Then everything is fine and perfect.


Secondly, No. I can pretty much guarantee that we do not want to see Ukraine being a Russian satellite.
Why not?

Because, money!

Its better to keep your house clean and perfect and then try to expand. We have learned this from history, and its not only us - look at any empire and think of it. When they become too big, things start going downhill.

Russia is a huge country. Living in Moscow, I have been to a lot of places in and out of Russia. Somehow, coupled with geography, its a huge issue to administer things properly. We share boundaries with 16 countries! 
US shares its boundaries with 2. One being its ally, Mexico has been a source of immigrants and this one country could be a political topic for some people.

What about us?
From China to Kazakhstan to Azerbaijan to Estonia to Ukraine to Finland (oh and a small North Korean border too)!

So, the truth, like I repeated is: we do not want Ukraine to be a satellite state. But its pretty sure we do not want to see it becoming someone's satellite state.

Well, I will just point out that living in Russia is actually very nice today, but much better IF you speak Russian.

We're also planning and drafting a bill which can help you immigrate to Russia and get Russian citizenship very quickly, for high-skilled specialists. Not to mention that as a high-skilled specialist, you can ask for support in setting up your start up and get total government funding and support.
A Russian passport gives you visa-free regime to lots of countries, particularly from the FSU, to travel and work freely there. Also, a flat 13% tax rate, no strings attached, so as to say. You earn a million or a billion - we don't charge you differently.

El Pais - The biggest newspaper leans to the left but essentially to where the PSOE is. Probably the most rigorous and serious source in the country I would say they are getting old but maybe it' s not a bad thing. His group has interests in South Amercica where news are clearly against leftist governments as in Venezuela or Argentina aligning more with the right-wing in this cases.

El Mundo - Moderately conservative is usually the most independent source or maybe the one which changes its allies more frecuently, has an ongoing battle with the current government over corruption but supports ""strongly"" certain member of the PP. They get some great stories but usually lack professionalism (on the ethics side), use sensationalism or become a national disgrace as when they pushed for years a conspiracy between accusing ETA and the socialist government of the 11M terrorists attacks.

ABC - A centenary newspaper that fluctuates between moderate to far-right extremism. There is piss contest between them, La Razon, and the deceased La Gaceta for the heart of the National Catholicism. Hope that without La Gaceta they come back to do some journalism. They always defend the monarchy so they have had a hard time recently.

La Razon - Government newspaper, no mater what Rajoy says or do they will be there for him, quite surrealist sometimes, covers have been regular TT in twitter. Somewhat religious (lots of ""contacts"" ads for their also ""deeply religious"" readers). The director Francisco Marhuenda appears in a daily debate in a leftist TV channel (owned by a center-right corporation, Planeta) the guy is irritating, the program is not neutral but he will twist and manipulate even the most simple facts.

La Vanguardia - I don't really follow it frequently but they are very big in Catalonia and quite friendly with it's government and nationalism. Traditionally conservative they tend to report news neutral to their interests professionally so I think they are a good source on national issues from a right-wing perspective.

On the other hand, there is probably the argument to be made that, if children are taught French from an early age on, this may increase the contact with the other side of the border, whereas before, the language barrier prevented such things from happening. And starting as early as possible is certainly a way of teaching young children a foreign language before such things become 'boring' and 'stupid' as a teenager.

And finally, I hope that this policy does not mean less emphasis on English, as I think that learning English is still the most important goal of language education, and any improvements in teaching another foreign language should not come at the expense [sic?] of English. 

Edit: If anyone is knowledgeable in terms of the current linguistic abilities in the Saarland, feel free to educate me (and surely others) about it, it would be very much appreciated.

Per evitare che questa situazione (che per lui è una rottura di palle disumana, dato che ogni roba che arriva in Parlamento diventa automaticamente a rischio palude) si ripeta, Renzi ha bisogno di arrivare alle prossime elezioni con una legge che preveda le liste bloccate (cioè fatte da lui): in questo modo, al di là dell'x per cento di posti che devi dare alla minoranza, è sicuro che il grosso dei posti lo becca gente che risponde a lui.

You'll (hopefully be gladly) surprised that I actually agree with almost everything you said. And I would also tell you a little secret that everything you read, EVERY DAMN THING you see/read/hear is affected by  what government wants you to think.
In Russia. In Ukraine. In United States. In Germany. Everywhere. 

No controversy theory here, just a simple plain truth. The government has enormous power to affect the way you think, by changing what you see, by censoring what you read etc. without you even knowing. Brainwashing sometimes even.

So back to the topic.

Everything is an Influence game. Cut-throat competition there. 
Your 'fear' from Russian government comes from the fear laid down to you by the stories of Soviet government, even when Soviet Union is not Russia, and Russia is not Soviet Union.


Anyhow, like I repeated numerous times, our interest in Ukraine is cultural, social, political, geographical etc. Same reasons like that of EU.
But Ukraine has a certain edge to it. Its half-Russian. This is our population. Now, you take Poland, Czech Republic its all fine, because its influence, right? Yeah.
But Ukraine, is like our home. Our relatives live there. Even my relatives live there. 
The biggest, BIGGEST, problem in Ukraine and of Ukraine is that it is actually not one country. It has never been one country. The west and the east are completely different.
Completely.
Mentality, language, religion, attitude etc.

The real Ukraine, if to say so, lies from the region of Kiev to Poltava. Somewhere around that.
West Ukraine was under the influence of Poland, and they consider themselves to be very European. We call them European-wannabes. Whatever. 

So long as they kept their house in order things were fine. Then something happened.
When you talk about putting missiles right next to our homes, it becomes a huge problem. Real deal.
Hey, this is no Cold War going on right? Then why such aggressive measures. For what, I ask?

I am talking about Ukraine's thought of deployment of NATO on its territories. We became instantly pissed off.
Big time pissed off.

On Feb 12, 2008, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia may target its missiles at Ukraine if its neighbor joins NATO and accepts the deployment of a US missile defense shield.

Putin declared right at the NATO-Russia summit in 2008 that if Ukraine joined NAT, Russia would contend to annex the Ukrainian East and Crimea. 
This was one of the biggest threat Russia has ever made in its modern times so you should understand the seriousness of the matter, its no joke here, pal. And it was done right at the summit, in front of US delegates. Tense times.
Actually there could have been very high chance for that. We moved our military, deployed Katyusha etc. 
It was kept low-profile, but I can guarantee that Russia is very concerned about Eastern Ukraine/Crimea because it is essentially Russian populace currently a part of other country.

US, Russia etc discussed on it, and after that tense period, we reached better understandings. 
Also, to be honest, I hate all this since my honest point would be why US has to urge so much to push NATO in Ukraine when we're not putting our armies there. (except Crimea, which, according to our mentality and history, is pretty much our territory)

Fortunately, we have reached better understanding about.

We get bad press sometimes even when we're not really wrong. We dont care too much but its bad.
 
Like some skirmish with Georgia, for instance. United Nations finally reported it was Georgia which started the act of aggression, against its own citizens as such and later on against Russia. 
These citizens were Ossetians/Abkhazians, whom we gave some taste of freedom then, just like /r/MURICA does sometimes!


Right now, our relation with Baltics is actually pretty cool I would say. There are backstage dramas by politicians, diplomats all the time but they happen between almost all countries. This is their job, it seems. 

From Russian point of view, we just wanna care for our home, and major neighbors to see them becoming our trade partners. 

There's actually a Russia-EU FTA agreement, also in progress. But like I said, all things are intertwined, some things are state secrets, and some things are just because someone loves dramas. Still, as for Ukraine, while we are not Altruist, we're really trying to be nice with them.

I  wanted to express ambiguity because I don't know what that involves either. 

However, I am going to state the most likely behaviour of Spain if it's not able to block the effective independence of Catalonia. Even if Catalonia get the independence there is still the Basque Country thus the future of an independependent Catalonia has to be made as painful as posible with peaceful means. Spain will block the EU membership of Catalonia, and not only that. Spain would also block them from signing any Free Trade Agreements and joining any posible international organization where Spain has some leverage.

&gt;This is just politics for most people

When you won't be able to afford heating your house and food in the same month, you don't talk about politics. This is about a bureaucratic ruling class that sacrifices progress and their citizens well being because they don't want to lose power. A generation X and Y that refuses to shut up and take the status quo, because they know what could be. 

I suppose you could extend the meaning of poliitics, to reframe it in a historical, philosophic and social context so this would qualify as politics, but in that case these movements not only qualify as real politics, but because they are real paradigm shifts that define generations and change the future of nations are more ""political"" than any of our democratic pseudointelectual rhetoric carried out by wealthy politicians and moderated by sensationalist journalists. All of our ""politics"" are pale, lack vigor, motive, they seem to be a charade, a puppet show interpreting the real thing, a lie we are satified with and accept as sufficient.

**If this ""revolution"" goes on for, I expect:** (assuming it actually either stays on the same or increases in intensity)

**6 months**: Economic turmoil in Ukraine. Possible sanctions.

**8-10 months**: Devaluation of the currency. Economy seriously messed up.

**1 year+**: Danger to sovereignty. Recent Egypt-type situation, or maybe worse. We talk with our partners/fellows (US/UK/EU) about possible scenarios or for relief package.

If it continues for more, I expect a Civil war.

**In case of a Civil War**:

In case of such an event, we have previously mentioned, Russia will most probably annex Eastern Ukraine and Crimea. (Kharkiv, Donbass region, Crimea, possibly Odessa)
Western Ukraine left on its own. Or we don't know too much about its fate.

Somebody made a good pic: http://www.david-sadler.org/image/maps/ukraineSecession.gif

With Kiev divided almost like it was Berlin. It might seem sensationalist though. 

Eastern Ukraine won't be left as an independent state. At worst, it'll become a puppet state of Russia, but probably we'll annex it. 

Yes - Russia, US, EU will interfere. China too.

&gt;late 13c., ""person who is the chattel or property of another,"" from Old French esclave (13c.), from Medieval Latin Sclavus ""slave"" (source also of Italian schiavo, French esclave, Spanish esclavo), originally ""Slav"" (see Slav); so used in this secondary sense because of the many Slavs sold into slavery by conquering peoples.
This sense development arose in the consequence of the wars waged by Otto the Great and his successors against the Slavs, a great number of whom they took captive and sold into slavery. [Klein]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slav#Ethnonym

&gt;The Slavic autonym Slověninъ is usually considered a derivation from slovo ""word"", originally denoting ""people who speak (the same language),"" i.e. people who understand each other, in contrast to the Slavic word denoting ""foreign people"" – němci, meaning ""mumbling, murmuring people"" (from Slavic němъ – ""mumbling, mute"").

If i'm not mistaken, all member nations had to vote to join the EU in the first place.

Fair enough.

Naturally, for something like this, you can never be 100% sure whether or not OP is who he claims he is. Even now, I'm not completely sure. It'll **always** be possible to fake documentation, scan it, and show it to the mods at /r/IAmA or even here, and get a metaphorical stamp of approval. Photos of human beings holding this documentation aren't good enough either. Pay stubs, ID cards, any documentation under the sun can be faked, and unless you're somebody famous who can take a photo of themselves to prove their identity, or use their official Twitter, or what-have-you, we will never have concrete proof.

As for OP, I've received a scanned document of OP's identification and I've performed an FFT search on the image (using 3 different services) with various crops and sizes... it appears to be 100% unique on the internet. Now, I could certainly attempt to call up the Russian government and ask about OP, but this is more effort than its worth, and given the situation, risky for OP and everyone involved. And if OP isn't who he claims he is, what if the real person, whose documentation OP managed to get a hold of, gets in trouble? No, this is a very delicate situation.

So, with that said, if we combine the uniqueness of the document on the internet, along with the fact that his opinion is very under-represented here at /r/europe, and that he seems genuine in wanting to explain things...

Because contagion. You can solve them now, or you can wait until they get bigger, more difficult to deal with, and are in your own country. It's kind of like saying ""why should I help put out a fire in my neighbor's house, when it hasn't spread to my house yet?""

&gt; The Finns is not interested in sharing debt with Greece (why should they be) nor is the Netherlands interested in the Italians essentially voting on what will happen with their money. The Germans are in no way signing up to guarantee the Spanish social system and France do not want to cut their pensions by 20 % to guarantee Portugals.

Well, too bad I'd say. As an economist, I'd say that most people do not realize how deeply intertwined these countries all are. For instance, not only is Portugal's economic trouble caused by EU inactivity and German austerity... but also, have you ever stopped to ask just who is holding all of the southern EU debt. The answer of course is northern banks (since southern debt instruments did seem like a good bargain at the time). The trouble is, a lot of northern countries are small and wealthy, and their financial sectors are larger than their GDP. NL's banking sector (not other finance, just banks) is about 420% of their GDP. Luxembourg's is worse. If Portugal or Spain would collapse tomorrow, and their bonds drop in value, then it might cause the failure of a Dutch or Belgian or Luxembourgish bank, which would subsequently cause the collapse of its home country. You might remember that that is exactly what happened to Iceland and to Cyprus.

So, there is contagion risk in the EU, and it's extremely severe.  You cannot just pretend that it's ""their risk, and their problem"". The borders are open when it comes to flows of money, and the contagion risk is real, and hopefully your country will not have to end up like Iceland or Cyprus before it becomes painfully apparent.  The reason that all EU (and EEA) countries have an interesting in stopping the spread of the crisis is because otherwise it will spread north, (as it did to cyprus and to Iceland). and the fact that sweden has a different currency will not be of any consequence. 

that is why the EU acted to stop the Crisis from spreading east. (the collapse of the east would have lead to banking losses in Austria equivalent to 80% of its GDP,  to say nothing of what sort of effect the combined fall of the the east AND of austria would have had in germany). 

Just out of curiosity, how large is sweden's banking sector in relation to its GDP? If you get a picture of how large this is, then you can see what kind of risks sweden is facing with this whole business.

Russia has LGBT rights, even if media doesn't portray so. 

Russia has **NO anti-homosexuality laws**. This is a media propaganda. 

Please read carefully: laws, are there to protect, and in Russia, by law, same-sex sexual activity between consenting adults in private was decriminalized in 1993.
So what's the problem?

When in Rome do as Romans do. I can pretty much say that as you move from the city to the country side, the attitude of people regarding homosexuality becomes more conservative. Russians are, in general, religious people. In fact, after the break up of Soviet Union, religion is the new fad here. Biggest and most important religion here is, Orthodox Russian church. It doesn't views homosexuality as good thing, like any church in Rome.

Then we've got Islam in the South. Views of Islam regarding homosexuality are pretty not-so-positive.

When the general attitude of Russians is not so positive, then why to make such headlines: ""Vladimir Putin’s attack on homosexuality is shattering the lives of Russians"". Really? Like, really?

If you're gay, you won't have any problem. Amid all media hype, probably this might seem strange. But it's true. But if you display too much of your sexual orientation, then people might not be pleased.
Otherwise - There're many LGBTs in Russia, some even pretty famous ones.

Of those four examples, three would be considered a ""Ausbildungsberuf"" in Germany, misleadingly usually translated ""apprenticeship"". The fourth one (general studies) seems to be equivalent to some kind of university science pre-class.

The thing is, the German education system considers the university a place of research and teaching in a narrow academic sense. Common trades/craft-ships are not covered by universities but in a dual-education system provided by companies and trade/craft schools together.

See Apprenticeship http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Germany#Apprenticeship in particular and the entire article in general.

So even though you can get admitted to Clinical practice - Paramedic in australia with ATAR 70+, you can't get here. Not because the requirements are stricter, but simply for the fact that there is no university course at that basic practical level.

I suspected you would raise that point.

The situation is far from being as black and white as that but even if they are - Ukraine is a sovereign country and more or less has the right to do as they please in their own territory as long as they respect the fundamental rights of their citizens. If the Russian speaking majority in Eastern Ukraine feel so Russian why don't they move to Russia? The Ukrainians in Western Ukraine have just as much right to have their voice heard in government as those in Eastern Ukraine.

Eastern Ukraine could secede and join the Russian Federation if the people of Ukraine decide via a free and open process to let that happen. If that doesn't happen Russia has zero right to any territory in Eastern Ukraine.

&gt;Impeachment of Yanukovych: Ok, do that. But who'll be your next leader? We just want a stable government and President. Unfortunately in Ukrainian politics there're no viable solutions right now.

You realize what you're saying right: your current leader isn't any good, but you can't pick a new one right now. Why? Because we don't like the candidates. Doesn't exactly sound fair now does it. Of course this is geopolitics yet again: Yanukovych has always pro-Russia, and you don't want him gone. You don't care about his competence.

&gt;Snap elections: I disagree. This could be very easily manipulated. Instead of snap election, make your Deputies more accountable. Maybe ""Vote for Recall"" option to the Deputies, but not the whole country.

..... A Russian official disliking snap elections because ""they could be manipulated""...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_presidential_election,_2012#Claims_of_electoral_irregularities

&gt;Rejection of Customs Union membership: Do that if you know from where to find your next months gas and oil. If our trade gets hurt, naturally there'll be implications. Better strategy is to pay your bills on time

Yup. You want them as a geopolitical partner, and are using your gas and oil reserves as a pressure point. Sure, it's how the system works... just don't say stuff like ""we don't want you to have elections because we're afraid of corruption"".

&gt;We have been tired of Ukraine in a way, since they become ours when they need us, but they're more like crying children. No responsibility to the help, debts, support that we give them. I can pretty much say that we help them without any false or unethical terms and conditions.

**Thank you Russia**!!! Except for the part where you just said you'd increase prices if they'd go to the EU. Again, nothing wrong with that but don't claim it's ethical.

&gt;Ukrainian protesters, not all, but some of them are fueled by parties like Svoboda. Svoboda is the KKK's Ukrainized version - its a neonazi party and has very much hate for pretty much everything. Ukraine also has Klitchko. We like him, but as a boxer. A popular person doesn't equates a good statesman.

Yes they also have Ruslana, she won Eurovision a while back. Your ""they have racists supporting them"" argument isn't that great, it just shows the protest is carried by a huge part of the population.

&gt;Ukraine simply does not have options.

Because you don't *give* them any options. If you agree to not raise the energy prices when they approach the EU, then you know they'd go to the EU in a heartbeat. But you won't do that, mostly because of course it'd be incredibly stupid to do so.

&gt;Real revenue and industries of Ukraine lie in the Eastern Part - more Russian speaking - full of top universities - tourism - employment and business opportunities. Attempts to have ""revolution"" there have failed miserably, simply because people develop themselves. They don't want a ticket to EU or other countries. They're master of their fate.

I'm calling bullshit. Eastern part is simply more ethnically Russian. Don't come up with ""masters of their fate"" bullshit.

&gt;I guess they're doing to not to worry and frustrate millions of our citizens who have relatives in Ukraine.

*Or*, maybe they don't want to fuel the protest in the east? But nah, the censorship is there because they *care* about the citizens!

&gt;I strongly believe that Ukraine needs to stop this revolution right now, or these protesters must present some SOLID options, taking economics, trade, and their country's socio-political and economical standing in view.

Point is: it's not your decision. It's the decision of the Ukranian people. You have them in a chokehold now I agree, but I believe the government should still do what its people want them to do.

&gt;Russia has been avoiding using any diplomatic or government pressure for what? To help you guys!!! But we'd like you find a leader first, and make your conditions more concrete.

Hahahaha. Are you actually being serious now? I've seen an interview with Lavrov literally this evening where he's denouncing the Ukranian protests.

And uhm...

&gt;Their future lies not with Russia or the EU, but by working upon themselves.

Kind of contradicts:

&gt;We just want a stable government and President. Unfortunately in Ukrainian politics there're no viable solutions right now.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"First, it seems to me that you are mixing up EZ and the EU. The EU cannot be united under one currency, countries have opt out. Nor is the EU responsible for banks, no taxations etc. You talk about EU stopping crises for example - what? 

&gt; Because contagion. You can solve them now, or you can wait until they get bigger, more difficult to deal with, and are in your own country. It's kind of like saying ""why should I help put out a fire in my neighbor's house, when it hasn't spread to my house yet?""

We are not in the EZ - I do not care. I think the EZ should dissolve. What more, it is illegal take other countries debt etc.It is against the treaty. Each country is responsible for their own stuff - period. And trust me, not only Sweden, but UK, Denmark and other countries would protest, not to mention the Germans, Finns, Estonians. It is simply not allowed. Nor do we want it to be. 

&gt;Well, too bad I'd say. As an economist, I'd say that most people do not realize how deeply intertwined these countries all are. For instance, not only is Portugal's economic trouble caused by EU inactivity and German austerity... but also, have you ever stopped to ask just who is holding all of the southern EU debt. The answer of course is northern banks (since southern debt instruments did seem like a good bargain at the time). The trouble is, a lot of northern countries are small and wealthy, and their financial sectors are larger than their GDP. NL's banking sector (not other finance, just banks) is about 420% of their GDP. Luxembourg's is worse. If Portugal or Spain would collapse tomorrow, and their bonds drop in value, then it might cause the failure of a Dutch or Belgian or Luxembourgish bank, which would subsequently cause the collapse of its home country. You might remember that that is exactly what happened to Iceland and to Cyprus.

I know the risks, but all the countries you mention are EZ countries again. And yes, but at some point a really crappy currency has to fall, there is no way around it. One can't go to Japan territory and forever have the south living the way they do, just because the currency is so crappy. And no, it will *not* happen that we magically change our minds and thing - ""gee, a United States of Europe would be fine. As a Finn, I just can't wait to lower my living standard very much and send 30 % of our GDP to Brussels and get 5 % back, to make sure the Greek get their debt paid off."" No, no, no.! 

And even economist (and yes, I have studied some economics about a year and a half) certainly do not exist in a vacum. You have to act and interact with other disciplines and saying - ""give up your nationality and let yourself be ruled from Brussels"" doesn't work just because you think it is a good idea. Think about it - wouldn't be a brilliant idea if the US and the EU joined in one union? Would the Americans like that? We would outnumber you - but we promise that you can get the Fed in Washington, but we are moving the capital in Berlin. No more guns, and I hope you don't mind learing french from day one...

It doesn't matter if it even make economical sense, Americans would *hate* it, hate that they would be outnumbered by Europeans, hate that they paid for this and that while giving up this and that. Hate not having a president with power.  That is at least a bit of how we feel. Not the same, but some of it. You do not seem to grasp that. Why do you think LePen is gaining? Golden Dawn? UKIP etc. Economics can never work if you don't put it and try to make it work in a political context. I study natural sciences, environment, biology, environmental economis etc. It doesn't matter if I say ""stop using CO2"" - that doesn't really help does it? One has to put it in the context of today, and then work from there. So, give up your idea about a new treaty for the next 50 years. 

&gt;So, there is contagion risk in the EU, and it's extremely severe.

The **EZ**, not the EU, have fixed this crises, and they are fixing it every day still, contributing to it, making sure its get driven down. No one can change that. The EZ is making sure everything in their enclave goes to hell/Japan territory and that unemployment will stay high etc. 

There is nothing to be done about that. The only thing one can do is to look ones house over, again and again and make sure one is in better shape and try not to get dragged down with them. 

&gt;Just out of curiosity, how large is sweden's banking sector in relation to its GDP? If you get a picture of how large this is, then you can see what kind of risks sweden is facing with this whole business. 

We have had bank crises, two of them. (90's, and 2009 I belive) Google  them. The bank crises in the 90's is seen as examplary bank save actually. One year we spent 4 % of our GDP on our banks. Finland spent 7 %. We did that without the EU, why can't they do it without us? And, I have seen their bank saves- at least we demand collateral. They just seem to give money away.

Dear Ukraine,

You have amazing industries in the Eastern part of the country. You're so near to the Europe, and have amazing beauty in the West and in Crimea for tourism etc. Tourism, mining, metallurgy etc. So many opportunities to bring some high-skilled talent to the country, so many opportunities to step up on tourism etc.

But 20 years down the line, you blame us. Why? 

Our people share similar mentality and attitude. We've corrupt people too. But slowly, we're trying to bring a change. We're trying to build some industry, open up technology parks, and focus not only on some major cities.
Then why do you blame us?

After the fall of Soviet Union, we were also broke. But we tried helping you. We gave you lots of bonds and credits. In 2008-09, in the global recession, your economy got hit even when you're not a major global player - thanks to internal unpreparedness and 17 written warnings between the communication between National Bank or Russia and Ukraine, along with a special meeting in which we just told you: Guys, get ready!
Still, you messed it up and devalued your currency.

We again gave you some money. You took a big loan from the IMF to rebuild your economy. You didn't manage it well.
Now in 2015, you have to pay it back. 
After messing up your internal politics, this December '13, you came to us. We gave you $12 Billion, but yet again we're made villains and culprits. 

Why can't you just see that probably sometimes rather than playing blame-game - its better to focus on yourself, cleansing your corrupt people, finding and developing opportunities and have good relations with your neighbors.

No Europe can't. EU does not have an allowance of $16-20 Billion to spend on a NON-MEMBER country. They have Portugal, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Greece etc to worry about.
They offered Ukraine $600 Million, though. Russia gave $12 Billion.

&gt; You realize what you're saying right: your current leader isn't any good, but you can't pick a new one right now. Why? Because we don't like the candidates. 

Its not about us, Ukrainians themselves don't like their candidates. And before making argument, please check the facts.
Currently, opposition has Tymoshenko. She is same as Yanukovych and has sucked the country good. She is no angel.
Svoboda - We/US/EU, nobody wants them. They are neo-Nazis.

Klitchko - nice guy, popular, but being popular doesn't always mean being a good Statesman. Precisely because of this reason, protesters got pissed off of him as well. Good luck to him if he can pull it off, though.

Others: very much in minority.

&gt; Again, nothing wrong with that but don't claim it's ethical.

It is ethical. This is how the trade works, and if you don't know this then I'd suggest you understand this. EU told Ukraine ""well, it seems we'll be raising taxes if you join Customs Union"", as well. Except Russia countered it by pressuring EU (we've got another deal with them too), and telling Ukraine that any extra stuffs will be compensated.

Facts &amp; Figures.
Donetsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Kharkov, Odessa, whole Crimea bring Ukraine more than 55% of its GDP. 

In the west you've got Lvov and Uzhgorod/Carpathians - both tourist place and they bring 15% 
Rest of Western Ukraine has nothing significant.

Kiev and surrounding areas bring 20% as well.

Rest of the numbers for the rest of Ukraine.

As much as you might be skeptic, we really wish you find a good leader, no Tymoshenko/Yanukovych or other older choices, but someone new, strong and progressive, someone whom you people love.

Rest of the things will take care. Russia has a lot of things to care about in the world, and not just one Ukraine, if to put it bluntly. It will be good for us to have a happy and strong trade partner and neighbor.

&gt;Its not about us, Ukrainians themselves don't like their candidates. 

Still doesn't change how that should be of no matter to you. It shouldn't matter which candidate they choose to replace Yanukovych, it should matter that they *want* to replace him.

&gt;They are neo-Nazis.

You honestly believe those Neonazis would get a democratically elected majority behind them?

The opposition simply has no tools to unite because the government in Ukraine is doing what it can to make things hard on them, so ""no good replacement"" for Yanukovych is a pretty weird argument to make.

&gt;This is how the trade works, and if you don't know this then I'd suggest you understand this.

Oh I certainly know how the system works. Which doesn't mean I think the system is ethical. 

&gt;""well, it seems we'll be raising taxes if you join Customs Union"", as well. 

That's simply a matter of law. When you enter a Customs Union, you don't pay a lot of export taxes to other members of that customs union. When you leave a customs union and join another one, your taxes rise.

The thing is, the energy prices have nothing to do with Ukraine's geopolitical position. It shouldn't be influenced by it. You're using it as a pressuring point now and again it only makes sense, but I do think it's unethical.

&gt;Facts &amp; Figures.

Are you disputing that the Eastern part for a larger part is ethnically russian or not? To me, that seems  like a much more valid explanation for their lack of support of the 'revolution' than the GDP there. They might be richer than the western part, but not as rich as most of the Eurozone.

I don't want to make it seem like Russia is literally the devil here though. It's pretty obvious that Russia and the EU are battling for a political sphere of influence in Ukraine. You guys use the strengths you have (energy control) and that's how the system works. I just don't like the entire ""oh we don't want to lose Yanukovych because there's no viable replacement"" thing.

I know the western media here is incredibly biased as well (huge reports on the Ukranian protests yet suspiciously quiet about the Bulgarian protests), so I have no idea to what the will of the entire population is. I have democratic and incredibly naive ideals, and think that the population should decide. But, this is geopolitics and both EU and Russia will only listen to them when it's in their interests.

Give my regards to Putin! I wonder how he feels about all those leaked torture photos in Syria?

C'est à dire ? Quel genre de conversations ? Celles où on va s'apercevoir comme d'habitude que cet article profite au FN ?

Sinon sur les chiffres, ils sont tout à fait plausibles.

Les chiffres donnés par rue89, ne concernent que les les ex-détenus à nouveau condamnés dans les six ans. [25% des peines de prison ferme ne sont jamais appliquées](http://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/pas-que-dieudonne-100-000-peines-non-executees-en-france-radiographie-ampleur-failles-justice-alexandre-giuglaris-952937.html), et 83% des condamnations pour crime et délit ne sont pas des peines de prison ferme, mais passons, c'est cadeau. On a donc 0,5% des ex-détenus à nouveau condamnés dans les six ans qui ont plus de 30 condamnations.

Si on applique ce taux au total des condamnations à des crimes et délits dans les 14 ans (cadeau, je ne compte pas les 5 millions de contraventions qui affichent un taux de réitération supérieur), 0,5% * 6 873 000 = 34365.

On aurait donc avec ces hypothèses des dizaines de milliers de délinquants condamnés plus de 30 fois.

Après, si on étend la période pour le taux à plus de 6 ans, et le nombre de condamnations sur une durée de plus de 14 ans, on augmente largement le nombre final.

Ukraine has been your client state for a very long time, and is now straining at the bit to develop along its own path as an independent state. As chaotic as that may seem, compared to the relative security of the Russian orbit, it is the best path for Ukraine. 

It's hard to imagine a scenario in which the United States just allowed Russia to just annex part of the country. In a scenario in which protests continue and possible civil conflict breaks out, I see it as much more likely that the US pairs with the EU to support a Western-leaning unity government to support debt relief while consolidating national control and restructuring the economy. Do you disagree?

To Europeans: You may not always like us, but we're a lot better than those other guys with the giant nuclear stockpile and no regard for individual liberty, and you know it.

Certainly, the people have the right to oppose the actions of their government, and to demonstrate their opposition. If the people wish to secede, it becomes much less clear whether they have a democratic right to do that. For example, I am American, and no American state has the right to unilaterally secede from the Union. On the other hand, if part of, say, Mexico wished to break out of their federation and join us, I think there would be a sizable amount of support for them, and opposition to any efforts on the part of the government of Mexico to reign them back in.

You asked a tricky question, but I would be leaning towards a possible Yes. Replace Russians with America and you get the picture. Russia cares for its people. Fortunately, Ukraine-Russia, in reality, have awesome relations, visa-free etc., so complex situations have never been there.


Rather than wasting our time/energy on some annexation and military might, Russia wants to minimize that window. We want to be economically more active, and for this, we want a good, healthy neighbor. Mind you, we've got 16 countries as neighbors, including big ones like China etc so we can't just be keep thinking over one. 

I want to highlight:

**Ukraine is important to us, and we want it to be in good hands. While we probably don't want a straight up anti-RUssian guy, if someone who's lenient towards EU but is at least strong, progressive, and is loved by Ukrainians - thats much more important to us than anything else.**

As for the political problems; Russia has countless.

Putin's regime is losing legitimacy, as it had a long time ago in the West. The only thing keeping him in power is a relatively stable economy. Any major fluctuation there will result in a Ukraine-like scenario; massive protests that overwhelm the police apparatus. Ukrainian economy was flimsy to begin with, and the revolution is in full swing. Putin and his goons (like OP) are a few against millions.

You are confusing Russian language with ethnic Russians.  Only in Crimea is there a majority Ethnic Russian population, the rest of the country is overwhelmingly Ukrainian.  You are probably thinking that Ukrainians and Russians are the same ethnically, but this is how they identified them in the census.  

Russia's russification efforts in Ukraine were pretty successful. Most of the entire Ukrainian population that was in Russia's borders for centuries now ceases to exist. Tack on mass deportations and an avoidable famine and you have created a culture that is at war with itself.

true,JasonYamel,UKRA,Ukraine,"&gt;Half of Ukraine was formed after giving away by Russia. Crimea, and Eastern area (Donbass, Kharkiv) in the 50s. 

That is false. Only Crimea was given to Ukraine in the 50s. Donbass and Kharkiv were parts of Ukrainian SSR since its inception, and Kharkiv was the *capital* of UkrSSR before the war! I feel like this is fairly basic info for a government official who ""meets the president often"" to know.

Also important to note: Kharkiv and Donbass were Ukrainian lands for centuries, and Ukrainian speaking until the industrialization of the 1930s and the corresponding influx of immigrants from the rest of the USSR. 

And the Russian-speaking Ukrainians, there and everywhere, did not appoint the Russian government as their spokespeople. I am a Russian-speaking Ukrainian from the south and the Russian government will **never** speak for me.

&gt; Joining the Customs Union is not as big deal as hyped out to be - since its purely an Economic union.

Joining any customs union involves giving away a part of your economic independence. While the EU at least seems to be a union of independent countries, not overly dominated by any one power, can the same be said about Russia, given its track record?

&gt;please read 900-page report

Funny guy, I like that.

&gt;These protesters are causing political instability.

You don't think Yanukovych's 180-degree turn on EU integration, the draconian anti-constitutional laws aimed at stifling dissent a-la-Russia have *something* do with with that? Is it really all those pesky protesters? 

Though I guess we could take it all lying down like your country's citizens did.

&gt;But our biggest qualm with the protesters is that they're offering NO real solution. 

""real solution"" = ""something Russian government likes"". TIL.

&gt;since they become ours when they need us, but they're more like crying children.

Yeah how **dare** they put their own interests first.

&gt;I can pretty much say that we help them without any false or unethical terms and conditions.

I can pretty much say that 40-50% of Ukrainians would under no circumstances believe that, or anything else the Russian government would say. The rest are unsure or pro-Russian, but around half of the population it would take decades of actual good will and not realpolitik for Russia to win over. I can't stress how wide the credibility gap is in Kyiv for example.

&gt;Svoboda is the KKK's Ukrainized version - its a neonazi party and has very much hate for pretty much everything.

You are either misinformed or using fairly primitive fear-mongering here. The best comparison to Russian politics is probably Dmitry Rogozin. Ultra-nationalists to be sure, but nowhere near KKK or Nazis. 

&gt; A popular person doesn't equates a good statesman.

At least he made his millions in an honest transparent way. How many Russian politicians can you say that about?

&gt;most of the ""revolution"" is in Kiev and Western Ukraine.

No, most of the revolution is in Kiev. People from elsewhere come to Kiev because they know that a nation's capital city is where its fate is made. Everywhere else is a sideshow at best.

&gt;These unemployed people just want a free ticket to the EU.

Wow, I hope the Russian government just goes on a hearts-and-minds PR mission and uses lines like these to attempt to swing the situation. Fastest way to get that free ticket to the EU :)

&gt;Attempts to have ""revolution"" there have failed miserably, simply because people develop themselves. 

Not 100% sure what that means, but rest assured the revolution there is alive and well, supported by a significant minority. Another significant minority supports the president and the rest are undecided. A huge change from 2004. Probably has something to do with that economic freefall that Ukraine plunged into in the last 4 years under tsar Viktor.

&gt;They're master of their fate.

Right, being tied down to ageing and unproductive industrial plants from the 50s that are at the mercy of cheap Russian gas is a great way to control your fate.

&gt;This will cause them to force us to take some major action, and as we know once we get involved - this will get EU/US more chance to interfere.

If you're so close to Putin, you must understand that there's no way at all for Russia to interfere other than throw money at Yanukovych. That and maybe clandestine missions by GRU/FSB, are the options.

&gt;We do not support the illegal law passed by the Ukrainian government recently. Its totalitarian, and a complete no-no.

If someone doesn't speak the language he/she obviously can't translate their words. Expecting someone who understands to jump on and translate for the rest of us is silly. You'd need an interpreter to have a conversation with said person.  
Besides more often than not sentences in other language than english are off-topic.  
Personally I don't mind non-english sentences but I'd prefer to have a translation alongside.

I get it that Poe's law comes in effect when dealing with written language but we CAN create software to at least properly translate the meaning.

What I tried to emphasize is that these far right parties were always historically western Ukrainian, exclusively, and shunned/hated by Eastern Ukrainians. Now some Ukrainians in the very east are joining the ranks; with support from western Ukrainians and no opposition from the east (in terms of it being foreign, not to agree with the ideology). Once again, far-righters are a minority, and I do no support their ideas; however, even they are unified, as compared to being previously splintered in two parts. It just shows that something previously considered exclusively western Ukrainian became simply Ukrainian, even if it isn't the best thing to rally around. 

I personally loathe their racism/xenophobia/every other phobia, but they are the strongest anti-Russian entity in Ukraine. If that adds any relevance.

It is curious that there remains a very strong anti-Russian sentiment in Ukraine while at the same time Ukraine has looked towards Russia repeatedly for help. Granted, the ill-will can be explained, in part, by the famine there under Stalin and various other events.

There is something else at play that I think that you neglected to talk about: Moscow, Moscovy, has always sought large buffers between it an any potential ally. Russia's great asset is numerous wars has been its vast vast distances; they have allowed the Russians to regroup and counterattack. The EU is primarily a trade union but there is an increasing defense aspect to it; expanding the EU to the borders of Russia constitutes a potential threat.

On top of that there is also the pesky problem of territory and the fact that much of what is now Ukraine was gifted by Kruschev even though those lands were historically and ethnically Russian. Allowing western military powers, agents, security services, etc free access to the borders of Russia on historically Russian land is sure to be a thorn in the side of the Kremlin.

When all is said and done, nations are concerned about their survival. Threaten the economy you threaten the security. Threaten security and you threaten the economy. Either way, there is an existential risk. Personally, I believe that Russia recognizes that there is a range of existential threats arrayed around it. There is the chaos in the Caucasuses regarding muslim radicals. There is also the threat to the Caspian Sea and the energy that lies beneath it from islamists in Syria and potential unrest and instability in Iran should a regime change occur (as hoped for by the west). These constitute grave economic threats to Russia. Now there is Poland in NATO (amongst other former Eastern Bloc nations), and Ukraine is poised to become the eastern-most reach of the EU. Throw into the mix that in the Russian Far East there lies a giant untapped wealth of natural resources and a neighbor that is giant and potentially unstable (China). 

Russia is, in many ways, surrounded by troubles. In the US we have the luxury of two relative non-entities to the north and south and two giant moats to deter aggression on our shores. This has shaped our perception of the world, of how the world should function. Even the Western European nations have thrived behind an American iron curtain in the form of NATO and having been spared the full devastation of WWII (unlike the Eastern European nations).

I think that if we approach the issue as one of stability versus instability the solutions become relatively easy. However, this requires ""give and take"" as well as a rejection of the ""winner take all"" approach we have all been taking.

I am curious if you could possibly speak to reports that Prince Bandar bin Sultan told Putin that if Russia did not back off in Syria that it would unleash the Chechens on Russia.

Its economic ties with the US, EU, and the world at large are massive. It is extremely integrated and interdependent into the global economy. Its exports/trade has been its engine of growth and development from an obscure, 3rd world country to a contending global power (following the Cultural Revolution, starting with the Di Xiaoping leadership in 1975). These economic ties are essential for the future of China's development and rise to power. With Japan and South Korea as strategic US *allies* with US military presence, they are safe from any military operation on behalf of China (China understands that US has still far and away the strongest military in the world). This being said, *any* militaristic territorial expansion will risk to sever the economic ties with the West. Any such aggression, against any other sovereign nation, will warrant a strong response, primarily economic reprimand from the US and EU. Diplomatic and economic sanctions to curb such aggression are a sure thing. A dramatic increase in US military presence is also almost guaranteed. Such a turn of events are a hefty price to pay for a marginal territorial gain. The immediate economic effects threaten the global economy, and is almost suicidal to Chinese growth and any future global ambitions (diplomatic recognition is also down the drain). HOWEVER, soft power is not to be neglected. The support of pro-Chinese satellite governments and (covert of course) coops to get them into power are far less likely to warrant an extreme reaction from the West, and are pretty fathomable. That is a threat to the region, but not any annexation.

Russia, on the other hand, would implode under Western sanctions. In the highly unlikely event of them annexing Ukrainian territory, EU and US sanctions and even embargo are absolutely certain. As the lions share of Russia's economy is comprised on energy exports, it will destroy their economy almost instantly. Without its economic stability, Putin's police state regime will lose any sort of legitimacy and support, and effectively have a more extreme version of Ukraine's revolution. The problem is Putin is less rational and a bit more diluted in his ambitions, and might not recognize the risk..

Too much of little things like puns, blunt statements about invading someone, random mentioning of facts or events, but they hold no significant value, because they won't happen any time soon (so there is no point in actually saying anything like that).


Guy overall feels wrong, he's posting hours assuming he is from Moscow is from 23:00 and 8 hours straight, assuming he's an official, you **do** need to work and not answer AMA's on reddit for the entire night.
Also little stuff like creating account 3 days ago right around when protests began etc.


From a random russian point of view i think there is a media campaign currently going on around Ukraine and its protests, its not unheard of to create fake profiles of brave freedom activists (i remember reading about a gay woman from Egypt during Arab spring who turned out to be a dude from London or smtn like that) to sway public opinions (or to piss someone off).  Just keep in mind that this guy might be not legit and this is internet.
