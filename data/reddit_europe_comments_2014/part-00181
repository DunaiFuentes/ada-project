A few factors come to mind which may apply to NAFTA, though. First, the trading system is less expansive than the EU. It's just not as comprehensive, and presumably they're willing to put up with the resulting inconsistencies. Second, the drive behind the EU wasn't simply market-based, but there was an urge to force previously-warring political elites/states to interact.

The logic of EU expansion is stoppable: you just need to be willing to accept bizarre, costly, arbitrary irregularities.

Marriage is a legal framework that encourages mutual support and healthy social units, even before or without children.

If someone isn't married and doesn't have that support, they rely more greatly on the state, so the state has an incentive to encourage marriages.

The right metric for marriage is whether it encourages more stable social units in society.

true,nolok,FRAN,France,"Tons of points to answer on that, in no particular order of importance

About our relations with them:

* I think you would be surprised at how good France - Russia relations are and have been for a very long time, behind the public facade. Bar a few exceptional times (like that Napoleon times thingy) we've always had good/decent relations with them. Even during the cold war De Gaulle made sure we kept good relation with the soviet union; that was part of the ""maintaining France as an independent major power"" factor I said in my previous post, his goal was that France was to remain a major power and for that it could not be seen as a vassal of the US nor one of the soviets. That's also why we asked American soldiers to leave our soil, and made sure to design our own nukes and space technology (for ICBM), and while we were part of NATO and would help our allies if need be we left NATO central command so french decide on french army operations and only joined back a few years ago.

Don't get me wrong, we 100% feel part of the western block and if we had to chose we would side on the US side with no debate, but we kept good political and business relations and intend to keep it that way.

About Georgia and Ukraine

* France, like most western countries, actually didn't care much about what happened in Ukraine from a geopolitical standpoint. Some people here seem to believe it was a conflict of influence between the NATO and Russia, but Ukraine has always been in Russia's sphere of influence, we poked it, Russia reacted, nothing lost for us and nothing to gain by reacting to it ourselves. 

* When Russia went into Georgia, while Sarkozy went there to stop further aggression, as wikipedia states ""[he] did not insist on territorial integrity of Georgia"". We asked them to stop there, not to give back what they had gained. It's not because we don't care, but because we do consider Georgia as part of Russia sphere of influence (similar to how northern / western Africa is in ours and we don't want Russia to ask us to leave from our bases and operations there).

About the sale itself:

* From what I remember, the senators in question did not offer to buy the ship, but said something along the lines of ""maybe you should stop the sale and try to find a buyer in NATO instead"", giving some suggestions. That's mostly asking us to break our deal and recover the loss by selling what's been already done.

* Germany refused real sanctions in the energy or industry sectors, UK refused real sanctions in the financial sector, there was no ""major EU countries core"" sanctioning them so there was no way France would punish itself when no one would play ball with us.

* The most important point: France arms industry is known as being fair to whoever they agree to sell to. You buy from us, you get what you payed for no matter what unless you directly threaten our position. This is very different from, say, the US who tends to use the arms it sold to try and impose some behavior. To give a concrete example during the Kargil War between Pakistan and India, despite being against the conflict France allowed Dassault to help India reconfigure their Mirage 2000 for the very specific condition of that conflict because it was in the sale contract (that's considered to be part of why India wants to go with a Dassault fighter again). The one time we went against it was when we agreed to give the english technological details about our missiles that had damaged a british ship in the falklands, and that's because that situation did threaten our relation with the UK.    

That's considered a large part of why Russia agreed to the deal (their first buy of western weapon since ww2), and cancelling that sale would seriously damage that reputation.

The EU countries that could be affected by it, like the baltics or Poland, are already so close to Kaliningrad he gain in projection the Mistral provide doesn't matter, so we don't feel that this would add a significant threat to our interests.

On the other hand, in the United States, the core moral system is based on pure protestantism. The idea of bargaining power between the weak and the strong does not exist, the idea of *Freedom* to make your choices in life (as a good protestant...) is considered extremely important. That's why there are mandatory arbitration between consumers and huge corporations for instance, it was *the freedom* of the consumers to enter the contact, and if they made made a *bad choice* they were 100% *free* to do it and they should *bear* the consequences. That is why employees surrender most of their rights to privacy when they enter and use company property.  It is also common in the United States for companies to maintain data on consumers and sell this information to other companies

Nach meinem Verständnis von Physik sollte der Magnet allenfalls einen sehr kleinen Drehimpuls geben können wenn der Magnetische Fluss nahe den Rotorblättern geändert wird (vereinfacht gesprochen) und der Rotor sollte schnell wieder still stehen, an einem ""Sticky Point"". Allerdings kann der Drehimpuls trotz guter Lagerung des CPU fans und Stärke des Magneten nicht die Bewegung im Video verursachen.

Der benutzt im Video wahrscheinlich einen Reedschalter und Knopfbatterien wie andere vergleichbare yt-Videos. Auffälligerweise hält er den Magneten in all seinen Videos mit der CPU fan aus deinem verlinkten Vid an die selbe Ecke des Rotors.

Itinerary more or less hits up all the major locales in Andalusia as well as some spots around Madrid. The empty day was included in case you wanted to spend more time elsewhere. Otherwise a day trip to check out Cadiz or to hike (Sierra Nevadas, near Madrid, etc.) can be stuffed in somewhere. Northern Spain (San Sebastian, Bilbao) is also gorgeous but the itinerary I posted was mostly emphasizing southern Spain. You may want to play around with the above and plan accordingly to your own desires. The Costa del Sol, Valencia, and Barcelona have their bonuses as well, but are less cultural/historic and more so beach/nightlife-oriented, so judging from your request, you can opt out on these.

I have answered this question multiple times:

""Research suggests that if a majority of women are housewives, meaning this is the default role, the majority of them are unhappy. See The Feminine Mystique and so on.""

""Like I pointed out earlier, research has shown that a majority of women are not happy being a housewife.""

""If the majority of women want to work, which is what I meant with them being unhappy as housewives (= staying at home, the opposite of working)""

&gt; The only fact you've mentioned to back your claim is that early child care is popular. 

No, I did not. I *clearly* stated that **research has shown this** and pointed you towards one of the first and most famous works that came to this conclusion, **The Feminine Mystique**. Women who *are* housewives tend to be unhappy with that role.

&gt; There are studies supporting both sides of the argument, and there are no definitive studies that would give a solid, universal backing to either of them.

There are also studies supporting the idea that global warming doesn't exist. That doesn't say much.

I have researched the topic quite a bit because early child development is very interesting to me. The overall conclusion is most definitely that putting children in day care is not harmful when the quality is high. Of course I can quote from a dozen different studies (you yourself posted some that came to this very conclusion!), but to you any study, no matter how flawed, that comes to a different conclusion, seems to be enough to claim no stance can be taken.",0,1403765588,null,0,false,0,cihemi5,t3_291g28,t1_cihemi5,t1_cigubyx,null,1434409384,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;Are you really saying that the whole area got a ""big hit"" as a safe place because of someone throwing bacon around? Are you serious?

This was in essence bullying. And sadly I can't believe the only incidence of its type. It's not that any one event by itself looks big, but how it looks like when you encounter them more or less daily. Letting the whole thing slide off with a slap of a wrist would have been an official blessing for this sort of behaviour.

But again, I said that year was too much.

&gt;Throwing shit is not same as throwing bacon. Shit can contain harmful bacteria, causes bad smell and is probably harder to clean. Bacon is food. 

Properly handled bacon is food. Meat that hasn't been properly handled is everything that shit is, too (with the addition that some people eat it). 

&gt;You seem to be one of these people for whom the rights of the minorities and their culture is more important than the actual native people's. That's sad and I have to wonder what makes a person that way.

I'm one of those people who has worked with youths that have tried suicides because their ""pals"" at school have done small innocent jokes similar to the ones described in this newspiece. After you encounter them daily you realise that you don't have (and can never have) a place in society, which leads to suicides. Or in worse event, school shootings.

You don't need to respect minorities or their culture to treat people as human beings with odd hangups (which we all are). It doesn't really matter if somebody doesn't eat bacon because he's muslim, vegetarian or because he's dieting. Forcing people to go against their chosen decisions in arbitrary manner without a legal way (that is, without doing something extreme) is very damaging emotionally. 

It doesn't help that when you do things like target a community (no matter is it muslim, nerds or whatever) you're helping to create an harmful operating procedure that will outlast the action that caused it (or even any people involved).

&gt;The __Château de Falaise__ is a [castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle) located in the south of the [commune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commune_in_France) of [Falaise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falaise,_Calvados) (""cliff"" in French) in the [Calvados](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvados) *[département](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9partement_in_France)* of [Calvados](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvados), in the region of Normandy, France. [William the Conqueror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror), the son of Duke [Robert of Normandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_I,_Duke_of_Normandy), was born at the castle in about 1028. William went on to conquer England and become king and possession of the castle descended through his heirs until the 13th century when it was captured by King [Philip II of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_France).

&gt;Possession of the castle changed hands several times during the Hundred Years' War. The castle was deserted during the 17th century. Since 1840 it has been protected as a *[monument historique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_historique)*.

true,FleshyDagger,ESTO,Estonia,"&gt; No, I did not. I clearly stated that research has shown this and pointed you towards one of the first and most famous works that came to this conclusion, The Feminine Mystique. Women who are housewives tend to be unhappy with that role.

So you are referring to a book by freelance journalist from 1960s USA to prove that housewives in present-day Germany prefer to work? And you call this research?

Do you have an actual source that gives a figures on how many German parents would work rather stay at home, given the choice? In Estonia, for example, we've seen these figures to be tightly tied to financial situation. The most highly-educated, well-paid women were the group that saw the highest rise of birth rates after *parent's salary* was introduced that consists of child support at the level of parent's salary in the year before childbirth. This tool of financial security (!) has by far been the most effective method of stopping population decline, even though the groups that saw the highest rise were already the financially most secure slice of the society. As a side effect to this, the length of time staying at home has also increased: approximately half the parents do not work during their first year with the child. There is a sharp decrease of staying at home at the cut-off point of *parent's salary*.

See [this chart](http://i.imgur.com/uTLt8I2.png) from a study by Praxis, with summary published in [Estonian Parliament's journal](http://www.riigikogu.ee/rito/index.php?id=13768&amp;op=archive2). It's percentage of parent's who receive pay from work (left axis) for the top-paid 20% in months since the birth of their child (bottom axis). Parent's salary was introduced in 2004, and the chart displays behaviour two years prior, at the time, and two years later. At that time, parent's salary was paid for 12 months. Notice how the percentage of parents working drops by half, given the choice to stay at home - and mind you, these are the most career-oriented people. As an implication of this, the length of staying at home also significantly increased.

So the will of staying at home appears to heavily be a product of several key socio-economic factors, and not some kind of an universal thing of its own.

&gt; The overall conclusion is most definitely that putting children in day care is not harmful when the quality is high.

Of course. But the high quality isn't guaranteed, thus the comparisons have to be made against the actual situation, not some ideal model. And let's not forget from where we started - was the quality of day care high in DDR and the Soviet Union by today's standards that the research is based upon?

&gt; Se ha procedimenti razionali, allora è razionale quanto la matematica.

Allora anche la Teologia... la differenza la fanno gli assiomi (o dogmi) da cui parti. Se vedi che ti portano in contraddizione e non li cambi, c'è qualcosa di sbagliato.

That's because many villages here are called Dolno XXX and Gorno XXX, that is, lower and upper; and 'nanagornisthe' is 'uphill', so it is basically an oxymoron which means ""Lower uphill"".

true,i_fake_it,null,null,"&gt; So you are referring to a book by freelance journalist from 1960s USA to prove that housewives in present-day Germany prefer to work? And you call this research?

I pointed you towards the first groundbreaking work that revealed this fact. I never said it was the only one, nor that it's all the research I did. Your tone is becoming a bit insulting, are you aware of that? I'm not sure why you're not doing your own research, but here's more:

[Stay-at-Home Moms More Depressed, Angry and Sad, Study Says](http://www.metroparent.com/Blogs/Views-on-the-News/May-2012/Stay-at-Home-Moms-More-Depressed-Angry-and-Sad-Study/):

&gt; The study found that 28 percent of stay-at-home moms reported depression a lot of the day when asked how they were feeling the day before, but only 17 percent of employed moms did. Of the group, 26 percent of SAHMs said they experienced depression, vs. just 16 percent of working moms. And 41 percent of the at-homers reported worry, compared to only 34 percent of their counterparts.

&gt;  In Estonia, for example, we've seen these figures to be tightly tied to financial situation.

Your argument is completely missing the point - taking advantage of paid maternity leave for the first year or so does not prove that women prefer to be housewives. For starters, staying home for a couple of months is *not* the same thing as being a housewife. It's a leave of absence from work that many women view as *necessary*, not optional, for a very limited time, not lack of employment with no end in sight. Second of all, women taking advantage of the opportunity doesn't prove it's what they truly want, they might lack other options (like good and affordable day care or the father's willingness to stay home with the baby). 

&gt; even though the groups that saw the highest rise were already the financially most secure slice of the society

Duh. Opportunity costs. That hardly proves that they prefer to be housewives.

&gt; So the will of staying at home appears to heavily be a product of several key socio-economic factors, and not some kind of an universal thing of its own.

No. Because your numbers absolutely don't show that women would prefer to be housewives if they could afford to do so. Being on maternity leave and being a housewife are vastly different things. In Scandinavia, most men take advantage of paid paternity leave as well - does that prove that they would like to be housemen? Hardly.

&gt; But the high quality isn't guaranteed, thus the comparisons have to be made against the actual situation, not some ideal model. 

This is a nonsensical argument. The idea that *bad* child care is not good for children is kind of obvious, isn't it? It's like studying the nutritional values of apples and taking rotten ones into consideration - if they're spoiled, of course they're not good for you. Doesn't mean apples aren't healthy.",0,1403771421,null,0,false,0,cihfumf,t3_291g28,t1_cihfumf,t1_cihf7do,null,1434409964,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;__Ubuntu__ (/uːˈbʊntuː/ *oo-__BUUN__-too*; Zulu/Xhosa pronunciation: [ùɓúntʼú]) is a [Nguni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguni_languages) [Bantu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu_languages) term (literally, ""human-ness"") roughly translating to ""human kindness."" It is an idea from the [Southern African](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_African) region which means literally ""human-ness,"" and is often translated as ""humanity towards others,"" but is often used in a more philosophical sense to mean ""the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity"". 

&gt;In [Southern Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa), it has come to be used as a term for a kind of [humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism) philosophy, ethic or ideology, also known as __Ubuntuism__ or __Hunhuism__ (the latter after the corresponding [Shona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shona_languages) term) propagated in the [Africanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africanization) (transition to majority rule) process of these countries during the 1980s and 1990s.

&gt;Since the transition to democracy in South Africa with the [Nelson Mandela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela) presidency [in 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_general_election,_1994), the term has become more widely known outside of Southern Africa, notably popularized to English language readers by [Desmond Tutu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Tutu) (1999).

Strikers and pro-union people will try to sell you the idea that the management refuses to open negotiations or listen to grievances. That's sometimes the truth, but more often a load of self-justifying bullshit.

This air traffic controllers strike is not something I'm fundamentally against, however, because their demands are for more investment (financial, personnel, technical) in air traffic control from the airport managers. That's important; you want your controllers on top of their jobs. They handle people's lives daily. However, once again, there was no sign of a negotiation, no attempts at dialogue, which irks me. But the subject matter is too important.

The train strike a few days before, however, was a 100% political move by a trade union to keep their influence over the internal politics of the company following a proposed restructuring. No jobs were jeopardized, nobody was unable to work. It was just a question of a union wanting to keep control. Of course, there are other explanations out there, but, you know - self-justifying bullshit.",0,1403772518,null,0,false,0,cihg1rt,t3_29399n,t1_cihg1rt,t3_29399n,null,1434410058,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

1) I wouldn't call them dingy or gross. The McDonalds I've been to have been clean and respectable fast food restaurants. That said, they're still fast food restaurants. No one would ever have a date there. I suspect the customers are pretty similar.

2) There is no ""super size"" option. The big menu has been the default for years now. However, keep in mind that the largest beverage size offered by a German McDonalds is about the size of a small beverage in an American McDonalds, while the medium is the American child size.

3) Yes. Working the counter at McDonalds is low-paid unskilled labour. I imagine it's the same everywhere.

4) McDonalds has stopped selling beer years ago.

5) No. Google tells me that it's been tried out by one location this year, so I'm going to assume that's because it doesn't exist.

6) No, the whole ""freedom fries"" has not, that was just you. Product names are the same where they're specific to McDonalds and translated where they're just a generic name for the food (like french fries). The actual menu does differ, but that's normal for McDonalds. (For example the ""quarter pounder with cheese"" that is famously called ""royal cheese"" in France isn't offered in Germany.)

The first example on Duden also can't be translated as ""generally"" or ""in general"":  ""das ist ein generelles Problem"" (that is a general problem), since it's an adjective.  

However, examples do exist!  But most cases of ""generally"" or ""in general"" should not be translated as ""generell"".  

I can't really put my finger on the exact usage difference between generell and im Allgemeinen / allgemein, but there definitely is one.

Capitalists argue with the ""right regulations"" the free market can spread the wealth across the population whilst socialists would argue that capitalism even with the strictest regulation will eventually be corrupted by (what is now legal by the way in the form of ""lobbying"") corruption because the ""priavte companies"" are in the hands of a few CEO's rather than those CEO's having to suffer elections from the workers.

That's to say there's no democratic say in how companies are run in capitalist-free market economies. 

The only difference between a command economy is that it's run by the elite few that run the country.

Many small shops have bottle openers available so you can open your own bottle; this was it's still selling and not serving beer. 

Thats why some shops look around for law enforcement. 

Cops don't give a shit about it either way, but the Ordnungsamt does. If they spot a 'serving with only a selling license', the shop has to pay a fine. You as the customer don't have to worry about it either way. 
You can make life easier for the shop clerk if you ask for the bottle opener instead of asking him to open your bottle for you. 

1. Yes.
2. You have already paid for the pfand. You can return it to any shop who sells the same kind of container (Glass Bottle/plastic bottle/cans).

Siamo ad un momento in Italia dove iniziamo a definire cosa sia ok e cosa no in una società multirazziale.

Uno potrebbe dire che Balotelli, in quanto esponente del gruppo ""persone di pelle nera"" in Italia abbia il diritto di decidere come essere chiamato, e quindi, se lui dice ""n***o"", va bene cosi'.

In realtà ci sono due problemi:

1 - Lui puo' certo parlare per se stesso, ma non é portavoce degli africani in Italia. Lui é italiano al 100%, a cui é capitato ""anche"" di essere nero. Certo condivide i problemi legati al suo colore col resto degli africani in italia, ma il suo background sociale é completamente diverso

2 - la parola ""n***o"" ha un significato quando la usa lui, ma ne ha un altro quando usata da molte altre persone in italia. La gente la usa sorridendo. Lo sa che ""puo'"" essere offensiva. E la usa con una certa soddisfazione mentre (giustamente) critica difetti personali e professionali di Balotelli.

Quindi il problema é che non siamo in America, dove nella comunità black ci si puo' chiamare ""nigga"" a vicenda, e l'""n word"" é vietato per tutti gli altri. Noi siamoad un bivio, dove dobbiamo decidere se questa parola la riteniamo accettabile. Per me offre un simpatico sfogo a chi ha problemi con i neri non legati alla loro valutazione in quanto individui.

Noi la possiamo usare con un significato, ma dobbiamo essere coscienti che c'é chi la usa con ben altro significato, con una certa aggressività emozionale, e la soddisfazionedi ""poterselo permettere"". Dato che c'é l'alternativa, dire ""nero"", forse si evita di dare alibi ad un certo tipo di persona usando quello.

Alla fine dei giochi pero', non sono io o voi a decidere. E' quella comunità nera italiana, che ancora non ha scelto Balotelli come spokesperson, a decidere.

true,supterfuge,IDF,Ile-de-France,"Only my opinion here, probably not the most common one.

Strike is the main possibility for workers to make pressure. In many countries, and you seem to agree with that, the employer is the boss, and the employees owe him their job. I believe it's wrong and cause more harm than anything. It's a relationship. Without workers, there is no company. Just like lower ranked workers can be replaced, CEO can too. A company, since it serves the whole nation, has a function of public utility. It maintain jobs, which means, lives. 

It shouldn't be in the hand of only a few because of private property. Happiness of the whole &gt; Private property.

This means I agree with strikes, because the workers are pushing for better conditions of work, better salaries and so on.

I was very annoyed during the strikes that happened two weeks ago because I was late at work and so one. But still, I agreed with them. In a time when we make gifts to the richers, we shouldn't tell the workers they have to pay. Agreeing to worse conditions once means you can potentially agree to worse conditions everytime, if they present it to you with the ""greater good"" arguments.

I'd accept worse conditions in the name of the global economy if the highest paid in my company have to make sacrifices too. 

In this particular case, I don't know why they are striking for. But striking has a cost, it isn't made out of pure pleasure. They aren't slaves here to serve you. Obviously, they are necessary, and their strikes have fucking big influences. 

Well, treat them better. Nothing of significance has even been obtained only with negociations in France. Everything we have, we had to fight for it. If you think they deserve to be seen with disdain because they fight for their conditions of work, I believe you are a cancer to the improvment of society as a whole.",0,1403774992,null,0,false,0,cihghw5,t3_29399n,t1_cihghw5,t3_29399n,null,1434410268,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

Again, that is not a study. It is a simple gallup that has not been peer-reviewed, and its ""results"" wouldn't pass for an essay of a freshman due to absolute lack of references, and methodology that does not bear any criticism. Since when is mental health being evaluated through self-reported data from phone interviews? If you had ever had read the definition of depression from the ICD-10, you would not have linked me a source that starts with ""28 percent of stay-at-home moms reported depression a lot of the day when asked how they were feeling the day before"". Depression is serious illness, not something you ""feel"" on some days.

Furthermore, even if you establish that indeed to different groups of subjects have variable rates of certain illnesses, this link alone does not prove anything as long as their causes have not been determined, since depression can be the result of a number of infectious diseases, neurological conditions and physiological problems. For example, the so-called study did not account for really basic things like hypothyroidism that follows birth and elevates depression rates for stay-at-home moms up to nine months after birth.

Additionally, since the two groups live different lifestyles, it would be a very good idea to check exposure to chemical products such as cleaning agents, and their effects, and study **all** the differences arising from these lifestyles. Causes and effects are more often that not linked through several variables (like [lead in petrol](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-27067615) to increase in crime 20 years later) and it takes decades of study to establish credible links and quantify them mathematically. A newspaper poll is worlds apart from this. Most importantly, it does not demonstrate [causality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality), which is essential, otherwise the results are meaningless. I can easily demonstrate that the less cell phones a society has, the more common (sea) piracy is. But should we start airdropping iPhones into Somalia to combat piracy?

Quello che tu chiami pudore assume che la sessualità sia una questione esclusivamente privata, cosa che è molto opinabile. È convenzione culturale ma non deve essere necessariamente così. Se uno vuole esporla, fintanto che non dà fastidio ad altri, perché non dovrebbe poterlo fare? Chiaro, se a qualcuno dà fastidio, questo qualcuno non deve essere obbligato ad essere esposto perché sarebbe violenza. Motivo per cui tra l'altro non partecipo ai Gay Pride perché mi sembrano un'ostentazione violenta. Il pudore non per tutti ha un'accezione positiva, è un concetto borghese da superare, rimanendo chiaramente nell'ambito della consensualità. Poi qui non si parla di parafilie in quasi nessun caso. Io di feticisti nel giro ne vedo pochissimi (anche perché stanno per cavoli loro). E loro avrebbero decisamente più necessità di tutela.

I was referring to bold parts in these sentences:

&gt;**The investigation into rape was dropped by the first** (second counting the temp), yes, but not the other ones. **And it was only dropped for a few days** before the decision was successfully appealed by the women's counsel (who is not their lawyer).

Assange says:
&gt;On 20 August 2010, Swedish police opened a 'preliminary investigation' against me. The next day, the more serious allegation was dropped, but after an intervention police authorities reopened the closed preliminary criminal investigation against me on 1 September 2010.

August 21st - September 1st is eleven days, which I called ""a few"".

&gt;Which other ones?

The other investigations, not the other prosecutors. I refer to the previous citation again:

&gt;the more serious allegation was dropped

That was the allegation of rape. The remaining allegation, which would eventually become the three accusations besides rape that were listed in the extradition request, but which at the time was just molestation.

[link](http://www.aklagare.se/Media/Assangearendet/Kronologi-i-Assangearendet/)

The warrant was just for the rape because the other accusations were not serious enough to warrant it, but a warrant for an arrest is not the same thing as an investigation. The case, as it were, was not dropped.

&gt;So ""the time line"" is a source to what in your post how? Should I guess myself? 

The time between the dropping of the investigation into rape, and the time at which it was reopened, of course.

&gt;That's just plain bullshit, Claes Bergström is a full blown lawyer

He is, but he is not *their* lawyer in the case. He's their *målsägandebiträde*, which means he gives them legal counsel and help them with administrative tasks outside of court. It was just a parenthesis anyway.

&gt;Note that his partner Thomas Bodström was Minister of Justice from 2000-2006 and at the time was the Chairman of the Reiksdag on judicial issues.

The relevance of which is?

&gt;... to call him politically inactive is pretty much disinformation. He at no point left the party 

It's factually correct. If that's disinformation in your world, then there's little I could to to convince you otherwise. As for leaving the party, I already addressed that. The Social democratic party has 105,626 members. They are not all politicians.

&gt; Può ricordare la nostalgia (Heimweh), ma mentre la nostalgia è il desiderio di riappropriarsi del passato, spesso legato ad oggetti precisi, la Sehnsucht è la ricerca di qualcosa di indefinito nel futuro. Più precisamente, si potrebbe tradurre Sehnsucht con ""desiderio del desiderio"": deriva infatti dai termini das Sehnen, il desiderio ardente, e die Sucht, la dipendenza. Letteralmente, quindi, Sehnsucht potrebbe essere tradotto come dipendenza dal desiderio, ovvero il costante anelito che porta l'essere umano a non accontentarsi mai di ciò che raggiunge o possiede, ma lo spinge sempre verso nuovi traguardi. Un concetto affine è quello di malinconia. Heidegger, invece, ne individua un diverso significato, poiché Sucht è da intendere nel suo significato originario come ""dolore"" : ""La nostalgia (Sehnsucht) è il dolore della vicinanza del lontano""

Conosco un liceo classico dove si facevano pochi compiti scritti di matematica perché altrimenti avrebbero dovuto dare voti troppo bassi, mentre alle interrogazioni potevano dare voti più alti tanto non c'era niente di scritto come prova. Classico che è/era allora considerato buono.  
Per non parlare di quelle scuole private, quei diplomi non valgono un cazzo, conosco gente che ha cambiato scuola nel secondo semestre per evitare la bocciatura e magicamente nel giro di un mese i voti erano passati da 3-4 a 7-8.  
  
La mia personale opinione è che il problema più grande sia la grandissima quantità di docenti ex sessantottini, che non sanno un cazzo e non dovrebbero neanche avvicinarsi alla scuola e inspiegabilmente sono lì. Ho avuto a che fare con docenti di matematica che non erano in grado di fare degli esercizi di 3à superiore o che facevano errori che venivano corretti dal secchione di turno. La differenza è ancora più evidente quando ti capita un docente capace che sa la materia e ha le palle di non fare verifiche più facili perchè il collega non è stato in grado di preparare la classe, ma decide di martellare la classe con verifiche e compiti a casa, di rispiegare cose fondamentali che non erano state assimilate e che finisce l'anno con una classe con una media di voti molto più bassa ma che in realtà ha imparato, nessuno escluso (anche i rimandati) il programma.  
Gli insegnanti seri e rigorosi, sono in grado di ottenere il rispetto anche da parte degli alunni più svogliati (sarebbe necessario far capire tuttavia ad alcuni che rigoroso=/=stronzo), tuttavia essi rischiano di trovarsi contro un gruppo di genitori stupidi che si lamentano perché ""questo docente è troppo severo"", ""le verifiche sono troppo difficili"", ""pretende troppo"". Brutta tesa di cazzo tuo figlio l'hai mandato a scuola per far vedere agli amici che bei voti prende o per fargli imparare qualcosa? Brutta testa di cazzo, perché mini l'autorità del docente agli occhi di tuo figlio, rendendo più problematico per il docente gestire la classe/insegnargli qualcosa? Brutta tesa di cazzo che difendi tuo figlio sempre e comunque, credi che tuo figlio non crescerà un coglione così facendo?!?!?

Acting within your means to direct decision making towards your viewpoint is smart. Cameron could easily have done this: be it ensuring Commission positions that would reflect British sentiment (after all, the Commission President is but a single position of many), be it kick-starting serious debate about treaty reform and so on. 

Instead he went down a path of certain failure, for what result? Leaving himself less credible in the European arena? Leaving his rivals, that are very much in favour for Juncker's appointment, increasingly cohesive and strengthened in their resolve to go ahead *regardless* of British opinion?

All that remains to justify such a course would be *a gain in conservative voters*. But that is frankly a few years too late. Those *conservative voters* already made their intention clear that they wish to vote UKIP next time round as support for UKIP skyrocketed from 3% to 15%. The vote already shifted. And there is no getting it back simply because of one fact: the Conservative Party is functionally unable to suddenly make a real stand against the EU because the blow back from the Conservative party suddenly making such a stand is far greater in severity than simply maintaining the *status quo*.

Those conservative voters already made their intention clear that they wish to vote UKIP next time round as support for UKIP skyrocketed from 3% to 15%. The vote already shifted. And there is no getting it back simply because of one fact: the Conservative Party is functionally unable to suddenly make a real stand against the EU because the blow back from the Conservative party suddenly making such a stand is far greater in severity than simply maintaining the status quo. 

Lots of UKIP voters in the EU election might not stick with UKIP at the general election. I'm one such example. The more stands that Cameron makes against Europe, the more likely I am to go back to voting Conservative at the General Election (as it starts to become the best means of getting a Brexit).

*Jukkasjärvi* is a name of an actual place that is sometimes used as a placeholder for anywhere in the North, mainly because it sounds funny I think. (It's a Finnish name and Finnish just generally sounds funny and above all strange.)

true,i_fake_it,null,null,"&gt; Since when is mental health being evaluated through self-reported data from phone interviews?

Might I remind you that we are not discussing mental health but rather **happiness**? Why do you keep changing the goal posts every time you run out of arguments? The word ""depressed"" has more than one meaning. It *can* mean ""having a serious medical condition that causes a person to feel very sad, hopeless, and unimportant : suffering from mental depression"". However, it can also mean ""feeling sad"". This is one of the official definitions according to Merriam Webster. Oxford dictionaries define it as ""a state of unhappiness or despondency"". In everyday English, asking someone if they feel depressed **does not mean you are asking them if they have a serious mental illness**. You are inquiring after their happiness and their mental *wellbeing*.

&gt; Furthermore, even if you establish that indeed to different groups of subjects have variable rates of certain illnesses, this link alone does not prove anything as long as their causes have not been determined, since depression can be the result of a number of infectious diseases, neurological conditions and physiological problems.

Again, I'm not talking about a mental illness, and neither is the survey. Claiming that it's trying to diagnose serious mental illnesses over the phone is ridiculous. 

The fact that you have yet to present any kind of proof that I am wrong is quite telling too. Again, since you seem unwilling to do your own research, here's more (and it dives into the topic of mental depression, since you're so set on it):

[The Triumph of the Working Mother](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/opinion/sunday/coontz-the-triumph-of-the-working-mother.html?_r=0)- Or is the New York Times also a ""bad"" source since it doesn't agree with you?

&gt; At all income levels, stay-at-home mothers report more sadness, anger, and episodes of diagnosed depression than their employed counterparts. 
&gt;
&gt; A recent multiyear study by the sociologists Adrianne Frech and Sarah Damaske found that **women who worked full time following the birth of their first child had better mental and physical health at age 40 than women who had not worked for pay**.
&gt;
&gt; Today [...] a wife’s employment lowers the couple’s risk of divorce. Among middle-class Americans, **dual-earner couples report the highest marital quality**.
&gt;
&gt; Things are less rosy for wives who do not want to work but are forced to by economic necessity, especially if their husbands don’t pitch in at home. Such women have the least happy marriages in America. **Yet staying home doesn’t necessarily help, because financial distress is an even more potent source of marital unhappiness and conflict than it used to be.**

Or this: [Full-Time Work Means Better Health for Mothers](http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/full-time-work-means-better-health-for-mothers/?hp), which discusses the work of Adrianne Frech and Sarah Damaske in more detail.

Or how about [this 10-year-long study from the Journal of Family Psychology in the US](http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/fam-25-6-895.pdf), that comes to the conclusion that new mothers who held a paying job, whether full-time or part-time were in better health in general, and less depressed in particular, than those who did not?

Let's put it this way. Your flair says you are Scottish. You (currently, setting independence stuff aside for a moment) have many laws made by a UK-wide parliament. You vote in a general election and your candidate goes to a communal building (in London, 500km away) to debate and vote on laws with other UK representatives.

Let's say we transfer some of those powers to the EU parliament. You still vote for a representative, who still goes to debate and vote in a communal building (now perhaps 700km away in Brussels).

While it is true Westminster has lost sovereignty to Brussels, it is not true that you the voter has surrendered anything. You have exactly the same democratic mandate you've always had.

Whether this appeals or disturbs you has nothing to do with lost sovereignty. Far more to do with who you identify with as a group. If you view yourself as a Brit and Europeans as foreigners, you might not like the idea. If you view yourself as Scottish with the other Brits as foreigners, Scottish independence probably appeals.

CAMERON's ""so-called"" bid to block Junker has ""apparently"" lost allies.

This smoke and mirrors is not over yet.

For example let's look at Cameron's successful Reforms to date:-

* Cameron's phantom veto that vetoed nothing and was by-passed by inter-governmental agreements
* Cameron's EU budget cut that 6 months later led to an increase in the EU budget.
* Cameron's ""cast-iron guarantee"" of a referendum has already failed x1  and he's repeated it a 2nd time.
* Removing Juncker, an arch-Federalist to be replaced by another Federalist.

Of course the media would and had reported all of these bar the ""cast-iron dave"" as REFORM VICTORIES.

What is **reported** vs what is actually the **real outcome** don't mesh.

Let's now look at the CAMERON's so-called chances of ""RENOGOTIATION"" for ""REFORM"" if he wins the General Elections in the UK 2015:

Yes Cameron's reform/renegotiations does not stand up:-

1. Time-frame of negotiations = waaaay too short for 2017
2. Period of negotiations = too volatile for Fra/Ger elections
3. feasibility of negotiations = too improbable for 28 members, EU Com/Par
4. clarity of negotiations = too fudging it as per Wilson 1975
5. track-record of cameron = too many lies already
6. Quotes by Barroso, Reding, Shulz, Hollande, Merkel = too many Federalists
7. track record of the EU = Ever Closer Union (see barroso's berlin speech 8th may)

It's impossible for Cameron to be able to achieve significant ""reform"".

Yet Cameron is fighting ""tooth and nail"" against Junker... for what exactly, I would like to know? His 7 point plan which breaks Treaties if it is taken literally, and is already rebuffed?

Let's next look at the UK's ""so-called"" influence in the EU:-

1. UK Percentage of the Vote in the Council of Ministers under QMV = 8.2% (down from 17 in 1973)
2. The Number and UK Percentage of the Vote in the European Parliament = 73/751 ; (down from 19%-9.7%)
3. Number and Percentage of UK appointed Commissioners = 1 (down from 2), 3.6 (%)
4. FOI documents reveal that, since records began in 1996, Britain has opposed 55 measures in the Council of Ministers, and been overruled 55 times.

Yet the UK outside of the EU could have more influence on key areas that trump anything Cameron could attain with faux-reform at sub-Treaty level IN the EU. The only explanation is:-

""Economic Reform"" (1) = codeword = ""Political Integration"" (2)

On that basis it's conceivable Cameron will get a change of candidate from (2) =&gt; (1) as per public perception. It depends what message the EU is attempting to send. The only message where (1) =&gt; (2) is for the UK to go further away from the EU (in message if not in actuality).

Don't you like other 'slavs', like Bulgars and Serbs?

Yes but genetic pool doesn't matter much, it's about culture. For example, almost 1 in 4 Germans and 1 in 5 Scandinavians are closer related to the biggest North-Slav subclade, while 1 in 5 North Slavs are closer related to the main Germanic and Scandinavian subclade. But the main Scandinavian subclade is also main Serbian subclade... All that makes that Serbians are closer related to Scandianvians than to other Northern Slavs, while Poles and Russians are closer to Romanians more than to Bulgarians... Hungarians are on other hand Magyarized Serbs.

Crazy right? Well the only conclusion is that people liked to travel and plough. And all that while everyone spoke basic Indoeuropean with few hungered words.

The problem when some people say ""oh, I'm not making an emotional argument, I'm arguing purely based on logic"", is that then there's hidden implicit assumptions about principles. They get away without making these assumptions explicit which is a huge problem.

true,vlepun,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; Why do you think it's unlikely? 

Because there are still a lot of differences in the whole 'getting your license process' and also in whether or not you have a 'beginners drivers license'. 

For instance: In the Netherlands you can go out and get a drivers license when you're 17, but you're not allowed to drive without your tutor, or with peers, until you're 18. 

If you go and get your license at 18, those rules don't apply. In both cases though, you do get a beginners license with different rules for speeding, DUI's, etc. 

And then there's the educational part. In the Netherlands you can only get driving lessons by government approved driving schools. Those guys are always professional driving instructors that have to take periodic retests themselves to ensure the quality of the drivers education. You also have to get a separate theory license *before* you are allowed to try your hand at a practical exam. 

Now go to Belgium and you only have to get a theory license. Afterwards, driving instructions can be given to you by your parents (which is why Belgians can't drive for shit, they never learn how to properly drive at all). 

My advice to you is to not skimp on the money here. Get the best driving education you can afford, as it will help you out when you are in a tough spot.

True, although many don't even really know why they are not, mixing UK internal affairs with EU policy.

This is a matter of semantics. For the sake of argument, imagine an alternative reality where the UK not only opted out but manage to prevent the existence of the euro as well as the Schengen area. We'd still have an EU, but despite the name being the same these would be two very different EU's. Would that have been worth it?

Then it turned out that Gadaffi was bombing the rebels, and the UN Security Council created a no-fly zone which Gadaffi's forces violated. In response, and in accordance with the Security Council Resolution 1973, the primarily French and Brittish NATO air force in the area, enforced the resolution by destroying anything that was in violation of it.

As you can see, the US involvement in this whole affaire was really limited, as they really don't want to be part of another prolonged war. It was we Europeans who did the heavy lifting in Libya, when it comes to foreign intervention that is, the Libyans did more than we did, of course.

Violence surrounding elections is - while troubling - nothing new in young democracies. I will remind you that your own country lost nearly 40 000 people in its struggle to become a democratic nation. I have no doubt that things will eventually improve.

Regarding the Italian border, Ventimiglia is OK.  It's not pretty as such, but there is a lovely market in the centre of town.  

Just seven kilometres outside of Ventimiglia is the village of Dolce Aqua.  It is really worth a visit.  There are buses from Ventimiglia to Dolce Aqua, but they don't run frequently.  I have however made the trip by bus, and it is very possible.  You just have to get to Ventimiglia early-ish (say 10:00) and get a bus back just after 13:00.  From Nice it will be a day-trip, but you will get a beautiful train ride along the coast, see Ventimiglia and Dolce Aqua.  

From Menton you can also get a bus (No.10) to Saint-Agnes, which is the highest village along the coast.  Also from Menton is the bus to Roquebrune (bus no. 21), which is wonderful and has one of the best views of the area.

Quindi secondo me quello della lingua e delle parole è un falso problema.

Belgians drive abroad a lot of the time as well though. 

&gt; Belgium thinks its unfair to let the shitty drivers their system produces loose on foreign roads.

Hahaha, unfortunately not. 

&gt; Hence, they won't issue non-residents a license.

Your problem here is with the 'non-residents' part. As long as you become a (temporary) resident of Belgium, I think they'll issue you a license. 

The same thing goes for the Netherlands AFAIK. You have to be a resident, because the drivers licenses are handed out by the municipalities.

Cameron has proposed 7 point reform plan, but it can only be watered-down.

Thats not even taking into consideration how disruptive it is when children get back to school and how much it sets them back from where they were before the holidays both of which seem to be agreed upon by teachers.

I wasn't describing my own view, I was describing what I thought was the majority view of this sub. Maybe I have misreprsented that view.

Personally I think that the UK is in a slightly different position partly because UK public opinion is different from the rest of the EU and partly because there is a strong belief within the UK that we actually could leave. When the UK talks about leaving the EU it is therefore not just an idle threat, it is a potential reality.

It was meant to illustrate that there are still vast differences between what a drivers license is worth. In country A you actually learn to drive properly, and in country B you just don't. Those differences alone make it unlikely that what you're trying to do would be possible. 

&gt; As for reasons why I'm interested: I don't live in Germany, and both Sweden and Germany are quite expensive. Never learned to drive, 23 now, unemployed, can't spare 1400 EUR.

Ah, I just figured you lived in Germany because of the Bavaria-flair. 

Anyway, good luck in getting out of the situation.

Oh, something just popped into my head and I know it's a silly suggestion, but why not: If you're not in the position to pay for a drivers education, you could always see if you can join the military.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There could be a few options to help finance at least partially such a plan over a few decades actually :

- Selling back some of that ""lost gold"" the FED stole from Germany (the empty bank vault in NYC and such they never allow EU delegates to visitate and think everyone don't know about). Basically it means we don't suckerpunch the fuckers finances and look the other way but in exchange they give us an equivalence in their nice euro reserves stockpile.

- Converting part of the national debts as eurobond with a reseted payback timetable

- Slashing massively interests on the public debt (E.G: 120% payback bonds becoming 105% bonds). The market would hate it... but in reality would probably let it go in the end because it's better than restructuring too late and loosing half of it like in greece if shit hit the fan. Also they still make money on it.

- Some borrowing before doing the above mentioned

- Euro-integration funds. Fast paced federalization.

- Proper coordination of industrial and similar production amongst countries could save a massive chunck of the bill. I don't speak about ""banning"" or forcing entreprises etc soviet style. But for example you can use the subsidies to attract one kind of industry there and centralize another one nearby etc.

- [Fighting corruption could help recovering *billions*](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/03/us-eu-corruption-idUSBREA120KN20140203)

- Edit : Clamp down on the insane off shore tax evasion scheme. While we can look the other way with ""low taxes"" countries like Ireland or Cyprus (the money stays actually in the EU) as long as the system runs; it becomes an issue when it all goes to bahamas or they never pay *anything*.

- Brutal rise in taxable corporate income due to various automatization and (quick) technological gains. Industrial robots don't sleep or need healthcare. Just look at a Tesla factory, for real world examples of what's possible :

https://www.google.com/search?q=tesla+factory+robots&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:fr:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=sb&amp;gfe_rd=cr

- Austerity partially preped the ground for it by saving and slashing already a lot of budget posts *already*. Meaning it'll be that much we won't have to cut or find somewhere.

- Savings on the army and military budget. As much as i hate to say it right now with russia screwing over ukraine, partially passing the buck to the US and NATO does help.

- Printing some money. No, really, i'm serious. We're actually risking deflation, while the inflation target was something along 2-4% . *We can actually think about printing money and put it to actual good use and economical investment*.

- Calling in foreign investment and a few favors. I'm sure a few countries are willing to take a limited risk bet on us rather than some other areas ??? If the chinese risk it in war torn Africa, maybe they'll spend a bit on us ?

- ???

Full disclosure : I'm french, supporting Holland and love toying with those ideas, even if i don't know if that's currently appliable or as fast as some would like.

Studying options doesn't hurt itself, and if we are to take bets i'd rather we fund that than spend trillons on wars (*cough cough*) like some countries (*cough*) managed to shoulder with a worst economy in the last decade, fully in vain. 

Here, with such an economic plan even applying a part of it would not entirely lost even if numbers were totally off on a worst case level, gross mismanagement took place along with corruption . We'll have debts no matter what so better justify those with trying to reboot the economic system than whatever stupid thing we can come up with.

Here are some webpages you might find interesting (you should bookmark and visit them later on, since prices fluctuate frequently):

- TIM: http://www.tim.it/internet/offerte-internet-per-smartphone (the cheapest plan gives you 2GB/€10/month, then 5GB/€20/month and 10GB-4G/€30/month; don't look at the figures in red 'cause they don't apply to you);

- Vodafone's website is [this](http://www.vodafone.it/portal/Privati/Tariffe-e-Prodotti/Prodotti/sim-piani-internet) but I have to say, it's really confusing. I don't have Vodafone on my mobile, so maybe we should wait for someone else to enlighten us.

- Wind: http://www.wind.it/it/privati/tariffe_e_opzioni/internet/#tab_1 (3GB/€9/month, 6GB/€14/month, 12GB/€19/month). The only problem with Wind is that sometimes their coverage is hit-and-miss, or you might be in a covered area but still unable to connect.

- Tre: http://www.tre.it/opzioni/internet-con-cellulare (""Super Internet"" gives you 100MB/day but they charge you for the entire month, so you pay €5 for 100MB/day). Keep ""Data connection while roaming"" off in your phone's settings because out of all the carriers, Tre has the sketchiest coverage outside urban areas (see [here](http://www.tre.it/assistenza/prodotti-e-servizi/copertura)), and your data plan doesn't apply when it switches to the TIM network, so it could essentially suck all the credit out of your SIM card, forcing you to top-up.",0,1403789464,null,0,false,0,cihjv5k,t3_2955sj,t1_cihjv5k,t3_2955sj,null,1434412359,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5

 the reason why governments are trying to boost the oil industry ismainlg three reasons.


1. Oil prices are high since early 2000, so exporting oil gives urgently needed cash to cash strapped governments and governments

2.  Increased oil production reduces oil imports which means better trade situation


3.  Demand is needed in the economy to put back growth that was lost since the GFC


Some people are in a complete fantasy mode where they still think wind/solar ""will help economies boom"" it should be ideal for *reducing energy reliance*. But some people are in complete delusion if they think wind/solar are not a drag on the economy, in germany the heavy subsidies for solar/wind is making energy prices higher and electricity bills higher which industry there is starting to complain about rises in electricity prices.

Also many wind/solar projects compared to oil projects, both who have support by governments initially, while oil projects then take care of itself and weans off need for government help.

Your point on disruption is your personal opinion and is clearly influenced by the system you experience. Teachers from countries with longer summer breaks do no report such problems. Also, longer summer breaks gives an opportunity for more meaningful summer activities, whether summer camp or, for older children, summer jobs.

they want you to *feel* it.  

and then they say that you shouldn't care about a bus, you should care about your child. you're upset about a cartoon vehicle with eyes, what if that was your kid? would you still care about cute bus or rather about an actual little human being that's the most important thing in the world to you?

I'm not sure being Polish improves understanding of this add, but I'm convinced that being a parent is a major factor. although it probably helps when you know that every year before summer holidays there's some kind of campaign to educate people about safe travelling and especially to sensitize parents so that they themselves would make sure that a coach that is going to carry their kids across the country is safe, i.e. if it was recently evaluated and pronounced roadworthy. 

when I was a kid I remember every time before departure, be it for school trip or summer camp, parents called the cops and they arrived and tested drivers with a breathalyzer and if the vehicle had all needed papers ok. that was over a decade ago and still every summer happens an accident that involves children and a bus that wasn't supposed to even be on the road.

First off, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not deal with education even if it's oversea. A French school deals with the Ministry of Education and some other institutions regarding its location.

I don't think a French teacher who works in a foreign country is a ""détaché du Ministère de l'Éducation"". It is simply a French teacher who studied in France and happens to be employed by the Ministry of Education of a foreign country. In this case, the laws of education of the foreign country would apply to the teacher.

So in your case the teacher was still under the Ministry of Education before she left to Australia. Another reason for this is that Guadeloupe is French territory and therefore it's as if she/he were in France.

&gt;The affidavit says that if M doesn’t resume her position in Guadeloupe when her youngest child turns 8, she'll be dismissed from the Rectorat of Guadeloupe and lose her teacher accreditation and teaching qualifications. She won’t be able to teach in Australia because she won’t have her teaching qualification. Does that sound right? 

Well, it doesn't sound right to me. However the web page you gave about disponibilité says

&gt;Le fonctionnaire qui refuse successivement trois postes ou le poste qui lui est assigné peut faire l'objet d'une procédure de licenciement après avis de la commission administrative.

*The worker who refuses three offers in a row or the offer that is assigned to her/him [Your case] can be subject to a procedure of firing after a decision from the administrative commission.*

So yeah, it seems the school in Guadeloupe can fire M. However does she really lose all her teaching qualification? I'm not quite sure and if I were you I would check that. I couldn't find it on the Internet so you should either make a good search or just call the Ministry.

&gt;Is it true that all French teachers need to obtain the Certificat de Maîtresse to work in primary schools? 

Hum I don't know. This website ( http://www.letudiant.fr/etudes/secteurs/enseignement_7.html ) says that you need to study 5 years and then pass an exam (un concours - it's a sort of contest). Here: http://www.education.gouv.fr/pid97/siac1.html - You will find all the informations regarding the 1st degree contest (which allows you to work in primary schools if you get it). I've never heard about the Certificat de Maîtresse.

&gt;If M lost her qualification through 1), could she still be employed at a French-Australian school as a détaché of the Ministry of Education? Or would she need to go back to Guadeloupe and resume her position first?

No she can't because I assume the French-Austrialian school would be part of the French Ministry of Education. Just for your information: you need a master degree to become a teacher. What kind of master does she have? In France you're allowed to have a master in any field you want and pass the exam after. However they recommend you to have a master either in a field that is taught in school or a MEEF master (*métiers de l'enseignement, de l'éducation et de la formation*).

However she could try to become a French teacher in an Australian school. You'll have to check if her studies are equal to what Australia requires you to teach. This might be a bit complicated if she really loses her qualifications though.

So in the end make sure the loss of teaching qualifications is really true. She can be fired from the school she worked with but because you get fired from somewhere doesn't mean you lose your competences and certificates as well.

Oh and don't forget to call the Ministry of Education. You can explain them your case and I'm sure they will help you. It's not easy to get the information from their website and it's way better by phone call.

seriously? you're suggesting there's something *racist* about it?  

*wow.*

it's kinda funny how you're trying really hard to *""read between the lines""* but fail to see the main message that basically punches you right where it's supposed to hurt the most.

to me, all the white busses are cold and aloof, white works for it, because you're not supposed to sympathize with them. the colorful one is a main hero. he is the one that is meant to catch your attention and therefore sympathy - hence bright colors. think: a modern white leather sofa with sharp edges *vs.* an old colorful cozy couch that even *looks* soft.

and yet every summer there are accidents involving children and a bus that wasn't even supposed to be on the road.

I'm yelling loundly and angry because it's a concentrate of xenophobia, UK centrism, imperialism and various horrible right wing tendancies thinly veiled under nice words and a long speech to obfuscate the core idea. And because you dare suggest is acceptable while it's just a bank robber offering you to go away mostly intact if you surrendering him everything. 

Things he suggest in that speech are all along the lines of

- ""UK is forced to endure EU authority and we don't want that. We only want to give order""

- ""Our tax dollars should never go to eastern europe because they're dirty poor foreigners and therefore we don't like them"". Think i'm exagerating ? Here's Cameron own words : ""or their taxes are used to bail out governments on the other side of the continent."" Nice euphemism but same packaged shit deep down.

- ""let's destroy consumer and workers protection to ""boost"" the economy by allowing free reigns to corporations""

And i'm skipping about the constant rants on Juncker because he wants to integrate the EU some more.

etc etc. Cameron's thesis is about the anthithesis of any European integration idea. He wants UK removed from EU, but having a say in EU affairs; quoting ""But we would have lost all our remaining vetoes and our voice in those decisions."" 

He wants to getting EU cash but not sending any back because, quoting ""taxes are used to bail out governments on the other side of the continent"" and suggest we let half the continent, greece first, crash and have millions starve.

Basically it's thinly veiled admission he wants all the advantages, none of the inconvenients, all the cash our market brings but non of the taxes (EU funds and bailing out neighbors).

Then people wonder why the EU is laughing at the UK face. But yeah sure i'm an hysterical maniac just because i'm upset by the UK outrageous reasonment of ""all the cash and power for us in echange for nothing"".

That's not a partner offering a package. That's a highwayman trying to ""offer you a negociation"" while sticking a knife to your throat"" or borderline state terrorism against the EU. 

""I quit and disappear with all UK cash and everything we can destroy in the EU will be if you dare elect juncker and don't submit to our ""EU plan"" !"" is not an offer, and will never be, and the only thing it should get in return is a flying fuck from the EU.",0,1403797499,null,0,1403798871,0,cihnhnw,t3_29451b,t1_cihnhnw,t1_cihn1ul,null,1434414007,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"Okay, just to clarify a few things (point 3 has already been stated before but bears repeating):

1) The new (2013) European Driving Licence directive doesn't create a pan-EU licence. All it is is a way of making sure that each country issues the same model licence with identical information in the same format for ease of reading in other countries. It also eliminates some of the older paper-style licences that were still used in countries like Ireland and France. 

2) The mutual recognition of EU licences has been around for about 20 years now. All this did was just re-state that principle in stronger terms.

3) In order to get a licence in a member state, it has to be your place of habitual residence. This is set out in [Directive 2006/126/EC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:403:0018:0060:EN:PDF), Article 12 (page 9):

&gt; Article 12. **Normal Residence**

&gt; For the purpose of this Directive, ‘normal residence’ means the place where a person usually lives, *that is for at least 185 days in each calendar year*, because of personal and occupational ties, or, in the case of a person with no occupational ties, because of personal ties which show close links between that person and the place where he is living.

&gt; However, the normal residence of a person whose occupational ties are in a different place from his personal ties and who consequently lives in turn in different places situated in two or more Member States shall be regarded as being the place of his personal ties, provided that such person returns there regularly. This last condition need not be met where the person is living in a Member State in order to carry out a task of a definite duration. Attendance at a university or school shall not imply transfer of normal residence.

Honestly, even though I can't imagine many places give a damn about the residency, and would see an EU passport and not care either way, it still doesn't seem economically viable. I can't imagine that, after you account for the cost of flights, accommodation and other living expenses, it would end up being any cheaper than just doing it in Germany.

Bisogna poter certificare e accertare le competenze dei docenti in maniera formalizzata e strutturata. 
Competenze, non solo conoscenze: puoi sapere moltissimo, ma se non sei bravo a trasmettere questo sapere allora forse non sei adatto ad insegnare. 

Questa verifica deve però andare di pari passo con la formazione permanente del personale docente. 
La legislazione scolastica italiana parla del diritto-dovere del docente alla formazione. 

Ma sono solo parole vuote, da noi. Non c'è una reale applicazione di questo concetto, la formazione non è obbligatoria (e pagata dal datore di lavoro).
In altri stati europei questo è preso sul serio. E l'unico modo di prenderlo sul serio è obbligare il docente a formarsi, a seguire corsi di aggiornamento, etc. ma  **pagandogli** queste ore, perché è (dovrebbe essere) parte del suo lavoro, formarsi per insegnare sempre meglio.
In questo modo, diventa anche possibile verificare chi non è adatto ad insegnare (per ignoranza o per incompetenza), e provvedere. 

Il personale medico si aggiorna continuamente. E meno male, e infatti la nostra sanità pur con tutti gli imprevisti del caso rimane un'eccellenza.
Perché gli insegnanti no?

Almeno secondo me.

France is a country that wholly dedicated, body and soul, to preserving the way of life in 1975 (roughly). That was a good time for France, with a  booming economy and a cohesive (or seemingly cohesive) society, and the collective consciousness has been VERY much influenced by that epoch. Doesn't help that the generation hat's currently in power had their golden years back then. If it goes against the zeitgeist of the '70s, it is Bad with a capital B.

That's why we fight for globally irrelevant industries like steel foundries and car makers. That's why we try to preserve the way business was done in the 70s. That's why we're deeply, deeply defensive when e-commerce, m-commerce and stuff like that is brought up.

It's a shame, really, because French tech firms churn out some really awesome stuff. But since they weren't there in the '70s, they don't matter as much to the government and the public as a hundred steel makers who will never be able to reach any level of importance on the world stage anymore.

That's why we fight for our bookstores. That's why we want (although we're not always aware of it) to push Amazon out of the country. That's why anything that changes a business model is met with the full force of law.

Personally, I'm in favor of anything that changes an existing model. I don't care what it destroys in the process. In fact, destruction is a good thing: if it destroys something, that means it brings real change. I think public opinion is changing slowly, becoming more in favor of new models, but this government - and its successors, whoever they'll be - won't change their methods so quickly.",0,1403799670,null,0,false,0,cihojcx,t3_295i9z,t1_cihojcx,t3_295i9z,null,1434414499,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

I wouldn't be sure about this. Also, it might not be about Cameron as he won't always be leader of the Conservative Party of Prime Minister. Cameron's actions are the consequence of EUscepticism in the UK, not the cause. EUscepticism in the UK isn't going away. In the Conservative Party, Cameron is considered to be too EUphille.

At some stage the UK will have a referendum on EU membership and currently that is looking very close. If Cameron does not get his renegotiation, then persuading the sceptic UK public to stay in the EU becomes harder. Given that you don't seem to want to renegotiate (which I think is fine as a political position) then I think you also need to accept that you are making a Brexit more likely. You're never going to have the UK in the euro, as a full federal member.

Which is why honestly i wondered if they didn't used Farage as an extremist foil. A bit of a living strawman of ""what cameron isn't, look he's not *that* bad after all"".

&gt; Given that you don't seem to want to renegotiate (which I think is fine as a political position) then I think you also need to accept that you are making a Brexit more likely

... That's true. But negotiations implicate reasonable demands, which Cameron doesn't seems that much in a hurry to offer. It might be a carpet seller tactic. Asking for an arm, then asking to settle for an inch. But Bruxelles will never settle for his current demands within the EU, or at least most of those.

&gt;  You're never going to have the UK in the euro, as a full federal member.

I wouldn't say never. It'll depend on UK and probably how we would manage the economic crisis i suspect. If things become better here (rising living standard etc) i suspect people might become more federal-EU-friendly.

&gt; We both benefit from trade, whether or not we are in the EU. In my mind we can work out something mutually beneficial on trade.

That's true thought.

&gt; The UK's net contributions to the EU budget over the last decade or so have been roughly the same as France's

I'm not denying that. UK is a major contributor. But a lot western country use that already as leverage. A lot more political weight in exchange for the hard currency. For example look at greece, Germany sent a lot of money but can enforce controls on their economic policies etc. That's not negligible. The EU western gov have the most weight in every decisions too.

I feel like the UK wants too much too quickly and basically is going to loose it a lot by leaving the EU, due to immediate greed and refusing to compromise on too many things like EU laws and policies and crash bailouts. And of course i take issue to the loss of revenue that would cause too to the EU.

The trouble is, the negotiations are going to be very difficult because you and I both think what he is asking for is unreasonable and neither of us would accept it. But you think he is asking for too much and I think he is asking for too little.

We will see if renegotiation does occur: it isn't certain. The difference is that I don't think you will be asked to vote on the outcome, while I think I will be.

I know you think he is asking for a lot, but the view among a lot of Brits is that he is asking for too little. For me personally he is not asking for enough and I suspect that even if he got everything he asked for, I would still vote against it. Obviously, if the negotiations were left to you and me, we would not reach a deal.

&gt;what will happen in terms of custody if the mother genuinely can't find work in Australia once the disponibilité expires.

Well the web page on disponibilité doesn't say if the person's ability to teach is also revoked as well or not. It just says the person happens to get fired, nothing else. 

What's also tricky is that there is nothing that mentions any differences between private and public schools.

So I mostly think there information is misrepresented. Make sure you can get documents (either on the Internet by approved and reliable sources) that can explain from A to Z the procedure.

&gt;The affidavit states there are a few schools that ""are French/Australian and come under the supervision and control of the Australian Educational Ministry and the French Agency for French Schools Overseas. Teachers employed in these schools are not part of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. French teachers in those schools are 'détachés' from the French Ministry of education and employed on an alternate contract.""

Yes, I totally understand that. What I meant is she could maybe go to an Australian school (so it's fully English right) and teach French as a second language. There she would not be linked to the French government but make sure the Australian government recognizes her studies and teaching qualifications. 

What I understood from the disponibilité is that she can get fired (in other words the school refuses to take her) but she can still apply to another school. It doesn't say she loses her certificate or she would have to get another one.

This might be a bit indiscreet and I'd absolutely understand if you can't answer but how come she goes to a trial for this? I would expect this kind of situation to be treated with the union and the government unless there's been something more important such as a professional mistake.

So yeah, make sure the rule is explained correctly and whether it states or not that she can still work as a teacher (no matter where and for who). The info is very tricky so make sure it's well represented.

This is why they're called opinions. I'm sure you will get a plethora of ideas if you start questioning a relevant sample of the general population throughout the EU on this issue. 

&gt; It is possible that if the UK leaves the EU then the EU might change dramatically ""pour encourager les autres"" and it is uncertain in what direction that change will take. There could be a move towards federalism, but there could also be a move towards flexibility.



I guess it's always been the responsibility of the ""big and powerful"" to take decisions which indirectly affect everyone else. 
Too bad the bulk of the British population (which will ultimately make that call) is no less ignorant than my country's population, or any other country's population for that matter. 
There's a reason why referendums are not always a good idea on many subjects, otherwise you would get a tyranny of the majority.


&gt; If you had to learn Russian I personally would regard that as a total disaster for UK foreign policy. Ensuring that nowhere within Eastern Europe falls within the Russian sphere of influence is of paramount importance.

The rest of the world did very well with Eastern Europe in the Russian sphere of influence for 60 years, why do you think it would be any different for you now? 

I'm sure the British government will write a sternly worded letter to the UN council, condemning Russia's actions (whatever they may be), but nothing more will happen.

The takeover doesn't even have to be military, if the EU disbands. As soon as the EU disbands the usual business of corrupt politicians Romania has so diligently worked to put in jail since joining the EU will come back into power. 


Once that happens, it will be easy for the Russians to virtually turn them into a puppet regime, like Belarus is.  


They might even ostentatiously call it a ""Democratic People's Republic"", just for old time's sake.

I never understood why do Western nations have any interest in Eastern Europe, besides having a comfortable buffer zone between them and Russia, which is what also Russia is ultimately trying to have.

They got properly trained talkers, accent-free and not too fast.

They also offer news in ""easy German"" - you can read and listen at http://www.nachrichtenleicht.de/
These are official news, put into easier sentences than the ones you would find at the ""Tagesschau"" (http://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/) or ""ZDF Heute"" (http://www.heute.de/zdfheute-nachrichten-startseite-3998.html). Same contents, talked a little bit slower, mostly accent-free. Good for learning sentences as well as pronunciation. There also is a Wörterbuch at the top of each page.

For ""casual communications"" you have the problem of very strong dialects in German. For learning I would not recommend German-produced movies or TV-shows. Instead go for German dubbed movies. Almost every show or movie is dubbed in Germany. They talk quite clearly and most of the time accent-free there, too. 

Edit: Podcasts (mostly tech-oriented, relatively little accent)

- anything from the Metaebene-Podcasts (Tim Pritlove) http://metaebene.me/podcasts/

    Especially CRE for longer, tech or society-oriented shows with 2 or sometimes more talkers

Well you in NL you have basic insurance (which covers the same regardless of which company you get your insurance from) and extra insurance. Basic insurance is mandatory. You can also go for an extra package (this is optional). These kind of package include (each insurer offers different packages) things like:

* physiotherapy
* dentist 
* vaccinations (when traveling abroad, regulars are covered in basic), *glasses
* alternative medicine 
* et cetera. 

Basic coverage pretty much includes everything you need. These extra packages usually cost between €5 and €25 extra per month, depending on what you want.

I have basic insurance. I pay about €80 bucks a month. But because I'm a student the tax authority lists me as ""no income"" so I also get Health-insurance subsidy every month which is about €77.

&gt;Do you think it is cheaper than the taxes you would pay for nationalised healthcare or more expensive??

Siesta Culture - In South Europe it is common to rest in afternoon due to Heat, German Spin is ""They quit work at 1 PM!"" 

Truth = Average work day for Small-Business Owner is from 9 AM - 1 PM then take afternoon off to rest/eat/relax/sexy time and then go back to work from 5 PM until around 10PM

The reason is because Afternoon is slowest time for business in Greece, especially for small-business owners so they take afternoon off and go back to work and work late into night when there is alot of foot traffic. 

Corruption - As you can see from my links the Greek government were corrupt and took many bribes from German(And French) Military Industry corporations to buy over-priced German Military equipment . .why do you think through all this Austerity that Germany demands we continue to spend wildly on Military?

In last 2 years there have been dozens of high-profile arrests and a massive crackdown on corruption on Government Contracts especially for Military . .changes in Greek consitution to allow a 3rd party Greek Court look over contracts to make sure nobody is cheating money, and things such as this. 

Tax Dodging - German Spin: ""Look at all those Greeks tax dodging!"" Truth is that the average citizen was not capable of cheating taxes . . the way the Tax system was set-up Pre-2008 was that a Small-Business Owner would get around 10-12 Major Taxes to their business and would have to pick which ones to pay to avoid punishment . .  the Wealthy Ship/Hotel/Club Owners were able to avoid 100% Tax of any kind by just bribing. . . this Tax system was a mess and has been completely overhauled with a new Modern Tax Agency + Tax Enforcement and Taxes have been modernizes so instead of receiving 10+ Major complex Taxes which was inefficient, Taxes have been streamlined and easier to complete. 

Social Capital? - I am not sure what this means . . I will take a guess and think you mean the wildly inefficinet and corrupt Public Sector Pre-2009? 

This was the one thing that was 100% true and since 2009 there have been over 300,000 people made redundant in Public Sector and a new Grading System was put in place in late 2012 to grade Public workers to make sure they are working for their government Money, with Salary or redundancy based on this Grade.

And look at those stupid Dutch people with their stupid budgetairy rules:

&gt;The 3% rule and the subsequent penalties were formulated to prevent bad budgetary policies in one member state having an effect across the eurozone.
The pact has been controversial, with critics saying its focus on fighting inflation means it is ill-equipped to deal with slow growth.
But smaller countries, including the Netherlands, have insisted that all 12 eurozone members should stay in line.

Judging by your post history, you seem to have an unhealthy obsession with this word combination. 

As for the pension issues, it won't be a problem because private pensions are owned by multinational corporations.  It doesn't, and shouldn't matter where you live when you receive your pension, as long as you have worked for it.


Also, emmigration is usually a one-way path. They will eventually become citizens, and receive the pension in their new country.

A quote:
&gt;Jean-Claude Juncker ist ein pfiffiger Kopf. ""Wir beschließen etwas, stellen das dann in den Raum und warten einige Zeit ab, was passiert"", verrät der Premier des kleinen Luxemburg über die Tricks, zu denen er die Staats- und Regierungschefs der EU in der Europapolitik ermuntert. ""Wenn es dann kein großes Geschrei gibt und keine Aufstände, weil die meisten gar nicht begreifen, was da beschlossen wurde, dann machen wir weiter - Schritt für Schritt, bis es kein Zurück mehr gibt.""

For those who don't speak german:

When asked how the EU will be build he (litterally) says:

""We decide something. Then we announce it. We wait a while. When no one complains, because people don't know what we decided anyway, we continu - step by step until there is no way back"".

&gt;**Poland just had the best 25 years in half a millennium, but its transformation remains unfinished**

&gt;OVER most of the past decade, the European Union has been in a sorry state. Countries such as Greece and the newest member, Croatia, are basket-cases. Ordinary voters have lost trust in the EU: at the recent European elections barely two-fifths of them bothered to cast a ballot and almost a third of those who did backed anti-European or populist parties. Instead of devising a convincing response, European leaders will spend this week’s summit bickering over whether Jean-Claude Juncker, an uninspiring old-school federalist from Luxembourg, is the right person to run the European Commission.

&gt;Yet one big country defies the general gloom: Poland, the subject of our special report this week. Once considered the problem child of central Europe, Poland has seen its economy grow since the collapse of communism by more than any other in the EU. It was the only EU member to avoid a recession during the financial crisis. And it has managed to have more cordial relations than ever before with its two big neighbours (and former occupiers), Germany and Russia—or it did at least until Russia annexed Crimea earlier this year. It is hard to think of any country in Europe, rich or poor, that can’t learn something from Poland.

&gt;[GDP % Change on a year earlier: Poland vs. Euro Area](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/print-edition/20140628_LDC236.png)

&gt;**From periphery to core**
How did Poland do so much better than central Europe’s stars—the Czech Republic, for instance, with its deep industrial roots? Unlike most of its ex-communist neighbours, which opted for a softer transition to capitalism, Poland embarked on “shock therapy” in 1990, masterminded by Leszek Balcerowicz, then finance minister. Almost overnight price controls went, markets were fully opened to foreign trade, the zloty was made convertible, subsidies to state-owned industries were slashed and privatisation began. This was painful for nearly everyone, but after a short, sharp slump in which GDP shrank by almost 15%, growth resumed in 1992—and it has not stopped since.

&gt;The biggest single contribution to Poland’s success, however, was its effective use of EU membership. The Poles were quick to see the opportunities in the EU’s structural and cohesion funds as well as the benefits of improving their own governance and transparency. Poland fought harder than Romania, Bulgaria and its Visegrad peers against corruption, especially in public procurement, and has a decent record of using structural funds as a result. The EU has rewarded Poland’s probity by making it the biggest recipient of its funds (a whopping €102 billion, or $139 billion) between 2007 and 2013. The country will once again get the biggest chunk (€106 billion) in the next multi-year budget from 2014 to 2020.

&gt;However, Poland’s third lesson is the one that matters most: the job is never done. Poland has kept pushing ahead with reforms, in a way that Germany has not, let alone France. And there is still more work to do, such as slimming the bloated public sector, raising corporate and private saving and investment, and persuading more bright Poles to stay at home rather than emigrate. Poland will avoid the “middle-income trap” only if it can develop higher-tech industries and services.

&gt;Over the past seven years the Civic Platform government has done well at combating complacency. But now it is stuck in a nasty scandal, based on tape recordings of boozy conversations between leading politicians. In one, Radek Sikorski, the foreign minister, calls the Polish-American alliance “worthless” and mocks Britain’s prime minister. The government seems likely to tough the scandal out. But even if Polish ministers lose their jobs, Mr Juncker and Europe’s timid leaders should not miss the main point. If they had run their countries half as well as Poland, Europe would not be in such a mess.

Also, this weeks edition of The Economist has a 7 article special report devoted to Poland. I copied the links here. If anyone needs me to copy and paste the body of the text of those articles, let me know and I will gladly post them here (or maybe I should post them seperately to /r/europe?)

true,matude,ESTO,Estland,"&gt; THE founders of the internet were academics who took users’ identities on trust. When only research co-operation was at stake, this was reasonable. But the lack of secure identification is now hampering the development of e-commerce and the provision of public services online. In day-to-day life, from banking to dating, if you don’t know who you are dealing with, you are vulnerable to fraud or deceit, or will have to submit to cumbersome procedures such as scanning and uploading documents to prove who you are.

&gt; Much work has gone into making systems that can recognise and verify digital IDs. A standard called OpenID Connect, organised by an international non-profit foundation, was launched this year. Mobile-phone operators have started a complementary service, Mobile Connect, which allows identities of all kinds to be authenticated from smartphones.

&gt; But providing a digital ID that will be widely used and trusted is far harder. Businesses can check their employees rigorously, and issue credentials for gaining access to buildings, computers and the like. But what about outside the workplace? Facebook, Google and Twitter are all trying to make their accounts a form of ID. But these are issued without verification, so pseudonyms are rife and impersonation easy.

&gt; Private providers are offering their own schemes; miiCard, for example, uses bank accounts as a way of issuing a verified online identity. But these fall short of the reliability of a state-backed identity, issued by a government official, checked against other databases, using biometric data (such as fingerprints and retinal scans) and backed by law—in effect an electronic passport.

&gt; There is one place where this cyberdream is already reality. Secure, authenticated identity is the birthright of every Estonian: before a newborn even arrives home, the hospital will have issued a digital birth certificate and his health insurance will have been started automatically. All residents of the small Baltic state aged 15 or over have electronic ID cards, which are used in health care, electronic banking and shopping, to sign contracts and encrypt e-mail, as tram tickets, and much more besides—even to vote.

&gt; Estonia’s approach makes life efficient: taxes take less than an hour to file, and refunds are paid within 48 hours. By law, the state may not ask for any piece of information more than once, people have the right to know what data are held on them and all government databases must be compatible, a system known as the X-road. In all, the Estonian state offers 600 e-services to its citizens and 2,400 to businesses.

&gt; Estonia’s system uses suitably hefty encryption. Only a minimum of private data are kept on the ID card itself. Lost cards can simply be cancelled. And in over a decade, no security breaches have been reported. Also issued are two PIN codes, one for authentication (proving who the holder is) and one for authorisation (signing documents or making payments). Asked to authenticate a user, the service concerned queries a central database to check that the card and relevant code match. It also asks for only the minimum information needed: to check a customer’s age, for example, it does not ask, “How old is this person?” but merely, “Is this person over 18?”

&gt; Other governments have tried to issue electronic identity cards. But costs have been high and public resistance strong. Some have proved careless custodians of their citizens’ data. There are fears of snooping. Britain had spent £257m ($370m) of a planned £4.5 billion on a much-criticised ID card scheme by the time the current coalition government scrapped it after coming to office in 2010.

&gt; That has left a gap in the global market—one that Estonia hopes to fill. Starting later this year, it will issue ID cards to non-resident “satellite Estonians”, thereby creating a global, government-standard digital identity. Applicants will pay a small fee, probably around €30-50 ($41-68), and provide the same biometric data and documents as Estonian residents. If all is in order, a card will be issued, or its virtual equivalent on a smartphone (held on a special secure module in the SIM card).

&gt; Some good ideas never take off because too few people embrace them. And with just 1.3m residents, Estonia is a tiddler—even with the 10m satellite Estonians the government hopes to add over the next decade. What may provide the necessary scale is a European Union rule soon to come into force that will require member states to accept each others’ digital IDs. That means non-resident holders of Estonian IDs, wherever they are, will be able not only to send each other encrypted e-mail and to prove their identity to web-service providers who accept government-issued identities, but also to do business with governments anywhere in the EU.

&gt; Estonia is being “very clever”, says Stéphanie de Labriolle of the Secure Identity Alliance, an international working group. Marie Austenaa of the GSMA, a global association of mobile-phone firms, praises it too. Allan Foster of ForgeRock, a firm that is working on government ID schemes in Belgium, New Zealand and elsewhere, thinks that the new satellite Estonians will help change attitudes to secure digital identities in their own countries, too.

&gt; The scheme’s advantages for Estonia are multiple. It will help it shed the detested “ex-Soviet” tag and promote itself as a paragon of good government and innovation. It will attract investment: once you have an Estonian ID, setting up a company there takes only a few minutes. And it will create an electronic diaspora all over the world with a stake in the country’s survival—no small matter at a time when the threat from Russia is keenly felt. (Estonia is also planning to back up all its national data to secure “digital embassies” in friendly foreign countries.)

&gt; Struck by the X-road’s scalability and security, and the fact that it has already worked well for over a decade, Finland and other countries are adopting the Estonian system in whole or in part. But for foreign individuals, perhaps its greatest appeal is that it is optional. Those who like the system’s convenience, security and flexibility can apply (though Estonia’s chief information officer, Taavi Kotka, who is taking time away from his real-life job running an IT company, stresses that the ID is a privilege, not a right). Those who feel queasy about a foreign state having access to their personal data can steer clear.

&gt; Mr Kotka says that Estonia aims to do for identity what American Express cards did for international travel in the 1960s: to simplify life. But the bigger point is that government-verified identity has been divorced from location. If Estonia’s scheme takes off some other countries may well decide to follow its lead. Some may aim at volume; others, to target the top end, as with the market in non-resident investors’ passports. Soon, multiple satellite citizenship may even become the norm.

That 630,000 number may sound large, and may make it sound like it is decently common, but we have a large enough population where those 630,000 households could all be in remote, rural areas. I don't spend any time in those areas, and neither do the vast majority of the population. So if I have never heard of a building of any kind not having indoor plumbing, nor has anyone that I know, it is easy to see why I would think that is not an issue.

Hell, the legend you cited has the darkest areas at 1.25% of households, which is a tiny fraction. The places they mention with the highest percentage is a small community in South Dakota (never been to that state), and indian reservation in Arizona (I lived in that state, that reservation is extremely remote, and non-Apache aren't really allowed there without permission from the reservation). And Alaska has many, small, remote villages.

Once again, the places they mention are tiny places in remote areas of the country. I have no contact with those places, nor does 99% of the rest of America. So yeah, it's easy to see why I thought homes without plumbing are extremely rare...they are.

true,bobdole3-2,UNSA,United States of America,"In **theory** fusion is basically the magic bullet for all our energy needs. It generates significantly more energy then traditional nuclear reactions, and nuclear is already pretty good. And we know for a fact that fusion is a real thing, seeing as we use it for bombs.

The problem is that to date, it takes more energy to contain a fusion reaction than the reaction generates. It's been like this since day one, and even after more than half a century which has seen leaps and bounds in just about every other field, the same basic problems still persist. 

This has lead lots of people to believe that it's just a wasted effort. Even if fusion power is theoretically possible, we're so far away from making it practical that it's not even on the horizon. After billions of dollars and decades of research going absolutely nowhere, many people are of the opinion that we're better off putting the time and resources we're throwing at fusion into just about anything else. Even if fusion might be the better investment *eventually*, something like solar is available *now*, so we might as well put the money into that and then revisit fusion after we've made some more leaps in material science or something. 

edit: note, I'm not exactly an expert in the field of nuclear fusion. The issues involved are obviously a lot more complex. But the tl;dr is that if it ever works it'll be revolutionary. But right now it doesn't work, and there's no reason to think that it's ever going to work in the immediate future. This means that a lot of people see it as a waste of resources which could be better spent elsewhere.

Ok, now I'm pissed.

I pissed for a simple reason: the whole of Italy, newspapers in the front row, is shoveling shit on workers of Pompeii for having not only because it was their right but also their duty.

I say 'duty' because the problems that finalmentei workers bring to the attention of national audiences are serious and affect not only the current operation of the site but also its preservation for posterity. They do this after years in which they have attempted the ordinary way of mediation (which dishonestly insnua Polito has never been proven).

For these problems you list I want to use a source that can not be accused of bias against workers, since it is located on the opposite side of the fence and is contrary to industrial action these days: Antonio Irlando, president of the Centre Cultural Heritage. Returns the Messenger:

&gt;In fact, regular pay the arrears of services provided by the custodians, to adapt their workplaces to the standards of health and safety of workers, organize more efficiently the performance of daily work, strengthen the workforce of those who must supervise the excavations of Pompeii using also the mobility of staff, issues that do not seem to ...

The list of Irlando lists the symptoms of the main problem that plagues today Pompeii: the devastating inadequacy of staff and custodians of their infrastructure with respect to the size and needs of the site.

Pompeii is a real city. Worse, it is a city in ruins, the buildings have neither door nor original windows, which means that you can (easily) move not only in the streets but inside and outside the buildings themselves. The surface that is to be patrolled is much higher than that of a modern city of comparable size, because even the interior of the structures is open.

Even just the simple surveillance requires a considerable organic. One hundred guardians may seem like a lot, or at least enough, until you consider that in addition to the surveillance of the roads is also necessary to ensure that access to the site and the presence at the ticket office (during the day, while at night it should be ensured surveillance Pompeii is patrolled 24/7).

But the work does not end with the custodians of the surveillance. For conservation reasons, a good part of the structures of Pompeii have restricted access: you can only enter in groups with a guide. The keys of the gates that close these homes are in the hands of the guards, who spend all day, literally, going from one house to another to open them to the various guides and then close them when the group leaves.

But that's not all. Pompeii is an archaeological site active: there are excavations (the city is far from being fully excavated) and are, above all, archaeologists and art historians working on what has already been dug. Typically, these archaeologists moving between homes that are closed for conservation reasons or safety; the guardians must also ensure access to these homes, going to open and close the gates.

How do I know all these things? because I worked there. I have seen with my own eyes the tables and organic rounds, I saw with my own eyes how they work and how much the guardians are responsible, I saw with my own eyes the tourists behave continuously by morons, as to make completely self-evident the need for guardians who try to prevent the worst crap.

And the truth is that the fund custodians is terribly understaffed, bound by idiotic regulations to make the keychain instead of the guardian (but they have no choice, the regulations do not make them) and completely inadequate to ensure even the opening of the houses per visit (by now are closed to turn some houses that should be open, because there are not enough men for surveillance). On top of that they also take insults bloody when there are crashes or other damages, even if the guardians have absolutely no power even prior to this.

If we want to put their cargo, their structures are working from the third world. The central office is a very old and dilapidated building, no air conditioning (and I assure you that it's hot in Pompeii), with bathrooms embarrassing (at least gave them the locker rooms were redone and are ok). The bridge radio does not have a proper penetration, so that it is impossible to move the guardians promptly when you have special needs (large groups etc..).

The fact is and always will remain that US murdered with those bombs between 150.000 - 250.000 men, women and children, without discrimination. It's not IF. US murdered innocent civilians without discrimination.

As for the argument that it prevented greater casualties, this is one of the most mind bending examples of stupidity I've ever seen.

**It's ok to kill a few for a greater purpose?**

Fuck. Then you need to immediately answer these:

* How many Americans it's OK for terrorists to murder before your lawmakers and secret services rape every single American citizen of their civil rights?
* How many Americans it's OK for terrorists to murder before you have someone felling your balls every time you get in a plane?
* How many Americans it's OK for terrorists to murder before your troops proceed to the Middle East to cause chaos, countless deaths (there was a time when terrorist attacks in Iraq were a daily occurrence and causalities were frequently in the dozens) and millions of people displaced from their homes.

So if you accept that US did the right thing to murder 150.000+ people for a greater good, then you need to put hard numbers on how many Americans you are prepared to have murdered before all of the above are acceptable.

I sure knew who I was voting for, and so did the rest of the 40% of romanian voters (as in presidential candidate). While Juncker didn't come to Romania, because the Romanian parties that are part of the EPP were doing pretty bad, the other candidates came onto tv shows, and interviews, and even appeared at the local party's conferences.

Take a look at this [graph](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/files/2014/06/hixchartlabel49jun.jpg).

I'd be terribly ashamed if my country was in the position that the UK is in on that graph. But I wouldn't blame the people, I'd blame the parties. 

Also I'm proud that the people in my country were more involved in the DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT IS VOTING than some of the more *'civilized'* western countries.

EDIT: According to [this](http://www.aecr.eu/media/AECRAMR-European-election-poll.pdf)

16% of my fellow countrymen knew about JUNCKER, even though he didn't even come to romania. 52% knew of Schulz.

42% of the romanian voters knew that voting for parties is idirect support for the president. 

I'd say that's pretty damn decent for a country that started being democratic only 25 years ago.

The best we can do for MENA countries is help the people decide that they want a proper government, aid them in efforts to impliment votations and rights.
