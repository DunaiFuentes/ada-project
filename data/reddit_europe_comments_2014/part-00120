Nope! 

Problem with you and people like you is all they see about Communism is the USSR, despite the fact, for example, the Limerick Soviet is grassroots and Marxist in nature, whereas the Bolshevik Revolution was Leninist, Stalin's rule was Stalinist, and after that it was Crony Capitalist under the guise of Marxist-Leninism. Not that I blame you for your views in the slightest, in stems from a poor history under the USSR and poor education on Communist ideology(Which on the latter I definitely don't blame anybody for, it's really hard to sit down and read about it).

Ignorance about Communism's diverse possibilities has more or less lead you to see it all as one block; Statist, Centralised, Communism. Whereas Marx and most common mainstream Communist thought is for decentralized democratic rule.

Both Lenin and Mao staged Communist revolutions in countries which have more or less been universally declared as unfit for Communist Revolution, and because of that they were forced to enact un-Communist dictatorial rule. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is all Stalinists and Communists but not all Communists are Stalinist. For example the Eurocommunism branch specifically denied Stalinist influence and after the Prague Spring many West European Communist Parties identified with that.

And I don't Hungarian Communism would have been so bad had the USSR let things take their course and let Hungarian Communism take its course of natural evolution.

The higher risk of a borrower you are the higher the interest rate will be. So for Greece to get loans that don't come with extremely high interest rates other countries need to guarantee these loans, meaning that if Greece decides to not pay they will haver to pick up the tab. The same way your parents might guarantee your first mortgage.

The question isn't if Greece should or should not have defaulted in this specific discussion, it's a separate one. I'm myself fairly sure that Greece would have been better off if it defaulted and left the Euro. Problem is that the EMU member states didn't want this as it would hurt the Euro as an idea more than actually hurt it (at least that is my opinion), so to keep Greece in the EMU they had to do something and that was to bail them out.

By having the other states bailed Greece out it gets access to cheap credit which it would not have had access to otherwise.

The article (if you can call it that given its lack of details) states otherwise:  

&gt;misguided policies favoring the construction sector and penalizing farmers have driven people away from rural areas and caused Italy to lose 15% of its countryside  [...] with some 1.2 million farms shutting down

I interpreted that has ""farmers don't tend to their land anymore as they move to cities in search of higher-paying jobs.""  


Anyway, I looked for the original articles (in Italian) and they aren't that insightful either, but they do state that ""overbuilding"" and ""abandonment"" are the causes of the reduction of countryside. They also mention that forest area expanded 20%, but ""spontaneous plant grown due to the abandonment of agricultural territory increases the risk of landslides and fires.""

Wir leben in einer modernen Gesellschaft.  Das beinhaltet Fortschritt - und ein grosser Grund für diesen ist Bequemlichkeit, d.h. Entwicklungen, die mein Leben einfacher machen.  

Das ist abzuwägen gegen eventuelle ökonomische und sonstige Schäden, die durch meine Bequemlichkeit verursacht werden, und wenn ein Ungleichgewicht entsteht, gilt es, den Gebrauch der Elemente dieses Fortschrittes zu bremsen oder steuern.  Deswegen z.B.: in London eine Verkehrssteuer für Autofahrer in der Stadt während bestimmten Zeiten.

Aber zur Zeit überwiegt der Wert den der autofahrende Teil der Gesellschaft empfindet, grösstenteils den Schaden.  Spezifische Elemente, wo dies stark nicht der Fall ist, sind Verstopfung und Verschmutzung.

You are wrong. I myself am not American, I was born in South Africa and grew up in Australia. It is very common in those countries for people to identify themselves with a separate ethnicity from their nationality. Every South African understands what it means when a person says that they are English or Portuguese. They mean that their family comes from England or Portugal (in the South African context they are usually contrasting their ethnic background with the Dutch-descended Afrikaners). In Australia the majority of people of European descent come from English families. But there are also large populations descended from Irish, Italian, and Greek immigrants, and they see themselves as slightly different from the English. If somebody says that they are Italian in that context, it is understood that they mean that they are descended from Italian immigrants. 

You mentioned Canada, and I can assure you that the same is true there. My Canadian friends openly identify themselves with their ethnic backgrounds (in the case of one close friend, this background is Polish as her family is descended from Polish immigrants).

There are also diaspora groups in other parts of the world who consciously make an effort to continue to some extent the culture of their ancestors in their new countries. German-speaking communities in Argentina come to mind.

&gt;  You are of Irish heritage. Which is fine, and its cool to embrace that.

If it is true I am  less opposed to it because then it can be understood as a new kind of the old ""technician"" degrees.

The problem is for example in Hungary that construction engineers must memorize the blueprint of the Sistine Chapel and Louvre instead of practical stuff. We are very much theory focused and not on practical skills. The Bologna Model seems to be the opposite, practical skills first, theory later.

My personal experience is that if you teach people theory first, they are not interested, just memorize it, take the exam and forget it.

In France for example, Labor Unions essentially act as lobbies, and they're particularly powerful. That's why we have the (true) stereotype of striking all the time, and not getting any labor reforms done.

Otherwise, if I dare be more controversial, there's this Jewish organization (I personally have nothing against Jews, but this is quite notable) called [CRIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conseil_Repr%C3%A9sentatif_des_Institutions_juives_de_France) in France, which blows my mind (and does a disservice to Jews IMO) by managing to organize dinners with every new French president, or important French political leader, to discuss issues relating to the Jewish community in France, and also Israel (it's a fairly famous event, called the ""diner du CRIF""). They're definitely a Jewish or Israeli lobby, right there in the open.

No, Great Britain did that 15 years ago but french adminstrations are just thinking about it. 

Since train are operated by a national company, you can have national information and ticket buying (except for trains around Paris which are special).

For national trains, I'm using : https://www.capitainetrain.com/ which is lighter and faster than the official website.

You also can find buses to travel from town to town : http://www.eurolines.fr/ 

For Paris and the region around it you may use :
http://www.vianavigo.com/ 
(check for tickets, there are special tourists tickets for a few days which are cheaper and more easy to use (and that can gave you access to museum and things like that). 

For any other places... You'll have to check by yourself. Some regions has one website for every public transportation network but for a lot of them, each network has its own website. 

Send me a message if you have more specific questions.

true,vlepun,NETH,The Netherlands,"Those fields are closer to automation than you'd think. With one exception -- doctors &amp; medical operations. There is just too much we don't know yet when it comes to the human body. Another problem is interaction and asking the right questions. AI isn't as of yet anywhere near sophisticated enough to replace humans on that front. 

However, when you take a look at the other areas you've noted you can see that a lot of these will be replaced by automation in the coming 20 years, given legislation doesn't stall the process further. Aeroplanes already fly themselves for the most part, there are parts in The Netherlands where automated buses drive (and due to legislative issues regarding liability that's almost always on a private area), and both cars and trucks are fast becoming autonomous. 

Now when looking at the future, there will be other jobs. A lot more emphasis will have to be placed on customer care I think. Consider this: When every company is supplying the same service, where will they get the upper hand over their competitors? Customer service, repair turnaround times, that sort of thing. 

However, I do feel that we need to get to some sort of basic income scheme. Just look at the current situation in a lot of European countries where the middle class is eroding (Germany is a good example of this, they're on the forefront here), and a lot of people who used to contribute to society are now having to rely on food banks and the like to get by. Not in the least because of failing ""social"" housing. 

Part of the problem also is that neither government nor companies value the person as an employee any more. They just look at the skills, and skills are more easily replaced than people. It's a very cold way of dealing with people. It's also why the reforms that have happened in a lot of European countries with regards to pensions will fail. No one wants to employ someone who's past the age of 55. Just take a look around at the unemployment lines, talk to your older neighbours -- you see it happening everywhere. So if we want to succeed, we as a society need to change a lot of things. ",0,1398675173,null,0,false,0,ch4044k,t3_2452mm,t1_ch4044k,t1_ch3vwlh,null,1433554912,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

That comes in the guise of moving as close to a single market is possible i.e. a company can compete in one country as though it was its home country. For that to happen, institutions are required that can harmonise and arbitrate disputes. On a multi-lateral basis, that is significantly easier with a law-making institution like the EU. 

Even without the move to a completed common market, you see the need for separate institutions, though not necessarily with the ability to create legislation in their own right. In the EU-ROK FTA, there was the reliance on WTO-esque situations, EU working groups to consider the effects, and so on. With the EU-USA FTA, separate institutions are also being set up like ISDS. 

Generally, the more close the Union you seek, the more powerful the mediation mechanisms need to be.  The closeness of the EU free trade area to single-market status is unrivaled, excluding single sovereign countries from consideration of course, and that is what was desired.

But Russia's defense budget has risen 92% since 2010. And they are going to double their defense budget in the next three years.
The objectives are clear: by 2020, to have 1 million active-duty combat-ready personnel equipped with the most modern weaponry and equipment. Adding to the already existing military vehicles are 2300 new tanks, some 1200 new helicopters and planes, 50 new surface ships and 28 new submarines. Also, 100 new military communications satellites are going to be deployed into space.

This happens in a time when many of the EU countries that are part of NATO have reduced their military spending due to the economic crisis. Of the 25 European members of Nato, only Britain, Greece and Estonia met an unofficial target of spending at least 2 per cent of national income on defence last year. The average figure was only 1.3 per cent. Also, the UK, for instance, is intending to reduce it's ""regular army troops to their lowest number since the Battle of Waterloo, to roughly 82,000 by 2018, and to withdraw all its 20,000 troops stationed in Germany.""

What is keeping NATO alive is the US military spending. However, the US military is spread out to it's limit with their presence in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Also, the US economy hasn't yet recovered from 2007. Politically, I don't think Obama has the political strength to do anything more than diplomacy. Furthermore, 2016 elections are coming and the balance of power in both Congress and Senate has more than once showed that it will be hard for any politician to raise US debt even further.

Let's ask the question: **""Why?""**

[From the archive, 2 January 2002: Euro 'inevitable' for UK](http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/jan/02/euro-eu-currency-uk-sterling)

&gt;*The Europe minister, Peter Hain, asserted it was not sustainable for sterling to co-exist indefinitely alongside the new European currency.*

&gt;*Mr Hain, speaking on the day of the euro's launch, said: ""I doubt in the end that it is possible to run a sort of parallel currency economy"".*

&gt;*""The euro is real now. It will cease to be that source of myth, prejudice, fantasy and fear and become a practical day to day reality. That will enable people to make a sensible decision about it, and I welcome that"".*

&gt;*He added: ""The increasingly urgent question for British citizens is whether we want to get left behind yet again as we have been consistently in Europe.*

&gt;*He also repeated Foreign Office warnings that British political influence would be reduced if the Blair government ruled itself out of membership indefinitely.*

&gt;*""We can be a leading power, as we already are, but if we want to be a decisive leading power, it is difficult to see how we could be that if we ruled ourselves out of joining the single currency for ever"".*

No wonder the people have lost trust in the elite political classes and their massive failure of good judgement such as Mr. Hain's prophetic visions of the UK outside the EURO. 12 years ago and still this man is trotted out to tell people what to think and he wonders why people don't trust the governments in power.",0,1398682637,null,0,false,0,ch418ro,t3_245rqf,t1_ch418ro,t3_245rqf,null,1433555503,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

The answer needs to ascertain, as per RAE North's [Flexcit: how we would actually leave the EU](http://www.eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=84857):-

&gt;*...any degree of familiarity with the character of the debate on Britain's 
EU membership indicates that access to the Single Market, and the related matter of maintaining high levels of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), are totemic issues. It is our view that any successful ""out"" campaign fought during a referendum must have confronted these issues. And we would assert that success will have required firm, unbreakable assurances that access to the Single Market, upon which FDI depends, will be preserved.* 

&gt;*...To do so, assurances on continued membership of the Single Market will have been needed. Irrespective of the actual merits of membership, we do not see that a campaign could have succeeded without unbreakable assurances of this nature, to ""kill stone dead"" the business and foreign investment case against withdrawal.*

&gt;*Britain is already party to the EEA, so all the technical measures are in place... There is an unresolved question of whether Britain would cease to become a member of the EEA on leaving the EU and would have to re-apply on rejoining EFTA.*

&gt;*...EFTA membership would have its own advantages, allowing Britain to tap into extensive consultation arrangements with the EU, and also give it access to the free trade areas to which the Association is party. Furthermore, the result would be a significant trading group, putting it fourth in the world trade league after China ($3,642bn) and ahead of Japan ($1,678bn). ""EFTA-plus"" would be a significant global player.*

**TL;DR**: Basically the starting conditions (politically, economically, diplomatically, media-circus, establishment's resistance and the referendum (successful!) renegotiation period of 2 years under Article 50) DICTATE in large part the above course of the UK must set to navigate this **transition phase**.

&gt;la bouffe (y a une diversité impressionnante).

J'ai pas l'impression qu'il y ait tant de diversité que cela. Je dirais que comparativement il y a moins de variété de fruits et légumes qu'en France par exemple.

&gt; Après, aucun pays n'est parfait. Y a tout un tas de protocoles à connaître, c'est parfois assez difficile de lire les Japonais et on se demande parfois si leur amabilité est du lard ou du cochon (mais je suis à Tokyo, le Paris japonais). 

Tout le concept de honne et tatemae. Ils sont formés à fournir ce service et ils se font taper sur les doigts s'ils ne respectent pas cela.

&gt; Y a un peu de xénophobisme aussi, plutôt subtil mais présent malheureusement. 

Il est carrément flagrant je dirais. C'est le racisme ordinaire fait avec pas mal de préjugés et de 日本持論. 

&gt; Il faut également ne pas espérer se retrouver accusé de crime parce que les procédures policières japonaises sont super louches et souvent condamnées par les organisations pour les droits de l'homme.

C'est louche car tu peux être mis en détention jusqu'à 20 jours sans que tu puisses faire quelque chose et que les policiers japonais sont adeptes de la confession.

&gt; Et je ponds des pavés au lieu de bosser, je suis pas fait pour le freelance :)

Bah c'est déjà 20h, temps de rentrer à la maison oui :p

&gt;Suicide rates are higher in rural India than in urban, likely because there is poorer access to care and a greater availability of pesticides, Dr. Patel said.
 But while the Indian media have focused considerable attention on suicide among farmers, the study found that agricultural workers were no more likely to commit suicide than rural people in other forms of employment.

Not entirely to blame, but the political structures around the Euro made it worse. If you have 27 different nations all with the same currency agreeing on how to fix a rescission is extremely difficult. The mess made the crisis worse.

&gt;Europe is also the only continent in the world that had four (five?) countries going bankrupt and a central bank moving money from richer countries into poorer ones to keep them afloat. With that in mind, comparing Europe to America or Asia is a mistake.

What? you seem to be changing the goal posts. The fact of the matter is that the statement ""The European Union has been a comparative economic failure"" is true. You can quite easily compare it to america and Asia, and there is no reason why you shouldn't.

Problem is Maastricht accurately foresaw that you can't have political unity without economical unity... yet we didn't go all the way in with the latter one. We got the Deutsche Mark, but we kept our national economical policies. From this point of view it's not surprising Germany has become the economical power of the EU, and I believe the answer is more Europe and more euro. In practice this is happening already: I don't think any southern European deludes herself thinking her country still has economical sovereignty. That's no longer the case, the ECB has been calling the shots for years and it's but a matter of time before they start doing it openly.

It is ranked 11th on the [2014 Engineering schools rankings of *Usine Nouvelle*](http://www.usinenouvelle.com/comparatif-des-ecoles-d-ingenieurs-2014).

However, being in one engineering school myself and knowing people from ENSAM, you must be aware that the traditions in this school are still VERY strong and, for instance, they require freshmen to grow a beard for a while and wear what I tend to think is weird clothes. They have their own specific slang and from the point of view of an outsider, it seems a bit sectarian. Not in a religious way though.

So, it is a great school but if I were to make a choice, I would choose another school. I don't know, I'm just saying this randomly, but you could choose a school part of the Mines-Telecom institute. And that's not because I'm in one of them! Nope.

Edit: I didn't know that the Gadzart traditions did not apply to foreign exchange students but you have to understand how odd and a bit sectarian all your traditions and especially your Argad'z language seem to outsiders. We have some sort of slang too in my school but it is very superficial.

Pure generalist Grande écoles on the top of the ranking have 1/3 business, 1/3 scientific culture, 1/3 scientific theory. A large part of the training is being part of student associations.

People who really want to do research and a PhD usually do a master in the university at the same time, to add real science stuff.

All students there are smart and the selection is ferocious. But the scientific content is not incredible when you have such good students.",0,1398691597,null,0,1398692397,0,ch43d7x,t3_246ju1,t1_ch43d7x,t3_246ju1,null,1433556504,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

First things first: the international rankings. As thatslexi explained and as you mentioned it in your post, the very nature of French Grandes Ecoles make them rather inadapted to current international rankings which are mainly American or Chinese (btw, the EU is currently working on its own ranking as we speak, wich should be better suited to French Grandes Ecoles and German TUs).

In addition to this, French schools are much, much smaller than what you can see abroad: for example Arts &amp; Métiers is one of the biggest in France but is only 6 000+ students, which is nothing compared to the gigantic universities you can find elsewhere. This is one of the reasons the government started to create ""clusters"" of Universities and Grandes Ecoles, such as ParisTech. That's rather stupid to say, but if French schools don't unite, they just cannot exist on the global scene, by the sheer force of numbers.

Now regarding Arts &amp; Métiers ParisTech. It is very well regarded in the industrial and technical landscape. It's been around since 1780 and trained several prominent French scientists and companies such as Pierre Béziers (father of CAD), Louis Delage, Jean-François Dehecq (founder of Sanofi-Aventis), Jean-Lou Chameau (President of the California Institute of Technology), [etc...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arts_et_M%C3%A9tiers_ParisTech_alumni) 

The fact that you mentioned you wanted particularly a technical University makes me think it would indeed be a sensible choice, as Arts &amp; Métiers ParisTech touts itself as ""L'école de l'excellence technologique"". To give you a better idea, I can ,ame a few companies which are ""strongholds"" of Arts &amp; Métiers alumnis: SNCF, PSA, Michelin, Total, EDF, Areva, Alstom, Bouygues...

Note the complete lack of red negative reports on the Greens, despite one of their MPs being caught buying sex from prostitutes around that time, and the amount of criticism and favoritism roughly corresponds with their party sympathies.

&gt;If the media is objective 

It's really not in our case. Even disregarding the general debate climate and blatant favoritism shown to representatives from the greens and reds, there's the free press organization ""Publicistklubben""'s debates where you have journalists arguing which debates should be ""allowed"" in the press and generally taking the attitude that it's the press who should be ""educating"" the people to the right opinion. Only really the rare person (generally our digging journalist Janne Josefsson) tends to take issue with that and thinks the core of journalism is to have the freedom to take up every debate.

&gt;personally I haven't seen any articles about chemtrails. 

Not sure if I made it clear but it's our Greens that have representatives who rant about chemtrails but somehow this is never brought into the media light. A similar situation was with Centre Party practically being crucified in the press with their local representatives openly rebelling when it came to light that their new party constitution included ""open borders"" (and polygamy among other things). 

Meanwhile the Greens have had open borders, pacifist ""defense force"" and similarly crazy shit in their party documents for a long time, yet there's not a peep about that in the media.

- Average winter temperatures in Southern Scandinavia are higher than continental winter temperatures, courtesy of the Gulf Stream. Summers don't get as warm, obviously, but remain pleasant, though unpredictable.

- Scandinavians don't eat traditional Scandinavian food. They eat the same globalized diet as the rest of you, but with some added traditional elements, such as rye, oats, and lots of fish. Recently, the ""New Nordic"" trend has caused nothing less than a gastronomic revolution, with the result that Copenhagen and Stockholm are now international destinations for gourmands. Highlights include Copenhagen restaurant Noma, which was ranked best restaurant in the world for three consecutive years — an absolutely crazy fact considering Denmark's very humble gastronomic past.

- Scandinavians, particularly Danes and Norwegians, are *far* more outgoing than other Northern Europeans, including Germans and Brits. Social awkwardness is not the norm, but if you're Southern, there's certainly a different set of codes, and you can't just assume that people will immediately understand whatever you're putting them through (cheek-kissing? instantly weird. don't ever do it here).",0,1398692671,null,0,false,0,ch43qec,t3_246eu3,t1_ch43qec,t1_ch43enz,null,1433556677,58,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,58

Having read the previous comments and your replies, here are my thoughts :

 - you don't speak French ? Learn it. Quickly! French people are notoriously bad english speakers...
 - The Grandes Ecoles often have lots of ""traditions"", ""slang""... You spend around half of your time in different ""clubs"" (sports, school newspaper, filmmaking club, organizing events...) and that's a big part of this whole ""experience"". I think I learned just as much in these clubs as I did while in class (not the same stuff though...). If you don't take part in all this, you're just wasting your time IMO (we see a lot of students from China for example - with a very different culture - who are just here to study...and they miss a lot of great stuff!)
 - There are different types of ""masters degree"" at most Grandes Ecoles. At my school (Ecole Centrale Paris), there is the ""normal"" engineering degree : 3 years after having spent 2 years in a ""classe prépa"" (other options are possible : 3 years of uni instead of the classe prépa...but classe prépa is over 80% of students). At my school, we also have the ""Masters Spécialisés"" which are done in 1 or 2 years and are for people who already have a masters degree but want to have some more specialized knowledge in one specific area.

If you want, you can contact me directly via PM. ~~Depending on where you live (time difference)~~ (EDIT : just realized you are obviously in Australia...), we could even skype if you have some more questions. I'm not at the Arts et Métiers, but I can tell you a lot about how the ""Grandes Ecoles""/university system works in France.

Also : I knew a guy from Australia who went to my school in an exchange program (was here for 2 years).

The maximum time in prison in Spain for non-members of ETA(our laws are like that) is 30 years for ETA members is 40(disputed in the Eurpean Court of Human Rights, and it's only for ETA members convicted after 2005). The  sentence reductions for work, reinsertion or whatever are calculated for all the total term for people convicted after 2008 and for the 30 years for convicted before that.

We had an hysterical period with crime those years even if the actual crime rate was one of the lowest in our history. And that was the *solution*. We have a very high incarceration rate.

We are also putting people in [prison for speeding or driving drunk](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.europapress.es%2Fsociedad%2Fnoticia-fiscal-pide-alternativas-carcel-reincidentes-delitos-trafico-20120924162349.html&amp;edit-text=).

Ich habe gerade mal in die Sortenversuche geschaut der Ertrag liegt bei rund 20dt/ha (12 - 31 dt/ha). Für 2012 weist das BMELV  gerade mal 4000 ha ""andere Hülsenfrüchte"" [[pdf]](http://berichte.bmelv-statistik.de/SJT-3072200-0000.pdf) bundesweit aus. D.h. unter der Annahme alle ""anderen Hülsenfrüchte"" wären Soja, stünden gerade mal 8000 t deutsches Soja zur Verfügung. Der Hauptanbaugrund gerade bei Biobetrieben liegt in erster Linie in der Futtergewinnung (steht also dem Markt nicht zur Verfügung). Der Vegetarierbund Deutschland spricht von 6,88 Millionen Vegetariern in Deutschland 2013 ([link](https://vebu.de/lifestyle/anzahl-der-vegetarierinnen)), demnach stünden jedem Vegetarier im Durchschnitt max. 1,16 kg Soja pro Jahr zur Verfügung. - Demzufolge wird sich die breite Masse derselben mit Importsoja behelfen müssen. -&gt; Somit geht die Idee durch Fleischverzicht auch auf GVO verzichten zu können so einfach nicht auf.

&gt;The EU is going through a significant reform of the banking system that the US has refused to go through and as a result the US will be a lot more vulnerable next time.

The EU is in process of forming a single regulator, something the US largely already has. The US has been much more aggressive in reforming its financial systems post-2008. The G20 (incl EU) agreed to reforms in 2009 with a 2012 target date. The new EU target is 2020. When the US implemented sections of Dodd-Frank a few months ago, part of Dodd-Frank that was passed several years ago, it was cautioned by the EU it was moving too fast. 

Financial regulation is what I am focusing my education on. [Dodd-Frank was passed several years ago](http://www.mofo.com/resources/regulatory-reform/). The EU made commitments to similar reforms, but as of now, they have only been commitments. 

The EU has been slow to implement regulatory changes both in banking and securities. Both are less restrictive in the EU than the US. That is why even moderately sized US banks do their international lending out of London. It is why [5 of the top 10 largest banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks) are in the EU, and only one in the US, coming in at number 7. 

The notion that the EU is reforming their financial (securities and banking) regulations faster than the US is false. The EU (and US) are making great strides to make sure their institutions meet the new Basel III requirements that are not finalized yet, but the EU is not reforming faster than the US.

No, eventually you have to pick one if you want to avoid Babylonic chaos. I mean, even the bible had a story about people f'ing up just because they were all too arrogant to chose one common language.

- English is closely related to European languages that are spoken by more than 80% of the EU, making it much easier to learn that any other language in the Union. Its half Roman and half Germanic. The perfect mix.

- English is already taught in all schools in Europe. We have the teachers and the materials to teach it. Most younger people speak it already to some degree. 
 
- English is the second most of the countries worldwide, speak it and you can travel and communicate anywhere (I know, because I did travel and live in some pretty remote places for the past 15 years).

Other than that we admire your social care system, Iceland is a beautiful country (used to be one of the top tourist locations for Poles) and we're always jealous of you in every statistic ;). Now immigration to Sweden and Norway seems to really improve the situation as people learn more about Scandinavian countries through their friends and families.

One of the tales that I remember is about [Bornholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bornholm) where supposedly noone had locks in the doors, and on a fields you could find buckets for money where you paid and then dig out vegetables from a field if you wanted... until Poles came in and started to *exploit* people there. \*eyerolls\*

Anyway - when I think of individual countries it's like that:

* Norway - Crude Oil, Tuna, Breivik 
* Sweden - Scandinavian imperialists, Fjords, Ikea
* Finland - Winter War, Lakes, Winter sports, freezing cold (blame your flag with so much white)
* Iceland - Geysers, Aurora, Crazy-complex names for pretty much everything (next time you erupt a volcano - rename it to something that can be pronounced, please)
* Denmark - High-tech stuff, least scandinavian of all scandinavian countries, Bornholm was very helpful during Communism, we still have no clue how did you manage to grab Greenland.

true,Seefor,DENK,Copenhagen,"From one of the leading researchers on welfare states, Gösta Esping-Andersen:

&gt; The Nordic countries represent a second, ‘social-democratic’, regime that is, above all, 
characterized by its emphasis on universal inclusion and its comprehensive definition of 
social entitlements. It is also one that has been vocally committed to equalize living 
conditions across the citizenry. For this reason, policy has deliberately sought to 
marginalize the role of private welfare markets and of targeted social assistance. The 
model is internationally unique also in its emphasis on ‘de-familializing’ welfare 
responsibilities, especially with regard to care for children and the elderly. Denmark and 
Sweden now boast de facto complete coverage both for child and elderly care. The 
upshot is, on one hand, a boost to female labor supply and, on the other hand, an 
unusually service-intensive welfare state.

&gt; ... Yet another hallmark of the Nordic model is its unique synchronization of social and 
labor market policies. While labor markets are fairly regulated, both in terms of hiring 
and firing (with the exception of Denmark) and in terms of wage setting, social policy 
has played a major role in promoting maximum employment. Female employment rates 
are now basically similar to men’s and increasingly on a full-time basis. This has 
potentially huge consequences for the income distribution. Female employment will 
promote more income equality the more it is embraced also in the bottom quintile households. Here is one clear example where social services and family policy have an 
essentially invisible, yet potentially decisive, effect on the distribution of income. 
Active labor market policies are a second crucial instrument for minimizing 
unemployment. By guaranteeing generous benefits to participants, the policy gives huge 
incentives to participate in training, retraining and job relocation programs.

If you look at EU securities laws, it is plain to see they are less restrictive. Disclosure that is mandatory in the US is often voluntary in the EU. Japan looked at allowing automatic cross-listings for EU and US securities. Any SEC approved listing can now automatically be cross-listed in Tokyo, whereas they declined to extend the same courtesy to EU listings because it is so easy to structure them to avoid disclosure. 

Much of the complaints by the US financial industry, relating to Dodd-Frank, is that institutions cant compete with their less regulated European counterparts. This is what led to the repeal of Glass-Steagall in the first place (and why the Volker rule keeps being postponed). There was never a separation of commercial and investment banks in Europe, which explains why they are so incredibly large today. France's two largest banks *each* have assets almost as large as France's entire GDP. If they had a major shock that caused many of their assets to lose value, who is going to have the financial power to recapitalize them?

[Poland is safer than Norway](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/safety/). When you factor the vast difference in social services this result is astonishing. If you're unemployed and poor here the best you can hope for about is $100/month social pension. That's hardly enough for food, with nothing left for other things, so it's easy to turn to crime. How much are you going to get in similar situation in Norway? :)  

Justice itself is also the goal. The sentence must include a element of punishment, especially for violent crimes, even if such punishment is counterproductive to reducing recidivism. The punishment of a criminal is a compensation for the victim. Lack of punishment means trampling the victim's rights. Which is what Norway is doing.

According to figures I can find, the financial sector in the UK brings in £61bn of tax per year. It's probably more now, since the figures are from 2009 and that wasn't exactly a prosperous year. 

So essentially, we paid out 2 years of tax earnings to bail out the banks. 

And we have huge stakes in some very big banks now, such as RBS. I think we own 85% of RBS now..

If we were having to bail out the banks every &lt;2 years, you might have a point. As it stands, it's an extremely rare occurrence and we're still very much quids in with the financial sector as is.

Sure we're doing well, and we are being portrayed as some super success stories but it isn't all a dance on roses.

But if I'd try to analyse it I'd say that:

I think what helps us is that we have since a long long long time ago had to rely on each other women and men alike. Before the convenience of modern technology you had to have someone to help you carry logs so you wouldn't freeze your ass of in the winter. Food was hard to come by and we had to rely on each other. One year I had a good year with my crops and you the next so we shared. Climate and a small population in a huge land area forced us to work together in a way that wasn't necessary in warmer climates.

This I believe created a society where everyone was willing to work together and give some of theirs to the benefit of others. This shows in our willingness to pay sometimes ridiculous taxes. This is also why we're very equal between genders as we just had to be equal.

The short summers meant that we had to be efficient, very efficient. We didn't have time to debate over issues and had to go with the most practical solution. If someone got offended for not getting to say their opinion, so be it, but mostly we just let everyone say their opinion and make a decision fast based on that. This shows in the way we have meetings still today. Everyone comes in, says what they have to say, we make a decision, in-out start cracking. If we made the wrong decision we just make a new one.

Basically our history from before the industrial revolution laid the foundations on where we are today and how we work as a society. So one could say that we today enjoy the fruits of our predecessors way of society.

We also never really had a very strong class society. Sure we had kings and nobles but even they relied much on the work of the rest of the society so once industrialisation became a fact the upper classes weren't as hesitant to share the riches, which if I have understood it correctly wasn't the case in many countries.

Anyway, there is no clear answer to why we have managed to do so well. I think that's why we keep on working on getting better all the time as we don't feel like we are doing so well. We feel small compared to other countries and maybe we have some little brother syndrome that pushes us to try to be best at everything. Which comes with a cost. Sometimes I wish that we could relax a little bit. Take time to enjoy a nice meal, not do everything by the book and just live a little.

true,OWKuusinen,FINL,"Terijoki, Finland","&gt;In my personal opinion we haven´t suffered from human greed in the extent that many other countries do by having a rich elite, and in developing countries fully corrupted people in power.

I think the generally held idea is that historical Sweden-Finland is above the magical line where the sun shines so weakly that we couldn't produce enough food for both farmers and an occupying army (the line goes roughly in the sea between Estonia and Finland). 

This means that any ruler must rule with the permission of his subjects, as he can't really force them to directly do anything (other than by threatening to gather an army and ship them to calm the situation, which was both time- and money-intensive). The few soldiers stationed in any given village were easy to overpower. Thus peasant revolutions were feared, which led to more fair legistlation and and the right for land-owning peasants to vote at the parliament (from which they were excluded in the southern states).

I don't think greed has anything to do with it -- we're as greedy as any people in the world. But because we have gained wealth evenly, we've seldom been in a situation where there was a clear line of have's and have-nots. The expectation would have been around 1890-1940 when the industrialisation suddenly started changing the situation, parliament not correcting it soon enough, which led to civil war and that in turn to a situation where the better-ofs saw the oppression of working class as justified. The wars united the folks, but these days the ""greed is good"" people are again starting to gain traction..  but perhaps we shall stay away from the modern politics.",0,1398706775,null,0,false,0,ch49zov,t3_246eu3,t1_ch49zov,t1_ch470s3,null,1433559694,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

There is a vise versa argument to that as well. The US provides a lot of capability in Europe. 

&gt;slap custom taxes on all US imports

This would be a good recipe for a depresion. As history tells us, these tariffs would be answered in kind. The US market accounts for roughly [€300 billion worth of exports](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/united-states/) from the EU. For each jurisdiction, the other is its largest foreign direct investment destination for its capital. A freeze on this would likely hurt both jurisdictions more than trade, because investments in both increase company growth/sales globally.

So your idea would work, but it would also likely cause a global depression.

L'ideologia politica è un insieme di presupposti teorici che sono alla base dell'agire politico di un partito o di un movimento specifici.

Il comunismo, inteso in senso generale (e quindi non come il tal comunismo o il tal altro) è un'insieme di idee economiche e sociali che poi si è declinato nelle varie interpretazioni che chi lo ha teorizzato ne ha fatto.
L'ideologia politica viene dopo, ma non è sempre uguale e a prescindere da chi la applica.

Il nazismo non ha un'elaborazione teorica, filosofica o sociale alle spalle. A meno di non definire la purezza della razza o il Mein Kampf come delle teorie politiche, ecco.

For example as to the number of guns: that goes to illustrate that having the means accessible doesn't necessarily lead to more death.

I've gone direct to data sources, rather than relying on other people's accounts of the data, and often been surprised by the extent to which that's uncommon. I've researched and written economic briefings which have been checked and used by those same experts. Possibly they were all too polite to criticise the work I've done, of course, although their passing it for publication suggests more than mere politeness.

And my conclusion, after all of that, is what I said - economics is marginally more useful as a predictive science than astrology. You're pretty much free to believe what you like about something like optimal currency areas, because its constraint by reality is extremely limited. The four main measures of an optimal currency area would be considered in any other science as not only qualitative but frankly subjective.

As such,  I no longer consider the economic theories espoused by individuals as anything much more than an indication of their political preferences.

RWB compiles and publishes an annual ranking of countries based upon the organization's assessment of their press freedom records. Small countries, such as Andorra, are excluded from this report.

The report is based on a questionnaire sent to partner organizations of Reporters Without Borders (14 freedom of expression groups in five continents) and its 130 correspondents around the world, as well as to journalists, researchers, jurists and human rights activists.[15]

The survey asks questions about direct attacks on journalists and the media as well as other indirect sources of pressure against the free press. RWB is careful to note that the index only deals with press freedom, and does not measure the quality of journalism. Due to the nature of the survey's methodology based on individual perceptions, there are often wide contrasts in a country's ranking from year to year.

* I came expecting Juncker vs. Schulz, ended up with Schulz vs. Verhofstadt. Was not disappointed. Schulz was great, Verhofstadt was awesome. You have to give it to them, their back and forth was the highlight of the debate. They were engaging, fun and had great points to share. More.

* Kudos to Ska Keller, I honestly expected her to be swallowed by the other three more experienced candidates, but she held her ground (yes, I agree, a bit naïve and 'flower-power' sometimes, but what do you expect) and even got her few moments to shine. Didn't bite as much as she could have when the questions went to dependency on foreign gas/oil, hopefully this will get corrected in the next debate.

* I found kind of refreshing hear Juncker refer to the EU as a soft power and explain the limitations of it. Also kind of supported gay rights! Yes, Keller and Verhofstadt quickly went out of their way to point the hypocresy of the People's Party on that subject, but I'm going to applaud Juncker for separating himself from his more conservative colleagues... that said he could've stayed at home and we wouldn't have lost much.

* It was a debate, so I shouldn't even get bothered by this but... oh, man, sometimes one of the candidates would suddenly go on a very interesting tirade and the moderators would just jump in and move on to the next candidate or the next topic.

On a more serious note Latvija and Eesti always felt more Nordic to me than Lithuania. I think that the defining characteristic is that both of the countries have a strong influence from German/Scandinavian cultures. For example Klaipėda, the third largest city in Lithuania, was a part of Prussia up to 1923, and the city feels much more Scandinavian and even western then the rest of the country. The ""spirit"" of the city is much more similar to both Riga and Tallinn.

true,mrcolonist,SWED,Sweden,"A dangerous question to ask a wordy man like myself!

I've been here for a year now, living with my girlfriend. So I have quite a lot of experience and would need an entire essay to even begin describing Slovenia.

But I find it a very interesting country, with people who are eager to help you if you ask for a hand. I've had difficulties getting closer to people though, but this is probably my own faults mostly. 

What worries me is the lack of confidence here. I see the same in Sweden, but at least in Sweden, we can remind ourselves of times, just years back, where our country has been stable economically. But here, I guess it's more difficult. Even nostalgic people are keen to agree that the socialistic Slovenia wasn't very good either (other than the fact that most people had jobs). Everyone seem to generally be apathetic to politics, due to all the scandals and betrayals during the years the country has been independent. 

Back to how people are: I would agree that Slovenes are nice. But also a bit wary at times. There's this culture of helping each other, being formally nice and so on, which I appreciate. It seems that Slovenia is also experiencing an identity-crisis at the moment. Young people here want to be innovative, often artistic. I've never been in such a small city as Ljubljana, with such a big alternative scene — mostly consisting of hipsters, but still, they seem to be wanting to push things forward.

Overall I'd be hesitant to talk negatively about Slovenes. Of course you have a large group of idiots, but all nations do. 

Other than that, I love the nature here, the cafés, the railroad (even though the trains are slow, but that just makes for more time to see things!), biking lanes in Ljubljana, and my daily walks in Roznik.

J'ai rapidement appris les concepts de dossiers et fichiers sur un FTP, surtout après avoir voulu rajouter un niveau à mon arborescence.

Ensuite j'ai installé plusieurs forums phpBB, version 2 puis 3 pour mes diverses activités en ligne (groupe de pote, guilde...) et j'ai attaqué le tutorial HTML &amp; CSS du site du Zéro ([toujours disponible et actualisé](http://fr.openclassrooms.com/informatique/cours/apprenez-a-creer-votre-site-web-avec-html5-et-css3) depuis, une référence selon moi) pour changer un peu le graphisme de mes créations. A coté de ça je touchais un tout peu l'infographie avec le logiciel de mon scanner.

Après ça j'ai fait un blog en [Dotclear](http://dotclear.org/), un CMS opensource français qui n'a pas a rougir devant le rouleau compresseur Wordpress. J'ai vraiment approfondi le HTML &amp; CSS, débuter le jQuery à ses débuts (version 1.2.6) et approcher l’algorithmie et la programmation avec la pseudo-syntaxe de dotclear (boucler une action sur des éléments dans un code facilité, à l'instar du BBcode pour la formatation de texte).

Étudiant hors informatique, j'ai continué mon blog et j'ai développé le site de la simili-junior entreprise de ma promotion pendant 2 ans, ou j'ai plus appris sur la gestion de contenu et la formation des autres utilisateurs que sur les points précédents.

J'avais à chaque période digéré une partie du [tutorial mysql/PHP](http://fr.openclassrooms.com/informatique/cours/concevez-votre-site-web-avec-php-et-mysql) donc la transition vers la programmation pure a été facile.

Sachant que j'ai commencé en 2011 à m'acheter des costards...

Mes deux premiers ont été payés par mes parents, à 300 et 100€ respectivement. Pareil pour mes deux premières paires de chaussures, à 600€ chacune, où mon père (grand amateur de souliers* devant l'Eternel) à un jour regardé les richelieus que je mettais et m'a dit ""... Non, sérieux, tu peux pas. Je t'emmène à Raspail te rechausser"". Une paire de Weston et une de Crockett &amp; Jones, géniales.

A partir de là, c'est mon salaire qui paie. Pour les costumes:

Deux costards taillés sur mesure à 300 et 400€, un prêt à porter en soldes à 280€, un que j'ai eu à New York (les prix américains sont imbattables) à 175$, deux autres à 300€ en prêt à porter, et un supplémentaire que j'ai acheté à 300 de plus il y a deux semaines et qui est encore à la retouche...

Ca en fait neuf, sachant que j'en ai craqué deux et que quand un costard craque, c'est difficilement réparable (je fais réparer ce que je peux, mais quand je peux pas, je remplace). Sans compter le soutien de mes parents, on en est à presque 2000€ tout rond.

Quant aux chaussures - Je n'en ai jamais racheté à 600€ comme mon père qui claque des mille et des cents dans ses souliers, mais j'en achète plus que mes costumes. 150€ d'un côté, 200 par-ci... Je les commande pas mal aux US pour profiter du taux de change, aussi. A vue de nez... 1800€ et quelques.

J'ai très peu de dépenses fonctionnelles, donc je peux me le permettre... et honnêtement, si je m'arrête en ce moment, c'est par manque de rangement chez moi :(

Thing is, even if we know that we're doing well in some areas most nordic people don't think they do. We always feel like second best and nothing is ever good enough. Seriously sometimes I'm amazed how negative we are about our countries. I do this myself. This is why I move abroad every now and then and when I move back I can appreciate things. But after a while you're back to square one.

So northerners that haven't lived abroad very much will never think that they are best.

Matematica invece è una materia infinita (pure troppo..mi rendo conto di quanto sia insignificante la mia preparazione rispetto al mondo), bella, quella che ti apre veramente la mente e con argomenti che ti appassioni. C'è la bellezza delle dimostrazioni, dei punti cardine della scienza e i pilastri su cui si basa, della scoperta e anche dei tentativi falliti e poi riusciti. Per me la matematica è la materia più affascinante, semplice e difficile allo stesso tempo. Impieghi ore, giorni, mesi a capire un concetto, lo svisceri e lo fai tuo e poi ti chiedi perché ci hai messo così tanto, provando allo stesso tempo un orgasmo mentale. 

La mia aspirazione massima sarebbe lavorare nel campo della crittologia, ma tengo i piedi per terra. Con le mie capacità molto probabilmente potrei diventare insegnante, e la cosa non mi dispiace, mi sono mantenuto gli studi dando ripetizioni private e trovo che il mestiere del maestro, per quanto denigrato, sia bello ed essenziale specie per una materia tanto importante. Avrei le mie idee in termini di didattica e vorrei compararle con il metodo finlandese (credo ad oggi riconosciuto come uno dei migliori) e soprattutto metterle in pratica.

So I would say it's good if you go over some stuff that you have already done because this will allow you to know what all those frenchies are talking about ;)

**Coming back to your uni/school choice.**

If you want to do something a bit more technical, I would say Arts et Métiers is an excellent choice. I think it's the only school in the top-10 (maybe top-12 but who cares !?) that really stayed true to its ""engineering school"" roots and has more technical classes.

If becoming an ""ingénieur généraliste"" is something you would like, aim for any school in the top-10. ""Ingénieur généraliste"", as they described it in my school when I arrived there, means that you will most probably manage a team of technical engineers. You obviously learn lots of technical stuff, but you don't become an expert in one specific area. You have to know a bit of everything to be able to understand an expert when he talks to you about something technical ;) I find it interesting ! Management, finance, negociation, accounting (we even had a class called ""philosophy of science"")... and also some scientific stuff : thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, biology, quantum physics, statistics...

You have to keep in mind that - to my knowledge - the Grandes Ecoles are schools that you get into after 2 years of classe prépa. This means that you don't even have a Bachelors degree (or equivalent) when you get into these schools. I don't know if you can just skip the first year, even if you have already done 4 years.

Have a look at the INSA schools. These are engineering schools that are basically integrated into Universities (and not Grandes Ecoles). They are still very good (INSA Lyon is always in the TOP 10) and might be closer to what you are looking for (more technical, and probably easier to get into the ""right year"" without to much difficulties)

Comprendre la logique des fichiers, leurs interactions entre elles et les navigateurs, le balisage, la logique pour formater les éléments. (Pour l'anecdote, ma formation passerelle comptait faire tout cela en 4h...). Faire un simple site statique avec des frameworks tout fait ([HTML5 boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), des templates [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)...) permet de faire la main. C'est important de le faire sur un serveur en ligne pour apprendre à gérer des fichiers dans différents environnements, et les bases d'utilisation d'un hebergement (il faut au moins y consacrer 1 mois).
* 3 mois pour apprendre [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) et [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) . jQuery est le framework le plus utilisé pour l'ajout d'interactivité en front-end (l'interface qu'utilise les internautes), la encore [tuto gratuit disponible](http://fr.openclassrooms.com/informatique/cours/simplifiez-vos-developpements-javascript-avec-jquery). node.js permet de mettre en place un serveur web complet très efficace, et même un système de base de données ([tuto gratuit](http://fr.openclassrooms.com/informatique/cours/des-applications-ultra-rapides-avec-node-js)). La technologie est encore très jeune, mais recèle un potentiel (et une hype) important. Ces 2 ""langages"" n'en sont pas en soi, il s'agit dans les 2 cas de framework qui utilise le Javascript, qui est un peu le couteau suisse du Web.

J'insiste bien sur le fait qu'il s'agit ici d'être capable de développer une application web de quasie-moyenne envergure, ou une belle démo technologique. Je recommande d'ingurgiter des tutoriaux annexes (ex : [l'AJAX](http://fr.openclassrooms.com/informatique/cours/ajax-et-l-echange-de-donnees-en-javascript), la Programmation Orientée Objet en javascript via [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) ou [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)) pour avoir au moins les notions de quoi on parle. Personne ne reprochera à un débutant d'être imparfait dans sa syntaxe, son approche dans le code ou d'autres aspects du développement web. Et d'avoir la passion d'apprendre toujours plus à chaque projet, ça aide dans les entretiens d'embauche.

Oh, ffs. This is laughable.  
Women should be free to make the decisions they want to. If that includes selling their body, then so be it. It's their body.  
There is no violence there. At all. Maybe necessity, but any prostitute could also work in retail or flip burgers. They just choose the path that'll make them significantly more money.  

Prostitution should be fully legal. That way, if a prostitute is actually forced to work, she could ask a client for help. If visiting prostitutes is illegal (or visiting a prostitute forced into it without knowledge of this is), that just discourages the clients to help in such a case.

C'est absolument lamentable. Pourquoi ne jure t-on que par des alliances Franco-Allemandes? Comment peut-on un seul instant supposer que le rachat par Siemens sera un succès? Comment peut-on refourguer une entreprise de la taille d'Alstom à une entreprise qui ne s'était même pas positionnée en premier lieu pour un rachat mais vient à ""considérer"" un rachat parce que le gouvernement les a supplié de pas se faire racheter par les Big Mac.

M. Montebourg, il existe des alliances Franco-Américaines qui ont plutôt bien tourné et fait bon ménage. Je pense notamment à CFM International qui n'est autre qu'un conglomérat entre Snecma, groupe Safran, fleuron de l'industrie aéronautique française, motoriste reconnu et notre mouton noir du jour, General Electric.

Alors je sais que ce n'est pas tout à fait pareil, CFM est davantage une collaboration qu'un rachat du premier par le second mais il est question ici de montrer que ce n'est pas très diplomatique de passer à côté d'une telle offre de GE *juste* parce que ce sont des vilains Américains.

Oui, mais c'est quoi une hyperbole ? Pour quelqu'un qui exalte la France, tu fais bien peu de cas de son esprit tout à fait littéraire. Mais tu te prends au sérieux sur un forum internet. Donc toutes choses mises en perspective, je ne sais pas qui est le plus ridicule. 

&gt;Quel parti ne le fait pas ?

Les partis centraux ne le font pas tout le temps. C'est dur de discuter avec quelqu'un qui ne comprend pas le sens d'une phrase complète. Les mots ne sont pas accessoires. 

&gt;Tu connais des études dans lesquelles les autres partis sont associés ?

Oui. Il n'y a bien que le FN qui reprend des études réalisées par des personnes en désaccord avec ses idées. 

&gt;Tes critiques du FN n'en font absolument pas un parti marginal, elles sont tout autant valables pour les autres partis.

Oui, mais la marginalité du FN réside dans sa propension à tout reprendre à son nom et au nom d'un racisme viscéral. Encore appelé populisme bas du front.

&gt;Le FN est central, c'est le troisième parti de France à la fois en nombre de voix, en présence médiatique, et il le débat d'idées tourne autour du FN. Il suffit qu'il propose quelque chose pour que les autres partis se positionnent autour.

Ta dernière phrase est clairement fausse, peut-être que je ne vais pas sur des sites/émissions/radios suffisamment obscurs mais le FN n'est jamais amené que pour faire de la contradiction. Tes propos doivent faire parti de la section réécriture historique prévoyant entre autres la louange de l'Algérie Française et les Allemands nous ont bien traités pendant la guerre. 

&gt;Hahaha, quand ce n'est pas cet utilisateur qui te répond tu es à peu près capable de débattre.

Non, je n'ai aucun mal à débattre avec toi. J'ai simplement eu envie de dire autre chose, de faire autre chose que de me battre pied à pied sur chaque mot comme ici. Par contre, ce fil m'énerve car il est une contradiction à l'état pur. 

&gt;J'ai été en effet agréablement surpris de ce fil. Heureusement, les personnes formulant des critiques ont un niveau extrêmement faible, à savoir toi, /u/canteloupy[1]  et /u/hereandnotthere[2]  .

Ta pensée se résument à le yakafokon est un nationalisme, je regrette que ces personnes perdent du temps à te parler. 

&gt;Avec des adversaires comme vous pas besoin de soutiens.

Cela tombe bien alors. 

&gt;Le lien était dans une phrase, la phrase dans un paragraphe. Je te suggère de relire car si la seule chose que tu retiens c'est ""sur la répartition des richesses"", tu as visiblement manqué l'essentiel.

Je te renvoie l'appareil. En quoi ta phrase et ton paragraphe ont un lien de cause à effet sur ce que recherchent les politiques ? Je n'en vois aucun. Pour quelqu'un qui a fait des maths, tes enchaînements logiques laissent à désir. Tu expliques qu'il y a ""des riches"", que ces ""riches"" ont un intérêt à un chômage haut ( pourquoi ? car ils sont riches ), et ensuite tu en conclues que personne ne recherche de solution au chômage. Je crains que tu aies un train de retard ou même trois ( voire que tu regrettes encore le dernier en partance pour Dachau ). 

&gt;En attendant, j'attends toujours ta démonstration de ""toute la planète se demande comment faire"".

Tu ne comprends toujours pas le concept de non démonstrativité des effets rhétoriques. Ie, la persuasion par l'absurde. C'est pourtant pas mal utilisé par Marine. Tu devrais lui demander. 

&gt;Non, c'est vrai car ça a été démontré.

Non, c'est vrai car une vidéo youtube et un rapport hypothétique ( qui comme tous les rapports de prévision sur les systèmes complexes se plante lamentablement car la théorie est lacunaire, cf rapport du GIEC ), je n'appelle pas ça une démonstration mais une preuve ontologique. 

&gt;Oulala 100 pages !!! Trop dur j'abandonne. Et l'autre lien n'est pas une vidéo, c'est un dossier de 6 articles et 2 vidéos. Tu veux aller dans le détail ? Tu veux une analyse sérieuse et en profondeur ? Elles sont la en lien. Si tu as des critiques, tu es libre de les formuler.

J'ai regardé en diagonale le rapport, il n'a rien de long, c'est juste un rapport politique. Rien que l'exergue est une blague, qui situe la France parmi les pays de l'Euro sud, un espèce de cheat qui n'a aucun rapport avec la réalité des taux d'intérêt de la dette française ou le positionnement scientifique et industriel de la France. Enfin, notions d'économie sont un peu rouillées, mais je pourrais continuer sur quasiment chaque page. Dommage pour toi et tes ""certitudes"".

&gt;En fait si, il suffit de les lire. Quels points te paraissent faux ?

Comme dit plus haut, si personne ne cherche à les réfuter c'est uniquement une question de temps. Réfuter un rapport de 100 pages prend entre 50 et 200 pages en fonction du degré de mauvaise foi. 

&gt;Hahaha. Tu prépares un one-man-show ? En tout cas félicitations pour cette analyse politique, tu as trouvé ça tout seul ? Il me semble qu'ils cherchent un chroniqueur politique à PQ magazine, tu devrais postuler.

Cela faisait référence à la récupération et l'almagame de tout et n'importe quoi par le FN. Si vous en êtes à faire les fonds de tiroir de la maison de retraite du PS.. En passant, voilà un exemple de rapport lié à un parti. Celui du Che. 

&gt;Ah oui, celui où tu disais qu'il y a eu 17 dévaluations depuis 50 ans alors qu'il n'y en a eu que 5. Je me suis arrêté là. C'était aussi une ""hyperbole"" ?

Ce n'est pas ce que j'ai dit, mais tu ne sais pas lire. 

&gt;Non. Qui a dit ça ? C'est une hyperbole ?

Les politiques qui les font. 

&gt;Jamais dit que le SME rendait nécessaire les dévaluation. Relis.

C'est toi qui es parti sur ce terrain du SME. 

&gt;Relis les commentaires des autres utilisateurs. Mes commentaires sont intéressants et stimulent les autres.

Et Dark Vador est le personnage principal de Star Wars. Qui a dit qu'un bon méchant n'était pas ""divertissant"". Car c'est tout ce que tu es, toi et tes éléments de langage, tu crois que mon sentiment serait différent si tu étais un militant PS ou UMP ou FdG, mais tu te trompes. 

&gt;Tu avais dit que tu voulais partir de France, je prends des nouvelles.

Oui, mais comme dit Marine, la France n'est plus la France mais l'Europe. Je suis en Europe. 

&gt;Ah oui, ce serait tellement bien si tout le monde était comme toi.

Ce serait certainement plus dur de faire 20% des voix.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I don't think Turkey will ever join Europe but not for the reasons listed here before.

I don't think the Turkish people are culturally incompatible with other European people.  I think an average Turk is culturally very similar to an average Romanian, Bulgar or Greek.  If any of those peoples are European enough, then Turks are also ""European"" enough.  **Culture most certainly is not an issue IMO.**

Islam might be considered incompatible with Christianity but I'll say that Atheism is even *more* incompatible with Christianity.  If Europe is able to accept Atheists into the fold, it can accept Muslims too.  I also think many European friends only see the fringe elements as ""Muslim"" whereas, for example, an uncovered modern, Turkish women living in Germany is not seen as Muslim (nor Turkish for that matter, she is a good assimilated German).  I'd say those from the fringe are incompatible with Humanity not just Europe and most average Muslim's are harmless.  **Islam not an issue IMO but feel free to disagree.**

The Turkish public has a long history of being ruled by a strong state and do not know what it means to be free and democratic.  These are not incompatible with the culture, mind you, it is just the average Turk doesn't know (is ignorant) what a government of a democratic country can or cannot do.  Liberal leaning people will complain about the recent AKP ban of Twitter (which was overruled by the courts BTW) while completely agreeing of a youtube ban that occurred a couple of years ago to ""protect Ataturk"".  **Turkish understanding of freedom and democracy is an issue, but this can be fixed**

Turkey has been founded on shaky foundation in a challenging geopolitical location.  Our governments have not been the best to begin with and given the challenging environment: our laws are outdated and we have plenty of history to face.  **Cyprus certainly must be made whole before Turkey can join.  I have hope that this can be fixed.**  **A ton of work needed before we are legally compatible with the rest of Europe, fixable** 

Turkey is a country with a large population and joining Europe would shift the balance of power.  I think the current powers that be do not want this.  Even if Turkey did everything that was needed of it (and more) the governments of Europe mainly France and Germany would point to perceived deficiencies to prevent Turkey from joining Europe.  The governments of Europe can easily leverage public Turkophobia and Islamophobia to do this.  **Never going to happen, the large countries of Europe will never give up their relative power over the rest**

The Turkish people saw Europe as their way to salvation since the founding of the Republic.  The idea of ""Europe"" was equal to better living standards and modernization.  Now Turks see Asian nations like Japan, Korea and China and no longer see joining Europe as a requirement to a more prosperous life.  When Europe says ""we're not going to let you join!"", many of us are just shrugging and moving on.  **Turks are moving away from Europe, we're no longer interested**

Pour te répondre :

* LAMP (Linux-Apache-Mysql-PHP) principalement, et un peu de node.js.
* Dans l'ordre : phpBB, Dotclear, Drupal, Magento, Prestashop et Express pour node.js. Mon préféré reste Drupal car il permet vraiment de tout faire, que ce soit avec le nombre impressionnant de modules gratuit par la communauté ou bien par mes propres compétences une fois le framework maitrisé. La question du ""est-ce que je peux le faire ?""  disparait au profit du ""est-ce que c'est le meilleur outil/moyen de le faire ?"" ce qui est très plaisant.
* Node.js a la simplicité du javascript (et ses pièges), et l'efficacité du temps réel. Il est utilisable en front-end pour des interfaces réactives (*client-side templating* comme Mustache, AJAX), en back-office avec les frameworks MVC, coté serveur avec Express et/ou Backbone en combo, et même pour du stockage/utilisation de données.

Right now they conquered already eastern ukraine.

Only homicide statistic could be also in practice somewhat safely compared between *similar* countries (socially, economically, ...), as being a very distinct kind of a crime, it has a fairly universal definition and almost 100% reporting to police. But there are again so many awfully complicating factors, like do we log a killing done in police duty as a homicide or what happens in situations like now in eastern Ukraine. This is also before we get to other differences in keeping the statistics. 

All in all, crime statistics are only of limited use and not to be taken as absolute facts. They are basically only useful in tracking trends in crime rates in individual countries, and even then extreme diligence should be followed (as by time, things do not remain the same (there's no *ceteris paribus*), e.g. policing faces changes with coming and going ""zero tolerance"" policies and technological advantages, etc.).

Life was very different across the pond in eastern Europe the '90s, mate. :D Both of my parents have graduated from higher education institutions (my father actually has 2 degrees - construction engineering and law). Even so, we were living on what would be today 70 euros per month, which were my mother's salary. They simply could not find work. Fortunately, we at least had a house that my father inherited from his grandmother and we didn't have to worry about rent. Trouble is, we couldn't afford heating in the winter, so we lived in just 1 room with blankets on the door frame so that the cold would not get in. Nowadays, my family is doing much better. My father found a decent job around '97 as an engineer. He started from there and in 2003, he was able to start his own small construction company in our home town. 

All in all, in a lot of ways, it was very beneficial for me to see both sides of society. :D

Le FN ne le fait pas tout le temps. Par exemple, quand il propose le développement du transport fluvial tiens.

&gt;Oui.

Lesquelles ?

&gt;Il n'y a bien que le FN qui reprend des études réalisées par des personnes en désaccord avec ses idées

Hahaha. Très drôle. Par exemple le rapport Jospin repris par Sarkozy.

&gt;la marginalité du FN réside dans sa propension à tout reprendre à son nom et au nom d'un racisme viscéral.

Contradiction à quoi ?

&gt;En quoi ta phrase et ton paragraphe ont un lien de cause à effet sur ce que recherchent les politiques ? Je n'en vois aucun.

&gt;Tu expliques qu'il y a ""des riches"", que ces ""riches"" ont un intérêt à un chômage haut

Pression à la baisse sur les salaires. Il fallait lire le paragraphe en entier.

&gt;J'ai regardé en diagonale le rapport, 

Sans déconner.

&gt;il n'a rien de long, c'est juste un rapport politique.

Ce sont des scenarii économiques, rien à voir avec un quelconque parti politique.

Sinon il y a les analyses de prix nobel d'économie qui sont probablement aussi des rapports politiques. De manière générale tout ce qui te déplaît va être un rapport politique.

&gt;Rien que l'exergue est une blague, qui situe la France parmi les pays de l'Euro sud, un espèce de cheat qui n'a aucun rapport avec la réalité des taux d'intérêt de la dette française

Les exportations de la France sont sensibles aux taux de change, ce qui en fait un pays plus proche des pays du sud que des autres pays de la zone. Ça n'a rien à voir avec les taux d'intérêts de la dette mais avec la structure des échanges extérieurs.

Tiens on va rigoler : en quoi ?

Mais ne te gêne surtout pas.

Il va voter pour DLR aux prochaines européennes. DLR est proche du PS ?

C'est un métier qui demande une certaine passion selon les milieux dans lequel on le pratique. Vouloir faire du 9h/17h avec ma recette est illusoire. Quand au marchés de l'emploi, je pense que Paris est déjà rempli de bons développeurs (d’où ton terme de ""prostitution"") mais on doit pouvoir faire son trou tranquille pour des petits clients au fin fond de [région perdue de votre choix]. Certains auto-entrepreneurs jouent la carte du multi-service au professionnel et la proximité, et je pense qu'ils compensent assez le coté intéressant des projets par des sonnants et trébuchants.

C'est dommage que tu lâches la bombe que j'attendais alors que je clos cette première session, mais explique moi vraiment ton Tl;dr : **Chef de projet et développeur sont pour moi 2 métiers complètement à part**, nécessitant des notions communes pour se comprendre, mais des compétences très différentes (programmation VS management). Un bon dev' ne fait pas un bon CdP, un bon CdP n'est pas forcément un bon codeur.

J'étendrais même la problématique à la tendance *devops*, qui a pour but de faire en sorte que **toutes les équipes** (commerciales, techniques et management) soient impliquées dans un projet informatique **dans toutes les étapes du processus**.

'Devo max' would be most of Scotland's preferred choice in the referendum, but I think further devolution would just postpone the inevitable, while in the EU. When the EU finally takes over things like our defence and foreign affairs, Westminster would become an unnecessary link (or middleman) between the federalised countries in the UK and the federal EU. 

Personally, I'm in favour of the UK becoming more federalised (like you said), but I think the UK's relationship with Europe should be purely economic (possibly [EFTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Free_Trade_Association)), while the continent can fully steam ahead with a 'United States of Europe.' I think that's the closest thing we can get to ""best of both worlds"" and I think the EU and the UK would both be happier for it, as our governments clearly want two different directions for Europe.

 If we played our cards right, we could also build an economic relationship between the countries in the Commonwealth (a market of $13 trillion, growing by 7% a year) and our country would be in an even more desirable position for trade than we are now, with economic access to what could potentially be two superpowers.

Even if Putin or his advisors do subscribe to Dugin's Eurasianism, which is very arguable (given their past repression of movements he's taken part in), I wouldn't expect it to follow his academic view of geopolitical goals beyond the ideological fight against liberal ""Atlanticism"" as he calls it. Dugin spends most of his writing throwing around ideas of what must be done rather than pinning down absolute solutions.

That's funny because anyone trying to defend russian actions or the EU/US/Nato inaction for whatever reason systematically, as a first argument, defect the topic on Crimea's defection and blatantly ignore that Crimea became just the bridge head to the entire country right now.

More seriously, we're talking about eastern ukraine there, or really their planned invasion of the entire country when they realize the US are busy hiding and paralysing Nato and handing them to their military EU aligned territories and they can keep sending tanks till they conquered anything east of poland and Romania.

Crimea is gone, but eastern ukraine is just standing by while russian troops are kidnapping, murdering, looting and burning buildings carefree like the WWII era red army. 

And the US/EU has decided that they'd rather sacrifice the entire ukraine to stall Russia because it's easier for them to just give up 42 000 000 ukrainians to russian invasion then half a century of martial law and deportations and more random murders/looting/kidnapping/bombing/...; than to risk loosing 5 pilots and 10 grunts in a local skirmish to push them back.

In fact, the Wahl-o-Mat will never be able to really tell you that on its own. The values you got rather indicate that you have an eclectic mix of opinions on the issues that no party particularly shares or particularly disagrees with. The reason for the values you got is your own political perspective, not so much the parties’ perspectives. (However, because of your own eclectic political perspective that isn’t really fully represented by any particular party it might well be that to you all parties seem the same.)

The issues the Wahl-o-Mat displays are selected based on several criteria (how interesting, how relevant, …), one important criteria, however, is that they are supposed to allow to easily distinguish between parties. Statistical methods are used to select those statements that best distinguish between the parties. The list of statements parties get sent to answer is much longer, but when all parties answer the same there is not much of a point in asking Wahl-o-Mat participants on their stance on the issue.

Consequently the Wahl-o-Mat will always only displays the most controversial issues, the ones the parties disagree on most.

As such it is not fit to determine how far apart parties are.

(Just to be clear, this is an explanation why you can’t really use the result of the Wahl-o-Mat to determine how far apart parties are ideologically.

En SSII, le poste de chef de projet est une **évolution** du poste du lead développeur.
En agence de pub ""digitale"", on a un chef de projet fonctionnel (davantage conseil) **et** un chef de projet technique (qui est soit un ancien développeur, soit l'équivalent du chef de projet web décrit ci-dessous).
En agence Web, le chef de projet web/digital a souvent une bonne formation technique, se doit de connaitre l'évolution du ""digital"" mais n'a pas besoin de savoir *vraiment* coder.
Et chez Google, la grande majorité des managers sont des développeurs.

Et je ne parle mêmes pas de la définition du chef de projet chez l'annonceur, que moi-même je n'ai pas encore compris.
Ni du rôle du Scrum master et/ou du product owner.

Again, I repeat, ***not*** the USSR, ***COMMUNISM***.

I feel the emphasis again, not the ***USSR***, ***COMMUNISM***, because it appears you are unable to tell the difference.

&gt;The problem with people like you is that you automatically assume that your form of thought is flawless and that everybody who doesn't think like you is a ""problem"".

No, the only ""problems"" are greedy capitalists(Though I suppose calling a Capitalist ""greedy"" is just superfluous) who's sole goal in life is to exploit every other human being on the planet. 

Do you think the work place should be democratically managed between the people working in at every level, with all the profits shared evenly in according to contribution?

If yes, congratulations, you admire a Communist.

&gt;The problem with people like you is that you obviously don't know enough about the things you talk about

If I knew nothing I'd probably still know more than you about this.

&gt;because it was communism that dictated how the USSR would treat its occupied countries. 

Cite to me the book, publication, page number - preferably a direct quote - of any of the works by Marx or Engels that dictate that neighbouring countries must be subjugated and dominated as buffer states between the glorious revolution and the capitalists.

I'll save you some time; There isn't one. You probably wont find one from Lenin or Trotsky either.

The policies which you so ignorantly claim are Communist were ones developed by the USSR - a statist, Imperialist, dictatorship. You may be able to get away with claiming it's Stalinist and therefore Communism, but try and be an open Stalinist today and you'll be derided among the Radical Left in almost all political discourse.

&gt;You haven't lived in a post-soviet country have you?

I don't need to live in a post-USSR country to know how to read and be educated.

It's not that I think you're an idiot, I just think you're supremely ignorant of the ideology and your educational system and popular culture have just reinforced this ignorance as opposed to making you question what you think.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"In Australia, of all the issues that have been caused by O&amp;G drilling and extraction using fracking technology, and there have been issues, none are related specifically to the use of fracking, and are rather endemic problems in oil and gas exploration. Stuff like casing fractures (basically cracks in the cement 'tunnel' they create to extract resources) are problems that happen across all fields of O&amp;G drilling. We don't have some of the disasters they had in America, because Australia has some very good regulation. We tend to have some top notch, and appropriate, regulation in general but Australia has been a massive adopter of fracking for CSG wells with no environmental impact caused specifically by fracking, and as a consequence were set to be one of the largest, if not the largest, LNG exporter in the world in the next few years. 

There has been a massive campaign against fracking by environmentalist groups, but it has all been on the same intellectual and technical level as a Michael Moore 'documentary'. That is, blatantly manipulative, distorting facts, and presenting very one-sided and biased viewpoints. Take 'gasland' for example. Since that was released, a huge number of holes were found in the story that have been documented in many places online.

But sooner or later they have to accept that nuclear power has its value as a transitionary power source in their eventual aims of more developed renewable energy or even something to keep an eye on in the long term as technology enables nuclear energy to be both safer and more effective using new methods.

We saw in Germany how a careless policy against nuclear energy plays out. After Fukishima the Germans recoiled against nuclear energy and nuclear plants were retired immediately. The problem was that renewable energy didn't keep up with the sudden shift and, suddenly, Germany was more reliant on the very energy source Greens are opposed to the core against: coal.

Specifically, I'm critical of many of the things happening there that simply delay and perpetuate problems that project themselves around the world.

I am equally critical of the same shit happening in Canada or Australia, but the reality is that radical solutions to problems there don't have any impact on the rest of the world in a direct sense. A lot of countries rely, and follow the US. It's pretty dangerous to have such an important state destroying itself from the inside.

e: How are any of the things you listed ""an upswing""? The ACA is a tragedy, it's simply a consolation prize for those goddamn pinko commies who want actual change (this would be a single-payer system, for example, rather than increasing the influence of fucking insurance companies). Gay marriage and weed is simply a reaction to right wing movement. It's cultural progression. I don't know much about the FDA tobacco regulation so I can't really comment on it but just looking at it, it sounds like another reaction to things that should be already there.

This is all cool, and of course it's cool that it's happening, but then we get to the part where instead of using these things as objects for political campaigns, we actually keep installing actual fucking necessary progression, rather than sitting on fucking hands because reactionary conservatives in the GOP who want to install the fucking Bible as a book of the state, for example, want to undo this so their corporate buddies can get those last few quick bucks before they die, their son gets it all and the same behaviour resumes itself.

true,atlasing,ANAR,le flag waver face,"Well a common mistake among non-expert analysis (perhaps capitalist bias influences this as well) is the understanding of each nominally ""socialist"" or ""communist"" country. Cuba, for example, is the only state I can think that is a decent example of socialism at work. Although it faces much difficulty for simply being socialist, it has made great progress and the people there are living a better life than they would under capitalism in my opinion. I have some issues with the specifics of how it is ruled, but in a basic sense it's the best example of actual socialism.

All of the countries that had socialist revolutions, were not very industrial. Many of them had only recently emerged from subsistence life for much of the population. This is not an ideal situation for socialism at all. 

Capitalism is a great way to develop a country, in terms of industrial output. Unfortunately the costs of its high production output are placed upon the workers, almost entirely. Most people endure relative misery in comparison to the ""ownership class"". These are the men that own the factories, don't do much work but profit off of the fruits of the workers they employ (and exploit, often for their own good or good of a few).

Socialism is a progression from capitalism. The idea is that once states are near full development (basically the West), we should move toward communism (stateless, classless.) Socialists hold that the best way to achieve communism is through a socialist transitional period. In this period, the workers assume control of the means of production (and distribution, government - directly or indirectly) and democracy is extended further than the election of governments. This is called *workplace democracy*. There are no bosses. There is no abuse. There is no absolute need to get x done so CEO Jack can afford his wage boost.

Everything is decided democratically, so that the good of the people is fulfilled, rather than having this semi-dictatorship wherein most of the wealth is concentrated and locked in the hands of a tiny minority. Democracy can't work entirely properly in a place like the current US, and doesn't. Sure, you can vote, etc. You can't actually do anything to stop the control of your country by corporations, businessmen, the political class and install actual democracy, where there is not 2 parties who essentially work for the same group of people (this group is, incidentally, not the people whose votes they campaign for.)

In short, it would work in the US because you have an already-developed society and high quality of living to begin with. Unfortunately in past ""socialist"" states much hardship has been endured by the people there, simply to get where the US is now. Let's not forget that capitalism essentially enslaved billions to develop society. That's also where a lot of criticism of past socialist states is misguided, along with a general misunderstanding of what socialism *actually is* (DAE nordic socialism is a good example of this. Social democracy is still capitalism, but with more bandaids and semi-temporary fixes to make it more liveable.)

It's frightening how much you've lost touch with reality. A generalization like that is on an otherworldly level.

&gt;Cite to me the book, publication, page number - preferably a direct quote - of any of the works by Marx or Engels that dictate that neighbouring countries must be subjugated and dominated as buffer states between the glorious revolution and the capitalists.

Tell me how the capitalist economic model requires any of that.

&gt;The policies which you so ignorantly claim are Communist were ones developed by the USSR - a statist, Imperialist, dictatorship. You may be able to get away with claiming it's Stalinist and therefore Communism, but try and be an open Stalinist today and you'll be derided among the Radical Left in almost all political discourse.

How do you think the USSR got to where it was? I understand what communism is, and I like it in theory, but the world isn't clay that we can mold into an idea that someone forms. Communism was always a gateway into a dictatorship. The reins are put in place, all someone has to do is take them and hope the horse doesn't buck too much.

&gt;I don't need to live in a post-USSR country to know how to read and be educated.

Point proven. I haven't lived in the Gaza strip, so I won't take a fucking side.

If you think people are too selfish and power hungry to live well in a capitalist society, how do you think they would do when a control system is put into place, and the only thing keeping the system running is good will and honesty?

Now you're complaining because someone has given you a source and expects you to read it if you want to check their validity. Many of the points I have made repeatedly about farming, agriculture, language, writing and the like can be verified by that book. If you're not going to take the time to read it, then you have nothing more to say, because you can't ask the person making an assertion to fact check it for you if you doubt their sincerity. That's what references are for: they allow you to fact check yourself. 

This has stopped being about any factual issue and is now instead about your persecution complex about how ""no-one will help me understand and they just called me names, but it doesn't matter because I've been right all along anyway"".
