Soyons clair, ce genre de ""débat"" ne convaincra personne. Nos amis les créationistes ont abandonné les faits et la raison depuis longtemps, et deux heures avec une personnalité télé ne vont pas changer ça.  

Le débat a eu lieu parce qu'un créationiste a réussi à convaincre une personnalité télé de venir. J'espère qu'il a été bien payé.  
Pour Ken Ham, c'est une grande occasion de promouvoir son idéologie, et le simple fait que quelqu'un de crédible accepte de lui parler lui donne par transitivité un petit peu de crédibilité.

Pour la plupart des créationistes, même s'ils pourraient être convaincu par les arguments de Bill Nye, ils ont beaucoup trop a perdre. Leurs églises, leurs amis et leurs cultures sont solidement connectés a cette idéologie, et ils n'ont donc aucun intérêt a considérer un changement de position.

As an aside, Ken Ham took great care to make sure people know the the debate took place in the ""Creation Museum"", a bizarro exhibit created by Ken Ham itself, which repeatedly presents fictions as facts.

Assume the EU had visa restrictions on the Philippines prior to this. 

The EU is in a unique position because it is expanding its borders while most countries are not. I think there would be pushback from EU countries if roles were reversed though. 

Also, Ireland and the UK use their own rules for admitting tourists. Their visa-free lists of countries differ from the EU list. There isnt a uniform visa program with respect to other countries for EU entry, yet they seem to expect everyone else to have a uniform policy towards them.

Almost every restaurant has a menu posted somewhere on its outside. I would learn some French words for food though, if you don't know any French already. The cafe culture was one of my favorite things about Paris anyway, so embrace it while you are there :) I miss the food so, so much!!

There are plenty of little stores selling sweets like macaroons and eclaires so make sure you treat yourself to some while you're there. And I'm sure you will indulge yourself in some crepes, those are also available everywhere in Paris. Personally I like savory ones, but nutella seems to be very popular :) I don't have any advice for where to go specifically - I was there long enough that I kind of just remember running into them in a lot of different parts of Paris. Naturally, everything is more expensive the more touristy the area is.

As far as shopping goes, I had a lot of luck in le Marais. There are a lot of boutiques there, just be prepared to spend some money. It's not as extravagantly expensive as places like Galerie Lafeyette though.

tl;dr: the cafe culture is more important than any specific store name and the food is delicious in them. macaroons, eclaires, and crepes are some great things to try, but their pastries in general have a lot to offer. shopping centers like galarie lafeyette are very, very upscale an expensive, but boutiques you find on the street are more affordable and still trendy. le marais is a noted area for apparel shopping.

That ex-Soviet states didn't implement the suggestions word by word is a myth; there wasn't more ardent use of shock therapy than by Yeltsin's administration in Russia where the recommendations were followed to the letter, yet the results was disastrous in every way. That people try to distance themselves from the very policies they once advocated is not merely disingenuous, but criminal.

Indeed when one takes the success of economic transition of central European states, one finds that it was gradualism, rather than shock therapy that secured stable growth in the coming years. The only aspect of shock therapy that was of use was that of restructuring the economy more in line with that of their Western neighbours' to better take advantage of their markets; reforms that were direly needed and as soon as possible. But it was otherwise a gradual transition: for example denationalisation was only applied gradually and indeed despite the positive outlook that Poland faced in the 90s, it was seen as a lost opportunity that there was inadequate investment in infrastructure due to the budget cuts imposed by such shock therapy, which in the end held the economy back from attaining further potential economic growth.

That is why a bigger autonomous region would be the best solution, as I said I'd even give them to Hungary, despite that being politically impossible.

No, stop arguing the natural resources card, we easterners should know better than that, you can literally have money grow on trees if the political climate is filled with short minded corrupt assholes, it is worthless, and the state of the corruption in that area is ridiculous. 

Nothing is a hassle for our politicians cause they don+t give a fuck, except for reelection they just do their own thing and let the rest of us live. The attitude towards the subject of autonomy is poisoned. Because RMDSZ used a lot of anti romanian rhetoric trough all these years. So at the basic level above all else its just a ego thing, don't let RMDSZ win, despite the fact that objectively they would hate the most to lose. But as I previously stated, I think your aproach of Hungarians must rule Hungarians no matter what, is the same ego trip just with different colors, your putting a principle in front of what is objectively better for the people, especial now , since there are no borders between Budapest and Miercurea-ciuc.

For my experience on the school system I have a few things to say beforehand:
First, I'm male, so that saves (and gives) me some trouble.
Second, I'm from an academic background (my mother is a teacher herself).
Third, I've always been on the high ground of the system.

For the teachers part I have to say that they are afaik standard. You'll have some assholes (choose a kind of asshole for yourself) and you'll have some nice ones. The important change on behalf of becoming a teacher was a deep change on how the role of a teacher is seen.
Influenced by the '68 movement and anti-authoritanism, schools and teacher-training have become refocused.
Instead of focusing solely at the grades of one, many teachers will actually care for you as a person (or are at least advised to do so). A big problem are the old teachers. They've never been told anything even slightly related to such crude terms as ""pedagogics"". They'll just run the old-style hard regime. Even between young &amp; old teachers, this is a huge problem. (source: my mother is a young teacher and she's had quite a number of arguents because of that)

That said, the system that decides which ""branch"" of education you're send into is very simple and very unfair: Your teacher decides. That's it. In some cases even good grades won't bring you a ""Gymnasialempfehlung"" which basically states you're ready for the highest branch. All this is only based on your teachers opinion of you. You got a teacher that doesn't like you? poor you.

Finally for the ones that screw up, I have an anecdote for you:

In grade 9 I had a friend that was really lazy in terms of school. Like, really lazy. But he was smart, after all. But because of his lazyness he had to downgrade a branch. In there he was underengaged by his teachers and dropped down even further, from Gymnasium with me to Hauptschule which he barely finished.

&gt;First, I'm male, so that saves (and gives) me some trouble.

How so?

&gt; Instead of focusing solely at the grades of one, many teachers will actually care for you as a person (or are at least advised to do so). A big problem are the old teachers. They've never been told anything even slightly related to such crude terms as ""pedagogics"". They'll just run the old-style hard regime. Even between young &amp; old teachers, this is a huge problem. (source: my mother is a young teacher and she's had quite a number of arguents because of that)

So teachers actually get involved with you, and care about your well-being, try to help you, etc?  Is that what you're getting at?  Sounds pretty cool actually.  I had distant, apathetic and at times very rude and demented teachers.  

&gt;In grade 9 I had a friend that was really lazy in terms of school. Like, really lazy. But he was smart, after all. But because of his lazyness he had to downgrade a branch. In there he was underengaged by his teachers and dropped down even further, from Gymnasium with me to Hauptschule which he barely finished. Now he's a cook and makes money while I'm busy studying useless sociology ;)

Well wait a minute, from my understanding so far isn't the ""Hauptschule"" a path to failure, as some said on my previous thread?  At least they made it out to be such schools leaves you screwed.  

I'm studying environmental engineering, which I have no idea if it will give me a job at this point.  I'd actually trade it in for a decent job at this time, since I'm totally broke due to school :P

I have to say the teacher deciding is very unfair, and I guess, with my bad behavior, shitty math and apathy toward school, I would have not have been given as good a chance to enter university as I have been given here (which mind you, it was damn hard work to get my prereqs necessary).

By the way, I don't find sociology useless at all ;).  I find it to be one of the most useful studies in society.  That's my opinion anyway.",0,1391661027,null,0,1391661695,0,cf8ab1z,t3_1x3klv,t1_cf8ab1z,t1_cf88pse,null,1432275482,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

true,whatthe_f,LGBT,LGBT,"Historisch war es im Kapitalismus ja schon von Anfang an so, dass Frauen in einem Abhängigkeitsverhältnis zum Mann standen. Es gab eine feste Rollenverteilung in Bezug auf Produktions- und Reproduktionsarbeit.
Die Produktionsarbeit, also bezahlte Erwerbs-/Lohnarbeit wurde vom Mann ausgeführt und die unbezahlte Reproduktionsarbeit von der Frau. Diese hatte den Erhalt der Arbeitskraft zur Aufgabe, also Hausarbeit, Pflege, Kochen, Kindererziehung usw. Da diese Art von Arbeit nicht bezahlt wird, waren die Frauen immer ökonomisch vom Mann abhängig.

Mit kleinen Einschränkungen ist das heutzutage immer noch anwendbar. Der Großteil der Hausarbeit wird immer noch von Frauen durchgeführt und meist sind die Männer immer noch Hauptverdiener.
 
Ich würde sagen viele Institutionen wirken geschlechtsspezifisch auf den Lebenslauf. Nur ein Beispiel:

Der Arbeitsmarkt: Berufe, die als typisch weiblich gelten werden schlechter bezahlt als typisch männliche Berufe. Sie sind mit schlechten Aufstiegschancen verbunden. Außerdem müssen die Ausbildungen meist aus eigener Tasche bezahlt werden. Das sind hauptsächlich Pflege- und Erziehungsberufe. Also was früher noch im Haushalt unbezahlt stattfand wurde im modernen Kapitalismus einfach institutionalisiert.
 
Als männlich geltende Berufe auf der anderen Seite werden besser bezahlt. Hier ist der Arbeitsmarkt auch bereit in Karrieren zu investieren. Ausbildungen erfolgen im dualen Ausbildungssystem und werden bezahlt. 
 

Ist natürlich ein komplexes Feld, welches sich nicht in einem Kommentarfeld abhandeln lässt. Wollte nur kurz was dazu schreiben.

Certo, il M5S non è il nuovo fascismo (non so neppure se qualcuno l'ha mai detta questa frase), ma è indubbio che abbia alcuni elementi che lo ricordano o, quanto meno, che invitano alla cautela.

Riportando quanto scritto da un commentatore sul sito del Fatto:
&gt; Prevenire è meglio che curare. La storia dovrebbe averci insegnato che le degenerazioni peggiori dei movimenti politici diventati dittatoriali si sarebbero potute evitare se fermate sul nascere o alle prime avvisaglie di scelte sbagliate e pericolose. Quando ci si accorge di avere imboccato una strada sbagliata bisognerebbe avere la saggezza di tornare indietro prima che sia troppo tardi e che si sia andati troppo avanti per poterlo fare senza danni. Il M5S non è fascismo nè eversione, ma sembra essersi messo in anticamera adottando metodi e comportamenti che somigliano tanto a quelli adottati a suo tempo da movimenti che pur nascendo spesso con buone intenzioni di ""rivoluzioni culturali"" e motivate proteste contro un potere, poi degenerarono e costruirono essi stessi nuove tirannie.
Mi sembra che Scanzi e altri giornalisti del FQ, col loro altalenante giustificazionismo e appoggio, stiano avendo nei confronti di Grillo e del M5S lo stesso atteggiamento che Marinetti, i futuristi, e D'Annunzio ebbero nei confronti di Mussolini e del nascente fascismo.

true,armyn1,BRAN,Brandenburg,"Das klassische Bürgertum, als erste dominierende Gruppe in der aufkommenden Industrialisierung war weiß, männlich, christlich, heterosexuell und natürlich besitzend. Diese Eigenschaften prägten lange solche Gesellschaften und es ist kein Zufall, dass im ausgehenden 20. Jahrhundert genau diese Eigenschaften in Frage gestellt wurden. Zum Beispiel die Schwarze Bürgerrechtsbewegung in den USA gegen die weiße Vorherrschaft, Feminismus gegen männliche Eliten und Benachteiligung von Frauen, religiöse Minderheiten wie z.B. jüdische Emanzipation gegen die christliche Dominanz, Schwulenbewegung gegen Heteronormativität und die Arbeiterbewegung gegen die politische Herrschaft der Besitzenden. Scheinbar hat sich der Kapitalismus damit selbst reformiert durch den demokratischen Druck. Allerdings gab dies nur den Menschen die Möglichkeit aufzusteigen, die oben genannten Eigenschaften sind dennoch noch wirksam. 

Am Beispiel der Weiblichkeit lässt sich dies gut verdeutlichen. Es gibt verschiedene Ansätze warum dies so war/ist. In Bezug auf das Patriarchat lässt sich in Industriegesellschaften feststellen, dass auch wenn Frauen weitestgehend gleichgestellt sind, dass kategoriale ""Frau sein"" als Eigenschaft, kaum etwas von seiner  Zweitrangigkeit verloren hat. Weiblich als Eigenschaft ist noch immer Emotional, Schwächer, Kommunikativer und in Hinblick auf die Gesellschaft als Fürsorgend konnotiert. Anatomische Frauen, die in einer patriarchalen Gesellschaft in Kontakt mit Geld oder Macht kommen, werden in Verbindung mit männlichen Eigenschaften gebracht bzw. wird erwartet ihre Weiblichkeit zurück zustellen. (Merkels Ausschnitt schien vielen Leuten erst bewusst gemacht zu haben, dass dort sonst ein paar Brüste unter den biederen Hosenanzügen stecken) Frauen sind auch stets durch Öffentlichkeitsdruck in Bezug auf ihr Äußeres ausgesetzt, was bei Männern sehr selten der Fall ist. 
Allerdings sollte man nicht zu dem Fehlschluss kommen, dass Männer hier Frauen direkt unterdrücken. Es wirken in unseren postmodernen Zeiten verschiedene Kategorien, denen es sich unterzuordnen gilt. Ein schwarzer Präsident hat einen weißen Habitus, ein schwuler Bürgermeister oder Außenminister zeigen ganz selbstverständlich normatives Verhalten oder Politiker mit ausländischen Wurzeln geben sich national assimiliert. Eine Kanzlerin darf nicht ""emotional"" reagieren usw usw. Ich kann hier das Thema nur anreißen, aber wer es wagt, sich gedanklich weiter zu trauen als ""Scheiß Emanzen"", kommt schnell dahinter, dass unsere gesellschaftlichen Strukturen noch immer Eigenschaften wie patriarchalisch o.ä. besitzen.",0,1391672147,null,0,false,0,cf8dwg2,t3_1x3r1w,t1_cf8dwg2,t1_cf81wo3,null,1432277240,4,false,de,t5_22i0,4

The nice thing is that travel can be cheap because Milan is a hub for many different airlines. Book early enough and you can get round trips for 30 -60 euros to most places. Hostels are a nice alternative when travelling as well and will only cost around 15-30 euros per night.

&gt; les théories de l’évolution qui, en fonction des philosophies qui les inspirent, considèrent l’esprit comme émergeant des forces de la matière vivante ou comme un simple épiphénomène de cette matière, sont incompatibles avec la vérité de l’homme. Elles sont d’ailleurs incapables de fonder la dignité de la personne.

Donc pour l'église, y a eu au moins une intervention divine: la création de l'âme (je pense que c'est ce qu'il entend par ""esprit""). Il y a également ce passage:

&gt; Le Magistère de l’Église est directement intéressé par la question de l’évolution, car celle-ci touche la conception de l’homme, dont la Révélation nous apprend qu’il a été créé à l’image et à la ressemblance de Dieu (cf. Gn 1, 28-29). La Constitution conciliaire Gaudium et spes a magnifiquement exposé cette doctrine, qui est un des axes de la pensée chrétienne.

&gt; Elle a rappelé que l’homme est "" la seule créature sur terre que Dieu a voulue pour elle-même ""(n. 24).

Donc Dieu a guidé l'évolution vers son but unique: l'Homme, créé à son image. L'évolution a l'humain pour dessein, dessein qui a été déterminé par Dieu. J'ai du mal à voir comment on peut dire que ce n'est pas du dessein intelligent, à moins que les successeurs de JP II ne soient revenus là dessus...

Le seul argument bien de tout le débat : les théories scientifiques servent à prédire, pas seulement expliquer le passé.

Les créationistes sérieux ont des explications crédible pour à peu près tout, par contre ces explications ne permettent pas de prédire grand chose. Les scientifiques très religieux peuvent se pencher sur les livres des créationistes sérieux et trouver des choses cohérentes pour expliquer qui ne choquent pas particulièrement leur rigueur. Mais dans leur domaine d'activité professionelle, ils utilisent les théories prédictives non-religieuses (car les théories créationistes ne sont pas prédictives).

Le truc drôle c'est que les créationistes de base sont aussi ignorants que les évolutionistes de base (les deux répètent ce qu'ils ont appris à l'école/lycée et n'ont jamais vraiment regardé ce que les autres ont dit).

J'ai l'honêteté intellectuelle d'admettre que je suis nul en géologie et que lire un article qui parle des sédiments ne permet pas de me convaincre. J'y crois car j'ai confiance dans le journal qui le publie.

Le problème qu'il y a comme toujours c'est l'incompréhention entre les deux camps. Qui a le terrain moral ? Les militants des deux camps pensent l'avoir. Quand on a des milliards, on peut toujours fabriquer des preuves de suffisament bonne qualité.

C'est un problème fondamental, car c'est le même principe pour le changement climatique, les OGM, les ondes des téléphones, etc. 99% des militants ne maitrisent pas du tout les théories scientifiques associées et répètent ce que dit l'autorité morale de leur idéologie. Et comme dans le cas de ces problèmes comme du créationisme, on est face à des phénomènes complexes et chaotiques où il existe des points mal compris ou encore débattus.

La seule chose qui fait vraiment chuter le créationisme est l'enseignement supérieur, lorsque l'on creuse vraiment un domaine assez profondément pour voir tout ce qu'il y a de bidon dans les arguments des autorités religieuses. Certains vivent avec la contradiction et abandonnent juste la religion dans leur domaine, la plupart mettent toute la Bible à la poubelle (certains continuent d'être théistes ou déistes). Sinon il faut assécher financièrement le camp qui dit de la merde.

Quelle vaste blague.

Il naît 105 garçons pour 100 filles et à chaque âge les garçons meurent plus que les filles.
Sur les 105 garçons qui naissent, à 55 ans, il en restera 87 maximum (les autres sont morts et les immigrés venus entre temps augmentent le chiffre) dont 16 auront un diplôme du supérieur. Ces 16 là, ils domineront, même si en face il y aura 22 femmes diplômées du supérieur.

Par contre, parmi les 71 qui restent, tu en auras 13 sans aucun diplôme et 30 avec un BEP/CAP qui ne dominent absolument pas. Pour comparer, à 55 ans, sur 100 femmes, il en restera 92 dont 9 sans diplômes et 19 avec des études courtes pour qui la vie sera dure, mais moins que pour les hommes du même niveau d'études.
Et d'ailleurs, la majorité des prématurés, mal-formés, enfants en échec scolaire, analphabètes, clodos, drogués, alcooliques, suicidés, prisonniers, morts au travail, sont des hommes.

C'est un hasard tout ça en fait ? Il faut arrêter de se focaliser sur les élites. D'une part, il n'y a pas de domination masculine généralisée. Si ça te fait plaisir on peut parler d'une masculinisation de la domination : ce qui est dominant est ressenti comme masculin.

Quelle différence si c'est un patron ou une patronne qui m'exploite ? Quelle différence si c'est un député ou une députée qui me ment aux élections ?

Anyway, you're right, it is in America's interest, but it's also in Europe's interest, and if Germany see's a strong &amp; integrated Europe as beneficial, than it's in Germany's interest as well. 

Europe called for both Libya, yet America, even though it was reluctant at first to even get involved, had to carry out most the first-strikes against Libyan AA defenses, and then had to, once again reluctantly, take a leadership role given it's logistical and intelligence capabilities, both niches which Europe as a whole lack in significantly when it comes to power projection. 

Mali is another prominent example, and while France was able to handle that mostly independently, they still had to come and ask us for help, once again in the areas of logistical and intelligence assistance. 

Germany bitches about American influence, you're bitching about American influence, but the continued reliance on the American military to subsidize the European Union's hard power is only increasing American influence on the continent. 

You might ask, but WAIT, this seems like a GREAT DEAL for America? Well, it would be, if we weren't trying to move 60% of our Air Force and Navy *(the Ying &amp; Yang of Power Projection)* into a different region with Obama's *""Pivot to the Pacific/Asia""*. But every time we have to go assist Europe, like with Libya and Mali, it detracts and distracts from that. 

I really don't see a downside from a geopolitical stand-point. The European Union increases integration and reduces American influence, and my country could focus more on and divert more resources too the Asia/Pacific region. 

Germany, given it's probably the only top-tier military power on the European Union besides that of France and the United Kingdom, is the most important and influential actor in deciding which way it's going to go though.

Anyway, America was forced to take the leadership role and carry out the first-strikes against Libya's AA defenses *(as well as contribute to combat missions through-out)*, not to mention the massive amount of logistical and intelligence support we had to give. 

America didn't call for Libya, European nations did. European nations *within* the European Union I might add. Why should America have to be the one to provide such heavy assistance to a primarily European-motivated and European-compromised endeavor? France and the United Kingdom are already basically carrying the entire responsibility of the European Union's hard power *(or, to put it more accurately, power projection)* on their shoulders, yet even they are having complications without American support. 

Germany is more than capable of picking up the slack and assisting their fellow Union members. They are a economic great power, one of the largest arms exporters in the world and one of, if not *the* most influential member in the European Union. They could be, and should be, assisting where America is assisting now. 

Mali is another prime example, and while American support wasn't needed to the degree it was in Libya, it was still needed, specifically, as mentioned above, in the areas of logistics and intelligence.

We like to think that we are always spontaneous and emotional, but actually there are monstruos amounts of ways in which you can piss off an italian. Some stuff we call ""basic respect"", and are in fact social conventions.

Some things are expected by friends and families, and not performing them makes you a person who is not really concerned by other peoples' needs. In other countries, they would call it self-preservation.

Friends and families can be quite invasive at times. 

Especially in the South, you are always expected to sit down with the family for lunch and dinner at set times. To move the times of the meals (say, the rest of the family eats at 13, and you will eat later at 14), is not considered very nice, unless it's for work. Once or twice, or during holidays is ok, but in the long run, it might mean that you do not love your family, and people are seriously convinced that it will break family ties.

If you come to a house for dinner, you never come empty handed. It is a general rule everywhere, but abroad I noticed that if you break it just once, nobody cares. In Italy, they will never forget.

If people come and visit from outside, you host them in your house, unless it's in ruins. If you make them pay for a hotel, even if you only have a sofa, it's bad.

At weddings, it is expected that everything will be paid for. Drinks included. Nobody pays for their drinks at a wedding. If you make people pay, you will be forever remembered as a stingy one. In Ireland I noticed that, for example, you will have to pay for the drinks after dinner. Which makes sense in Ireland, a LOT.

You WILL fight with your guest if you go out to eat at a restaurant, because you HAVE to offer to pay the whole of it. This is only in case you are an adult with a stable job, but still.

The respect formula of ""lei"" (like the french ""vous""). In my are, you use it for any person older than you until they ask you not to use it, and sometimes they don't even mean it, so you have to continue to use it.

There are other rules like these, and I believe that many of them can change according to the region in which you live in Italy.

true,Err_Eek,TRAN,Romanian living in Ireland,"Well, I live in Ireland and the best buddy I've got here is from Bristol. So I'd actually say that in as much as two European cultures can be different, we are.

Here's just a few things:

- Touchy-feeliness: Romanians are _way_ more touchy feely than the Brits and Irish, even northeners such as myself. While someone explains something to you, expect to be touched frequently on the shoulders, maybe even your knee if you're sitting

- It is way more ok to talk about sex with a girl you just met in Romania, and generally to open yourself about how your sex life is going with friends. During my first month in Ireland I went to a house party, the conversation started moving towards films, and I made this joke about the movie Shame ""Michael Fassbender won't make you feel self conscious about having a small penis, he'll make you feel self-conscious about not having a third leg"". I thought it was pretty funny, but everyone else just pokerfaced instantly.

- Kissing. When I told my English buddy that when kissing I also like to kiss girls on the cheek and forehead he got truly creeped out. Told me that's totally verboten and uncool, something you'd only do very seldom with your wife after years of marriage. 

- My English buddy: The answer to ""how are you?"" should always be ""fine"".

- Talking on the train with strangers, while with the arrival of ipods and smartphones became less and less common, is still perfectly acceptable and happens quite often, it's generally not seen as something one would rather avoid.

- Shaking hands: not something you do daily around here in Ireland, unless you're introduced to new people daily. Many a Romanian did not realize they were being awkward for weeks, while shaking the hand of everyone every time they showed up for work in the morning 

- Swear words: the Romanians are the bigger prudes here. While I come from a rather foul mouthed family, there are plenty of people (especially girls) that will avoid even minor swear words at any costs, and all TV programmes in Romania bowdlerize maniacally the translations of various foreign shows. There's even a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnUxQU9j9DA) about how absurd this practice gets.

- Sex: modern girls in urban environments in Romania will be ok with sex on the first date. But there still seems to be a general cultural stigma attached to female sexuality, the word ""curvă"" (whore) being used way too often and way too freely.

The list could go on and on, two and a half years worth of office talk and small moments of awkwardness. But hey, _in varietate concordia_ :)",0,1391679864,null,0,false,0,cf8fb3b,t3_1x3qj6,t1_cf8fb3b,t1_cf8evla,null,1432277904,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

But that's an American problem however, not a European one. For me, personally, I'd like to see Germany participate more in European operations, or operations called for by European powers, to off-set and replace my own country's participation in those interventions, so as I mentioned in my other post, we can focus on re-aligned ourselves to the Pacific/Asia region. 

But the thing is, if you see American influence as a external challenge, don't you want to reduce it? Is a more integrated, stable European Union not in Germany's interests? 

The fact of the matter is, the more that Germany ignores upping it's military spending and participation, the harder it becomes for the E.U. to integrate militarily, and the more European countries will turn to the United States for power projection support, thus increasing our influence on the continent...and distracting us from more important regions *(in a realpolitik sense)* such as Asia. 

And I think the Iraq War was a stupid fucking war. And the politicians handled it in a stupid fucking way. I might disagree with the invasion, but I disagree a lot fucking more with how we went about shit during the Occupation. But you shouldn't lump it in with all the other operations or interventions, it's disingenuous and takes away from some very real and practical points that exist as to why Germany military participation is necessary in the long-term scheme of the Europe, and the fate of the European Union itself as a entity for the world to take seriously. 

And case in point, unlike Iraq, both Mali &amp; Libya were authorized with U.N. Security Council Resolutions, and unlike Iraq, they weren't called for by my country, but by European countries, yet German participation *(in a significant degree)* was still, noticeably, lacking.

With Obama's new *""Pivot to the Pacific/Asia""*, we're moving up to 60% of both our Air Force and Navy into the region, the two most critical elements for power projection. This is a move away from our old Cold War-based Europe strategy. However, each time Europe instigates or calls for a intervention, like Mali or Libya, where U.S. support is necessary, it distracts from the pivot and diverts critical resources from it. 

Hence why the United States has asked Europe to beef up their military spending and capabilities. I also believe this is why America has tossed out the idea of cutting U.S. military funding in Europe by 1/5th and why we initially threatened to charge France for our transport/refueling planes in Mali. An while we neither charged the French, nor have yet to drastically cut our Europe budget, I think the proposal of each was went as a signal for Europe to get it's militaries and power projection capabilities together. 

So yes, Europe's military reliance on us does buy us great influence, but at the same time, I don't think the Administration sees that influence as worth-it in the long-run, especially with a rising China and the Asia/Pacific region becoming the new vocal point of our global strategy.

China's recent antics in India/Japan are just testing the waters to see how the US responds.

* Speaking of the 90's, we got a taste of what happens when nationalism goes wild [in 1990, in Târgu Mureş](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_clashes_of_T%C3%A2rgu_Mure%C8%99). As such, both the majority and the minority agreed that dialogue is the proffered way to go.

* As such, all ""conflict"" between majority and minority was dealt with through dialogue and political negotiations. The [Hungarian minority party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDMR) has been a junior member of government, de facto or de jure, from 1996 to 2012. Also each minority has one MP by default, so this ads another 18 (iirc) MPs to parliament to voice concern if needed. Also, the Greater Romania Party was effectively [cordon sanitaire'd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordon_sanitaire) by the other parties.

* We have had a positive relationship with Hungary, so that eased a lot of pressure off the issue.

* We have an [anti-discrimination agency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_for_Combating_Discrimination) that shoots down any instance of discrimination

 [**Bystander effect**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander%20effect): 

---

&gt;The **bystander effect** is a [social psychological](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology_(psychology\)) phenomenon that refers to cases in which individuals do not offer any means of help to a victim when other people are present. The probability of help is inversely related to the number of bystanders. In other words, the greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that any one of them will help. Several variables help to explain why the bystander effect occurs. These variables include: ambiguity, cohesiveness and diffusion of responsibility.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I completely agree, and this is exactly why I believe Europe's reliance on the U.S. Military has become more of a liability to us than a benefit. Yes, it gives us huge amounts of influence on the continent, but at the same time, it's distracting from probably the most important region on the globe at this moment *(and probably for the next century)*, Asia/Pacific. Hell, this point is solidified by the fact that *even Russia* has begun it's own *""Pivot to the Pacific/Asia""*, an area which it has neglected *(to a degree)* since Soviet times. 

The days of American Hegemony are coming to and end, and soon the unipolar world will be replaced with a multipolar world, a single super power will be replaced with multiple Great Powers, of which I believe will be the United States, Russia, China and the European Union *(with India &amp; Brazil coming up from behind)*.

America is trying to ensure it's on a good footing when that happens, so it can't afford to stretch itself thin in such a scenario, and it can't afford, in my opinion, a militarily-weak European Union which is still reliant on us for power projection. But you're right, it isn't a luxury, it's a necessity, which makes it all that much more significant in my opinion. 

**EDIT:** I remember reading a quote somewhere that really stuck with me, as it had to do with this very discussion and the ever-evolving multi-polar world around us: 

*""America doesn't fear the European Union, it fears being the only West left.""* 

And I think that, at least in my personal opinion, is what best describes America's long-term fear in a ever-changing world, especially with the coming end of American Hegemony and the rise of regional Great Powers, especially in the context of the *""Asian Century""* as many have called it.

On va peut être bientôt faire un débat sur ""Au final est ce que le feu ça brûle ou pas ?"" ?

Le problème vient du fait que ces gens ne comprennent pas qu'en termes scientifiques le mot ""théorie"" n'a absolument pas le même sens que celui qu'on utilise qui est ""Fait non prouvé mais qu'on pense que c'est peut être ça"".

Pour citer wikipédia : *""En philosophie des sciences, une théorie scientifique doit répondre à plusieurs critères, comme la correspondance entre les principes théoriques et les phénomènes observés. Une théorie doit également permettre de réaliser des prédictions sur ce qui va être observé. Enfin, la théorie doit résister à l'expérience et être compatible avec les nouveaux faits qui peuvent s'ajouter au cours du temps. Si ce n'est pas le cas, la théorie doit être corrigée ou invalidée.*

*Ainsi, c'est dans la durée que se juge la force d'une théorie car elle doit pouvoir rester compatible avec les nouveaux faits, résister aux expérimentations qui voudraient en démontrer son invalidité, et assurer la justesse de ses prédictions.""*

Problems and misconceptions about wind power:
A Turbine needs actually power itself to start (remember: no 100% possible)
Yes some think it´s ugly: http://politics.hungrypeasant.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/not-my-backyard.jpg
It actually produces sounds - and again Germany is a very dense-populated area.
Where there´s wind - there´s no industry (wind=ocean shore) - so you NEED the grid transportating the energy.
Off-shore farms are interesting and are planned...but they are expensive, and in Germany again an example how free markets fail (in this case even the little ""socialism"" failed):

There´s an off-shore farm in GER which will be finished in approx. 1-2years and there will be a big fat cable coming to the shore which will end in a little distribution station...but the grid to/from that station will be build by a company called tennet (ex-monopolists grid that had to be formed into a new company) will be finished in approx. 5 years...classic.

Pesonally I think of a turbine as something reassuring me of the right way into the future. But I guess even more people have a problem with the newly build grid, then with a turbine.

And there´s is something very wonderful which might be exclusive in Germany: We absolutely HATE nuclear power (me included) - so whenever there´s a discussion about our energy future, there is no other way and no more popular way then coming to near 100% renewable.

Germany isn't a global power but a regional power with regional interests. Even if Cuba was another North Korea (also in the ""disruptor group"" of course) it wouldn't be high on the radar of German interests. And Cuba isn't a North Korea and I don't see any reason to treat them any differently then, say, Haiti. Joining the US embargo for example would hurt German interests; it certainly would aid US interests (legitimate or not, rational or not) however.

German interests lie in Europe, Russia, and Northern Africa. Players, and thus potential antagonists are the countries in these regions and every power that has a significant influence in these regions, in particular the US (economically and militarily) and to a lesser extend China (economically). 

North Korea is hardly a threat to German interests (again, I'm not even discussing if they're legitimate of illegitimate interests). Russia is a threat. So is (surprise entry:) the UK as it's their goal to neutralize the EU. So is the US with their influence on German political decisions and their espionage hurting Germany's economy.

Few, if any challenges Germany faces could be countered with hard power.

Note: I'm not ranting or bitching or saying ""Boo, the US is worse than North Korea"". I'm defining German interests as a regional power and not making moral judgments.

Simply put: Patriarchy :D As a male I do not grow into being sexualized by teachers &amp; my peers (y'know, grades for cleavage) but on the other hand I am somehow expected to be rebelleous and I have to proof myself as ""manly"", at least for my peers. 

&gt; So teachers actually get involved with you, and care about your well-being, try to help you, etc? 

Well, some do. I do not know about the other schooltypes (Realschule, Hauptschule) but at the Gymnasium I was at ,and a few others I know for that matter, we had the teachers advised to look for problems of the students. Which meant they would talk to you if they got the feeling that you've got problems at home etc. Mind you, that's a few of them. Most will just do their job :D

&gt; isn't the ""Hauptschule"" a path to failure

It is. Most times you are screwed and pretty much left alone (at least that's the perception I get by looking ""down""). His luck was 1) his father being a cook 2) his family being pretty academic &amp; helpful.
There is a saying ""Auf der Hauptschule lernst du Hartz"" which means that on the Hauptschule you'll just learn how to apply for social care.

Il y a un monde d'avant la chute, un paradis perdu, donc c'est quelque chose qui est en  nous et quelque chose de complètement archaïque: au plus profond de notre conscience il y a peut être toi.""*

[Je suis née Georges, de Laszlho Sefcick](http://www.txy.fr/blog/2012/06/21/documentaire-je-suis-nee-georges-2/), semblable au précédent: Nathalie évoque son parcours compliqué et difficile pour construire son identité.

[Bambi, de Sébastien Lifshitz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGojTjD62EY): c'est seulement la BA mais vous pouvez trouver le docu en entier :). Il revient sur l'histoire de Bambi, transsexuelle connue dans les cabarets parisiens, au parcours époustouflant. (Vous pouvez par ailleurs regarder [les invisibles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoGUWpgF9dY) du même réalisateur, primé aux césar.)

[Entre il et ailes, de laurence Périgaud](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xpzib4_bande-annonce-entre-il-et-ailes_shortfilms): idem c'est juste la BA.

Ou bien les films:

[Tomboy, de Céline Sciamma](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHebAaxnxKM), pusiqu'il a été montré à des collégiens et que c'est un vrai scandale /s. (Et le film précédent de la même réalisatrice: naissance des pieuvres, sur la découverte de l'(homo)sexualité à l'adolescence.)

[Laurence anyways, de Xavier Dolan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doh3M35m6z8). Les deux étant facilement trouvables en version complète....

Poland, there is definitely some skepticism over here.

PiS,PO (both center-right, at least officially),TR(center-left) and some less relevant as SLD(social democrats - ultra left) and KNP (ultra right) 

&gt;What are the circumstances in your country, that make people skeptical?

""Losing our sovereignty"" fear mongering.

&gt;What groups of age, wealth etc. tend to be skeptical?

Brainwashed &gt;60 y/o PiS voters and edgy &lt;18 teens who vote KNP.

&gt;Do people want your country to step out of EU or do they just want EU to change some things?

Said groups are the most vocal about it. Maybe not about leaving completely but they are constantly saying Poland would do better without EU. [Of course it is not true](http://i.imgur.com/5OK28JN.jpg).

A lot of judges said smoking on the balcony is allowed and even with open windows when the smokes gets to the neighbors.

The least you can do is ask your neighbors if they could smoke at another window or you could just close the windows where they smoke and open another window at another side.

The last I would do is complain to your landlord if your neighbor is really undiscerning.

The thing is, creationism is just an interpretation of the creation stories in the bible (there are two, and they contradict each other within just a few pages).

Creationists make the point that if you are you going to start calling some parts of the bible as metaphors, then what's to say the whole thing isn't a metaphor and none of it is real? 

Let's be honest - you can't really be religious without perverting science. The second you start talking about supernatural imaginary beings, you've left the realm of science. Creationists just take that to its natural next step.

Look through my post history, it's been a month or two since I've posted something about the European Union's security situation, and the second topic I posted here I only stumbled across while googling for sources while discussing the topic in this thread. 

And I have spent copious amounts of time explaining to you that a good number of influential officials in the European Union and national governments, indeed, citizens in Europe itself, do wish to see the European Union become more integrated and exert more influence on the international scene, with both soft **and** hard power. This is absolutely undeniable and irrefutable. And I'm not trying to convert anyone, but it is obvious, from this thread alone, that there are many Europeans who agree with me. 

And if the E.U. did not want to integrate militarily, E.U. Battlegroups wouldn't exist, the Franco-German Brigade would not exist, NATO itself would not be standardized to the degree it is and France &amp; Britain would not have signed that security agreement. And if the member-states of the European Union did not want to launch interventions, they would not have called for Libya, they would not have called for Mali, they would not have participated in The Balkans and they would not be in CAR right now. 

And as for me not automatically changing my views, I pose the same question to you. And drop the superiority bullshit, just because I hold a different view-point than you does not mean I have a superior view than you, nor does it mean you hold a superior view over me. It just means our opinions differ. There are plenty of experts on the European Union who agree with my line of reasoning, as there are those who agree with yours. 

**EDIT:** And if this discussion, which doesn't happen as frequently as you contend it does, enrage you so much, why don't you simply ignore it? Why must you childishly attack my character and refute me on a personal level instead of with a intelligent debate about the subject at hand? If you're tired of it, don't participate, but don't use that as a excuse to insult me and accuse me of having a agenda, when I simply have a strong opinion.

EU scepticism is widespread and growing. The main reason are, IMO, failed hopes. Joining EU didn't bring  economic prosperity and didn't help with corruption a little bit, it actually increased it.

Few recent public opinion researches:

* [From summer 2013](http://cvvm.soc.cas.cz/media/com_form2content/documents/c1/a7097/f3/pm131009.pdf): 28% people thinks EU membership is a good thing, 26% bad, the rest is undecided. 43% thinks it helps the country,  41% thinks it makes things worse. 18% would like euro, 76% does not.

* [From Spring 2012](https://www.euroskop.cz/8952/20696/clanek/cvvm-plan-sjednotit-evropu-nema-podle-vetsiny-cechu-budoucnost/): 1/3 of people thinks EU has a future, 52% does not. Less than 1/5 would like deeper integration, 2/5 would like to keep it as it is, 23% would like weaker EU. 22% would like stronger participation of the Czech Republic in EU, 40% the same as is now, 24% weaker.  Only 40% people trusts in EU, lowest number since 2003.

* Eurobarometer research from Spring 2013, available in English: 54% people identify with EU (one of the lowest numbers).

These opinions are spread throughout the population, without major visible age/social class divide.


The scepticism (or better: feeling of helplessness) managed to penetrate the major political parties. As if the Brussels is a natural disaster that cannot be avoided and has to be survived somehow. No major party, however, even suggests leaving the EU.

The UK Government and political class supports the EU and wants greater integration BUT the UK voters never wanted to join the EU, do not want any further integration and would ideally like to leave the EU immediately.

true,graendallstud,FRAN,France,"&gt; Where are you from and how big is the skepticism in your country?  

France; skepticism is significant.

&gt;What relevant political parties are running in the EP elections in May?  

FN (far right, nationalist); UMP (right, conservative); MODEM (center right, liberal); PS-PRG (center left/left, socialist); EELV (left, green party, regionalist); PG/PC (far left and communists) : these will won sieges  
DR (a-politic?), DLR (nationalist, gaulist), and Force Vie (christian democrat, right, conservative) : these may gain a siege or two  

&gt; What are the circumstances in your country, that make people skeptical?  

Political critics : FN and DLR criticize a loss of national sovereignety; UMP (sometimes) and Force vie (always) criticize the liberal stance on social questions; DR criticize the whole representative system and ask for a direct democracy (Swiss model); PS-PRG (sometimes) and PG/PC (always) criticise the liberal stance on economic questions; EELV and MODEM are fiercely pro-european.  

&gt;What groups of age, wealth etc. tend to be skeptical?  

I would say the separation runs over wealth lines (the richest more pro-EU, the poorest more anti-EU); but this is just my perception at the moment, and I don't have data regarding this, so you may better disregard this answer.  

&gt; Do people want your country to step out of EU or do they just want EU to change some things?   

A minority wants to step out; a majority of eurosceptics just want EU to evolve: FN and DLR are the most vocal on the the topic, and wants to give back to national parliaments powers granted to the EU parliament; far left mostly wants an elected executive branch and a grezater parliament power over the executive.

Putin(Путин) 68%

Zyuganov(Зюганов) - an old communist 11%

Zhirinivsky(Жириновский) - an old clown 7%

Prokhorov(Прохоров) - an oligarch 4%

Medvedev(Медведев) 2%

Shoygu(Шойгу) - a capable executive but not a leader 2%

Others - 6%


So as you can see there are no alternatives to Putin.

&gt;What if Putin would step down and let an other politician besides Medvedev or any other puppet become the president?

Why would he step down to put a puppet on his place? What's a point of ding that? His current term ends in 2018 and he can go for another one a keep his presidency up to 2024

&gt;Would it be possible that the whole system breaks down and causes a situation similar to the 90s?

Possible? Yes, but highly unlikely. At least I can't see that happening. Even if say Putin suddenly dies vertical of power will still be there.

&gt;Are there serious more democratic alternatives to Putin that can keep Russia as a world power and stable (as much as it is for now)?

Well, current oppositional movements are laughable, their only election platform is that they are against Putin. And with Putin's high approval ratings that is a stupid way to go. There are certainly more democratic politicians, however any collaboration with current government will lead to the ""Putin's Puppet"" label.

* An improved Iraqi economy. Iraq's GDP, which had been crushed by sanctions, after the war recovered strongly, growing robustly in every year since 2006.

Pakistan's entire GDP is not derived from U.S. development aid, and you're completely disregarding the massive amount of aid that China or the European Union give Pakistan. But I don't see you demonizing China or the European Union for funding the Taliban. Odd that.

Pakistan would've funded the Taliban regardless of how much development aid they were getting.

It has to do with us being a very superstitious country but what's interesting about Romanian creationism is that, like many other things in Romania, it's basically a joke. Everybody believes in creationism but nobody really believes in creationism and at the end nobody really cares. When I was in school I remember talking about creationism but not in biology class(we had a stupid teacher who didn't know how to teach) but in Geography where I had a brilliant teacher. And the general tendency was, you know, nobody really knows, the fossils are fake, the bible doesn't really sound right, it's a debate and that's all. In religion classes I had first a teacher who believed in god and all that but didn't really care about the classes because he thought that religion shouldn't be taught in schools so we all had the mark 10(the highest) and nobody cared. And after that I had a teacher when I was in high school which tried to tell us that creationism is the only way but everybody was making fun of her with stuff ""god says we shouldn't pray to idols, aren't religious objects idols?"" or didn't really care and had the mark 10. 

If I think about it the majority of people from these schools are creationists now because of some sort of superstition(If you don't believe in god he will beat you[ that's literally how we say in Romanian]) but they only way that's affecting society is that sometimes the priests blackmail people into giving money.

The italian in which it's written, its rethorical figures just perfect, its length. Everything adds up to something that not even Shakespeare, which comes second in my worldwide literature view, can aspire.

I got into 2 or 3 fights with other pupils in the years, one guy who really pissed me off, he began hitting me with his scarf where he put a knot into and we had a rather long fight in front of our fat history teacher who did nothing apart from sitting in his chair and telling us to stop. In that fight I had the upper hand and stopped and went back to my chair as I realized it has gotten to far (I tried hitting him with a table). That fucker had the guts to backstab me, he came from behind with a great swing and hit me on the right side of my head. I carried it off well, didn't react to it and kept on following the lesson although my head hurt for about 2hours. Then some other guy who came new into our class in grrade 8 or so, he thought it would be fun to pick on me. After some time I had enough and snapped, I tried to fight him but the other guys in my class held me back. He stopped picking on me from that on.There never were real injuries, only bruises mostly. After all we were teenagers in our early years. I also have some stories about mobbing and stuff but that's another thing.

Most teachers were really laid back, relaxed and awesome and I liked most of them, of course we had to be polite and always call them by the surnames and never address them informally. Always with the formal ""Sie"" or ""Herr X"".

But if we're discussing the case for war, Saddam had been far harsher on his own people than Qadafi had been. He had used chemical weapons on Kurds during their failed rebellion, he had started a incredibly massive and destructive war with Iran etc etc.

If no no flight zone had been set up over Kurdish Iraq, and they were not mostly acting in an independent manner and if they rose up against Saddam then would our intervention be a good cause?

If the lead up to the war in Iraq moved away from WMDs, and pushed entirely on the effort for humanitarian reasons would that be a good cause? 

If we found more than the handful of chemical weapons after the invasion, but the aftermath played out the same, would it be a good cause then?

Does it just come down to the level of intervention? Bombing and Special Forces = OK , full invasion = not OK?

Ça ressemble pas mal à du Paypal en fait. Du coup pour le fournisseur c'est assez risqué en fait.

&gt;Ca permet de faire opposition quand tu veux et d'empêcher les prélèvements abusifs de frais bidons dont certaines entreprises rafolent. Au lieu de se servir sur ton compte, ils doivent te convaincre de payer.

Oui donc le prélèvement n'existe pas sur Bitcoin. Ce n'est pas qu'il existe plus de possibilités, mais en fait moins.

As far as I understand, UKIP simply wants out, as fast as possible. In that case trade relations would have to be negotiated anew. While I'm certain the result would be a generous free trade relationship in all fields where it's of mutual interest, the small print would most likely tip the balance in the EU's favor as the bigger part. UKIP is not a threat to German or European interests, maybe to British.

But UKIP is not in government, the Tories are. Cameron's policy is different. He wants to free the UK from EU rules while keeping all benefits, by remaining on the negotiation table on both sides, i.e. setting the rules at which the UK exports and imports (goods, services, capital and people) while vetoing any of the EU's attempts to protect their own interest. And that is, what the EU is not, namely a threat to our sovereignty. 

The Tories see the EU as an aberration pretty much as Putin probably sees the post-Soviet Ukraine as an aberration. The idea that the EU is an entity in its own rights that protects its interest is alien to them: Sovereignty must lie with nation states. The EU shouldn't actually exist (in its current form) thus they don't even see the need to negotiate in good faith. Quite the contrary, thanks to the spin of their own media they're probably convinced to act in the interest of the European nations. This is a clear lack of judgement and thanks to it things might get very ugly in the near future.

This seems to be only valid, if European Laws would not get replaced by National Laws and/or if the corresponding National Laws would also be lifted.

- Don't listen to people telling you bavaria is conservative or even racist!

- Munich is a city that has the pleasure to welcome many, many tourists.

But don't for a second think that can't be reversed, nor that it's destiny can't be changed.

true,anarchisto,ROMA,Romania,"Basically, it's some kind of celebration centered around killing a pig the traditional way and then cutting and processing the meat. You can find it across Eastern Europe.

This traditional way is frown upon by the EU animal welfare laws which says that the pig must be unconcious while it is killed; some people around here think this would ruin the whole experience. You need to hear the pig squeaking!

There were discussions about this when Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU and there were also when Croatia joined last year. However, it seems the authorities will turn a blind eye as long as you do it in your backyard and not in an industrial setting.

[A bit more details about it from a 2007 article in The Economist](http://www.economist.com/node/10131771):
 
&gt; During talks in Brussels last year, the Romanians asked if Christmas pig-killing might enjoy the exemption given to Muslim and Jewish butchers. The commission said no. The directive offers an exemption only for “religious rites”, and Romanian practices are deemed traditional, not ritual. This distinction causes mild offence. Officials in Bucharest say that Christmas pigs are killed around the feast of St Ignatius, on December 20th. They may be sprinkled with holy water. Adults watching the slaughter will traditionally be fasting, and will not eat the festive dishes derived from the pig (jellied bits of head, pork cabbage rolls with polenta, blood sausages and so on) until Christmas Eve. Some village schools give pupils the day off for the pig killing, and children are fed singed bits of skin to cheer them up. “The children will cry for the pig, because it has been their friend for a year,” admits Niculae Lazar, a government vet. But backyard pigs lead better lives than industrial farm animals, he adds.

[or, another description from Czech Republic](http://www.radio.cz/en/section/panorama/pig-slaughtering-feasts-on-their-way-out):

&gt; A pig-slaughtering feast is precisely what the name suggests – the slaughter of a pig out in the open by a master butcher, the processing of the meat and intestines in front of those invited and subsequently a boisterous pork feast accompanied by drinking, music and dancing which generally leaves everyone much the worse for wear.",0,1391693274,null,0,1391693846,0,cf8hiok,t3_1x5zyx,t1_cf8hiok,t1_cf8h0w0,null,1432278946,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Around 13 % are pro Euro as in want to have it. About 80 % are against it and the rest are undecided. 

As for EU - Around 40 % are pro EU, 25 want to leave now and around 35 % are undecided. 

I can give you links, but is your Swedish up to it? 

Unfortunately, for democracy, almost *all* political parties are pro Euro and pro the EU. I say unfortunate, because it is bad when there is a huge disparity between what people think and what the politicians do. I must add though that apart from Fp (Folkpartiet) the major parties might officially be pro the Euro, but most of them say that ""we follow the will of the people, who voted no"" (in 2003) and we will not join until people vote yes. Then they can defend their former stance and not take one either. However, several promintent politicians like Anders Borg (minister of finance) several social democrats etc have said that they are against Sweden joining now, against it in its current form, don't like the Euro etc. Basically, joining the Euro is so far from the reality that it is not even an issue, and it is a sure way to get voted away if you are a big party who tries to go for that. 


But, if you are against the EU it is tougher. The only two parties against it are Sverige Demokraterna (SD) and Vänsterpartiet (v). SD is one of those populistic parties one sees popping up everywhere,and v is the (former at least that is what they sometimes claim) communist party.

Just because there is really no one to vote for in the EU elections apart from those if you don't like the EU, or where it is heading, I predict that those two parties will do very well in our EU elections

[""NEXIT"" - by Capital Economics: Assessing the economic impact of the Netherlands leaving the European Union (EU)](https://www.capitaleconomics.com/data/pdf/NExit.pdf)

&gt;*""Any decision to leave the EU is first and foremost a social, cultural and political one. It must revolve around issues of national sovereignty, citizenship and freedom of determination,""* [the report finds]

* **Secondary Case**:

&gt;*""""However, there are also good reasons to believe that a nation, untied from the bureaucracy of Brussels and able to make decisions for itself rather than have imposed one-size-fits-all policies, will benefit economically too.""*

Bear in mind the numbers in the poll by Maurice de Hond (55% support leaving the EU) comes off the back of the rejection of the EU Constitution Treaty by 63% that then became the Lisbon Treaty, in the Netherlands. So there is good reason to believe such a poll is indicative even if not predicative of actual voting in such a referendum on the EU.

Cependant, je pense que les conclusions que tu en tires partent d'une conception erronée de l'acte de création. Il y a un seul acte de création divine, qui procède de la volonté du Père. Au contraire du Christ, qui, incarné, s'est soumis au temps, donc à l'expérience, le Père a avec le temps une relation de créateur à créature. Il ne ""fait"" pas à un moment donné, pour ""faire"" autrement à un autre moment.

Le Père crée ""en permanence"" la matière et l'âme ; il met dans les êtres, en permanence, le mouvement (au sens philosophique) dont procèdent les réactions chimiques et les phénomènes aléatoires qui permettent l'évolution des espèces.

Oui, Dieu à *voulu* l'Homme, et les puissances de la nature qui permettent l'apparition de l'Homme viennent d'un *dessein* de Dieu qui est *intelligent*. Cependant, l'*intelligent design* comme théorie ne professe pas seulement cela : il présente comme *surnaturels* les processus qui conduisent la chimie et la biologie naturelles à produire l'Homme avec le temps. Or ces phénomènes sont (probablement) seulement naturels, en tous cas l’Église n'enseigne absolument pas qu'ils soient surnaturels.

Plus généralement, voir un conflit entre l'acte de création *ex nihilo* (qui a en fait lieu hors du temps) et la constatation que la causalité s'inscrit dans le temps, que l'état du monde présent est le résultat de l'état du monde passé, est une erreur conceptuelle. Un mathématicien dirait que ces phénomènes sont *orthogonaux*.

Voilà voilà, si tu veux je peux appuyer ça avec les citations des Pères/Docteurs/Papes qui vont bien (surtout Saint Thomas d'Aquin en fait), mais j'ai la flemme d'ouvrir ma Somme.

Quant à la généalogie de Jésus, déjà les version de Luc et Matthieu diffèrent complètement, ensuite le texte de Luc fait précéder la généalogie d'un ὡς ἐνομίζετο, traduit dans la Bible liturgique par ""à ce qu'on disait"", qui a un côté ""traditionnel"", ""coutumier"". On aurait pu traduire ""selon la coutume"". C'est clairement la relation d'une tradition orale (jusqu'à un certain point) puis écrite, qui a la même valeur que les récits génésiques : de la légende, du symbole. On peut décortiquer les nombres d'ancêtres (le décompte des générations a une grande importance pour le juif orthodoxe Matthieu, beaucoup moins pour le juif de culture grecque Luc), on peut tenter de concilier les deux, mais ça n'a pas vraiment de sens.

&gt; **Belborn**

&gt; Eingeladen und angekündigt für das WGT 2002 war zunächst auch “Belborn”. Dann verschwand der Name von der Liste der auftretenden Künstler, so daß man gespannt sein darf, ob den Veranstaltern wenigstens ein Licht aufgegangen ist und Belborn wirklich nicht auftreten. Das Neo-Folk-Projekt betitelt sich nach eigenen Angaben nach einer “Wortkreation aus dem heidnischen Gott BEL und dem deutschen Wort BORN, wie Lebensborn” (Lichttaufe, Neofolk Netz-Seite, März 2001). Hier ist der Name dann auch Programm: so liest man in der Band gerne Bücher von Ernst Jünger und Julius Evola, einem Berater des italienischen Faschisten Mussolini, steht auf Leni Riefenstahl, wettert gegen “den oberflächlichen amerikanischen Lebensstil” und fühlt sich überhaupt “hauptsächlich als DEUTSCHE” (Fluxeuropa, Englisches Netz-Magazin, März 2002).
&gt; 
&gt; Doch damit nicht genug: Sie beteiligten sich an einem Sampler zu Ehren der faschistischen “Eisernen Garden” Rumäniens und befanden sich dabei in “guter Gesellschaft” mit dem Projekt “Von Thronstahl” des Antisemiten Josef Klumb und anderen einschlägigen Kameraden des rechtsextremen Rands der schwarzen Szene: Blood Axis, Ain Soph, Scivias, Changes und Egoades, einem Projekt des ehemaligen Herausgebers des faschistischen “Musik”-Magazins “Europakreuz”, Marco E. Thiel. Ein damaliger Autor des “Europakreuz” namens Torsten Bunk, ehemals Mitglied der mittlerweile verbotenen Nationalistischen Front (NF) und deren Kandidat für die Bremer Bürgerschaftswahl 1991, wußte schon in Ausgabe 17 (12 / 1996) allerhand Wissenswertes über die “Eisernen Garden” zu berichten: “Fester Bestandteil dieser Aktivitäten war die direkte Aktion gegen das Judentum. Schon am 09. Dezember 1927 veranstalteten die Legionäre am Rande einer Studentenversammlung in Oradea ihren ersten Pogrom. Sie zerstörten und entweihten fünf Synagogen der Stadt. Kurz darauf kam es auch in Klausenburg / Cluj zu Ausschreitungen, von denen acht Synagogen betroffen waren. (...) Die Legionäre gaben nicht klein bei, sondern liquidierten den Ministerpräsidenten Ion Gheorge Duca auf dem Bahnhof von Sinaia. (...) Nach Vorbild der SS entstand zusätzlich zur staatlichen Ordnungsmacht eine Legionärspolizei. Die Legionäre errichteten eine Terrorherrschaft gegen politische Gegner und Juden. (...) Es kam zu schweren Pogromen in Bukarest, wo 127 Juden ermordet wurden.”
&gt; 
&gt; Natürlich wollen Belborn nicht in eine politische Schublade gesteckt werden, weshalb ihre Linkliste auch rechtsextreme Musikprojekte wie Allerseelen, Von Thronstahl, Waldteufel (Heimliches Deutschland) und Blood Axis sowie rechte / rechtsextreme Labels und Vertriebe wie Eis und Licht oder VAWS weiter empfiehlt. Man weiß also, wo man steht.

One media outlet from Romania, a sort of fox news (very nationalistic, capitalists, incredibly pro-american), had a habit of bashing anti-mining and anti-fracking protesters. They were defending Chevron's decision to start exploration when locals opposed them and protested against it. 


So in their minds, Chevron, the american assholes that were to blame for countless environmental disasters all over the globe are somehow suited to play with our national resources because of capitalism and energy independence, but the moment a russian company wants to do it, it becomes a matter of national security. 



And from what I see, the press in a lot of countries are constantly looking for reasons to hate russians.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"Ireland.

It's complicated. Strictly speaking, there is no eurosceptic party of any relevance. The party that usually urges a No vote at EU referendums (we have one on every EU treaty change) is Sinn Fein, who are our nationalist party - but nationalism in Ireland is about recovering Northern Ireland, and Sinn Fein are pro-immigration and internationalist, so they sometimes seems a little strained when they're acting anti-EU, particularly since in government in Northern Ireland, they're quite pro-EU. In the EP, they sit with GUE/NGL, not with people like EFD, and I can't imagine for a moment them getting into any alliance with Farage and UKIP - he's like a caricature of our old imperial masters.

Nor is there any anti-immigrant party of any significance, and there's more or less a voluntary ban on discussing immigration amongst Ireland's media and political classes. That's kind of reasonable, given that we're a nation of emigrants ourselves (although so are the Brits). We do have a specifically anti-immigrant party, our Immigration Control platform, but they've never even come close to winning a seat in a local government election, never mind nationally or at the EU level.

We did of course give birth to Libertas, who frightened the heck out of everyone in the 2009 euro elections, but turned out to be a paper tiger. But even Libertas weren't really anti-EU - in fact, it turned out that although they were capitalising on anti-EU sentiment, their leader is a euro-federalist who would like the EU remade along the lines of the USA.

As to the general public - we're in a state of euro-fatigue. Pretty pissed off, but with sentiment already recovering somewhat, partly because a lot of what got said about the EU's part in our downfall at the time is proving to have been more or less just made up. Unlike in larger nations, while we grumble about the shortcomings of the euro, the idea of exiting is not taken seriously, because a free-floating Irish currency would be toilet paper in a week. In fact, we've never actually had a free-floating currency - it was pegged to sterling until we joined EMU.

An indicator of how Ireland considers the EU, and the euro, is that even at the height of our anger at the EU, we passed the Fiscal Stability Treaty in referendum, by a fairly solid margin. I'm not sure there's even any coherent thoughts about how the EU might change - obviously if the euro was better tailored to Irish conditions, we'd be happier, but I think there's an appreciation of the fact that it was to a large extent up to us to trim our sails to suit the euro-wind, and what we actually did was put on all sail and head for the rocks at full tilt. So there's maybe rather more of an introspective wish to reform our own body politic than to reform the EU.

Even if you just buy and cook groceries I think more than half of your money will go into basic food/hygene/household products (4-5 euros a day, if you manage it very well).

For transportation, if you move only within the city, you need to get a monthly pass for metro, buses an trams, which is around 33 euros (1 euro a day).

Do you have to pay bills at your place? Adsl is easily 30 euros a month, so I would suggest to do a mobile subscription instead (I currently pay 5 euros a month for 3gb traffic).

Do you have to buy books or other stuff for your studies? Academic books are really expensive. Sometimes you can manage by using photocopies, but sometimes teachers require you to have the original book. That's a thing to keep in mind.

If you don't have other expenses you end up with 2-3 spare euros a day for fun or emergencies. Not much, but I think you don't risk starvation.

true,emergency_poncho,EURO,European Union,"good points, I agree with everything you've said.

I agree that Germany is (rightfully so) afraid of being drawn into military conflicts that aren't in its interests, but rather American ones. That is the main risk of changing to a more proactive foreign policy willing to use military assets, if necessary.

Even things like contributing more to NATO forces would put Germany at risk, since NATO more often than not submits to American interests (since the US contributes more to NATO than all other partners combined).

However, one area that Germany could be more active in militarily is in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), and, more specifically, its Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). CSDP launches civilian and military missions only in Europe's regional sphere of influence (Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa), and is only engaged when NATO chooses not to engage. It is entirely EU-controlled, and responds to EU security interests.

[overview of CSDP civilian and military missions](http://www.eeas.europa.eu/csdp/missions-and-operations/index_en.htm)

Currently, Germany does financially contribute to these missions, and it's definitely an important contribution. The main financing instrument for military missions is called Athena, and every EU member state contributes proportionally relative to its GDP, so Germany contributes the most.

However, Germany hardly contributes anything in terms of personnel and military boots on the ground. If Germany does wish to begin developing a more active foreign policy with recourse to military assets if the case requires it, being more active in civilian and military CSDP missions might be a good place to start.

What do you think?

Edit: an added benefit would be to begin to make German citizens more used to Germany's increased military presence outside of the country. Currently, something like 75% of the german population believes Germany is either doing too much, or just the right amount, so there is little tolerance for an increased german military presence. But if germany were to contribute to CSDP military missions, which are usually small-scale, low intensity, with few, if any, casualties, then German citizens might begin to become more acclimatized to germany's more assertive military presence, and Germany could then scale up its military presence internationally, if it felt that to be in its interest.

true,theothercoolfish,CZEC,Czech Republic,"&gt;The pope (if I should choose one ""standard"" branch of christianity) doesn't seem to want to interfere to much with science.

Hm, do you really want to use the Catholic Church as an example of religion not interfering with science? Really? Condoms and aids anyone? Contraception in general even? The thing is, just saying that there are gods interferes with the scientific world view. There's as much evidence for Zeus and Thor and Odin as there is for Jesus (the biblical character) and Yaweh. Once you believe that any one of those deities is a real thing, you've lost some grip on your scientific understanding of the universe. 

&gt; It would be a bit like if I was a atheist would say that god must be evil by using boolean logic in some most likely possible way. Nobody serious goes around doing that, because it would be fucking silly. 

Actually, atheists have been doing that for a long time. 

&gt;“Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?
Then he is not omnipotent.
Is he able, but not willing?
Then he is malevolent.
Is he both able and willing?
Then whence cometh evil?
Is he neither able nor willing?
Then why call him God?” - Epicurus


Science and religion offer two viewpoints on the universe that are fundamentally incompatible. Science says we've got real stuff here, we can figure this out. Religion says ""It's magic!"". Creationists take that incompatible view to the farthest possible result to the point that it looks ridiculous even to the moderately religious. They aren't ""abusing"" science, they've abandoned (or in some cases, were never properly introduced) it completely.

true,Type-21,NRW,Nordrhein-Westfalen,"&gt; your characters should greet other characters with the ""Heil Hitler"" greet, to make it authentic.

Be careful with that when soldiers are involved. At the homefront, sure, they greeted like that. But the armed forces really didn't want to use that greeting.

From wikipedia:

Initially the Nazi Salute greet was forbidden for uniformed soldiers. The military salute was used. Then a decree from 19. September 1933 said that the Nazi Salute has to be used when the national anthem is played (or the Horst-Wessel-Song) and when greeting civil members of the government/administration. For every other situation the decree specifically told to use the militarysalute (and when not wearing headgear by turning your head).

From 1935 on soldiers were to greet with the military salute when wearing headgear, and with th Nazi Salute when not.

After the attempt to assassinate Hitler on 20 July 1944, a new decree was issued stating from now on only the Nazi Salute is allowed for soldiers.

On 3 May 1945 Dönitz, German head of state, forbid soldiers to use the Nazi Salute in any form. The military salute was to be used again.


Non army related things:

- during Carnival the Nazi Salute should not be used.

- Nazi film production did not display the Nazi Salute in films. There's only one exception in a film from 1941 where it's used ironically by a gas cashier when a woman doesn't pay her bill.

an interesting anecdote:
&gt; On 11 March 1945, less than two months before the capitulation of Nazi Germany, a memorial for the dead of the war was held in Marktschellenberg, a small town near Hitler's Berghof residence.[51] The British historian Ian Kershaw marks that the power of the Führer-cult and the 'Hitler Myth' had vanished which is evident from a report given in the little Bavarian town of Markt Schellenberg on March 11, 1945:

&gt;""When the leader of the Wehrmacht unit at the end of his speech called for a Sieg Heil for the Führer, it was returned neither by the Wehrmacht present, nor by the Volkssturm, nor by the spectators of the civilian population who had turned up. This silence of the masses... probably reflects better than anything else, the attitudes of the population.""",0,1391697626,null,0,false,0,cf8iqqy,t3_1x4vkm,t1_cf8iqqy,t1_cf8f8ui,null,1432279594,1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,1

&gt; Augenzeugen berichten später von einem „hellen Blitz“, der im Haus zu sehen gewesen sei. Offenbar hatte ein Sicherungskasten im Erdgeschoss aus bislang unbekannten Gründen Feuer gefangen. Auch Brandstiftung wird bislang nicht ausgeschlossen. Der tödliche Qualm zog in die oberen Stockwerke. Die Brandermittler des Landeskriminalamts haben Untersuchungen aufgenommen. Sie vermuten Brandstiftung als Ursache für das tödliche Feuer!
&gt; 
&gt; Der mutmaßliche Brandherd: ein Kinderwagen, der im Eingangsbereich der von Flüchtlingen und Asylbewerbern bewohnten Unterkunft stand. „Das ist die wahrscheinlichste Variante“, sagte Polizeisprecher Holger Vehren. Die Polizei hat eine Sonderkommission eingerichtet.
&gt; 
&gt; Das Motiv für die Brandstiftung ist noch völlig unklar. Die Beamten suchen nun Zeugen, die rund um den Brandort verdächtige Beobachtungen gemacht haben. Die Brandermittler könnten auch einen technischen Defekt nach wie vor nicht vollständig ausschließen. Der Kinderwagen stand in der Nähe eines Elektroverteilerkastens.
&gt; 
&gt; Die Stadt Hamburg nutzt das Mehrfamilienhaus mit elf Wohnungen als Unterkunft für Flüchtlinge, Asylbewerber und Obdachlose. 46 Menschen hätten bisher dort gelebt, sagte eine Sprecherin des zuständigen Landesbetriebs „Fördern &amp; Wohnen“.

Capital Economics &gt; About Us:

&gt;**""Capital Economics is one of the leading independent macro-economic research companies in the world**, *providing research on the US, Canada, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australasia, Latin America, the Middle East and the UK, as well as analysis of financial markets, commodities and the consumer and property sectors. Founded in 1999...*


Capital Economics Wins the Wolfson Prize:

&gt;**The Prize, which is the second-biggest award to an economist after the Nobel Prize**, *sought to find the best answer to the question: “If member states leave the Economic and Monetary Union, what is the best way for the economic process to be managed to provide the soundest foundation for the future growth and prosperity of the current membership?”.*

&gt;*""There were more than 400 entries from a wide range of competitors, including global financial institutions, independent consultancies and leading academic economists. Our initial submission was updated and improved to take account of comments from the judges and the revised version is now available.""*

&gt;*""With events in the euro-zone constantly developing and driving sentiment worldwide, it is more important than ever to get sound, rigorous and independent analysis of the pressures facing the currency union and its future prospects.""*

&gt;*""Capital Economics has been well ahead of the pack in anticipating developments in the region, concluding as far back as 2010 that the chances of some form of euro-zone break-up had risen above 50%. We will continue to publish detailed analysis of the issues raised and their implications both for Europe and the rest of the world.""*

&gt;*""If developments in the euro-zone are likely to affect you, you need to see our European service* – **even if you don’t agree with us!**

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"The study seems to base a lot of its conclusions on the work of Open Europe, a UK think tank which in my experience can be guaranteed to give a negative slant to anything EU - for that reason, they're the eurosceptics' ""independent think tank"" of choice, and I've never seen anyone else (including the UK government) accept their research as unbiased. 

Not only that, they're using Open Europe in preference to other studies on the same subject, which exist (and often from official sources), but which aren't even mentioned as alternative views. That's inevitably going to push the conclusions in a direction that their client PVV are going to be happy with, while being defensible as ""independent"" because Open Europe also call themselves ""independent"".

More importantly, perhaps, I find it extremely hard to take seriously predictions of GDP in hypothetical situations and based on extremely limited data, when GDP prediction itself is a far less precise science than long-term weather forecasting. On top of that, the scenario painted is a ""best of all possible worlds"" one, in which the post-EU Dutch governments undertake, comprehensively, holistically, and without visible resistance those policies which are supposed on paper to lead to the best outcomes, while the world provides no nasty surprises which might upset the utopian picture.

Also, while estimating the costs of a euro exit is necessarily imprecise, it seems to have been waved away here entirely, although multiple analyses at the height of the crisis put the costs for a euro exit by a member at significant fractions of national GDP.

Overall, a study which despite its ""independence"" delivers an appraisal deliberately tailored to the preferences of the client. Which is, of course, how consultancies stay in business.

This removes some degree of short-term benefit for much better and sustainable long-term benefits.

Let's assume for a second that Greece was not part of the EU. If it had its own currency, then all it needed to do was deflate its currency, which would make its exports (the few they have) vastly more competitive globally, and make Greece a very attractive tourist destination and investment destination, boosting its economy. Greece could effectively have spared itself the worst of the crisis. But then it would not have undergone any of the very real, very urgent and badly-needed reforms to its broken system. 

Sure, being in the EZ means you lose certain policy tools, but you gain a lot more. In my view, in the long run it's better to enact difficult reform than just deflate your way out of a crisis.

I do agree with you that the EZ is not an ideal currency union. But you have to keep in mind that the EU is still under construction, and it takes time.

I just searched the document for ""Open Europe"" and it produces 10 hits. 8/10 of those hits are in Chapter 4: Costs of EU Regulation. The rest of the chapters don't mention Open Europe bar 2 other hits which are:

1. *All Parliamentary Party Group for European Reform, Inquiry into the EU single market in services (Open Europe, London), 2013*
2. Sarah Gaskell and Mats Persson, Still out of control? Measuring eleven years of EU regulation (Open Europe, London), 2010. pp1-3

Second one again on *regulation*. I presume Open Europe has done an extensive study on Costs of EU Regulation that Capital Economics deems valid, in concluding:

&gt;*""reduce the costs of doing business in the Netherlands by a minimum of €20 billion annually by 2035 through ‘renationalising’ regulations in areas currently in the jurisdiction of Brussels institutions""*

The UK itself has been in talks with the EU over cutting costly legislation for additional context.

Looking at the references section, large part of the sources for analysis are attributed to ""Capital Economics"" themselves on such issues as: Public Finances, Immigration, Globalization, Macroeconomic policy, Currency, Sovereign Debt etc and more. They also provide their data sources such as Eurostat, WTO etc.

true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"Bon, ben pour une fois qu'on peut faire du /r/debatereligion/ en français dans le texte, avec un catéchisme commun, je vais pas me priver! :)

Donc, de ce que tu dis, Dieu a lancé toute la mécanique, a priori au moment du Big Bang, et n'est plus intervenu jusqu'à, à peu près, Jesus (ou Moïse selon à qui on demande). C'est le dieu infalsifiable, qui ne gêne personne en fait: tout ce qui arrive, il l'a voulu, et son plan est mystérieux et indiscernable.

Mais donc, l'âme, c'est émergent de la chimie et de la biologie ou pas? Jean Paul II a l'air de dire que non avec insistance. Et c'est il me semble un tenant de la foi catholique: l'apparition de l'âme est un acte divin direct. Donc quelque part entre Lucy et Neanderthal, il s'est passé un truc surnaturel pour les catholiques. 

L'évolution, la façon dont elle a démarrée, et du coup dont elle s'est déroulée, a été décidée par Dieu avec pour but (unique? je trouve prétentieux pour l'église de dire ça, mais c'est bien ce que JP II dit) de créer les humains. Etant tout-puissant, et omniscient, il n'a pas à intervenir à chaque étape, se contentant d'avoir mis toutes les billes en place là où il faut, mais le design est bien là. Il n'y a pas de grandes différences entre un événement improbable survenant quand même et une intervention directe de Dieu. Pour l'église, l'affaire est entendue: il a pipé les dés pour qu'on apparaisse, même si ce n'est pas lui qui les lance. 

Autrement dit, sans l'attention particulière de Dieu envers la race humaine, impossible pour un process naturel d'engendrer un réceptacle adéquat pour l'âme. 

Sur la généalogie, le ""à ce qu'on croyait"" me semble clairement, dans toutes les traductions que j'ai pu lire, se référer à la filiation supposée entre Jesus et Joseph et que l'on sait, à ce point du récit, fausse car c'est Dieu qui a provoqué la grossesse. Elle ne me semble pas du tout servir à mettre en garde contre une incertitude sur la généalogie de Joseph.

Je rappelle quand même l'introduction de cet évangile:

&gt; il m'a aussi semblé bon, après avoir fait des recherches exactes sur toutes ces choses depuis leur origine, de te les exposer par écrit d'une manière suivie, excellent Théophile, afin que tu reconnaisses la certitude des enseignements que tu as reçus.

Ça la fout un peu mal après ça de pas être capable de dire où s'arrête le factuel et où commence la légende. On peut supposer que l'auteur de l'évangile de Luc pouvait au moins trouver le nom du père et du grand père de Joseph et qu'il connaissait un peu la généalogie autour de David et Salomon. Pour un récit écrit sous influence du Saint Esprit, c'est pas terrible...

Ça prouve au moins une chose: les premiers catholiques prenaient cette histoire de descendance d'Adam très au pied de la lettre. Mathieu lui ne prend pas de précaution oratoire et balance une généalogie reliant Jésus à un autre personnage de la Genèse: Abraham. Le ton est factuel, péremptoire. Je ne comprends pas comment les catholiques peuvent dire qu'il faut prendre les évangiles pour factuels, recherchés et précis et la genèse pour de la légende. Au niveau de la crédibilité c'est comme si je commençais une biographie de Georges W. Bush en le faisant fils de G. Bush puis en remontant une généalogie jusqu'à Sauron de Mordor.

Eventually, all countries that joined the EU in the 2004 'Big Bang' expansion and after will have to adopt the Euro. This is a constitutional requirement; there are no more derogations for anyone. So we'll see a closer and closer union between the Eurozone countries and the European Union. It's just a matter of time.
 
You can't blame the Euro for everything. There are certain countries with the Euro that have very good fiscal policies, and other countries that also have the Euro that have very poor fiscal policies. It's not a Euro divide, it's a north-south divide, which exists for cultural reasons, mainly.

The countries that have the Euro enjoy additional protection than those that are not. They can benefit from the stability of the Euro. Imagine how much worse many of the national economies would have been if they had national currencies. They also benefit from lower interest rates when they borrow - much lower than if they had a vulnerable national currency.

Of course, I'm not saying it's perfect. One requirement of a optimal currency area are transfers. In the US for example, rich states transfer funds to poorer states, and maintain (roughly) equality by redistributing the wealth. In the EU, there is no such mechanism, because there isn't enough solidarity between people from different countries.

The study informs that any question has as primacy = self-determination but the study then says it does not factor that question in, it only looks at the economic consequences and finds them to be broadly positive on exiting.

Hence:

&gt;*""is it true that Wilders is stressing the economic benefits of this policy, rather than the self-determination issue, when presenting it to his voters?""*

...it's no wonder that Wilders talks up the ""Economic"" benefits when talking in relation to this study.

There is another reason as above for talking up the economic benefits: When you can quote a figure that households across the country will be benefitting by ~8-9k pa eg, then you have a much more popular and direct political appeal via practical substance over more abstract reasons such as self-determination. That's work stating.

&gt;*""is it true that the study he's using willingly downplays the risks of his policy, meaning it's not objective and shouldn't be used as supporting evidence in an argument?""*

The risks I'm aware of are the renegotiation phase with the EU over treaties and leaving the EURO. I think all experts appear to agree these are ""known unknowns"" so there's interpretation on it. Legally Article 50 TEU of the Lisbon Treaty should resolve the reforming treaties question and seeing as Netherlands is a prosperous country (or was) and is very positive for Europe, you could guess that would go well. The EURO might be a lot trickier:

&gt;*""It is simply impossible to judge in advance how markets will react in the immediate period after NExit becomes public knowledge. The unexpected should be expected. Market volatility is the only certainty. But history provides little useful insight – as most major currency fractures have been forced upon authorities by markets. NExit will be the other way round. Looking beyond any initial uncertainty and volatility, the mid-term value of the new guilder should rise or fall to unravel any structural mispricing of Dutch factors of production during the euro period.""*

Bear in mind this agency won the prize on a regulated break-up of the euro area. So there guess is as good as anyone's:

&gt;*""But there are also significant risks to staying in a bloc with a fundamentally flawed currency and transfers to debt-laden peripheral states spiralling out of control. In this instance, our analysis shows that the Netherlands is not better off with the devil it knows, but by taking control of its own economic destiny.*"" 

So maybe it's not wholly presented with ""scientific impartiality"" but then Wilders could argue that arguing the dangers of leaving is the job of his political opponents and not his job: Which is to argue the benefits for leaving out-weighting the dangers or costs?!

It wasn't by much, but we beat you, without going nuclear.

&gt; You can step up because you were so bad and because you have coal. How do you step up from hydro? 

Fair point. Still, Germany is reducing amply. If you want someone to bash, bash, say, Australia. Or Spain.

&gt; And why don't you go faster? 

Well. Even with nuclear, that'd be hard. We of course decommissioned the oldest plants first, and they are in no condition to be re-activated. Even without being decommissioned, they're so old it'd be irresponsible to use them. Building new ones takes at least a decade, and then they need to run at least two decades or so before they even start to not be utter money-sinks.

Contrary to popular thought, nuclear actually *is not* cheap. Just have a look at the UK, they're introducing feed-in tariffs for it. It needs massive subsidies to break even, and that's not even counting not having to pay for their own insurance.

OTOH, we could spend all that money to invest in renewables, flanked by gas (which are re-usable as burners for bio- and wind gas). We are *not* expanding coal capacities, all new plants are replacements for old, inefficient ones. Coal plants, unlike nuclear, are cheap enough to build and raze.

Also note that this is all only production, and only electricity. Heating, for example, uses more and more wood pellets (we have ample of wood). Energy consumption overall gets lower and lower. There's action on all fronts.

""Not caring"" looks way different.

&gt; When will you be as emission free as us? If you go with nuclear, you can stop adding to climate change and pollution within 10-15 years. That is not happenign now in Germany. 

Well... *we*, as in Schleswig-Holstein, already are emission-free when it comes to electricity, we're producing more renewable than we consume. By 2020, production is projected to be 300-400%, which would cover *all* energy consumption... by Joule, at least.

So let's put these options we're discussion in some made up context.

Diamonds can only be made from the tears of dying pandas and they're useless for other practical purposes. 

&gt;a) You tell everyone that if they obtain illegal Diamonds that they'll be crushed. Thus aside from making it much more expensive also a risk and something that can't really be shown around without questions.
Some buyers might think: Damn this stuff's expensive and risky if I get caught. Better not buy.

&gt;b) You tell them it's okay because the panda is already dead anyway.
You normalize already existing diamonds. More people get to know about this kind of stuff and there's less risk to having already illegally created diamonds. Additionally the market-price is cheaper.

You could argue that b lowers the incentive for poaching since it's so risky to do.

I don't see why this ivory shouldn't have been used for jewelry and sold, given than the animals are already dead. I'm ok with stopping the hunt of elephants, but this action is just french officials try to look like the good guys when in reality they're just being stupid. 

What they did is not different than setting fire to a big pile of cash. Cash that could have been taxed and used as research investment, welfare money, defense money, all that while not hurting animals.

One of the issues surely is that fusion reactors are big, and thus lead to centralised infrastructure. However, having a couple of big plants to flank the smaller ones isn't a bad idea, either, both extremes can lead to fuckups.

And while it may come too late for us, at current energy consumption levels, it's still useful to do. First off, we can sell a handful to Australia who seem to hate renewables.

This is the only line I disagree with.  In my mind, if you sell weapons to a country, you are helping them fight.   I also believe there were quite a few other instances of the weapons being used improperly than in Saudi Arabia.  There have also been cases of German companies bending the rules with regard to dual use technologies.  

I admire the pacifism of most Germans, and believe they could easily be trusted to have a larger military, and to be a very responsible power in Europe.  Besides some military hospitals and perhaps some depots, I would love to see the US remove almost all of its troops from Europe.  I also fail to see what the purpose of NATO is any longer.  Even if Germany did not wish to change its military at all, I still see no reason for American troops to be stationed in Europe in such numbers.

(Encore une fois, je précise cette domination masculine généralisée ne veut pas dire que chaque homme, individuellement, maltraite les femmes qu'il connait ou croise sur son chemin.)

Le truc important, c'est précisement ce que tu dis : aucune différence que ce soit un homme ou une femme qui soit ton boss (par exemple). On n'est vraiment pas si différents que ça. Donc il y a aucune raison de voir perdurer les discriminations qui existent entre les hommes et les femmes, et qui résultent de la domination masculine.

Que sont ces discriminations, ces conséquences négatives de la domination masculine dans la vie de tous les jours?

Ce sont la façon dont les femmes se font traiter dans la rue (cf le court métrage), le fait que les qualités mises en avant pour être un leader, pour réussir professionnellement sont des qualités traditionnellement étiquetées masculines, le fait que ne pas rire à des blagues sexistes à deux francs au boulot vous fait passer pour une féministe rabat-joie mal baisé, même si la blague est blessante, etc ...
Et surtout, le fait que, malgré toutes les études et les travaux sur le sexisme, il faille encore et toujours se défendre et expliquer que oui, tout cela existe.

Les hommes aussi en subissent les conséquences, comme je l'ai dit plus haut. Il est difficile pour une homme d'adopter un comportement étiqueté féminin sous peine de se faire rabaisser.

Tuttavia, non posso lamentarmi, pur essendo questa pizza più ""croccante"". Ho assaggiato quella con lo speck e con il bre e l'accostamento di questi due ingredienti mi è piaciuta moltissimo.
Il prezzo è più alto rispetto alle mie zone poichè una singola pizza, una coca cola, patatine e acqua naturale sono costati 18 €, prezzo più alto rispetto a quelli a cui sono abituata.
L'ambiente è rustico e smplice ma il personale è molto cortese.

Utente campana scrive che ha apprezzato la pizza, dà una recensione tutto sommato positiva, mette tre stelle. Risposta del proprietario:

Un mec qui deal du shit, il a une raison pour ne pas dealer de la coke ou de l'héro, carrément plus rentables.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"Well, if they did, they'd be as accurate then as they have been, by what you're saying. If the serious economic/governance case for euroscepticism is only *now* being made, then clearly the *existing* euroscepticism of the majority in the UK is *not* based on that serious case.

I'm kind of tempted to pull experience on this one, because EU referendums - referendums in general, in fact - are regular occurences here in Ireland, so if you're politically interested then you have a pretty good idea of how these things work.

And what I'd say on that basis is that nobody who's genuinely interested in such things should pretend that these studies and reports are really the basis on which most people make up their minds. They're really just comfort blankets that help people go ahead and vote the way they *want* to. In the case of the Brixit referendum, I think it's pretty much the case that the dominant position is an exit vote, and that that's probably the way most Brits *want* to vote - but they want to be confident that there aren't any major drawbacks to doing so, because really and truly despite the noise made about it, the EU is not a poll-topping concern (even for UKIP supporters). So when I say that it's how they *want* to vote, I don't mean that there's a solid and powerful public will, but rather a majority preference of various strengths, mostly probably fairly weak. 

Those preferences will translate into votes for an exit if voters can be convinced that there's nothing to lose in an exit, because if there's no cost to something then you might as well go with exactly what you want, no matter how little you want it. 

That's going to be tricky, though, because so far at least, UK business is coming out and saying that there *is* something to lose. And unlike politicians, the only reason businesses have for saying there's something to lose is that they actually do have something to lose. They're very self-interested, and that self-interest is not a political one, but an economic one.

As a native English speaker who's nearly fluent in French, I've never understood how this is a valid argument for french being harder than Spanish. Words in French are also pronounced the way they are spelled, with very few exceptions, the pronunciation rules are just different. (having silent consonants at the ends of words doesn't mean those words aren't pronounced the way they are spelled, if that is a uniform rule). French pronunciation might be harder for beginners to grasp a hold of, but IMO it's easier to master than Spanish.

&gt; Pas forcément un, encore que ça semble le plus probable. Il est clair que l'âme spirituelle est apparue d'un coup. 

Par un processus naturel ou surnaturel ?

Du coup, ~80 générations entre Adam (le premier humain à recevoir une âme) et Jesus, ça te semble crédible ?

&gt; La personnalité des auteurs imprègne profondément les Évangiles.

Dommage qu'ils soient anonymes pour 3 d'entre eux sur 4 alors. À moins que ? L'Église a peut être prétendu par le passé que les évangiles sont nommés d'après leurs auteurs, mais il me semble qu'aujourd'hui elle ne le fait plus ?

&gt; et c'est la sagesse de l’Église qui a discerné quel texte était exempt d'erreur

On est d'accord pour dire qu'elle s'est bien plantée dans le passé ? 

&gt; Maintenant, quand les heures de la journée sont décalées entre deux récits identiques dans deux évangiles, ou quand une phrase est tournée différemment, il n'y a aucun problème à reconnaître que la mémoire des témoins a pu les trahir sur un point de forme. 

Perso cette façon de faire, assez proche de ce que pratiquent les historiens, ne me choque pas du tout. On compare ce que les différents témoins ont dit, on vérifie si c'est cohérent, on considère que ça se tient quand ça l'est, qu'on a le droit d'avoir des doutes quand ça ne l'est pas.

Ceci dit, je voudrais faire remarquer un truc. Tes témoins, ce ne sont pas des témoins. Ils parlent de l’annonciation et de l'arrivée des rois mages, de l'histoire de plusieurs personnes, affirment qu'un ange est apparu à untel ou untel, mais ils en étaient témoin de ça ? Non, ils ne pouvaient pas être témoin de tous les événements qu'ils décrivent. Vraisemblablement ils ont plutôt recueilli d'autres témoignages. Mais du coup, de quoi étaient-ils témoins ? Il est évident que les auteurs des évangiles ont intégré comme des faits à leurs récits des témoignages d'autres personnes sans préciser ce qu'ils ont vu directement et ce qui leur a été rapporté.

Je t'ai montré que contrairement à ce que tu dis, ce ne sont pas les femmes qui sont les premières victimes de ce que tu appelles patriarcat. Ce sont les hommes des classes défavorisées. Et c'est une grande partie des hommes.

D'autre part, je t'ai montré qu'il n'y a pas de patriarcat [au sens sociologique](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarcat_(sociologie\)) : il n'y a pas de détention de l’autorité par **l**es hommes. Au contraire, il y a un phénomène de négation des hommes qui n'ont pas d'autorité, ce qui amène plus d'exclusion, de violence et d'inégalités.

&gt; je précise cette domination masculine généralisée

Je précise justement que ce n'est pas généralisé mais au contraire très minoritaire et que ça n'a rien de masculin, mais que c'est le résultat d'une compétition acharnée pour la survie et [la reproduction](http://critiquedufeminisme.wordpress.com/2013/10/20/la-querelle-du-menage-4-option-securite-strategies-matrimoniales-et-ecarts-dage/). 

En particulier, il n'existe pas de discrimination systématique envers les femmes, ni de répartition des comportements en deux colonnes ""hommes""/""femmes"".

Au passage, tu oublies un critère très important qui est celui des classes sociales : les hommes des classes défavorisées, bien plus nombreux que les hommes des classes favorisées, n'ont pas des comportements que tu qualifies de masculins (qu'est-ce que cela veut dire?).

&gt;le fait que les qualités mises en avant pour être un leader, pour réussir professionnellement sont des qualités traditionnellement étiquetées masculines

Comme je le précise [ici](http://www.reddit.com/r/Politique/comments/1x2ouv/la_nouvelle_promotion_de_lecole_nationale_de_la/cf7u31p), c'est un renversement de valeurs puisque ces qualités peuvent très bien être considérées comme des défauts. Pourquoi être Égoïste, Grossier, Orgueilleux, Excité, Jaloux, ou Désordonné serait-il une qualité ?

Le vrai problème, c'est qu'on est en train de dire que ces attitudes, qui renforcent l'individualisme, la compétition, l'exclusion, sont des qualités en oubliant qu'être altruiste, empathique, sensible, ordonné, poli, calme, respectueux etc. ne sont pas des défauts.

On est en train d'admirer l'individualiste qui exploite et domine, alors que sa domination est le fruit de l'élimination de ses adversaires au lieu d'admirer ceux qui aident et partagent. Cela renforce évidemment le phénomène d'hypergamie féminine, qui est une véritable discrimination envers les hommes.

Comme je le dis souvent, être exploité par un homme ou une femme m'est égal. En cela, le féminisme est évidemment un allié du capitalisme, désirant imiter ceux qui exploitent au lieu d'aller vers plus d'égalité, et cela explique sa surmédiatisation et sa récupération pour diviser et affaiblir les classes défavorisées.",0,1391715132,null,0,1391715312,0,cf8qj5a,t3_1x1mh2,t1_cf8qj5a,t1_cf8nnkg,null,1432283325,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

And sure, I appreciate Russia isn't going to let the EU have its way in the Ukraine if it can prevent it, but, as has been pointed out, Russia has a plenty of the harder kind of soft power too. If the EU puts, say, trade sanctions on the Ukraine, the Russians can retaliate in kind, and the only result is to make the Ukraine poorer and more unhappy.

&gt;*Washington (CNN)* -- President Barack Obama is trying to limit the United States' role in enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya to support aircraft only and is very reluctant to commit any offensive U.S. firepower, a senior U.S. official familiar with the military planning discussions said Friday.

[Libya, Europe and the future of NATO: Always waiting for the U.S. Cavalry](http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-fuure-nato)

&gt;America was visibly reluctant to get involved, let alone lead the action. And, having helped to knock out Libya's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes, it pulled back from the front-line operations. But America's role remains essential, not least in providing air-to-air refuelling, as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the European allies.

A couple of showcases from his comment history:

&gt; It's natural to be racist against blacks. You can't help but notice their behavior. You can't help but notice that every time you see certain types of stories, it is a black guy.
You see a story here on reddit with the title: Elderly Woman Critical After Being Stabbed for her iPhone.
I mean, you just know it's a black guy. Sure, there's a chance it might be some other race, just like there's a chance I might win the lottery tonight, but betting it is a black person is a pretty safe bet.
Then there is everything else about them. How ugly and physically unattractive they are. How unintelligent they are. How most of them are on public assistance.
They really are just repulsive creatures, and there is NOTHING wrong with being prejudiced against them.

&gt; When I first arrived in Italy from Tunisia, I was a bit disappointed by how difficult it was to get on benefits, and even once I started receiving a check, it wasn't as much as I had been expecting. Luckily, thanks to the EU, I was quickly able to make my way to the UK where I now collect a much more generous monthly allowance, along with free housing for me, my parents, my eight children, and 14 of my brothers and sisters.
I've always appreciated the beauty of white women, and was delighted when i found that thanks to EU human rights laws, I could rape and molest the local women almost with impunity, simply claiming that I would tortured if sent back to Africa. Thanks to being able to claim racism, the local authorities generally don't even investigate most of the time.
I don't know what the future holds, but I would like to see the rest of this lovely continent. Moving from country to country, living off of welfare, raping and robbing as I go, just enjoying life.

&gt;Pire, les annonces en ligne, fièrement affichées, d'un nettoyage de liste de contacts fait pour le soi-disant bien de la communauté, de l'expulsion de ces supposés trolls infiltrés, semblent devenues la norme de la figuration cybernétique d'un V de la victoire virtuelle sur la horde des prétendus malfaisants dont il semble aussi et tout autant falloir se prévaloir pour s'assurer de sa propre inscription à l'univers (apparemment de plus en plus restreint et circonscrit) des entités fréquentables et des natures tolérantes.

Les organisations issues du mouvement ouvrier et démocratique ont toujours épurés leurs rangs, y compris la SFIO dans ses premiers jours; étaient-t'elle fascistes ? Non évidemment. Ce que dit l'auteur ici n'a donc rien à voir avec le sujet.

&gt;L'Humain d'abord ?

Je suis d'accord c'est un slogan vague et inutile qui prête a confusion... Mais quand même:

&gt; On a déjà eu Staline, merci.

Déjà, ce fut un plaisir. Et enfin, assimiler les communistes (puisque qu'il parle de Staline et non de Blum ou d'autres) d'aujourd'hui à leur grands pères me paraît maladroit. Pas mal de choses ont changé depuis l'an 40. Malheureusement on ne nous fournit pas d'explication de ce parrallèle. Donc je suppose que c'est juste un slogan. Ouf.

&gt;Plus les jours passent, plus on a le sentiment qu'il n'est (presque) plus jamais fait appel ou laissé de place à la Raison, à la tempérance, au quant-à-soi. On est Camarade aujourd'hui, on est salaud demain. 

Comme par exemple ? Sans déconner c'est chiant quand il y a pas d'exemple à discuter. Après effectivement si je vois quelqu'un qui fait volte-face par rapport à son engagement je ne vois aucune raison de rester à ses côtés. Il est par ailleurs étonnant qu'en disant ça, l'auteur dénonce en filigrane les pratiques des années 40-50. Car ce fut l'époque où le mouvement ouvrier était le plus unifié, et surtout le plus ouvert. Notamment avec la main tendue de Duclos aux catholiques et aux petit commerçants.

&gt;L'ironie tragi-comique de ces postures idéologiques figées qui n'ont jamais mené qu'au désastre et à la défaite réside dans le fait inouï que ce fascisme de comportement vient en écho à une perpétuelle dénonciation du fascisme chez les autres, ceux du camp d'en face, ceux-là mêmes qui sont partisans d'un régime autoritaire, conservateur, réactionnaire et nationaliste.

Il m'a l'air de faire référence a la politique antifasciste des années 50s. Effectivement, à cette époque là, on purifiait copieusement les collaborateurs, mais bon, on venait de se prendre une énième guerre au dessus de nos foyers. De plus cette politique là a été mise en oeuvre en unisson par toutes les forces politiques du pays dans un cadre d'alliance nationale. Parler de doctrine fascisante alors qu'on a mis tout le monde d'accord pour mettre en place cette même doctrine est stupide. Où alors De Gaulle et George Bidault sont fascistes mais ca devient rapidement de la connerie.

Là encore je ne fait qu'anticiper, l'auteur ne juge pas utile de préciser de quoi il parle.

&gt;Camarades qui excluez à tour de bras les prétendus félons à la solde du prétendu fascisme que vous subodorez au coin de tous les mots qui ne ressemblent pas aux vôtres, vous m'inquiétez.

Oui, et il y a des athées catholiques, qu'est-ce que ça prouve ?

Ce n'est pas UNE idéologie, c'est devenu une religion, avec ses courants, certains bien intentionnés, mais les autres ont évidemment dû pactiser avec le pouvoir comme Saint Paul l'a fait pour promouvoir le christianisme à Rome. 

Donc oui, je suis d'accord, si l'on fait abstraction de ces définitions, que l'on regarde les courants qui nous arrangent, le féminisme, tout comme le catholicisme, est une bonne chose. Lorsqu'il est récupéré par le pouvoir, il devient misandre et un allié du capital.

La question est donc, ce qu'on nous présente comme du progrès, en particulier les études de genre, sont-elles féministes ? Les courants comme ""Osez le féminisme"" sont-ils féministes ? La ministre du droit des femmes est-elle féministe ?

true,WorldLeader,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;If Europe really wanted to, they could have a lot of hard power.

I disagree. I've been privy to some internal, high-level discussions in Brussels about the future of European defense trends and organization (including the CDP) during my time at NATO. The fact is that they are more than willing to spend the money, but they don't know how to spend money correctly. The bureaucrats and advisers want to build faster jets, armored tanks, and their own GPS system (Galileo) because that's what they think having a strong military entails. 

So when Europe does have some moment where they need to militarize quickly, they'll build their Eurofighters and tanks and battleships, but they will be sorely lacking in C&amp;C, coordination training, logistics, executive, etc. Hell, during past conflicts the radios that different European countries used weren't even compatible, leading to serious issues when trying to coordinate. 

The fact is that 90% of what makes a military effective is logistics and real-time intelligence. You need helicopters, transport ships, transport vehicles, transport hovercraft, in-air refueling networks, spy satellites, drones, 100% encrypted communication at all levels, EXPERIENCE, and most of all a supply chain to get weapons and fuel to the front line quickly. To this point Europe would need at least a decade to coordinate and build an effective system, and by that time it would be too late. In Libya, France and Norway literally ran out of precision bombs and had to have the US resupply their aircraft. In Mali, France couldn't put troops on the ground without ""renting"" (for free) US transport aircraft. They didn't have their own. When you can't even project power in your own region, you have a ways to go before becoming a true Blue Water power.

You are correct that ""Europe"" could build a ton of tanks and aircraft quickly, and even buy a lot of equipment from the US or allies in a pinch, but without experienced logistics operators it's useless.",1,1391717880,null,0,false,0,cf8rvpk,t3_1x6u93,t1_cf8rvpk,t1_cf8psu5,null,1432283961,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

First of all, it is simply physically impossible for the nuclear plants to have such accidents anymore. Yes, there can be severe accidents, but they are very unlikely, and things like Fukushima and Chernobyl are impossible. 

It might be that new nuclear plants are not affordable (although I doubt it). But that is no excuse to shut down existing nuclear plants that have not reached their expected lifetime. Shutting down the existing plants is an environmentally and economically stupid move, done because of ungrounded fears.

The waste is a problem, but there are ways to deal with it, and burying it isn't really a huge problem. Humans bury toxic materials all the time, and there are no safer storages than those for nuclear waste.

The thing is, it is, in my opinion, extremely stupid to dismiss nuclear energy because of fears of nuclear disaster, while the world is trying to tackle the much larger and more grounded crisis of climate change. Nuclear energy and renewable energy must work together to replace fossil fuels.

I love renewables. Germany's commitment to them gladdens me every day. But because of the nuclear plants shutting down, all that renewable energy has little positive impact on the environment.

No. This is just a play on words of the phrase ""We have nothing to hide"". It's actually a quote from Nikita Khrushchev regarding his concerns about a combined space program with the US:

&gt;At this meeting Kennedy suggested that the two nations combine space programs to create a lunar program.  Khrushchev declined the offer and was later quoted as saying, “(a combined space program) will mean opening up our rocket program to them.  We have only two hundred missiles, but they think we have many more.”.  After being asked if he had something to hide, he stated, *“It is just the opposite.  We have nothing to hide.  We have nothing.  And we must hide it.”*

Second, it is much easier to refurbish a coal power plant, than a nuclear one. So it is easier to phase out coal, when they are no longer needed. And in the balance, I think that some coal makes sense during the transition to renewable energy production. 

However, I think the actual reason that we rely on coal so much today is purely domestic politics. Merkel did  stop the phase out of nuclear power in 2010, against quite a bit of opposition. When the Fukushima disaster occurred in 2011, she saw that nuclear policy has the potential to overshadow her chancellorship and immediately announced another phase out of nuclear power.

(The crisis here is apart, i meant after it'll be over they'll most likely switch back to working on other topics at hand and won't be here to constantly hold Ukrain's gov's hand so let's have competent/accepted leaders.)
- A lot of backroom deals will most likely happens at sotchi, while everyone is looking elsewhere. Part of it is probably important on said topic. 
- let's be cynical for a moment; as long as the power/fuel/gaz lines from russia stay online (which is the only thing with a tons of deaths we really can't afford); EU has no massive reason to risk shaking the country just to speed up things even more. Since they aren't killing each other as off now and there isn't tons of deaths, we don't have totally valid reasons to utterly force their hands one way or another.
- Since we're not the US cowboys under bush (or at least try to appear not being like them) we won't bring firearms to the party if others don't.
- There's some media muddling here sorry. Yanoukovich has, sadly but actually, still a large massive support in Ukraine. Like 30% totally in favor of him, vs 20% euromaidan totally against him.
- The part **nobody** wants to hear : Ukraine might actually need the russians money. Their strategy made sense here, sadly : take the russian money and custom unions, use the EU's friendship &amp; influence as a doorstoper when needed. Because while we *could* bail them out, it would add *yet* another country on the loss list and the next big thing could actually cripple seriously our entire zone's economy this time. we can't really handle another greece/spain anymore.
- Part of the issue seems to be that Yanoukovich is a huge corrupt asshole who led the country to a police state but at the same time the only one who seems to have any idea how their local economy works. As said tapes said, some are prolly afraid that Klitchko might screw up the country even harder ; even if he's the ""moral winner"" here. Think long term and big picture. The living standards of people in ten years will be are as important as they are now.

What the tapes says to me imho is that the EU is prolly considerating handing over a lot of power to the opposition, and controling tightly yanoukovich to avoid more disappearing-people-shit rather than pushing him out totally when there's few strong men to replace him. And i think the ministry-promotion he offered opposition fall in line with it. Klitchko would probably be a (very?) good 2nd-man, but prez ? I don't know either (also if i understood that one right they'd probably need tymoshenko onboard somehow, no ?).

Now the worrying part is whether the euromaidan will accept to calm down with serious concessions but short of removing yanoukovitch before elections (doesn't seems so).

No offence, I hope, but I really don't think you get the idea of soft power. It's *not* using trade weight as a stick because you're afraid to use military force as a stick. That's just trying to use soft power tools to do the job of hard power, with the same intentions and general strategy. 

We cannot *force* Ukraine to want to be engaged with the EU, and having Ukraine willingly engaged with the EU is what we want. We *might* be able to force them not to engage in a customs union with Russia, which is what you appear to want, but that's not the same thing. And, really, that's actually up to the Ukrainians, it's not up to us to force them, and to do so we would have to lose a good part of the ethos that makes the Ukrainian people want engagement with us in the first place. What we want is a democratic Ukraine willingly engaged with the EU, and we cannot force that to happen - I would have thought the US experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan would make that clear, and the Ukraine isn't different just because the people involved look more like us.

It's not about the Cold War, and I strongly suspect that US meddling is going to turn out to be less than helpful to anyone.

In my opinion, guilt isn't something you should pass on to another generation. That's the concept behind blood feuds and those were abandoned in the west a while ago. My grandfather told me much about his experiences in Stalingrad and the winter war in general. He wasn't scared talking about anything - except being a Russian POW. It were these untold tales that made me a pacifist.

I however do not feel in any way responsible for what's happened before my father or mother were even mentally conceived. What I feel is caution towards politics and popular media. I curse whenever I hear news of the NSA and police(s of the world) doing what had been done prior to Hitler's firm power grab by the SA [Brownshirts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel) (what would essentially become the SS) because to me those are scary signs of people not remembering things outside of popular history. It seems like people care more about the sins committed in Nazi Germany rather than learning the lessons from it: Nationalism and patriotism are idiotic. No matter how big your country, it's nothing without the rest of the planet.

My point is, young Germans being told they're at fault for Nazi Germany's deeds is as valid as accusing young Americans and Canadians for killing first nation tribes: Not at all. It might have been more recent but the current generation had just as much to do with it.

Abweichungen von der Wahrheit.

„Wie spät für was?“

„Wie spät ist es?“ fragte eine alte Dame.

Es war zu früh und die Wörter machten keinen

Sinn (für ihn). Er war noch müde vom Flug. Die 

Reise von Australien war lang und unbequem 

und jetzt wollte er nur ein Bett finden.

„Wie spat für was?“ Die deutschen Wörter 

fühlten sich fremd im Mund an. Der Australier hatte kein 

Deutsch seit Oktober gesprochen. (It´ s okay, but sounds better to put seit Oktober before kein Deutsch)

Die Dame warf ihm einen Blick zu und 

sagte, „Die Zeit, bitte.“

In seinem Kopf wurde alles klar und er 

betrachtete kurz sein Handy. „Es ist halb sieben.“

„So früh?“ antwortete die Dame 

überraschend (überraschend= surprising for the australian; überrascht = surprised)

Er betrachtete sein Handy wieder. Das 

Display zeigte 07.32. „Tut mir leid, es ist halb 

acht.“

Die Dame nickte zustimmend. „Danke schön. 

Gutes Neues Jahr!“ Sie drehte sich um und ging 

weg.

„Bitte schön”, sagte der Australier halbherzig, 

als sie um die Ecke ging. 

Die 106

„Are you sure we’re supposed to be on the 106?“ 

fragte der Australier [zu dem] den Südafrikaner.

„Yeah, definitely. The lecturers kept saying 

we catch the 106 to the hotel.“ Die Lichter (dr)außen 

glitzerten und die Straßenbahn klapperte um 

eine andere Ecke. 

„Nothing out there looks remotely familiar. I 

reckon we’ve gotten on the wrong tram.“

„I’m telling you”, sagte der Süafrikaner, „we’re 

on the right one. Just look out for 

Katzenbruchstraße.“

„Ich glaube”, wagte (risk to do what? you could say wagte der Australier zu sagen or just use sagen) der Australier, „dass wir 

in die falsche Richtung gegangen sind.“

„Fine, wir können hier aussteigen.“ Sie 

standen und stiegen an der nächsten Haltestelle 

aus. Der Südafrikaner guckte auf das 

Schild, „We’re at Alfred-Krupp Schule.“

„But where is that? Hold on, I’ll check my 

map.“

Der Australier sah seine fotokopierte Karte an 

und der Südafrikaner ging zu einer kleinen Frau, 

die an der Haltestelle saß und 

fragte, „Entschuldigung, könnten Sie mir bitte 

helfen?“

„Ja, natürlich”, krächzte sie.

„Mein Freund und ich sind verloren. (it´s okay to say, but ""haben uns verlaufen"" sounds better) Wissen 

Sie in welcher Richtung die Stadt liegt/ist?“ Die Frau 

zeigte mit dem Finger auf die Richtung, aus der/woher 

sie gekommen waren. „Fahren Sie mit der 

Straßenbahn da drüben”, sagte sie und zeigte 

auf die Haltestelle an der Ecke der Kreuzung. 

Der Südafrikaner dankte ihr.

„Komm mal!“ sagte er zum Australier. Sie 

rannten an einen roten Mann (do you mean the traffic light?) vorbei und über die 

Straße. „The old lady said we should catch this 

tram.“

„But this is for the same line we were just on. 

We should just catch the 106 in the opposite 

direction. I think we’ve come too far south”, 

sagte der Australier. Er hatte seine Orientierung 

verloren, als die Straßenbahn durch die dunklen 

Straßen gewickelt hatte (gewickelt doesn´t make sense. You could use sich schlängeln/ gewunden (to wind) or just fahren) . „Maybe we’re 

somewhere in the western part of the city?“

„I think we should just see what’s over this 

hill.“ Mit dem Südafrikaner in Führung ging das 

Paar über den Hügel und die Straße entlang. 

Zweifelhafte Männer standen vor schmierigen 

Ladenfronten und Menschen mit angehobenen 

Hauben (what do you mean with that?) gingen schnell vorbei. 

Endlich sahen sie eine Straßenbahn am Ende 

der Straße. „That’s the one”, sagten sie und 

folgten ihr um die Ecke. 

Als sie sie (=die straßenbahn) fanden, war sie leer. Die Lichter 

waren an aber niemand war darin. Der Australier 

drückte die Taste neben der Tür und begann 

einzusteigen.

„Steigen Sie bitte aus!“ rief eine Stimme aus 

dem Nichts. Der Australier und der Südafrikaner 

drehten sich plötzlich um und sahen den 

Straßenbahnfahrer neben einem kleinen 

Gebäude.

Er stand im Schatten und warf eine Zigarette 

auf den Boden, die er unter (or mit) seinem Schuh 

löschte. „Sie dürfen hier nicht einsteigen, 

sondern um die Ecke.“

Die Jungs (Jungs implies that they´re quite young) nickten und rannten schnell um die 

Ecke, wo sie fünf Minuten später einstiegen. 

„You brought us to the end of the line”, sagte 

der Australier und schüttelte den Kopf links und 

rechts. 

„Ja”, sagte der Südafrikaner mit einem 

Lachen. „Don’t tell anyone.“ Sie lachten, als 

die Straßenbahn wieder durch die Straßen  

klapperten.

Ein Kolumbianer, zwei Südafrikaner, und der

Australier bummelten die alten und jetzt 

mit Stein und Sand gefüllten Schienen entland, auf welchen einmal Kohl transportiert worden war. 

Kinder rannten vorbei mit Schlittschuhe in 

den Händen und Eltern im Gefolge. Sie 

sprachen Englisch und ihre Stimmen trällerten in 

der kalten Luft.

Die Südafrikanerin folgte den Kindern und die

anderen folgten ihr. Sie liefen unter rostfarbene Aufbauten her

und vorbei an einem alten Gebäude, dessen Fenstern mit Brettern vernagelt waren (had to change a lot, caused by the structure of the sentence) . Die schwarzen 

Schornsteine ragten vor ihnen empor und von 

irgendwo klangen Stimmen.

In den Eingeweiden (quite rare to use this word in this context, but sounds poetic, I love it :) ) des alten Minenkomplex

gab es eine Eisbahn. Sie gingen um die Ecke 

und waren plötzlich von Menschen 

umgegeben. Menschen standen um kleine

Stände herum, Currywurst zu essen und Glühwein zu 

trinken. Anderen saßen auf Bänken, um ihre 

Schnürsenkel zu binden oder nahmen 

sorgfältige Schritte zur Eisbahn.

Der Australier stand hinter zwei kleinen 

Damen und beobachtete die Aktion (do you want to imply ""action""? Then it´s better to use something like ""Tumult"" or just ""Geschehen"")   auf der 

Eisbahn. Lila und blaue Lichter färbten das Eis,

als Kinder sich an orangefarbenen Kegeln und 

Plastikpinguinen festhielten und Erwachsene und

Paare bewegten sich um sie.

Er erinnerte sich an das eine Mal, als er mit seiner 

Freundin zu Hause in Melbourne eislaufen 

war. Obwohl er den ganzen Tag an der Bande (that´s what the wall of the iceskating ring is called) 

verbracht hatte, war es gut gewesen.

Aber sie war nicht dabei. Sein heißer

Atem wirbelte in der Luft vor ihm und er drehte 

sich um und suchte nach den anderen.

Unter den Knochen der Zeche Zollverein 

Als ob Tinte in die Wolken gegossen worden 

war (lovely expression!), wurde der Himmel dunkel. Die Schornsteine 

und die großen, kistenartigen Gebäude des 

Zollvereins standen schwarz gegen den 

verdunkelnden Himmel.

Keine Ahnung 

Die drei warteten auf den Leiter der Tour 

vor dem Gebäude. „Wie lange...dauert diese 

Führung?“ fragte der Südafrikaner den Australier.

„Weiß nicht”, sagte der Australier. Er blickte 

sich um. Ein paar Leute standen um und 

warteten auf den Anfang der Tour. „Vielleicht 

eine Stunde?“

„Okay. Das ist nicht zu lang. Wir können...“ er 

pausierte und sein Mund stand offen, „danach 

essen?“ Es war sowohl eine Frage über 

Mittagsessen als auch Wortgebrauch. (what do you want to say?) 

„Ja, das ist richtig”, sagte der Kolumbianer 

beruhigend. Vielleicht war es dieses Vertrauen, 

das er verströmte. Vielleicht war es seine 

Kleidung oder die Brille auf seinem Gesicht. Was 

immer war es, erweckte es den Anschein einem 

Deutscher, dass der Kolumbianer der Leiter war.

„Entschuldigung. Können Sie mir sagen, 

wann die Tour beginnt, weil ich schnell auf 

die Toilette gehen möchte. Gibt es auch eine 

Chance, dass wir die Reliquien sehen werden?

Step one we need some sort of camp where we sort people, wed out criminals weed out terrorists, isolate and treat those with infectious illnesses, especial stuff that can spread ect. Also sort asylum seekers from economic migrants.
If we could run this in North Africa it would be ideal but not sure on the viability, next option be somewhere a bit remote, north Africa would be good because it would mean the boats can never be a good decision you will just be brought back.

Step two asylum seekers are distributed in some sane and fair way, ideally each country taking a proportionate share, best if we can match people to family ties, language, those that need it should have language education provided i would strongly suspect it pays for it's self by avoiding social problems later.

Step three economic migrants must apply the normal way, they are free to leave at any time and will receive food and such they are also free to work on meeting whatever the criteria is for legal migration again i dont see how language classes could hurt here. but there can be no free lunch, what ever your opinion it's undeniable open boarders has no democratic mandate what so ever. at some point we have to confront the fact that people are willing to die to get here, the only way I can square it is these camps being up the ECHR standards if people choose to live out their life there not sure what els to do.

Children being born there is also a big issue can't see a way to stop that happening and at that point there is no legit way to deny citizenship the alternative is a permanent offshore population.

But perhaps this staggering by one generation isn't such a bad outcome. it can flush out the worst aspects of illegal migration and keep the best anyone who's permitted entry would be educated like any European and able to contribute effectively.

It's not brilliant but it's the least awful thing i can come up with, open boarders is the most humane clearly but every single poor person on earth having the right to move here? that's insane no way could we afford it, even if we could it will never happen in a democratic system.",0,1391721390,null,0,false,0,cf8tn6s,t3_1x6ald,t1_cf8tn6s,t1_cf8hguf,null,1432284792,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

But these protest are the worst thing that can happen to this country at this moment.

They are violent protests, not peaceful ones. Tonight the ""protesters"" (a lot of them from the near highschool that houses the more aggressive sort of kids, and from the football team associations, also knows as the dumbest humans you can find on the Balkans) went on a rampage, robing small shops in the Omega shop house, and throwing rocks at police lines, smashing windows, doors and cars.

We have a democratic state, you have the right to vote and be voted for.

All our elections are free and fair, look at the past ones and the reports about them by the EU, USA or OSCE, so there is absolutely no justification for what is being done in Tuzla and Sarajevo.

Unfortunately I am in a huge minority in my opinion about these protests.

People are glorifying these criminals for attacking police officers and for destroying property that will need fixing, and its gonna be payed by the taxes the others pay.

We have elections in half a year, the situation was bad before too, and people still vote for the same people.

These hand full of hooligans and a thousand of protesters do not have the right to dictate politics for a Canton of almost half a million of people.

The people who go there are either the Communist kind, from the sindikats or the hipster kind with their V for Vendetta masks, they want the adrenaline, its the same reason why some of the go watch the football games, they want the adrenaline they get when they behave like rampaging animals.

The most twofacced thing is that the people who protest dont have any idea what they want. Everybody can chant, that they wont no more corruption, but doing it via violent protests is the cowards and lazy mans way.

Its easy to go there, and yell at the cops, throw stones at them, and be angry at them for you dont get why they wont let you go destroy a government building.

Its hard to actually get politically active, make political compromise and fight for the elections and for the votes. But the second you try doing that, people call you a sellout.

So when you try going the democratic way, you are labeled as a corrupt weasel, the cool kids like to act like idiots and riot on the streets, without thinking what do to after the government in the Canton resigns, hold elections, and the same people win, because none of those protesters want to go from home to home, from public talks to public talks or at least volunteer in a political party, to fight the hard way for the country and its people.

I dont like instability, and I think the people who protest are toying with the future here. Instability in Bosnia is not something to look forward to, when you consider the fabric of our society.",0,1391721569,null,0,1391721900,0,cf8tqfs,t3_1x78mr,t1_cf8tqfs,t3_1x78mr,null,1432284834,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16

Maybe you and I disagree over what exactly was meant when that official said ""Fuck the EU"". I interpret that as her being frustrated at the EU's lack of a coherent stance with regard to Ukraine, and she is bemoaning the fact that the EU is doing little to nothing.

It seems you interpret her saying ""Fuck the EU"" to mean that she thinks the US should forge a plan without the EU, and therefore sidelining it. I would honestly need to know more context before I could say which interpretation is the correct one.

&gt;While the point about squabbling etc. may be valid in some general sense, it really doesn't apply here in my opinion. The situation is difficult and fraught with peril. There is no simple multiple choice style set of options that we could choose from. While I'm aware of the existence of sins of omission, I think that treading lightly is the wise thing to do here.

I wholeheartedly agree.

&gt;What exactly is it that the EU should be doing in your opinion?

I don't know. But they should be doing *something*. They should make it look like they have *some sort of plan* besides just watching the events unfold and occasionally issuing statements of condemnation. They should at least make it appear that know what they're doing. Sitting wide-eyed on the sidelines twiddling your thumbs doesn't exactly project confidence.

Estimado Señor o Señora,

Compré una chaqueta nueva, la Dainese Razon (número de artículo:...) de su tienda de Ebay el 24.01.14. La recibí el 06.02.14. Hasta ahora he estado satisfecho con su servicio.

Desafortunadamente, la chaqueta es demasiado grande para mi. He probado varios tipos de chaquetas de cuero de Dainese que me han encajado perfectamente en el tamaño 52. También recibí la opinión profesional de una tienda local de motocicletas y me dijo que mis brazos son demasiado largo y la chaqueta es demasiado ancha. Después llamé al servicio al cliente de Ebay para pedir que debo hacer. Me dijeron que antes de devolverla, tengo que hablar con usted primero.

Lo que entiendo es que tengo la opción de devolver la chaqueta dentro de 14 días después de recibirla. Claramente todavía está de condición nueva. Solo la llevé en mi cuarto en frente del espejo y en la tienda de motocicletas que mencioné antes. Si me reembolsa los ___ Euro que pagué cuando reciba la chaqueta, se la mandaré. Por favor dígame si haya la opción de mandarla gratis. Yo sé que en el contracto tendría que pagar para mandarla y en ese caso la chaqueta estará entregado por Hermes y su asociado español SEUR. Me costará 19 Euro y incluye un número de seguimiento y segura hasta 500 Euro.

Si haya un método que prefieras más, por favor dígame.

We started with ancient egypt and progressed through ""important"" things through the time. Ancient greece, Rome, crusades, middle ages, renaissance, industrial revolution and then the two world wars. We got to the two world wars in the 10th grade, so we were roughly 15 or 16 at the time. Old enough to understand that the stuff happened there was pretty bad. Obviously we touched this part of our countrys' history sooner in school, like in our german class when we read a book about a jewish and a german boy growing up next to each other in the Nazi-Germany time. We also did a class-trip to Weimar, which was a town next to the concentrationcamp ""Buchenwald"" in the 9th class.

As stated, we were all old enough to understand what the fuck was going on in germany 60 years ago. Our teachers were brutally honest to us. It was inhuman, it was disgusting, it was brutal. I for myself was always interested in history, but most people in my class grew sick of this matter, mostly because it was like hot ""food"" three years ago, when we all were 12 year old lil' shits who just found out how to jerk it. By the time we reached this we already heard (and have seen in my case) enough about it. We were sick of hearing ""Guys, this is important! This is our... YOUR history!"" from our teachers, because it kinda wasn't. 

So, to come back to your question: How did we portrait our past self? As inhuman dicks. It's easy as that. We all are ""liberal enough"" to understand that trying to extinguish someone because he is jewish is fucking stupid. On the other side, as I already stated, most of us really grew sick of hearing how we should all be ashamed, because we are not. Nazi-Germany neither IS nor WAS our fault. It's history now.

Sadly, we get our daily reminder on how ashamed we should be. It's like the same as asking a Spanish dude how he feels about his ancestors slaughtering themselves through south america. Or imagine me asking you ""Dude, how do you feel about the south importing human beings from Africa just to let them work on your farms?"".

You begin to learn about the third reich and WWII at an age, which i would argue is not suitable for this topic. The atrocities and bad things weren't hardly a thing on a 12 year old boys mind, but the awesome armies that conquered europe in no time with tons of cool tank definitly were. Visits to KZs weren't taken too serious too. 
This is backed up by the media. Don't get me wrong, you'll hardly find a good german documentary which will say one good word about the war or the third reich...but we get foreign documentaries translated to german too. You'll inevitable learn how a Tiger kicked 40 sherman asses or about the great leaderships of german Generals and so on. It may ber just in my opininion, but especially US documentaires ar far more likely to leave out the bad side of WWII.
So, starting at a young age, you will get a very two sided view of Nazi Germany and i think many kids and teens aren't able to put it in the proper perspective.

Then there is the burden which is dropped upon us by our goverment. Stay clear of any hot topics in  foreign politics, just send a cargo plane but no german will fight. The world thinks of germany as a powerful nation and ally, which should step up, but we are constantly shying away because of our past. And imho the people are deeply divided on this part, some thinking we should do more, some thinking we shouldn't do anything.

I don't know how much information about the controversity about patriotism in germany makes it way across our borders. This summer all across germany people will rise again, waving flags, chanting ""Deutschland"" and march to public places. And it will create a flood of bad press, discussion, blog entries and stolen flags, to fill the void till 2016, when the Euro Cup is on.

Most of the ""normal""  people i know, including me, are thinking its enough. Just leave it in the past and carry on. We are kind of bugged by being constantly remembered and how it is still part part of our daily routine. Not that remembering is a bad thing, it can't be allowed to be forgotten. But getting told that we should feel ashamed is getting old.

true,Cirkas,LITH,Lithuania,"&gt; Why areas where Polish people in Lithuania live can't have bilingual signs?
&gt; Why after almost 25 years of independence Lithuania was not able to provide legislation enabling something similar?

Well, the answer is complex and I am not sure whether I am competent to answer it, but I'll try. I believe that there are no signs yet because of several reasons:

* Politicians' ignorance and other priorities from Lithuanian side.
* Lithuanians are in general very protective of our language as we are a very small nation, e.g. there are limitations how you can name your company or what signboards you can have. Thus, we may be a bit stubborn in certain areas, you can call it insecurity if you want. History doesn't help either.
* There is a distance between Polish minority and Lithuanians, which leads that it is harder to establish something. Lack of communication.
* To do everything according to law, we need to change constitution, which is a very difficult task in Lithuania, especially on not very popular issues (look 2 bullet points above).
* The problems are being solved (probably very slowly, but duh! Politicians/Bureaucrats).
* There is a bit of stalemate now, when Lithuanian politician probably would like to do something about it but cannot as it would be political suicide for them, because in eyes of Lithuanian voters it would be ""a gift"" to a party which is seen as totally anti-Lithuanian.
* Street signs existed all the time and nobody cared, until this nonsense started and someone (probably some smart-ass who sought for revenge or something) found out it is unconstitutional. So street signs is more a consequence of the quarrel than a cause. ",0,1391726818,null,0,1391728719,0,cf8wcae,t3_1x6rpw,t1_cf8wcae,t1_cf8su6x,null,1432286062,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Yes, the damage to Helsinki was indeed relatively light compared to what the Soviets supposed it to be. Their purpose had been to destroy the city with massive consecutive bombing raids. Yet the worst wasn't avoided by luck. Saving Helsinki is a story of its own, and it was done by smart air defence and well placed deception, with the added help of poor Soviet performance.

**Before**

The Soviets had bombed Helsinki several times through the wars, and at the beginning of the Winter War the Soviets bombed Helsinki without even declaring a war taking the city by a surprise. Since then Helsinki's air defence had been developed to better cope with Soviet bombings. But the three great 1944 bombing raids were in a league of their own by their magnitude.

At the 1943 Teheran conference Stalin had gained allied approval for attacking Helsinki with massive bombings. The planning to destroy Helsinki was started December 1943 in ADD (Avyatsya Dalnevo Deystviya), an elite bomber force directly under the Soviet high command including Stalin, and the operation was led by Air Marshall A. Golovanov. 

The Soviets launched three massive night bombing raids with a total of about 2100 sorties and 16500 bombs up to 5000 kg with a total of 2600 tons. The raids happened  on the nights of 1944 February 6–7, 16-17 and 26-27 (&lt;- see a pattern there? yeah, Soviet high-command at work, ""we shall make surprise night attacks every ten days!""). 

Meanwhile in Helsinki the air defence was commanded by Lt Col Pekka Jokipaltio. He was a pretty smart guy and had been developing and improving the air defences for years. His idea of successful air defence was minimizing the damage, not inflicting maximal losses to the bomber force. Therefore instead of concentrating on shooting the bombers down, his air defence put priority on preventing the bomb loads getting to their targets.

In that thinking a bomber without a bomb load was not a threat and no need to waste ammo on. And instead of shooting planes down the air defence's main goal was to scare and distract the bombers from reaching their targets, and to have them drop their bomb loads either prematurely or somewhere else. After a bomber had been seen dropping its bomb load or turning away it was not a target any more.

For that purpose he implemented the paradigm of pre-planned barrage fire. Capt. Pentti Paatero divided the airspace around Helsinki into defensive rings up to 14 km in radius and each ring into about 1-1.5 km wide arcs. Those columns were further divided into 200 m high slices up to 7.5 km altitude. Each slice of airspace was given an ID number, gunnery data was precalculated for each, and the anti-aircraft batteries were trained to quickly target them by the ID numbers. In 1943 Finland had been able to buy German radars which were an important addition to the air defence system.

Helsinki had about 70 heavy anti-aircraft guns and about 40 light guns organized into four heavy batteries and some smaller ones around the city. A single fire barrage to a precalculated target consisted of four shells from each gun in one battery. The fire barrages were concentrated in front of approaching bombers in order to make them turn away from their path towards target, and to scare and distract them to drop their bomb loads prematurely. For added effect some of the AA shells were jury-rigged with magnesium and aluminium powder to create extra bright and scary flashes. 

**The great bombing raids of Helsinki**

*The first raid 6-7 Feb 1944*

While Finnish radio intelligence had noted the growing Soviet radio activity and concluded that a bombing raid was likely, the scale of the attack was unexpected and unprecended. The first raid came as a surprise especially to the civilian population. The Soviets attacked with 785 bombers dropping 6991 bombs or about 1100 tons. Yet the air defence was successful and by far most of the bombs ended up into sea and areas around the city. 

Only about 280 bombs hit the city (~4%).  

Deaths: 105 (3 military)  
Buildings destroyed: 28  
Bombers destroyed: 13  

Some of the bomber flight paths on a [radar map](http://i.imgur.com/d7TPk4e)
The grey striped area is city center, most of the bombs were dropped into sea before reaching target.

After the raid a German night fighter group 1./JG 302 with 12 Messerschmitt Bf 109G-6 night fighters was sent from Estonian front to Helsinki to assist in city's defence. They shot down four bombers in the following two raids.

*The second raid 16-17 Feb 1944*

After the first raid many civilians were evacuated from Helsinki, and the remaining civilian population was better prepared for an attack. Based on radio intelligence the bombing raid was expected, a silent alarm was given over an hour before and air-raid alarm was sounded before actual radar contact on attacking bombers. The Soviets attacked with 406 bombers dropping 4317 bombs or about 682 tons. 

This time the air defence was prepared with a deception: a fake burning Helsinki east of the city. They had collected big bonfires in Vuosaari east of Helsinki, and set up an AAA battery with outdated guns and searchlights over there. When the bombing raid begun they set the bonfires on fire, with the AAA battery firing as fast as they could, and shut down all searchlights west of city. The result was that many bombers got disoriented and attacked the fake Helsinki dropping their bombs into woods.

Again by far most bombers completely missed their target with only about 100 bombs hitting Helsinki (2.3%).

Deaths: 25 (0 military)  
Buildings destroyed: 22  
Bombers destroyed: 8

*The third raid 26-27 Feb 1944*

The last raid was the fiercest. Again the raid was expected and a silent alarm had given the population plenty of time to prepare before the general air-raid alarm was given. And again there were honeypot AAA batteries with searchlights to the East of city. 

The Soviets attacked with 929 bombers dropping 5182 bombs or about 818 tons. They attacked in three waves and the battle lasted for 11 hours. The first phase was a concentrated attack on the city center, but was mostly repelled with some of the bombers getting through. In the second phase the Soviets tried to attack the air defences but failed completely. And the final phase was again a concerted attack to the city center.

And yet again by far most bombers dropped their bombs prematurely into sea or outside the city. Only about 290 bombs hit Helsinki (5.6%).

Deaths: 21 (3 military)  
Buildings destroyed: 59  
Bombers destroyed: 9

Some of the bomber flight paths during the second phase on a [radar map](http://i.imgur.com/TMyO57E)

**The aftermath**

More deception. Finns used a captured Soviet spy in Helsinki to inform the Soviets that Helsinki had been completely destroyed. Also Swedish papers were helping in the deception by publishing fake front page news about levelled Helsinki. 

And the Soviets bought it. The elite ADD bomber force got their awards for job well done and went on to other tasks. Everybody happy.

The truth came out only after the war when the Allied Control Commission led by Soviet General Andrei Zhdanov arrived in Helsinki. Zhdanov was flaggerbasted by the apparent limited damage. He thought there was some sort of fakery going on with fake facades because in his books the city had been destroyed.

Three nights total.  
Bombing sorties: 2100 (400-900 bombers per raid)  
Bombs dropped: 2600 tons (about 16500 pcs)  
Bombs actually hit Helsinki: 670 (~4%)

They will continue to use words like ""unlikely"", ""cannot foresee"" etc to maintain the fear factor they have been generating since this campaign started.

I suspect that immediately following a ""Yes"" vote the CEOs of Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, M&amp;S, Kingfisher, Arcadia, etc will put pressure on the UK govt to accept some form of currency sharing arrangement to ensure their businesses (which must have several hundreds of £millions worth of investment in Scotland) do not have to suffer the transactional costs that would arise by refusing to share.

There is a strong tendency for people who only start to take another language as adults in a sheltered environment to highly overestimate their skills. 

Don't take it personally; the american system just isn't focused on acquiring second languages because everyone (in economically relevant countries) can at least communicate at a decent level in english. Marry a german woman or fully immerse yourself into a german speaking job. Otherwise you'll never get to a relevant german level that leaves you with a productive communication language that is anything but ""nice to have"" for the funny evening out in the pubs. 

My advice: Focus on your major, travel abroad to experience the culture; don't waste your time on useless low-level language studies. Your native language level is fully sufficient, anything else takes too much effort and will hardly ever prove beneficial.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"I really have to disagree with you that corruption is the thing keeping the EU out of this. There might be huge amounts of money travelling from Ukraine to the EU, and that might well be being laundered, but I think that EU politicians have plenty of money already and are more interested in the kinds of things money can't buy (like power and authority) and maybe are motivated by doing the right thing, rather than by a simple desire for money. If all politicians truly are tyranical and self interested (which personally I find hard to believe) then they wouldn't be interested in things so trivial as money. 

Furthermore, the any foreign policy decision by the EU has to be reached by a consensus of 28 member states. 28 different members coming at the problem from wildly different angles, with wildly different interests and completely different voter bases. You're never going to get all of them to agree which is why the EU almost never makes any kind of tangible foreign policy decision. 

I think corruption has become one of those things that we think is there and then we look for all sorts of tangental evidence which suggests that it is, even if that evidence isn't very strong. Sure, there is evidence of corruption in the EU. Tonnes of it. And there is lots of corruption in the EU. Tonnes of it. But I think to argue that right up the highest levels of power are being dictated by some random Ukrainian politicians and oligarchs is just not likely. 

The EU isn't primarily motivated by non-interventionism. It's primarily restricted by its decision making processes. A few members within the EU are in favour of non-interventionism and because non-interventionism means no-action that means they easily win (because non consensus is reached) and the EU's position starts to look something like non-interventionism, even though in reality only a minority of member states are non-interventionist.
