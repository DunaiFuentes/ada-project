true,Bardaf,Zbelleile,Belle-Île,"&gt; Néanmoins je suis scientifique avant tout donc je ne comprend pas pourquoi il faudrait arrêter les recherches dans le nucléaire, même de fission. 

Je ne suis pas pour l'arrêt des recherches, mais je suis pour l'arrêt de l'utilisation. On peut passer au thorium, aussi.

&gt; pourquoi ne pas chercher un moyen d'extraire le gaz de schiste sans polluer ?

Et pourquoi ne pas chercher simplement une alternative plutôt que de chercher à tout pris comment l'extraire ? Laissons le tranquille là où il est.

&gt; oui il faut les accepter car ils ne sont pas d'origine humaine,

Donc même si la très grande majorité des scientifiques alerte la population, tu préfères rejoindre Claude Allègre et les trois ou quatre autres ""scientifiques"" qui nous disent qu'on doit juste ""accepter sans rien pouvoir faire"" ? Il y a eu de nombreux changements climatiques par le passé, certes, mais ils avaient quand même tendance à être longs, là on peut constater la dislocation de l'arctique, la montée des eaux et des températures, mais c'est pas grave, acceptons, crevons à petit feu.

&gt; Légalisation du cannabis

Je vais appliquer ta méthode : En quoi est-ce que ce serait une mauvaise chose ?

Mais je vais quand même donner mon point de vue. Hormis le fait que certains pays l'aient déjà fait, que certains états américains l'aient fait également, qu'est-ce que ça pourrait apporter à la France ? Ben déjà, ça niquerait l'économie parallèle qui fait son beurre dessus, qui provoque des guerres de gangs en banlieue, etc. Ensuite, ça permettrait d'éviter de tomber sur des pains de shit dégueulasses et d'avoir un peu de qualité sur le produit. Enfin, ça donnerait de l'emploi aux agriculteurs. Y a déjà des champs de chanvre à 0,0001% de THC, donc on sait que ça peut pousser sans problème sous nos climats. Franchement, je ne vois pas le problème du cannabis, c'est moins grave que l'alcool selon moi, mais j'imagine que t'as déjà entendu cet argument 800 fois.

Which is an absurd position to take. Giving up any and all control in many areas just so you can have the chance to negotiate FTA's outside the EU is chasing dreams, any FTA Britain could negotiate outside the EU would either be a bad deal or it could be a much better deal if negotiated through the EU. When you're negotiating the largest trading block in the world you can ask for certain concessions which you couldn't if you're just one single nation.

Anyway you cut it, it's simply bad policy.

We should definitely not discriminate based on geography, but we also need to keep the interests of the European Union and its current member states in mind. If adding states would damage the union in any significant way, then I'd be sceptical about allowing it.

I think the geo-politics is the most important part. It's just simply not plausible that Nigeria, Tibet, Ukraine and the United States are going to have even a majority of the same opinions, problems, worries or potential gains because they simply are in different places surrounded by different peoples - to get them to agree even on what the problems are would be nightmare let alone an agreement on the solutions. 

Countries must care about their local area because from an economic, defence and social standpoint the failure or success of your neighbour will affect you more than any other country. In a globalised world you can argue the success of failure of any state has global consequences but the concern for localised problems peters out pretty fast the further you get from the epicentre. A Russian invasion of Ukraine worries and affects Lithuania or Estonia in a way that it will never and can never affect Canada. Sometimes when drastic measures are needed to solve a problem only those who stand to lose the most will be willing to take that action and typically those people are defined by their geography. If Egypt was in the EU it would not be in their interests to blow their budget on military spending to defend a Russian invasion of Europe or to bailout Eurozone countries because they just aren't militarily or economically related enough primarily because the geographic separation.

true,flyingorange,VOJV,Vojvodina,"I'm not a financial expert, but my understanding is that this is a case of redistributing the money. For example, previously the utility companies made large profits, now those profits will be (significantly) lower. The companies are not actually losing money, they're just not making as much as they used to. This is part of a general plan to make all utilities non-profit, since they are essential for living a modern life.

Similarly the banks used to make lots of money and were exporting it outside the country to support their ""home base"", now they don't make that much money and their home base has to sometimes support them.

Previously there was a proportional tax where the rich paid more, now there's a flat tax so the rich pay less and the poor pay more. The ""rich"" should be understood more as above-average. For example I as a software developer make around 100 euros more than I used to, while my wife makes 50 euros less.

In the end it doesn't balance itself out so some additional sources of funding was needed, and I think they solved that by raising the VAT from 25% to 27%

Well there are many other aspects. For example, previously the unemployed were receiving benefits just for sitting at home, now they have to do public works like cleaning the streets. The state can save money by not having to pay a street cleaning company, while the people working also aren't falling into unemployment apathy.

I'm not saying it's all great and wonderful but we're living in capitalism and within the existing framework I think the overall message that you have to work for a living and everyone should get the fruit of his labor is a positive thing.

Hungary might actually qualify for adopting the euro since the deficit criterium is fulfilled, except that the country's debt is at 80% of the GDP while the requirement is 50% I think.

No, you are mistaken. What I want from the UK is to decide whether you want in or out. I don't necessarily want you to leave, it's just that the current situation having you whining all the time and sabording a lot of potential is not tenable in the long run. I want you to either commit to the EU and work with us, or GTFO.

It certainly wouldn't prevent us from trading with you either way. But it probably wouldn't be in your advantage to leave, and I certainly wouldn't want our government to accept the UK's blackmail. I also certainly wouldn't want it to give the UK preferential treatment over other countries.

Right now you guys act like you're the only ones making sacrifices for the EU, and everyone is taking advantage of you. This is utterly false, and incredibly insulting to all the other members, France included.


As to Brussels being foreign, it's a Parliament and Government you are part of. It is a trans-national body, but I completely disagree with you on it being foreign. While you indeed gave it a good chunk of sovereignty, so did everyone else. Leaving the EU does not guarantee at all that you would get back all or even most of that sovereignty. On the contrary, you would still have to obey a great deal of legislation on which you would have no say.

I don't blame you for wanting yo leave. That's your opinion and all. I do believe, however, that it is pretty delusional, and that's the point I'm trying to make here.

[Schadenfeude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude)? You seem more European than your flair lets on. :)

Yes but even in EEA, a less than perfect deal, it's still BETTER than the present deal in the EU! If you look at the links I provided that is the conclusion and yes even under Influence over the legislation it is better.

Here. This is not a bad summary from UKIP's [""Out of the EU and into the World""](http://www.ukip.org/out_of_the_eu_into_the_world_report) brochure penned by MEP William Dartmough (he more or less gets the main points across):

&gt;*98 However, Norway does have significant advantages. Many Europhiles (for example the CBI) state that Norway has no meaningful influence in the EU. They assert that Norway has to accept almost all regulations coming from the Commission in Brussels. The phrase often used is “government by fax.” They argue - on behalf of Norway - that Norway pays already for access to the Single Market, and so should join the EU in order to promote its own interests in the EU Single Market.*

&gt;*99 These arguments distort the definition of “influence”. They further assume that to be part of the EU’s artificial political construct is the only way to promote a country’s economic interests within the EU. The facts indicate the contrary. Norway has a population of only 4 million - less than half the population of London – nonetheless, Norway enjoys a trade surplus of €48.27 billion with the EU.*

&gt;*100 It is not correct to assert that Norway has no influence on EU regulations. As an EFTA member, Norway has the right to advise the EU countries how it would vote, if it had the vote, on proposed EEA regulations. This right ensures that Norway has the ability to influence new regulations; technically, Norway also has the right not to implement EU regulations. Articles of the EEA Agreement explain the procedures for the EU and EFTA working together.xl These articles mean that Norway can influence EU regulations - by prompting debate and ensuring that the EU takes its interests into account. These are ways of influencing EU regulations aside from direct voting. In any case, in the highly unlikely event that the Norwegian people voted for Norway to become a member of the EU, Norway’s vote in the Council of Ministers would be only approximately 2% (per paragraph 66 above). In terms of “influence”, the status quo must be an improvement on 2% of the votes.*

&gt;*101 The number of regulations that Norway actually adopts are fewer than the number of regulations that UK adopts as an EU member.*

&gt;*102 The FTA that EFTA negotiates Norway and all other EFTA members sign individually. In contrast, in the EU, the EU Trade Commissioner negotiates and signs trade arrangements on behalf of All the EU countries. Further, Norway can import goods from other countries under its own tariff regime, as it wishes: Norway is not obliged to apply the EU’s Common External Tariff.*

&gt;*103 While Norway’s financial contribution to the EU is substantial (€347 million annually)xli- Norway still gets tariff-free access to the EU market without its farmers and fishermen being subject to the EU’s Common Agricultural or Fisheries Policies. Furthermore, unlike the financial contributions of EU member states, which go direct to the Commission then to be used only as the Commission sees fit, Norway retains significant control over how its contribution to the EU Regional Policy is spent.*

&gt;*104 It may be that Norway’s arrangement with the EU could be bettered. Nonetheless, Norway retains autonomy in key areas. Norway’s arrangements put it in a much better place than the UK. The UK, as a much larger economy and one in Trade deficit with the EU, ought to be able agree something much better.*

So you see Norway does in fact enjoy influence in the EEA and as a successful and happy country in Europe with a lot to contribute, as well it should. Another argument that the UK could negotiate even better deal: [Switzerland is a more attractive model than Norway, but Britain could do better than either](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100194407/outside-the-eu-we-should-aim-to-copy-switzerland-not-norway/)

Most ethical principles concern themselves with practical matters. In a situation with unlimited resources and opportunities, you don't *need* many rights to make sure everyone gets their fair share.

&gt;Ok, so let me pick an illegal activity. How about Republikflucht, i.e. leaving the GDR without permit. Oh, but that was an unjust law? Yeah, exactly.

You reject the society of GDR, so it's consistent that you break their laws, and you're gone anyway. I don't see how you can justify breaking or wanting to ignore the laws of the society that's so good that you want to be part of it.

&gt;As for your last two paragraphs, I don't really have to comment on them. It just shows what kind of a person you are if you feel the need to equate living in peace and prosperity with a video game console.

Like living in peace and prosperity, video game consoles have a price. You can decree that everyone has the right to x, but organizing that in practice has more requirements than just handing out paperwork that gives citizenship.

&gt;The gradient in development between Europe and some of its neighbours is so big, there will unavoidably be a push for migration.

Of course. How does that necessitate Europe to allow it?

&gt;The only way to combat this properly is to attack the causes, namely the development gradient.

Exactly. And how will braindraining the continent of their enterprising, relatively well-educated and well-endowed (they can pay smugglers) young people accomplish that?

Allowing Russia total freedom in the red zone is your safest bet if you believe the first picture is an accurate representation of reality, if they'll touch the blue then that's it, we go to war. 

But really, I don't think the line is that clear. It's not clear for many reasons. For example, the EU has made it crystal clear that its eastern members are second class members and completely subordinate to the west. Romania and Bulgaria are not in the Schengen Area. The worldwide perception of these countries is that they're ""not real people"". When Ukraine got invaded the internet was like *they should let Russians kill them anyway, Ukraine isn't real, we're not going to war over a bunch of tadpoles that live in the mud*. It would be very easy for NATO to just drop a couple of countries if they get invaded without discrediting the alliance itself. People's reaction would just be something something potato something something gypsy and then they'll reheat the same stupid broth about how the US military could wipe the floor with Russia's even though that's not what matters in war and it's an insanely dangerous thing to play chicken with Urliac barbarians, all the while standing idle and doing nothing. 

The line isn't even clear on Russia's side. We all saw the local pro-Russian troops bullshit rhetoric and how quickly the world ate it up. The real situation looks like that second image. And Russia right now is past the halfway point, past the magenta (?) and into the violet. When does that violet become blue? If local pro-Russian personnel declares part of Estonia independent does NATO attack? If amphibious troops with Russian weapons and gear start appearing in the Danube Delta does NATO attack? If Moldova gets invaded, which would inevitably cause a direct Romanian-Russian war within a week and the precedent of NATO citizens being killed by Russian troops is set, does NATO attack then? What if Finland and Sweden get attacked?

Upholding NATO should've started when Ukraine got invaded, right when Russia stepped into that area where red is no longer red, into that pink or whatever it is. Waiting for them to go past every hue of violet and definitively step on the blue, and being strangely proud of it too, is setting yourself up for either a) atrocious war, b) the dissolution of NATO by trading war for shame since Russia won't stop at second class members which would also lead to atrocious war, c) Putin smoking a bowl and calling Merkel up to talk about space for a bit before deciding to inexplicably turn back.

No. It would only help ensure it. Every other country gets by just fine.

What manpower?Certainly not hundreds of millions. You mean small token forces like we've seen in every conflict? And how would this manpower even get tot he US since none of these nations have any force projection capabilities?

&gt; Losing almost every firm military alliance they have wouldn't impact security? 

No, the US is the only one even remotely dedicated to these alliances. The so called allies refuse to even spend the smallest amount recommended.

&gt;Losing guarantee that the natural resources and industrial capacity of Europe would contribute to their side in a major conflict wouldn't affect their security?

That's hilarious.

A Soviet invasion of...Germany. Not the US and not for US security. The cold war is over and Russia isn't going to be invading Germany. As you said, the EU is such a massive powerhouse with ""hundreds of millions of soliders"" and ""vast natural lol resources"" that Russia wouldn't stand a chance.

&gt;They always do this, in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, even if they take the lead they always request manpower from other nations

And a few hundred Poles show up. Ok trilateral alliance with Poland and the UK. Everyone else can handle their own business.

* Small country so inadequate police force to deal with international crime rings, no point is further than 100km from a border for easy escape
* High immigration ratios from areas with mob activity that control some continent wide trades, so Calabrian, Sicilian, Albanian and some other Eastern European crime syndicates have a base of operations here, where they sometimes clash.

Yes I can. 

&gt; which translates as 'Did the president of the Ukraine have reasons not to sign the association agreement?

Which also translates (as in French and German) to ""Was the president of Ukraine right not to sign the association agreement""

&gt; I won't speculate as to why they posed the question like this, but they did.

Because that's how you construct it in this language, same as in Bulgarian. 

&gt; Anyway, they also asked several other questions and the respondents also directly stated with 46-36 that they favored the EU over the Russian customs treaty.

Sure, this could mean they still want to get closer to the EU but not through this treaty.

&gt; Yeah, cause that's totally the EU's fault (which is trying to keep the Ukraine from insolvency) and has nothing to do with Russia literally invading part of their country, doubling gas prices and sending provocateurs into the industrial east disrupting the economy.

Except the EU has its own problems and we can't help Ukraine alone, we need a hand from Russia. But in his great wisdom, Barroso said that ['when we make bilteral deal, we don't need a trilateral deal'](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10482680/EU-will-not-accept-Russian-veto-says-Barroso.html)...

And let's remember that, although and corrupt politician, Yanukovych was a democratically elected one. He was pretty much considered as smelling funny but okay by the Western media...until he  refused to sign the treaty last year.

You could have solved this peacefully but noooo, the US had to violate international law once again by sending Nuland and McCain to interfere with another country's internal affairs. Can you imagine what would happen if Sergey Lavrov came down to distributing hotdogs to Occupy Wall Street protesters and scheming up plans for the next US presidential elections, by briefing the opposition ?

And of course, this has absolutly nothing to do with a geopolitical maneuver to surround Russia as recommended by Jimmy Carter's NS adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. NATO, who has no reason to continue existing since the USSR fall, is just barbecuing steaks in the Baltics and the US organize pillow-parties in Central Asia.

They are totally no talks of building an anti-missile shield in Europe that would prevent Russia from protecting itself from a pre-emptive strike.  

The Russian are just stuck in a Cold War mentality, and the American neo-cons just want to bring peace, just as they did in Irak who had WMDs, and the Americans[ have total control of the democracy in their country.](http://www.salon.com/2013/07/18/jimmy_carter_us_has_no_functioning_democracy_partner/)",0,1397159280,null,0,1397159476,0,cgp7fu2,t3_22otap,t1_cgp7fu2,t1_cgp56i4,null,1433298389,-4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-4

Ah yes, gone are the days when you'd see Russian troops seizing territory and hear rhetoric of reducing America to a nuclear wasteland.

&gt;In WWII those factories resources and manpower all came from America.

Now you're talking about the past, I meant present industrial capacity and only brought up WWII to mention the importance of industry.

I don't wanna get bogged down in more details so I'll just cut to the heart of the matter: NATO isn't just about right now, NATO is about America permanently being secure and in a world where every major conflict is guaranteed to go global and be extremely destructive the US is playing a game of ""Never be on the losing side ever"", forgoing something as fundamental as military alliances with friendly nations destroys that. They cannot fesibaly isolate themselves and expect to be secure, this is something they've followed since WWI. The Cold war involvement in Europe conforms to this, they could not allow Europe to fall to communism because a stronger soviet union would've been an existential threat to the US. Same reason they maintain the alliance, they're in a position where Russia has no feasible chance of beating them and no other European nation has reason to feel threatened or move against them and this situation is stable and sustainable and fuck if they're going to mess with that. Destroying that would pose no immediate threat but American foreign policy is playing the long game, that of a potential rival in Europe, of a potential rise of Russia, of a potential decline of US superiority, of a unified western response if China gets to rowdy.

NATO membership absolutely is a matter of US security, it creates a situation of a unfified western world, A Russia that has more trouble to act and a Europe that has no reason for aggression against the US. Right now none of these are genuine threats but the US isn't short sighted enough to just look at that and throw the alliance out.",0,1397159345,null,0,false,0,cgp7h0f,t3_22oagc,t1_cgp7h0f,t1_cgp6wzk,null,1433298406,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

The return to 2004 constitution had to be passed by Rada (happened) and signed into law by the president (didn't happen) for it to become law — a couple of dudes around a table don't have the power to enact laws. Hell, the whole constitutional hullabaloo happened because of that — a couple of dudes around a table don't have the power to change the constitution, even if they _are_ the constitutional court.

Edit: just fyi, his refusal to sign the law, i.e. his apparent unwillingness to fulfill his constitutional duties was what gave Rada the opportunity to get rid of him w/o actually needing to impeach him.

The fact is that Germany and France have less power than they ever had ever since the last Treaty which gives smaller members far more power than before. Voting in the Council is one member one vote and small countries can outvote any time they chose. That they don't is more to do with agreement with German policies on the whole.

Il ne faut pas oublier que l'école, surtout dans le supérieur, est la pour t'apprendre les méthodes de travail et comment t'en sortir dans les années à venir. Il y a toujours 3 technologies qui sortent le temps que tu en apprennes une, alors on t'apprends les bases et on t'aiguille sur le futur. C'est ce décalage qui m'a poussé à ne pas continuer d'études en informatique, puisque ce qui m'intéressait vraiment dans le programme était en M2 et que j'allais tout juste démarrer une L3. J'ai maitrisé la notion dans l'année grâce à mon poste, donc mon niveau 3 ans plus tard est supérieur à quelqu'un qui aurait fait ces 3 années, sur ce point précis bien sur.

Il ne faut pas oublier qu'on acquiert aussi d'autres compétences comme la gestion du stress, des enjeux réels (une mise en ligne d'un client n'est pas la même chose que rendre un projet à un prof, même si tu peux finir à 2h du mat dans les deux cas) ou des choses plus banales comme la formation client (pédagogie informatique) ou le travail dans une équipe qui n'est pas composé que de techniciens et n'ayant pas les mêmes notions techniques.

Je n'ai donc pas les mêmes lignes sur mon CV qu'un diplômé tout frais. Et c'est pour ça qu'on incite les étudiants à avoir des projets à coté pour se confronter à la réalité du métier.

Concerning the Financial Regulations, I already posted about this in another thread quoting [FLexit](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22oq38/london_banks_opposing_britain_exit_from_eu_see_uk/cgoxo06).

Ok, to concede to Mats that indeed the Norwegian Option is not that good - but - it is definitely better than the EU for the UK as per Boiling Frog. So why persist with the uncertainty of Brexit for a very modest improvement?

1. It's only modest economically and politically concerning the EU. Democratically it's monumental.
2. It's a transition arrangement during Article 50 negotiations (2 years), again as per FLexit. Global regulatory bodies are moving all the time and under an associated bloc of EEA/EFTA members with UK on board, this bloc will act successfully and productively according to these ongoing changes over a 5+ year timeframe and even longer possibly and that will ultimately with or without help and encouragement from the EU prove to be the best course for the UK to be on.

Edit: Here's the piece from FLexit:

&gt;*""Better access to global and regional standard-setting bodies compensates for the disadvantages of the ""Norway Option"". Nevertheless, the outcome is not optimal so we recommend putting down a marker for the complete renegotiation of the EEA Agreement, seeking to replace it with a free trade area centred on an expanded EFTA, plus agreements on political co-operation.""*

In Europe we tend to focus on practically or effectively ensuring that our citizens are free, i.e. having no real restrictions on them where as Americans tend to few liberty and freedom as being freed from state restriction but not effective restrictions. The European model generally also tends to be much more pro-education from a liberal perspective in than the USA. For instance UK universities only charge a third of what the USA costs, despite having the highest tuition fees in Europe and we have a very extensive loan system which is *extremely* forgiving.

We keep bleeding tax money outside of the country and the balance sheets pretty clearly say we can't keep this shit up.  The Pentagon even knows this quite well and has been making some fairly serious cuts to their budget.  If we are worried about scientific progress then we should at least take all of this military money and just repurpose it to our higher educational system.  We're already the laughing stock of Europe for our educational standards and prices.  A nice redirection of funds from military to peaceful purposes would do us well.

And your last sentence is notable.  You want the US to be powerful but you want it in a way that suits your needs.  That's not really how it works.  If you give tons of power to people it will corrupt them.  To expect the leaders in Congress, the White House, and the Pentagon to stay inside of the boundaries that weaker nations drew is naïve.  We've shown that quite clearly over the last 50 years or so.  If the US will continue to grow its sphere of influence things like Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, etc. will continue to happen.  Not because the population wants it to but because people with lots of power always want more.

Why can't we have a North American House of Representatives and a North American Senate? Mexico and the United States would dominate the Lower House, but Canada would have a large voice in the Senate, much more so than Luxembourg or Ireland do in the European Union. 

And if we're all one entirety, much of Northern USA is very similar to Canada politically and culturally, thus increasing the Canadian-leaning Voting Bloc, an the same goes for Mexico and the American Southwest.

The European Union **as it is today** was unthinkable 20-30 years ago. Why is a North American Union impossible in retrospect?

Clear as daylight.

Er, bullshit. The European Communities was a political union (as was the EEC, really), by nature. It offered a single market, and so inherently meant a federal law system.

&gt; 3) If the Treaty of Lisbon was suggested today (assuming it had not already been passed) the UK Gov would be required by law to hold a referendum. That is how big an issue it is, because of it the need for a referendum was put into law. any further steps will require referendum although many still think we should rectoactivly hold one for the Treaty of Lisbon.

Right.

I'd like to point out that the Lisbon treaty changed very little. It made the EU more democratic by giving the Parliament more power and made more decisions be done by majority vote instead of unanimity, due to the sheer practical implications of the 2004 expansion.

Although, **personally**, I think it'd be easier convincing your country and Mexico to join the United States with the motivation of transforming the country into something completely different through your new-found influence in the legislature *(you'd get like 16 Senators and Mexico a shitload of Representatives....probably twice as many Senators as you too...which poses a whole new set of problems bah)*....but like I mentioned above about how prideful Canadians are about *not* being America...it's ugh.....not that much more likely of a solution in relation to America dissolving it's government.....

&gt;I'd like to point out that the Lisbon treaty changed very little. It made the EU more democratic by giving the Parliament more power and made more decisions be done by majority vote instead of unanimity, due to the sheer practical implications of the 2004 expansion. How, exactly, is this a bad thing? It hasn't changed the substances of the EU. Not at all.

&gt;It said ""aims"", not ""substance"".

The UK joined under the impression those were the aims of the EEC, it is clear that these are not the only aims of the EU. The EEC is not the EU.

&gt;Because for it to be a single market, there have to be uniform laws. Otherwise, it is a mere customs union. Hence, federalism.

No, agreeing to a freetrade area with a few common regulations does not infer a federal government.

&gt;Previous gas crises between Russia, Ukraine and Europe came in the dead of winter, when gas demand was at its highest; today's crisis is unfolding after an unseasonably warm winter and with spring already here. That means that Europe has natural gas in storage, and natural gas demand will remain low for the next six months.

&gt;What's more, Pascual noted, the last crisis prodded Europe to take steps to make its energy markets more resilient to sudden supply shocks. ""After 2009, the European Union went into hyperdrive"" to reform its natural gas markets, he said. That includes making it easier for European countries to ship gas to each other in times of need, an issue that has come to the forefront in the current showdown between Moscow and Kiev.

&gt;Countries such as Hungary and Poland can already ship small amounts of natural gas to Ukraine, or about enough to meet seven percent of Ukraine's annual demand, or about 25 percent of its lower summertime demand. Reversing pipeline flows from Slovakia to Ukraine would add twice that amount -- but would also require the construction of a new pipeline, because Gazprom has bought transit rights on the main Slovak pipeline for years to come.

&gt;Given seasonally low demand for gas, relatively healthy gas storage levels, and the possibility of importing some additional gas from alternative suppliers such as Norway and Algeria, some believe Europe is actually well placed to turn the energy weapon around on Russia by halting its purchases of Russian gas. That would put severe pressure on Moscow, which is reliant on gas and oil exports for more than half of its federal budget.

&gt;""If Russia moves into eastern Ukraine now, Brussels should impose an embargo right away,"" Korchemkin said. ""The closer it gets to the winter, the more painful the gas embargo would be for the EU,"" he said, estimating that Gazprom and the Russian government could wind up losing $100 million a day.

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"Mate, I don't know what to tell you except that the author of that 'blog' is batshit crazy bonkers librarian-poo. The author of the blog makes the most convoluted and tangential connections between ideas, fills them with prattle, irrelevancies, and poorly thought out conclusions, and presents the mess as the paragon of intellectual achievement. In reality, it is absolute, and utter, garbage. 

Let's take a peek:

His first argument is that Mats has been corrected many times, however his only support of this is in his first self reference under the hyperlink *corrected many times*, which leads to the first blog post entitled 'Openingly lying Europe'. In it, he makes absolutely zero arguments to support his conclusions. His one complaint is over a poorly worded paragraph. He does, however, link to another blog post of his [here](http://thefrogsalittlehot.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/dark-forces.html) which has some of the worst argumentation I think I've ever seen in my life.

Firstly;

&gt;Open Europe is a so-called think tank that is often considered by the media as Europsceptic and as a consequence its reports and statements are treated accordingly. However anyone who considers facts more important than a 'narrative' can very quickly come to the conclusion that it is anything but - just read its 'about page'. More proof is found in the latest Telegragh article by Mats Persson, his description being (my emphasis):
Mats Persson is Director of Open Europe, an independent think-tank with offices in London and Brussels campaigning for EU reform.

None of this supports the premise of his argument. First, how is it a 'so-called' think tank? It clearly is a think tank. Second, he argues that is it incorrectly called 'Europsceptic' [sic] because *it campaigns for EU reform*. Last time I checked, wanting to exit the EU is not the be-all, end-all of euroscepticism, there is also repatriating powers back to the member states, and many other shades of grey. But moving on from this terrible start.

&gt;The article goes on to lavishly dollop praise onto Cameron as a Europsceptic, for example:
*Cameron has therefore upped the game*
That anyone could consider Cameron as a Eurosceptic, when the evidence is firmly the opposite, is someone who has attended too many Christmas parties. Mats Persson reveals his true colours. Yet, almost like Jimmy Savile, he hides his deception in plain sight. 

Nowhere was the claim made the Cameron wasn't pro-EU. But this moron felt the need to argue against it anyway, nor does it state he is a eurosceptic. In fact, in the opening paragraph of the article the blog author is referring to, he even quotes Cameron saying 

&gt;David Cameron yesterday let slip – for the first time – that he considers a future for the UK outside the EU ""imaginable"". 

So far, we have two terribly argued contentions that simply have no grounding in reality.

&gt;Thus he supports Cameron (my emphasis: 
*It's increasingly difficult for him not to frame the issue as a choice between ""renegotiation or Brixit"" (as opposed to the status quo and Brixit or status quo or renegotiation).*
I can only assume by 'status quo and Brixit' he means leaving the EU but remaining part of the single market. How revealing that this is an option he clearly does not support. 

It's quite clear that Mats was showing that 'renegotiation or brexit' should not be the only thing in the debate, that it could also be 'status quo or brexit' or 'status quot or renegotiation'. But the blog author (I'm gonna start calling him BoilingFrog now) doesn't give a shit because he's on an ideological crusade to destroy whatever imaginary arguments he can come up with, a true Don Quixote charging at wind mills. 

&gt;Well yes it is when your game is to try to deceive people on your true intentions, but the key paragraph is this...
*Fortunately for Cameron, the UK achieved a substantial victory last week in Europe, winning a safeguard against the 17 eurozone members writing the financial rules for all 27 EU members in the soon-to-be-established banking union. This is vital as Britain is home to 36 per cent of the EU’s wholesale finance market. Inbuilt discrimination against non-euro countries in the EU in this area would amount to “not in the euro but run by the euro” for the UK, meaning both the single market and the case for the UK’s continued EU membership would be severely undermined (as the UK would  be ""governed by fax"" – a la Norway – anyway).*
Spot what he did?

&gt;The argument put forward is Cameron achieved 'a real victory' by winning safeguards, with the UK being in the EU. But Persson claims if Cameron didn't achieve that victory (as EU members), then Persson argues we would end up like Norway and its government by fax...even within the EU. But Norway aren't part of the EU. Persson has quite deliberately confused membership of the EU, EEA and a combination of the two, so in effect comparing oranges with apples, all to get his 'government by fax' point in.

This is the most bizarre and batshit crazy point he has. Mats argued that if the UK had not been able to achieve the safeguards, the UK would have been subject to banking union regulation run by the Eurozone thanks to the key sentence **Inbuilt discrimination against non-euro countries in the EU in this area would amount to “not in the euro but run by the euro” for the UK**. This is how he meant it would be like fax diplomacy. BoilingFrog is simply fucking moronic in this argument, so he has in no way destroyed Mats credibility. 

Returning now to the article you linked, 'Openingly lying about Europe (2)', which should be 'Openly', but it seems he's as bad with his vocab as with his argumentation, he writes a complaint to the press council. The first part, I've covered above, the second part however;

&gt;Mats Persson's argument relies heavily on the false doctrine that Norway has ""no influence"" in making EU law. However this is simply factually untrue, Norway has more influence than the UK regarding Single Market rules as illustrated below:

&gt; Many of Single Market laws are made at an international level for example the WTO – Norway gets to represent itself while the UK has only 8% influence with the EU which represents us on our behalf. 

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, a thousand times, no. The UK has dual representation under the WTO, as itself (the UK) and through the EU. I'm not kidding, look it up, *both* have representation at the WTO and equal weight in negotiations.

&gt;Norway is also on over 200 EEA (Single Market) committees which influence EU law from the outset –Anne Tvinnereim, former State Secretary for the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development in Norway for example said this: “we do get to influence the position"". 

Influence, yes. But they have absolutely no *decision making power*. I can influence my government as well by calling up an MP and telling him what I'd like him to do, it doesn't mean he'll do it.

&gt;Norway can then contest that laws don’t apply to their EEA agreement – currently they have over 1,200 in dispute.

OK? How is this an argument that Norway has more influence in the EEA than the UK? It's not. It's as simple as that, it's just not. These laws will eventually pass through the dispute resolution mechanism one way or another. The UK *has considerably more power than that given it has a vote, and is privy to, these negotiations*.

&gt;Ultimately Norway can veto any EU legislation, as they did with the 3rd EU Postal Directive while the UK had no choice but to implement it by the 2011 Postal Services Act.

Norway [promised to impose them](http://www.euractiv.com/innovation-enterprise/norways-government-promises-redu-news-531759) in the end. In fact, the cost to Norway of [not imposing them](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmfaff/writev/futunion/feu01.htm) (check out point 9) would have been very high. It was only because the EU was patient enough in dealing with them that they didn't face the nuclear option.

&gt;The Lisbon Treaty and Article 50 is covered by international law, notably by Article 54 of the Vienna Convention on the Law on Treaties, for the EU – an international organisation - to block market access would be in fundamental breach of international law. The EU would be obliged to adhere by its international Treaty agreements.

This is factually wrong. Mats specifically mentioned trade in services, which only have a framework for operation under the WTO and do not forbid a country from blocking access. If it were denying market access to goods, BoilingFrog would be absolutely right, but it was only services that were mentioned.

true,Purple10tacle,null,null,"German here, US wife. We travel to the US frequently and have been doing so for over a decade. Being married now, I get to wait in the same line as my wife, so this is my experience from before that time:

It isn't a pleasant feeling for non-citizens and the entire process is designed to be intimidating. I fully understand your girlfriend's fear, it isn't irrational, it's just the natural end result of this process.

Additionally, as a foreign national she has nearly zero rights when entering the US. Her belongings and herself can be searched at will. She has no right to a lawyer at any point in this process, she has no right for a phone call to inform you or her family if something goes wrong and she can be detained and/or shipped back to her home country at her own expense without ever seeing a judge or court.

Fear is a perfectly adequate reaction to this inhumane system.

At the same time she has to understand: while terrifying things *could* happen to her, absolutely none of them actually *will* happen to her.

I assume she already has all of her paperwork in order (first and foremost ESTA). A print-out is not necessary or would serve any kind of purpose, but helps to calm nerves anyways.

Arriving in the U.S. you and her will have to stand in separate lines. Hers will be significantly longer and move significantly slower.

There will be huge, intimidating signs telling her what to do and what not to do.

After finally arriving at the beginning of the line one of the half dozen officers will bark at her and she'll hopefully approach the correct terminal. This officer *will not smile* no matter how charming/confused/afraid/helpless/tired/sad she may be.

She'll present her passport and customs form, the officer will examine them for a while in silence, generally for just the right amount of time to make her feel totally uncomfortable. He'll command her to use the fingerprint scanner and look at the camera to record some biometric data that will be stored indefinitely and used for god knows what.

Then the officer will continue to bark, with as little empathy as humanely possible, some more questions at her:

""What's the purpose of your stay?""

Acceptable answers would: ""Vacation with my boyfriend"" (this may lead to the follow up question where this boyfriend is at which point she'll vaguely point in your direction and tell him that he is a US citizen) or ""Visiting friends and family"".

""Where are you going to stay?""

The officer wants a single location here, basically the first place your are going to spend the night, i.e. ""The Best Western in XYZ"" or ""My boyfriend's family in ZYX"" - this has to match any answer given previously to this question (the same is true for all questions, really)

""How long are you planning to stay?""

[x] weeks, until [date on the departure ticket]

Additional questions may be: ""Who is traveling with you?"" - My boyfriend, ""Who will you be visiting?"" -&gt; My boyfriend's family - ""Is this your first visit to the United States?"" or ""How often do you come to the United States?"" - Yes, first time / It's my first time.

Less likely for a short stay: ""How much money are you bringing?"" - answer honestly with a rough estimate (e.g. ""$800 in cash and some credit cards""), it will almost certainly be the amount the officer is looking for (enough to pay for her stay, but less than what she would have to declare to customs).

At this time, and if all of her answers match the ones already given previously (e.g. via ESTA) he'll be satisfied and his voice and demeanor will change dramatically.

That's when she'll most likely be presented with a big, slightly fake smile by the same officer who had just treated her like the state's worst enemy over the last minute or two. He'll hand her paperwork back and welcome her to United States, home of the free.

She'll walk through the gates, relieved and beaten at the same time. She'll see you and hug you.

You'll get Taco Bell on the way to your first destination. She'll spend the rest of the night on the shitter ...

Take a look at where the largest banks in the world are. Ill give you a hint, 5 are in the European Union, 1 is in the US, coming in at 7th place. France's two largest banks *each* have assets roughly equal to the entire economy of France.

If you dont think the finance sector has power in the EU, look to Japan. As part of the program to get their economy jump started they looked both at US and EU securities laws. They were evaluating them to see which jurisdictions they would allow to automatically list in Japan. Given SEC requirements are already more stringent than Japanese, they decided to allow any SEC approved listing to dual list in Tokyo. 

Despite evaluating EU securities regulations, they declined to extend the same courtesy to EU securities. The rules are too lax, and companies can structure their listings to avoid the bulk of disclosures that are mandatory under US or Japanese law.

China doesn't fear Taiwan saying it's the *rightful leader* of China, it fears Taiwan saying *it's not China*. It fears a independent Taiwan, not a exile Chinese government, because once a independent Taiwan gets on the picture instead of a government-in-exile, China loses all claim to Taiwan.

IIRC, this was the essence of the Taiwan Strait Crisis in the 90s. A Taiwan that forfeits it's claim to China also forfeits China's claim to Taiwan.

My nation's going alright fiscally but we're still pulling less GDP per capita than the US and we're still reeling from an economical collapse, but let's go into your theory that it's the military expenditure that's causing these hardships for you.

I highly doubt it's the military situation is what's causing these problems, it might be making them worse but to play them as the root doesn't sound right. Consider that the US spends 4% of its GDP on military expenditure. Most of the European allies are somewhere around 1%, some like France and Britain at 2%. Now consider that the GDP of America and the whole of the EU is about the same. Does it really sound that likely that having 96% of its GDP to spend on ""Non-military things"" is what's causing all these problems in the US while having 98% of the budget to spend on ""non-military things"" makes Britain and France capable of all the extravagant social programs they can think of? I don't deny that this missing 2% is probably a factor but you seem to be overemphasising it. You could argue that previous expenditure is what put you over the limit but US public debt [isn't significantly higher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Public_debt_percent_gdp_world_map.PNG) that any of the European allies. Whatever the reason is for the debt the two regions have comparable debt and comparable GDP

Also consider that the US spends 17.7% of its GPD on health care. This not only far exceeds any of the European allies, most of them not exceeding 11%, it's probably the highest amount of money spent on a single health care system in the world and by far the highest per capita. How are problems in health care because of military expenditure? My own country is at 9% and our healthcare is universal. We're spending far less money per head on health care than you. We have problems because of this, doctors leaving for better pay elsewhere, but healthcare remains universal.

Regarding tuition, consider my own country whose economy imploded and debt rose to over 100% of GDP and the government was force to implement austerity measures and whole fortunes disappeared overnight. Even in the face of that hardship my university tuition remained at about $500 per year. Was that because we used to have a couple of American fighter jets stationed here or do you think there's something else at work here? Like the far higher taxes we ask our citizens to pay to fund these Universities?

And pension problems...every single western nation faces pension problems, people are having fewer kids and the population is getting older. It's a compounding problem everywhere though I don't have enough knowledge to comment on this beyond that.

Again, not denying that it's a factor in your problems but the play it of as the cause doesn't hold up to any critical examination. ",0,1397177718,null,0,false,0,cgpfqzq,t3_22oagc,t1_cgpfqzq,t1_cgpes5s,null,1433302373,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Bloodysneeze,null,null,"&gt; I highly doubt it's the military situation is what's causing these problems, it might be making them worse but to play them as the root doesn't sound right. Consider that the US spends 4% of its GDP on military expenditure. Most of the European allies are somewhere around 1%, some like France and Britain at 2%. Now consider that the GDP of America and the whole of the EU is about the same. Does it really sound that likely that having 96% of its GDP to spend on ""Non-military things"" is what's causing all these problems in the US while having 98% of the budget to spend on ""non-military things"" makes Britain and France capable of all the extravagant social programs they can think of? I don't deny that this missing 2% is probably a factor but you seem to be overemphasising it. You could argue that previous expenditure is what put you over the limit but US public debt isn't significantly higher that any of the European allies. Whatever the reason is for the debt the two regions have comparable debt and comparable GDP

It seems your conflating % of GDP with % of government budget.  The government only gets about 18% of the GDP as a budget.

Also, from this graph you can see how much worse our budget is getting eaten up by defense spending.  And this doesn't count state spending on the national guard.  https://lh3.ggpht.com/-CtQwznWZFTg/UmqAdcTzuvI/AAAAAAAACdw/CLZQtn9WESc/s1600/defence+spending.jpg

And I guess I don't know how much you pay in taxes but I'll make an estimate for me so you can compare.  I pay about 25% of income to federal taxes, another 8% or so to the state, another 6% to property taxes, 7% to sales tax, probably a percent or so in fuel tax, and some various others that probably don't add up to much.  So at the end of the day I give the government around 48-50% of my income.  Remember, when you live in the US you pay a tax to the US government and your state government so income tax rates are misleading.

And I get your point about your spending on healthcare and university.  However, the fact is that we are already in pretty severe debt that cannot be bailed out by anyone.  Adding more spending to the situation to fix it isn't really in the cards.  Also, the % spending on healthcare is mostly private spending since our healthcare is only universal for people above 65 so counting that as government budget is misleading.",0,1397180180,null,0,false,0,cgpgs99,t3_22oagc,t1_cgpgs99,t1_cgpfqzq,null,1433303796,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

[caption in the beginning]: tricks of Russian propaganda. the same person is portrayed first as a ""Maidan mercenary"", then as a ""victim"" of pro-Maidan people.

[text] report 1: ""Maidan mercenary"" (NTV Channel):

[anchor] A sensational confession of a German citizen, who was injured several days ago at the Mykolaiv state administration building. In conversation with our reporters, he explained the purpose of his visit to Ukraine: the visitor from abroad was preparing a group of 50 people for violent action, and all members of this group are citizens of western Europe. The payment was made by him personally before entering the battle stage [not sure what they mean]. Meanwhile, he himself is only a middleman in a complicated financial scheme. The mercenary refused to say who is behind it. 

[dude]: First of all, I brought money for Maidan, for a camp, from Germany.

[""journalist""] How much, if it's not a secret?

[dude] 500 000 euros.[cut] I bought 50 sets of clothing/gear, or rather I ordered them. I paid for the order, it should have been ready in a week, in your ""Voentorg"" [military surplus store]. I wanted it to be civilized, so that it would be more akin to [zarnitsa](http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0_(%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0\)) [some kind of Soviet imitation military game for boyscouts, I dunno]. Like that, somehow, in a sincere manner [don't worry, it makes little sense in Russian too].

[anchor] The man who is currently under guard [protection] in the hospital was on the side of Right Sector. The main purpose of his group was to maim as many *peaceful* protesters as possible [his careful emphasis], so that they could not continue their protests. Once in the hospital, the German citizen refused a translator and reported that his name is Andrei, in 1992 he left Ukraine for Germany. He also admitted that he is a citizen of *several* countries. Watch the full interview with this mercenary tonight on our channel.

[text] report 2. ""Victim of Maidan"", Rossiya channel:

Today it has become understood that an attack on federalization supporters in Mykolaiv did not occur without participation of the government. Footage has been released on which it can be seen that the Right Sector militants were brought into town on buses which were accompanied by the military. 
[woman anchor] Radicals were armed and the police was following their orders. Anton Lyadov with details:

[our NTV friend ""from Germany""] they shot the entire magazine, 16 bullets, because they shot without stopping.

[correspondent] Concussion, severe shin bone fracture, and a facial burn with necrosis: 40 year old Andrei Petkov won't be able to walk for six months. Now he's getting prepped for surgery. On April 7, Andrei came to the central square as he usually does, to openly express his dissatisfaction with the actions of the new government. But a peaceful protest was unexpectedly swarmed by radicals who started wreaking real carnage [don't know how to translate бойня better].

[Andrei, previously from Germany]: When I lay on the ground he puts [something] against my temple and says 'I'm going to kill you, take off [the ribbon of St. George](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon_of_Saint_George)', I say 'No way, go ahead and shoot', and then girls ran toward us, kicked him and he rolled away.

I think one shouldn't underestimate the ruthlessness of the leading elements inside the EU.

*glad if someone could help with the missing part 1:13:50*


Here it is explicitly stating EU is a ruthless organization, top down controlled as a fascist(implied) organization, which accepts far right cooperation to fulfill its, I assume what is meant are direct capitalist ambitions.


I have no love for fascists nor greed, but something doesn't add up here.


&gt; It's the same for Hitlers new Europe and Maastricht's unified Europe.
The plan is not the same of course.
The EU is far more modest. That's the main difference.
But the basic directions are in a subtle way the same.
Disdaining labor cost and accumulating capital.


So the EU is a modest subtle Hitler without the same plan? Why is there even a mention of Hitler if it's NOT AT ALL the same?

Could it instead be ""Hitler"" is being used as a propaganda buzzword to paint the EU in a bad light, just like the whole video has been reiterating over and over how capitalists equal Nazis? Bingo.


This is getting ridiculous but the aim of the video is clarifying.


&gt; If, for example, the big German capital has to choose between the mark and the euro or the Wehrmacht, it will choose the euro, as it will not have to conquer Greece, while the Wehrmacht will have to do it.


Now we have a statement saying modern German capitalist interests would invade Greece militarily if they couldn't use the EU/euro to do it easier, as they are doing now... as in invading Greece with the euro? What?


I'm a vehement anti-capitalist but this is simply indoctrination by far left socialist groups.
It is edited to seem legitimate for the average bohemian social-liberals, mixing in an artist POV for the whole video while painting an unrealistic picture of how Germany/EU(and the capitalist west) equals Nazism/Fascism(implied) through capitalist proxy.


It then ends in praise for antifascist violence, showing its true motivation, 'join the ranks to bust some fascist heads', just like true fascists would do.


TL;DR

The 'immoral' of the story of the video is how modern capitalism apparently equals Nazism/Fascism, EU starring as Hitler, Germany is invading Greece/the planet with his loyal side kick, the Wehrmacht euro.

Is the EU too heavily involved in capitalist ideals? I think so, but this video isn't an unbiased report on much of anything other than some history on the subject with then wild accusations on top of it.

Yes, fascism is horrible, unhinged capitalism is bad, but this video is pure propaganda, be aware.

But honestly, I don't think EE would be worth a war for the west. And I don't think a war is going to happen anyhow - it'll be done through annexation or other means like that - just like before world war 2 or how it was done to Crimea/Georgia.

I think that if NATO AND the EU countries didn't respond to an invasion of Estonia it wouldn't actually break much.

What confused you most was the similarity of the letters s, f and k. I'm guessing it was a Fraktur font, and the lower-case k looks sort of like an l with twiddly bits at the top.

The lower-case s came in two different forms: the familiar round s, and a so called ""long s"", which looks like this: ſ -- like an f but without the horizontal stroke. In general (it's bit complicated), ""s"" was written if it came at the end of a syllable, ""ſ"" in all other positions: so where you've written ""des Wunfches"", the original would have been ""des Wunſches"" -- in modern style ""des Wunsches"".

true,olddoc,BELG,Belgium,"No sweat. A good red wine now and then is what keeps us sane :-)    
Here's how I would break it into pieces:     
    
1. Cultural boundaries in Europe are blurry. *Illustration a*: The Flemish dialect of Belgians living near Germany uses German words such as ""uns"" or ""euch"". The further you move away from that border, the lower the German influence.     
*Illustration b*: Read [Elias Canetti's biography](http://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Elias-Canetti/dp/0374199507#reader_0374199507) (go to page 6 of the book, the section that starts with ""Family Pride""): ""Ruschuk, on the lower Danube, where I came into the world, was a marvelous city."" Canetti describes Bulgarians, Turks, Sephardi Jews, Greeks, Albanians, Armenians, Gypsies, Rumanians and Russians living together in a city that used to be Ottoman.     
    
2. If these boundaries are blurry, Huntington's thesis is just drawing a neat, comforting dividing line between civilisations where there isn't any if you go and look at the facts on the ground. He creates a black and white contrast where there's actually grey. It's similar to the effect of the [distinction bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinction_bias): you see a greater contrast between two things than there actually is.     
    
3. But... Huntington's thesis might be true if European governments took centralizing decisions that destroyed the blurriness.     
*Illustration*:  Only one religion is elevated to the state religion. Look at the sharp line he draws between Russia and Finland. If what I say in point 1 above is correct, there should be a gradual blur between Orthodox and Lutheran Christianity. But there's only [1% Orthodox Christians in Finland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Finland).    
    
4. Conclusion. Huntington could be accused of seeing order where there's chaos, because he zooms out far away from the fluid details that you see close by. **But** Huntington's world could be real, even if you look close up, because of all the efforts modern nation states made in ensuring there is, for example ...      
=&gt; ... only one official language taught in schools (a nice example is the elevation of a subcategory of French speech that was only spoken to the south of Paris to the status of ""Official French"", with its efforts of [""unification, regulation and purification""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_French#Modern_French);    
=&gt; ... only one religion accepted as the state religion (France again, with [its purge of Protestantism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Fontainebleau));    
=&gt; ... the thousands of little laws that are valid within one country, but not the neighbouring one, and that gradually create a legal rift between what used to be blurry. ",0,1397198539,null,0,false,0,cgpn2nf,t3_22p1s9,t1_cgpn2nf,t1_cgp95h6,null,1433306759,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

I think that this is highly relative. Do they always (except when driving to or from the shooting range or out hunting) keep their guns in either 

a) A +400lbs heavy safe.

b) A somewhat lighter safe that is instead bolted to the ground.

Is this regularly (by-yearly at random) controlled by police by house visits?

They follow their line in international politics but they are generally not hostile to Iran. They have no influence outside of their country and nor are they capable of having any. Besides they can barely feed their people let alone take on a nuclear project.

Saudi Arabia on the other hand is more sinister. The oil wealth comes from regions in Saudi Arabia where Shias live. The Saudis secure their throne by marginalising Shias and demonising them to the rest of the population. That way people will forget how shit, corrupt, useless and unIslamic the royal family is. They hate Iran because Iran overthrew an unpopular monarch who cared more about what western governments wanted than his own people. Exactly like Saudi Arabia. However these guys are running a banana republic. Unlike Iran which has an industrial base and a scientific community they are nothing more than consumers of what others produce. Their only leverage is money. There has been talk of them buying nuclear weapons from Pakistan but no matter how bad Pakistani governments are, they aren't stupid enough to allow the Saudis access to those weapons.

Peccato che le scosse continue e ripetute NON costituiscano una situazione di potenziale pericolo. Questa è un'invenzione totalmente pseudoscientifica della sentenza.

Poi magari hanno compiuto irregolarità, ma è secondario. Il punto è che hanno proceduto, a livello di comunicazione, esattamente nel modo corretto: il rischio è uguale al solito, tornate pure a casa. Hanno avuto sfiga.

You have a unique position being bi-lingual. You (in general) can read our gutter press, we (in general) can't read yours.. I'm sure if I had access to your newspapers in English I could find just as many occurrences of the French media badmouthing the British. 

I'm sure this is why we get such a bad name in Europe. A huge amount of the population of Europe can speak English as a second language, particularly people here on /r/europe since we're all conversing in English.. 

How many people in Europe speak Spanish, or German, or French, or Swedish as a second language? The cross over is much less.

Classifying them is to some degree merely an academic exercise. But I wouldn't call them great powers as their ability to project power on global scale is limited. They're both *regional powers* and *emerging powers*.

What sets China apart and puts it ahead of Russia is for example economy. Russia has remained at the level of exporting resources with very little industrial products, and the industry Russia has is not that advanced. Russia for example doesn't have a single factory producing integrated circuits.

China has heavily invested to modern industrial production since the 80s, and has become a big exporter of advanced industrial goods and high tech.

I could provide more angles on the Norway Option, but I think the above alone is solid enough as we've been down the former path enough. We can also dissect the the europhile's arguments as on the other side of the motion for Brexit:

* Labour/Liberal Democrats: Status Quo: Yet this is false: The power changes from 1975-2014 in volume prove this and they don't just happen per major treaty change. So actually you will only lead to ""Ever Closer Union"".
* Conservatives: Middle Way Fallacy:[The EU: Beyond Reform](http://www.ukipdaily.com/eu-beyond-reform/#.U0fHsKhdWVU)

1. First, few people expect Cameron to be Prime Minister after the General Election.
2. Second, no one in Brussels, or in the Chancelleries of Europe, believes there’s any hope of achieving a revised treaty (for that’s what it would take) by 2017 – or at all. The best he’ll get is a few cosmetic tweaks. Angela Merkel recently suggested that we might be allowed a little extra flexibility on the working time directive as it applies in the NHS (did we fight two World Wars to have a German Chancellor telling us what hours our doctors could work?).
3. And thirdly, Cameron has already broken a solemn promise to hold an EU referendum. No one believes him this time.
4. Finally, he’s thrown away his best negotiating card by announcing in advance that he will campaign “tooth and nail” to stay in – regardless of the outcome of the negotiations.

And remember we've been here before in 1975 with ""Common Market"" vs ""Ever Closer Union""; with token concessions for giving up our Fisheries...

The loss of Sovereignty was fully understood by the Establishment a full 5 years or so ahead of time on an ""unprecedented scale"" if joining the EEC. This was never communicated to the public and it was quote-unquote predicted that:

&gt;*""The public will not wake up to the fact for a full 30 years.""*

Let's jump in time again forwards to 1999: [The Death of Britain? [1999 prediction reviewed in 2014]](http://johnredwoodsdiary.com/2014/04/09/the-death-of-britain-2/)

All on the money. We managed better because we avoided the EURO thanks to George Soros!

&gt;*""” Labour’s constitutional blueprint is nothing more than a plan for the destruction of UK democracy. It threatens splits within the kingdom. It threatens transferring far too much out of democratic control. It gives far too much ground to the federal plan on the continent. It dares to do all these things in the name of democracy, when the result will be less.”* ~ John Redwood, MP: 1999.

All have been found to be true 15 years later. Correct prediction is irrefutable.

* UKIP would be wise to take the EEA - Norway Option and we come full circle to the validity and viability of that option where all measures indicate progress (see previous threads) compared to the Status Quo and The Middle Ground Fallacy.

I'm not surprised by this at all. A lot of Guardian readers are very pro-Russia and were always very pro-USSR back in the day. A lot of Guardian readers were very upset that communism fell in Eastern Europe and wish that the UK were socialist.

Also a lot of Guardian readers are extremely anti the US and also very anti the West generally. So when it comes to a clash between the US/West on the one hand and Russia on the other hand, they will always support Russia.

I don't think this is ""astro-turfing"", it is just the opinion of the Guardian readers.

true,YadilohTruc,UNSA,Florida,"Personally, I don't agree with Hezbollah, and I sure as fuck don't want to see them expand their influence in Lebanon &amp; Syria, but I must admit I begrudgingly respect them. 

The fact of the matter is, *they're not* Al-Qaeda or Al-Nusra, they're a completely different beast. Israel is the most competent, well-trained and effective military force on the planet *(in my opinion)*, so you're going to need the most competent, well-trained and effective guerrilla group on the planet to go toe-to-toe with them...which Hezbollah did.

An a lot of that probably comes from the fuck tonne of cash that Iran threw at them in their formative years, and more importantly, the Iranian Republican Guard special forces that trained them *(many of whom were experienced combat veterans who saw fighting in the Iran-Iraq War)*.  

They're also smart. They know not to push their claim in Lebanon because they're not strong enough yet; of course they want a Islamic Republic of Lebanon, but they're patient and willing to gather their strength; their moves are calculated. Al-Qaeda and Al-Nusra arn't; right off the bat they call all governments in Iraq &amp; the Levant as illegitimate and are immediately trying to set-up a caliphate. 

Hezbollah's organization in itself is also impeccable. Very secretive *(the paramilitary side, not the political side at least)*. Fighters and officers go to great lengths to keep their involvement in the organization secret; I remember reading a story that a girl didn't realize her own brother was in the organization until he died and the organization came and told her. Other groups are much more flashy and braggish. This is a necessity for Hezbollah though, because their main opponent is Israel, unlike the others, and as you may know, Mossad is one of the most effective and successful intelligence agencies on the planet *(Israel really is amazing for how much it punches above it's weight, hell, I would say that most of Hezbollah's skill comes not from itself, but from having to constantly adapt to Israel's successful and effective tactics....while still surviving and remaining intact/functional.....if that makes sense)*. 

But they lost any credibility as a legitimate political group from me the day they abandoned their stance on suicide bombings against civilians *(they had previously opposed it, but than allowed it after a bombing against Israeli civilians)*. 

Though...it's a double-edged sword...I respect them more...but for that same reason I see them as *a lot bigger threat* than any of the other Islamic terrorist groups.

true,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I agree. One of the things I find most irritating about the EU is the blinkered insistence on delineating what is and isn't ""Europe"", and therefore, who can be part of the club, and who will forever be excluded from it, no matter what they do. 

You can see it in here on conversations about Turkey. I guarantee you if Constantinople hadn't fallen ~600 years ago there would be no debate about whether Anatolia was part of ""Europe"" or not. But instead, the majority seem to think it's okay to say that yes, the Greeks are part of Europe, but no, the Turks are not. As if a few miles of water constituted a permanent and irrevocable barrier. They manage to hold that belief whilst simultaneously insisting that the UK is an *integral* part of Europe despite being separated by a watery barrier of approximately equal size. When you ask *why* people East of Greece (and South of Spain) are to be forever excluded you get stuff like:

&gt; ""Oh, they are so culturally different. They have different concerns.""

&gt; ""Yes, they are soooo culturally different.""

&gt; ""Yes, they could never be a part of Europe, because they are sooo different. Culturally.""

What the fuck does that even mean? ""Culturally different""? Does a few miles of water between Greece and Turkey become such an insurmountable problem that it means I can never have common citizenship with the person on the other side? Does that mean that I'm (as a Brit) supposed to have more in common ""Culturally"" with the average Greek than I do with the average Turk? Because in my experience, that isn't true. 

Having lived in Germany and in many Anglophone countries, I've found I have more in common ""culturally"" with the average Canadian, the average Aussie, and the average Kiwi, than I do with the average German. Does that then mean that the Germans are ""too culturally different"" for me to ever share a passport with one? If not, then why exclude people like the Turks on that basis?

I honestly think that the ""culturally different"" argument we see bandied about a lot, when applied to Turkey, and Russia and North Africa, for that matter, is in many cases simply a convenient smoke screen for xenophobia. And I think that future borders of the EU, as envisioned by a lot of the people driving it's growth, is an impoverished vision that will ultimately end up excluding tens of millions of people for no real reason other than fear.

true,fakoff,SVAK,Slovakia,"I hope this will be visible enough because I know people are not very well oriented in the current gas problem.

A family member works in SPP (national gas industry/supplier). The thing is: 4 pipes are used for gas transit through Slovakia to Western Europe, gas source is Russia of course. Some time ago there were 5, but one of them (called Brotherhood) is now unused. These 4 pipes are from Ukraine. There are other routes from Ukraine, through Poland and Hungary, all of them lead to the western and other parts of Europe.

Slovakia, just like many of eastern countries, is using Russian gas only. Europe has another huge source of gas, which is Norway. They drill in seas mostly.

Now, Russia denied Ukraine access to their gas because of huge debts they have. Maybe even if they would pay all of it, Russia wouldn't allow them to access the gas, we don't know that (politics). Ukraine now demands Slovakia to push gas through 2 of the pipes to opposite direction - back to Ukraine. It requires some special technology (sorry I have no idea) and of all the countries bordering Ukraine, Slovakia has much more capacity than Poland and Hungary for reverse flow. But because the 4 pipes don't end in Slovakia, but continue to western Europe, Slovakia profits from gas transit. Countries pay to Russia for gas, but they also pay us for gas transport. And it's tens of millions € a year. That means, we would have loss 50% of these money a year while pushing the gas back to Ukraine. Now, since the Ukraine has so huge debt for Russian gas, Slovak government is afraid that they would also not pay for our gas.

Then there's EU and USA(yeah...USA...) who force us to give the Ukraine our gas. And there's chance they won't be able to pay for that. Then there's Russia, who officially warned us, that they can cut the gas supply if we start to supply Ukraine. Great.

edit: edited for correction - other countries can supply Ukraine with gas too, but much less than Slovakia

Ukraine doesn't have much gas supplies and storing gas is not very easy to do. Gas is not stored in some tanks, or underground vaults. It's stored in soil. We can do it only in some parts of country, only in western part so there's chance Ukraine doesn't even have soils capable of holding pressurized gas.

Currently our prime minister agreed to supply Ukraine with our gas. I'm really looking forward what will happen now....",0,1397218214,null,0,1397230755,0,cgpqakl,t3_22rqv1,t1_cgpqakl,t3_22rqv1,null,1433308340,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Sauf qu'il y a d'autre création de richesse que celle qui conduit à un revenu : s'occuper d'enfants, faire de l'art, organiser une communauté, parler à des personnes âgées, militer en faveur des animaux, etc. On peut imaginer beaucoup qui rapporte du bonheur sans impliquer de consommation.

Bref, le paradigme actuel selon lequel seul le salariat ou l'entrepreneriat contre de l'argent permet de vivre c'est un peu trop étriqué... Reste à voir si on est capable de mettre autre chose en place.

I think your argument is in fact quit similar to Huntington's. If I understand you right you are saying that nation states (or political unions like the EU) can over time de-blur (or even create) cultural boundaries (via religion, language, law, etc.).


According to Huntington that is exactly what happened. 

He identifies the Roman Empire as the most formative cultural force in European history, projection it's vastly superior civilization (including Christianity) over a very, very long time and therefore leaving the deepest cultural imprints and borders. And those borders are still recognizable and relevant today.


ps. Huntington admits that those borders are blurry.

I don't like the article, either, especially not how it paints attempts to understand the Russian perspective as ""romanticizing"" (read: naive) as if trying to understand somebody else's position was ever a bad thing and would imply agreement (it doesn't).

Now, *this* attitude is something I don't understand, and out of the three comments so far yours is the second with this sentiment.

On being critical of the US: I do have different expectations when it gets to the US than I have in regards to Russia or, say, China, especially when human rights are concerned. Maybe this is because I'm romanticizing the US as the Land of the Free and Beacon of Liberty, perhaps based on a naive impression that we share a similar culture which leads me to apply European standards of social justice.

true,quantum-confinement,MOLD,Moldova,"I really enjoyed reading this report, it was very well-written and to the point. I also completely agree with its main conclusions/forecasts. Germany's overarching goal in this crisis appears to be to avoid further conflict with Russia and to stabilize the situation as soon as possible. In specific terms, this means accepting Ukraine's loss of Crimea, at least tacitly, and instead focusing on defusing the broader conflict between Ukraine and Russia. In this latter process, German leaders believe that Russia has legitimate security and political interests that must be accounted for, even if these are contrary to Ukraine's wishes. In other words, in light of geopolitical and practical realities, creating a stable new *status quo* in the East should be the cornerstone of Germany's relations to Ukraine and Russia, even if such a policy disadvantages the former or other states falling within Russia sphere of influence for that matter.


However, while I don't think this view is unreasonable, I do think it's shortsighted and rather skewed. First of all, in practical terms, there is an implicit assumption that Russia has certain specific legitimate interests and that if these are secured then Russia will likely step down. However, in light of Russia's unpredictable actions over the past few months, it seems naive to hope that rational considerations will automatically prevail. It's also unclear what Putin's ultimate vision for Russia's neighborhood truly is, it's likely that he himself has not finalized his views, but rather is reacting to changing circumstances. The risk is that instead of being content with its recent gains, Russia will simply continue to seek new vulnerabilities through which to consolidate its power, like a lighting sending leaders to probe the path of least resistance.

With this in mind, it seems that attempting to escape conflict by appeasing Putin holds the risk of simply deferring a subsequent, and possible more acute confrontation. I would prefer not to invoke Godwin's Law quite yet, but come on, how many times in history has an unscrupulous demagogue been allowed to push forward by accommodating opponents fearful of a conflict in the short run, only for the latter to finally face the choice of making concessions they were no longer willing to make or risk a major conflict. 

To return to Ukraine, I still believe that a strong response from the West, including some economic sanctions and threatening their escalation could have forestalled Russia's annexation of Crimea and could potentially have frozen the conflict at a much more manageable stage. Then Germany could have played the mediator all they wanted, for example by agreeing to a special status for Crimea within Ukraine in return for recognition on the part of Russia of the new government in Ukraine. Now achieving the same result in the short run appears simply unfathomable.

That's not the impression I got from their official statements at all. The very opposite. Here, this is my translation/summary of two of their statements:

----

[The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement of March 14](http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/newsline/6F745B0774C71C9644257C9B00362EB6) commented on the violence in Donetsk the night before. It was a pro-Kyiv demonstrator who was killed that night, by a pro-Russian mob, but you wouldn't have been able to tell from the Russian statement: 

&gt;On 13 March in Donetsk tragic events occurred, blood was shed. Right-radical gangs, armed with traumatic weapons and bats, which had assembled the evening before in the city from other regions of the country, attacked peaceful demonstrations who had come to the streets of the city to express their attitude to the destruction position of people calling themselves the Ukrainian government.
&gt;
&gt;We have repeatedly stated that those who have come to power in Kiev must disarm the fighters, guarantee the security of the population and the lawful right of people to hold rallies. Unfortunately, as events in Ukraine have shown, that is not happening, and the Kiev authorities are not controlling the situation in the country.
&gt;
&gt;Russia is aware of its responsibility for the life of its compatriots and fellow citizens in Ukraine and reserves the right to take people under protection.

Translation [from here](http://www.interpretermag.com/ukraine-liveblog-day-24-russia-mobilizes-near-the-border/#1203). The last sentence is key in seeing how Russia is reserving or preparing a rationale for a possible invasion. 

The next day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [went a step further still](http://www.mid.ru/brp_4.nsf/newsline/9F103B7F356223DF44257C9C004F9498). That day, its statement denounced the ""provocation against peaceful protesters"" the night before in Kharkiv (when a firefight broke out between pro-Russian demonstrators and Ukrainian nationalists and two pro-Russians were shot dead), and for good measure conjured up a convoy with ""armed mercenaries from the Right Sector"" allegedly being on its way from Kharkiv to Donetsk and Lugansk to ""open up an Eastern Front"". (I [tried, in vain](http://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/20hq7u/so_about_that_alleged_convoy_of_armed_mercenaries/) to get any kind of information or confirmation about this alleged convoy.) 

That statement ended with this sentence:

Dallo stesso articolo:

&gt; A meta-analysis of 30 clincal trials indicates that adding caffeine to an analgesic reduces the dosage needed of that analgesic agent to achieve equivalent analgesia by 40%. 

&gt; Caffeine dosages of more than 65 mg are necessary to reliably demonstrate statistically significant adjuvant analgesic effect.

Per l'aumento del rischio, cito l'articolo:

&gt; Among habitual caffeine users abrupt cessation results in a profound withdrawal syndrome that mimics migraine and includes prominent symptoms of severe headache, cognitive deficits, fatigue, depressed mood, nausea, myalgias, and rhinorrea.

Per cui se per mi dici che l'aumento di rischio è dovuto al fatto che l'astinenza provoca mal di testa e robe simili, ok. Ma è l'astinenza, non la molecola in sè. Hanno correlato un maggior uso di caffè con il mal di testa. Occhio che correlazione e rapporto causa-effetto son due cose diverse. Anche l'uso di aspirina è correlato con il mal di testa, ma è perchè uno la prende quando ha il mal di testa, non perchè l'aspirina dia direttamente mal di testa.

L'articolo stesso cita uno studio olandese in cui hanno mostrato che non c'è correlazione tra l'assunzione di caffeina e i giorni di mal di testa, peraltro, quindi la cosa resta combattuta.

Vikings
( 04.08.2014 - 09.28.2014 )

Admission prices

The sea and rivers of Europe were allied fleets of Viking ships between the ninth and twelfth centuries AD. These Men of the North crossed Europe from the cold lands of the north to the warm shores of the Mediterranean. First they expand to the coasts of the Baltic and the North Sea, then down to Scotland , England and Normandy. Later they face the great distances and incursions into southern Europe and inland Asia.

The Maritime Museum presents Vikings , produced jointly by the Statens Historiska Museet in Stockholm and Museumspartner . The show tells how the people of the North Men relationships with other communities and European cultures, the symbolism of his ships and his extraordinary and wonderful craftsmanship.

The scientific content of the exhibition is articulated around 400 original objects from the Statens Historiska Museet who have been exposed only in exceptional cases outside of Scandinavia . The exhibition is divided into eight areas that offer a careful and thorough overview of the various aspects of their culture : daily life , rituals and beliefs , mythology , craft and meaning , their boats The exhibition also features ... numerous interactive elements and multimedia productions , and has been very well received internationally.

What do we really know the people we call Vikings ?

Vikings were a people of soldiers , marauders , explorers , traders or farmers ? Beyond the myth and legend that we really know them?

The latest archaeological discoveries provide a new perspective on the analysis of Viking Age . The popular idea of pillaging Vikings , vicious helmet with horns has been replaced by a much more complex.

More than a thousand years the Viking culture was gradually developed and expanded and we now know as the Viking Age corresponds to a period of mythical Scandinavian towns that sits chronologically between 750 and 1100 AD, and is documented scientifically four continents.

Populations established in Scandinavia at the time of the Vikings were not a unified group of people , although many written sources refer to as "" Norman "" or "" Norse ."" Also , according to several specialists , used terms such as "" pagan "", "" barbaric "" or "" people of the north ."" By using the word "" Viking "" to describe all the Scandinavian culture is an invention of the modern era .",0,1397221283,null,0,false,0,cgpr2nz,t3_22rwg3,t1_cgpr2nz,t3_22rwg3,null,1433308708,1,false,Barcelona,t5_2qosg,1

Der Wissenschaftsbetrieb (*EDIT, danke /u/binaryhero für eine Präzisierung des Begriffs*) schreibt sich selbst auf die Fahnen offen und ehrlich zu sein. Wenn's denn nur so wäre:

Der Wissenschaftsbetrieb ist leider zu einem Geschäftsmodell verkommen (und ich hänge leider mitten drin). Auf der einen Seite muss man veröffentlichen, dass die Schwarte kracht (sonst gibt's kein Geld) auf der anderen Seite werden praktisch alle Papers in eine gewünschte Richtung manipuliert. Nicht das da gezielt Daten verfälscht werden oder Fehlschlüsse gezogen werden. Nein, das läuft viel subtiler:

z.B. hat man im Experiment eine Beobachtung gemacht die man noch nicht wirklich erklären kann; es gibt einige Hypothesen und Ideen dazu wie man das aufklären könnte; oder bei der Analyse der Daten ist man auf einen neuen Ansatz gestoßen, der bislang unbekannt war man aber noch keine Zeit hatte, das bis in alle Details durchzuexerzieren. Normalerweise (d.h. wenn man wissenschaftlich korrekt arbeiten würde), würde man das an's Ende der Veröffentlichung in den Abschnitt ""Outlook"" schreiben. Tut man aber nicht, weil, *dann könnten das ja andere Gruppen machen, die dann den Ruhm einheimsen…* Mich treibt das dermaßen auf die Palme. Es gibt nämlich durchaus Dinge bei denen es interessant wäre Forschung zu sehen, für die man aber selbst einfach keine Zeit oder Mittel hat, es anzugehen; anstatt das andere Gruppen der Sache auf den Grund gehen könnten, weil die Beobachtung und ein Arbeitsansatz veröffentlicht wurden passiert: Nichts.

Auf der anderen Seite führt der Veröffentlichungsdruck dazu, dass ziemlich viele Müll-Papers in die Welt geblasen werden. Jeder noch so kleine Furz wird zu 5 bis 10 Seiten aufgeblasen, einfach damit man irgendwo mit seinem Namen drauf steht. Ich persönlich fände es da viel ehrlicher, wenn Wissenschaftler statt dessen über ihre aus *öffentlichen* Geldern finanzierte Forschung *öffentlich* ein Blog führen würden; soz. eine öffentliches Laborbuch in der man interessante Beobachtungen der letzten Woche darlegt. Das müsste noch nicht mal Peer-Reviewed sein; wer wissenschaftlichen Müll bloggt verliert dann aben seinen Ruf. Das wäre wesentlich ehrlicher als mit viel Tamtam Papers zu schreiben und vor jeder Veröffentlichung einmal alle Hierachiestufen in der Arbeitsgruppe nach oben daran mitköcheln zu lassen.

Oh und Negativergebnisse haben noch viel weniger Chancen das die Welt davon erfährt (es sei denn, das Negativergebnis war von vornherein das Ziel der Forschung, aber dann ist das ja eigentlich ein Positivergebnis).",0,1397221298,null,0,1397247354,0,cgpr2u9,t3_22r8l6,t1_cgpr2u9,t3_22r8l6,null,1433308710,11,false,de,t5_22i0,11

The Linke used to be the PDS which is the follow-up party of the SED, the state party of the DDR. Many ""Ost-Nostaligiker"" are in that party and support Russia because of the great bonds the DDR had with Russia (in the DDR learning Russian was mandatory and so on). I'm disappointed too by it..

&gt; I was a little taken aback, where I was from we had some leftists prioritizing their opposition against NATO over that against Milosevic, but noone actually expressing support for Serbia.

Haha the Greens where even funnier. Joschka Fischer got boo'd and called a war mongerer for supporting the NATO as Milosevic was the actual war mongerer and even worse tried to kill the muslim minority.

A lot of shit needs to change with Israel, but they're incomparable to either Assad or Saud. 

And Syria has always been the epicentre of hostility ever since decolonization. That picture doesn't really go to prove otherwise. It's just the official representative of one nation meeting the official leader of another nation in a public setting.

From Estonia to Poland to Western Ukraine, countries and peoples were trampled over by both Germans and Russians in the Second World War, and they suffered as much as the Russians did. And just like the Russians drew the conclusion from that experience that they needed and deserved a safety buffer zone, those peoples rightly drew the conclusion that they weren't and shouldn't be part of any Great Power's buffer zone again.

Yalta is one of the key traumas here, proving that the Great Powers would gladly inflict massive suffering on them if it secured geopolitical stability. But those who inflicted all that suffering on them were Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. The resulting awareness is summed up by the tag line of a Baltic mailinglist I was subscribed to in the 90s: ""Nothing About Us / Without Us"".

Isn't it a little odd, and off, that Germans should feel that, historically, they owe it to Russia to be sensitive to its desire for a safety buffer zone - but not to be sensitive to the desires of all those peoples in between to never again be accorded or divided up, without their approval, to one or the other Great Power as ""buffer zone""? Shouldn't that be at least as much a historical debt?

What I'd like to ask all those who blame the current Ukrainian conflict on the West's arrogance of extending NATO and the EU so far East is this. When Lithuania or Poland or any such country wanted to join NATO, out of an all too understandably desire for a security guarantee of their own, what *should* the West have done, then? Say: ""no, thanks, you can't join ... we don't want to offend the Russians, you know, by promising you that we'll defend you if you're ever attacked by them""? How much more arrogant still would that have been? The decision of whether Ukraine, Latvia or Hungary joins NATO was or should be the decision of Ukrainians, Latvians and Hungarians. To play RISK over their heads by withholding that right to any of them in a kind of tacit geopolitical understanding with Russia would echo the worst WW2-era experiences they had. 

I can't understand how the same Germans who contritely refrain from taking an all too assertive stance against Russia because WW2 (""it's only understandable that Russia would want a buffer zone ... it was insensitive of us to expand NATO so far East ..."" et cetera), don't see how they're adding insult to injury to all those other peoples that suffered at their hands in that same war.",0,1397222457,null,0,false,0,cgprf1v,t3_22op4l,t1_cgprf1v,t1_cgoxerq,null,1433308871,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Arrivano nei laboratori le casse con i pezzi estratti, spesso fessurati. Per prima cosa vengono inzuppati di vinavil+acqua per consolidare quel che resta intero, poi vengono puliti con dei mini-martellini pneumatici, un lavoro noiosissimo.

Poi siccome non reggono il loro peso, solitamente si tagliano in due con una flex, si svuotano con una fresa, e si riempiono di tondini d'acciaio e poliuretano. Poi vengono richiusi e la fessura viene mimetizzata con resina epossidica e dipinta in acrilico. ~~Per maggior verosimiglianza~~ per andare incontro alle aspettative di chi lo compra, solitamente poi sporchi il tutto con vernice al quarzo ocra molto annacquata (washing), o dai un drybrush in bianco, tanto per evidenziare il dettaglio.

You're joking, right?

Is this not considered propaganda?

true,canteloupy,ZBSuisse,Suisse,"Malheureusement, je pense qu'il est à présent clair que les dirigeants des Etats n'ont plus aucun pouvoir sur la politique économique. Tou paraît dicté d'ailleurs. Un soubressaut a peut-être eu lieu lors du passage d'Obamacare, cependant rappelons nous qu'il s'agit d'un pis aller, un sparadrap sur une jambe de bois alors que ce qu'il fallait c'était le ""single payer healthcare"", la sécu à l'américaine.

En France aussi, on finit par faire passer la pilule de l'austérité. La relance, puis la rilance, puis la rigueur et le libéralisme. Il n'y a rien d'autre finalement qui paraît comme possible. Et ce n'est pas ""la faute"" à Obama, ou à Hollande, ou qui que ce soit. D'ailleurs, en Suisse, les votes en démocratie directe montrent que même le citoyen lambda a bien intégré la leçon. Les assurances chômage, ça encourage les fainéants, l'assurance maladie privée c'est le bien et le public c'est le mal, et le salaire minimum, on verra bien ce qu'il en pense le citoyen Suisse, mais ça m'étonnerait même pas que le message ""ça vous fera moins de jobs parce qu'on n'a pas trop envie de payer plus"" va être victorieux. Ca ne peut pas être une coïncidence que toutes sortes de gouvernements suivent ainsi la manoeuvre, plus ou moins volontairement, mais dans la même direction pour finir.

Les seuls qui font encore semblant qu'autre chose est possible sont ceux qui tirent leur épingle du jeu, l'extrême droite, qui a trouvé qu'il peut faire illusion en mélangeant une tonitruante attitude d'""internet tough guy"" qui ne demande qu'à en découdre et une savante utilisation de boucs émissaires (des vrais, les multinationales, contre lesquelles elle ne pourra rien faire, et des faux, les immigrés pauvres, contre lesquels il ne sert à rien de s'acharner). Mais arrivés au pouvoir, je ne doute pas que ça se lisse encore plus, sauf pour les aspects sociaux qui deviendront pire.

Bref, quand il y a des élections, je ne fais mon choix que sur les aspects sociaux et le discours humaniste. Lequel va monter les uns contre les autres dans des coups de comm' et de la petite vengeance de bas étage alors que la richesse se séquestre en haut et non en bas, par des mécanismes dont nous ignorons presque tout? Bah c'est celui que je choisis pas. Parce que ces mécanismes, peu importe ce que le candidat peut vociférer dans la presse, ils ne seront pas mis à pied sans refonte totale du système, ce qui n'est pas près d'arriver.

Par contre, les pauvres gens, mes frères à qui je souhaite de pouvoir faire leur ""pursuit of happiness"", ils vont certainement voir la différence. Et comme je n'ai pas envie de leur faire porter ce fardeau, je ne peux pas voter pour ceux qui les accablent.

According to Dr. Carl Hart methamphetamine is working in the same way as pure amphetamine. Amphetamine has found it's way to a medical use in the US as Adderall. So I don't think that's as way out of the league as you may think. 

So a user wants to buy methamphetamine and the only guy he knows who can sell it to him is a shady dealer who is the last one in a distribution line with many other people who all wanted to up their share of profit. Maybe he is lucky and it was methamphetamine in the start but who knows how much is left and what else is in the white powder mix he is buying. The money he spent goes into organized crime without paying any taxes.

The alternative would be he goes to his doctor and tells him that he wants to try this drug for recreational purpose. The doctor tells him the downsides of the drug and asks for further information. Maybe he advises him a therapy or other programs. He gives him an amount that is below a certain limit, so he can't do any real harm to himself. It is pure, which doesn't mean it is not dangerous but nowhere near as the unknown powder. He knows how to use it and the downsides. The profit is taxed and can be used for information programs and therapy.

Also if it becomes legal you probably wouldn't use it and also the majority of the people wouldn't use it. But the person who wants to use it, is going to use it if you want it or not.

Slovakia and Ukraine already have an earlier related agreement about the reverse flow, so I'm not sure if 'demands' is the best choise of words here. 

&gt; It requires some special technology (sorry I have no idea) 

Yes, currently Slovakia cannot do reverse flow to Ukraine - needs some additional infrastructure first, such as metering stations and pipes. It would not be a huge effort to build those but the need exists, and getting those in place has it's own complications including Gazprom.

There's also contractual issue: Gazprom claims its contract with Slovakia prohibits the country from doing reverse flows. The EU has raised questions about the legality of such contractual clausules restricting gas flows, an investigation and legal case has been in the works since 2012: [Antitrust: Commission opens proceedings against Gazprom](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-937_en.htm?locale=FR)

&gt; That means, we would have loss 50% of these money a year while pushing the gas back to Ukraine.

I for one think that the EU should collectively help compensate if such economic losses incur.

No. Also Poland and Hungary have the capability already in place. Hungary and Poland could ship up to about quarter of Ukraine's summertime gas demand.

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"Pretty much. I'll try and give my perspective as a US/EU citizen who spent their childhood in the US, their teens and twenties in the UK and worked for the Canadian government:

Culturally, Canada *does* have more in common with the UK than it does the US, and I think a lot of people in both countries (and in others) seem to seriously underestimate the difference in mentality between Americans and Brits. Most Brits seem convinced that they're European in name only and obviously have loads in common with Americans, because those nice people on television remind me of me and my mates, right? I think it was Stephen Fry who said, ""You'll never feel more European than when you travel to the States.""

Now this is purely anecdotal based on my time in Canada and the plethora of Canadians with which I've worked, but generally speaking, Canadians seem to have a much more European set of values - national health care, a political spectrum closer to the UK than to the US, British and French political institutions, a multi-party Westminster parliamentary system, widespread use of the metric system, etc. The things that seem to throw people off in their assumptions are the fact that most Canadian cities look like American cities, and most Canadians sound American in their accents. As a result, people superficially perceive little difference between the two countries, when that's just not true. However, I will admit that Montreal was one of the stranger places I've ever been - to me, it looked like someone had pulled a prank and gone through your average American city (somewhere like Cleveland) and just switched the signs to French overnight. Nothing tells your mind **NOT EUROPE** quite like driving past *le Walmart Supercentre*. I'm so used to seeing signs in French in a place that [looks like this](http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/paris-street.jpg), and not [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jkW1X1O7rFg/TPzvzXza9fI/AAAAAAAADhs/glUicjrsMuE/s1600/MontrealDowntown.jpg).

On the whole, I do think that Canadians (as well as Australians and New Zealanders, if we're referring to the Commonwealth realms) do have what it takes to be not in the EU per se, but in some sort of special relationship much like Norway and Switzerland where tariffs/customs duties and immigration formalities are removed. 

That being said, one HUGE thing that most people forget is that Canada has been wholly reliant on the United States economically for nearly a century now, and NAFTA pretty much sealed that up. To try and summarise this as quickly as possible: the United States arbitrarily selects technical and safety standards as well as codes for all of its products, and they are either accidentally or deliberately **wholly different** from those found in the EU (whose standards tend to be recognised worldwide). This is either due to the continued heavy reliance on Imperial/US Customary units in engineering or manufacturing, differences in electrical mains voltage and frequency (120V/60 Hz vs 230V/50 Hz), differences in telecommunications standards, major differences in car safety standards and construction, differences in paper sizes and the pulping industry, differences in *all* building materials and the construction industry as a whole. The most important thing to remember is that **almost all of these differences are virtually irreconcilable**. They're completely and utterly different, and are primarily the result of US non-tariff trade barriers to protect domestic industries, as well as the American refusal to use the metric system wholly for the purposes of trading goods and services, and not just in niche applications like aerospace engineering.

As a result of ALL of this, you can simply sum it up like this: virtually all physical products on sale in the EU (and for that matter, most of the world) CANNOT be sold in the United States due to differing technical standards. Due to NAFTA, virtually all Canadian technical standards are simply copied and pasted from their American counterparts (sometimes not even bothering to change the spelling to Canadian standards). 

Consequently, international businesses have long since regarded Canada as effectively a part of the United States in terms of markets; this means that everything has to be effectively redesigned from international to North American standards. Let's say, for example, that you want to construct a building in Ontario. You'll hire Canadian architects, and 90% of the time the design you get will be using the foot-inch system. Why? It's not because the architects and engineers don't understand metric - it's because the building materials available to them are US-spec, so the lumber, the drywall, the roofing materials, all of that will be available in hard US Customary units of *n* feet *n* inches in dimensions. Therefore, if you actually wanted to build something in metric, you'd have to import materials from elsewhere and pay customs duty on it. When it's built and the electrician shows up, he'll use standard North American wiring (thicker than international wiring due to the 120V generating more heat), and it will be the standard red/black wires, and they'll install the NEMA North American sockets, because that's where the electronics come from.

Furthermore, one of the strange ironies of Canada's inability to access global markets is that many of those US-spec products, especially when it comes to wood and paper products, are made in Canada. As a result, there is very little impetus for Canada to change and harmonise its standards and regulations with the international community when they've got a huge market directly to their south which, *by design*, is the only country that can accept the products they make. 

It's a long and confusing problem, and sorry for the wall of text, but the simple fact of the matter is that regardless of the social and political conditions in Canada, or the general nice idea that free movement of labour and goods in the EU would bring, there are other forces in the background that exist to make it **extremely difficult** (but not necessarily impossible) for Canada to have large-scale trade with the EU or anyone else for that matter. I should note that the Canada-EU Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, which has almost been finalised, will allow *some* standards (like European/international spec cars) to be imported to Canada in addition to US standards. However, there are deeper and more fundamental underlying problems which conspire to make Canada an economic possession of the US. It's funny - the UK is virtually entirely metric, including the construction industry; the only major thing left would be the roads, and much of this is owed to the harmonisation of standards within Europe. In Canada, the situation is almost the exact opposite - Canada's metrication programme stalled in the 1980s for all the reasons above and more, so that Canada is almost entirely non-metric *except* for the roads. 

If anyone has got any questions, please feel free to ask since Canada-EU relations is something that I focus on extensively.",0,1397226908,null,0,false,0,cgpt07g,t3_22p1s9,t1_cgpt07g,t1_cgpinic,null,1433309619,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

The EU takes the same view. Its ""borders"" expand, but it does not absorb nations into a superstate. It realizes economic cooperation is more beneficial for everyone than military annexations and military territorial expansion. 

Russia clearly does not understand this concept. Crimea plus additional threats of military action go to show its not beyond the military expansion mentality. And the fact it embargoes any country that gets closer to the EU shows its not beyond old mercantilism mentalities.

Not in the case we have here: In this case we can see only slander, hate speach and utter BS used as a propaganda vehicle.

Speaking in general, to have population unquestioning, biased opinions (our vs their history) is not the way to go for democratic society. In fact, it is extremely important to have educated critical open society for democracy to strive: that is why it does not work like our propaganda vs their propaganda. The only weapon against that type of propaganda is actual facts and information: truth against lies, science against blunders.

But, it is extremely important NOT to get to the point, where all possible interpretations are equal in validity, because then it becomes something like a commercial advertisement (like Coke&amp;Pepsi) where the one who has more coverage wins. In that kind of game history only looses, because to make ""your message"" you have to strip it down and make it appealing, attractive, easily digestible while losing the essence of it. Reality is difficult, sour and hard to understand. How can you compete with simple, nice, sweet propaganda mindset of we are good they are bad? Even more so against a country that spends on influence in ""blizhnij zapad"" more than GDP of Lithuania.

Moreover, according to laws of Lithuania slander and libel is criminalized: you can not call your neighbor a killler if you have not a slightest proof. That is why legal action is absolutely justified. Also if you start a discussion with an opponent it means that you think that opinion is worth of answer, and may give an impression to general public that they are both comparable. E.g. If a doctor starts a discussion with a fan of homeopathy, that only validates this pseudo-science: that is why doctors do not invite homeopathy quacks to scientific conferences. Neither should Lithuania try to do the same, because it would quickly use up all resources while trying to disprove delirium wandering of Russian propaganda.

I understand that u/mistymist assumed that you call unbiased history a propaganda. If so, then as you said

&gt; then any facts could be interpreted in any way

Of course there are always limits for a human science, and also present politics is integral part of historiography (that gives a lot of information: e.g. Tacitus talking about Jesus), but it does not make all history relative and biased, in marxist terms, a mere tool of production.

Because we can tell now openly that Katyn hapened 1940 and who is responsible for the crimes: there can be no discussion ""Katyn '41 vs Katyn '40"", tombstones with one date in Russia and another tombstone in Poland and say that it is all just a matter of politics, or have a discussion and claim ballance.

&gt; Have you noticed the anti-Russian circlejerk that /r/europe has turned into? I'm serious, find me one article posted in the past few weeks that wasn't critical of Russia.

58 upvotes, 50 downvotes

---

Now please, explain why would anyone downvote any of these posts? Was I not contributing to the discussion? Did I write something that is false?

It's not the karma loss that is my problem, it's the fact that posts which are blatantly anti-Russian **and often false** get upvoted as the top comments in the thread. So when I open a thread on this forum, the first thing I'll read will be propaganda, lies, and misinformation.

Again, let's look at the current thread. This thread is suggesting that there is a Russian propaganda machine running in the background of Reddit, upvoting Russian posts, downvoting Ukrainan posts. No proof is offered, it's just a question if everyone else feels paranoid too. So obviously the most-upvoted comment should be someone asking for proofs and examples.

You need to have a really twisted sense of reality to not notice how the opposite is actually true, but anyway... the first 5-6 top posts are those that agree there is a Russian astroturfing happening here.

&gt; However even I noticed that ... at some point there was a sudden pike on pro-Russian side

22 upvotes, 5 downvotes, this is the top post

&gt; Yeah, a lot of textbook ""whataboutism"" examples regarding Russia vs. the US in comments, in most cases aimed to change debate focus to the US, or a ""debate about the debate"".

49 upvotes, 13 downvotes

&gt; From the rhetorics some of these obviously astroturfing commenters use

8 upvotes, 1 downvote

&gt; But what is most laughable are the comments made regarding an ""anti-Russian circlejerk"".

47 upvotes, 13 downvotes

&gt; Yes, we do. I think we were one of the first where they tested out their new bot's.

&gt; Of course as Estonian language is quite complicated it's very easy to notice things that are just wrong. 

(votes still hidden but it's near the top)

From here, ascent to Bocca del Tucket (2600mt), right turn on the ""equipped path"" of the Bocchette Alte &lt;probably not the best translation, this generally means a path through harsh terrain where some climbing equipment has been permanently planted to allow crossing dangerous section&gt;. Going through the 3000 mt of cengia Garbari &lt;a ""cengia"" is generally some kind of path dug into the side of the mountain&gt; and Spallone dei Massodi you reach the Bocca d'Armi (2750mt). Here you can either go down to the Alimonta refuge or continue toward the Bocchette Centrali.
After climbing up the first ""flight of stairs"" &lt; I don't really know what these means. Literally it translates to ""jump of stairs"" but it doesn't really make sense. i guess I should know the place to give a better translation&gt; you will find the characteristic horizontal track in the rock until you can see Campanil Basso &lt;lower belltower&gt;. 
Descending through small frail rocks toward Bocca del Campanil Basso, you continue for 15 more minutes in a cengia &lt;like Before&gt; on the northern side of the mountain until Bocca del Brenta. Descending on the mountain side of Molveno we had lunch at the Pedrotti and then, going through Bocca del Brenta again, Went to refuge Brentei (2200mt), refuge Casinei and back to the car parking.

PS- Another chance to reach the refuge Pedrotti is the ""Osvaldo Orsi"" path or the new ""ferrata"" Spellini &lt;a ferrata is similar to a ""sentiero attrezzato"", but generally involves some climbing using tools permanently implanted on the mountain wall&gt; which from Bocca delle Armi descends into Busa degli Sfulmini end from there to Pedrotti.",0,1397228605,null,0,false,0,cgptq33,t3_22ryxc,t1_cgptq33,t3_22ryxc,null,1433309958,4,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,4

I just would like to venture that the United Nations is a rather ineffective and inefficient institution despite being founded on these principles. 

&gt;Why is the balance between peace and violence(war?) better than just plain peace?

Because not everyone plays by your rules. Peace and a soft-power approach is great when everybody does the same, but as soon as somebody whips their dick out and starts using their hard power the dynamic goes out the window. 

&gt;I don't think peace and liberty are uniquely western values. I think they are universal human values when people are not living in fear. Or do you mean something else by ""western values""?

No, they're not, but I am a fan of Locke, Voltaire, Paine, etc. and the other influential thinkers which inspired both the American &amp; French Revolutions, so my view might be bias. 

&gt; If people see that the current boss (USA) is playing a fair game and promoting common good they will start leaning towards the view that we are all friends and in this together. However, if they see those with the power use it to exploit others for selfish reasons, they will start to think that that's the name of the game and this will cause balance of power to shift towards those people who don't care about playing nice. It is up to the ones who currently hold the power to decide which way it will go and that can only be done by showing example. *""With great power comes great responsibility.""*

You have a very real and good point here that should be recognized and adhered to by American politicians and leaders. We must lead by example when we can, but at the same time, I also contend we must make hard decisions for the very same reasons. Great responsibility is more than meets the eye.

---

&gt;A __via ferrata__ ([Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language) for ""iron road"", plural *vie ferrate* or in English *via ferratas* ) is a protected climbing route found in the Alps and certain other locations. The essence of a modern via ferrata is a steel cable which runs along the route and is periodically (every 3 to 10 metres (9.8 to 32.8 ft)) fixed to the rock. Using a via ferrata kit, climbers can secure themselves to the cable, limiting any fall. The cable can also be used as aid to climbing, and additional climbing aids, such as iron rungs (stemples), pegs, carved steps and even ladders and bridges are often provided. Thus via ferrata allow otherwise dangerous routes to be undertaken without the risks associated with unprotected scrambling and climbing or need for climbing equipment (e.g. ropes). They enable the relatively inexperienced a means of enjoying the dramatic positions and accessing difficult peaks normally the preserve of the serious mountaineer; although, as there is a need for some equipment, a good head for heights and basic technique, via ferrata can be seen as a distinct step up from ordinary mountain walking. Conversely, the modest equipment requirements, ability to do them solo, and potential to cover a lot of ground, mean that via ferrata can also appeal to more experienced climbers.

i read that this was the highlight of the brenta group (as far as hiking/ferrata is concerned), and that the brenta group is a highlight of the dolomites? i'll only have 5 days to hike and can't do more than one overnight at a time so i'm trying to figure how to make the absolute most of them :)

did you do this exact route? i don't know how long ago it was but just in case it's fresh in your mind.. do you know if you can do this ferrata in either directions? i know some are one way only

i was thinking of doing this route but combining it with this route (alberto benini) and staying overnight at rif. alimonta: http://alavigne.net/Outdoors/FeatureReports/ViaFerrata/?p=vfbenini&amp;n=2

so basically would just continue on via ferrata route to the end and go down at the cablecars rather than via rif. tuckett. i haven't figured out what to do with my other 3 days, maybe go to cortina? if you have any suggestions or advice, please feel free to share :)

We are, as you may be aware, squaring up to Russia.

Some of this is just unfortunate that Germany has a very small slice of the North Sea Oil/Gas pie, but a lot of is the consequence of previous policy. 

There is little that could destabilise the Middle East more than a nuclear Iran, if that happened, it is very likely what was until recently unthinkable, a Saudi/Israeli pact, would happen. Germany is Iran's largest trading partner and has been of assistance to their nuclear program, which, admittedly, appears to have slowed down.

We, simply, don't trust Germany like how we trust the Americans, Canadians, Australians and New Zealanders. That's why Germany won't be allowed into a club that wasn't meant for her.

true,neonwiz,null,null,"&gt;I just would like to venture that the United Nations is a rather ineffective and inefficient institution despite being founded on these principles. 

The fact that it is based on those principles has little to do with the UN being inefficient (as I'm sure you would agree). In the end it is those with the power who say how it's gonna be, and no institution can do anything about it if it doesn't have physical power behind it.

&gt;Peace and a soft-power approach is great when everybody does the same, but as soon as somebody whips their dick out and starts using their hard power the dynamic goes out the window.

I agree with that. I will also repeat myself to point out that violence is a self-perpetuating phenomenon. It seems logical that enough of turning the other cheek by enough people will eventually result in the system (humanity on this planet) settling on a peaceful state.

Look at the context. 

For example your first and second posts quoted came out to be completely out of context - seems like here you repeated again the same problem here that you had there. You don't look at the context, just post whatever comes up to your mind. That's why you get down-voted.

This rule is, was, and will be BS. Almost noone is following it and there's no way to enforce it. People will down-vote for numerous reasons.

&gt; Russian claims that the annexation of Crimea was justifed by the opinion of the International Court of Justice on the independence of Kosovo 
&gt;
Russian leaders claim that the precedent for the so-called declaration of independence of Crimea was the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the independence of Kosovo (online here). 
&gt;
However, the court stated clearly that their opinion was not a precedent. The court said they had been given a “narrow and specific” question about Kosovo’s independence which would not cover the broader legal consequences of that decision. 
&gt;
The court highlighted circumstances in which claims for independence would be illegal. This would include if *“they were, or would have been, connected with the unlawful use of force”*. An example of “an unlawful use of force” would be an invasion and occupation by a neighbouring country – which is exactly what Russia has done.
&gt;
Furthermore, the process leading to Kosovo’s declaration of independence spanned years and included an extensive process led by the United Nations. Russian claims ignore all of these facts.

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"To be honest there are very few books on the subject - most of this info comes from weeks and months and years of reading trade documents, government policy and blogs by people who write on the subjects. Here's a quick rundown of some of the things that may be useful:

* Any article written by the late Pat Naughtin is excellent, especially with regards to Australia's metric conversion experiences, and in particular with reference to the construction industry.

* [Here's an interesting leaflet](http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/paris-street.jpg) published by the defunct Canada Plan Service from I believe 1981. Note that most of the info it contains concerning sourcing metric materials in Canada was in the future tense, and none of it panned out in the end, so it's not particularly relevant today. [Here's a blog post](http://themetricmaven.com/?p=1371) that mentions this. You might want to intensively research the [**invisible metric embargo**](http://themetricmaven.com/?p=411) (that post only scratches the surface) and [**non-tariff barriers to trade**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-tariff_barriers_to_trade). 

* In addition to entirely different construction materials, the rest of the world uses [different paper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size) (read this first before/instead of any of the individual standards). The international standard is [ISO 216](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216); North America uses [ANSI/ASME Y14.1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI/ASME_Y14.1) (with ANSI meaning American National Standards Institute, the bane of the ISO and international manufacturers). The most common paper size in each system is A4 in ISO, and US Letter in Y14.1. [This is an old yet brilliant article](http://betweenborders.com/wordsmithing/a4-vs-us-letter/) about the differences between the two. As someone who routinely needs to fax things from the UK to the US, fuck US Letter.

* One of the most egregious differences would be car safety standards, with the US having entirely different standards from the rest of the planet for legacy and Detroit protectionist reasons (funny how the rest of the world will let you import a US-spec vehicle but not vice versa). Canada's CMVSS (Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards) are almost completely harmonised with the [US FMVSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Motor_Vehicle_Safety_Standards) (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards), many copied and pasted. The rest of the world uses [UN ECE standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Forum_for_Harmonization_of_Vehicle_Regulations). This will change in Canada soon with the Canada-EU CFTA that I mention below.

* The differences in mains electricity is mainly an historical issue and one that no one can do much about. Nevertheless, it hugely affects the ability of manufacturers to move products across borders without altering them first (this is most notable in high-voltage appliances, or those that either heat up or have a spinning motor inside). [Here's an interesting article on those differences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains_electricity) along with [a map](http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//d/db/800px-Map_of_the_world_coloured_by_voltage_and_frequency.png). This does tend to create knock-on effects in other industries, such as dictating framerates in film and television and the associated distribution (60Hz countries like the US and Canada use NTSC, most other 50Hz countries use PAL or SECAM for analogue broadcasts, and different technology entirely for digital broadcasts, so many older televisions can't be used across the divide either). Needless to say, all of this affects consumer choice - you get the products of the manufacturers who can be bothered to make them for you, it's as simple as that. To tie this back to construction, I was just last week reading an article on building standards, particularly LEED in North America and Passivhaus in Germany/Europe. Passivhaus insulation and energy conservation standards are much higher than LEED standards, and the article was discussing a Canadian man who wanted to build a passive house in Canada but who couldn't. The reason: the appliances and building materials (particularly insulation) simply couldn't be sourced in North America. Appliances are one of those things that has to be remade due to the voltage and frequency differences, and because Americans (and by association, Canadians) have different 'tastes', appliances such as refrigerators and dishwashers tend to be much larger and more energy-intensive, and none of the ones this man could find in Canada could comply to passive house standards. He also couldn't get the right thickness of recycled insulation materials either. Therefore, in the end there are only LEED houses in Canada (not many, either) but I don't think there are any yet built to Passivhaus specs because the materials simply don't exist, and importing them isn't possible due to problems with tariffs and incompatible systems.

* Try to do some reading on the [Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Economic_and_Trade_Agreement) (CETA). [Here is a decent analysis by the CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/summary-of-canada-eu-free-trade-deal-tabled-1.2286695). Try reading through the document, and pay particular attention to the bit about vehicle quotas and UNECE/CMVSS (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, respectively). [Here is a summary page](http://actionplan.gc.ca/en/content/ceta-aecg/canada-eu-trade-agreement) from Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada.

I'm not even sure what else to add in now because there's so much that I'm sure I haven't remembered off the top of my head immediately without linking you to schematics of road construction in British Columbia or something really esoteric like that. You'll also notice I used loads of Wikipedia links - on topics like these, those articles tend to be the best by far since they combine information from multiple sources, as there is rarely a single reference source for the entire subject.

Just know this: sitting in a room in Canada, virtually nothing around you is sold overseas (maybe something similar, but it's certainly been redesigned), and the converse is true - someone sitting in a room in Germany will be surrounded almost entirely by things that cannot be sold in the US or Canada due to legal, technical or ideologically incompatible reasons. Even if many of those legal obstructions were to go away, new products would still fail to integrate with legacy systems, a problem particularly common in the construction industry.

Fun fact: the international exit sign is ISO 16069 and 7010, [which looks like this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WHivD1X8LKU/UflInNFDtBI/AAAAAAAABzU/mtCi16L12vc/s1600/ISO+EXIT+Left,+Ahead,+Right.jpg). Some countries in the EU outside the UK use a slightly modified version, but it's going to disappear soon as well. Nevertheless, they're almost the same. However, Canada followed the US lead, [using the red EXIT sign](http://www.beghellicanada.com/_assets/product-images/sd/ottica-b6l.png) (usually with SORTIE following in public buildings, and EXIT only in English-speaking provinces and SORTIE only in Quebec within private buildings). However, that's changing next year, and most of the provincial building codes have been amended so that the ISO 'green running man' will be the new standard in Canada for all new construction henceforth. So you've got that going for you.

But don't call it ""Hanau, Frankfurt"" within earshot of the locals. It's near Frankfurt, but is not Frankfurt.

Like most German cities, Hanau has a halfway decent public transportation system: buses serve most areas of the city at half-hour intervals or more frequently. Be aware that not everything that says Hanau is actually Hanau: the municipality of Hanau covers Hanau itself and some other places, including Steinheim, Großauheim, Klein-Auheim, Wolfgang and one or two other places that escape me right now. On the other hand, public transportation links are good, so it shouldn't normally be too much trouble. It's fully integrated, so within the local area bus tickets are good on trains and vice versa. ""HU"" is the abbreviation for Hanau, so, for example, ""HU-Großauheim"" means Großauheim in the municipality of Hanau.

I don't know why you've been told that you'd be charged more if your SO is with you. That sounds fishy to me, to be honest.

&gt;The Court observes, however, that while the Security Council has condemned particular 
declarations of independence, in all of those instances it was making a determination as regards the 
concrete situation existing at the time that those declarations of independence were made; it states 
that “the illegality attached to the declarations of independence thus stemmed not from the 
unilateral character of these declarations as such, but from the fact that they were, or would have 
been, connected with the unlawful use of force or other egregious violations of norms of general 
international law, in particular those of a peremptory character (jus cogens)”. The Court notes that 
“[i]n the context of Kosovo, the Security Council has never taken this position”. The exceptional 
character of the resolutions enumerated above appears to the Court to confirm that no general - 8 - 
prohibition against unilateral declarations of independence may be inferred from the practice of the 
Security Council.


As far as I understand: only Security Council can declare an illegal declarations of independence. Wasn't the case with Kosovo nor Crimea.

Also it follows with:

&gt;For the reasons already given, the Court considers that general international law contains no 
applicable prohibition of declarations of independence. Accordingly, it concludes that the 
declaration of independence of 17 February 2008 did not violate general international law.
