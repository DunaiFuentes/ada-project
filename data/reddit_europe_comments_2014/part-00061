After World War II, the Soviet Union (and many other countries) wanted to push the borders of Germany as far west as they could. In pursuit of this, they decided to take all of Germany's territory east of a certain line and hand it to Poland, and expel the ethnic Germans in favor of ethnic Poles.

However, part of this territory, the German exclave of [East Prussia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Prussia#Weimar_Republic), bordered the Soviet Union itself, and the Soviets were itching for a bit more territory, so the exclave was divided between Poland and the USSR. Because, within the Soviet Union, the borders between SSRs (Soviet Socialist Republics - the units that are now independent post-Soviet states) were not so important, the Soviet half was attached to the Russian SFSR (Soviet *Federative* Socialist Republic - special name because it's so big), despite being separated by several hundred miles from the rest of the republic. In any case the whole area was treated as a giant closed military zone (not just a military base, but also military industries operated by civilians), so its civilian status was also not super important. The region was named after its capital Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg).

After the fall of the USSR, the region remained attached to the Russian SFSR (renamed as the Russian Federation), but because of its geographical isolation, many of the old military forces have been pulled out, and now it's just a center of heavy industry with some special trade/transportation ties with EU states, and awesome German architecture from the Renaissance period forward.",0,1393734532,null,0,1393735748,0,cfs7q2m,t3_1z9vso,t1_cfs7q2m,t1_cfs5xys,null,1432620365,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

On that note, why should American men and women be used as a deterrent to Russia in what is very clearly a European issue?

The Pentagon has recently recommended fairly steep defense cuts (by American standards), and the former US Secretary of Defense told European defense secretaries the US is tired of providing the vast majority of NATO's financial and military capabilities. He said he understands political and financial concerns will make it impossible for European NATO members to meet their contractual obligations any time soon, but urged European nations to consolidate resources to avoid redundancy. Since his speech a couple years ago pretty much nothing has changed. Given only two NATO members are meeting their obligations he went as far as saying the US could actually leave the organization.

Europe is one of the highest income regions in the world, and it should be able to at a minimum defend itself.

But in both cases, I as a German feel that Germany is not ready to lead in this fashion quite yet, even when I can acknowledge that it would be the right thing to do at this time. Germans at the moment are very comfortable with being a silent power, implementing foreign policy and European policy with money in the hopes of not offending anyone.

I cant even count how many Europeans have compared American military presence in Europe to imperialism. Apparently its an outdated system since ""Russia is no longer a threat."" 

They back this up by saying the US needs all the bases there and has no interest in leaving Europe because it likes having control over it. This is despite the highest ranking official in the US' defense department saying the exact opposite. He said if the vast majority of Europe continues to not take its defense seriously the US wont either, up to and including leaving NATO. Given how few NATO members are meeting their obligations I cant see how any protests could have much merit. 

I've noticed as soon as conflict dies down they will be right back at it. Every non-American I've met traveling and discussed politics with has unanimously stated the US needs to stay out of other countries. If they were European virtually all thought US troops should leave. Granted most of these people were in their 20s, so it may not be representative of the entire populations. 

If you read their Facebook posts now, you would think the US invited Russia into Ukraine or that it is the country dropping chemical weapons and bombs on Syrian children. Hypocrisy at its finest.

He said due to financial and political concerns he understands many European NATO members would not be able to meet their contractual obligations any time soon.

Also, the Pentagon recommended fairly deep defense cuts (by American standards) yesterday.

Its hard to compare it to the revelations about spying. Russia's leadership was well known before this happened. Just because people refused to accept the fact Russia might act out, didn't make the threat nonexistent. 

Many Europeans seem to think the US wants to spend what it does in Europe as part of its military industrial complex or for other reasons. This is despite the US defense department and administrations being *very* clear they're tired of expending so many resources on a continent that should be able to defend itself. 

The former US Secretary of Defense went as far as to say the US could withdraw from NATO because so few members are meeting their obligations and continue making cuts expecting the US and a handful of other nations to pick up the slack. 

I would be willing to bet most of these opinions are only temporary. As soon as things calm down, US military presence and capability in Europe will once again be considered imperialist and there will be fairly unanimous public opinion against it. 

I have met so many people traveling that told me the US has no right to intervene in other countries, yet their facebook posts would suggest the US is the one who invaded Ukraine, or the country dropping chemical weapons on Syrian children. 

So if this truly did change people's mind it would be one thing. Georgia was not all that long ago, yet as of two weeks ago that was all but forgotten. 

It is definitely not a sin to change one's view in light of new information, but claiming ""US international intervention is immoral, except in issues *I* care about"" is the definition of hypocrisy.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt; I have no doubts the US government has no problems throwing us away once we cease to be useful, or going against our wishes if its not in the interest of the US.

The US has been surprisingly flexible with the lack of European defense functionality. The top US defense official threatened to withdraw from NATO two years ago if European members continued to disregard their own defense. He stated he knew it was financially and politically impossible to meet NATO targets any time soon in many European member countries, but urged they at least consolidate their resources (read form an EU army). 

I just wanted to speak to that one point you made. The US has been very clear and very blunt it would not provide European defense forever. So if it ever withdrew significant amounts of defense support it would not really be because Europe ceased to be useful, but rather because European countries were warned for years to take their defense seriously. After already not meeting NATO targets they continued to cut their budgets and expect the US to pick up the slack. 

So I am not sure you could say the US would ""throw them away"" at any point given the fact its been very blunt about European nations taking defense seriously, and for the most part they've only cut more and have not made any real progress with consolidation. I'd definitely put more blame on European governments than the US should the US finally pick up and leave.

**Cyprus**

* Murat Kanatlı, a conscientious objector and left-wing activist in northern Cyprus is once again detained in military prison for daring to exercise his right not to be forced to serve in an army. He's been fighting to get northern Cyprus to recognise his right since 2011. Both sides of Cyprus have an obligatory and long military service for men, with yearly follow ups until the age of 50. Neither side respects the right to conscientious objection, with the south punishing it with a longer military service (+33%) and the north with prison time. Without any trace of shame, Greek Cypriot parties release statements in support of Kanatlı, 'forgetting' that they support punishing Greek Cypriot anti-militarists, and have recently unanimously voted to up the punishments for 'draft dodging' [[KP]](http://www.kpdailynews.com/index.php/cat/67/news/209/PageName/LOCAL_NEWS) [[Ph]](http://www.philenews.com/el-gr/eidiseis-politiki/39/187541/kinitopoiisi-gia-apeleftherosi-tou-mourat-kanatli-tis-neas-kyprou)

The new decision rules that the two other bidders, CYTA and LRG weren't actually eligible. This could either lead to the licence to be auctioned all over again, with only Velister bidding since they already established the network, or assume that CYTA and LRG biddings didn't happen, and refund the amount above starting price to Velister (the difference between what's been paid of the bid of 10mil EUR and starting price 850 000EUR). Velister's dire financial state lead the ministers with interest in the company suggesting that Public TV (CyBC) should abandon their own digital network and broadcast some, or all of the public channels as a paying client of Velister, essentially a state subsidy towards Velister.

**And now, the biggest issue, privatisations**

* Electricity Authority and Cyprus Telecommunications staff went on strike on Tuesday and Wednesday, protesting specific 'disastrous' privatisation plan (privatisations “under reasonable conditions” are accepted by the majority of workers - some also warn that any privatisation will endanger the interests of the citizens), being lied to (the Government was elected under the promise not to sell out public property, and to seek alternatives), and for having their pension fund 'practically stolen' by the government, a strike which lead to rolling 1hr blackouts as not all production units were staffed during the morning. 

* The government wants to privatise those organisations in order to raise 1.4bil EUR until 2016, as per Troika obligations.

* EAC stuff during the strike alleged that their organisation is ordered by the government not to cut electricity to private media empire owing more than 800 000 in due bills and other corporations owe them several thousands that the Government ordered them not to try to collect. Their thesis is that the Government could raise the 1.4bil until 2016 without selling off EAC for that low price, if they allow them to collect due bills from businessmen.

* Electricity Authority striking workers are widely criticised, for alienating the society by causing rolling blackouts which cause major inconveniences, including traffic congestions, trapping people into lifts, and disrupting trade. Even people who otherwise support the strikes did write articles recognising a communication failure from the part of the trade unions. 

* On the political aspect, the DISY/EVROKO Government had hard time to convince the Parliament that the law proposal regarding privatisations at it's current state is constitutional (Article 122). Last week they failed to bypass the parliament and vest the power to decide about privatisations solely on the responsible Minister. 

* Meanwhile, Troika pushes for an 'attractive investment package' privatisation plan, which rules out moderate privatisation plans proposed by some in the opposing voting block (ie AKEL, DIKO, EDEK, GREENS; currently making up slightly less than 60% of the parliament).

* Government warned that failing to privatise the organisations will jeopardise the country's deal with Troika, and lead to bankruptcy 

* The law proposal was narrowly rejected by the Assembly, 25 to 25, and with most of DIKO abstaining in the end (5). The bill will be submitted to the Assembly again on Tuesday, under a different title. DIKO said this time they will vote in favour, although some question the new leader's ability to control the MPs loyal to the ex-leader (this is the reason DIKO's 5 abstained, out of loyalty to the ex-leader).

* After the vote, the Government announced that they will pay February's public sector salaries only in half, and that 'maybe' no one gets paid for March.

true,stressinsh,null,null,"&gt; Colonialism was wrong. The current western governments did not participate in colonialism, their predecessors did; even so, they have continually apologized for their ancestors' actions.

My point was not that a colonialism is all right. It is just that when one country changes in some way (sometimes change might be forced upon it), it might struggle to reconcile good vision of itself with past ... misbehavior. So at some point an imaginary line is drawn - before that we have been bad, now we are good, let's stop talking and **remembering** why we have been like that. But the point is, there was logic in past behavior. 

Russia is a more heterogeneous country than many in the West now, it is HUGE, so its operating principles and interests are very different from densely populated, monoethnic countries. So to transfer an operating principles and values from modern western democracies is very shallow. Before engaging Russia, one must realize its constraints and vision.

You might be very anti colonial now, but do you honestly think that Europe had to stay put on the continent and never leave the shores in 1492...? Yes a lot of injustice have been made, but a lot of transformation too. If one cherish democracy for democracy sake, than one can say that without injustices of New World there would be no American implementation of democracy born...

&gt; That is a horrible comparison. The Falklands are British according to a treaty, they are inhabited only by British people. Crimea has been part of Ukraine for half a century, it is inhabited by many Ukrainians and Tatars. Your comparison with French, American and British overseas holdings is very weak - there have been many referenda in these regions where people voted to stay within their motherlands and the motherlands' sovereignty over those regions is internationally recognised, a very large difference with Russia and the Crimea.

Oh yes, UK =/= Russia and Falklands =/= Crimea. But there are a lot of similarities too. Both contained majority of population that might (we'll now after May 25) favor being with ""motherland"". Both Argentina and Russia have some pretension to be in both places (btw are you surprised that we do not have much on English wikipedia about Argentine reason to invade Falklands [probably it is somewhere.. I just do not wish to dig any deeper than surface wikipedia search). But I  do not think that Argentine just decided to invade without some reasonable pretension...
On the other hand, someone in other treat on reddit published something about lack of quorum during voting on the 1954 transfer -&gt; it was stated that transfer was never legal... Or may be Russia is bound by accepting Ukraine independence in 1991. Or may be Crimeans suppose to have a right for self-determination... Law is goddamn grey area, if ""truth"" would be obvious to everyone all the time, we would have no courts.

&gt; Makes no sense. Just because A is worse than B that doesn't mean B can't be bad too.

I am not quite sure how to understand this...? Russia is bad, Ukraine is bad, there is no third choice? Or what?

I merely stated that Crimea is relatively apart from both Ukraine and Russia, it is not an integral part of Ukraine to the same degree as south/east territories are.

All relative, imposing one's view of the world on others without trying to understand other position is wrong (in this way, Russia trying to keep Ukraine in its sphere with disregard to Ukrainian interests is wrong  btw.)

This doesn't mean the European allies are not useful. Only less so.

&gt;He stated he knew it was financially and politically impossible to meet NATO targets any time soon in many European member countries, but urged they at least consolidate their resources (read form an EU army). 

Then he and I share the same view.

&gt;The US has been very clear and very blunt it would not provide European defense forever. So if it ever withdrew significant amounts of defense support it would not really be because Europe ceased to be useful, but rather because European countries were warned for years to take their defense seriously.

I think you misunderstood what I meant by useful.

What I'm worried about is the influence the US wields over our national governments simply because of its importance to our security. You do not move against the person that makes sure you're safe, at least not too often. 

Would eastern European countries have supported the Iraq war as feverently if they were already secured by an EU army, I wonder?

What if, in the future, foreign policy goals of the US and many EU member states disalign to the extend of say, China and the US in regards to contested territory in the East China Sea? What if we are denied the ability to have such diverging interests precisely because we need to appease the US? And foreign policy is just one area where this might be true.

In all of this, I do not blame the US government. I blame my own for not wanting to move out of this gilded cage, most likely because it is politically easy to remain confined in it. Because it doesn't hurt. 

In all other aspects, I agree with what you said and I understand US frustration with their European allies.

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"&gt;Its hard to compare it to the revelations about spying. Russia's leadership was well known before this happened. Just because people refused to accept the fact Russia might act out, didn't make the threat nonexistent. 

I agree it's less surprising. Yet I fail to see how this answers my initial question. 

Why is it unusual for people to react stronger to something that is occuring closer to their home? 

Georgia could've been seen as an exception. Only a minority follows Russian politics very closely. Ukraine on the other hand is a publicly visible narrative all of Europe followed since its beginning and that definitely had a EU vs. Russia touch to it. No wonder it has a greater effect on people.

&gt;I would be willing to bet most of these opinions are only temporary. 

I'm not so certain. Russia made a great gift by directly showing the EU public that soft power only goes so far. The shits shat in western Europe right now are as big as a mountain. Just look at this threat, it's hilarious.

&gt;As soon as things calm down, US military presence and capability in Europe will once again be considered imperialist and there will be fairly unanimous public opinion against it.

Many Chinese share this view, and they still have a functioning military. I don't see how you are required to trust the US military in order to be in favour of a sound military of your own making.  

&gt;I have met so many people traveling that told me the US has no right to intervene in other countries, yet their facebook posts would suggest the US is the one who invaded Ukraine, or the country dropping chemical weapons on Syrian children. 

And you have people who view Europeans' reluctance to engage in military conflict as a sign of mental retardation, rather than a quite understandable overreaction to the events of WWI, WWII, the Cold War, plus all of our bloody history before that. 

Did most of your extended family vanquish only 70 years ago, were you raised by horror stories of war, confronted with them in school and taught how futile it all was your entire life? That's what your standard relation to war is here in Germany. Now try to have a rational discussion about the neccessity to defend yourself. *Good luck*. 

Get used to the fact that there are idiots all around who will always seek to feel superior to others. Sometimes idiotic views become mainstream. It takes a reality check like Ukraine to get them undone again.

&gt;Georgia was not all that long ago, yet as of two weeks ago that was all but forgotten. 

As stated above, Georgia didn't first have a revolution with protestors waving EU flags that was covered by mainstream media for months, resulting in Russian military intervention *after* Russia lost the soft power battle. Furthemore, Georgia isn't a country that neighbours important and influential EU member states.

&gt;It is definitely not a sin to change one's view in light of new information, but claiming ""US international intervention is immoral, except in issues I care about"" is the definition of hypocrisy. 

I agree. But most of the people who now want such intervention are in fact eastern European. They always supported the US.

Ja, eben. Das ist ein inneres Problem der USA, wo man sich als Aussenstehender einfach raushalten sollte. Pocher hat sich nicht rausgehalten und ins Hornissennest gestochen. 

&gt; Was ist denn bitte an Vienna rassistischer als an Paris?

Die einfachste Grundregel: Wenn ein Schwarzer das N-Wort sagt, ist es ok. Sobald es aber von jemanden anderen gesagt wird, ist es beleidigend. Muss man nicht verstehen - ist einfach so.

&gt; Ich bin eigentlich der Meinung, dass man Wörter wie ""Rassismus"" und ""Rassist"" nicht allzu leichtfertig um sich werfen sollte. Allein schon deshalb, weil dadurch das ganze irgendwie verharmlost.

Wo ist denn die Grenze wo Rassismus nicht ""harmlos"" ist? Ist an der Kasse im Supermarkt explizit unfreundlich behandelt zu werden noch tolerabel? Und es wird erst zum ""richtigen"" Rassismus, wenn man im Bus angepoebelt wird? Sind Tuerkenwitze schon Rassimus oder eher ""stell dich mal nicht so an - ist doch lustig""?

Fuer dich, als jemanden, der taeglichen Ressentiments nicht ausgesetzt ist, mag es ja noch tolerabel zu sein, wenn man mal ab und zu einen kleinen Witz erzaehlt. Aber versetz dich mal in die Haut eines Betroffenen, der am Tag ein Dutzend Leute wie dich trifft - und jeder meint ""stell dich nicht so an, ist doch nurn kleiner Witz"". Das summiert sich auf.

Und dann reden die Leute vom mangelnden Integrationswillen - wo ich mir super vorstellen kann, dass der Wille sich in eine Gesellschaft, die einen andauernd dumm von der Seite anmacht, weil man nicht hier geboren wurde, recht schnell schrumpfen duerfte.

Was Rassismus ist und was kein Rassismus ist koennen somit eigentlich nur Menschen beurteilen, die selber vom Rassimsus betroffen sind.

* Salvados, probably the most incisive TV show in the country, pulled a 'The War of the Worlds' on us, selling a mockumentary implicating the Spanish king on an attempted coup d'état in 1981. Jordi Évole, the popular comedian/journalist behind Salvados, has received a lot of flak for ""lying"" to the country. I haven't watched the show yet, but in case you're bored enough to care about my opinion: yes, the king was somewhat involved but not in the way portrayed in Salvados.

* The Minister of Interior awarded the medal to police merit (an honor reserved to police officers who lost their lives in the line of duty) to the Virgin Mary. Also religious chants will now be sung on official acts. The police unions are not happy about this at all. Of course this has nothing to do with said Minister of Interior being a member of the Opus Dei (a catholic cult)! On the bright side, I can't wait to see the Virgin Mary honoring her medal and bashing people with a police baton in upcoming demonstrations!

* Some guy uploaded a silly video of him driving his car from the passenger seat. Before he could take it down, the police had already a screenshot of his sunglasses-covered mug and was asking on Twitter for people who might recognise him (by the way, the Spanish police community manager is pretty fun, if you know Spanish and have a Twitter account, follow him, it's a riot... well, not literaly a RIOT, we have those as well but...). After a countrywide manhunt, the poor fellow ended up walking into a police station probably because enough was enough.  

* Sucks to be ETA, really. After years of murders and terrorist attacks, they finally decide to hand over their weapons... only for that action to be received with lukewarm enthusiasm or outright suspicion by those few paying attention. Goddamn Russians, did they really have to start WW3 this weekend?! Even the previous story about the Twitter manhunt got more coverage.

* ~~Our very liberal government decided to limit crowdfunding up to 3000€. Yeah. That means that if you want to fund a project that'll cost more than 3k, you'll need to kneel before the almighty banks and promise them your firstborn in exchange for a loan with an abusive interest rate. So it's not a matter of our government being Internet illiterate (which they are), but of keeping the banks happy. How nice of them! Now if only said banks would actually offer loans to regular people...~~ **CHECK /u/angry_spaniard'S COMMENT BELOW!**

(election on may 25th) His party has a long history of scandals and may have pressured him, although this is unconfirmed.

- Muss man jetzt davon ausgehen, dass Pocher innerlich einen Hass auf alles Nicht-Weiße/Deutsche hat (und in seiner Freizeit Asylanten zusammenschlägt)? Oder ist es vielleicht wahrscheinlicher, dass er einfach ein Idiot ist, der nicht darüber nachgedacht hat, was er sagt?

Ein Rassist ist meiner Ansicht jemand, der tatsächlich etwas gegen Ausländer, Farbige, etc. hat, und nicht jemand, der sich einfach nicht zu benehmen weiß und evtl. damit Leute beleidigt.     
So wäre jemand, der Farbige verachtet, dies aber nicht öffentlich zeigt, ein Rassist.

Io posso dirti come si fa in paese. 

Allora ti serve un sacco di legna da ardere e, ad occhio, una decina di metri quadri all'aperto.

Poi squarti i majali (for more fun do it while they are still alive) togtli tutta la roba che c'è dentro e li apri come cozze. 

Poi prendi due spiedi e con forza e determinazione lo infilzi facendo tipo una X. 

Cosí: http://blog.libero.it/ValledelCedrino/getmedia.php?%26or%60zo%26mm}Kg%60%27%7F13519%3D14%25%3B8030-kaied-okeklfpaGxfdedmid|C%3F%2570%27z%05kgonmghom%05jN

Come vedi da me non lo si fa ""girare"". Sembra uno stoccafisso messo a seccare. 


Poi devi controllare la cottura. Il recinto attorno al fuoco è ellittica, cosí puoi muovere i majaletti per aumentare  (ponendoli vicino all'asse minore) o riducendo (asse maggiore) l'esposizione al calore.

In una 10ina di ore è pronto per essere gustato.

In addition, a number of serious mishandlings of violent crimes have come to light, including one where a rapist went on to attempt a kidnapping and then commit a murder due to a police fuck up with his bail hearing. Despite the impacts of these fuck ups, none of those involved with letting this happen were disciplined.

Finally, it was also revealed that the minister for justice was believed to assert political influence to dissuade police from whistle blowing.

[En](http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/european-commission-freezes-100-billion-in-funds-for-czech-republic).

* In 2009 Czech Republic presided Council of the European Union. It was taken as a opportunity to spend massive amount of money. About a quarter of the whole budget (500 - 800 million CZK, estimates differ) was wasted on audio services for one building.  The case is now investigated and the state wants to get the embezzled money back.  However, the top politician then leading the responsible ministry, is neither investigated nor asked to pony up, only low level officials from the ministry. [En](http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-government-office-claims-compensation-in-promopro-case/1049256).

* Czech technical schooling is in tatters. The Ministry fights this decline by requirement that all teachers need to have formal pedagogic education.  Now about 7 thousand of people - mostly elder technical specialists - are in danger of being forced out of schools.

* Fight over scarce places in kindergartens is here again. Decades ago there was very dense net of (free) kindergartens. Since then many were closed or sold (usually to friends of local politicians) and now we see frequent shortages, especially in large cities. Parents in despair now apply to several kindergartens simultaneously or try to sue. [Cz](http://zpravy.idnes.cz/zacinaji-zapisy-do-skolek-0yh-/domaci.aspx?c=A140224_170725_domaci_jj).

* Former High State Attorney in Prague is investigated for connection with organized crime. His assets were found to be massivelly out of proportion to his official salary.

* High state official who directed State Land Fund was recalled.  Week ago, in a scene reminding me the Mafia wedding from The Godfather by Mario Puzzo, he publicly gave a present to a boss of organized crime. The present was portrait of the boss as Greek god Zeus.  [Photo of the painting](http://img.cz.prg.cmestatic.com/media/images/original/Feb2014/1621624.jpg?d41d).

* A mistake in new law stopped almost all medical autopsies in the country. The law requires agreement by the deceased (before he died). The pathologists called attention to this problem long ago but nobody listened. Most affected are students and some transplantations. The minister promised speedy change of the law. [Cz](http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/328966-ministerstvo-chce-novelou-obnovit-pocty-pitev.html).

* Life of half year old kid with liver disease was saved thanks to transplantation. His father donated part of his own liver. It was only the 4th such transplantation in the country. [Cz](http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/328855-pulrocnimu-chlapci-otec-daroval-cast-svych-jater-zachranil-mu-zivot.html).

* New research center is being build in Brno, the [Advanced Materials, Structures and Technologies Centre](http://admas.eu/). The project is in danger: it is delayed, investigated for fraud and a controversial politician was selected as its first director. As a result the promised subsidy 818 million CZK (~30 million euro) from EU funds may be lost.

* A local politician complains about conspiracy by his opponents. Leaked documents tell about very generous financial bonuses he gave to his secretary and mistress.  He refuses to publish this information officially, citing some technical problems.

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"The USA has to be our babysitter because in the EU, only the UK and France have capable armies, and even they need at least logistical support from each other and from the US in certain foreign interventions. Other EU countries do follow the rule of minimum 2% GDP for their military budget, like Greece, but those are rather small countries/economies, so ultimately their army isn't that impressive in comparison to those of countries like Russia.

Nonetheless, if we add all our military budgets together, it makes the armies of the EU quite large. But we don't have a common foreign policy, nor a common military command.

I don't think any EU country is at risk of Russian invasion. Russia would be stupid and suicidal to even attempt this. But it's embarrassing to be so weak that when Russia invades Ukraine, we just sit around unable to react in a strong manner. Russia doesn't fear the EU. It fears the US. Luckily for Russian interests, the US is far away from Ukraine, and in the last years has been loosing some interest in Europe.

Despite the willingness of some EU countries (like France and the UK) to intervene militarily in foreign conflicts, the EU is largely a ""soft power"". That's what the ""fuck the EU"" from that leaked American diplomat phone conversation was about. Russia is a hard power. And the US is a hard power. One hard power can only be reasoned with by another hard power.

The EU, though technically a military superpower, and especially the number one economic power, is used to being slapped around by other world powers (China with economic blackmail, Russia with energy and military blackmail, the US with economic and political blackmail... this is sad because if we were truly united, we would be able to counter that shit, and even lead it and do it ourselves to all of them)..

But he was murdered in 1263 in a power struggle and once again we returned officially to being a pagan state. Grand Duke Gediminas already had churches built in 1330-ies. In his letters to western rulers, in 1320-ies he said that we will accept christianity once you will stop pushing it with a sword. The real question was who will we accept christianity from - orthodox Christianity from the eastern parts of the dutchy, or catholicism from Poland or Germans. Since we were at war with the Teutonic and Livonian orders that was out of the question. The the territories in the south east were mostly under control and Russian duchies did not seem to be either strong opponents or valuable allies. So the logical solution was to accept Christianity from Poland and gain an ally. That being said Christianity did not firmly take root for several centuries (at least among the common folk). Most of our festivals still have a lot of pagan traditions, symbolism and lore about them.

tl;dr Lithuanians knew where to get christianity, and did not need anyone to give it to them. Poland just had the best thing to offer in return.

&gt;The t34 was not engineerd in a good way

Well, from all the retarded things you said this one takes the cake, especially because how easily your ignorance can be shoved down your throat. Lets have a quote from [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-34)

*We had nothing comparable. —Friedrich von Mellenthin (Panzer Battles)*

*The T-34 was a Soviet medium tank which had a profound and permanent effect on the fields of tank tactics and design.*

*At its introduction, the T-34 possessed the best balance of firepower, mobility, protection, and ruggedness of any tank (though its initial battlefield effectiveness suffered due to a variety of factors). Its 76.2 mm (3 in) high-velocity gun was the best tank gun in the world at that time; its heavy sloped armour was impenetrable by standard anti-tank weapons; and it was very agile. Though its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war, when they first encountered it in battle in 1941 German tank generals von Kleist and Guderian called it ""the deadliest tank in the world.*

Also tiger I was a heavy tank(t34 was medium) designed and build after nazies encountered soviet tanks. Its superiority over t34 is not a proof of t34 poor design, just germans not being retarded to build a tank that would be easily defeated by cheaper and more mobile tank already present on the battlefield. And lets have a quote from [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_I) as well

*While the Tiger I was feared by many of its opponents, it was over-engineered, using expensive materials and labour intensive production methods. Only 1,347 were built between August 1942 and August 1944. The Tiger was prone to certain types of track failures and immobilizations, and limited in range by its high fuel consumption. It was, however, generally mechanically reliable, but expensive to maintain. It was also difficult to transport, and vulnerable to immobilization when mud, ice and snow froze between its overlapping and interleaved road wheels in winter weather conditions, often jamming them solid. In 1944, production was phased out in favour of the Tiger II.*

&gt;The AK-47 is the same deal really, the main scource of its popularity is the very basic design, its flooded the markets due the Cold war, and being cheaply mass produced. Again its just quantity that has spead the weapons, not the engineering.

You are so inane that you dont even understand that things you are attempting to ignore, the basic design(which also translates in to ease of operability and maintenance with high reliability), cheap manufacturing are what makes the design most popular in the world, thats what makes it great engineering accomplishment. I have no idea how one can act like these things are negative or of no importance when it comes to engineering, I guess chromozone missing or having few extra would explain that. But yeah, lets try to bash the most popular rifle design in the world, #itsaswedething

Like most people, I've been focused on international news and wearily looking at Ukraine, since the boarder isn't THAT far away and I feel it is the most important issue right now. 

As always, our issues always seem kind of pathetic compared to everyone else's.

- Hypo Alpe Adria scandal. A bank lost lots of money, the state is the one that got shafted. Investigating it is going to cost €2million a day or something equally ridiculous.
- People are scared of not having any gas because of Ukraine crisis. Luckily it's a mild winter and Austria tends to have reserves of about 3 months of heavy usage.
- State Opera Ball was on thursday. Richard Lugner, resident Austrian construction magnate who has invited the likes of Pamela Anderson and Paris Hilton before, invited Kim Kardashian, but then a comedian in blackface dressed as Kanye West asked her to dance and someone somewhere said the word nigga and she left. I think it was an excuse to get away from his creepy ass.
- Birds are migrating back to our lakes too early by several weeks, people are scared we might get a cold snap and they'd all die
- There are tax increases for alcohols, cigarettes and other luxuries. Politicians complain we are taxing the most vulnerable members of society. Actually that's mostly because there are increases for cars (low mileage + high horsepower= €€€) too. Salaries can no longer be claimed back in tax returns for businesses for more than half a million. All of this should bring in ~€700 million extra.
- A betting shop was held up by a dude wearing a scream mask. Other customers scared him away.

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; However, I think it's time to admit that ukrainization have failed, it would make sense to let people to use whatever language they want. When Russian-speaking people know that Ukrainian is the official language, they feel like they are second-class citizen in their own country, and this is one of reasons for separatist mood. If both languages were official they could associate with the whole Ukraine more easily.

One thing to remember is that Ukrainian language was dying during Soviet times. The situation was the same in other ex Soviet republics in regards of their languages. Few more decades and Ukrainian language speakers could have become minority in Ukraine. The reason for Ukrainization is to revive Ukrainian language and make sure its continued existence. 

Now you may ask what is the point of keeping Ukrainian language alive - isn't a language just a language? I don't know about your opinion, but many speakers of major Indo-European languages don't recognize the value of different languages - they don't see or understand how language affects everything in the culture and in the way people are and act. Language has value in itself and we as European have value in that we have so many nations and societies build around usage of different languages.

Okey, well again you could ask what does this have to do with Ukrainian language being the official language, and why not have Russia also as an official language... The reason for this is that Russia already exists, it is the Russian state which keeps the Russian language, culture and society alive. Thus the job of Ukrainian state is not to protect Russian language as the Russian state already takes care of it.",0,1393760125,null,0,false,0,cfsdi94,t3_1z9qe7,t1_cfsdi94,t1_cfrurzt,null,1432623155,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

You call a military invasion 'popular uprising'?

&gt;Crimean government asks the Russians for help why would not they help an area that is largely populated by Russians

Because the Crimean government asking for help was an obvious propaganda action and because Russia promised to respect the territorial integrity of the Ukraine.

&gt; Don't the Crimeans have a right to govern themselves also, or does it only work if that government wanted closer ties with the west?

Thing is, that would oppose the Ukrainian constitution and the international guarantees of Ukraine's indivisibility. Even Russia used to falsely claim that it respects Ukraine's indivisibility. So it would not be legitimate. The only legitimate way to go about it is to organize a referendum, but now that option is blurred because the Crimean Rada was taken over by russian forces. 

I bet you know about what is happening in Catalonia, Scotland etc. That is that the people there feel that they need independence and want to create their own, separate nation state. That is not the case with Crimea, as I've mentioned, not only crimean russians don't really want to secede, but the indegenous people (tatars) want to stay with Ukraine. The russians have their nation state already, so it is not about that. It's basically a poor region in Ukraine that Russia is trying to use for strategic gain.

Misc.

* Top news of the week: rich body-builder ""celebrity"" who is on the tabloids every day for his ridiculous antics had his testicle-skin flattened out. Because seriously, what kind of life is one without ironed testicle-skin, really? This guy is pure magic, he is so unimaginably dumb there are no words and he keeps showing up in news every other day. He's like a misogynistic, yuppie Honey Boo-Boo on steroids. If you can read Hungarian, read [this](http://comment.blog.hu/2014/02/27/breking_itt_a_video_berki_kivasalt_hereirol), it's golden. 

* The UEFA Euro 2016 will feature more teams than ever, so everyone is hoping that we can qualify now. Our qualifier group is made up of Greece, Romania, Northern Ireland, Finland and the Faroe. Assuming N-Ir. doesn't surprise us, our qualification will mostly depend on the games against Romania, a long-standing rival of ours. 

* The entire Hungarian Internet had their panties in a bunch after [Buzzfeed published a list about Hungarian foods](http://www.buzzfeed.com/anitabadejo/hungarian-foods-the-world-should-know). The author (a Hungarian-American) was interviewed, because we always get surprised if we receive positive foreign interest. 

* [WSJ did a nice piece on a colorful member of Hungarian politics: the Hungarian Two-tailed Dog Party](http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2014/02/27/hungarys-2-tailed-dog-party-seeks-ballot-space/). They started out as a one-man joke, but grew since and now they want to run at the elections for real. Still unlikely though, their registration request was already twice denied by a judge. We don't have as much humor as the Icelandic :(

----

Economy/Politics

* [State debt is at a record-high](http://www.politics.hu/20140228/state-debt-reaches-record-high/), while [jobless rate at a record low](http://www.politics.hu/20140227/jobless-rate-at-five-year-low/). 

* [In a landmark decision, a court ordered a school run by the Greek Catholic Church to stop segregation against Roma.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26390357) They divided students into classes based on their ethnicity, but officially they dressed it up under random factors, which effectively resulted in the same. Far-right supporters were of course upset again that the filthy anti-Hungarian liberals have won again and everything was just dandy during the segregation.

* A very popular election campaign move among the suburban districts of Budapest is to destroy homeless people's shacks, some that have been standing for 5-10 years in patches of forests in the outskirts of the city. Now [some of them sued District XIV and have won a compensation of 500.000HUF \(~1650€\) each](http://www.politics.hu/20140225/district-told-to-compensate-homeless/). Shacks elsewhere are currently in danger of destruction, mostly because regular voters need to be pleased, and they aren't pleased by seeing those. 

* [Tuesday was the memorial day for the victims of Communism, commemorations were held throughout the country](http://www.politics.hu/20140225/victims-of-communist-dictatorship-to-be-commemorated-tuesday/). 

* [Fidesz is proposing to further cut public utility bills, this time by forcing companies to pay for the base fees](http://www.politics.hu/20140225/fidesz-proposes-reducing-or-scrapping-utility-bill-base-fees/) 

----

Campaign

* Fidesz-linked *NGO* to [arrange yet another Peace March](http://www.politics.hu/20140225/government-linked-ngo-announces-next-peace-march-highlights-accomplishments/), as they did regularly in past years with different themes. This time it's to highlight the accomplishment of the current government and it's scheduled to take place a week before the elections. Opposers like to call this event ""march of sheep"", as the name of the event and that expression sound a lot alike. 

* [Polls show Fidesz and Jobbik gain support, while the leftist alliance stalls.](http://www.politics.hu/20140227/fidesz-jobbik-gain-significant-support-in-poll/) 

* [Jobbik-leader Vona tells Fidesz and leftist leaders to quit with the negative campaigning](http://www.politics.hu/20140228/jobbik-leader-tells-fidesz-socialists-to-stop-playground-scrap-says-party-aiming-to-win-votes-through-positive-campaign/) (and they are sure to listen). Jobbik is running a fairly reserved and quiet campaign by their standards. I think they are assuming that most of their 2010 voters are die-hard fans who will vote for them in every case and now they plan to expand to those who considered Jobbik too radical and scary until now. Personally, I think they are gravely mistaken, in 2010 many voters were driven into a frenzy to vote for them and they did not deliver any of their promises about radical change in politics. They'll lose many of those 2010 voters who have no solid allegiance to anyone or anything but themselves, as Fidesz was doing the ""free money to everyone"" thing pretty successfully this past 4 years. 

* [Leftist alliance front man Bajnai pledges European direction in politics at a rally](http://www.politics.hu/20140227/bajnai-pledges-european-directions-at-election-rally/), while another alliance leader, [Mesterházy promises shorter waiting lists in health care](http://www.politics.hu/20140301/mesterhazy-promises-shorter-waiting-lists-in-health-care/).

EDIT:
Forgot a big one!

* EUStat released a study of regions of the EU28 and their wealth. [4 Hungarian EU-designated regions rank among the 20 poorest](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/1-27022014-AP/EN/1-27022014-AP-EN.PDF), our poorest region is Northern Hungary, raking 9th overall with a score of 40. Out of the 7 regions, only Central Hungary (which consists of Budapest, its metro area and some miscellaneous, generally wealthy towns) exceeds the EU28 standard of living, with a score of 110. One other wealthier region (Western Transdanubia, bordering Austria) scored 68, others are in the 40s and 50s.

true,Wobzter,NETH,Not Luxembourg,"I interpreted it like:
A: X is true, but barely
B: X is likely to be true (rather than A is likely to be true).

I see you're using mathematical notation, so the following should be understandable: It is not true that B \subsection A. Furthermore, whether the conjunction of ""X is true, but barely"" and ""X is likely to be true"" would yield ""X is likely to be true, and if it is, it is only barely true"". Natural language does not work that way. Suppose I say ""I have a cat, but it is almost dead"" and at the same time I say ""I might have a cat, but I don't know"". Although both statements might be true; there is still a contradiction. In statement 2 I have declared that I don't have the information about whether my cat is alive, so I could have never said statement 1 with certainty. So me saying statement 1 does not make sense; I am implying a certainty where there is none. Nor does statement 1 say ""IF I have a cat, it is almost dead""; which would not contradict with statement 2 and be perfectly fine. 

Also, about what the other guy said; he never suggested the answer would be 'A is not true'. He suggested that in order for people to understand what is happening (namely that the results show that 51% are in favour, and that this 51% should be taken with an approximation) that it is better to say that approximately 50% is in favour.

&gt;

&gt;**The Russian Federation has a significant security role in the European energy sector** as the largest exporter of [oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum) and natural gas to the [European Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union). In 2007, the European Union imported from Russia 185 million tonnes of [crude oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_oil), which accounted for 32.6% of total oil import, and 100.7 million [tonnes of oil equivalent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne_of_oil_equivalent) of natural gas, which accounted 38.7% of total gas import. 

&gt;The [Urengoy–Pomary–Uzhgorod pipeline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urengoy%E2%80%93Pomary%E2%80%93Uzhgorod_pipeline) was constructed in 1982–1984 with Western financing to provide Soviet gas to the Western European market. [citation needed]

&gt;The Russian state-owned company [Gazprom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazprom) exports natural gas to Europe. It also controls a [large number of subsidiaries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Gazprom%27s_subsidiaries), including key infrastructure assets. According to the study published by the [Research Centre for East European Studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Centre_for_East_European_Studies), the liberalization of the EU gas market has driven Gazprom's expansion in Europe by increasing its share in the European [downstream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downstream_(petroleum_industry\)) market. It has established sale subsidiaries in nearly all its export markets, and also gained direct access to industrial and power generation sectors in Western and Central Europe. In addition, Gazprom has established joint ventures to build natural gas pipelines and storage depots in a number of European countries.  [Transneft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transneft), a Russian state-owned company responsible for the national oil pipelines, is another important Russian company supplying energy to Europe.

true,Seefor,DENK,Copenhagen,"&gt; But it's hard to deny, the success of Euromaidan was provided by Right Sector. They are responsible for most successful and violent operations.

I don't doubt that the fact that there were certain almost paramilitary right wingers amongst them made them effective in the fighting. However we have no numbers on who participated. Reports I have seen also show a lot of students and normal people joining the sotnya fighting groups.

&gt; There was no re-elections in parliament, hence it's not an example to excuse protesters.

I'm not sure what you mean? That parliament isn't legitimative?  

&gt; It's hard to say, who in reality new government is. If you see list by party affiliations, 2/3 is ""miraculously non-party"". But 3 chairs got by Svoboda, another neonazis. Is this you calling ""moderate""?

Then let's go through them, one by one! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Ministers_of_Ukraine#Cabinet

The cabinet has 17 minister posts, including the PM, and Svoboda holds 4 of these. Obviously we don't need to go through the four Svoboda ministers, since we know their ugly views already. 

Then there are 6 members of Batkivshchyna (Fatherland), which we known is a pro-EU moderate party, so we don't have to go through them either. 

There are 3 Euromaidan activists who have become ministers:

* Health Minister Oleg Musiy was in charge of medical services for protesters during the rebellion. He played a key role in putting in place secret clinics to treat wounded patients. Many young people responded to his call for young medical students to come and help deal with the treatment of protesters.

* Culture Minister Yevgen Nyshchuk a well known actor who played a prominent role in the 2004 Orange Revolution but then kept his distance from politics, apparently disappointed with the results of that uprising. This time he has emerged again as the main speaker and animator for the demonstrators on Independence Square.

* Sports and Youth Minister Dmytro Bulatov was an active member of the so-called ""Avtomaidan"" of activists who used their cars for protests against Yanukovych. He was abducted in January, only reappearing a more than a week later after being tortured and beaten. His case became a symbol of repression of activists.

[Source](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10665800/Ukraines-new-government-Whos-who.html)

None of the above are known to be right wing radicals.

Then there are the non-affiliated:

* Foreign minister Andrii Deshchytsia is a Ukrainian diplomat and politician, who has served as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Ukraine to Finland and Iceland and as Special Representative of OSCE Chairperson-in-Office for Conflict Resolution - Not known to be a right wing radical, and with those credentials it would be very strange if he was. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Deshchytsia). 

* Minister of Finance Oleksandr Shlapak has a distinguished career in Ukrainian finance and economics and has served as a minister and public official in previous governments - Definitely not a right wing radical. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksandr_Shlapak).

* Minister of Economy Pavlo Petrenko is educated in the US, he founded the economic school at the Kyiv Mohyla Academy and until now was head of the Kiev School of Economics - Not known as a right wing radical. [Source](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10665800/Ukraines-new-government-Whos-who.html).

* Education Minister Serhiy Kvit has worked as President of Kyiv-Mohyla University since 2007. The school is considered one of the best in Ukraine, but has not developed much in 2007. **Kvit has been a member of right-wing organizations in Ukraine**, and an ardent enemy of previous Education Minister Dmytro Tabachnyk - Now he is a right winger, although we don't know how much. [Source](http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/op-ed/katya-gorchinskaya-the-not-so-revolutionary-new-ukraine-government-337768.html).

* Minister of Energy is **Russian-born** Yuriy Prodan. He had already been in this job under President Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko in 2007-2010. [Source](http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/op-ed/katya-gorchinskaya-the-not-so-revolutionary-new-ukraine-government-337768.html)

Lastly, even though he is not a member of the cabinet, let's not forget that the President has a lot of power in Ukraine and that he is now [Oleksandr Turchynov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksandr_Turchynov), a moderate from Fatherland, who vetoed the repeal of the minority language law. As a side note, when parliament repealed the minority language law they did so on the promise that a new one would be enacted very soon.

It should also be noted that the powerful post of minister of internal affairs, which you would need to control if you actually wanted to persecute a minority, is held by the moderate Fatherland member Arsen Avakov.

*In conclusion*: Out of a cabinet of 17 posts there are 4 confirmed Svoboda members and 1 other minister, the minister of education, who is a right winger, although we don't know how much. The rest are moderates and pro-western. If anything the will of the new government to sign the EU association agreement should be proof of this, since Svoboda loathes the EU, as all extreme right wingers do. But Svoboda has seats in the cabinet, unfortunately, but that was needed to appease the right wingers. Who knows if they'll even be in the cabinet after the election? Probably not. At the last election they only got 10 % of the votes.

So I ask you, /u/acodered, is this heavily moderate cabinet reason enough to go to war with a brother people, violate another nation's sovereignty and start a new cold war? ",0,1393765201,null,0,1393766711,0,cfseapz,t3_1z9mmg,t1_cfseapz,t1_cfsdzzi,null,1432623528,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Warning: these properties might need a *lot* of work. They'll often be old farmhouses/country houses, tend to be very humid and have old, rudimentary plumbing and heating. Most of the people I know who bought houses like these have spent years renovating them. It's not a bad life, especially if you're willing to learn some construction skills, but it's a huge time- and money-sink.

They're also likely to be extremely isolated, with little to no local commerce - maybe a boulangerie and a bar in the next village, but for everything else you'll probably have to drive an hour to the supermarket.

And of course, the main reason why these are so cheap: there will be almost no jobs to be had around these places, especially as a ""stranger"" (little villages tend to be very insular), unless you want to get into the tourist trade - open a gite or something like that. If you can't work from home, you're looking at an hour-long commute or more to get to the nearest city where you *might* get a job.

 I did a story back in 2012 while on an international semester in Denmark about Iceland's accession issues (went to Iceland for a week to conduct interviews and research). My conclusion was that, and backed up by polls at the time, that the public didn't support accession because of the issues around fisheries. 

We talked to quite a few people involved in the debate (politicians, academics, fisheries representatives, the public). The big fear seemed to be that accession meant losing control of fisheries and some equated that to loss of sovereignty because of the importance the fishing industry has in Iceland. Of course there were the cod wars and the history of asserting your sovereignty for fishing grounds, something you'd not want to loose again. 

I think we talked to one politician and one academic who believed it was in Iceland's long term interests to join the EU, however they were mainly for reasons aside from fishing.

true,NonsensePhilosopher,null,null,"Il problema del signor Rossi è che capisce poco e chi ha scritto l'articolo non è stato molto preciso (correggetemi se eventualmente trovate errori).

Premetto che trovo una stronzata idiota tutto questo meccanismo degli anticipi(inps,irpef ma anche iva!), ritenute d'acconto, iva da pagare prima che uno abbia intascato effettivamente i soldi,ecc... il tutto pensato per confondere e dare lavoro a burocrati inutili.
Rimetterei il tutto in contesto se permettete, di modo che nessuno si faccia idee sbagliate (uno che guadagna 60k fa la fame):

1. Il signor rossi inizia a lavorare a gennaio 2012 con questo contratto da 60k+iva, cifra che molto probabilmente gli sarà pagata in frazioni mensili da 5k *ma con ritardo a 60 giorni o peggio* come da prassi. Quindi c'è già la piccola (dipende dal signor Rossi**[1]**) seccatura di dover versare l'iva prima che questa sia effettivamente sul suo conto corrente.
Ogni mese il committente del signor Rossi, come da fattura di Rossi, trattiene una ritenuta d'acconto del 20% che poi provvederà a versare allo stato a titolo di prima tranche di irpef**[2]**.

2. Il 2012 trascorre tranquillo e pure buona parte del 2013 grazie al contratto rinnovato, quindi a giugno il signor rossi dovrebbe aver fatturato i 60k(-12) del 2012 e i primi 30k(-6) del 2013. Considerando la questione di farsi pagare mensilmente e dei 60g di ritardo nei pagamenti il signor Rossi avrà ricevuto bonifici per un valore di 90k-18k-5k*2=62k (ignoriamo l'iva).

3. E' giugno, momento della prima dichiarazione. A questo punto il signor Rossi deve pagare quanto indicato nell'articolo, ovvero:
 * IRPEF 7.7k + 2.8k anticipo
 * INPS 16.6k + 6.6k anticipo**[3]**
 * Addizionale regionale+comunale irpef 1k

4. A questo punto il signor Rossi paga suo malgrado quei 35623, che andranno ad intaccare i 62k che aveva realmente ricevuto (e che in previsione di tutte queste tasse aveva usato solo parzialmente di conseguenza) e realizza per la prima volta in che paese d'idioti a cui piace complicarsi la vita vive. Potrebbe anche fare qualche considerazione sul fatto che allo stato le tasse vanno anticipate mentre lui viene pagato con mesi di ritardo, curioso.
5. Perplesso il signor Rossi torna a lavorare, quando qualche mese dopo, il commercialista a novembre si ripalesa perchè ci sono altri 11k da pagare e preannuncia un anticipo sull'iva natalizio. A questo punto al signor Rossi sono stati pagati effettivamente ulteriori (5k-1k)*5 =20k che tra questi nuovi anticipi verserà in buona parte allo stato. Dall'inizio della sua avventura, a due anni di distanza, il signor Rossi ha quindi intascato un netto di circa 36k.
6. Dopo un Natale fatto di ulteriori perplessità in cui il signor Rossi medita sul futuro, arriva il 2014. Finalmente il signor Rossi ha un po' di pace, fino a giugno non ci saranno ulteriori rotture e piano piano il conto corrente si riprenderà dalla mazzata di fine 2013.
7. Arriva giugno e il signor Rossi paga nuovamente le solite stronzate, questa volta ridotte di un 30% perchè le tasse si riferiranno al solo anno solare precedente. Il signor rossi paga ancora, pregustando gli imminenti anticipi e spera che nella seconda metà dell'anno vada tutto bene e che il suo reddito sia sempre stabile o crescente**[4]**. Anche perchè, il signor Rossi, al momento non lo tutela nessuno, e se gli capita qualcosa son cazzi suoi.

[1] Il signor Rossi, specie se al primo impiego, potrebbe anche non averli quei soldi

[2] Sempre che il committente sia onesto e non abbia problemi, altrimenti il signor Rossi è fottuto e molto probabilmente passerà molto tempo in tribunale.

[3] Se il signor Rossi avesse guadagnato molto meno (da schiavo), avrebbe potuto avere problemi con il fatto che il versamento minimo che lo stato accetta è di 2.8k. Da versare in ogni caso.

[4] Se il signor Rossi perdesse nella seconda metà dell'anno questa fonte di reddito, sarebbero cazzi.",0,1393766849,null,0,1393771692,0,cfselc0,t3_1zaecl,t1_cfselc0,t3_1zaecl,null,1432623667,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5

Secondo me, quella Russa è solo una dimostrazione di forza e di pressione sulla possibile nuova Ucraina.
Obama dovrebbe saperlo e se non è cagasotto forzerà la mano, tirandosi dietro l'UE.
Fatto questo la Russia tornerà nei confini e l'ONU farà da garante per i Russi Ucraini.
Putin non è scemo, sa benissimo che una guerra contro un blocco USA+UE la perderebbe senza se e senza ma.

Lo so cosa state per dire: ""Eh, ma basta chiuderci il rubinetto del gas e siamo fregati"".
Ultimamente si tende a sopravvalutare la dipendenza dal gas Russo, è vero si che ne importiamo una grossa fetta ma le uniche nazioni del nocciolo duro UE dipenenti da questo sono Italia e Germania e solo intorno al 35%, inoltre da anni si stanno creando, e già esistono, vie alternative per il gas, questa ricerca fatta a Cambridge è molto interessante: http://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/binder13.pdf

Un'altra grossa cosa che non si dice parlando di gas è il fatto che non sarebbero solo gli europei a soffrirne, ma anche la Russia stessa che perderebbe una grossa fetta di introiti.

Continuando sul lato economico, la Russia non è più nel 1980, ormai ha scelto la via capitalista, se UE e USA farebbero muro verrebbe tagliata fuori da un mercato enorme, dovendosi per forza di cose rivolgersi all'Asia, e se escludiamo la Cina che resterebbe linkata al mercato mondiale (Perchè mi pare ovvio che la Cina in tutto questo se ne starebbe buona per fatti suoi, al massimo farebbe qualche movimento politico nell'ONU ma non si sognerebeb mai di entrare in guerra), si ritroverebbe con perdite economiche ingenti, di tutto questo ovviamente approfitterebbero tutti i movimenti anti russi sul territorio e molte nazioni cercherebbero di togliersi dall'influenza russa, sarebbe un disastro.

Se continuiamo a parlare ancora per assurdo e arriviamo ad un conflitto armato, la Russia si ritroverebbe con un esercito non al passo con i tempi che dopo la caduta dell'URSS ha subito tagli enormi, un esercito buono giusto per tenere a bada quei quattro conflitti nei balcani, niente di più.",0,1393766958,null,0,false,0,cfsem3b,t3_1zc7qv,t1_cfsem3b,t3_1zc7qv,null,1432623676,11,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,11

No, people really are turned off by war. The idea of Britian ruling the waves and engaging in forgien adventures is over for the average joe. Even Syria which is nothing but a bloodbath got no support for the government.

We all have nukes though, so I don't really see how war can ever actually break out without everyone dying.

Ukraine - topic of the week

* First time ever major opposition party leader (PiS) and Prime Minister (from PO) praise themselves for support to Ukraine and speeches done. There's a huge political mobilization to do everything they can in order to help Ukraine, with some voices here and there from various opposition politics that not enough is being done.

* Tons of news about various Ukrainians we've seen in the news, eg. girl from ""[I am a Ukrainian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hvds2AIiWLA)"" video. 

* Various news about ""who-talked-with-who"" about Ukraine. 

* Lots of noise from opposition party about Polish Foreign Minister telling Ukrainians ""they'll be all dead"" unless agreement between opposition and (now former) government will be signed. General consensus in the end was that this agreement stopped bloodshed, however in Euromaydan threw it out of the window for total revolution.

---

Politics

* There's still no decision about Trynkiewicz - a pedophile and murderer who got an amnesty back in 1990 (after Poland got out of eastern block regaining democracy) and was released last month after sitting 25 years in jail. There was a huge public debate whatever a person like that should be allowed to go free. Government passed a law allowing permanent detention in psychiatric clinic for people who might threaten lives of others which not only is very controversial, but many argue it's both: against constitution and cannot be applied to the person that already went free.

* [Drunk Protasiewicz incident](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1z2ppc/vice_president_of_the_eu_parliament_jacek/). Eventually guy stepped down from some of his positions. Many wonder if that's an end of his political career.

* Some news about opposition party PiS leading election polls. Poland will have parliament elections in next year, and European elections this year, so it's a hot topic every week.

* Mr. Macierewicz insists that Polish State Commission on Aircraft Accidents Investigation should again investigate [Polish President airplane crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Polish_Air_Force_Tu-154_crash). Mr. Macierewicz is famous from leading his personal / PiS-supported investigations on that airplane accident (President that died in it was from PiS) often leading to some hilarious suggestions (let's see what we had till now... Russian helium bombs, Russian micro-explosions on an airplane wings, artificial fog (created by ""unknown parties"" (implied: Russians)), Polish Prime Minister intentionally leading to death of a President, some simulations that neither he or his team wanted to publish, expertises about airplane wing resistance to the crash with a tree made on a Red Bull can, and so on and so on... too many to list, really). Oh, and BTW: He is a vice-chairman of PiS which is about to win next elections, as mentioned earlier. 

* Few stories about accidents in hospitals (newborn deaths, elderly woman having her pancreas removed instead of cancer tumor) and overall poor state of public health care.

* Polish Ministry of Defense signed contract for purchase of training jets and simulators. Winning bidder is [Aermacchi M-346](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alenia_Aermacchi_M-346_Master) - till 2017 Poland will get 8 jets with an option to purchase additional 4.

* This week we also had a national memorial day of a [cursed soldiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursed_soldiers) - if you got some time I recommend reading through their history, it's really fascinating.

---

Sport 

* Lots of praise for our Winter Olympics - how despite of horrible conditions they managed to achieve more in this year then ever before in a history of winter games. Pictures of sportsmen being welcomed by crowd on airports, etc. etc.

* Updates on how our Ski Jumping team is doing - ski jumping is a sport of a year (fun fact: Poles randomly change their beloved disciplines each time someone achieves a fancy title). Robert Stoch is still leading World Cup. Poles rejoice.

* Some more news about Polish Pathetic Football Teams &amp; Representation(tm). As usually: Nothing good happened this week. For Euro 2016 Poland will play in group D with Gibraltar. Half of Poles joke about them - the other half jokes about Polish representation loosing to Gibraltar. Memes fill the internet. In either case though - there's not a chance Poles will go out of group stage.

---

Misc:

* Jokes about Tax Offices giving awards for filling in tax declarations.  In Wrocław you can win a car. How awesome is that?

* Polish network of animal ambulances is growing.

* Some Pole made a Violin out of 16 000 matches.

* Man in Nowy Sącz went to jail for killing bees.

* 5 years old kid jumped out of the window on a 4th floor. Luckily - he survived, just shocked by a whole situation.

* 12 yo ski jumper got an accident, ended up in a pharmacological comma for a few days. In the end though he woke up and his life is not threatened any more.

* Someone made a statistics of suicides in Poland. Seems like most per 1000 citizens happen in Górny Śląsk voivodeship - that's the one famous from coal mines and highest population density (it's basically a cluster of several cities). Seems like coal mines and plenty of neighbors make you kill yourself.

* According to catholic church 3% of poles live in concubinage.

* Afghan war veteran went through successful hand transplantation (Polish hospitals got quite a lot of experience in transplantations - we even had one of the first complete face transplantations in Europe).

I understand that Latvian citizens of Russian origin in Latvia may feel threatened, but you wouldn't go to Denmark or Britain and expect Russian-language schools funded by the state. The fact that Russians are 25%-30% of the population doesn't change things - those who want citizenship and to participate in the political process should learn some Latvian history and language, and pass the citizenship test - it isn't that hard, and you can certainly do it in the more than 20 years that have passed since independence.

As for ""West or East, all governments are corrupt"" - that's an unfair comparison, because the Latvian government and the EU is nowhere *near* as corrupt and repressive as Putin's government. Journalists don't get shot to death here for exposing corruption, anti-government/anti-war demonstrations aren't broken up(like happened today in St. Petersburg and Moscow), anti-corruption bloggers and political ""threats""(like Navalny) don't get put under house arrest and banned from using the internet.

So (ethnic) Latvians are suspicious of Russian state propaganda, which many ethnic Russians in Latvia watch and take in, (ethnic) Latvians are suspicious of Saskaņas Centrs (Harmony Center) because it has an official cooperation agreement with Putin's United Russia party... Latvians are suspicious, and for good reason. It's hard to trust Russia. Sorry. Ethnic Russians will not have Russian as a second language in Latvia while Latvia is an independent, unoccupied country, sorry.

But guess what?

Right-wing nationalists decided that it was a symbol of gays as repetitively burned it during each march. [Here is their joy last time on 11th of November - independence day](http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/0/14936/m14936670,KLM-9109A.jpg). Poor flowers.

&gt; Czech technical schooling is in tatters. The Ministry fights this decline by requirement that all teachers need to have formal pedagogic education. Now about 7 thousand of people - mostly elder technical specialists - are in danger of being forced out of schools.

Poland implemented the same law few years ago. Don't worry - everything ended up well. Few people lost a job (my uncle included) but eventually situation settled down. Schools handled it just fine.

Cyprus is divided in half and the northern part is de facto controlled by Turkey (and the Turks and Greeks hate each other). And Malta is Malta - a tiny island surrounded by sea, without external, angry neighbors.

Furthermore, it was Latvians who originally fought and died for a free, independent Latvia. The German elite didn't need an independent Latvia, they were alright in the Russian empire. Nor did Jewish people, or Russians. They were all content with the status quo. Which is fine - that was their decision. Latvians decided that they wanted to have a free country, to be able to shape their own destiny and not have to live as serfs in their own native land.

I don't dislike Russians as a people. I am half Russian myself. But I have made a choice, that I don't want to have or support Russian culture in Latvia. Dostoevsky, Pushkin and Maslenitsa are wonderful, of course, but the culture of *blat* and corruption in Russia, the militarism, imperialism, and maximalism - no, I cannot and won't support that. Lets celebrate Maslenitsa and Lieldienas, and Jāņi and Ivan Kupala, that would probably be the first steps towards reapproachment.

In regards to the press, the pressure to conform in America is very strong, but the simple fact that conspiracy theorists and such can crank out their newsletters, for example, or Noam Chomsky can openly criticize the government for years and years and continue serving in high-level university positions, puts the USA very far ahead of Russia and even some EU countries (including Latvia). The US laws have definitely become more restrictive and repressive over the last years, that I admit. And I don't think it's good.

But in a country as small as Latvia, I believe allowing Russian as a second national language would create two parallel societies(like in Belgium), not improve the situation.",0,1393777434,null,0,false,0,cfshd5j,t3_1zc3hl,t1_cfshd5j,t1_cfsgs1f,null,1432625040,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

Oui, les russes ont quelques divisions bien équipés. Je ne vois pas en quoi ça contredit l'obsolescence et le manque d'entraînement d'une grande partie du reste de leur armée...

Enfin, les armes légères ne sont pas un indicateur de la puissance militaire d'une armée. Les multiplicateurs de puissance comme les capacités de commandement, de logistique et de communication, l'entraînement des troupes, etc... comptent bien d'avantage.

Oh and they surround Kaliningrad.

Ukraine joining NATO would be far, far worse for Russia.

true,sterio,ICEL,"Icelandic, living in the Netherlands","&gt;I'd be interested in hearing what those who believed that Iceland's long-term interests would be served by joining the EU said.

As a person who's strongly in favour of Iceland joining the EU, I'll try to answer to your question: I have no idea what a ""deal"" on fisheries would look like, but I'd break the issue into two pieces:

* Sustainability: I agree that the CFP seems like an absolute mess and our system (as messy as it can be) seems to be much better and more thought through. It currently looks (from my non-expert point of view) like the EU is moving closer to Iceland on fisheries and my hope is that as members ""we"" could bring our expertese and insights to the table on the shaping of future EU fisheries policies.

* Ownership: To be honest I don't really care whether Icelanders or foreigners own the fishing companies (Icelandic companies fish all over the Atlantic anyway). That, however, seems to be what the fishing lobby is fighting for. They want to maintain the laws limiting foreign involvement in the fishing industry.

While some sort of ""deal"" related to sustainability might be reached in negotiations between Iceland and the EU, a deal on ownership will probably never be reached. If you want to maintain legislation limiting foreign involvement in fisheries you should probably not be interested in joining the EU. I put quotation marks around ""deal"" because I don't know what the deal would actually be. I imagine it might involve the introduction of some new laws or regulations on fisheries management at the EU level. These rules might initially only apply to Iceland but might eventually extend to other areas as well. I honestly don't know!

Having said that, all those things are relatively minor factors in my views on membership. To me Europe is not about specific economic advantages or disadvantages. To me Europe is an idea, it's a community, and I feel like I'm a member of that community. The EU is the political representation of the community that is Europe and for that reason more than any other I want Iceland to join the EU.

Our current situation feels a bit like not being able to have a say on how your city is governed because you live in the wrong street. Iceland's a part of Europe and so I want Iceland to be a part of the EU.

Latvia's Russian ""nationalists"" are concentrated in Riga, where the bulk of Latvia's non-citizens live. The share of Russians in Latvia, as of the last census in 2011, is 27%, vs. ethnic Latvians at 62%. Emigration rates are high, but the larger part of emigrants are ethnic Russians, and the fertility rates of ethnic Latvians are higher than those of ethnic Russians.

And, although most Russians here watch and are tuned into Russian, pro-Kremlin media, there is a small but vocal contingent that oppose getting closer to Russia as a country. And, of course, there are many Russians that are loyal to Latvia and consider it their home.

Russian tanks might quickly roll into and occupy Latvia, but I doubt that NATO would not do anything. First of all, if Russia decides to invade Latvia, they would have to invade Estonia as well (at a minimum), to deny forces coming from Finland or Sweden. Second, they might take our two countries, but that's what our military exercises with NATO's Rapid Reaction Force this past autumn were for - to quickly react to any aggression and drive any invading force out.

Finally, it'll just be damn *difficult* for Russia to hold Latvia, and Crimea, and the Caucasus, and wherever else. Their forces would be overstretched - they had a lot of trouble holding Chechnya, a territory with 1.3 million people, and can only do so with the help of a local strongman(Ramzan Kadyrov). Latvians who fought alongside Germans in the closing days of WWII held onto the Western part of Latvia until the bitter end - in fact, forces in the Courland pocket surrendered one day *after* the rest of the German forces.

four east-central European states which are to the West of Ukraine are NATO members. BUT the EU can't just run around screaming bloody murder at Putin because then these four states would be doomed. They get most of their energy from Russian natural gas imports. The EU leaders have to look at their own situation as well, not just Ukraine's. The majority of EU states have some kind of energy agreement with Russia; the only lucky ones are those with access to the oil/natural gas trapped under the North Sea. 

There is also no unified hierarchical military in Europe. The EU has certain ""battlegroups"" most of which are busy fighting small insurgent circles in Africa (their training ground basically). It shows that the EU really never thought of a situation in which another war on the continent could erupt, because there haven't been many efforts - especially since the Recession - to advance military unification.

As far as Cameron and the Brits go, I like their method: whenever things get too heated in Europe, pretend like Britain is 20 miles off the coast of the US, not France. I get where the Brits are coming from, since Europe has been nothing but a pain in their ass for the past century.

This is a make-it-or-break-it moment for Europe: the EU will either broker some kind of peace between Russia and the Ukraine, or will fail miserably like it did during the Yugoslav Crisis which led to the Wars. 

Basically, European leaders aren't very vocal about it because there would be too much to lose if they were to support Ukraine and, since Ukraine isn't a part of the EU, they simply have to prioritize their national interests as well as that of the EU over Ukraine.

&gt; Die Aufständischen, die in Homs ausharren, hatten sich in den vergangenen Tagen skeptisch zu dem Angebot der Regierung geäußert. Sie rechnen damit, dass die Regierungsarmee nach einem Abzug der Frauen und Kinder noch erbarmungsloser vorgehen könnte. 


entsprechende Angebote gab es seitens der Regierung seit über einem Jahr.


Vermutlich haben die Rebellen in Geneva einen ordentlichen tritt in den Hintern bekommen, damit sie dem endlich zustimmen.

true,ChateauLafite1827,null,null,"I just got back from a week long trip to Paris! I booked my trip through a travel agent friend who suggested a four day 'Paris Pass' which get's you admission to most of the attractions you've listed. It was expensive (about $75 US), but I thought it was totally worth it as it includes the ticket price and you can skip the line in most cases (mine also included an unlimited 5 day metro pass, also totally worth it). I went during 'off season' but I didn't wait in line for ANY attraction covered by Paris Pass, including the Louvre, Arc de Triomphe, Versallies, d'Orsay, and many others. You can [buy it from their website](http://www.parispass.com/?aid=25&amp;gclid=COKcz7TJ9LwCFaVxOgodLEcABw), or you can also get it from one of their locations once you are in town.

Paris Pass doesn't cover the Eiffel Tower so I booked a separate reservation for that. I still had to wait in a line since they can only fit so many people in the elevators, still it was MUCH shorter than the regular line - I waited about 15 minutes, the regular line was over an hour. Again, totally worth it.

Paris Pass also doesn't cover the Catacombs, and they do not do reservations. The first time I went was about mid day on a Thursday and the line was around the block. I decided to come back when they opened the next day, but even before opening the line was actually even longer than before. I went one last time on a Sunday about 40 minutes after opening. The line was slightly shorter than the first time and the total wait was a little over an hour. It was my last day in Paris and I had nothing else to do.

true,Baxaxaxa,ANAR,☭ INTERNATIONALISM ☭,"&gt; every communist who has ever took power

A communist taking power is like a pacifist going on a killing spree. Communism and capitalism are not just subjective vessels that can be thrown around as emotional accusations, and I honestly do not care about the various ideological conceptions men have created about themselves and their relation to the world. Communism and capitalism are very objective and material sets of social relations. As long as commodity production exists capitalism exists, no matter whether the private capitalists or the state control the means of production. Makhnovist Ukraine was communist, the Russian invader never was, and I do not say this because idealistically Stalinist Russia was 'bad' and communism is supposed to be 'good', but because the organization of production in Russia was blatantly capitalist, and Lenin knew it from the beginning. The Spanish revolutionaries of 1936 genuinely created communism, which can only be a project built by the working class from the bottom up, and they were crushed by Stalinism and fascism alike. It's very simple if you look at material reality.

&gt;multitude of communist organisations throughout the world at the time often pledged direct allegiance to these people or their organisations. 

You are thinking of Leninist organizations, Leninism being a pseudo-Marxist doctrine that came into existence after the failure of the Russian Revolution of 1917. Leninism argues for a state-controlled capitalism and has little to do with communism. Various (classical) Marxist organizations opposed Stalinism from the beginning.

&gt;The idea behind communism might be great,

Communism is not an 'idea'. The only one who can be accused of *idea*lism here is you. Communism is not something to be 'implemented' but is a historical phase that comes into existence due to a certain level of development of the forces of production, not because a few people think it is a 'good idea'. Self-proclaimed communists building state capitalism have nothing to do with communism whatsoever beyond the realm of ideas, and their historical mission is not determined by what they would want it to be, but by the way in which the relations of production whereupon all of society is predicated are laid out. Mao was a bourgeois revolutionary who led China through the revolutionary period between feudalism and capitalism. You can indignantly call Mao a communist if you want, but material reality does not care about what you think Mao is, or what Mao thinks himself to be, and the victims of some guy who objectively ran a state-capitalist regime are not objectively victims of communism. If Mao says he wants to 'implement' communism but instead vastly expands capitalist wage labour relations in China then I really don't care about what he claims. It is not a matter of some vague, elusive theodicee that  communists ended up implementing capitalist relations of production in the 20th century and subsequently killed millions in line with the other capitalist regimes, it is because 'communists' who 'take power' are silly adherents to 'Marxism-Leninism', which was the official state religion of Stalinist Russia, and as such it is because these people who think taking power is in any way a communist strategy are idiots. Mao was like the French revolutionary proclaiming liberty, equality and brotherhood but in reality laying the foundation for a society in which children get eviscerated by machines, Africans get their hands chopped off for not being good slaves, women die before the age of 25 from overwork because the capitalist doesn't want to pay them a decent wage, strikers whose only choice is between starvation and resistence get mercilessly slaughtered while Jay Gould is allowed to make casual jokes about it, tens of millions of Indians die from deliberately induced famines, millions of families suffer under extreme squalor and the children of France die of malnutrition while Napoleon III sends his obedient proles to fight Bismarck's obedient proles, and millions more obedient proles keep killing each other to satiate the imperialist hunger of their master, up until today, yet no one blames 'liberty, equality and fraternity' for any of this. That is because these are mere ideals, and they should not be blamed. The lesson of Marx which the French Revolutionary did not know and which Mao the 'Marxist-Leninist'(tm) ignored was that the world does not change because some guy in power wants it to change, but because the social relations of production are laid out in such a way that a particular path forward becomes the imperative. What matters is the mode of production, and if the mode of production in Russia of China or anywhere else was capitalist, then this can not be blamed on communism. Any 'regime' with a strong bureaucratic state can not be communist at all, because if communist relations of production actually existed then states would have no economic base and no function in society. If communism would have actually happened and subsequently gone wrong because of 'human nature' or any such woo liberal folk wisdom bullshit then I would agree with you, but if some guy claims to 'implement' communism and subsequently does the exact opposite, or even commits a coup against communism (like in Spain and Ukraine) then there is no reason for me to agree with you. An idealist telling a Marxist how society evolves is really quite like a creationist lecturing an atheist on the origins of the humanity.

Yes, until now.

&gt;but what else?

Not much else, they just present themselves as the guardian of northern regions interests and autonomy but even if they say they'd like to turn Italy in a federal republic they were always unable to present a credible plan.

&gt; what he wants to change?

From the strictly political point of view, only change (slightly?) the election rules i guess. More generally, in his past political programs he always had a wide range of ideas, sometimes clashing with one another, so who knows what he really plan to do. We'll see.

&gt; to lower taxes and make the Italian State smaller?

Yes, at least it seemed, and it didn't reach 2% in the past elections (Fare). Nice ideas, beautifully structured but with some ""shady"" characters in the party and a project too innovative for this country.
Also, you are correct, Forza Italia or any of the other right wing parties don't care about that, sometimes they say they do, but it's clearly not true. That doctrine is not popular. At least in my opinion, people want a big/fat state.

&gt;What they want?

A lot of unrelated, conflicting and badly thought things. They are just angry and feel rightly cheated by the politicians that controlled the country for the last 20-30 or so years. Sadly, anger without any ability to move on and build a new way for this country is useless. Also, Beppe and his friend are clearly making a living out of the money they do as side-effect of being the movement leaders (books, dvds, crappy shows), thing that i dislike quite a bit.

&gt; What is the plan?

No plan. Just yelling waiting for someone to solve theirs/ours problems, they are unable to do anything different. But everyone is a swindler but them, so i don't know who this ""someone"" could be. They'll just go on yelling until they will dissolve as a movement and will be forgotten by history.

&gt; the senator lose its mandate?

No, they will do what they want.

&gt;Was Beppe funnier when he was a comedian or is he funnier now?

I remember, as a kid, thinking that he was the crappiest comedian i'd ever seen in my short life. So, i don't think he improved much, same style, same shit for idiots.

&gt; I am somewhat a Social Liberal, does any political group in Italy claims to follow that? The Centro Democratico seems to be, but they are really small, is social liberalism that unpopular in Italy?

Dir scheint nicht bewusst zu sein, dass es in Saudi-Arabien amerikanische Stuetzpunkte gab. **Edit:** Als man Saudi-Arabien noch nicht so hochgeruestet hatte, dass sie eine schlagkraeftige Opposition zum Iran bilden, war es naemlich fuer die Saudis opportun die Amerikaner im Haus zu haben, falls es doch mal kracht. Moeglich waere es also, dass man dort interveniert. Und es gibt noch andere Beispiel wo Regimes bewusst gestuetzt wurden. Suedafrika zum Beispiel.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"There's a lot of little words which are spelled differently. It's not just the normal centre, metre, litre, colour, labour armour ones, centralise, mobilise, dehumanise, words which are different. There's a whole range of spelling differences which normally don't follow a rule. There's even some grammar differences like the wider use of collective nouns for organisations in the BE verses singular nouns for organisations in AE

When you're brought up speaking a dialect of English other than American, you stop even noticing how different US and British English are because you just become so used to seeing American spellings all over the place. British people on British websites will occasionally end up using American spellings because they're so used to using AE on the Internet. (As a little side note, a lot of famous British books, [like Harry Potter](http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/books/differences.html) when they move over to America get translated with the appropriate spellings and [euphemisms](http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/books/ps/differences-ps.html), but basically all the books in my local libraries from American authors are written with American spellings, and haven't been translated). 

So yeah, BE and AE are actually a lot more different than people usually give them credit for, it's just that the world media usually never uses BE (except in very isolated instances like in British newspapers which're online) so Americans aren't often fully exposed to the difference (not blaming you, it's just that it's seldom used) and the British tend not to even notice spellings anymore because we're so surrounded by it.

La dissolution de l'euro permet d'augmenter les exportations intracommunautaires et d'arrêter de se faire cannibaliser par l'Allemagne et les autres pays européens.

C'est mieux comme ça ?

&gt; Pourquoi ne pas proposer une harmonisation de la politique fiscale pour éviter le dumping social et la delocalisation a l'intérieur de la zone euro ?

Peut être parce que ça fait 30 ans que cette promesse n'est pas tenue, [qu'on continue d'accueillir des pays de plus en plus pauvres](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adh%C3%A9sion_de_la_Croatie_%C3%A0_l'Union_europ%C3%A9enne) qui à leur tour nivellent par le bas.

La décision par laquelle l’administration refuse le bénéfice du regroupement familial à deux époux présents sur le territoire français, n’a, par elle-même, ni pour effet, ni pour objet de séparer les époux. Elle ne méconnaît donc pas, à cet égard, les stipulations de l’article 8 de la CEDH.

And as far as the Russians are concerned: even though no one likes it, we're still dependent on them for gas. No one wants to come off too strong, because we need them. Easy as that. But, Russian dominance on the global geopolitics scheme is coming to an end, thanks to developments like shale gas. After the gas crisis in the EU a couple years ago policy makes here realised we are far too reliant on Russian gas and began to diversify.

So, Russia holds its strong position thanks to its vast amount of resources, which is great for them now but also a huge liability for them towards the future. Balance of power on the geopolitics board will shift/is shifting from US-EU-Russia to US-EU-China in a couple of decades, provided the EU integrates more (which *will* happen if Russia keeps on pulling shit like this).

The Guardian seems to base most of its arguments off of ideals that sway with public opinion. Just one month ago it was talking about how the UK should make major cuts to defense, now its printing condescending comments about how Libya strained British capabilities.

In my opinion, what is relevant now is not what I would do or the EU should do. I have no training in international diplomacy or in political sciences, so I do not want to throw you my worthless opinion on how to solve this dramatic crisis. 

What is relevant is that 

* since the start of this crisis I have not yet seen a public declaration from an EU official with some role in foreign relationship. Zero declarations from Catherine Ashton, José M. Barroso or Herman Van Rompuy.

* the lack of a coordinated response from EU might also be the effect of the slow speed of the complex political machinery of the Union, which brings another point relevant for this discussion, which is the state of EU governance. We might have some reaction in the incoming days (I hope) but you see that the reaction time is slow compared to other political entities.

* the fact the EU cannot react quickly pushes even more single-member state to try to solve a matter like this one independently, without coordination. This means that the EU de-facto looses bargaining power.

1) Museum pass.  [This](http://en.parismuseumpass.com/) is the one we used.  But there are a few others to choose from I think.  It is your ticket into many museums and attractions (see website) which means you skip the ticket lines.  Those are the ones that take so long.  If you even have to wait in line at all, it's just to have your bag looked at or just to flash your pass at a ticket person and go in.  So 5 minute wait time max (unless you're going inside the palace of justice or w/e to see Sainte Chappelle, that's another story.  tsa style security there.  long slow line).

2) Get. there. early.  If it's a place that doesn't take the museum pass or you opt out of it, go early.  If it's a popular place and you really want to see it, look up the time that they open and get there before then.  Make it the first stop of your day.  Then plan the rest of your day around that.

Honestly, I would skip going to the top of the Eiffel Tower unless you just really want to do it.  I don't think you're missing out if you don't.  I didn't do it and I don't regret it one bit.  Especially not after I saw the line and found out it was at least a 3 hour wait.  The Arc d'Triomphe has great views and is covered under the museum pass.  Tour Montparnasse also has great views (even of the Eiffel Tower) and is not to expensive and usually doesn't have a huge wait time I think.

The Louvre does have a few entrances that aren't very well known so that will help get you in a little faster, but after you have your bags scanned, you still have to go wait in line to purchase tickets.  So again, museum pass is handy.  Though not necessary.

For the catacombs, your only solution is to get there early.  Passes don't get you in and it's a popular attraction.  They can only let a certain number of people inside at once so once they fill up, you have to stand around and wait for people to slowly make their way through.  The first time we tried to go, it was like 3 in the afternoon and the line was wrapped waaaaaaay around the block.  There was a guy there that worked in the catacombs who told us they close at 4:30 (or something like that, don't remember exactly) but that the line was closed.  So a few days later we got there a good bit before they opened one morning and were probably 25-30 people from the front of the line.

Don't be a tourist. Don't be loud and obnoxious. Be courteous, assimilate into local culture and customs. Remember, you are a guest, so behave and do as the Romans do. Don't speak English to everyone (other than your friends). Learn basic French. If you have basic manners/etiquette, learn some of the language, and avoid doing the negative things Americans are renowned for, i.e., speaking exclusively in English, being loud, and getting drunk, then you should be fine. Also, a dead giveaway of being American is walking around with a beverage/food in your hand as well as having a backpack. This is a quintessentially American thing. No one else anywhere does it. Americans have a bad rep as being terrible tourists pretty much anywhere, so break the rule by being an exception. Do this and you should be more or less welcomed. Just remember Americans are incredibly sweet and friendly, so what may come off as cold and distant to you is the norm everywhere else but in North America.  Especially in Paris. Parisians are notorious throughout France for being cranky, bitter assholes, so expect as much. It isn't personal, it's just what the city does to you. It's like Manhattan. Oh, and another thing. Don't talk to strangers. Don't engage in friendly small talk. That just isn't a part of Parisian culture, or French culture, for that matter. You talk the strangers if you NEED to. It's just how it is, and like all things, has its pros and cons. One more thing. Tipping isn't a thing in France like it is here. You would leave a euro or two, maybe, but the whole 15+% is non existent. It already comes in their higher wages. Don't let waiters con you into tipping a lot, they WILL abuse your obliviousness as a tourist. Also, drinks aren't refilled. You pay for one drink. Want more? Pay for another. Only water is free, unless you want to pay for fancy bottled water. And French people hate ice in their drinks. In fact, ice in drinks is another American thing. Don't ask for ice. They will laugh at you. You also can't take food home. Didn't finish? Too bad! There are no doggy bags in France. Finally, portions in America are monstrous. Americans eat WAY TOO MUCH. What you are used to as a normal portion, from coffee to soda to pasta, is easily thrice the amount of even the biggest size everywhere else. Just know this.

Also, doesn't matter if you made a lot of money without going through illegality: money is seen like the devil and if you're rich it's because you broke the law somehow. They're going to tell people that newspapers are biased, all of them and always while ""the web"" is the TRUE source of information, which is fuckin' stupid. Yeah, because Grillo's blog is TOTALLY unbiased, sure. They make a lot of misinformation and they have been laughed at for this a lot of times but doesn't matter because people, a lot of them, are going to blindly follow them. Most of the time, they're kids who understand nothing about politics or grown men who sucked at school and can't even write in proper Italian. Their influence on the web is astounding: grillinis are going to share picture with stupid caption about how politicians are bad (and they're not) without even looking at the source. The situation is dangerous when we talk about science. They believe in chem trails, biowashballs, sirens, and other stupid conspiracy theories, also they know nothing about economics and have stupid plans which would make Italy fail. Probably a lot of them is even against animal testing (experimenting medicines on animals, don't know the correct term) but they do make use of medicines. Beware of them, they are good at making people with no general knowledge think that they're the good and the others are bad. Sheeps are sheeps.
There's a lot more to say and maybe I'm going to add something later. Sorry for my English by the way, I've been drinking a little tonight and currently I'm on the comedown, not completely sober yet.

Edit: also, they claim they are ""the movement of the people"" (not true by the way because 2 of 3 Italians did not fucking vote for them so gtfo and don't vouch for me, you do not represent me) but whenever you're going to have a different opinion, you're fired from the party and the majority of people are going to insult them and say that they say those things because of money. They're not democratic at all. This is the case of the 4 senators expelled and they just said they did not approve the manners used and that they wanted to discuss with other parties about laws. 
And they also claim that ""the web"" is going to make decision through their online polls, and they make this as a pride for them, something they call ""direct democracy"". Yes, except there are only about 40 thousands voters on their polls and they were elected with over 9 million votes. How stupid and ridiculous is that?

[Munich](http://www.muenchen.de/int/en/sights/attractions.html) is orderly. Very Orderly. Observe the locals on the street. Do what they do. Don't cross the street when the don't walk sign is on. Stay out of the bike lanes, unless you are on a bike! (Munich is Bike friendly. I recommend renting!) Consideration is the name of the game, and people take it seriously.

The trains are perfect. I recommend using them. Regional trains, street cars, and U Bahn. You can get anywhere!

Insofern hege ich ein wenig zweifel dran ob das Referendum sauber ablaufen wird, da würde ich ja gern die OSZE einschalten.

I have to completely disagree.  I've been to both Paris and NYC... both places I felt like the people who lived there were actually very welcoming.  (any time I needed help or had questions or screwed up my already horrible French, they seemed happy to help.  a lady at a fruit stand even taught me a few new words and thanked me for trying.  the lady who worked the bakery down the street... well, we weren't able to communicate through words very well at all, so we ended up having this weird sort of charade/sign language interaction every time and neither of us could stop laughing.)  They just tend to keep to themselves and, especially in Paris, there are a few minor cultural differences that can make things a little hard to understand sometimes if you aren't aware of them to begin with.  But to go to Paris acting like you expect everyone to be a bitter asshole?  No.  Don't do it, please.  It really isn't true for the most part.  True that they generally seem not to be fond of small talk with random strangers, but that doesn't make them rude.  I don't care much for it either.

But yes, do try to blend in where you can.  Don't be loud and annoying.  Do try to learn basic French and use it as much as possible while there.  But after all, you are a tourist.

But specifically about your points.

The nationalists haven't taken over the government. The new cabinet that was formed does contain representatives from the nationalist (Svoboda) party, and while I like those guys no more than Sverigedemokraterna or any other nationalist party (that is, not at all), they are not in control. They do have some parliament seats from the last election, and now some government positions unsurprisingly, but the most important people now (Yatsenyuk, Turchynov, Avakov) are all from Tymoshenko's party.

Early elections were called and the current government itself says that it's transitional. Early elections would of course give everyone the chance to have their say, but saying that some part of Ukraine had less say in this is not really true. Recent developments have been passed by the Parliament which is still the same as after previous elections, but the notable change is because a lot of Party of Regions members left the party and no longer side with Yanukovich.

Immediately voting to repeal the minority language law was wrong, as it's definitely not a priority anyway, but somehow nobody seems to mention that the repeal was vetoed by Turchynov, and the minority language law is still the same as it was.

*""Territorial integrity of Ukraine""* is truly a new idea on the historical timeline.  This thing called ""Ukraine"" was never a major empire in history and did not appear on the map of Europe at all until the 19th century.    Most of northwestern Ukraine was Poland, until very recently.

I respect the ""Far right""  Nationalists who hail from the western side of Ukraine. And I respect their desire for autonomy from Russian influence.  Those groups really feel this is  ""their time to shine"", and it is.  This is their revolution.     Their treatment under Stalin, and the showtrial to imprison Tymoshenko deserves all the revenge they deliver now.

But where does this end?   Should the new, independent nationalist Ukraine invade  autonomous oblasts?  Why stop there?    Why not station troops in  Abkhazia?    Take over Sochi?    Why not invade Egypt?

Nationalist Ukraine needs to get its house in order before it starts gobbling up land and moving troops around.   Right now the Ukrainian government is in a precarious transitional stage.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"There are two compelling interests for Russia in Ukraine: one strategic, and one tied to Russia's national identity and narrative.

The first interest is quite simply that Russia is afraid. The Russian leadership does not think WWII has fundamentally changed human nature, and they know that one day, whether it is next year, or in 10 years, or in 100 years, Russia will be invaded again from the west. Russia is a vast steppe with no natural barriers to speak of, other than the Caucasus in the south. In order to keep the war as far away from the indefensible Russian heartland as possible, Russia needs control over land as far west as can be reasonably controlled, so that the inevitable war will not devastate the Russian heartland, but rather the Ukrainian-, Belarusian-, or Baltic-inhabited lands to the west. It is out of profound fear that the Russians feel the need to dominate the lands on Russia's western border.

If Ukraine joins the EU, or worse, NATO, the next war Russia fights with a western neighbor will not be fought in the fields of Poland, or Belarus, or Ukraine--like the two world wars--but in the Russian-populated heartland itself. Russia is huge, but because it has no geographic defenses, it feels the only way it can defend itself is to obtain strategic depth, by having friendly states to the west. The more western, the better.

The second interest is less tangible: it is to do with Russia's self-image and the national narrative that the Russian leadership (at least) subscribes to. Russia sees itself as the spiritual descendant of Kievan Rus', a medieval state that at one point controlled all the lands inhabited by East Slavs (that is, the ancestors of Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians). The Russian mission, so to speak, is to once again unite all the East Slavs under one banner. If Russia cannot politically integrate the Belarusians and Ukrainians, it must at least have them acknowledge its leadership of the East Slavs.

If Ukraine moves toward the EU, Russia cannot interpret this in any way other than as a refusal to acknowledge Russia's leadership of Ukraine. It is a deliberate rejection of Russia's image of itself. Because it doesn't seem like the EU is a military threat to Russia in the short term, this is most likely the primary concern among the Russian leadership. They simply cannot accept a Ukraine that has turned away from Russia. They cannot accept it, and they will do almost everything in their power to prevent that from happening. If they cannot keep the Ukrainians under thrall with love, they will do it with force.",0,1393807623,null,0,false,0,cfstwz8,t3_1zct46,t1_cfstwz8,t3_1zct46,null,1432631022,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Big Icelandic firms don’t want to stay in Iceland, given the current capital controls. “They have already moved their headquarters out. And that is because they find it very hard to be locked in an isolated stock market, to be locked in with a currency that is non-convertible and to make their books in a currency nobody understands.”

Also, paraphrasing Dr. Eiríkur Bergmann here, she siad that Iceland's situation before the financial crisis had it involved with the EU through EEA and EFTA. So it was close enough to do business and trade, but when it came to the crisis they were not a member of the union and could not receive financial aid from the EU.

""Sabre rattling"" is such a general phrase. What do you mean? He's rattling to whom, in whose name and why?


I mean, I almost **feel** paranoid and question myself when I look at the reactions of people in Western Europe. Maybe it's not serious at all, this Russian army on Ukrainian territory (autonomy or not)? And by ""people"" i don't mean the politicians, just regular people. They just don't care. Who gives a shit. So maybe you can invade anyone as long as the gas flows to Germany, Italy and the rest of the club?
But I don't want to think you can. I was taught to think it's a serious thing when there's a breach of international law - and there are unmarked soldiers at Crimea disarming Ukrainian troops.

I came to a conclusion that this situation is only for the internal ""putinist"" propaganda, to show that no dissent will be allowed. But this is a desperate step if international relations have to be strained to make Russians believe Putin is in control.

But these thngs aside, you do believe tomorrow this will be over?

True.

But Iran was never producing ""highly enriched uranium"" in the first place.
And ""dirty bombs"" are a Hollywood fantasy.

What they agreed was to cease production of 20% enriched uranium, whch is still considered low-enriched. But they had been offering to cease do so for years. Ahmadinejad went before the UN General Council and repeated the offer. The Turks and Brazilians brokered a deal in which Iran agreed to ship out its enriched uranium in exchange for fuel but the Obama administration killed that deal AFTER Iran had said yes, despite the fact that the same Obama administration had OKd the terms of the deal.
http://www.todayszaman.com/news-211443-brazil-reveals-obama-letter-in-spat-over-iran-nuclear-deal.html

The entire reason why the increased their enrichment levels from 3.5 to 20 percent in the first place was because of US sanctions that prevented Iran from regularly buying the fuel for a medical reactor that was needed by Iran's 800,000 cancer patients. This reactor was far too small to be a nuclear weapons threat and was in fact given to Iran by the US in the 1960s along with several pounds of weapons-grade fuel for it. After the revolution, the Iranians converted it to use low-enriched fuel instead which they bought from Argentina. The US then started interfering with the fuel sales so the Iranian were forced to increase their enrichment levels to 20% to make their own fuel.

The Party of Regions ammended the constitution in 2010 that significantly increased the power of the president.  Judges that were against the ammendment mysteriously decided to step down when before a decision was made on its constitutionality.  

&gt;That would only work if a country doesn't have secret ballots during election. Otherwise, people in power have no means of verifying if voters are voting ""correctly"". Did Ukraine not have secret ballots?

They do have secret ballots, but you cannot underestimate the power of an employer not only telling you how to vote, but also having the entire power structure influence you in the same way.  In a corrupt society, nothing is secret.  If you have a family and only want to keep your head down, you are most likely to vote the safest way because you probably don't even consider your vote to be of any consequence in the first place.

I think Yanukovitch was on the path to dictatorship, which was cemented in the passage of the draconian anti-protest laws.
