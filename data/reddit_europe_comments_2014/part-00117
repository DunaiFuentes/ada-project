true,[deleted],null,null,"the issue is that they're quite limited, at least they used to be to the rural areas of pakistan, in particular the Pashtun ethnic areas. However immigration of Pashtuns from the mountains to the cities, the funding of the Pakistani military to fundamentalists for decades so as to counter Russian/American influence respectively, the spreading of those extremist ideologies by refugee afghans who went over to the border/mountain areas in Pakistan and the Pashtuns who lived there means that Pakistan is a lot more extremist than it used to be. 

I mean just look at Benazir Bhutto, the hugely popular female PM of Pakistan in the 90s. Or just look up photos of daily life in Pakistan- unlike the Paki's in say London whose women are sometimes dressed in full body veils and shit like that there are almost no women who wear anything more than a shawl or a veil which covers some of the hair like roman catholic women used to do. 

Also a lot of people misconstrue anti-americanism with muslim extremism in terms of the Pakistani mentality. 

I'm not going to lie that the situation in Pakistan is rapidly going from worse to worse for the last decade, but honestly speaking the kind of shit pakistani muslims in london do such as go to sharia courts instead of civil courts, making women wear more and more restrictive clothing, taking children to sharia/islamic schools instead of normal government schools and so on used to be actions which were rather rare in major pakistani cities.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"&gt;Well, obviously I did not mean it that way. But it's hard to refute the point that the architecture of the eurozone encouraged this behaviour and that the countries should at least acknowledge that and take it into account when battling the crisis. 

A very large number of people say that, but the number of people who seem to be able to explain how without resorting to questionable and simplistic graphical ""correlations"" is very small (that's not personally intended, btw). The architecture of the euro - the very existence of the euro, really - makes certain things inevitable, such as single interest rates. Inevitable, and of course completely 100% predictable, stated in large words on the tin, requiring no prophetic powers, etc - yet those very same self-evident architectural points are trotted out as if they were some kind of mystifying and unpredicted arcana which took the eurozone periphery governments and policy makers completely by surprise. There seems almost to be a general air of ""who knew?"".

I'm not sure what about the euro is supposed to have produced the Irish property bubble. People link the two, and then wave their hands mysteriously and say ""it's obvious"", but I can't see anything obvious about it. I find it hard to see anything actually relevant about the euro to the Irish property bubble. No other asset bubble has required a common currency. The UK's Eighties property bubbles, Iceland's property bubble, the US property bubble...obviously none of these required the euro.

An asset bubble requires only that buyers believe that asset prices will continue to go up, and that banks believe that lending to buyers is a good bet. People *think* that the banks have to ""get the money from somewhere"" in order to keep lending, but that's not how money actually works in modern economies. Banks *create* money by lending, and continue to do so as long as doing so looks profitable - see this BoE bulletin for a proper explanation: www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q1prereleasemoneycreation.pdf

&gt;You're of course right that it isn't the only relevant bit. But what exactly does that refute? The way I understand it is that these sorts of articles are trying to shed light on the relationship between surplus regions and deficit regions and only aim to demonstrate that one country's wage repression has a beggar-thy-neighbour effect on the competitiveness of other countries. That bit is not refuted by your argument. 

That general point is not refuted, sure. The link between Germany's competitiveness and the PIIG's current account deficits (those that had them), on the other hand, is quite simply not proven in any sense at all by a graph showing them together. I'm not sure how it's even supposed to do so. It's like graphing one person's rising salary and another person's falling salary, and claiming that the latter is falling *because* the former is rising. How does the mere fact that Germany increased its competitiveness while the PIIGs lost theirs supposed to make Germany responsible for the PIIGS' current account deficits, or their loss of competitiveness?

Would you not need at the very least to show that German exports to the PIIGS rose while German imports from the PIIGS fell? Help me out here - how are the two supposed to be related?

&gt;No, you're right, it's definitely important. But that only shows that ""periphery countries"" took a short-term profit approach in dealing with the bubbles that were being created. How does the whole ""therefore, we should show fiscal discipline"" bit follow from that? 

It doesn't, of course. At least, the whole Fiscal Stability targets stuff doesn't seem to have any bearing on the problems in Ireland at all. We ran budget surpluses - sure, they were based on windfall treatment of property bubble based taxes - but they fitted the Stability &amp; Growth limits, so the new ones seem completely irrelevant to what happened to us.

I don't find a need for any sort of hierarchy. I'm both European and Irish, just like I'm both Irish and Corkonian.

&gt;Are you an ethno/religous-nationalist? 

No. Not at all. I consider all religions to be equally ridiculous at their base level, and see no link between nationality and ethnicity.

&gt;Are you a regionalist? 

I'm not sure what you're asking. Are you talking about regions within my Member State or including it?

&gt;Is your nation-state what you identify yourself by? 

One of many things.

&gt;Are you a European above all? 

As I said above, there's no hierarchy to me. My relationship to the EU is the most important if we're talking globally. My relationship to Ireland is the most important if we're taking about Europe. Within Ireland it'd be my County (our provinces are really just historical, and Munster only really crops up for me, identity wise, in relation to rugby or my dialect of Irish), and within my County, it'd be my village, then my estate.

&gt;Can the EU ever be successful if it is not the primary identity of its inhabitants?

Yes. But some sense of shared identity is still important. It doesn't have to be the primary one, but it should figure in there somewhere.

It's very thorough and accurate and forced me to think about the current structure of the EU, and what I want for it. It's rare to have the complexities of EU decision-making so clearly laid out. Kudos. That said, I don't agree with all the changes you propose.

As things stand, the EP may be directly elected, and proportional, but I don't think it should be given much more power at present. For a start, it's politically fuzzy, for example, the UK Labour party are to the right of the French UMP on economic issues, yet they sit on the Party of European Socialist (Left) while the UMP sit in the European People's Party (Right). Secondly, election turn-outs are very low for European elections and parties mostly run on national agendas, so it's hard to argue the EP really represents the majority of European citizens. Though as an additional democratic step, the next President of the Commission will be chosen by the parliament - which goes some way to filling the democratic deficit at the heart of the EC.

You refer to the Council of the European Union (Consilium) - sometimes referred to as the  ""Council of Ministers,"" which I find more descriptive - as an upper house of parliament. This is somewhat true, except that unlike the US Senate, or the British House of Lords, the members of the Consilium are themselves directly elected at a national level. Also unique is that all members have specific competence over the area which will be affected by the legislation. So, if the legislation being discussed is of an educational nature, the Consilium will contain the elected Ministers of Education of all 28 member states. As a result, I think it is normal that this ""Upper House"" should have a more than usual amount of influence over the final shape of a law.

I consider myself staunchly pro-EU, but I see its democratic legitimacy as emanating principally from the member states. As such, I do not really want to give too much in the way of Executive power to any branch of the EU. I personally don't mind the current, slightly muddled structure and decision-making procedure. Compared to traditional unitary states like the USA, Russia or China, the EU is a hugely complex construction, and I'd argue it's in the best interest of European citizens that compromise and caution be the order of the day. 

One reform I would want to see is shared portfolios in the European Commission. I think it's a little silly that every time we enlarge, we have to come up with a new job in the Commission. In my view it would be better if three or four commissioners shared responsibility over one area of policy. This would ensure continuing collegiality, simplify future enlargements and, hopefully, lead to higher quality legislation since there would be more eyes on each policy area.

Yes, but Germany's apology for the Holocaust was able to bring some sense of closure to the tragedy. Turkey doing the same thing for the Armenians won't. 

The Jews of Europe didn't have a national identity that was strictly tied to the land that they had been residing in for centuries. They were minorities in their countries of residence and many of them considered their *true* home to be the land of Israel, and many surviving Jews moved there after the war. On the other hand, the Armenians were driven from places which they considered to be part of their ancestral homeland for thousands of years.

All Germany had to do was sign Israel a big fat check. It's not as simple as that in the case of Turkey.

&gt; That's very much in part due to the fact that Armenians were ""like a broken record"". Otherwise it would have been completely brushed aside and forgotten.

No, it's because the West *chooses* to recognize it, albeit to a lesser degree than the Holocaust. The Circassians are just as vocal about what happened to them at the hands of the Russians, but they are almost entirely unknown. You are lucky because you are a Christian nation and you have allies in the West who feel a distant sense of cultural kinship to you. If the Turks had been the ones massacred en masse by the Greeks and Armenians instead, it would not register at all in the Western collective consciousness. And you would be denying it as well. Or at the very least, framing it in the context of liberation, and most of Europe would agree with you.

&gt; What? What's hypocritical about asking for recognition of genocide?

Because why do you need them to apologize? Why can't you just say ""screw them,"" and go your own way? What do you really get out of it—do you seriously expect to be friends with them in future?

It's hypocritical because it belies an ulterior motive (otherwise it would be pointless) and glosses over the fact that your people would have done the same exact thing to the Turks if you had been in a position to do so. Look what happened to centuries of Turkish presence in the Balkans. Do you think Armenia then would have acted differently?

The reason why people closer to the top of the list are progressively more modern, is because the more modern they, the greater a role they played determining that World War II happened, and the result of that war. The reason I place such significant importance on World War II is because World War II completely change the paradigm of how European nations work together. The core European powers (most notably France and Germany) have been at war for centuries but now they are the most populous and largest economies in a shared currency union. The nature of the EU might change, and the international paradigms might change again, but France and Germany as well as several other core EU currencies fevestated by various European conflicts will be economically and politically connected for centuries.

Even beyond France and Germany's unification, it has, in the long term, encouraged democracy to spread to Spain and Portugal, after the fall of the dictatorships and to the former Eastern bloc. It's also brought about organisations and charters independent of the EU, like the European Council  and its convention on human rights. It brought about the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe. It brought about *the United Nations*. 

All of these changes to how the world works will endure for a long time beyond today. The intergovernmentalism fostered in the aftermath of the Second World War, will stick around for long after I'm dead and gone. It's for that reason, that the leaders who played a role in all of these new features of humanity coming into existence, are some of the most important characters in human and European history.

Eastern Anatolia means more to them than it does to the Turks, but the Turks will nonetheless refuse to part with an inch of it. Not only would endanger the welfare of the Turkish people living there, but also open up avenues for the Greeks and Kurds to lay claims, and they definitely do not want to see a repeat of the Treaty of Sèvres.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; First, do you think commentators are right in that there is a right-wing populist resurgence?

To say the least, it is a fact that the media is portraying it as such. But is maybe not this or at least not as important (in some situations), or is at least not right-wing at all.

&gt;If so, what do you think the causes are?

Here what I think is more important than ""what is the cause"" is that the factors are multiple, unrelated (usually, simply based on particular intrinsic state dynamics, be it historical or current in nature) but nonetheless contribute to this additive image of ""right-wing, nationalistic sentiments"" that are apparently sweeping over the EU.

The easiest to identify factor (one which characterizes these political mechanisms) is the bashing of the EU. EU is a multi-national, faceless entity on the respective national level -- so, let's bash it. The results: no negative consequences on european level, some identification on the national electorate level. This is a no-brainer strategy, so I think more and more political parties will do it.

To me a core problem arises from the dynamics of current politics, itself. There are multiple problems facing all the states not only in the EU. Most of these problems require significant fortitude on behalf of the people, significant efforts on behalf of the state on local, national and international levels -- all in all, the attack of such problems cannot ever enter the platform of any political populist movement. The crux of the matter comes now. But the government in office has to do something about these problems. So, they become unpopular and are bashed by populists, who in turn claim they have the *straight* answers, albeit with severe consequences. But in reality, the populist opposition claims zero accountability (much like the EU bashing). 

This effect is not tied to particular political party, platform or orientation. Currently, it is right-wing nationalism, because the EU and the majority of in-office nations' governments are for broadening european relationships, recognition of european problems, rather than isolated national ones, etc.  

The end result of the populist effect *can be* that politics, in general, becomes more and more populist. This will certainly be a disaster, from my perspective; it would certainly lead to a disconnection with people's problems, or it would lead to the disconnection with the political model, as such. Both of these are some significant shifts.

A more desired ending can be that we overcome populism (acknowledging: indeed, there are tough problems, and the populist platform is a scam), while we don't lapse into obscurantism in the other direction (i.e. we have to do everything so that we overcome the problems, sacrificing freedom for security).

First is that he's actual and main goal is to destroy Nato and EU as organizations.

You can see how mentality of big player countries change within weeks from ""*this is unacceptable*"" to ""*ok, you can have that, but no step further*"". I'm really curious how west will react when Putin ""tests"" out Nato country(e.g. Latvia). Because, he **will** try.

Second theory is about production. In the beginning of 2000 when Putin got in power his agenda was wealthy and modern Russia. I have a feeling that he really hoped for second China or something. To become major producer. But I think at some point he realized that within his lifetime it's not gonna happen, Russia is too deeply in its own shit(by that I mean in its crappy work culture, that doesn't allow for quality produce).

But how can any left-wing party, or any party, provide good social policies, or -- any at all -- for that matter, if in a debate with a populist party opponent (again, no matter the orientation), the socialist party is undermined by dupe argumentation that sounds good, but cannot ever be implemented? 

I hear you saying, but how can be that the populists gain an edge over the left-wing, socialist party (in the example provided); and the answer is that the populist party is undermining the political debate by providing misleading, good-sounding statements, and in the long run, the political model, as such (including populism), by pushing other parties (the second paragraph in your post) to become more and more populist themeselves (including left-wing ones).

Ma quando ""raddrizzi"" situazioni di povertà stai facendo la stessa cosa. La gente non diventa povera dal nulla. Lo é e ci nasce perché storicamente é stata inserità in una poverty trap.

Perché il Sud Italia é povero?Perché lo era in passato.

Perché i neri americani sono poveri?Perché sono stati discriminati in passato e adesso molti credono di non potersi migliorare, e nemmeno riescono ad immaginare una vita fuori dalla logica del ghetto dove sono stati spinti dalladiscriminazione.

Ideologicamente staccare l'influenza delle pressioni sociali e culturali dalla povertà é quello che farebbe un liberalista convinto, che ovviamente é anche contro le misure anti povertà da te citate. Negando l'influsso storico della discriminazione, uno puo' giustamente dire che se la società dà uguali opportunità, se non le cogli é colpa tua.

Chi sostiene invece, come te, il merito delle politiche redistributive, sostiene anche che ci sono condizionamenti storico-sociali che l'uomo non é in grado di superare da solo, e per questo lo Stato interviene, per spezzare il cerchio e portarlo fuori dalla poverty trap.

Riservare posti all'università per i neri era un modo per alzare la loro possibilità di un salario più alto, che senza l'Università non avviene. Senza quelle misure l'income gap fra neri e bianchi sarebbe ancora più alto: meno neri all'università, più basso il loro income medio collettivo.

Non capisco perché per te sia giusto radrizzare il divario storico dell'income fra poveri e ricchi in Italia e non lo sia quello per i neri. O meglio: preferisci il trasferimento diretto di soldi (che molti vedrebbero come carità) al povero che l'allargamento delle sue possibilità di migliorare la sua vita da solo grazie a misure di positive discrimination.

Che tra l'altro quelle due lire di elemosina dello Stato non cambieranno la tua vita. L'Università e il lavoro di livello piùalto che potresti guadagnarci, si.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; As people have said I would put Hitler on this list, although it could be argued he was an inevitable figure after the anihhilation of Germany from WWI, in which case 'credit' for WWII should go to those leaders who pushed for such harsh punishment at the end of WWI.

Hitler was *far* from inevitable. Yes, the Treaty of Versailles was a factor in him coming to power, but there were a number of other factors without which it would have played out differently. The most closely related item on this (incomplete) list would be the lack of formal [surrender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stab-in-the-back_myth) by the German military instead of only of the post-revolutionary government.  
The Great Depression and following that the withdrawal from capital out of Germany, the resulting banking crisis and how the government handled all this, were conductive to the Nazis becoming a major political force.

Then there were problems with the Weimar Constitution. One set of those undermined political stability in the newly formed democracy that hadn't been on solid footing in the population to begin with. For example, in *modern* Germany, the chancellor can get removed from office through a *constructive* vote of non-confidence, which means the parliament simply elects a new one. In the Weimar Republic, it was through a *simple* vote of non-confidence, which meant that opposition parties could cooperate to remove the [chancellor](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichskanzler#Weimarer_Republik_2), without there being a stable majority to form a new government.  
Even after all that, and von Papen's stupid idea to make Hitler chancellor to put him into a position where he had to deliver on his populist messages (""Within two months we will have pushed Hitler so far in the corner that he'll squeak""), the transition from albeit unstable democracy to dictatorship still relied on another set of issues with the constitution. Technically, there was nothing in it that said you couldn't use emergency laws in combination with the paragraph on dissolving the parliament (arguably it would have been too late anyway, but apparently you need to spell out that the offices of chancellor and president can't be held by the same person, too).  
Finally, the Enabling Act shouldn't have been possible, either, and constitutional technicalities aside, that the Social Democrats voted against it showed that the other parties did have a choice, even with the SA present.

So, yes, of course the Treaty of Versailles contributed, but it's far from the only cause and there were a number of junctions that history took to get there afterwards. Personally, I like to blame the guy who rejected his application to art school.

&gt;*""But it’s not just madmen on the rise. In country after country, genuine protest movements of left, right and centre are surging.""*

&gt;*And the most hysterical language is coming, not from the insurgent parties, but from the Eurocrats. The EU president, Herman Van Rompuy, fears that the whole European structure will be blown away by the ‘winds of populism’. (Populism is a favourite Eurocrat word, meaning ‘when politicians do what their constituents want’ — or, as we call it in English, ‘democracy’.) The president of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, seeks to make our flesh creep with his vision of ‘political extremes and populism tearing apart the social fabric’. Jean-Claude Juncker, the ultimate Brussels insider, who recently stepped down after 18 years as prime minister of Luxembourg, is so alarmed that he foresees another Great War: ‘I am chilled by the realisation of how similar the crisis of 2013 is to that of 100 years ago.’*

* Alternative for Germany (AfD), for example, is essentially a Eurosceptic offshoot from the liberal FDP
* The Pirate Party began life as a single-issue campaign in Sweden against the rules on intellectual property.
* the Five Star Movement, an unlikely coalition of ecologists, Eurosceptics and, for want of a better term, Carswellians (supporters of open primaries, referendums, internet polls and the like) remains the third force in Italian politics,


&gt;*What links Marine le Pen, Geert Wilders, Beppe Grillo, Nigel Farage, Alexis Tspiras, the firebrand leader of the far-left Syriza movement in Greece, and Berndt Lucke, the clever and mild-mannered professor of macro-economics who leads AfD? Beyond the fact that they expect to do well in May’s elections, only one thing: they all dislike the euro. *

Compare:

&gt;*Barroso frames this year’s election as a choice between ‘pro-European forces’ and ‘extremist forces’.*

Conclusion:

&gt;**In the solipsistic world-view of the Euro-integrationist, none of this much matters: any Eurosceptic is, ipso facto, extreme.**

I've lived in Paris and Tokyo, and spent a lot of time in NYC (based in the upper west side).  Overall, I would say Tokyo.  Japan has amazing travel opportunities, amazing food, really kind and patient people, and it's overall a unique experience.  Despite its reputation, the quality with respect to price is unparalleled, except perhaps in rent.  You can learn the language, and people are/act impressed if you can say even basic words.  If you cannot learn the language (but you should), you can get by in English: much of the signage is in English, anything meant for foreigners (e.g. immigration) is in English, and the locals usually have an incredible amount of patience for our fumbling language and cultural skills.  Last, someone mentioned thugs - gosh, Japan is like the safest place in the world, to the point of naivete

One warning about Japan - it's harder to live there as a single, foreign female because you're likely to stay quite single, and it's hard to develop a career.  If you go as an English teacher, that's probably what you'll be when you leave.  If you go for work, you'll have a harder time being promoted because the expectations of women are still... a little old-fashioned.  But it's changing.

Paris, well, the benefits are good (lots of vacation, few hours, if you have a family you benefit for lots of tax breaks and public activities).  You're likely to live in a suburb (cheaper) or an old stereotypical French building and all that an old apartment entails.  Good travel also, with Europe at your doorstep.

That anonymous archer may have singlehandedly altered the course of history in Europe more drastically than any other individual in the last 1000 years.  
  
2. On a similar note, it is said that the Black Plague first entered Europe in 1340 when a Mongolian force catapulted the corpse of some poor plague victim over the battlements into Genoa. Within 3 centuries, one third of the population of Europe was dead. That flying corpse changed things quite a bit.

&gt;*Many of the euro’s problems can be traced to its birth defects. For political reasons, countries were included that weren’t ready at the time. Furthermore, a common currency cannot survive on the long term if it is not backed by a political union. Even as the euro was being born, many experts warned that currency union members didn’t belong together.*

&gt;*But it wasn’t just the experts. Documents from the Kohl administration, kept confidential until now, indicate that the euro’s founding fathers were well aware of its deficits. And that they pushed ahead with the project regardless.*

&gt;*The government files from the founding phase of the monetary union reveal that this construct cannot function. The message the documents convey is that political opportunism will ultimately prevail.*

All the analysis of the monetary union indicates that it was a political project not an economic one.

The architects of the EURO knew that a crisis would emerge and rationalized that would be a good opportunity to push for greater integration powers to the EU/ECB. The collateral damage to the people/countries was a cost worth taking for them.

It's a big con to by-pass democratic governance and absorb further sovereign powers from members states.

The current EU has changed from the ECSC -&gt; EEC -&gt; EC -&gt; EU... ?-&gt;USE.

It is currently now a ""single-regulatory regime"" aka supranational organization that's purpose is to convert into a Federal Political legitimate body: It can only do that by:

1. Taking more powers from member countries
2. Adding more members to grow influence

The Usury and loss of control of money supply leaves EZ countries' governments in thrall (Troika etc). There is much more deception than just the above, alone.

Da ingegnere gestionale che lavora nel campo dell'informatica, mi accodo a tutti gli altri nel dire che l'ECDL è totalmente inutile. Una certificazione ha valore se certifica la quantità di studio o di esperienza necessari per ottenerla, nel caso dell'ECDL, questa quantità è nulla.

Se proprio vuoi prendere una certificazione IT ti consiglierei quelle Oracle, ad esempio la [1z0-051: SQL Fundamentals](http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=5001&amp;get_params=p_exam_id:1Z0-051). Costa nell'ordine di un centinaio di euro, ti dà competenze MOLTO spendibili e il solo nome Oracle sul tuo CV farà una gran porca figura.

Mi vengono in mente altre certificazioni valide:

senza esperienza:

* CCNA (reti)

* CISSP (sicurezza)


con esperienza

* ITIL (service management)

* CAPM/PMP (project management)


Uscendo dall'IT, da ingegnere gestionale può esserti molto utile/spendibile un corso-certificazione SixSigma o Lean, ma non esistono certificati ufficiali, ogni scuola fa il proprio.

*EDIT: ovviamente ti propongo la 051 supponendo che tutto ciò che sai di database è un paio di corsi universitari.

The premise is true, but it's not necessarily an obstacle for all eternity.

Keep in mind that the *modern national state* itself is (a) a relatively recent ""invention"" and (b) can be seen as the next evolutionary step from tribal identity -&gt; regional identity to national identity.

All it takes is then to take that ""patriotism"" (without the negative aspects, as much as that's possible) and cast it into an even larger context, i.e. go from *national* identity to, say, *continental* identity.

It certaintly does for the government to reach it's policy target of 99,999 as agreed with the people.

2. Constantine. Again, Europe and all of Western civilization is hard to imagine without Christianity being the dominant religion for the last 1500+ years. Constantine's official conversion to Christianity probably laid the foundations for that.

3. Gutenberg. Information is of enormous importance, the introduction of printing in Europe changed everything. I think this is quite self explanatory.

4. Newton. In addition to his direct enormous contributions in physics and mathematics, he's one of the prominent Enlightenment thinkers, which again changed all of European thinking.

5. Hitler. The main person behind WW2, which again changed everything - the deadliest conflict ever, and a complete change in European and international politics after the war.

I think there are some things you could do which could help you.

1. When you are in a bigger town/city there may is a community of indian people or people who also come from a very far culture and know how to act from the time when they were new. With this you can build yourself a base of people who may know what to do.

2. Do you have hobbies? When you start to do something you like could take your though in a better direction. (sorry my english is not that well.)

3. And it would be nice to have someone with whom you could talk about everything. Maybe someone from that community, maybe a psychologist or someone else.

What I'm saying is that a federation has some very real and tangible benefits, and using the centuries-old rhetoric appealing to nationalism and independence (stemmed from times when unifying territories was a forceful and non-democratic process) to counter it just doesn't cut it anymore.

Loyalty to whom and for what? I love my country and i view myself as Danish. I do not, however, love my country in a traditional sense. I have no sympathy with its politicians or many of its political decisions (external or otherwise). I love the geographical place and its scandinavian culture, i love its trees, its meadows and its rivers, i love how the sea is always near. 

I think that qualifies me as a Nationalist in a romantic sense. 

&gt; If we cannot protect each other, how will we ever have any credibility?

Ukraine is not part of Europe. They're not part of ""us"". Sure, the European Union and America wants them to be. Just like Russia wants to seal them into the Russian sphere of influence. I have no sympathy for Putin's imperialism but we have no obligation to ""save"" Ukraine from Russia. Whatmore, we're not saving them, we're just locking them into our sphere of influence. 

If Ukraine begins working more closely with the European Union they're likely to be obligated to take an IMF loan. Do you know what the conditions of IMF loans are? They force recipient nations to make drastic cuts in the public sector: Stuff like public schooling, healthcare, social security and oil prices (which are subsidized in Ukraine to increase affordability). Additionally, they may be required to privatize state owned assets (which often causes price hikes since private companies are more aggressive profit seekers than state companies need to be)

These measures would deteroriate quality of life for virtually every middle and lower class citizen in Ukraine. Thats not saving them. Thats damning them.

&gt; Can the EU ever be successful if it is not the primary identity of its inhabitants?

What are the success criteria for a Union? I have nothing against the concept of a Union. We need to ask what we want to achieve, however. I don't like the current European Union because it is dominated by centre-right forces. I'm scandinavian, our politics are usually more to the left than most of Europe, in this regard EU is forcing us right on certain things such as monetary policy. I'm against that.

La nouvelle salle pourra accueillir environ 700 personnes.**

Choosing between Hitler and Stalin in terms of significance, I rank Hitler higher not because Stalin has less influence now (his legacy is indeed very much alive), but because Hitler wasn't inevitable in the slightest. In the case of Stalin, USSR already existed as a large autocratic state before him. There was some kind of system that Stalin emerged from, and while he made it far more terrible, the beginnings were already there. Hitler, on the other hand, himself begun the Third Reich, and started WW2. It seems to me that without Stalin, the Soviet Union would still have existed as a totalitarian state (though under a less terrible leader most likely), but without Hitler, there wouldn't even be a Nazi empire or the war that changed everything.

Of course, I accept that it's not a strong argument.

Un homme ennuie deux vieilles femmes, les insulte, il finit par leur cracher dessus. L'une d'elles se lève et s'enèrve. Il se lève et s'approche menaçant pour la frapper et donne un premier coup de poing.

Je me suis levé en même temps que lui, ai confié à ma petite sœur les livres que je portais, et j'attrape son bras.

Il sort un couteau. J'ai le temps de voir ses yeux de junkie, le genre de gars avec qui on ne peut raisonner. Il commence à essayer de me frapper pendant que je recule.

Il se passe de longues minutes pendant qu'il fait des mouvements pour me frapper, de bas en haut au niveau du ventre, qui tombent pour la plupart sur ma veste (je ne vois que plus tard la coupure bénigne à ma main). Je recule en essayant de le maintenir.

Ma soeur a rapidement tiré le signal d'alarme, le métro s'est arrêté. Nous sortons. Le chauffeur du métro accourt déjà avec une espèce de matraque. Le gars qui imagine bien que la police va arriver s'en va.

Quelques minutes plus tard, le gars parti, les vieilles dames aussi sans un remerciement, nous remontons dans le métro qui repart. Je ne sais pas si la police ou des vigiles sont arrivés à temps et ont coincé le gars avant qu'il ne sorte de la station.

Dans le métro deux jeunes me congratulent. Ils n'avaient pas osé bouger avant.

Politicians have twined together all states with different levels of economic power in a way that makes every one hurt when one countries politicians don't give a shit. This makes the people in the countries who have to bail out the others pissed off. They ask why they need to suffer when they haven't done anything wrong.

On top of this countries who are in the Euro have lost their power to control their domestic monetary policy to reduce the economic hardship and the ECB is incompetent in doing anything about it. In fact the ECB is between a rock and a hard place. It cannot lower interest rates further to have inflation eat up debt, it cannot increase them to as this will hurt the ones doing poorly. Monetary policy is just the tip of the iceberg.

We also have increased social welfare tourism from poorer nations to richer ones who put a strain on their economy and worsens the situation of the people who paid for it to exist. The UK is clearly the one that has been hit the worst by this but all north European nations are feeling it.

Our streets are filled with beggars and pick pockets from Romania constantly reminding us each morning when we got to work that our taxes are paying for this. People in low skill employment are loosing their jobs to cheap labour from the east making them recent the EU even more.

It is a long list of big and small issues that after a while grows on people and they decide that they've had enough. The two biggest mistakes in my opinion for the EU was the expansion to the east and the inclusion of countries like Greece into the Euro. If we had just let these countries mature and get their things in order longer it would have gone better. But the greed of wanting to create a European super state blow up in the face of our politicians.

I'm more than certain that my comments will piss some people off, but if you break the issue down it comes down to this. It's just the sad reality of things. The only parties that want to do anything about it are the nationalistic ones. No pro-EU party is willing to take a step back and start over where it went wrong leaving only one option for the people.

High flying ideas and ideologies of some pan European cosy state aren't just as easy to put in motion as some people think.

Hell I used to be pro EU and I'm highly educated, well paid and life is good and I'm against the EU nowadays.

Der braunen Weltanschauung zufolge gab es den hochwertigen nordischen Menschen, den Arier, und die minderwertigen Rassen, mit den Juden an unterster Stelle.

&gt; Nationalsozialisten sahen im „Juden“ den Todfeind der arischen Rasse und damit des Deutschen. Deshalb wollten die Nazis als die „Herrenmenschen“ die „jüdische Weltpest“, wie sie sagten, ausrotten. Grausame Konsequenz: die Ermordung von sechs Millionen jüdischer Menschen.

&gt; Genau genommen ist also ein Nazi, wer die irrsinnige Weltanschauung der Nationalsozialisten teilt: Ablehnung von Demokratie, „Führerprinzip“, Unterwerfung anderer Völker, absolute Intoleranz.

&gt; **Schwierig liegen die Dinge, wenn es darum geht, Nationalsozialismus und Nationalismus zu unterscheiden.** Ein Nationalist ist jemand mit einer übersteigerten Vaterlandsliebe. Ein Patriot liebt auch sein Vaterland, stellt es aber nicht aus nationalistischen oder rassistischen Gründen über andere Länder oder Völker.

&gt; **Das Problem bei der Verortung eines Menschen als Nazi ist es, dass die Grenzen fließend verlaufen: Von der Ausländerfeindlichkeit zu Rassismus, von Antisemitismus zu Judenhass, von Patriotismus zum Nationalismus und so weiter.** Und noch etwas kommt dazu: Wer kann schon in die Hirne der Menschen schauen? „Dunkelziffer“ heißt das Schlagwort. Wer weiß schon, ob jemand „nur“ ein heimlicher Sympathisant ist?

Without the EU to give them an incentive to make these reforms much of eastern europe could have ended up like Belarus, Ukraine and or FSU countries which are economically and politically stagnant and ruled by cleptocratic family dynasties.

In making eastern europe avoid this (which was very far from granted) the EU is an overwhelming success which now has allowed eastern europe to integrate well in the Western establishment. Look to the success of the Baltic states, Poland, Czech republic, Hungary and Romania, which have all come a long way in 20 years and the the ultimate goal of joining the EU was imperative in this drive for reform.

The EU has in this process been strained and much hardship has been felt by many since 2008, however people are optimistic and it seems now that the road to recovery in no longer that far away. Bond yields in the European periphery have dropped singificantly and housing is recovering. These are signs that the worst is over but that does not mean that the crisis is over by any means.

As a result, the debt level rises until it spirals out of control.

ECB or Euro got very little to deal with the real cause of a problem. If not ECB - governments would play on other mechanics, either messing with constitutional limits of debt or by printing money. Difference is that in Eurozone when individual countries reach their threshold of debt suddenly whole Eurozone is in trouble, countries cannot be left on their own to rot. As long as citizens are too stupid to understand that their benefits need to be cut down in order to reduce national debit and there is no massive pressure on the governments to reduce expenses - debts will increase and next crisis caused by this will be impossible to avoid.

And as far as I see - change is not going to happen any time soon.

So they are part of the problem. And thus, what are the problems with the current system that allow for this populist behaviour to manifest? Something along these lines. 

Your answer is that *russian agencies invest in populist parties*, and I claim that *people, the system as whole, is flawed and is beign abused by the same people primarily*. I don't negate the fact that russian agencies are trying their best to gain advantage (like any other intelligence agency), but the primary factor is the inherent instabilities, systemic flaws in the political project.

As a Hungarian I am used to the idea that if you are a citizen of a nation you are either of the main, _nation-forming_ ethnic group or groups (Staatsvolk in German, there is no good English term, the Hungarian term államalkotó can be translated as ""nation-forming ethnic group""), or the other option is that you are from a minority group with their own identity and culture. So if you don't look like one of the Staatsvolk I will ask you what minority group you identify with. There is no racism and malice in it, just curiosity. If you are black and German say something like you are a Ghanian-German minority group the same way there is a Hungarian minority group in Serbia, that makes perfect sense. But a black guy being just-German just doesn't make sense to me. Obviously he is a minority, why isn't he proud of his actual identity? Didn't his parents give him any culture and identity of his ancestors?

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"&gt;I think it's pretty simple. ECB lowered its interest rates to help Germany recover but the interest rate was too low for the periphery countries and that caused asset bubbles there. Give this a read and tell me if you find it convincing.

I've never found that story particularly convincing, for a variety of reasons, and I find that paper even less so than some. The convergence of bond spreads wasn't part of the eurozone's architecture, as can be seen from the scattering of those bond rates come the crisis - it seems, on the contrary, to have been a market misreading of risk. The author's explanation that it came about because ""the ECB inherited the Bundesbank's reputation as an inflation fighter"" is a rather slanted way of not saying that it resulted from market assessment, particularly given the ECB's explicit inflation target. And explanations for peripheral sovereign debt that purport to relate to the ECB's *bank* lending rate with the convergence of sovereign bond rates, as if the one set the other, strike me as requiring yet another of these huge leaps which are achieved by simple conflation of similar sounding things.

Second, interest rates were low globally. The special explanation in the eurozone is that they were low for Germany, but they were low for every other major central bank as well. There was nothing particularly special about the eurozone: http://www.tradersnarrative.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/global%20central%20bank%20interest%20rates.png

Third, asset bubbles happened only in some places. Again, the explanations for those in the eurozone tend to be in terms of the euro, and the people offering those explanations tend to ignore the non-euro asset bubbles (such as Iceland and the UK) in favour of a special euro explanation.

&gt;I never said that showing the two graphs next to each other is sufficient proof. Also, I never claimed that ""Germany is fully responsible"" for causing the loss of competitiveness in the other countries. I'm afraid that you are constructing a strawman here.

Well, a little bit, yes - my defence is that here in Ireland, my straw man tends to be the actual position most people adopt. In the minds of many, Germany is totally to blame for pretty much the whole thing.

&gt;Now, what constitutes sufficient proof? I think you agree that if you suppress your wages, that causes an increase in competitiveness. Increased competitiveness increases your exports. The countries that share a currency with you are the ones that have the least tools available to counter your competitiveness boost and are therefore the ones who will decrease their exports (and increase their imports from you).

Well, you've pretty much indicated what's needed - demonstration that Germany increased its exports to the PIIGS and the PIIGS decreased their exports to Germany. And on that subject: http://lolgreece.blogspot.ie/2010/11/german-imports-myth-fail.html

Dude, you're just fighting way too much to rationalise your prior belief. It's so obvious it hurts. For example, here how does it matter if it was an explicit intention of the eurozone structure or a result of markets making a risk assessment? In both cases, the ECB's policy is a contributing factor.

Your ""proof"" uses rankings instead of trade volume.

You've misunderstood. I am saying that we have to be careful what we are doing as we don't know any other method of managing populations, while we know this one works somewhat and is currently in place.

&gt; European people have managed to live and die together under everything from relatively democratic tribalism, to divine right feudalism and even modern pseudo-representative democracy. 

Indeed, they have.

&gt;&gt; this is a deeper disconnect with the political model. 

&gt; It's a deeper disconnect with society.

When a community doesn't know how to live together, there is no community only individuals trying to survive, who find themselves surrounded by others doing the same. For example, when a city's energy, water, heating, gas, tansportation lines become unreliable or all-together non-functioning, the city stops being one. It is the same with other communal forms of co-existence like families, societies, states. corporations, etc.

I would say I am very loyal. I am Finnish and I'd there is very little I wouldn't do for my country as long as it isn't plain stupid.

&gt;Are you an ethno/religous-nationalist?

I'm not religious in the sense of going to church etc. I do believe in a god but I'm in no way religious in that sense. I do believe in people having the right to practice their religion if they want to. I'm very nordic in the sense of religion, here religion is a private matter and we don't like when religion is in your face.

I however do not appreciate or like muslims as in my experience they aren't prepared to adapt to our way of life. I don't care if that makes me called racist but that is how I think.

&gt;Are you a regionalist?

Yes, I believe that we can have a union of some sort. But not the kind of a union the EU is. A Nordic Union I'd support any day of the week. I'm a northerner. I am a Finn, but I'm also a northerner. I could see us in a working union with the Nordics, Germany and Austria who I feel are fairly similar to us and you can throw in Estonia as well. So yes I am I guess regionalist.

&gt;Is your nation-state what you identify yourself by?

To be honest I've lived in and been in all the Nordic countries so much that I identify myself as a northerner. I am a Finn and I identify myself as that as well. On a broader perspective, yes I'm European as well but not really so that I identify myself as such.

&gt;Can the EU ever be successful if it is not the primary identity of its inhabitants?

No, we're too different, we have too different values, we don't share a language or basic goals.

Surprisingly, it seems you're right. The share of German exports that are sent to European countries remains constant throughout the whole ordeal. The share of Greek imports coming from Germany does no significantly increase either. Well, I guess I have some thinking to do now. 

Edit: On the other hand, if the German export share to Greece didn't increase but at the same time Greece's competitveness fell, then why isn't that reflected in Greece's exports at all? Greece's exports also seem to increase as if there's no problem in competitiveness at all. I'm more confused than convinced now. 

Edit again: I think I understand what's going on now. The share remains the same and the volume of trade increases. BUT the volume of [German exports to Greece](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/stacked/hs/export/deu/grc/show/1995.2011/) increases much faster than the volume of [Greek exports to Germany](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/stacked/hs/import/deu/grc/show/1995.2011/).

true,zurthen,SCOT,Scotland,"It's more proportional representation

There are set constituencies which will each elect X MEPs. A party which wins 1/X votes will win one seat, 2/X votes 2 seats etc. 

Each party makes a list X MEPs that they will appoint. The first seat that they win will go to the first person on the list. If they win a second it will go to the second person on the list and so on. You really vote for a party in EU elections rather than an MEP. 

So for example Scotland is one EU constituency with six seats. Current polls indicate the following results:

SNP: 37%

Labour: 28%

Conservatives: 11%

UKIP: 10%

Lib Dems: 7%

Scottish Greens: 6%

This translates into three seats for the SNP, two for labour and one for the conservatives apparently. I'm unsure exactly how they work this out because the votes do not nicely divide into 6 portions.

The candidates at the top of the SNP and Labour lists are basically guaranteed a place in parliament. Only two seats are *really* being contested, which leads some people to consider this system quite undemocratic.

Lebensjahr mehr als einmal pro Woche und wurden als abhängig eingestuft.
Der IQ der frühen Marihuana-Nutzer sank zwischen dem 13. und 38. Lebensjahr im Durchschnitt um acht Punkte. Andere Tests bestätigten eine verminderte geistige Leistungsfähigkeit: Das Kurzzeitgedächtnis und Erinnerungsvermögen dieser Probanden funktionierte vergleichsweise schlecht, außerdem brauchten sie etwas länger für Aufgaben.

No, I am not. Or at least I am not consciously trying to take an ethical position. It is more like that when people grow up and get less idealistic they are _less interested in ethics at all_ - if it is not illegal and not an obviously asshole move, it is OK.

My point is simply that in an older age people adopt a more cynical attitude, not worry so much about ethics.

That shareholder thing does not match with European realities at all. How many businesses have shareholders? They are mostly just family owned. The same guy doing the hiring is pocketing the profit.

So it doesn't have anything to do with Friedman, shareholders and social responsibility and any kind of similarly high-level, lofty, birds-eye idea. 

Practical life is much more simpler than that. The average Hansi owning a small ski hotel in the Alps would generally prefer to employ someone as a hotel room cleaner who speaks perfect German (and his local dialect) and meshes with him culturally just nice. But if he can get away with paying €300 less to someone who doesn't, then he sees it as an acceptable price for the annoyance suffers. This is what happens, just simple everyday stuff not really lofty things like ethics or social responsibility.

Maybe I am being an asshole here, but even thinking about those things you mentioned either way - even in a pro-Friedman way - would be a typical ""idealistic college student"" thing, not really what the average 40 years old European does.

German companies can now move capital around and many have expanded to eastern countries, thus bringing up their revenues and allowing for more employment in germany as well as generally spending more money on improved labour conditions and pensions. Labour in germany is cheaper because i.e. Polish workers can easily migrate over the border and work legally (and vice versa: germans can work and live in eastern europe without issue). Germans have limitless access to travel in these countries at no additional expense (maybe not your cup of tea but germans in general travel more than ever now).

Here's a [post by Pantera on everything2](http://everything2.com/title/Russians). She's comparing Russians and Americans but the difference is just the same as between Western Germans and Eastern Germans:

&gt;We are hostile. Remember that every time you talk to us. We don’t like you. Just because you have a smile on, doesn’t imply that we need to have one too. You can identify a Russian, especially if they are over 30 and came to America before they were 20, by the hunched shoulders, defensive movements and hatred in the eyes.

&gt;That is the result of living with people who are exactly like that for a long time. We are rude, or if we’re not, we’re thinking of being rude, and getting angry.

&gt;The problem between Americans and Russians is the difference between the cultures. See, Americans are pretending to be nice, gentle and accepting creatures. Maybe some of them are. Russians don’t pretend. They show you the exact mood their in – if they’re angry you can see it. If they’re sad, you can see it. If they’re happy you can’t really see it, because Russians rarely smile, (only in a circle of good friends), and because Americans can’t really recognize the happiness of a person on the inside. Americans are great actors. They pretend they are happy every day. I feel really sad for them, sometimes, because I can see that behind their plastic smiles they are really sad, but their friends can’t see it.

&gt;Another problem is that when a Russian sees someone smiling they automatically take them for a friend, because they are used to friends being the only people who are open to them. And they automatically start being “friendly” to that person. I say “friendly” in quotes because a Russian understanding of friendly is very different from an American one. What I mean is that Russians automatically start telling things, to that (poor) person, things that they don’t want to hear. They just behave really strange (or so it seems to the confused American), so the American quickly and politely ends the conversation. And the Russian doesn’t understand what is going on, I mean imagine you’re all nice to a person and then the person walks away. That is the great misunderstanding of Russians and Americans.

Actually, it depends a lot of where do you live. In most cities gypsies are not well-respected and they are not so well-integrated.

Germany and the Netherlands have a ""continental"" welfare model which focuses more on maintaining people's employment and getting benefits from the employer instead of the state. My general impression is that they're too far right on the political spectrum to fit in with Scandinavia.

Another major concern is that Germany is huge while Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Finland are relatively small. In a Union a major country like France and Germany would have too much power and influence the overall course of the union too much.

true,G_Morgan,WALE,Wales,"This article reads more like a critique of capitalism than a critique of the EU. The fact Eurosceptics have to grasp is with or without the EU we will have capitalism. In fact the leaders of Euroscepticism are asking for precisely that. They want to strip away the extra parts like the social charter and leave behind only a capitalist entity which will keep doing all the things this article talks about. UKIP will leave us with Starbucks replacing local coffee shops, we just won't have a tool to deal with it. We will have even less power to ask Starbucks to pay a reasonable tax bill.

This will happen if the EU continues as is, if it expands, if it contracts, if it is dissolved completely. It will happen if every nation ends up beholden to China or the US though then it will be slanted to favour those nations.

What the EU gives us is potentially a tool for dealing with the worse of globalised capitalism. The EU can provide us with a platform for dealing with tax havens. Britain can't stop tax havens, nor can France or Germany. Europe can stop tax havens. The EU allows us to avoid the rat race to the bottom by collectively refusing to work the kind of 60 hour weeks they have in the poorer parts of the world that are frightening us.

What needs to happen is a more direct democratic mandate for the EU.

ja da pfeift der Wind so kalt.

Über deine Höhen pfeift der Wind so kalt


jedoch der kleinste Sonnenschein


dringt tief in´s Herz hinein

gehn des Sonntags gern zum Tanz

Unless there are some serious serious reforms to the way the euro works, at some point a big country will decide that it has had enough and will exit. And that will be the end of the story. The euro is causing a slow-burning recession to the whole continent. 

Again, no, I don't see that. I see that some eurozone countries lost competitiveness, and didn't automatically get the stabilisation effect of market devaluation of their currencies. I can see that countries may need to take different policy steps to move out of recession than those they've undertaken in the past, but also maybe not. Ireland moved out of its Eighties recession by pursuing similar policy goals to its current mix.

As far as I can see, all that the euro really prevents is adjustment by devaluation, and I'm not sure that that devaluation was a particularly good policy.

I'd say an advantage you have living in Madrid is being able to integrate yourself into Spanish culture a bit more. It's the hub of everything Spanish and you'll totally see that. Madrid also has fantastic night life. I lived in an apartment in the center of the city with other Europeans and made some great friends all over and ended up visiting some of their families. I'd say it's easier to place yourself into an international community while in Madrid because there are less Americans (still there are a ton, but less than Barcelona). Also, if you choose to study in Madrid, find someplace to live in the center rather than by your school. The commute in the mornings won't be bad, so it's more worth it to live in the center. 

 For Barcelona, your chances of being sucked into the same American lifestyle and not really immersing yourself in culture is a possibility, but then again that depends on how you shape your experience.  I visited some friends studying in Barcelona while I was there and it felt just like college at home but in a larger city. It's just super easy to gravitate to what's too similar there. However, Barcelona has amazing restaurants, bars, cafés and shopping. There's also more of an underground bohemian culture which I love.

However, when I went to Brussels for a visit to the Parliament and to see life in Brussels in general, I met a very interesting Romanian girl working at a bar owned by her family. She spoke a ridiculous number of languages, casually switched to perfect Turkish to English to French to Arabic to Romanian to German as the regulars came and went. As someone who knows only English and a middling grasp of French, it blew my mind. She held a Bachelor's degree in some scientific subject I can't recall.

Anyway, we basically talked about what Romanians are like, bearing in mind the Romanian gypsy stereotype I was aware of. She said that there are basically two types of Romanians. One is massively aspirational, educated and hard working, yet hard done-by. The other are what people identify as gypsies, for which the stereotype is entirely true. You can tell the difference at a glance because the women in the former group almost always wear trousers, and the latter wear dresses.

Needless to say, the entire family at the bar wore trousers, and during the rest of my stay I frequently spotted the traditional Romanian dresses worn by beggars.

Sto abbandonando la piscina dove abbiamo passato il pomeriggio che, colto da follia amorosa, rientro, la fermo e le dico che la sera ""noi"" (aka io) ci troviamo sempre a tal bar nel paese e che mi avrebbe fatto piacere se fosse passata di lì. (Parafraso il linguaggio dei 13enni).


A casa dopo cena scappo in bagno e, ricordo distintamente, per la prima volta mi preparo ad un appuntamento che, per questioni anagrafiche, era puramente platonico. Scelgo i vestiti migliori, mi lavo, probabilmente rubo anche un po' di colonia del nonno...


Arrivo al bar e lei non c'é. Come ogni sera vado nella zona dei videogiochi a guardare i bambini ricchi e/o viziati spendere centinaia e centinaia di lire in partite (potrei ricevere una laurea in Metal Slug pur avendoci giocato una dozzina di volte in tutto). Ovviamente sono nervosissimo e mi guardo intorno ogni 30 secondi per vedere se la ragazza stesse arrivando, con quel misto di speranza che arrivi e rassegnazione che non arrivi mai.


Come sempre accade è mentre non mi sto guardando in giro che lei arriva. E non solo arriva, ma si spinge in mezzo ai ragazzini per raggiungermi e farmi sapere che sì, ha accettato ed è veramente venuta in quel covo di nerd per incontrarmi.


Panico. Sorrido nervoso e balbetto qualcosa sul fatto che sta finendo la partita (di un altro bambino, ricordiamolo), mi giro verso lo schermo e inizio a sudare. Pianifico di offrirle un gelato, o forse di fare una passeggiata, poi penso al fatto che probabilmente è passata per caso, o per noia, o perché pensava ci fossero anche i miei amici ""fighi"" (non che ne avessi, ma chi le capisce le donne?).


Mi giro, pensando siano passati 2 minuti al massimo. Erano passati 20 minuti. Disperato esco dal bar, vago per il paese per mezz'ora sperando di incontrarla. Alla fine torno a casa.

true,Seldon_,null,null,"I feel that I wasn't really clear about my stance on the issue with my initial post here:

I don't think it's really meaningful to call for recognition from Turkey. It doesn't realistically solve any current problems the Armenians have right now, and it doesn't take into account the political consequences that *could* follow from it.

* First, the issue will never be fully settled with simply an apology. Some Armenians might be satisfied with that, but others still will demand a transfer of assets or territory and Turkey's admission would validate their claims. 

* Second, it doesn't stop at Armenia either. The most likely and immediate effect of an apology would be to encourage Kurdish separatism. Also, it would encourage the Greeks to push for international recognition of their own expulsion from Asia Minor, and *they* might have land claims of their own. At the very least, the financial cost of reparations and restitution to a number of different groups for past grievances would be staggering. 

* Third, in the absence of the current international system, it would potentially give Greece and Armenia a legitimate casus belli against Turkey. And in the event of war, they would almost certainly be supported by Russia. Armenia is allied with the them, and Greece and Cyprus are friendly to them. There is also the question of Iran, who might intervene on behalf of the Kurds, since they are an Iranic people.

Moreover, the Turks—or at least the nationalists—are [under the suspicion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A8vres_Syndrome) that foreign powers seek to carve them up, most notably Greece and Armenia. They also expect little sympathy from Europe; most Europeans see them as non-Western, and many consider them little more than Islamic invaders. One could put even their alliances with the Western powers into question, as they are purely strategic and have no common ideological, ethnic, or religious background.

So no, it isn't possible for a situation like this to not be political, and because of that you have to understand why the Turks refuse to accept the Armenian position. They have no interest in poking at centuries-old wounds. They have no territorial claims against other countries, and have no desire to have territorial claims opened up against them. One could argue that Turkey's recognition isn't necessary to form a potential coalition against them, but it might be a catalyst for a future conflict in the region.

That is of course always possible, but as far as I can see, what the eurozone nations have given up are certain policy instruments which were very blunt, rather unreliable, and not without negative side-effects - national interest rates, devaluation, and money-printing, basically. These were already sufficiently poorly handled by national governments that they were generally given up as powers to independent central banks, but even in those hands they weren't particularly good policy instruments, particularly the latter two.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"TBF, I do kind of sympathise with what you're saying, and it's hard to say that as a Brit to an American. Britain's role in WWII, I think, is often over stated. However, I do also think that America's role in both World Wars is overstated in the European Theatre (Asian Theatre is obviously a completely different matter though). 

I certainly think that Truman is an equally important president as FDR in terms of effects on World history. FDR was the one who pushed the USA's legally bound neutrality to breaking point which led to the USA getting involved in the war which did have a huge effect, even if that effect is often over stated. Truman was involved in the post war settlement, which is basically as important as the entire war (what's the point of starting  or joining a war, if not to change/decide how it ends). Dropping a nuclear bomb is not that significant to World history. It's certainly a big deal from a moral point of view, and it will always stand out as the first time nuclear weapons were used. However, at the end of the day they were just two really big bombs and neither of them killed as many people as the fire bombings of Tokyo did. 

Churchill has a lot of similarities with Roosevelt IMO. Churchill could have chosen to continue its appeasement policy after they realised what a fight it would be to contain Nazi Germany. British involvement in the war certainly saved Western Europe from either being under Nazi occupation or Soviet occupation. If Britain had surrendered (which, as the Blitzes continued would have seemed like an ever more appealing idea) then there would have been no bastion of resistance to the Germans in Europe, apart from in the far East. 

The thing which potentially makes him important is that he could have decided to make Britain surrender, but he didn't. Also, his military tactics played a huge role in us being able to win the battle of Britain and hold out. Other leaders might not have been able to do that. And he played a huge role in shaping the settlement. 

But, if not for him, there would have been a lot of other British prime ministers who would have taken similar choices. Not all of them. He still deserves a lot of credit, but I don't think he quite deserves to be in the top five most influential figures in European history of all time.

I had a feeling this is what you were talking about. Your malcontent customers case ended with the court siding with the defendants and awarding them attorney's fees. Also, companies with a lot of money can afford to be patent trolls just about anywhere. The same ""swipe"" nonsense was filed in the US, South Korea, and Germany. 

I will be the last to say reform cant take happen, especially in areas like medical malpractice. In fact, a serious amount of reform has happened in this field in most states. Appeals courts are a panel of judges (no jurors). In many states you have an automatic right of appeal, in the Federal system its not automatic, but in practice it is essentially. 

I will be the last to say some reform cant happen, but the vast majority of cases are legitimate. That is why when emerging markets issue debt the choice of law and jurisdiction is always London or New York. You will virtually never see any other choices, even in Asia where Hong Kong might seem like a good choice of venue. 

If you pick and chose you can find disagreeable cases in every court system. I was pretty disgusted by the *Bloomberg v. ECB* ruling. Bloomberg made a legitimate freedom of information request to see how much Northern politicians knew about potential problems during the Euro's formation. They were fought all the way to the ECJ which denied their claim and slapped them with the ECB's legal fees for the entire process. Bloomberg can afford it, but it certainly sends the right message to individuals, small businesses, or civic minded attorneys, keep your nose out of here, or we will deal you a financially crippling blow. But I wouldn't condemn the entire court system over it. 

If you look at choice of law/choice of venue contractual provisions, non-US companies/parties to a contract *very* often chose US states or DC for any contract disputes. There are issues, but if they were as dire as many people make them out to be, I dont think companies/parties would not only voluntarily subject themselves to it, and it would not be one of the top (if not the top) destination for them to do so.

I am not sure where you got that information. OECD data shows that poor Americans are actually [better off](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2013/05/blogs/graphic-detail/20130601_gdc707.png) than poor Brits. I actually know people that have lived in London and other parts of Europe (incl. Brussels, Germany, NL). They all had good things to say, but many of them still preferred the US (especially if they were minorities). It was fairly common to hear people mention how surprised they were it was so ""white"". I also worked with several Europeans that happened to not be white who ran into a slew of issues there. So there are pros and cons. 

&gt;if the excellent quality of life in Europe turns out to be economically unsustainable, that would change my view completely.

They are certainly facing challenges. Before the debt crisis the Bank of Greece published a report cautioning about the demographic changes that will take place in the future. Greece is not exclusive to this club, however. If you look at UN projections, the vast majority of the developed world will see very significant population declines by the end of this century (incl. Japan, China, SK, Europe + Russia). The US is projected to gain a very significant amount of people 40%+ (thanks to immigration). As the dependency ratio changes due to an aging population, it makes these social programs much more diffucult to fund. For instance, by China's own estimates, its dependency ratio will go from 3:1 workers to pensioners now, to 1:2 workers to pensioners in just 30 years. 

If you think the quality of life is better there, I'd be the first to tell you to go check it out. If you already have US citizenship you can keep it and if things dont work out you can come back. But I think its important to stay in a place long enough to see how it actually is to live there. So many people (redditors especially) have grass-is-always-greener goggles on that blinds them to how life is in a certain place. I know a girl from Toronto who's life goal was to make it to London, that is all she wanted. Now that she's there she *hates* it and is planning on coming back. 

If you thin you'll be happier check it out, but be careful not to only stay there long enough that vacation mode doesn't wear off. ",0,1398444720,null,0,false,0,ch1uk45,t3_23v6r1,t1_ch1uk45,t1_ch1nhnk,null,1433517697,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Chiamai un taxi e raccolsi i pochi soldi che avevo guadagnato quella settimana distribuendo il giornale. Lei abitava lontano e quindi la corsa mi costò ben 30 dollari (sui 20 euro). Quando arrivai lei era calmissima, non mi disse nulla e siccome mi aspettavo di essere accolto in eroe, fui incapace di reagire bene e proposi che giocassimo a carte. Lo facemmo. E basta. Finisce lì. Niente, nemmeno un abbraccio, un sorriso... soltanto un ""grazie per essere venuto"". 

Allora uscii a prendere l'autobus... e lo vidi che si allontanava all'orizzonte. Era l'ultimo quella sera.

&gt;  Hell, you're from Norway we get paid $ 1.000+ for taking an academic degree in anything. Lots of Americans have something like $ 30.000+ in debt when they graduate.

The $1000 dollars or something a month are student loans though. 40% of it gets turned in to a scholarship if you pass the exam. That means that you will end up with student loans anyway.

Yes, Germans can be very blunt but it learned to take this as an advantage, you talk about stuff honestly then you can move on without resentment. If your friend and his girlfriend hugged you, it's not an empty gesture, because in my experience Germans don't just do stuff like that because ""that's just what you should do in that situation"", it's because they truly care.

true,Lap1nRose,null,null,"bonjour,
Je suis corse d'origine et comme la plus part je vis la plus part de mon temps en dehors de la corse. Je vote et passe toute mes vacances en corse et je tien a cette origine.

Pour commencer ce n'est pas une LOI, c'est une délibération (voeu de l'assemblé corse). Ca change la donne, tout simplement celle ci n'a pas de porté législatif et ne sera donc pas appliquer. 

La délibération est clairement contraire au réglementation EU et elle sera annuler avant même d'être appliquer c'est sur.
Comme l'a dit Tiger_6 c est un coup politique de Giacobbi suite à monté de l'indépendantisme qui au dernière élection à largement avancé. 

Après il suffit de regarder les propriété en corse pour ce rendre compte ( si je me souviens bien de la statistique) que plus de 80% des terrain/maison/logement appartienne à des corses. 

Il a toujours été difficile d'acheter en corse même pour un corse, nous avons mit 7ans avant de trouvé un accord pour notre terrain...

Alors oui des villes comme porto vecchio, calvi, L'Île-Rousse, bonifacio spécule et se développe vitesse grand V mais pour moi c'est normal.
Pour ceux qui vont souvent en corse, vous l'aurez vu ""ça construit partout ! "". Ca construit partout mais les réglementation mise en place empêche de construire tout et n'importe quoi ( oui il y a des exception je parle de l'ensemble).

La corse, pour moi, à un problème à régler et ce n'est pas une question de spéculation immobilière classique (acheter a X pour revendre 2 mois plus tard a 4X parce que tout le monde veux acheter comme à paris ou autre), Valls (même si je ne suis pas souvent d'accord avec lui) avait pointer du doigt les notaires corses et leur silence.
Le problème ce trouve ici, en corse il n'y a pas ou très peux de contrôle, résultat le marché est manipuler (mafia, politique, indé, un peux tout le monde). Les notaires ne sont pas ""obliger"" de dénoncé des opération ""suspect"", passer un terrain inconstructible en constructible avec l'aide de la marie, d'un bergé et d'un ""expert"" ...

Mais il faut aussi voire le bon coté, le port en haut profonde de bastia, la voie rapide, les zones prorogé, la démolition des maisons contraire au réglementation ou sans permit de construire (la encore des exception c est sur.)

Après pour répondre a Lrpt : les avantage fiscale et autre réglementation particulières sont en grande majorité, des lois qui date d'avant 1900 et qui avait été mise en place à l'époque pour permettre au corse de vivre, et oui à l'époque et pendant très longtemps la corse à été un lieu très pauvre ( pas d'industrie, pas de valeur en matériaux ou en production). Il y a bien eu le vins pendant les années 50 qui était reconnue mais cette industrie à souffert dans les années 60 ce qui mènera à la fondation du FLNC.
Le reste des cadeaux fiscal et autre aménagement sont un remercient, que l'on doit à De Gaulle pour le sacrifice du peuple corse lors de la 1er et 2em guerre mondial.

Comme le dit tiger_6 ce n'est pas pour autant que les prix sont moins chère, sur certain c'est le cas (les clopes ...), mais le reste est aussi chère qu'à paris ( les courses ...)

Pour répondre à my_baby_ate_dingos : La corse est ""légalement"" et au vus du droit international ""indépendante"", la réalité c'est que la corse à été tellement pauvre pendant plus de 150ans que sans la France et l’Europe ( surtout l'Europe) elle serrait dans un état lamentable. Et la majorité des corses le savent et ne vote pas indépendantiste.

RO was not only better placed in all synthetic benchmarks but, more importantly, we are one of the most pro-EU member countries, with strong ties with the US and VERY hardcore anti-Russian views.

Joining the EU was enormously beneficial to our health as a nation and I would put as the most important benefit the fact that our justice system actually started to work in ways that were unthinkable before. In my opinion, the single most important factor that contributed to getting the justice system operational was pressure from EU (and to a lesser extent from US). So if we wouldn't have joined EU I'm CERTAIN we wouldn't have progressed so fast in this regard. Everything else, like economical benefits, are of secondary importance to me.

So I would say RO was the right choice at the right time (just before the crisis froze everything), a choice that extended EU about as far as it can reach and created a 2nd strong, reliable, eastern border country, after PL.

Ich kann mich noch gut daran erinnern, als vor ca. 10-15 Jahren so ganz langsam konsequent die Erkenntnis einzog, dass nicht alle Français zur Résistance gehörten, dass recht viele entweder schwiegen oder gar mitmachten, und dass man so ziemlich viel aus der eigenen Geschichte recht konsequent überdenken müsste.

Oder bei uns Schweizern.  Ich gehöre vermutlich zur letzten Generation, denen noch die Mythen der heldenhaften Neutralität beigebracht wurde, von der Aktivdienstgeneration die den bösen Deutschen die Stirn bot. 

Als in den späten 90er Jahren die Realisierung herauskam, was unsere Regierung und Banken während und nach des Krieges alles für Scheisse anstellten, haute das fast jede gute Begründung für erzwungenen Pragmatismus während des Krieges (z.B. mit den Nazis mit Kriegsmaterial wirtschaften) vom Sockel.  Mein Grossvater, ein armer Kleinbauer der den Krieg in einem Bunker an der Französischen Grenze verbrachte, glaubte bis ans Lebensende an die alte Mär.

Ich glaube aber, dass das ""alle Deutschen waren mitschuldig"" Extrem genau so unpassend ist wie entweder ""häh, Nazis?  Wo denn?  Sagt mir irgendwas, komm, lasst uns das Ganze doch vergessen, besser so"" oder ""wir hatten null Wahl"".  Klar trägt jeder Bürger einer Gesellschaft irgendwie auch nur ein Bisschen Mitverantwortlichkeit für gesellschaftliche Entwicklungen, aber diese Mitverantwortlichkeit umfasst eine sehr, sehr breite Spanne und macht auch nur mit recht viel zeitlichem Kontext Sinn.

There's no base for that in the UK. Ireland, possibly. The NSW Right faction of the Australian Labor Party, probably, but England? Scotland?

If you give them a fine, they won't pay; there are no bank accounts from which you may forcibly withdraw or freeze.

a) Fyrom is [laying claims to Greek land](http://macedonia-evidence.org/documentation.html#territorialaspirations). Publishing maps, stamps, school history books etc that depict your country expanding into your neighbour's land is hostile behaviour and it's not surprising that the Greeks treat it as such;

&gt;experience

It sounds like you will love Barcelona, but you can't really go wrong with either, as they're both amazing cities.


&gt;day trips

Madrid has Toledo, Segovia, Avila and Salamanca all less than 2 hours driving away, plus you'll get to Sevilla, Alicante, Málaga and Barcelona in less than 3 hours on the AVE (high speed train). 

Barcelona has a lot of beautiful scenery around and some charming seaside towns, but nowhere near as many historical and medieval towns as what is around Madrid. Girona, Sitges, Montserrat, Figueres and maybe Andorra (for curiosity's sake) is worth a visit and within day trip distance from Barcelona.

They are not illegal immigrants. They are European citizens, mate. The French and British authorities give them around 300 euros each to return to Romania. Some do, some don't. Also, they haven't been here for thousands of years - more like a couple of centuries - and they are now migrating to the west. They are as much Romanian as they are English or Swedish, you ignorant prick.


&gt;It's ironic that you're claiming to be civilised and yet you're not recognising the Romanian Gypsy population as being Romanian

It's because they are not fucking Romanian ! Not even them see themselves as Romanians. They have their own flag, culture and language. 

&gt;your language is bordering on the way the Nazis described German Jews.

Have you even read my comment? I said that integration is the only solution, everything else is out of the question.

&gt;Never mind thousands of years of co-existence, their culture is different so they can't possibly be legitimate citizens.

This is very different to what occurred in the early United States. A distinct people were fundamentally dispossessed, disenfranchised, killed, driven off their lands and forced into reservations. Genocide has occurred in Europe, but the movement of peoples and evolution of languages and cultures as a result does not constitute genocide.

In reality, national narratives are just feel-good stories to bind the population of a state together.

Was meinst du was da (immer noch!) fuer'n Film gehen wuerde. Dagegen waer die Krimkrise die Werbung im Vorspann...es geht eben _nicht_ um das Endresultat, es geht um die Methoden die man benutzt, um es zu erreichen.

Na klar stehen die ex-NATO-Laender bzw. Alliierten der USA im KK heute sehr viel besser da als ihre Ostaequivalente. Aber ist das System Turbokapitalismus wirklich so viel besser als das System Pseudokommunismus? Das ist zumindest zweifelhaft.

Und was ueberhaupt nicht zweifelhaft ist ist die Tatsache, daß beide Großmaechte damals wie heute mit exakt denselben Methoden vorgehen. Methoden die, wenn sie von einer nichtstaatlichen Identitaet oder sogar eines anderen, 'geringeren' Staates kommen, zu Recht als Terrorismus bezeichnet werden. Nimm doch mal Palaestina. Da hast du Menschen, die von anderen Menschen ihres Landes beraubt wurden. Punkt. Ohne jetzt in die ganze Geschichte einzusteigen und am Ende als Antisemit gebrandmarkt zu werden: cool story bro. Die wollen also endlich in Frieden leben, und die Amis bomben ein paar Tausend Kilometer entfernt Land um Land in die Steinzeit zurueck, entweder weil WAR ON TERROR!!1 oder weil MASSENVERNICHTUNGSWAFFEN!!1.

Der War on Terror ist halt schon im Begriff eine traurige Ironie.

Wenn aber nun Rußland mit sehr viel sanfteren Methoden (Kiev steht m.W. noch) den Teil eines Landes absichert, in dem a) 80% der Menschen ethnische Russen sind und der b) von sie von groeßtem strategischen Interesse ist, dann ist das monatelang das Thema, wird durch alle Medien und UN-Kommittees gedrueckt. Der boese Russe halt. Aber hey, ist ja okay, ne? Der westliche Zweck heiligt schließlich die Mittel, oder? Wenn Du wirklich so denkst dann tut's mir Leid, aber das kann und will ich ethisch nicht nachvollziehen.

Um mal noch nen Vergleich zu ziehen: dieser ganze Krim-Kram ist in etwa so, als haette Hawaii in den 30ern nen Brief nach Washington geschickt mit dem Inhalt 'Ne, sorry, wir haben keinen Bock mehr auf euch, geht euch woanders nen Pazifikkriegshafen suchen. Wir machen jetzt bei den Japanern mit. Ciao.' Genau so mußt Du Sevastopol naemlich sehen.

Germans are highly educated and perform skilled jobs, eastern europeans come and take the low end jobs (they are well paid compared to Romania). If you look at unemployment rates in Germany they are very low compared to other places. Germany is doing well and people are attracted to it, which in turn creates more possibilities for jobs. In fact many germans have more than one job! Also, migrant workers are not neccessarily permanent. People love their home countries and many return there once they have improved. Germany would do better to take in educated eastern europeans than asylum seekers and uneducated 3rd world economic migrants. Eastern europeans succeed in integration, work hard and are generally a success.

Die SS-Leute waren wenigstens noch gezwungen, mit uns zu leben; sie trugen nicht diese Kaplanskleidung, sie trugen den Totenkopf. 

&gt; Er würde sich nachher mit seiner Frau und seinen Kindern zu Tisch begeben, und er würde vielleicht von seinem Ausfall erzählen, von seiner Mannestat. Wir hatten ihm dazu gedient, seine Jungfernschaft auf diese ungefährliche Goldbrillenart zu verlieren. 

&gt; Jetzt wurde die sichtbare Tünche aller Dinge auf dem Lande draußen, die uns im Verlaufe des Transports von Buchenwald so aufgefallen war, zur Provokation. Die Lüge der Ehrbarkeit dieses Mannes, die Lüge seines freundlichen Gesichtes und seines Bürgerhauses waren entsetzlich. Die Enthüllung der Raserei der SS, die sich in aller Ruhe vollzog, rief vielleicht nicht soviel Haß hervor wie die Lüge dieses Nazi-Bürgertums, das diese Raserei nährte, sie hätschelte, sie mit ihrem Blut, ihren ""Werten"" nährte.

Man kann den Kranken noch soviele Fußtritte in den Leib versetzen oder sie umbringen, Menschen, die Durchfall haben, zwingen, in einer Kirche eingeschlossen zu bleiben und sie dann erschießen, weil sie hineingeschissen haben, zum millionsten Mal brüllen *Alles Scheiße, alles Scheiße*, es gibt zwischen ihnen und uns eine Bindung, eine Beziehung, die nichts zerstören kann. Sie wissen, was sie tun, sie wissen, was man mit uns tut. Sie wissen es, als ob sie wir wären. Sie sind es. Und ihr seid wir! Wir sehen jeden dieser Menschen an, ""der nichts weiß"", wir möchten uns in jedes Bewußtsein einnisten, das nichts anderes bemerkt haben möchte als ein Stück gestreiften Stoff oder eine Reihe von Menschen oder ein bärtiges Gesicht oder den martialischen SS-Mann, der an der Spitze geht. Man wird uns nicht kennen. Jedesmal, wenn wir durch eine Stadt kommen, kommt Menschenschlaf durch Menschenschlaf. Genau das ist der Schein. Aber wir wissen alles, die einen sowohl wie die andern und die einen von den andern.

Es ist wirklich schon genug, fliehen, in Viehwaggons steigen zu müssen; die Feinde, die Bomben, das ist alles grausam, doch man weiß, was das bedeutet, das läßt rotes Blut fließen, man schreibt in den Zeitungen darüber; der Krieg ist eine Institution. Aber die, die da liegen, die hätte man besser nicht gesehen, außerdem war der Waggon geschlossen. In der Regel sind sie versteckt, aber natürlich kann man in solchen Augenblicken auf sie stoßen.

Zuletzt ein Zitat von Traudl Junge, dass ich leider gerade nur auf Englisch zur Hand habe:

&gt; Of course, the terrible things I heard from the Nuremberg Trials, about the six million Jews and the people from other races who were killed, were facts that shocked me deeply. But I wasn't able to see the connection with my own past. I was satisfied that I wasn't personally to blame and that I hadn't known about those things. I wasn't aware of the extent. But one day I went past the memorial plaque which had been put up for Sophie Scholl in Franz Josef Strasse, and I saw that she was born the same year as me, and she was executed the same year I started working for Hitler. And at that moment I actually sensed that it was no excuse to be young, and that it would have been possible to find things out.

And that personally I don't really feel nationalistic, in fact I do not at all it's the other way around, yet I still don't like the ""historical lies"" etc.

I assume your position is that ""Greeks don't have a monopoly on the region's history"" or that ""No one in Greece or the Balkans is pure"". And those are both correct. And I would be totally OK is Skopjans claimed some historical connection with Ancient Greeks.

But that's not what they are doing. They only take one part of Ancient Greeks. On a geographical and quasi-arbitrary basis. That doesn't historically make sense. They are not saying we are descended from Ancient Greeks. But from Ancient Macedonians and NOT Ancient Greeks. Which does not even make sense, the Macedonians even themselves identified as Greeks. And how they fuck would they all end up there in that tiny region?

You want to know why they are doing this, cause the very reason they went back in history and talked about historical lineage, is because part of their population feels Bulgarian, to put it bluntly. And they don't want this to exist. But if they talked about the entire Ancient Greece it would make people feel Greek or sth, so they avoid that too. And the propaganda is that they are from Ancient Macedonians only. Meanwhile even geographically their region wasn't even in Ancient Macedonia, it was called Dardania, enemies of the Macedonians lived there.

So what's their fucking problem, I'd be OK if they were like we're ethnically part Greek, part Bulgarian, part Serb, but we are now a different nation. But instead of that they just disintegrate greek history. And what pisses of greeks, even non nationalists sometimes like myself, is that people abroad do not understand this concept. They all think the greeks are doing it cause they are overly proud or overly nationalist (about being pure or something). And they think that anything FYROM says has some sort of priority for political reasons. It's not about nationalism, you can't tell me I'm wrong, in my face, about something I am actually right about, and leave it like ""who gives a shit"".",0,1398458285,null,0,false,0,ch21axw,t3_23ypw1,t1_ch21axw,t1_ch1ycm3,null,1433520940,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

Single flat: Costs quite a bit, especially on a student budget. Is great that you don't have to share anything/clean after other people. ~400€/month

WG: Second most expensive, great with the right flatmates, instant contacts and friends, which is really helpful if you are new in town. Can play out horribly with the wrong flatmates (antisocial/dirty/unreliable).Research the WG you'd move into strongly to see if you're compatible. ~300-350€/month

Dorm: (My choice) Pretty cheap. Lots of contacts if you so desire (bars in the basement/floor parties/BBQ). Really different between the different dorms though. Shared/own kitchen and/or bathroom etc. Compare the different dorms and the way they are organised. Be careful, the waiting lists are horrendously long, wait times of 15 months+ are normal for the well liked dorms. ~200-250€/month",0,1398459377,null,0,false,0,ch21tiy,t3_23z6gs,t1_ch21tiy,t3_23z6gs,null,1433521183,2,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,2

There's a town nearby that's populated entirely by Lithuanian-Americans, and they identify strongly as Lithuanians.  So do all the Italian-Americans I know, some of whom speak Italian still.  There's lots of Poles around here too, who always cook ethnic cuisine for local festivals.   

Side example, I'm an American of Kashmiri ancestry.  I tell people I'm Kashmiri.  I've met people from Kashmir.  No one has ever told me I'm not Kashmiri because I wasn't born in Kashmir or I can't speak Kashmiri.  Kashmiris from Kashmir have never said that to me.  In fact, I've had a Kashmiri dude tell me I'm more Kashmiri than he is, since his family is Pashtun rather than ethnic Kashmiri, though he was actually born and raised in Kashmir.

Similarly, I've known Chinese-, Vietnamese-, Indian-, Pakistani-Americans all of whom identify with their ancestral ethnicity, and never receive mockery from their ancestral homelands.

Does the concept of ethnicity suddenly not exist in Europe?  I guess it's weakened heavily by the concept of a nation-state.  By binding the concept of nation (ethnicity) so strongly with the state, you've got the side effect of equating ethnicity to citizenship.

Greek by that point was the lingua franca of the whole eastern empire and was spoken by many more peoples than just greeks. To say that the greeks of the E.R.E. considered themselves greek just based on the language they spoke would be to claim that modern Americans (U.S.) also consider thelselves English. 

Pagan communties existed ,within what is now modern greece only until 1000AD. Specifically that was in the Mani peninsula in the Peloponnesus. That's almost 400 years before the ottoman invasions began.

There is much evidence for the fact that ordinary, non educated, greeks didn't consider themselves as anything but roman up until the revolution of 1821 and in some cases further still into the 20th century even. That is common knowledge among Greeks nowadays as the evidence for it is overwhelming. The only ones who deny that are thick headed nationalists who like to cherry pick or even make up stuff about greek history to suit their nationalistic fantasy.

That means that students living in the dorms manage themself, which means there are other ways to bypass the waiting list. The BA(Belegungsausschuss those in charge of choosing new inhabitants) have control over the waiting list and so although there is a waiting list for my dorm, most people who move in come reguarly beforehand to introduce themself and partake in the dorms activites (mostly the bar).

It's really complicated. The word *Vlach* is of Germanic origin and was used historically to identify neighbouring (to the Germanics) Romanized populations. Cognates include Walloon and Welsh. The Poles call Italians *Włochi*.

Now the Vlachs in Serbia are no different from Romanians (at least linguistically), they just choose a different identity - I remember some exchanges with one of them here. She posted some links to various Vlach language sites; it's really a form of archaic Romanian with a heavy Banat (SW Romania) accent (the Serbian-like alphabet allows that to be recognized).

I can understand in excess of 90% of the language (there's some Serbisms in there), and there's a couple of archaic grammatical features like infinitive instead of indicative in certain contexts, but otherwise fully understandable.

In terms of Europe, the best I can describe England is 60% proud/elitist, 40% self-deprecation. English people mostly don't really feel like part of Europe. There's the British Isles, and then there's Europe, which is a seperate thing. They feel like they can survive on their own, and don't really need Europe. But then again they also like to belittle their own country.

I can't speak for the rest of Britain though.

How much of original Irish, Scottish or Welsh culture has survived?  

Their languages are nearly dead and their distinctive cultural traditions have been more or less quashed.  Or even the Corns as a more extreme example - they're indistinguishable from the English.  Those identities exist almost entirely on the precepts of heritage and a few cultural left-overs, no different from most Louisiana Cajuns or Creoles who can't speak French, but use the occasional word and have their cuisine.

It's just an ethnic self-identification based on ancestry.  As to why we consider ancestry to be more important the culture - it goes back to how American society integrates immigrants.

They get away with it just as much as any other drug dealer. But if you're talking about the metrosexual pseudo-gypsies in downtown Lisbon, those people aren't selling drugs. They're selling things they call drugs, which is hardly the same thing. Cops have them under control there, instead of making them leave downtown and be out of the police's reach.

&gt; pay no taxes

They don't ""work"". How can they pay taxes if they don't declare the money they earn? The problem is that they don't declare the money they earn. You make it sound like they make an honest living but don't have to pay taxes because they're gypsies.

For the Eiffel tower, if you don't mind the stairs, lines will be shorter. There are less people in the morning but the view may not be as beautiful; afternoons have a better lightning the interesting neighborhoods, imho.

L'aquarium du Trocadero is quite expensive and thus, not too crowded, except during weekends when they program special activities for children. I enjoyed my last visit there. Nothing comparable to the huge US aquariums like the one in Atlanta... far more intimate, don't expect to meet large, exceptional animals, just relax and take your time. Interestingly, it is contains also some movie props and even a (really) small theater where you can enjoy a movie (in French).

You could go to the Opera Bastille too. If you are under 28, you can try to grab last minute, cheap places. If you stay for longer, you should definitely check the ""Abonnement jeunes"" (young pass): 3 operas + 1 concert for under 100€. It's a real steal (although it can be tough for a broke student).

You could try la manufacture de chocolat d'Alain Ducasse (http://www.lechocolat-alainducasse.com/). You should have a chance to observe how it is done there.

If you want to go to a club, try le Badaboum: http://www.badaboum-paris.com/

For another park suggestion, go to the Jardin D'acclimatation which, quite unusually, offers a taste of Brazil, right now: http://www.jardindacclimatation.fr/

Speaking of Brazil, if you are a fan of football and want to taste the ambiance of the crowd in front of giant urban screens, forget it: there won't be any this year in Paris. You will have to go to Bruxelles for this! Not a bad choice as they have a very good team and a very supportive fan base.

June is also a good time to travel outside Paris: you can go to Reims and visit some famous Champagne houses, the Cathedral and have a nice dinner. It's better if you can grab a car and stay 2 days in the area.

Tours is allegedly under appreciated. If you have the chance to go there during Vitiloire (wine festival), you should have a great experience: http://vitiloire.tours.fr/

When the weather is nice, Lille is a good destination too, 1h from Paris using the TGV. It's more interesting for its popular neighborhoods/markets/old city places and talking/gathering with young people.

Sorry, I realize I'm not really answering your question if I go too far from Paris. Let me know if you need more in the capital.

Il Doge ovviamente non approvava la relazione, così la fanciulla consigliò all'amato di andare a combattere contro i Turchi per nascondere la propria condizione con la gloria delle imprese. La fama di Tancredi fece il giro del mondo, il giovane si distinse valorosamente in guerra, ma fu ferito mortalmente e cadde su un roseto. Prima di morire però affidò all’amico Orlando un bocciolo tinto del rosso del suo sangue perché lo consegnasse alla sua amata come estremo pegno d’amore. Il 25 aprile, il giorno dopo aver ricevuto da Orlando il messaggio d’amore dell’innamorato, Maria fu trovata morta nel suo letto con il bocciolo sul petto. Da allora, il 25 aprile la tradizione vuole che lo stesso omaggio sia ripetuto dai veneziani perché ognuno di essi possa esprimere i propri sentimenti alla persona amata.",0,1398465819,null,0,false,0,ch24mzk,t3_23zh3c,t1_ch24mzk,t3_23zh3c,null,1433522511,4,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,4

Ethnicity is itself a very fluid concept over history and is as much about how yourself and others perceive it. For instance, the borders between Swede, Dane, Norwegian, and Finn have moved a lot over the past 500 years, and the linguistic borders have been moved to follow (the huge grammatical differences between western and eastern Danish do not make Copenhagen less Danish than Jutland, large parts of the Norwegian constitution are to this day written in Danish, and there are tens of thousands of Swedish-speakers in Finland who are viewed as much as Finns as Swedes). And that's not getting into Greece, where Albanian, Aromanian, and Slavic speakers are all viewed as cultural subsets of ""ethnic Greeks"" while third-generation Greek-Americans are not. 

In short, it really depends on upbringing and identity. Europeans consist of dozens, if not hundreds of ethnic groups that in turn can be split into any number of tiny regional identities, while white Americans consist of one ethnic group (with Cajuns being an arguable exception) and white Canadians consisting of two (Anglophone and Francophone; Italians, Celts, Germans, and Ukrainians have generally assimilated to one or the other).

It's still irrelevant. Was the Norse culture not just as 'native European' as that of the Picts? At no point in Europe's history were all its collective peoples attacked and nearly destroyed by an outside aggressor, as took place in the United States. It just didn't happen.

Yes, there were inter-tribal wars, but the reason why you don't see people living in the manner they did 8000 years ago in Europe is *not* because of ethnic cleansing, it's because of cultural and scientific advancement.

true,Vive_la_France,null,null,"La fin des Etats-Nations est la fin de la démocratie. Démocratie veut dire souveraineté du peuple. Or, la Nation est l'incarnation politique du peuple. On peut mettre l'Etat à trois niveaux:

Local, le pouvoir peut appartenir au peuple, mais le pouvoir devient trop faible pour agir dans l'intérêt de celui-ci.

Supranational, avec beaucoup de ressources, mais le pouvoir n'appartient plus au peuple (dans le meilleur des cas, le pouvoir appartient à un consensus à minima entre les différents peuples qui composent la fédération, dans le cas le plus probable, le pouvoir appartient à une aristocratie). 

National, le pouvoir peut appartenir au peuple, et la Nation est assez grande pour agir en fonction des intérêts du peuple.

Il est évident qu'un peuple, une Nation, ne peut pas faire face à un certain nombre de problèmes tout seul, comme la question de l'environnement. Ce n'est pas pour autant qu'il faut lui arracher sa souveraineté. Le peuple doit rester souverain, que se soit sur des questions économiques, d'immigration, de sécurité, de défense, de santé, etc. L'argument des supranationalistes est toujours le même, ""il ne faut pas se retrancher"", mais c'est du n'importe quoi! Depuis quand un peuple souverain se retranche-t-il nécessairement? On peut très bien imaginer une Europe des Etats-Nations où les représentants des peuples prennent certaines décisions ensemble, dans un ""Conseil des Nations européennes"", une sorte de Nations-Unis à l'échelle continentale, par exemple sur la réduction des émissions de gaz à effet de serre, mais où les compétences qui émanent de la souveraineté résident dans le peuple.

Je cite pour finir l'Article III des DÉCLARATION DES DROITS DE L’HOMME ET DU CITOYEN DE 1789:

Concernant les limitations de posts et de réponses ça me semble très contre-productif. Je pourrais voir l'intérêt si on était plus nombreux mais là à mon avis ça ralentirais les soumissions et l'intérêt pour le jeu. On peut toujours essayer pendant un moment pour voir si ça plait.

Pour le classement c'est une question intéressante, qui vaudrait peut être un sondage. On ne joue vraiment pas pour ça mais c'est toujours bien de voir où chacun en est. Honnêtement à l'heure actuelle là encore on est toujours trop peu nombreux à mon avis et si on remet les compteurs à zéro je pense que rapidement le nouveau ressemblera beaucoup à l'actuel.

America wants a strong EU.

UK has been reluctant about the EU for its own reasons.  They often talk about Europe like they aren't part of it.  They have their own legal traditions which they don't think Europe understands.

When you're talking about the heritage thing in the US, a lot of the identity isn't actually supposed to relate to Europeans, it's supposed to foster community with other *Americans*. It's immigrants finding community with other immigrants, not people from the old country. 

Especially in casual speech, no one ever bothers to clarify that they are identifying as XXXX-American. In the US, everyone is ""just"" French, or Irish, or Chinese. If you're speaking English without too much issue, it'll be assumed that you mean xxxx-American. If you've got an really pronounced accent or something you'll then get the stupid sounding question ""So are you, like, French French?"" Or ""You're actually from Spain?""

While there certainly are some people in the US who think that having some sort of heritage makes them identical to people who are actually living in that country, they're in the minority. If, for example, you're Irish, and talking to an American who tells you that he's also Irish, all he's really doing is trying to find common ground. They're kind of expecting you to come back with something along the lines of ""Oh that's cool, my uncle used to live in the US,"" or ""My brother went to school in New York"" or something like that. They know it's not the same, they're just excited to meet someone new, and are trying to be inclusive.

Admittedly, the gesture might be a bit misplaced, and I can definitely see how it might get tiring if you hear it all the time. But I can't really wrap my head around the hostility you run into sometimes. If I was in Europe and someone told me that they were American because their grandfather lived in America, I'd be pretty ok with it.

There's lots of nationalism in America.  We have no lack of patriotism.

The lacking factor is an old culture that gives us a sense of common identity with ancient ancestors.  We have a culture - jazz, baseball, hip hop, rock music, hyper consumerism, Evangelical Christianity, guns - but it's relatively young.  Many Americans choose to identify with older cultures to which they have an ancestral connection.  But there are plenty of 'Muricans who are fully culturally American.

It's quite common for European families to have lived in their country since time immemorial, but lots of Americans have only been in the US for three or four generations.  Just like people whose grandparents immigrated to Europe often identify with the culture that their ancestors immigrated from (e.g., Arabs), so do many Americans.

true,lebenohnestaedte,null,null,"Dorms may be largely or entire occupied by foreign students. This isn't great if you want to meet Germans. In my experience, if you have a studio in a Studentenwohnheim, you don't get to know your neighbours, and unless you make an effort to go to ""new residents"" events and stuff, you might not get to know anyone. If you have a room with shared kitchen/bathroom, you might get good roommates who hang out, but you also might end up with a bunch of people who politely share space but otherwise aren't interested in being friends/hanging out/doing things together. I've personally experienced or had friends who experienced all these situations. I'd make an effort to get into a dorm where German students also live, suggest going to events to meet people, and cross my fingers.

WG would be my preference, and I did try searching for one. However, it can be pretty competitive in student-filled cities; lots of people want to live with good roommates in a desirable location. People will basically hold ""roommate auditions"", and they might not want someone who will leave soon as then they have to go through all of it again. If you're out of country, that'll make it *hard* -- why risk having a roommate you only met through Skype when you could instead rent to someone you can meet in person? Speaking German well will greatly help you here. I got way better responses to WG searching (I did a bit of looking halfway through my year abroad) after six months in Germany; I was at a B2/2 level at arrival and probably a low C1 after 6 months. I was amazed how much easier it was to write letters that showed my personality the second time around. (I got better responses, too, but maybe that was just cuz I was in Germany and available to meet people in person). You might try finding people on exchange and sublet, switching partway through the year if you can only find people doing semester exchanges.

true,canteloupy,ZBSuisse,Suisse,"Je pense qu'il y a des domaines où effectivement les marchés ne fonctionnent pas. Par exemple lorsque l'infrastructure est très lourde, et nécessite de toutes manières une grosse centralisation et des aides publiques (le rail, les transports en commun, les aéroports, l'électricité, le gaz, etc.), mais aussi lorsque l'utilité publique est telle que c'est un service essentiel qu'on ne pourra jamais se permettre de laisser couler. Ce dernier point englobe les services postaux, certains telecoms, la santé, l'éducation...

Et si on veut des mauvais exemples il y en a plein aux USA (universités...) et en angleterre (rail...). Il y a aussi toujours plein d'exemples de mauvaise gestion publique mais pour moi ce modèle devrait être celui adopté par défaut s'il n'y a pas la preuve que la privatisation donnera de meilleurs résultats, simplement parce que je préfère que ça soit l'Etat qui dépense mes impôts plutôt qu'ils contribuent à une industrie privée, même si les deux ont des défauts. Au moins j'ai mon mot à dire sur la gestion de l'Etat, tandis qu'en l'abandonnant au privé on ne peut que leur faire de remontrances sans aucunes dents, vu qu'on est contraints de payer tout de même (voir ce qui se passe actuellement aux USA pour le financement de l'internet à haut débit : les FAI encaissent les aides et ne livrent rien).

Mais bon justement la position des fournisseur d'accès internet/téléphonie est une grande question. En théorie la compétition pour le mobile devrait pouvoir marcher, mais il semblerait que l'investissement en infrastructure est tout de même très lourd. En Suisse on a un opérateur qui était historiquement national qui a été privatisé et des années plus tard il domine encore massivement le marché parce que les deux concurrents n'ont pas les forces individuellement de pallier les années de retard d'investissement en infrastructures, sans compter évidemment le lourd passif de confiance engendré chez le consommateur. Et pour les réseaux fixes c'est encore pire, il y a des monopoles de fait dans de nombreux endroits, pareil pour le câble.

The EU as it currently stands stops existing when the generality of countries withdraw from it. No member state has ever left, though Algeria and Greenland used to be part of the EU, but they were not MSes in their own right.

A plausible exit for a MS is for a withdrawalist Eurosceptic party (e.g., UKIP) to obtain the balance of power in the national legislature, and force an in-out referendum. Over time, this will happen in every member state, and some of the referendums will be won. Once they've all been won, no more EU. Such a process may take centuries.

However, withdrawal events are not independent: if people see a country leave the EU and prosper, this will increase the chances of further withdrawal events. That's why the UK's current withdrawal debate is alarming to Brussels.

The UK formed in 1708 (or thereabouts) and absorbed Ireland in 1800. Most of Ireland left in 1922, and Scotland and Northern Ireland may leave in the coming decades.

I still recommend going to Pommery if you only have time for one champagne tour. Of all the tours I've done it's the most thorough and interesting and you get a real guide (not some audio guide). There's also always cool art exhibitions down in the caves at Pommery! They do tours in English French and German every day even on public holidays.
So I think you should go to Pommery on the Thurs then try to go to the cathedral on the Friday. You will need to call both places and book in advance by the look of it.

true,jurble,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt;but Americans can give the appearance of associating the modern peoples with what their cultures were rather than are, which can cause offence.

That sort of argument I could understand, but it's not the argument presented in this thread by those decrying American practice.

Looking again at the Celtic nations of Britain, their cultures have changed, true, but the ethnic identity of those lands is entirely dependent on ancestry and the recentness or incompleteness of assimilation.   Cumbrian identity is extinct because they were assimilated by the English earlier than the other Celtic groups, before any sort of national consciousness could develop to preserve it.   In terms of distinctiveness, a guy from Cumbria has as much in common with a Londoner as a Corn does, yet the former identifies as a Englishman and the latter as a Corn.   And it's entirely for arbitrary reasons.

Yet, those arbitrary reasons are taken as acceptable cause for ethnic affiliation, while an American's claim of identity or affiliation on ancestral grounds is seen as absurd.   On what basis is one reasonable and other absurd?

Further, as I raise in my initial post, why does does this sort of argument vis a vis American ethnic identity seem to be restricted to Europe?  As noted, Asian countries do *not* care what various Asian-Americans call themselves.  I really do think it's an outgrowth of the nation-state and the binding of identity with political status.

I did not make that claim.

The Picts and Gaels and Bretons were the aboriginal people of the UK or do they not teach you that in school there?  

&gt;Yes, there were inter-tribal wars, but the reason why you don't see people living in the manner they did 8000 years ago in Europe is not because of ethnic cleansing, it's because of cultural and scientific advancement.

6K USD is about 4.3K Euro, which is not enough to live for a year in Madrid without some other source of income. I would say the absolutely minimum you could get by with comfortably would be something like 700-1k/month. Rent would probably run from 3-500/month and then you can figure another 1-150 for ""gastos"" (heat, water, electricity, internet), and maybe 50-100 for food for the week. 

Having taught privately (albeit not in Madrid) I usually made about 100-150/week from private teaching and working at schools. The problem with this is that it is an incredibly unreliable source of income. You need to find a school that doesn't really care about your criteria or work papers (which may be more difficult in a city like Madrid), private work requires finding customers, which if you know nobody may be difficult, clients cancel all the time, and you are basically at their mercy. It's certainly do-able but you'd need to build up a customer base which can be difficult in a saturated city like Madrid when you know nobody. (on top of which I don't think you'd be able to charge more than 10-12 euro/h). You'd basically have to put signs up on telephone poles/ad boards, go on craigslist/milanuncios etc and hope you get a few bites who decide to stick with you. And as I already said finding a school who'll hire you without any papers may be difficult. 

Beyond the prices, as everyone else mentioned you would be staying in the Schengen zone illegally once your 90 day period was up and that can have serious consequences for re-entry and if you travel out during that time you may not be allowed back in for a while. Not to mention I don't think you can set up a bank account without a residence number, which means you'd be relying on depositing cash into your US bank account from abroad (if they even have a branch in Spain), or putting it under your bed.

So is it doable? Arguably yes. Is teaching english privately a good way to fund your year? No. It is unreliable, low-paying and difficult to break into profitably. You're much better off going with a program that guarantees you a minimum income and supplementing it from there. That being said 4.3K euro will let you live comfortably for probably 5-6 months with minimal travel.

I think most Greeks would be ok with a name like ""North Macedonia"" or ""Vardar Macedonia"" . That would more or less end the dispute imo.

And I also think that the current name is actually conductive to ""more nationalism"". It might sound counter intuitive, but look at the state of FYROM right now. Not that I know their internal affairs that well, but from my understanding, they seem to have been establishing an ""upper class"", which btw often diverts funds from where they are needed, to themselves, or to building grandiose monuments or something. And their excuse is what, that they are doing their nation a service by fighting this battle against the ""enemies"".

Meanwhile in Greece, it has been subdued due to the crisis, but there was also a case of that kind of thing, it was possible for someone to get more votes (and eventually influence in the greek state's cronyism system) by expressing strong views about this issue. For example, and to put things in perspective, back in 1993 the 2 countries had almost settled on the name ""Slavomakedonja"", except a few Greek politicians (including the current PM) saw it as an opportunity to ""lead the right"" by expressing a more ""unyielding"" stance.

Which is what I am saying the Greek political scene has too much ""fanatical idealism"" in it, and they are all prone to groupthink. They were thinking that if we are going to adopt a really hard and ""proud"" attitude, and show a few pictures of the Parthenon, then the rest of the world will magically agree with us. But just because this works in Greek politics it doesn't mean it's going to work in international diplomacy.

So imo they should just strike a quick deal, North Macedonia, acknowledge the ""integrity"" of Ancient Greek history, get in the EU, done. I think the real problem is the ground for political influence that there exists due to the current situation, that I talked above. Perhaps if FYROM gets in the EU it will go along as you say and they won't have the excuse to stay in power, then maybe we will be like in 1993 and this time Greece should just end it and ignore the fanatics and political opportunists.
