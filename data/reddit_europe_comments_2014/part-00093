China lost lots of different territories at the hands of foreign powers. The topic is frequently discussed in China.  However, what's conspicuously missing from the conversation is the territory lost to Russia.

Bringing these lost territories into the conversation is inconvenient for two basic reasons: 1. Much of the territory was given away by Mao in exchange for Soviet aid. 2. Publicly demonizing Russia is (generally) not in the best interests of the government.

China rightfully claims to have been victimized by foreign powers during its 'Century of Humiliation', and it's not afraid to remind those powers. Except Russia.

true,Dall0o,IDF,Ile-de-France,"&gt; La France est un pilier et doit donc montrer l'exemple aux peuples européens en sortant d'abord de l'euro, qui ne marche pas et ne marchera jamais

L'euro est loin d'être mauvais. Il varie beaucoup ... comme toutes les monnaies. En ce moment, [ça va pas trop mal](http://www.lesechos.fr/entreprises-secteurs/finance-marches/actu/afp-00593591-l-euro-se-maintient-a-la-hausse-le-marche-attend-l-emploi-americain-661332.php). La livre s'en sort un peu mieux, mais la différence est mineure.

&gt; L'UE est devenue une religion, on est pour l'UE, sans se rendre compte de ce qu'elle est devenue, c'est à dire un truc ingérable de 28 pays qui n'ont rien en commun.

Tout ce qui est suivit/accepté/prôné sans compréhension réelle peut tenir du dogme. Une transparence absolue et une simplification accroîtraient la compréhension, l'implication et l'accès aux défauts comme aux qualités de cette entité.

&gt; Comment veux tu avoir une politique commune avec tant de différences économiques ? Évidemment qu'il faut en sortir.

La grande majorité des pays d'Europe on subit une disparité économique. L'exemple le plus parlant est, je pense, l'Allemagne après la réunification. [La différence économique entre la RDA et la RFA](http://www.histoire.ac-versailles.fr/old/magazine/goodbyeleninfiche.htm) était prononcée. Si aujourd'hui cette séparation peut encore apparaître, elle est quasiment effacée. Changeons d'échelle et nous passons de pays au continent.

&gt; Avec ces 28 pays, c'est impossible de la changer, de faire une Europe sociale, ou tout simplement de sortir de cette situation de chômage, déflation, et croissance moribonde.

Je peux me tromper, mais je ne vois pas en quoi l'UE augmente ces facteurs. La GB n'a pas été touché comme la France ou l'Allemagne. L'article ne prouve pas que sans l'UE, notre pays aurait fait un meilleur score. Si tu as une source là dessus je suis preneur.

&gt; C'est ça la construction européenne. Et ça me dégoûte qu'on ait réussi à faire croire que c'était bien.

Pauvre chou. Il y a bien plus dégoûtant je trouve qu'un groupe de pays tentant de s'unir pour ne pas sombrer. (OMC, FMI, etc.)

&gt; Pourquoi ? Ça n'a aucun rapport. Il n'y a pas d'image européenne. Il y a une image allemande, une image française, une image italienne etc. etc. Personne dans le monde ne dit ""c'est fabriqué en Europe"", alors que ça peut être un produit allemand ou bulgare.

On parle pourtant de [puissance économique](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89conomie_de_l'Union_europ%C3%A9enne#Part_dans_le_PIB_mondial). Bien que bordélique, elle est considéré comme [une entité à part entière](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2005&amp;ey=2009&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=001%2C998&amp;s=NGDPD&amp;grp=1&amp;a=1&amp;pr.x=60&amp;pr.y=14). En attendant un ""made in EU"", on peut se targuer d'avoir des [labels de qualité exemplaires](http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/organic/index_fr.htm).


&gt; Je suis pour l'Europe, pour la construction européenne et non l'auto-destruction europénnen.
Donc je suis contre l'UE.

Curieusement, je suis de ton avis. Sans même résonnement, mais de ton avis. Aujourd'hui, l'UE est schizophrène. Ca part dans tous les sens. L'unité présenté est une illusion.

Je suis pour l'Europe, pour la construction européenne et pour sa construction de l'intérieure. Gardons ce qui fonctionne, repensons le reste. Élargissons ce qui n'est pas fait. Accentuons l'unité. Parlons d'une seule voix.

Donc je suis pour l'UE ... mais en version 2.0.

It's not just upper-middle class students, it's the opposition in general. The students are often on the front lines doing the most aggressive things because they're young and bold and idealistic. But the movement is broader than that, and it's not just the wealthy. It's upper-middle class, middle class, working class and urban poor. Chavez and now Maduro have run out of innovative policies to help propel Venezuela forward; they did good things to bring modernity to rural Indians, but their policies have becoming increasingly painful for the urban middle/working classes. These people represent a huge portion of the population and they currently are struggling to purchase even the most basic goods, [like toilet paper.](http://m.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-24185342)

Chavez and Maduro have relied on hydrocarbon revenue to fund their social projects; and now that hydrocarbon prices are beginning to fall, they can no longer afford to maintain the status quo.

Furthermore, the protestors are the nations educated intelligentsia, artists and journalists. They certainly are from the upper  /middles classes, but they are not aristocrats who poop on golden toilets.

true,Aemilius_Paulus,RUSS,Russia,"Not many are naive enough to  *truly* believe that nations are friends simply for the sake of being friends, despite what some of the comments here seem to dig at on the surface. Friendship is always about aligned interests. I find Merkel's present very amusing, but it isn't serious at all, at least not in the manner that the some of the childish comments of this thread suggest. Paradoxically, 'trolling' is the most mature way of conveying the situation here, because that's what she did at best, there is nothing more to this -- if there is even that, this could be a simple present.

China and Russia currently align very well because they are both usually running a foreign policy that directly conflicts with the mostly liberal and mostly democratic West, whereas Russia and China are the heads of a mostly authoritarian and more repressed nations of the world. They will always stick together as far as they both run these policies because they cannot afford to go against each other, since united they can make somewhat of a stand against the West, but disunited the combined power of EU and US dwarfs each individual country (in fact, both China and Russia still have a long way to go to reach the EU or US level of development or aggregate power)

No amount of silly presents will even so much as cause a pinprick in the relations. That China doesn't want Crimea to happen to them is obvious, but Putin will never do that. Both China and Russia are afraid of Western interventionism because they are afraid the West may take advantage of them when the internal dissent in either countries bubbles its way to a real revolution.

China isn't afraid of Crimea being some sort of an example or precedent, they shit on these things just as for that matter the West will shit on the very international laws it 'creates'. There is right in might and China will quash any internal dissent with repression and blood, as it always did. Xinjiang and Tibet will always bubble, Crimea or no Crimea. Crimea is a non-issue for them, they know they aren't going to get any fallout from it. They will politely refrain from making strongly worded statements either way, but they quitely support Russia much in the same way Russia will give its quiet support to any territorial disputes that China might get with Pakistan",0,1396410604,null,0,false,0,cghwkfu,t3_21xmw7,t1_cghwkfu,t1_cghgq6k,null,1433172191,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12
true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"&gt; Il me semble pas que les obligations émises par la l'Etat soit liées au cours de la betterave ou du ketchup.

Et pourtant, c'est quasiment ça. Le secteur privé est fort pour une chose: créer le produit dont tu as besoin. Et les emprunts dont les maires ont besoin, c'est des prêts qui coûteront zéro tant qu'ils seront en fonction. Les banques leur ont mijoté ça: des taux variables indexés sur un peu n'importe quoi, typiquement sur des paniers de monnaies différentes mais ça peut être sur un indice perso d'inflation, donc le ketchup et la betterave, c'est pas forcément loin!

Et on ne sait pas quelle quantité de dettes moisies ont été contractées par les différentes villes et régions, qui ne s'en vantent pas des masses. On aime bien cité le cas de Saint Etienne, en procès avec Dexia, qui a vu un taux d'intérêt passer de 4% à 24% en quelques années ! Mais Le Monde en cite pas mal d'autres: 
http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2014/03/14/emprunts-toxiques-comment-les-villes-de-gauche-ont-fait-face_4381575_4355770.html

D'où la nécessité d'un audit. Et franchement, je trouve que l'était Français devrait avoir une ""centrale d'achat pour ces prêts. Ce n'est pas normal que les communes aillent individuellement se faire tondre chez des banques privées. Pourquoi la France emprunte à 2% et ses villes à 4 ou 5 ? L'état a l'intention de laisser des villes faire faillite ? Si non, d'où vient la différence ?

&gt; Certains pays ont une ""règle d'or"" qui empêche, sauf situation économique très dégradée, d'avoir un déficit supérieur à X%

C'est X% du PIB. Aujourd'hui le PIB est une mesure à peu près fiable parce qu'il n'y a pas de grand intérêt à le bidouiller. Mais le jour où ça devient crucial pour la politique monétaire, je te gonfle les chiffres du PIB ou du commerce extérieur d'autant de milliards que tu veux: il suffit de créer deux entités qui échangent de la valeur sur un truc fictif, comme les brevets ou les droits d'exploitations d’œuvres. Ces règles d'or, c'est de la poudre aux yeux.

&gt; De plus, il y a des ""stabilisateurs"" dans le cas d'un endettement auprès du secteur privé. Le taux d'intérêt peut monter si l'endettement du pays devient trop importants

Mais comme je te le disais pour les villes, le secteur privé te vend le produit dont tu rêves. Tu veux financer tes projets à taux zéro ? Pas de problème, voila tes milliards. On fait payer la note à ton successeur. 

&gt; Pour l'endettement auprès de la banque centrale, ces stabilisateurs existent pas puisque tu en as le contrôle (elle n'est plus indépendante dans ce cas là)

""indépendante"" est un mot intéressant. Indépendant vis à vis de qui ? Ta banque est soit dépendante de l'état, soit dépendante du secteur privé. Ce que les financiers privés veulent dire quand ils parlent de ""banque indépendante"" c'est en vérité ""banque qu'on peut contrôler sans interférence de l'état"".

&gt; Donc quand tu remarques que tu peux d'endetter à 0% auprès de cette fameuse banque centrale, t'as pas forcément envie de t'en priver.

Pourtant, l'histoire montre que cette sagesse populaire se vérifie rarement. Hors zone euro, beaucoup d'états sont responsable de leur propre création monétaire. Ça revient à faire de l'argent gratuit. Les abus sont très rares.

&gt; Et à la différence de tes problèmes de budget, ça, ça fout le bordel dans l'économie mondiale.

Tu noteras qu'en 2007, l'économie mondial a été bien foutue en bordel par les emprunts toxiques du secteur privé. Le même type d'emprunt que les municipalités sont obligées de contracter aujourd'hui, faute de banque publique qui les financent. 

&gt; C'est pour ça que les variations de monnaie trop importantes étaient impossible entre 1945 et 1973, les principales monnaies étaient liées au dollar et personne ne pouvait en faire n'importe quoi. 

On a juste dévalué le franc une dizaine de fois...

I would argue US exposure to possible conflict with Russia through Eastern European NATO members *far* outweighs any benefit it gets from it. Especially since they seem to think NATO membership has given them permission to slash the vast majority of their own defense capabilities in favor of transferring the expense to the US. So even if there never is a conflict, these cuts make the benefit to the US even more questionable.

&gt;They are heavily reliant economically and politically on the role of global enforcer 

The US provides roughly 75% of NATOs capabilities. France and the UK make up much of the rest. The US has been asking its NATO partners to meet their 2% targets for years. The highest ranking US defense official said he realized meeting that goal is unrealistic for many European members right now but encouraged them to consolidate forces to avoid redundancy. For the most part this has not happened. 

I see the argument the US is vested in keeping the status quo. But the highest ranking defense official has said the US may even withdraw from NATO if European members dont start to take their defense more seriously. Since his speech, most responded with even further cuts. ",0,1396414876,null,0,false,0,cghy0m7,t3_21x9fg,t1_cghy0m7,t1_cghxk1u,null,1433172874,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Rien sur l'industrie, l'école, la recherche, la santé, la culture. 

Il pourrait trouver grâce à mes yeux s'il réussissait à faire taire les egos du PS, à mettre en place un réel plan de réductions budgétaires ciblées sur les secteurs où l'Etat est en surcharge pondérale ( S'il décide de supprimer les départements par exemple, on pourra dire que son mandat était une bonne chose ), s'il trouvait un moyen de résoudre le sous-investissement chronique français en matière de logement, s'il remettait de la proportionnelle pour déverouiller le jeu politique.  

La question du chômage demeure importante, c'est évident. Mais les marges de manoeuvre sont plus limitées au niveau d'un mandat car on a plutôt affaire à des tendances de fond comme la sous-qualification de la population active et le mauvais positionnement des entreprises françaises.

By absolute value, at least 6 EU members spend more money on defence. By percentage of GDP, 4 or 5 member states spend more on defence. Other countries in Europe, but not in the EU, also have higher levels of spending, either by absolute or relative measure. 

As to spending the money more wisely, different countries have different defence needs, different military doctrines, and so on.

A similar situation exists in the UK; the Conservatives and Labour are insipid, and as their support shrinks it creates gaps for far right groups such as UKIP and the BNP. UKIP, especially, is gaining momentum, largely due to a belief among the older, white middle classes that modern politics isn't doing enough to tackle immigration. I don't think they'll ever attract enough support to cause serious damage on a parliamentary level (and I believe the same about the FN), but you're right in that there's a clear message: a notable section of western European populations is hard right wing, and the liberal centre infuriates them. The ""two turd"" situation in France is even worse in the UK, I think, which means many people, like you, become disgruntled with mainstream politics. Ironically, it's the more politically engaged population that eventually becomes so annoyed with the situation it stop voting (or votes tactically to try to shake things up), hence the low turn-outs in the recent French elections. It's a position people like Marine le Pen and Nigel Farage (UKIP) love, because it allows them to increase their percentage of the vote and take a platform (here's an example of what's happening in Britain at the moment: http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-26843996).

I'm English, obviously, and I can't vote here, but I will disagree with you on one point. I don't believe the FN popularity in France is *only* due to weakness in the other parties. There definitely is an ""anti-foreign"" undercurrent in certain elements of French society, and I think anyone who's lived here for any length of time will see overt racist attitudes in general society. I live in Lorraine now, but before this I spent over three years in Corrèze. Some people there would literally refuse to look me in the eye, let alone speak to me, and I'm a white European. The life of North African immigrants in France, for example, can be extremely hard thanks to racist attitudes both on social and official levels. The hard right does have a natural, racist support in France. There absolutely was a strong vein of very conservative politics in *la campagne*: France for the French, and all that.

Diese Vorschrift, die bis 1977 galt und erst durch das 1. Gesetz zur Reform des Ehe- und Familienrechts vom 14.06.1976 in die jetzt geltende Fassung geändert wurde, hat möglicherweise Feministinnen zu dem Schluss veranlasst, ""dass bis 1977 Frauen ihre Ehemänner um Erlaubnis fragen mussten, ... wenn sie einer beruflichen Tätigkeit nachgehen wollten"".

Well, if you name geopolitical reasons, I cite Thomas Jeffersons encounter with Sidi Haji Abdul Rahman Adja, Tripoli's envoy to London, before any of the ""geopolitical reasons"" you think are responsible have been in place.

&gt;&gt;The ambassador answered us that [their right] was founded on the Laws of the Prophet, that it was written in their Koran, that all nations who should not have answered their authority were sinners, that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they could be found, and to make slaves of all they could take as prisoners, and that every Mussulman who should be slain in battle was sure to go to Paradise.


&gt;They couldn't have been a response to American imperialism (the start of the conflict precedes the presidency of George Washington), U.S. foreign policy, globalization, AIPAC or Islamophobia. Yet his words are virtually identical to those spouted ad nauseum by jihadists today who justify their bellicosity as a reaction to these U.S.-centric factors, which were nonexistent in Adja's time.

&gt;How do we make sense of this? Well, the common denominator here just happens to be the elephant in the room.

The whole article is worth the read. (btw, written by an ex-muslim, who should have been killed according to the hadith for being that alone, and not because of geopolitical reasons)

As Mr. Hitchens said it. ""Jefferson said, ""well in that case, we take our Navy and destroy this criminal endeavour you have there."" And a good thing that he did.""

Well, limiting religious freedom is a real problem in western countries (but actually still best in western countries, by FAR), but actual policies are not widely supported, only the denuded version of ""do you think muslims too much here?"" Not even a minarette ban would be going through in most western countries.

And of course, while religious freedom is important, I think the freedom to stay alive and not get mutilated trumps the freedom to practise religion, even though both are very important, so comparing ""country A is bad because they kill girls who want to get an education"" to ""country B is bad because some people there want no mosques built.""

Comunque non avere la macchina vuol dire essere molto avvantaggiati! 
Ti dico solo che il sottoscritto tra rata mensile prestito, bollo, assicurazione, benzina (conta che devo farmi 24km totali al giorno per andare\tornare da lavoro) e meccanico ha speso nel 2013 la bellezza di €5150, pari a €425 al mese!
La situazione migliorerà quest'anno con la chiusura del finanziamento per la macchina, anche se di poco, visto che la cifra media si attesterà comunque sui €210 al mese...salvo visite improvvise dal meccanico....

Avendo tenuto una sorta di contabilità dettagliata in Excel per tutto l'anno 2013 posso menzionare anche altri costi che influiscono molto:
- €450 Spese mediche (medicine,analisi del sangue, visite oculistiche o di routine, controllo dentista, pulizia denti ecc ecc)
- €150 Ricariche cellulare (Promozione €10 al mese + costo chiamate ecc)

Vi parlo di spese minime avendo avuto, per fortuna, un'ottima salute in tutto il 2013 e un ""buon rapporto"" con il dentista!

Zweitens musz man diese Vorschriften auch rechtlich sauber einordnen. Wenn jemandem als Ehegattem, wie auch heute noch in § 1367 II S.1, die Berechtigung erteilt wird, arbeiten zu gehen, dann muss es dafuer einen Grund geben. Neben der Klarstellungsfunktion (heute ist es anders als damals) geht es auch darum deutlich zu machen, dass sich aus der ehelichen Lebensgemeinschaft grundsaetzlich keine Ruecksichtnahmepflicht ableiten laesst, die es einem Ehegatten untersagen wuerde eine Arbeit aufzunehmen. 

Das ist dann auch nicht einklagbar in dem Sinne, dass ein Anspruch gegen die Frau auf Aufloesung ihres ehewidrigen Arbeitsverhaeltnisses besteht. Frueher waere es theoretisch einklagbar gewesen, wenn sie dadurch ihre ehelichen Pflicht verletzen wuerde - aber auch erst dann. Die Vorschrift, im Zusammenhang mit dem Kommentar von Soergel, der sich wiederum in seiner Auslegung auf das GG bezieht, ist also zumindest so zu lesen, dass eine Ehefrau solange berufstaetig sein durfte, bis sie ihre Pflichten in Ehe und Familie vernachlaessigt haette.

Minimo minimo trovi un contratto a €20 che io sappia....

* Telefono
potrei dirti 15€ minimo in quanto conta che se vivi da solo è più facile che tu abbia la necessità di fare più telefonate, io pago dai €12 ai €15 al mese ora che vivo con i miei, figurati da solo.

* Palestra/piscina/sport 
la cifra mi sembra corretta, conta però che sono bisogni secondari rispetto a tanti altri e che, oltretutto, volendo uno può andare a correre al parco e fare palestra a casa!
Certo non è lo stesso ma se si è presi con ""le pezze ar culo"" può comunque funzionare!
Ah comunque io pagando annuale spendo €34 al mese di palestra, su questo sono fortunato.

* 1 serata pizza e cinema.
Beh qui €40 sono tantini per i miei gusti, non so quanto costa dove vivi tu ma qui in Veneto l'entrata al cinema costa €8 ed una pizza d'asporto €7 esagerando.
Potrei dirti: 
Entrata cinema + Pizza asporto = €15
Entrata cinema + Pizzeria = €20

* 4 gelati
Beh va beh questa la trovo una cifra irrisoria, poi i soldi vanno spesi in birra non in gelato...eh che quarzo! :)

* Un hobby (misero) a scelta: 20 euro
Beh qui dipende da molti fattori, io avendo la passione della chitarra e suonando in due gruppi posso dirti che spendo moolto di più al mese, ma dipende da hobby a hobby!

In definitiva è vero che le spese sono tante, ma ricordiamoci che esistono anche le alternative e che vivere da soli significa anche non poter fare tutto quello che si poteva fare vivendo con i genitori!
Bisogna saper scendere a compromessi ed è questo che frena molti giovani italiani e lasciare il nido di mamma e papà.

*""Andare a vivere da solo? Sei matto?!?! 
Spendo 100 euro ogni weekend per uscire con gli altri, sai, tra entrata in disco, tavoli, alcol, bottiglie di Grey Goose comprate in colletta, aperitivi...poi conta che devo pagarmi l'abbonamento\rata dell'iPhone, la Golf GTI, la palestra, i vestiti (firmati) e mettermi via i soldi per le vacanze ad Ibiza! 
Secondo te come faccio a vivere da solo? Il problema è che le paghe sono basse e gli affitti troppo alti per noi giovani!""**

Germans in general don't necessarily see the EU as positive and haven't fully realized yet that Germany seems to be coming out on top. Keep in mind that for most of the time the EU and its predecessor organisations have existed, they were designed to keep Germany in check, and that's how they were perceived in Germany and how people remember them. Until recently, German foreign policy was primarily about not pissing off the rest of Europe too much so they don't try something like the Euro again. It takes a while to switch from that attitude to one that allows you to lead.

That somebody sees things differently from you doesn't make that person naive. The way I look at it, it seems dangerously ignorant how narrowly and one-sided the current conflict is being presented.

Just to make this perfectly clear, I do *not* support Putin, his actions, or the way this seems to be presented in Russia, at all. But there's a wider context to it, and to ignore it is counterproductive and can only lead to further escalation. We must take Putin's situation and the Russian perspective into account to open a way of deescalation, which is only possible if he doesn't lose face by going along with it. An explanation is not the same as a justification.

From Russia's perspective, the West has spent the post-Soviet years chipping away on its sphere of influence. Despite the 2+4 Treaty, NATO expanded eastwards. Of course this all looks pretty legitimate from a Western perspective, but from Russia's point of view, it must seem like we think they're stupid when we say ""oh, but we meant no NATO expansion *within Germany*"" while the US is building a missile shield in Poland that is capable of severely limiting Russia's Second Strike capability.  
To then give Ukraine an either-or choice went a step too far, and put Putin into a position where, domestically, he had to draw a line to not appear weak. Russia's economy is underdeveloped, a sense of being at least a regional military power that is to be ""respected"" is pretty much all they have left of their former superpower status aside from oil and gas.

Again, this doesn't make it right, but *if* we want to deescalate instead of having another Cold War, we need to take Russia's perspective and Putin's domestic political situation into account. There can't be a solution if we adopt a purely one-sided us vs. them mentality.",0,1396427970,null,0,false,0,cgi0r8c,t3_21xq8d,t1_cgi0r8c,t1_cghtpmy,null,1433174164,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

There is reason to not take it literally, yes. Germany has always been very strongly on the side of the US with the occassional wave of anti-American sentiment. Currently there is such a wave, but it doesn't mean everyone changed their opinions: it is just that the anti-US folks get some airtime and the rest reevaluate their positions.

It does not, in any way mean that the general populace has turned anti-American.

true,trycatch1,RUSS,Russia,"&gt; Journalist can't be separated from ethics. But the people you see on the screen -- they often can't be called journalists, because often they are just agitators. And agitator, author of a pamphlet or a writer -- has the right to do it, as well as an artist has the right to paint the picture in red, entirely, and to say ""that's how I see the world"", that's my artistic vision. But journalists have no right to do it, because the task of the journalist, in my opinion, is to demonstrate the true proportions of the world, to show the whole picture of the world. It is rather a problem of the public, which looks at the screen and must understand who is in front of them - a journalist or an agitator.

&gt; We are talking about professional journalism. If we say ""the crowd eat that up"", then they will eat up perpetual lowering of the bar -- more vulgar, more naked... Any scandalous behavior, any lowering of the bar, any decline in morality and rules -- and the crowd will eat that up. But then one day we'll find ourselves in mud taking bath like pigs. And the society will be like that. And we will eat each other with mud. And that's where we'll find ourselves. And there would be nowhere to fall lower.

I call that: Cherry-picking model. And sadly: That's how large portion of UK media imagines it'll look like, while anyone saying anything against that is automatically marked as an evil pro-eu lobbyist.

&gt; The decision on whether to approve the final UK-EU deal would be made by a so-called qualified majority vote, in which the UK itself would not take part. A strengthened protectionist block of southern states could permanently block any liberal deal, whilst, without the UK, a northern liberal alliance would be radically weakened. 

Oh, I love these simplifications... evil south and good north.

&gt; Under EU law, the European Parliament – notoriously integrationist – could also veto both an exit deal and future trade deals

Of course they can. Otherwise any country could demand to leave EU while still having a say in it's polices and cherry pick best trade deals, like in proposed ""ideal world"". Oh, and implying that being pro-integration is something evil got boring 2 years ago.

&gt; Better Off Outers often make the valid point that “we sell more to them than they sell to us”, implying that the EU would strike a generous post-Brexit trade deal out of sheer self-interest. However, while a post-Brexit UK could fairly easy strike a new deal on goods,

Fact is, there almost is no political group of any significance taking a public pro Putin stands. Yes, there are extreme right wingers and other fringe groups admiring the guy. Both, the far left and the far right have a zest for authority. Simply, because the world doesn't run their way, they want somebody make it run their way by sheer force.

Sure, some extremist parties holds some mayor seats or has representatives in local or regional governments. ""Die Linke"" has some seats in the Bundestag, but even they did not take an official pro Putins stance.

So the notion that Germany (or Austria) is full of Putin Bugs derives mainly from postings in online forums. Which of course will be flooded by conspiracy theorists and fringe groups at any such occasion. Just like with Libya or Syria. But those guys, as vocal as they seem to be, are nowhere near actually wielding any significant political power anywhere.

There was *one* lawmaker meeting with Snowden (Hans-Christian Ströbele from the Greens), and the video link was with the EU parliament. The NSA revelations sure did have a sharper edge, though, because the whole notion of privacy in Germany is a different one than, say, in the US, and its given a much higher priority. Simply put, the US notion of privacy is one that is mostly restricted to your home, whereas Germany's is tied to the person. This includes e.g., pictures, even if taken in public, and especially data.

&gt;  Vladimir Putin mocked the US in an New York Times oped

Yeah, *Putin's* Op-Ed. Not Merkel's.

&gt;  the US was unable to impose any real costs on Assad for gassing civilians

Because getting involved in Syria, when there's no viable better party to support, would be fucking stupid. Also, it was the British parliament that voted against that.

&gt; Snowden managed to destroy the bilateral ties with Brazil

Snowden, or the NSA?

&gt;  Germany was kicking the US when it was already down and out.

How that? The way I look at it, it was close to embarrassing how the German government bent over backwards to gloss over the revelations initially, because apparently when you get caught spying it's up to the one who has been spied on to make sure relations aren't affected by this.

&gt; I guess at the end what is the most bothersome, is that Germany/Germans seemed to enjoy the Snowden debacle.

Rest assured, having my data collected by the NSA wasn't worth it.

En fait non, c'est ce qui est fait depuis des années.

Pour les aménagements de peine, ils sont déjà au cœur de la politique pénale [depuis au moins 2009](http://www.humanite.fr/tribunes/l%E2%80%99amenagement-des-peines-fait-la-preuve-de-son-efficacite-497632). Tout simplement car c'est un moyen rapide et peu coûteux de faire de la place en prison. Bien sûr il n'y a aucune évaluation des conséquences ou des résultats de ce genre de politiques, sinon on pourrait voir que ça marche. Taubira est en fait dans la continuité de ce qui se faisait sous Sarkozy. 

Les peines sont aménagées ou ne sont carrément pas exécutées, et les prisons sont surpeuplées. Taubira bénéficie d'un faux procès fait à la droite et d'une idée préconçue que la gauche ferait naturellement plus de  prévention. D'ailleurs, si cela était si efficace, on aurait du voir tomber la récidive et la réitération, mais cela n'est absolument pas le cas.

Pour l'instant, on a juste montré que ceux qui bénéficient de peines aménagées et de libération conditionnelle sont moins souvent récidivistes. On oublie de préciser que s'ils sont remis en liberté et pas les autres, c'est qu'ils sont jugés moins dangereux ! La corrélation est donc tout à fait logique.

Sinon, il n'y a pas de lois d'exception, parce qu'il n'y a pas de loi tout court. Rien n'a changé. La ministre s'en tient à des [il faut, il faut, il faut](http://www.rue89lyon.fr/2013/10/24/alternatives-prison-taubira-enchainee-question-moyens/), sans donner les moyens pour changer de politique.

&gt;

&gt;__Hox genes__ (from an abbreviation of [homeobox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeobox)) are a group of related [genes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene) that control the body plan of the embryo along the anterior-posterior (head-tail) axis. After the embryonic segments have formed, the Hox proteins determine the type of [segment structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_(biology\)) (e.g. legs, antennae, and wings in fruit flies or the different types of vertebrae in humans) that will form on a given segment. Hox proteins thus confer segmental identity, but do not form the actual segments themselves  

&gt;Hox genes are defined as having the following properties:

&gt;


&gt;* their protein product is a transcription factor

&gt;* they contain a [DNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) sequence known as the [homeobox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeobox)

&gt;* in many animals, the organization of the Hox genes on the chromosome is the same as the order of their expression along the anterior-posterior axis of the developing animal, and are thus said to display colinearity.

Not that i'm disagreeing with you, but I don't think that would work.

Naturally, this would make governments unable to act in public interest, which is ridiculous. 

That kind of clause would only make sense when dealing with countries like China, who routinely use bullshit excuses to block western companies out of their markets or put them at a disadvantage (so that local competitors/clones can take their place).

There are plenty of reasons for such behavior and one of them is **money**, meaning they expect for Russia to *pay* for poor victims of occupation, oppression, yada yada, similar to Germany. Naturally Russia will never agree to any of this shit, so nothing will change in the next couple decades. 


Regarding the so called ""Russian launched agressive cyberattack on Estonia"". I am a part of Russian informational field and i remember RuNet being up in arms about the whole ordeal. Almost everyone was pissed at Estonians, people were really upset and wanted to take action/do something. Experts in Wiki article disagree with the notion of this being engineered and conducted by Russian special forces. I tend to agree with that and judging from *my personal experience* this was something i'd call a ""patriotic DDoS"", nothing more, nothing less.


 And lastly, this was no Lenin statue who no one gives a fuck about, but a memorial for WW2 soldiers, this is no joke for common Russian and if you for example would pee in a ""eternal fire"" in any Russian city, there is a decent chance that if get caught - first someone would break a couple of bones in your body and then you will get a criminal record (maybe even serve couple years in colony)

&gt;Du kennst mich doch überhaupt nicht. Also wie kannst du mich mit all jenen, die dem Kopp-Verlag blind glauben, in eine Schublade werfen?

&gt;Erkläre mir das mal bitte! Der Kopp-Verlag ist in meiner Aufzählung nur eine von vielen ""Quellen"", die ich heran ziehe, um wirklich aus jeder Richtung mögliche Szenarien beleuchtet zu bekommen. Das Ergebnis ist dann bei mir ein ""Ja, das könnte sein."" und nicht, wie von dir behauptet, ein ""Ja, das ist so!""

&gt;Ich habe die Weisheit nicht mit Löffeln gefressen, du auch nicht. Keiner von uns. Was an Informationen auf uns einprasselt ist derart viel, dass wir keine Wahl haben als zu filtern. Aus diesem eingeschränkten Sammelsurium an Informationen entsteht ein Weltbild. Dass deines anders aussieht als meines liegt dabei in der Natur der Sache. Ich kritisiere niemanden für seines, solange ich nicht der Ansicht bin, dass es bloß einseitig wiedergekäute Propaganda westlicher Medien ist (und dass es das ist, hat Herr Claus Kleber mit seinem ""Kurzinterview"" mit dem Siemens Chef Joe Kaeser ja eindeutig gezeigt).

&gt;Ich fordere doch nur eines: dass man sich ALLES anguckt, selbst nachdenkt und in der Welt und NICHTS als unmöglich einstuft. Du kannst mir nicht widersprechen, wenn ich sage, dass ich selbst nachdenke. Hätte ich das nicht getan, hätte ich das gleiche Weltbild wie jene, die der Presse unreflektiert glauben schenken: Putin wäre der böse, der Russe wollte die Weltherrschaft und die NATO wäre engelsgleich leuchtend die letzte Bastion der Freiheit. Du willst jetzt nicht behaupten, dass sie das ist, oder?

&gt;Etwas anderes fordert auch nicht Ken Jebsen: sich selbst ein Bild von der Welt zu machen. Selbst aktiv zu sein. Den eigenen Kopf zu benutzen. Ja, er zählt ""Verschwörungstheorien"" auf. Es geht ihm jedoch nicht darum, zu behaupten, dass sie der Wahrheit entsprechen, sondern darum, dass manche Dinge einfach zu hinterfragen (im Sinne von ""Fragen stellen"", nicht ""pauschal widersprechen"") sind. Was ist daran falsch? 

So, jetzt reden wir hier mal Klartext.


Deine mangelhafte Reflexion und mangelhaftes  Selber-Denken -trotz ständiger Propagierung- ist offensichtlich, da du den Kopp-Verlag noch nicht als Informationsquelle aus deinem input verbannt hast.

Ganz konkret wird es an deinem Russland-will-Ukraine-wegen-Öl-und-gas ersichtlich: Dass alle Länder in irgendeiner Form Öl und Gasfelder besitzen, die im Vergleich zu Russland/Saudi-Arabien aber nicht nennenswert sind, hast du in deiner Reflexion anscheinend nicht gestrahlt. Du hast auchnicht gestrahlt, dass Öl und Gas kein Anlass sein können, weil die Invasion wohl mehr kostet (sowohl Geld zur Mobilmachung als auch weltpolitischen Einfluss), als sie einen Vorteil durch Kontrolle der nicht nennenswerte ukrainischen Öl/Gasfelder abwirft.

Du bist ein Pavlovscher Hund, der jeden Knochen frisst, der ihm als alternative Quelle hingeschmissen wird. Das versuchst du dann durch radikalen Relativismus zu rechtfertigen. Nice try aber unsinnig.

Allgemein, wenn du ja -angeblich(haha)- über deine Quellen reflektierst wärst du bei rationaler Betrachtung auch schon vor langer Zeit auf den Trichter gekommen, dass Info Kopp ebenfalls einfach kranke Scheiße is:

* Artikel haben keine statistische Stützen, höchstens ominöse, in der Fachwelt abgelehnte Studien

* harter Propagandamüll

* braune Eso- und Verschwörungskacke

Wer in Blatt liest, in dem so eine blatante geistesgestörte Scheiße steht -und das noch verteidigt!-, der kann schon mal gar nicht _rational_ über seine Informationsbeschaffung nachdenken.

Unter dem Deckmantel der Medien- und Quellendiversität versuchst du Bullshitquellen, Irrationales, Propaganda und Lügen zu verteidigen.

Eine tatsächliche Diversität kommt ohne Medienkompetenz nicht aus und bei der versagst du ganz offensichtlich.

Deine radikale relativistische Weltansicht kann dich im Umfeld des Info-Kopp-Verlages auch nicht mehr rausreden.

Du bist -gelinde gesagt- ein Schwaller, der sich seine Desinformation durch zb Info-Kopp mit Meinungsdiversität schönreden will. Soll ich mal lachen? Nimmst du das eigentlich ernst was du da redest?

&gt;Hätte ich das nicht getan, hätte ich das gleiche Weltbild wie jene, die der Presse unreflektiert glauben schenken: Putin wäre der böse, der Russe wollte die Weltherrschaft und die NATO wäre engelsgleich leuchtend die letzte Bastion der Freiheit. Du willst jetzt nicht behaupten, dass sie das ist, oder?

Dein Bild von Medien in Form der Antithese *""westl. Medienpropaganda/Mainstreampropaganda -- Alternative Quelle/KenFM/Info-Kopp""*, spricht ebenfalls für meine Position:

Deine Antithese existiert nämlich gar nicht. 

Es gibt nur qualitativ hochwertige Informationen (in form von Artikeln, Nachrichten) und minderwertige Infos.

Wenn ich meine Infos aus den Blättern die du so schön zur westlichen Propaganda zuordnest (ZEIT, FAZ, TAZ, NZZ, DerFreitag, SZ) nehme, habe ich sowohl prowestliche, als auch prorussische, als auch relativistische Artikel. Das liegt daran, dass das was du als ""Mainstream"" bezeichnest gar kein Mainstream is, da er in sich selber in allerlei verschiedene politische, philosophische und argumentative Ansichten untergliedert ist. Allesamt tausend mal mehr glaubwürdiger und fundierter als alles was jemals von KenFM oder InfoKopp-Verlag gelabert wurde.

Diese Betrachtung zerstört natürlich die grundlegendste Prämisse deines (Welt)Bildes der Medien, aber damit musst du klarkommen:

Deine Antithese ist widerlegt und gleichzeitig bist du enttarnt.

Info Kopp und dergleichen ist nur zur Desinformation und minderwertiger Realsatire gut, aber nicht um sich ene differenzierte Meinung zu bilden mein Lieber.

Ich habe schon manche Info-Kopp-Artikel gelesen und **Selber drüber nachgedacht** und außer irrationaler und unfundierter Scheiße steht da nix drin. (Was für eine krasse Erkenntnis.) Da steht übrigens ebenfalls oft massive Propaganda drin. Nur die ""alternative Propaganda halt ;)


&gt;Ja, er zählt ""Verschwörungstheorien"" auf. Es geht ihm jedoch nicht darum, zu behaupten, dass sie der Wahrheit entsprechen, sondern darum, dass manche Dinge einfach zu hinterfragen (im Sinne von ""Fragen stellen"", nicht ""pauschal widersprechen"") sind.

Geil, er stellt dir unüberprüfbare -und  in der Konstruktion größtenteils massiv instabile- Gedankenkonstrukte hin, die du aus der Hand frisst, weil du ja schon in dem Moment ""selber nachdenkst"" in dem du dir den Gegenentwurf zu deinem projeziertem ""Westpropaganda""-Bild gibst.

Hättest du dir über die Sachen die da **postuliert** werden,  ein **eigenes**, **rationales** Bild gemacht, wären wir nicht da, wo wir jetzt sind.

Ich hinterfrage grundsätzlich alles. Aber ich würde nicht nach KenFM-Art hinterfragen, weil ich im Gegensatz zu KenFM eher ein Rationalist als ein radikaler Skeptiker/Irrationalist bin. ""Radikale Skeptik"" is eigentlich genauso gut wie Irrationalität, da man sich damit Wahrheiten negiert und nur noch mit Meinungen statt Argumenten (gibt ja keine Wahrheit) argumentiert. Gepaart mit Irrationalität -wie reduzierung politischer und gesellschaftlicher Prozesse auf Geopolitik- wird daraus eine gefährliche Mischung.

Es kommt natürlich immer auf den Einzelfall an, abe rgrundlegend kann man KenFm und Info-Kopp in diese Systematisierung verarbeiten.



So, und das wars jetzt. Ich erklär doch nicht irgendwelchen geistig unmündigen Personen auf reddit, dass man sich seine Nachrichten nicht auf info-kopp.de holt. 

Warum man sowas überhaupt ernsthaft ausdiskutieren muss -und wieso du das überhaupt versuchst- bleibt mir schleierhaft.

&gt;Selbstgefällig und arrogant: Wie sehr reflektieren Journalisten ihre Arbeit?

""Selbstgefällig"" und ""arrogant"" sind Synonyme, weshalb das an dieser Stelle eine unnötige Dopplung ist. Müller-Dofel spricht selbst an keiner Stelle von Arroganz. Außerdem: Wenn Journalisten selbstgefällig und arrogant sind, darf der Leser schon jetzt annehmen, dass das unter anderem mit sich bringt, dass sie ihre Arbeit nicht ausreichend reflektieren. Die Überschrift besteht also aus einer rhetorischen Frage mit vorweggenommener Antwort. Na, meinetwegen.

Dann folgt reichlich Copy&amp;Paste, dazwischen allerdings Füllsätze und Floskeln schönster Überflüssigkeit, die dazu meist auch noch sachlich falsch sind:

&gt; Müller-Dofel geht dabei vor allem auf die Studie „Trust in Professions“ ein, die belegt, dass die „Öffentlichkeit von Journalisten reichlich wenig hält“.

Von ""vor allem"" kann ja wohl nicht die Rede sein - die Studie ist lediglich der Aufhänger. Für die Einschätzung, dass ""die Öffentlichkeit"" von Journalisten wenig halte, bezieht er sich außerdem gar nicht auf diese Studie, sondern auf die ""Allensbacher Berufsprestigeskala"".

&gt; Und kritisiert ganz nebenbei einem erfahrenen Branchenkollegen mit deutlichen Worten.

Die Kritik nimmt den dritten von acht Absätzen ein, von Beiläufigkeit ist in dem kurzen Artikelchen ohnehin nichts zu spüren.

&gt; In seinem Beitrag fordert Mario Müller-Dofel fordert:

Kein Kommentar.

&gt;  Hat der erfahrene Journalist recht? Oder liegt er eigentlich falsch mit seiner Annahme und Journalisten reflektieren viel mehr, nur halt nicht in der Öffentlichkeit? 

Befindet sich der Kerpener immer noch in der Aufwachphase? Und könnte es vielleicht sein, dass es Müller-Dofel genau um eine öffentliche Reflexion geht und ihm Teeküchen- und Frühstückstischbesinnlichkeit - zu Recht - egal sind?

Und ich halte es für falsch -- und da habe ich durchaus auch Verständnis für die Kommentare der Aktion Mensch -- anderes zu behaupten. Menschen mit Behinderung sind charakterlich auch nicht anders als Menschen ohne Behinderung. Und genauso wie es Menschen ohne Behinderung gibt, die Arschlöcher sind weil sie Arschlöcher sein wollen, gibt es auch Menschen mit Behinderung, für die das gleiche gilt. 

Aber nehmen wir mal an, dass in diesem Fall die Tochter der Beklagten tatsächlich in keiner Weise anders kann. Bis zu welchem Grad müssen die Nachbarn dies dann ertragen? Wer würde es denn ganz ruhig ertragen, von einem Menschen mit Behinderung ordentlich verdroschen zu werden, weil der ja nichts dafür kann? Muss man das? Ich denke nicht. Und *starke und vor allem dauerhafte nächtliche Ruhestörung* ist nach kurzer Zeit aus gesundheitlicher Sicht auch nicht besser als tätlich angegriffen zu werden. Ich denke durchaus, dass eine Abwägung der Interessen hier nicht zwangsläufig in vollem Umfang zugunsten von Menschen mit geistiger Behinderung ausfallen muss.

In many ways it is harmed by it.

In what way is the UK outsourcing education by attracting foreign postgrads?  Further, a rather large percentage of people who come here to study eventually stay and work here.

Fiscal consolidation has generally attempted to spare social protection from spending cuts, but the distribution of adjustment costs between the young and old has been uneven; a growing generational divide is evident, disadvantaging the young. The efficiency of the social security systems of EU countries varies widely. Countries with greater inequality tended to have higher household borrowing prior to the crisis resulting in more subdued consumption growth during the crisis. The resulting high private debt, high unemployment, poverty and more limited access to education undermine long-term growth and social and political stability.

Io credo che la tua ripartizione dei costi sia buona, specialmente quel 20% di risparmio mensile.

In prospettiva futura, o tagli i costi (mi sembra che tu sia già al limite) o aumenti i ricavi ma mi sento di dire che quei 1000 euro sono un po’ pochini (circa 7 euro/ora, se non sbaglio). Nonostante io sia di Torino e Ceres l’abbia visitata qualche volta (mio nonno stava in un vecchiodromo locale) non ho idea delle potenzialità lavorative che questa ridente cittadina ti possa offrire in futuro ma ho qualche remora.

Indipendentemente da queste considerazioni, se non ci hai già pensato ti consiglio di usare quell’ottimo 20% di risparmi al mese per costituire il fondo disoccupazione: 3 mensilità a copertura dei costi immodificabili come affitto e acqualucegas (al netto dell’eventuale sussidio di disoccupazione), che al tuo regime di risparmio attuale ci metteresti sette mesi a costituire. Questi sono soldi che metti via e che ti dimentichi di avere fin quando ne avrai bisogno.

Una volta costituito il fondo disoccupazione, tocca la fondo risparmio, verso il quale giri quel 20% ogni mese a maturare interessi (come quando e perché è un discorso a parte). Se per i prossimi 45 anni metti via il 20% di quello che guadagni non diventerai ricchissimo ma non avrai certo problemi di sussistenza.

It's much harder for Russia to use Gazprom as a bargaining tool to bully for example the Czech Republic when you can simply reroute gas from LNG terminals in Poland or Croatia, North Africa, the Caucasus, Norway or even Russian gas that was meant for the German or Polish market.

Opposizione in dialogo sulle riforme: FI  
Opposizione dura e pura: Lega - FDI - SEL -M5S  

Partito Democratico - Renzi  
Centrosinistra, attualmente partito maggioritario nella coalizione di governo. 
Nato dalla fusione di due partiti che discendono rispettivamente dalla componente sociale della democrazia cristiana e dal partito comunista italiano. Attualmente diviso in decine di correnti interne in continua lotta tra loro (quella di Renzi ha conquistato la segreteria attraverso le elezioni primarie, ma in parlamento la maggioranza appartiene alle correnti più a sinistra, elette con il precedente segretario di estrazione PCI, Bersani). Legato al territorio attraverso le sezioni di partito, elegge il suo segretario e i parlamentari attraverso le votazioni primarie. Sta cercando di fare sua la richiesta popolare di rinnovamento e cambiamento, attraverso un progetto molto (forse troppo) ambizioso di riforma del sistema politico ed economico. L'arrivo di Renzi ha portato un allontanamento dall'area sindacale per avvicinarsi al mondo industriale, e soprattutto una forte virata verso la realpolitik.

Forza Italia - Berlusconi  
Centrodestra, rinato dopo l'esperienza del Popolo Delle Libertà che li aveva portati alla fusione con la destra di tradizione post-fascista. Completamente incentrato sulla figura leaderistica di Berlusconi, porta avanti idee liberiste mischiate però alla difesa di un certo corporativismo lobbista e ad una forte vena populista che cerca di guadagnare consenso facendo leva su alcuni dei *vizi* italiani (evasione fiscale, speculazione edilizie). Il suo cavallo di battaglia è sempre stato e sempre sarà: meno tasse. Ha stipulato un accordo con Renzi per votare le riforme della politica, ma Berlusconi è noto per ribaltare i tavoli appena pensa di trarne profitto elettorale. Al momento Berlusconi è condannato per corruzione e per diversi anni non potrà essere candidato, si sta vagliando la possibilità di dare il controllo del partito in mano ad un figlio. 

Nuovo Centro-Destra - Alfano  
Nato da una costola di FI, prova ad uscire dall'orbita di Berlusconi per dare vita un centrodestra più moderno. Alla base della rottura c'è il forte malcontento proveniente dalla destra europea e dal mondo cattolico, che dopo gli scandali sessuali ed il tracollo economico stanno cercando di distanziarsi dalla figura di Berlusconi. Attualmente al governo in coalizione col PD, il partito nasce dopo il tentativo di Berlusconi di far fallire la grossa-coalizione PDL-PD per evitare la sua decadenza dal senato. In caso di elezioni, tornerà nell'orbita di Berlusconi.

Lega Nord - Salvini  
Destra campanilista e federalista, combatte l'immigrazione e chiede di abolire la ridistribuzione delle entrate fiscali delle regioni (per semplificare, che i soldi del nord non vadano al sud). Al suo interno ha forti elementi xenofobi e indipendentisti, che si aggiungono ad una narrazione mitologica un po' stramba.  attualmente in crisi dopo molti scandali legati alla gestione finanziaria.  

Sinistra Ecologia Libertà - Vendola  
Partito che prova a riunire le varie esperienze della sinistra ecologista e post-comunista. è entrato in parlamento alleato al PD, a cui ora fa dura opposizione dopo che il risultato elettorale ha costretto quest'ultimo a coalizzarsi con il centrodestra. Fortemente critico delle politiche sul lavoro del governo Renzi; come tutta la sinistra più ancorata alla tradizione novecentesca soffre della sua incapacità di proporre un idea alternativa di futuro e limita la sua visione progressista all'ambito dei diritti civili. 

Scelta Civica - Monti  
Centro riformista, nato dopo l'esperienza di governo ""tecnico"" di Mario Monti, ha fallito miseramente nel suo tentativo di creare una realtà alternativa alla destra Berlusconiana. Sostiene il governo Renzi.

Il aurait, en creux, donné raison aux militants du jour de colère, aux Manif pour Tous, aux racistes de tous bords et de tous poils qui se sont permis, parce qu'elle est une femme et une femme noire, tous les excès.

J'avais déjà pas mal posté à l'époque dans ce subreddit pour contester l'ampleur d'un supposé racisme généralisé contre la Garde des Sceaux.

Qu'est-ce qu'on avait concrètement sous la main au moment de ""l'affaire Taubira"" ? 

- Une candidate FN aux municipales qui poste sur son compte Facebook une caricature de Taubira en guenon (ce qui lui vaudra son exclusion immédiate du FN).

- Une fillette de 12 ans qui balance une banane au passage de Taubira en la traitant de guenon (et qui a probablement reproduit bêtement les  injures de la candidate FN, par mimétisme de ce qu'elle a entendu dans les médias).

- Le journal *Minute* qui fait sa Une sur une Taubira ""maligne comme un singe"", et ne fait que surfer sur les deux situations précédentes pour vendre du papier. 

A partir d'un acte raciste d'une militante politique (je pense que le dérapage d'une gamine et la Une stupide d'un journal opportuniste restant fidèle à sa ligne éditoriale ne sont que les répliques sismiques du premier scandale) , on a fini par poser de manière largement disproportionnée la question d'une montée du racisme en France.

Et je n'ai pas jugé particulièrement pertinent tous ces éditos dans notre belle presse française, sur le mode ""La France est-elle raciste ?"".

Taubira avait auparavant joué le rôle de la championne du Mariage pour Tous. Puis elle est soudainement devenue une victime, et paradoxalement une victime héroïque. Cette posture de martyr s'est faite un peu contre sa volonté, mais elle a aussi largement instrumentalisé cette victimisation.

Cela me dérange un brin de voir la Garde des Sceaux portée aux nues pour ce qu'elle a subi plutôt que pour ce qu'elle a accompli. 

En ce qui concerne l'essentiel, c'est-à-dire la pertinence et l'efficacité de la politique qu'elle mène en matière de justice, je réserve mon jugement, n'ayant pas étudié à fond le dossier de la réforme pénale et autres restructurations de l'appareil judiciaire.

Dopo tangentopoli questi partiti sono stati sciolti e sono diventati:

- MSI --&gt; AN
- DC --&gt; Forza Italia / Margherita (""sinistra"") / Casini
- PCI --&gt; PDS / rifondazione / altri abbastanza scarsi 
- Lega nord (new entry!!1!!!)

Poi abbiamo nei 2000: 

- FI + AN + lega + casini --&gt; casa della libertà
- PDS --&gt; diventa DS che insieme alla Margherita --&gt; Ulivo
- Rifondazione

Poi nei 2010

- FI + AN --&gt; PdL

M5S: si propongono come alternativi alla politica tutta (sia gli elettori che i *politici* del M5S provengono dalle formazioni politiche più disparate)

Your wiki link merely states under ""criticism"" that:

&gt; In December 2013, a coalition of over 200 environmentalists, labor unions and consumer advocacy organizations on both sides of the Atlantic sent a letter to the USTR and European Commission demanding the investor-state dispute settlement be dropped from the trade talks, claiming that ""Investor-state dispute settlement is a one-way street by which corporations can challenge government policies, but neither governments nor individuals are granted any comparable rights to hold corporations accountable.""

However, the European Commission's own consultation document notes that ""The possibility for investors to resort to ISDS is a standard feature of virtually all the 3000 investment agreements in existence today, including the 1400 signed by EU Member States."" Indeed, the very link I provided upthread shows how ISDS is already in use in disputes between disputes between investors (including individuals and other governments, like that of Abu Dhabi, not just corporations) and at least some EU member states such as Spain.

To pretend that individuals, never mind governments, don't have comparable means to hold corporations accountable is also quite a disputable assertion.

But I wonder what has suddenly motivated that ""coalition of over 200 environmentalists, labor unions and consumer advocacy organizations"" to suddenly wake up about ISDS in the context of TAFTA, when they had ignored it in those other 3000 investment agreements in existence today.

The ""stable, English speaking country with rather liberal economic laws"" part is there whether or not we are in the EU. 

The ""gateway to Europe"" point somewhat depends on what happens to the UK after Brexit, whether we stay in the single market or not. There are costs and benefits. Outside the EU the UK can liberalise its laws further, without EU gold-plating.

There is a risk for the EU that if the UK can prosper outside the EU (as of course Norway and Switzerland do) then the EU will lose one of its main purposes. However, I don't think that the UK should be afraid to negotiate here. A lot of Europe (especially Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Denmark) would not want to decrease trade with the UK.

I agree though these countries cannot by themselves establish a deal like the one you speak of. There are several other countries which would benefit less from it and which are enough to establish a blocking minority, maybe even a simple majority.

true,Nihy,ASTR,Austria,"Before another idiot claims this isn't about giving corporations more power, here is an excerpt from a critique:

&gt; ISDS grants foreign corporations the right to go before private trade tribunals and directly challenge government policies and actions that corporations allege reduce the value of their investments. Even if a new policy applies equally to domestic and foreign investors, ISDS allows foreign corporations to demand compensation for the absence of a ""predictable regulatory environment"".

&gt; In recent years, the use of ISDS to challenge a diverse array of government policies has expanded dramatically. Inclusion of ISDS in free trade agreements and bilateral investment treaties has allowed corporations to file over 500 cases against 95 governments. Many of these cases directly attack public interest and environmental policies. For the following reasons, we strongly urge you to exclude ISDS from TTIP: 

&gt; ISDS forces governments to use taxpayer funds to compensate corporations for public health, environmental, labor and other public interest policies and government actions: ISDS has been used to attack clean energy, mining, land use, health, labor, and other public interest policies. In fact, of the more than $14 billion in the 16
claims now pending under just U.S. free trade agreements, all relate to environmental, energy, financial regulation, public health, land use and transportation policies –
not traditional trade issues. 

&gt; Increasingly, corporations are using ISDS to challenge non-discriminatory government measures. For example, EU investors have attacked Egypt’s minimum-wage increase,and a U.S. corporation has attacked the Peruvian government’s decision to regulate toxic waste and close a dangerously polluting smelter under deals with ISDS. In one of the most notorious cases, U.S. tobacco giant Philip Morris launched investor-state cases challenging anti-smoking laws in Uruguay and Australia after failing to undermine the health laws in domestic courts. Particularly because of the significant number of cross - registered companies in the U nited States and the EU, the number of ISDS attack s on public interest policies would likely increase dramatically if TTIP includes ISDS. Governments must have the flexibility to put in place public interest policies without fear of trade litigation launched by corporations.

Let the countries that contributed most (through the centuries) to the pollution foot the bill. Or those that benefited the most from their industries (although that might be hard to calculate). Let's provide green energy for Poland for the transision period. Subsidise the green energy, so it's not strangling Poland's economy. These are only ideas from the top of my head, maybe it's possible to find an other solution to make that fair. And I'm not even sure if Poland would have been a huge beneficiary of such a program -- after all, Poland was not and is not some kind of industrial wasteland -- it's possible that Poland would have to pay for some mitigation, too. But Poles surely don't want to help you* carry the burden they did not benefit from. And if it falls, we're not the ones who'll be getting hit the most.

Building new reactors is proving to be difficult because of strict security regulations and high wages in the construction sector.
Estimated build time of Olkiluoto 3 has been upped to 15 years from originally 4. Flamanville 3 has similar problem.

The UK was only able to attract the building of a new reactor by offering £92.50/MWh (0.11161 euro cents per kilowatt-hour) which will increase according to the inflation. As a comparison, the guaranteed prices for photovoltaics in Germany ranges between 9.19 and 13.28 Cent/kWh depending on size. For wind power it's 5.02 Cent/kWh on-shore and 2,5 Cent/kWh off-shore.

A big ""I told you so"", but the conservativs don't matter to much here, the centre and even some left leaning voters are the target.

 It fits perfectly with the narrativ of Merkel as our ""mother"" - the CDU/CSU want to show that like parents in the end they are way more right then wrong and want to isolate the greens (and the linke in terms of Russia btw). This way they can divide the centre/left and the left in a smoth and uncomplicated way. As long as the FDP is not the in the Bundestag they need at least one party to form a coalition with or being that big to govern alone. 

For both options a devided left is absolutely essential and as long die Linke is against the Nato (with the background we have today) that won't happen, but it does not damage your brand, if you can make little fires below the other two parties so you might get internal fights (esp the greens here). 

So in the final picture the CDU/CSU wants to draw they are the ones that were right all along and united, while the left (could) look like a bunch of wranglers that fight against each other.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt; local governments expect that the US will defend them against its enemies(the government's enemies not the country's) to protect US interests.

I would say the most notable example of this is Pakistan. But the US has not stepped in during its conflicts with India. And the US supports Pakistan with billions in aid per year. Just because a country gets US military aid or weapons does not mean the US will protect them. The only way I could see the US intervening in Pakistan would be if their nuclear arsenal was at risk. 

&gt;not protecting ""the free world"" against an authoritarian aggression would be crushing to the US's moral standing

Even if all of the things you say are true, it does not counter the fact that the Baltics are not an asset for NATO, but a liability. Not to mention they take almost zero responsibility for their own defense, transfering the vast majority to the US. I dont think its a moral issue anymore. The US has remained in NATO despite its European ""partners"" slashing their budgets for decades. Its not exactly a partnership when 3 parties do all the work and absorb all the expense, and 25 do nothing. 

&gt;the western world let the US abuse it's position quite oftet under the understanding that if the worst scenario happens the US would intervene.

You have to look at the geopolitics through a relative lens. The notion that the US is the only country going around intervening in other countries' affairs is absurd. France and Germany built Saddam's factories he used to make chemical weapons, then continued supply shipments even after serious questions were raised. The US often gets blamed for a coup in Haiti. It supported it, but most of the planning was France and Canada. 

There are countless examples of these types of interventions. Especially in old European colonies, you will often see European nations  getting their hands dirty. The notion that the US is the one committing all the abuses, while European nations look the other way is a bit of a stretch. They dont really have the moral authority to speak unless they want to look like hypocrites. NSA revelations are a perfect example of this. European nations were ""outraged"" until it came to light virtually every Western European nation has one of their own similar, or even more intrusive, programs. So I am not sure the Western world let the US abuse its position, they abuse theirs as well. US abuses just tend to be far more publicized. 

&gt;NATO is just a remnant of the cold war,(and provious self defence alliances, the model is at least 200 years old, and it borught us both world wars) it is pointless, 

Im a little confused. You are advocating the US respond militarily to an aggressor that attacks Europe, but you think the vehicle that ensures that will happen is useless? Without NATO I would say the US has no moral obligation to protect any member countries. The UK and France would be at the top of the list due to military cooperation, but the Baltics would certainly not be entitled to a US response. It would be akin to what Russia just did in Ukraine. The US does not have much military cooperation with Ukraine and it is not a major trade partner. It also must be said Ukraine takes its own defense much more seriously than the Baltics (in spending as a % of GDP terms). Without NATO they would essentially be rolling out a red carpet for Russia given their lack of defense capability.

Without NATO an attack on the Baltics would be an EU issue. I dont see any reason why the US would have a moral obligation to protect them. This is especially true considering the US did not militarily intervene in Ukraine, and Ukraine spends far more on defense than Baltic states. Unless you believe without NATO the US should still defend EU territorial integrity as opposed to just its national partners. I dont see why the US should be forced to abide by the EU's common defense clause given it is not a member.

That's a misconception. You can't have an effective Communist revolution in a pre-industrial society. There are no means of production for the proletariat to seize, which in a big way defeats the purpose of a Communist revolution. Trying to industrialize after the fact doesn't fix that problem. You can't build a house with no foundation.

And just to add, Stalin was the devil incarnate.

Alle in meiner Familie sind aus Deutschland, und ich habe 2 Jahre in Bayern gewohnt... Aber jetzt in den USA wird mein Deutsch ein bisschen schlechter. Gibt es einen Podcast der 15-20 Minuten pro Tag geht und den man gut im Auto hören kann? Ideen?

1. Satz:
Familie ist Subjekt, also großgeschrieben.
Jahre ist auch Subjekt.
""aus Deutschland"", Angaben von Herkunft immer mit ""aus""
""ist"", Familie ist im deutschen Singular

2. Satz:
""den"", da USA für United States of America steht und damit Plural ist
""bisschen"", die neue Rechtschreibung hat versucht das ""ß"" zu reduzieren

3. Satz:
""einen"", da Podcast im Deutschen maskulin ist
""der"", da sich das auf den Podcast bezieht
""geht"", nicht falsch aber auch nicht richtig, naja...

Der letzte Teil des Satzes ist grammatikalisch nicht sonderlich schön, ich bin mir aber auch nicht sicher wie man das ganze grammatikalisch richtig schreiben würde, von daher habe ich dir ein Beispiel oben angegeben, das dir helfen könnte.

Criticism from Europe regarding the US is fairly constant. It is almost always forthcoming, and manifests itself in many ways, and in many different areas (economic policies, environmental policies, foreign policies, trade policies etc...). During these times, European criticism seems to be solely aimed at the US, and gives Americans the impression that the US is your number #1 enemy. Europeans simply criticize few to no countries as much as it criticizes Americans. (It doesn't help that Europeans are constantly calling Americans backwards, uncivilized, ignorant, uncultured etc... when these same words are rarely applied to other nations/people).

The praise coming from Europe regarding the US typically comes when there are issues in Europe (i.e. geopolitical rumblings on the continent). All of the sudden the criticism ebbs and the praise flows. It is no surprise then that some Americans view Europeans as self-centered, and duplicitous.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; If you take a position similar to Switzerland or Norway you would be forced to enact the relevant EU regulations without having any say in their creation. How can such a situation be more favourable than your current one?

Currently the UK, as one Member State among 27, only has a small voice in the creation of legislation and the framing of rules. Even at the moment the UK is forced to enact legislation in cases where it disagrees on that legislation. The difference between 1/27 and 0/26 is a small difference. Outside the EU the UK can also avoid other parts of the EU like justice, CAP, fisheries and so forth. 

&gt; The money currently situated in the UK - that comes from european institutions - would just flood to Frankfurt within months of the UK exiting, crippling your most important economic sector. 

Money situated in the UK doesn't come from EU institutions though? It comes because the UK is a global financial centre and in many respects THE global financial centre. Frankfurt really isn't London's peer. London's peers are New York and latterly Singapore. Frankfurt is in an entirely different league.

&gt; The alternativ would be agreeing to a trade deal that will be very unfavourable for the UK and heavyly skewed to the EU, since your barganing power is so low.

I realise that there are some Europeans that don't like the idea of the UK prospering outside the EU. However, I don't think the deal would be so bad.

Agreed. Though I think my point still stands that the difference between the UK's potential influence from within the EU and the UK's influence from outside the EU is not as gigantic as all that.

&gt; It simply chooses to be weaker, for example by electing MEPs who won't even show up when things important to the UK are decided, among other things (all from @britinfluence).

Most of the items listed in your link, FTT, bankers bonuses, whether there should be a single seat for the European Parliament cannot be controlled by the UK whatever the UK does.

As a UKIP voter, I don't think of myself as voting for people to represent the UK in Europe. I am voting for people to try and push the UK towards the exit. 

Though, truth be known, I came very close to trying to be selected by UKIP for this May's European Elections and personally, were I an MEP, I would attend every vote going. (In the end for professional reasons I decided not to put my name forward).

No, it's utter nonsense. No seat, no vote, not even observers or other employees to give a British perspective – that *is* a gigantic difference. And that doesn't even include the informal influence that develops through personal connections of representatives and officials. Nah, by your reasoning, Scotland might as well leave the UK since it has barely any influence anyway. Actually, any small part of any bigger place should do that.

Regardless, I find working or voting for a party that knowingly exacerbates the very issues it decries very dubious, to say the least. Then again, we already established that they, well, or you, first create the conclusion and then fabricate arguments, not the other way around.

Actually it's one sub of six, for which Germany pays 1/3 of the price.

If he has an insurance (like card drivers are required to), then the ""victim"" will have his insurance contact the biker's insurance, and they will come to an agreement among them. This is the easiest way for both.

If the biker has no insurance, which seems to be the case, then he is directly responsible. Then he can take 2 ways: be a gent or be an asshole. 

A gent will offer repairs to be agreed upon. Have the driver get a quote on the cost of reparing the damages. Get your own quote. Compare, negotiate and agree. Once agreed, have the car driver sign a paper stating he is receiving whatever amount as repairs and won't claim for more. 

If either one is not ready to negotiate, the driver will have to sue the biker for damages. In this case, he needs to prove the value of the damages and the biker being the cause. Going to court will be expensive for the driver and a little less so for the biker, and will take time and be a pain in the ass. If the driver's lawyer knows his way and gets everything he is claiming for (that is, he does not overclaim), the biker will end up paying the fees of both lawyers and will end up worse off on the long run.

And that doesn't even include the informal influence that develops through personal connections of representatives and officials.

I'm not talking just about influence in the EU (as this is not the only relevant consideration) I am talking about influence everywhere, in the UK, in Europe and across the whole globe. What is the difference between that total influence that we have as a member of the EU and that total influence we have not being a member of the EU? That's the relevant question.

&gt;  Nah, by your reasoning, Scotland might as well leave the UK since it has barely any influence anyway. Actually, any small part of any bigger place should do that.

And arguably Scotland might as well leave the UK, I agree. This is certainly an important discussion and there are aguments for and against and it pleases me that Scotland are making this choice. Certainly peoples should be able to decide their own destiny and this is why I hope the UK gets to decide on whether to stay in the EU.

&gt; Regardless, I find working or voting for a party that knowingly exacerbates the very issues it decries very dubious, to say the least.

Obviously there is no perfect political party and we all have to make compromises at the ballot box and find ourselves voting for the ""least worse"" option! But in simplistic terms UKIP have a political objective to leave the EU and they represent people that want that political objective and they are open about this. To do things that support this objective does not really strike me as dubious. It strikes me as representative democracy. 

&gt; Since this, by all means, not reasoning, I guess the saying is right, ""You can't reason a person out of a position they didn't reason themselves into.""

- Obviously even someone like me recognises that there are both costs and benefits to being in the EU. 
- In my view the costs are greater than the benefits. 
- Your counter-argument is that it is partly my fault that costs are high and the benefits are low.
- My counter-counter argument is that even if I did everything in my power to increase benefits and decrease costs, the costs would still outweight the benefits. So, therefore, the only rational option is to leave the EU. And if in order to achieve that, in the interim the costs increase still further, that is unfortunate but necessary collateral.

Because they are relatively insignificant makes them not really worth anything to Russia(no offence). Even if they would spend 100% of their gdp they still couldn't put up a fight, it really isn't about budged. Its european partners reduce spending because that is what normal contries do in times of peace. The US however invents new wars just to justify it's dominance. It's not exactly a partnership if your most important ally gets into more wars in the last 10 years than you had in the last 60. Again, France doesn't need protection from the american military. NATO has not been called on in french conflicts except maybe Lybia, but from what I understand the former european companies have been replaced with american ones by the new regime, so I don't find even that conflict abigous about its fortunate externalities.

But the US is the only one that decides who is the ""enemy of the free world"" and has the audacity to call modern crusades against them.

More intrusive, no sorry, they don't have the money for that. And I was never under the illusion that when it comes to inteligence abuses the US was alone, but as a antistatist, my opinions are invalid until they become headlines.

US abuse tends to be less tactfull, they are in a position where nobody oposes them so when they want something they get it. Kinda like Russia, but they do it in the name of democracy, not homophobia.

I was just presenting my analysis. In my opinion any foreign military intervention sould be banned or done only under the flag of the UN. 

Under that reasoning why did the US react to Crimea? treaties are worthless in world with 24 ~~propaganda~~ news media.

The same reasoning they have to protect Ukraine would aply to the baltics the rest is diplomatic bullshit. History is not made out of paper, but because men with power wish it so.

The US recently made a small release of its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (5 million bbls) to remind Russia it is sitting on 700 million barrels of oil. For a balanced budget Russia needs oil at $120 per bbl. Its far below that and the US could drive the price down further, adding a further economic blow to sanctions.

Then there is the fact that the Ruble is a trash currency. Energy reserves are not nimble enough to influence currency fluctuations in the short term. That is where foreign reserves come in. Russia spent $16 billion worth of their dollar reserves defending the Ruble directly after the Crimea invasion. Those who claim Russia has enough foreign reserves to last years forget most Russians' wealth is not held in Dollars. They would have to spend their dollars to prop up the Ruble. And manipulating currency pairs can be *very* expensive.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"The US got zero oil contracts in Iraq in initial bidding, now I believe Exxon has one. China was by far the largest benefactor, with Europe close behind. 

Before Iraq and Afghanistan, the US defense budget was at a reasonable 3%. It is again on a downward trajectory and it is estimated to be at 2.9% after Obama leaves office. But given the size of the US economy that is still a large figure. The US could cut it further if it was not making such a large commitment to NATO.

My point exactly was France and the UK dont really need US help to defend themselves (protecting their oil interests is a clearly a different issue). That being said, I can see the moral liability for the US to intervene in France and the UK. They have met all the requirements of NATO membership. If anything did happen, I would say the US had a moral obligation to intervene. Out East, Poland is the obvious example of another country where the US might have a moral obligation. But most of the rest of Europe, not really. 

The UK's program stores every byte of data that flows through their country (which is not limited to UK users). Even Snowden called it more intrusive. 

&gt;In my opinion any foreign military intervention sould be banned or done only under the flag of the UN.

To a certain extend that is what we have today. NATO needs ""legal authority"" which is essentially given only by a UN mandate. What many people tend to forget is Saddam taunted the West and kicked out inspectors. Granted more intelligence should have been gathered before intervening. That said, the UN was the organization raising most of the concerns given its restrictions regarding inspections. 

&gt;Under that reasoning why did the US react to Crimea?

I am not sure I understand the question. The US reacted but not militarily, and a military option does not seem to be on the table. The US will advocate its interests even if it does no have a military treaty. So will the EU and all of its members, as is also evidenced by Crimea. 

&gt;the expectancy that the US will fix shit is the primary cause we do not have a military treaty and a cleared diplomatic balance with russia.

The position of the US Department of Defense is that an EU integrated military force would be best for everyone. But I agree, support in Europe is counter to that ever happening. There has been steady troop withdrawal since the end of the cold war. Further withdrawals will help this along. 

But the lack of diplomatic balance with Russia is not the US' fault. The US was in free trade talks with Russia up until Crimea. The EU was also in talks to liberalize trade with Russia before Crimea. I think it is short sighted to blame the lack of partnership with the EU/Russia on the US. Given the US was in free trade talks, Russia is clearly not the boogyman to the US it once was. Although Putin is doing his best to change that. 

If the EU reacts negatively to Russia's actions it is hard to blame that on the US as well. Its obvious why the EU would be averse to land grabs by Russia in the EU's backyard. ",0,1396461672,null,0,false,0,cgib7fd,t3_21x9fg,t1_cgib7fd,t1_cgi9zml,null,1433179230,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I also agree that corporations **to a certain clear and rather limited extent** should be able to sue governments if said governments actions hurt a corporation in what may be for example a conflict of interest. 

May I present you an example:

*The Wallonian government posses a big majority share in FN Hersalt thus owning it. A well known arms manufacturer. Consider how an other arms manufacturer may be located in this country and the goverment decides to limit the sales of arms to a government it or its allies has disputes with or which takes unethical actions. It however makes those sale-bans rather selective so that it's own arms sale doesn't get hampered much, thus providing it's company with a substantial advantage or even a monopoly thus the concurrence incurs a big and rather unfair loss.*

In this situation it would be fair to compensate the concurrence or adjust the ban accordingly if a judge deems that's the way it should be.

Now I took a sector that isn't subject to much compassion but the same could happen to non gov affiliated insurances, banks or green tech companies.

*Let's say the Norwegian gov gets into a crisis, goes full loco and hampers the renewable energy industry simply to run a bigger profit on its oil and gas sales.*

Now this is all purely hypothetical but you get the picture.

In his example of Spain the government promised large the continuation of large subsidies to the renewable energy industry. We're talking about tons of money and investment agreements to corporations here either directly or indirectly. Said industries invested and recruited people accordingly but bumped into an unpleasant surprise as the government broke its promise when faced with budget problems and holes at the inception of the crisis. A number of said green companies went bankrupt, jobs were lost, industry was harmed due to governmental mismanagement.

Now this all applies to our companies but I'm guessing it also does to foreign ones as internationals are not a rare thing. 

* Should it not?
* Where's the line to which governments can push conflicts of interest, mismanagement or maybe even corruption?
* And on the counterside where's the one that stops companies from doing this in a way that actually harms public interests and not the governments.

 That's what this discussion should be about imo. Either that or why these companies are able to sue already anyway if that's something you strongly oppose.

As far as I'm concerned these laws are not bad if they're clear, detailed and restrictive. ",0,1396464311,null,0,1396513721,0,cgicjk6,t3_21zvjy,t1_cgicjk6,t1_cgi351i,null,1433179860,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Der harte Umgang entspringt eigentlich einem völlig anderen Motiv:

Es schmerzt mich anzusehen, wie Menschen -die offensichtlich genügend geistiges Potential besitzen- ihr Potential so an die Wand fahren wie zb du es tust und trotz aller potentiellen geistigen Mündigkeit ihrer Naivität erliegen.

Es schmerzt mich umso mehr, da ich in den Genuss kam, das in ähnlicher Weise selber zu erleben, nur zur Info.

Die harte Angang ist der -hoffentlich fruchtende- Versuch dich mit aller Gewalt wachzurütteln.

Im Ernst: Du kannst nicht so naiv sein und Info-Kopp lesen und dann ne relativistische Denke über den philosophischen Begriff Wahrheit ziehen. Das is echt lächerlich. Denk später mal nochmal in aller Ruhe über die Sache nach, Ich erwarte auch von niemand seine Meinung mitten in der Diskussion zu switchen, weil das rein psychologisch so gut wie nie geht. In der Retroperspektive wird dir vielleicht einiges klar, und wenn es Wochen, Monate oder Jahre dauert.


Ich habe auch keine unbegründeten persönlichen Beleidigungen ausgesprochen, ich denke dich trifft eher meine radikale Argumentation und Rückschlüsse zu deiner Person. Es ist radikal, ohne Frage, aber dennoch nicht ausfallend. Rhetorisch hart, aber bei weitem nicht vulgär und antisozial.

&gt;Gehst du mit jedem so um, der nicht deiner Meinung ist? 

Noch einen Tipp:

Es gibt noch sehr viel -allgemein- radikalere Argumentatoren und insgesamt auch viele Polemiker (wogegen Diskussion seeehr unangenehm sein können/sind). Du musst dir erstens überlegen wie du dagegen ankommst und zweitens wie du damit klarkommst.

Denn wenn du eben mal nicht argumentativ/rhetorisch ankommst oder dich in etwas verrennst -wie ich dir das in dieser Diskussion bescheinige-, dann kann das bei harter Argumentation natürlich sehr unangenehm werden. Das ist mir früher auch passiert und daraus muss man lernen, man kann sich nur durch umfangreiche Diskusssionen argumentativ und intelektuell verbessern, weil dort immer das eigene Weltbild nach Quantität und Qualität getestet wird.

**Wichtig:** Bei aller argumentativen Härte und argumentativ persönlichem Angang musst du dir im Klaren darüber sein, dass es eben *nur* eine Diskussion ist.

Es mag Themen geben, da sind wir uns vielleicht einig und vielleicht könnten wir beide rein zwischenmenschlich klarkommen, du musst aber auch verstehen, dass das hier kein Ponyhof ist. Die Diskussionen sind hier oft relativ ruhig, aber auch hier in /de gehts manchmal härter einher.

Die Familie Müller macht im Jahr 10 Tonnen Müll; die Familie Meier 4 Tonnen. Nicht irgendeinen Müll, sondern Müll von der exakt gleichen Art - Plastik beispielsweise.

Nun könnte man behaupten, die Familie Müller ist schmutziger. Es ist für den Wahrheitsgehalt dieser Behauptung unerheblich, ob die Familie aus drei oder acht Personen besteht - die Einheiten sind Müll in Tonnen und Familie. 

In der zitierten Statistik sind die Einheiten CO2 in Tonnen und Kraftwerke.

Die größten Unklarheiten schafft vermutlich das Wort *schmutzig*, denn jeder versteht etwas Anderes darunter. Ein Blick in den Artikel offenbart aber, dass der Autor unter *schmutzig* nur den CO2 Ausstoß der Kraftwerke versteht; und er schließt sich damit dem Zeitgeist an, denn die Welt sorgt sich offenbar nur noch um die CO2-Werte. Andere Dinge wie Schwefel, CO oder Rußpartikel flossen nicht in die Präsentation der Untersuchung mit ein.

Statistiken sind immer subjektiv; und genau das sind auch Artikel, die von Journalisten verfasst werden. Ein anderer hätte seinen Artikel mit ""Polen haben größte Drecksschleuder"" überschreiben können; falsch wäre das auch nicht.

Wenn die deutschen Kraftwerke kleiner gebaut werden, erscheinen sie natürlich nicht mehr unter den ersten 5, 10 oder zwanzig - auch der Umfang dieses Rankings wird beliebig gewählt.

Bildet man dann aber die Summe aller deutschen Kraftwerke und ihres Ausstosses, erhält man wieder einen möglichen Vergleichswert. Und diese Summe wäre besser geeignet die Situation zu beschreiben, anstatt einzelne Anlagen rauszupicken.

Plakativer aber, und das hängt wieder mit der Subjektivität des Journalismus zusammen, ist es, den hochtrabenden Deutschen, die von erneuerbaren Energien träumen und sich alle für die Vorhut des Umweltschutzes halten, anhand der größten CO2-Schleudern aufzuzeigen, wie es um die vermeintliche grüne Revolution im eigenen Land bestellt ist.

I have another interpretation though, and it has nothing to do with any of this. This party lost a lot of sympathizers recently because they are essentially in coalition with the ex-communists and the Turkish minority party (their arch enemy in a way). They need to make some headlines and grab some votes. Usually, the pro-Russia party would be the ex-communists, but now their leader is also the leader of PES and they have to keep a pro-Europe position. So this opens up a vacuum for a pro-Russian party and Ataka have seized the chance to be one. This is all there is to it, IMHO.

true,SeveQStorm,HAMB,Hamburg,"&gt; Der harte Umgang entspringt eigentlich einem völlig anderen Motiv:

&gt; Es schmerzt mich anzusehen, wie Menschen -die offensichtlich genügend geistiges Potential besitzen- ihr Potential so an die Wand fahren wie zb du es tust und trotz aller potentiellen geistigen Mündigkeit ihrer Naivität erliegen.

&gt; Es schmerzt mich umso mehr, da ich in den Genuss kam, das in ähnlicher Weise selber zu erleben, nur zur Info.

&gt; Die harte Angang ist der -hoffentlich fruchtende- Versuch dich mit aller Gewalt wachzurütteln.

Das kommt darauf an, was man als ""wach"" betrachtet. Aber gut, unterschiedliche Weltbilder. Gewalt hilft bei mir normal nicht - da werde ich eher trotzig. Gute Argumente hingegen schon. Wie in meinem Edit geschrieben: Kopp ist nicht die beste Quelle, als solche sogar vollkommen inakzeptabel. Zugegeben. An der Stelle bin ich überzeugt. An der Stelle hast du mich wachgerüttelt. Danke. 

Bezüglich KenFM bin ich allerdings noch nicht überzeugt und ich möchte dich bitten, wenn es dir möglich ist, dies ohne Gewalt zu versuchen. 

&gt; Ich habe auch keine unbegründeten persönlichen Beleidigungen ausgesprochen, ich denke dich trifft eher meine radikale Argumentation und Rückschlüsse zu deiner Person. Es ist radikal, ohne Frage, aber dennoch nicht ausfallend. Rhetorisch hart, aber bei weitem nicht vulgär und antisozial.

Da muss ich dir widersprechen. Es ist einfach nicht möglich, aus den paar Worten, die wir hier gewechselt haben, wahrheitsgetreue Rückschlüsse auf meine (oder deine) Person zu ziehen. Ich bin in der Tat nicht so naiv, Kopp zu glauben. Aber ich bin auch nicht so naiv, das Gegenteil dessen zu glauben, was Kopp behauptet. 

Wie gesagt: ich bin Agnostiker, halte nichts für unmöglich. Naja, so abgehobenen Kram wie den von David Icke vielleicht. Aber ich halte nichts für nicht denkbar, was Menschenhand möglich ist. Die Vergangenheit hat oft genug gezeigt (bspw. NSA-Affäre, Lügen über Massenvernichtungswaffen im Irak), dass es Dinge zwischen uns und ""denen da oben"" gibt, die nicht dem Narrativ der Wahrheit entsprechen. 

Aber ich verabscheue Gewalt. In jeder Form. Auch verbal. Das muss auch auf anderer Ebene gehen und davon lasse ich mich eher überzeugen. 

&gt; Es gibt noch sehr viel -allgemein- radikalere Argumentatoren und insgesamt auch viele Polemiker (wogegen Diskussion seeehr unangenehm sein können/sind). Du musst dir erstens überlegen wie du dagegen ankommst und zweitens wie du damit klarkommst.

Mag sein. Mit denen unterhalte ich mich dann gar nicht mehr. Insofern bist du mit deinem Versuch, mich mit Gewalt wachzurütteln tatsächlich noch nicht in der Schublade ganz unten angekommen, warst aber auf dem besten Wege dahin. Dein letzter Post hat das wieder ein wenig relativiert. Ich hoffe, wir treffen uns irgendwo auf einem für beide Seiten akzeptablen Niveau. Ich würde mich freuen.

&gt; Denn wenn du eben mal nicht argumentativ/rhetorisch ankommst oder dich in etwas verrennst -wie ich dir das in dieser Diskussion bescheinige-, dann kann das bei harter Argumentation natürlich sehr unangenehm werden. Das ist mir früher auch passiert und daraus muss man lernen, man kann sich nur durch umfangreiche Diskusssionen argumentativ und intelektuell verbessern, weil dort immer das eigene Weltbild nach Quantität und Qualität getestet wird.

Ja. Hab mich verrannt. Tut mir leid. Mir fällt es manchmal auch etwas schwer, zu argumentieren, ohne selbst polemisch zu wirken. Kommt immer darauf an, wem ich gegenüber stehe.

&gt; Wichtig: Bei aller argumentativen Härte und argumentativ persönlichem Angang musst du dir im Klaren darüber sein, dass es eben nur eine Diskussion ist.

Damit habe ich ein Problem. Denn eine Diskussion ist meiner Meinung nach frei von verbaler Gewalt und ""fallacies"". Alles andere ist ein Streitgespräch. Letzteres muss ich nicht haben. Ich gebe zu, ich habe mich auch zu ""fallacies"" verstiegen und wiederhole meine Entschuldigung dafür. 

&gt; Es mag Themen geben, da sind wir uns vielleicht einig und vielleicht könnten wir beide rein zwischenmenschlich klarkommen, 

Bestimmt. Ich kann durchaus freundlich und liebenswert sein. :-)

&gt; du musst aber auch verstehen, dass das hier kein Ponyhof ist. Die Diskussionen sind hier oft relativ ruhig, aber auch hier in /de gehts manchmal härter einher. 

Muss das denn sein? Sind sachliche Diskussionen nicht effektiver als emotional aufgeladene Streitgespräche? 

&gt; Insofern brauchst du dich gar nicht angegriffen zu fühlen, auch wenn ich das psychologisch verstehen kann, da der Diskussionsgegenstand ja dein Weltbild ist.

Das hast du falsch interpretiert. Ich fühle mich nicht angegriffen, **weil** du mein Weltbild in Frage stellst, sondern auf Grund der Art und Weise. Ich habe kein Problem damit, wenn jemand mein Weltbild in Frage stellt. Absolut nicht. Gute Argumente finde ich klasse. Natürlich verteidige ich meine Meinung, so gut ich es zu dem Zeitpunkt gerade kann. Das muss man mir zugestehen. Aber mich deshalb als geistesgestört hinzustellen, ist nicht fair. Ja, das Leben ist nicht fair. Ich weiß...

What comitment? All of NATO's activity is decided by the US. They could easaly cut in half their military budget and still be the most powerfull military alliance on earth. Sorry but this is political bullshit. NATO is not stoping the spending cuts, it is just a scapegoat.

When I say moral, I am not passing ethical judgement. I am against foreign intervention out of principle. By moral I am refering to this self created position of guardian of the free world. Because without the aura of defender of freedom a lot of US measures would not be acceptable. You previously mentioned that the US is not the only one that has a foreign intelligence agenda, true but they are the only ones that don't hide it and proclaim it's a morally righteous action.

Storing =/= procesing at a individual level, the UK simply does not have the resources to filter trough all their intel, and up until recently used private contractors to do their dirty business. Which I am morally ok with, the US however filters indiscriminately and without any judicial oversight, the sheer potential for abuse is massive and it makes a real democracy imposible due to the fact that nobody is squeaky clean.

So did North Korea twice, NATO is the US, a peacekeeping UN would not only require China and Russia to approve but would force them to participate. 

&gt;The US will advocate its interests even if it does no have a military treaty

what interests where threatened? I know it's a recent subject but try to  treat it objectively. The issue was Russia abusing a ""free country"", the US would have lost face if they remained pasive, that protector suit would have cracked. It was not a NATO treaty that protected Ukraine and so it won't be a NATO treaty that will protect the baltic states, of course it helps but it is a formality.

Note, I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing. I'd consider a country like Switzerland to be utterly irrelevant on the world scale, but the people living there are doing very well for themselves, arguably better than anyone else in the world.

Let's just say that both places have relatively (in comparison with other Spanish cities) few sights, are fairly cheap and have a wonderful weather (except in july-august when they turn into ovens). Nightlife is way better in Murcia, although Cartagena has improved in the recent years. Both are university cities, but being Cartagena the seat of a technical university has an impact in the men:women ratio of the student community.

As a quick guide: in Murcia you should check out the Cathedral and surroundings, including Trapería street, Plaza de Santo Domingo, etc. For a classic ""aperitivo"" head to Plaza de las Flores (expensive and usually full but the atmosphere is great, especially in spring) and at night go out around the University and Plaza de Europa, in the area known simply as ""Las tascas"", as in ""the pubs"". If the night turns into day, Mariano Rojas has the best after hours, though you'll need a cab to get there.

In Cartagena the sights, including the Roman ruins, are located mostly around the Town Hall and Calle Mayor, and the places to go out at night are around the Principe de Asturias street, known as ""Calle de los pijos"", as in ""Posh street"". Visit the great ARQUA museum, stroll along the harbour and do a day trip to the awesome Calblanque beach.

Both cities are relatively safe and the locals are usually friendly, though they have their share of places to avoid, like La Fama in Murcia or Lo Campano in Cartagena. Just use your common sense and be a bit street smart, the region was heavily hit by the recession so unemployment is high and many try to take advantage.

I think that's enough for a rough impression, just comment/PM if you need more information and I'll happily try to help.

It's fallacious to automatically associate wages and economic growth- one does not equal the other, economies are much more complex than that. 

What I believe /u/fgumo was getting it is that labor laws like they have in Spain are making the problem worse because they make the labor market overly-rigid, especially in a down economy: the economy isn't expanding at a pace that demands labor, and employers are hesitant to hire anyone because it's so expensive to let them go.

Misconception that Stalin industrialized Russia? Well, he actually did. I despise his methods but he did. Russia wasn't strictly a pre-industrial society, it was 4th or 5th European economy at the time which is pretty strong all things considered.

&gt; There are no means of production for the proletariat to seize, which in a big way defeats the purpose of a Communist revolution. Trying to industrialize after the fact doesn't fix that problem. You can't build a house with no foundation.

Well that's where I disagree with whole idea of communist revolution: seizing. Proletariat should create their own means of productions and prove the world that their methods are much more effective. Seizing things during a revolution always has a horrible and ugly grimace, I hope you never experience that on the receiving end.

&gt; Capitalism ""works"" because that is what people are used to, there is no mindset or willpower to educate people outside this current societal thought, so corporations grow more powerful and capitalism continues to reward that greed, whereas we are essentially powerless to stop it within the current political systems.

That is impossible, for several reasons. Say that you want higher pensions, lower taxes and retire early. And then you vote no to no more loans? And, democracy doesn't mean that every single thing should be voted on. Then people would have to vote every day, not have time to work etc. That is why we have parlaments, so they can vote every day for us.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt; Which I am morally ok with, the US however filters indiscriminately and without any judicial oversight

That is exactly what the British GCHQ is doing. They store every byte of data and sift through it to see what they want to save and what to discard. Although their programs dont have such an international focus, blanket metadata collection is also what Germany, France, Spain, Denmark, etc. are doing. Its the same thing, the only difference is they mostly, but not exclusively, target their own citizens. This is a moot issue since all of these countries are sharing all this info without so much as asking what it is being used for. Also, I am not saying the US program is good, quite the contrary. But the moral self righteousness from European nations after the leaks was very hypocritical given what they are doing. Although I do understand why they did it. The politicians had to try to save face since they didn't realize Snowden also had dirt on them. I am more disgusted with politicians in general than European ones in particular. 

&gt;what interests where threatened?

Access to a new market is one, but minor. And I will admit, most of the outrage was due to the fact a sovereign nation was invaded. But that is the main sticking point with most nations. Even passive Germany spoke out very strongly against that. 

In this day and age the international community clearly frowns upon invading other nations. And I will be the first to admit there is some hypocrisy from the US here. John Kerry's quote sums it up pretty well (from memory), ""you dont just invade a country based on trumped up charges and faulty intelligence."" 

&gt;It was not a NATO treaty that protected Ukraine and so it won't be a NATO treaty that will protect the baltic states, of course it helps but it is a formality.

Ukraine wasn't protected. It is likely going to lose Crimea. The US did nothing militarily and will likely do nothing militarily. There is a *huge* difference between a diplomatic intervention and a military intervention. 

To the contrary, the US is increasing troop and equipment presence in Eastern NATO member countries. It would be a much different situation if a NATO member were attacked. The US has a moral and contractual obligation to intervene militarily, not just diplomatically. 

Also, I agree the US defense budget needs to be cut. I think 2.9% is reasonable, which is what is projected. My only point is with these cuts comes less of a commitment to Europe. As the cuts are implemented more US presence is wanted in Asia, not less. So there is more competition for less resources. Given Europe's wealth it is very likely that is where the capability will come from. The UK and France's agreement to cooperate more is a big start, but more EU integration would definitely eliminate a lot of waste and redundancy.

Du bohrst so sehr nach dass ich kurz Klartext spreche:
Die Frau auf dem Cover hat allem anschein nach sich hier freiwillig ablichten lassen. Sie ist die Gebieterin über ihren Körper und kann damit machen was sie will. Also, was dich daran stört ist also die gesellschaftliche Aussagekraft der Werbung selbst. Aber warum? Es ist eine blöde Werbung von irgend wo einem Imbissbudenbesitzer. So what?

Fernköstlichkeit... ja, nicht ganz gelungen. Aber Rassismus sieht anders aus. Ich habe schon einigen Konfrontationen mit rassistischem Hintergrund beigewohnt. Wo jemand aktiv bedroht wurde, nur weil er anders aussieht. Ein Griff ins Klo bei der Wortwahl ist nicht rassismus, es ist einfach nur ein Griff ins Klo. Und wenn du befürchtest dass der Typ der das verbrochen hat ein Rassist ist, geh zu ihm und frage ihn. Und zeig nicht mit dem digitalen Zeigefinger auf etwas dessen Intention du nicht kennst.

Außerdem, und diese Frage möchte ich bitte beantwortet haben: Was ist das mit der braunen Scheiße? Nazis? Sind alle gleich Nazis? Rassismus, Nationalismus, National-Sozialismus, Ausländerfeindlichkeit sind Grundverschiedene Dinge. Die wenigsten Gehirne sind wirklich braun eingefärbt.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"The problem with nominal is that it does not take currency fluctuations into account. It is good for determining a country's international clout but not all that good at determining how much an average person can buy. 

Disposable income is probably the best measure. But even that has drawbacks. It does not take into account spending on education and healthcare in places like the US that is covered by taxes in other countries (disposable income figures have taxes subtracted from income). 

The [British government](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_310463.pdf) publishes a report that lists ""Actual Disposable Income"" which takes into account health and education expenditures, but it is limited only to OECD nations.

Ultimately there is not perfect methodology. I think when looking at what a person makes, it is also important to adjust for what they can buy. It helps equalize the comparison. If looking at national (or bloc) economic clout then nominal is better. It shows what that country can buy internationally and the economic might behind it. (NOTE: PPP takes into account consumer prices in the market, some of which are imported. I can see how my comment might infer it excluded imports).

Methodology of ""Actual Disposable Income"" of the above report:

&gt;To allow for true international comparisons, in this section household disposable income is adjusted
for services provided by government such as healthcare and education. Whilst these are largely
free to households in some countries (such as the UK) they are not in all, meaning households
in some countries would have to pay for these services out of their income. As a result, when
making international comparisons on standards of living or well-being, it is important to adjust for
this difference. This services adjusted indicator is referred to in this paper as household actual
disposable income. We also adjust for the size of a country by looking at ‘per head’ measures. 

NOTE: The report starts off at a PPP base.",0,1396478650,null,0,false,0,cgijslh,t3_2213iw,t1_cgijslh,t1_cgie7bt,null,1433183333,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

_Edit:_ come to think of it, that's not true, strictly speaking.  Dollars are printed on a linen/cotton mix.  Most developed countries' currencies, if they're worth anything, use some kind of highly sophisticated, specialized mix of paper, natural cloth fibers, and artificial fibers.  [Here, go forge some Euros](http://trackingcybercrime.blogspot.de/2012/06/i-have-found-recent-article-on-c.html).

Modern dollars are actually pretty sophisticated, despite their comparative drabness.  [Here is an overview](http://www.newmoney.gov/) - [This article](http://www.esquire.com/features/benjamin-hundred-dollar-bill-0913) includes some info about the guys who do the actual design of the plates at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, it is a pretty fascinating process, although [they fuck up occasionally](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/08/blunder-at-the-money-factory.html).  A lot of countries actually outsource their paper currency design and printing to companies like De La Rue, though, since it's not economical for them to maintain their own mints.

One of the theories I've read about why US bills were so heavily redesigned starting in 1996 (?) is that a clear visual upgrade was required to dispel the perception that dollars were easy to forge - even though the US treasury had been incorporating anti-counterfeiting measures incrementally over the years before.

I'm not 100% sure where I saw this, and would be interested to chase it down, but apparently part of the logic was that a significant part of the developing world's grey/black market economies (which in turn constitute a sizable proportion of many countries' economies) relied on cash dollar transactions, particularly in $100 bills.  The perception that dollars could be readily forged would undermine confidence in the only stable currency available for those markets, thus causing widespread economic instability - thus a large part of the world actually exerted pressure on the US to do something to visibly show that the dollar was being upgraded.

Particularly North Korea regularly engages in mass forgery of US currency - check that Esquire article I linked for some more details.  Apparently they come somewhat close to getting it right, but that's not inconceivable when you have the resources of a government behind your counterfeiting operation...
