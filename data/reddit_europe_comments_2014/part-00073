I guess it's still fair to say it was about as good an outcome as could have been hoped for (short of having done the territory swap proposed by Stalin's representatives, but we had no idea whether it was a credible offer or that war was even a possibility. +Who knows if this would've been interpreted as weakness and they'd have invaded anyway...) But absolutely, some Finns take the Winter War thing way over the top.

Our counterfactual history (what if?) is more tied to the Continuation War, which was a bit of a blunder (although I understand the emotional reasons for it). For one thing we'd still have access to the Arctic Sea and perhaps a claim on a slice of the North Pole. We'd also have the nickel reserves of Petsamo/Pechenga, but on the other hand all those natural resources haven't done the Russian economy much good.

I know that Putin told our former president ""let's not open this pandora's box of righting old wrongs"" when they discussed the Carelian question (and she was completely happy with that), but his hypocrisy does really irk me because he seems perfectly happy to readjust Russia's borders  when it benefits him... I think there might have been a chance to get some territories back in the early 1990s if we'd have really wanted them. Yeltsin might have sold some to us, but that window is now firmly shut. But we Finns realise that most Finns and Finnic people that remained were sent to camps or just killed, that what was once a prosperous region has fallen into serious disrepair, and that we'd get a large Russian minority ready to be protected by the Duma with anything we'd buy.

true,MartelFirst,IDF,Ile-de-France,"One can propose any way they like, in accordance to what they feel their partner's personality would like.

It can be a super romantic cheesy proposal with an overpriced diamond ring, and asking approval to the father beforehand, or a mutually agreed marriage with no particularly grandiose proposal moment. In most cases, it still involves a ring.

But like for any other country, the moment of proposal depends on the individual personalities of the couple, and it's all fine. There's no cultural obligation to propose in one way or another.

As a guy, if I eventually want to get married with a girlfriend, I assume I'll know her enough to know how she'd want to be proposed to. If she likes the romantic stuff, I'll propose romantically, in one way or another, the only limit being my own personality and what I'm comfortable with doing.

But if you want an actual answer to your question, I guess that in the culture, the general way to propose (if you want to have a proposal moment, which isn't that common in France) is the man invites the woman to a fairly fancy restaurant, and proposes relatively romantically with a golden ring, without necessarily asking her father's permission. Nothing too fancy, or too extravagant, while still making it a special occasion. It's basically the same all over the Western world.

My brother made some fairly elaborate marriage proposal (night out, and back home there were roses spread all over their apartment), but they had agreed beforehand to get married, so it wasn't like he was taking a risk.

true,MerlinsBeard,UNSA,United States of America,"5% is a lot when you consider it's against a $300,000 house and is compounding over 30 years. You end up paying $576,000 effective for the house over the 30 years if you have the loan for the entire term. However, that's just how lending works. 5% is definitely low for a mortgage but it's depressing when you think about how much is just wasted money.

And it's kind of convoluted. You submit employment slips showing 3 months (at least I did) wages in order to secure a loan. They give out a loan ceiling amount based on how much you're making (say, a $50,000 salary would probably get approved for a $200,000 house). This is when the rate is also set. However, that only lasts for 30 days from the time the bank offers it, and accepting it is no strings attached.

So you go out house hunting with your $200,000/30 year/5% APR mortgage offer. You find a lovely 3 bedroom asking $210,000. Uh oh.

So you make a low-ball offer of $190,000. Homeowner comes back with $200,000. You respond with $200,000 and for the homeowner to pay closing costs (costs associated with the paperwork needing to be done, deed, etc... normally is done by homeowner) and they agree. 

Depending on the homeowner, it can be very quick of very painful. I visited the house I currently own, offered, negotiated and was accepted in the same day. I signed paperwork within the week (offer/acceptance was on a Tuesday) and signed the papers and got my house on that Friday. However, I was pre-approved for a loan and it was a very solid lending institution which actually gave me quite a bit of negotiating room as the buyer *knew* they were getting my offer instead of agreeing on an offer and then the potential buyer not being able to secure a loan.

If someone offered on a house and *then* had to work through getting secured for a loan and was having to sell their current house ... *that's* when it gets difficult and lengthy. 

The most power is in the hands of a buyer with a pre-approved loan buying from a motivated seller (i.e. someone that wants to sell quicker instead of for the most money). Shoot any questions you have my way. There was a decent amount of misinformation spread around due to the 2008 crisis and I think a lot of people have the wrong idea about homelending in the US. Especially now that it's tighter regulated (my lending institution is a credit union so they're not the scalpers that the national banks are).",0,1394758608,null,0,false,0,cg22ox3,t3_20bffs,t1_cg22ox3,t1_cg21lgg,null,1432791179,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

For example, mine is tied to the 12 month Euribor rate, which means that my interest rate is what the 12 month Euribor was on the day I signed the loan papers + my bank's fees. This works out to around 2%. After a year has passed, my rate will be readjusted to the new value of the 12 month Euribor, so it might go up or down. 

That rate is just what you called ""credit interest"". As for reducing the debt, well, here again you have multiple options. For example, you could

1) pay a fixed sum (e.g. €1000) each month. If your interest rate goes up, the duration of your loan will be lengthened because a larger part of that €1000 will go towards the interest rather than reducing the debt.

2) Same as above, except if the interest rate changes, your monthly payment changes to reflect that, while keeping the loan duration the same.

3) Reduce your debt by a fixed sum each month. That means your total monthly payments will change according to the interest, meaning you will be making larger payments at the start of your loan (as you have more debt collecting interest than towards the end of your loan).

&gt; bei gleicher Qualifizierung

Ja, dieser Stammtischspruch ist mir bekannt. Ist aber nur Blabla, denn am Ende drohen doch Maßnahmen, wenn die Quote nicht erfüllt wird, und dann gibt's noch die Presse und zivilen Druck, wenn eine Frau mit dem Arbeitgeber nicht gleicher Meinung ist, was ihre Qualifikation angeht, gibts arbeitsrechtliche Prozesse, und dann noch die Frage was heißt „gleiche“ Qualifikation, und wer entscheidet, wann eine Qualifikation gleich ist, etc. Unter diesen Gesichtspunkten ist es erstmal nicht klar, wie

&gt; freiwillig  ~~(wtf? xD)~~

und wie relativ „freiwillige“ und „relative“ Frauenquoten wirklich sind, und ob man man wirklich

&gt; genug Zeit hat,

etc. etc, und es nicht vielleicht doch eher darum geht, möglichst schnell die Pflichtstellen mit irgendwelchen Frauen zu besetzen, vor allem, wenn wir von  Schweden sprechen.

In dem von dir verlinkten Wiki-Artikel für Frauenquoten findet sich der Satz:

&gt;Die Vorwürfe, dass nun einige wenige Frauen in vielen Verwaltungsräten sitzen sowie dass das Qualifikationsniveau durch die Quote gesenkt wurde, konnten hinsichtlich der Kumulation wissenschaftlich bewiesen werden [35].

(Abschnitt „Norwegen“)

Sieh mal an, da war meine Idee also gar nicht so neu, wie ich dachte. Naja.

Der Rest, den du schreibst, ist irgendwie eher was für ne allgemeine Diskussion Frauenquote pro und contra, hat mit der Fragestellung: Kann das Ergebnis der schwedischen Studie mit Frauenquoten zusammenhängen, nicht wirklich was zu tun. Da will ich jetzt aus Zeitmangel nicht drauf eingehen.

Eine Frage habe ich noch zu deinem Kommentar:

true,Viljor,null,null,"That's a really good question, there are a couple of reasons why it's like that. One thing is still the hard coal industry. I sadly don't have any sources since I'm on mobile but the curves of unemployment rate and hard coal industry are almost exactly inverted. Everyone who lives here,  over more generations, is somehow related to those industries. My grand father,  uncle and almost all of my..grand uncles..(?) 
Those industries were supported by state money, everybody thought there'd always be a huge market for coal. So in contrast to other cities,  the Ruhrgebiet cities stagnated. There was no investments for the future, Here most people see themselves as the working class,  not smart but motivated. That lead to a lack of qualified worker,  in times of the industrial revolution cheap workers were the shit. But nowadays with all those students quality work is much easier to get and also the only reason EU products are better than Asian products. So without the coal industry and with a lack of qualified people, the unemployment rate rise dramatically. You see the coal industry basically was the vein of the Ruhrgebiet, most of the workers just stopped working after those were  closed. 

Therefore the main investments of the Ruhrgebiet is to merge to a huge ""city"".  Not a real city, but a place where they specialize cities to focus on areas. Like in every other metropolis. They try to invest in education,  the Uni Kamp Lintfort is almost finished. 
I guess you're right that people move here because of the cheap environment.  But the most important point in the next and last 20-30years will be the coal industry. ",0,1394781780,null,0,false,0,cg2ar0u,t3_20dloo,t1_cg2ar0u,t3_20dloo,null,1432795045,4,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,4

First of all: Out of my ~ 130 facebook ""friends"" 99% are living in the ruhrgebiet. Only 1 was unemployed for half a year. I don´t know anyone who gets Hartz IV. That may be because of my friends and mine background (nearly everyone has abitur and has done a Ausbildung or has studied), but yes, the unemployment rates are pretty high, especially Gelsenkirchen or Duisburg. But I guess this is mostly true for the people who don´t want to work in a Zeitarbeitsfirma (I wouldn´t either) or the people who never have learned a job through a Ausbildung.  
For the rent: It depends on where you live. There a good parts, and bad parts. In the city where I live, the rent is pretty high (not on a level with munich or something like that), but that´s just because my city has no real bad places.  
  
People that move to the ruhrgebiet because of the cheap rent: Never heard of it, or read anything about it.

That there is always a vanguard of the revolution. Be it the communist party or the proles. When any group has all the power it will abuse it.

Pretty much *the* problem of Leninism, which relies on the party to lead the revolution and the state. That's why you often hear the argument that this was not real communism, because it certainly was not what Marx had in mind. After all, communism should lead to the abandonment of the state after some time. Although Marxist-Socialism is authoritarian in nature, there's no denying that. On the other hand, council communism is antiauthoritarian in nature and decentralized as well. Basically there's authoritarian socialism and antiauthoritarian socialism, you can put almost every variety of socialism in those two categories. They may have other differences as well, sometimes even fundamental, but all in all they are either for a very strong state or against it.

Bonus: [Interesting article about anarchosyndicalism during the spanish civil war in Catalonia](http://libcom.org/history/1936-1939-the-spanish-civil-war-and-revolution)

&gt;In 1937 the central government admitted that the war industry of Catalonia produced ten times more than the rest of Spanish industry put together and that this output could have been quadrupled if Catalonia had the access to necessary means of purchasing raw materials.  

  
&gt;Within workplaces wages were equalised and conditions greatly improved. Take for example the tramways. Out of the 7,000 workers, 6,500 were members of the CNT. Street battles had brought all transport to a halt. The transport syndicate appointed a commission of seven to occupy the administrative offices while others inspected the tracks and drew up a plan of repair work that needed to be done. Five days after the fighting stopped, 700 tramcars, instead of the usual 600, all painted in the black and red colours of the CNT were operating on the streets of Barcelona.

&gt;With the profit motive gone, safety became more important and the number of accidents was reduced. Fares were lowered and services improved. In 1936, 183,543,516 passengers were carried. In 1937 this had gone up by 50 million. The trams were running so efficiently that the workers were able to give money to other sections of urban transport.

Yeah, how about Obama's [Solyndra gig](http://www.washingtonpost.com/solyndra-politics-infused-obama-energy-programs/2011/12/14/gIQA4HllHP_story.html)? Or [numerous other ones](http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/13/nation/la-na-smallpox-20111113)? And it's not like you're going to [hear about it either](http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Sharyl-Attkisson-CBS-Solyndra-Fast/2014/03/10/id/557202/). And how about running a billion-dollar spying program to keep track of your citizens? Obama sifts through billions of public money and the amounts that get squandered are quite staggering.

&gt; I don't think you can really pin Obama as evil. Incompetent and weak? Possibly.

So, that's your argument? That he doesn't know any better? How about [selling teens to private prisons](http://www.examiner.com/article/pennsylvania-judge-sentenced-to-28-years-prison-for-selling-teens-to-prisons), does this happen in Putin's Russia? US still has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Obama didn't do shit about it. Or the Guantanamo bay? Last time I checked it was still around. Or the Lybia gig. What a fucking disaster. Thousands of civilians died in these NATO strikes, you know. Turning entire country into a Mad Max movie set with islamists in charge, thanks Obama. And revolution in Syria was ALWAYS a dirty war. Still is, and Obama is sponsoring the islamists there as we speak. And there is [another war](http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175567/tomgram%3A_nick_turse%2C_america's_shadow_wars_in_africa_/) US is waging that you won't even hear about.

&gt; Obama has also been pretty diplomatic in terms of foreign policy

Which part? Bombing the shit out of Lybia? Sponsoring Al Quaeda in Syria? Starving people in Iran with sanctions while failing to affect its nuclear program? Spying on US allies?

&gt; Маргарите Симоньян стало стыдно за съеденный бигмак
&gt; 
&gt; Главный редактор Russia Today Маргарита Симоньян съела бигмак. Об этом она написала в своем твиттере. Инцидент произошел 13 марта. По словам Симоньян, ей стыдно за этот поступок. Главред не рассказала, в каком из заведений McDonald’s она принимала пищу.
&gt; 
&gt; Маргарита Симоньян и ранее рассказывала о своих кулинарных пристрастиях. В конце 2013 года она собственноручно приготовила бобра. Симоньян сварила его голову с луком, морковью и лавровым листом. Сообщение Симоньян о приготовлении бобра вызвало резонанс в социальных сетях.
&gt; 
&gt; Симоньян вместе с семьей владеет рестораном «Жарко», который открыли к Олимпиаде в Сочи между Адлером и Красной поляной. Журналист The Guardian Шон Уокер, побывавший в заведении, лестно отозвался о нем и посоветовал Симоньян закончить работу в журналистике и переключиться на ресторанный бизнес.
&gt; 
&gt; Маргарита Симоньян возглавляет Russia Today с момента основания в 2005 году. Телеканал позиционирует себя как ретранслятор позиции руководства России на иностранную аудиторию.

What do you call sending soldiers over and occupying a piece of territory then?

&gt;Or, in this case of yours, acting hostile towards the bum vs. actually physical aggression. A difference between shouting at him and hurting him. You can say that you didn't mean anything when you shouted at him. That's different from claiming you didn't push him when you did. Sexual harassment would be a better allegory.

Who hurt the bum?

&gt;And I think there's little difference between actually being aggressive towards them and them thinking we're being aggressive towards them.

In the first case they're acting in self-defense, in the second case they're acting as the aggressor. It's a fundamental difference, and I have trouble understanding where you get this unless you deny the relevance of objective reality in this matter.

&gt;&gt;No. Ukraine can partake in hostilities against Russia already, they don't need to be a NATO member to do so. It only increases the risk for Ukraine if Russia was planning to attack Ukraine or a NATO member.

&gt;I don't understand what you're saying here, TBH.

If Ukraine and friends wanted to gang up on Russia they could do so at any time, with or without NATO. NATO does not obligate assistance in aggressive wars, only in defensive wars. The only obligation created by joining NATO against Russia is a defensive one, activated when Russia would attack a NATO member.

&gt;You keep using the word ""defensive alliance"", when in reality, it's a military alliance that's build around common defense.

NATO members have no obligations when a NATO member initiates an attack.

&gt;But to answer you question: Nobody is saying that. Nobody is saying that one side is more hostile than the another. I just said that Finland joining NATO would be considered an aggressive act towards Russia. Which it will be. I don't remember comparing which action is more hostile.

A defensive alliance is by definition not an aggressive more. An offensive alliance would, but NATO isn't an offensive alliance, there have been sufficient examples of wars recently where some NATO members partook and some did not.

&gt;You are talking about Ukraine. Right. But see, I didn't say anything about this. I didn't try to justify Russian aggression here.

Yes, you are, because you're trying to paint joining a defensive alliance as an aggressive action.

&gt;It doesn't. But like I said, this wasn't about any of this. It started when I said that bringing Yanks to Finland is an aggressive act towards Russia, which you disagreed with. That's fine, we can discuss that, but leave this other business out of it. Even though I like discussing this other stuff with you, it's not relevant here.

It's completely relevant. Finland has been attacked by Russia before, it only makes sense for them to want to prevent another attack, so them joining NATO is entirely sensible as a defensive measure.",0,1394788235,null,0,false,0,cg2bsow,t3_207yrh,t1_cg2bsow,t1_cg1nbvx,null,1432795534,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Sadly, public discourse focuses so much on the person of Hoeneß that the real discussion is almost ignored (just look at the answers in this thread)

In recent years, some German states bought CDs from anonymous sources that contained information on people with Swiss bank accounts/people that might be evading tax. There was a lot of controversy about it.

These CDs were used to encourage people to report themselves for tax evasion (resulting in a softer penalty compared to what you'd get if you were caught regularly). 

Especially the CSU/CDU are/were proposing complete exemption from punishment (you just have to pay back the taxes you evaded) if you report yourself, while more left-leaning parties are/were definitely for keeping the punishment.

Then Uli Hoeneß reported himself and, since he's well known in public, it garnered a lot of attention.

The ones who say he got off too lightly, and the ones who, on the opposite end of the spectrum, think he should go free because even with the withheld taxes, he's paid more taxes than any of us ever (no joke, that was an argument in another thread). The first bunch take the desire for justice to the extreme, while the second lot denounce the first lot as jealous lefties. And then there's a whole bunch of more or less simplistic and levelheaded opinions in between. 

But it's not that simple. A soccer club like FC Bayern München, of which Hoeneß was President, is bigger than just one person. It employs a fair number of people, and especially when as successful as this one, handles a lot of money, much of which goes back into the community in the form of taxes, salaries and donations. So it's quite natural that in Bavaria, which would get most out of the above benefits, you'll get a disproportionate number of people who think and say he should go free, because of all the good that he's done, for the club and otherwise. 

On the other hand, the argument from those who may be less affected by all the positive effects of the club, is that if it was anyone else, less famous and influential, they would just be sent to jail. It doesn't happen often that someone in a prominent position such as Hoeneß, admits to wrongdoing and gets found guilty and sent to jail. This leads people to believe that there are different kinds of law for those who are rich and powerful, and for those who aren't.

Depends on what you call ""practicing"".

Und selbstverständlich ist deine Idee nicht neu xDDD

Wo du da hingeschissen hast, scheißt die internationale  Forschung seit nem Jahrzehnt regelmäßig und sehr groß hin.

Nur fehlt deiner Idee immer noch die Grundlage in Deutschland.

Und zum Thema ""bewiesen anhand dem fall von Norwegen"":

Ich hab dir gesagt, dass du bei **absoluter** Quote richftig liegen kannst, wenn für die umstrukturierung zb nicht genug Zeit gegeben wird.

Ich kann zwar jetzt am Handy nicht genaue Daten nachrecherchieren, aber meines Wissens gilt für Norwegen jetzt schon eine 40%ige absolute(?) Quote.


Deine Idee trifft also erstens immer noch nicht für die aktuelle Lage zu, kann deshalb den Effekt im verlinkten Artikel nicht erklären.


Zweitens kann man die norwegische Realität gar nicht mit den momentan diskutierten Zukunftsvorschlägen für Deutschland vergleichen.

In Norwegen gabs viel zu wenig Anpassungszeit, deshalb, wie ich das verstanden hab, will man es ja gerade **nicht** so wie Norwegen machen.

Deine empirische ""Beweislage"" läuft bei der Erklärung der momentanen Lage/Entwicklung der letzten paar Jahren in Deutschland und bei Bedenken zukünftiger deutsche Frauenquotierung ins Leere.

**Edit:**

Norwegen musste innerhalb von 2 Jahren seine Frauenquote um 33% erhöhen.

Unsere Frauenquote in Vorständen stieg noch nicht einmal um 3% die letzten 2 Jahre.


Soviel zum Vergleich DE-NOR ;)

(Aktuell sollen ja 40% angeblich bis 2021 beschlossen werden, wär also 3mal so viel plus die fast 10 Jahre, in der die Wirtschaft schon zu freiwilliger Einstellung gemahnt wird. Wenn die aber weiter pennen bin ich ehrlich gesagt aber auch sogar für ne absolute Quote, dann sind se halt selber Schuld. In dem Fall soll die Quote nämlich dann als Dambrecher fungieren, den man mit Freiwillgkeit nicht erreicht. In wenigen Jahren dannach hat sich dann die Gesellschaft so umstrukturiert, dass man die Quote wieder fallen lassen kann. Ich denke so in etwa ist das auch breiter Konsens in SPD/Grüne/Linke und sogar Teilen der CDU und sowieso im Koalitionsvertrag festgehalten.)",0,1394793334,null,0,1394807353,0,cg2cjr6,t3_209ont,t1_cg2cjr6,t1_cg2apfp,null,1432795889,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

&gt; Estremismo in genere == basso livello di educazione.

Ci sono differenze evidenti e a mio parete innegabili: prima di tutto l'estremismo di destra è più violento e più discriminatorio. L'ideologia fascista ha in sé il concetto di violenza e sopraffazione del diverso - anche nel quotidiano - mentre ""il comunismo"" (tra virgolette perchè sono semplificazioni, ma è per capirci) è un'ideologia, almeno in europa, che ha valori inclusivi, di uguaglianza e rispetto del diverso. Spesso anche nei suoi estremismi, salvo casi deviati e isolati come il terrorismo rosso.

Non si può affatto, né storicamente né analizzando gli estremismi di oggi, considerare ""simili"" nei comportamenti e ideali fascismo e comunismo. Nè In Italia oggi, né nella storia europea. Chi lo facesse compirebbe una grave sottovalutazione oltre che un falso storico, secondo me.

Il fascismo ha ideali intrinseci di violenza, razzismo e sopraffazione del diverso. In Italia ha causato la peggiore tragedia sociale e civile della storia italiana, ha contribuito agli anni più bui del 20mo secolo, e a causare milioni di morti nel mondo. L'esperienza partigiana, da cui nascono i partiti della sinistra italiana, ha sconfitto la dittatura, ha voluto la democrazia, ha fondato una Costituzione pacifica, inclusiva e solidale, e l'ha difesa fino a oggi. 

Anche gli estremismi di oggi m sembrano tuttora ben diversi, almeno quanto lo sono gli ideali di base e le responsabilità storiche: l'approccio del ""sono tutti uguali"" è fallace sia storicamente che filosoficamente.",0,1394794307,null,0,false,0,cg2cp7v,t3_206q7f,t1_cg2cp7v,t1_cg1sz4v,null,1432795961,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

&gt;The European Commission plans to force mobile phone manufacturers to manufacture one mobile phone charger for all mobile phones, according the European Commissioner for Industry, Gunther Verheugen in an interview with the German international broadcaster Deutsche Welle. Verheugen said that his patience has been tested enough by the mobile phone industry, which was given several chances to develop one charger for all mobile phones, and he does not exclude severe measures to force the manufacturers to come with a solution. The main reason for his demand is trying to decrease the volume of electrical waste within Europe, which is become a major environmental problem. The current situation that requires users to purchase a new mobile charger with each new mobile phone has become unbearable according to Verheugen. In a reaction, the president of the European Information &amp; Communications Technology Industry Association (EICTA), Tony Graziano, told Deutsche Welle that Verheugen's demand is legally and technically impossible to due differences in voltage and battery requirements within the European Union, although he acknowledged the increasing burden of mobile phone chargers on the environment. He also said that the industry is not likely to develop one charger for all brands. Verheugen also said that he rather sees the industry to develop such a charger voluntary, but warns that the EC has the legal and political means to force such development.

If said diplomat wants the EU there he should work towards giving the EU foreign policy competency. Being that he's French, there's no way France would want Europe acting on their behalf regarding foreign policy, so again its a stupid comment causing unnecessary controversy.

Kommentar von c15pl erklärt das ganz gut:

Der Artikel gibt die Ausführungen Gysis leider unvollständig wieder. Weder erwähnt er, dass er den Konflikt um die Ukraine als Resultat einer gerade vom Westen geführten konfliktorischen Außenpolitik seit 1990 begreift, die auf die nicht ausgeloteten Chancen zu einer Zusammenarbeit mit Russland verzichtet habe, noch erwähnt Frau Beitzer, dass eine NATO-Erweiterung auch von einzelnen Ministern früherer US-Administrationen abgelehnt wurde. (Gysi unterschlägt allerdings, dass die neuen Beitrittsstaaten der NATO auch auf deren Wunsch beigetreten sind). Vollends unverständlich ist, dass Frau Beitzer die von dem Redner erwähnten Vorschläge Kissingers zur Lösung der Krise nicht einmal erwähnt. Er m. E. hat auch die Maidanbewegung keineswegs pauschal verurteilt. Ob man die Swobodapartei als faschistisch bezeichnen kann, sei späteren Historikerdiskussionen überlassen. Eine Gefahr stellt sie nach Meinung des Europa-Parlaments jedenfalls dar, das 2012 ausdrücklich vor einer Koalition mit dieser Partei warnte. Die Ausführungen Gysis sind daher keineswegs ""reflexhaft"", auch wenn sie der Meinung der Autorin widersprechen mögen.

I have to disagree strongly with you on this point. 

Russia absolutely *does need* Crimea as a port. [It's only one of a few warm-water ports that Russia has which it can operate in a year-round fashion without hassle](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/warm-water-port.htm). Even St. Petersburg and Vladivostok freeze over at times, with the port in Vladivostok having to be kept open with ice breakers *(not sure about Russian naval bases in Kalingrad)*.  

One of the few other warm-water ports *(if not the ONLY other one)*? It's in Syria. And it's pretty clear, given Putin's support of Assad, just how far Russia will go to maintain and expand it's network of deep-water ports, especially the coveted warm-water ports, many of which, as pointed out above, *arn't even in Russia*.

No, they have not been implemented and have not gone into effect yet.

Nor did I have ever even hint towards the notion that no action was being taken, I just said that inaction *(directed towards those who believe it the best course, such as those in the Schroeder camp)* as being unwise. But even now, the economic sanctions are limited, and while not appeasement *(nor have I stated these moves were appeasement)*, they should be expanded.

But the level of inaction and number of European countries arguing against it *(Germany and Britain chief among them)* was pretty god damn strong before Russia rolled into Crimea. Perhaps Russia would've been a little more hesitant if it thought the European Union was a little more serious about utilizing it's soft power and taking concrete steps against Ukraine's previous government and Russia's involvement in the issue; but we'll never know, now will we? 

&gt;No it isn't, not going full bore with maximum sanctions and/or immediate military action at the earliest opportunity is **not** appeasement. By that logic, *all* negotiation is appeasement since you're giving something up in order to come to a resolution - there is no scenario where Russia simply ups and leaves without gaining an inch so we need to stop pretending that possibility exists.

All negotiation are not appeasement, but wanting negotiations that are undertaken with the already agreed upon goal of changing nothing *(with the exception of angry letter writing)* **is appeasement**. I mean Britain and France condemned Germany annexing Czechoslovakia, but them not doing anything after negotiating with Germany is still considered the prime example of appeasement. 

And no, there is no chance of that happening, which is why when you go into negotiations you try to make sure the other guy leaves with as little as possible and you leave with as much as possible. I don't think the best way to achieve that is with appeasement or limited sanctions. 

&gt;Well; he has a point, after the breakup of the Soviet Union we did promise not to expand NATO to the point where Russia felt surrounded and yet we've done just that, it's worth looking at it from their perspective, if Putin had somehow regained the Baltic states, Finland and Ukraine etc. into a Eurasian Union and started creeping closer and closer to our borders with a military pact we'd probably be shitting ourselves, it's silly to pretend that it's okay for us to do it instead because we're the good guys.

**Than why do you villianize and condemn appeasement when you understand, and it would appear, even agree with, the principles behind it in this specific scenario?** 

And you misrepresent me. 

I mean...sure...I think *we do* have the moral upper-hand in this situation, and I believe *we do* have a more democratic, open and transparent in comparison to Russia, but that said: 

It's not okay mainly because we're the good guys *(a childish label I dispute)*, it's okay because it's in our interests. Russia would do the same because it's in their interests, and the European Union would be shitting itself because it's not in their interests and threat to their safety. So, guess what? The shit's in Russia's backyard, not ours, and that's, for all intents and purposes, a good thing. 

And that's because, at the end of the day, realpolitik rules the scene in international politics. 

Honestly, you know what I believe? Do you know what I think would make for a more stable and prosperous Russia? A more federalized European Union? A more balanced international community? If Ukraine and the Baltic States *(with the exception of Finland)* **did** go with Russia' Eurasian Union. 

Of course, this would be to the determinant of the people of those countries, who still have painful memories of the last time they were in a supranational club with Russia, so they would never accept it, but hey, that's my view. 

And since the people in those countries don't want it, what I think would work the best in the bigger picture and what Putin wants doesn't really mean shit...well....unless you're Crimea. 

But I do enjoy the national American pastime of making life difficult for the Russian government, and I do know that Russia having to deal with shit in it's own backyard makes it *a lot more difficult* for them to start shit in *our backyard*.

Jesus Christ. How many times do I have to say this: My comment, which you replied to, dealt with Finland joining NATO and how Russia would view it.

&gt;Who hurt the bum?

In that example, ""you"".

&gt;If Ukraine and friends wanted to gang up on Russia they could do so at any time, with or without NATO. NATO does not obligate assistance in aggressive wars, only in defensive wars. The only obligation created by joining NATO against Russia is a defensive one, activated when Russia would attack a NATO member.

But you do agree that a NATO member attacking Russia and being subsequently invaded by Russia would be a strain on NATO (US) - Russia relations? (Though this has little to do with the subject of my original comment.)

&gt;NATO members have no obligations when a NATO member initiates an attack.

&gt;A defensive alliance is by definition not an aggressive more. An offensive alliance would, but NATO isn't an offensive alliance, there have been sufficient examples of wars recently where some NATO members partook and some did not.

Like I said, I think there is a difference between saying ""military alliance"" and ""defensive alliance"". Saying it's an ""defensive alliance"" sounds like you're trying to exclude the other nature of NATO, which is military co-operation.

&gt;Yes, you are, because you're trying to paint joining a defensive alliance as an aggressive action.

For the tenth time: Russians clearly see it as one. And I agree to that. Going from neutral nation to a member of military alliance that is the rival of Russia seems damn much like one. But the nature of it isn't so much a concern here. It's the fact that Russians see it as an aggressive move. And that's something we Finns have to deal with.

But that load of shit about justifying it: First of all, I was talking explicitly about Finland. Second, I never said that joining NATO warrants an aggressive counter move.

I'm not trying to justify shit here. You are making the whole thing up. You are reading what you want to read. So for the love of God, understand this: I'm not trying to justify it and neither am I saying it was justified to attack Ukraine because of the possibility that it might join NATO.

&gt;It's completely relevant. Finland has been attacked by Russia before, it only makes sense for them to want to prevent another attack, so them joining NATO is entirely sensible as a defensive measure.

We've been over this in so many ways. Fact: Russians see it as an aggressive move. Question: Is it truly one? Answer: It's up to everyone to decide for themselves. I think it can be one.

How is walking close to the bum, or talking to his neighbours, hurting him?

&gt;But you do agree that a NATO member attacking Russia and being subsequently invaded by Russia would be a strain on NATO (US) - Russia relations? (Though this has little to do with the subject of my original comment.)

It would be even more damaging for the relations of that NATO member and the rest of NATO.

&gt;Like I said, I think there is a difference between saying ""military alliance"" and ""defensive alliance"". Saying it's an ""defensive alliance"" sounds like you're trying to exclude the other nature of NATO, which is military co-operation.

NATO also cooperated militarily with Russia. Should China feel threatened and occupy Vladivostok?

&gt;For the tenth time: Russians clearly see it as one.

For the tenth time: people see Elvis all the time, doesn't mean he's still alive. Why do you consider Russia's opinion to be the final arbiter on the situation?

&gt;Going from neutral nation to a member of military alliance that is the rival of Russia seems damn much like one.

You keep trying to paint NATO as an offensive alliance while there are several clear examples that NATO membership does *not* obligate its members to joint attacks.

Le blanchiment a pour but de transformer de l'argent ""sale"" en argent ""propre"". 

Imaginons que tu aies 100 000€ obtenus illégalement. 100€, okay, tu peux le dépenser. 1000€, c'est chaud mais pour les dépenses en liquide... mais 100 000€ ? Comment fais-tu ? Tu ne peux pas les déposer à la banque, ou le déclarer aisément. Tu ne peux pas non plus acheter ou investir en liquide, à hauteur de ces sommes, dans pas mal de commerces.

Il faut donc le ""blanchir"". Il existe plein de méthodes : l'article Wikipédia que j'ai mis en lien en début de mon post expose les principales. 

* Des dealers marocains vendent leur drogue. Ils doivent le ""blanchir"" ; c'est-à-dire rendre cet argent ""[légal](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanchiment_d%27argent)"". (Voir fin de mon message.) Pour l'instant, cet argent ne peut pas être utilisé, investi, dépensé légalement. On ne peut pas posséder ou dépenser trop d'argent si on ne peut justifier de son origine. Idem pour certains objets. Si tu possèdes un yacht alors que tu bosses comme caissier de supermarché officiellement, des gens se poseront des questions sur la façon dont tu as pu gagner cet argent.

* Ils donnent leur argent à l'Indien. L'Indien le trimballait dans des sacs de sport jusqu'à Bruxelles, où il était transformé en partie en or. D'une somme d'argent liquide qu'ils ne pouvaient utiliser, ils ont sur les bras un stock d'or qu'ils ne peuvent pas non plus utiliser... mais qu'ils peuvent déjà transporter plus aisément (enfin... l'Indien peut le faire pour eux).

* L'or et l'argent partaient à Dubaï. Là, ils étaient importés ""officiellement"" grâce à de fausses factures produites par les sociétés de Sayed. 

* A Dubaï, investissement dans des activités légales et dépôts dans des bureaux de change (donc ""légalisation""). Mais aussi transformation de l'or : soit en poudre, soit en bijoux.

* La poudre d'or et les bijoux sont envoyés en Inde, premier importateur d'or mondial. Tout y est revendu.

Durant tout le processus, l'argent entre peu à peu dans le circuit légal. Les dealers sont propriétaires de cet argent du début à la fin. Le job de l'Indien était ""juste"" de le blanchir.

The interesting and perhaps not ideal side effect from the perspective of Russia of the annexation is that it's permanently changing the demographics of Ukraine proper, reducing the pro-Russian vote even further (not that Crimea is very populous with its 2 million inhabitants). Never mind the fact that now Ukraine proper is decidedly pissed at Russia.

Ok, so you'll save, on the outside, 20EUR on your trip to the UK. that investment will then be useful for every other visit you make. If you move to the UK, you can use those adapters or rewire a plug. All in all, not much money or time investment compared to the over all moving costs. I guess it makes life simpler for manufacturers but, well, not by much; the UK standard plug is used in a more countries than just the UK, including some outside the EU.

So what's the benefit? Life's a little simpler for tourists and migrants and manufacturers.
 What's the cost? Well, a less safe system being implemented, and it's not just fuses. There are other built in safety features, like the shuttering system in the socket. There's also the conversion costs. As a quick estimate, there are 25million homes in the UK, say a contractor can do the socket exchange in four hours for the entire house, at a relatively cheap rate of 20quid an hour you're looking at £2billion. That excludes the materials. That excludes the disposal costs for the current system.


Basically, the costs do not outweigh the benefits even across the entire EU. They definitely do not outweigh the benefits for those who would have to carry the cost of the conversion i.e. The British, the Irish, and the other member states that use that socket system.

&gt;

&gt;The name *Barcelona* comes from the ancient Iberian [Phoenician](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_language) *Barkeno*, attested in an ancient coin inscription in [Iberian script](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_scripts) as [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Barkeno.png),  in [ancient Greek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek) sources as Βαρκινών, *Barkinṓn*;   and in [Latin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) as *Barcino*,  *Barcilonum*  and *Barcenona*.   

&gt;During [the Middle Ages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages), the city was variously known as *Barchinona, Barçalona, Barchelonaa*, and *Barchenona*.

&gt;Some sources say that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general [Hamilcar Barca](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilcar_Barca), who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC.

&gt;It is thanks to Sikorski that Yanukovich didn’t go for the ultimate pacification of Maidan: “DPG” from February 14th, 2014

&gt;“Of course that talk with Sikorski wasn’t the most comfortable one, maybe he should have spoken with us in another form, but please analyze my words carefully; it is thanks to Sikorski that Yanukovich didn’t go for the ultimate pacification of Maidan. We owe it to him that more blood was not spilled in Kiev,” said Ołeksij Harań, a participant of the discussion between the representatives of Maidan and the ministers of Poland, Germany and France.

&gt;The newspaper in the article “Booed Truce” reveals the negotiation process of reaching an agreement between the Ukrainian opposition and President Victor Yanukovich and underlines the pivotal role of minister Radosław Sikorski in reaching the final agreement.  Ołeksij Harań emphasizes that he was perplexed at the critique aimed at the head of the Polish MSZ in Poland. “Sikorski does not have to apologize. During the discussion a the the Council meeting I took issue with him, but today I will ask him: continue your work on Ukraine, so that  the EU forum doesn’t end with the traditional empty words from Brussels,” remarked  Harań.

&gt;DPG would like to remind you that the situation at Maidan was dramatic at the time and the talks between Yanukovich and the opposition came to a standstill. As it (DPG) states,  “after some time” the ministers of Poland and Germany came to the Maidan Council and presented the outcome of the arrangements with Yanukovich and the opposition. “They said: ‘This was the best thing we could accomplish, you must accept it,’” related  Harań.  Harań then asked if  a substantiating correction could be made to this text and that Radosław Sikorski answered with “No, only this text. Accept it or don’t, but if you don’t accept it, you will be responsible for spilled blood.”  Harań added that  it’s thanks to the Western diplomats that Yanukovich decided on the big thing, reforms to the constitution. The final vote on the compromise was 34:2 in approval.

&gt;The newspaper underlines the difficult assignment  that stood in front of the leaders of Maidan, to convince the people waiting on the square to agree to the compromise. “We had to sign the agreement, because Yanukovich would have used force. The agreement spoke of elections no later than December, and so in accordance with applicable procedures we could have legally  moved the elections to May afterwards. And that was probably the plan,” stated political scientist Marija Zołkina, cited by DPG.

There is no fucking way i'm gonna defend him and he did fucked up Ukraine beyond all recognition, but this is not about that. Its about how the people *feel* they are being represented in Kiev or if they were being heard at all. People **need** to feel that their opinion is important, taken into account or at least being listen to. 

People also need to feel like they are being represented by someone, that someone protects their interests, their desires, their aspirations; Kiev did a pretty shitty job at addressing those issues (if not outright ignored them). Become a parrot and repeat every day in media how you value their opinion, how you will respect their choice, how you want for all of Ukraine to succeed and then *maybe* you will have a chance to preserve United Ukraine. 


I *hope* that there is still a chance for deescalation and i do believe that Moscow would settle at Crimea if Ukraine would declare (and sign some documents) that it will not join NATO or try to seriously hurt Russian interest. But as of now, Russia will continue undermining Ukrainian sovereignty, attack current Kiev administration and show ""real Moscow influence"" for further disintegration of Ukraine.

I wouldn't bother with the Haribo.  Gummy candy is nothing new in the states and the Haribo brand is heavily marketed there as a ""premium"" gummy brand.  The exceptions would be the more off-beat varieties (the vampire ones, the smurf ones, or the Weinland ones, for example), but even then, they're not all that novel to Americans since gummies are gummies.  

Same thing with Ritter Sport.  They're all over the States.

The stuff that we've sent that we've heard particularly favorable things about:

* Lorenz NicNacs, particularly the BBQ flavor.  This is, by far, my favorite German snack.
* Potato chips with flavors unusual to Americans.  For example, the bacon flavored ones or the Thai curry ones or the roasted chicken ones.  Would advise against the mayo/ketchup flavored ones -- not at all compatible with most American palates (some of us like them...but to the majority of us, they're gross).
* Stroopwaffels.  Yeah, they're Dutch, but they're great.
* Erdnuß Flips.  Already mentioned, but OMFG.  It's like eating peanut butter from the can.
* Kinder Hippos.  They're cute and tasty.
* Milka Ei -- the little chocolate eggs that come with the spoon.  HUGE hits.
* Milka Snax.  To an American, they're basically chocolate-covered ""Bugles"".  Pure awesome.
* Super Dickman -- Because everyone has a juvenile sense of humor.

He lied to everyone when he put the wrong dates when these photos were taken, then he was saying vaguely that they are from 2000-2010 period. No, almost all of these disco photos were taken in 1999-2002, and some boring photos of ordinary village houses are from 2004. 

He released his book of photographs of Lithuanian village disco in 2008 after he got funded by kickstarter.

That happens when you screw up so hard they get out the torches and pitchforks.

If that's the criterium then it's *impossible* to improve the situation in Ukraine ever.

Of course... just like all of the other oligarchs like Yanukovich and friends. I still don't see how that is worse than Yanukovich at the helm.

That's one interpretation. From the leaked Nyland telephone conversation, I took away that Nyland was strongly for ""Yats"" (Yatsenyuk) to become PM, and didn't like the candidate the EU (and [especially Merkel](http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/4396401-klitschko-fighter-coached-merkel)) preferred, namely ""Klitsch"" (Klitschko). She was eager to get everybody on board to ""let that stick together, and you know, fuck the EU""      
    
The [Current Ukrainian Government](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yatsenyuk_Government) ended up with not one single representative from Klitschko's party, but does include the Svoboda far right.    
So we might as well blame Nylands tone-deafness for not realizing what she ""stuck together"" and what Svoboda actually represents, which gave ammunition to the Russian ""neo-fascist government"" spin.

Keiner hat sich den Vertrag zwischen Ukraine und Russland bzgl. der Krim-Schenkung durchgelesen, aber ALLES was Russland macht ist erstmal feindlich/bedrohlich usw.

Dabei [wissen die Reporter vom Spiegel](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/krim-ukraine-warum-putin-verloren-hat-der-kommentar-a-958597.html) genau, dass Russland der Verlierer ist und ein Traum alter Stärker oder Eurasischer-Union bereits unerreichbar.

Egal ob BILD,N24 oder SPIEGEL...alle treiben die selbe dumme Sau durchs Dorf: das böse Russland bedroht die armen Ukrainer. Und zu diesem Inhalt ist in den letzten vier Wochen nichts dazu gekommen...gar nichts.

Wo ist denn die Aufregung von Spiegel, Bundesregierung und denen die Pseudonachrichten so mögen gewesen, als in Venezuela alles aus dem Ruder lief. Was geht heute grad in Syrien? Wieviele Gelbhemden wurden gestern getötet?
Das ist natürlich alles viel zu weit weg vom Niveau der Uli Hoenesz Internetrichter und das-böse-Russland-Journalisten.

Männer machten außerdem unter sich öfter Geschäfte, die sich für beide Seiten lohnen. Gegenüber Frauen verhielten sie sich im Unterschied dazu in Verhandlungen eher unnachgiebig und kleinlich. Und schließlich, so stellt Ringqvist fest: „Männer sind besser als Frauen darin, einen guten Preis für ein und dasselbe Produkt zu bekommen.“

Ich fasse das halt immer sehr relativ auf, die Gründe kann man letztendlich nicht genau in Zahlen ausdrücken, sondern eher Tendenzen aussprechen.

That is enough for now, but they're fairly easy to follow on Western exchanges. Also, them being on Western exchanges makes them easier to trade. 

I'm *very* small time, but often taking a step back and looking at a situation can help you make sense of it. In 2009 I bought Citigroup and AIG. After Lehman collapsed, and we all saw what it did to the economy, I assumed the US government would not allow much larger financial institutions fail, so I bought some when they were cheap. Also in tough economies tourism stocks are often hurt. Also where there are macro level financial issues, such as those in Greece, often all stocks listed in that country are punished even if they have strong financials (for instance Greek shipping companies might be interesting to look into). 

That said, I dont really have much confidence in the Russian government. Even if many Russian companies have strong financials right now, it does not mean the Russian government wont shoot itself in the foot (as we have recently seen). Sanctions could cripple their businesses. The ex-Russian Finance Minister told Putin US and EU sanctions could cause $100 billion of foreign direct investment outflows *per quarter*. He is a Russian and Putin ally, so it cant be chalked up to inflated threats from the West. 

Not sure I'd want to own the stock of a company whos external markets are restricted, and internal markets are being destroyed.

Latvia has not ""stripped"" citizenship from Russians who refused to learn Latvian.

People who were ""imported"" by Soviet authorities did *not* receive automatic citizenship, as they were citizens of an illegitimate occupying power. So they had/have to pass a Latvian language test, learn the hymn, pass a history test, and swear allegiance to Latvia. Which hundreds of thousands have chosen not to do, even though 20 years is plenty to do that. You can learn that stuff in 6 months. A year, maybe.

I repeat - they were *not* ""stripped"" of their Latvian citizenship, they *didn't have it* in the first place - in legal terms, they are (former) citizens of the USSR, and non-citizens of Latvia.

The official reason was to ""test US supply chain distribution channels"". That might make sense if there was a new pipeline, but I think its fairly obvious it was a warning to Russia. 

Given Putin friend, and ex-Russian Finance Minister, said EU/US sanctions could cause $100 billion of foreign capital outflows every quarter, a collapse in oil and gas prices could cause a depression in the Russian economy. Russia's main export (by far) is energy. The Russian economy needs energy prices to remain at certain levels for it to keep functioning.

If on the other hand the EU had an explicit, clear foreign policy mandate, then it would be given the authority, competencies and tools required to act. If it failed to act, then it could justifiably be criticized.

However, as it is currently set up, the EU suffers from an internal sclerosis and a lack of direction. It sort of has a foreign policy mandate (i.e. has an External Action Service, has the High Rep, has the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), and has funds dedicated to foreign policy) yet it doesn't really have the political mandate and the member states don't have the political will to give the EU the ability to act properly on the global stage.

Es gibt de facto keine Frauenquote in Deutschland, es ist momentan ALLES auf freiwilliger Basis.

Also antworte ich, dass deine Thesen momentan nunmal nicht zutriffen. Is halt so.

Wenn in 20 Jahren immer noch keine Umstrukturierung vollzogen ist, ist mir jedes Geweine um angebliche mangelnde Qualifikation echt egal.

Dann kommt halt ne erzwungene Quote um den Damm zu brechen und man muss da ohne wenn und aber durch, bis die gesellschaft und Unternehmenskultur ein paar Jahrzehnte später angepasst und verändert wurde.

Kann doch nicht ewig so bleiben, dass alle hohen Managementposten zu 95% von Männern bestückt werden, wo sind wir denn hier??

Die Qualifikationsunterschiede sind dann eh nach ein paar Jahren passé und ~~vielleicht~~ wahrscheinlich kann die Quote sogar vollständig abgeschafft werden.

No, it doesn't. It's so so so so simple and tempting to think so. All you have to do is flip the bad guys and good guys in your head. It's actually quite harder to talk about geopolitical situations than this. 

Iraq: Government says to for self-determination and to prevent atrocities. Conspiracy theorists say oil. Complex shit is a combination of power projection, a culmination of an intra-party war, etc.

Libya: Government says to defend democratic rebels. Conspiracy theorists say gold dinar. Complex shit is American credibility, more power projection, Western influence, good old-fashioned revenge, etc.

Ukraine: Government says defending democracy and European aspirations. Conspiracy theorists say... I don't even know, that Russia is right? Complex shit says geopolitics, defending the border, containment, expansion, and yes, also defense of self-determination insofar it helps certain parties.

If your theory can be summarized in a few sentences, it's likely incorrect. It's nearly impossible to summarize these things, because you'd be leaving behind context, and you can't understand these things without context.

Somebody linked in how RT reported on yesterday's events in Donetsk .. unsurprisingly, they manage to [pin the blame](http://rt.com/news/ukraine-protest-donetsk-dead-674/) on Ukrainian nationalist provocators:

&gt;According to local media reports pro-Maidan activists started provoking the pro-Russian crowd, by shouting far-right slogans “Glory to Ukraine” and “Glory to heroes”, loudly demanding the respect of Ukrainian territorial sovereignty.

When describing the actual violence, they studiously avoid specifying *who* broke through the police cordons and *who* got injured:

&gt;Clashes between the rival rallies reportedly erupted after a crowd of demonstrators broke through a police cordon separating the crowds. Law enforcers were trying to take provocateurs away in police buses.
&gt;
&gt;It was not immediately clear, how many people were injured from both sides of the clashes, but reports indicated that some had their faces bloodied in the fight.

A pro-Russian activist is given ample space to blame Ukrainian nationalists:

&gt;The pro-Maidan crowd had asked the “ultra-nationalists” from a local pro-Ukrainian football club to join their rally, and to bring weapons with them, including baseball bats, an activist from Donetsk, Sergey Tsiplakov told RT.
&gt;
&gt;“Today we have witnessed a planned provocation, when the pro-Russian crowd was basically provoked to harsh measures,” Tsiplakov claims.
&gt;
&gt;Thursday clashes were, Tsiplakov says initially started by the pro-Maidan protesters who had to show their strength to the OSCE observer mission.

He gets to go on for a further five (!) paragraphs, making accusations about how pro-Ukrainian demonstrators are paid, how the Ukrainian government is ""constantly provoking the increase of tensions in the Donbas region"" by ""directly insulting"" the pro-Russian population, and how it has ""simply “armed” and offered government positions to ultra-nationalist “fighters”.

Then the wife of Pavel Gubarev gets a paragraph to say how ""there is indeed strong support for Russia in Donetsk"", and there are two more paragraphs about Pavel Gubarev, and that's it.

I'll quote the relevant part: *""The European Parliament (...) is concerned about the rising nationalistic sentiment in Ukraine, expressed in support for the Svoboda Party, which, as a result, is one of the two new parties to enter the Verkhovna Rada; [and the European Parliament] recalls that racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic views go against the EU's fundamental values and principles and therefore appeals to pro-democratic parties in the Verkhovna Rada not to associate with, endorse or form coalitions with this party.""*

Exactly these people are in the illegal government now. One of them even has authority over the Ukraïnian army and secret service. Of course, the European Parliament conveniently changed its mind.

But really, you can take any part of the article and you'll hit some crazy. Another example? All right.

&gt; Fascism rests on mob rule, not laws.

And I know what you're thinking. Too bad the article's writer also knew, so he quickly added:

Tra il 22 ed il 25 maggio, in tutta l'Unione Europea, si terranno le elezioni dei membri del Parlamento Europeo. Ogni stato ha una certa libertà per scegliere il giorno del voto, in un range di date decise, se non erro, dal Consiglio Europeo.

Saranno eletti 751 membri del Parlamento Europeo. L'Italia elegge 73 membri.

Ogni paese ha la propria legge elettorale in merito (te pareva). L'Italia è divisa in 5 circoscrizioni (nord-occidentale, nord-orientale, centrale, meridionale, insulare). La ripartizione dei seggi è fatta seguendo l'ultimo censimento. Il sistema è proporzionale, con preferenze, soglia di sbarramento al 4%. I candidati devono avere 25 anni.

http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legge_elettorale_italiana_per_il_Parlamento_europeo

A livello europeo ci sono dei ""grandi partiti"", nei quali confluiscono i partiti dei vari Stati. Ad esempio c'è il Partito Socialista Europeo, del quale fa parte il Partito Democratico italiano.

Se non sai chi votare, prova questo interessante quiz http://www.myvote2014.eu/it/home/indice

In Italia sono spesso poco considerate (un esempio: nessuno sa che Gianni Pittella è primo vicepresidente del Parlamento Europeo), ma in realtà il Parlamento Europeo lavora, negli altri stati europei i cittadini sono più interessati.

Il Paese è tenuto ad essere rappresentato al Parlamento Europeo, ed io vorrei che fosse rappresentato da buoni politici e non da gente come Salvini (per fare un esempio).

Oh, and we didn't try to sabotage it via Sweden, as Sweden had it's own legitimate security concerns, contending that the pipeline would motivate a Russian navy presence in the Swedish economic zone and could potentially use it for military intelligence. This was backed up by the fact that [Putin said that the ecological safety of the pipeline project will be ensured by using the Baltic Fleet of the Russian Navy](http://www.redorbit.com/news/business/707474/russian_navy_to_ensure_nord_stream_ecology__putin/index.html/) and that [the fibre optic cable and repeater stations along the pipeline could theoretically be used for espionage.](http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/schroeders-pipeline-spionagekanal-in-der-ostsee-611094.html)

Not to mention the fact that this [isolates Poland, Ukraine and other Eastern European countries *(Slovakia, Czech Republic, Belarus)* from Western Europe](http://s3.amazonaws.com/thf_media/2006/pdf/bg1980.pdf). So now if Russia wants to cut off the flow to any of them, they don't have to cut off gas to the rest of Western Europe. As I mentioned above, this [isolates these countries economically from the rest of Europe, and in member-state situations, the rest of the European Union and NATO.](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2679905,00.html)

But I mean....[thank god Russia has never used Gazprom as a political weapon before](http://www.fni.no/doc&amp;pdf/FNI-R1508.pdf).....

Like I said: **Brilliant move.**

Settimane antecedenti il voto sono stracarico- mamma mia abbiamo fatto le primarie, che primarie ganze, bel confronto fra candidati su Sky, Bersani mi piaceva, era poco carismatico ma indubbiamente una brava persona. Berlusconi pareva nella merda più totale, questa era vinta, forse per la prima volta da quando ci capivo qualcosa di politica avremmo avuto un governo di sinistra.

Dalla radio però arrivano notizie sempre più sconfortanti.

&gt;Russia’s respected former finance minister has delivered a stark warning that the country could soon face capital outflows as high as $50bn a quarter and no economic growth, should western countries press forward with proposed sanctions against Moscow...He cautioned that Russian banks could soon be banned from doing any transactions with US or EU lenders, a move that he said would drive additional capital outflows of up to $50bn. [Source](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/5d5a9cbe-aad0-11e3-83a2-00144feab7de,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F5d5a9cbe-aad0-11e3-83a2-00144feab7de.html%3Fsiteedition%3Dintl&amp;siteedition=intl&amp;_i_referer=#axzz2vy8hTfjl) (I hit my maxium monthly articles, so hope the last link works. The title is *Putin Ally Warns on Cost of Sanctions* by the Financial Times)

The former Russian Finance Minister has calculated that just the first $50 billion would cause Russia growth be zero. Excluding Russian banks would almost certainly cause a recession. If the US chose to also drive down the price of energy it could be disastrous for the Russian economy (not to mention it would *strongly* encourage them to keep supplies to Europe constant given a complete collapse of their economy could result if they stopped). 

Given Russians have been used to fairly rapid growth for well over a decade I cant imagine they'd be too happy about a regression in their standard of living. Think of it as Greece on steroids.

The particular strength of the US in this case is that of NATO, i.e. it has a very big sabre to rattle.  This is likely sufficient to prevent Russia from invading eastern Ukraine (I hope). It is also now likely that there will be some sort of NATO-linked ""advance radar"" installations in the Ukraine once the dust begins to settle.

It is then that the EU's soft power (and cash) will be used to shore-up pro-western economic policies.  Should Crimea remain ""independent"", i.e. not become a province of Russia, there might be another opportunity at some point ot exert soft power.

And CDMA carriers are still notorious about not registering ESNs unless you get a sympathetic store clerk.  GSM was developed in concert by european carriers to prevent precisely that - to this day no operator outside of Japan blocks IMEIs.

You can use any european GSM phone over there NOW, but in the early days of both GSM and UMTS (and today on LTE), the frequencies aren't standardized so your phone just might not work. The EU standardized on 850 / 1900 MHz for GSM and 2100 for UMTS. If European regulators hadn't standardized on those frequencies, we'd have 10 different frequencies in Europe depending on what each country or each operator in each country could get. The US has it easy since you have one FCC (who we can thank for 2.4 GHz).

edit: lots, and also,

Crap, T-Mobile had FOR AGES useless 3G frequencies in 1700 MHz which worked with maybe 4 phones ever, until they refarmed their GSM 1900 frequencies into 4G, which only happened once the EU approved the same practice (which is what sparked manufacturers to put UMTS1900 into phones).

This is exemplified by the fact that the 2008 Financial Crisis brought the entire developed world *(including Russia)* into a recession, and caught the growth of developing countries *(I.E. China)* in half, if it didn't drag them into recession as well. 

In 2009. Russia had -7.8% compared to America's -3.1%. 

Compare this to the EuroCrisis, which despite plunging the entire European Union into a double-dip recession *(which it only exited last August)*, neither Russia nor the United States were forced into a double-dip recession because of it. 

Yes, the European Union is *extremely powerful* when it comes to soft power, but don't for a second think the United States isn't or is insignificant in the regard. 

Also decisive use of soft power would've been targeting the Ukrainian government and the Ukranian/Russian oligarchs supporting  Yanukovych during the Crisis. But instead, it didn't, it showed hesitation, inaction and unwillingness, which in my opinion, showed weakness, which gave Russia, in my opinion, the confidence needed to invade Ukraine and seize Crimea.

Could this crisis have been averted by a more judicious use of soft power?  Almost certainly so.  Unfortunately I am not knowledgeable enough of the details of what really went on to know what opportunities were missed, and what the real alternatives were. Given what transpired, it seems unlikely that EU or US soft power would have swayed Yanukovych much, except for one thing.

Why not just make it part of infrastructure? Doesn't have to be Ethernet, thats just an example, since you got these things everywhere.
