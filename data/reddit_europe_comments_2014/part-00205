That is easier said than done. Russia's largest sector is energy, and that is largely what has been targeted. Many of these energy companies are owned by oligarchs, and they are also the largest portion of the Kremlin's income. But they employ regular Russians. There is no doubt regular Russian's are going to be hurt by this as well. It is almost impossible to only hurt politicians. 

I would also like to point out, Russia's politicians are on track to hurt Russian civilians far more than Western sanctions ever could. All of those shitty politicians have their wealth held it commodities, securities, real estate, and dollars or euros. That is not the case for regular Russians. Their wealth is held in Rubles, and they have no choice in the matter. 

Russia's policies have caused capital flight the likes Russia has never seen. As of now, this has not translated into that steep of a drop for the USD/RUB pair, but that is because Russia's central bank is aggressively propping up the Ruble. Russia's central banker said if foreign capital flight is not stopped the stability of the Ruble will be in jeopardy. (And I have not even touched on the damage capital flight does to the overall economy, currency issues aside).

When Western companies are wary of Russia's future actions, the last thing they want to hear is Russia threaten to nationalize ExxonMobil's stake in the country. Nationalization threats, invading Crimea, causing unrest in Eastern Ukraine, and providing weapons that were used to down a civilian airliner only greatly accelerate foreign capital flight, which in turn hurts the Ruble's purchasing power, which in turn hurts every Russian. The reduced economic growth due to capital flight is the next punch to the gut.

The US increased sanctions yesterday which seriously hit Russia's energy sector. The US put off implementing new sanctions because it wanted EU support, but it finally went it alone. Hopefully this airliner is not something the EU can continue to ignore. The US sanctions implemented yesterday had a very clear impact on Russia's energy sector (energy stocks down 6.5-8%). If the EU follows suit, it could really pressure the Kremlin to evaluate its actions.

Jet fuel is just not that flammable. It's similar to diesel: it can definitely catch fire, but to *explode* it needs to be in a fine mist, thoroughly mixed with air. A surface-to-air missile typically has a proximity fuze and showers its target with hot shrapnel, shredding it to pieces, but a 777 is a *big* target. Normally, the missile will have heavily damaged the plane, possibly tearing off at least one of the wings and igniting the fuel in the wing tanks.

true,Mrs_ThinkTank_Fairy,FRAN,France,"&gt; In some sense Bush when it comes to foreign policy and security. 

No. Absolutely wrong.

From her new memoir:

&gt; I approached my work with confidence in our country’s enduring strengths and purpose, and humility about how much remains beyond our knowledge and control. I worked to **reorient American foreign policy around what I call “smart power.”** To succeed in the 21st century, we need to integrate the traditional tools of foreign policy—diplomacy, development assistance, and military force—while also tapping the energy and ideas of the private sector and empowering citizens, especially the activists, organizers, and problem solvers we call civil society, to meet their own challenges and shape their own futures. We have to use all of America’s strengths to build a world with **more partners and fewer adversaries, more shared responsibility and fewer conflicts, more good jobs and less poverty, more broadly based prosperity with less damage to our environment.**

Here she states that she wants to get Americans to think globally:

&gt; how leaders and nations can work together and why they sometimes collide, and how their decisions affect all our lives: How a collapsing economy in Athens, Greece, affects businesses in Athens, Georgia. How a revolution in Cairo, Egypt, impacts life in Cairo, Illinois. What a tense diplomatic encounter in St. Petersburg, Russia, means for families in St. Petersburg, Florida

Idk man, I think your expectations are too high. This world is fucking crazy.

Edit: moar from memoir

After she spends a few paragraphs talking about how she aspires to walk in George Marshall's footsteps (aka Marshall Plan, use American power to strengthen allies) she says this:

&gt; Foreign policy experts often refer to the system of institutions, alliances, and norms built up after World War II as “architecture.” We still needed a rules-based global order that could manage interactions between states, protect fundamental freedoms, and mobilize common action. But it would have to be more flexible and inclusive than before. I came to liken the old architecture to the Parthenon in Greece, with clean lines and clear rules. The pillars holding it up—a handful of big institutions, alliances, and treaties—were remarkably sturdy. But time takes its toll, even on the greatest of edifices, and now we needed a new architecture for a new world, more in the spirit of Frank Gehry than formal Greek classicism. Where once a few strong columns could hold up the weight of the world, now a dynamic mix of materials, shapes, and structures was needed

^ here she states how much she values global cooperation based on rules and how interaction between states must be more constructive aka **shes in favor of a more multipolar world**

I think it is not so simple. I think the main charge against the ECHR is that it wants to protect the innocent so hard that it overdoes it and ends up protecting the guilty too much. 

I mean of course it depens on your philosophy. If you think in the modern world innocent people could easily get harassed by governments, the ECHR is absolutely necessary. I mean if you have this paranoid view that our governments are our enemies, you need the ECHR. 

But if you think in the modern world innocent people are fairly safe from governments, and rather we should be protecting criminals less and be tougher on them, then you will find the ECHR too rigid.

""Man tends to regard the order he lives in as natural. The houses he passes on his way to work seem more like rocks rising out of the earth than like products of human hands. He considers the work he does in his office or factory as essential to the harmonious functioning of the world. The clothes he wears are exactly what they should be, and he laughs at the idea that he might equally well be wearing a Roman toga or medieval armor. He respects and envies a minister of state or a bank director, and regards the possession of a considerable amount of money as the main guarantee of peace and security. He cannot believe that one day a rider may appear on a street he knows well, where cats sleep and children play, and start catching passers-by with his lasso. He is accustomed to satisfying those of his physiological needs which are considered private as discreetly as possible, without realizing that such a pattern of behavior is not common to all human societies.

Se fai la comparazione 
Allegri sta a prandelli come Lippi sta a Conte.

Non dico che sono comparabili per curriculum, ma per modo di fare.

Mentre i primi due sono molto pacati ed ""aziendalisti"" per dirla come /u/Kit_Emmuorto , gli ultimi due sono molto più carismatici, stronzi e pretendono dalla squadra.


Ora tornando a Conte:
Conte in nazionale è una buona idea (non so se ottima, o se la migliore, perchè al migliore c'è sempre qualcosa di ancora meglio), ma di sicuro lo stimolerebbe a fare tanto.
Come già detto, Conte è andato via per via dei dissidi sui costi della sua lista desideri dei calciatori (voleva fare trio Sanchez - Di Maria - Quadrado del valore di oltre 100 milioni di euro, cifra che la società Juventus non avrebbe mai speso).

In nazionale però, le cose funzionano in maniera differente. 
Non c'è il ""compro questo giocatore, quella società rilancia perchè vuole di più etc."", ma ti limiti ad ingaggiare giocatori della stessa nazionalità. Quindi credo che il problema massimo sia limitato al ""quanto vuole di ingaggio il giocatore?"".

E qui conte potrebbe pescare a piene mani tutti i giocatori italiani che più lo compiacciono.
Avrebbe ben pochi limiti di spese, imho. Poi ovviamente dipende tutto dalla FIGC, ma speriamo che il 14 Agosto ci sia una ventata di rinnovamento ed apertura anche verso la nazionale.

true,Elukka,null,null,"&gt;c) Turns out that Ukrainians destroyed the plane. Russians will probably use that to further present themselves as good liberators and Ukrainians as evil nazis.

This is unlikely but the pro-Russian shills and tinfoils will never accept anything else unless Putin himself admits it was the rebels. 

1) It's rather unlikely that the Ukrainians would have positioned a valuable and fragile Buk complex in the middle of DNR. 

2) The Ukrainians would've used the Kupol radar component of the complex and they would've identified a passenger plane's ADS-B transponder, seen that the plane was flying at 33000 feet and at a typical cruising velocity. Professionals with the right tools would have not confused an AN-26 with a 777. (Rebels were celebrating the shooting down of an AN-26 just moments ago before they apparently realized they shot down MH17. At this point these are rumors and conjectures of course.)

3) There are fragments of unverified data that a largish missile was fired from the rebel controlled zone around the time of the crash. 

4) Pictures, videos, tweets and intercepted phone calls from civilians and rebels all point towards that it was the rebels. Unverified at this point again but looks damning. 

5) The rebels have only shown pictures of the TELAR component of the BUK complex which means it's perfectly possible they saw a target on its small simple radar screen, misinterpreted it and fired away. The TELAR is autonomous but has very limited radar capabilities.

6) The Ukrainian don't seem to have had working air defense in the LNR and DNR. Their radars were destroyed long ago (June?) and rebels ransacked their air defense bases apparently carrying off some Buks among other things. The Ukrainians haven't (apparently) focused on air defense during this crisis because so far the rebels haven't had any real air power to speak of and Russian AF has stayed away from  Ukrainian airspace. Have the Ukrainians ever shot down anything more than a handful of drones during this conflict? 

I think the most likely explanation by a wide margin is that the rebels shot down the plane fueled by incompetence and zeal but the Russian government had nothing to do with it directly. 

As a sidenote RT has already spewed tinfoil hat conspiracy theories about the Ukrainians trying to assassinate Putin while he flew over Ukraine at about the same time as MH17 and accidentally hitting MH17 instead. Typical Russian tactics: deny, deflect and try to spin the subject of matter in their own favor. ""They shouldn't have flow in a war zone"", ""This could have all been avoided if the Ukrainians hadn't renewed their hostilities"", ""What about Iran Air flight 655!?"" seem to be a pretty common line of arguments among pro-Moscow people both officials and civilians.

No. It can't. It contradicts very fundamental ideas of the movement which was, lest we forget, proto-feminist. You can read the critique of the family in Engels' origins of the family, private property and the state exactly along those grounds, that within it women are commodified, which in their opinion is expressed most clearly in prostitution (they explicitly stated that in their opinion prostitution is the socialization of women).

Any interpretation according to which parts of the population should be ""communitized"" as if they were objects is a fundamentally wrong interpretation that can not be supported in good faith. The entire point of the project was that the current mode of production transforms people (workers and capitalists) into objects with instrumental utility in expanding and circulating capital.

Ich weiß es nicht ob die entführt wurden. Tot sind die Jugendlichen. Das weiß man. Was du mit ""zu erst"" meinst verstehe ich nicht. Also vor dem Tod der Jugendlichen haben sich Palestinenser und Israelis noch nie gesehen? Die Hamas die sich sonst zu jedem Scheiss bekennt, hat die Verantwortung jedenfalls nicht übernommen.

Oder man ist dann so krass und sagt: immer wenn ein Verbrechen geschieht, an dem ein Palestinenser beteiligt ist, dann ist immer auch die Hamas schuld.
Sollte das Level erreicht sein, also die 100%ige Vorverurteilung, dann hätte die Hamas ja grundsätzlich Recht in ihrem Handeln, da es faschistisch ist einer Gruppe grundsätzlich zu unterstellen schlechte Menschen zu sein. Und ich bin fest überzeugt das die vielen toten Kinder auf Fussballplätzen in Palestina nicht schuld sind.
Dann ist Selbstverteidigung der einzige Frieden für Palestina und ich kann nachvollziehen, wenn die Hamas eine Waffenruhe ablehnt.
Es würde das Elend nur verlängern.
Dann soll Isreal einen endgültigen Vernichtungskrieg im Gazastreifen führen, wie es von den ultraortodoxden Juden häufig kolportiert wird. 

Wenn Kinder von ihren Eltern geschlagen werden, tendieren sie später als Erwachsene auch überdurchschnittlich oft zu Gewalt gegenüber den eigenen Kindern. Und die Juden wurden bevor es einen Staat gab ja von den Deutschen geschlagen. Also sind wir der Grund, warum Israel keinen klugen Ansatz hat Frieden zu finden.

The name Flemish is already used by another dialect family which is found only in the old county of Flanders regions, the family of West-Flemish, East-Flemish (from the Western East-Flanders, Sint-Niklaas and Aalst are Brabantian), Ghent dialect, ...

For example West-Flemish and the Ghent dialect both have subjugations for yes (Joak, joaj, joat, ...), typical for Flemish dialects. 

Brussels being the capital of Flanders can't be really taken seriously anyway. But making Antwerp the capital would be a slap in the face of old Flanders. At that point you can rename Flanders to greater Brabant.

In my opinion Ghent should be capital as it is still pretty central, it's an old Flemish city (ex-seat of the count even), it has both West-Flemish and Brabantian influences and it has a lot of old Flemish medieval buildings. It would suck for traffic though.

There was Prussian border there at the time, and to skip the toll he hidden the soap in (supposedly) hermetic chests and pulled the chests behind the ship under the water.

Money supply is more to do with the reserve ratio. 

The ECB remit is to keep inflation at 2%. This is the same historic rate of increase as gold. The euro is a hard currency based on the German philosophy of a currency as 'public good' and must hold value. It was very similar to a gold standard. 

In fact that was a large part of the problem, as there was no mechanism to adjust fluctuation in output values as would happen with national fiat currencies. The last introduction of a gold standard started the Long Depression which lasted 23 years. And Sweden was the first country to leave the great depression because they were the first to come of the gold standard. Weaker countries who peg with solid stronger currency usually do disastrously. See Argentina 2001, Greece. The eurozone crisis had nothing to do with it not being a gold backed currency. 

Money isn't wealth, whether gold or fiat, It's a representation of wealth. Increase in money supply isn't bad, as long as it isn't too much, and that the money lent was used in fund real productive.

Well, you might argue that the Court preventing the state from stripping a criminal of a right endangers other people but that is a very roundabout and flimsy justification for me.

true,DocTomoe,BAWU,Württemberger,"&gt; Ich habe die Liste nur kurz überflogen, finde aber keines das über Kriegs/Krisengebieten abgestürzt.

Hatte die Anfrage interpretiert als ""Flugzeuge, die in Europa vom Himmel fallen"", nicht ""... die in Europa über Kriegsgebieten vom Himmel fallen"" - angesichts der sehr wenigen Kriegsgebiete wäre das auch ein reiner Glückstreffer...

Nach der Argumentation müssten Kriegsgebiete - abgesehen von Abschüssen - die sichersten Fluggebiete überhaupt sein. Tatsächlich wäre die Formel wohl:

W = Flugunfälle/Flüge * Flugzeuge über Krisengebiet/Flugzeuge in der Luft

Man sieht: die ohnehin geringe Wahrscheinlichkeit für einen Flugunfall wird durch die geringe Anzahl der Flugbewegungen über Krisengebieten (bei gleichzeitig vielen Flugbewegungen, insbesondere über Europa) nochmal ganz erheblich abgesenkt. Null wird sie aber nur, wenn es gar keine Unfälle gäbe - und/oder gar keine Flugbewegungen über Krisengebieten.

[Die hier](http://www.flugzeug-absturz.de/allgemein/wahrscheinlichkeit-eines-flugzeugabsturzes.html) gehen von 4 Abstürzen pro Jahr - bei 550.000.000 Flügen mit Verkehrsmaschinen - aus. Wie belastbar das Zahlenmaterial ist, weiß ich natürlich nicht... wir haben also

W_Absturz = 4/550000000 

Laut [dieser Auflistung](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts) gibt es, größere militärische Konflikte in ca. [8.469*10^6 km^2](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum+area+of+afghanistan%2C+somalia%2C+nigeria%2C+pakistan%2C+mexico%2C+egypt%2C+syria%2C+iraq%2C+central+african+republic%2C+south+sudan%2C+ukraine). Das entspricht etwa 1,67% der Erdoberfläche - und bei einer hypothetischen Gleichverteilung der Flugzeuge in der Luft (die aber so faktisch nie eintritt, weil Krisengebiete in der Regel vermieden werden, und Flugstraßen existieren) von 

W_FlugKrisengebiet = 166/10000

Also ist W_AbsturzKrisengebiet = 4/550000000 * 166/10000 ≅1.207*10^-12. Aber eben nicht null.

Russia is hilarious. It moved closer to the west since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even banning the death penalty in 1996 as it cooperated with the European Court of Human Rights. 

The election of Obama was a renew of promise that the US would shift away from the Bush - only for him to backtrack on every promise he made. The promise of Gitmo was cemented as only shifting the prisoners to another prison because of the PR disaster Gitmo had become. When people say ""obama backtracked on everything he said he would"" it's not republican propaganda - he's imprisoned more whistleblowers than the rest of the US presidents combined. He expanded the drone wars and his attempt at financial regulation was undone within a year. 

In recent years they ran circles round the americans in foreign policy making them look like idiots beating their war drums over Syria and Iraq. Pretty much shifted everyones perspectives that both the US and russia are shits that care little for anyone outside their borders of the chess board they perceive the world.

Ukraine and Crimea though couldn't be more of a shot in the foot. It's moved countries like Germany and Finland back into the arms of the US which is now being perceived as the lesser evil by far.

I mean even look at the worldcup. [When the Americans started chanting U-S-A the Germans countered with N-S-A! N-S-A!](http://blogs.reuters.com/ian-bremmer/2014/07/17/world-cup-chants-reveal-true-state-of-u-s-german-relations/) 

Spiegel recently released an article titled  [Germany's Choice: Will It Be America or Russia?](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/as-us-scandals-grow-germans-seek-greater-political-independence-a-979695.html) and only yesterday /r/germany was having a discussion on America/Russia and how the post 9/11 incarnation of the US was only little better than the post 1991 Russia. I'd have estimated if russia had continued to be peaceful in the face of US invasions of the ME within 5 years perception would've shifted to the rest of the populace in the west that Russia was the lesser evil of the 2 (which I still believe - given the civilian death in the ME versus the civilian death Russia has caused in the last decade).

Then the russians or separtists with russian equipment (makes no difference really) down a civilian air liner. 

If Russia had concluded the Ukraine crisis reasonably peacefully and kept to itself in the coming years you would've seen the west question their American alliance like prominent figures in Australia and Germany have been. 

Instead it looks like we're in for a solidified and renewed life breathed into NATO and more of the same drone wars, detentions, illegal renditions and american hegemony with Europe a willing participant. In one fell swoop the Russians have killed any crediblity as an alternative the Americans. I would've preferred (given Europes geological location) to have solidified the EU with further federalism and to play the russians and Americans off each other. 

When Mr. Prokhanov made the below statement I seriously don't think he meant it under the context of what the new cold war will now be.

You are so righteous now... your people didn't give a fuck when Dutch soldiers just let the Serbs massacre 7000 Muslims in Srebrenica without a fight (well years later it was brought up and a government resigned 7 years later, but back in 1995 it wasn't even reported widely.
Also Westerners are very ignorant about this conflict (just as they were about the Yugoslav wars) and they want to see it as simple ""good guys vs. bad guys"" scenario. It's a lot more complicated than that. Yeah, Russia does support the rebels, many of them being from Russia themselves, but the Ukrainians aren't angels either. They co-opted extreme nationalists who are quite fascist-like, they shell residential areas, their thugs go around in balaclavas terrorizing civilians, they want to round up the entire male population of rebellious areas to ""filtration camps"". They don't behave much better than the Russians themselves did in Chechnya. Also the Ukrainian army is a joke for an army, many of its soldiers are not really motivated to fight, so the Kiev government must rely on nationalist thugs organized into ""special battalions"" and the ""national guard"". The glorious democratic pro-EU president of Ukraine is an oligarch. Of course Putin and the Russian-backed rebels aren't the ""good guys"" either.
Also you must be aware that the Crimea and the Donbas weren't ever really ""Ukrainian"" historically. They were just given to the Ukrainian SSR back then. The majority of the population is Russian-speaking and many of them consider themselves Russian (in the Crimea they would have probably won a fair referendum too, in Eastern Ukraine it's not that clear cut).
I believe the West was wrong when it helped to foment a revolution in Ukraine that just lead to the destablization of the country.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; good post. I can see the 1%GDP being politically difficult as the total EU budget being about 1% GDP, and that was cut in recent years.

The European Commission in the 1970s took a team of economists and had them research what's the best way for economic integration to continue in the EU. The team authored [the MacDougall report](http://ec.europa.eu/archives/emu_history/documentation/chapter8/19770401en73macdougallrepvol1.pdf) which took a look at existing federations and tried to draw conclusions about what was necessary and what wasn't. 

The article I linked to mentions the main conclusion of that report in passing: ""The MacDougall report of 1977 estimated that a monetary union between EEC Member States would need a shared budget to the tune of 5 or 7% of Community GDP in order to function well."" The report suggested that this kind of common spending was the minimum needed to be achieved *before* starting the monetary union. As you said, the current budget is less than 1%. 

&gt; I am unsure if 1% is anywhere near enough. The Baltic 'recovery' required mass emigration and circa 20% of government spending coming from the EU. 

I am assuming that an unemployment scheme costing 1% of the total Eurozone or EU GDP would perhaps, in the short term, be enough to help stop the current crisis in its tracks. In the medium term, the currency union is still incomplete without a surplus recycling mechanism to the tune of 5-10% of GDP.

&gt;The __Third Wave of Coffee__ refers to a current movement to produce high-quality [coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee), and consider coffee as an artisanal foodstuff, like [wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine), rather than a commodity. This involves improvements at all stages of production, from improving coffee plant growing, harvesting, and processing, to stronger relationships between coffee growers, traders, and roasters, to higher quality and fresh roasting, at times called ""microroasting"" (by analogy with [microbrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbrew) beer), to skilled brewing.

&gt;Third Wave Coffee aspires to the highest form of culinary appreciation of coffee, so that one may appreciate subtleties of flavor, varietal, and growing region – similar to other complex culinary products such as wine, tea, and chocolate. Distinctive features of Third Wave Coffee include [direct trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_trade) coffee, high-quality beans (see [specialty coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_coffee) for scale), [single-origin coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-origin_coffee) (as opposed to blends), lighter roasts, and [latte art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte_art). It also includes revivals of alternative methods of [coffee preparation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_preparation), such as [vacuum coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_coffee_maker) and pour-over brewing devices such as the [Chemex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemex) and Hario V60.

&gt;The term ""Third Wave"" was coined in 2002, and refers chiefly to the American phenomenon, particularly from the 1990s and continuing today, but with some roots in the 1980s, 1970s, and 1960s. Similar movements exist in [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia), [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand), and [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia). More broadly, Third Wave Coffee can be seen as part of the [specialty coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialty_coffee) movement.

No, ed é già dimostrato dal fatto che su questa nomina si stiano scannando. Se chi prende il ruolo avrà intenzione di prendersi tutta l'autonomia data dal Trattato, gli Stati saranno costretti, su sua iniziativa, a sedersi al tavolo delle negoziazioni quando l' HRVP vuole. Sembra poco, ma seguimi.

Il solo fatto di doverti sedere a negoziare, ti indebolisce. Sei costretto a scoprire le carte, anche se poco. Quel poco é abbastanza per dare info ai tuoi co-negoziatori. Quelle info finiscono sempre per tradursi in un compromesso, perché in Europa gli interessi non sono mai diametralmente opposti, ma moderatamente divergenti.

A forza di compromessi, si poggiano le basi per lapolitica estera comune, e per il principio di path dependency, non si torna più indietro. E si sottolinei questo: nella storia dell'integrazione europea, di passi indietro non se ne sono mai fatti.

Mr A deposits 100 gold dollar coins in banking system. In economics this is called M1. Reserve at 10% Res. 1 is 10 coins. 90 coins loaned out to mister B he spends them with Mr C to build a barn. The 90c are spent and Mr C redeposits them in the banks.

The bank has $90 'new' gold coin,**they really are the coins that they lent out, but the bank has $190 deposits because it owes Mr A 100coin and Mrs. C 90coin.**
 Res. 1 cannot be touched, however the 'new' deposit from Mrs C can be re-lent. 

10% reserve means  Res 2: $9c is kept and 81 physical coins are loaded to Mr D, spent with, and deposited by Mrs E, there is now  $271 deposit. as Mr A, Mrs C and Mr E are owed money.

There are $72.90 'new' gold deposits in the bank, Res 3 is 10% of this $7.29c reserve, and $65.61c lend and redeposited; each new reserve (3) cant be touched. That 65.61 is lent to Mr F is spent and is deposited by Mrs G.

 total deposits are now $343.90 as Mr A, Mrs C, Mr E, and Mrs G. are all owed money despite the same 100 physical gold coins being involved in the transactions. Mr B. Mr D. and Mr F. old 343 + interest to the bank. 

the process continues.

$100 at 10% will finish after 70 turns with $9,990 in circulation (M2 =10 times M1)
$100 at 5% finish after 133 turns at $1,998 in circulation (M2 =20 times M2)

true,mirstamina,NETH,The Netherlands,"The Dutch did not forget Srebrenica, it is, together with what we did in Indonesia after the second world war, one of the blackest pages in Dutch history. The Dutchbat soldiers asked for help of the airforce repeatedly, but were denied again and again. When the air support finally came, they were too late. What happened under Dutch command was wrong and lead to horrible atrocities, but it is not forgotten. There is a documentary and a few news items on Srebrenica every single year on one of the public channels at a time a lot of people watch tv. For comparison, 9-11 isn't mentioned every year (that is on the main public channel, I suppose it is generally mentioned somewhere in the media), though it is more recent and also had a lot of casualties. The Dutch politicians that resigned did so after a 6600 pages report on Srebrenica came out, they resigned as a result of that report. Saying the Dutch don't give a fuck is ignorant and simply wrong.          
War is not black and white, and everyone knows that, but the Dutch are grieving at the loss of their countrymen and so many others. Ukraine is obviously devided, but what polls I saw generally indicated that the people of Luhansk and Donetsk didn't want independence. I don't know how accurate those polls were, but if they had wanted any semblance of legitimacy, they should have waited for international observers to monitor the polls.        
The Ukrainian government is of course not the best ever (here's to understatements!) but to me, they are better than the alternative (like Yanukovich, but more pro-Russian). The decision for the Dutch at this point however hardly even involves the Ukrainian government. The rage needs to be channeled, and I don't expect the  perpetrators to be caught without the fall of Donetsk, so I would support my government taking most of the possible measures, militarily or otherwise. Of course cooler heads will prevail, but I hope our government will take extra measures, which will probably be in the form of sanctions.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Censorship_in_the_United_Kingdom. 

I looked at your links, but they showed examples of sites that were blocked because of child pornography or copywright issues. Presumably your country also has legislation in relation to this too, and some websites are blocked under that legislation? I didn't see any examples of specific websites that I didn't think should be blocked, but do let me know if you can see any. This is really what I am asking for. A specific site that is blocked by the UK firewall, that you can access in your country, that I can't access, that isn't due to some kind of technical legal process like copywright or some kind of criminal activity like child pornography. I think my question is a fair one: what can you access that I, behind the firewall, can't access?

&gt; But my personal favourite is the Tori party deleting old internet freedom speeches from their website and archive.org, while this is not ""forced upon"" censorship like blocking sites, it is censorship and it gives you insight into the mindset of the people developing and pushing these programs.

I agree that it is somewhat shabby of the Conservative Party to delete from its website some of its history. However, everyone who has a wesbite, including the company I work for and my running club, sometimes deletes content. This isn't really what censorship means. The underlying material can still be accessed, just not from the Conservative Party website.

&gt; There are tons of other articles about U.K. internet censorship, just google. 

Yes, but many of them seem to relate to the voluntary code of conduct in which ISPs ask consumers whether or not those consumers want certain websites to be blocked.

&gt;Io non ho nulla contro il calcio. Non vado negli stadi per la stessa ragione per cui non andrei a dormire di notte nei sotterranei della Stazione Centrale di Milano (o a passeggiare per Central Park a New York dopo le sei del pomeriggio), ma se mi capita mi guardo una bella partita con interesse e piacere alla televisione, perché riconosco e apprezzo tutti i meriti di questo nobile gioco. Io non odio il calcio. Io odio gli appassionati di calcio.

&gt;Ma non vorrei essere frainteso. Io nutro verso i tifosi gli stessi sentimenti che la Lega Lombarda nutre verso gli extracomunitari: “Non sono razzista, purché se ne stiano a casa loro.” E per casa loro intendo i luoghi dove amano riunirsi durante la settimana (bar, famiglia, club) e gli stadi, dove non mi interessa quanto avviene, e tanto meglio se arrivano quelli di Liverpool, che poi mi diverto a leggere le cronache, perché se circensi debbono essere, che almeno scorra il sangue. Non amo il tifoso perché ha una strana caratteristica: non capisce perché tu non lo sei, e insiste nel parlare con te come se tu lo fossi. Per far capire bene cosa intendo dire faccio un esempio. Io suono il flauto dolce (sempre peggio, secondo una pubblica dichiarazione di Luciano Berio, ed essere seguiti così attentamente dai Grandi Maestri è una soddisfazione). Supponiamo ora che mi trovi in treno e chieda al signore di fronte a me, tanto per attaccare discorso:

&gt;“Ha sentito l’ultimo compact di Frans Bruggen?”

&gt;“Come come?”

&gt;“Dico la Pavane Lachryme. Secondo me rallenta troppo all’inizio.”

&gt;“Scusi, non capisco.”

&gt;“Ma dico Van Eyck, no? (sillabando) Il Blockflöte.”

&gt;“Guardi che io...”

&gt;“Si suona con l’archetto? Ah, ho capito, lei non...”

&gt;“Io non.”

&gt;“Curioso. Ma lo sa che per avere un Coolsma fatto a mano bisogna attendere tre anni? Allora è meglio un Moeck in ebano. E’ il migliore, almeno di quelli in commercio. Me lo ha detto anche Gazzelloni. Senta, lei ci arriva sino alla quinta variazione di Derdre Doen Daphne D’Over?”

&gt;“Veramente io vado a Parma...”

&gt;“Ah, ho capito, lei suona in F non in C. Dà più soddisfazione. Sa che ho scoperto una sonata di Loeillet che...”

&gt;“Leiè chi?”

&gt;“Ma la voglio vedere sulle fantasie di Telemann. Ce la fa? Non userà mica la diteggiatura tedesca?”

&gt;“Io guardi, i tedeschi, la BMW sarà una gran macchina e li rispetto, ma...”

&gt;“Ho capito. Usa la diteggiatura barocca. Giusto. Guardi, quelli di Saint Martin in the Fields...”

&gt;Ecco, non so se ho reso l’idea.
E voi sarete d’accordo se il mio sfortunato compagno di viaggio si aggrapperà al campanello d’allarme.
Ma lo stesso avviene con il tifoso.
La situazione è particolarmente difficile con il tassista:

&gt;“Ha visto Vialli?”

&gt;“No, deve essere venuto mentre non c’ero.”

&gt;“Ma stasera guarda la partita?”

&gt;“No, debbo occuparmi del libro Zeta della Metafisica, sa, lo Stagirita.”

&gt;“Bene, veda e poi mi dica. Per me Van Basten può essere il Maradona del ’90, lei che ne dice? Però io terrei d’occhio Hagi.”

&gt;E via discorrendo, come parlare al muro. Non è che a lui non importi niente che a me non ne importi niente. È che non riesce a concepire che a qualcuno non ne importi niente. Non lo capirebbe neppure se avessi tre occhi e due antenne sulle squame verdi dell’occipite. Non ha nozione della diversità, varietà e incomparabilità dei Mondi Possibili.
Ho fatto l’esempio del tassista, ma lo stesso accade se l’interlocutore appartiene alle classi egemoni. È come l’ulcera, colpisce tanto il ricco che il povero. È però curioso che creature così adamantinamente convinte che tutti gli uomini siano uguali, poi siano pronte a spaccare la testa al tifoso che viene dalla provincia limitrofa. Questo sciovinismo ecumenico mi strappa bramiti di ammirazione. È come se quelli delle Leghe dicessero: “Lasciate che gli africani vengano a noi. Così poi li meniamo”.

If you put 100 gold coins in bank A, And I borrow 90 physical gold coins from that bank and pay them to my friend Tim, Tim can put those in another bank, Tims deposit can be lent out again! There is $190 gold coin deposited. There are only 100 physical gold coins. Your gold coin deposit are physically not in the bank you deposited it in, only a **fractional reserve deposit** is in the bank of 10% is.  The bank has lent 90% of your physical gold coins out. 90%  of these coin went through the economy and were deposited in another bank, bank c. The same physical coins were deposited 3 times. There are only 100 physical gold coins but there are $271 gold coins owed to to different depositors by banks. That is why it is called money circulation! It goes from one person to another. 

You are talking about **M1 manipulation**, the number of units of money value there is. This can be gold, silver, seashells; or paper (which can be devalued with printing money). That fractional reserve banking is related how many times the currency circulates around the economy. 
the 100% reserve refereed to in the article is gold for the printed currency. What you are not understanding is that gold backed currency circulates around the economy.

If you read the wiki article it will explain bank of the original bankers which were gold smiths, and how they got in trouble with this. 


The investopedia definition for Fractional Reserve Banking cite the 1929 crash which was when the world was on the gold standard. [here](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp)

those units of value were slung around the economy. Its not just to do with whether it paper or gold. It can still be gold but it just leaves a trail of IOUs. 

There was large bubbles market collapses roughly 15-20 year during the gold standard. Because the same type sort of jiggery-pokery was going on. The Great Depression was on the gold standard. A gold standard may have lessened the size of bubble but it still would of happened because much of the excess capital came from increase of M2 (the multiplier) and not M1 (units of money).
here is a libertarian explaining this (point.)[http://www.libertariannews.org/2011/12/01/why-do-people-want-a-gold-standard-when-history-shows-us-it-does-not-last/]

There wasnt a large amount of money printing before the crisis, particularly in Europe, where their was virtually none. 

Go read the wiki article, watch the video, and read the libertarian article it wont hurt you.

I kind of understand the Ukrainian parts where the narrator is speaking but you'll need Ukrainians to translate it.

They key part is at 1:34, a conversation between a 50 y/o GRU officer and deputy of Strelkov, ""Hmury"", and insurgent ""Buryat"" (his identity is being determined) 

Hmury: I'm listening, Buryat.

Buryat: Where should we ship this beauty, Nikolaevich?

Hmury: Which one? That one?

Buryat: Yes, yes, the one which I brought. I'm already in Donetsk.

Hmury:  The one which I'm thinking of, yes? The one which is ""B"" ... ""M"" ?

Buryat: Yes, yes.

Hmury: Wait, ""B"" ... ""M"" ?

Buryat: Yes, yes. BUK. BUK.

Hmury: Is it on a trailer? 

Buryat: Yes, we'll just need to unload it to hide it.

Hmury: Did it come with a crew?

Buryat: Yes, with a crew.

Hmury: You don't need to hide it anywhere, it's gonna go there. You understand?

(another conversation)

Hmury: Where are you now? Did you bring one or two?

Buryat: One, because they mixed things up and didn't deliver our trailer here. Unloaded it and let it go on its own.

Hmury: Did it come on its own or on a trailer?

Buryat: It crossed, it crossed the line (border)

Hmury: Ah, and now you brought her on a trailer?

Buryat: Yes, yes.

Hmury: Don't take it anywhere ... I'm gonna tell you where it must go. It'll go with tanks from  Vostok (battalion) Do you understand?

Then Hmury talks about logistics and where the BUK should  join the column with other insurgents.

In the other convos they also mention it, talk about it in action in Marinovka (downing a Su plane) and the expected shelling of Ukrainian troops from Russia.",0,1405687385,null,0,1405697826,0,cj0uj22,t3_2b1ekk,t1_cj0uj22,t1_cj0u6jl,null,1434775822,26,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,26

d'être seul sur le marché des données personnelles.

Pour en revenir à ta question, lorsque tu te connecte à ""petits-poneys-tout-nus.com"", google ne peut pas connaitre

It's pretty hot already.

The Russian leadership is in escalation mode. They will just keep going until they're stopped.

As if that was the point. The point is to get Russia on record saying that shooting down civilian airplanes is cool so no intervention is warranted.

&gt;The EU may be in the right legally and morally but it would still come with a potentially devastating responce from Russia.

And what casus belli are they going to use to invade Ukraine?

Non, j'ai dit ""ces états ont fait l'objet de politiques de spécialisations qui sont détaillées ici, avec une intervention massive de l'État aux exportations et des barrières ciblées.""

Et plus loin : ""Concrètement, ces pays n'ont pas respecté les règles et ont profité sur le dos des autres.""

&gt;Corée du Sud a suivi le meme exemple que les autres, une phase de libéralisation outranciere et d'une baisse des tariffs extremes

Avec du protectionnisme ciblé sur certains secteurs et une forte intervention de l'État.

&gt;Justement lis la section Résultat et regarde ce qui est écrit

L'ouverture et la dépendance de l'extérieur ne sont pas incompatibles avec du protectionnisme : regarde la Corée du Sud aujourd'hui.

&gt;Le dilemne ne rejette pas le libre-Échange au contraire elle l'accepte du moment qu'il y a des négociations!!! La majorité des accords de libre échange suivent ce modèle depuis les années 80.

Il montre que l'équilibre de Nash va conduire à ce que le libre-échange ne soit jamais effectif, ce qui a été le cas [pour la Corée du Sud et Taïwan](http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic442978.files/Rodrik%20--%20How%20Korea%20and%20Taiwan%20grew%20rich.pdf). On est clairement dans des cas de subventions aux exportations et non de libre-échange. Je n'ai aucun problème avec ce genre de politiques et je pense que l'UE devrait en faire en choisissant certains secteurs et en investissant massivement pour l'exportation dans ceux-ci. Par contre, ce n'est pas du libre-échange.

&gt;L'Ukraine ne perd rien vu quelle reste neutre au contraire elle a de petits gains comme les études le montrent.

L'Ukraine perd ses accords avec la Russie, ce qui n'est pris en compte dans aucune de tes études. En tenant compte de ça, l'Ukraine perd.

&gt;Évidemment quand est ce que j'ai dit que l'Ukraine pourra jouir quand elle sera pas stable.. en tant qu'économiste se serait stupide de dire sa.. Pour l'instant la Russie est le seul obstabcle a cette stabilisation.

Le fait est que la Russie n'avait aucun intérêt à garder ses accords avec l'Ukraine si l'Ukraine faisait des accords avec l'UE. Les négociations auraient dû être tripartites et l'UE a eu tort de négocier seule avec l'Ukraine.

Sinon, son gouvernement, sa corruption et sa population sont également de gros obstacles à sa stabilisation. Sa démographie est très mauvaise, elle n'a pas d'infrastructures et il n'y a pas de croissance à prévoir pour les financer.

&gt;D'ailleurs les événements d'aujourdhui risquent de mettre sur le banc les Pro russes. D'ailleurs je pense meme que la situation sera réglé d'ici la fin de l'été

Ce que je vois surtout, c'est que l'UE va prendre les cerveaux ukrainiens et que le pays restera corrompu et pauvre, avec une croissance ridicule et une population décroissante, à la Slovène.

&gt;Faux le papier ne prend en compte que deux modele en excluant les autres facteurs. La Russie n'a que des accords gaziers et des traitements préférentielles l'analyse du papier exclue pour ne se concentrer que sur un modele EU-Ukraine.

C'est bien ce que je dis, le papier ne prend pas en compte les réactions des pays qui subiraient les dommages collatéraux de cet accord. Penser que la Russie ne réagirait pas était une erreur.

&gt;Voila pourquoi la Russie cause tous ses troubles un pays souverain refuse de s'accorder avec lui elle sent qu'elle perd son intérets et des gains et déstabilise se pays

C'est l'inverse : l'Ukraine a refusé l'accord avec l'UE et c'est elle qui a créé les troubles, bien aidée par ses maîtres américains.

...et que je clique sur une des pubs proposées par Google Ads, non?

&gt; Du coup pour se protéger de cela tu utilise des plugins comme betterprivacy ou donottrackme  

Oui, ma précision quant à ces plugins était superflue, je les utilise surtout parce que ca m'a agacé un jour de voir une pub pour des helicos R/C sur météofrance, alors que j'avais acheté le même sur amazon la veille. Ce n'est pas forcément lié à Google.

&gt; mais dans ce cas je ne vois pas l'utilité de séparer les navigateurs (à part donner une illusion de sécurité :]).

C'est vrai.   
Historiquement, les premiers forks de Chrome étant assez instables, donc j'utilisais le Chrome officiel et j'avais la flemme de suivre la presse spécialisée tous les jours pour voir si ce navigateur envoyait ou non les URLS de chaque onglet ouvert.  
Une fois de plus, c'était histoire de décrire ma manière actuelle (et grandement imparfaite) de limiter mes échanges d'infos avec Google, non une présentation de la parade ultime.

Just imagine a Belgicist party doing well in the 2019 elections. After heavy protests in Brussels (mainly by francophones) the party manages to grasp power. This party then proposes to abolish the public use of the Dutch language. Obviously, the Flemish population responds angrily. Only then the Belgicist government decide to leave it at that says ""but guys, this is just how democracy works right? Right?""

Oviously not. Trampling on minorities has nothing to do with democracy.

ok until here

&gt; And I borrow 90 physical gold coins from that bank 

thats ok the time for you to return then money is lower that the time i lend to the bank

so if i lend the money to bank A for 90 days your loan must be inferior to 90 days 

today this is not the case the banks give loans for 40 years for people to buy houses but nobody lends money to the bank for 40 years 


&gt; There is $190 gold coin deposited.

no is not 

day 1 i lend 100 gold coins in bank A assets +100 gold coins

day 2 you borrow 90 gold coins bank A assets 10 gold coins + your collateral // 90 gold coins loan to you total assets in gold= 10


days 3 you pay tim 90 gold coins in ""cash""

day 4 tim take the 90 gold coins to bank B assets 90 gold coins 

bank A assets in gold coins + bank B assets in gold is 100 gold coins 

**note: there is no need for the bank to keep 10% of the gold coins because i lend them the coins for 90 days and i cant come and ask for the money before the 90 days and that remove the need for the bank to have reserves the bank only need to care if you default on the loan**

**the whole concept of reserves is just in case i come and ask for the money the next mourning even if i deposits the money today, again there is a huge deference when i say i lend money to the bank and i deposit the money to the bank**

**when i deposit the money to the bank i pay them to keep my money safe not to loan them out**

**when i lend the money to the bank i am doing a investment and i can lose my money because the bank will lend the money to other person and this person can default**


**fractional reserve banking is when i deposit and pay the bank to keep my money secure on their vault but the bank take my money and lend the money out, now the bank is fucked because anytime i can come and ask for the money but the bank cant go and ask the borrower to return the money immediately and in this case the bank is bankrupt the moment i go and ask for the money**

&gt; “Economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. This is no accident. The inherent difficulties of the subject would be great enough in any case, but they are multiplied a thousandfold by a factor that is insignificant in, say, physics, mathematics or medicine - the special pleading of selfish interests. While every group has certain economic interests identical with those of all groups, every group has also, as we shall see, interests antagonistic to those of all other groups. While certain public policies would in the long run benefit everybody, other policies would benefit one group only at the expense of all other groups. The group that would benefit by such policies, having such a direct interest in them, will argue for them plausibly and persistently. It will hire the best buyable minds to devote their whole time to presenting its case. And it will finally either convince the general public that its case is sound, or so befuddle it that clear thinking on the subject becomes next to impossible.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to these endless pleadings of self-interest, there is a second main factor that spawns new economic fallacies every day. This is the persistent tendency of man to see only the immediate effects of a given policy, or its effects only on a special group, and to neglect to inquire what the long-run effects of that policy will be not only on that special group but on all groups. It is the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences.”

Eh... ignoring the spent fuel-issue, there are still the usual problems with mining, refining and transporting the fuel. It's just as nasty, if not worse than coal and oil production.

&gt; enormous amounts of electricity

Nuclear plants do well enough for their sizes but you can't expect to plop down a couple of plants and think our energy usage has been covered. You still have to deal with short-term variation (reactor output is hard to adjust on-the-fly) and basic disaster theory should tell you not to put all your eggs in one basket. What happens when the geopolitical situation changes and our access to raw materials is cut off?

&gt; thorium reactors have been progressing steadily.

Sure, and when they're production ready we can discuss them as a viable alternative to regular reactors. Until then kindly stick with reality.

&gt; The only minor problem is the nuclear waste

Nuclear waste is a non-issue, on that we agree.

&gt; You haven't yet explained how we are to provide power to the people of the earth yet.

That might be because I don't have a simple solution. A drawback of my degree in physics is that I rarely speak with absolute confidence on matters I'm not fully educated in. The logistics on energy production and transport on a global or even national scale is one of those issues. But by all means, enlighten me. I always enjoy hearing from the engineers who work with these issues and given your bravado, you must be one of them.

&gt; Coal powered plants will end up causing irreversible and catastrophic climate change and pollution already kills tens of thousands of people each year.

I agree.

&gt; Sun and wind energy does not have the capacity to produce enough energy.

I agree. They can (and should) only provide part of the solution.

&gt; So what is your alternative.

*All of the above.* We need to rely on more than one power source. Solar, wind, Norwegian hydro, wave energy, biomass, nuclear, geothermal, gas. One of the nice things about the integrated power grid is that we can connect larger areas together and exploit their different capabilities for power generation.

&gt; You're the typical anti-nuclear energy person, that haven't got the faintest idea of what you're talking about.

Big words, considering that I had written absolutely nothing negative about the use of nuclear power.

It is a problem in both cases, I even mentioned what should be criticised and addressed. That's different from claiming someone not to have been elected. 

&gt; In that case, it would make sense that they elected a party. Not that they elected Juncker.

By this reasoning you could claim parliamentary deputies are not elected, just parties. 

&gt; However, we almost always know the name of the person who is the leader of the party we are voting for, and the names of the main people who are likely to end up as PM or president.

Regardless they don't know the list of deputies and therefore your point with regards to the leader would also fit said deputies. 

&gt; If the people aren't understanding the system, it is not the people that should be changed. It is the system that should be changed. 

All that could be said of national elections. 

You basically didn't address any of the point, that your reasoning could easily be applied to many aspects of national elections. 

Yeah they vote more, yeah they know the leader, yeah it's not exactly the same. It doesn't have to be exactly the same. Your reasoning could be used to make the same kind of claims.

&gt; Just imagine a Belgicist party doing well in the 2019 elections. After heavy protests in Brussels (mainly by francophones) the party manages to grasp power. This party then proposes to abolish the public use of the Dutch language. Obviously, the Flemish population responds angrily. Only then the Belgicist government decide to leave it at that says ""but guys, this is just how democracy works right? Right?""


That example would be appropriate if Belgium had been part of a Dutch/German Empire until 2000, and a Dutch/German straw man who heavily colluded with Germany had been deposed in 2019 by the protests. Quod non.

Or imagine if the Benelux had been part of the French Empire until 2000; a French straw man ends up on the president seat and tries to sign an exclusive association treaty with France; he's booted out after months of protests and in the frenzy during the formation of the new government somebody proposes to make Dutch the only official language in the Benelux, but the proposal is vetoed by the institutional safeguards before ever making it into law. It's overcompensation and wrong (understandable, who would like to give their former masters influence?), but it all happened within the discussion rooms and the institutional safeguards worked. (By now France has reannexed Luxembourg and is sending guns and troops into the Meuse valley, by the way...)

&gt;Obviously not. Trampling on minorities has nothing to do with democracy.

If they actually went through with it you would have a point, but they didn't: obviously the most extreme members of Maidan proposed it in the frenzy right after Yanukovych fled to his masters, but apparently the moderates have the power to quickly call them back if needed. To me it proved that the new government was trustworthy and not prone to radicalization, if anything. 

Since you're so fond of Belgian examples let's take the Koningskwestie: there was a lot of protest too and we still have kings. Does that mean 
Belgium is not democratic?

It's appalling that you try to cast Yanukovych as a champion of minority rights: the minority language rule was drafted to disproportionally benefit the Russian minority.

&gt;It isn't, but even the Soviet Union recognized the Ukrainian language so that should tell you enough.

Seriously, are you going to hold the *Soviet Union* as an example of commendable treatment of minorities? And are you going to keep blasting the Ukrainian government for a policy they never introduced?

&gt;You mean presidential elections after 2 months with a neutralized opposition? It's absolutely meaningless. It was clear from the start they were not interested in letting anything contest their newly obtained power.

There is no reason to ban the airspace when neither the ukrainians nor the insurgents are terrorists(supposedly). They have no gain to shoot down a civilian plane and as a result you'd expect that they wouldn't be aiming at them. 

The plane was flying at an altitude(10km) above the no fly zone(7km). SAM systems capable of reaching planes at this altitude, like the BUK, also have a radar that is capable of identifying whether the plane is a military or a civilian one. It isn't the airline's fault that the rebels can't even use their equipment properly.

true,coolsubmission,null,null,"&gt; Was du mit ""zu erst"" meinst verstehe ich nicht. Also vor dem Tod der Jugendlichen haben sich Palestinenser und Israelis noch nie gesehen? 

Doch haben sie sich, jedoch ist das was wir gerade erleben nicht die alltägliche Situation dort, sondern mal wieder ein Krieg/Aufstand/Konflikt wie auch immer du es benennen willst. Und dieser startete eben mit der Entführung von 3 israelischen Jugendlichen. Daraufhin hat die IDF bei der Suche in der Westbank mehrere Hamasmitglieder festnehmen lassen woraufhin Raketen wieder in grösseren Maßstab flogen.(Währenddessen wurden die Jugendlichen ermordet aufgefunden und die israelische Rechte dreht durch. Ein Palästinenser wird als Rache durch israelische Rechtsradikale umgebracht) Als Antwort auf den Raketenbeschuss hat dann die IDF angefangen im Gazastreifen Hamas-Stellungen zu bombardieren.

&gt;Die Hamas die sich sonst zu jedem Scheiss bekennt, hat die Verantwortung jedenfalls nicht übernommen.

Entführungen hat die Hamas auch vorher schon öfters begangen. Wenn in der Nachbarschaft ein Verbrechen begangen wird, nimmst du im Allgemeinen zu erst die Leute unter die Lupe die dort wohnen und dafür bekannt sind diese Verbrechen notorisch zu begehen. Ob die Hamas sicht nicht mittlerweile offiziell dazu bekannt hat, weiß ich nicht.

&gt;Oder man ist dann so krass und sagt: immer wenn ein Verbrechen geschieht, an dem ein Palestinenser beteiligt ist, dann ist immer auch die Hamas schuld. 

Oder man nimmt nicht nur einen Schwarz-weiss Blick und sieht ein das die Hamas nicht das unschuldige Lämmchen ist als das es dargestellt wird, sondern durchaus eigene militärische, politische und propagandistische Ziele hat.

&gt;Sollte das Level erreicht sein, also die 100%ige Vorverurteilung, dann hätte die Hamas ja grundsätzlich Recht in ihrem Handeln

Religiöse Fanatiker kriegen auf einmal recht weil irgendwer Vorurteile hat? Na komm schon...

&gt;Und ich bin fest überzeugt das die vielen toten Kinder auf Fussballplätzen in Palestina nicht schuld sind.

Hab ich auch nie behauptet. Die Zivilbevölkerungen sind auf beiden Seiten der Grenze die Leidtragenden.

&gt; Dann ist Selbstverteidigung der einzige Frieden für Palestina und ich kann nachvollziehen, wenn die Hamas eine Waffenruhe ablehnt

Komische Definition von Frieden immer wieder anfangen zu schießen. Aber nur mal angenommen deine Übertreibungen und Anschuldigungen würden stimmen, dann wäre Selbstverteidigung auch kein Frieden für Palästina. Sie haben militärisch keinerlei Chance einen Konflikt mit Israel zu gewinnen. Alles was Angriffe seitens der Hamas bewirken ist mehr Geld und mehr (palästinensische und arabische) Unterstützung für ihre Machtposition sowie eine militärische Reaktion Israels was in noch mehr toten Palästinenser endet. 

&gt;Es würde das Elend nur verlängern.

Gewagt. Wären sie nicht eher wesentlich dichter an einer Zwei-Staaten-Lösung(die von der Hamas im Übrigen abgelehnt wird)? Der einzige Weg Frieden im Nahen Osten zu bekommen ist eine Zwei-Staaten-Lösung. Diese werden die Palästinenser und mit ihnen die Hamas nicht durch Waffengewalt herbeiführen können. 

&gt;Dann soll Isreal einen endgültigen Vernichtungskrieg im Gazastreifen führen, wie es von den ultraortodoxden Juden häufig kolportiert wird. 

Was.ein.Schwachsinn.

&gt;Wenn Kinder von ihren Eltern geschlagen werden, tendieren sie später als Erwachsene auch überdurchschnittlich oft zu Gewalt gegenüber den eigenen Kindern. Und die Juden wurden bevor es einen Staat gab ja von den Deutschen geschlagen. Also sind wir der Grund, warum Israel keinen klugen Ansatz hat Frieden zu finden. 

Einfach mal Küchentischpsychologie auf Staaten übertragen? Ich glaube nicht das das so einfach geht. Ich stimme dir zu, das die harsche Verteidigungspolitik der Israelis zum Teil kulturell aus den Holocausterfahrungen kommt, allerdings da nun die Deutschen per se für den Nahostkonflikt verantwortlich zu machen ist schon etwas weit weggeholt.

&gt;Also sind wir der Grund, warum Israel keinen klugen Ansatz hat Frieden zu finden. 

Nein, der Grund warum es dort keinen Frieden gibt ist mMn eher das ein gelegentlicher Konflikt sowohl die Hamas als auch Likud in ihrer Machtposition bestärkt.

true,modomario,BELG,Belgium - Flanders,"&gt;For example West-Flemish and the Ghent dialect both have subjugations for yes (Joak, joaj, joat, ...), typical for Flemish dialects. 

Antwerp has those too you're somehow mixing modern dialects that had hundreds of years to evolve and mingle with each-other with the old county of Flanders.

&gt;Brussels being the capital of Flanders can't be really taken seriously anyway. But making Antwerp the capital would be a slap in the face of old Flanders. At that point you can rename Flanders to greater Brabant.

I don't think many people still attach the descriptor Flanders to the old county of Flanders. Especially with so much of it in modern France and the Netherlands.

&gt;Brussels being the capital of Flanders can't be really taken seriously anyway.

Back in the day it made sense no? 

With its history:

&gt;In the 15th century, by means of the wedding of heiress Margaret III of Flanders with Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, a new Duke of Brabant emerged from the House of Valois (namely Antoine, their son), with another line of descent from the Habsburgs (Maximilian of Austria, later Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, married Mary of Burgundy, who was born in Brussels). Brabant had lost its independence, but Brussels became the Princely Capital of the prosperous Low Countries, and flourished.

And when back in the day it was still majority Dutch speaking city and the biggest in Flanders itself at least until it was established as its own region.

It's just in recent history that its position has become somewhat of a travesty but is this enough reason to change it? Regardless the next biggest city to keep in mind imo is Antwerp with its size and the second biggest harbour in Europe. I really don't think we should make it ourselves difficult because we want to draw back history from hundreds of years ago.

&gt; It would suck for traffic though.

I don't think making it the capital of Flanders would bring that much more traffic. The few institutions and politicians that brings over doesn't really bring a traffic jam. Unless you're keeping Flemish separatism in mind.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; Your courts are good but even the bests courts are fallible. Aren't British people historically famous for their distrust of the government?

All courts are fallible, which is why there should be an appeal system. In the UK, there is the decision of the high court, that can be appealed to the court of appeal, that can be appealed to the supreme court. There has to be a final court, and of course that final court can get things wrong. However, this problem applies just as much to the ECHR as it does to the UK supreme court. 

&gt; And again, all those ordinary British people that won their ECHR cases against the UK Gov would probably disagree that you courts are always perfectly capable of administering the justice.

Yes, those ordinary people that win cases might think that the UK courts are not capable of administering justice. This does not mean that those people are correct though. They include, for example, Massey, someone convicted of sexual abuse against children, [who was awarded damages](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-67470#{""itemid"":[""001-67470""]}) because his trial took a long time to come to court. I'm afraid this does not fill me with confidence about the ECHR compared to the UK Supreme Court. 

&gt; And again, your judiciary isn't even properly independent of the legislature

What is important is that the judiciary act indendently of the legislature in the administration of justice. The UK does achieve this, even if, as a matter of formality the judiciary might not theoretically be entirely independent. I guess this is just another example of informal mechanisms working in the UK.

&gt; I think the decision regarding veils was a very bad one, I agree. No one said the ECHR was perfect. Certainly the US Supreme Court has had it's share of bad decisions, yet few argue for it's abolition.

I'm not arguing for the ECHR's abolition, but for the UK to pull out of its jurisdiction and put in place a regime that will take into account parliamentary sovereignty in the UK. 

&gt; Well, you might argue that the Court preventing the state from stripping a criminal of a right endangers other people but that is a very roundabout and flimsy justification for me. Better 100 guilty escape than 1 innocent person suffer. Isn't your legal system based on the same principle?

Ultimately, in a justice system, we have to trust the decisions of a court with a final say. We both agree with this principle, both recognising that it is not perfect and sometimes innocent people will lose out. You think that the ECHR will do that job best. I am not convinced by that.

&gt; I always try to upvote you, because you do always argue properly for your positions, but unfortunately, this is Reddit, sigh...

Cameron isn't interested in anybody's ""sovereignty"", what he envisions is a concerto of a handful of strongmen sitting together and deciding the fate of 700 hundred or so million people.

Win Merkel, neutralize Hollande and/or Renzi - and everybody, parties, parliaments, press, civil society, EU institutions, any country with less than 40 million people will just magically fall into line. Why? Because that's simply how the world is run.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; When pratically all European governments (46 without the UK) do one thing and only the UK and Belarus government do the other thing that deserves an explanation that actually takes these (namely 46 plus 2) points into account. 

It is worth remembering that those 46 goverments include Russia. In my mind, the fact that Russia, a state that just annexed Crimea and has poor regard for democracy and rule of law, is happy to be in the ECHR, is indicative of how powerful a system it is. Also, I'm not sure if you have been to the UK or Belarus, but I don't think comparisons between the UK (in relation to human rights) and Belarus are really very helpful.

&gt; The Tories' aim however is to weaken (""reform"") the institutional framework on this continent to increase their own power to set the European agenda.

I'm not sure if you are talking about the EU here or the ECHR. So it is hard to argue specifically with you.

&gt; Cameron isn't interested in anybody's ""sovereignty"", what he envisions is a concerto of a handful of strongmen sitting together and deciding the fate of 700 hundred or so million people.

Are you talking about the EU or the ECHR? Both of these bodies were designed by a handful of strongmen sitting together. I would be in favour of the voter being able to get involved in reforming them though. And do you know what? So is Cameron. That's why he wants the UK public to be able to vote on a new deal with the EU in a refederendum. Personally I hope that other countries can vote too.

&gt; Insofar he's not far apart from Putin. Actually, both are convinced that's this is simply how the world is - claiming anything else is just propaganda, they think. You want something? Win Merkel, neutralize Hollande and/or Renzi - and everybody, parties, parliaments, press, civil society, EU institutions, any country with less than 40 million people will just magically fall into line. Why? Because that's simply how the world is run. Cameron's und Putin's whole perception of the world is similar - this is why both tend to resort to conspiracy theories when things happen that simply don't fit into that worldview. 

I really don't think it makes sense to compare Cameron and Putin. Putin just annexed Crimea and has scant regard for democracy. Cameron has to operate in a mature democracy: he will be up for election in less than 12 months time.

Of course it was; it's very understandable that they were trying to limit Russian influence and were looking at all Yanukovych laws that were advantageous to Russia and whether they could scrap them. Thankfully wiser heads prevailed and somebody told them to hold their horses.

&gt;Second, there was no veto by institutional safeguards; I doubt Ukrainians even know what that is.

The president vetoed it, which is his constitutional right. While not explicitly a safeguard for minorities, requiring approval of multiple organs is a check and in this case it was also used as such.

&gt;The government unanimously decided the law on minority languages had to go.

The Rada approved it, the president vetoed it.

But there's no real plan for what to do about the past debt, which is of course not actually excluded. There's no way for Greece to accumulate enough of a primary budget surplus to pay it all back quickly; it would have to have miraculous economic growth to come up with that much money in only a few years. Short of default, the other solution is to keep a small primary surplus and slowly pay back the debt over an extended period of time (I think the IMF suggested 30 years at one point). But that only works if it can refinance the debt at low interest rates, like a person taking out a 30-year mortgage. Otherwise the rapidly compounding interest will make it impossible to ever repay the principal.

&gt;En fait, un seul référendum semble avoir eu lieu, et c'était en février 1991

Celui sur la Constitution de 1992 a été annulé par Kiev après la déclaration d'indépendance du Parlement de Crimée du 5 Mai 1992...

Ensuite, l'Ukraine a bafoué les [élections présidentielles de Crimée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_presidential_election,_1994) en janvier 1994, et a à nouveau bafoué le [référendum de 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_referendum,_1994). Ils ont annulé unilatéralement la constitution de 1992 en mars 1995, puis ont encore bafoué la Constitution votée par le Parlement de Crimée en octobre 1995.

&gt;Par ailleurs, quand l'Ukraine a tenu son propre référendum d'indépendance en Décembre 1991[2] , 54% des votants en Crimée ont voté pour

Absolument, à noter le contraste entre les 94% pour l'indépendance de la Crimée et les 54% pour l'indépendance de l'Ukraine. Si on ne compte pas l'abstention, tu as 40% des gens qui préféraient rester dans l'URSS plutôt que d'aller avec l'Ukraine...

&gt;Tu prends donc seulement les référendums qui t'arrangent, et en plus tu inventes d'autres.

J'ai dit 2 choses : ""3 référendums bafoués par Kiev"" : celui de 1991, celui qui a été annulé par Kiev en 1992, et celui de 1994.

Ensuite j'ai aussi dit ""C'est la 4ème fois qu'ils votent ça. Ça faisait 3 fois que Kiev se foutait de leur gueule."" Ils ont voté en 1991 par référendum, ils ont déclaré l'indépendance en 1992, et en mai 1994 le Parlement de Crimée a voté pour rétablir la Constitution de 1992. Ça fait bien 3 fois qu'ils votent pour l'indépendance.

There's no arguments needed. Voters voted for what they chose to vote. 
 
This is a pointless discussion because as I said again and again, your arguments could be easily used to make similar points about national elections.

Drastic moves away from Russian energy would hinder our economy. The turn, if it were to come, would be gradual. That would be less (or not at all) damaging to our economy, whilst still making clear to Russia that Europe refuses to remain dependent.

Then again, there's the question of if we want Russia to fully lose that custom. For all people believe Russia is, it is at least somewhat stable. Instability would be even worse.

I wouldn't go as far as saying that I'm able to have full on conversations, but I do know how to say a fair amount. The good thing with Duolingo is that you don't only learn words, but genders, how sentences are formed and especially grammar (which is probably the hardest part of learning a language). I definitely recommend that website. 

I also find that involving German with the things you enjoy doing (for me it's reading and music^^1 ). Watching movies in German might be taking it a bit too fast, in my opinion. I tried it and I just didn't know how it could benefit anyone as a beginner. Of course, everyone is different. 

^^1 I made a post in /r/Metal about German metal bands. If you're into metal music, I thought you might appreciate it. [This is the link to the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/2a5la7/bands_that_sing_in_german/) if you (or anyone else) is interested. 

EDIT - Link 

EDIT II - [This is what I mean by sentence structure](http://i.imgur.com/NiFpKVO.jpg). You can also discuss the sentences, which is really helpful if you get a question wrong and then you know how to answer it right next time, and apply what you've just read there on other questions too. Sadly they use a lot of words that I've never actually come across before like nominative and accusative etc. 

EDIT III - (I'm on Duolingo at the moment, hence all the extra information because I keep remembering shit). There's a 'strengthen skills' button. I know how to answer every question if I have the words in front of me, but I couldn't for the life of me remember most of the words. At the moment I'm abusing the *strengthen skills* button. I've got to the 2nd part of the verbs section on the website. It's really useful to have that button there so that you don't get overwhelmed.

First, there's no discrimination against Russian language itself on the day-to-day level. IMO, a bit more people are actively speaking Ukrainian now, but you can still spend a day in Kyiv without actually conversing in Ukrainian.

I'm not sure what will be the govt policy on languages, I hope it will be sane. President's declarations are looking good so far. I agree there should be a single state language for government business. Communities should decide if they want to promote other languages locally.

Your question can be partially answered by looking at the Donbass refugees. From what I hear, they're OK and some are even amazed at the hospitality they got from people who were supposed to hate their guts.

There's already some crowdfunding and general grassroots movement to rebuild Slovyansk and other war-torn cities. We, people of the North, Center, South and West need to help the, well, Far East people, need to show we don't hate them for what they are.

There are, of course, people who are hostile to Donbass and people who ask why should we help them now after all the stuff that went down there. IMO, it needs to be done if there's any hope to integrate the country.

Unabhängig davon, daß ich etwas anderes zu hören glaube... 

1. ""rassistische Hassrede"" finde ich im StGB nicht. Du meinst vielleicht ""Volksverhetzung"" - und dafür musst du nachweisen, daß das reine Singen eines Schüttelreimes geeignet ist, den öffentlichen Frieden zu stören; daß es sich bei den nicht näher bezeichneten ""Juden"" tatsächlich um eine Volksgruppe, und nicht im Hans-Peter Juden, Inhaber des örtlichen Zeitungskiosk^1 handelt, und das es sich tatsächlich um eine Beleidigung handelt. 

2. Verleumdung setzt voraus, daß jemand, der eindeutig identifiziert ist, in der öffentlichen Wirkung herabgewürdigt oder sein/ihr Kredit gefährdet wird. Die Demonstranten sprechen aber von einer nicht näher definierten Gruppe - und lässt völlig offen, um wen es sich denn nun genau handelt. Damit ist das keine Verleumdung. 
3. Beleidigung - auch hier muss das Tatopfer eindeutig bestimmbar sein. Folglich: keine justiziable Beleidigung.

BUT I'm a lot more concerned and I think a much bigger problem is the disloyalty of Polish-speakers to the state of Lithuania. (note, I don't call them Polish, because they are of varied descent, they just speak Polish). Most of them speak both Russian and Polish and often a combination. Therefore, they watch Russian TV, vote for pro-Russian candidates and mostly support Putin. Just like the leader of the Polish party who openly supports Putin.

That is a much bigger problem, and we should focus on stopping that.

All this Lithuanian-Polish 'conflict' is mostly being fueled by Kremlin agencies and politicians who work for them (Mr. Tomaszewski and his party).

And unfortunately it will not stop if we let bilingual street names... 
It can only stop if both Polish and Lithuanian politicians loyal to their countries stop collecting local political capital by fueling this problem even more.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; Yes even Russia. And lots of countries that aren't Russia. 

My point is that the fact that Russia (a country with poor respects for human rights) is a signatory, means that being a member is not of itself indicative of good human rights. The fact that Canada (a country with good respects for human rights) is not a signatory, means that not being a member is not indicative of poor human rights. Thus the UK pulling out does not, of itself, enable any conclusions. It really depends on what the UK puts in place instead. Given the UK's tradition of respect of liberties of the individual and that fact that it is a mature and stable parliamentary democracy, gives me confidence in the ability of the UK to put in place a good regime.

&gt; The EU is not a factory in outer space that produces free ponies for everyone. I am part of the EU and so are hundreds of millions other people! How can the UK unilaterally decide how I have to deal with them? What kind of idea of democracy or sovereignty is that? 

This isn't unilateral. Cameron is proposing a renegotiation. The renegotiation will be definition be multilateral, between all governements. The government that you elected will be how you deal with it [and your government has already indicated that it will renegotiate with the UK](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0df74c62-ff99-11e3-8a35-00144feab7de.html#axzz37q9ksDHU). I'm not sure if you voted for Juncker, be he is also apparently committed to renegotiating the UK's relationship with the EU, including protections for the UK because it will never join the euro etc. Hopefully your government will also give you a chance to vote on the new deal, so that you yourself have a direct say.

No, impeachment is not anti-constitutional, not in Ukraine, and it was exactly how Yanukovych was ousted, however, the manner in which the impeachment was done was almost assuredly not legal. 

The [2010 Ukrainian constituion](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine,_2010) (articles 108 through 112) clearly states the proper procedures for a legal impeachment of the residing president. 3/4 of the parliament (*Verkhovna Rada*) must, after an in-depth investigation of the allegated crimes of the President has been conducted and discussed, agree to move forward with the impeachment, after which the President has to leave his post and face whatever charges the impeachment was based on. According to many news outlest, [foreign](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/02/ukraine-parliament-ousts-president-yanukovich-2014222152035601620.html) and [domestic](http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv/euromaidan-rallies-in-ukraine-feb-21-live-updates-337287.html), only 328 of the Ukrainian deputies voted for the impeachment. 328 is not 3/4 of the 447 deputies in parliament. They would need at least 336 votes.

Thus, Yanukovych's impeachment was, by the definition of the Ukrainian constitution, unlawful.

But you are right, I am by no means a legal expert, neither in Ukraine or in general, but these facts are hard to dismiss. I am not Ukrainian, and so, it would be a wee bit difficult for me to actually take this to court, wouldn't you agree?

&gt; There's no such thing. You're probably very very very misguided to believe in it.

Are you saying there's no ""*the West*""? Because I could say the ""*USA and the EU*"" instead if that's what you prefer?

On the other hand we already have confirmation that it was shot down and that the missile was launched from separatist territory with advanced equipment that would require Russian assistance to operate even if it wasn't directly provided and was looted from Ukraine... and it's sort of silly to assume what we know about the event is the same as what Merkel knows.

Most likely she's just waiting for the public outrage to die down. If she wanted to impose tougher sanctions now would be the best time to do it while sentiment is high.

The reasonable time requirement/right to speedy trial is a long standing legal principle. Surely a paedophile has that right just as much as anyone else, however emotionally wrong it must feel. I mean, you could argue the length of time *was* reasonable but evaluating the  ""speediness"" of a national court system seems to me like exactly a case where an outside observer would be more impartial and unbiased than a national court. (also, note that the British judge on the Court, Nicolas Bratza, also voted for the decision, in fact it was a unanimous decision).

&gt; Ultimately, in a justice system, we have to trust the decisions of a court with a final say. We both agree with this principle, both recognising that it is not perfect and sometimes innocent people will lose out. You think that the ECHR will do that job best. I am not convinced by that.

Okay, a fair summary. Agree to disagree. I'm sad that the British seem like the only ones unable to trust the ECtHR, though.

I recently went there to avoid the rain, ordered a glass of fruit juice, and it took 24 minutes to reach my table. There were exactly six other patrons in the café, and they had already been served before I sat down. Did they go to Spain to pick the oranges in-between the time that I placed my order and they finally brought it out to me? It doesn't take half an hour to make a fucking cup of juice. It takes less than five minutes to make a cappuccino, but I bet if you order one, you'll grow a beard before it arrives, and it will be cold. 

However, as far as buying coffee beans goes, Caféothèque is great. If you have an hour to stand around at the front desk, desperately searching for any sign of an employee. When they finally do arrive, you will see that they have perfected that Parisian art of applying the minimum requirement of effort while pretending that you don't even exist.

And why should that be off limits? Most NATO members dont even make a marginal effort towards their own defense. Given the US is the one largely picking up the tab, it has earned the right to criticize their contributions, or lack thereof. The US has already spent $1 billion reinforcing Eastern Europe since Crimea, and for what? To be derided as imperialist warmongers in a few months once things calm down. It seems European nations praise and use US military might whenever there is a European issue. But otherwise the US military is considered the most evil force in the world. 

&gt;NATO has been working closely with Sweden for decades and now suddenly that Russia is acting up, the message is ""Well if Russia comes you are on your own, you're not in NATO, bye bye. Better join up :3 ""

I have not seen any pressure on Sweden to join, but NATO is a treaty and is not obligated to protect non-members. Sweden gets benefits from cooperating with NATO as well, it is not doing it out of the kindness of its heart. Personally I think Sweden would enjoy support should it be militarily attacked, but it seems a bit arrogant to assume you should get all of the benefits of membership with none of the responsibilities.

Lot's of Russians support him because they believe he's restoring the country to it's former glory. Despite what you may think of him, he has actually done a lot to improve Russia. In my personal opinion, these sanctions aren't working and are only further alienating Russia.

They don't fight him, they negotiate with him.

I suspect that's intentional on his part. He wants to appear strong to the rest of the world, and he's succeeded. Putin had most of the world, specifically the U.S, up in arms over him, while he sat back and watched events unfold. I highly doubt Putin wanted yesterday to happen. It would do too much damage to his goals.

I'm the same. Despite what you may think of Putin and Russia, I always liked that they acted as a counter to the U.S. The U.S has an innate ability to insert itself into places where it's not needed. You should listen to the interview Hillary Clinton gave earlier, in which she said, ''Europe should follow America's lead''.

The classical gold standard ended in 1914. There still was a gold standard exchange, it is still a gold standard. ""The U.S. maintained the value of the dollar at $35/oz. of gold from 1934 to 1971."". 

The classical gold standard does not require a loan to be paid back in a short time, neither did it require 100% collateral. Especial in a unregulated environment which libertarians prefer. Debtor prisons couldn’t have existed if there was 100% collateral. 

Infant that’s where the Central banks as issuers of currency came from. they were a lender of last resort when a bank over stretched their lending. People would panic and demand their gold deposits which was present at the same time creating a bank run. the central bank was created to be a lender of last resort. There were speculative bubbles and bank runs during this period. And yes there was long term credit. [here](http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2010/01/01/the-tumultuous-19th-century)

Gold itself only has no real intrinsic value such a industrial metals. It is useful as currency as it is scarce, durable and pretty. What gives it monetary value believe and in a gold standard government force in the requirement to use it for gov. transactions. If a currency is keeps a base units of denomination notes. It behaves in a highly similar way to a gold standard [here](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/07/euro-and-gold-standard). It was design with experiment fixed rate of exchange. What is used for the currency isnt important it is that people place trust in it. The euro is a strong currency. The ECB, didn’t create excel money until 2011. European banks lend out fixed units of money that they. New units of money were not created.

If the gold bug claims were true there would be massive inflation every year. Supply and Demand. It would utterly unavoidable. There isn't, there is a treat of deflation. The ECB may have to withdraw liquidity through higher interest rates- they do do that. Ireland had 23% interest in the 80s trying to maintain parity with the Deutchmark. What Europe is in dangerous of is deflationary contraction, historically this is disastrous.

Z.B. an den Griff ""an die Eier"", den ich als Symbol für totale Unterordnung und Verfügbarkeit empfunen habe. Und das Gefühl fast totaler Hilflosigkeit, weil Staat und Gesellschaft einem bei diesem Unrecht nicht zu Hilfe kommen werden - weil sie es sind, die einem das antun.

Jetzt könnte man natürlich überlegen, ob Musterung und Wehrdienst tatsächlich das gleiche sind, wie die Objektifizierung von Frauen durch Männer*, schließlich liegt Macht beim Militär und (zumindest bis vor kurzem) im Staat überwiegend in der Hand von Männern, d.h. sie als soziale Klasse hätten auch die Möglichkeit, das Problem ""einfach"" aus der Welt zu schaffen. Eine Macht, die die Klasse der Frauen (so) nicht hat, wenn es z.B. um Sexismus auf der Straße oder in Medien geht.

Der Text geht da leider Null drauf ein. Stattdessen wird argumentiert, dass die Wehrpflicht viel schlimmer sei, und die von Feministinnen angesprochene Objektifizierung daher nicht zähle. Wieso muss das gegeneinander stehen? Ich z.B. kann relativ problemlos beides scheiße finden.

Und als Aufhänger für das Ganze dient ein Blogpost von 2010, und als Belege (Stichwort: geborene Gewalttäter) z.B. ein Blogkommentar von 2003.

Es fängt schon damit an, daß behauptet wird, ""sie"", also die Salafisten würden ihre Missionierungsarbeit ""Da'wa"" nennen. Tun sie auch, aber die Formulierung erweckt den Eindruck das beschränke sich auf sie. Nein, das Wort ist arabisch und stammt aus dem Koran und ist eine religiöse Pflicht für Muslime (fard kifaya) und nicht irgendwas speziell salafistisch-wahhabistisches. 

Dann nehmen nicht nur die Salafisten den Koran wörtlich in dem Sinne, daß sie daran glauben er sei das unverfälschte und unabänderliche Wort Gottes, sondern das ist fester Glaubensbestandteil. Genauso wie der Glaube die wahre Religion gefunden zu haben. Das hat also nichts mit salafistischem-wahhabistischem Purismus zu tun. 

Dann wird behauptet, die Salafisten würden eine ""fundamentalistische Auslegung"" des Islam vertreten. Der Duden ist sich mit mir einig, daß das Wort nicht das bedeutet, was der Autor meint, das es bedeutet:

&gt; geistige Haltung, Anschauung,die durch kompromissloses Festhalten an [... religiösen] Grundsätzen gekennzeichnet ist ...

Das ist nicht nur die Essenz des Islam, sondern aller drei Buchreligionen. Man hält kompromisslos an den religiösen Grundsätzen fest, hier wie Allah es den Muslimen befohlen hat. Wenn nun im Koran steht: ""Schweinefleisch ist haram"", dann wird es durch keine Interpretation halal werden. Das ist kein Fundamentalismus, das ist Islam.

Was der Autor sagen will: die Salafisten folgen einer ganz bestimmten Rechtsschule des Koran, ähnlich der, die auch die Wahhabiten vertreten, nur gehen jene noch weiter und wollen ""modernes Teufelszeug"" komplett verbieten. Das ist in etwa so wie Amish vs. ultrakonservative Evangelikale.

Ändert aber nichts daran, daß vieles, was als ""salafistisch"" kritisiert wird, so oder so ähnlich entweder im Koran oder den Hadithen steht, oder wie - im Falle der Verschleierung - von den großen Rechtsschulen als verbindlich angesehen wird. Es wird sich nur darum gestritten was genau zu verdecken ist, also wie viel und welchen Stellenwert dieses Gebot hat.

Je n'ai jamais critiqué le protectionisme... Supporté un libre échange ne veut pas dire ne pas suppporter un protectionisme(Il y a plusieurs types de protectionisme.. en économie). Rien ne contredit l'autre. Regarde les tarrifs des pays asiatiques dans les années 50,60 a 70 et aujourdhui. Ils sont tellement bas pour les étranger qu'en réalité sur papier ce ne serait que du libre échange.

**Singapore**
&gt;**More than 99% of all imports into Singapore enter the country duty-free**. 

http://www.export.gov/singapore/doingbusinessinsingapore/traderegulationscustomsandstandards/index.asp

**Hong Kong**

&gt;**Hong Kong, China is a free port and does not levy any Customs tariff on imports or exports. There is also no tariff quota or surcharge. There is no value added taxes nor general services taxes.** 

http://www.tid.gov.hk/english/import_export/tariffroo/tariffroo_maincontent.html

**Corée du Sud**

&gt;**Duty rates in South Korea vary from 0% to 40%, with the average duty rate at **4.17%**.  **Some products can be imported **free of duty **(**e.g. books)**  


Les tarrifs de ses pays asiatiques sont si ridiculement bas pour les étrangers ou inexistant dans le cas de Hong Kong.
qu'ils sont en réalité  dans une situation de libre échange et ceux depuis le début de leur développement économique. 

Un libre échange n'empeche pas de subventionner les exportations...ou un interventionisme(excluant les tariffs). Tu te confonds entre **laissez-faire et libre échange**

En parlant ici tu peux voir la [liste de tous les pays qui ont un acccord de libre échange avec les USA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_trade_agreements). Tout ses pays sont les plus performants de leurs régions et les plus stables avec des taux de croissance positif et une amélioration sans cesse du niveau de vie.

&gt;Il montre que l'équilibre de Nash va conduire à ce que le libre-échange ne soit jamais effectif, ce qui a été le cas pour la Corée du Sud et Taïwan.

&gt;Xavier Vives drew a parallel with Japan. In this case, he felt that the
coordination of investment had indeed been important, as stressed by Rodrik. Yet,in his view, the role of public subsidies has been mostly symbolic as their size hasbeen quite modest. He was seconded by Michel Keen, who asked Rodrik toprovide more information on the size of investment subsidies.


Dani Rodrik(L'auteur de ton lien) n'a jamais été en mesure de fournir les chiffres aupres de ses pairs et il est un des seuls a critiquer se modele.

&gt;L'Ukraine perd ses accords avec la Russie, ce qui n'est pris en compte dans aucune de tes études. En tenant compte de ça, l'Ukraine perd.


N'importe quoi et sa frole le ridcule... ses études agissent comme si la Russie n'a jamais éxisté ce qui est parfait... car ses anlayses utilisent les modeles les plus précis en économie. Ils agissent comme si l'Ukraine n'avait aucun traitement préférentiel avec personne d'autre donc ils ont enlevé les avantages de la Russie et au contraire c'est une bonne chose. Et en enlevant meme **les avantages russes**on voit que l'Ukraine ne perd rien. Rien ne garantit que ce que la Russie offre est mieux.Tout les études que j'ai revue ont rejeté l'accord russe avec raison. L'Ukraine bénéfie(Plusieurs subventions , rabais ect) des Russes depuis les années 90 et l'économie n'a jamais été effective. Un accord de plus peu importe le montant n'aurait servi a rien.



&gt; Ce que je vois surtout, c'est que l'UE va prendre les cerveaux ukrainiens et que le pays restera corrompu et pauvre, avec une croissance ridicule et une population décroissante, à la Slovène.


Bla Bla Bla.. Alors prenons un exemple moderne. Le Mexique a signé un accord de libre échange avec les USA et le Canada dans les années 90. Par contre le Mexique était dans une situation pire économiquement. Les résultats.. il n'y a pas eu de perte de cerveau(seulement 5% de la population de ceux qui émigrent ont un diplome universitaire) au contraire ce sont les pauvres qui quittent le pays et le Mexique est un des pays d'Amérique avec le plus haut taux de croissance.. baisse de crime, hausse des diplomés et surtout un record bas pour l'émigration ect et ceux meme avec un libre échange avec le pays le puissant de la planete. Mon pays la Pologne n'a pas eu d'évasion de cerveau majeure.. a part pour les pauvres et ceux malgré un libre-échange avec l'UE plusieurs études ont été réalisé sur ce sujet et voila les conculsions d'une d'elle par la Banque mondiale

 &gt;En moyenne, pour les pays de plus de 30 millions d’habitants, l’exode des cerveaux concerne moins de 5 % de tous les diplômés d’université

L'évasion de cerveau ne se passe généralement que dans des pays de tailles aussi petites que la Slovénie!! L'Ukraine a pres de 40 millions d'habitants les études montres que ce risque est minime. Quand a savoir si le pays restera corrompu ou pas. La tu ésais de prédir l'avenir.. sans compter que l'accord de l'UE inclut un volet politique. Je suis sur que l'Ukraine va se réformer a la lettre car son but est d'intégrer l'UE donc il est obliger.


&gt;C'est l'inverse : l'Ukraine a refusé l'accord avec l'UE et c'est elle qui a créé les troubles, bien aidée par ses maîtres américains.

Non les négociations ont commencé depuis 2008.. Yanukovich a lancé plusieurs études parlementaires. Tous ses études ont conclu sur une période de 4 ans ont conclu que l'accord UE était mieux. La signature de cet accord était une promesse électoral de Yanukovich..tout le monde s'attendait qu'il le signe... et tout d'un coup en moins d'une semaine il la rejette malgré ses propres études qu'il a commandé et les recommendations de son député chef??? Et il annonce en moins d'une semaine qu'il rejette et qu'il signera avec la Russie??? Sa lui a pris 4 ans et 17 études et des commissions parlementaires pour conclure avec l'UE mais par contre sa ne l'a pris que moins d'une semaine avec la Russie???. Il y a eu clairement intervention Russe...

Two very short and vague wiki pages, and an opinion quote without evidence is not an argument. 

the thing with libertarianism is that it is an ideology. facts don't matter at all. Between glass-stegal and the 2008 crisis was the longest period by far with out a large financial crisis in the US. 50 year!!! The norm before glass-stegal was about every 15. And that was with out your beloved classical gold standard. And the crisis was no were near as bad as the 29 crash. 1941-79 was an extraordinary period of growth. And that had high margin and corporate taxes, strong unions and anti-trust law, as well as a pro-business environment and relatively low regulation. the post war miracle recovery of europe involved brethan-woods and the marshal plan, which was massive stimulus!!! The imputes for the marshall plan was the UK telling the US they couldnt afford to protect Greece from communism without financial aid. OMG! Germany's economic since the war was truly astonishing. They did that completely without the classical gold standard. Even before the Affordable Car Act Europe spent about half their percentage GDP on healthcare despite it being mostly government run. that's not possible in the libertarian universe. 
The Above are ascertainable facts. 

But to a staunch libertarian (I actually have reasonable for many right wing opinions) facts are ignored or re arranged if they dont fit the narrative. 

bubble and crashes during classical gold standard- not gold standard fault.  But when they happen far less often off the gold standard, its because they are not on the gold standard. Ragan lowers taxes on rich, great republican, he tripped the national debt but meh! Ragan's corporation tax and capital gains were twice that of Obama, yet obama is the communist. 
The 50s and 60s had strong unions and high marginal tax rates, along with a pro-business policy and relatively low regulation. This time had strong anti-trust laws. 

It is not a simple narrative, Economics is rather complex. Correlation does not mean causality, and causality is very difficult to ascertain. Different strategies work for different countries and at different times. Life ain’t simple. Any of the above can be argued and discussed, levels of influence and interaction and so on. But to have a default of everything isn’t libertarian enough for everything is just silly.

You know when the old colon gives you the elbow and it feels sorta cold inside, and you know all you have to do is turn loose? Well this talking hit you right down there, a bubbly, thick stagnant sound, a sound you could smell.

This man worked for a carnival you dig, and to start with it was like a novelty ventriliquist act. Real funny, too, at first. He had a number he called “The Better ‘Ole” that was a scream, I tell you. I forget most of it but it was clever. Like, “Oh I say, are you still down there, old thing?”

“Nah I had to go relieve myself.”

After a while the ass start talking on its own. He would go in without anything prepared and his ass would ad-lib and toss the gags back at him every time.

Then it developed sort of teeth-like little raspy in-curving hooks and started eating. He thought this was cute at first and built an act around it, but the asshole would eat its way through his pants and start talking on the street, shouting out it wanted equal rights. It would get drunk, too, and have crying jags nobody loved it and it wanted to be kissed same as any other mouth. Finally it talked all the time day and night, you could hear him for blocks screaming at it to shut up, and beating it with his fist, and sticking candles up it, but nothing did any good and the asshole said to him: “It’s you who will shut up in the end. Not me. Because we dont need you around here any more. I can talk and eat and shit.”

After that he began waking up in the morning with a transparent jelly like a tadpole’s tail all over his mouth. This jelly was what the scientists call un-D.T., Undifferentiated Tissue, which can grow into any kind of flesh on the human body. He would tear it off his mouth and the pieces would stick to his hands like burning gasoline jelly and grow there, grow anywhere on him a glob of it fell. So finally his mouth sealed over, and the whole head would have have amputated spontaneous — (did you know there is a condition occurs in parts of Africa and only among Negroes where the little toe amputates spontaneously?) — except for the eyes you dig. Thats one thing the asshole couldn’t do was see. It needed the eyes. But nerve connections were blocked and infiltrated and atrophied so the brain couldn’t give orders any more. It was trapped in the skull, sealed off. For a while you could see the silent, helpless suffering of the brain behind the eyes, then finally the brain must have died, because the eyes went out, and there was no more feeling in them than a crab’s eyes on the end of a stalk.",0,1405716543,null,0,false,0,cj18lzc,t3_2b103x,t1_cj18lzc,t1_cj0zqxr,null,1434782730,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Und inwiefern ist das relevant? Alles was ich gesagt habe ist, dass das Anregen zu Abkürzungen die Sprache bei langem nicht besser macht.

&gt; ""Ich kenne viele Leute aus Deutschland und Österreich, die wunderschönes Englisch sprechen und sogar 'gotta' and 'gonna' verwenden haha""

Ich habe selbst bereits deutlich erklärt, dass es genauso präzise und korrekt sprechende Menschen gibt, die sich umganssprachlicher Dialekte bedienen, wie solche die das nicht tun und wüsste nicht, wozu ich das wiederholen sollte. Ich habe nie etwas gegen Abkürzungen gesagt.

&gt; ""Ich habe gar nicht gesagt, dass Sprachlernende so mundartlich und informell wie möglich reden sollten.""

Nein, aber du hast im Zuge deiner Antwort auf die Frage danach, was dir einer der üblichsten Fehler englischsprachig Aufgewachsener beim Verwenden von Deutsch seien empfohlen, sich Abkürzungen anzueiognen. Wenn du in Österreich oder Süddeutschland beginnst, Deklinationen von ""ein"" abzukürzen, während du mit englischem Akzent sprichst, wird das Aufheben des Unbehagens, von dem du gesprochen hast, das allerletzte sein was du erreichen wirst. Und du wirst definitiv niemals informeller klingen, bloß weil du dir solche sinnlosen Angewohnheiten zu eigen machst. Die wirken entweder aufgesetzt, oder sind schlicht sinnlos.

Wer beim Sprechen einer Sprache so viel Sorge darum hat, aufzufallen, weil er den Konventionen der Muttersprachler nicht entspricht, der verliert seine Botschaft auf Kosten von Nachahmung des gegenübers. Das geht am Ziel von Kommunikation komplett vorbei.

Ich sage dir das übrigens wirklich vorrangig, weil dein Beispiel bezüglich ""ein"" schlichtweg falsch ist. Sprache wirkt nicht hölzern, bloß weil Wörter nicht abkürzt, die manche (in diesem Fall vorrangig norddeutsche) Menschen abkürzen. Dementsprechend wirkt man auch dann nicht umständlich oder förmlich, wenn man diese Stilmittel *gar nicht* benutzt, solange man nur seine Botschaft verständlich vermittelt.

Den letzten Teil habe ich mal schlichtweg übergangen. Ich empfehle dringend, dir eingeschnappten Sarkasmus für Leute aufzusparen, die überhaupt versucht haben, dich zu beleidigen.

Piu' che il fatto in se' (l'assoluzione di un colpevole) questo conferma che la giustizia in Italia non funziona; e questo vale per la giustizia penale, quella civile (che paralizza l'economia) e quella amministrativa (che ha causato storie come Stamina).

Non so come se ne possa uscire, ma penso che un primo passo sarebbe limitare il potere e le competenze dei TAR (vedi Stamina) e ridurre i tempi della giustizia a livelli Europei. Non bisogna nemmeno inventare nulla, basta copiare quello che avviene negli stati dell'Europa civile.

Ricordo anche l'idiozia di Monti, grande Economista del Menga, che dopo aver avuto una bella lavata di capo dalla commissione europea (con tanto di statistiche sui costi economici della lentezza dei processi), invece di pensare a rendere la giustizia piu' efficiente propose un 'tribunale veloce' **ma solo per le imprese**.

E i comuni cittadini si attacchino. E questo e' stato il tecnocrate piu' autorevole che l'Italia ha saputo esprimere?

Are you sure about this? I've seen early-warning satellites in museums and they had what looked like a compound eye array to detect the IR radiation as it was launched.

&gt;This noise is what makes the rocket trackable.

Do you have any information about this? I work in RF (though not radar), and I can't imagine this working.

&gt; Das widerspricht sich. Das ist keine deutliche Sprache. Das ist Dialekt. Die Regionen in denen ""Ich wollt'"", oder ""Er wollt'"" verwendet wird sind enorm begrenzt. So spricht man nur in ganz spezifischen Dialekten. Es gibt durchaus standardsprachliche Abkürzungen und verschluckte Vokale zwischen Wörtern, aber die Beispiele die du angeführt hast sind alle Bestandteile von Dialekten. Willst du wirklich behaupten, du würdest die Empfehlungen, die du dazu machst, was ein Deutschlernender an seinem Sprechverhalten verbessern müsse, nach Regeln von regionalen Phänomenen richten? Seit wann sind Dialekte [die sich von einander unterscheiden und nicht alle erlernbar sind!] ein Qualitätsstandard für Sprache?

So du in Anbetracht dessen deine Beispiele zurücknehmen solltest und dich nur auf standardsprachliche Abkürzungen [das ""hinterm Haus"" aus deinem ersten Post hätte da ja gut gepasst] beziehen wolltest, so würde ich bitten, endlich auf meine ursprüngliche Kritik an genau der Theorie, dass diese Abkürzungen die Konversation weniger beklemmend für die Zuhörer machen würden, einzugehen.

Bisher hast du dazu geäußert, dass du Leute kennst, die solche Sprache von anderen bevorzugen, aber das habe ich [und das erkläre ich jetzt zum dritten Mal; ich weiß nicht ganz, weswegen du das nicht annehmen kannst] doch überhaupt nie geleugnet! Ich habe selbst gesagt, dass manchen Leuten Sprache nach der Schrift, anderen aber abgekürzte und situationsbedingt informelle Sprache besser zur präzisen Unterhaltung dient, ohne Beklemmungsgefühle hervorzurufen. Mein Problem damit war von Anfang an, dass du das Sprechen ohne Verwendung solcher Konventionen als fehlerhaft bezeichnet hast, indem du es hier in diesem Thread [in dem Fehler diskutiert werden] als verbesserungsbedürftig deklariert hast. Rege dich jetzt so viel du willst darüber auf, dass ich versucht habe, dir mit Argumenten darzulegen, dass dies schlicht nicht der Fall sein kann [der Wiederholung halber, damit das nicht verloren geht: Das ist dadurch bewiesen, dass Sprache ohne solche Gewohnheiten absolut genauso präzise, wie mit eben diesen sein kann und dass Gesprächspartner nur dann von ihrem Fehlen irritiert sein werden, wenn sie selbst auf ihre Verwendung bestehen], aber das macht meinen Standpunkt noch nicht zu einer Meinungsfrage, wie du das behauptest. Meine Argumente sind dargelegt, um einen Fakt zu beweisen.

&gt; ""Und ich empfehle dringend, dir diesen scharfen Ton der europäischen Hochnäsigkeit für Leute aufzusparen, die davon beeindruckt sein werden.""

&lt; Tut mir Leid, aber hieran war nichts hochnäsiges. Ich habe dich darauf aufmerksam machen wollen, dass dein Empfinden, ich hätte dich als ungebildeten Wilden dargestellt, indem ich dich auf einen Fehler aufmerksam gemacht habe, absolut haltlos war. Dahinter lag nur das Bedürfnis, die Diskussion von deiner Opferhaltung zu befreien, damit wir auf eine sinnvolle Argumentationsbasis kommen können.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"Are you seriously blaming the US for not going to war with Russia over this? A NATO nation was not attacked. Russia shot down a Korean Air flight in the 80s killing a US congressman and 61 other Americans, and the US did not go to war over it. And ""mom jeans"" Obama was not president, Reagan was. Dont take it as a slight to you, Eastern Europe, or NATO. It does not fall within the guidelines of an attack on a NATO member. 

If you want to deride anyone for not lifting a finger look to the EU. It has done next to nothing since the annexation of Crimea. If you look at Russian markets, Russian energy stocks took a major blow the past few days. That is because the US acted unilaterally and implemented additional sanctions largely targeting Russia's energy industry. It waited for months for support from the EU, but to no avail. And before you make the tired argument that no US companies would be affected, the US energy industry was 100% against sanctions. They have large investments in Russia, and went so far as to run TV commercials claiming sanctions would hurt American jobs (and obviously strongly lobbied against them). 

I will be the first to say I wish Brussels took Eastern European assessments of Russia more seriously, but that is hardly Obama's fault. If you really want to fault someone for doing nothing, you dont have to look all the way to Washington, try Brussels. And feel free to have Romania declare war on Russia over this. Stop blaming Obama for every action that does not align with your view of what should happen. Because for all intents and purposes, the US has done far more than the EU, and last I checked this is a European issue.

Comunque, un po di background per gli indignati: Purtroppo le persone omosessuali sono molto più a rischio di HIV, in quanto è una malattia molto frequente fra i gay. Immagino che gli venga vietato donare perché è molto più probabile che un gay abbia l'HIV senza saperlo che un etero, e nonostante il sangue viene testato c'è sempre la possibilità (bassa) di falsi negativi. Detto questo, secondo me è una mezza stronzata, se uno è gay e monogano non dovrebbe avere problemi a donare, in quando non ha rapporti a rischio.

Giusto per dirvi che c'è una motivazione semi-logica dietro al divieto, non è perché il papa ha deciso che gli omosessuali devono essere discriminati in italia.

Oh okay, that is a completely different story (I thought you were talking about the thing that happened yesterday and which RT blames on Ukraine, while in fact it was done by terrorists).

Ukraine did it's best for non-violent resolution. If something like that happened on russian or American territory, the problem would be crushed in it's root, but Ukraine waited two months trying to find a non-violent resolution, and then, when war was going on, the first action of our new president was to declare a truce. Terrorists didn't respect it, so when the truce time ended, anti-terrorist operation was continued. This truce costed more than 20 lives of Ukrainian soldiers and unknown number of civilians, and caused massive protests in Kyiv against it.

Fabio (FC)

salve! volevo sapere se chi assume droghe leggere (cannabis) in quantità modiche può donare ugualmente il sangue. Oppure quanti giorni deve attendere dall'ultima assunzione prima della donazione? C'è differenza tra assunzione quotidiano o sporadica? Inoltre le chiedo se il medico può accorgersi dell'assunzione dalle analisi che si fanno per una donazione? la stessa cosa vale per il plasma o c'è differenza? cordiali saluti

Dr. Luca Boetti 	 

Le leggi che regolamentano la selezione del donatore stabiliscono che l'uso di sostanze stupefacenti per via intramuscolo o endovena controindicano la donazione per sempre anche se utilizzate una volta sola. Inoltre anche la tossicodipendenza rappresenta una controindicazione assoluta alla donazione. In caso di utilizzo saltuario e occasionale di tutte le altre droghe introdotte come compresse per via inalatoria, o sniffate l'idoneità va valutata dal medico dopo un approfondito colloquio. Deve emergere il motivo dell'assunzione. in linea di massima posso dire che un uso occasionale di mariunana non controindica la donazione.In genere io personalmente dico al donatore di aspettare almeno una settimana dal suo ultimo utilizzo. Gli esami fatti per validare la donazione sia di sangue che di plasma non prevedono il controllo degli stupefacenti. In ogni caso sono esami che possono essere effettuati solo su autorizzazione del donatore (del cittadino)

Mi sono fatto una “canna” qualche mese fa?

La cannabis è l’unica droga che determina una sospensione relativamente breve: 14 giorni. Infatti una sua assunzione saltuaria non controindica la donazione, salvo che non crei una dipendenza, inoltre, a differenza di tutti gli altri stupefacenti la sua assunzione non predispone a comportamenti a rischio.",0,1405733249,null,0,false,0,cj1ftbe,t3_2b2u2l,t1_cj1ftbe,t1_cj1eksc,null,1434786225,1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,1

true,ultimomono,5,Linea 5,"You don't say what your previous educational background is or how long you are looking to study or how long you are willing to stick around, so it's hard to know what your options are. It may be too late to look into the public universities that offer film programs in the Facultad de Ciencias de la Información--for example this one at La Complutense (where the director Amenábar studied and filmed the movie Tésis): http://pendientedemigracion.ucm.es/?a=estudios&amp;d=muestragrado3&amp;idgr=60

It looks like Séptima Ars and ECAM both offer practical ""cursos"" (which don't have any official validity as degrees in Spain or Europe) and three-year ""diplomaturas,"" which follow the old Spanish system that isn't in line with the standardized four-year EU degrees that you will find at public universities. 

It sounds like you are just looking for a ""curso"" or series of ""cursos"" which should have fewer requisites for entry, since those aren't official degrees. Why not just visit each school and talk to the folks in the secretaría and administración to see what's still available and where  you might fit in best? I'd do it asap, because everyone will be decamping until September any day now--especially at ECAM, which is semi-public and cheaper, making slots more competitive.

I'd say it all depends on what you want to get out of it. If you just want to learn and don't care about credentials, you could audit classes at a public university and pay a fraction of the cost of ECAM and Séptima Ars.

true,newappeal,advanced-english,advanced (native English),"Prepositions in German can be very complex, so I can't write out all the rules, but here are my best explanations for each sentence:

1. They sit in/on the back seat - ""auf"" with the dative has the meaning of ""on top of"". Naturally, this applies to a seat.
2. (I'm going to assume that ""bei Stadfahrten"" is supposed to be ""beim Stadtfahrten"") The driver buckled in for the drive around the city - This doesn't translate great, but in this case, ""bei"" appears to be used as it often is with verbal nouns to express continuous action. ""Beim Stadtfahren"" would normally mean ""while driving [around this city]"", but since one would buckled up *before* driving, ""for"" might be a better translation.
3. on the topic - ""zu"" usually means ""to"" or ""for"", but it generally means ""on"" or ""about"" when used with a topic or idea. ""Zu diesem Thema"" is a common phrase meaning ""On that note"", ""speaking of this"", or ""on this topic"".
4. She drives at 50 km/hr - this is idiomatic. Normally ""mit"" only means ""with"".
5. It is limited at 60 km/hr. - Pretty much the same use as English. Although ""an"" rather than ""auf"" typically means ""at"", ""an"" deals more with location.
6. It had a traffic jam as a consequence - (that's a very literally translation to illustrate the use of the preposition) ""zu"" can mean ""as"" in the sense of ""for"" in certain cases. This is similar to ""etwas zum Essen"" (""something to eat"" - lit. ""something for the eating"")
7. On the street - same use as in English
8. In my life - also same use as in English
9. All Sundays are Fridays for us - ""bei"" with people can often mean ""for"" in the sense of ""from our perspective"". Technically in this instance, ""bei uns"" could also probably mean ""where we are"", but I like using ""for us"" better. Note that it can also mean ""in the presence of"" (z.B. ""Er ist bei uns"" - ""He is with us"")

- Seems to be confusion on who possesses the black-box data recorders.

- Rebels argued among themselves whether to agree to a brief cease-fire to allow bodies of victims to be taken to morgues and about a “fuller international presence at the scene.”

- Monitors were given access to the site for 75 minutes. Rebels fired into the air. The reason is unclear.

&gt; “We’re highly interested in an unbiased and full investigation and are prepared to give unrestricted access to the spot of the crash for experts of the CIS Interstate Aviation Committee,” said separatist leader Alexander Borodai, according to the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS. Borodai was referring to the Commonwealth of Independent States, a group of former Soviet republics. Access for the committee would give Russian investigators on the scene a major role.
