&gt; In my mind this service mentality that you describe would mean that a lowering of costs would not lead to an increase in corruption. People that have public service as a motivating factor should be less likely to become more corrupt if they are being paid less.

Absolutely, but I don't believe it comes straight away. I think it comes with time and practice. I actually had a course on European public service, comparing between different models in Member States and then the EU. I really loved that course, and the materials we studied on were fascinating. We saw that actually, gratification made a huge difference. The same person you select, which starts as highly idealistic and service oriented, can turn into a sour, damaging worker very fast. We also observe that pay does not make much of difference compared with the feeling of having actually made an impact. That is why lower level/local administration employees don't mind that much lower pay: they solve peoples' problems in person, and they get immediate feedback on that.

EU civil servants though can never get there. They are too upstream to ever get a real sense of having shaped reality. Nobody will ever shake their hand and say ""Thank you for having mobilized the funds to rebuild my regional airport"". Local administrator will take the merit. Thus, taking away that sense of impact puts at odds the main motivation for service oriented people.

true,warpainter,SWED,Sweden,"Sweden

- Education: There is no denying that our universities are good and internationally respected in most areas. The fact that they are free AND that any person can finance their living expenses by means of low interest loans + €300 of free support each month is the key to our success. I have lived in several European countries and I just cannot believe why they aren't all doing this. It improves every single aspect of society and truly provides equal opportunity. The dark side is our public school system, in particular elementary school (first 9 years). It has been completely ruined by huge class sizes, slipping results, underpaid and underqualified teachers with no solution in sight. It has gotten so bad that highschool students starting engineering classes can't even do basic elementary school math. Our children today are so poorly educated that it has become a national crisis. 

- Xenophobia and racism is just as bad here as in the rest of Europe. We have quite a lot of political violence with growing fascism and neo-nazi movements. 

- The darkness. Nine months of the year are terrible. The cold is tolerable but the constant darkness really gets you down. People withdraw, grow pale, fat and stop going out. On the other end, the summers are lovely (when it doesn't rain) and having near constant sunlight is neat, shame it lasts about 1.5 months

- The social and physical distance. Swedish people are lonely. We apparently have the highest rates of singles and people living in single appartments in the world. While Italian old people sit in the piazza, laugh and drink wine, our old people go to die alone in tiny grey appartments. People who get married and have kids suddenly stop seeing their friends and spend their lives hanging out with their kids. We are socially incompetent and have a very hard time meeting new people or taking any risks. Exclusion and silence are our favourite means of communication.

- We are smug, and this isn't helped by the fact that EVERYONE else keeps telling us how great and awesome we are, especially since we already suspected as much in the first place. Scandinavians in general assume that they are the best at everything related to running countries and any other alternative is by default wrong. Outside Sweden, people praise how we made socialism work, while the truth is that we have been dismantling our welfare state over the past 20 years.

- The state monopoly. You cannot buy alcohol in supermarkets or shops. You either have to buy light beer (&lt;3.5%) in the shop or you have the bar, in which you'll pay insane prices (Beer €6, Glass of wine €9, cocktail €13). If you want bottles, you need to go to the state run store which is also very expensive and furthermore closes at 18:00 on weekdays and 15:00 on saturdays. Its awful

- Zero tolerance on all drugs. If you want weed, you better be really careful. Getting caught will have harsh consequences, not counting the social stigma associated with it still. Swedes are getting more liberal but the state isn't. 

- Exlusion and reclusion of the mentally ill. We have very poor treatment and management of this. No one wants to pay or support it financially. They are simply ignored

- Worst of all. There really only is one acceptable political discourse. There is no debate. There is the accepted social democrat/centrist point of view and anything else makes you a stupid person. Most newspapers and journalists are all employed just because they follow this view and permeate it. Part of our problem with extremsism and radicals is because people feel frustrated and angry that they cannot be anything but the norm, which is a universal thing in Sweden. Understand this correctly thought, it isn't the state that prevents your from expressing your opinion, it's social pressure from your friends, neighbours and colleagues",0,1402666500,null,0,1402666877,0,ci6j2g7,t3_280hss,t1_ci6j2g7,t3_280hss,null,1434221240,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

È bello per quanto riguarda la grafica, le meccaniche di gioco e l'immersività della storia (anche se ogni tanto le cutscene interminabile piazzata proprio quando avevi iniziato a carburare spaccano le palle) ma il sistema di salvataggio è rimasto troppo ""hardcore"" e spesso mi è capitato, per impegni vari, di dovere staccare e conseguentemente di perdere ore di gioco.

Because I will do it my mother when it comes to that. Why should I do her job as well as my future one? Besides, it is cruel to get an old person out of the circumstances she is used to, into a new, foreign environment. When you are 85 and became totally rigid would you want to get used to a new environment where you cannot even speak the language? Besides, I work and we look after a little baby, isn't it easier for a retired person who has no responsibilities to look after the elderly parent? Normally generations are spaced so that by the time you have to care for your parents, you no longer have to care for your  own kids, obviously.

&gt;Or send some of your higher earnings to your mother so that she can look after her?

I don't understand it. She would _save_ money by looking after grandma. Putting her in a retirement home _costs_ money. It is obvious, how it is not? I would send money if she would need it, but dad left her some money so it is not necessary (and she is too proud to accept it) and does not relate to the question because it is not money that is missing but more like the patience for the work of nursing. Nursing saves money, when we have to pay a retirement home that obviously costs money. (The state owned ones cost 75% of the pension of the elderly person here and the city owned ones I guess 90%. The logic is that once someone is in a retirement home they don't really need most of their pension... at least that is how the system thinks.)

Intuitive and creative does not mean an unreadable mess. It means finding solutions for overcoming limitations of your tools, which happens in the fields that use domain-specific, not general purpose languages and tools. Talk with SAP guys sometimes or Navisionistas.

Structure does not mean engineering. Good structure is usually a similarly intuitive and creative thing - like structuring an essay. Structure cannot really be engineered - rather, it is a much more intutive process, forcing you to think about what are you actually expressing and achieving. Engineering usually means applying mathemathical models to problems, that is more mechanical.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"Well, the reasons why gossip columns do so well is because they easily attract a lot of views and then companies pay to have advertisements near the article. With this model, there could be a lot of high quality political and financial blogs (I wish there was a less degrading term than 'blog') by individual journalists, because they would charge for their articles to be read, rather than focusing on add revenue. 

One of the main reasons for the fall in newspaper readership, identified by editors and the like, is that people aren't willing to pay for what they don't consider to be valuable. If you can tailor your news diet to precisely what you want, then you are going to considering it a lot more valuable than buying *en masse* what the Guardian has already selected for you in its print edition that day or on the New York Times' website that day. 

I know when I buy a newspaper (especially if it is a national, rather than international, newspaper) then ignore about half the articles because they are about things I have no interest in: 'shocking' court verdicts, the latest irrelevant blunder of government, some new medicine that has been invented but will likely come to nothing, et cetera. If I could pay for a newspaper without all of these things I happily would, and with a news diet tailored to my values, I could. Given that this problem seems to be a large factor in readership decline, the tailoring approach could be the solution. 

I do think that already existing newspaper outlets could play a formative role in this. They could provide a forum for individuals to subscribe to specific journalists, and therefor lend their legitimacy to these journalists. As such, they could also take somewhat of a roll in salary redistribution in order to ensure that no journalist starves when whilst they are starting out. Effectively, it could be virtually exactly the same as the system is now. The only difference, would be that you only pay for what you want, and will read. And the greater degree of journalistic freedom should, necessarily, lead to a greater diversity of good content.

I agree that they deserve this money but it is really extreme. Most business managers are entirely normal people, jovial 50 years average guys who go fishing in the weekend, not murderous psychopaths.

I mean the problem is that if you say ""companies do this and this"" it sounds like a machine without a soul. But actually real people do the decisions. If that was arranged, someone would give the order to do so. Not a company would do it but a person. And seriously, I never met such a person in business. 

I actually think - not a very popular idea on Reddit I know - that it is not true that psychopaths are succesful. Most workplaces depend on competition outside but  cooperation inside.

&gt;Another Gulfstream V, N596GA, manufacturers serial number 596, has also been mentioned in print as a possible transport for the CIA program of extraordinary rendition. Author Dave Willis wrote in Air Forces Monthly in May 2008 that this airframe, ordered in 1999 by the United States Air Force as a C-37A, serial 99-0405, was rolled out as N596GA but only briefly took up its military serial before reverting to the civil registration, issued on September 20, 2001, nine days after the 9-11 attacks. It was registered to National Aircraft Leasing of Greenville, New Castle County in Delaware, ""and is believed to have been used by the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation Systems (JPATS), managed by the U.S. Marshals Service. JPATS is responsible for moving prisoners and non-US citizen criminals around and has its own fleet of aircraft, as well as frequently leasing others. N596GA is also said to have been used in the CIA's programme of extraordinary rendition against terrorist subjects.""[21]

&gt;The author also mentions N379P, of Premiere Executive Transport Services, (later N8068V and N44982), and its alleged use in rendition missions.

&gt;As of at least June 24, 2011, this Gulfstream V, c/n 596, flies as N977GA, registered to the United States Department of Justice. On the aforementioned date, this aircraft was dispatched to California to retrieve fugitive New England crime boss ""Jimmy"" Bulger and his girlfriend Catherine Greig, transporting them to Boston's Logan International Airport.

&gt;On October 5, 2012, together with a privately owned Dassault Falcon 900 (N331MC), the two planes[22] carried terror suspects Abu Hamza, Babar Ahmad, Syed Ahsan, Khaled Al-Fawwaz and Adel Abdul Bary to the United States to face trial after losing their last-ditch attempt to stay in Britain.

Yes, but with the implication that once decided, no one can say that the legislative output of the Commission doesn't represent them. Best to get it out of the way early, rather than rehashing it every other bill, I think.

&gt;In a way the European Council is stronger because they have a positive, constructive power (they can make all kinds of different proposals)

Borders can be subject to change and there need not be terrible difficulties. In my own life-time I have seen significant changes to borders, e.g. merging of E and W Germany, break up of USSR, Czechoslovakia, Hong Kong reverting to China etc. 

There are practical questions, but we should not be afraid of them. For example, if Scotland becomes independent, the arrangement is likely to be that there will be free movement both sides of the border, the option for all Scots to continue with UK citizenship and so forth, the option for Scots living in the UK to vote in UK general elections and so forth, just like Ireland.

Similarly, if UK leaves the EU I think sensible arrangements can easily be made.

I combatted it with a better generalization that it is perfectly possible to know them and yet reject them, because they are more to subjective taste and not objectively better.

I don't believe in sweeping generalizations, but I use them to correct even worse ones.

Seriously? You have a vivid imagination.

&gt;by saying that the duty to help stops at exactly the point at which you would have to get off your arse and do it yourself

You are really dense. I said I will do my job in _my turn_. How is it hard?  Why would I have to get off my arse and do another one's job when I am ready to do mine when it is my turn?

&gt;It's only ""their"" (your mum's) ""job"" because you decided that it should be, it's not written anywhere that the responsibility for looking after your parents is down to you and only you.

It has always been so, because then it makes sure that everybody has one turn and not someone two, and because younger folks need to focus on their own childrne first.

&gt;and the member of the family that is most able to bear the burden of it should put themselves forward and take it on

That is the same result - I am not retired, I have a small child. She is retired, has no responsibilities all day. The reason it is traditionally so that people care for their own parents is because they are the most able, because they are of the right age and stage in life.

&gt;Given that you've said that you earn considerably more money than your mum, have a wife at home to help, as well as live in a wealthy Western country/city with undoubtedly better health and social care than where your grandma currently lives in Hungary - it would seem that person is you. :)

I seriously don't understand you. Are we speaking the same language? Money has nothing to do with it - you cannot wipe an elderly persons ass with money! Well I guess you can but it is counter productive, heh. It takes patience and time. Money it costs zero, almost. Just patience and time. In fact money wise it is even positive because it is cheaper than retirement homes. They earn pension but spend little. They are like a toddler. You just have to bathe them and feed them and look after that they don't blow up the house by doing something funny in the kitchen.  With me working and wife babycaring, we don't have time, while my mother has nothing to do, retired and alone. If it could be solved by money I would have solved it long ago. But it takes time, not money and we have zero free time and she has all day. I don't understand the point of me living in a Western country - would you take an elderly person out of her usual environment? That would be super cruel. Seriously think about it how crazy it would be. I am not even sure she is aware foreign languages exist as she is kind of demented and we dub all TV shows...  and just what the heck is social care? What it is about? Normally elderly people are just at home and like make cakes and play with the great-grandkids as long as they cane get out of bed. I am afraid social care is like a retirement home? I mean elderly people belong to the family obviously. Healthcare I dunno, when she gets ill we will think about it, so far she needs no medicine or nothing, has no complaints. But even that time when she gets ill should I put her in a hospital where they speak German? She would be scared shitless. Seriously that is cruel.

I know if I don't eat when I get initial hunger pangs, I over eat later.  In addition to this, if I don't eat when I initially feel hungry, the physical hunger signals turn become a mood drop, and I am more anxious, depressed, and aggressive. A way to avoid this mood drop, and the eventual overeating that will come, is to eat within half an hour of feeling hungry.  But usually I get hungry when I'm in a class that I'm not allowed to eat in because of the chemicals in the room... we get a 10 minute break, I have to smoke a cigarette.  It's not enough time to buy a little bag of nuts and a banana, and eat and smoke ... usually the smoking wins. What can I do to get around this?  If I come prepared with quinoa or a smoothie or something (things I like to eat), maybe I'll have more time to smoke and eat (I don't need to eat a lot, just a few mouthfuls to honour that hunger right now so I don't panic and overeat later).  I tell my dietitian that I brought nuts to school today, but I still smoked instead of eating.  For some reason I don't eat while I smoking.  Okay, so maybe during class I could pop out into the hall for a minute and eat a bit of food -- and I say Oh no no.  I couldn't do that.  I wouldn't feel good about that.  Then we examine why I wouldn't feel good about that (fear of judgement from my classmates, even if they don't know.  self judgement.  basically my brain fills with all of the fat rage you see on reddit, but directed towards myself.  like my desire not to be seen as a fat person who has to eat all the time -- even though, according to my body, eating little bits more often rather than one meal a day is what I need -- trumps the things I need to do in order to stop habitual over eating).  Logically, I know that doesn't make sense - but I need to work through that negative thought cycle with someone in order to overcome it.  So I say, okay yeah that doesn't make sense.  This week I will work on bringing prepared food to class and eating a little bit of it when I feel hungry, whatever that looks like.  Next appointment we talk about how that felt, if it went well, what other barriers I encountered.

**Océan massive découverte près du noyau de la Terre**

Un réservoir d'eau trois fois le volume de tous les océans a été découvert en profondeur en dessous de la surface de la Terre. Le résultat pourrait aider à expliquer d'où provient les mers de la Terre.

L'eau est cachée dans une roche bleue appelée la ringwoodite qui est située 700 kilomètres sous terre dans le manteau, la couche de roche chaude entre la surface de la Terre et son noyau.

La grande taille du réservoir met de la lumière sur l'origine de l'eau sur Terre. Certains géologues pensent que l'eau est arrivée dans des comètes qui ont frappé la planète, mais la nouvelle découverte supporte une idée alternative que les océans ont graduellement suinter de l'intérieur de l'ancienne Terre.

""C'est une bonne preuve que l'eau sur Terre provient de là-dedans,"" dit Steven Jacobsen de Northwestern University à Evanston, Illinois. L'eau cachée pourrait aussi agir en tant que tampon pour les océans sur la surface, ce qui explique pourquoi elles sont restée la même taille depuis des millions d'années.

**Pinguer la planète**

L'équipe de Jacobsen s'est servie de 2000 sismographes à étudier les ondes sismiques générées par plus de 500 tremblements de terre. Ces ondes se déplace partout à travers l’intérieur de la Terre, y compris le noyau, et peuvent être détectées à la surface. ""Elles font résonner la Terre comme une cloche pendant des jours après,"" dit Jacobsen.

En mesurant la vitesse des ondes à différentes profondeurs, l'équipe était capable de discerner quel types de roches à travers lesquelles les ondes passaient. La couche d'eau s'est révélé parce que les ondes ont ralenti, vu que cela les prend plus de temps à passer à travers la roche détrempée que la roche sèche.

Jacobsen a calculé en avance ce qui se produirait aux ondes si de la ringwoodite hydratée était présente. Il a fait pousser de la ringwoodite dans son labo, et a fait subir à quelques échantillons des pressions massives et des températures comparable à ceux qui se trouvent à 700 kilomètres de profond.

Sans surprise, ils ont trouvé des indices de ringwoodite mouillée dans la zone de transition à 700 kilomètres profond, ce qui divise les régions supérieures et inférieures du manteau. À cette profondeur, les pressions et les températures réussissent à presser l'eau de la ringwoodite. ""C'est de la roche avec de l'eau le long des bornes entre les grains, presque comme si elles suaient,"" dit Jacobsen.


**Mouillé en bas**

La découverte de Jacobsen supporte une étude récente par Graham Pearson de l'Université d'Alberta à Edmonton, Canada. Pearson a étudié un diamant de la zone de transition qui a été porté à la surface dans un vulcan, et a trouvé qu'il contenaient de la ringwoodite hydratée, la première preuve forte qu'il y avait beaucoup d'eau dans la zone de transition (Nature, doi.org/s6h).

""Depuis notre rapport initial de ringwoodite hydratée, nous avons trouvé un autre cristal de ringwoodite, qui contient aussi de l'eau, donc la preuve est maintenant très forte,"" dit Pearson.

À date, Jacobsen a seulement des preuves que la roche mouillé est située en dessous des EU. il veut maintenant découvrir si elle enveloppe la planète entière.

""Nous devrions être reconnaissants d'avoir ce réservoir profond,"" dit Jacobsen. ""s'il n'etait pas là, l'eau serait sur la surface de la Terre, et seuls les sommets des montagnes seraient visibles au dessus de l'eau.""

Sadly, strikes are a fact of life in France, but don't let it get you down.

According to Air France at http://www.airfrance.fr/FR/en/local/information/news/news-air-traffic-air-france.htm the strike is only for ramp crew. I don't think buses will be impacted. I used the AF bus a couple of times, they're very convenient if you're going near one of their stops in Paris.

Or, if you want to be 100% sure, you can reserve a shuttle or limo. For a shuttle, see e.g. SuperShuttle at http://en.supershuttle.fr (in English). I used then once, it was fine. My only concern is I asked for child seats and they didn't provide any, so you may want to double check with them (they claim they provide them for free).

Or Google VTC CDG as recommended. (VTC means Voiture de Tourisme avec Chauffeur, so what we would call limo/black car in the US, but they may not be as luxurious as your typical Lincoln).

Fair enough.

&gt;Given that the debate was entirely irrelevant to anyone but a small minority of the UK population (UKIP and the Conservatives belong to groups not involved in the debate and Labour did not endorse Schulz, mention the EU in any significant way in their manifesto and told Schulz not to come to the UK to campaign), this decision by the BBC strikes me as the correct one.

Ehh, if the S&amp;D were the largest party, I'm sure that Labour MEPs would have voted for him (as much as the Labour party don't like Schulz they like Junker and Verhofstadt less).

true,Luk0sch,NRWW,Nordrhein-Westfalen,"Ich find halt nicht die Aktion kritikwürdig sondern Wasserwerfer und deren Nutzung an sich. Der Shitstorm, bei dem wir uns einig sind das sowas einfach nicht richtig ist, entläd sich an der falschen Stelle meiner Meinung nach.

Geht auf die Straße und demonstriert friedlich gegen Gewalt seitens der Polizei, schreibt Beschwerden (mit Argumenten) und tut sonst was aber hängt euch nicht an einer Aktion auf die bestenfalls eine Randerscheinung des Themas ist und die an sich auch nicht Gewalttätig ist.

Viel mehr hat die Polizei halt auch einfach nicht zu verlosen, wenn es nicht auf Krimskrams wie Tassen hinauslaufen soll. Eine Fahrt im Streifenwagen (als Fahrer nicht Beifahrer) zum Beispiel würde ja auch nur auf einem Übungsgelände stattfinden können und wäre wesentlich langweiliger.

So wie sich mir die Situation darstellt hat die Polizei in dieser Situation nichts Falsches oder Schlechtes getan. Dabei mein ich nicht was vorher oder nachher war bzw. sein wird. Viel mehr haben sie versucht mit ihren Möglichkeiten etwas Außergewöhnliches anzubieten. In der Bewertung dessen wird von den meisten die auch etwas dazu Schreiben allerdings nicht die Situation betrachtet sondern alle schlechten Erfahrungen und Vorurteile kommen zusammen und verschwimmen die Sicht. Was soll die sächsische Polizei denn daraus ziehen? Bieten wir besser nichts mehr an, wir kriegens eh nur drauf? Das ist doch quatsch. Gegen Wasserwerfer kann man jederzeit vorgehen, mit (friedlichen!) Demos, Beschwerden, Artikeln etc. aber die Mehrheit regt sich nur eben schnell bei sowas auf. Was soll das bringen?

Die Polizei zeigt hier meiner Meinung nach guten Willen auch wenn das Mittel der Wahl auf den ersten Blick doch sehr seltsam erscheint. Das sollten wir eigentlich honorieren. Für einen Polizisten ist so ein Ding ein Mittel um die Ordnung herzustellen und sich und die Kollegen zu verteidigen. Ja, das wird oft missbraucht aber stell dir bitte vor du müsstest 2000 Leute überblicken und 200 fangen an aggressiv zu werden und z.B. Steine zu werfen. Du stehst unter Stress und dann benutzt du das Teil halt.

Ich glaube es ist ein wenig wirr worauf ich letztendlich hinauswill, hab auch leider nicht mehr die Zeit das groß aus zu formulieren aber was ich im großen und ganzen sagen will ist: Polizisten sind auch nur Menschen und wir verteufeln sie viel zu oft.

I understand this argument, but I don't think it is necessarily the case that there will be more competition and coverage in 2018/2019.

Anyhoo, I should piggy back off this (sports interjections). In English in tennis, we shout *COME ON* after winning close points. Like a way of motivating ourselves. Equivalent to LET'S GO! ALRIGHT! YES! etc.

Most of the players on the pro tour say this, even the ones who have poor English.

What would a German speaking German say? Federer, a Swiss-German player, sometimes uses *Chum jetze!*,^1 but that's of course a Swiss-German thing.

I realize it's the Swiss pronunciation of *Komm jetzt*, but not sure if it also is used the same way in German German (to the extent we can even say a slang is part of, I guess, some pan-Germany German).

- no statements on personal objective or whatever

- bullet points should speak for themselves (not very fleshed out, just stating for example your degree, university and which years you studied.)

- The CV is always accompanied with a cover letter where you for example state your goals and how they align with the position you're applying for

Look up as many German CV's as you can, there are inter-European differences so you need ot be specific to Germany! If the job ad is in German and nothing else is stated, you'll need to apply in German. If the ad is in English or explicitly stated, English is fine.

Hat jemand eine online einsehbare Primärquelle für diese Behauptungen?

Nach den Zitaten im SZ-Artikel scheint es da durchaus Spielraum für Interpretationen zu geben:
&gt; Seit 2004 erfassen die Forscher gesondert die Ablehnung von Muslimen; sie ist in auch diesem Jahr weitergestiegen. Nur noch weniger als die Hälfte (von einst knapp zwei Dritteln) der Befragten sagen heute, der Islam habe eine ""bewundernswerte Kultur hervorgebracht"".

Meiner Meinung nach ist ""keine Bewunderung"" und ""Ablehnung"" gleichzusetzen schon ziemlich weit aus dem Fenster gelehnt.

There is no anti-semitism. No one cares if you're a Jew or not. Yes in some poor neighborhood you can see graffiti like ""dirty jews"", but you can also see ""thief gipsies"" and other such things. Just like how you can see same things about Arabs in Amsterdam.

There are around 100 thousand Jews living in the capital Budapest, they have their own sinagogues, cemetaries etc. They hold their own festivals, I think 3 weeks ago there was a large concert with bands from Israel coming etc.

When people talk about anti-semitism they mostly mean stuff like diminishing the responsibility that Hungary had in WW2. Hungarians like to think that the deportation of 600 thousand Jews to Auschwitz was the work of Germans, but in reality the Hungarian police fully cooperated with the Nazi occupators.

Journalists are not being prosecuted. There is a belief that journalists are supposed to write about whatever they like, freedom of press etc. The reality is that they have a job that they have to do in order to get money, which they need for stuff like food and mortgage. Journalists have a wide array of newspapers to choose from where they may work. In fact there are more left-leaning media than pro-government. The most popular news site is index.hu and it's leftist, then there's also origo.hu etc. Journalists who feel they are liberals should try and get a job in these or similar places.        
The problem is the majority of people in Hungary do not share the view of these leftist media, so there's a smaller audience, less money, less jobs... Like I said, the most popular news website is leftist, but most people don't watch internet at work, they work in factories, shops or on the farm, so it's only popular among office workers and students, the same group of people that visits reddit. I used to read it for some time since it really does beat other news sites in quality and speed, but I got sick from their propaganda and moved over to Origo.hu, which is a bit more balanced in my opinion.       
Since there's less audience than in the rightist media, the liberal journalists must either choose to tone down their voice in exchange for making a living, or they may emigrate to London to wash dishes and complain about oppression in their home country.     

Nationalism was pretty low before compared to the neighboring countries. Hungary was the only country among all of its neighbors that didn't grant citizenship to all ethnic Hungarians in the world, until 2010. I would rather say that nationalism went back to a ""normal"" level, the same where the other countries in the region are.    
Why? One reason for example is the Slovak government in 2006-2010 which routinely opressed its ethnic Hungarian minority and the socialist government at the time (and also the EU) didn't do anything about it, saying it's another country's internal matter. This angered a lot of people.       
And of course you have the usual reason of economic crisis which makes people angry.

Why did people again vote for this government? There was basically a choice between them, and the socialists. The socialists fucked up big time, they presented the same people that were in the despised 2006-2010 government, which already lost once hugely, and they of course lost again with a similar percentage. So it was a choice between two evils.",1,1402685460,null,0,false,0,ci6s0kk,t3_28295m,t1_ci6s0kk,t1_ci6qtp2,null,1434225534,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

The immigrant has responsibilities beyond just learning the language (which many don't even do). Immigration is a privilege based on this assumption, it's not a right.

true,LordGravewish,PORT,Portugal,"**tl;dr** from the last page (emphasis mine):

&gt;The EU’s critics claim that its rules do little to enhance British trade with the continent, that they hold back Britain’s economy and that they limit its trade with fast-growing economies outside Europe.

&gt;Yet this report shows that **trade, investment and financial flows between Britain and the continent are much larger than would be the case if the single market did not exist**. It finds that **EU rules do little damage to Britain’s economy** and that they do not account for its lacklustre trade with emerging economies.

&gt;If Britain voted to leave the EU, it would face an invidious choice in the subsequent negotiations: *full access to the European single market, with little influence on the rules that govern it*; or *freedom from those rules, with less access to the market*.

And a very important paragraph from the conclusion:

&gt;*The alternatives to EU membership are unsatisfactory*: they either give Britain **less control over regulation** than it currently enjoys, *or* they offer **more control but less market access**.

This report was made by the Center For European Reform (a British Think-Tank), under partnership with [BT](http://home.bt.com/), [TheCityUK](http://www.thecityuk.com/), [DIAGEO](http://www.diageo.com/) and [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/). It's hard to say that it's biased, as 3 out of those are British companies/bodies, and IBM is American (the EU didn't even go so far as *touching* this report), but I'd love to see you guys try.

&gt; Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said Hungary was the sole country on the Commission’s excessive deficit ‘caution list’ and warned that cohesion funds could be frozen if Budapest fails to trim its deficit.

/u/DraGulasch posted an excellent article on this a few hours ago: http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/4913

&gt; Additionally, a 500 million “cohesion fund” given to new members is about to be terminated because the deficit will exceed the mandated 3% of the GDP. 

&gt; That deficit might be a case that space allows to handle. Hungary’s went from 4.6% in 2009 to 4.2 in ’10, and then it dropped to 3.6, and will be 2.8 this year. This year Belgium will have 4.6, Denmark 4.5, France 5.3, Ireland 8.6, Romania 3.7, Slovakia 4.9, and the Czechs 3.8%. Spain scored in 2011 8.5 and is lobbying to be above 5% this year. None face public flogging. 

The socialist government that ruled Hungary between 2002-2010 *never* went below 3% deficit. When Hungary entered the EU, a few months after that an over-deficit procedure was started against Hungary which means less access to funds etc.     
As soon as the new government took over in 2010 they started a program to push the deficit below 3% and they did that successfully, and in 2013, for the first time since Hungary joined the EU, the over-deficit procedure was liften.

So what you have here is a socialist government that failed to do anything right for 8 years and the EU was 'ok' with it. And you have a center-right government which immediately starts to push the deficit down, succeeds in doing it, and the EU threatens to punish it because it _believes_ the deficit will be above 3%.     
As history has proven it since, the EU was wrong, it was below 3%.

L'etica e la giustizia sociale sono state logorate da quei partiti che hanno avuto in seno politici criminali, o politici che hanno abusato del sistema nei limiti legali, sottraendo risorse al paese e abbassando la qualità sociale dell'Italia. Questi individui hanno fatto scemio della giustizia; da Craxi a Berlusconi passando per la DC e la sinistra, instaurando due classi di cittadini come ai tempi degli antichi romani: patrizi e plebei, cioè ricchi e poveri, cioè privilegiati e sfigati.

La politica di oggi è stata viziata e condizionata a tal pundo da stracciare ogni parvenza di discrezione nel proprio operato: se prima ribavano e si dimettevano quando venivano scoperti, ora robano vengono scoperti e ritornano al proprio posto di lavoro come se niente fosse accaduto (guarda il caso di Orsoni a Venezia).
Infatti possiamo dire che la politica di oggi abbia rimpiazzato l'aristocrazia, specialmente quella borbonica, poichè i politici non stanno servendo più i cittadini ma gli interessi propri. E i fatti parlano da se quando l'Italia scivola di posto nella classifica sulla corruzione e sulla libertà di stampa. Qualitativamente stiamo scadendo e stiamo trasformandoci in quei paesi sud americani di trenta o quaranta anni fa; corrotti e bigotti.

Tu confonds les chambres à gaz et les fours crématoires ? C'est à la limite du négationnisme ce genre d'erreurs...

&gt;L'ambigüité et la pluralité de définitions alternatives pour un même mot sont l'essence même des calembours, doubles sens et autres jeux de mots, art auquel je dois reconnaître qu'il excelle.

Ce que vous faites s'appelle un procès d'intention, ou un double standard. 

Personne n'a utilisé ""fournée"" dans le sens que vous lui portez (en parlant des fours crématoires). La définition pour les êtres humains a toujours été relative à un ensemble de gens à qui l'on fait subir un même sort ou qui participent à un même mouvement, donc jamais rien à voir avec le four.

Dans quelles conditions peut-on utiliser le mot ""fournée"" ? Est-ce réservé à certaines personnes ? À chaque fois que JMLP utilise ce mot, vous supposerez qu'il s'agit d'un calembour ?

JMLP doit donc retirer de son vocabulaire tout ce qui a trait au four ? Au gaz ? Aux chambres ? Au chaud ?

Bref, si vous en êtes à ce niveau abyssal pour faire des faux procès à JMLP, vous devez être désespérés...

Tiens à propos de faux procès :

L'Ane vint à son tour et dit : J'ai souvenance     
Qu'en un pré de Moines passant,      
La faim, l'occasion, l'herbe tendre, et je pense      
Quelque diable aussi me poussant,      
Je tondis de ce pré la largeur de ma langue.      
Je n'en avais nul droit, puisqu'il faut parler net.      
A ces mots on cria haro sur le baudet.      
Un Loup quelque peu clerc prouva par sa harangue      
Qu'il fallait dévouer ce maudit animal,      
Ce pelé, ce galeux, d'où venait tout leur mal.      
Sa peccadille fut jugée un cas pendable.

But you're basically ignoring centuries of European history which progressively reduced the influence of the Church. The only reason why many European children with Christian parents don't always become faithful Christians themselves is because we live in a secularist society. And it has nothing to do with the inner values of Christianity. It's the result of many wars, revolutions and laws.

You should have a look at Christian societies outside of Europe, for instance in Brazil or in some countries in West Africa.

true,mcctaggart,null,null,"I think it is relevant to highlight the concentration of these Muslim populations.

In Europe, Belgium and the Netherlands have some of the largest Muslim communities in the European Union, in percentage terms.

Belgium is home to an estimated 650,000 Muslims, or around 6% of the overall population, based on an average of several statistical estimates. 

The number of Muslims in Brussels though —where roughly half of the number of Muslims in Belgium currently live—has reached 300,000, which means that the self-styled ""Capital of Europe"" is now one of the most Islamic cities in Europe (26% of the population).

The Netherlands is home to an estimated 925,000 Muslims, which also works out to around 6% of the overall population. Within the EU, only France (7.5%) has more Muslims in relative terms.

Muslim populations percentages: Rotterdam (25%), Amsterdam (24%), Antwerp (17%), The Hague (14%) and Utrecht (13%), according to a panoply of research.

London's Muslim population is 12.5% and growing. Some areas like Tower Hamlets it is 30%. The muslim population of the UK has doubled every 10 years since the 1950's.

Je ne crois pas non. La plupart des gens ne connaissent pas JMLP ni ses vidéos hebdomadaires.

Les deux pauvres cons de la semaine étaient Bedos et Madonna, Marie d'Herbais a ajouté les noms de Noah et Bruel, et JMLP propose d'en parler la fois suivante en utilisant ce mot qui n'a aucune connotation antisémite et n'en n'a jamais eu.

MLP a bien précisé que les paroles n'avaient rien d'antisémite.

true,Gehalgod,advanced-other,DE--&gt;EN Translation Student,"Because the accent of a second language is very difficult to master, I suppose that mastering it can be a sign of how dedicated one is to the language. I think it can unconsciously direct conversation.

For example, in college I had these two professors from Eastern Europe. One was from The Czech Republic and spoke with a very thick accent, and the other was from Russia and spoke with an accent that was hardly noticeable. I would often catch myself using simpler language or talking more slowly to the Czech professor, presumably because his extremely thick accent gave me the idea that his English was bad and that I needed to modify my speech for him. In actuality, his English wasn't really worse than that of my Russian professor. His accent was just thicker. As much as I hate to admit it, the heavy accent affected the way I treated him.

So yeah, if I were going to live in a German-speaking country I would want to sound as ""German"" as possible. I say this under the assumption that I'm never going to *completely* lose my American accent, and I will always sound foreign enough for Germans to identify me as ""not German"".

Having said that, I'm not sure that accent should ever be the primary aspect of learning another language. Ultimately, some people have the ability to assimilate to various accents while others just don't have a talent for it. An acquaintance of mine in college could speak at a basic conversational level in multiple languages and was overall a very decent language learner, but he always sounded patently American and could never quite keep that American accent in check.

TL;DR -- I don't think a person's linguistic ability should ever be measured based on the thickness of their accent, but I have a feeling that it nevertheless affects discourse.

The advice of all the others on this thread is great (during strikes there are about 1 in 3 trains, so overcrowding but transport is possible). 

I just wanted to say that if I were you I would treat this is a positive cultural experience! Strikes are a relatively regular part of French life, people here really want to fight to keep their work and social benefits, and life is less stressful and more pleasant for your average minimum wage worker as a direct result ;) Even if it will probably make your trip less practical try to have an open mind – striking is part of the french psyche, defending rights which were hard earned over years is something which I can respect, even if I do sometimes think the strikes are a bit over-the-top. It will be a great story to talk about too ! The first time I was in France there was a train strike (I was on a school trip) and we got stranded for 4 hours in a train station in the mountains. Talking with people during that experience helped me understand French people and their way of approaching life and work much more, and ultimately gave me a great story to tell!

With a direct vote the winning candidate is forced to go into coalitions with other parties and I think on the European level this is quite important to find good compromises between all these different interests. Personally I would prefer a similar political system like in Switzerland for the European Union, where the Federal Council has to represent all major parties and certain language groups. 

I am very much in favour of strengthening the EP, but sceptical about direct elections. The EP elections should be there to decide about the weighting of the different parties in the commission and the legislative like it happens in Switzerland on the federal level. However I am also sceptical about referendums on the EU level. They are too easy to manipulate and also lead to unnecessary divions. But that's exactly the opposite of what Europe needs.

The tricky part is that you have to know the person well enough so that they trust you and know you dont wanna screw them over or bust them. I would think that the best way, if you really dont know anyone is, to become a regular in a club where you think drugs are taken. Try to get in contact with people and if you can pull it off without sounding like an idiot you can be pretty blunt about it. I scored some nights just because i asked the guy next to me at the bar in the club i was at the time if he new anyone who would sell speed. He pointed me to a guy on a table and that was that.

Please explain how this constitutes a power grab **via shady circumstances**. The fact that the EUParl *elects* the Commission President (whereas the Council *proposes* the president) is what is written in the treaties, and look at any country (including the UK, the Council would be the Queen) to see how this is supposed to work (tip: The one who proposes the candidate to Parliament has no real choice on the matter - they're supposed to choose the leader of the party who won the votes, and if they can't get majority then travel down to the rest of the party leaders. Only if no party can manage to build a government should compromise candidates who aren't the party leaders but can build a majority be proposed).

Also, the EUParl has more *EU-wide legitimacy* right now (it was just elected through universal EU suffrage, so they currently represent the EU as a whole much better) than the governments of the very small number of countries who want the status quo - where they're the ones who pick the Commission president through a closed-doors backroom deal *via shady circumstances*.

The system might not be perfect, but it's much better than what there was before - I'm tired of everything in the EU, including its leadership being decided behind closed doors in the Council where only a few countries (Germany, France, UK mostly) have a real say.",0,1402704410,null,0,1402705167,0,ci70ndy,t3_281782,t1_ci70ndy,t1_ci6fp4w,null,1434229728,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Showing this consistently and with words of well-known gender would get the point across well. Then just a few are special, and the rest use nominative except for a small difference. Then there's just a few you'd need to notice can use either but it's not hard to notice if people learn the others well.

With adjectives, if there's no ending on an article or there's no article to have one, put it on the adjective, otherwise use -e for nominative, -en for everything that isn't the nominative ending, or is plural. With the cases above, those certain prepositions just have the dative case so then you use the -en, and the other ones are nominative with the weird masculine, so since the masculine is weird that also uses -en instead of -e like all the regular nominative uses.

true,MadeInWestGermany,null,null,"Depends on the drugs you are searching for. *A friend of a friend* told me, that Marijuana is always available arround students. So i would go to a (little bit shady/cheaper) club at a tuesday or wednesday night. Just ask other students where you can find one, or google it. Someone smokes outside.
When it's warm, you could also go to a park, river or lake. There are always groups that smoke. Ask to join them and maybe you are lucky. There are also often some Rastafari guys etc that sell, but be careful. Sometimes even the German cops are awake. Honestly, you'll get Marijuana everywhere.

For chemical drugs it's a little bit more difficult, because the dealer are more suspisious and it's a night drug. I don't do that stuff myself, but some of my friends. You can get everything arround your city's main train station. Sounds racist, but some black guys there will help you if you walk arround a little bit and look *searching*. There are always cops by the way, so it wouldn't be riskless. They sometimes have more rights arround train stations. To search your pockets for example.

It is easier in the typical clubs/discos. Cocain in the expensive clubs, Speed in the ordinary ones. Just observe the people and their behavior. You could ask if they don't look to agressive.

The fastest way in a new town in my opinion is, to ask a cop in which parts of the city you shouldn't go. They tell you where it is dangerous/shady, and then... you'll go there. Walk arround till someones asks or makes eyecontact. If the area is too shady, they only sell H, so be carefull. You shouldn't do that at night btw. or if you look like a race that isn't well liked in that area. Depends on the City.

That trick works also if you just google for drug problems in the city. They mention the bad areas in the article. Lebanese Dönerläden and things like that often have a *second business* if the guys there look young. It isn't a big deal to ask younger people. They won't really call the cops. Maybe just curse or something.

However, as you might know, chemical drugs are dangerous. You don't know what you'll get, the people on Speed etc are often agressive and it is pretty illegal here. Do not cross any borders with it.

Personally i think the best idea would be the students club / marijuana plan. The people are pretty open and harmless.

But who i am to judge, i hope you'll find what you are searching for. Have fun.

Edit: Just to be clear, Germany isn't that dangerous and you most likely won't be killed anywhere. But of course you can still get problems, be mugged etc. I think you know what i'm talking about, dealers aren't exactly righteous people.

Je ne vois pas comment ils pourraient en extraire plus que Saddam après l'invasion, mais la grosse différence n'est-elle pas que les US achètent maintenant ce pétrole à des compagnies américaines en Irak (Exxonmobil notamment) ?

true,AuroricFlame,DENK,Denmark,"This may be smug or arrogant but I don't think there's a country doing things better than we are in Denmark, but just because something is better than bad doesn't mean it's perfect, at all. Of course Scandinavia is no utopia, paradise or fully-realized society, but by most measurements other countries (to us) are just awfully backwards.

But without further ado, here's what I consider to be some bad things about Denmark:

- The obvious: If you're a fan of a calm, sunny, hot and arid climate or mountains this probably isn't the place you want to go to. Real summer temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius are usually only reached in ~8 weeks total from late may to early September. It does look like this number is on the rise, though.
In winter, it can be really dark, but again: Only about two to three weeks with real snow total. The rest is bitter cold, but it's perfectly manageable with the right clothing. Some people claim to have ""Winter depression"" from the very short days (in terms of sunlight), but really most people just focus on doing indoor stuff instead.
Autumn and spring are usually very windy and overall the weather is quite shifty with temperatures around 10 to 15 degrees celcius.

- The alcohol culture is very forced and for someone like me who don't drink it can be a bit stigmatizing seeing as it's not seen as socially acceptable to be at larger social gatherings (if you're over 13-15, at least) without some form of alcohol consumption (whether symbolic or not). I guess it's just the only way to get some people going out of their shell, and has since become a required social norm so as to not make anyone feel unease for drinking (""because everyone else is doing it, might as well?""). But there really should be done some wider research on this topic. 
And personally I don't mind other people drinking at all, I just detest that many somehow feel like I must do so as well (or else it's a gamebreaker, even in fairly casual situations). This is a place where we aren't as accepting of individual differences. But of course, everything I just said doesn't apply to every event, group or individual. But without sounding too holy, I'd say it generally does apply.

- The current Danish government sold out our state-run energy supply company DONG to Goldman Sachs. Then just a few days ago they went ahead and made the ""Centre for Cyber-security"" law which creates a new unit in the military-intelligence (Forsvarets efterretingstjeneste) that has a surveillance licence on every Danish citizen, like NSA has it on the Americans.

- The Police is generally thought of as effective and reasonable, but that is only the frontside of the coin. The backside is whenever you are unlawfully charged or the police use force on you illegitimately, the organisation running the appeal process behind this is one of the few public institutions that is openly corrupt and biased. They recently had their name changed to the Independent Police-appeals authority (Den Uafhængige Politiklagemyndighed), to appease popular opinion that the system was rotten and nepotistic, but it was only a change on paper. All the lawyers, investigators and staff have an affiliation with the Police as an employer in one way or another. De-facto, all of this means that police are effectively immune from legal repercussions, unless it becomes a really big (and not just ordinary one-day running) tabloid story and the court has to side with popular opinion. 

- The professional political media is generally run on the ambition to get as many people to resign as possible. Resignsturbation. People usually talk about the 4th estate, but in Denmark it's not really an external power as much as a disruptive force seeking to destroy and create as much chaos as possible in order to sell more sensationalist news. It's become so bad that online and print media almost have one story a day about a politician or public official doing something slightly wrong with state or party money like getting Taxi bills paid. The media aren't the democratic watchdog seeing the bigger picture, but rather the provocative crows seeking to profit on trivial mishaps. It's especially hilarious when the day after they hype up a politician to resign, and then seeing that he doesn't (when they have probably already prepared political eulogies, analysis and a spectacular sad-face picture), they write editorials with nothing but butthurt and surprise in them. And this isn't just tabloids, but ""upstanding"", ""well-respected"" and ""serious"" news outlets as well. Even those branding themselves as doing intellectual and thought-provoking journalism are on the [Robotic voice] ""Must-get-politician-to-resign-today""[/Robotic voice] hype train. 

- While the bigger cities are fairly progressively minded, you'll find more and more people in the rural areas supporting the Danish People's Party. It's a national-romantic party that runs on quaint populist issues like welfare for the elderly and animals, but are xenophobic towards middle-eastern immigrants. They're incidentally also the party that is uptight and controlled enough to usually never be bothered by the media-circus with the bloated small-scale scandals. And from what I can see, the people that regard that as the only truth see them as the closest thing to honest politicians and thus vote for them despite their quite horrendous world view.

- We are still in a commonwealth with Greenland and the Faroe Islands and support them with public funds. It's a very unsatisfactory solution for all parties where they can't leave because they can't support their own economy yet (and in the case of the Faroes probably never will), but the relationship is also generally unpopular among the people of the two north atlanic countries, but also in Denmark because we feel it's money into a bottomless pit with no or little positive side-effects. There is also significant stigma and taboo associated with the colonisation of Greenland and the way the native people were force-assimilated. And later, how they completely failed as a society having left their original fishing and whaling culture behind. 
And speaking of whaling, the Faroes are also infamous for their ""cultural"" slaughter of whales that is usually then blamed on Denmark since they're not completely independent yet.

- Concerning religion, fortunately most people under 60 are not actively part of any organised religion: Spiritualists, deists, agnostics and pseudo-buddhists. But we still have around 80 % of people being a member of the official state lutheran church for the sake of convenience, conformism and for upholding traditions. It's an unfortunate double-standard that is yet to be confronted properly. And we also need to formally separate church and state in the constitution, even if it's a totally apolitical ""people's"" church without any leader or spokesperson.

- Regarding public health, there's good coverage with both doctors and hospitals, but if at any point you have any mental problems it becomes taboo for the ordinary person and your doctor will likely just prescribe you some anti-depressants. There needs to be a better sector of public health that deals with mental problems (including stress) that isn't the insane asylum. But currently that is about the only two things the system can offer: A pill that gives you suicide thoughts or going to a place where you get a free branding that says ""sub-human"". Also dentists really need to be free, especially for students and people without a job.

- From my experience with the public school system (pre high-school), it was hopelessly outdated, underfunded and not flexible enough to deal with the realities of a globalised world. Also, a lot of the teaching is very traditional blackboard classroom teaching and a lot of children simply can't conform to this very rigid format and there has to be made special classes for them to catch up and learn in other ways (thus making them more excluded). I'm a male myself and i'll make this overgeneralisation that it's usually the majority of the boys not learning very much from lectures and the majority of girls being the best and most diligent in their respective classes. There's simply not enough engaging, fun or modern learning that the boys can relate to and memorize from. If the way you're being taught things bores you to death and you think it's the most meaningless thing ever, you generally don't remember as much of it yourself, either. Personally most of what I learned as a child I learned from a source that wasn't a school teacher and I only truly learned things in school when there was more free project-based learning. To this day 
I genuinely believe no one benefits optimally from the current system. The dutiful sycophants with permanetly-raised-index-finger syndrome only gained good grades on paper, but in reality they are not really good at anything in particular. Lectures were nothing less than a complete waste of time for both the restless and concentrated jocks and the bored and unstimulated nerds. I guess you could come with these criticisms on most school systems but what is really lacking is a teaching that dares be dynamic, changing and individually stimulating whilst also being inclusive and dare I say democratic rather than despotic. From the side of the politicians, the only thing we've seen done is to give school administrators more power (i.e. can fire teachers for very minor errors), resulting in even more lectures being done by substitutes (or outright cancelled) that may not be fully qualified for the respective field they're supposed to teach about. To top it all off, there was already a proportional shortage of teachers to pupils but now with all these potential layoffs, it'll get even worse. In short, there's a need for a radical paradigm shift where the pupils become more autonomous and self-responsible.

- In foreign policy in the last 10 years we have made some very questionable decisions about blindly following the Americans as their wannabe disciple. The last (unconfirmed, so could be made up) news was that a CIA plane was waiting in Copenhagen to pick up Edward Snowden when the USA thought the Russians would hand him over to them. It's also been proven that the CIA used Greenland as an overflight station for transporting alleged terrorists to countries where they would likely face torture or the death penalty.

- Hash, marijuana, cannabis, ganja, weed - whatever you want to call it is criminalized and drains significant police resources that could be used much more effectively if it was simply legalized. The politicians who have tried to defend keeping the criminalization have defended it with almost religious arguments, with no evidence to support their claims besides them believing (truly!) that it's a morally bad thing and a detriment to public health. And yet so many people still smoke it, so why isn't the sensible thing done? And forgive me if this gets a bit dark, but I do think that it's because under the progressive surface of some (not all!) people lies a puritan who isn't satisfied with being a puritan themselves - they also have to have everybody else in society be decent people. Drugs, nudity, sex, fictional violence, radical grassroots political movements and so on are all unquestionably and undebatably bad and they don't want any association with such things. In a way (using Marxists terminology), the proletariat has taken power and the means of production and have in their own self-complacency unconsciously become the very bourgeois they sought to overthrow. Or in other words, we have a large middle-class made up of former workers who feel the need to be holier than anyone they consider outside their social strata by projecting their own self-righteousness.

- Unemployment duties are absurd, existentially meaningless and produce nothing of value. People are asked to do menial tasks the employer don't need performed, only to comply with a check-list that says you have been working 30 hours this or that week. Instead of using all the untapped potential and creativity of all of these talented people that are in temporary limbo for something good, we instead punish them and force them to (because this form of slavery was allowed in the european human rights convention) do the things we don't want to do and usually unofficially hire underpaid foreign workers to do. 

- And on the point of questionable deprivations of liberty, we still officially have a conscription policy in place. Although most people draw a number that gives them a pass if they want it, those that don't have to either spend 9 months of their life in the military or in some other official society service for objectors. It needs to be rid of as it serves no one, not to say it may even make it harder for the military to accept women with a policy that states that men are required to serve, while women can come in second line only as volunteers. Maybe we don't need to abolish our military completely like Iceland, but it needs to be 100 % professional and suitable to our needs if it is to have any justification for furthered existence.

And that's pretty much all I could think of at this moment. If you don't think politics belong in this kind of discussion then I dare say that a proactive approach to societal change is the only reason Denmark ever got this reputation as a progressive country. Even if you just want to change the little things, nobody entrenched in power is going to just bend over and let you change things (since that is the foundation of their power) - you have to fight for it. And that's a very important thing to learn about our country -  we are very upfront about when we dislike something (some even call it a grumble-culture), but ultimately it's for the best.

I think something like this could work, especially if the two-tiered system was developed (for example for the UK). The European Federalists want to convene a pan-EU, open and democratic constitutional conference to change the treaties, and then put it to referendum everywhere. Anyone know what the process would be for convening such a conference? Do they need a majority in the Council or something?

I wonder if it'll be possible to do nowadays, what with all the anti-EU sentiment in a lot of countries. Provided a fair number of countries pass the referendum (like last time, where a majority of those who had the referendum actually passed it), it should go forward and those who rejected it get put into the second tier of a two-tiered EU which would have full (conditional) access to the single market without the regulations/laws/loss of sovereignty that aren't connected with that aspect of the union.

In this way, countries who want out (with benefits) like the UK would be able to do so under a controlled manner (without being able to pick-and-choose) while those who want in a democratic EU that doesn't just get dragged down by all the closed-doors shady bullshit, with a fully-working parliamentary system that elects a government (getting rid of the Commission like it is today - something like what they describe [here](http://www.towardsfederaleurope.eu/federal-political-union/)) get their way, too. We would finally have a strong, unified voice to deal with internal and international affairs. Everybody's happy!

Well, if I'm already suggesting stuff, why don't we split the countries who join that Federal EU into the NUTS2 level or something similar, states with similar population count/GDP (hell, give all the secessionist factions in the EU independence, under the bigger political federation - that should make them happy) in order to get a fair, proportional allocation of MEPs? This distribution of ""member states"" should be redrawn every once in a while to make sure that they still have similar population/GDP levels, in order to keep the system as fair as possible. We'd finally get out of the ""nothing in the EU happens without calling Berlin first, and Paris second, London third and checking if they allow it"" bullshit we've had since forever that's screwing over everyone else (not that everyone else needs the EU to screw themselves over - some of us *cough* seem quite talented at screwing ourselves over without much help, not that that's a good thing).",0,1402715468,null,0,1402727503,0,ci74hq5,t3_28329t,t1_ci74hq5,t3_28329t,null,1434231539,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

Another one died during an Israeli attack on the 8th, which was repulsed. He was also in the infantry.

Another of the brothers was a tanker, and he died when Israeli airforce bombed his tank when he was ordered to move outside of the Egyptian air defense net. 

And then the fourth one died trying to relieve the Third Army, which was encircled when the Israelis violated the ceasefire borders. He was in the airforce.

My dad was a combat medic and managed to avoid getting himself killed, but from what he tells me he had a few close calls, one during the [Battle of Chinese Farm](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/1973_sinai_war_maps2.png), which was an [Egyptian defeat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Chinese_Farm).

Es war schon 16:00 Uhr und ihr Mann würde bald zu Hause sein. Als sie mit ihrem Fahrrad fuhr,  dachte sie an das Jubiläumsdinner. Es ist zu schade, dass sie nicht mehr kocht.  

Josef sah ein Fußballspiel. Plötzlich schreckte ihn ein lauter Signalton auf. “Jetzt machen wir Feierabend”, sagte er zu seinen Kollegen. Er stand von seinem Schreibtisch auf und eilte zu seinem Auto. Trotz all seiner Bemühungen war Josef in der Regel die letzte Person, die das Büro verließ. Die Fettabsaugung entfernt angeblich zwei Liter Fett aus dem Körper, aber er wollte es nicht glauben. Als er sich schließlich seinem kleinen roten Auto näherte, war sein Gesicht mit Schweiß bedeckt. Josef hatte nie geglaubt, dass er in sein Auto passen würde. Es gibt viele Dinge, die Josef nie glauben wird.  

Sabine nahm eine Abkürzung durch eine Gasse. Ihre Schnürsenkel verfingen sich in der Kette. Sie fiel in eine schlammigen Pfütze. Sie setzte sich auf und befreite ihre Schnürsenkel. Zum Glück war ihre Tasche mit den Lebensmitteln nicht nass geworden. Sie setzte sich wieder auf das schlammige Fahrrad.  Jemand rief ihr zu und sie schaute zurück. Sie sah ein Paar bedrohliche Jungen. Sie radelte schnell weg. Die holprige Straße tat ihr am Po weh. Ihre Brieftasche fiel aus ihrer Gesäßtasche. Aber es ist okay, weil sie sie nie wieder brauchen würde.   


Der Magen von Josef knurrte, also fuhr er zu einem Supermarkt und kaufte sich einen Hamburger und einen Apfel. Er wollte gesund essen.
Sabine fuhr gerade an der Sporthalle vorbei, als sie einen Freund an der Theke sah. Sie ging hinein und ein einfacher Gruß wurde zu einem 30-Minuten-Gespräch. Sabines Uhr piepte, 16:30 Uhr. Sie verabschiedete sich schnell und fuhr mit dem Fahrrad fort. Sie wollte das Essen fertig haben bevor ihr Mann nach Hause kommen würde. 
Eine Prellung am Bein fing zu jucken an. Sie wollte nicht wissen, ob diese von ihrem Fahrradunfall oder vom Gürtel ihres Mannes kam.
Josef näherte sich einer Kreuzung. Die Ampel wurde gelb.  Er warf seinen Kebab-Stick (Was ist ein Kebab-Stick?) aus dem Fenster und beschleunigte. Die Ampel wurde rot. Josef beschleunigte noch mehr. (Josef drückte noch mehr auf die Tube.) 
Sabine erreichte die Kreuzung und wartete, um die Straße zu überqueren. Es waren keine Autos in Sicht, aber sie hatte mehr Angst vor dem Gesetz als vor dem Gürtel ihres Mannes. Als die Ampel grün wurde, radelte sie los. Aus dem Augenwinkel sah sie ein rotes Auto. “Hoffentlich bremst er noch”, dachte sie. Sie dachte nicht mehr.
Josef spürte einen dumpfen Schlag. Sein Auto fuhr nicht mehr, denn ein schmutziges Fahrrad war auf seiner Windschutzscheibe gelandet.

1. you're pronouncing the *s* like an English *s*. A German *s* is far softer. Think *z* when you say it. I noticed this most when you were saying ""also"" like in English. In German it's more *alzo*. Listen here: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/also#German

2. You're getting the *r* all wrong. I know this is because the sound doesn't exist in English at all. You don't do a tongue flap like the ""tt"" in ""butter."" I don't know how to explain it, but you're repeatedly making this same mistake. The very first word in this clip on YT is *warum* - listen to see how it should sound https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDwaGhRiHbY You were saying ""vadoom"" basically.

So you're getting the non-final *r* wrong. You're also making a mistake on the final *r* by treating it like the final *r* in English. You said *ander* as *anderrr* instead of something like *andeh*. This is less pronounced, though, compared to your non-final *r*.

3. Based on the *r* stuff and one time I heard you say *gemacht* (which was wrong because the *ch* you pronounced like an English *k* rather than one of the sounds English doesn't have, I'm guessing you just never learned how to do the ""back of the mouth"" stuff like the uvular trill.

There's something about your vowels, too, but I daren't correct them. I can tell they're off, but I'm not confident enough to tell you *how* they ought to sound. I find consonants in any language much easier to replicate than vowels.

Many Hungarians actually have a really low tolerance for hotness in paprikas, they just don't know that because they never tried anything that wasn't a Hungarian breed. The hottest we go for that we actually consume as a whole (as pickled, so that takes out some of the actual hotness) is only around 1000 SHU itself. Another version that is used for cooking into dishes or the same way as chili flakes MIGHT go to 5-6000 if it's recently dried out and is from a good strain, which is again not terribly much for someone familiar with chilies.

Si on souhaite garder une logique de marché et permettre tout de même la compétition entre ces deux pays mais dire clairement que rogner sur les droits sociaux n'est pas acceptable, il semble logique de donner un handicap aux produits importés de ce pays.

I'm bilingual by birth, German and English respectively. My English dialect most likely sounds English as that's how other native speakers usually perceive me IRL.

The test was spot-on with one native tongue in the first try as well, but I don't get ""German"" dialect in the 2nd, and with Dutch, a close German relative comes up as my native tongue in the 2nd try as well.

I think that Singaporean/US ebonics is more of a ""I have no idea what you are""-gesture by the test, because judging from my little knowledge of this particular dialect, I knew which answers would lead the test to judge that way. And I didn't choose them.

However, I think it's a fair guess that my dialect - based only on grammar - will somehow come up as a creole of English and German.

Smartphone: We only use ours for internet and the occasional call so we do prepaid.  Internet is 10€/1Gb per month (after 1Gb it doesn't cost more, it just slows down to a crawl), plus then 9c per min or call (remember here the caller pays, so if someone calls you it doesn't cost anything). 20€ gets unlimted calling and data (500Mb highspeed data)

&gt;Cut up the onion and garlic into small pieces. Prepare your mushroom how you like them.

&gt;Step 1 Fry all the bacon in a tall pan. You need this pan to be able to fit all your chicken and mushroom

&gt;Step 2 When the bacon has been fried, take it out of the pan and fry your chicken breasts in the bacon fat. The chicken should not be cooked, it should just be brown on both sides

&gt;Step 3 Remove the chicken from the pan and discard the remaining fat. Add some oil to the pan and fry your oinion and garlic

&gt;Step 4 Cook the onion and garlic for a couple of minutes (they should not be browning), then move the pan to cold surface

&gt;Step 5 Add the paprika ('burn it'), the tomato paste, the citron shell, the cream and the wine. Mix it all together.

&gt;Step 6 Add the chicken breast to the pan, then add chicken fond untill the chicken is covered. Do not add mushrooms and bacon yet. 

&gt;Step 7 move the pan back to the heat, cover the pan, let it cook at medium temperature for about 35 minutes. You can let it be by itself but you should stir a couple of times just to make sure you're not burning the dish. 5 minutes before it is done cooking, add the bacon and the mushroom and mix it in.

Serve with with rice and dark bread. Enjoy your meal.

Se ritieni che sia fuori luogo la gioia di chi, dopo aver assistito (sgolandosi per denunciare) ad una vita di scempio del Paese, vede almeno certificare che aveva ragione, nemmeno qui sono d'accordo.

Se ritieni poco comprensibile la reazione umana di chi vede in disgrazia dei personaggi visceralmente sgradevoli, ovviamente sei nel tuo diritto, ma ancora una volta non sono d'accordo.

Se infine in qualche modo simpatizzi con la carovana di coloro che per una vita hanno negoziato e fatto affari con l'inguardabile, e ritengono che non ci sia altro modo per fare le cose, e che vivono questo trapasso semplicemente come un passaggio di consegne, allora siamo proprio estranei. 

Naturalmente può essere che il difetto stia nel mio sguardo: in fin dei conti, me ne sono andato dall'Italia perché la trovo intollerabile e, dal giorno della rielezione di Napolitano, al di là di qualsiasi speranza.

Although i would like to add that this vast majority that welcomed austria's ""anschluss"" did welcome it only because there was an austrian chancellor, who, as an austrian, would have some incentive to treat austria right.


We do have a sense of humor but that is mostly infantile and dumb. There are 'comedians' who made careers out of swearwords and others who earned their money with jokes about women and men don't understand each other.

We seem uptight because that is one of the very few modes in which we know to carry ourselves in. We can also do the aforementioned puberty humor as seen in german television.
Another alternative is drunkenly singing and puking everywhere.
Spaniards on the island of mallorca can tell you all about that.
Potential point of national pride might be our advanced medicine which apparently manages to keep the carcasses of those beer and sangria victims functioning well enough so that they can be exploited by our greedy and inhumane economy.

As for the language, german is a jumbled mess. English is less clunky and gets to the point quicker. Austrians somehow almost manage to bring something like a flow to the language but they'd be better off learning english. Or french or hungarian or pretty much anything else.
Universally, ""klingon"", a made up language designed to sound alien and unwieldy is easier to pronounce for most people around the globe.
Everyone who ever saw a klingon say ""Quap'lah!"" will be able to imitate it fairly quickly. Try teaching the word ""Tschüss!"" to the same person.

So yeah, i can certainly understand the desire to not identify one's own language with 'german' even if it kinda is.

As for being offended when someone mistakes you for a german, well i guess anyone would be correcting a misunderstanding like that, if only to avoid getting asked to get people a cuckoo clock when you visit ""your"" home country next time.
Also people thinking that you're something other then a german is certainly helpful, people will be much friendlier.

Obviously not ;) and as I said elsewhere in the comment, sometimes things get rediculous. Cheminots and EDF employees are examples of that. 

But on the whole the general French defence of labour and employment conditions means that compared to my home country, your average minimum wage employee is paid more, has longer holiday, stricter controls on overtime he can be required to work, better employment protections, better health care and unemployment insurance and better training paid by the employer. 

I'm not saying the cheminots are minimum wage employees and I'm not saying that their 'special regime' is fair nowadays, but their strike is part of a larger trade-union culture which has other knock-on effects for other segments of the labour market.

And I am quite sure that it's the same thing (not wanting a federal Europe) in the other ""big"" europeans countries, obviously UK, but even Germany, country yet largely profiting from the EU.

I could be wrong, but I think the idea of a ""federal europe"" is way much more popular in smaller europeans countries, and I can understand why.

How does this connect to the article? Are you commenting on how much Austrians would or wouldn't trust a German leader. Hitler had massive support in Austria: if I'm not mistaken, 99% of Austrian voters were in favor of the Anschluss, which is a considerably higher figure than the percentage of Germans who voted for the NSDAP in the Bundestag elections that would indirectly bring Hitler to power. I think the reason for his popularity in Austria had just as much to do with the resurgence of the idea of the großdeutsche Lösung, as well as the fact that Austria had also been on the losing side of WWI and had suffered for it, though arguably not as much as Germany did.

Besides, breaking up the countries we have too much might be a bit drastic and be counter productive. If the system is set up right, a country's size shouldn't give it too much power, but again a country's size shouldn't be completely ignored. That's why a bicameral system would be ideal, but set up to avoid the things that plague the US such as large campaign contributions and power lobby groups.

Tu vois ? Tu es encore dans la logique de la punition. C'est pas du tout le but de dire que quelqu'un ici fait quelque chose de mal. C'est de changer la façon dont les incitations fonctionnent. Maintenir les travailleurs dans la misère représente aujourd'hui une source de profit, et du coup c'est assez logique (à défaut d'être moral) que les entreprises le fassent. Il s'agit juste de transformer cette source de profit en source de coût afin que les entreprises locales parviennent à exporter sans détruire le code du travail du pays importateur.

C'est purement de la technique là, pas de l'éthique. Une autre solution qui marcherait, pour qui croit **vraiment** à la compétition libre et non faussée, c'est d'ouvrir grand les frontières pour les travailleurs de tous les pays. La mondialisation ne devrait pas seulement fonctionner pour les capitaux et les marchandises mais aussi pour les humains.

Ovviamente qui non si anticipa nulla sulla parità dei sessi, e si tratta in fondo solo di generi (in senso grammaticale).

A parte questa reminiscenza, avrei un suggerimento.

Se non volete affittare una macchina, prova a vedere se si possono acquistare brevi tour in pullman partendo da Aosta, che tutto sommato si raggiunge bene in treno.

So che possono sembrare una cosa da pensionati o gita dei coscritti, però così hai risolto il problema trasporto e alloggio.

Inoltre, se non conosci le montagne, è cosa buona e giusta avere una guida alpina, con un tour organizzato sei sicuro di trovarla.

Qui da me (in Brianza) questi tour si trovano facilmente nelle agenzie viaggio locali. In genere non sono costosi. Sul posto potresti provare a sentire anche l'APT oppure il CAI.

Nobody mentioned it so I will: There were efforts just after the end of WWI to unite Austria and Germany, but they failed as Entente prohibited Anschluss in Versailes Treaty (no cabinet in Weimar Republic tried to overrule this) AND both Austrian and Prussian authorities voiced dissent about having two strong states in one country. There were also other reasons as disappointment of postwar Germany (i.e. Noske politics)

The French in general are aware of this issue but it is far from being  overcome yet. I believe those rude people you had to deal with were people who were awkwardly trying to deal with someone who just said something they didn't understand. It is said that parisians are rude in general so I guess it doesn't help. Maybe some people can get annoyed by the fact that you're not even trying to communicate in French at first. It can be considered as rude.

The best thing to do is to begin any conversation with ""excusez moi, parlez vous anglais?"". If you get a positive answer then it's legit for you to speak in English, and I guess people will treat you kindly.

I want to emphasize the following point : speaking in English to someone you don't know can be perceived as rude. It gives the impression that you don't give a shit in which country you are, it's like you're not even trying to discover France and its language. You're not expected to be fluent, but it is expected that you make a small effort, either by trying to speak French, or by asking people if they speak English before doing so.

true,balatik,ZAFrancophonie,Francophonie,"&gt; TL;DR: Paris is a very diverse city and the people love their language. Speaking French (or attempts at it) go a long way, as it seemed that Paris was not the most tourist-friendly of cities.

Yes, Parisians (and French people in general) love their culture… I wouldn't say we love our culture more than any other nationality. We have taken steps to protect it against ""foreign"" intrusion (laws require ads and slogans to be translated…), but there's also been a lack of will to open the people to other cultures (English is still not well taught in French schools).

Paris is one of the most touristic place in the world, and Parisians see that as a good thing (it brings money, our culture is recognized), but as a bad thing as well (lots of clueless tourists in some parts of town like Montmartre, the nicest ""hidden"" local places don't stay hidden for long, [rents going up because of things like AirBnB](https://news.vice.com/article/airbnb-will-probably-get-you-evicted-and-priced-out-of-the-city)).

So yeah, for a lot of Parisians, tourist interaction can be a source of friction. If you come prepared and speak some French you'll be well treated, but if you're clueless and don't respect our way of life (don't be loud in public, for example) you will be treated accordingly…",0,1402746798,null,0,false,0,ci7bhjj,t3_284aoj,t1_ci7bhjj,t3_284aoj,null,1434234898,2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,2

Another probably reason austrians may have ""wanted"" to unite with the german might have been the perceived power of the german military.

Les RU donnent des repas complet et pas mauvais pour pas trop cher, la plupart des villes étudiantes sont beaucoup moins cher que paris, tu auras le temps de taffer sur un petit boulot en école d'ingé (j'ai fait un cdd entre mon ecrit et mon oral quand j'était en prépa pour payer mon loyer perso...)

true,CafeClope,ZZZZZZvin,Vin,"Ça dépend entièrement de ton confort de vie.

Je dirais qu'on peut s'en tirer pour assez peu cher.

Pour le logement : évite les cités U, c'est tout bonnement du vol. Le moins cher est de t'installer en coloc avec des gens de ton école (il devrait y avoir des annonces sur une éventuelle page FB des admissibles ou un truc du style) parce que tu auras plus de m²/personne et tu pourras profiter par exemple d'une grande cuisine, d'un lave-linge ou lave-vaisselle, d'un vrai congélo, ce qui est rarement le cas en studio seul. Au prix/m²/personne tu t'en sors mieux en coloc en général.

Il y a des gens que la coloc ne tente pas du tout (c'est mon cas). D'après mon expérience, un studio pour 1 personne ça tourne entre 300 et 450€ par mois charges comprises (sauf EDF), selon le lieu, le confort, meublé ou non. 

A ça t'ajoutes environ 50€ par mois d'EDF (variable selon isolation, chauffage élec ou gaz... frileux ou pas !).

Donc pour 350€-500€ t'es logé et au chaud. 

Pour manger : là ça dépend complètement des gens. Clairement si tu commandes des pizzas, sushis, que tu prends des plats surgelés et des kebabs, tu vas galérer à la fin du mois (et même avant). La bonne solution : il faut réussir à faire ses courses dans une grande surface, pas une supérette (ça dépanne mais c'st très très cher si tu y fais touts tes courses). A taille égale les magasins Leclerc sont les moins chers mais en général plus le magasin est grand, meilleur marché c'est (par contre faut prendre une voiture si c'est trop loin). Donc garde ça en tête quand tu choisis ton logement. Si tu as une voiture c'est plus facile évidemment.

Faut s'organiser pour les courses, faire des listes pour ne pas être tenté d'acheter n'importe quoi. Regarde toujours les prix au kilo (parfois y'a des trucs étonnants), c'est le plus important. Les marques distributeurs (Marque Repère etc) sont très bonnes. Eco+ pas trop. Achète des tonnes de pâtes, féculents, légumes en conserves etc qui ne périment pas. Le plus cher c'est bien entendu la viande et les fruits frais. Là encore, prix au kilo. Viande blanche moins chère que rouge, fruits de saison moins chers que hors-saison. 

Heureusement, si jamais tu galères à te faire de la viande ou à manger des fruits, il y a le **Restaurant Universitaire** (alleluia) ! Pour 3,15€ t'as un repas complet et équilibré, midi et soir. Certains RU ouvrent le weekend et pendant les vacances. Vérifie où sont les RU dans ta ville, ils sont souvent plutôt proches des facs que des écoles. C'est meilleur que la cantine je te rassure.

Donc niveau budget bouffe ça va dépendre de ton self-control/organisation et de si tu vas souvent au RU. S'il s'agit de faire un budget, fais un test de courses pour 2 semaines avec tes parents dans un supermarché et partez là-dessus.

Enfin, pour la vie étudiante : là c'est l'horreur ça coûte une fortune, les pintes sont au moins à 7€ et tu vas pas en boire qu'une. En province c'est moins cher qu'à la capitale paraît-il, mais ne t'attends pas à des miracles. J'ai pas vraiment de bon plan à donner et c'est impossible d'estimer tes dépenses de sortie à l'avance. Clairement il te faudra un peu d'argent de poche en tout cas.

Souvent dans les écoles il y a un apéro le jeudi soir une semaine sur deux avec les boissons beaucoup moins chères que dans les bars. Essaye d'acheter de l'alcool dans des grandes surfaces, à l'avance, plutôt que dans les épiceries de nuit (argh) et faites des soirées chez des gens plutôt que dans des bars (mais bon les bars c'est cool quand même).

Ah et si par vie étudiante tu entendais aussi autre chose que biture tous les soirs :D il y a souvent des programmes pour les étudiants en matière de culture : carte de réduction, tarifs réduits ciné-théâtre-concerts, etc. Ca dépend de la ville. Peut-être aussi des partenariats entre ton école et certains bars/boîtes ?

Dernière remarque : Internet. En coloc vous prendrez une box mais si t'es seul, c'est quand même cher. Demande le numéro de ligne à ton proprio. Ne tarde pas trop avant de la réactiver sinon c'est 60€. Compare les abonnements. Combien de temps tu resteras (séjour à l'étranger l'année prochaine par ex) =&gt; avec ou sans engagement. Souvent les FAI qui disent ""sans engagement"" et qui sont abordables/mois font payer la box et la résiliation bien cher...

Option frugale : tu geek à l'école et chez toi tu te connectes via ton smartphone (en mode tethering). Pour Reddit ça passe, et c'est clairement le moins cher. Par contre oublie les jeux multi et les torrents. Parfois tu captes un hotspot depuis ton studio, c'est le jackpot. Ou alors un wifi mal protégé, ou alors tu partages un abonnement avec un voisin. Bref ça va dépendre. 

Btw félicitations pour tes concours !

PS : Il me semble que tes parents peuvent déclarer ce qu'ils te versent chaque mois en tant que pension alimentaire et que ça fait moins d'impôts, mais à vérifier.

Ti compiaci della tua originalità? Ti senti un eroe dell'anticonformismo?

Non posso sopportare le persone che tifano contro una squadra solo per fare il bastian contrario. Se non ti interessa la partita puoi tranquillamente non guardarla, senza sottolineare a tutti i tuoi amici e scrivendo su tutti i social network di quanto sei fico perché tifi contro.

&gt;Mentre sono serenamente contento quando le nazionali di altri sport meno famosi vincono in giro per il mondo (penso alla pallanuoto, sport di grandissimi sacrifici o alla pallavolo, ecc.) ho sempre pensato che ogni sconfitta dei pallonari fosse in realtà un bene, per lo meno per quella parte del paese che è ancora cosciente della realtà.

Bravo coglione. Il calcio può tranquillamente non piacerti, ma è comunque uno sport come qualsiasi altro, perché mai dovresti essere contento se vince la nazionale di pallavolo dal tuo punto di vista? C'è una palla, ci sono delle regole, c'è del tifo e ci sono dei tornei. Se ti dà fastidio che i giocatori di calcio siano così pagati non guardare le partite sarebbe di gran lunga più di aiuto, visto che li paghi pure tu sintonizzandoti.

Entegrasyona devam edeceğiz ama bunu bazı medya organizasyonları farklı yöne çekiyor. İnanıyorum ki entegrasyon noktasında sizler hiçbir zaman zorluk çıkarmadınız. Ama asimilasyon dersek, hayır. Ben yine aynısını söylüyorum. Çünkü biz dinimizden, dilimizden, kültürümüzden taviz veremeyiz” dedi.""

Bottom line translation: Yes to integration, no to assimilation.
