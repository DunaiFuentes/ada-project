true,RamblinRambo,FINL,Finland,"&gt;Do you think a complete union of the 5 Nordic states into one federal state is workable, or do you just mean closer ties?

Very much so. We had the [Nordic Council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Council) long before the EU. We have had freedom of movement long before EU etc. Actually between the Nordic countries EU hasn't given us anything new when it comes to trade, movement, healthcare in a neighbouring country etc.

We are as you say low in population but we're all huge countries (except Denmark) in landmass. Wast wilderness, natural resources and different challenges than the continents. I mean Sweden is bigger by landmass than Germany and Finland and Norway just about the same size as Germany with only a few million people in each. So when EU bureaucrats decide that we cannot hunt wolves, it has a direct effect on families living in remote areas where their kids play outside and where these animals possess a threat. Just one example.

In a bit of a hurry here. Would love to go more into detail but I think you get the idea. I am sure that we'd work better as a union and even as a federal state than with the EU.",0,1398319354,null,0,false,0,ch0mmyi,t3_23rjrx,t1_ch0mmyi,t1_ch0chir,null,1433496658,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The US isn't a loose federation.

The federal government collects tax and has its own criminal law.  It can imprison people for breaking it, even if their actions are legal under state law.

It's kinda like a confederate supranational union, it's kinda not.** 

The European Union is actually **very similar** to the early United States. 

Except...you know...they have a bunch of different languages and histories, which is rather homogeneous in America, but politically they're quite similar; with the exception of a unified foreign policy and a ACTUAL fiscal/monetary union. 

Militarily they're quite similar to the United States as well. I mean....states couldn't *legally* act unilaterally outside of America *(even if they did)*, but the Federal military more-than-not relied mostly on state militias all the way up to the early 20th Century *(we didn't when the Civil War started to really get hot, but quickly went back to the old way right after with demobilization)*. 

Alright...so fuck...perhaps they're more similiar to the United States under the Articles of Confederation....or a weird fucking mix between that and early Constitutional United States....but the pieces and resemblance is still there. 

I mean, even U.S. citizens identified more with their state than their country before the Civil War...a quote I once heard, paraphrased, was *""Before the Civil War they addressed the country as 'These United States of America' and after they addressed is as 'The United States of America'*, which I always found quite interesting. 

I mean....the European Union has a lot more local/regional history, a lot more languages and a lot more insulated cultures to hinder any single national identity than the early United States...but eh...maybe they can learn to hold it as *equal* to their nationality instead of *superior* to it...hell...I'm pretty sure most Americans do this, especially Texans...but fuck...they don't really have the advantages we did. Even blacks and hispanics could identify with the *""American dream""* and *""American exceptionlism""* and ideals like that; I don't really know what Europe has to compare to that for integration. 

Though the EU is a weird beast. Unsure if it wants to be a centralized federation or a decentralized confederation; It has a judicial, legislative &amp; executive branch, yet a parliament without legislative initiative; EU law has supremacy over national law when it conflicts, but it doesn't have a single currency nor a strong fiscal/monetary union; it strives to represent the whole consortium on the international scene, but it's members lack a common foreign policy and *will* act independently, militarily as well.

But remember, there were really no federal jails &amp; prisons before the 20th century *(not counting P.O.W. camps and shit during the Civil War)*, and you only had the U.S. Marshalls, and Europe does have a slight equivalent with the [European Gendamarie Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Gendarmerie_Force).

But it is kinda odd how ambivalent and ignorant many Europeans seem to be about the EU...given that it's going to determine their entire future, no matter which direction it goes, for better or for worse.** 

Well yeah...*kinda*.... 

I think what exactly the European Union actually is...is a question that a lot of people are fighting to figure out right now and something a lot of people have different opinions on........in my personal opinion it's resulted in a beast that doesn't know if it wants to be a loose organization with horizontal integration *(expansion into Eastern Europe and The Balkans)* or a highly-integrated federation with vertical integration *(heavy integration of present-members; Eurozone)*......so it's trying to do both....be both a loose union and a tight union.....but I personally think this can end up with it trying to go so fast in two separate directions that it's going to tear itself in two if the politicians don't get their shit together and come to a consensus on *what exactly* the EU is and *where exactly* it's going. 

You might get disaster in a bureaucratic mangled mess, or you might get the United States of Europe. As a outsider though, it's fun to watch....feels like I'm in revolutionary times watching Congress transition from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution. Or what might've happened if they hadn't. 

Though it's odd that Europeans arn't really that emotional about where their nation is heading...since the EU *will be* the watershed moment, whichever direction it goes...but maybe many early American citizens felt the same ambivalence to the central government?

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"Whilst the EU doesn't implement law which can be get EU citizens jailed, it does pass such legislation indirectly. There are various social competences of which are mandated by the EU and passed by the European Parliament which then needs to be passed again or ratified in national parliaments. These laws are then enforced by national police forces and national court systems. Forgive me if I don't have the best example of this. I'm no expert on EU law, but [the EU working time directive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_Time_Directive) can get employers in serious legal trouble if they do not guarantee their employees their rights to a minimum amount of days off, and ensure that they are not working too long. 

Additionally, national police forces are integrated to about the same level as individual US states' police forces were integrated before the FBI became an effective institution in the 1920s. An example of this is the European Arrest Warrant. 

Again, not as highly integrated as the USA today, but still definitely leaning *very* close to the level of integration that is necessary in order to be considered a country instead of a suprnational entity.

Edit: I'm going to reiterate this one last time. I am not saying the EU is a country. My position is much more nuanced than that.

The European model is considered preferential because it actually involves more people in the electoral process, where as in the anglo-saxon model you'll get very adversarial politics and most people being driven to vote for one of two parties instead of getting a real choice (like you do in multi party democracies). 

However, it would probably just be simpler to say ""two party democracy"" ""multi party democracy"" or even ""electorate has to choose between the shiniest of two turds"" ""electorate gets real choice"".

And if it's not careful, byspeeding in two completely different directions *(close federation, loose confederation)*, it's gonna tear itself in two.** 

Every US state *does devolve power* within itself. They're all unitary states. And no, it wouldn't really make a difference to me, but I wouldn't like it, as it would fuck with my OCD which is inexcusable. 

And the difference between a confederation and a federation has been getting murkier by the day for the European Union. I don't know, the European Union is confusing to be honest, and it's supposed to be. There are a lot of people right now with a lot of emotional views on the topic and all of whom have different ideas of what the European Union should be, because to be honest, nobody knows what it is. 

And that's the problem. The European Union has a identity crisis. And until that's solved, all of this shit, it's just shit, because there's not quantifiable definition of *what exactly* the European Union is because none has been reached. WTF does *""ever, closer union""* mean anyway? It's broad ass language. Until European politicians sit down, talk and collectively agree on *what* the European Union and *where* the European Union is going, all of this is mute. 

I mean, every country goes through this, but even the American states came around and signed the constitution, and even before that, knew what was what in the Articles of Confederation; and state rights disputes still persisted after the signing of the constitution, but the country still had a concrete identity and parameters for it's direction. The Treaties which set-up the European Union are half-assed attempts at this, and they got half-assed results. It's like....some weird ass half-way-point between the Articles &amp; Constitution, with everybody too timid or unsure on which one they want to be. 

Such is good for fostering political debate...but I mean....you can't put that kinda language in your *founding* document. You got to have a strong foundation, and than debate from there.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"I think that's an overly prescriptive idea about how such a union needs to be formed. The model which worked well for the USA was a strong founding document that set out how things in this country are going to work. That's lasted for hundreds of years with very few amendments (is it about 20 or about 40? And most of those were in the early days of the Union). 

However, the international paradigms have changed and as a result you need a different approach. Prescriptive models of state building worked in the 18th century when there was vast amounts of land which belonged to no state and you had a large amount of people who had little national feelings (yes I know people still identified strongly with their heritage, but not enough to actually stay there). In such a situation it makes sense to have a strong document that says ""these are the rules. If you don't like them. Don't join"". However that can't work any more because everyone (apart from some African and Asian tribes like those in the Western Sahara Territory) has somewhat strong national or international perceptions and all the land in the world (apart from Antarctica and International Waters which are unclaimable by UN treaty) has already been claimed. This is why any new model for state building needs to be focused on complementing the already existing national structures rather than prescribing how such already existing national structures ought to behave. 

It's also because of this approach that you get a seemingly 'half cooked' effect. The thing is though, that this half cooked effect is actually incredibly useful. The EU only gains powers in those areas which it can administer better than member states individual. The EU is an incredibly utilitarian rather than ideological instrument. We wont take things to their logical conclusion just because it's the seemingly logical thing to do. We'll only take things further as they appear useful to us, and evidently at this point, many aspects of EU integration are felt to be better dealt with by member states. 

And finally I'd like to point out that because of the EU's utilitarian modus vivendi (way of life) means that an identity crisis isn't particularly a problem. The EU is just a very large institution which can be adapted in anyway the governors of the day see to be *useful*. We need not have a grand plan and a grand identity. It will make itself clear as we go. We need not plan out every single step of our journey. We don't even really need to know where we're going. All we need to do is be able to know exactly what is beneficial to is at each individual step and then to take that step.

I actually think the separatist movements are part of the natural development of the EU and Europe as a whole. As power gets delegated up, national entities become somewhat less relevant and so regions with a strong identity see little reason to stay involved. 

A huge lynch pin in all of the independence movements is if they would get automatic EU membership, should they become independent. This is because they identify with Europe, the EU and see it as an important part of their democracy. 

As far as the Bismarck example goes. I still don't buy it. Italy and Germany needed strong figures to unite them, but Switzerland didn't and is a fine and viable state. The UK has also evolved without *ever* having a codified constitution (we still don't have any specific document which outlines the purpose and function of UK government).  Iceland has managed to gain independence completely peacefully during the Occupation of Denmark in WWII and without any huge figure to unite them. And I haven't even mentioned the countries which peacefully left the British Empire and entered state hood like Canada (Canada also possession no real constitution) and Australia. 

So, for me, the Bismarck thing just doesn't hold true and it holds true even less today, in a world of internationalism and globalisation. ",0,1398325902,null,0,false,0,ch0o3fi,t3_23tzy7,t1_ch0o3fi,t1_ch0o0a1,null,1433497346,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

I suggest that you spend a bit more time researching this yourself. Clearly there are websites that can give you the basic info better than a public forum. I finished high school 10 years ago in France and became an engineer (though in Switzerland) but it doesn't make me an expert on how it works.

&gt;

&gt;__Engineering education__ is the activity of [teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching) knowledge and principles related to the professional practice of [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering). It includes the initial education for becoming an [engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer) and any advanced education and specializations that follow. Engineering education is typically accompanied by additional examinations and supervised training as the requirements for a professional engineering license.

&gt;[Technology education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_education) in primary and secondary schools often serves as the foundation for engineering education at the university level. (Douglas, Iverson &amp; Kalyandurg, 2004). In the United States, engineering education is a part of the [STEM initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields) in public schools. [Service-learning in engineering education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-learning_in_engineering_education) is gaining popularity within the variety of disciplinary focuses within engineering education including mechanical engineering, construction science, computer science and engineering, electrical engineering, and other forms of related education.

true,Seldon_,null,null,"The Armenians are like a broken record about this. Even the Jews do not mention the Holocaust to elicit sympathy on such a regular basis.

Most of the world (and certainly all of the West) already recognizes the events as ""genocide,"" or at least does not outright deny it. The only holdouts are Turkey and Azerbaijan, who are both hostile to Armenia for historical and geopolitical reasons. For the most part, they have accomplished their objective of making it known; it is certainly not ""failed to be acknowledged today.""

What they really want is for *Turkey* to recognize it, because that actually has some political value that could be used to Armenia's advantage, both in terms of imposing a sense of collective guilt upon the Turkish people as well as pushing forward claims for reparations and restoration. They will claim to disavow this, of course, but consider what the value of Turkish recognition actually means.

If Turkey recognized it, it would indirectly imply that Armenians have valid and legitimate claims to not only assets, properties, and historical artifacts within Turkey, but to Turkish territory itself. Actually *enforcing* those claims is another matter entirely and not likely to happen in the near future, but it would certainly legitimize any future action taken by the Armenians, or on behalf of the Armenians (e.g. by Russia, who is their biggest ally), to restore them. This is why it is such an important component of Armenian foreign policy, and why on an individual and cultural level it is embedded in their national consciousness. What does it say about Armenia that their national symbol is a mountain located in the territory of their historical enemy?

Similarly, denying it is a crucial element to Turkish foreign policy, not only because they would obviously like to hold onto Eastern Turkey, but because this potentially opens up a Pandora's box of territorial claims and latent ethnic conflicts. If Armenia starts demanding territory, then so would Greece. Syria might want Hatay back and the Kurds could be further emboldened in their push for independence. It is a potentially destabilizing situation that does not work in Turkey's favor and the Turks have way more to lose than to gain from it. 

The reason why Turkey will never recognize it, and why it should *never* recognize it, is because this demand for ""recognition"" is simply a veneer for Armenians' irredentism. They want Ararat and their ""lost provinces"" back.

Basically a similar example would be saying a farmer buying farmland then suddenly being told it's now a heidereserve or a building company buying a plot and then being told it's now farmland. Usually these changes happen in consideration with the owners or if not at least some form of reparations follow. Those reparations are usually subpar mind you as the gov or court deciding on it isn't too eage to do so but it still happens. 

Same story when the government distrains(not sure if the correct word) a piece of property for let's say social housing. (almost happened in my street 3 years ago.

Those people usually get paid for it but it happens completely on the state's/courts terms and is usually a lot less then what they'd get for just selling it because it's ""in public interest""

EU isn't really a factor in the everyday life of most people. We still, of course, have the experience of crossing a national border and immediately being surrounded by a whole different language, culture and possibly religion. We pay taxes to our national governments, not the EU (the 16th Amendment in the US surely made the federal government a part of everyone's life). And when we go to court, it's the local judicial system. While EU judicial institutions exist, they're of no concern to the population at large.

Then you have to consider that the EU doesn't regulate the areas that are of most concern to people in the poorer countries. That can lead to even lower interest and election turnout. For instance, people in my country are always complaining about small pensions, low teacher salaries and the like. The EU has no relation to those things, although some of our parties are being extremely dishonest by trying to leverage this.

The aspects of EU that are most visible in everyday life are actually not from the EU directly. Euro is visible as the currency, but Eurozone != EU, and people notice the lack of border checks but that is Schengen, which is actually not the same as EU.

Many states have what is known as 'medical marijuana' which is frequently and quite openly abused as just a way to get weed. 

However, Colorado and Oregon have made buying marijuana for recreational, as opposed to purely medical use, legal. However, whilst the Dutch stance is kind of ambiguous due to Marijuana being technically not legal, but decriminalised, Colorado and Oregon also have added ambiguity because US federal law forbids marijuana use in this way.

""la ""flexibilisation"" du droit du travail"". Très contestable franchement. Les fameux PSE de Hollande n'ont trait qu'à une partie des licenciements (les licenciements économiques), et ont justement pour objectif de limiter au maximum les licenciements en obligeant les employeurs à étudier toute possibilité de chômage partiel/reclassement. Avec contrôle de la Justice en prime, et d'énormes sanctions si les employeurs ne respectent pas toutes les obligations (PSE nul, donc licenciement nul, blabla...). On est trèèèès loin d'une libéralisation du droit du travail.

""la réduction des services publics, des cotisations et des aides sociales"" On a jamais diminué les fonds alloués aux services publics. Pour ce qui est des cotisations, elles sont déjà parmi les plus élevées en Europe. A la limite soit, mais quand on connaît un peu l'opacité du fonctionnement de la SS (vous savez qu'une partie des cotisations n'ouvrent pas des droits et servent juste à combler le trou de la Sécu ? Ca marche bien d'ailleurs...), on se dit que certaines réformes ne feraient pas de mal. Encore une fois, le socialisme ne doit pas être égal au statu quo. Il faut aussi savoir faire preuve d'autocritique. Et je pense qu'une critique de la Sécu, pas sur ses fondements, mais sur certains éléments de fonctionnement, est fondée.

&gt;what happened was that the usual ""Corona d'Aragó i de Catalunya"" was simplified documentally to ""Corona d'Aragó"" from the XIV century onwards in the royal chancillery documents.

Are you for real? ""Ok, in this one document we'll write correctly the real name of the crown... but from now and for centuries to come and in every single official document we'll just call it the Crown of Aragon because it's less of a mouthful and ink isn't exactly cheap, right?"". Nobody here is diminishing all the noteworthy individuals of Catalonian origin or the weight the region had in the crown. Far from it. But this is like a historian from 300 years in the future saying modern day Spain was actually called the Kingdom of Spain and Catalonia because you know, Catalonia was very important and there are a lot of documents and...

No, sorry, the Crown of Aragon was the Crown of Aragon because Catalonia, Aragon, Valencia, Sicily and so many other regions were under the control of the same royal, who's first and most important title happened to be king of Aragon. Simple.... and we've already kind of discussed about this, so screw it, feel free to go have tea with the same guys who claim Spain was born in 1492. I'm done. What we have here is a desperate attempt to give secessionist aspirations a historical legitimacy. Unfortunately it isn't working all that well. Sorry you disagree for political reasons.

&gt;I think its pretty clear he made no distinctions between catalonia and the crown of aragon.

What? Where do you get that from? The most reasonable answer is: hey, we all come from the same place! But of course, it uses the word ""nation"" so obviously he meant what we meant today by ""nation""! Right on.

&gt;They were fighting for their way of life, for the laws that governed them, for the land their consodered it was theirs.

We've been here before. Awesome how in your discourse feudal privileges turn into 'constitutional rights'. The hilarity of it all, dude! Never read history with today's lenses. You're selling me Braveheart when you should know better. Modernity didn't reach Spain when it reached the rest of Europe and many serious people suggest we're still waiting for the Renaissance. We still had a feudal system in place, and yes, people loyalties were to the crown because the crown was the land.

&gt;Well, Columbus has as good a chance to being catalan as being from italy

As good a chance. Really. Wow.

&gt;And Pals could have been the catalan pals and not the andalusian one, I dare you to offer more proof to one option than the other, isntead of ridiculing it.

Oh, ok... crap, every single historical account we have isn't valid anymore. Ok. Geez. You're goddamn right then. Silly me.

&gt;This kind of argumentation you put forward as a ""catalan independentist claim"" is very similar to something that happened in china several years ago...

.. Aren't we just having a discussion about the validity of referring to the Crown of Aragon as the Catalonian-aragonese crown? You're not soom loon in Reus, people seem to actually believe this. Just like believing the Catalonian nation was fighting for its rights back in 1701. This is revisionism, dude, and what I'm trying to explain is that this hurts your political aspirations.

The UK is currently in coalition but this is almost unprecedented in UK history (there was a Labour minority government in the seventies which relied on Liberal support, but that was a minority government not a coalition). It is likely to return to the long term tradition of either Labour or the Conservative party forming majority governments. 

There are other UK parties, obviously, the Greens, UKIP and the Liberal Democrats come to mind but these are minority parties who have never seen political power in Westminster apart from in the 2010 government which as I have said before is nearly unpresedented. 

Canada is very similar. It has a two party system but other parties do exist. There has recently been some change in this, as in the UK and I am not sure whether the two party tradition is likely to continue or not in Canada, but apart from in its most recent elections its always been one of the two main parties forming a majority government.

Le mie amiche brave in matematica erano un gruppo che si assottigliava di anno in anno, a botte di insinuazioni da parte di madri, insegnanti, amici maschi. Per qualche motivo, la matematica da sola bastava a renderti una secchiona defemminilizzata. Una con cui ""un ragazzo di cosa ci parla?!mica possono parlare di motori,per quello ha gli amici maschi!finisce che ti molla per quella che si veste meglio e a scuola va normale"".

E ovvio, a 11-13 anni, é il momento in cui pensi già di essere più brutta di una rana esplosa sul selciato e che il minimo faux-pas ti renderà una reietta.

Letteralmente, le mie amiche brave in matematica cercavano di nascondersi. Ti aiutavano coi compiti solo durante la ricreazione se non c'era nessuno in classe che potesse vederle,se qualcuno si avvicinava, minimizzavano ""Ah si, lo stialo facendo assieme l'esercizio:io sono scemissima, mamagari in due ce la facciamo"". Alla mia richiesta di spiegazioni, la mia amica mi ha detto una roba tipo ""Non é il caso che pensino che sia una matta colcervello strano che finiràmangiata dai suoi stessi gatti"".

Altre ignoravano la materia per un po' e perdevano il treno. Io stessa alle elementari me la cavavo, poi sono finita senza insegnanti alle medie. Potevo anche sforzarmi di mio, ma già avevo la reputazione da secchiona...che incentivo avevo?Socialmente, non potevi ""esporti""come brava nelle materie scientifiche. Ho avuti professori che dopo una brillante interrogazione di scienze hanno detto alle ragazze robe tipo ""Si pero' meno entusiasmo che senno' la finisci chiusa in un laboratorio puzzolente, e poi chi ti sposa?"" (terza media: ovviamente la tipa, mortificata, ha stroncato sul nascere la sua passione per i virus).

Per qualche motivo, in latino potevi essere un drago ed era normale, matematica no.

Alcune, nonostante questo ambiente sociale psicotico, ce l'hanno fatta, e sono entrate in Ingnegneria, una addirittura in matematica, e una in informatica. Mi hanno descritto quella che voi definite la ""sagra della salsiccia"", e molti altri inconvenienti. Sai con quanti ragazzi volevano solo studiare e invece giù di complicazioni?Piaccio a quello, se sono gentile con lui l'altro pensa che ci sto, quell'altro pensa che me la tiro, finisce che non vogliono più studiare con me, etc, etc..

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"&gt;The run-up in debt in Spain and Greece and Italy was the flip side of Germany’s success in containing workers’ wages and improving exports. Germany sold more stuff to Southern Europe than it bought. It took the profits and, in effect, lent the money back to those same Southern European countries. In Greece and Italy, it showed up as government borrowing, and in Spain as a housing bubble fueled by bank loans.

This is actually a *very* large and dubious claim, which is glossed over very quickly as if it were obvious common sense - the money had to go *somewhere*, right? But the proof that's offered is a graph showing current account surpluses of Germany against Spain, Italy, and Greece. That's a correlation, not proof of causation. And why isn't Ireland included? Well, because we had a current account surplus, like Germany. Did we also cause other people's debt problems? And how were Spain etc supposed to be financing their current account deficits back before Germany had a large current account surplus? And how come they can now have a current account surplus at the same time as Germany?

This seems like yet more from the ever-expanding school of incredibly shallow journalistic economic analysis that has bedeviled the crisis from the beginning. It's bar-stool economist, back of envelope, ""sounds right"" stuff.

This will embolden corporations in their ability to sue governments using the investor state dispute settlement. In short it'll destory governments already limited ability to stem corporation abuse

An example (as an aussie) you might recall the power gifted corporations, using the investor state dispute as part of a trade agreement with Hong Kong, is Phillip Morris using offshore lawyers to sue the fuck out of the Australian government when they voted on plain packaging for fags

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/27/philip-morris-australia-cigarette-packets 

then look at Canada in a similar disgusting partnership with the US

&gt;Eli Lilly is accusing Canada of violating its obligations to foreign investors under the North American Free Trade Agreement by allowing its courts to invalidate patents for two of its drugs.

For a TL:DR of the canadian case the canadian courts found that the patents the company filed for, **the drugs did not fulfill what the patents alleged to uphold**. You have a drug company creating glorified placebos and suing the government for incredible amounts. 

http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/eli-lilly-files-500m-nafta-suit-against-canada-over-drug-patents-1.1829854

&gt;These companies (along with hundreds of others) are using the investor-state dispute rules embedded in trade treaties signed by the countries they are suing. The rules are enforced by panels which have none of the safeguards we expect in our own courts. The hearings are held in secret. The judges are corporate lawyers, many of whom work for companies of the kind whose cases they hear. Citizens and communities affected by their decisions have no legal standing. There is no right of appeal on the merits of the case. Yet they can overthrow the sovereignty of parliaments and the rulings of supreme courts.

&gt;Even if these suits don't succeed, they can exert a powerful chilling effect on legislation. One Canadian government official, speaking about the rules introduced by the North American Free Trade Agreement, remarked: ""I've seen the letters from the New York and DC law firms coming up to the Canadian government on virtually every new environmental regulation and proposition in the last five years. They involved dry-cleaning chemicals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, patent law. Virtually all of the new initiatives were targeted and most of them never saw the light of day."" Democracy, as a meaningful proposition, is impossible under these circumstances.

**Kinda**. 

But yeah. Although it's probably more like a early, more independent-minded Texas which actually *might've* left if *it could*. Texas' annexation was half willingly/half a proverbial gun to their head. The difference here being, the United Kingdom *actually can leave* because it doesn't have the implication of armed conflict hanging over it's head. So the stakes are kinda higher. The last time Texas tried to secede, the Union beat them back into the Union, but who's gonna stop the United Kingdom if they decide to leave? ;) 

But I don't think the United Kingdom will leave, or hopefully it won't, so in that scenario yeah, it's like a modern-day Texas. ",0,1398336215,null,0,1398336576,0,ch0ppp6,t3_23tzy7,t1_ch0ppp6,t1_ch0pjwl,null,1433498110,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,RamblinRambo,FINL,Finland,"Look up how much gas we use and how much we need. Yes we import it from Russia but if we wan't we can use other sources as our consumption is extremely small compared to the continent. Our power and heat production is basically completely independent from gas. Gas is only used as a substitute and we can live without it from the perspective of energy and heating. 

I'd recommend that you got your facts straight.

&gt;In 2010 the share of gas in TPES was about **10%**. Finland was 100% dependent on a single supplier in gas, namely Russia, and there is no gas storage capacity. However, in Finland, **gas is essentially never used in direct heating of homes**, which are heated by direct electric heating, oil or district heating. 75% of gas is used for production of electricity or combined heat and power and in industry, with domestic use being rare. In total, 93% of the gas is sold to large installations directly rather than by retail. In Helsinki, however, there are 30,000 network-connected domestic gas users and 300 restaurants. **There is an alternative fuel obligation, so that in the event of a gas supply disturbance, other fuels can be immediately substituted**. The gas distribution network reaches only the southeastern coast, with the northernmost point at Ikaalinen.

As far as I could find it online - there's around 200 wolves in an entire Finland and there were no cases of wolves killing anyone in an entire 21st century. That's roughly half of wolves population in Poland and we didn't have any incidents with them either (other than killing live stock (notably: sheeps) - but government pays back for any lost animals to the wolves).

Also: there are other ways to resolve the problem if we'd even agree that there is one (IMHO: there isn't) - you can catch them and sell to other countries that try to reinstate their wolves population that was killed down to extinction.

&gt; I am sure that we'd work better as a union and even as a federal state than with the EU.

Tes critiques du FN n'en font absolument pas un parti marginal, elles sont tout autant valables pour les autres partis.

The age restrictions are the same as for movies: 0 (no restriction), 6, 12, 16 and 18.

Software without this certification may not be offered for sale to anyone outside of private businesses, and may not be made available by mail order.

In practice, it can be allowed if the product is actually sent through snail mail: it is then delivered only into the hands of the person named as the recipient on the address label, and the recipient must also provide government ID to ascertain both identity and age. Ordering online with a credit card is no guarantee, as a minor could very easily use a parent's credit card.

Furthermore, if the USK denies a certificate, the case may be referred to the BPjM. This office may decide to ""index"" the game if it is found to, for example, glorify violence. The game is not completely banned, but cannot be advertised, and may only be sold to adults who actually physically go into a store (which must not allow entry to minors) and ask for it by title.

1) The ruling party, PO (part of EPP)

On Monday, our PM's channel uploaded a short video of PM singing *Hey, Jude* ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ewM9xxspF0))
It turned out to be a teaser of a longer vid about our 10 years in the EU. ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTZuH-Az4cc)). The party is alleged to fund it's campaign by public money (cost of shooting both materials, over 7M PLN was covered by the PM's office, not the party itself).

General message of PO during this campaign will propably picture them as a strong pro- European voice. PM Tusk has also compared the upcoming elections in the Ukrainian context to pre-1939 situation, indicating his party to be a reliable choice for the harsh times coming. The statement has been widely critisised.

2) PiS (Eur. conservatives and reformists)

The main opposition party includes many domestic issues in it's EU-campaign. Among the European issues, they constantly demand the government to persuade the EU to take more serious actions against Russia.

Most candidates of PiS express their attatchment to christian values.
Here's an [example, no. 1 candidate from the Kraków region](http://wybierzpis.org.pl/profile/ryszard-legutko/):

*In the European Parliament I am going to:*

*-defend the civilisation of life and fight for excluding issues of world-view beliefs from the European legislation (Well, it's a hard one for me to translate, he propably wants the EU not to mess with our anti-abortion law, lack of same-sex marriages/civil partnerships etc.)*

*-suppport strengthening the energy security in the member states*

*-advocate for creating a regional Carpathian strategy*

Their slogan for the election is: To serve Poland, to listen to the Polish people.

3) SLD (European Socialist &amp; Democrats, S&amp;D)


This time, SLD is focusing on European issues, posing as a member of strong European alliance. Their slogan: heading for change. They also present themselves as an alternative for the 2 biggest parties.

4)Your move/your movement, registered for the election as Europa Plus (I guess, they're going to join S&amp;D if they get any seats), 


They are calling for tighter European integration and present themselves as a modern, European voice in an overly conservative country. 

Here's a spot of one of their leaders: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UlaDRU4ZbM

A significant development would be something which was not such a forgone conclusion and actually had effect on the situation.

It's birthrate is 1.39 children per woman and dropping (you need 2 kids per woman for the population to not drop). That means that in 2040 Japan's population will be only 80 million with the workforce half of what it is today and a pensioner population double of what it is today. Half the workforce produces half the money, while 2 times the pensioner population costs 2 times the money. Add the 10 trillion (and mounting) debt to all that and you're golden.

true,G_Morgan,WALE,Wales,"&gt; but I'm pretty sure the UK, and perhaps Australia and whatnot, have surely admitted some colonial crimes as well.

A big difficulty is the UK recognised and did a great deal about its crimes hundreds of years ago. Slavery is the one that always comes up. The Empire spent $200B buying out every slave in the Empire. War was declared on multiple nations to put a stop to slavery. Multiple nations banned slavery mainly because the UK coerced them into it either as defeated opponents or prospective allies. Including France at the signing of Entente Cordiale.

This isn't to white wash what the British Empire did. The pre-1706 policies of the UK were at best apathetic towards a vast crime, at worse actively co-operating with it. It is just hard to appropriate judge direct modern responsibility when the Empire spent so vastly and did so much over two centuries before anyone alive today was even born.

More modern crimes have apparently been covered up and those perhaps need to be looked at.

&gt; i can tell you that to deny nations existed before pre mid XIX is a gross misunderstanding of how peoples and cultures have evolved through human history. 

Do you understand how abstract and sophisticated the concept of nation really is? I'm not even talking about nationalism. I mean the construction of a sense of nation built on common mythos, ethnical similarities, geographical limits (or not!), religion and so on. Extremadura has all these things as well, but nobody would even think about calling Extremadura a nation, why is that? Well, because there was a process in the early 19th century called Romanticism that birthed the modern concept of nation.

true,barsoap,SCHL,Sleswig-Holsteen,"German states actually have the highest nominal degree of sovereignty I'm aware of: They're sovereign subjects to international law, that is, can sign treaties etc. with other state and non-state international entities under their own name.

The federation needs to OK a treaty if it's with another state because they're generally responsible for foreign relations but if, say, Schleswig-Holstein wants to fund a TV station jointly with Denmark, the federation doesn't have a chance to say no and have it hold up before the constitutional court.

Concerning a treaty with, say, the Holy See (which is not the Vatican), the federation doesn't get a say whatsoever. 

The federation also doesn't get a say when different German states sign treaties among themselves. Which happens relatively often, areas where states have legislations sometimes still make sense to legislate federation-wide (or at least close to so), so you get broadcasting, gambling etc. treaties. These are actually legally on the same level as just any other international treaty.

In short: While German states might not have very much independence, that which they have is unviolable and utterly, utterly independent. This not only applies to legislative and judicature, but also the executive: Unlike in the US, you won't see ""FBI"" agents just taking over a crime scene in Germany.

Da gibt es nichts zu entschuldigen und es hätte eigentlich viel mehr Einwände dagegen geben sollen, insbesondere aus dem ""Westen"".

Mir kommt es aber immer öfter so vor als wäre das Argument es sei dort schließlich eine faschistische Regierung im Amt für viele Menschen in Deutschland Legitimation genug dass Putin bzw. die russische Führung unter dem Vorwand der Bedrohung ihrer ""Bürger"" (die meines Wissens nach größtenteils russischsprachige Ukrainer und nicht Russen sind) mit Angriffen gegen das Nachbarland bzw. im Falle der Krim mit einer Annexion reagieren darf. Auch die Änderung des Sprachengesetzes nach der Russisch als Amtssprache in den östlichen Regionen der Ukraine abgeschafft werden sollte war absolut falsch und hätte nie so vorgeschlagen werden dürfen. Es hätte allerdings genug andere diplomatische Mittel für Russland gegeben dagegen vorzugehen wenn es der russischen Führung wirklich daran gelegen wäre dass russischsprachige Ukrainer uneingeschränkt in der Ukraine leben können. Dass allerdings mehr oder weniger sofort militärisch gedroht bzw. im Falle der Krim vorgegangen wurde spricht in meinen Augen für sich. Wie das mit einer eigentlich konsequent anti-militaristischen Linken zusammenpassen soll kann ich mir auch nicht erklären - obwohl ich es gerne zumindest verstehen würde.

Oh, it worked well enough for Bavaria when they were still poor. Now that they're rich it shows what ""solidarity"" means to those Schweinehunde.

Berlin is the one and only real culprit when it comes to massive fuckup, anyway. Don't you dare bash on say Schleswig-Holstein in this regard, first getting off our feet was nearly impossible due to having to take in *massive* amounts of East-Prussian refugees, and to add insult to injury we get overlooked in virtually every federal stimulus programme. Remember those broken locks in the Kiel Channel? Well, it applies to the whole state.

Bavaria gets the exact opposite side of that stick, due to the CSU being a force of their own on the federal level. 

Maybe we should invade and conquer Hamburg? That'd change things quite a bit.

Also, before we'd change the thing *one* very important taxation principle would need to be changed: Right now companies pay corporate tax only in the state of their main seat, even if they earn most their money in other states.

Judging by only military sides of operation, it looks that the organized resistance would be squashed and the war would become a guerrilla a la Balkans. With support from the miners who gone on strike since yesterday.

So, lets start with the fact that HIV testing is not anonymous (and not free in public hospitals).

Also, since 2012, 3rd party nationals do not have easy access to hospitals so they cannot get tested. It is problematic because inevitably they are pushed towards a high risk lifestyle (prostitution and/or drugs).

When you get tested, as I said, it is not anonymous.  Your HIV status is kept in a database by the ministry of health and shared to any government body that asks. 

For example, when a student was accepted into high school, his HIV+ status was disclosed to the headmaster and all professors. If that wasn't bad enough, the professors gossiped about it and it even make it into national newspapers. The student had to deal with both the stigma of being HIV positive,  and being percived as gay (although his infection might have been drug related or anything else).

More over, the police uses that status against you. When you are arrested while HIV+, you are always charged with attempt for aggravated bodily harm with intend, because the officers had to *touch* you. It's up to your defence to fight this charge. To be fair, most courts get convinced to drop that charge in a couple of sessions. 

But even when the charges are dropped, the police uses it for character assassination as with the African police brutality victim, Sylvain, last November. The initial public outcry subdued after the police leaked his HIV status,  and last week, the attorney general dismissed Sylvain's case against the cops. His undeage son was also taken for *forced* HIV testing after Sylvain was hospitalised with a broken leg.

The data protection commissioner took a stance in favour of publicising the names of HIV individuals because 'public health over privacy', with the danger factors being very vague.

As a result, people do avoid the cypriot government when they are HIV+. Last year the ministry of health had the audacity to complain about ""all those cypriots who hide their HIV status and make use of hospitals in TRNC, Greece or the UK, that do not share the results with us"".

And then you have societal attitudes, ignorance of what HIV and AIDS really are, and NGOs that do more harm than good.",0,1398344931,null,0,1398345429,0,ch0rpml,t3_23uki5,t1_ch0rpml,t1_ch0qi2t,null,1433499123,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Detto questo, sono d'accordissimo su quello che dici. Anzi, dico di più: quelli che lo criticano tirando fuori spesso le argomentazioni che riporti (non è abbastanza, andava fatto di più, le priorità sono diverse) sono destinati a perdere, e per lo stesso motivo per cui Berlusconi vinceva spessissimo sulla sinistra. Primo: è Renzi (come era Berlusconi una volta) che ""impone"" di cosa si discute, che sia la riforma del lavoro, gli 80euro, il senato, o quel cazzo che tirerà fuori dal cilindro Renzi la prossima volta. Secondo: in questo modo le opposizioni possono sostanzialmente dire solamente di no, nelle modalità che hai giustamente elencato. E dire di ""no"" è perdente in partenza, perché se a uno che ha uno stipendio da 1200 euro gli dici che gli 80 euro in più che ha ricevuto è solo propaganda ti manda un po' affanculo, e pure giustamente.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"&gt;You know, there's actual data about where the money went. Here's an article about this.

Ah yes - and it's based on misused statistics, too:

&gt;German banks had amassed claims of $704 billion on Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, much more than the German banks’ aggregate capital. In other words, they lent more than they could afford. 

The author uses BIS statistics, which are going to introduce a massive distortion in the case of Ireland, because we have German bank subsidiaries in our financial services centre. These account for 95%+, or a couple of hundred billion, of German banks' ""exposure to Ireland"", and are absolutely nothing to do with the Irish banks, Irish economy, or the Irish bailout. Despite which, we had several years of articles claiming exactly what this one does - that the troika bailout really bailed out Germany.

I'm afraid that too is simplistic rubbish, based on misused statistics.

&gt;Depends on the size of the surplus, obviously. 

Well, we would presumably be responsible to the extent of our surplus. The logic is unavoidable. And we are, after all, the second biggest exporter in the EU after Germany - not ""per capita"" but in absolute terms - so presumably we're pretty culpable.

&gt;Why is that strange? The fact that everyone is trying to out-compete each other in fiscal discipline means there's ""winners"" and there's ""losers"". Are you denying the fact that one country's exports are another country's imports? It's logistically impossible for everyone to have a surplus at the same time. 

You miss the point. If the fact that the PIIGS (well, some of them) had deficits at the same time as Germany is offered as showing Germany's responsibility for their deficits, why doesn't the same relationship now hold true? If they can *now* compete with Germany, who couldn't they *then*? 

&gt;That may be. But I'd like to see you say the same about the whole ""they were just profligate and lived beyond their means"" rhetoric as well. That's even more ""bar-stool economist, back of envelope, sounds right stuff"" but it's been the main explanation everyone hears about the crisis for the past 5 years. 

Well, it does rather hold in the case of Greece. And in Ireland as well - we *were* profligate (ask me about benchmarking, or the removal of nearly everyone from the income tax net), and *did* live beyond our means, if by ""means"" one means ""a sustainable long term tax base"" or even ""in a way that doesn't require constantly rising house prices"". 

That there's some truth in it (it's not the only truth) is shown by the fact that those countries have been able to regain competitiveness vis a vis Germany - which strongly implies, given the absence of devaluations, that they were *able* to do so at any time, but* preferred* not to.",0,1398345727,null,0,false,0,ch0rywy,t3_23u2wr,t1_ch0rywy,t1_ch0qqha,null,1433499238,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Europe, as it is now, has a [ageing population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Europe) which it desperately needs to correct. It has a decrease in fertility, a decrease in mortality rate, and a higher life expectancy, all of which will only stress and put more burden on many European countries economies *(as well as increase their debt)*. [By 2050, an estimated 35% of the European population will be over the age of 60.](http://www.thematuremarket.com/SeniorStrategic/ageing_population_european_facts-6204-5.html)

Compare this to the United States, which has a [population growth rate](https://www.google.com/search?q=United+States+Population+growth&amp;oq=United+States+Population+growth&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.7604j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8) close to 3.5x that of [Europe](http://www.indexmundi.com/european_union/population_growth_rate.html).  By 2050 close to [20% of the population](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/776.full) is predicted to be over the age of 60, which while not ideal, is still 15% better than Europe, or, in short, a 1/5th of the American population compared to Europe's 1/3rd. 

Economically, we are also faring rather well.  [America came out of the recession four years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Great_Recession), the European Union did as well, but had [a double-dip recession](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/15/eurozone-double-dip-recession) shortly afterwards, [which it only exited from last August](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/13/eurozone-exit-double-dip-recession). In short, we *(America)* still have years of growth *(albeit small)* while Europe as a whole still has years of recession/loss looming over it's head. We've reached pre-2008 levels this year IIRC, but Europe still has a long way to go before it regains the ground it's lost.

Plus, America had a 2013 [GDP growth of 2.6%](https://www.google.com/search?q=united+states+annual+gdp+growth+rate&amp;oq=united+states+annual+gdp+growth+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.15017j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8), compared to the European Union's 2013 [GDP growth of .2%](http://rt.com/business/eu-gdp-q3-eurostat-707/) (remember, the E.U. was in recession in 2012). And since our growth has remained relatively stable, our economy is growing at something like 12x that of Europe. And our 2013 growth numbers are supposed to be even higher, so expect that multiple to rise. If IIRC, we're even projected to surpass the European Union's economy by 2020.

Unemployment wise, the European Union has a [unemployment rate of 10.9%](https://www.google.com/search?q=European+Union+unemployment+rate&amp;oq=European+Union+unemployment+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5239j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8) and the Eurozone an unemployment rate of [12.1%, which is projected to go up to 12.3 percent](http://www.dw.de/oecd-predicts-record-eurozone-unemployment-for-2014/a-16953636)  by the end of the year. The United States has [a unemployment rate of 7.3%](https://www.google.com/search?q=United+States+Unemployment+rate&amp;oq=United+States+Unemployment+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5218j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8), which  is projected to [fall below 7%](http://www.dw.de/oecd-predicts-record-eurozone-unemployment-for-2014/a-16953636)  by the end of the year.

&gt;things like the shared taxi and being held at knifepoint, did you see that somehow coming during the taxi ride or came it out of the blue ?

The taxi wasn't held at knifepoint. Instead of taking me all the way back to Diyarbakir the driver dropped me off at a bus depot and paid for my ticket. I was held at knifepoint at the bus depot (very small and deserted). 

I was only near the Eastern borders. Turkey doesn't have many crossings, it might be easier to enter from Iraq (although I haven't researched it, so dont take my word for it). But the Syrian Kurds are still faced with pretty heavy fighting from some pretty nasty factions, ISIS being one of them. The Syrian Kurdish area might be worth a visit, but I would definitely use caution. 

Out West is where the main borders are, so I would assume they are much more guarded. [Here is a picture of part of the border](http://i.imgur.com/Orx5aFM.jpg) out east. Everything across the river is Syria, but you'd need to go for a swim or have a boat.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; The author uses BIS statistics, which are going to introduce a massive distortion in the case of Ireland, because we have German bank subsidiaries in our financial services centre. These account for 95%+, or a couple of hundred billion, of German banks' ""exposure to Ireland"", and are absolutely nothing to do with the Irish banks, Irish economy, or the Irish bailout. Despite which, we had several years of articles claiming exactly what this one does - that the troika bailout really bailed out Germany.

So, your explanation about the massive bubble that was the Irish economy in 2008 is what exactly? Where did the extra money come from? Anyway, my point is not that everything is Germany's fault, my point is that the insistence that on fiscal discipline and competitiveness is misguided and cannot by themselves solve the problem. 

&gt; You miss the point. If the fact that the PIIGS (well, some of them) had deficits at the same time as Germany is offered as showing Germany's responsibility for their deficits, why doesn't the same relationship now hold true?

Depends on who's holding the debt in each case. if the data shows that it was German money that was flowing as loans into the periphery economies, then obviously they have some responsibility as lenders. 

&gt;  If they can now compete with Germany, who couldn't they then? 

What?

&gt; Well, it does rather hold in the case of Greece.

They are also the slowest to change them. In 2009 the G20 agreed to revamp its securities laws by 2012. None of the countries met that ambitious target, but when the US implemented some of the agreed upon changes a few months ago it was cautioned by the EU that it was moving too fast. The new EU target is 2020. 

Dont assume the US is the only country that can have an asset bubble, especially given the US has stronger financial regulations than the EU, and it made them stronger after 2008. 

You also completely ignored the post above you about demographics. That is a big deal. China, Russia, Japan, the EU all have declining populations, the US has a growing population thanks to immigration. I'm not nearly as worried about it as you are.

&gt;**The fascist ideals of Generation Identity**

&gt;So what is Generation Identity all about? What are its guiding ideals? One good place to turn is a book published by one of the movement’s most prominent voices, Markus Willinger. In his highly readable short polemic, Generation Identity: A Declaration of War Against the ’68ers – also published by Arktos, who produce a vast array of intellectual material relevant to the New Right tradition – he talks of a coming nationalist revolution where multiculturalism will be no more, and where traditions forgotten by a generation of Europeans will be restored. Tellingly, this self-styled ‘declaration of war’ is available in translation both as a Kindle download as well as a paperback book. Born only in 1992, Willinger claims he is currently a student at the University of Stuttgart, yet he has produced an accomplished piece of fascist writing – one engaging with many of the tropes familiar to those who analyse such texts.

&gt;Fairly typically, the theme of generations is crucial to Willinger’s framing of an alleged crisis to which Generation Identity has the answer. He argues that the generation that came before him, ‘the 68ers’ as he simplifies, were overtaken by a series of allegedly crazy, utopian and universal ideals. This ‘cultural Marxism’ (a term also employed by Anders Breivik among many others on the far right) has allowed for mass immigration, which in turn was followed by the onset of a crisis in national identity across Europe. The ’68ers themselves were driven to this misplaced idealism by their knee-jerk response to the horrors of Nazism, he continues. Trying to distance all this from sympathy with interwar fascism, he stresses that the failure of the ’68ers has now created a crisis in the present, which needs to be overcome by a new movement driven by Willinger’s generation: Generation Identity. This new movement, he claims, rejects both Nazism and postwar multiculturalism.

&gt;**Fascism revisited**

&gt;All this is set within a powerful language of war against the established elites, and overthrowing a corrupt generation focused on individualism, with a new generation who will put the ideals of the national community ahead of individual rights. Yet these were core themes found across the very same interwar fascist movements from which Willinger tries to distance himself.  So in reality, Willinger’s polemic calling for a cleansing of Europe, while also restoring a strong sense of ‘traditional’ national identity, is an ideal that is very reminiscent of interwar fascism. Moreover, as with all fascist ideologies, there is a powerful call for a spiritual revolution to accompany the overthrowing of a generation of corrupt individualists, one that develops a sense of societal redemption achieved through participating in radical political action and by resorting to a strong sense of identity.  To judge the tenor here, take this quote from the preface of the book arguing that a new era will emerge from the activism of Generation Identity:

&gt;&gt;A new political current is sweeping through Europe. It has one goal, one symbol, and one thought: Identity.

&gt;&gt;It is the current of our generation. It represents European youth. A youth that wants the one thing that the ideology of the ’68ers can’t give it: a future … It is taking form and proclaiming the end of the era of the ’68ers, a new epoch, the age of a new generation: generation identity.

&gt;The book is shot through with a powerful sense of urgency too. Throughout, Willinger stresses warfare is needed if this new era is to be born. So this is a fight for a new society, one that will overturn the decadent wreckage of the woolly liberalism and Marxism of the ’68ers.

&gt;Unsurprisingly given the name of the movement perhaps, the theme of identity is used to analyse a wide range of topics, from history to economics. Yet at each turn, Willinger diagnoses the same phenomenon: current elites are letting down a sense of traditional identity and need to be overturned. Injustice surrounding the recent economic disaster looms large in this analysis, suggesting that it has taken away job opportunities for the emerging generation, but has not punished an older generation who remain secure in their positions. Meanwhile, telling discussions on gender promote a return to clear male and female gender identities, and he decries the promotion of gay marriages, ‘alliances of queers and transvestites, the union of nothingness’.

&gt;**So he is a homophobe but is he racist?**

&gt;In a word, yes. But the language of Generation Identity also adopts the classic positioning of ‘differentialist racism’. This framing of racism claims that those who promote multiculturalism are destroying people’s true identities by blurring all cultures into one, while those who decry it are the true respecters of cultural and racial difference. Yet at bottom, such views tend to develop a sense of white victimhood and call for some form of repatriation of non-whites from Europe typical of fascist racism.

&gt;Indeed, Willinger is quick to claim that he and his movement are not racists, and can even be seen as defending the purity of other identities in a way that multiculturalism fails to do. Yet there is little original in such attempts at inverting the charge of racism to suggest that conserving the ‘purity’ of all races is not a racist perspective. So when developing such themes, he is drawing on territory already carved out by the New Right tradition, which has regularly tried to cast those who promote multiculturalism as people who do not respect authentic identities, and so are the true modern racists.

&gt;Just as with the wider the New Right discourse, Willinger stresses that he respects all identities, just so long as they are allowed to exist in their own part of the world. Thus all Chinese should live in China, all Africans should live in Africa, and so forth. As such, migrants to Europe are posing a real problem to a white identity, and so Europeans are the victims of the spread of immigrants across the continent. As he develops this sense of European victimhood:

&gt;&gt;We are more disenfranchised than they are. We don’t want Mehmed and Mustafa to become Europeans. We don’t want immigrants to take over our identities and give up their own.

&gt;&gt;They should hold on to their own identities, and let us have ours. We don’t ask more than is obvious: Europe belongs to Europeans alone. We are the rightful heirs to this continent, and we will not give up our inheritance.

&gt;So he calls for ‘ethnopluralism’ to replace multiculturalism, and stresses, ‘We oppose your credo of multiculturalism with the principle of ethnopluralism. Instead of mixing and standardisation, we want to preserve difference. We want different peoples, cultures, and identities. Our own included!’ But in reality, this just a more sophisticated way to argue a for racist position promoting the ‘purity’ of the white race, one akin to those put out by the interwar fascists.",1,1398348922,null,0,1398349301,0,ch0t5zz,t3_23usht,t1_ch0t5zz,t3_23usht,null,1433499802,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

And when that bubble burst, all the people who took out disproportionately large loans for overpriced property found their assets to be worth a tenth of what they paid for.

I don't think this was specifically a problem Germany caused, or rather, I don't think they *exclusively* caused it. The Irish banks are very much culpable in the conditions that lead to the bubble and bust, as well as governmental corruption.

But to absolve German involvement is revisionist, at best, and to think of the bailouts and subsequent extreme austerity imposed on both us and Southern Europe, as anything other than self-preservation, is blind.

Per esempio i diritti civili dei gay, certo.

Io sono contrario al posto fisso, da sempre credo nel modello anglo-sassone del mercato del lavoro.

Ma non si può sostituire il posto fisso con la schiavitù come ha fatto il partito democratico in Italia. Oggi chi è precario non ha alcun tipo di tutela, non ha diritto a ferie nè malattia, non ha accesso al credito, non ci sono ammortizzatori sociali. Hanno creato una generazioni di schiavi dicendogli che serviva ""flessibilità"". E lo hanno fatto proprio loro del PD eh, vai a vedere chi ha introdotto il precariato in Italia.

E non lo dico per interesse personale, ho un bel lavoro, non ho problemi economici. E peraltro mi sono appena licenziato dal posto fisso per andare all'estero. Ma bisogna essere davvero ciechi per non vedere i disastri prodotti da quel tipo di riforme sul mercato del lavoro.

J'ai lu le programme du FN et ses thèses économiques ne peuvent attirer que ceux qui n'ont pas compris que ce n'est pas simple de lutter contre la mondialisation et que ce n'est pas de la mauvaise volonté qui anime les autres gouvernements, seulement les gouvernements sont dépassés et ce n'est pas en revenant en arrière socialement qu'on règlera les problèmes.

No dico, a parte i matrimoni gay, per cui si può aprire una diatriba piuttosto lungotta e sui cui in Italia non esiste ancora un fronte popolare massivo, quali altri ""diritti civili"" il PD non ha provato a tutelare?

&gt;Ho parlato di diritto a ferie e malattia e di accesso al credito, ho parlato di ammortizzatori sociali, cosa c'entra col posto fisso ?

Come diceva il tuo CCNL di riferimento, sono tutte cose tutelate dai contratti per i tempi indeterminati. 

&gt; Il problema è che se sei un precario e vai in malattia non prendi stipendio. Il problema è che non hai ferie.

Aspetta, quella è la BASE del lavoro precario: non sei più ""assunto"", ma garantisci un lavoro fatto come se tu fossi un lavoratore indipendente, come un idraulico. Mica dai le ferie al tuo idraulico, no? 

Se però i lavoratori non hanno capito questa cosa e si aspettano praticamente lo stesso trattamento di quando avevano il posto fisso, eh, peggio per loro (premesso che sarebbe stato dovere dei sindacati muoversi per difendere 'sta gente, che però al tempo stesso è sempre stata lontana dai sindacati, quindi chi lo faceva a fare ai sindacati di difendere 'sta gente?).

&gt;Il problema è che non hai nessun accesso al credito

Questo è un problema ""secondario"", nel senso che viene dopo la stesura della legge (mica c'è scritto che non hai accesso al credito). è data dalla scarsa fiducia che le banche hanno verso la nostra imprenditoria ed economia. Però oh, mica possiamo obbligarle a dare soldi.  Non che non sia un problemone, neh. Solo non darei la colpa alla politica.

ANGELA MERKEL has a favourite mantra to offer troubled euro-zone countries: they should copy Germany. As she put it last autumn: “What we have done, everyone else can do.” Fifteen years ago, the chancellor’s analysis goes, her country was widely regarded as the sick man of Europe. Then it opted for fiscal austerity, cut labour costs and embraced structural reforms, turning it into an economic powerhouse.

The gap between Germany and southern countries in the euro zone is indeed wide. Its economy is growing faster than most of theirs; youth unemployment in Germany is at a 20-year low, whereas it remains at record highs in Spain and Greece; and the German budget is in surplus, even as France, Italy and Spain struggle to hit deficit targets fixed in Brussels.

[Economic Reform, 2011-2012](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/print-edition/20140426_LDC147.png)

When it comes to fiscal prudence, Mrs Merkel is a paragon. Indeed, this newspaper wishes she were a little less austere, and spent more to boost Europe’s demand. But on structural reform, her record is weak. The credit for Germany’s rebound should really go to the “Agenda 2010” reforms started by her predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, in 2003. Since then Mrs Merkel has had the odd flourish—she bravely raised the normal retirement age to 67 in her first term—but overall Germany comes a lowly 28th out of 34 countries ranked by the OECD in terms of reforms since the financial crisis hit.

The Germans have an obvious riposte to this: southern Europeans had a lot of ground to make up. Less easy to explain is the fact that Mrs Merkel’s “grand coalition” government is now actually heading backwards, increasing the burden on German business [(see article)](http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21601312-indulging-her-social-democratic-coalition-partners-angela-merkel-risks-turning-germany).

Three examples illustrate the trend. On pensions, instead of continuing to raise the retirement age, the government is actually cutting it for certain workers to 63 or even, in extreme cases, to 61. Second, it is introducing a national minimum wage at a relatively high level, which is likely to lead to job losses, especially in the east. And finally, Mrs Merkel’s Energiewende (energy change) is not only eating up huge sums in subsidies for renewables, but also saddling German companies with electricity prices nearly three times as high as America’s.

None of these things will cripple the German juggernaut in the short term. You can even make the argument that by pushing up German costs and increasing wages, Mrs Merkel is indirectly helping her euro-zone partners. But there are many less harmful ways for her to do that. If she had wanted to push ahead, plenty of areas—energy, retailing and professional services, where Germany has some of the OECD’s most protectionist regulations—are ripe for reform.

**Not north v south but reform v laggard**

Europe’s biggest economy is backsliding, and that sets a terrible example. Consider another big laggard in terms of reform: France. Only two years ago the Germans were rightly indignant when the newly elected French president, François Hollande, had the temerity to cut the pension age for certain workers. Now that Mrs Merkel is doing the same, why should Mr Hollande pay any attention?

One popular narrative in the euro saga is that it has pitched virtuous, hard-working and thrifty northerners against feckless, indolent and profligate southerners. The north has certainly done better during the crisis. Like Germany, the Netherlands, the Baltics and the Scandinavians did more to reform their economies and improve competitiveness in the years before it broke. But since then the reform momentum has been much stronger in Mediterranean countries. Even Italy and France, under two new youthful prime ministers, Matteo Renzi and Manuel Valls, are talking up the reform cause.

That is exposing the weakness not just of Germany but also of several other countries. In the Netherlands, for instance, there has been almost no reform lately, consumers are burdened by debt and growth has all but stopped. Even in Scandinavia, usually Europe’s star performer, things are not looking as good as they were: growth has slowed in Denmark and Finland, which may soon lose its AAA credit rating, and there are signs of a reversal of reforms in some places.

These countries’ leaders need to remember that the pursuit of greater competitiveness is not a one-off affair but a continuous process. Too often in the past two decades European governments have responded to crisis by pushing through painful changes, only to lapse into complacency as soon as they show results. Nor is it enough to be competitive only within Europe. There is another mantra Mrs Merkel likes to repeat to her colleagues: Europe accounts for 7% of the world’s population, 25% of GDP and 50% of social-welfare spending. Germany’s current course will exacerbate that problem.

true,Alpha023,TURK,Turkey,"I like how you insult your own people. Thats ok but it is really unnecessary. There is a difference between walking for the murdered Hrant Dink and then accepting some lies and insult on the internet. Like why always saying 1.5 Mil died when even wikipedia says 1-1.5 mil. Why exaggerate the numbers? Why don't we talk about the death on both sides? Yes Armenians were effected more and there was the techir law which is a horrible thing but we also have to understand the environment at that time. I see people are comparing Holocaust to Armenian genocide yet they are very different things. You cannot compare the two. 

The biggest issue I have with all Armenians giving out stats or info about the genocide is that they are all one sided. Life is not black and white people. Ottomans weren't some blood thirsty creatures looking for a massacre. Murders and killings happened on the both sides. Yes, what happened to Armenians is horrible but if you want the world to accept the genocide, you should also recognize what Armenians did also at that time(Not every single of them of course). I am sorry too for what happened but I am not going to call it a genocide. This term has become a very political term for some people to use it against their enemies or rivals. As far as I know, my ancestors weren't involved in this mess but as a Turkish men I have to also stick to my people. 

Last issue I have with this day is that this is a day for Armenians to hate Turks with all their guts. This day isn't a remembrance day anymore but more of a yearly attack on Turkey and Turkish people. The hostility I saw by the Armenians(Especially in US) is crazy. Some people were ready to beat me up when I didn't even know them. This is wrong. This kind of hatred will solve nothing. Especially after what ASALA did to Turkish diplomats for the revenge, it will be very hard for the turkish people to come to a point to apologize. I bet this hatred is same for some Turkish people but if we are willing to achieve peace someway in the future, both sides will have to compromise.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"&gt;Anyway, my point is not that everything is Germany's fault, my point is that the insistence that on fiscal discipline and competitiveness is misguided and cannot by themselves solve the problem.

Well, I agree with your point, certainly - I just don't like what are, in Ireland, at least, very standard misrepresentations of our bubble and burst.

&gt;So, your explanation about the massive bubble that was the Irish economy in 2008 is what exactly? Where did the extra money come from? 

The ""extra money"" does not have to come from somewhere else. Banks create money when lending, although they do need external money for liquidity and capital. For the Irish banks' loan books to balloon up to 3.5 times Irish GDP, only a small amount of non-Irish money was needed, and most if that seems to have come from the US and UK - hardly a surprise, given that's where Irish banks traditionally raise money. The idea that Irish banks were suddenly on the receiving end of a huge flow of German money never made sense, because Irish banks don't in general tap the Frankfurt money markets - they tap the London and New York ones.

&gt;Depends on who's holding the debt in each case. if the data shows that it was German money that was flowing as loans into the periphery economies, then obviously they have some responsibility as lenders. 

First, that's a big ""if"", particularly in Ireland's case. Second, what does ""responsibility as lenders"" really mean? German lenders didn't get together and decide to lend to the periphery en masse, let alone push money on the periphery, nor was it some kind of German government policy to do so, or encourage it to be done. There are many many lending decisions, from many many different companies, involved in the movement of money around Europe. Summing these up as if ""Germany"" was a single company that invested in ""Greece"" or any other peripheral country is kind of nonsensical.

&gt;What?

Well, there's either a relation between Germany's current account and the current accounts of the PIIGS, or there isn't. What's being claimed is that Germany's surplus = PIIGS deficit. But that relationship is only true for a particular period. It wasn't the case when Germany was the ""sick man of Europe"", and it's not now true - why does the bit in the middle get treated as the only relevant bit?

&gt;You are willing to cut some extraordinary amount of slack for this narrative. The point is that competitiveness and ""living within your means"" is only a small part of the whole story. 

It's one of the larger bits that's supported by actual evidence. Ireland *was* quite definitely living beyond its means. Is it somehow unimportant that the Irish government encouraged the property bubble with every means at its disposal, and shifted the tax base from income taxes to the windfall gains available from the bubble? That it treated an asset bubble in exactly the same way that banana republics traditionally treat windfall gains from commodity prices, by splashing cash on vanity projects and pumping up the civil service payroll and welfare payments in search of votes?

Do you think these things are *un*important?",0,1398354958,null,0,false,0,ch0vy9h,t3_23u2wr,t1_ch0vy9h,t1_ch0sks6,null,1433501114,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; The ""extra money"" does not have to come from somewhere else. Banks create money when lending, although they do need external money for liquidity and capital. For the Irish banks' loan books to balloon up to 3.5 times Irish GDP, only a small amount of non-Irish money was needed, and most if that seems to have come from the US and UK - hardly a surprise, given that's where Irish banks traditionally raise money. The idea that Irish banks were suddenly on the receiving end of a huge flow of German money never made sense, because Irish banks don't in general tap the Frankfurt money markets - they tap the London and New York ones.

Fair enough. 

&gt; Summing these up as if ""Germany"" was a single company that invested in ""Greece"" or any other peripheral country is kind of nonsensical.

Well, obviously I did not mean it that way. But it's hard to refute the point that the architecture of the eurozone encouraged this behaviour and that the countries should at least acknowledge that and take it into account when battling the crisis. 

&gt; why does the bit in the middle get treated as the only relevant bit?

You're of course right that it isn't the only relevant bit. But what exactly does that refute? The way I understand it is that these sorts of articles are trying to shed light on the relationship between surplus regions and deficit regions and only aim to demonstrate that one country's wage repression has a beggar-thy-neighbour effect on the competitiveness of other countries. That bit is not refuted by your argument. 

&gt; Do you think these things are unimportant?

No, you're right, it's definitely important. But that only shows that ""periphery countries"" took a short-term profit approach in dealing with the bubbles that were being created.

true,SkyPL,SILE,"Poland, Lower Silesia","It's very complex issue, really. I can barely lick the surface here. IMHO the major cause of that lays in a fact that major part of EU knows first hand what censorship and what propaganda is from an *evil* state (Americans historically had it done only by their own state).

What Americans consider to be ""patriotic"" for us, Europeans, very much reminds the best days of CCCP / Goebbels (no offence meant, we're just by far less patriotic than Americans). Yea, methods changed since then, sure, but in many ways restrictions you put on the internet remind people the restrictions on a printed press from communism (or WW2 Nazi propaganda), so that's why we're resisting by far more to the influence of  government / corporate lobbyists than you do, and that's why we still have MEPs fighting for neutral Internet and it's much easier to find a support for that in EU than it'd be in US.

Yes, pretty much every point I gave here can be countered with various examples where it's not truth (eg. UK wasn't occupied by Nazis nor Communists - but on the other hand now it happens to be the most restrictive country when it comes to the Internet freedom in EU), Europe got vastly more diverse history than US, but I'm trying to give you an idea how history shaped the behavior of current politicians.

Then there is a fact that European anti-piracy agencies are uncoordinated and each one speaks with it's own voice, so there is not so much of a directed pressure from them. They also got lower budget than US counterparts and they're mostly focused on affecting laws in individual countries as opposite to affecting EU parliament and commission (they still do it, only not on a RIAA scale).

I'm certain other people can give you much more ideas why law is so different between US and EU when it comes to this matter.

&gt; My only guess is that each member state in the EU has several news stations

Many of them are owned by few corporations across different countries printing different titles. Axel Springer is most obvious example, and often relations between large media conglomerates in EU are so complex that you'd be amazed. Yes, there is more ""free"" press in EU than US, but the difference isn't as huge as you might think on a first glance.

&gt; Or is it just that the EU is so new, they're trying to put on a good face?

It's simply impossible that Russia could catch a Scandinavian or Baltic country unawares, and then threaten nuclear war if there was a European response.

I'm not saying there will be a total war, or a nuclear war. I'm simply saying there will be no war, not even a limited war like you say, against a well-equipped, stronger opponent like Europe.

My cousin never worked a day in her life. She has five children (you get more money with each additional kid). She lives off of government funds. So what does her life look like? She has a two story home (government provided), a car, two tvs, a refrigerator stocked with food provided by the government, and her kids are decently clothed, all thanks to the government provided safety net (in no way is she well off, but her basic needs are taken care of.

No, this is absolutely incorrect.

The median income (so the income of a middle-class family) has increased by 20% since 1980 in the UK. It's increased by 16% in Ireland, and 14% in the Netherlands. Guess how much incomes for American middle class families have increased since 1980? **0.3%**.

Take a look at [this site](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/the-american-middle-class-is-no-longer-the-worlds-richest.html?ref=business&amp;_r=0)

It's a long article, but just by looking at the graphs you can learn a lot. The rich in America have gotten extremely wealthy, while basically everyone else (middle and lower classes) have either *lost* income, or have remained flat. In Europe, you see income increases across the board, not only for the richest people.

Second, it's better to break down the EU into its constituent countries, in order to get a better picture. The EU as a whole has 0.2% growth, but countries like Greece and Portugal drag the rest down. Here's a graph that breaks it down country by country:

 The United States has [very little of it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_in_the_United_States#Public_financing_of_campaigns) Some recent court rulings in the US have also lifted some of the restrictions on private donations. This means that coorporations can have a lot of influence on what candidates get media exposure, advertisements etc. 

The european parliament, and most european countries (excluding France and the UK) have proportional or semi-proportional elections, while the US have districts that elect one member each (aka majoritarian or first-past-the-post). The [spoiler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_effect) is prevalent with First-past-the-post elections, discouraging voting for candidates that are outside of the establishment. With proportional elections, there is much more of a threat from greens, leftwingers, nationalists, etc. if the mainstream parties/candidates do unpopular things.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"He's an American troll, but he does often bring up good points. The fact is, using OECD quality of life measures, the poor in the US are worse off than those in Sweden or Australia, but are in fact better than those in France, Germany, and Britain. [Source](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2013/05/blogs/graphic-detail/20130601_gdc707.png). People often falsely assume that because there is high income inequality in the US that means the poor are poorer. In actuality, the rich tend to be richer.

OECD median equvalized household income takes the median income to cancel out extremes. It also adjusts for household size and in kind government benefits, like education and health benefits. It is the closest measurement of middle class purchasing power given it corrects for services people get from the government in some countries but not others. And [it shows the US middle class](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/soc_glance-2014-en/images/graphics/g3-01.gif) is not in the dire situation those on this sub tend to think. 

Many of the US' billionaires are entrepreneurs, so I am not sure limiting the top 10% is the best way to bring about equality. A very large share of US billionaires are entrepreneurs which add more than they take away via creating jobs. 

In fact, 25% of tech companies in the US are founded by immigrants, 40% if you look at the state of California or Silicon Valley. Given these guys immigrated, it is fair to say they had the opportunity to shop for the country they thought was the best fit. I will be the last to say the US safety net is adequate for everyone, but the US is in a fairly unique situation. It is a very attractive place to start a company, and therefore, inequality seems to be inherent in the system. Considering so many US billionaires are entrepreneurs, I would say inequality is not the worst indicator of the US economy. (Kauffman Foundation stats).

People should be looking at how the poor fare in the US, and actual mobility, not based on quintiles or other income blocks. For instance an increase of $20,000 in salary might bring you up one quintile in the US, but 3 in Australia, despite a similar change in standard of living. This gives the false impression its harder to increase a person's standard of living. Its harder to move up steps on the ladder, but only because the steps are wider in the US, not necessarily because its harder to increase the person's height off the ground. Many immigrants are low income when they move to the US, yet start businesses and prosper. This goes counter to the argument that it is impossible to increase the quality of life there. 

**TL;DR: There are many problems in the US that need to be fixed, but people often focus on inequality over actual quality of life. Quality of life is not as bad as many on this sub make it out to be, and in fact, many poor in the US have a better quality of life than the poor in Europe, which is contrary to popular belief.**",0,1398358224,null,0,false,0,ch0xkk5,t3_23uyd4,t1_ch0xkk5,t1_ch0vz3t,null,1433501879,11,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,11

1. It opens up the way for the EU to break up. Which, understandably, Europhiles and Eurocrats do not wish to happen.

2. What the UK wants all the benefits of membership with none of the downsides. Understandable from their point of view. However, when you have 27 other memberstates to consider, that's just patently ridiculous from everyone else's viewpoint.    
You cannot have the benefits(Free trade etc.) without the downsides(Quality Assurance and regulations etc.), which is the kind of thing UKIP is advocating for.

Now, from your side;

1. Your export market would be seriously harmed. We would tariff your goods and it wouldn't hurt us all that much, because anything you produce is produced elsewhere in the EU, and for context about 2/3 of your exports go to EU member states.

2. Our export market would be generally unaffected. You're not going to place high tariffs on our goods when half of it comes from us. 

So, while we would still undoubtedly benefit from keeping you in on trade agreements, it wouldn't be dramatic, I think. But let's say we want that, is it really worth losing political face over? And don't tell me that doesn't matter, how other countries perceive you highly affects what they think of your stance on many issues. 

Letting the UK leave and then playing nice makes us look like a benevolent push over. Everyone likes a benevolent push over, but not for the right reasons.

If the UK has a referendum and votes to leave, then I support them in their decision, as it is their right. But I wont pretend for a second that it's either a good thing or an intelligent thing to do. All it does is make the EU weaker and make the UK weaker, and at the end of the day nobody gains anything, including the UK politicians who use the EU asa scapegoat for everything gone wrong, which is primarily how euroskepticism gains traction in the first place.",0,1398358768,null,0,false,0,ch0xum2,t3_23um2e,t1_ch0xum2,t1_ch0up5x,null,1433502020,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,fluicpana,troll,,"Dalla pagina Facebook di quell'idiota di Giulio Golia, 8 ore fa:

*E’ poco più di un anno che seguo per le Iene la storia di alcune famiglie che hanno usato il metodo Stamina. Sono stato nelle loro case e ho conosciuto i loro bambini affetti da malattie che non lasciano alcuna speranza e non hanno nessun’altra cura possibile. Oggi, in concomitanza con l’indagine ufficialmente aperta su Davide Vannoni, qualcuno di voi mi ha scritto insultandomi con frasi come “ ti devi vergognare”. Di cosa? Di cosa mi dovrei vergognare? Lo Stato italiano ha permesso dal 2010 che il metodo Vannoni fosse adottato come cura compassionevole presso un’ospedale pubblico, quello di Brescia. Sessantaquattro famiglie hanno sperimentato queste infusioni grazie alle sentenze di circa 700 giudici (anche questi dello stato italiano) che hanno imposto che queste infusioni fossero loro somministrate molto prima che le iene se ne occupassero. L’Aifa ovviamente non poteva non sapere, così come il Ministero della Salute.
E io, noi delle iene, dovremmo vergognarci per aver raccontato queste famiglie di cui nessuno si è curato davvero? E che peraltro hanno un loro parere su queste cure, che nessuno ancora (ne comitati scientifici, ne politici, ne altri) ha avuto la voglia e l’onestà d’andare a sentire. Noi che questa voglia ed onestà l’abbiamo avuta e ne abbiamo reso conto col nostro programma, non sappiamo dirvi se questo metodo serva o meno a qualcosa. Ma sappiamo che sarebbe stato semplicissimo capirlo, volendolo capire…. Bastava permettere che l’Università di Miami analizzasse a gennaio 2014 queste staminali. In pochi giorni e con pochi denari si sarebbe saputo di che razza di staminali stavamo parlando. Ma l’Aifa, senza ben motivare per quale ragione, ha fermato tutto. Come è stato fermato, dagli scienziati italiani prima e dal ministro Lorenzin poi, il presidente del comitato scientifico prof. Mauro Ferrari che sempre nei primi mesi di quest’anno avrebbe dovuto capire se la sperimentazione meritava o meno. Gli è bastato affermare in un’intervista (concessa alle iene) che avrebbe parlato prima di tutto con le famiglie che hanno sperimentato sulla loro pelle il tanto discusso metodo (quelle famiglie di cui ancora oggi nessuno si è curato). E questo, solo questo, l’ha fatto diventare un principiante liquidabile da un giorno all’altro.
La giustizia farà il suo corso e Vannoni risponderà per ciò che ha fatto negli anni dal 2007 al 2010. Siamo i primi che hanno parlato dei suoi guai giudiziari. Guai giudiziari tutti risalenti a quel periodo, che con grande chiarezza abbiamo raccontato per primi nel corso del 2013 coi nostri servizi che potete trovare facilmente su www.iene.it. Andateli a vedere. E se dopo averli visti penserete ancora che ci dobbiamo vergognare, allora qualcosa non va…*

It's not, as far as I'm aware. What I'm saying is that the UK voting to exit the Union would be a failure to uphold the obligations it signed up to do. It's analogous to when you wrote:

&gt; ""you won't do what we want, so we'll break our treaty with you""

I'm saying that by voting to leave, Britain would be sending that exact message to the EU. I can't for the life of me find the article I just read a few hours ago about the UK being in breach of the ECHR (and thus the Council of Europe) over the prisoners' votes thing, but it went on to say that the EU is planning to adopt that into European law, which *would* make the UK in breach of EU law. But it hasn't happened yet and they'll cross that bridge when they come to it. [This analysis](http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2011/04/13/prisoner-votes-eu-law-wont-help/) alludes to it, when it mentions the court judgment:

&gt; ""Although he dismissed the petition Lord Tyre did express his views with regard to the proposed EU law incompatibility of disenfranchisement of convicted prisoners.""

&gt; The UK is not holding up eurozone integration.

Holding up was perhaps a poor choice of words on my part. I should have said that it's not a signatory to rules to strengthen the Eurozone and EU economy as a whole. The [European Fiscal Compact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Fiscal_Compact#Negotiations) is an example. [Here's a news article as well](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/09/david-cameron-blocks-eu-treaty).

&gt; Also, it is right that the UK gets a rebate. Even with rebate, the UK's net contribution is roughly the same as France's. The UK has a similar sized economy to France, so the UK's net contribution should be the same as France's.

I agree in part, but it creates problems that are [pretty well laid out here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_rebate#Pressure_for_change)

The size of the workforce. More people entered the workforce than found jobs, so unemployment went up marginally.

In the EU the opposite is the case; the participation rate in the EU has drastically increased, in particular amongst women, over the past two decades.

Again, no one is arguing that. We're not talking about income inequality - we're talking, specifically, about the rates of extreme poverty in the United States vs. parts of Europe, or in the United States vs. parts of Africa. They're non-existent in the United States; almost no one lives that poorly, and the ones that do only do because they're in rural poverty. Stop pretending like Riga is some utopia where no one starves or has to commit crime, and Detroit and New York City are slums that more closely resemble flavelas than modern developed cities. It's a joke. 

No one disagrees with ""wealth inequality is bad,"" and no one disagrees that the United States has some admirably bad income inequality; it's a compeltely unnecessary tangent. 

&gt; Free or extremely cheap college, triple US minimum wage, universal healthcare - add up the cost and tell me if a low income earner in New York would have a higher standard of living.

First of all, compared to whom? A European counter-part? an African one?That is, again, unrelated to poverty, and you're just cherry picking arguments and omitting literally every bad thing about Europe: European tax rates are exponentially higher than that of in the United States, basically eliminating disposable income. Not to mention Americans make more money than Europeans on average. American businesses are in better financial positions than that of their European counterparts, and in almost every country in Europe, the unemployment rates are DOUBLE that of the United states, and hover around 50% for people age 18 - 25 - what good does triple the minimum wage do if 50% of the people who fill those jobs CAN'T get jobs? Oh and guess what, because of that, gas and consumer products are cheaper in the United States than in Europe, including food.

Allerdings kann man die Wikipedia durchaus wie den Brockhaus verwenden - beispielsweise wird einem keiner einen Strick daraus drehen, wenn man mal eine Jahreszahl oder so nachschlägt, oder alles, was als Allgemeinwissen akzeptiert wird. Dann ist auch kein Zitat nötig. Man kann eine (Online-)Enzyklopädie auch zitieren (als Primärquelle), z.B. um durch eine allgemeine Definition zu zeigen, wie ein gewisser Begriff allgemein verstanden wird (auch wenn das stilistisch oft unschön ist). Für die Rezeptionsgeschichte ist das schon oft relevant.

Technische Daten gehören aber m.E. fast ausnahmslos aus der Fachliteratur zitiert (wenn es nicht gerade darum geht wie hoch der Eiffelturm ist), weil es sich meistens um Spezialwissen handelt, das von einer Enzyklopädie nicht verlässlich zur Verfügung gestellt werden kann.

Das Unredliche daran ist also erstens das wörtliche Zitieren aus einer Enzyklopädie ohne Quellenangabe (wenn der Vorwurf denn so stimmt, müsste ich nachsehen) und zweitens die Verwendung einer Enzyklopädie als Sekundärliteratur, wo eigentlich Fachliteratur nötig wäre.

Ich würde also nicht sagen, dass die dauerhafte Nachprüfbarkeit da ein großes Problem ist.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt; To give an example, Scotland's number of unemployed went up recently. The number of people in jobs also went up.

This also happens in the US when there is a big surge in employment numbers. As more people get jobs, those who have given up begin looking for jobs thus increasing the unemployment numbers since the U3 metric looks at people actively looking for jobs.

&gt;The labour market participation rate in the US has declined, as people decide against even looking for a job. In the EU the opposite is the case; the participation rate in the EU has drastically increased, in particular amongst women, over the past two decades. If the US's participation rate had remained constant, the unemployment rates wouldn't be so different.

So this is true to an extant, but as usual it's a little more complicated. The US labor force has indeed shrunk due to people giving up looking for jobs. But is has also shrunk due to vast numbers of retirees leaving the workforce for the first time.

As to your points about Europe. You mention the participation rate amongst women increasing. Have women historically had the same levels of participation as their US counterparts (I think its about 70% of women work here, not exactly sure), or is this a trend that is happening more recently (god this will be complicated since I am guessing it varies significantly country to country).

Also, just as America had the baby boomer generation, I am guessing Europe did too, so they should also be seeing similar levels of labor force participation drop off if they are retiring in similar numbers. If that is true, and levels of participation rates are increasing in Europe, it seems to defy the US trend of decreasing levels of participation rates due to retirees leaving the work force.

Where are you getting this breakdown? How do you know it does not take into account education?

This is the methodology for the Economist:

&gt;SIZING up countries by GDP has long been criticised for placing too much emphasis on things that are measured monetarily. Over the past three years, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has released an alternative called the ""Better-Life Index"". It tracks around 24 indicators in 11 categories. Some are easily quantifiable, like jobs (which includes unemployment and income), while others are more woolly, like civic engagement and community. Ever diplomatic, the OECD does not provide a score for countries, though you can see their rankings here. The Economist has crunched the numbers for 10 indicators for which the OECD provide data to place countries in a range of how the best off and least well-off in society fare, measured as the top and bottom 10% of the population by income and education. It conforms to stereotype. The better-off Americans enjoy the best lives, but the country has the widest inequality. In fact, for all the fancy metrics, the Better-Life Index does not look too different from classic GDP rankings.

true,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"Yes, of course that trend exists in the US. I was talking about a more general trend extending back significantly before the crisis to the 90's, or even earlier. Labour force participation rates in the EU have been higher than the US's since the mid noughties and the gap has only been increasing, with increases in the EU and decreases in the US. 

The biggest driver of this has been women entering the workforce, and this is largely being driven by Southern European countries, even now. I can only surmise this is due to how women's places have been seen on those countries changing over the years but I wouldn't swear to it. At the moment, female participation rates are a full 10 percentage points behind the US's. As they enter the workforce, and they continue to do so, they will hold the unemployment rate up even with huge increases in jobs. That's the big driver for the increase in the EU. 

One of the surprising drivers in the US is the decline of 16-24 year old labour participation rates. They've decline precipitously, even though they've remained stagnant in the EU. 

[Here's some data](http://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;met_y=labor_participation_rate#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=labor_participation_rate&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:USA:GBR:ESP:PRT:ITA:GRC&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en_US&amp;ind=false), though it can't tell you the background. 

And [this](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304703804579381112025475836) article is pretty good. The TL;DR is that unemployment in the EU will stay relatively high as more people are coming on to the job markets. The US's position is flattered by a declining participation rate. If the EU's rate had mirrored the US's over the recession, unemployment in the EU would already be below where it was at the start of the recession, 9.5%. Women entering the workforce, 50% of the total population, is dwarfing the retirement flows. As those rates equalize, and the baby boomers begin to retire in greater numbers, the participation rate will probably begin to mirror the US's.

Surement mal.

&gt;ses thèses économiques

Lesquelles ?

&gt;ne peuvent attirer que ceux qui n'ont pas compris

C'est sûr, toi tu as compris mieux que les 8 prix Nobel d'économie qui montrent que l'euro ne peut fonctionner et que l'austérité ne peut apporter que la récession.

&gt;ce n'est pas simple de lutter contre la mondialisation

Personne n'a dit que c'était simple. Le FN dit juste que c'est possible avec la dissolution de l'euro et le retour à un protectionnisme au niveau national.

&gt;ce n'est pas en revenant en arrière socialement qu'on règlera les problèmes.

Augmenter les bas salaires de 200 euros c'est un recul social ?

Réduire le chômage en éclatant l'euro et en dévaluant c'est un recul social ?

Reprendre un contrôle démocratique sur la monnaie ?

Lutter contre la concurrence fiscale déloyale et le nivellement par le bas de nos soi-disant partenaires européens ?

Que dire alors de la politique d'austérité qui va amener récession, baisse des prestations sociales, et augmentation du chômage ?

Quand on sait que tout cela est fait pour faire plaisir aux marchés et à la BCE, oui c'est sûr, les gouvernements sont dépassés car ils sont soumis à la finance et aux 0.01% d'ultra-riches dont ils espèrent récupérer les miettes.

&gt;Les volets de politique internationale sont complètement à côté

Pas d'intervention en Lybie ?

Asile à Snowden ?

- En aucun cas la France n'interviendra seule au Mali
- loi sur l'organisation des entreprises privées contre les rémunérations abusives des patrons et pour la représentation salariale
- Indexer le SMIC non seulement sur les prix, mais, aussi sur une part de la croissance
-  aucune nouvelle taxe dans le budget de la sécurité sociale 2014
- Supprimer les stock-options et encadrer les bonus

etc etc 

tu as bien décrit le programme de Hollande, pas celui du FN

&gt;Chaque gouvernement s'est préoccupé d'essayer de sauver ce qui reste d'industrie 

Mais non. Ils ont signé pour une zone de libre échange. Ils ont donc détruit l'industrie. Pas sauvé.

&gt;mais ça sert à rien et il faudrait arrêter de mentir aux gens.

C'est tout à fait possible en sortant de l'euro et en dévaluant.

&gt;Quand aux programmes municipaux du type ""plein de bagnoles partout et baissons les impôts"" j'attends de voir ce que ça donne

Le programme municipal du ""des HLM pour les immigrés en centre ville"", on a bien vu ce que ça a donné à Béziers, à Fréjus et à Mantes la Ville. Le programme municipal du ""l'argent de la mairie c'est le mien, mais les emprunts toxiques ce sera aux suivants de rembourser"", on a bien vu ce que ça donné à Hénin-Beaumont.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt;Household income provides an indication of the goods and services families can purchase on the market. It is thus an absolute objective indication of material quality of life.

&gt;Data on annual median equivalised household disposable income come from the OECD Income Distribution Database. Disposable income is market income (income from work and capital) after deduction of direct taxes and payment of social security contributions. It excludes in-kind services provided to households by governments and private entities, consumption taxes, and imputed income flows due to home ownership. People were attributed the income of their household. After subtracting taxes and adding welfare benefits, household income provides an indication of the goods and services families can purchase on the market.

&gt;Household income is adjusted for family size and the adjusted measure is attributed to every person in that household. Half of all people have higher income than the median and the other half lower.

&gt;For cross-country comparison, national currency measures of income were converted into US dollars (USD) using purchasing power parity (PPP) for private consumption exchange rates. These PPPs reflect the amount of a national currency required in each country to buy the same basket of goods and services as a dollar does in the United States. Both income and PPP estimates are affected by statistical errors, so differences between countries of 5% or less are not considered significant.

The flip side is that person is guaranteed to be in the Olympics, and only has to win one event to have a medals per capita of 1. From then on, even if another country won every other medal for every Olympic games for the past century into the future, that country with a population of one would still have a larger per-capita medal ratio for winning that one event. This also disregards the fact that even if all athletes from the second country are exactly equal, they can still only win one medal per Olympic game.

Es gibt extremistische Bewegungen in der Ukraine so wie auch in Deutschland.

There are two different things one can ""be fine"" or take issue with. One is the economic conditions and lack of safety net which leads to people being forced to live on the street.

true,UncleSneakyFingers,UNSA,The United States of America,"&gt; Which side of this are you objecting to?

Both I guess. San Francisco also worsens its poverty levels due to the tech sector boom that has caused housing prices to explode, pushing the vulnerable to the margins. I have no idea how to remedy that situation, but income disparity is a problem San Francisco will have to solve.

As to the visibility issue, there are ways to mitigate that that the city clearly isn't doing. For instance, it can construct homeless shelters and subsidized housing to give those people a place to go. It can also pass legislation making pan handling and loitering illegal.

For instance, when I went to Portland I saw some transients living just off the road in tents. FUCKING TENTS! That would not be acceptable in many other cities. And these weren't despondent, hopeless people on the streets for because they were poor. These were transients pitching up a tent in the city playing music before they picked up and moved on. Other cities would not tolerate people camping in downtown. Portland seemed to embrace it.

I am not sure how well versed you are in American terminology regarding the homeless, but there are some subtle differences.

A bum (don't work, don't move around) is not the same as a hobo (don't work, do move around, sometimes by hopping the trains) and transients/vagrants (do work occasionally either in seasonal farm work or by playing music on the streets, and are always on the move). The latter category implies homelessness is a choice. Some people would rather live on the road I guess. This is the category that frustrates me the most since they are generally capable, but slum around in cities as a lifestyle. This was the typical homeless person on saw in cities like Portland, and to a lesser extant Tucson, Arizona.

In France for instance donations are limited to physical persons (as opposed to corporations) and to 7500€ a year, and campaign budgets are capped (28 million for the last presidential election I think). So politicians are much more independent, whatever many Europeans think of it.

Also, gerrymandering is much less of a problem (there are regulatory bodies). And most countries (all but France ?) have parliamentary democracies which are much more representative and less predictible than the American presidential system and its insane electoral process. Specifically, third parties can an do exist in Europe, even if bipartisanship is still a thing.

The root of the problem, in my opinion : the US constitution was written two centuries ago by people who had no idea what challenges a big democracy would face. Most European constitutions are recent, and written from experience. There are exceptions, like the UK. And the UK has the worst bipartisan system in Europe, I don't think it's a coincidence.

Throats were cut. Pregnant women were bayoneted. Children were cut in two. Men were ambushed in the field and led away. The perpetrators could not determine the province's future. But at least they could determine that it would be a future without Poles.*

*An OUN order from early 1944 stated:*

*Liquidate all Polish traces. Destroy all walls in the Catholic Church and other Polish prayer houses. Destroy orchards and trees in the courtyards so that there will be no trace that someone lived there...

Il n'y a pas beaucoup de **règles** parce qu'on est une toute petite communauté avec peu de posteurs. J'avais crée le sub après avoir découvert reddit et /r/guessthemovie où j'étais frustrée de ne presque jamais rien trouver, que le niveau soit si élevé et que les gens viennent juste pour jouer (et parfois faire des remontrances aux nouveaux qui postent des trucs trop faciles). Là bas c'est normal que ce soit difficile et qu'on arrive souvent trop tard vu le nombre de joueurs mais je voulais un sub plus convivial et accessible. 

Au bout d'un moment on a quand même voulu mettre en place un classement pour la compet, mais mis à part la recommandation de vérifier si le screenshot sort sur [GIS](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/images/searchbyimage.html) il n'y a pas d'autres règles, on ne veut pas décourager les posteurs. (On a récemment convenu que si quelqu'un se rend compte qu'une image est GIS-able, il me le signale par MP et je n'attribue que 1 point au gagnant au lieu de 3. Personnellement je ne vérifie que mes propres posts sur GIS).

Pour les **indices** c'est complètement libre, j'essaie d'en donner des textuels dès qu'il y a une proposition. Parfois c'est difficile d'en trouver qui aiguille juste un peu.  Bien souvent une image est postée et il n'y a aucune proposition donc une seconde, puis troisième.... 15ème image est nécessaire mais on peut tout à fait donner une indication de date, de genre... ou n'importe quoi. Pas de règles.

Concernant les **films beaucoup postés** il n'y en vraiment pas beaucoup. C'est je crois ""Le grand soir"" qui a été le plus soumis mais uniquement 4 fois max je pense. Amélie Poulain aussi mais c'était volontaire (un running gag au début). Sinon il doit y avoir peut être une dizaine de films postés deux fois. Il y a encore PLEIN de films qui ne sont jamais apparus ici, dont des classiques très connus. J'ai posté beaucoup, et beaucoup de films datant d'après 2000, c'est pourquoi là je me suis tout récemment ""rabattue"" sur des plus vieux, j'avais un peu fait le tour. Donc pour les années 90, 80 et avant tu peux y aller.

Maintenant **si vous avez des propositions de règles à ajouter pas de problème, on peut en discuter**. 

J'aimerais aussi savoir s'il y a beaucoup de personnes qui viennent ici sans rien trouver et voudraient des **images plus faciles plus souvent?** C'est ce que je comptais faire au début et puis on a progressivement élevé le niveau, même si je pense que c'est toujours abordable et que j'essaie de poster des trucs faciles régulièrement, des films d'auteurs mais aussi très populaires.

Cet été on avait instauré [GTFM-été]: où on devait poster des images autour d'un thème, l'été donc, et les films étrangers étaient acceptés, pas seulement francophones. On peut remettre ça si vous voulez, j'avais pensé à par exemple [NSFW] qui pourrait être marrant. On choisit un thème quinze jours/1 mois à l'avance pour avoir le temps de préparer des images et on les poste en plus des habituelles pendant une semaine.

edit: et je crois que je viens d'en trouver un sur /r/guessthemovie, ça faisait looooongtemps que ça m'était pas arrivée!!!!!! (ici aussi d'ailleurs :/)

edit 2: Et quand je disais que j'ai posté beaucoup de films des années 2000, c'est même plus des films datant d'après 2010 il me semble.

Un enfant se présente avec un abcès purulent aux dents qui a atteint sa machoire et on lui dit ""non tu n'en vaux pas la peine"". A partir du moment où quelqu'un entre sur ton territoire il est de ta responsabilité. Ou alors on décide qu'effectivement les droits de l'homme on se torche avec. Et ces histoires de ""on veut juste enlever l'aide *gratuite*"" sont risibles vu qu'un clandestin ou un demandeur d'asile n'a pas le droit de travailler. Encore moins un mineur. Et si les chiffres des morts aux portes de l'Europe et les pric des passeurs ne dissuadent pas ce n'est pas la cruauté des autorités qui va le faire. Il n'arrive qu'un filet de gens ici par rapport à ceux qui veulent partir d'ailleurs en quête de mieux, on ne le réduira pas plus. Il faut faire avec.

Mais heureusement qu'il y a tous ces faibles sur qui taper. Comme ça on a un bouc émissaire.

Qu'on leur explique comme le marché du travail est dur pour le fils du voisin qui est au chômage et ils seront compréhensifs, par contre dans les statistiques du chômage il n'y a que des fainéants. C'est de l'humanité dans le personnel et de la cruauté au sens large. De la myopie. On appelle ça le ""monkey sphere"", la sphère des gens pour qui on arrive à s'inquitéter et éprouver de l'empathie.

Mais le pire c'est que ça n'a même pas le mérite d'avoir de bons résultats ce genre d'approche. Les pays ultra libéraux où règne le chacun pour soi ont une grande quantité de pauvreté et peu de mobilité sociale.

He's very colorful character - he tried to be independent journalist during communism at first, then switched sides to become communist government spokeperson from August 1981 to April 1989 (so including maritial law when communist government shoot to Polish workers peacefully protesting against them - he repeatedly defended that pacification publicly and basically every weekend for 9 years lied in TV). 

For example he criticized Jerzy Popiełuszko (Priest murdered by communist government in 1984 for his critique of communism, and very patriotic public speeches). After Popiełuszko was murdered and found in river, Urban was accusing foreign provocators and Solidarity for that. It was of course all fault of foreign influences, spies, etc, etc. Listening to Putin and Russian media now is quite weird - it feels like time machine. Example of Urban as spokeperson of communists (sorry, couldn't find it in English): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ6HeB5qb0I Only after 1989 it turned out police killed that priest on government order.



Urban newspaper (while independent of all big media camps in Poland) publishes everything that's critical of current government, and especially church (hence name meaning ""No""), but also EU, NATO, USA, I've only read them maybe 10 times in my life, and the only sacred subject seems to be SLD (Polish post-communist party) and PRL (Poland during communism).

The way it's done in ""Nie"" is - outrageous claims on the first page (and in internet version), ""buy paper version for more details"", and nothing that really supports the claims inside.

I'd like to see the whole article (the linked one is just the claims), but I won't fall for that another time.

&gt;Was mich, viele Linke, den Großteil der Bevoelkerung und eben auch viele redditor ankotzt ist die vollkommen einseitige Berichterstattung, die auch von deutschen Medien auf CNN-Niveau (Kartenfaelschen inklusive) gefuehrt wird. Weil 's is ja cool, Rußland als Feindbild zu haben, da fuehlen sich die alten Herren in Bundestag und Tagesschaustudio wieder wohl, und außerdem ist das ne total praktische Ablenkung von dem was die USA im letzten Dreivierteljahr so verbrochen haben.

Dazu sei noch gesagt daß ich der Ukraine natuerlich eine demokratische Regierung wuensche, und es mir auch ganz lieb waere wenn das Land in die EU kommen koennte. Aber demgegenueber steht halt Realpolitik; Putin wird die Krim (zu recht, auch voelkerrechtlich) nicht aufgeben, ebensowenig hat er Bock noch mehr von seiner Einflußsphaere zu verlieren.  
(Ich find da ja immer die Leute drollig die Putin als Zaren bezeichnen, mit den ganzen unterschwelligen Imperialismusvorwuerfen die das so impliziert. Stell dich mal auf die russische Seite des Zauns. Wer hat denn nach 91 angefangen sich systematisch das Baltikum und die osteuropaeischen Laender einzuverleiben? Klingt jetzt etwas kraß, hm? Aber vielleicht sollte man sich mal vor Augen fuehren wie die Russen, und eben auch Putin, die EU so sehen. Was hoer ich da, machtpolitisches Spiel? Ja no fucking shit, aber welche Optionen hat er denn um die Interessen seines Landes durchzusetzen?)  
Und demgegenueber steht eben auch noch die beiden Tatsachen daß  
a) sich der Westen gerade nicht besser verhaelt; wer bei Rußlands Verhalten 'OMQ MACHTPOLITIK!!11elf' schreit sollte mal nachschauen, was die Amis derzeit (und dauerhaft) so im Mittelmeer und Schwarzen Meer rumplantschen haben und ob das noch normal ist; und  
b) daß die Ukraine vielleicht derzeit selbst nicht so ganz weiß, was sie eigentlich will. Die Tatsache, daß ein großer Teil der derzeitigen Regierung entweder offen rechtsradikal ist oder zumindest mit solchen in einem Boot sitzt macht's halt auch nicht unbedingt PR-tauglich. Aktuell sieht das naemlich eher aus wie ein Buergerkrieg kurz vorm Ausbruch (in dem's kaum eine 'richtige' Seite gibt) und weniger wie ein tapferer Freiheitskampf gegen die boesen russischen Imperialisten.

&gt;

&gt;The __Ponte Vecchio__ (""Old Bridge"", Italian pronunciation: [ˈponte ˈvɛkkjo])   is a [Medieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages) stone closed-[spandrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel) [segmental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_segment) [arch bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_bridge) over the [Arno River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_River), in [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence,_Italy), Italy, noted for still having shops built along it, as was once common. Butchers initially occupied the shops; the present tenants are jewelers, art dealers and souvenir sellers. The Ponte Vecchio's two neighbouring bridges are the [Ponte Santa Trinita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponte_Santa_Trinita) and the [Ponte alle Grazie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponte_alle_Grazie).

A loro due si unirono una lesbica incazzata, un piromane gay, un ragazzo di colore col cervello mandato in mona dalle droghe pesanti che si faceva chiamare Chicken Little, un tizio con dei baffoni meravigliosi ed altra gente di poco conto. Finimmo in un boschetto ai margini di uno stradone di periferia, dove c'erano tracce di vecchi accampamenti di barboni e anche una pista semidistrutta per le BMX. Io, la lesbica e il gay non fumavamo, quindi ci appartammo in uno spiazzo erboso. Il ragazzo costruì un falò e parlammo un po' delle nostre vite- lui era incredibilmente pessimista ma abbastanza intelligente, organizzava rave party e aveva il braccio pieno di braccialetti colorati. Lì per lì fu squallido, ma se ci ripenso è stato uno dei pomeriggi più particolari della mia vita.

Making the EP a true legislative branch is IMO the most important reform the EU needs to make. The EU does not have true democratic legitimacy until the EP has democratic legitimacy and hopefully the ability to appoint commissioners based on election results.

• These harmonisation moves frequently threaten to water down existing UK legislation which is already more than fit for purpose, as in this case. They get ‘averaged down’ to a European standard, making our laws less effective.

• The Conservatives, Lib-Dems and Labour habitually vote for harmonisation moves which give more powers to the EU, water down UK law and throw more taxpayers’ money at issues, to make themselves look good. It is UKIP that is taking its responsibilities seriously here, while the others just put their hands up when told to.

true,toresbe,NORW,Norway,"&gt; Few countries can boast about the luxuries Norway has. A small, relatively homogeneous country supplemented by vast oil wealth isn't the best comparison to use in terms of pay.

The importance of oil to the strength of the Norwegian economy is overstated. We hadn't paid off the debts we incurred to exploit the resources until 1983 - we were hardly a developing country before that. Besides, an oil-fuelled economy can be tremendously difficult to control, or prepare for the inevitable end of oil reserves.

Our economic strengths primarily come from social democracy and strong national unions which give established democratic negotiation structures between capital and labour, with the state as mediators; the ""three-party cooperation"". 

The really telling word there is ""cooperation""; laws have stringent definitions of what constitutes a legal strike - it allows the unions to retain their chief leverage, while ensuring capitalists could trust that their investments wouldn't suddenly stop giving dividends because of a wildcat strike.

Krone for krone, our greater participation of women in the workplace generates more wealth than our oil.

These are the results of strong governmental participation in helping people lead a fulfilling life - great investment in high-quality public education, and paid maternal leave and subsidized kindergarten which helps families by enabling both members of the family to have full-time jobs.

I am sure that has a lot to do with it. Depression tends to run in families. But I think there are also outside factors as well. Denmark has been called the happiest country in the world, and this is despite the high taxes, etc. 

That said, not everyone ""fits"". I have talked to Danes that dont like how hard it is to start a business there. I have talked to French and German people living in the US that often talked about the difficulties at running/starting a business there (which they eventually planned on doing in the US). 

I actually have quite a few friends who immigrated to the US and started businesses (mostly from Eastern Europe). Most are doing very well for themselves. I own 1/3 of a business with my brother and dad, we only have two small buildings in a rural community, but I am confident we will get more. We were low income growing up, and I watched my dad struggle. Now he has his own business and him and my mom are much better off than they ever were. One of my family members started a business about 1 year ago. She put her entire life savings into starting it (including retirement) and was really worried about not getting capital. Yesterday she secured her first round of venture capital of $2MM, so proud of her. 

I only bring these examples up, because I think this is where Western Europe could make serious changes. From the Europeans I've talked to starting a business seems to be much more difficult. And in my opinion, business creation is one of the better contributions a person can make to society.

Korea lief etwa so: nach dem 2. Weltkrieg haben die Siegermaechte das (damals japanisch besetzte) Korea unilateral in Nord und Sued geteilt, irgendwann hat das dann zu 'Veraergerungen' gefuehrt und Kim Il-Sung wollte dann halt das Land unter einer kommunistischen Flagge wiedervereinigen. Gut dass das nicht so passiert ist? Klar. Voelkerrechtlich vielleicht etwas dubios da nen Proxykrieg draus zu machen? Jo, auch. Und was waer denn passiert, wenn die UN da gewonnen haette? Richtig, Korea waere wiedervereinigt worden, und zwar unter dem System _Sued_koreas. Waere das ein besserer Ausgang gewesen? Fuer die Menschen im Land sicherlich, aber es illustriert eben daß sich die beiden Systeme im kalten Krieg mit exakt den gleichen Methoden an die Gurgel gegangen sind. Die einzigen Unterschiede waren in den Flaggen, den Hymnen und der politischen Ideologie.

Vietnam lief dann etwa so: nach Jahrzehnten an Clusterfuck hatten die Franzosen keinen Bock mehr und sind da unten raus. Nachdem Diem dann ein halbes Jahrzehnt lang McCarthy-aehnliche Parolen geschwungen hatte hatte der Norden keinen Bock mehr auf den Kram und hat halt angefangen, zurueckzufeuern. Diem wurde dann von einem seiner Generaele ermordet (da hatte die CIA im Uebrigen auch ihre Finger im Spiel), und nachdem der hochgradig lobotomierte Johnson an die Macht kam haben die USA dann auch Recht bald angefangen, von Flugzeugtraegern und B-52ern aus Freiheit und Demokratie zu verteilen, wie sie es eben am besten koennen. Mit dem Unterschied zu Korea eben, daß diesmal die Kommis gewonnen haben. Waer das Land wirklich souveraen geworden wenn die Amis gewonnen haetten? Wage ich zu bezweifeln. Augenscheinlich ja, aber in der Praxis wohl kaum.

Kuba war halt die Tuerkei der Soviets. Die Amis hatten ihre Silos am Schwarzen Meer, die Soviets mußten sich halt eben irgendwas im Atlantik suchen. Die Amis hatten natuerlich keinen Bock in Reichweite russischer Raketen zu sein, also haben sie eben mal nen  Staatsstreich organisiert. Als der dann ins Wasser fiel ging's halt etwas weniger 'subtil' mit dem Embargo los.

tl,dr Soviets und Amis haben im kalten Krieg groeßtenteils die gleichen Methoden verwandt, wobei erstere ihre Satellitenstaaten halt explizit so nannten. Die Amis operieren halt heutzutage immer noch in dem Modus, einfach weil sie's koennen. Aber wehe der boese Russe schickt mal seine Tu-95er ueber n Land im Mittleren Osten um da Demokratie zu spendieren! Alter!! Das geht garnicht!!! Das gibt ATOMKRIEG!!!!11

Read through *German* wikipedia articles, read *German* newspapers, and tell your family and friends back home what silly phrases and words you've learned. Like ""Zwölf Bier sind auch ein Schnitzel!""

Now you're saying harmonisation not a necessary consequence of free trade, it's a just contingent property of a particular well-established free trade zone.

The status quo is not the only possible arrangement.

You say there's a ""point"" to regulatory harmonisation. I find teleological arguments like this as misleading in the social sciences as they are in biology. I may or may not agree with you as to what you claim is the ""point"" of regulatory harmonisation, but I'm not sure it's relevant. What matters are all the consequences of regulatory harmonisation, not just the ones which happen to coincide with the claimed ""point"" of it all. The side effect of this harmonisation has been massive corporate rent-seeking, on an unbelievable scale, and the establishment of a regulatory cost floor that makes some European goods uncompetitive on the world market. If they outweight the parochial intra-EU gains from trade, then regulatory harmonisation was a bad idea in the first place.

You don't provide any account of what ""unfairly undermined"" means, nor any reason for me to agree with your opinion of it. You don't say what the distributional effects of harmonisation are: what if increases wealth *and* increases inequality? Should we just ignore the inconvenient consequences?

What if it's better for social justice for each country to determine its own regulations democratically, and just have a rule of zero tariffs and non-discrimination by national origin for products from the EU?

The status quo which seems to form almost the entire basis of your argument is not something we arrived at by appropriate democratic procedures, except, arguably, in the Republic of Ireland. In other countries such as the UK, we were repeatedly promised referendums on the adoption of particular treaties, and then these were ratified in defiance of those undertakings. The status quo simply is something we either voted against, or were denied a vote on completely.

It is not ""having your cake and eating it"" to want zero tarriffs and non-discrimination, without regulatory harmonisation. It's just wanting a customs union.

My main general critique (not aimed exactly at you, but the general sentiment with EU reform) is the argument of democracy; too often described within certain media outlets as a *democratic deficit*. Unfortunately this is nothing more than populist sentiment as, with further inspection, one will have to come to terms with what further democratic powers given to an institution actually means. Certain Eurosceptics often argue for elected executive officials, while not willing to accept that such elections will give executive powers that they will find unacceptable anyway.  

*IF* a population of half a billion comes to agreement on any common choice. This is why, while I find the EP as a functional body upon which one can further develop representative democracy at a supra-national level, it simply wouldn't work in the case of electing singular officials. Because then come the problems associated with the US Presidential system, where people don't vote for the best candidate they most agree with, they merely vote for the candidate that is most likely to win that is the least worst. And that is a bad idea when you want to promote diversity and pluralism in politics. 

The possibilities and alternatives are limitless, but in general one has to keep tabs with the true nature of democracy: Democracy as a means towards a fairer, pluralistic and better society, not Democracy as an end in itself. There are moments where democracy is beneficial, and there are moments where other means work better. 

But, above all, one has to also recognise the fact that democratic means are best developed from the bottom-up, and not top-down. If we want functional and effective democratic institutions at a European level, one must ensure that democratic institutions are effective at both national and local levels. And, despite the fact that many countries in Europe are ahead of the rest of the world in terms of this, there is still much left to be desired, be it in terms of corruption, party-finance, the quality of debate and so on. 

The European Union was born out of the image of a post-war Europe. But, from now on, the change that will take hold upon the European Union in the 21st Century will be that of the image of a 21st Century Europe.

(Alla Milani il mio gesto spregiudicato non sfiorò nemmeno la parte più esterna del vetrino dell'occhio, d'altro canto un'altra ragazza rimase molto colpita e mi approcciò, ma ai tempi lei era bruttina e io privo della possibilità di prevedere il futuro, ora OVVIAMENTE è una figa spaventosa)

BUT there was also a large amount of co-conspiring from the other side, the article I've linked below focuses on Wall Street's involvement, but other EU nations were big players as well, the pressure to get the Euro launched on time with enough nations involved to make it a viable pan-European currency meant that many were willing to overlook Greece's blatantly false financial reports - with the assumption that the Euro would stimulate enough growth in the Greek economy that it wouldn't matter - clearly this was a miscalculation. 

There's only a certain amount of blame that can be laid at Greece's feet for this as they were to a large extent aided and encouraged by others.

 [**Kriek lambic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriek%20lambic): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Kriek lambic__ is a style of [Belgian beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_beer), made by fermenting [lambic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambic) with [sour Morello cherries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_cherry).  The name is derived from the [Flemish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flemish_language) word for this type of cherry (kriek). Traditionally ""[Schaarbeekse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schaerbeek) krieken"" (a rare Belgian [Morello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morello_Cherry) variety) from the area around [Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels) are used. As the Schaarbeek type cherries have become more difficult to find, some brewers have replaced these (partly or completely) with other varieties of sour cherries, sometimes imported.

&gt;Traditionally, kriek is made by breweries in and around Brussels using lambic beer to which sour cherries (with the pits) are added.  A lambic is a sour and dry Belgian beer, fermented spontaneously with airborne yeast said to be native to Brussels; the presence of cherries (or raspberries) predates the almost universal use of [hops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hops) as a flavoring in beer.  A traditional kriek made from a lambic base beer is sour and dry as well. The cherries are left in for a period of several months, causing a refermentation of the additional sugar. Typically no sugar will be left so there will be a fruit flavour without sweetness. There will be a further maturation process after the cherries are removed.

&gt;More recently, some lambic brewers have added sugar to the final product of their fruit beers, in order to make them less intense and more approachable to a wider audience. They also use cherry juice rather than whole cherries and are matured for much shorter periods.

I take your point about integration. However I disagree. You cannot urge a more 'democratic' representation for the people of the EU in the way that you do, without recognising that this is in and of itself would mean a huge leap toward integration and a single state EU, surely.

The parliament is a body that is population based, in it's representation. And urging more power for them inevitably means urging more power for Germany, Poland, France, UK etc. because they have the big populations. That also inevitably means giving those countries the potential ability to gain complete control over the running of the EU as a whole.

I do not believe, and all of the evidence supports this, that the people of the EU have any interest in moving to this kind of system. 

I love the EU and support it with gusto. But I do not want countries like Denmark, Ireland, Belgium etc. reduced to bit players. The EU gains enormously from the current system for a whole plethora of reasons and I believe it is a completely misleading use of the term 'democratic' to use it in the way that your comment (and not just you, but others who hold views similar to yours) uses it. By doing so it infers directly that there is something 'less' democratic about the current system. And there isn't.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"The Turkey story:

I went to Eastern Turkey and Northern Iraq last winter. It was in a part of Turkey where the US embassy says they will not send employees if citizens get in trouble. I was supposed to be taking a shared taxi all the way back to Diyarbakir from Zahko, Iraq (I know this is what I paid for because a Kurdish friend ordered it for me in their native language). The taxi dropped me off at a bus depot on the [Syrian border](https://www.google.com/maps/preview/place/Cizre,+Turkey/@37.3074216,42.1557547,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x40096401b82f5eaf:0xb0bde53725aeb8d8) and played the ""no English"" game when I tried to explain I paid for a taxi for the entire trip back. 

The taxi driver paid for my bus ticket and left. Bus depot might be too strong of a word. It was pretty dead. I was the only person there. A couple young teens walked in and brazenly tried to take my wallet out of my pocket while saying ""money, money."" I said no, and pushed my wallet back into my pocket. 

They left, and came back with several more teens. The biggest one pulled out a knife and said ""money"". He was holding the knife far out in front of him so his wrist would have been easy to grab. There was also a sharp rock propping the door open. It would have been a perfect weapon, but I would have had to act fast to get to it. When I stood up, I started walking towards them and I think it confused them a little. 

They backed off a little but they were still there. The biggest kid kept lunging toward me and swiping his knife at my neck level. He kept his distance far enough that I was not under immediate threat from the knife, but it was close enough to make you uncomfortable (4 feet, 1.3m). The one bus stop employee must have heard something and came out of a room and started yelling. I think he must have known who they were and they eventually left. 

The closest US consulate is in Erbil, Iraq. With the insanely bureaucratic border crossing, its about 6 hours away. The closest consulate in Turkey was about 8 hours away. While this was happening I was thinking my best ""escape"" route would be fleeing back into the safety of Iraq, which would sound counter intuitive to most people. I was not planning on waiting around for police either if anything happened. I would have got the hell out of there to the closest consulate.

I finally came clean to my mom the day before that I was in Northern Iraq for the past week and a half (I would never tell my dad before/when I was there, he would have a heart attack). This was prompted by accidentally going through Kirkuk, a dangerous city even by Iraqi standards (in fact a few days ago an internal checkpoint I think I used was hit with a car bomb. Best case it was 5 km away, worst case it was the exact one, the news wasnt too specific). Other than than that I felt completely safe the vast majority of the time. When I called my mom she said she trusted my judgement but said ""I have to admit, I'm glad you're going back to Turkey tomorrow."" Two hours in, and some asshole is swiping a knife at my throat. I thought about how absurdly random this world is and how people's perceptions can be completely off. I just started laughing my ass off. I still have never told my parents this story though, and I doubt I ever will. 

All said and done, I had been traveling between destinations for the better part of that day (well over 12 hours). I got to Diyarbakir about 11 pm (iirc). When I got back to Diyarbakir, I splurged in the one nice hotel that entire trip. I got a bottle of Jack, flipped on CNN International, and got trashed alone. 

**In Germany** I was just walking back to my hostel late at night. A gang saw me and started chasing me. I ducked down an alley and got away. ",0,1398380747,null,0,false,0,ch18ven,t3_23uyd4,t1_ch18ven,t1_ch17bm5,null,1433507277,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,gamas,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Remember UKIP has to fend of accusations of being ""Racist! / Xenophobe!"" for having the temerity to bring up the subject of immigration which was a taboo subject due to the PC-noughties of the Labour era.

I agree that the ""racist/xenophobe"" argument is weak in this context, I don't quite understand what you mean by ""PC-noughties""?  The problem I have with UKIP's policy on immigration is that it is based on a fundamentally flawed interpretation of the available data. It is true in general that net migration in the UK sees more coming in than going out. However, let us consider just EU net migration. It actually turns out that more people in the UK emigrate to other EU countries than EU nationals immigrate to the UK (a net migration rate of -70000 in 2011). (Source: www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn06077.pdf) Our immigration problem is therefore absolutely nothing to do with our membership to the EU (in fact a study carried out by the Migration Advisory Committee concluded the impact of immigration from EU member states has a negligible impact on employability).

It is also worth noting that there are at least 400,000 Britons living in Spain making up 8.9% of Spain's immigrant population. Ironically, Farage once stated that these immigrants were good contributors to the Spanish economy (so apparently immigrants are okay as long as they are Britons stamping over other countries).

&gt; Secondly, for polical parties for a long time, to talk about EU politics was the equivalent of:
""Don't mention the war/EU!""""

I have to admit I agree, the only major politician who has made an honest attempt to actually staple home the pro-EU argument is Nick Clegg and he's a complete wet sponge.

&gt; Given the daily harangue-ing in part due to some oddballs (Bloom, Raining gays[1] et al.) falling off the back of the party bus but also the hegemony of the Leftist-cultural media in the UK

The problem is that there are too many oddballs.  I appreciate Farage has made an honest attempt to clean them out of the party but it is clear UKIP's vetting policy is lax at best.

&gt; Leftist-cultural media in the UK 

Except others would point out the media is right-wing (in fact a study of the BBC concluded that it is definitely more pro-Tory).  The reality however is that left and right wing are outdated concepts that can not accurately describe the complex political landscape.

&gt; (see: So total is the Left's cultural ascendancy that no one likes to mention the socialist roots of fascism[2] ]

Yeah The Telegraph is talking bollocks on this one.  One of the main defining features of fascism is its complete opposition to everything socialist/communist. I'll let a historian/political science person explain this better though.

My problem with UKIP isn't the typical kneejerk reaction. My problem is that their interpretation of the world is completely divorced from the available facts - it is simply scaremongering and posturing. They have yet to provide an independent, peer-reviewed study that claims that the best course for Briton is to leave the EU, whilst there exists independent, peer-reviewed studies that say the EU does us no harm and in fact benefits us.

tl;dr You're right that attacking them for being racists/xenophobes is a weak approach.  But I can attack them on the fact they are wrong.",0,1398384892,null,0,false,0,ch1ap8e,t3_23ukq3,t1_ch1ap8e,t1_ch16kkq,null,1433508139,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

1 - I resigned from a job a few months ago that was my dream job for something that in now my golden opportunity job.  Put in your notice, work your ass off through it, and be confident in the decision.  If you don't you'll question yourself, and the people you used to work with will wonder why you would do it if you didn't have the conviction to put everything behind it.  Big for you mentally in the long run especially if it is a step up / challenging position.

2 - What does this have to do with anything?  If you wrote something through a reputable publisher, I would assume your rights are protected.

3 - Keep a permanent address in your home country as well, or call whatever company you do business with in the UK and maybe tell them your new contact information.  

If these are things you're concerned with are you sure all of the other nuances of an international move are for you?  These are some of the easier items, I'm not trying in any way to be rude - but having lived in Berlin for a year (Probably the easiest place for a foreigner to live), I would be lost without my German wife.

À côté de ça tu as Montpellier où deux bureaux se trouvent, dont un qui dev les Rayman sous la direction de Michel Ancel. Encore à côté de ça tu as Annecy où les multis d'AC ont toujours été faits et qui comporte des techniciens exceptionnels et enfin ils ont une structure naissante à Lille qui dev des petites applications type Dr Kawashima. À noter que ce qui fait vivre Ubi c'est Just Dance et Rayman, AC n'est pas vraiment rentable et ils le maintiennent parce que c'est une bonne vitrine commerciale. Du coup la prod Française participe largement à la rentabilité de la société.

Y'a quand même un bon bout d'ubisoft qui est toujours à la maison, contrairement à ce que tu semble croire. Je suis pas du tout certain que MTL soit leur plus grosse structure sachant qu'ils commencent à avoir pas mal de monde sur leurs pôles asiatiques (Chengdu/Singapour/Shanghai) mais là dessus j'ai plus les chiffres en tête donc je peux me tromper.

Y'a un gros nombre de boite qui ont de l'avenir dans le jeu en France, comme Arkane Studios à Lyon (Dishonored, Dark Messiah) ou Pretty Simple qui a produit Criminal Case, jeu FB de l'année 2013.

Mein Akkusativobjekt im Satz war ja wohl ""gegen eine wertvolle Lektion"". Also bitte. (Wobei sich beim zweiten lesen ""gegen etwas herziehen scheiße anhört, müsste ""*über*"" heißen, nur fürs Protokoll.)

&gt;Methoden und die Art frühkindlicher Erziehung ab, die durch die Sandmannfolge propagiert wird

Also Ich find die Methoden weltklasse und mehr als kindertauglich. Die Werte die in der Folge vermittelt wurden sind ja mal 1a und auch sogar christentauglich.

Nächstenliebe kennste, wa?

Alleine die Tatsache dass da wieder über politischer ""Propaganda"", ""Umerziehung"", ""Indoktrination"" usw gelabert wird, verrät mir aus welcher Ecke diese völlig überzogene und windige Kritik kommt.

Ein jämmerlich niederträchtiger und sensationalistischer Versuch die üblichen Milieus abzufischen. Abgesehen davon, dass die ganze Sachen mit den wechselnden Identitäten ja mal sehr übertrieben is. Völlig fehlinterpretiert um o.g. Zweck zu erfüllen.

Der Inhalt der Sendung lässt dreijährige Kinder anscheinend an der eigenen Identität zweifeln. Was geht mit den Leuten die sich so einen Käse ausdenken? Please.

Die Sendung lehrt Akzeptanz und Toleranz, die Aussage dass die Identitätsthematik die Kinder nur verwirrt is fast schon zu absurd um sie ernstazunehmen.

Erstens verwirrt ungefähr alles ein dreijähriges Kind. Das liegt in der Natur der Sache, deshalb ist es vorteilhaft während dem (sozialen) Lernprozess ordentliche Impulse zu geben; mit dem (lebenslangen, btw) lernen wird die Verwirrung beseitigt.

Zweitens, wenn man den Text liest und mal so zwischen den Zeilen liest, dann läuft diese Angst vor der Verwirrtheit (was is da grad nochmal schlimm dran?) doch nur auf die Angst vor einer  ""Beschwulung"" hinaus -nennen wir es mal einfach mal beim Wort.

Und DAS is ja wohl die Höhe.

Drittens, glaubt hier ja wohl niemand, dass ein Kind dass sich gerade einmal selber im Spiegel selber erkennen kann auf einmal -statt der absolut überwiegenden emotionalen, zwischenmenschlichen Seite Beactung zu schenken- die Identitätsseite ergründet und eine sexuelle Identitätskrise erleidet. Die emotionale Thematik, dass bei einem asozialen Verhalten -Homophobie- Menschen verletzt werden ist im Vordergrund, die Existenz solcher Leute wird praktisch vorausgesetzt. Das dreijährige Kind denkt doch da nicht viel nach drüber -kann es kognitiv auch gar nicht- und selbst wenn es das (später) tut, schadets auch nicht. Wie auch?

Mein Gott. Das Kind bekommt gesagt, dass jeder sich fühlen darf und soll wie er will und erinnert sich in einer adäquaten Situation an diesen gelernten Grundsatz. Wie wenn man sagt, dass man Schwarze nicht wegen der Hautfarbe beleidigt. Die meisten Kinder denken nicht drüber nach, aber setzen das Gelernte erstmal um und werden dadurch im weiteren Leben beeinflusst.



Aber ein Kleinkind wechselt doch nicht plötzlich seine Identität zu einer alten Oma oder einem homosexuellen Lackfetischiste - oder stürzt in eine Identitätskrise á la Midlifecrisis. Wie kliescheehafter lässt sich diese dümmliche Debatte denn noch führen? Da dreh ich ja schon fast am Rad, so unerhört finde Ich das.

Und nochmal, damits jetzt endlich mal klar is:

Firstly incase you havent noticed there has been no inter EU military action of member states since its inception so thats not an issue. Military as a whole would be a huge issue especially for myself as an Irishman. 

My country is strictly neutral yet a common EU military policy (I doubt such a thing is even remotely possible) would likely compromise that position. Also I've a pretty clear conscience that my national army take part in peacekeeping operations only as opposed to illegal wars in the desert perpetrated by the US and Britain.

What exactly is a 'truer EU'? The EU was set up as an economic trading zone and has long gone beyond that remit. If you want it to fit in with its 'truer' identity mass disintegration would need to occur.

Firstly there is unity in the peoples of Europe just not on a collective level. However national and regional identities remain high. The problem in your analysis in this regard is that youre comparing apples and oranges in the US/EU. The US is a historical nation state of the world while the EU is not.

Islam, just like Christianity is too much of an absolutist religion which when introduced to masses of uneducated people can be used to extreme effect to induce them to act in ways which normal people would consider irrational if not downright cruel. 

one interesting thing is that a lot of Pakistani muslims in the U.K are as extreme if not more extreme than a lot of the extremists in Pakistan itself- for example in Pakistani cities its very rare to see women wear the veil or for people to solely rely on sharia law yet Pakistani muslims in the UK do that all the time.

Estimates show European economies would benefit more than the US economy. So who is actually the colonial power? It seems very popular to call the US colonialists because there are Starbucks and McDonald's abroad or other business related things. Comparing these things to colonialism is ridiculous. Dont worry, your country will never be dethroned as the top colonialist power of all time. 

Personally, since people on both sides of the Atlantic find these unpopular, its probably best if they're left out. But if the US government (or a state government) takes actions that harm EU company interests I would hope you dont complain about how the EU company has no legal recourse.
