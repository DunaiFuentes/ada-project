Sort of. This is a half-truth. The council nominated him, but it's not the full story. The council made a beeline for Juncker because he was the EPP's candidate. De facto handing over the power of selecton to the parliament. That *is* giving up sovreignty.

&gt;The EP can not just pick the next commission president. 

It's a technicality. The same way the EP has de-facto legislative initiative, the EP has acquired de-facto selection of the European Prime Minister. 

&gt;Treaties are not changed because of who was nominated.

No treaty was changed. Power is not solely transferred by treaties. Plenty of the power structure in our own UK is not established on paper. It doesn't matter. Real power shifted today, for better or for worse. You can support the change (I don't get the impression you support or oppose it?), or you can be against it. Or you can not care, I guess. What you can't do, is deny its existence.

To the remainder of your post: I don't think you can sensibly deny, particularly not today, that the EU is going to become closer and more integrated, with or without the UK?

Sometimes, I like to play with the homophones / homographs / whatever in German and see if I can construct sentences in German that use the same-sounding word or sequence of words more than once in a row.

I think I first noticed this when I saw a statement like ""Wenn ich ein Fahrrad aber hätte, hätte ich ...."" and I thought it was interesting that two ""hätte""-s ended up appearing adjacently.

When I was first getting really interested in the language, I wanted to invent statements that displayed this potential of the language. I was just reminded of this by this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/German/comments/299g58/when_speaking_is_there_a_difference_in/ which talks about the similarity of ""meine"" (first person singular verb) and ""meine"" (possessive adjective).

Some statements:

Telling a person politely to ""take care of her"" = ""Passen **Sie auf sie auf**!""

""sie auf"", at least phonetically, appears twice in a row.

Nonsense. It raises entry barriers for companies that were based in countries with less burdensome regulations before the EU went and imposed more regulation. Of course it will often lower regulatory burdens for other companies, but pretending it lowers them rather than raises them for many countries is completely dishonest.

You also don't explain why a level playing field is better than regulatory competition between countries.

No one said anything about Yanukovych when he was moving towards the EU, he was the 'perfect' president...that is until he turned down that shitty deal. 600 million from the EU, versus 12 *billions* from Russia, it's a no-brainer for a country on the verge of default. 

I don't know what you mean by saying Russia was trying very actively to destabilize Ukraine. Are you refering to the trade barriers before the events ? Had Yanukovych signed the EU deal, it would've allowed EU goods to transit freely into Russia, inflicting serious economic damage upon her, [since they signed a FTA together](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CISFTA). You could imagine France reacting the same way if Spain signs a freedom of movement deal with Algeria while telling France 'this doesn't concern her'.

The EU forced Yanukovych's hand, they didn't care about Ukraine being a very divided country. Let's remember Maidan wasn't supported by Eastern and Southern Ukraine.

Instead, they, along with the US, relied on ultra-nationalist paramilitary groups to overthrow a legitimately elected government. [Going against the EP recommendations](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2012-0507+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN), they talked to a coalition comprising Svoboda, who's one of the most dangerous antisemitic groups out there [according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center](http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Wiesenthal-ranks-top-10-anti-Semites-Israel-haters). Svoboda officials *celebrated* the killings in Odessa, they bury ex-SS members dressed up as Nazis. Right Sector are the heirs of Stepan Bandera, who collaborated with the Nazis. [Just look at their Facebook.](http://www.les-crises.fr/secteur-droit-c-est-ca/) How do you think the Russians feel about the fact we're supporting groups who allied themselves with people who killed 20 millions of Russians ? It's like everyone here forgot the US also relied on the far-right in South America.

&gt; US European and Eurasian affairs would have a pretty good grasp of Russia's workings.

She has no understanding at all, people in Washington are fools. They tought they could steal Ukraine, the birthplace of Russia, to oust Russia from her only warmwater port and have Ukraine join NATO.

 'Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be an Empire', [that's what Zbigniew Brzezinski said.](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303653004579213664244095466). That's exactly what the neo-cons who invaded Iraq on false pretense want: *“Our first objective is to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival, either on the territory of the former Soviet Union or elsewhere [China], that poses a threat on the order of that posed formerly by the Soviet Union. This is a dominant consideration underlying the new regional defense strategy and requires that we endeavor to prevent any hostile power from dominating a region whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to generate global power.”*

The US governments goal here is hegemony. They don't care about Europe, or Ukraine, or anyone for that matter. They re-ignited the Cold War by extending NATO's border. [I'm not the one saying, that's the father of containment George Kennan himself.](http://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/02/opinion/foreign-affairs-now-a-word-from-x.html)

true,tusksrus,UKGB,United Kingdom | Blairite,"&gt;My point is, that you claim that the EP shouldn't have a say in proposing the comission

To clarify, I think it should be taken into account the party with the most votes, but I don't think it extends so far as for the EP to actually pick the individual themsleves. It's not the same as saying the EP should not have a say.

&gt;but I would think that there were even fewer who voted with comission candidates in mind in the national elections

Well, obviously... but the difference is that if it's the parliament that selects the PotEC, then the President can (falsely, in my view, for reasons I explained) claim to have a democratic mandate, and can push his position to be *above* the other European Council members on that basis. 

That really does represent a change in the constitutional makeup of the EU that has not been consented so far by the European people. In my view, it goes against the spirit of the treaties and it's a change of the magnitude we would normally only see in a treaty change. Since treaty changes require referenda in several countries, I think it's inappropriate to rely on technicalities and de-facto shifts and grabs for power to concentrate the sort of power reserved for elected officials in one person who wasn't actually elected.

&gt;The advantage of the EP is that people have the freedom to vote on eu policy and leadership indepentently of national policy.

But then the MEP candidates should campaign on the platform and agenda of what they're going to be doing in this parliamentary term. In reality, their campaigns are run by national parties on national issues because voters vote on national issues. They shouldn't; but while they do, the fact that the European Parliament can vote on policy regardless of national parliaments and national interests is actually a bad thing. It just creates a wildcard scenario where we elect MEPs with no platform or manifesto and we see what comes out of the hat. It's not how real parliaments work.

&gt;The fact that people keep voting for EPP and S&amp;D around europe despite so much euroscepticism and dissatisfaction with how the EU is run I think is a sign that people may not feel like compromising on the national level to influence EU policy.

They don't vote for the EPP and S&amp;D. They vote for the Labour Party, the Conservative Party, the Spanish PP and PSOE. They vote for Merkel's Christian Democrats and Hollande's socialists. A minority voted for Schulz's S&amp;D group and Juncker's EPP.

&gt;the council this time around chose Junker

Because they were willing to cede power at an election notable for the rise of Eurosceptic parties. Doesn't that seem a bit inappropriate? As to the rest, I'm more comfortable with him being accountable to the council than MEPs, for reasons I stated. You make a fair point about commissioners being chosen by member states, but how long until the President simply chooses one from each member state himself, delegating the commissioners from the countries that defy him to minor and uninfluential roles?

The Articles of Confederation in 1777 established a weak government. 

The United States Constitution was ratified in 1788. 

I think for your comparison the Articles of Confederation would be what you're looking for. It's important to note just how weak the government was though and how hot the battle of states rights vs. federal rights raged. In fact that fight directly led to our bloody civil war and continues to rage, albeit a bit more cooled, to this day.

What's not understandable is when they don't see how Europeans don't have this thing and when they use ""positive stereotypes"", say in comics like Asterix, they are not being ""racist"".",0,1403906994,null,0,false,0,ciiv3l9,t3_299h6k,t1_ciiv3l9,t1_ciithmj,null,1434435391,-7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-7

lets say i own a car company, currently my company is meeting regulations for safety in my home country, but lets say i want to expand into other markets and increase my sales. But wait, every country has its own safety regulations which means that each car will have to be different depending on the country it is being sold in.

However, lets say that regulations where normalized across **ALL** countries(currently 28 for the EU if im not mistaken, the biggest economic block in the world), this allows me to sell my cars, with no modifications to meet regulations; in all countries that are part of this union.

It also means that safety standards will increase in countries that lack them. However, there is an increased initial investment for those countries that are lacking regulation, but it can also mean that countries with regulations that are deemed unnecessary the barriers are actually decreased. overall, in the long term it is extremely beneficial and denying this seems incredibly naive to me.",0,1403908487,null,0,false,0,ciivqj1,t3_298ejo,t1_ciivqj1,t1_ciit5ae,null,1434435764,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

We don't have that problem....

Last year the court dealt with 955 applications from the UK, of which only 19 were considered admissible and eight were ruled a violation of the convention.
&gt; 
&gt; The vast majority of the Rule 39 urgent applications relate to asylum seekers facing immediate deportation.

Well, I think it has a bit less because they don't campaign on issues related to what they're going to be doing there, but on national issues unrelated to the EP. I also see it as the place where the rejects from national parliaments go as some sort of work experience trip. It makes the connection between their votes and their constituents' votes less strong than a national parliament. It doesn't compare to the Bundestag or to Westminster.

&gt;Don't know what you mean by ""democratization to mean centralization""

I mean that, everyone seems to agree that ""reform"" is needed. But to some of us, ""reform"" means ""more Europe""; to others, it means ""less Europe"". The ""more Europe"" camp are the ""democratization = centralization"" camp that I mention; they see the solution to reform in the EU as establishing a more powerful commission which national governments will cede control to; having a unified foreign and defence policy; unified tax policy, etc. 

On the other hand, ""reform"" according to Cameron and friends means the opposite: it means a bonfire of European regulations, a reform to the free movement of people, and a lessening of the influence the EU institutions have on sovereign member states; the opposite of centralization.",0,1403913062,null,0,false,0,ciixkrn,t3_298sc7,t1_ciixkrn,t1_ciixbed,null,1434436675,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

There are some countries where it is highly offensive in their culture and harshly punished to joke about Islam, but does that stop us here in the West? of course not, because those are their beliefs and moral standards, they aren't universally adhered to.

Natürlich darf man den Holocaust nicht vergessen, wie könnte man auch wenn man in so vielen Situationen daran erinnert wird. Keiner, bis auf wieder ein paar Idioten, leugnet den Holocaust oder sagt das es nicht das schrecklichste Kapitel in der deutschen Geschichte war. Die erste Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts haben unsere Vorfahren Fehler über Fehler begangen, ob erster oder zweiter Weltkrieg oder das nicht-festhalten an der Weimarer Republik. 

Dennoch bin ich der festen Meinung das wir nach 1945 eine 180° Drehung gemacht haben, und uns so zu einem der vorbildlichsten Nationen der Welt entwickelt haben. Das waren wir nicht alleine, wir hatten riesengroßen Druck von der Völkergemeinschaft, und das zurecht. Ich finde wir können trotzdem darauf Stolz sein das wir uns zu einem Sozialstaat entwickelt haben, der viele Menschen auf der Welt unterstützt, denen es bedeutend schlechter geht als uns. Ob das nun die Aufnahme von Kriegsflüchtlingen ist, humanitäre Missionen, oder das Entsenden von Gütern, Ärzten und/oder THW(-ähnlichen) Gruppen oder monetäre Mittel. Auch wenn sowas auch oft von NATO/EU/UN angestoßen wird, tragen wir einen großen Teil dieser Hilfen. Zugegeben der Rettungsschirm für Griechenland/Spanien etc. war nicht unbedingt erfolgreich, aber das ist ein anderes Thema.

Ich finde das ich schon stolz auf die Entwicklungen in Deutschland stolz sein kann, weil uns mehr verbindet als nur eine Flagge. Es ist unsere Kultur die von unseren Vorfahren geprägt wurde, die uns demnach prägt und ausmacht. Diese Kultur und Denkweisen haben Einfluss auf unser Handeln jetzt und in der Zukunft. Deshalb kann ich stolz sein, weil ohne diese Menschen wären wir nicht die die wir sind. Ich bin stolz darauf auf deren Taten aufzubauen.

Damit wären wir beim Thema was ich für Deutschland tue. 
Zum Einen bin ich, ob hier oder im Ausland (reise viel) offen für alle Kulturen und versuche jeden unvoreingenommen kennenzulernen. Einige meiner besten Freunde haben türkische, afrikanische oder asiatische Wurzeln. Ich glaube das kann lang nicht jeder von sich behaupten, vor allem die älteren Generationen. 
Ich habe ein High-School Jahr in den USA gemacht, und habe da, der Resonanz nach die ich bekommen habe, zu urteilen, einen positiven Eindruck hinterlassen. Außerdem hab ich meinen Geschichtskursklassenkameraden (so ein Wort ist noch ein Grund Deutschland zu lieben :D) mehr über den Holocaust beigebracht als es der Lehrer je getan hätte. Für den 2. WK wurden da 4 Stunden eingeplant, in 2 von denen wurde Saving Private Ryan geguckt, in einer habe ich ein ausführliches Referat gehalten, und in der letzten hat der Lehrer dann was erzählt.
Darüber hinaus werde ich selbst im Herbst für ein halbes Jahr nach Nicaragua gehen um da bei einer [humanitären non-profit Organisation](http://www.promosaico.org/website.php) ein Praktikum zu machen. 

Das war jetzt ein bisschen viel, ich hoffe aber das wenigstens du dir die Zeit nimmst das zu lesen! Hat mich gefreut mal ausführlich meine Meinung runterzuschreiben, und mit dir zu diskutieren :)

Parliaments took powers from bodies, individuals, or institutions with a less extensive mandate than themselves. In this case, though, the Parliament was *given* the power, and given it, reasonably enough, at a European level, because while the national governments are masters of the EU collectively, they're not its masters individually, and in purely European terms the Parliament has a wider and more direct mandate than the member state governments. 

The European Parliament isn't something that takes, or *can* take powers from national governments, because the EU is something created by Treaty and limited by Treaty. It can only have the powers given to it.

In this case, if the member states presented a united front (or even semi-united) against the pressure of the Parliament, the Parliament could not win, although they could force a deadlock. That's unlikely, though, because, again, the EU isn't some Martian institution - the majority of MEPs belong to the political parties that form the governments of the member states.

Kind of hard. Mikerust maybe of the ultra-right, promoting hate towards muslims, or he might be of the left that chose to bash everything that reeks to religion. In the first case he would be a xenophobe, in the second case he would be a fierce defender of a dead god. The problem is that the ultra-catholic right frames itself as the defender of a secular state, while at the same time it's promoting traditional family values (and return to the church, the christian one). It's because of them that no real discussion can take place, and that integration will eventually fail, which later on they can use (or use already) as the prove that those barbarians want to destroy our society, they defend the clash of civilizations...

So, no, it's absolutely not irrelevant, because as long as the left doesn't know how to react properly, the right frames the discussion as they see: you're against islamization or you're a pro-muslim bend on the destruction of what is our western culture.

Do you know the differences between these 4 different organisms and their different powers: [European council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council), [European Commission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission), [Council of the European Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union), [Council of Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe)?

- EU has few powers. Despite what national politicians like to say, the actions of the EU are pretty limited. 

- We don't have EU-wide elections or media discussions. The latest elections were the first time I am aware of when the candidates for the commission presidency were given a bit of media time. And UK reaction reminded everyone that actually this was not a vote for such a person.

So here you are: in European elections, people are voting for institutions with few power, they don't even know if their votes really will decide the leader, and anyway this leader has very unclear powers.

For people to be interested in EU, it needs to be:

- transparent
- simpler
- democratic
- powerful

I lived there for 2 years and I fucking hated it. Which house are you in? 

It was the noise more than anything there that pissed me off and the fact that despite there being so many rules and regulations living there , no one is actually capable of resolving any of your problems. 

I complained over and over again about being woken up at 530 in the morning because of the various shit that goes on there (setting up rooms, cleaning, moving shit in and out of the theatre all night, deliveries, all night parties not in people's rooms but actually in the official Cite U facilities) but the incompetent fuckers were too powerless to do anything.

The problem is is that there is no one body in charge of everything there. Each house has it's own organisation and there is a different group who run the facilities (theatre, restaurant, conference rooms, sports stuff) because of this they have only their own interests at stake. And well if you can t sleep or study then fuck you. Its not our problem. 

I found it kind of pathetic because of all of the enthusiasm they have for trying to bring people together and all of these big social goals they talk about at Cite U, and the money that is wasted on events and stuff when they actually struggle to deliver basic needs.

The stereotyping comes from the fact that you assumed a subreddit comprised of Japanese people would be racist, despite the fact that Redditor demographics are generally left-leaning and not representative of their respective country's attitudes.

And the ""twofold"" part comes from the fact that I thought you were making an insinuation about expats living in Japan at first, but after reading through your comment again it becomes obvious that you don't actually know what the fuck you're talking about since you don't actually read /r/Japan.

The example quoted on the image is not that *scientific*. Some others try to be smarter with their rhetoric: subscribe to the ideas of ethnic-nationalism, playing on *incompatibility* rather than *inferiority* and even going as far as saying that it is *racialism* and not *racism*. Which is all vein considering that the former always has led to the latter, as was shown in the 20th Century eras of US Segregation and South African apartheid. In the end it all boils down to racism.

The example quoted in the image on the other hand is just ignorant of the facts. Failing to make the distinction between the social perception of the *black gang rapper* and the reality on the ground, claiming there is a *norm* in a continent that has been repeatedly shown to be the most diverse continent in the history of ever and attributing to race what is more accurately and easily attributed to social status.

Sure, it isn't football hooligan level of racism. But it is not far off.  In absence of both the bigger picture and the vital details, he just resorted to the closest thing he knows about the matter.

I don't really like the comment, I think it's wrong to claim that all black men are like this. But on the other hand there are problems with some racial groups that there aren't with other groups. To dismiss the people who are concerned about this with ""you're racist"" won't help at all.
Because the problem doesn't go away. and the people with these opinions feel like they are right, and because of that they get called racist.

And look at your comment back, it only says that it's racist and tries to dismiss it that way. you don't argue against his arguments, you argue that it's not politically correct. you try to shut him up by screaming ""that's racist"". That just won't work.
 
- If you look at his comment. 

You could argue that it's unfair to compare America with the Third World. 
Just like we in Europe aren't looking at our salaries and say, oh, but in XXX country they live off a few euro's a day, so there is no need to increase my salary. You look at the other people within your community and they should be compared with Americans instead of the Third world.

To say that members of that group are commonly willing to kill for a nicer car isn't true. However, they are relatively more often willing to kill than for example the Germans. Then about what he said about behavior is true. If you go from Africa to Europe things are different and it can be hard to change. To go from a kill or be killed society to a peaceful one isn't a change that's easy.

I do disagree with what was said about the nature of these people, they are the same as us, however because they come from a place where different behavior is normal they may behave differently. that doesn't mean that's their nature. Because if white parents adopt a black kid it'll probably act just as white as other white teens. So it's not the nature of black people that makes  them do this.

As for phones charges, the effect of the EU law will be to put up prices on costs in your own country. 

As for losing a job and working abroad, both the UK and Germany have low unemployment: the real problems are in Southern Europe where there are terrible employment problems caused partly by the euro.

The British people working in Germany help the German economy, so it would be surprising if you sent them back, especially given that there are many Turks living in Germany who are not in the EU. However, it will be your choice. Equally, given that more than a million properties in Spain are owned by Brits, i don't think they would send Brits home, given the crisis in their real estate market.

It's not racism. I repeat, it's not racism. I'll show what racism is:
&gt;Racism consists of both prejudice and discrimination based in social perceptions of **biological** differences between peoples.

I highlighted the important word for you.

I have never met anyone who would say that a race is ""something negative here"" because of ""something related to their biology here"". That doesn't mean there aren't people who really think that though. I am just sick of how everyone keeps calling any comment slightly negative towards a race racism. It's not racism goddammit.

I'll show you an example:
&gt; Black people kill people because it's in their DNA.

This is racism.

&gt; Black people kill people because of their culture.

This isn't racism.

The problem is that when someone says something like this:

&gt; Black people are thieves.

You cannot tell if it's racism or not, but it probably isn't, because people are generally not dumb enough to think that it has anything to do with black people's biology.

I am probably one of those people you would call a racist if you consider the second example racist. I don't have a problem with black people because I don't have any experience with them. But I have a problem with gypsies because I do.

true,dreugeworst,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; So, no, it's absolutely not irrelevant, because as long as the left doesn't know how to react properly, the right frames the discussion as they see

But this has nothing to do with what MikeRust said. He's not part of the left who don't know how to react as he's quite clear on what he doesn't like about the islamic culture in Turkey. He's also not merely a xenophobe, it's entirely understandable that he doesn't want to give people free access to our countries who don't respect the rule of law. That's a basic enlightenment ideal that I think is at the heart of our society.

You bringing up LePen seems like a way for you to avoid engaging MikeRust and instead railing against other people. 



sidenote:

I happen to think it hasn't been shown that a significant portion of Turkey's population believe that, and are willing to act on it. It is clear to me though that most Muslims take religious law more seriously than most Christians do. 

It's difficult to find a Christian arguing for implementing the rules in Leviticus and harder still for one arguing those are more important than secular laws. You might find a lot that say god's laws are more important in some philosophical sense though.

Ok, now go look at their standards of living, their growth rates, their access to luxuries, and so on pre euro and post euro. The Euro itself is not the causal factor, despite what many want to believe and such being the conventional wisdom in English-language media.

Rather, the euro reduced their individual flexibility to act. It isn't like Greece would be an economic powerhouse without the Euro. The euro allowed for tremendous economic growth in the country. Bad policy decisions and poor investments by financial markets brought it down. It is tempting to say the euro was the enabler, but there is concrete reason to believe that if Greece had not adopted the euro better decisions would be made. It's fantasy to assume such. It's one the British policy makers and media are all too willing to swallow because the international financial market structures which greatly contributed to Greece's troubles benefit the British greatly.

Take religion for example, If someone really believes in god then saying that their belief is wrong because it's unscientific won't make them disbelieve. They would probably think that they are right, so then science must be wrong. Which leads to people that dislike science because they only see it as something people try to disprove god with, while they are clearly seeing/feeling/believing that god exists. Same goes with racism, if you dismiss something only because it's 'wrong' (unscientific/racist) without going after the reasons as to why people believe what they believe then it won't change their minds.

It has more to do with silencing German nationalists who were the main driver of European instability by making Germany aggressive.

Europe's resident troublemaker was Germany. It has no natural borders and felt the need to assert itself through shows of strength. The German nationalists behind that thinking were marginalised by European integration, giving Germans an additional European identity to make them feel secure. This process started years before German integration into NATO. Certainly NATO and the US played a big role, but only European integration had a permanent effect by moving intra-European conflict into a political forum where these conflicts can be settled without bloodshed.

Air forces tend to be much more decision and consequently often much less destructive in these situations.

They aren't actually trying to destroy their own cities, just the people in them that are causing trouble.

You are right that culture is more often the problem but even in this example

The fact that you use Black people as the group is racist. Because this group is different from other groups based on their skin color which is a biological difference. 

even if you say that the intention wasn't racist, it's worded in a racist way. A non racist way of saying this would be people of this culture kill people because of their culture.

Because by using ""black people kill"", you insinuate that other races with the same culture wouldn't kill because they aren't black.

So even if your intent isn't racist you kinda word it in a racist way.
On the other hand, the opposite to this would be to word everything in an extremely politically correct way. Which is hardly any better.
So I only wanted to clarify why I think it can be seen as racist. even if your intention isn't to be racist. 

This means that other people who don't know your intentions might think it's simply racist. However those other people should also keep in mind that maybe it's not racist but just worded in a way that makes it seem so. And then when they dismiss it as racist they dismiss a non-racist opinion as racist which doesn't help.

Your original claim was ""This lowers entry barriers for companies""; you didn't qualify this statement, e.g., by saying ""sometimes, this lowers entry barriers for companies"". You haven't, in your response, shown that it is impossible for barriers to entry to be raised rather than lowered by the activity you describe, because it's just not true.

If we have country A (e.g., Ireland) and country B (e.g., Greece), and they have their own labour and product market regulations, which are more of a barrier to entry for new companies in country B than in country A. They can do several things. One thing that can do is say

""if a product is produced in country A or country B, it is allowed to be sold in either country, in any quantity, without customs duties if it is made in one country and sold in the other"", i.e., a free trade agreement

they could also say

""we shall change the laws in country A and country B to have the same regulatory burden, intermediate between the original laws of the two countries, and allow goods produced in either country to be sold in either country in any quanitity without customs duties"", i.e., an economic union

In the latter case, there are companies in country A, or people wanting to start companies in county A, that can no longer afford to produce products for either country A or country B, and new opportunities in country B to expand companies or start new ones.

Whether any of this benefits an individual company or person depends on whether you're a producer or consumer of the goods affected, how much it costs you to produce them (or how much you're prepared to pay to consume them), and whether you are in country A, country B, or a third country.

So, it's possible for some of the producers in country A and country B to gang together against the consumers, and against existing and potential producers, and lobby for laws to screw everyone else over.",0,1403950706,null,0,false,0,cij8655,t3_298ejo,t1_cij8655,t1_ciivqj1,null,1434441744,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

No, you tried to fob it off by claiming that ""the circumstances were exceptional"".

&gt;Until somebody finds a solution renewables as a primary source of power are not viable.

That's simply wrong. It's already possible to have most of the electricity generated on yearly basis by means of renewables, and then you fill in the gaps with fossils... just like we would with nuclear. Then any grid improvements will reduce the need for fossil fuels further (which is a matter of investments, not technology) and the bar for energy storage is put a whole bit lower because peak production electricity is practically free.

&gt;we are talking about improving performance of the grid tenfold or hundredfold in multiple ways.

What does that even mean? You're just arbitrarily describing it as too difficult, not saying something that is true.

&gt;Unless power grid technology starts to boom as electronics with their Moor's law it will not happen any time soon.

It's not a matter of technology. It's a matter of investment, up till now the grid has been designed for national production based on centralized power plants. So we need investments in long-distance connectivity and production monitoring. And frankly, even with a purely nuclear grid that would *still* be a good idea as it significantly increases resilience and dependability of the network.

&gt;Problem is that Germany does not replace old plants at all so average age is much higher than it would be if they did.

If they underperform because they are of old age then it's simply a bad idea to keep them running that long, and they should have been shut down already. The current no new plants policy just revealed that inconvenient fact then instead of drowning it in the average.

&gt;Besided you brought this point as a counterargument to nuclear being more reliable but malfuctions and maintanance is not just problem of nuclear power plants. All power plants might malfuction and might need unscheduled maintanance, but renewables have additional problem of being dependent on weather.

The difference is that a malfunctioning renewable unit doesn't even matter for production scheduling. They're small and they're legion, it's not big deal if one goes down for a while. Nuclear is much more vulnerable: if one plant goes down you've got a big problem, and solving it is likely non-trivial, while a renewable unit really isn't that complicated and therefore more robust to start with, and when something goes wrong it's easier and quicker to solve it. A windmill that malfunctions doesn't need an investigation of the better part of a year to find out what's wrong.
Renewable networks are designed to deal with unscheduled activity. Unscheduled maintenance is not a problem for them.

No, international accounting standards are what defines what signing off means. It means clearing accounts as being free from error. The fact the CoA gives a press release where it redefines terms so it doesn't make the EU look bad doesn't change what the standard meaning of the term is.


&gt; If one questions the direction of the project, one questions the project itself -- a project is defined by its direction. If you go somewhere else, you work on a different project. France may want exceptions when it comes to details, but they don't opt out of major undertakings. Not Schengen, not the Euro, not the Common Security and Defence Policy, the list goes on.

What sort of sophistry is this? If NATO decides it has a new direction of expanding into former Soviet states, does that mean members that criticise that are ""questioning the project itself""? Of course not. Everyone involved in an organisation has a right to argue for what its direction should be without being considered traitors to the cause. 

&gt; How did Blair put Britain at Europe's heart exactly? By following America into a war based on false premises that half of Europe rejected? Jesus.

That's completely unrelated to EU policy, although its a great insight into how pro-Europeans always need to squeeze in a jab at America.

Wrong. Have you actually read the regulation? The actual absolute requirements it sets are very low (basically, the cucumbers should not be *really* small or show signs of rotting). The bulk of the regulation is about setting four ""quality"" classes: Extra, Class I, Class II and Class III. The idea was that retailers could specify the quality class they wanted to buy, and producers and intermediaries could know exactly what they meant, rather than having each retailer issuing its own specs and producers having to tailor their batches for each individual end retailer across Europe.

true,Frivolan,ZZZZZZguepard,Guépard,"Comme dit, je précise alors mon propos premier. 

En préambule, j'aimerais revenir sur cette notion de ""classique"" qui est bien plus fluctuante qu'on ne le croit. Il en va de la Littérature comme du reste, c'est-à-dire que le statut des œuvres bouge avec le temps, et que ce qui était/est considéré comme classique à une époque ne l'est plus par la suite. Alain Viala a ainsi énormément travaillé sur le phénomène dit de la *classicisation* ([lien](http://bbf.enssib.fr/consulter/bbf-1992-01-0006-001)), soit la façon dont un texte rentre dans le canon ""classique"" et scolaire, car les deux vont souvent de pair.

Sans rentrer dans les détails de sa réflexion, la question du ""classique"" est intimement liée à une période temporelle, à une civilisation et, surtout, à l'état de la recherche qui influence beaucoup plus qu'on ne le croit la rédaction des manuels. Il y a ainsi des phénomènes connus : on peut citer le cas de Louise Labé, inconnue du canon de la Renaissance jusqu'à une époque toute récente (en fait, jusqu'à ce qu'émerge un mouvement universitaire autour d'elle et notamment sur [la question de son existence réelle](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Lab%C3%A9#Imposture_po.C3.A9tique_.3F)) ou encore Baudelaire, considéré comme un auteur mineur jusqu'aux années 60, plus ou moins. Donc, déjà, pour les œuvres modernes (s'entend, du 16e siècle à nos jours), il y a énormément de fluctuations.

Les œuvres antiques (Homère, Euripide, Sénèque, Aristote, Platon, Cicéron...) et médiévales (Chrétien de Troie, Marie de France, Charles d'Orléans...) ont un statut plus stable, notamment du fait qu'ils sont souvent les seuls représentants retrouvés d'un genre ou d'une époque : l'unique crée le classique, si l'on peut dire. Leur influence sur l'histoire de la Littérature/de la pensée est réelle et encore aujourd'hui, il est rare de trouver un auteur qui ne s'en réclame ou qui ne s'en rappelle pas, que ce soit directement ou par l'intermédiaire d'autres lectures. Mais doit-on les connaître par cœur (ou ne serait-ce que les parcourir) pour autant ?

Étant donné que plusieurs de mes occupations (semi)professionnelles tournent autour de la Littérature, je me fais comme d'un devoir de les parcourir. Mais, très souvent, autant le dire tout de go, ils sont ennuyeux. Le style, la façon de présenter les choses... sont souvent intimement liés au contexte et traversent mal le temps. Il y a des exceptions fameuses, et ce dans toutes les époques : lire *Les Essais* ou *Don Quichotte* aujourd'hui, c'est trouver - à mon sens - une plume incroyablement moderne. Mais se plonger, aujourd'hui et au hasard, dans *L'Astrée*, *Télémaque*, *La Nausée* et même dans Balzac ou Zola dans une moindre mesure, c'est se heurter à quelque chose de très abscons. L'on peut et comme tu le préconises lire des biographies ou des monographies, faire de l'histoire littéraire... Mais même avec tout ça, je suis plutôt partisan du ""si ça ne me plaît pas, autant laisser tomber"". Pourquoi donc se forcer ? Pour évoquer d'Ormesson, ""Je partirai un jour sans avoir tout ~~dit~~ lu"". 

Ce qui me semble davantage nécessaire cependant, c'est d'avoir une vague idée du contenu du classique, ce qu'ils cachent, les moments phares. Pour *La Nausée* ainsi, connaître ce pourquoi le personnage principal à la nausée, la différence entre la nécessité et la contingence, l'homme qui lit la bibliothèque par ordre alphabétique... Personnellement et pour sortir des lettres, je n'ai vu *Citizen Kane* qu'il y a quelques mois à peine. Mais même sans ça, je connaissais le ""Rosebud"", Xanadu, la structure temporelle du film, etc. dont les influences sont réelles dans le septième art, et cela me permettait alors d'enrichir ma lecture des films postérieurs. Même chose pour *Casablanca*, etc.
En Littérature, je n'ai jamais lu *Mody Dick*. Mais je connais l'incipit. Je connais l'histoire. Je connais la fin. De là, je serai apte à saisir les références futures.

Aussi, ma position ici est la suivante : il est toujours intéressant de se plonger dans les ""classiques"", ne serait-ce car on n'est jamais à l'abri d'une bonne surprise. Mais si cela n'accroche pas, autant ne pas insister, aller sur *Wikipedia* pour lire un résumé, voir quelques citations connues. Pour la culture générale, c'est toujours agréable.

Et puis, n'est-il pas plus intéressant de se construire son ""propre"" panthéon classique que l'on prendra plaisir à défendre et à partager, à critiquer, que de ressasser les vieilles marottes de Lagarde et Michard ?

One infantryman observes that 'it is only common courtesy not to interrupt each other’s meals with intermittent missiles of hate', while on occasion game was shot in no-man's-land and retrieved with complete confidence in daylight’

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt; Right, because a huge part of Ireland's economy is only based there due to the low corporate tax rate. If they put it up, the Googles and other companies would leave, and they'd have less money. Tax isn't some magic thing that you can endlessly raise and bring in more money.

I'll leave that argument for another time, but regardless of the good or bad reasons: the burden falls disproportionally on the citizens.

&gt;Actually, every cut in social services will reduce tax income from the first dollar. But the reduction in revenue is smaller than the reduction in saving. In economics speak, the multiplier is less than one. If it were different, you could endlessly raise government spending and bring in more money.

Obviously the government budget isn't going to be able to tax its own expenses as a perpetuum mobile. The point is that social spending ensures local economic activity which will employ and benefit far more people than the relief it gives to the immediate recipients. This is not the case with a lower corporate tax rate or even a lower income tax rate, for example.

&gt; However, we weren't talking about who's hurting

I was. How else are we going to evaluate its effects?

&gt;but that doesn't change the fact that if you're spending beyond your means, you can't not address spending in resolving that. This is a cold, hard economic truth that class warriors don't want to recognise.

Were they spending beyond their means? That's the question. Most governments in the Eurozone wouldn't have had troubles if there weren't hit by a double misfortune of interest hikes and raising unemployment. And *that* wouldn't have happened if the ECB had done from the start what every central bank should do: back up its associated government when necessary. The sovereign debt crisis stopped instantly when it was announced by Draghi that they would do ""anything necessary"". So the ""live within your means"" idea, applied dogmatically, is what caused the trouble, not the other way around. It's the problem, not the solution.

You see, the state is not a grocery: it has much more leverage versus its creditors; and when it *does* cut costs those don't disappear, but turn up elsewhere on their expenses table or reduce income: unlike a grocery, they can't shove off their losses on their employees while continuing to take in money from their customers, because those are mostly the same. That's what neoliberal preachers don't want to hear.

There's a grid of subways covering Paris and a subway is never very far away, say ten to fifteen minutes walking distance maximum.  When you arrive, go to a tourist information center and get a free map and pamphlets on whatever you want to visit.  At the subway, ask for a subway map.  It tells you all the zones.  You can also check http://www.ratp.fr .

When you take the subway, pay attention to the direction of the train.  A subway line goes in two directions, make sure you're going the right way.  The direction is indicated by the last station on the line.

You can also walk to many places in Paris, especially in central Paris.  For example, I've walked from St. Michael to the Arc de Triumph with friends visiting Paris, checking out various sites along the way.  It might take a couple of hours, but if you're used to walking, no problem.  If you're a big walker, you could mostly avoid the subway and just buy a few individual tickets or a package of ten.

No, the only issue is having a strong alliance with America. It's just the EU has inherited de Gaulle's prejudice and perennial antagonism to ""les Anglo-Saxons"".

Turkey is seeking a closer relationship with Iraqi Kurdistan as a means of expanding its regional influence. The Shiite dominated government in Iraq has always been too close to Iran for Turkey, but infinitely more so since the beginning of the Syrian civil war. Iranian intervention in the ISIS crisis only increases Iraq's dependence on Iran.

By aligning itself with Iraqi Kurdistan Turkey can increase its influence over oil rich Northern Iraq and perhaps the central government in Baghdad as well. The Kurds themselves need an important regional ally to resist Baghdad's attempts at centralising political power and reducing the power of the Kurdish Regional Government.

Also, recently there has been an upsurge in PKK attacks allegedly backed by Iran and Syria. It benefits Turkey to have the Iraqi Kurds cooperation against the PKK, if not they might even support the PKK instead. The PKK is ideologically opposed to the government in Kurdistan so the Iraqi Kurds have no qualms about throwing them under the bus to further their own power.",0,1403961306,null,0,false,0,cija3hx,t3_29bal9,t1_cija3hx,t1_cij9fug,null,1434442839,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

The domestic price hasn't risen actually. They took the hit and moved on. That said you can't get so many nice phones free on contract anymore but that never bothered me anyway as I will stay with the same phone until it dies.  

Of course we have people from outside the EU working here; they all need visas and permits to work here and need to be considerably more skilled than average in order to get such a permit, while until the Brexit the British enjoy the same rights as German citizens to work.   
I have no issue with the British, they seem to be friendly people and our cultures are really not so different. Same love of a good beer, for example.  

The problem is that permits cost time and money. I wonder how many will find themselves replaced by people from within the EU if there is a Brexit.  

Federalisation will be a complex process, if it ever happens completely at all, but I think that it will be your people that suffer a lot more than anyone else as a result of an exit, regardless of what else happens.  

We have our tool that will lead to a Brexit in place, we call her ""die Angie"" and she seems to be doing a pretty good job at leading the rest of Europe. I would rather the UK sided with the EU and took an active role in being a part of Europe, but lets be real, thats never going to happen, particularly with the rise of UKIP, which seems to have a bit of a cult of personality going on for Nigel Farage (who is doing well at keeping his German wife out of the picture). There are other countries I would much rather see removed from the union. Ones that in leaving would stabilise our currency and economy, even though we are out of recession (and were so faster than the UK, for that matter).  

A political, economic and trade union between nations like the UK, France, Germany etc would be unstoppable. Our cultures are not so different, our people are not so different, and our economies are also very similar. Sadly the British foreign policy of ""divide and conquer"" still hangs on long after the end of the Empire.   

I just hope Farage gives the British what they want, as what they want clearly isnt a stronger Europe.

In the event of a Brexit, there will be a question about what happens to Brits in the EU and Europeans in Britain, but I personally don't see why there would be a problem.

I am cool with Brits not having the same rights as Germans, just as I am fine with Brits not having the same rights as Canadians.

Our people really won't suffer if you federalise. The UK is still a big player, with a large economy, a big military, huge soft power and a long tradition of diplomacy around the world.

There's something future generations won't be able to do if UKIP get their way. Wouldn't want people having too many opportunities. /s  

Why would you want your people to have *less* rights? That is absolutely crazy and the sort of propaganda that hate-filled rags such as the Daily Mail is inserting into people's brains.  

Aside from Financial services for the EU, what does the UK provide the world with exactly? Frankfurt is quite a capable city nowadays, with the ECB based there, as is Luxembourg. As for your oil, we are moving away from fossil fuels, and Russia is the major supplier anyway. As for other industries, there is plenty of prime land for industry in northern Germany and the netherlands with people that offer the same quality of work, without dealing with the new trade barriers. You say that there won't be any but we are the ones holding the more powerful cards here.  

Sure the Swiss do well without the EU, but they have a reputation for banking in a way that other countries can't or won't do. ""Just a number, no names"" as it were. I can't see the Swiss letting that take over happen.  

Angie doesn't have a cult. She is a strong leader who made her way to the top by actions. To read some of your newspapers, Nigel Farage is the reincarnation of Christ. Even *Bild* doesn't go that far.  

The UK can be a friendly neighbour in the way that neighbours are friendly in cities like London; snubbed ignored for the most part.  

I find it interesting that he would like to deny rights to people who are exactly the same as his wife. I know people who have married non-EU citizens in the UK and been told that the partner cannot actually get a work permit or visa due to financial requirements.  
How would Nigel feel if he had been told that his wife was not welcome and he would have to move to Germany, except that he couldn't because he didn't fit visa requirements.

&gt; I think they're both undemocratic - you can't have democratic legitimacy when no-one knows who you are.

Yes, the process does needs changing: no direct elections, the relative brevity of the campaign, the lack of media coverage, they're all factors. Not to say it's solely a top-down issue, people are increasingly disengaged with politics but there's no panacea. 

&gt; And the laws go far beyond what's necessary for a trading bloc. NAFTA, ASEAN etc don't need half of this stuff. 

Trading bloc, yes, but that's different from a single market, it's a lot more pervasive by definition. I also disagree in part with the regulatory fervor, but that should be an issue addressed at the EU level, and not be used as an argument to shoot the whole thing down. 

&gt; The occasional issue like climate change and tax evasion can be done by international agreements - it's not like the EU is big enough to handle them alone anyway. 

It's well documented that part of the reason why climate talks are failing is because of the ability of national interests to just block the process. Can it be done theoretically? Yes. But in reality in a supranational setting it's a lot more efficient by actually forcing people to come to a consensus, and there less of a risk of people free-riding on their obligations.

Here's my final point. Identities, based on tradition, language, etc., are interchangeable, multi-layered. In the same vein, how do you define sovereignty? That's changeable as well (think of Scotland). A lot of the anti-EU parties in the European Parliament talk about national sovereignty, but people from the Lega Nord are talking about sovereignty for their own little area. Should we entertain this continuous exercise in cultural division?

I don't want people to have fewer rights within their own country. But having rights in a different country is a completely different thing. Presumably you are happy that Germans don't have the same rights as Canadians? Well, in the same way I am happy that Brits won't have the same rights as Germans.

I'm assuming you don't work in finance? Frankfurt is a home to local finance, but London is a home to global finance. Deutschebank is bigger in london than it is in Germany. As for what else the UK does, the UK does well with other professional services, also creative industries (music, computer games etc) also some manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, high-end engineering. But finance is where we excell!

It seems like you want trade barriers with the UK to punish us for leaving the EU. I find it odd that you seem happy to trade with Russia, which has just annexed Crimea, but want to put up barriers to trade with the UK. I suppose for you leaving the EU is a greater sin than annexing Crimea?Also, you really aren't holding all the cards. The UK imports much more from the EU than it exports. Do you think Ireland would agree to trade barriers with the UK? Ireland's economy would be devastated.

Actually, Our newspapers have been extremely critical of Farage. Perhaps show me the article you are thinking about that was cult-like? However, people like me who want a Brexit do think that Farage is a principled politician.

Also, Farage isn't saying that people shouldn't be able to marry people from overseas. I know many many people in the UK from outside the EU who work in the UK easily. There is no need for this to change when we leave the EU. :-) married people can always come to the UK if their spouses are British. 

Also, I find it odd (and somewhat offensive that you need to start talking about empire. Not wanting to be part of the EU is nothing to do with an empire ideology and I find it strange that you would want to even mention this (other than deliberately trying to offend me).

&gt; Whether any of this benefits an individual company or person depends on whether you're a producer or consumer of the goods affected, how much it costs you to produce them (or how much you're prepared to pay to consume them), and whether you are in country A, country B, or a third country.

Increased competition is good for everyone in the long term. Lowers prices for consumers, makes companies work harder and more efficiently, seeking out new technologies and markets. I dont know why you think it can be good or bad, competition only seems to be a benefit to me. After all that is the whole point of capitalism.

&gt; So, it's possible for some of the producers in country A and country B to gang together against the consumers, and against existing and potential producers, and lobby for laws to screw everyone else over.

If you're on the Russian side you'll notice that,

*  Yanukovych was on its way to establish a deal with Russia and pushing for a 3 way agreement with the EU when the protests started. 

* The protests were not representative of the whole population, and somewhat unsurprising, since Yanukovych had about 50% support in the elections. 

* The western media glorified the protests, from the very beginning.

* There were indeed far right members joining the protests, in particular Right Sector and Svoboda. 

* The protests continued even after Yanukovych proposed early elections. 

* Yanukovych was deposed illegally since the constitutional process was not followed. 

* The new parliament composition became very different from that voted by the population. 

* The far right part Svoboda became more influential in the new (supposedly interim) government. 

* Less than two years before the EU Parliament was calling Svoboda racist and xenophobic and calling for no government coalitions involving this party. 

* That leaked calls did indeed point to involvement from Ukrainian far right in shootings, and that the later denials don't mean much, nor do they address much of what was said.

* The general prosecutor, who conducts investigations on what happened during demonstrations is from Svoboda. 

* These events could be considered a coup, and therefore sensible to not recognise Kyiv's government as legitimate. 

* The first government actions were indeed attempts to pass legislation 'attacking' ethnic Russians. 

* The eastern regions could well become unstable since they are far from being pro-EU and this process was not democratic. 

* Russian couldn't afford to take chances of Crimea becoming unstable, much like Donetsk and Lugansk did, and that together with its governor's call for help ligitimised their invasion. 

* Most media ignored the civilian deaths caused by the attacks from Kiev to Lugansk, as well as Kiev's excuses and latter confirmation by the OSCE. Deaths they'd be circlejerking had they been caused by the Russian side at some point during this process.

The presumption is made by many of the people that have responded to my initial comment. No I haven't read the legislation document explicitly. Yes I do know what it covers, because I have read numerous summaries, articles, implications etc. of it (it is after all one of the most infamous pieces of EU legislation).

&gt; First Not True Scotman and now worst strawman I've seen in weeks.

Congratulations, you've picked up strawman, the classic Reddit counter, and used No True Scotsman, the current in fashion response. Accuse me of salami tactics now, the early 2014 in vogue comeback.

Oddly though, I don't think you've used either of these terms correctly. Please, for my own benefit, explain your assertions. The Scotsman accusation fails because I haven't proposed something unreasonable. It is very possible to have a more than adequate knowledge of legislation without reading the entire legislative document. My discussion about the implications and interpretations of the legislation are also very reasonable. The use of Class I, II etc. is a good idea. Procurement should be made easier. Some of the clauses, i.e. those relating to vegetable straightness, are worth revisiting. Indeed, attempted retractions of the legislation have done exactly that. The legislation's inability to tackle consumer demands for pretty food is also reasonable (attempted retractions of the legislation conceded exactly this). To say the legislation cannot change consumer demands is also very reasonable. That's not the legislation's fault though, its a psychological flaw that we perceive ""prettier"" vegetables to taste better.

The strawman fails because I haven't misrepresented anything. My discussion focused on the legislation's inability to alter consumer demands for pretty food (a wholly different issue). I actually credited the legislation's use of Class I, II etc. for making procurement easier. You've yet to counter against either of those.

&gt; Since this discussion is clearly going nowhere.

Then critique or agree with my opinions of the legislation and its impact. You surely cannot agree with it though, because in doing so you'd be proving my assertions about being able to have knowledge without reading the exact legislation to be very true.",0,1403966853,null,0,false,0,cijbluj,t3_29b1xn,t1_cijbluj,t1_cijbbub,null,1434443659,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

Considering the Conservative Party line, I would say that it would be a reform following the line of thought of *That government is best which governs least* applied more vigorously than at national level. In other words while they recognise areas where the EU is helpful, if a national government can do it then the EU has no business doing it or interfering in the process. 

Another point to keep in mind is the *process of reform*. While there is increasing consensus for delegating EU reform capability away from nation states and the Commission and towards the European Parliament to address the perceived *democratic deficit*, hence why some EP Groups presented Commission President candidates, the British Conservatives on the other hand firmly think that the EU should only be reformed as national governments see fit.

true,erythrocytes64,RUSS,Russia,"I feel the main reason is the mentality of Russian ""masses"". Predominance of lower class and Soviet ideology dumbed down people to some medieval crowd. 

Also, it's hard to believe when you live in a developed country, but Russia isn't like most of Europe. All media except one or two relatively small radio stations and newspapers is state-owned. As a result, the ruling party controls everything people will think, and since most of them were brainwashed pretty hard before, it's not that hard of a job. (I'm not even making it up, I live in Moscow, and just yesterday I saw some old fart on the bus tell his very important opinion on how Gorby ruined everything and how compared to him and Yeltsin, Putin ""put the country together"". Every week or two, wherever I go, people start speaking about politics like they weren't told it's not really appropriate and nice, and this word diarrhoea is always the same).

You may ask, ""What the hell? They have elections, why not vote for some other party"". If two points above didn't seem like a big problem, here is the thing: the closest competitor to the ruling party is… the commies. Next comes Russian liberal-democrat party, its leader being something in between Johnny Rotten and Nikita Khrushchev, with constant epatage attempts and questionable comments on politics. And only then comes some normal man a European wouldn't be ashamed to look at. He didn't get to participate in the last presidential elections. You see, he needed to collect enough signatures, and he did, but it was ruled out that it wasn't acceptable since some of them were in electronic format. Oh well, we kind of knew who was going to be elected anyway.

true,happybadger,EURO,European Union,"&gt; The most insane brutality the world had ever seen coupled with enough organization that you could swap christmas presents.

The technology/infrastructure and the people were operating on two different levels. You're talking about a generation that grew up on art nouveau, one of the firsts that had an actual childhood and adolescence and one for whom everything was optimism without even the sky as a limit. 

The leadership cut their teeth on the Franco-Prussian War and their only exposure to industrialised combat was via books on either the American Civil War (still very Napoleonic with crude automatic weapons) or Russo-Japanese war (a fringe conflict between a backward dying empire stuck in the last century and a new one with military surplus). They were still gentlemen warriors who considered it a grand game of chess, which apart from the carnage war really was in the era that they grew up in.

Tremendous advances were made in weaponry and the ability to use it but they lacked either doctrine built around those weapons or legislation governing their usage. Things like aerial bombing were totally unregulated, while chemical warfare was brought up at the Hague Conference a decade prior but only concerning asphyxiating gas (as opposed to chemical irritants like mustard and chlorine). 

The opening moves of the war were highly choreographed down to the day. [Germany's Schlieffen Plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieffen_Plan) was a marvel of military precision but required a precise series of events to pull off and didn't anticipate the human response to itself because popular perception wasn't a high priority back then. Armies prior to the modern era were orders of magnitude smaller (Napoleon's Grand Armee for example was 1/17th the size of France's World War 1 army at 500k and 8.6m respectively) than their 20th century counterparts because logistical systems were crude and industrial output couldn't support millions of soldiers. Nobody really knew what would happen if the Schlieffen Plan developed a wrench in its cogs because nobody could anticipate the role propaganda would play in whipping up patriotic fervor. Entire towns went off to fight.

By World War 2 we had a grasp on things like squad warfare and precision munitions. We could counter a machine gun because we split into fireteams and we could avoid trying to brute force most positions because much of the continent had been plotted for artillery in the interwar prior and there were air corps which were accurate enough in combat conditions to at least hit within a reasonable distance of the target (though again a lack of legislation on the matter proved disastrous). 

World War 1 though? Machine guns were developed with the mindset of giving a few men the force projection of a few hundred men. Cavalry had no problem running down entire regiments, while those regiments stood in front of other regiments and fired in volley before charging during their enemy's reload period. Those foundational ideas about the mechanics of warfare weren't augmented because there was little or no real-world experience. We learned in a trial by fire to put line regiments in trenches, to layer those trenches, to ward off enemy attacks through passive defenses, and to use artillery in advanced suppression techniques with computed and networked barrages. 

That technological and tactical ignorance coupled with systemic weaknesses and the emerging powers of media and assembly line industry provided the war with an endless well of brutality and boots to perpetrate it. The soldiers themselves, raised in a new post-imperial era with international cooperation and a consumer class and recreational travel and ready-access to art and literature, were still Edwardian children at heart with Victorian ideals about the nature of war.

""Er hat mir die Wahl überlassen"" = ""He allowed me to choose"". (Implied: Even though he he could have made the decision for me.) Still, most people would probably say ""Er hat mir die Wahl gelassen"", and ""*Ich überlasse Dir die Wahl"" still wouldn't work, IMHO.

Now for some uneducated guesses by a native speaker:

As far as I can fathom it, ""jemandem etwas überlassen"" usually implies that one of the parties is performing a charitable or friendly act towards the other one:

""Das Aufräumen kannst Du mir überlassen."" = ""You can leave the clean-up to me."" (Implied: And do something nicer instead.)
""Ich überlasse Dir mein altes Auto."" = ""I'll give my old car to you."" (Usually implied: As a gift.)

As we know, ""You leave me no choice"" does not normally mean that someone else does all the choosing for you, rather it's synonymous to ""your actions force me to do this"" – so there's no friendliness or charity involved, which makes ""überlassen"" a poor fit.

There are clearly problems with the EU, but Cameron has been harping on about reform without even hinting in a direction of which serious, workable reforms need to be done. I wouldn't call his list a few weeks back ""serious"" or ""workable"", more like a pipe dream. 

The EU as a whole is not as pressing in needing reform as the Eurozone is. As long as the Eurozone exists, there will be a 2-tier EU and we need to treat it as such.

Big reply ahead. TL;DR: be wary of changing ISP, you might just end up with a worse situation than now.

There are two different kind of ADSL infrastructure, ATM &amp; ETH. ATM is the old one, and they sell only ""up to 7mbps"" connections on it. ETH is the new one, which is used for 10mpbs and 20mbps connections (and newly activated 7mbps).

If you can only get the 7mpbs (check for the 10mbps called ""SuperInternet"", sometimes it available when the 20mbps is not), then you can't do much. You're reached only by ATM, and usually ATM centrals are saturated.

As for changing ISP, you should know that there are two ways an ISP can sell you a service, called ""Wholesale"" and ""ULL"". In ""Wholesale"", the ISP is simply renting everything from Telecom Italia and reselling it to you. ISP usually don't buy enough bandwidth from TI, so you would end up with an even worse connection (bandwidth starved + ATM problems). This is profitable because TI is forced to sell bandwidth/access for cheap to other ISPs, and also because overselling.

If instead an ISP supports you in ULL, then it means that the ISP has it's own hardware in the central. Most of the infrastructure is still owned by TI, but the bandwidth problem is eliminated. In that case, if you're lucky (read this as ""that ISP is serving you under ETH"" or ""Less people in your zone use that ISP"") you'll end up with a better service.

As for the ISP, first: avoid Vodafone and Tele2/TeleTu. They're 100% crap, only resell and shit in general. They also do P2P throttling.

Other ISP to consider are: Fastweb, Infostrada and Tiscali.

For Fastweb, go [here](http://avt.fastweb.it/avt-operatori/AvtHome?SELLER_CODE=SME_VEND&amp;canale=AGENZIE) (refresh the page when you get an error) and put your address. If it says ""Tecnologia Wholesale"", then you're under Wholesale and I wouldn't suggest going with them. If it instead says ""Tecnologia Fastweb"", then you're under ULL.

For infostrada, go on [their site](http://www.infostrada.it/it/adsl/absolute_adsl.phtml) and put your address. If it offers you ""up to 20mbps"", then you're covered in ULL. If instead it offers you ""up to 7mbps"", it's wholesale.

It's the same for Tiscali ([link](http://casa.tiscali.it/?WT.mc_id=01hp0709_04)), up to 20mbps = ULL, up to 7mbps = Wholesale.

As a side note, consider that usually TI is the best you can get, and they also have the better support.",0,1403971843,null,0,false,0,cijdajt,t3_29bitm,t1_cijdajt,t3_29bitm,null,1434444700,7,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,7

For 3, what I think will happen is the UK achieves one or two ""special benefits"". These will be accepted and the 2017 referendum will keep the UK in the EU.

Hmm, powers already flow from as well as towards Brussels, depending on circumstances, according to the [subsidiarity principle](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/glossary/subsidiarity_en.htm), which was enshrined in Art. 5 of the Treaty of Lisbon.

&gt; • National parliaments able to work together to block unwanted European legislation.

They already can, through their governments' representatives in the Council.

&gt; • Businesses liberated from red tape and benefiting from the strength of the EU's own market to open up greater free trade with North America and Asia.

Hmm, isn't this what the Single Market is all about, already? As for EU red tape, there's already a long-running [simplification programme](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/glossary/legislation_simplification_en.htm).

&gt; • UK police forces and justice systems able to protect British citizens, unencumbered by unnecessary interference from the European institutions, including the European court of human rights.

Except that, apart from the difficult issue of who will protect British citizens from UK police forces and justice systems (it isn't as if there had never been any case of police and judicial abuse, even in recent history), the ECHR is **not** a EU institution, as Cameron should know.

&gt; • Ensuring Britain is no longer subject to the concept of ""ever closer union"", enshrined in the treaty signed by every EU country.

&gt; -We will emancipate ourselves from Lisbon Treaty which has brought about austerity
and taken sovereignty away from the people. The Lisbon Treaty contains all previous
treaties and concentrates in itself all the dead ends of contemporary capitalism. It
demands free and fair competition at the expense of social rights won by the democratic
workers’ struggles of the last century.
It promotes free trade at the expense of the environment and social justice. It maintains
the authoritarian drift of the European Union by concentrating power in the hands of
unelected institutions. It is necessary to overcome the Treaty of Lisbon so as to deal
with the social emergency, to fight ecological disaster, to solve the democratic crisis and
to build another Europe.
&gt; -Authority must reside with elected assemblies on the national and European levels.
&gt; -Budgetary power must be given to the national parliaments. They should also be able
to control and participate in EU decision-making.
&gt; -Strengthen the powers of the European Parliament and national parliaments against the
European Commission. We question the monopoly of legislative initiative in Brussels.

The Greens have [similar] (http://europeangreens.eu/sites/europeangreens.eu/files/2014%20Manifesto.pdf) policies on this, but more extensive EU-wide policy in others.
&gt;To get a broader and more open debate it is necessary
that the national parliaments take more responsibility by
imposing better control over their governments’ actions in
European affairs. We also want to strengthen the national
parliaments’ opportunities to react when the EU exceeds
its authority by not following the rules on subsidiarity.
National parliaments should also have more avenues of
cooperation with the European Parliament. At all levels of
governance, from the local to the regional, the national to
the European, we call for strengthened interactions and
synergies in order to better articulate European policies and
their implementation within regional and territorial realities.",0,1403973588,null,0,1403973898,0,cijdy99,t3_298sc7,t1_cijdy99,t1_ciixkrn,null,1434445226,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

The Latvian law states that if a name can be declined as a noun then it has to show clearly whether it is a female or male name. As opposed to names like Otto which is not declinable but that is also fine. 

There was a case last year when Russian parents wanted to name their child who was born in Latvia *Miron* *(Мирон)*, yet it had to be distinguished as a male name thus an -s would have to be added. All fine, right? Only the word *mironis* means ""a corpse"" in Latvian. 

The parents were allowed to put the name Mirons as his official name, as it was in line with the law, but they wouldn't because of the similarity with the word for corpse.

Point being. Everybody has the chance to read and figure out laws, and select a name that works just fine according to the law. Don't make life complicated for yourself and especially for your kid.

An average emigrant is someone who worked in Poland for a very low wage (&lt;€750), doing some low-skill job. Someone not especially intelligent, entrepreneurial nor creative. Not a career criminal, but someone not above stealing something here and there. Their ideal life consists of good wage for simple work and beer every day after it.  
In other words, a working class drone.  

These people are the very ones that are going to be made redundant due to technological unemployment, but when that happens, they will be (mainly) British citizens and not Poland's problem. At the same time, the removal of them from nation's stock is every eugenicists' dream.  

It's due to emigration that Poland is [the safest country in Europe](http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/safety/#/34111512353) (also due to relative lack of immigration).  

It's also true that there's a slight brain drain. There's not much work in high-tech capital intensive sectors. However, lack of emigration wouldn't fix that, and skilled bio-genetists and similar working below their qualification in the country benefit nobody. Some of these people will come back with experience and capital and start companies here.  

If you're not a working class loser or someone in a niche high-tech capital intensive sector, emigration from Poland doesn't make much sense. With rents about 8x times smaller than those in London (which seems to be favorite emigration place) and other prices (food, services) about 2x-4x smaller, just €1000 net a month is enough for a comfortable life (which doesn't include eating in restaurants every day), with much higher incomes not hard to achieve.

it's obvious they won't destroy a bus just because someone reported it. it's no rocket science. your further metaphore about young people vs. older people is just making things up in this context. and I'm not saying that is not a problem in Poland. but it's not present in this add. and I find it really disturbing that you are so keen to put there a problem that's not there while you claim you don't get ""the main point"" from the video.  
suddenly you're so perceptive you can see all the additional meanings, that may or may not be there, but fail to see the single main point? someone that observant should have no problem with understanding this add and remembering the adress. unless they have a hidden agenda, that is. and see it just fine but bash just for the sake of it.  
so are you one of those who left Poland and now all they're interested in is saying how everything is wrong, bad and of ill intention here? because honestly, the fact that you seem to think it's racism and old people that's the subject of this conversation certainly makes it look like this.

**ad 4.** you see racism in a campaign about safe travelling. because some cartoon vehicle is *white*. it is absolutely ridiculous. when you see dark filthy bathtube and squeaky clean one in an add of some cleaning products you see racism there too? or dirty dishes vs. clean ones? or laundry? it's all white, light, clean, shiny vs. black, dark, dirty, evil. look at Disney's villains! that's just simplification every add does so that it would be obvious. again you say it's not simple enough and then you don't like things that make it simple. and that's not saying there's no racism in Poland, I know there is, I have an Asian in the family so almost first hand experience. here, my [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/28sd2g/polish_foreign_minister_caught_on_tape_saying/ciea7yc?context=3) from a few days earlier. and that's exactly the case here, too.

&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong but does anyone check the buses numbers when it pulls into the bus stop with the children?

and since when such small kids travel by themselves? since when coaches that takes kids for summer vacation stop at bus stops? it's not about a regular bus in the city. it's about bus that will take your kid from the Tatras to the Baltic and back. this add's main point is to catch your attention. and at the end when you finally get to know what this is all about it an *aha!* moment.  
I don't think there's a parent with school age kid in this country that didn't see/hear that unsafe coaches are a thing. doesn't matter old or new. opening a page and entering a number is so easy and quick that most people will check even brand new bus just for the sake of it.
  
promoting tolerance and equality is not this add's job. there are separate ones for those purposes. and if you actually tried to put it all in one add, and pull it off, it'd fail miserably. no one would probably understand. you can't have it all at once. 
 
I think this add is perfect for it's target group, context and enviroment. I linked you my explanation earlier.

and à propos older people in hospitals in Poland. I have grandparents in their late eighties, for the past few years they've been in hospitals on and off. I live in a big city so we already had to do with five. for all this time and people we've met, only once happened an incident that the care they recived wasn't as good as it should be. and that was not this hospital's thing, just one neglecting nurse. once in a approx. five years of being in hospital every few weeks. it's not nearly as bad as it is portrayed. and we're not some kinds of VIPs or rich. we're normal people. 

as an afterthought, if you want something racist about this add, I'd go for all the kids at the bus stop being white. that would be racist in most places in the world, but it Poland it's really not because, let's face it, 99% actually are white. white bus is just a white bus. people usually don't think about racism while looking at a vehicle.

you don't have to answer me, I'm also not looking forward to reading/writing any more ""novels"", I'd just like to know that you read it. I think I put everything as clearly as possible here. if you still think it's about race and age then keep that thought and have a nice day. we will have to agree to disagree. just acknowledge the fact that ""race and age"" that you see there don't make it a bad add. it's bad only if you really don't understand the main point, which I think is not the case here. cheers.",0,1403978363,null,0,1403978549,0,cijfsts,t3_292u7x,t1_cijfsts,t1_ciiol89,null,1434446272,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Yes, because language *is* culture? How, exactly, is this statement wrong?

If I'm in a position where, knowing Spanish alone, I have a window into what people from over 20 countries think and say when they speak candidly in their own language, does that not give me a wider world-view than someone who cannot? And put me in a position where I can say conclusively that *Americans do not have a monopoly on ignorance*? Which is the extent of what I've been trying to claim when I said that I have an insight into different cultures.

A lot of people on /r/Europe use their interactions with American redditors to make overarching conclusions about American culture. How is what I'm doing any worse?

&gt;You then go on the explain that the people you interact with aren't typical Japanese. Hmm.

That was supposed to explain to you that the kind of internationally-minded Japanese people who would post in /r/Japan would not be racist and do not deserved to be stamped with your own shitty stereotypes.

&gt;Or, y'know, I can tell you that I live in Asia, meet and work with Japanese regularly, and the majority are, er, 'well-intentioned' racists.

I doubt you're in any position to tell if you can't actually speak their language.

&gt;Also, the /r/ in front of /r/Japan[1] was added in order to not confuse other readers who may have thought when reading my go back to that you actually were Japanese, and not a simply a deluded weeaboo

Yeah, which is why you implied that the subreddit would be racist, right? I'm sure this is not something you just thought of as a snarky afterthought now that I informed you that /r/Japan doesn't have actual Japanese people. Just admit that you were ignorant about that and move on. It's pathetic.

&gt;Also, deleting comments you're getting downvoted on is about the most pathetic thing you can do. Do you care that much?

Next you study the Carlist wars, and the beginnings of the independentists movements (usually misrepresented either in one direction or the other) and the loss of Cuba, Philippines and Puerto Rico.

Both yes and no. Culturally, they are fascinated with American culture and have absorbed large swaths of it. Their famous ""Salaryman"" business culture which dominates much of life was orignially an American import. However, when it comes to absorbing actual foreigners they have abstained and are usually hostile to immigrants, even assimilated ones. This, combined with their incredibely low birthrate is causing a Japanese demographic collapse. If they wish to remain relevant, then they will have to drop the xenophobic trait in their culture and accept immigration. Natural selection strikes again.

&gt;the Saudi's want to keep their place Saudi

Fixed: The Saudi government wants to keep their place Saudi. We will not know what the Saudi people's will is until they have overthrown their regime and institute a democratic republic. If they wish to remain isolated, then they will meet with success in that as long as they have oil (about a century, at this pace). Once that artificial prop is gone, then their uncompetitive economy will collapse and they will become prey for diversified powers.

&gt; I can still enjoy the joys of Arab culture without Arab culture being on my doorstep

I have read that sentence multiple times but I still cannot make sense of it. ""I can enjoy something without having access to that something."" Wat. Arab culture is not an all-or-nothing thing. It is a collection of cultural traits that we have given a short hand. There are some traits of Arab culture, or most other major cultures for that matter, everywhere. Even if that trait is simply a kabob or their famous hospitality. Eating a shwarma does not mean that one has to wear a burqa. The People pick and choose amongst the traits and choose the traits that are beneficial on a personal level.

Read that again. Read the definition of racism. You can't dismiss a complete country because most people affiliate with Islam (and not like any other islamic country, Turkey is more modern than Poland, which is already inside the EU). 

The only valid reason I heard against Turkey inside the European Union is because it's a big country. A poor big country. That is an argument. The rest all comes down to Islamophobic, *I don't like brown people* arguments.

&gt; It is clear to me though that most Muslims take religious law more seriously than most Christians do.

Both religions go in graduations. A catholic from N-Ireland, is not the same as a catholic from Belgium. A protestant from a big city isn't the same as one that comes from the country-side, and even amongst those you have a lot of differences. The same is true for Islamic countries. A muslim from Istanbul, or Ankara, is way more relaxed, generally speaking, than some christian voting for Le Pen. 

We do have problems with muslims in Europe (not all, but some very vocal minority). What those trouble-makers have in common is that they are living in lower socio-economic classes, or they're first generation immigrants, who are mostly economic refugees. 

&gt; It's difficult to find a Christian arguing for implementing the rules in Leviticus and harder still for one arguing those are more important than secular laws. 

You must be kidding. Every religion thinks their morality, and rules are above the laws, because they are superior (the set of rules they abide to). It's why they restricted abortion in Spain, for example.

true,TheMadFleming,FLAN,Flanders,"&gt;In Flanders we are taught that this battle was a turning point in Medieval warfare, as it was the first ever battle where an army of exclusively footmen defeated a mounted army. We are taught that the tale of this battle inspired revolutions throughout Europe, most notably the Scottish revolution three years later.

I didn't. In fact I learned nothing about the medieval low countries, which is sad as it's pretty interesting. This probably varies heavily from teacher to teacher. I only remember my teacher for Dutch saying something like ""yeah we defeated the French because we got lucky and 2 years later they returned and kicked our asses"". Which is wrong.

Both sides are guilty of portraying the battle in the wrong way. Flemish nationalists usually praise it into heaven and Belgian nationalists mostly try to downplay it. 

It's just a medieval battle but pretty important in that a different outcome so early on in the history of the low countries could have changed everything in the region. 

The county of Flanders had been made possession of the French crown in 1300 and its count got imprisoned (pretty big deal). The count wasn't really that popular as he opposed the power of the cities. They hoped that the French would bring better leadership but when the appointed governor of the County, Jacques de Châtillon, started raising new taxes the guilds got angry. This resulted in the killing of every French speaker who couldn't pronounce ""s'gildensvriend"" (friend of the guilds) at Bruges.

Then the guilds and common people made sort of an alliance with Flemish nobles still supporting the count including 2 sons of the count and they marched to Courtrai with an army of mainly city militia armed with pikes, goedendags (or spiked staves as they're called in Mount &amp; Blade) and probably other cheap weaponry to meet the French army. Where the French learned the lesson that if you charge head-on in a wall of pointy things that doesn't break, that you might in fact die. Funny thing is they recalled their 5000 strong infantry so the nobles cavalry could claim their ""glory"". 

Result was 1000 dead, mostly nobles, including the Chief Advisor to the French king, Pierre de Flotte, and the most skilled French commander, Robert II of Artois. Also Flanders became de facto independent for 2 years until [the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mons-en-P%C3%A9v%C3%A8le), which didn't really have any winners, and then became a county again under the French crown (not a possession to the crown as before) which made sure it could be inherited by the Burgundians 80 years later who laid the foundations for the Netherlands and thus also indirectly for Belgium.",0,1403984731,null,0,1403984947,0,ciji9wr,t3_29bqql,t1_ciji9wr,t1_cijcil3,null,1435487033,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"I think that the UK benefits from trade with Europe and of course we benefit if Europe is peaceful and prosperous. However, currently Europe is not as prosperous as it should be and this is partly because of the decade of ruin, partly caused  by the euro. As for peace and democracy, the UK is a mature democracy and doesn't really need to be in the EU to stay peaceful with Europe. I can understand why countries in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe think of the EU as their guarantor of peace and stability, but north west Europe feels very different and that is one of the reasons why the idea of the EU is least popular in the UK, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. Many people in these countries think that the EU is going to cause more corruption than their societies would otherwise have. I think Germany and France are in someways a special case: but given the UK's different experience of history it is unsurprising that our attitude to the EU is profoundly different.

I am very pro immigration and it sounds like you are too, but neither of is think there should be no limits. You think there should be limits depending on EU membership, I would use a different method. But ultimately we are the same here. Your system stops Germans being able to marry Algerians, Australians, Argentinians and Angolans. Do you think those relationships should be difficult? You are voting for parties which want their to be limits and visas on those relationships. Is a world government something you want? 

As for your engineering firm considering closing its business in the UK, we were already told this same story when we stayed out of the euro and it turned out not to be true. And, even currently, with all the uncertainty over the UK's membership of the EU, there are more jobs now in the UK than ever before in UK's history. The UK is also currently the fastest growing economy in the g7. So we must be doing something right.

I don't think you should use the expression ""divide and conquer"" to describe the UK's foreign policy towards the eu. Who are we trying to conquer do you think? Who are we trying to divide? I want the UK to come out of the EU, but what you guys do once we're gone is entirely your business. I, like you, believe in globalisation. I have lived all over the world and speak several langUges and work in international finance. I live in the most globalised city in the world. Brexit for me is not about ""splendid isolation"". The UK in my view should have good links with as much of the free, liberal, democratic world as possible.

The good news in the UK is that we no longer have the BNP. They are finished. Ukip are very big, but really, we're not bad guys. We just want to be an independent self-governing nation. Is that really a bad thing? Think of all the people in history who have had similar desires, that you would no doubt have supported.

The euro, for all its problems, has still been tremendously useful.

In 2012, despite the crash, it is $249 billion.  A good deal, all in all, if not a perfect one.

I appreciate all your points, and I agree that the ECB has played a disastrous role here. But the bond-buying scheme has only stopped the immediate market panic. It won't stop the simple basis that these countries were spending more than they were bringing in fiscally. Sooner or later people will stop lending to you, and it's unsustainable to have the ECB endlessly monetise debts - eventually it just ends with an inflation spiral. The only way those budgets can be balanced is by cuts.

When it cuts it does have the Keynesian effect you say, and you're right that the more thoughtless right wingers don't acknowledge that. But it's still inevitable that you need to balance your budget (or close to balance it) at some point. So yes, you'll actually need to cut more than fiscal deficit. That sucks, but that's life.

true,dreugeworst,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; Read that again. Read the definition of racism. You can't dismiss a complete country because most people affiliate with Islam (and not like any other islamic country, Turkey is more modern than Poland, which is already inside the EU).

Oh bullshit. Racism is dismissing individuals solely based on skincolour. According to the Oxford Dictionary:

&gt; The belief that all members of each race possess characteristics, abilities, or qualities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races

This is about culture, not race. That means acknowledging that not all Turks believe the same thing, and that it is not inherent to them as a people, it's learned. However that still leaves a majority of them as believing in Islam and potentially a large amount believing that the rules of Islam can override our secular rules. 

That is a culture that is not compatible with ours. Are you denying that the culture in Turkey is different from here? Or that that culture has a lot to do with Islam? The question is whether their culture is compatible with our belief in the rule of secular laws.

Now, I'm not decided on whether the above is a valid argument to keep Turkey out of the EU, it depends on how many actually believe that Islam is more important than the law, and are willing to act on it. I'm not convinced it's a sizable portion (or larger than our fundies).

But that doesn't mean it's racism. It's acknowledging incompatibe parts of somebodies culture. 

&gt; The rest all comes down to Islamophobic, I don't like brown people arguments.

Disliking Islam is not the same as disliking brown people. If it were a white country displaying the kinds of excesses that some Islamic countries do I would dislike them just the same.

&gt;  A muslim from Istanbul, or Ankara, is way more relaxed, generally speaking, than some christian voting for Le Pen. 

And the question here is what the proportion of people in Turkey are that are extreme like that, and whether it differs significantly from what we have in the EU.

&gt; You must be kidding. Every religion thinks their morality, and rules are above the laws, because they are superior (the set of rules they abide to). It's why they restricted abortion in Spain, for example. 

Oh ffs. There's a bit of a difference between wanting to restrict abortion and wanting capital punishment for apostacy or cutting off a hand for stealing.

&gt; Well, mr MikeRust, doesn't give a why to his dislike of islam. 

And so you say his opposition to islam is wrong because LePen and followers are hypocrites. Seriously, the response doesn't make sense.

true,TheDukeofReddit,UNSA,United States of America,"Maybe.  But Iraqi Kurdistan is fairly stable. Income wise, the GDP per capita is similar in Kurdistan to the Kurdish areas of Turkey.  The Kurdish areas of Turkey face more similar challenges to Kurdistan than the Western parts of Turkey.  The Eastern and Kurdish areas are the poorest and least densely populated parts of Turkey. The governing of Kurdistan is (and largely has been) democratic.  Its not a perfect democracy, but given the state of Iraq at large, they've done fantastic.

With their seizure of Kirkuk and it being inevitable that they hold it, the country has a strong base to grow and prosper assuming its neighbors let it.  Turks are actually immigrating to Kurdistan as it is for work.  I do not think it is out of the question that, 10-20 years from now, Kurdistan looks more appealing on almost every front to the Kurds in Turkey than being a small part of Turkey.  Although, I do think Turkey would be smart to be a friend of Kurdistan. They share more in common than any of Kurdistan's any other neighbors and a strong relationship would be mutually beneficial.  

In some ways, it might actually be *beneficial* to Turkey to let the Kurdish areas join together then develop strong partnerships with them in trade and defense. They would no longer have to expend so many resources to hold the area. It would improve the political situation in Turkey as a whole to have discourse take place in an environment where a large minority really doesn't seem to want to be there. These areas would self-invest, which would free up funds and energy for Turkey to focus on its actual economic cores rather than to better integrate the Kurdish areas with the rest of Turkey. It would also be a strong ally and buffer state to counter-balance other regional powers where their interests would mostly align.

EDIT: Although this almost certainly will not happen.  For whatever reason, the Turkish political class seems enamored with the Ottoman legacy of 'conquest' and tying national pride to the border. They should be proud of their history.  But conquest is truly one of the least of the legacies left by that dead empire.  Take pride in the stability and safety they brought.  The prosperity of the regions for hundreds of years.  The immense scientific and cultural legacies either preserved or developed. The relative tolerance and flexibility it took to bring many cultural and religious groups together for a large period of history that witnessed tremendous change. The daring to call themselves 'Rum', or Rome, because the viewed that as being, rightly, a shared legacy. The role it played in Islam. When Turkey sees countries like China experiencing economic booms or countries like Brazil hosting prestigious events, they should be saying 'why not us?'

true,intangible-tangerine,UKGB,United Kingdom,"There are debates in the UK but they're mainly about whether the UK was right to get involved rather than about why the war started in the first place.  The general consensus, from my experience having read around and studied WWI to some extent, tends to be that the rival powers in Europe were headed for a major confrontation because of things like nationalist movements, competition for overseas colonies etc and that if the Archduke hadn't been assassinated something else would have happened at some point. It was just a catalyst for a chain reaction that was waiting to happen.  

I think most people in the UK would be able to tell you that the Archduke got assassinated and that Germany and Austria-Hungary claimed it as a pretext for war, but they wouldn't be able to go in to much depth about who he was or why the Balkans was so unstable at that time.

 
It's certainly not an issue that raises strong feelings outside of narrow academic circles, where blame is apportioned it's usually to the conflicting ambitions of the Great Powers with the Balkan countries being seen as pawns in that Great Game.

true,SpecsaversGaza,ENGL,England,"Sure, I can't help but feel the EU is the generation of a power bloc similar to 19th/20th century ones. Where folk have typically tired of waving their national flag, often understandably, they choose to wave the EU one and take it as being progressive but it's just a larger, geographically, form of nationalism. There's also an element of neo-imperialism to it, both financially and morally. 

Also there's an unhealthy illusion that the politicians are the ones who still have the true power, which I don't think they do any more. I believe the political classes are typically happy with this so long as they get their new layer of politics. It's more jobs for them. For me it's a replication of government (for me I have town, district, and county councils, the Commons and the Lords) which fails to represent my interests or my compatriots in any meaningful manner. It's a Potemkin village of democracy. I'm not convinced the EU is any different. 

Of course for the UK 20th century politics might well be a progression, as I often feel I live in a semi-feudal state, a duchy run by an class based elite. Again I'm not convinced the EU would be that much different either.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"Well I'm personally not a believer in the current political system myself, but I enjoy the EU as a concept and an idea and I do want to see it progress. Not out of any concept of pan-European nationalism(I'm very much internationalist), but because the EU is one of the first ""power blocs"" of its kind; One formed entirely of willing participants that weren't coerced with military power or economic threats. 

The way I see it, the EU is a step forward in post-nationalism ideals. We're Irish today, European tomorrow, and maybe one day, for my children's children, we'll just be people and borders wont matter and we wont have to worry about so many of the shitty, petty, irrational problems we have today. And I think the EU has been an extremely good proof of concept in that regard.

On the other hand, I do see where you're coming from. Me being a Socialist I do see the EU as an extremely neoliberal institution and in that regard I am opposed to it. But in the long run it has also been an extremely good institution in terms of preserving the peace, and in that's very important too. 

I don't like the current political system of any government right now, I think they're all corrupt and they all serve corporate interests; The EU is another layer of that, but right now there seems to be some very genuine politics going on there and that's because it is relatively a new institution in terms of the power the EP yields, and that it is yet to experience extremely pervasive corruption.

So, obviously there's a lot wrong with the EU in terms of ideological differences, but I support the project on principal. ",0,1403994380,null,0,false,0,cijlxef,t3_29blp9,t1_cijlxef,t1_cijlqt9,null,1434449208,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7
