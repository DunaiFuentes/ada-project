You say ""it is quite offensive to single out the Danes as specifically good people and in the process belittling the sacrifice of so many others during the war."" So let me quote a couple paragraphs where the author writes that what happened in Denmark was not because they were better people:

&gt;the German occupation’s presence in Denmark was lighter than in either France or Holland. The Danes, like the Bulgarians, kept their king and maintained their own government throughout the occupation. Self-government gave them a capacity to defend Jews that was never possible in the occupied zones of France or Holland.

&gt;Why did the Danes behave so differently from most other societies and populations in occupied Europe? For a start, they were the only nation where escape to a safe neutral country lay across a narrow strait of water. Moreover, they were not subject to exterminatory pressure themselves. They were not directly occupied, and their leadership structures from the monarch down to the local mayors were not ripped apart. 

&gt;Denmark offers some confirmation of Rousseau’s observation that virtue is most easily fostered in small republics.

And here the author disagrees with Lidegaard:

&gt;Lidegaard is an excellent guide to this story when he sticks close to Danish realities. When he ventures further and asks bigger questions, he goes astray. At the end of his book he asks: “Are human beings fundamentally good but weak? Or are we brutal by nature, checked and controlled only by civilization?” He wants the Danish story to answer such questions, but it cannot bear such weight. There simply are no general answers to the question of why humans behave as they do in times of extremity. What Lidegaard’s story really demonstrates is that history and context are all. Denmark was Denmark: that is all one can truthfully say.

&gt;Lidegaard makes the argument, in his conclusion, that had resistance been as strong elsewhere in Europe as it was in Denmark, the Nazis might never have been able to drive the Final Solution to its conclusion... This strikes me as only half-right. Anti-Semitism was indeed not “a primordial force” that the Nazis simply tapped into wherever they conquered. Jews met different fates in each country the Nazis occupied—or at least the rates of destruction and escape varied. But it does not follow that what the Danes did other peoples could have also done.

A) We're relatively close to Moscow, Murmansk, Petrozavodsk, naval bases near St. Petersburg, and we're VERY close to St. Petersburg.

B) We share a LONG border with Russia, and basically own the most important shoreline in the baltic for the Russians (which isn't NATO (Estonia))

C) These two geographical factors together provide enough reason for both NATO and Russia to be VERY interested in Finland strategically, and I'd assume that our territory would be in very high risk. Either we would allow NATO here if Russia isn't already here.

By being in NATO, we would just secure our position in the nightmare of a war if it ever breaks out.

Sure, it would make our relationship a bit more difficult. However, Putin has established that he's big boss for life in Russia. He's been relatively 'steady' as a leader and 'friend', but what comes after him? Will his successor be a steady one?

1. Was the agreement not bilateral?  
2. If not, why not?  
3. Do you or do you not recognise the sovereign state of Ukraine?

Yes, they were very much on a bilateral mission.

&gt; If you speak of bilateral talks in a conflict, you usually mean both conflict parties and not one of the conflict parties and their allies. 

They were not on 'bilateral talks in a conflict'. Why are you so very keen on forgetting their purpose and mandate, and insisting as if they had no right to be there? Simply: why do you do that?

&gt; Yes it is. Go educate yourself on the OSCE, its charta and the difference to organizations as NATO.

No, having that mission does not mean that. That's why said you're confusing things in the first place. You seem to be insisting that for that specific mission there should have been arbritrary number of parties agreeing. Parties that you don't even care to name - never mind explaining the reasoning why.

And further I say their kidnapping was a violation. Do you agree? And if not why not?

&gt;Faced with the possibility of financial failure, Iceland had to think on its feet.  Instead of bailing out banks USA-style, the country forgave mortgage debt for the population – and completely started over from square one.

&gt;A country with a small population of roughly 320,000 citizens, Iceland‘s entire banking structure “systemically failed” in the early days of the 2008 recession.  Despite the fact that Iceland is still on the road to recovery, the country ranks high as a politically and economically stable nation.  Their success over the last few years has been largely under-reported, and the story behind it is quite fascinating.

And:

&gt;When Iceland’s President Olafur Ragnar Grimmson was asked whether or not other countries – Europe in particular – would succeed with Iceland’s “let the banks fail” policy, he stated the following:

&gt;*“Why are the banks considered to be the holy churches of the modern economy? Why are private banks not like airlines and telecommunication companies and allowed to go bankrupt if they have been run in an irresponsible way? The theory that you have to bail out banks is a theory that you allow bankers enjoy for their own profit, their success, and then let ordinary people bear their failure through taxes and austerity.  People in enlightened democracies are not going to accept that in the long run.”*",0,1399498907,null,0,false,0,chc6rze,t3_24xxp4,t1_chc6rze,t1_chbx7c7,null,1433696376,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

But I don't think it's realistic to assume that neither NATO or Russia would want to allocate resources to invade us, when they are so needed elsewhere. Sure both parties would try to pressure us, especially if the conflict was arctic, but it wouldn't be a certainty that we would have to take any part besides defending our borders from any aggressive party. By being in the NATO, we would guarantee having to face in imminent attack and bombings. Our safest option would be to be really outspoken about our neutrality, that there was no doubt on either side that we would side with the enemy.

But that's all just guessing. Joining would have a very real and instantaneous effect of making our relationship with Russia a really, really cold one, if not a hostile one. By joining NATO, we would lower the chance of an attack, but would raise the chance of us being part of a wider conflict. And since I don't believe there is any real threat of an attack in the near future, I don't see the benefit of joining. We would be better defended from a very unlikely one-on-one conflict but we would cause very real harm to our relations.

And after Putin. What if the next guy is a radical nationalist? I can see this going two ways:

1. He escalates things with NATO, which Russians already (well, rightfully so) see as a enemy/rival of Russia. They act hostile towards the US and their NATO allies in Europe.

2. They start to make serious claims towards Finland. I find it unlikely that this would happen outside of fringe party rhetorics. It's a possibility. And if this was to happen, I think we should seek alliance with NATO. (If EU forces aren't up to the task by then.) But seeking an alliance would certainly escalate the situation.

Most likely the next strongman of Russia won't be an extremist though. So maintaining good relations with current administration would show to the next guy that we seek no trouble with Russia, and most likely our good relationship would continue.

True, if the next strongman was an extremist seeking to annex Finland, no matter the cost, we would be better off joining now, but I think that's very unlikely. So should we safeguard ourselves from an unlikely attack (and ruin our current relationship) or should we try to maintain our warm relations, that have a very real effect now and in the future?

For instance: someone claims that Ukraine is banning the communist party (which btw isn't true), someone reacts saying this is anti-democratic, and here come replies about how it is not anti-democratic at all and is the right thing to do.

The tragic fire in Odessa? ""Yeah but without Putin it would have never happened."" Before that: unidentified armed militia doing fishy things in Crimea? ""I refuse to believe Ukrainian citizens could do that, they are all Russian soldiers, the population doesn't support them."" Months ago: far-right movements to be seen among the peaceful Maidan protesters? ""They're just like any other protester, don't believe Putin's exaggerations.""

We're just people seated at computers, we lack a LOT of information and understanding of the complex events that are occurring all over Ukraine, but whatever happens the default attitude is ""it's Russia's fault"".

true,fforw,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Do you or do you not recognise the sovereign state of Ukraine?

What I/we as Germans think about that is largely irrelevant to the issue. 

There is a civil war like situation brewing in Ukraine over the question of the legitimate government or the unity of the country. We as Germans should try to help to reach a peaceful solution to that and certain not send military personell spying on ""the other side"" further destabilizing the situation. 

&gt; Why are you so very keen on forgetting their purpose and mandate, and insisting as if they had no right to be there? 

I am not questioning the official OSCE mission which again they were not a part of. What I am questioning is mostly us sending the people. The legal situation in a dissolving state is a hard question to answer. I am not a lawyer, especially not an Ukranian one. I find it very unfortunate that the OSCE mission was compromised in such a manner. It was certainly wrong for us to get involved. 

&gt; Parties that you don't even care to name

It's the damn OSCE, [members highlighted in green here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OSCE_members_and_partners.svg). This is really not that hard to get.

&gt; And further I say their kidnapping was a violation. Do you agree? And if not why not?

a violation of what? As I said before, the civil war like situation is very unfortunate. Kidnapping people is bad, putching against elected governments is bad, not caring about minority rights is bad, it's all a mess. 

I can however understand the reaction to kidnap these fake OSCE observers much more than I could accept the real OSCE observers being harmed. The sending of those people is highly fishy and I can totally see that they're regarded as spies from the rebel / Russian point of view. This is why it was exactly the wrong thing to do to get involved.

true,Finnish_Nationalist,FINL,Vannoutunut monarkisti... Vai onko?,"&gt;""But by outright banning and outlawing it is, ironically, against democratic values too."" [-3]

To be as fair as possible, he did also say that ""Communism (in theory) is a hard left ideology, so it's really understandable that hardcore right parties (that are in command in Ukraine now) want to eliminate even the possibilities of competition"" which seems to imply that the right-wing parties in Ukraine want to get rid of the Communist parties. Since that part of the thread started when ekonova thought that the article (later?) proved to be wrong was right, his reply could be interpreted as him not knowing that the article is fake. And fake information is bad.

&gt;""Communism in practice is an ideology of death 
(...which praises armed struggle between citizens and embraces genocide of one segment of the society.)"" [+6]

Well, he does have a point on the armed struggle part. Maybe a bit less so on the class genocide part. The aim of communism is creating a Marxist-Leninist form of government with armed revolt, as I have understood it. And it isn't very kind towards the ones who were part of upper classes. In practice in Soviet Union and China people from pre-soviet upper class backgrounds were threatened during the revolution years and discriminated against after that. When the Soviets were choosing an astronaut for the first trip to space, they chose the labourer backgrounded person over the slightly more competent person from an upper class background, for example.
Also, citizens of communist countries didn't do so well, some even died. So he does have backing on Communism leading to death in practice. Of course, it could also be intrepreted that he meant communists in practice idolising killing.

&gt;""Every single thing you have said could just as easily be applied to capitalists as it could be to communists. Strong but empty rhetoric."" [-1] -OP, kodiakus

Kodiakus then puts the other persons comment as a template to further his point. Personally, I think that kodiakus is wrong here. 

""While banning parties or ideologies does go against democratic values, in practice we have to put a stop sign on somewhere. In the case of Capitalist parties, because of their violent history and neglect for human rights, it is more than adequate and necessary for the protection of society and human race to prevent them from having power at all.""

This part I'm sure is wrong. Since all Communist (Marxist-Leninist) governments have had only one party, the Communist party. Unless, his point is that by banning one party we will ultimately ban all parties. Which I believe is proved wrong, since some democracies in Eastern Europe (Latvia) for example have banned communist parties but no other ones. I'm not very informed on how well democracy works there, though.

""Capitalism in practice is an ideology of death which praises armed subjugation of citizens and embraces the genocide of populaces for their resources""

I don't know about this. Many Capitalist countries don't praise armed subjugation of citizens (Nordic countries). He probably means Riot police and stuff by that. While for example Turkey uses them as an excuse to quell protesters, I think that riots can get really bad without riot police. There have been some cases where the less well to do, not necessarily citizens do stuff like burning cars without much reason during riots. People would get hurt in those and, althought it does sound strange, the police needs to protect the citizens. The genocide part must mean stuff like Native Americans getting killed. Shit sucks, but those were less civilized times during which women were viewed as animal-level intellect compared to men and black plus others weren't considered human.

&gt;""That is just play with words and doesn't convince any one."" [+6]

Roughly said, but I do agree with how he replied. And his reasoning.

&gt;""I'm sick and tired about hearing about the ""evils of communism"" from people who refuse to look past their own nose."" **[0 now]** (note that the guy never said he was a communist, but his attempts to just say banning the communist party from political life may not be democratic seem to make him the bad guy)

Hmm, yeah. But I do think that Communism has definitely produced worse results than Capitalism. What I read from his comment was that Communism and Capitalism are both equally bad. Nobody said that Capitalism hasn't ever led to anything bad. He did write a few things that were I believe to be outright wrong there (Manifest Destiny, the third world problems). 

(To be honest I had forgotten that this started from banning parties not being democratic lol, he has sayed a lot else now.)

&gt;""You are no better than an holocaust denier."" **[+4 now]**

I'm not really that convinced by his arguments over the other guy's. I'd say that my feeling about them being right or wrong is 50/50. Homewer, that ending was... Yeah. A bit extreme.

&gt;""I haven't denied anything."" **[now -3]** (the guy indeed hasn't denied a fucking thing!)

His text could feel like it viewed Communism and Capitalism both as bad. And arguably, Communism is worse, is the more common opinion.

The biggest cause of downvotes here is the rest of the comment, I think: ""...The only one denying anything is you, with your whitewashing and dishonest revisionism. You are no better than an holocaust denier. By actively denying the crimes of Capitalism and the inherit evil of it, you are no better than the mass murderers of history and their cohorts."" Which used the template thingy again. The other person did call the other a holocaust denier first, but is it really mature to call the person a holocaust denier back? Kodiakus also called him a revisionist and whitewasher (carries same meaning as holocaust denier?).

Indeed, Kodiakus didn't deny anything. the other fella shouldn't have made the foreboding that he would deny/had denied.

Another thing, Kodiakus' comment had this template text, nut not anything else. The other guy had wrotes some argument along with his.

In my opinion, they both were wrong on that one.


&gt;Put that anywhere else, in another context, that's not the results you would get

I dunno. I mean, I kinda addressed this point, didn't I (I'm kinda tired right now) ? The guys had more stuff to their comments than what you quoted, in my opinion (no insult to you implied).

&gt;But on a thread about Ukraine people don't up- or down-vote based on their opinion, it's all about ""downvoting the pro-Putin"" and basically anything that suggests Kiev may also be playing a dangerous game.

We all pretty much agree that Putin is a... well, the less said the better. I have seen some comments that speak about Kiev critically upvoted (my personal opinion on Kiev: Let's wait and see). Sometimes people have a 'which one of these represents my side?' -view on the comments.

There might also be some blaming and such because of the claims of [Pro-Kremlim bots](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/04/pro-russia-trolls-ukraine-guardian-online), you might've seen that linked to in here.

&gt;Whatever happens in the news, you must blame it on Putin and condone anything that comes from the Ukrainian side, if you try to act otherwise, someone will get into a silly argument with you and will be mechanically upvoted. No discussion allowed, it's all about showing you how stupid you are.

I don't think it's quite *that* severe. As long as one writes his/her comments based on facts and trustworthy links, doesn't get too emotional, doesn't insult anybody etc. one wouldn't get that much downvotes, maybe even upvotes in my opinion. 

I don't think that thread served as much proof of otherwise stuff.

Actually, what you said is outright entirely wrong.

A fire is sadly more complex than that. your clothing will wistand temperature your exposed skin certainly cant before breaking down. radiating heat is blocked by it, the same way a tee shirt can prevent sunburns during summer. 

The body did failed due to too much exposed parts (like the head) that got charred by the heat alone (without catching fire), but the skin below the protected par is mostly intact because it didn't outright caught fire. 

Put your hand on a heating plate. it'll be burnt by the heat alone, unless you have clothing in the middle which give you some extra protections. can you damaged your hand to charred skin and unusability ? certainly yes. will it catch fire on the other hand ? not likely.

Or venture in a burning building with a firesuit and no helmet. i'm exagerating it, but your head along with you would die from the heat, yet most of your body would be intact.

Habe ich. Vielleicht solltest du es auch nochmal und dann es auch verstehen.

&gt; Dass man aus Tierversuchen mögliche Ergebnisse für den Menschen ableitet, ist in der Medikamentenforschung täglich Brot.

Der Mensch hat kein Organ zur Orientierung an Magnetfeldern. Da ist nichts abzuleiten. Genauso wenig wie man aus neuen Erkenntnissen zum Leuchten von Glühwürmchen auf irgendwas am Menschen ableiten kann. Wir haben keine Leuchtorgane. 

&gt; Dass weitere Forschungen solche Ergebnisse erst erhärten müssen

Die Forschungen und die Ergebnisse erstrecken sich ausschließlich auf den Magnetorientierungssinn von Vögeln. Hat mit Menschen nichts zu tun und da ist nichts zu erhärten was nicht mal ansatzweise da ist und auch von den Forschern selbst nicht propagiert wird. 

&gt; Ob solche extrem schwachen Magnetfelder und die beteiligten elektrischen Energien am Ende ausreichen, vielleicht sogar auch im menschlichen Gehirn irgendwelche Effekte zu erzielen, ist ebenfalls noch völlig unklar.

Das ist Geschwafel des Journalisten der wild durch die Gegend spekuliert. Ob die Strahlung villeicht sogar auch die Knusprigkeit meiner Frühstücksbrötchen beeinflußt ist ebenfalls noch völlig unklar. Abgesehen davon, dass die Wirkung auf den Menschen studiert ist. Von völlig unklar kann überhaupt keine Rede sein.

&gt; Das Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz in Salzgitter will die Oldenburger Studie jedenfalls erst genau prüfen, ehe man Aussagen über die Bedeutung des zur Rede stehenden Elektrosmogs für die menschliche Gesundheit macht.

Na klar. Der Journalist hat da angefragt ""Was meinen Sie zu der Studie"". Antwort: ""Studie ist neu, können wir nichts zu sagen momentan, müssen wir erstmal durchgehen was da drinsteht bevor wir was sagen."" Wer da irgendwie rausliest, dass das Bundesamt seine bisherige Position infrage stellt, der liest was er gerne hören will und nicht was gesagt wurde.

Actually I wonder if it can exist.

According to Hayek there can't be personal freedom without economic freedom. Also Einaudi pointed out that socialism has been chronically unable of formulating a theory of the state.

So it seems like strong limitations of personal freedom are needed in a socialist state (at least I completely agree with those supporting this point of view), and personally I don't see anything human in the deprivation of personal freedom and civil rights.

You must have an enormous murica boner to even think that Iran, Iraq, and NK's leaders are in any way American puppets. Kim Jong Un would be highly offended! Of course the Shah is American-installed and belongs to Murican sphere of influence, but that's the Cold War - exactly the situation (multiple superpowers) that I claim is necessary for coercive spheres of influence.

Also, Iraq is like almost the hugest example of how America isn't building spheres of influence after the Cold War. The American-backed candidate was given huge propaganda support, yet lost the election, and America didn't organize a coup or anything. Indeed, Iraq's current leader is quite anti-American. Please point to *one* example where the British/Chinese/etc empire installed an unfriendly government in its sphere of influence.

The Ukraine thing is obviously just diplomats talking about which leader they like the most. China publicly does that with every single Japanese election (this guy is pro-China, good for leader, that guy is anti-China, bad for leader). There is no evidence that they actually have coercive influence to install the leader they like. I talk exactly like that with one of my friends, about potential leaders in Ukraine.

I grew up in a rural part of the country where law enforcement could be 15+ minutes away, even if they responded instantly and came at full speed.  It is understandable you cannot always wait for the police.  That being said, the home owner did not exactly cover himself in glory or forethought.  So kids have been breaking into your garage recently for petty theft?  Secure the garage, don't load it down with motion sensors.  Hardware stores sell these awesome things called locks. 

You go running out there with a shotgun and if it is a real violent criminals, not teenagers doing petty theft, you end up getting shot by an accomplice.  Way to die and leave your kids fatherless because some morons were trying to steal your snow blower.  Now when they start forcing their way through the interior door into your house, by all means start discharging shotgun shells.  

However when you have video footage of the guy, you left your door open as bait, etc, it starts to move away from Castle Doctrine and more of you want to kill someone.  Especially when after all that you exit the home, meaning your family is left behind inside, so you can flank and shoot someone.  That's not exactly defending the family.  You could have stayed inside, watched the intruder over the baby monitor, had the wife call 911, and if the guy tries the interior door that leads to your home, shoot to kill.  Along with also behind beside your family in the invent other accomplices attempt to enter via the backdoor or such.  Basically the exiting and engaging suggests from one perspective that the homeowner knew this wasn't a serious threat in terms of needing to hunker down and protect his family.  

Home owner could be going to go to jail over this.  Castle Doctrine is still a valid idea with me though and I see no reason to consider a gun control debate over it.  Guy had a shotgun, which is not a heavily regulated gun in many industrial countries, and as far as our media can dig up no priors to argue he should not have had that weapon.  Mr. Kaarma massively overreacted to multiple intrusions by teenagers and will pay the price, however had a certain teenager stayed him and played XBox instead of garage hopping, Mr. Kaarma would have had no target to overreact against.

The entire Pro-Russian part of the country will be completely unable to vote, and the election will be heavily skewed towards the West. Because Ukraine has a unitary, parliamentary government, the minority parties have essentially no power, and the southern and eastern regions will have essentially no representation. This will seriously undermine the legitimacy of the Kievan government, more so than it already has, and it might cause a new escalation of instability. Now, moderates who had a lot invested in the Ukrainian state will realize that they are completely without a voice.

Thus, Putin gets to say to the West that he hasn't interfered with the Ukrainian elections, Kiev will likely elect a far more radical politician who's views are totally at odds with those of the South and East, and the South and East will have very little representation. This will then likely spark a series of legitimate protests and anger from Southern and Eastern Ukrainians at their lack of representation in the Ukrainian government. Given the response of the Police and Military (that basically either deserted or defected), and the response of the Pro-Maidan Defense Forces and Right Sector (which killed 42 people in Odessa), conflict will only increase. Moreover, Kiev doesn't have time on its side. It's foreign currency reserves will last only about another month, and IMF loans are contingent upon economic restructuring and reforms (read: austerity). Moreover, to the West, European businesses are paying the price for the United States' sanctions to the tune of several billion dollars, and they risk their economic recovery.

The most approaching thing that could lead you to understand the psychological of the french during this period (and therefore their mindset for after) is the TV serie ""Un village Francais"" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1288631/ 

It has a lot of episodes but it is the only thing I have ever saw that puts you in the mind of the people from that time and it explores a wide variety of reaction following the invasion.

For real documentaries maybe take a look at the episodes of ""Apocalypse WW2"" it's a documentary in 5 or 6 episodes.

You can also go on arte replay (http://videos.arte.tv/fr/videos#/tv/coverflow///1/120/) it's a French and German TV channel which has quite often some things on WW2 and post WW2. 

Same thing on France 5 (http://www.france5.fr/videos) but this is a french channel specialized in cultural things.

Finally if you can ever catch Historia, they have things on WW2 almost every. Even thought it is worldwide mostly, not focused on France.

true,beastgp,null,null,"I was just there for the first time last autumn. Nice is big and there's lots to do/see/eat so it's well worth a visit. The seafront (Promenades des Anglais) is a natural draw. Just a little outside Nice by a short-ish bus ride is the village of Eze (pronounced 'ez') which is on a high promontory/rock. Is very old and equally beautiful. It's a bit touristy but that's to be expected - still recommended. Monaco too is surely worth the day trip. It's such a unique place I think you'd regret not visiting it when you were so close. Monaco grand prix, casino, fantastic sportscars, gawping at the rich, gawping at the tourists who are gawping at the rich. There's a castle/fort  on the West side of Monaco - great views and a 'changing of the guard' ceremony - be warned - this is VERY popular. San Remo itself was lovely though I may have been blinded by staying in one of the grandest hotels and also reuniting with my long lost sister. It's very pretty, quite small and very much Italian. They have a few events that probably change the face of it if you happen to be there at that time. (Flower festival and jazz festival - also a world class bike race but that's at the start of April.)
As for travelling around, apart from the bus to Eze we took trains from San Remo to Monaco and Nice - all I can say is the French side can go on strike a lot and the Italian side can be a bit sparse in the timetable. We did get to where we needed to be when we wanted to (roughly) but it was a bit stressful at the time.
I took photos while I was there (as you do) - if it helps to inspire you please take a look. I'll happily answer any questions raised from them. 
Enjoy your trip - it's a beautiful part of the world!

Obviously gun control does not work if your control extends only to the municipal borders of your city (which happens to be a global one), so criminals only need to take a leisurely drive to stock up on guns and ammo, it needs to happen nationally so it could works. That's so obvious I didn't think it needed to be pointed out.

I mean this is an educational system where students still get caned for minor infractions such as being late. This is an educational system where primary school grade 6 exam results can and will determine the social standing and position of a large majority of singaporean students for the remainder of their lives. this is a system which encourages rote memorization, ""mugging"" (which is studying continuously for large lengths of time,) and heavy use of tutoring centers (aka 5/7 days a week if not more.) 

The students in this system often come out of it much less useful to an employer than any PISA or SAT score will ever show and less prepared for university than their grades would suggest. And singapore is still not as bad in this aspect as China, Shanghai and South Korea where there is an even bigger focus on pure academics as opposed to anything else. (for example in South Korea the combination of the culture and the educational system results in new graduates in the workforce acting like pure yes men and I mean like literally they aren't even capable of suggesting alternative solutions they think might be better they will just say yes. Eg: one time my boss tried to get one of them to setup a meeting and the korean handler would continually say yes to having setup the meeting- it turns out the meeting wasn't even arranged because the other man was sick- however the korean guy was not about to say ""no"" to his boss.)

I do have to commend the Singaporean government because in recent years they've slowly been taking down the importance of pure academics and have been trying to diversify the learning experience to make it less stressful and to foster more creativity.

I think this situation is very tragic and the kid made a stupid mistake. He certainly didn't deserve to die for it. But what about invading someone's home and stealing their shit sounds like a good idea? It's a felony here and you'd put that on all of your job apps. 

In many U.S. states, the law allows you the option of not bending over for the offender, allowing you to stop them from taking anything that isn't nailed down. Quite frankly, if you report it to the police, you'll never get your shit back and they won't waste any resources investigating it. Maybe it would have been worthwhile for Mr. Dede to research such laws and precedents before he decided to become a felon and burglarize someone's home?

I do think he shot too early. He could have asked Dede to surrender himself. Hindsight's always 20/20 though.

true,_delirium,DENK,Denmark,"If it's at all similar to Denmark, a good part of the tension when people say ""immigrants"" is also not really about immigrants *per se*, in the sense of people who were born elsewhere and moved here. Instead it's about people who are born here and may even have citizenship, but are ""of immigrant background"". That's kind of a code-word for not ethnically Danish, especially if non-white and poorly integrated.

I haven't looked at the statistics recently, but I believe when people complain about crime by ""immigrants"", for example, in Denmark what they tend to really refer to is the crime rate in certain neighborhoods that are seen as ""populated by immigrants"". But then if you look at who there has the highest degree of problems with law enforcement in those neighborhoods, it isn't the actual immigrants. It's instead non-ethnically-Danish young people who were born and grew up in Denmark. The difference is somewhat important because some solutions that might make sense to one problem might not make sense to the other. For example, ""they should learn Danish"" is sometimes mentioned, but some of the groups with the highest level of social problems grew up in Copenhagen or Aarhus and are native Danish speakers, so knowledge of Danish isn't really the problem (and on the other hand, there are a large number of Germans who *don't* know Danish, or know very little, and they typically are not causing problems).",0,1399531375,null,0,false,0,chcjnqs,t3_24zmrs,t1_chcjnqs,t1_chcguc3,null,1433702648,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

The 2% figure is being thrown around by people who either have no idea how budgets work (i.e. *Throwing money at a problem will solve it, amirite?*) or of the real value of pre-emptive military spending. 

Defence is not increased by blanket budget increases, but by budget revaluation: in other words identifying both potential opportunities and also redundancies and allocating resources accordingly towards what is perceived as a collective threat.

People seem too quick for example, to praise Greece for meeting their *military expectations*. Yet the reality is that Greece is geared as a military towards countering a fellow NATO member state: Turkey. It is poorly equipped to respond to expeditionary needs and the state of the economy begs the question of if Greece is capable of sustaining a prolonged commitment when push comes to shove. 

You strengthen a military alliance by increasing military efficiency, enhancing cooperation and giving direction when the situation arises. On the other hand, the quickest way of dismantling the alliance is to force Spain and Italy to arbitrarily double their military spending, thus sky-rocketing domestic resentment against NATO in a country struggling to maintain social services.

And then the differences between middle-school and high-school are blurred and most people get to choose/are basically forced to take a variety of courses over those 6-8 years (eg: 8 years for the ones who finish primary school earlier, maybe 2 of those years could be actual work experience or charity actions or stuff like that?)

this way at least during those years I would have had a lot more flexibility and I would have been able to get experimenting with different interests (psychology, philosophy, science, politics, law, business) much easier. I was actually lucky because I ended up redoing year 11 when I moved from the australian system to the international system because I that meant I had 3 years of high school and I had double the chances others had at picking subjects (eg: I chose history in the IB and ended up learning how to write proper essays, but having done business and legal studies in the australian system in grade 11 I knew I was more suited to that than history.)

For example in australia in middle school in history I learnt about aboriginals- the same thing too because they don't have a history to be honest- every damn year. and housewives/home appliances in the 50s was one of my major topics in middle school history it was the topic for like half of the end of middle school exam for history. Middle school is honestly where western education does the weirdest shit.

Results: Germany's CO2 per capita is quite high, but not the highest ~~(even if we single out Iceland - wtf, did they factor in Eyjafjallajökull???)~~. What makes me wonder is Luxembourg (so much dirty industry?), Netherlands (wind energy?) and  Denmark(wind energy?). Another interesting figure would be CO2 per GDP in € billions. I'll just pick some of the countries for this (among some of the highest CO2 contributors in total figures).

* Germany 207204,89
* Netherlands 186478,93
* United Kingdom 170122,92
* Spain 139009,91
* Poland 552020,01

* France 120646,75
* Italy 147588,26
* Czech Republic 444522,77
* Romania 317619,07

So among the top GDP countries, germany is the highest with 207204,89 tons CO2 per 1 billion.

and just say they're tourists.
the only thing thats standing in our way of doing that is that neither Americans or Europeans want to put boots on the ground.

Indeed. You just said it: We don't want to.
I have no interest in a military adventure in the Ukraine.

&gt; hell yea, have our troops just stand by. 30,000 American soldiers is a formidable force. Like I said Putin is already hesitant to send an army into Ukraine because he know that even though he can beat the Ukrainian military, he might get bogged down in an Afghanistan-like insurgency. Add an American army on to that insurgency and theres no way.

I already said that it is obvious Putin doesn't want a war. He wants to push us to take action. He'll just go around your troops and annex everything except the one area you've got your men. 

This puts you in a hard position because you can do two things:

* Get your men out of there

or

* Attack the Russians

If you attack the Russians, Russia can blame everything on the US. Ukraine is not a member of the NATO, which makes it illegal to 'defend' the place without UN permission. UN permission you won't get because the Russians can veto.

The only way you can go with the military option is by disbanding the UN, which will come with it's own consequences.

You Americans need to stop thinking you can just simply put your troops somewhere in the world and magically solve the diplomatic problems.

As a Spaniard I think we are doing more than enough to contribute to NATO since we get no global influence, nor security since we have no threats.

Tout d'abord une devaluation temporaire n'a pas grand chose a voir avec un retour au FF
Alors se baser sur l'étude de la CAE (tres bonne étude d'ailleurs) pour expliquer que le passage au FF serait la meme chose, c'est du délire total.

L'article que je t'ai link, explique les principales problematiques suite a un passage en FF de la dette publique, meme les conclusions de Sapir s'y retrouvent; Je t'ai meme copié/collé un des paragraphes le plus important sur le sujet:

&gt; Mais le même insiste sur l’aspect «très virtuel» du débat. Ne serait-ce que parce qu’une sortie de la France de l’euro... impliquerait probablement la disparition de l’euro, et que les problèmes se poseraient alors dans d’autres termes. «C’est une approche théorique et de peu d’importance au regard des bouleversements qui interviendraient dans un pareil scénario», ajoute-on au Trésor. Une conversion forcée de la dette publique en nouveaux francs, possible juridiquement, ne peut être isolée de ses conséquences : défiance des investisseurs, explosion des taux d’intérêt (et donc potentiellement de la dette à venir). Jacques Sapir en convient. Ouvrant un autre débat, il estime que la France devrait alors trouver un moyen de ne plus faire appel aux marchés internationaux. Et tous de s’accorder que ce débat juridique, posé par Apparu et Philippot, n’éclaire que très partiellement les enjeux d’une sortie de l’euro.

Les taux d'interets augmenteront car l'euro permet d'assurer un certain rendement qui garde un taux au alentour de 2%

On projete une hausse du taux vers les 5% en cas de passage au FF.
Voila pourquoi le FN retorque qu'en fait ils n'ont pas besoin des marchés pour se financer mais qu'ils préconisent plutot la planche a billet... Ben dis donc, encore une solution miracle !


Quand je parle de renegociation de la dette, je parle de negoce avec les créanciers hein, pas avec les états membres... 
Entre parentheses, belle tentative de brouillage des pistes avec ton imbroglio taux nominal / taux reel cela dit.

Bref, c'est toi qui veut sortir de l'euro, pas moi !

Alors étaye ton propos avec des faits chiffrés et des projections économiques, parce que la théorique c'est cool un moment mais on ne fait pas de la politique sur des a priori et des théories incertaines / non verifiées.

There are other reasons why Switzerland has so many foreigners: 

* Strong economy. Since the sixties Switzerland has attracted lots of foreign workers. We also have a lot of jobs (our unemployment rate is very low) and the standard of living is high. So Switzerland is very attractive for job seekers. 
* Naturalization. It used to be very hard to become a Swiss citizen. There are lots of people who have lived in Switzerland for decades but didn't get citizenship (neither did their kids). These day it's a bit easier to get a Swiss passport – but at the same time being a citizen of a EU country has become more attractive. So even people who have been born here want to stay foreigners.
* Right to move and reside freely. While Switzerland is not a member of the EU it signed the treaty of EU's right to move and reside freely. And lots of EU citizen have taken advantage of that – especially from EU countries that have been hit be the recession. (This may change with the infamous referendum we had.)

&gt;

&gt;The majority of __major political parties__ in Europe have aligned themselves into one of the __pan-European political organisations__ listed below. 13 of these organisations have been legally recognized by the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) as [political parties at the European level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_political_party): [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;The [Nordic Green Left Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Green_Left_Alliance) is a transnational federation of parties, not a pan-European political party *per se*, but it articulates a broadly uniform ideology and its membership is exclusive to it. As such, it is treated akin to one here.

&gt;Parties represented in national parliaments or the [European Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament) are generally included in the below chart, while [independents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_(politics\)) have been omitted. Great ideological diversity can be found in most pan-European organizations, and individual country rows may not correspond with the heuristic left-right spectrum commonly used within its own political discourse.

&gt;


&gt;* Standalone parties with representation in the European Parliament are coloured by the parliamentary group in which they sit. These are:

&gt;&gt;


&gt;


&gt;* Standalone parties with representation in the [Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Assembly_of_the_Council_of_Europe) (but not the European Parliament) are coloured by the parliamentary group in which they sit in the former. These are:

&gt;&gt;


&gt;


&gt;* The ""Standalone parties of the political centre"" column includes some single-interest parties that claim to draw support from all across the spectrum.

&gt;* † indicates the party has observer status within transnational organization

&gt;* National parties are sorted by the alignment adopted by the party's leadership; in some cases MEPs have chosen to sit in different groups within the EP.

In ogni caso, fuori di polemica, ti faccio un paio di osservazioni:

1) Fino a qualche mese prima di iniziare il Dottorato in Italia ero sicuro che l'avrei fatto in Francia, e mi sembrava che gli stipendi fossero un tantino più bassi. Ma c'erano un sacco di borse di studio differenti, quindi OK prendo per buoni i tuoi 1500€ mensili che mi citi.

2) Servirebbero più soldi, ma in ogni caso l'Italia è ancora competitiva. I miei colleghi dottorandi in Italia sono al 50% stranieri, anche da Paesi europei ""ricchi"". Ora sono visiting per un paio di mesi in un Paese del Nord Europa, con stipendi per i dottorandi sensibilmente più alti, e nonostante questo la percentuale di stranieri è del 10%, a occhio. Come al solito l'Italia, con meno mezzi, riesce ad essere quasi competitiva e ad attrarre gente brava dall'estero, almeno nel mio settore (Fisica).

3) Volevo semplicemente fare un po' di cifre, perché il tuo commento iniziale era fuorviante, secondo me. Una persona che legge ""stupida borsa di studio"" potrebbe pensare che sia qualcosa tipo 100€ al mese, invece 1050€ al mese hanno le dimensioni di un piccolo stipendio.

Più che altro ci tenevo a mettere in chiaro questo. Poi ciascuno è libero di fare le valutazioni del caso. Io non mi faccio mancare nulla e metto pure via qualche soldino. Abito in centro da solo, per inciso.

Agreed. That's why I like to take a stance for economic freedom, by pointing out the consequence of the lack of economical freedom: the lack of personal freedom. As demonstrated by the history of socialist countries, as explained by Hayek, one of the most brilliant economists of the last century.

&gt; Most people never start a business in their lives,

Do you really think this is a good argument against economic freedom? Most people never need an unemployment benefit in their lives, shall we remove unemployment benefits?

&gt; It's about thinking less of ""me"" and thinking about more of ""us.""

Nice slogan. However, history has shown that a socialist state (as was Soviet Russia, not as is Sweden) tends to be very oppressive. Facts vs. slogans.

&gt; Economics isn't only about competition, sometimes it's about a healthy mix of cooperation.

Again: you are mistaken. The term ""socialism"" in this context refers to a radical vision of the state. It's not a healthy mix, it's the ""social ownership of the means of production"".

But a German entity, to stay with your example, is subject to German law and will have to comply regardless of whether NY/L/HK help enforce it. If they don't, they commit tax evasion and will sooner or later be held responsible. So, assuming London has to do anything, the others won't be better off as long as the domestic tax collectors are vigilant.

I'm hesistant to go into detail here, given that I understand from my Brussels spies (!) that while the discussions among the participating member states are private (and the UK is excluded from them), they are very fraught and may potentially breakdown and continue to get delayed and the exact scope of the tax continues to change. 

Thus the eventual detailed proposal may look very different from the last public proposal that came out in February 2013. From a UK perspective, the ideal result would be that the talks break down and there is still a chance that this happens. Much depends, as usual, on Angie.

Assuming the proposal does get enacted in its current form and the UK loses the next legal challenge, in the Deutsche Bank example, you're right that under German domestic legislation, DB NY branch would have an obligation under German law to pay the FTT to Germany. However, German tax collectors would have no way of enforcing that obligation against DB NY branch and there is no amount of vigilance that can be done by the German tax authorities. They would have to rely on compliance by DB NY branch here to disclose details of private transactions. Perhaps DB NY will do this, perhaps it won't. 

Another example might illustrate better the concerns that London has. Imagine a New York based fund buying a Mexican stock from an Belgian broker (based in New York but with a permanent address in Belgium). This transaction would be subject to the FTT and the party deemed to be established in Belgium would be the New York based fund. But Belgium, absent the compliance of the US, would have no way of enforcing this tax against the New York fund (which in practice has no real nexus with Belgium). This tax is thus extremely extraterritorial. Would Belgium even try and enforce it? 

In an equivalent transaction by a UK based fund, the UK fund will be subject to the Belgian tax and the UK will be obliged, via the mutual assistance directive, to disclose the transaction. 

What does the UK do here? Does it disclose the transaction to the Belgian tax authorities and thereby lose business to the US? Or does it breach its obligations under the mutual assistance directive? Or does the UK just, at this stage, say enough is enough and we're out?

The FTT of itself is arguably marginal and London is so strong as a financial centre that is can probably survive! However, there is only so much interference from Brussels that London will stand: just in the last couple of years London has been bullied by Brussels in relation to bankers bonuses and short-selling. London is starting to look enviously at New York and Singapore.

How far is Brussels really prepared to push the UK? If Brussels continues to interfere with Britain's best industry, then public opinion will continue to change. Already, just on this threat you have seen that /u/g_morgan, /u/neoliberal and /u/frankeh, all previously EUphiles, are starting to lose confidence in the EU project. 

At this stage aren't we both better off parting ways? Clearly, we want different things. You want a federal union with a strong Brussels able to control the member states, I would like a lose collection of friendly nations able to trade easily with each other. Parting ways seems our only sensible option.

I still maintain that 2% is not a huge amount. If shit ever *did* go down and the combined forces of NATO were truly needed I don't see why the greater burden should be carried by France and the UK (within Europe) when there are other significant countries in NATO. 

&gt; This is just the military industry lobbying because the crimea crisis give them a good excuse.

I agree that we should be wary of that, and I'd be totally against my own country spending any more on the military than they do now (because we reach the 2% threshold). For some countries however the situation in Crimea is a concern, and if NATO is to be taken seriously that concern really should be felt by countries obligated to help in the (very unlikely) event of conflict.


&gt; As a Spaniard I think we are doing more than enough to contribute to NATO since we get no global influence, nor security since we have no threats.

Then why not advocate leaving NATO? The purpose of it is collective defence, and if a country feels it is getting nothing out of it I think that is more a reason to leave than not meet the agreed threshold.

Despite being against (excessive) use of the military, I do see how my own views are shaped by the country I live in, which clearly does have a more active military. My own thought process is that I can't really envisage a situation whereby I'd support the UK entering a major war (defined by requiring the use of NATO) without the support of the other European powers (unless a country within the Anglosphere was attacked I suppose), and if that unfortunate circumstance were to occur I'd want that burden to be shared more evenly.

Still, those disagreeing people will achieve more when making economic than people that don't know anything about economics. A government that has economists will always solve an economic problem quicker than a government that doesn't. Whether economists are an agreeable bunch or not.

&gt; In any case, you clearly don't understand how politics works.

If you can get that conclusion from two Reddit comment we should make you dictator, because you would be able to pretty much solve any problem.

&gt; First of all, each member of the TK has his or her own specialization, they spend most of their time working on crime, technology, the environment, etcetera.

So why do they decide about economics. If your specialization is crime, why are you making economic decisions? You should use the specialization for laws regarding crime, not economics. We don't have English professors giving Physics or Biology professors giving English at Universities either.

&gt; If politicians need information on a subject, they have plenty of advisers and assistants, people are invited to give explanations, there's the wetenschappelijke raad (scientific council), the list goes on.

Advice. That means that anything they say, the politician can simply say: NOPE. If a politician needs advisers and an entire scientific council to get advice on a decision, why not let those advisers and the scientific council make the decision. They can make a far better choice.

Someone who knows his shit, will always make better decisions than people who don't know their shit but decide based on advise from people who do.

&gt; But in the end, there's plenty of smart people from a similar background who disagree with each other in matters of this background! Diederik Samsom and I are both physicists, I disagree with him on nuclear power, for example.

You don't. You both agree about Nuclear Power. You and Samsom disagree about the ethics and morals. One thinks Nuclear Power isn't moral, the other thinks it is. That's a completely different situation. If there are two solutions, then we can ask people: Well which one would be more moral/ethic according to you?

The energy crisis can be solved by Nuclear Power, but it can also be solved through other means. It should be the goal of politicians to decide which are the best decisions, and the people should then choose which one is most liked. Not the other way around.

&gt; Politics is slow because people disagree, which is normal for the complex and varied problems politicians have to deal with.

That's why you shouldn't have politicians making decisions about subject they know nothing about. It becomes to varied. We've chosen one body, and they decide on ALL subjects. The best solution would be multiple bodies, each focusing on a certain subject to reduce the amount of variations politicians have to deal with.

1. **Teenage pregnancy**: on average, we think teenage pregnancy is 25 times higher than official estimates:  we think that 15% of girls under 16 get pregnant each year, when official figures suggest it is around 0.6%. 
2. **Crime**: 58% do not believe that crime is falling, when the Crime Survey for England and Wales shows that incidents of crime were 19% lower in 2012 than in 2006/07 and 53% lower than in 1995.  51% think violent crime is rising, when it has fallen from almost 2.5 million incidents in 2006/07 to under 2 million in 2012.
3. **Job-seekers allowance**: 29% of people think we spend more on JSA than pensions, when in fact we spend 15 times more on pensions (£4.9bn vs £74.2bn).
4. **Benefit fraud**: people estimate that 34 times more benefit money is claimed fraudulently than official estimates: the public think that £24 out of every £100 spent on benefits is claimed fraudulently, compared with official estimates of £0.70 per £100.
5. **Foreign aid**: 26% of people think foreign aid is one of the top 2-3 items government spends most money on, when it actually made up 1.1% of expenditure (£7.9bn) in the 2011/12 financial year.  More people select this as a top item of expenditure than pensions (which cost nearly ten times as much, £74bn) and education in the UK (£51.5bn).
6. **Religion**: we greatly overestimate the proportion of the population who are Muslims: on average we say 24%, compared with 5% in England and Wales.  And we underestimate the proportion of Christians: we estimate 34% on average, compared with the actual proportion of 59% in England and Wales.
7. **Immigration and ethnicity**: the public think that 31% of the population are immigrants, when the official figures are 13%. Even estimates that attempt to account for illegal immigration suggest a figure closer to 15%.  There are similar misperceptions on ethnicity: the average estimate is that Black and Asian people make up 30% of the population, when it is actually 11% (or 14% if we include mixed and other non-white ethnic groups).
8. **Age**: we think the population is much older than it actually is – the average estimate is that 36% of the population are 65+, when only 16% are.
9. **Benefit bill**: people are most likely to think that capping benefits at £26,000 per household will save most money from a list provided (33% pick this option), over twice the level that select raising the pension age to 66 for both men and women or stopping child benefit when someone in the household earns £50k+.  In fact, capping household benefits is estimated to save £290m, compared with £5bn for raising the pension age and £1.7bn for stopping child benefit for wealthier households.
10. **Voting**: we underestimate the proportion of people who voted in the last general election – our average guess is 43%, when 65% of the electorate actually did (51% of the whole population).

They also blame their media but when I ask them to show me a single source where the media claims those numbers it doesn't exist. Similarly I'm sure that there are no British media sources that say 31% of the population are immigrants. 

The media might misinform and sensationalize, but the people exaggerate that 100 times. I would like to see a follow up question on the one about population. If 10 people divide a cake equally and 5 of them are Pakistanis, how much does each person get? I'll bet those same people will say the Pakistanis each get 31% of the cake. 

What the media does is show in big bold headlines ""There Are A Lot Of Immigrants!"" because that sells papers. It's right-wing banter and it's pandering to certain constituents, but it's still just an opinion. People think ""Hmm, yeah, a lot of immigrants. How much is a lot?

true,TheByzantineDragon,FRIE,Fryslân (Living in Overijssel),"&gt; As if dictatorships have better solutions. The problem is not the type of government, it's that humans are fallible.

Some dictatorships have. If you're a dictator and you're doing really good. Great. But dictatorships often rely on violence, repression and that the son of the dictator will become leader on day.

Obviously that doesn't work. I'd give power to the system that can solve the problems our country faces. I don't care whether they are 100% democratic or 100% dictatorial. 

As long as there is no excessive violence, the government gets in place through merit, not birthright and the government can solve problems effectively, I'm okay with it.

Humans are indeed the problem, the thing is: The way human groups behave never really changes. You can change the general opinion, but you can't change how the group reacts to problems or changes.

&gt; You haven't been in other countries and other times. This is simply untrue. Trust in government in democratic countries is higher than ever and elsewhere.

I haven't indeed, but we have the numbers. Trust in government is something that gets surveyed in most western countries and it has for decades.

I'm not saying the trust is the lowest in the world, I'm saying it's the lowest we've ever gotten since the start of our democracy. Trust in the government would be much higher if the government acted like we wanted, which is the goal of democracy as you said. The fact that the trust in government shows that democracy doesn't often succeed in giving the most popular solution.

http://www.survey-onderzoek.nl/pics/vertrouwen-eu2.jpg

http://www.edelman.com/news/trust-in-government-plunges-to-historic-low/

&gt; No, the goal is not popularity, it's acceptance. It's perfectly possible that people accept an unpopular solution because the democratic process did convince them it was the best solution anyway, or that anything else isn't possible for any reason so resistance isn't possible.

In this case it acts the same. Low government trust means that people aren't accepting what it's doing. This means that for the past couple decades, the percentage of people that 'accepted' government policies has been dropping.",0,1399546978,null,0,false,0,chcmbvi,t3_250vtj,t1_chcmbvi,t1_chcm5u8,null,1433703906,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; First, I don't care about downvotes. But thanks. Second, I understand what you mean now. Although I do think we should wait out to see what the result will really be instead of relying on spies and speculation. Perhaps our discussion is completely unfounded. Lastly, personally, I'm not in favour of an FTT, so I don't even want this to be enacted in the first place. Having said that, some of the biggest supporters of such a tax are, in fact, based in the UK (or even in the US, if you remove the .uk from the URL). So please, don't paint this as an UK vs. rEU stand-off. It's not.

By spies I mean my own Belgian colleagues who have access to the Belgian government and the MEPs and Commission people working on this etc. Obviously everyone who works in the city of London is following closely these negotiations given that we will be impacted by them. From the perspective of the UK, it is a shame that the UK government is excluded from participating in discussions which will impact heavily the UK. 

It is true that there are supporters of the FTT in the UK, but in terms of official negotiations and the actual legal challenge it is the UK government that is taking the Commission to court. If the FTT proceeds to the next steps, it will be the UK government that goes to court again, most likely alone. While there are other member states that are against it, Ireland, Luxembourg and Sweden, I expect that they will all ultimately hide behind the UK (which has the most to lose). In many respects, then, it is a stand-off between the UK and rEU and one that I expect that the UK will lose in the court. This constant future pattern of the UK being in a lonely minority against an increasingly integrated Eurozone will become more and more tiring.

As a German voter who is against the FTT and has many sympathies with UK positions but is an EUphile, how do you vote in the European elections? Presumably FDP?",0,1399547360,null,0,false,0,chcmefn,t3_24xecg,t1_chcmefn,t1_chcm2lr,null,1433703938,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,TheByzantineDragon,FRIE,Fryslân (Living in Overijssel),"&gt; I think it just might not work for you.

I'm talking about facts. Not what I think works, but about what the science and numbers tell us what works. I don't care if it works for me or not. If you can show me the actual science that shows a couple of solutions that all work, I will choose one of them based on opinion and ditch all others.

There's a big difference between moral question and scientific questions.

If the science shows that solutions A, C and F work, we will NOT employ solutions B, D and E and the people should choose between A, C and F.

For a lot of things there isn't one function solution, I'm saying that the government should consist of people that are experienced in their respective fields, so they can choose the best solutions and then the people can choose which solution they like the most.

Currently the people choose which solutions 'work' and the government decides which it likes the most. 

For example: The PVV doesn't believe in Global Warming. I'm saying that the government should accept Global Warming as fact (because it is a fact) whether the people like it or not. Then the government can create solutions for Global Warming. 

A US politician said that windmills were slowing down wind and thus were warming the Earth up. Conclusion: Less windmills. The government should state: That is absolute bullshit and we will not see this as a proper solution because the science clearly shows that this isn't true.

Basically:

It's the government's to choose working solutions based on scientific research. It's the people's job to choose the one they like most out of those solutions.

true,gbb-86,null,null,"&gt;Istruzione Ad esempio, ho degli amici insegnanti, sulla trentina, che si lamentano della mancanza di rispetto e di educazione (anche in senso anglosassone di ""istruzione"") delle nuove leve, cioè un involgarimento in tutti i sensi della popolazione.

Ai miei tempi tra gli insegnati si affacciava la feccia più putrida che l'umanità poteva offrire, parte del dolore che questi ignobili esseri potevano infliggerci era dovuta al fatto che li prendessimo sul serio e che di conseguenza prendessimo sul serio la nostra ""ribellione"" nei loro confronti.
Mi piace che le generazioni odierne siano talmente menefreghiste da ridurre allo 0 il peso di queste persone nel bilancio della proprio felicità.

&gt;Etica del lavoro Oltre all'istruzione, in un altro commento, si accenna alla mutata etica del lavoro. Qualcuno sa dare un'analisi o altri esempi significativi in questo senso?
Parlando coi miei genitori, sembra che ora ci sia l'""ognuno per sé"", in maniera molto più accentuata che in passato.

L'etica del lavoro è diventata di stampo più anglosassone, il lavoratore è un oggetto e come tale lo si tratta e considera. Andrebbe bene se non fosse che la filosofia anglosassone esiste solo a senso unico. Per esempio il datore di lavoro italiano si arrabbia, la prende sul personale e straparla di tradimento se il suo lavoratore fa colloqui da altre parti. 
Assurdo.

&gt;Intrattenimento Inoltre, anche lo spettacolo mi sembra, in genere, offrire contenuti di minore qualità. Lasciando stare i vari ""reality"" (che di ""reality"" hanno solo il nome), anche la comicità stessa mi sembra più grezza. Non vedo, per dire, nei comici moderni la stessa classe di un Walter Chiari, o un Tognazzi, o un Vianello.

Il problema dell'italiano è pensare che Walter Chiari, Tognazzi o Vianello fossero chissà quali cime. Hanno tutti fatto roba caruccia e roba merdosa ma non c'è nel nostro paese una cultura diffusa della comicità e della sua necessaria libertà.

&gt;Società Infine, mi sembra ci sia un aumento generale di attaccamento acritico a ideologie disparate, che porta solo a divisioni nella società, e che non mi sembra interessato al dialogo.

320 million is not half a billion. That's a stretch if there ever was one. 

FOX News = Most watched News channel in the US. 

Here's a link from the guardian but a google of ""what is the most watched news channel in america"" will produce a million and one polls pointing to Fox news. **half of americans trust fox news**

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/27/fox-news-most-popular

&gt;  but rather a significant portion of the american population deem it acceptable under the context of ""defending your home"".

A significant portion of the population do deem it acceptable to kill people that break into their homes under castle doctrine. The US's laws reflect that coupled with their gun culture. That guy (one of FOxs most popular hosts) didn't lose his job over defending the guy that shot two kids. Conversely, in the UK Jeremy Clarkson mumbles ""nigger"" in a shot that was rejected by Top Gear as it might've caused offence and he narrowly escaped with his job after uploading a video begging for forgiveness. 

If someone was on tv in the UK defending the execution of 2 children they'd lose their job. End of.

I don't care if the average fox news viewer is 68. My point that a significant amount of the american population deem it acceptable to kill people under castle doctrine. I'm not saying every American does - I'm saying the popularity of castle doctrine laws, NAFTA and the fact the most watched news channel in the US was defending that execution can't be dismissed as psychopathic nutters on the fringe of american society. That guy did get 40 years though which obviously points to the majority not accepting that position but that was never my claim.

true,Alien1993,null,null,"&gt; Caro amico Alien questo semplicemente non è vero. Il governo c'è a prescindere, sorge subito appena il sistema socio-economico supera un livello di complessità elementare (il che è avvenuto circa 7000 anni fa (davvero)). Quindi il governo ce l'hai a prescindere, il punto è come sceglierlo.

Ok, va bene.

&gt; Ora come ora il sistema è il voto. E la triste realtà è questa: quando un politico deve prendere delle decisioni, di fianco a lui c'è un analista che gli dice qual è la probabile risposta della sua base elettorale. Questo analista conosce benissimo le statistiche dell'astensione nelle varie fasce demografiche (divise per età, sesso, popolazione, occupazione ecc.). Se la tua fascia demografica non vota o non vota un certo partito, quando il politico deve decidere se ne fotte del fatto che la sua decisione possa farti incazzare, tanto non lo voti comunque.

Che faccia pure, a me non interessa. 

&gt; Quindi non votare un effetto ce l'ha ed è chiarissimo: non esisti nel sistema politico, i tuoi interessi semplicemente non contano più niente per chi prende le decisioni. Questo è il motivo per cui, ad esempio, nelle città universitarie quasi tutte le amministrazioni locali hanno politiche anti-studente: gli universitari votano poco e solo una frazione vota in quel comune, mentre i comitati di vecchi che vogliono i bar chiusi entro le 22 sono un bel bloccone compatto che al seggio ci va cascasse il mondo.

Hai descritto Perugia.

Il fatto è che continua a non interessarmi. Che chiudano i locali, i bar, le discoteche. A me non interessa. Voglio vedere andar tutto a puttane, che bruci tutto. Poi si vedremo.

Big state and/or big corp, most people dislike either or both. In any case I prefer the distributed ownership structure of renewables. It's a more democratic distribution of power.

&gt;Also ""potentially catastrophic"" isn't really catastrophic if you take it seriously. Chernobyl was negligence.

And somehow people will stop from being ever negligent from June 2014 onwards?

&gt;Clean up what? the disasters? Yeah they happend some time ago but rarely happends. Only Fukushima disaster has happend since Chernobyl if you count nuclear plants. Considering there are over 400 reactors in the world which are operational.

That's a whole lot considering only a fraction of our energy is being supplied by them, and every time that happens we lose a huge area for undeterminate time. Not to mention that the countries who use it are the most advanced, so heaven help us if less advanced countries start doing it.

&gt;Science fiction doesn't come from nowhere. 

Where are our flying cars then?

&gt;Fusion powerplants are under construction and we went from computers which were building sized to pocket sized.

&gt; That's a whole lot considering only a fraction of our energy is being supplied by them, and every time that happens we lose a huge area for undeterminate time.

Around 13% including countries who doesn't use nuclear power. Only 31 countries use nuclear power and use it half-assedly. I'd rather take nuclear power over fossile fuels.

Yes... So what's your argument for advanced countries not to use it?

We have helicopters and aeroplanes. We also have rockets. What's your point?

Why stop developing a very promising technology? You can mutually research both nuclear power and solar energy. One doesn't exclude another. I really look forward to the age of solar cells but I also believe nuclear energy will be a big part of that world.

---

La guerre est gagnée. Voici la victoire. C'est la victoire des Nations Unies et c'est la victoire de la France. L'ennemi allemand vient de capituler devant les armées alliées de l'Ouest et de l'Est. Le commandement français était présent et partie à l'acte de capitulation. 

Dans l'état de désorganisation où se trouvent les pouvoirs publics et le commandement militaire allemand, il est possible que certains groupes ennemis veuillent, ça et là, prolonger pour leur propre compte, une résistance sans issue. Mais l'Allemagne est abattue et elle a signé son désastre. 

Tandis que les rayons de la gloire vont, une fois de plus, resplendir au drapeau, la patrie porte sa pensée et son amour, d'abord, vers ceux qui sont morts pour elle, ensuite, vers ceux qui ont, pour son service, tant combattu et tant souffert. Pas un effort de ces soldats, de ces marins, de ces aviateurs, pas un acte de courage ou d'abnégation de ses fils et de ses filles, pas une souffrance de ces hommes et de ces femmes prisonniers, pas un deuil, pas un sacrifice, pas une larme n'auront donc été perdus. 

Dans la joie et dans la fierté nationale, le peuple français adresse son fraternel salut à ses vaillants alliés qui, comme lui, pour la même cause que lui, ont durement, longuement prodigué leurs peines. 

A leurs héroïques armées et aux chefs qui les commandent, à tous ces hommes et à toutes ces femmes qui, dans le monde, ont lutté, pâti, travaillé pour que l'emportent, à la fin des fins, la justice et la liberté, 

Honneur ! Honneur pour toujours à nos armées et à leurs chefs, Honneur à notre peuple que des épreuves terribles n'ont pu réduire ni fléchir, Honneur aux Nations Unies qui ont mêlé leur sang à notre sang, leurs peines à nos peines, leur espérance à notre espérance et qui, aujourd'hui, triomphent avec nous.

Buchstaben des Alphabetes und dient als Abkürzung für den Gruss «Heil Hitler», ist im Internet-Lexikon Wikipedia nachzulesen. Ausserdem steht 88, wenn man das Alphabet von hinten abzählt, für die Buchstaben SS.

&gt; Aber «Honni soit qui mal y pense» – ein Schelm, wer Böses dabei denkt. Denn in der Amateur-Funk-Sprache steht die 88 als Abkürzung für «Liebe und Küsse». Und im chinesischen Chat bedeutet sie nur ein simples «byebye», da die Zahl 8 im Chinesischen «ba» oder «bai» ausgesprochen wird. Überhaupt gilt in China die 8 und die Doppelacht als Glückszahl. Telefonnummern und Auto-Kennzeichen mit diesen Endziffern sind sehr beliebt. In Hongkong werden Unsummen für so ein Kfz-Kennzeichen bezahlt. Auch das Grundprinzip im Feng Shui, die Erlangung von Harmonie und Gleichgewicht, basiert auf der Glückszahl 8. Der Doppelacht – 88 – wird eine harmonisierende und ausgleichende Wirkung beigemessen.

That's the whole problem. They do not govern to do good things, they govern in order to satisfy their own supporters group. You build up a group of supporters, then you convince a lot of other people to vote for you so you can get more seats and then you govern in favor of that first group of supporters, instead of everyone who voted for you.

&gt; Even then I would argue that some decisions that seem unpopular may actually be popular. It's just that the people who like it say nothing and people who don't like it make lots of noise causing it to appear unpopular.

The effect this has is highly exaggerated. The more popular something the government does, the higher the trust in that government. Why wouldn't you trust someone who governs in the way you expected of them when you voted? Seems like the person that will keep his political promises. The fact that government trust is at an all time low, shows that governments have been making unpopular decisions election after election. Every time a government rules, people accuse them of not fulfilling their promises. That's because they govern in the interest of their backbone, rather than the voters which they persuaded with empty political rhetoric.

But neither of those sad fucks had any balls either. Hitler in last days blamed everyone but himself for the disaster, spent his time ordering people to effectively destroy the country to fuck over the 'weak' Germans and finally took a poison pill rather than face his enemies face to face.

Mussolini got ousted by his own party, then Nazi commandos freed him and he let himself be used as a mouthpiece for a Nazi puppet state in Northern Italy. When defeat approached he tried to negotiate with Italian resistance fighters for safe passage to Switzerland, but when that failed he disguised himself as German soldier and hid in the back of a military truck heading North. He was captured hiding behind another uniform and a dozen fighting men and did not resist.

And people stay people, and cutting corners is always cheaper.

13% of electricity (less than renewables right now, by the way), about 3% of total energy use.

&gt;Yes... So what's your argument for advanced countries not to use it?

They aren't infallible either and still have to deal with all the other problems.

&gt;We have helicopters and aeroplanes. We also have rockets. What's your point?

They had those already at that time. Point is that flying cars never became as common, cheap and reliable as predicted. You can never tell which prediction will come true. Trusting that you specific pet prediction will, is folly.

&gt;Why stop developing a very promising technology?

Because we're still nowhere after 50 years and more of lavish funding, and research requires ever more money for ever less result. We've plucked the low-hanging fruit, time to move on.

&gt;You can mutually research both nuclear power and solar energy. 

With unlimited budgets, sure. But budgets are never unlimited, and policy needs priorities.

&gt;Also ""they predicted"" isn't a valid argument. People in the early 1900s thought fossile fuels was a clean source of energy. You can't ask unqualified people about the future, obviously you'll get skewed answers.

Good, so I can ignore the wild predictions about fusion energy in 2000 about possible gains in 2050.

&gt;une devaluation temporaire n'a pas grand chose a voir avec un retour au FF

Le retour au FF est fait POUR la dévaluation. Et l'étude du CAE ne parle pas de dévaluation ""temporaire"", notion qui n'a d'ailleurs aucun sens, toute dévaluation étant définitive.

&gt;Les taux d'interets augmenteront car l'euro permet d'assurer un certain rendement qui garde un taux au alentour de 2%

???

Ça n'a aucun sens. Comment une devise permet d'assurer un rendement obligataire ?

Le rendement d'une obligation dépend de quoi à ton avis (c'est une question rhétorique, je connais la réponse, je bosse pour une banque) ?

En quoi ""l'euro permet d'assurer un certain rendement"" ?

En Espagne ou au Portugal, l'euro permet d'assurer un rendement ? À Chypre, l'euro permet d'assurer un rendement ?

&gt;On projete une hausse du taux vers les 5% en cas de passage au FF

Taux réel ou nominal ?

Si l'inflation augmente de 5%, la hausse des taux réels est nulle.

Et comme dit dans ta citation, cette projection est complètement fictive vu qu'un passage au FF ferait exploser l'euro.

&gt;Voila pourquoi le FN retorque qu'en fait ils n'ont pas besoin des marchés pour se financer mais qu'ils préconisent plutot la planche a billet

Source ?

Le FN a toujours parlé d'une création monétaire contrôlée et limitée à son rôle : soutenir l'investissement et préparer l'avenir.

&gt;Quand je parle de renegociation de la dette, je parle de negoce avec les créanciers

Et je te réponds qu'il n'y a rien à négocier avec les créanciers, d'une part l'euro n'existera plus, d'autre part les créanciers n'ont pas leur mot à dire sur la souveraineté de la France. Ils ont pris des risques, ce qui justifie leur taux d'intérêt, ils en assument les conséquences.

&gt;Entre parentheses, belle tentative de brouillage des pistes avec ton imbroglio taux nominal / taux reel cela dit.

... 

C'est une notion fondamentale en économie. Le taux nominal ne veut rien dire : au sein d'une même devise il faut prendre en compte l'inflation, et entre devises il faut prendre en compte non seulement les différentes inflations mais en plus le taux de change.

I wouldn't don't necessarily agree with that. Parties can't falsely convince other people to vote for them without disastrous consequences. An example of this happening in the UK would be Lib Dems and tuition fees. The Liberal Democrats made a flagship policy to abolish university fees. When they entered a coalition with the Conservative they had ended up increasing tuition fees by 200%. The party has since become massively unpopular. 

The only way i'd agree with this is multiple round voting where second round voting only includes the top two. One could be voting where all the candidates are undesirable.

The thing is, a dictatorial system doesn't give a fuck about who you'd give power to. So that's a highly self-defeating statement what you make.

&gt;Trust in the government would be much higher if the government acted like we wanted

No. I completely disagree. Most people disagree about what they want, so in that case trust in government would be impossible. To gain trust, a government has to take into account the concerns of the people. That's all that matters.

&gt;In this case it acts the same. Low government trust means that people aren't accepting what it's doing. This means that for the past couple decades, the percentage of people that 'accepted' government policies has been dropping.

No, this has little to do with policies, but with inclusion in decision-making. Making different decisions with the same methods will *not* increase trust in government.

Yeah sorry. It usually just escalade but I see what you mean. Why I disagree is simply because I dislike ackumulative kapitalism. If private people owned nuclear plants they would have a lot of power, which is best kept in the hands of the government. Wether that's a good or a bad belief is not worthy of a discussion.

&gt; And people stay people, and cutting corners is always cheaper.

This is the main concern with a distributed ownership. The state doesn't like cutting corners as much as companies.

&gt; 13% of electricity (less than renewables right now, by the way), about 3% of total energy use.

Yes, however if you include all of the windfarms and hydroelectric power etc they make up a lot of infrastructure which doesn't really generate as much electricity as nuclear power by the area. You can basically replace all of the hydroelectric powerplants in Sweden (around 1100) with just a few nuclear powerplants. Besides not all of the ""renewables"" are environmentally friendly. Every single one has a pro and a con.

&gt; They aren't infallible either and still have to deal with all the other problems.

Nothing is. But we have above 400 nuclear powerplants and we've had two serious accidents, one 2011 because of a tsunami and one 1986 due to negligence. That's in my opinion not enough to decredit nuclear power as an energy source.

&gt; They had those already at that time. Point is that flying cars never became as common, cheap and reliable as predicted. You can never tell which prediction will come true. Trusting that you specific pet prediction will, is folly.

Saying nuclear power will be a part of the future is not an empty prediction, unlike flying cars. Besides flying cars might become common, cheap and reliable. You're making the same mistake yourself by discrediting them.

&gt; Because we're still nowhere after 50 years and more of lavish funding, and research requires ever more money for ever less result. We've plucked the low-hanging fruit, time to move on.

We've only reserched one type of nuclear power because it can easily be weaponized. [Wiki has a good article on nuclear power.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power)

&gt; With unlimited budgets, sure. But budgets are never unlimited, and policy needs priorities.

The majority of the costs are just building the plants and the fuels are actually quite cheap. There is a lot to be researched in both fields. What you're saying is to basically shut down the Hadron collider which is not a good idea.

But some have and it is that what we're focusing on. You can't base it on what happens in some cases. A dictatorship applied well is better than a failing democracy. Just because some dictatorships are evil, doesn't mean that all dictatorships are evil.

&gt; The thing is, a dictatorial system doesn't give a fuck about who you'd give power to. So that's a highly self-defeating statement what you make.

A dictatorial system can be put in place willingly and it can be removed. The difference between a democracy is that in a dictatorial system the power is given to a small group or person and that decisions can't be opposed. Only in a few cases. The fact that decisions can't be opposed doesn't mean you can't create a dictatorial system in which a dictator can be put in and out of office without the corruption, power abuse and behind-the-scenes planning associated with the stereotypical dictatorship.

&gt; Again, at that point it's too late to disagree.

No it's not. If you apply a trias politica you can keep it in check. If you create a juridical body that can remove dictators when they use excessive violence. A separate juridical body can install a dictator removing the problems with succession.

&gt; Democracy was gradually built up since the fall of the Roman Empire, it's not something that is installed overnight.

The date at which voting rights we're given didn't happen over the centuries, it happened in a few decades. The Netherlands has been a democracy since 1848. The 3rd of November 1848 the country became a parliamentary democracy when direct voting for the second chamber was installed.

http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grondwetsherziening_1848

&gt; No. I completely disagree. Most people disagree about what they want, so in that case trust in government would be impossible. To gain trust, a government has to take into account the concerns of the people. That's all that matters.

It's pretty clear what people are concerned about.

It's pretty clear what people worry about the most. The government successfully tackling these issues could immensely boost government trust.

&gt; Making different decisions with the same methods will not increase trust in government. 

It will if those decisions actually work. If you can make a decision that leads to solution of problem that works, people don't care how you decided. I don't care whether someone guessed the right solution or did a yearlong study around it.

&gt; Another piece from Wynne Godley in 1997 referenced [here](http://www.concertedaction.com/2011/11/07/curried-emu/) refines his argument further:

&gt;&gt;First of all, if a government stops having its own currency, it doesn't give up just 'control over monetary policy' as normally understood; its spending powers also become constrained in an entirely new way. If a government does not have its own central bank on which it can draw checks freely, its expenditure can be financed only by borrowing in the open market in competition with business firms, and this may prove excessively expensive or even impossible, particularly under ‘conditions of extreme emergency’.

&gt; &gt;...if Europe is not to have a full-scale budget of its own under the new arrangements it will still have, by default, a fiscal stance of its own made up of the individual budgets of component states. The danger, then, is that the budgetary restraint  to which governments are individually committed will impart a disinflationary bias that locks Europe as a whole into a depression it is powerless to lift.

true,Louisbeta,null,null,"""La legge elettorale del Movimento 5 Stelle, costruita insieme, sul blog, è realtà. È un fatto storico, un fatto unico, abbiamo dimostrato che la democrazia diretta può essere attuata in sostituzione della democrazia rappresentativa; non più delega in bianco ma i cittadini possono partecipare direttamente alla costruzione delle leggi. Lo abbiamo fatto con la legge elettorale: 40.000 cittadini iscritti al blog hanno contribuito alla costruzione, passo dopo passo, di tutti gli articoli della legge elettorale. Questa legge elettorale dà per la prima volta ai cittadini il vero potere di decidere. I cittadini potranno, come avete deciso, come abbiamo deciso, scegliere i propri candidati con la preferenza. Non ci saranno più le coalizioni non ci sarà più un premio di maggioranza. Ciò significa che gli eletti, rappresentanti della sovranità popolare in Parlamento, dipenderanno dai cittadini e non più dal capo politico.
Questo lo abbiamo ottenuto inserendo accanto alle preferenze positive (perché, come potete vedere, queste sono le due schede: la prima scheda, quella alla mia sinistra, è la scheda dove si voterà la forza politica. Qui si potrà segnare la forza politica e si potrà anche cancellare - per una o due volte - dei candidati impresentabili), il cosiddetto voto negativo. Come vi ricorderete abbiamo, in una delle otto votazioni, scelto il panachage, cioè due schede: una si vota il partito, l’altra il voto di preferenza. Una volta segnata una X su una forza politica, se all'interno dei candidati ci saranno degli impresentabili, dei collusi con la mafia, della gente che ha speso troppo per la campagna elettorale e quindi si è troppo esposta e che non piace ad un elettorato consapevole ed intelligente, lo potremo cancellare. E sapete che cosa comporta questo? Che i partiti saranno obbligati ad inserire gente credibile, onesta e competente e questo perché il vostro voto negativo comporta la cancellazione di una porzione di voto. In questo caso ci sono 10 candidati, se voi cancellate uno di questi candidati significa che la forza politica votata perderà un decimo del voto e la conseguenza diretta è semplicissima: i partiti e le forze politiche non potranno mettere in lista cosiddetti 'impresentabili' altrimenti i cittadini gli faranno perdere voti. Il potere quindi torna in mano ai cittadini e gli eletti dovranno rispondere ai cittadini. L'altra conseguenza, ancora più importante, è una delle nostre battaglie ovvero sia il vincolo di mandato. Ebbene noi inseriamo il vincolo di mandato senza modificare la Costituzione. Sapete come lo facciamo? Col fatto che se l'eletto non mantiene le promesse in Parlamento i cittadini non lo voteranno più e non potrà più fare politica perché non ha mantenuto le promesse.
Oggi sapete tutti che con quella schifezza del ‘porcellum' e con quel iper schifezza dell’Italicum la rielezione di un parlamentare, di un politico, dipende esclusivamente dal capo. Noi abbiamo eliminato i premi di maggioranza, eliminato le coalizioni, i partiti si presentano da soli, i partiti piccoli sono obbligati ad unirsi altrimenti - con il sistema che abbiamo votato - saranno svantaggiati, quindi abbiamo ottenuto anche l’effetto e l'obiettivo della governabilità sana e, di conseguenza, gli eletti: o rispondono a quello che hanno promesso, continuano a parlare con i cittadini, continuano a spiegare le loro decisioni e portare in Parlamento le istanze e i desideri dei cittadini, oppure la politica per loro non sarà più una professione. Questo veramente è un momento straordinario, questo è il più grande successo del Movimento 5 Stelle, è il più grande e sublime esempio di partecipazione diretta, di democrazia diretta. In alto i cuori.""

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt; Yeah sorry. It usually just escalade but I see what you mean. Why I disagree is simply because I dislike ackumulative kapitalism. If private people owned nuclear plants they would have a lot of power, which is best kept in the hands of the government. Wether that's a good or a bad belief is not worthy of a discussion.

That's the reason why I oppose big plants at all: either in government hands or private hands, they're a concentration of power. Small renewable plants are distributed in ownership, and therefore the profits and the power are distributed too.

&gt;This is the main concern with a distributed ownership. The state doesn't like cutting corners as much as companies.

Other people will argue that it doesn't like to be cost-efficient enough. A few or a single big private companie (inevitable with nuclear) is the worst of both worlds: privatized profits *and* no alternative.

&gt;Yes, however if you include all of the windfarms and hydroelectric power etc they make up a lot of infrastructure which doesn't really generate as much electricity as nuclear power by the area.

Did you account for uranium mining then?

&gt;Nothing is. But we have above 400 nuclear powerplants and we've had two serious accidents, one 2011 because of a tsunami and one 1986 due to negligence. That's in my opinion not enough to decredit nuclear power as an energy source.

And a lot of near misses, for example in the UK they're also a reactor that they just had to cover up and let cool down, because they don't know an alternative.

&gt;Saying nuclear power will be a part of the future is not an empty prediction, unlike flying cars.

Again, no argument. 

&gt;Besides flying cars might become common, cheap and reliable. You're making the same mistake yourself by discrediting them.

They didn't arrive in 50-100 years, which is the timescale within which we need alternatives.

&gt;We've only reserched one type of nuclear power because it can easily be weaponized. Wiki has a good article on nuclear power.

Breeders etc. have been under investigation ever since the beginning. If we need 50 years to research the next, that makes it useless as a part of the energy supply.

&gt;The majority of the costs are just building the plants and the fuels are actually quite cheap.

The costs of caring for the cleanup - accidents or no accidents - are very fuzzy, and they're shoved off to our descendants: those are two 

The fuels are subsidized by cold war budgets (old nuclear weapons are being used up), we're mining only 2/3 of what we consume, and the ores are getting progressively less rich, so they will become more expensive over time... and they require a lot of heavy machinery, so the rising oil prices will make uranium more expensive too.

&gt;There is a lot to be researched in both fields. What you're saying is to basically shut down the Hadron collider which is not a good idea.

Just like ITER, the Hadron Collider is fundamental research. Worthwhile on its own, but it should not be confused with a contribution to energy production.

&gt;They're made by qualified people. They're actually building a fusion reactor.

Their predictions vary from 2050 to 2100. It's a research experiment, they can't predict the results *by definition*.

Should I vote for a tax raise? How do I pick - I have 2 opposing guys both supported by ph.ds of economics ARGUING before me and each one is supported by some part of economic theory so can't really be accused of lying or misinformation.

2: parts they can understand cannot be verified/proven: eg. party A says only 30 percent of country X voted for their government so it's not a legal government, we should approve our vote in UN to send in armed forces. Well ""A"" didn't really lie so it's not legally ""misinformation"" except that B says 30% of population vote was out of 40% turnout - but how much high school does one need to remember to understand that first number is irrelevant without a second and to know whether X has a legit government?

true,kicker7955,ROMA,Romania,"&gt;On 4 November 2009, the nuclear power regulatory authorities in France, Finland and the United Kingdom issued a joint letter to Areva, citing serious problems with the EPR's digital Instrumentation and Control systems (I&amp;C).[8] The letter stated:
""The issue is primarily around ensuring the adequacy of the safety systems (those used to maintain control of the plant if it goes outside normal conditions), and their independence from the control systems (those used to operate the plant under normal conditions).
Independence is important because, if a safety system provides protection against the failure of a control system, then they should not fail together. The EPR design, as originally proposed by the licensees and the manufacturer, AREVA, doesn’t comply with the independence principle, as there is a very high degree of complex interconnectivity between the control and safety systems.""

Those safety concerns where there before Fukushima, and the new regulations did not affect the initial design. I believe the model did not need updated at all as it is still the only one allowed to be contracted within the US. But like I mentioned in a previous comment you can imagine how tense the relation becomes between Areva and its clients, just on the basis of a paranoid reactive populace and spineless ignorant politicians.

true,IntelligentNickname,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; That's the reason why I oppose big plants at all: either in government hands or private hands, they're a concentration of power. Small renewable plants are distributed in ownership, and therefore the profits and the power are distributed too.

Why would it be power in the hands of the government? They can't exactly threaten to shut it down.

&gt; Other people will argue that it doesn't like to be cost-efficient enough.

The main costs are building the plant. It's not worth cutting corners in this particular field. While I do agree corruption could be prevelant, it most likely isn't to a large scale.

&gt; Did you account for uranium mining then?

Yes. Uranium mines are very few compared to other types of mines.

One could argue it takes metal to build hydroelectric plants and windfarms, which is also mined.

&gt; And a lot of near misses, for example in the UK they're also a reactor that they just had to cover up and let cool down, because they don't know an alternative.

Was anyone hurt and was there any fallout? I know US has had the majority of accidents (around 60%).

&gt; Breeders etc. have been under investigation ever since the beginning. If we need 50 years to research the next, that makes it useless as a part of the energy supply.

Do you have an article or is it purely speculation?

&gt; The costs of caring for the cleanup - accidents or no accidents - are very fuzzy, and they're shoved off to our descendants

I'm not sure what you refer to by ""cleanup"" but if you're talking about waste, it's not really a huge issue.

&gt; The fuels are subsidized by cold war budgets (old nuclear weapons are being used up), we're mining only 2/3 of what we consume, and the ores are getting progressively less rich, so they will become more expensive over time... and they require a lot of heavy machinery, so the rising oil prices will make uranium more expensive too.

Do you have a source?

&gt; Just like ITER, the Hadron Collider is fundamental research. Worthwhile on its own, but it should not be confused with a contribution to energy production.

ITER and LGC both research high energy particles. This is nuclear research.

First, lets not say feds outlaw all guns, because that just furthers the pro-gun advocates and their countless strawman arguments already in place. Let's imagine a federal gun control system similar to Europe's. There's nothing wrong with sports and hunting within controlled circumstances.

Whether that's from the stricter (English) or more allowing (Scandinavia) end of the stick can be up for debate, but in any case would mean taking medical, psychological, gun safety and use examinations with full background checks and annual re-certifications. 

Install this, revoke public access to a select list of guns and tools that have no justifiable public uses beside the MUH GUNS obsession (assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, hollow point bullets) and...wait 30-40 years while sticking to the rules. Yes, even with a Republican president. 

Monitor the secondary markets (i.e. gun repair accessories, machinery needed to produce ammunition at home, etc.) and draw them inside the legal channels. Enforce gun safety rules and tighten them. In Hungary certain guns for sports use cannot be stored at the individual's home in gun cabinets, they must remain at the shooting range unless it is for something extraordinary (competition, repair). 

They couldn't do much better than simply wait for the guns already at the public's hand to rot away and prevent them from being replaced. Naturally that would require a public agreement that their present system is very, very subpar and reducing public access to arms would be beneficial in the long run.

Just to elaborate a bit more; state schools tend to be very good at the hard sciences whilst private and public schools tend to do very well and social sciences and hard sciences. However, what they all fail monumentally to do, is teach things like life skills and and citizenship. There does exist a citizenship class which explains different kinds of values and how the political process works, but nobody was willing to remove anything in school time tables in order to fit citizenship classes in and therefor it just didn't fit and is hardly taught. RE is similar, even though its implementation isn't quite as egregious. RE is focused, to the detriment of everything else, at Christianity. You can choose to do Islam *et al* in your exam, but for a whole variety of reasons everybody always fails. 

People leave schools having been taught next to nothing about the society they live in, and next to nothing about their political system or the political debates which are taking place.

In that time I have removed over 400posts for not following subreddit guidelines. In addition to my moderation responsibilities I am one of the most active writers on knowyourmeme.com. You think I don't know memes? Then how do I write articles about them on a site called knowyourmeme?

Several companies have asked me to review their meme ads to avoid a failure like Toyota's meme commercial. Just last week a major food company contacted me with a paid offer to help them on a new ad campaign. I declined when I researched the company and saw that they had contributed money to socially conservative groups.

Idem, senza polemica e poi ti direi che possiamo chiudere che mi sembra che di questa discussione non freghi niente a nessuno a parte noi due...

0) certo, a Parigi sarebbero pochi, ma vive a Le Creusot (se non l'hai mai sentita é perché é il buco di culo della Francia) e lí sono un sacco di soldi. Lo stesso ragionamento peró é valido in Italia. Se 1050 ti possono ancora bastare a Verona, prova a viverci a Roma o Milano.
Non é una argomentazione valida...

1) Qua non ti so rispondere, so per certo che é quello che prende lui, ma so anche che dove sono io gli stipendi cambiano a seconda della disciplina e quelli in ingegneria sono i piú pagati. Magari é lo stesso in Francia?

2) Non si tratta solo di attirare stranieri, ma di attirare studenti di qualitá. Se uno dopo la sua magistrale applica per due posizioni di dottorato, una in Italia e una in un altro paese in cui lo pagano meglio, cosa lo spinge a scegliere quella con lo stipendio piú basso, a parte che l'Italia é tantobbella? Chiaro, c'é di mezzo il prestigio dell'universitá, del gruppo di ricerca e del supervisor e altri fattori, ma non é che le universitá italiane siano cosí ben piazzate. Il discorso cambia per i ricercatori, ma spesso (non sempre) quelli famosi lavorano, appunto, all'estero.
Con questo ovviamente non voglio dire che sei fai un dottorato in Italia sei uno scemo. L'ho preso seriamente in considerazione io stesso e alcuni miei amici che ritengo brillanti lo fanno in Italia. 
Quello che voglio dire é: formare uno studente a livello universitario in uni pubblica costa un macello allo stato e poi ci facciamo rubare i alcuni (molti) dei migliori per non dargli 300€ in piú al mese? mi sembra una tipica stronzata all'Italiana.
Se poi in fisica i gruppi di ricerca migliori sono in Italia non posso darti torto, si vede che cambia tanto da campo a campo...

3) Capisco, rimane il fatto che NON é uno stipendio, ma una borsa di studio. Particolare non da poco secondo me.

Extra) Scusa se mi faccio i cazzi tuoi qua e sentiti libero di non rispondere, é solo curiositá. In che cittá vivi/studi?

Je sais pas de quel inconscient tu parles, mais l'inconscient et le libre arbitre, ne sont pas des notions antithétiques, bien au contraire, elles sont complémentaires et s'influencent réciproquement. Et puis si on devait faire la liste de ce qui détermine génétiquement, consciemment et inconsciemment un individu on en aurait pour longtemps. Le but d'un travail analytique c'est d'être adapté à soi même. Si un individu est persuadé d'être déterminé c'est son problème, et si un autre pense comme toi, c'est le même problème : tout ce qui importe c'est que ça pas source de souffrance.

&gt;Croire que l'on est déterminé, c'est accepter de se laisser dépasser ; se reposer sur autre chose.


Je suis tout à fait d'accord. Et cette idée là se retrouve très bien dans les mythes, la religion, et les délires des psychotiques : être persuadé qu'on est le fils de la reine d'Angleterre peut être bien plus rassurant que de s'être fait tabasser tout les jours sans raison pendant quinze ans. Mais justement le déterminisme c'est l'antithèse de la psychanalyse ; c'est par contre plutôt vers là que la médecine et la génétique se dirigent.


Pour après mélanger ça à la justice ; là encore, c'est différent, on parle de société, et non plus d'individu. C'est pas parce que quelqu'un va tenter d'expliquer un meurtre dans la dynamique psychique du meurtrier en question que ça l'excuse de quoi que ce soit au regard de la société où il vit. Ça n'a rien à voir.

&gt;Da die großen Nachrichtenmagazine wie SPIEGEL, SZ, ZEIT usw. das Thema bisher noch nicht behandeln und mehrfach nach meinen Quellen gefragt wurde, there you go:

&gt;Über TISA und die Konsequenzen macht vor allem""Public Services International“ aufmerksam, der internationale Dachverband des öffentlichen Dienstes (vertritt 20 Millionen Angestellte weltweit, die vom Abkommen direkt betroffen wären). Er hat hier eine sehr gute Übersicht über TISA zusammengestellt (Mitglieder, Ziele, Folgen):
„Public Services International brief on the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA)“
http://www.world-psi.org/sites/default/files/documents/research/en_psi_tisa_policy_brief_july_2013_final_web.pdf
Begleitender Artikel bzw. Kurzfassung gibt es hier:
„PSI Special Report: TISA versus Public Services“
http://www.world-psi.org/en/psi-special-report-tisa-versus-public-services 
Weiterer Artikel dazu hier:
„New global threat to public services“
http://www.world-psi.org/en/new-global-threat-public-services

&gt;In deutscher Sprache hat Franziska „Ska“ Keller, derzeit Spitzenkandidatin der Europäischen Grünen für die Europawahl vor dem Abkommen gewarnt:
http://www.ska-keller.de/de/themen/handel-und-entwicklung/entwicklungspolitisches/tisa,-das-neue-abkommen-zum-handel-mit-dienstleistungen-%E2%80%93-kein-multilateralismus,-keine-transparenz  

&gt;Auch die Piratenpartei behandelt das Thema und bereitet aktuell eine Petition im Bundestag gegen TISA vor.
https://www.piratenpartei.de/2014/03/27/diesmal-heisst-es-tisa   

&gt;Die australische Regierung informiert auf ihrem Online-Auftritt regelmäßig über die TISA-Verhandlungen, beschränkt sich dabei überwiegend auf Positiv-Meldungen:
https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/negotiations/services/trade-in-services-agreement.html 

&gt;In ähnlich positiver Weise fasst hier die Europäische Kommission das TISA-Abkommen zusammen.
http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/june/tradoc_151374.pdf 

&gt;Weitere Hintergründe liefert das Europäische Parlament:
http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eplibrary/Opening-negotiations-on-a-plurilateral-Trade-in-Services-Agreement-TiSA-DE.pdf 

&gt;In den „klassischen“ Medien gibt es dazu noch relativ wenig. Hier dennoch eine Auswahl:
„Privatisierung der Grundversorgung?“(Deutschlandradio)
http://www.deutschlandradiokultur.de/handelspolitik-privatisierung-der-grundversorgung.1008.de.html?dram:article_id=283940

&gt;Ich hoffe, ich konnte helfen. Kann die Nachfragen aber verstehen, wirkt immer erst mal komisch, wenn irgendein Typ aus seinem Wohnzimmer raus „Gefaaahr“ ruft, bei Sachen, die man aus der Presse noch nicht kennt. Meine Quellen sind aber keine Verschwörungs-Blogs oder Illuminaten-Foren, sondern die offiziellen Auftritte von Politikern und Institutionen. Was das ganze irgendwie nur noch gruseliger macht.

In più un certo rapporto non sempre pregiudizialmente ostile con Berlusconi lo ha consegnato alla cronaca come un maneggione che voleva accordarsi con Silvio per ottenere potere. A mio giudizio era un normale dialogo politico con il principale oppositore, che non puoi ignorare.

Da lì è scaturita tutta una serie di attribuzioni di responsabilità a D'Alema (per me spesso un po' favolistiche), che parte dal siluraggio di Prodi (quando lo spedirono in Europa), fino ai famosi 101 che hanno silurato (di nuovo) il redivivo Prodi per impedirgli di arrivare al Quirinale.",0,1399565806,null,0,false,0,chcsz0l,t3_251c3k,t1_chcsz0l,t1_chcsnk3,null,1433707101,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

So whatever you do as a politician now you can't question the free market because it's not just a means of ""promoting the national economy"" but a way of forcing people to work hard for low wages and projecting Western purchasing power overseas, by dismantling foreign trade barriers, for example in Iraq almost immediately after the invasion, or in the recent Ukrainian trade deal.

I think you're right about that homogeneity and that's exactly the sort of problem critical theory speaks to. Certainly something like the EU would be presented by Critical theorists as an institution there to promote an agenda, that doesn't necessarily represent what's best for ordinary people. Someone like Farage, not fitting into the discourse which supports the EU, has to be presented as ""mad"" or ""weird"" because the media can't find the right theoretical tools to present him on equal footing with other politicians.

Tu as détourné la conversation [ici](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/24uu7g/berlin_torpille_la_derni%C3%A8re_offensive_de_paris/chbqqz4), tu t'en souviens ?

Tu as dit ""La devaluation peut en effet resoudre la compétitivité sur le court terme mais crée des dizaines d'autres problemes sur le coté""

Et comme problème de la **dévaluation**, tu cites ""les taux d'interets qui doubleront en passant en FF""

Tu vois donc que c'est toi qui mélanges tout.

Alors, quels sont les ""dizaines de problèmes de la dévaluation"" ?

Si la dévaluation n'a ""rien à voir"" avec un retour au franc, tu me dois des explications.

&gt;Comme déjà répété plusieurs fois: devaluation &lt;&gt; retour au FF

Lol. Cf au dessus. Tu te contredis tout seul.

&gt;Tu ne lis meme pas les études que tu link, c'est malin

Je t'ai déjà expliqué que ces effets sont largement compensés. S'il y a croissance supplémentaire, c'est que les effets positifs sont plus importants que les négatifs...

C'est un peu la base d'une politique économique...

&gt;C'est toi meme qui l'a affirmé au sujet du FN; c'est la planche a billet pour le décrire en terme plus familier

C'est une planche à billets contrôlée par l'État au lieu d'une planche à billet contrôlée par la BCE au service des banques comme c'est le cas [actuellement](http://www.creationmonetaire.info/2014/02/masse-monetaire-e-fevrier-2014.html). 

Dire ""planche à billets"" sans savoir ce qu'il y a derrière ou ce qui change n'a pas de sens.

De plus, la création monétaire que propose le FN est limitée et soumise à des objectifs d'inflation maximum.

&gt;La BCE tu connais ? Les taux directeurs ?

Hahaha. Oui, et qu'est-ce qui serait différent entre la BCE et la banque de France ?

Le taux directeur est le taux de refinancement des banques. Par contre, le ""rendement"" dont tu parles n'a strictement rien à voir. Quand la BCE baisse son taux (aujourd'hui à 0,25%), ça incite les banques à se financer auprès d'elle, mais ça ne ""garantie"" rien du tout, au contraire.

&gt;A ton avis, c'est quoi ? Tu te fous de moi ?

À mon avis tu ne sais pas ce dont tu parles. D'où ma question. Tu balances un 5% comme ça au hasard sans savoir d'où il vient.

&gt;Pas pour autant que tu seras une ""bête"" en macro économie.

Assez pour savoir de quoi dépend un rendement.

&gt;Et voila que tout ton argumentaire économique tombe a l'eau, a force de ressasser les arguments du FN vide de sens.

C'est un fait. Il n'y a pas à négocier avec les créanciers d'un passage à l'euro ou d'une dévaluation.

&gt;C'est ton argument face a tes créanciers inquiets ? Souveraineté francaise ? Quelle amateurisme.

Hahaha. Oui, les marchés sont inquiets, il faut les rassurer les pauvres...

Ce n'est pas la finance qui fait la loi. C'est l'économie réelle qui fait la finance. Mais évidemment, quand on est un soumis et un vaincu comme toi, on ne peut même pas imaginer faire peur aux pauvres petits marchés.

Les marchés veulent de la rentabilité, et c'est en redressant la situation économique qu'on obtient une meilleure rentabilité. Pas en se mettant à quatre pattes comme on le fait en ce moment.

&gt;Les créanciers ont évidemment leur mot à dire

Pas dans une dévaluation.

&gt;c'est eux qui te pretent l'argent, pas l'inverse !

C'est eux qui attendent qu'on les rembourse, pas l'inverse. C'est eux qui ont le plus à perdre, pas l'inverse.

&gt;S'opposer à eux, c'est le defaut de paiement à coup sur.

Il n'y a aucune logique dans ce que tu dis. Le défaut viendrait d'une initiative d'État, pas des créanciers qui refuseraient des conditions.

&gt;Ca sera renegocié

Tu crois vraiment que la France va négocier une augmentation de sa dette à la suite d'une dévaluation ?

Tu te mets sérieusement le doigt dans l’œil.

&gt;car les taux d’intérêts changeront aussi

Les taux des emprunts déjà souscrits ne changent pas. Les conditions des emprunts déjà souscrits ne changent pas non plus.

Il n'y a rien à négocier.

&gt;il admet lui meme que les consequences peuvent etres dramatiques au sujet de la dette publique

Absolument pas. Il montre que la dette publique **se réduit** en deux ans. Se réduit drastiquement d'ailleurs. Paragraphe E, graphique 7.

&gt;Donc au final, tu veux sortir de l'Euro ou dévalué l'Euro ?

https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/black-or-white

Au final, l'euro va exploser tout seul, la question n'est même pas de savoir ce que je veux. L'euro va exploser car la zone euro est non optimale et déséquilibrée, c'est inéluctable.

Could be. But think of this, landlords (and even tenants) advertise rooms on Airbnb or rent them to international students, which in turn rises rents so much that locals can't afford them. Locals are forced to move out of certain neighborhoods (the most touristic ones). In the end, those neighborhoods become a theme park, where only tourism-related businesses survive.

To top this, many renters don't even pay any taxes when they rent or subrent rooms, so that extra income does not benefit society in turn.

The only way to keep from making wildly wrong claims when asked to guess at statistics is to either already know the answer or have an understating of numbers and the ability to do some quick mental arithmetic and some quick sanity checks. This is a lot harder than it sounds.

Want to make an experiment?

Guess about the percentage of people in the US who have the last name ""**Smith**"".

Obviously you will know that it is a very common and perhaps you might even know that it is the most common surname in the US.

[The answer might surprise you.](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=percentage+of+people+named+smith)

This should have been easy to estimate simply based on your own experiences. You could have just made a quick estimate of the number of people named smith you personally know and the total number of acquaintances whose last name you know. Even without math you should be able to get a close answer based simply on 'feelings'.

Now if you have to make an answer that you can't get at from personal experience things get even harder. You have to base your estimate on second hand knowledge and if you go by 'feelings' you will end up basing your guess on how often you hear about things like that.

Since the news is far more likely to report ""man bites dog"" rather than ""dog bites man"" type of stories, you will for example end up thinking that men biting dogs are far more frequent than they really are.

I am completely in favor of central institutions, and Hayek was, too. A libertarian is not opposed to a central administration.

But, as we are speaking of socialism, I'm against the social ownership of the means of production. Because that's what socialism is about.

Btw, you are completely missing my point. I never spoke of capitalism, I just pointed out the extreme dangers of socialism. As in theory, and as observed in practice in every socialist state.

I hope the Euro Crisis will slowly subside and the Commission will have just a touch more room to breathe, especially given the idea that it will have a bit more legitimacy since the President will be voted in by the populace.

I don't see either the EPP or S&amp;D working too much on this issue nowaday, and it's not very high on the list of problems for populations of the member states themselves. The Greens are too busy pointing out who all the neofascists are, causing nothing but more of them to get voted in.

Because testifying in person is his best chance to safely stepping on Western soil again. Immunity would be part of the package. He would be limited to Germany, but while it doesn't have the beaches that Hawaii has, it still beats spending the rest of your life in Russia.

The problem is that this would require a lot of political will, and political will to piss off the US at that. This will just isn't there, because ""transatlantic relations"".

The way I see it, part of the reason why we ""can't"" grant him immunity is because it by now has been framed as something that's somehow not diplomatically possible. Somehow, the US and the UK could easily get away with saying that spying on allies was OK, because they pretended that this wasn't even in doubt.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Over here in Germany the law dictates that you have to try to get to safety/avoid a fight first and only if there's no reasonable way to avoid a confrontation with an intruder and he's clearly willing to use force then you are allowed to use deadly force to defend yourself.

My knowledge of law is very limited but AFAIK this is absolutely not true. German law is actually pretty extensive when it comes to self-defence. ""Recht muss Unrecht nicht weichen."" You are definitely not required to get to safety. In fact there isn't even a weighing of legally protected interests, exept for extreme imbalances. You are however required to use the mildest available means that has equal chance of success.

If a gun is involved there could however be some additional restrictions, i.e. you have to fire a warning shot first. But I'm not sure if that could be expected in a country that's drowning in guns, making it far more likely for the intruder to have a gun himself.

Now, in this case a couple of beers would indeed qualify as a ""Bagattele"", the purse however might very well justify deadly force (if the intruder actually tried to steal it).
However, the owner deliberately planted the purse there to provoke an intruder (Notwehrprovokation, arguably). In this case the victim can be expected to avoid confrontation or his right to self defence can be denied altogether.

&gt;German law values the life of a burglar more than the flatscreen in a home owners house, I guess in America its different.

This is just false/irrelevant, sorry. As I've said before, there is no weighing of interests. You can indeed defend your TV by killing the burglar, if there is no other way with the same chance of success.

This would not be possible without massive support from Russia, including weapons of all kinds, airplanes/helicopters complete with pilots, military advisors, and thousands of volunteers, including a ""Caucasus battalion"", led by Shamil Basayev, trained by Russia's GRU (this was before he and Russian gov't had their fallout, you see).

true,fungussa,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Global warming, yes, it does exist

Yeah, we can create a list of all of the factors which can either increase or decrease global temperature. Warming can be increased by changes to:

* the Earth's orbit, the tilt of its axis, Earth's precession etc
* an increase in solar radiation
* changes to albedo (deforestation and land use change)
* variations in the atmospheric concentrations of methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide.

[We know that the Sun has a perfect alibi, as it's in a solar minimum.](http://i.imgur.com/o9XowVJ.png)  
We know the period of the cycles, in the [Earth's tilt/precession/orbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles) etc, and therefore when that will cause warming; none of which accounts for the current warming.  
We know that large amounts of forested areas have been cleared for farming etc, and that does count for some warming.

.  
With everything considered, the current warming of 0.8 deg C is consistent with warming predicted by the increase in atmospheric concentrations of CH4,NO2 and CO2.

&gt; Archimedes' Principle

It only applies to sea-based ice, mainly the Arctic and sea-ice around the Antarctic. Yeah, so when it melts, sea level stays the same.

However, it doesn't apply to land based ice; Greenland, land-based Antarctic ice and glacial ice.

&gt; nothing bad will happen

Living in developed, relative wealthy countries, we won't have too much to worry about in the near term. If food prices etc go up, then I don't care if I have to spend $1 more for a loaf of bread; when a pint of beer costs £4.50, then a couple of quid for a loaf means nothing!

Because, you see, the conflict started, so who knows what would have happened if we weren't there.

Now imagine Russia is very weak for some reason, and another country applies the same reasoning to Chechnya, or Kalmykia, or another part of Russia. All it takes is for some rebels to do some shooting, and off they go, intervening. Then, after cleansing all the Russians from there, some dude will say ""Oh, those Russians? Well if it wasn't the Russians it would have been the Kalmyks, they started fighting on their own anyway, so ""my point still stands perfectly - it's their problem"".

If that's acceptable to you - no problem, it's just a difference of opinion at that point, and not hypocrisy.

&gt;Btw, why do you like to assume with that condescending tone of yours that i don't know the basic history or banned on wikipedia or something?

No condescension implied, I sincerely thought you're in need of reading up on the facts. Because to ask a question like ""Is Russia responsible for that in any way?"" either implies lack of knowledge or some kind of wilful ignorance and a twisted understanding of what intervention in foreign wars means.
