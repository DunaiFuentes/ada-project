As a matter of fact this was actually one of the major problems when the war dragged on, since the german economy was nowhere near total war production as opposed to the Soviet union or great Britain. Hitler feared another revolt as it had happened in 1918, so he ordered that the industry should still be oriented towards commerce. This was also one of the reasons why Speer was so successfull in 1944 because he switched the economy towards total war. Second, the public debt in 1938 was actually smaller then it was in 1933; relative to the GNP. While it is certainly true that the war was needed for the further success of the economy, the argument could be made that an alternative would have been to switch towards an export oriented industry. Difficult yes, but similar problems were solved by the US after the war. Third, the help from the Marshall plan never covered the sum which had to be paid for the allied occupation force.

I think 'democratic legitimacy now' beats 'potential democratic legitimacy in the future', and I'm not even sure that the Parliament has the potential you think it does, not before a clearer European demos emerges at any rate. And if you think MEPS (a group whom voters, by their actions, clearly think are relatively less legitimate) standing up to national leaders (whom voters think are more legitimate) would develop the legitimacy of the Parliament, I just don't see it. In fact I think it would go the other way, being viewed by the public as another example of the emasculation of national governments, and a constitutionally dubious (no matter what a few council members 'silently agreed to' before the election) power grab by MEPs.

I'd be interested to hear what extra powers you think MEPs would need to make European elections first order elections with turnouts comparable to those of general elections? I don't think deciding on Commission President isone of them. And as an add on question, how popular do you think moving those powers away from member states would be?

Apologies in advance if I sound a bit rude, I'm just baffled at how the solution to the latest European election, with its feeble turnouts and the surge of extreme parties, on this sub anyway seems to be 'Give the guys you've never heard of and most likely haven't voted for more powers!'.

- Der Gewaltsame Umsturz den dem Rechte Sektor durchgezogen wurde ist legitim da **might makes right.** Hier gilt die Ukrainische Verfassung nicht.

- Für Donezk und für die Krim gilt die ukrainische Verfassung scheinbar **doch.** 

- Der Osten der Ukraine soll Poroschenko unterstützen weil sie in den **alternativenlosen Wahlen** die von den Putschisten gehalten wurden für ihn als für das kleinere Übel ausgesprochen haben. Dass die in den Umfragen der Maidanzeit unisono für Janukowitsch waren gilt nicht weil Janukowitsch vertrieben wurde. **Might makes Right.**

- Alle die irgendwie dagegen sind sind ""durchgedreht"" und sollten am besten einfach sterben weil man ja sie sonst töten muss.

Ob die Volksrepublik Donezk oder die Putschisten Kiew ""sogenannt"" sind soll bitte Putin mit Obama ausfechten. Auf solche Lappalien habe ich keine Lust. Donezk ist betont konservativ verglichen mit dem durchschnittlichen Ostler. Wenn du Publizisten aus der Ukraine willst gibt es den Eduard Sawenko, aus Charkow, und Michail Jelisarow, aus Lwow. 

Die Zukunft: Wenn man Mordandrohung gegen die Kämpfer an der Gegenseite wirft und generell ""den Arsch hinhält"" wird man niemanden ""auf das vernünftige Niveau runterschrauben"". Wenn Kiew Donezk runterschrauben wollte gäbe es sehr viele Möglichkeiten:

- Prozess den Scharfschützen und rechtsradikalen Ganoven, die in Kiew und in Odessa mit Vorsatz gemordet hatten. Selbes gilt für die Verbrecher, die überall randaliert haben. Viktoria Nuland muss wenigsten des Landes verwiesen werden. Obama muss sich entschuldigen.

- Man braucht dringend einen Verbot auf offen neonazistische Parteien und Vereinigungen. Denkmäler für Bandera müssen weg.

- Die ethnischen Russen in Donezk und, eventuell, der gesamte russischsprachige Osten der Ukraine brauchen Autonomie als Versicherung dass man in der Zukunft keine Schikanemasnahmen gegen die russische Sprache und gegen die östlichen Dialekte des Ukrainischen befürchten muss.

Den Deutschen und den Amerikanern geht es doch nur um NATO-Erweitung und um die Eroberung der Häfen und der Maschbaufabriken im Osten. Die machen für den bösen Bärenrussen die Waffen und konkurrieren dreist mit der Westlichen Firmen. Daran liegt dem Ostler nicht sehr viel. Bringt doch eure der Ukraine aufgezwungene Regierung zur Raison. Wenn die oberflächlichen Unterschiede ausgebügelt steht einer übernahme des Ostens nichts mehr im Wege. Oder glaubt ihr die Nazis könnten wieder was erstürmen?

Bis dahin muss ihr euch nicht wundern dass der sogenannte Präsident der Ukraine in Donezk nicht viel mehr Legitimität hat als einst Erich Koch.

&gt;You make the case that every country was like Germany in your fourth paragraph, and that is just intellectually dishonest. Nazi Germany was not like all other imperialist countries. All other imperialist countries did not subscribe to the Nazi concept of Liebestraum, nor did you see other western powers engage in genocide against racial groups.

BTW Liebestraum means love dream, so I have no idea if they did or didn't have those, there was certainly romanticism around Imperialism.  Lebensraum (living space literally, but also in the sense of comfort) was something every imperial power had, which is why the British had settler colonies all over the world, the French colonized Algeria and considered it part of France proper, the Italians colonized Libya and Somalia and wanted to populate it with millions of people.  Britain and France used chemical weapons to pacify Iraq and North Africa respectively, while Britain in Indian murdered millions over hundreds of years.  Manifest Destiny was **exactly** Lebensraum, Hitler in fact explicitly referenced it was a model for his move to the East!  In fact the US was Hitler's model for his 1000 year Reich and motive to expand Eastward, read Adam Tooze's 'Wages of Destruction' for a full exploration of that relationship.  The US, Britain, Spanish, and French all contributed to the nearly complete genocide of the Native Americans; remember the trail of tears or the brutal slavery and extermination campaigns of the Spanish in Latin America?  Or the even more brutal chattel slavery of Brazil under the Portuguese that made the Confederacy look tame in comparison?  All of these histories, including the Armenian Genocide, influenced Hitler, who explicitly referred to each as a means to power for the 1000 year Reich, because he had working examples from recent history of them.  Of course he ran with the concepts and turned them up to 11.  

How about the differences between the Nuremburg laws and Jim Crow?  How many people died from lynchings in the South vs. Nazi murders of Jews pre-WW2?  The Australians/Brits virtually exterminated the native Australian peoples, while the Ottomans were pretty close to finishing off the Armenians as a people during WW1.  The Russians also brutally murdered Jews and various other peoples throughout its very bloody history; in WW1 Russia murdered more civilians than anyone in WW1, including the Ottomans, especially their own civilians!  Most Jews in the US are descended from survivors of Russian pogroms and other atrocities against Jews in Eastern Europe.

While its evident that the Nazi genocides were probably the most extreme in modern history (the Mongols get pride of place for their genocides), the history of the US is fraught with genocidal campaigns against native peoples in America and filled with brutal slavery against Africans.  It also started the Eugenics movement and was a model for the Nazis so much so that Hitler wrote FDR a congratulatory note for the number of forced sterilizations it committed before WW2.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States#Influence_on_Nazi_Germany
Also legal forced sterilizations still go on in women's prisons in the US today!

While I certainly appreciate your POV regarding what you perceive as my myopia on the subject of Germany, the original reason I was commenting on this thread was that it was about Germany and had responses as to why Germany behaved as it did in this period; of course the answers are Teutono-centric, because the thread itself is about Germany and its reactions to these things; I too am well versed in US history and to a lesser degree other European and Asian states, so I'm not fixated on just Germany, though German history is certainly a central hobby of mine, as it has played an important role in the modern formation of the international system we currently live in.  You are misrepresenting my points vis-a-vis Germany and WW2 and the equation of Germans with Nazism, which I am most certainly not, rather there were currents in German politics and the international system that the Nazism were able to ride to power and destroy most of Europe as a result.

&gt;War crimes have been broadly defined by the Nuremberg Principles as ""violations of the laws or customs of war,"" which includes massacres, bombings of civilian targets, terrorism, mutilation, torture, and murder of detainees and prisoners of war. Additional common crimes include theft, arson, and the destruction of property not warranted by military necessity.[194]

&gt;Human rights abuses in British concentration camps[edit]
In order to fight the Mau Mau insurgency during the conflict, British troops suspended civil liberties in Kenya. In response to the rebellion, many Kikuyu were relocated. **Between 320,000-450,000 of them were moved into concentration camps. Most of the remainder - more than a million - were held in ""enclosed villages"". Although some were Mau Mau guerillas, many were victims of collective punishment that colonial authorities imposed on large areas of the country. Thousands suffered beatings and sexual assaults during ""screenings"" intended to extract information about the Mau Mau threat. Later, prisoners suffered even worse mistreatment in an attempt to force them to renounce their allegiance to the insurgency and to obey commands. Significant numbers were murdered; official accounts describe some prisoners being roasted alive. Prisoners were questioned with the help of ""slicing off ears, boring holes in eardrums, flogging until death, pouring paraffin over suspects who were then set alight, and burning eardrums with lit cigarettes"". Castration by British troops and denying access to medical aid to the detainees were also widespread and common.** [195][196][197] Among the detainees who suffered severe mistreatment was Hussein Onyango Obama, the grandfather of U.S. President Barack Obama. **According to his widow, British soldiers forced pins into his fingernails and buttocks and squeezed his testicles between metal rods and two others were castrated.[198]**

&gt;In June 1957, Eric Griffith-Jones, the attorney general of the British administration in Kenya, wrote to the governor, Sir Evelyn Baring, detailing the way the regime of abuse at the colony's detention camps was being subtly altered. **He said that the mistreatment of the detainees is ""distressingly reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany or Communist Russia"".** Despite this, he said that in order for abuse to remain legal, Mau Mau suspects must be beaten mainly on their upper body, ""vulnerable parts of the body should not be struck, particularly the spleen, liver or kidneys"", and it was important that ""those who administer violence ... should remain collected, balanced and dispassionate"". He also reminded the governor that **""If we are going to sin,"" he wrote, ""we must sin quietly.""[198][200]**

&gt;We knew the slow method of torture [at the Mau Mau Investigation Center] was worse than anything we could do. Special Branch there had a way of slowly electrocuting a Kuke—they'd rough up one for days. Once I went personally to drop off one gang member who needed special treatment. I stayed for a few hours to help the boys out, softening him up. Things got a little out of hand. **By the time I cut his balls off, he had no ears, and his eyeball, the right one, I think, was hanging out of its socket. Too bad, he died before we got much out of him.[199]**

true,Neo24,null,null,"&gt; I think 'democratic legitimacy now' beats 'potential democratic legitimacy in the future', and I'm not even sure that the Parliament has the potential you think it does, not before a clearer European demos emerges at any rate.

Well, it's a bit of a chicken or egg situation. What comes first, a strong Parliament or a demos? One could just as well argue a clearer demos will never emerge without a strong Parliament around whose politics it can form. Of course, that brings up the question of whether a European demos should be pursued at all - disagreeing with that is a legitimate opinion, even though it's not one I share.

&gt; I'd be interested to hear what extra powers you think MEPs would need to make European elections first order elections with turnouts comparable to those of general elections? I don't think deciding on Commission President isone of them. And as an add on question, how popular do you think moving those powers away from member states would be?

Aside from electing the President (which is a power they ALREADY have by Treaty) I don't think they really need any specific additional powers. What needs to happen are two things: more and better media coverage, so people are actually informed about what the EU does and how it does it; and a more personalized politics, so voters have a clear link between how they voted and who leads the institutions. Judging by all the media focus on Juncker, I'd say the Spitzenkandidat system has already achieved some success in regards to these objectives.

I mean, the thing is, no one is really offering any alternatives. People always used to complain about the Council making decisions in backroom deals - but now suddenly everyone is OK with that? Don't get me wrong, but sometimes I think I have more appreciation for people who just want to scrap the whole thing.

Are YOU really happy with the EU and it's current level of legitimacy? If not, how would you fix it? Just keep the system as it is now?

First of all, great choice to spend some time in Germany! Berlin is, indeed, a very attractive place for artists of all kind, so you might have a great time in Berlin.

You will need a work permit to be able to start a career, in whatever business that is. Bar tending might probably not be the most sought after profession, so you might have a hard time getting a work permit for a job in that field - but maybe you can find a hotel or bar that is looking for your very specific skill set.

You mentioned two years of University, do you have a formal degree in something related to languages? If so, you might get hired as a language teacher, where being a native speaker with some experience in adult training is your key to getting a work permit and to meeting lots of people, which might be a plus for your career as an artist.

If you have a degree in another area, it might be something highly valued and would get you in as well.

The Queen is much loved, but Charles less so. Even if Charles weren't to take the throne I can't see Australia keeping the monarchy long after Elizabeth II is dead, and that could spark the debate in other countries. *If* that were to happen I don't think it is outside the realm of possibility that the debate could spread to the UK.

I might be off the mark a little but I think a lot of the respect (or admiration) for the Queen comes from the long reign, back to a time when the world was quite different. I must emphasise I don't the monarchy will be dropped any time soon (I'd guess the position of the monarchy would easily survive countries such as Australia going republic), I just think republicanism will become a bit more common over time.

Having said all that I think one of the biggest reasons the monarchy is probably here to stay is that even those, such as myself, who aren't fond of the monarchy, really aren't fussed either way.

Hitler was basically appointed on a threat by the German army, not by popular demand by the German people.  In fact from 1933-45 over 3.5 million Germans (not counting Jews) were thrown into prisons for opposing the Nazi party and 77,000 executed.  Thats in addition to the 30,000 soldiers that were executed by the Nazis.  

The first people in concentrations camps were trade unionists, communists, and socialists, followed by everyone else that didn't like the Nazis.  You had to play along or suffer the consequences.  The Gestapo was watching to make sure you did while the media brainwashed the people and kids taught in school and the mandatory Hitler Youth to report on their parents for saying anti-Nazi things.  1984 was party based on the very real though police in Germany under the Nazis.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came
&gt;“First they came …” is a famous statement and provocative poem attributed to pastor Martin Niemöller (1892–1984) about the cowardice of German intellectuals following the Nazis' rise to power and the subsequent purging of their chosen targets, group after group. There is some disagreement over the exact wording of the quotation and when it was created; the content of the quotation may have been presented differently by Niemöller on different occasions.[1]

&gt;First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.
Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

&gt;The Thälmann Battalion was a battalion of the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. It was named after the imprisoned German communist leader Ernst Thälmann (born 16 April 1886, executed 18 August 1944) and included approximately 1,500 people, mainly Germans, Austrians, Swiss and Scandinavians. The battalion fought in the defence of Madrid. Amongst the commanders of the battalion were the German writer, historian and World War I officer Ludwig Renn (later Chief of Staff of the XI International Brigade)[1] and Prussian World War I officer Hans Kahle, later promoted to lead the Republican 45th division for a time.[2] The battalion, like the International Brigades in general, also attracted its share of intellectuals, such as the well-known writer Willi Bredel who became its commissar.[1]",0,1402176277,null,0,false,0,ci1pzn4,t3_27j95b,t1_ci1pzn4,t1_ci1ple9,null,1434137930,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt; In health, the key objective of the reforms was to reduce, rapidly and drastically, public expenditure by capping it at 6% of GDP.

The article fails to mention that before that health spending had been rising rapidly at an average rate of 5.7% per year between 2000 and 2009 and then it fell by 11% in both 2010 and 2011.

Whose fault is this Greek peculiarity then:  
""There remain **more physicians per capita in Greece than in any other OECD country.** The number of doctors per capita increased rapidly in Greece up to 2008 and stood at 6.1 physicians per 1000 population in 2010, **nearly twice as much the OECD average of 3.2**. On the other hand, there were only 3.3 nurses per 1000 population in Greece in 2009 (latest year available), a much lower figure than the average of 8.7 in OECD countries. **For many years, there has been evidence of an over-supply of doctors and under-supply of nurses in Greece, resulting in an inefficient allocation of resources.**""

None of which existed in Nazi Germany. I don't believe you understand the depths of which society was controlled and dominated by the Nazi propaganda machine. Every part of normal German life was laced with Nazi ideology. 

The church was suppressed and replaced with a Reich's Church - it didn't take off, but it was significant. The Confessional Church was suppressed. Priests everywhere were thrown into camps on trumped up charged.

Cultural tradition? Glorious Germany was cultural tradition, and outsiders were poisoning this tradition. This is why the rallies were held in Nuremberg; Other than it's geographical convenience, Nuremberg was an old city, reminiscent of German greatness.

Social traditions and organizations that were not in line with the Nazi party's views simply did not exist. 

So, when you're trying to tell me ""I can't believe [you] have overlooked religious and cultural tradition"" etc., you are grossly misinformed. You are dramatically understating the control Hitler and the NSDAP had over German society. This was just civilian society, and that was kicked up many gears when you take into account the Wehrmacht, where as with any military force, you are brainwashed with state ideology.

Provide the evidence. Also, for background, I've been with my current SO for 4 years.

Go out there and actually talk to women. You'll be surprised to learn they're regular human beings.

So completely anecdotal, as I figured. Have you considered that it's your culture, and not women?

&gt; maybe with their moms, and even that work only up until your 12-14 years old.

Just because you don't stand up for yourself with your girlfriend doesn't mean the rest of us are the same. A healthy relationship means both partners listen to and respect each other. Sometimes I'm right and she apologizes after a fight, and sometimes she's right and I apologize after a fight. Sometimes she admits I'm right, sometimes I admit she's right. Is this, like, an alien concept in your culture?

true,Prince_of_Savoy,ASTR,Austria,"Didn't mean to write this much, TLDR: Sadly, yes.

It can get pretty ridiculous. Granted this is a pretty extreme example, but many Germans (and I mean this culturually, so this includes Austrians) do this to some degree.

German Soldiers (even of WWI) aren't honoured nearly as much as the ones of other countries (including Axis ones like Japan), and every second political debate devolves at one into insunuating that the opponent is a Nazi (the worst Insult of them all of course). There's even an expression for this in the german language, ""Ins rechte eck stellen"", literally to put something in the right corner. The lengths some go into for doing this can be hilarious. At that point the discussion is more or less over, because what good is it talking to a Nazi? 

It's kind of sad, but really I think it is almost inevitable in such a Situation. Every School child in Germany and Austria is confronted with this in history class, not just as in learning it from a Textbook, but visiting the actual camps, and seeing the pistures on the walls of People who were killed there. Germany is not the only countries that has committed horrible crimes against humanity (not that I want to in any way minimise these crimes), but it is the only country that really recognised it, admitted ist guilt, and didn't try to minimize it. That's of course going to create some fallout.

When faced with such Horror, there are two instinctive reactions (Kind of like fight or flight): To close you eyes from it, for example saying, yeah it happened, but the Wehrmacht was totally innocent (wich was a popular myth for a long time), or even in the most extreme cases say it didn't happen at all. (Thankfully those are relatively rare) 

The other, is hate. And don't get me wrong, hating Nazis is not a bad thing. But hate is seldom totally rational, and so it can kind of ""Spill over"", even to the point where you hate an entire Nation.

Thankfully, with younger generations coming along, it is getting better. Most young Austrians (not sure about the Germans in Germany itself) at least have won back some sort of patriotism. And even better, it is not a patriotism that goes together with jingoism or hate, as it does in some other countries, but a deep, honest, peaceful sense of pride. All things considered, it still is better then kind of sweeping a genocide under the rug like Turkey for example.

true,wiking85,null,null,"Having lived in Austria for a year it seem Austrian patriotism is more a rejection of Germany; I was literally told that during the 2008 Euro Cup that Germany losing was for Austrians like Austria winning.  
I suppose its kind of like the whole 'Austria was Germany's first victim' concept.  As to Germans I just don't get why its so bad to admit that the German people themselves were occupied by their own government and a minority of assholes that were horrible bigots.  Yes the military behaved badly in war, but as we can see from Vietnam and in other wars the US has been in even innocent non-ideological conscripts can be turned into warcrime committing monsters by the brutality of war and the actions of leaders that make it that much more brutal.  A minority of Germans committed warcrimes and atrocities, including the Holocaust, basically an elite group of monsters, yet all the people, even children were guilty?  

This is just a disgusting concept of collective guilt that turns my stomach, especially given that I understand the history of how the Nazis got to power and violently suppressed all resistance to their rule (they didn't call it the Machtergreifung for nothing, even at the time).  It was well understood at that time that the Nazis were forcing themselves on the nation shamelessly and threatened the people with concentration camp terms if they didn't play along.  

I mean the Saar referendum is a prime example:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saar_status_referendum,_1935
&gt; Due to Hitler's oppression of their German counterparts, Communists and socialists in the Saar supported a continuation of the League of Nations administration and a delay in the plebiscite until after the Nazis were no longer in power in Germany.[3] Meanwhile, Roman Catholics in the Saar were divided in regards to returning to German rule.[3] In order to achieve victory in this referendum, the Nazis resorted to ""a mixture of cajolery and brutal pressure"".[4] In 1933, Sarah Wambaugh, one of the members of the Plebiscite Commission, stated that complaints of a Nazi ""reign of terror"" were made by non-Nazi Saarlanders and by the foreign press.[5] **These complaints included allegations that the Nazis engaged in intimidation, ""espionage, secret denunciations, kidnappings ..., ... interception of letters and telegrams, [and] listening-in to telephone conversations"", among other things.[5]**

They were domestic terrorists.  Blaming the German people for not rising up and stopping them is putting way too much pressure on them to topple a regime that hasn't been expected of anyone since, especially as they didn't really know about the Holocaust, and even then only at best fragments of atrocity stories, until the war was already well on its way and one of total annihilation, so speaking up carried a death sentence:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rose
&gt;The White Rose (German: die Weiße Rose) was a non-violent, intellectual resistance group in Nazi Germany, consisting of students from the University of Munich and their philosophy professor. The group became known for an anonymous leaflet and graffiti campaign, lasting from June 1942 until February 1943, that called for active opposition to dictator Adolf Hitler's regime.
The six most recognized members of the German resistance group were arrested by the Gestapo, tried for treason and beheaded in 1943

I mean why would you stand up in the middle of a world war against a regime that would literally cut your head off and was telling you about things the enemy was going to do to your country if you didn't fight?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgenthau_Plan#Wartime_consequences
&gt;On December 11, OSS operative William Donovan sent Roosevelt a telegraph message from Bern, warning him of the consequences that the knowledge of the Morgenthau plan had had on German resistance; by showing them that the enemy planned the enslavement of Germany it had welded together ordinary Germans and the regime; the Germans continue to fight because they are convinced that defeat will bring nothing but oppression and exploitation.[44]

IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052654/?ref_=nv_sr_1


**""Felidae""** is a German animated movie from 1994, based on a very successful novel. It is a crime story with cats. The cat Francis and his owner move into a new neighbourhood. Francis notices that a lot of cats are being killed and he starts investigating. Great movie, but nothing for kids, because it's rather dark and violent.
IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109791/?ref_=nv_sr_1

**""Momo""** from 1986 is a beautiful fantasy movie (not only) for children, based on a novel by Michael Ende (""The Neverending Story""). Momo is little girl that lives in the ruins of an amphittheatre and befriends the people of a nearby town, because she takes time to really listen to them and to talk to them. - But then one day the ""grey gentlemen"" come into town and tell everybody that they have to ""save time"" by focusing more on themselves and less on each other.

**""After the Truth"" (""Nichts als die Wahrheit"")** A fascinating movie from 1999: Josef Mengele decides to come back to Germany and face trial for his crimes in Auschwitz. He wants to prove to the world that what he did was necessary for medical research and all mankind. - The movie focuses on Mengele and the poor lawyer who has to defend him in court.

In contrast to this is a West that is fixated on personal success and prosperity or, as Putin states, the ""inner self.""

There are some small sections of society which can be quite xenophobic, but that's true anywhere. You wont have difficulty leading an average life so long as you can speak the native language well, and adhere to its customs. 

You *certainly* wont be looked down upon for being an American. People might make a joke about it, but they wont think any less of you for it. There's a lot of people who disagree vehemently with the US government on all lots of different things, but we think it's *the government* and that you personally played no part in it. Even if you really agree with everything the USA does, so long as you are polite about it, nobody will think any less of you. 

Even if racism is a problem, Indians or Indian-Americans are not the people that racism is directed towards. Before I explain this, I'm going to point out that it's only *the most far-right political parties* which actually paint these sorts of pictures. I know you've probably heard stories of UKIP and the Front National getting 25% and 28% of the vote in the most recent elections, but please remember that in the elections that these parties usually do well, have about 30% turnout. They do not have wide support like the headlines will have you believe. But yes, Indians were the example of immigration that was used pre 2000 by the far right, similar but not as bad as how Mexicans are caricatured in the US, in the UK. Now the emphasis is more on Poles and Gypsies, although the Poles I know don't seem to care at all because they, and nobody else I know, associates with such people. 

I think you should give yourself a year or so after university to live and work in Europe and then come back home for some time with the family.

The british royals come from an old tradition of parliamentarism, empire and glory, and have given solace and support to their people in their hour of need. There is an evident emotional and identification between ""Queen and Country"". During WWII, which most of europe (remember, spain was let to rot in its own fascism) remembers this week, the royal family, specially the king was central in mantaining the morale of the population. 

In spain, the bourboun dynasty only established themselves after a terrible, bloody war which ended with the creation of the modern spanish state and the imposition of absolutism; in Catalonia specially, and to this day, people hate the Bourbons, who destroyed their country and abolished their parliament and constitutions (that's why the royal family is usually booed when they interact with the common people in Barcelona, which is not often). 

The bourboun dynasty was expelled not one, not two but three times from spain by different social movements and revolutions, but they always came back to impose absolutism or dictatorship, that's why many people has come to know them as ""the cancer of spain"".


In fact, the last time they had to flee it was because they were literally voted out of office, back in 1931. Republican parties won a supermajority (in a municipal election) after the dictatorship the king had supported ended. 
Then, almost 50 eyars later Franco, the fascist dictator named the grandson of the last king as his successor (this is Juan Carlos I), against the wishes of the king's father, who didn't wanted the monarchy to be appoinited by franco. So Juan Carlos I betrayed his father in order to be appointed king at any cost. 

Not a very clean and transparent history the Bourbon's one. There's like a 1000 more reasons on why the spanish monarchy has nothing to do with the other european royal houses, I just gave you the very basics.

I didn't say otherwise, we just employ different strategies and abide by different rules when we are in a relationship.

&gt;Have you considered that it's your culture, and not women?

of course it's the culture, lesbians are free to abuse one another equally because they are not confined to a specific gender role within the relationship.

&gt; A healthy relationship means both partners listen to and respect each other

Absolutely agree. This does not work however after the honeymoon stage. There rarely are black and white issues in life so right and wrong are more complex answers, I'm right, she escalates, calls me inconsiderate, too logical or even conservative (basically deflecting to personal attacks), I see the patern until I drop it or give her the win. 

from her point of view, my option comes with a hit to her ego therefor it's bad

from my point of view, my option comes with a pointless fight and more tension between us, therefor it's not really worth it.

&gt;What if I told you men also pick? Just as much as women, even!

Men pick whom to approach and who to stay with after the ""honymoon"", besides that, dating is just a peacock dance to impress women, you do not pick anything you are just allowed to make decisions and are judged accordingly.

Now about backing things up, my thoughts come from my experiences, I don't give a fuck they don't conform to your idealised political correct world view. Actually from where I'm standing the uniformity of genders(not equality) feminist preach (whith studies) is bullshit in the real world. Women don't act like regular ""people"" in relationships, men can't behave like a average gender neutral person in a relationship. 

Now when I won't be labeled a misogynist just for noticing this, maybe some studies about how men are not the same as women will be published without ruining the career of the researcher that undertakes such a counter cultural pursuit.",0,1402205441,null,0,false,0,ci203ef,t3_27e0dg,t1_ci203ef,t1_ci1qxnx,null,1434142828,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

And even this way in late 80's there were significant parts of population who didn't support seceding from Russia - mostly clever people who understood that in independence there was no bright future because of economic and political reasons. 

So there was two options:

1) Trying to secede in historical Chechen lands which are less that 50% of current Chechen Republic. Those lands are mostly [southern of Grozny](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/thumb/c/c2/Чечня.png/800px-Чечня.png) and have no industry, resources and even are difficult for agriculture.

2) Segregate from pro-Russian Ingushetia and cleanse all Chechen pro-Russians and ethnic Russian, Georgian, Ossetian, Jew and other non-Chechen population.  

Pro-independence groups opted for the second scenario and started what is known as genocide of Russian population in Chechnya in 1990-1994 which resulted in more than 100 000 Russians dead or missing and other 200 000 displaced. 

In 1994 Civil War in Chehnya begun with two main factions of Chechens fighting each other -  Russian government intervened in 1994 for a set of reasons: from protection of civilians to aid to anti-Dudaev coalition.

In mid 1996 Dudaev was killed - there was no reason for anti-Dudaev coalition no more. Both sides broke into many factions based on clan principle. Russian forces held important loses in that unpopular war - which led to  a treaty of Russian troops retreating from Chechnya and an agreement of referendum in 2001 about official status of the region.

In 1999 Chechen leaders invaded Russian region of Dagestan which started the Second Chechen War and another Civil War inside Chechnya.

www.duolingo.com and www.memrise.com are good for getting started. I haven't used memrise as much as duolingo, though, so I can't guarantee the outcome. Also, duolingo usually doesn't tell you exactly how to use the words, and instead you have to learn from trial and error. If you don't understand how to use the words correctly and keep getting the questions wrong, go to German is easy (the first link) and hope that there's something about it there. Other than that, google is your best friend.  
  
If you can spring for it, Rosetta Stone has a good reputation. I've never used it, though.  
    
Also, if it's available to you, you should look into taking a legit class on it.  
  
After you get decent at the basics, you can try reading some books or watching some shows in German if you want to get a better understanding and vocabulary.

If you're looking for an awesome burger with a french twist go to [Big Fernand](http://www.bigfernand.com/fr/browse/addresses/addresses.php). Best burger joint i've tried so far.

I definitely recommend [le musée du fumeur](http://www.museedufumeur.net/accueil/mdfEN.html). Not very well known by tourists and the museum itself is **tiny**. seriously, you'll be done in 30 minutes if you pay attention to all the exhibits. What's nice is they have a lounge in the back where you can buy a nice hot beverage, relax and smoke their shisha all at a very reasonable price. They also have a head shop with everything you'd expect if you're into that sort of thing.

Not very far away from le musée du fumeur you can visit [Victor Hugo's house](http://maisonsvictorhugo.paris.fr/en). not for everyone but i really enjoyed it, interesting slice of life, very well preserved and extremely beautiful. If you're like me and looking at relics belonging to a legend of literature brings you into a state of awe, then this is the place for you.

I don't have any experience with hostels anywhere but you can probably find a dorm for about 30 euros a night. A private bedroom will cost you a lot more.

One more thing: VISIT TOULOUSE! that's where i'm from. great people, great weather, great nightlife and the city just feels homey. A feat for a city with well over 400 000 people.

Hope this helps!

instead of just hiring employees from the very close Manitoba town, the resort decided to bypass the legal circus and hire American workers instead (who had to commute huge distances and who therefore has to be paid more to reimburse for gas.)

long story short: a small / medium sized business had to endure unnecessary bureaucratic ""blahblahblah"" which most certainly lowered its efficiency and growth.

true,metroxed,EUSK,Basque Country,"Actually, yes. Apart from Durango in Mexico there are also cities named the same in Colorado, Iowa and Texas, although they're named after the Mexican city (but the origin is the same). 

There's also a city named Balmaceda in Chile (named after the Basque town of Balmaseda), a town in Minnesota named Biscay (English for Bizkaia) and another one called Biscay Bay (after the actual Biscay Bay in the Basque Country) in Canada. The French territory of Saint-Pierre et Miquelon (near Canada) as well, *Miquelon* is an ancient Basque version of the name Mike. They even have the Basque flag in their coat of arms.

The country Bolivia, in South America, was named after Simón Bolívar, a Venezuelan of Basque descent. His name, Bolívar, is a Hispanicized version of Bolibar which literally means ""valley with mills"". His family came from a small village called Ziortza, which today is named Ziortza-Bolibar in his honour. There's also a Bolívar region in Colombia and a state named Anzoátegui (Spanish version of Anzoategi), also Basque. There might be more I don't know of.

About Basque heritage and descendants... that's tricky. Many people from Latin America have Basque surnames, but that doesn't really mean Basque heritage. During the Spanish Empire, natives were converted to Christianism and baptised, and thus given ""normal"" surnames, these could be of Castilian origin or Catalan or Basque. So most people with Basque surnames in Latin American aren't really of Basque origin. 

Argentina is the country with most actual Basque heritage, at least 10% of the population is of Basque descent according to Wikipedia, followed by Uruguay and Chile. Also important known ones in Venezuela, Cuba, the United States and Canada. In the US the biggest populations are in Boise, Idaho and Reno, Nevada. There's actually a quite big North American Basque Organization based there and the University of Reno has a Center for Basque studies.

I've been learning Italian in Italy (mostly by osmosis) for two years. 

At first, me practising Italian in shops and so on was completely useless. I'd ask how much something was, and would receive a barrage of incomprehensible chat in response. Part of this is normal for any language learner, where any departure from the learned 'script' throws you, but I think part of it is because Italian is a language with very few foreign learners. Because English is the *lingua franca* of the world, if an obvious foreigner asks a question in broken English, most (though by no means all) English speakers know to answer in short sentences of simple words, but in Italy quite a few people don't seem to realise they need to compromise on slang, speed, and colloquial grammar. I'm looking at you, mother-in-law.

Secondly, given the evidence of my life in English, I'm pretty sure I'm socially able and quite interesting. But put me in a social Italian context and I'm basically an overenthusiastic 6-year-old with learning difficulties. However polite someone is, more than five minutes of ""il tempo fa bene"" and ""non so come si dice"" gets boring fast. If an Italian-speaker already speaks a bit of English and wants to interact socially they are naturally going to want to *communicate* with the other person, regardless of the means of communication.

* This historical event has been organized by **Gure esku dago** (*It's in our hands*), and had as its main objective to connect the 125 km between the cities of Durango (Biscay) and Pamplona/Iruñea (Navarre) with people holding hands all the way.
* The answer has been overwhelming. At about 12:00 local time the objective was reached and the two cities connected for about 45 minutes. More than 100.000 persons took part and more than 900 buses were needed. There were so many people that in some parts the line ran double.
* The goal of the human chain was to demand the right of self-determination for the Basque Country; the right to decide our own future.
* The event had the support of the main Basque political parties: Basque Nationalist Party, Euskal Herria Bildu (the two main forces of the region), Ezker Batua and the ""revelation"" of the last European elections in Spain, Podemos party. There was also a representative of the Spanish Workers' Socialist Party (PSOE). 
* It also had the support of the main workers' unions of both countries

Similarly, trying to meet dissidents and ending up meeting secret service agents could happen and has happened in our Western representative democracies. Disgusting as it is, it's not a sign of imminent collapse.

You are knee deep in the propaganda. Stalin is nowhere close to #2, he probably doesn't crack top 20. Americans and Western liberal academics have just been pumping and inflating numbers for decades, making it up to eleventy kajillion dead under Stalin. The best estimates put the toll around 3.5 million- mass murder, yes, but comparable to lots of shit that went on under colonial Western powers well into the 20th century. Check out the [Bengal Famine of 1943](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943) under Churchill for instance.

&gt; You do not sweep atrocities under the rug? I don't see you mentioning

I'm going to stop you right there. No one has defended Stalin. You have defended Columbus, Washington, all the American slave holders and genocidaires of Native Americans, mitigating their actions while not naming or taking accountability for anything.

Historical reasons. GDers are the ideological and sometimes biological grandchildren of fascists that loved Hitler in the 30s and 40s. Greece used to have a dictator until it was invaded by the Axis and even though Greece was in the British sphere of influence the establishment was also pro-nazi. That regime had supporters and those supporters believed they were correct in their thinking, so a thread of pro-nazi ideals was inserted into Greek society

Later on, during the occupation, there were people that helped the occupying forces administer the country. Well, guess what, those people believed themselves to be correct in what they were doing too, so another thread of pro-nazi ideals was inserted into Greek society.

Look, with 6% of GDP to public health care it's perfectly possible to have a decent health care system. What that needs is decisions by Greek government, it's their responsibility to plan and provide a better and more efficient system. 

You simply cannot blame everything on austerity. Yes, the Greek health care has less funding now than it did in 2009. But then again at that time the spending was huge as it had been rapidly rising through the 2000s. 

Now it has been cut back and after the cuts the health care spending per capita is about the same as it was in 2003-4. It is still decent amount of funding, and it is perfectly possible to have a decent health care system with it. But that is up to Greeks themselves. 

Instead of loudly externalising the responsibility and hating people in the process it would make more sense to be asking questions such as:  
Do you want to spend that funding to keep on fostering the inefficiencies of the Greek health care system?

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; Are you seriously claiming that the inefficiencies of Greek health care system had nothing to do with it? And it's all austerity's fault?

No. 

&gt; Look, with 6% of GDP to public health care it's perfectly possible to have a decent health care system. What that needs is decisions by Greek government, it's their responsibility to plan and provide a better and more efficient system. 

Depends on the GDP now, does it not?

&gt; You simply cannot blame everything on austerity. 

I'm not blaming *everything* on austerity. 

&gt; Now it has been cut back and after the cuts the health care spending per capita is about the same as it was in 2003-4

That's probably not true, either in nominal or real terms. 

&gt; Instead of loudly externalising the responsibility and hating people in the process it would make more sense to be asking questions such as:

Wait, so the imposed programme of cuts on healthcare is in my imagination and everything can be resolved locally? How does that work? How about you apply this argument to your own thinking: Instead of loudly externalising the responsibility of your governments for imposing these cuts and saying ""oh, it's all their own fault"", how about you accept part of the responsibility too? It's all talk about ""their own responsibility"" when it comes to the suffering of the Greek people but I don't see you guys saying the same things about your societies. When it comes to your societies, it's always somebody else's fault: the immigrants, the gypsies, the eurocrats, the Greeks, the Americans etc. Why are people like you, with the talk about accepting responsibility always present when some catastrophe befalls the Greek people, but you are nowhere to be seen in all these other cases of people externalising responsibility? The hypocrisy is insufferable. 

&gt; Do you want to spend that funding to keep on fostering the inefficiencies of the Greek health care system? Do you want a better and more efficient health care system? Whose responsibility that would be?

Wanting these things and recognising that they are primarily the responsibility of the Greek political class and citizenry in no way refutes my argument that the imposed austerity measures had a visible and direct effect on the healthcare of the Greek people. 

You pretend that the money is more than enough to have decent healthcare (it's not) and you pretend that all the inefficiencies can somehow disappear overnight (they can't). ",0,1402229181,null,0,false,0,ci24c9h,t3_27jaap,t1_ci24c9h,t1_ci24831,null,1434144827,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Storicamente, per evitare che un qualsiasi cazzone arrivasse con la pozione magica e la propinasse come cura, in Italia abbiamo stabilito alcune regole: tutti i farmaci devono passare attraverso delle fasi di verifica (prima su cellule, poi su animali, poi su umani), ognuna necessaria per accedere alla successiva.

Sappiamo che questo può voler dire perdere tempo, ma è un prezzo accettabile, al confronto di quello che avremmo accettando qualsiasi proposta come terapia efficace.

E per questo quando uno scopre una soluzione ad un problema inizia la lunga trafila che la porta a diventare efficace. E molto spesso (il 99.9999% delle volte) scopre durante il processo che non era come pensava. Tuttavia, una volta su un milione, scopre davvero una cura o un farmaco efficaci, e salva innumerevoli vite.

Adesso è successo che dei giudici si sono arrogati un potere che non gli dovrebbe essere dato: quello di evitare le regole, invece di quello di farle applicare, e questo è molto molto pericoloso.

Se questa faccenda creerà un precedente, chiunque asserirà che il suo prodotto (su cui non è fatto alcun controllo) cura la malattia terminale X, e smuoverà abbastanza genitori disperati da commuovere un giudice, potrà disporre di milioni di fondi pubblici, altrimenti destinati alle cure vere.

Quello che si sente solitamente dire è ""eh, ma tanto sarebbero morti comunque, tanto vale sperimentare"" è profondamente grave, a livello etico. Innanzitutto si creano dei conflitti di interessi: se un medico antepone la ricerca di fama e gloria al proprio lavoro sarà portato a spingere fino al livello terminale un malato, per poi farne la sua cavia, senza che lo Stato lo possa proteggere. Se gli va bene, diventa un mito. Se gli va male, crepa il paziente e lui è intoccabile.

Ho conosciuto diverse persone che si rifiutano di parlare una lingua, a meno che non la parlino al 100%.

Uno dei motivi per cui la gente preferisce parlarti in inglese *potrebbe* essere che si sente un po' in imbarazzo per te e non vuole farti fare brutta figura.

Poi in un altro commento hai fornito un po' più di contesto: di solito cerchi di parlare nei bar, quando sei mezzo ubriaco, cioè in un posto in cui la gente cerca di rilassarsi e magari non ha voglia di sforzarsi troppo a cercare di capire ciò che stai dicendo.

Quindi, a parte che puoi aver incontrato qualche persona poco gentile, però magari hai trovato gente poco tollerante con gli errori e che preferiscono parlarti in inglese piuttosto che ri-tradurre mentalmente alcune tue frasi in inglese in modo da cavarne un senso.

Die Mehrheit der zu ernährenden Menschen wohnt eben nicht in Ländern, in denen sie nach belieben zwischen Ackerbau und Viehzucht entscheiden können.

Ich wiederhole es auch gerne noch mal: Wie sich der reichtumsverwöhnte Mitteleuropäer oder Amerikaner ernährt ist eine Frage. Ob nun Vegetarismus ein ethisch/moralisch überlegendes Model darstellt eine andere. Ich verstehe jeden, der aus welchen Gründen auch immer auf Fleisch verzichten möchte.

In actual 'representing' their value lies in being ambassadors. They speak multiple languages, are very well-spoken and educated, and have etiquette pouring out of their back ends.

If we just look at the cost of the royal family, we can see that an election would cost 2 years of royal upkeep.

We'd have to add to that running costs, which, looking at the French president, come to £73M per year, even if you halve that number since a UK president wouldn't have any real power, you're still out 80 + 36*4= £224M vs £168M for the Royals of the same 4 years.

No they would not. Why do people keep repeating this lie? They own the crown estate in the same way they technically own the entire nation.

The only legal mechanism the monarch has to transfer the crown estate into their personal ownership is an incoming monarch can refuse to sign the bill that recognises them as monarch and renews the corporation sole of the crown estate. Then there'd be some legal wrangling which would probably end with parliament giving the crown to somebody else. Given that there would be no incoming monarch there is no opportunity to do this in any case.

Regardless there is no world in which the monarchy automatically gets the estate if they were removed. It would take a specific act of parliament to transfer the estate to them.

You are exagerating.

There are no sanctions against Russia. Only sanctions against [oligarchs and state officials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_individuals_sanctioned_during_the_2014_pro-Russian_conflict_in_Ukraine). The trade between EU and Russia is not sanctioned, afaik. The French are about to sell two warships to a country that just invaded and annexed part of another sovereign country. I think that is quite telling about how is EU serious about sanctions against Russia.

There are currently three (maybe more?) Russia friendly governments in the EU - Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria - and none of us are being sanctioned by Merkel or anyone else. Major western oil/gas companies Exxon, BP, Statoil, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell have [signed deals with Russia](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/18/us-shell-russia-idUSBREA3H0BU20140418), some of them right during the Crimea annexation crisis.

Yes! For Scotland to have an equal voice to England would be completely undemocratic because it would mean a population of 5 million would have a voice equal to that of a population of 50 million. Each person in the United Kingdom gets a voice with one vote, because it is the people who make up the Union, not just the countries. It would similarly be undemocratic for all countries to have an equal number of seats in the European Parliament (regardless of population size).


And this is *completely* democratic as long as the majority of Scottish people want to remain part of the Union.

But you know, none of that is a problem. You can have coal, gas, nuclear or renewable energy as the source, with enough R&amp;D you turn every one of those technologies safe, reliable, and carbon neutral.

We need to stop bickering and decide.

We need to decide if we want a centralized or decentralized grid pointing out the benefits and drawbacks of both. 

The main points being that a centralized grid is what we have now and we would focus on carbon capture technology and nuclear technology with supplemental renewable energy sources (we could have carbon neutral power supply within adecade). A decentralized grid requires the reworking of our current infrastructure and the invention of universal energy storage technology (this would take some time to develop). Renewable energy would be our main source of power with nuclear/coal energy serving as supplement.

Obviously there are other aspects to consider, but there really is no middle ground if we want to tackle climate change seriously.

*In late July, the Riksbank of Sweden created a minor sensation among central bank watchers when it lowered the interest rate on its one-week deposit facility to -0.25 percent at the same time it squeezed its benchmark lending rate down to 0.25 percent.*

*...*

*In fact, the Riksbank has a separate, much larger overnight deposit facility on which it pays a 0.15 percent interest rate.*

So a bank choosing to store funds for a week at the Riksbank would pay 0.25%, to store overnight though and they'd *get* 0.15%. A bank can naturally just choose to use overnights then rather than weeklys, meaning that:

*On Sept. 23, the last day for which data is available, banks had put exactly 12 million Swedish kronor ($1.8 million) into the (one-week) deposit facility with a negative rate, a rounding error to the 90 billion that they left in the (overnight) account with a positive rate.*

&gt;__German declension__ is the paradigm that [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language) uses to define all the ways nouns can change their form to reflect their role in the sentence: subject, object, etc. [Declension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declension) allows speakers to mark a difference between subjects, direct objects, indirect objects and possessives by changing the form of the word—and/or its associated article—instead of indicating this meaning through word order or prepositions (e.g. [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language), [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language), [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language)). As a result, German can take a much more fluid approach to word order without the meaning being obscured. In English, a simple sentence must be written in strict word order (ex. John sees Mary). This sentence cannot be expressed in any other word order than how it is written here without substituting one word with a synonym. A transliteration of the same sentence from German to English would appear rather different (ex. John-subject sees Mary-directobject) and can be expressed with a variety of word order (ex. Mary-subject is seen by John-directobject) with little or no change in meaning.

In such a circumstance it makes no difference whether that area is a country, a federated state, or a geographic area, because democracy is a thing of the *people*.

The Union works for as long as the majority of the Scottish people accept that their power within the UK is relative to their size (the same as any geographic area). The Union works for as long as the majority of the Scottish people vote to remain in the Union.

This point holds in relation to the relationship of Scotland with the rest of the UK. It holds in relation to the relationship of the UK (or the Netherlands, France, Malta etc) to the EU. If you believe the interests of Scotland are best served apart from the UK, that is a perfectly valid position, but being a minority in a democracy does not automatically mean you are oppressed (as long as the majority of that minority are happy with the *democratic* status quo.


So I haven't proven any point at all. 

Again, I have no problem with pro-independence. It's just really fucking insulting to frame Scotland as a colony just because you personally believe the interests of Scotland would best be served as an independent country.

true,SouthPads,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;Scotland being able to vote on English matters is just as bad as everything else I'm saying. Why should we have a say down there when you don't have a say up here.

I agree it is stupid. But it demonstrates that England does not completely rule the UK.

&gt;The same goes for why should Scotland disagree with the bedroom tax but be given it anyway because our politicians are outnumbered?

The bedroom tax is actually due to be scrapped in Scotland for exactly this reason.

However, Scotland does have a history of drawing many millions of pounds in investment from the UK, and returning very little of it. Glasgow in particular is a tax ""Black Hole"" on similar to England's Bradford. For this reason cries of ""unfair"" however justified, are not listened to as often as they might be. Because Scotland consistently complains whenever the UK tries to levy any kind of tax from scotland.",0,1402236578,null,0,false,0,ci25xyr,t3_27lcjx,t1_ci25xyr,t1_ci25ue0,null,1434145579,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

* This historical event has been organized by **Gure esku dago** (*It's in our hands*), and had as its main objective to connect the 125 km between the cities of Durango (Biscay) and Pamplona/Iruñea (Navarre) with people holding hands all the way.
* The answer has been overwhelming. At about 12:00 local time the objective was reached and the two cities connected for about 45 minutes. Around 150.000 people took part and more than 900 buses were needed. There were so many people that in some parts the line ran double.
* The goal of the human chain was to demand the right of self-determination for the Basque Country; the right to decide our own future.
* The event had the support of the main Basque political parties: Basque Nationalist Party, Euskal Herria Bildu (the two main forces of the region), Ezker Batua and the ""revelation"" of the last European elections in Spain, Podemos party. There was also a representative of the Spanish Workers' Socialist Party (PSOE). 
* It also had the support of the main workers' unions of both countries

&gt; His comments come after reports of a mass grave of infants and children found in the grounds of a convent run by the Bon Secours order of nuns in Tuam, Co Galway.

&gt; The home operated from the 1920s to the 1960s.

&gt;Nominations for the positions of Labour Party leader and deputy leader closed at midday.

&gt;Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton and Minister of State at the Department of Health Alex White are the only candidates for the leadership.

&gt;The contest for the deputy leader position is a four-way race.

&gt;Tánaiste Eamon Gilmore announced last week that he was standing down as leader in the wake of big losses for the party in the European and Local Elections.

Agency cites strong performance of exports and sustained recovery of domestic economy

&gt;Standard &amp; Poor’s has become first major rating agency to restore an A rating to Irish sovereign debt since the country’s return to the international bond markets.
In a significant boost to the Government, the agency raised Ireland’s credit rating by one notch to A- from BBB+, with a positive outlook.
It cited an improved outlook for growth and more signs of recovery in the domestic economy as the rationale for its upgrade.

To add to that: There are very few truly national papers in Germany, and every region has its own paper that carries international, national and local news.

My local paper is a good example of this. As well as the usual sections like sport and culture, it has a national/international section, and a local section. But the local area is itself divided into smaller areas, and each little area gets its own version of the local section. So we get news about every little club's annual general meeting and then a round-up of the most important stories from the rest of the region, as well as national and international news, all in one paper.

Having collected further information from the rest of your comments, I think I can give a reply that's very close to a full explanation:

- You've met them in a foreign country, where there's no expectation that they should speak Italian or that others would want to.

- You've met them in bars, where they might be interested in conversation more than in helping you with language practice.

- You speak Italian at a reasonable level of grammatical and syntactic correctness but with a heavy Southern accent, which probably makes it a lot harder to understand.

Basically, what you are describing is Italians in some bar abroad getting approached by a guy who, upon discovering that they are Italian, wants to exclusively speak the language even though it's very hard to hold a meaningful conversation this way.

I'd find it only natural that they'd want to switch to something that provides less of a language barrier.

Nope, going with the same sanctions EU does would probably make Russia take our free-trade benefit. 

&gt;That will be a problem if you ever decide to join the EU.

We know that and I think that it's still early for us to let that benefit go.

&gt;Kinda. Still I am going to assume you will have a referendum before joining - an opportunity to refuse membership in the EU.

You are right here but let's still define something, while our whole (100% of) parliament is EU, our greatest party still won with EU and Russia in their program (their program was to collaborate with Russia up until we are on the entrance of the EU which is also true for the SPS our second biggest party) so if it came to choosing one side or the other it should be better like in normal democracy to give referendum about big questions like  going to EU or not going to EU or maybe even to EAU because the politics of the Vucic's SNS became non-valid.

In practical terms that means a reduction in regulation, taxation, corruption and tax evasion, to begin with.   It also means enhancing the ability to enforce a contract, which means a reform to commercial law.

If I just take one example in this post: corruption.

The only EU countries that are less corrupt than the most corrupt Anglo-Saxon country, the US are, 

Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany and Belgium (and I doubt that one).

All the rest of them, all twenty or whatever are more corrupt according to this,

The EU itself is probably more corrupt than Uncle Sam.

So that's what needs to be done.

But I don't think it will be done - of course.

Anyhow the song itself isn't an SS song it's an SA song. 

Short history for those interested: SA (Sturmabteilung) also called the ""brown shirts"" was the para military organisation of the Nazi party and an important factor in getting Hitler into power. SA became very dominant as a military force after Hitler took control of the state. The leader of SA Ernst Röhm became more and more obsessed with becoming the new German Army. Opposition from the Reichswehr (Original army), later to be renamed Wehrmacht, grew and Hitler needed their support. So not long after Hitler seised power he invited all the leaders of the SA to meet at a remote location where he had them all killed. This night is known as the Night of the Long Knives.

From there on the SS (Schutzstaffel), which had been a sort of a ""side kick"" to the SA, grew into prominence and placed under the control of Heinrich Himmler.

Find me one country that has the law that the main party needs to form the coalition with the minority one and that the county which has that law doesn't have minorities defined as constitutional people.

I knew that the Albanians had the constitutional right in the Macedonia but after the fall of Yugoslavia the international community decided that there are no constitutional people in the Ex-Yu countries. If they accepted Albanians as that then it would mean that the Croatia and Bosnia would need to pay the war reparations to Serbia and reform their law, maybe also their independence would go into consideration.

&gt;Look at the the National budget and its grant disbursement in every municipality, you'll see what I mean. Furthermore map the locations of all capital expenditures the Macedonian government makes. Add to that the fact that the Albanian diaspora is pumping a disproportionate amount of money into land and real estate, that's where the disproportionate taxation happens.

There are ways like local courts or even international courts if you think that their government are being assholes, no need for violent revolutions.

Inoltre il momento in cui scopri che la vita o la salute di un figlio sono in forse non è un buon momento per riempire vuoti culturali. 

Che invece ci siano predatori che sfruttano la fragilità altrui, a costo di amplificare i danni, per fare soldi facili, questo merita pronta denuncia dei media e tutto il rigore di cui la legge è capace. 

Ma siccome l'Italia è il Paese che è, l'intervento è lento e goffo, e nel frattempo capita che pezzi del sistema dei mezzi d'informazione dicano alle persone le sciocchezze che le persone vogliono sentire, per vendere più pubblico agli inserzionisti. 

In tutto questo, mi pare che le responsabilità di chi è fragile o culturalmente poco difeso siano marginali. 

A questa riflessione aggiungerei una considerazione personale:

true,metroxed,EUSK,Basque Country,"The province of Alava (Araba in Basque), in its integrity, **is** considered part of the Basque Country, both current and historical. It is one of the seven historical territories. The thing is, historically, Araba has always been a border region between the Castilian lands and the Basque regions, and has been under Castilian influence for much more time than Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa; it is also isolated from them, as the Basque Mountains lay between the latter two and Araba. The Biscayan or Western dialect of the Basque language was spoken in Araba, but it was lost on the 16th, 17th centuries, although it still survives in the northernmost regions of the province. The Basque language is currently undergoing a slow, but so far successful, process of recovery in this territory.

Navarre (Nafarroa in Basque) is far more complicated. The current boundaries of the Higher Navarre (ie, the Navarre that is in Spain, opposed to the Lower Navarre in France) are based on the core territory of the Kingdom of Navarre. Basque is today spoken in the northern half (commonly known as ""Basque Navarre"") and in Lower Navarre. There, they feel Basque, vote to pro-Basque parties and are native Basque speakers. The middlelands, around Pamplona, are something close to 50/50. Southern Navarre was heavily Romanized, and Basque was lost before the 9th century. It was replaced by a Romance language, the Navarro-Aragonese (heavily influenced by Basque), that eventually was replaced as well by Castilian/Spanish. The Basque language was long lost there and is, in my opinion, irrecoverable.

3 . Le FN veut en effet abroger la loi Gayssot tout comme un grande partie de la classe politique, non pas pour autoriser ""la propagande antisémite"" mais parce que c'est une loi mémorielle. De plus la loi Gayssot n'a pas été soumise au conseil constitutionnel et la plupart des juristes sont d'accord pour dire qu'elle y serait censurée.

&gt;En France, avec un temps de retard, les élites de gauche et de droite réunies ont importé ce modèle sous le nom de « diversité », nouveau nom de la « préférence immigrée » mise en oeuvre depuis plus de trente ans. Elles n’hésitent pas à bafouer le principe de neutralité de l’action publique et par là celui de la laïcité par divers subterfuges. Un peu partout, se sont mises en place des politiques comme la parité, ou des structures pour imposer, dans les faits, cette idéologie différentialiste et multiculturelle, qui n’est qu’une forme de racisme inversé. Les premières victimes en sont les ""hommes blancs hétérosexuels"", fustigés en son temps par Anne Lauvergeon, alors présidente d’Areva. Mais ceux qui sont censés en bénéficier se trouvent aussi lésés, car ils sont toujours soupçonnés d’être là où ils sont par la grâce d’une discrimination.

Surely has to be a referendum to support it, and to change the constitution, a proposition has to be put forth in one parliament (during its four-year period), and be voted through by a 2/3 majority in the next parliament (after an election).

I'm sure, if a referendum says yes to abolish the monarchy, it will happen. And I think a referendum is the only way to abolish it; no politician would touch the royal family unless the public wants it. They're very popular, and a clear majority want to keep the monarchy as this point.

A monarchy debate never catches on, and is usually just among (individual) politicians, commentators, etc.

I hope a referendum, or better, an abolishment of the Spanish monarchy, will spark a debate here. I'm all for the Republic of Norway. We should have had a debate about it in this 200 year anniversary for our constitution.

No. I mean how can one make the Danish People's Party, UKIP, Swedish Democrats, True Finns fascist? Sure FN if you stretch it but non of them are fascist. Not even close.

&gt;Most of the fascist leaders and parties in the past didn't come out in the beginning and say we need to get rid of Jews and immigrants and militarize our society.
 
Mussolini wasn't an anti-semite as Hitler was as an example so that doesn't really work as characterising fascism either. Fascism and national socialism are quite different yet similar. But even so nothing with any of the parties are fascist. Golden Dawn I could agree calling national socialists.

The word fascist has become as diluted as racist. It doesn't bare any meaning anymore, everything is called fascist or racist. But most people aren't even equipped with the basic understanding on what it is.

Just the economic principles of fascism go against all of these parties lines, not to forget that non of them see the state as the main factor that unifies the nation towards a common cause. Their willingness to trade and cooperate with other nations goes against this theory. Look at UKIP who's said that it would like to trade more with commonwealth nations. It would go any form of logic if they viewed race as the common denominator and the centre for their ideology so their not national socialists either.

true,jeanralph,ZBSVUE,U-E,"Autant j'apprécie la volonté d'expliquer plutôt que celle de condamner et autant je suis d'accord que le FN est actuellement le parti le plus à même d'attirer des profils pro-pétainistes, autant je ne pense pas que l'article démontre quoique ce soit sur la nature pétainiste du FN.

Il ne suffit pas d'être anti IVG ou pour l'abrogation des lois anti publications anti sémites pour être pétainiste.

Si on regarde les caractéristiques principales de ce qui définit Vichy et sa ""Révolution Nationale"" (le pétainisme), on voit :

- un contexte historique littéralement unique, indissociable du constat  de l'échec militaire de 1940 lui-même indissociable de la perception de certains comme quoi c'est la société qui a échoué par faiblesse (ce qui implique de la ""régénérer"" grâce à la fameuse ""Révolution Nationale""). Pétain lui-même était un républicain convaincu jusqu'à très tard dans sa vie et Laval également, donc pas de contexte historique unique avec défaite cuisante en 40 : pas de pétainisme.

- sa composition plurielle et la difficile cohabitation entre traditionalistes, (ex)républicains et radicaux pro-nazis. Le régime de Vichy post-retour de Laval après 42 n'a pas forcément la même inclinaison idéologique que celui de Pétain en 1940. Le FN dans sa composition actuelle fait clairement la part belle à un républicanisme qu'aurait renié Pétain;

- économiquement Vichy était corporatiste avec une préférence claire pour les professions réglementées et l'économie planifiée dans une démarche de ""moralisation du capitalisme"". Le FN n'a pas le monopole sur cette position et je pense que d'autres partis s'en rapprochent davantage encore;

- une politique d'aménagement du territoire faisant la part belle aux régions vues comme un levier de pouvoir par l'Etat centralisé (euhm pour les régions d'ailleurs on en parle en ce moment...) et aux technocrates. Cette politique a gardé la même cohérence dans les régimes qui ont suivi. Seule la volonté de ""retour à la terre"" qui a d'ailleurs rapidement été mise au placard est un aspect propre à Vichy, mais je ne pense pas que ça fasse partie du programme du FN;

- Vichy a tout simplement posé les bases de la sécurité sociale et de la retraite par répartition en France. Idem pour un premier embryon de salaire minimum, en matière d'allocations familiales et tout un tas d'autres mesures sociales;

- une idéologie officielle orientée vers la défense d'un ordre moral, hygiéniste (morale + santé publique, ça me rappelle certains partis au pouvoir plus que le Front) la défense de la ruralité et des corps intermédiaires, la primauté de l'Etat dans l'économie, l'importance du patriotisme, du respect de la hiérarchie de la famille du sport et du dynamisme de la jeunesse (encore une fois, la volonté de ""revitalisation"" du pays). Là c'est compliqué, le FN d'aujourd'hui respecte certains critères mais je ne pense pas que la volonté révolutionnaire de régénération soit la même, actuellement le climat au FN me paraît plutôt réactionnaire;

- une politique d'exclusion de certaines catégories de la population avec des lois racistes, antisémites + l'interdiction de la Franc-maçonnerie et des syndicats + limitation des naturalisations. Là aussi il faut trier le grain de l'ivraie. Non car il y'a une porosité entre syndicats et FN, non le FN ne supprimerait pas la Franc-maçonnerie ni ne mettrait en place des lois d'exclusion (oui certains au FN ne seraient pas contre). Par contre oui le FN chercherait à limiter les flux migratoires voire revenir en arrière sur certaines naturalisations, reste à voir si c'est LA caractéristique essentielle du pétainisme.

tl;dr : oui en cherchant on peut trouver des caractéristiques communes entre pétainisme et FN, mais on peut aussi en trouver facilement entre pétainisme et acquis sociaux/Etat providence/technocratie/sociale-démocratie des 4 et 5ème Républiques.

You can't tell me what to do.

Plus sérieusement je ne pense pas que le système actuel soit sain, et je pense qu'on en est arrivé à ce système car c'était le plus simple à mettre en place. Je ne pense pas qu'on devrait le maintenir. Le bitcoin et l'école autrichienne sont une belle alternative à mes yeux.

&gt; De la même manière, évite de trop te faire influencer par les keynésiens (qui ont tendance à voir l'inflation comme un moindre mal).

Je comprend qu'aucune idée ne soit parfaite, mais faut bien se décider sur ce vers quoi on tend non?

Sans oublier que si je discute actuellemetn avec toi, c'est justement parce que je ne me laisse complètement influencé par aucun des 2 groupes et que je cherche des avis ailleurs :)

&gt; En gros, les prix n'arrêtent pas de baisser, donc les gens remettent à plus tard leur consommation ce qui implique une baisse de l'activité économique et donc un cercle vicieux très mauvais pour l'économie.

Je sais pas trop pour cet argument, après tout c'est déjà le cas sur l'informatique. J'ai repoussé le plus possible l'achat de mon dernier telephone par exemple. Je trouvais que mon ancien marchait très bien. Et le temps que je garde celui-là les prix auront baissés. Quand il s'est pété (ahh soirée médecine), j'en ai acheté un autre parce que j'en avais besoin. J'ai pas attendu 2 ans que ce soit moins cher. Au final ça incite à ne pas trop acheter des choses dont ont a pas besoin et à ne pas investir dans n'importe quoi. Ca m'a l'air plus sain.

Ce que je me demande c'est est-ce que la déflation n'est pas juste mauvaise pour notre système actuelle (banque centrale etc) mais est-ce que ça ne serait pas un meilleur système pour un monde un peu moins porter sur la consommation à tout prix? Et notamment dans un monde où l'écologie demande une diminution de notre mode de comsomation acutelle.

Il faut continuer à investir, mais investir plus intelligemment. C'est le meilleur moyen de maintenir une éconmie saine. Investir le plus possible dans n'importe quoi (ce que l'on fait déjà un peu partout), donne une impression que l'économie va bien. Mais au final on est pas tellement plus riche par ce système (enfin nous 99% ;) )

What people seem to forget is that we as humans are nothing more than pack animals. We're naturally suspicious of outsiders, we're naturally inclined to look towards the interests of our group. We do this even internally within nations all the way down to the family level. If we accepted this fact we'd be much smarter and have less conflicts in the world. We're trying to change behaviour that has formed during a very, very long time, and we're trying to do this within a few decades. So obviously people will kick back and react.

What amazes me is that this natural tendency of people to be drawn to similar minded or similar groups is and has been known in science for a very long time. The formation of clusters of be their social, economical etc. are very known in the field of economy, sociology etc. So why can we not just accept that and work from there. No instead we're trying to push everyone towards some utopian goal that ends up blowing up in our faces, once again.

This is exactly what is happening within the EU and has been for a long time. The French, British, Greek, Spanish, Finnish, Swedish, German, Italian... all of us are looking for our own interests and because we don't have any common culture, language or anything except that we're all on the same continent makes this a very weird concoction. If we just accepted that we're all somewhat egoistic and look after our own interests then we'd be much better off than trying to pretend that everyone wants to equally share everything. It simply isn't what we humans do or have ever done. Not even when we're kids do we escape this.

From there you can continue south to [Mantova](https://www.google.it/maps/place/46100+Mantova+MN) it's a really nice town surrounded by lakes and it doesn't take long to visit.

Then you can take the A22 motorway to Modena (after Carpi you can see the old Bugatti Factory on the left, its a blue factory it should have bugatti logos still on it) , i think it's about a 1 hour drive, Maranello (where ferraris are built) it's really close too.

If you still have time you can then go to [Sant'Agata Bolognese](https://www.google.it/maps/place/40019+Sant'agata+Bolognese+BO) (half hour drive from Modena) there you can visit the [Lamborghini Museum](http://www.lamborghini.com/en/museum/overview/).

Parliament pass an act.

The Queen either signs  the bill ('grants royal assent') into law, abolishing her own position and annulling the requirement for her to ever sign anything into law in the future and everything is hunky dory. 

 *or* 

she refuses, in which case Parliament will claim that **A)** the Queen is ignoring the will of the democratically elected government and therefor the people **B)** Parliament is the truly sovereign body and therefor has the right to legislate on all matters with or without the Queen's assent **C)** that royal assent is not necessary for a bill to become law in the first place, because it is merely a constitutional convention that has never been written down in any official document and therefor can be ignored or **D)** all of the above. 

So long as Parliament genuinely has the will of a majority of an almost majority of the population behind it, then the monarchy will be abolished without much trouble. The worst that will happen is that a referendum is held and both parties agree to accept its verdict.

If the government does not have clear backing from the public then things could become very awkward for everyone involved, and for the status of the whole country, really. It'd become a full blown and serious constitutional crisis. It's not like there'd be a civil war, but pretty much every principle that underpins government (apart from those enshrined in statute law and maybe common law, which isn't much) would be in question. 

As for what the public's response for a swift and orderly abolishing of the monarchy would be: it would be a mixture of ""oh well. I thought they were alright"" to the other extreme ""glad to see the back of that"". As you can see, people would be deeply concerned. 

As for what would happen in the case of the more serious constitutional crisis, well, that really depends on how it plays out, which we can't know unless it happens. ",0,1402255673,null,0,false,0,ci2d0c1,t3_27mtw0,t1_ci2d0c1,t3_27mtw0,null,1434148976,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

- ovvio che uno che deve rappresentare quell'area lì deve per forza di cose fare aperture verso i cattolici. Peraltro distinguerei le scelte che riguardano l'area politica di centrosinistra in toto dai motivi per cui D'Alema avrebbe fallito (ma cosa? perché magari sono anche d'accordo, ma così è un po' vaga)

- Dare la responsabilità della riforma del mercato del lavoro a D'Alema è un po' lunare, forse devi considerare qualche piccolo passaggio successivo.

- Di nuovo, giudizi politici su l'operato del centrosinistra (che tra le altre cose è moderatamente interventista e nei conflitti internazionali sta col blocco atlantico, ed è uno dei motivi per cui non lo voto).

- Prodi l'ha creato lui, si è allevato una serpe in seno ma non mi pare che sia vietato lo scontro politico tra leader. Sulla Bicamerale e le sviolinate a Prodi bisognerebbe correggere tutti i racconti assolutamente pieni di minchiate con cui un'ala della sinistra (quella che fa capo a Repubblica) ha fatto la guerra a D'Alema negli ultimi vent'anni.
Per stringere, la legge sul conflitto di interessi la stavano preparando, ed è stato uno dei motivi per cui è saltata la bicamerale (che non era uno schiribizzo di D'Alema, era un modo per superare un impasse politico, tentativo fallito ma non sbagliato in sé)

Che poi abbia cercato di saldare un'area che ai tempi non poteva essere saldata, e che il suo progetto politico si è rivelato incompiuto sotto la sua guida non mi pare rilevi o che renda le cose che ha fatto deleterie (vatti a rivedere gli indicatori economici durante il primo governo D'Alema e il primo governo Prodi).

Detto questo, a me non manca particolarmente, ho sempre e solo sostenuto che ho una grandissima stima di lui.

there would need to be a referendum but there is a problem with our constitution. It doesn't allow anything else besides republic so we'd need a completely new one which would be very difficult to do and maybe unconstitutional or something.

I highly doubt this is true though...

EDIT:

Here is the real story, slightly less spectacular:

&gt; In 1990, when King Baudouin advised the government he could not, in conscience, sign a bill decriminalizing abortion, the Council of Ministers declared him incapable of exercising his powers at his own request. In accordance with the Belgian constitution, upon the declaration of the sovereign's incapacity, the Council of Ministers assumed the powers of the head of state until parliament could rule on the King's incapacity and appoint a regent. The bill was then assented to by all members of the Council of Ministers on the King's behalf. Both houses of parliament declared the King capable of exercising his powers again the next day.

Parliamentary sovereignty mostly applies to the primacy of UK Parliamentary law. For instance, the UK has no codified constitution that the courts can use to strike down laws, like in the USA (although some very weak examples of judicial review are in place due interesting ECJ rulings and the Human Rights Act). The other main manifestation of this, is that no Parliament can bind its successor Parliament. 

The really important thing to remember here though, is that Parliament isn't just the House of Commons and the House of Lords, but is also **arguably** includes the reigning monarch. Every single law in British history as received royal assent. There's obviously no written document which outlines the powers and responsibilities of difference branches of government.

The important thing to remember, is that everybody acknowledges that government should do what the public thinks best. Technically we have Parliamentary sovereignty (sovereignty of Parliament) rather than popular sovereignty (where the population are considered sovereign), but at the end of the day conventions and history account for nothing if you stop abiding by the fundamental tenants of democracy. So the nebulous question of whether or not a bill can become law without royal assent becomes irrelevant.

So anyway, my opinion on your current question is that I think it is the cornerstone of a democracy that the right to self-determination be upheld, and therefore this is really a question for Scottish people alone. I don't think it can be doubted that Scotland would be fine as an independent nation, but I think a lot of claims made on both sides of the debate with regards to the future economy of Scotland are quite unverifiable merely because the future cannot be predicted.

With regards to the campaigning I think both sides have been quite crafty. Westminster could probably have got a lot more information with regards to the Scottish position in the EU had they wanted. But similarly I think Salmond has been playing politics in announcing things (such as Scotland keeping the pound) that he really shouldn't.

We live in the liberal world, you can find oil wherever you think is cheaper. It also gives one more reason of having Russia as a trading partner (there is no competition between our products because we only import oil we don't have or which we can't produce, ok, maybe small quantities we can).

Yes, last time it turned out really nice, especially for you Kragujevcani.

Well Vucic truly is a dick but from the past we know that even corrupted Karadjordjevic who was corrupted as fuck was better for Serbian economy than Austria (After pig-war our economy grew really fast).

But let's get back from the past, can you please explain to me how the EU or Vucic plans to fix our budget vacuum if we kick Russians out. Also a lot of jobs simply depend on Russia and also they are one of our fastest rising export partners while import is steady. We are already in heavy shit and we entered recession after these floods. You really think that our politicians would not accept the easier solution if there was one?

There is also one thing worth a note, Serbia has a lot of German companies but the serious question is have you ever tried accessing the contracts between them and our government?

&gt;*What does “EU reform” actually mean?*

Cameron is the major player advocating reform:-

[The closest Cameron has got to setting out an EU ""shopping list"" yet few have noticed](http://openeuropeblog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/the-closest-cameron-has-to-got-to.html)

1. “Powers flowing away from Brussels, not always to it”
2. “National parliaments able to work together to block unwanted European legislation.”
3. “Businesses liberated from red tape and benefiting from the strength of the EU’s own market – the biggest and wealthiest on the planet – to open up greater free trade with North America and Asia.”
4. “Our police forces and justice systems able to protect British citizens, unencumbered by unnecessary interference from the European institutions, including the ECHR.”
5. “Free movement to take up work, not free benefits.”
6. ""Support for the continued enlargement of the EU to new members but with new mechanisms in place to prevent vast migrations across the Continent.”
7. ""Dealing properly with the concept of “ever closer union”.

Analysis of the prospects ie Treaty Change vs sub-treaty eg intergovernmental agreement is provided. Further analysis is provided in this independent blog on the chances of this, which more or less match OpenEurope's summary:-

[Cameron's EU Treaty Wish List vs. Likelihood of Implementation; Did Cameron Lose His Mind? Election Carrots in Play?](http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/camerons-eu-treaty-wish-list-vs.html)

Cameron's Wish List of Changes

1. National parliaments able to work together to block unwanted European legislation.
2. Businesses liberated from red tape and benefiting from the strength of the EU’s own market – the biggest and wealthiest on the planet – to open up greater free trade with North America and Asia.
3. Our police forces and justice systems able to protect British citizens, unencumbered by unnecessary interference from the European institutions, including the ECHR.
4. Free movement to take up work, not free benefits.
5. Support for the continued enlargement of the EU to new members but with new mechanisms in place to prevent vast migrations across the Continent.
6. So, yes to the single market. Yes to turbo-charging free trade. No to ever-closer union. No to a constant flow of power to Brussels. No to unnecessary interference.
7. No to participation in eurozone bailouts or notions such as a European Army.

&gt;*Proposal number 1 is straight from the looney bin. Cameron proposes setting up some sort of  committee that can block EU regulations that the majority of countries in the EU want.*  

&gt;*Proposals 2 and 6 limit the ability of the EU to set trade rules. If every country is free to create its own trade agreements, precisely what is the EU for?* 

&gt;*Proposals 3, 4, 6, and 7 make perfect sense except for the fact that Germany and France and likely the rest of the EU would never agree to change the treaty along those lines.*

&gt;*Nowhere does Cameron specifically mention financial transactions or absurd tariff proposals, but arguably they are implied in points 1 and 2.*

&gt;*Yet, without specific written agreements on agricultural subsidies, financial transaction taxes, bailouts, and even the funding of a European army, eventually the majority is going to rule.*

I've provided my own summary of why Cameron's REFORM is doomed also:-

Let's set the record straight on so-called ""reform + In + EU"" and why it is inherently dishonest communication even if this **Fallacy of the Middle Way** is politically pragmatic by Cameron:-

1. Time-Frame for Negotiation of Treaties =&gt; Impossible short
2. Period of Negotiations =&gt; Politically impossible (Ger/Fra elections)
3. Feasibility of Negotiations =&gt; Too improbable (28 members, EU Com/Par)
4. Clarity of Negotiations =&gt; Too deceptive (Wilsonian Fudge 1975)
5. Track-Record of Cameron =&gt; Too many lies
6. Track-Record of Barroso, Reding, Shulz, Hollande, Merkel =&gt; Clear opposition.
7. Track-Record of EU =&gt; ""EVER CLOSER UNION""

Next we don't hear any of the key-words that we need to hear for valid and viable communication and reform:-

1. Article 50 TEU Lisbon Treaty, Article 50 TEU Lisbon Treaty, Article 50 Lisbon Treaty...
2. EEA (European Economic Area) &gt; Associate Membership Status (eu)
3. Federal United States of Europe = EU Tax Treaty, post-2017
4. Global regulatory bodies (Geneva) &gt; European Union (Brussels)
5. SOVEREIGNTY of Parliament, Common Law &gt; Community Law (ECJ, ECHRs)
6. Eurozone Crisis is insolvable
7. Arrears Of referendums (Single Act, Maastrict, Amsterdamn, Nice, Lisbon (and EURO), all lied about via FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt).

=

The summary is that major reform within the Treaty structure can only be minor. Major reform can only lead to a new Treaty and that is not going to happen in the time-frame that Cameron wants. Treaty reform itself for the EU will center on Integration of the EZ to save the EURO. Hence even with a Treaty change reform of the kind wanted/demanded seems unlikely.

Don't worry about it mate, I probably used words myself that I shouldn't.

One thing I have thought in passing though is that I think Cameron played a fantastic political move (and that isn't a compliment) by making it an in/out referendum. My own guess (and I'm not Scottish so I could be way off the mark) is that Salmond was probably banking for devo-max to push for another referendum in the near future. By taking devo-max from the referendum (even if it is now on the cards) I think it forced a true independence debate (on the basis that I don't think there would be enough support for independence if devo-max was an option on the ballot) perhaps a few years before Salmond probably envisaged.

Ça peut paraître assez paradoxal, mais je pense que le régime de Vichy a permis de sauver une partie des juifs français. Je ne sais pas si c'était voulu, mais la séparation du pays en 2 zones a permis aux juifs qui étaient conscients des persécutions à venir (une bonne partie ne voulait pas y croire) d'essayer de passer en zone libre pour ensuite rejoindre des territoires plus sûrs (Suisse, Italie, Espagne puis Portugal).

Je pense que les négociations menées avant la rafle du Vel' d'Hiv ont quand même montré qu'une partie des responsables du régime de Vichy voyait dans les juifs français avant tout des français. Par contre, aucune pitié pour les juifs étrangers ou apatrides...

Ça me paraît important qu'on puisse parler de ces sujets. Ce n'est pas forcément facile d'accepter que tous les responsables du régime de Vichy n'étaient pas des monstres, et il faut toujours soigneusement peser ses mots avant d'en parler (c'est d'ailleurs ce que j'ai essayé de faire ici, j'espère ne pas avoir dit de bêtise), mais il ne faut pas laisser l'extrême-droite s'emparer de ces sujets pour glorifier Pétain.",0,1402259639,null,0,false,0,ci2epj1,t3_27mq28,t1_ci2epj1,t1_ci2dzap,null,1434149843,10,false,france,t5_2qhjz,10

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  * going back to a monarchy would mean a new constitution: for that, we would need an agreement of 3/5 of the two chambers and a referendum

Actually, two changes are needed: first change the article 89 (which states that the ""Republican form of the Government cannot be the sibject of a revision) and then actually change the form og the government. 

&gt;for that, we would need an agreement of 3/5 of the two chambers and a referendum

Nope.

If it's a projet de loi (bill proposed by the Government), both the Senate and the National Assembly have to vote the bill, then it is a referendum. However, the president can decide not to use a referendum but instead to have the Parliament gathered in Congress vote on the revision with a majority of 3/5.

If it's a proposition de loi (bill proposed by MPs), both the Senate and the National Assembly have to vote the bill, then it is a referendum.

**HOWEVER**

The article 89 with referendum was never used, it was always used with Congress ^yay, ^democracy. Revision with a referendum happened through the article 11, controversy at first but the 2008 reform makes it more legitimate to use this article (the addition of ""portant sur l'organisation des pouvoirs publics"").

It should also be noted that:

* The constitutional council has so far stated that it is not competent to judge the constitutionality of laws voted by referendum as the French People is the sovereign. Therefore an article 11 referendum could bypass the article 89 limitation ^hypothetical or even any limitation (use of the pouvoir constituant originaire rather than the pouvoir constituant dérivé, thus with no limitations ^no ^idea ^how ^to  ^translate ).

* It is not impossible that the Council states that monarchy is not possible because of a new PFRLR or a PVC

The current constitution is based on an illegal change to the constitution of 1867 in 1918.   
The Emperor did not approve it and neither did one part of the Reichsrat, therefore it is null and void.  

To actually get the Habsburgs back (lawfully), a referendum would need to be held since they are banned from all political positions and largely banned from the country, which would obviously need to change.  
The change of the law would also need to pass the National Assembly with 2/3 of votes (at 50+% attendance).

And the Staatsvertrag from 1955 would need to voided as well, since that also contains a guarantee of Austria that it keeps the Habsburgs out. For that the UK, US, France, and Russia would need to approve.  
Theoretically though, seeing as the Habsburgs are citizens of the EU, this clause was already voided when Austria entered the EU and freedom of movement was established.
