Wrong. The vast majority of asylum seekers are refused as their claims are proved to be false. Being from a developing country is not grounds for asylum.

We don't owe everyone in the developing world a better life. Europe is not a global soup kitchen for the waifs and strays of this world. Africa's population is set to double in just one generation.

We owe them nothing but a kick up the hole and a swift deportation.  If they want to live here, they can apply for a work visa.

&gt;Europe, even speaking as a continent, would not exist if it wasn't for migration. And migration, or the emigration of nation

Eh, yes it would. Native Europeans have been here for thousands of years.

&gt; it's been there forever, so why do you expect it to stop now?

Never on this scale. Come here with a visa and a skill we need, welcome. If not, fuck off. It's that simple.

You seem to have a bone to pick with Europeans and support criminal trespassers. Odd. Are you of immigrant stock?

Edit: it seems that you are hispanic. Interesting.

[Source](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/12/us-usa-energy-reserves-idUSBREA2B12V20140312).

Seems like the US was just sending Russia a friendly reminder that it is sitting on [700 million barrels](http://www.spr.doe.gov/dir/dir.html) of oil in its SPR stockpile alone (Strategic Petroleum Reserve). This does not include actual pumping capacity. 

The former Russian Finance Minister, and Putin ally, warned US/EU sanctions could cause [$100 billion of capital outflows](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5d5a9cbe-aad0-11e3-83a2-00144feab7de.html#ixzz2vy8lE8oS) per quarter. That is huge. 

Any downward pressure on energy prices could be catastrophic along with sanctions. Experts estimate Russia's budget needs oil at [$120 per barrel](http://business.time.com/2012/07/05/why-vladimir-putin-needs-higher-oil-prices/) to remain viable. It is nowhere near that right now, and the US could collapse the price further. Depressing the price of energy while foreign capital is pouring out of Russia from every angle could cause the entire economy to collapse. 

Economic pain could actually be more harmful for Russia than a military conflict. ",0,1395278292,null,0,false,0,cg70lts,t3_20utx4,t1_cg70lts,t3_20utx4,null,1432983813,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Of course not all of them. But I repeat again, job oppurtunities are available, people are just too comfortable at their homes (not to say *lazy* again) to leave their region/country to find a better life, which is exactly what Africans are doing... which, love them or hate them, deserves respect. Try crossing the Mediterranean on a fisher boat.
Plus, if Europe as an institution, would flip things around, and make Africa more attractive (than it already is) for Europeans to go work there, and at the same time, incentive the Africans to stay where they're from, that would be a great step towards a correct solution (instead of shooting people).


&gt;Wrong. The vast majority of asylum seekers are refused as their claims are proved to be false. Being from a developing country is not grounds for asylum.

Can't really argue that argument of yours lol. But I would like to know how those claims are ""proved to be false"", also, not to be another annoying redditor, but can you back that argument in any way. (I'm seriously interested.)


&gt;We don't owe everyone in the developing world a better life. Europe is not a global soup kitchen for the waifs and strays of this world. Africa's population is set to double in just one generation. Do you think the EU has an infinite capacity to absorb immigrants from the third world? Immigrants who are largely unskilled?

Ethically speaking, we do owe everyone a better life. That's human nature.. that's at least how I see it. I don't want to be the guy that watches as people starve or are oppressed by their politicians, while I'm chilling in Europe.. a place I never had to fight for, other generations did though. Taking everything for granted is precisely what brings Europe down... you didn't really have to do anything to get the amazing life you have, so why not give back and help the ones that were **not** so lucky when they were born.


&gt;Where are these Africans going to work? Do they speak Spanish or Italian? Who will pay for their housing? They largely education. Who will pay for that? Their medical fees etc?

First off, this is not really a strong argument, I agree, but a lot of Africans (north or sub-sahara) speak either spanish, english, french or portuguese.
But secondly, what tells you their goal is Spain or Italy? Those countries just happen to be the closest points of access, to enter what? Exactly, the European Union, a space of free movement... who would have thought that Africans might want to go as far as Germany? Norway? Poland? 


&gt;Eh, yes it would. Native Europeans have been here for thousands of years.

Native Europeans are known to have migrated a lot... I never meant to say that Europe was empty and ""got filled"" thanks to migration, I am saying that the migration within and in-and-out of Europe has made Europe what it is today. 
But to get back to your argument... even those native europeans had to get there somehow. Migration is natural, there is no need to try to stop that.


&gt;You seem to have a bone to pick with Europeans and support criminal trespassers. Odd. Are you of immigrant stock?

I have a bone to pick with people that think their better because they had the luck to be born in Europe. I hate that attitude, that's it. 
It's not the immigrants' fault that they were born wherever they come from.. it's obvious they need some help, so might as well help them.
And no, I'm of European stock. Odd. Born and raised in Europe. Odd.

Russia, if you remember, has [2x GDP per capita](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html), a far more robust jobs market (I have a lot of Ukrainian friends who work in Russia) and overall Russia despite all its lack of freedom is still a more economically viable nation than Ukraine. 

Ukraine is bankrupt and politically divided right now. It's going to be taking terms from IMF and the terms will be harsh, because the budget has to be set right again. The Soviet-era subsidies will be cut, jobs will be cut, economy is going to spiral downwards. Life there will get very tough very soon.

Jesus, is it that much of a stretch if USA fabricated an entire genocide to mandate the Kosovo bombardment? And you keep insisting that Libya was a EU-initiated operation. CIA spent [30 years](http://www.acorn.net/jfkplace/03/Test-CIA/LIBYA) trying to kill the guy. And just like in Kosovo there was bullshit about *government killing their own people* all over the news, even though there was *no fucking evidence* of it whatsoever. How am I stretching the facts? There is no need for it, its too easy as it is. A US General Wesley Clark testified that [US government was planning the whole *Arab Spring* as early as 2007 already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bdbtqYO6yk). And he's not just some conspiracy nut on reddit, hes a fucking US General. Then you had these protester killings in Ukraine and they turned out to be false flags as well. They still didn't find the ones responsible. And they are not very eager to look for them either for some reason. In a couple of years there will probably be yet another round of leaks saying that CIA sponsored the whole thing from start to end and no one is even going to bat an eye, mark my words.

And its not just me who dismisses the actions of Russia here, you can listen to [Ron Paul](http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/03/17/crimea-ukraine-russia-ron-paul-editorials-debates/6544163/) if you like. Or is he also a US-hater?

&gt;Ukraine is not all that important to the US.

Then what the fuck is US doing picking who's going to be the next president there? Why are there US politicians, diplomats and probably CIA as well all over Ukraine?

&gt;99.99% of the world's problems are the fault of the US

You've read my posts wrong. This had never been my opinion. My opinion is that 99.99% of US problems are the fault of US. Its not the fault of Putin, lil Kim in Korea, its not Iran mullahs, not Jihadis in Pakistan or Afghanistan, nor is it due to EU *indecisiveness* and its not due to China rising. No, its all US and no one else.

US should really get their own shirt sorted before getting involved in other countries affairs. Fixing the leaks in their intelligence services might be a good place to start. Because its already embarrassing as it is. In a different country you would probably have an uprising already. But US *hooray-patriots* seem to be just as clueless as their Russian counter-parts. Its like you know, there is this joke: There can never be a Revolution in America. Why? because there is no American embassy there.

And Obama is not going to fix any of these problems by getting on a high horse and denouncing Putin. Who's only as corrupt as Obama himself, but at least he's not a fucking retard. And by the way, Russia has a health care system more accessible  than anything US ever had and Putin never spent [$100 mil on a fucking vacation](http://www.frontpagemag.com/2013/dgreenfield/national-lampoons-100-million-obama-africa-vacation/), so theres that as well.

You're guessing. Look up the stats. Look up their welfare reliance, their crime stats and their reliance on free social housing. Look up Amsterdam, once the gay capital of the world; 

&gt;If you think Amsterdam is the gay capital of Europe, you're half-right, but 10 years out of date. Today it's the gay-bashing capital of Europe.Because Amsterdam isn't just gay. Now it's Muslim, too. A million Moroccans and Turks have immigrated to the Netherlands, and sharia law rules the streets.If you doubt it, then you haven't been paying attention. Actually, that's not fair. Gay-bashing is front-page news only when it's committed by a straight, white male.The media is terribly uncomfortable writing about gay-bashing by minorities. It's the same reason why Canadian feminists are so eerily quiet about honour killings of Muslim girls.According to an ""offender study"" by the University of Amsterdam, there were 201 reports of anti-gay violence in that city in 2007 - and researchers believe for every reported case there are as many as 25 unreported ones. Two thirds of the predators are Muslim youths.

Modern Western liberalism is inextricably bound up with multiculturalism and mass immigration. The left wing has thrown their entire lot in with multiculturalism, and there's no turning that particular clock back.However, the presence of these pathologically illiberal non-Western immigrants will rapidly consign other liberal causes to the dustbin of history. Already, the ""new Dutch"", ""new Swedes"", ""new Brits"", and ""new French"" are busily engaged in the creation of enclaves in which every pet progressive cause is set back roughly one millennium. Mature, forward-thinking liberals (giving them the benefit of the doubt here and assuming that some such creatures exist) will have to choose between their multiracial, multicultural utopias and a civilization in which things like tolerance for homosexuality, religious freedom, and equal gender rights are possible. And sooner rather than later. In their heart of hearts, they know Wilders is right.

Would love to have you here or at the very least not give a damn if you were here or not.

However here something seems to be different. The bigger cities seem to be magnets for immigrants or maybe better said these specific groups. (Islam in Belgium: 3.9% in Flanders, 4% in Wallonia, 25.5% in Brussels and growing) What happens when a group becomes so large and is already so distinct from it's surroundings and plastered with prejudice? They bunch up and isolate themselves or form ghettos worsening the problem even more .

Stereotypes and prejudice start to form whilst their and our nuts as always scream the loudest. The first 2 parties representing this minority to pass the voting treshold push Sharia and one of contained criminals and extreme radicals, these immigrants 1st, 2nd or 3rd generation have massive over-representation in the crime stats, Certain neighbourhoods may become unsafe for gay people or even women. 

And the response society given is equally bad. (See Wilders or Vlaams Belang)     

Thing is the way it is now the situation is only going to polarize even more.

Brussles went from a nearly purely Dutch speaking city to a somewhat evenly split one around 1910 due to some broken language laws. Now it's a nearly homogeneous French speaking part of Belgium but almost nobody minds. Sure it had it's backlash in the past and maybe even today depending on who you ask but that's still the past.

However Islam has been growing a lot faster both due to higher birthrates and immigration. There will be many that remain moderate but if Muslim immigrants become the majority and/or start putting significant influence on policymaking even if it were just a tiny bit for the worse I'm near certain that the backlash is going to be a lot less soft whether you or me like that or not.

true,modomario,BELG,Belgium - Flanders,"&gt;Europe's problems seem to be from importing non-skilled immigrants and then having trouble integrating them into an already precarious continental economy. 

Not purely that. ""non-skilled immigrants"" are needed too and the start of this immigration can be traced back quite a bit.

Our coalmines before their close and during their highdays had troubles remaining competitive. So they imported immigrants for these jobs for which the locals were too costly or unwilling. First from countries like Italy and eastern Europe. Hence our gay prime-minister is son to 2 Italian immigrants and Limburg and probably other places as well have a significant ""ethnic Italian"" minorities. There was some initial ""tey took er jerbs"" prejudice but it flew by. Same for the Polish and other Eastern Europeans as car burgling gangs from around those parts caused a bad image. Again that flew by relatively quickly. All of these were people filling jobs with low qualifications. 

&gt;Eventually and during that time they went looking elsewhere for jobs in Morroco, Turkey and places like that.  In the aftermath of the two World Wars, and more intensively since the 1960s, Belgium set out to attract inflows of immigrant labor migration. Bilateral agreements were concluded with Southern European and Northern African countries as well as Turkey within a flexible work-permit regime accompanied by lenient family reunification rules.

Often these men were promised good accommodation, they took their wives and families with them.
These groups were more distinct in every possible way then the southern/eastern europeans. Culturally, religiously, linguistically, visually,... they attracted further family and friends and so on. They weren't the only ones though neocolonial immigrants, economical immigrants, refugees and so on have arrived over time too. It's simply better living here. Though towards the 80's the immigration policy was restricted and tightened quite a bit.

But...Well most didn't integrate as the previous groups did or didn't add much. The (chasidic) jews for example, isolate themselves probably even more and are just as recognisable but made Antwerp into a city known for it's diamonds, are very well educated and employed on average and  whilst being a comparatively tiny group and never caused much of a fuzz.

So what are some reasons for all this? (Most I've mentioned before)

* Their numbers in the bigger cities.
* The fact that they're considered so different in most ways.(compared to for example a Polish or Italian immigrant)
* A more assertive stance towards a society that doesn't seem to accept them due to reasons mentioned now. This mostly among the younger generations.
* The fact that this makes it much easier to form prejudice. (Some white guy. Could steal my phone and I wouldn't have the slightest clue whether he's from Belgium, Poland, Russia or not but an Arab or African is quickly identified as such and his fellow man put in the same category as him.)
* The bad ruining it for the good. (Crime rates due to poverty and prejudice, religious nuts that call for attacks on gays or Sharia.)
* The Belgian/Western European system. You can't just put someone on a plane when he fails to show a passport. Nope years of paperwork to fill ya know (more recently a big fuzz about a kid being send back after spending 8 years here. Most of it attributed to slow procedures) in addition to a previously too easily exploitable social safety net and so on.
* Social housing. Putting them all together in a cheap neighbourhood or apartment block doesn't inscentivize integration. Closed of communities don't help.
* Culture and welfare. Big families are not uncommon and here very easily supported.
* Big cities give more job opportunities also with a low education and provide a pre-existing Muslim/Moroccan/whatever community.
* A subculture that forms that is somewhat unlike that of their country of origin and more radical even to offset against society. It remember not so long ago friends going to turkey and being surprised at how friendly the locals were. How unlike what they said they were used to.
* ...

From my experience Parties like Vlaams Belang or that of Geert Wilders tend to hold stupid/simplistic views both on existing groups and immigration but also other maybe more important fields. That won't stop this from becoming a slowly growing issue that will cause these parties to gain ground though.

The fact that there's a contrast with other immigrant groups just enforces all of this.

The problem is that there's nearly no mainstream reasoning going on to fix or ease this. The issue is polarized as fuck.
The mainstream parties try to steer clear of this whilst the more right wing parties are heavily focusing on this issue and in the worst ways possible making it so that mainstream parties tend to be even more afraid of touching the issue in some countries.

Hell this bloody same thing happens on way too many issues.

&gt;
&gt;L’indifferenza è il peso morto della storia. L’indifferenza opera potentemente nella storia. Opera passivamente, ma opera. È la fatalità; è ciò su cui non si può contare; è ciò che sconvolge i programmi, che rovescia i piani meglio costruiti; è la materia bruta che strozza l’intelligenza. Ciò che succede, il male che si abbatte su tutti, avviene perché la massa degli uomini abdica alla sua volontà, lascia promulgare le leggi che solo la rivolta potrà abrogare, lascia salire al potere uomini che poi solo un ammutinamento potrà rovesciare. Tra l’assenteismo e l’indifferenza poche mani, non sorvegliate da alcun controllo, tessono la tela della vita collettiva, e la massa ignora, perché non se ne preoccupa; e allora sembra sia la fatalità a travolgere tutto e tutti, sembra che la storia non sia altro che un enorme fenomeno naturale, un’eruzione, un terremoto del quale rimangono vittime tutti, chi ha voluto e chi non ha voluto, chi sapeva e chi non sapeva, chi era stato attivo e chi indifferente. Alcuni piagnucolano pietosamente, altri bestemmiano oscenamente, ma nessuno o pochi si domandano: se avessi fatto anch’io il mio dovere, se avessi cercato di far valere la mia volontà, sarebbe successo ciò che è successo?
&gt;
&gt;Odio gli indifferenti anche per questo: perché mi dà fastidio il loro piagnisteo da eterni innocenti. Chiedo conto a ognuno di loro del come ha svolto il compito che la vita gli ha posto e gli pone quotidianamente, di ciò che ha fatto e specialmente di ciò che non ha fatto. E sento di poter essere inesorabile, di non dover sprecare la mia pietà, di non dover spartire con loro le mie lacrime.
&gt;
&gt;Sono partigiano, vivo, sento nelle coscienze della mia parte già pulsare l’attività della città futura che la mia parte sta costruendo. E in essa la catena sociale non pesa su pochi, in essa ogni cosa che succede non è dovuta al caso, alla fatalità, ma è intelligente opera dei cittadini. Non c’è in essa nessuno che stia alla finestra a guardare mentre i pochi si sacrificano, si svenano. Vivo, sono partigiano. Perciò odio chi non parteggia, odio gli indifferenti”.

true,bxlexpat,null,null,"I live in Europe now and somehow muslims in Europe are a bit more hard core. 

And the easiest way to explain this is by saying that I work with a Moroccan colleague. He was born and raised in Rabat. 

He moved to Belgium because of work and then moved into a predominantly Moroccan neighborhood in Brussels. He told us that he got the fuck out of there because he couldn't identify with the moroccans living there and as he said, not even the moroccans in morocco were that backwards in terms of religion. 

To put it in mild terms, his observation was that muslims in Europe took islam to a whole new level of fanaticism and even he couldn't cope with that and he was muslim and moroccan. Thought it was quite interesting.

What i have noticed is that many european women don't feel comfortable in some areas of Brussels because of the way muslim men treat them. I found a rather objective piece of this film that came out last year, but what they don't tell you is that where this usually happens, is in predominantly islamic hoods:

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/03/belgium-film-street-harassment-sofie-peeters

If you watch the video, you'll see that most men doing the 'insulting' are not of the white type and guaranteed they are all devout muslims. And I'm sure this type of stuff does not happen with muslims in the USA or Canada or if it happens, it is not as widespread as it is in Europe. I think is because you get the higher educated muslims there and they integrate better than those living in Europe.

If you take those gore-coloured fantasy glasses off, you will realise that Russia is not attacking Finland, as it would make no sense on any level. In comparison, even I can see some warped sense in annexing Crimea. To assume that the Russian military would allow Putin to go on lunatic missions that risk the breakout of WW3 is just inane. And attacking an EU country would be just that.

Yes, Finland has an army and Hägglund no doubt wants more money for it and can now safely talk shit as he would not have to take part in any actual defending in case a war did break out. To take an old man's ramblings seriously when he so clearly has his own agenda to push just shows what fools some Finns are. 
Wars are not ever won on the ground, they are lost there, by both parties. You might be willing to pick a fight with the Russian army, but don't assume that all Finns see this as a primary course of action.The purpose of a reasonably well-equipped army is to prevent military action, not to pick a fight with a big bully next door. I just find Finnish internet warriors a bit deluded and childish. If you think it shows good form to always bring up the same old Winter War nostalgia and military paranoia, we just have to disagree on what we think is essential about foreign policy. Some military nutcase essentially expressing a challenge to Russia, saying they 'wouldn't dare' come to Finland, is just, well, stupid.

true,DFractalH,EURO,Großdeutschland,"&gt;Europe's problems seem to be from importing non-skilled immigrants and then having trouble integrating them into an already precarious continental economy. 

Now if I told you that if you bring *this* up in Germany, you get identified with the far-right? It's literally what the AFD (a new right-wing party here in Germany) wanted for immigration reform. They even said they wanted a ""Canadian"" model. Yet this was one of the core points people criticised and used as 'proof' to deem them racist.

I didn't vote for them because of quite a lot of other issues, but this wasn't one of them. 

There's not even any room for reasonable debate about practical immigration policies, it seems. I don't know how it is in the Netherlands. But if it's as bad as it's here, you get such polarisation as we observe now. People start to deem ""mainstream society"" as unwilling to tackle a definite problem.

Edit: 

I wanted to add the following: I have double citizenship. My father isn't German, but he's from one of the rich EU countries. He still learned the language and retrained to get a job. There are plenty of immigrants from all over the world who do the same, with far worse starting positions. They are not a problem, and they are welcome not only as long as they work. I personally would love if they made Germany, or Europe, their home.

Problems do not arise if both sides of the divide are trying to make it work. It is true that society is doing not nearly enough to integrate all parts of itself, partly because stricter measures are seen as problematic politically. But is is equally true that such strict measures are only required because certain parts of the immigrat population, as a whole, are resistant to the weaker efforts we have staged so far.

Hence we need a comphrehensive immigration and integration policy, and by extension a free and reasonable discussion about such things before we can implement them.",0,1395300126,null,0,1395304727,0,cg78ift,t3_20usi0,t1_cg78ift,t1_cg76077,null,1432987612,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Essa riecheggia gravemente alla campana di tutte le politiche, affinché tu non lo scorda: tutti alle urne, nessuna astensione. Ecco il ritornello finale delle diverse suonerie. Non votare è un peccato, dice il cattolico. Non votare è da cattivi cittadini, dice il repubblicano. Non votare è tradire i propri fratelli, dice il socialista. Cos’è dunque votare? È scegliere da sé il padrone che vi prenderà a frustate, che vi deruberà. L’operaio forgia le catene che lo legano, costruisce le prigioni che lo rinchiudono, fabbrica i fucili che lo uccidono. Impasta la brioche che non mangerà, tesse i vestiti che non indosserà. Ma questo non gli sembra sufficiente. Vuole sembrare il padrone, il popolo sovrano, e sceglie lui stesso coloro che gli toseranno la lana sul dorso. È il bestiame, il gregge che nomina i suoi pastori. Crede che sia impossibile non essere guidati, tanto vale allora prendersi lo sfizio di scegliere i pastori che colpiranno la sua schiena e i cani che morderanno i suoi talloni. Uomo che vuoi votare, rifletti! Rifletti bene. I ricchi sono potenti solo grazie ai loro pastori e ai loro cani. Ma la forza dei pastori e dei cani deriva solo dalla tua accettazione, dalla tua obbedienza, dal tuo voto. Non mettere più la scheda nell’urna. Restatene a casa o vai a zonzo. Fregatene del voto. La tua forza non è in un pezzo di carta. È nel tuo cervello, nel tuo braccio, nella tua volontà, quando saprai impiegarli a fare gli affari tuoi e non quelli degli altri.

In 2007, Romania had a 7800$ per capita GDP (while this doesn't really give that good of an indication on quality of life, it does give a decent one on how strong the economy was), so all Moldova needs is some years of strong growth and political reform, the the chances of joining the EU will increase.               
The main reason why there is so much negativity towards Romania in Bulgaria right now in the EU, in my personal opinion, is because of the recent years of economic stagnation the Eurozone has had and since a lot of Romanians and Bulgarians emigrated to various EU nations, it's easy to put the blame on them for various economic issues those countries might have.               
             
Considering Romania is starting to see strong growth again, (5.1% GDP growth in the last quarter), I think the negativity will slowly die down and it might also help Moldova join faster, since our economies are becoming quite interconnected and there is a lot of political will on Romania's side to help the Rep. of Moldova.

Whatever word you use to describe (usually Russians use ""slow"") Estonians we are never ever radical about pretty much anything. Most of Estonians usually hate anything authoritarian, thats why we never liked communist party. Nationalism? Yes there is nationalism, but it's never aggressive. Also we have less of it then most nations. Mostly Estonians are individualists of ""live and let live"" type.

&gt; Fascists sought to unify their nation through a totalitarian state that promoted the mass mobilization of the national community

Estonians hate anything totalitarian, we are individualists of highest degree.

&gt;  a devotion to a strong leader

rofl, usually Estonians hate strong leaders. We are individualists and rarely listen to any ""leader"". 

&gt;  Fascism views political violence, war, and imperialism as a means to achieve national rejuvenation[5][8][9][10] and asserts that stronger nations have the right to expand their territory by displacing weaker nations.

HOW???? Look map. No seriously, where do we expand? We go and take potato from our Latvian brothers or something? Or we attack Russia and occupy Moscow? It does sound ridiculous to me.

Elections in Germany are very boring and about many detailed issues, about tweaking formulas to this or that rate, etc. Since Germany is a multi-party system, issues are not defined along one axis only, which means that choosing a party is way more complicated, to the point of making you feel disenfranchised by its complexity. I think this makes people less loyal to the party, but allows them to focus more on issues. 

Also, there is less emphasis on being a leader to rally under and more on being a manager. A big shock was how little of a role the family (or dog) of the candidates play in the election. Think about it: Angela Merkel essentially won because she was a really boring candidate with more management experience, and most people didn't feel loyal enough to their parties to counteract that. Can you imagine someone in the USA winning because they are boring? I realized that elections should feel more like job interviews than choosing the prom queen. 

Since people are less loyal to parties and leaders, this has an effect on the popular reactions to the news: there is less of us-vs-them, there is more discussion of specifics, less mention of values, and more acknowledgement that things are complicated and have many dimensions. This doesn't always translate necessarily into smarter choices, or more rational options. But, at least the fragmentation of the issues among many parties do keep some core of the issue with more sensible middle ground than in the USA, where it is too bipartisan.  I think that in Germany, since there is so much middle ground in these issues, this pulls everyone towards the center politics, while in the USA everyone is pulled out to the extremes (and towards the crazies). In Germany issues stay complicated at the level of negotiation and governing, such that normal people have difficulty feeling too strongly about them. In contrast, in the USA issues are simplified at the highest levels of negotiation, which makes it very difficult for  governing, but very easy for normal people to feel very strongly about every issue.

As someone else said, this is all true except when talking about immigration and bail-outs, where things quickly turns into us-vs-them.

Without the thin plastic bag I have 1) to buy a bag containing much more plastic, 2) buy plastic containers for harvesting my vegetables 3) buy a strong plastic bag for my rubbish.

&gt;  These are rarely just Soviet era transplants, most of those returned to Russia after the fall of the USSR.

Vast majority was Soviet era transplants. Most never returned to Russia. A lot of them took money, returned to Russia, but left family in Estonia and came back to Estonia because of ""family reasons"". Also some just took money and never even left.

&gt;  Many of them come from families that have lived in the region for generations and generations. 

Yes, some of them do. They are not really problem. 

&gt; I have a Russian grandmother who was born in Latvia of the same type, she can trace her family's existence in Latvia back over 180 years. 

Yes like I told there are some. We have 15000 of these in Estonia too.

&gt; Not really ridiculous in that case for them to insist upon equal treatment and protest to discrimination. 

What equal treatment? I never understood that part. 

&gt; While I do oppose Russia's actions in regards to Ukraine, the situation of Russians in the Baltic States actually is pretty rough. 

Seriously? You should take of your tinted glasses. I'm old, I remember. If you think this is rough... well.... I have no words. There are same laws for Estonians and Russians, we do not have special ""Russian laws"". Our citizenship laws have less requirements then most countries INCLUDING Russia.

&gt; Hell, in several of those countries the old militias that fought with the Nazis and killed Slavs and Jews are still heralded as heroes by many.

What? You totally misunderstand what is going on. Those were front troops. If they killed Slavs and Jews on front, then it happened because those Slavs and Jews were on opposing army. Yes, we had our own war criminals, every nation had those. Ours were prosecuted and punished.

However much you search you will not find any involvement in killing in concentration camps. How I know? KGB searched for decades and even they never managed to put something together.

One time Germans tried to use our troops as outer perimeter guards, soldiers mutinied and beated up their officer.

The ""youths"" are Dutch-born second- or even third-generation residents.

Sober, I was denied entry to discos and, even more bewilderingly, spas, while drunken Swedish friends just walked in. Women changed street sides when they noticed me walking nearby. I was profoundly angry by this treatment, and I got only a very small taste of what the ""Moroccan youths"" experience since birth.

In this thread (so far) Europeans, Europe and European-ness are all appearing to be very superior in a direct comparison to the USA. 

It's nice to have some ballast in a thread that says whilst we may have the right to be relatively proud of ourselves in one area, we shouldn't get carried away. For instance, whilst our media is much more impartial (generally) than in the US and our election campaigns (generally) more about the issues than the people and the rhetoric, we still have problems A) with those systems in themselves and B) problems elsewhere like racism. 

/u/executivemonkey also didn't state that this was not a problem in his home country, but simply that it is a problem, and a deeply divisive problem here. 

For all intents and purposes (except when a user is not making a direct comparison between their place of living and another place of living) we should ignore where a user comes from when responding to them. It leads us to making conclusions about them which are unfounded, like you, /u/Igelkotten, making the assumption that /u/executivemonkey was saying that the USA doesn't have a problem with racism.

And the Minister of Education is not a Svoboda member, even though he is a right winger. The Head of the Anti-Corruption Bureau, [Tetiana Chornovol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetiana_Chornovol), is not Svoboda either. Neither is [Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Parubiy) who was elected on the Fatherland ticket, although he might be sympathetic to some of Svoboda's views since he was more radical 25 years ago.

It seems you might have your list from this Wikipedia entry, which seems to be riddled with errors: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svoboda_(political_party)#List_of_Svoboda_figures_in_the_current_government

I'd refer you to [the Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Ministers_of_Ukraine#Cabinet) on the Ukrainian cabinet and [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1zdvc7/why_is_everyone_so_supportive_of_the_ukrainian/cft4qma) I've made previously, which goes through the cabinet one by one to find out how many right wing radicals there are. The conclusion:

&gt; Out of a cabinet of 17 posts there are 4 confirmed Svoboda members and 1 other minister, the minister of education, who is a right winger, although we don't know how much.

As to the question if this is a lot: In multiparty parliamentarian systems, where coalition building is the order of the day, there is nothing unusual about a small party gaining a lot of minister posts. However in this case let's also remember that Svoboda's representation in the Ukrainian parliament is 10 % even though they're polled at 5 % currently.

Let's compare to my own country, Denmark, where the Social-Liberal party is a part of the government. They got 9.5 % of the votes. [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Helle_Thorning-Schmidt_II) you can see that the Social-Liberals have the following posts:

* Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Economic and Interior Affairs
* Minister for Foreign Affairs
* Minister for Trade and Development Cooperation
* Minister for Culture and Church
* Minister for Taxation
* Minister for Research, Innovation and Higher Education
* Minister for Integration and Social Affairs
* Minister for Climate and Energy 

So 8 out of 20 minister posts. Compare that to Svoboda's 4 out of 17 posts.",0,1395308946,null,0,1395310706,0,cg79yuj,t3_20tyhu,t1_cg79yuj,t1_cg70406,null,1432988297,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Thing is, we are talking about the Netherlands. And in the Netherlands, there is a backwards religious group that considers that women are not equal to men and have long resisted their political representation, has a strict and ""modest"" dress code for them, definitely condemns homosexuality and sex outside marriage, lives in notoriously separated, repressive communities, and tries to impose its religious codes on its neighbours, notably repressing the sale of alcohol.

OVVIAMENTE i bambini africani non stanno meglio se uno finisce tutto quello che ha nel piatto.
OVVIAMENTE non è che si può spedire loro ciò che avanziamo.
E' puramente una questione di dignità: sprecare il cibo buttandolo perché non ci va più dovrebbe farci sentire in colpa perché mentre ci permettiamo di fare i capricci c'è gente che invece muore di fame.
Però, ritengo sbagliato pure ingozzarsi fino a scoppiare, ed è per questo che il ""fix"" definitivo è saper scegliere preventivamente la quantità di cibo che si vuole mangiare.
Se uno sbaglia e non ce la fa a finire, è giusto che si debba sentire in colpa per lo spreco (in generale e nei confronti di chi muore di fame).

Therefore, any violent event that occurs from now on can be blamed by Russia on Ukraine and/or ""Western powers"". Control over Crimea is made easier by its geographical situation, with a short land border with Ukraine that can be easily controlled. Russian troops also took advantage of the shift of government in Ukraine that made it difficult for its armed forces to get clear directives on how to act against the invading forces. These conditions are not necessarily met in the case of Moldova. 

From a strategic point of view, the Russian annexation of Crimea hinges heavily on close geographical proximity with Russia and on the availability of air and sea routes to supply the occupation forces, as the Russian military has never been strong on force projection beyond its borders. In contrast, Moldova is practically landlocked between Ukraine and Romania, making it very difficult to grab it by surprise without firing a shot. Russian forces currently stationed in Transdnistria could easily be trapped without the possibility of being resupplied by air or sea. A naval blockade along the Romanian coast would force Russian forces to fire the first shot of the war, further weakening the diplomatic standing of Russia. 

In addition, one can expect that the general staff of every country from Finland to Turkey is now drafting plans to respond to a Crimean-style aggression on their own territory, making it even more difficult for the Russian general staff to pull the same maneuver elsewhere.

Well, I doubt any pro-Russian in Crimea would say they were bullied into the Federation.

Northern Ireland was, in my opinion, the Crimea of the 1920's. While the Irish Revolution was in full swing(The British had promised up Home Rule if we fought for them in WWI then didn't follow through), they passed the **Government of Ireland Act 1920** which gave the North-East of Ireland - the six counties now known as Northern Ireland - self-government within the United Kingdom. And when the Revolution was done, the revolutionaries didn't have the majority in the North anymore because of the partition.

If you were to take Ireland as a whole, the North and the Republic, you would fine a population of about 15% in *favour* of Union with the British. However, if you cut that up into North and South, you'll find the North has a majority pro-British, and it is *that* region the British focused on getting, not the South.

What I'm saying is that Russia will not care about what the whole of Estonia thinks. They will take whatever region has the pro-Russian majority in it and disregard the rest of the country.

It's somewhat similar with robberies. In Europe you'd probably use a knife for that, which usually would be regulated as well (length of blade, no switchblades).

But ok, lets say ""unknown"" troops are coming in. Border is gone... it is not like Crimea.  NATO (read as Estonian Army is also NATO) is sending troops to Narva to speak with them and figure out who are they. If they do not leave then Nato has freedom to use any force to get them out. Only one who could ever make ""unknown"" army in Estonian soil would be russians. If this is confirmed lets say hour. Estonia is mobilizing reserve army as it is sign of war. By this moment one of the NATO country is getting invaded as this is invasion against entire NATO. All NATO countries go at war same time. World War 3 is active. Same time NATO is sending more troops to Estonia, Estonian Army and Estonian Reserve Army is under Narva, both sides are shooting, Narva is no more, missiles and bullets flying everywhere... on this point we do not speak more.

Why not both? I own a rifle. I live in Ireland. We have almost no gun crime(About 5 or 6 murders a year with a firearm, if even. Though it is on the rise, I believe). I value my firearm highly. I think it is essential to my autonomy as a human being with a right to self-defense. 

In the case of a home invasion I'd rather hunker down in my room with a rifle than with a baseball bat when I face a man with a pistol(Or any weapon for that matter), or cower up in my room and wait for unarmed Gardaí to come to my house 10-20 minutes later only to find out I'd been gutted and the guy left my house ages ago. Justice doesn't do me any favours when I'm cold in the ground.

I think Europe is superior to America in pretty much every way. Every way, except the ***Right*** to Bear and Keep Arms. I didn't always think that. I thought firearms were barbaric and only ignorant, dumb Americans could want to own them. Then I read about them, learned the statistics, accepted a few common sense realities, and realised what a firearm really is, and now I couldn't imagine myself without one.

Yeah, I don't think I'll ever be in danger of a home invader. But in the case of a home invasion, I'll be just fine, and the added utility of using it competitions I think makes for a great hobby, and in the very worst case scenarios I can use it for hunting.

&gt;


&gt;* __Genuine shame__: is associated with genuine dishonor, disgrace, or condemnation.

&gt;


&gt;* __False shame__: is associated with false condemnation as in the double-bind form of false shaming; ""he brought what we did to him upon himself"". Author and TV personality [John Bradshaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bradshaw_(author\)) calls shame the ""emotion that lets us know we are finite"". 

&gt;


&gt;* __Secret shame__: describes the idea of being ashamed to be ashamed, so causing ashamed people to keep their shame a secret. 

&gt;


&gt;* __Toxic shame__: describes false, pathological shame, and Bradshaw states that toxic shame is induced, inside children, by all forms of child abuse. [Incest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest) and other forms of [child sexual abuse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse) can cause particularly severe toxic shame. Toxic shame often induces what is known as *complex* [trauma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma) in children who cannot cope with toxic shaming as it occurs and who [dissociate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_(psychology\)) the shame until it is possible to cope with. 

&gt;


&gt;* __Vicarious shame__: refers to the experience of shame on behalf of another person. Individuals vary in their tendency to experience vicarious shame, which is related to [neuroticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis) and to the tendency to experience personal shame. Extremely shame-prone people might even experience vicarious shame even to an increased degree, in other words: shame on behalf of another person who is already feeling shame on behalf of a third party (or possibly on behalf of the individual proper).

The process would go smoother for you if you'd just get married in the states--then you're entitled to a visa. You can always have a separate ceremony (assuming you're even having one) in France. Romanticism is wonderful, but practicality should trump it if you're interested in minimizing stress. As soon as you arrive in France, register by mail with OFII (Office of Immigration &amp; Integration). You'll be summoned for an interview &amp; physical. 

Tips:

The French are infamous for their terrible bureaucracy, &amp; rightly so. If you're asked to bring A, B, &amp; C, go ahead &amp; bring the rest of the alphabet too, because they nearly always ask for additional things that they didn't initially request.

Speak to the French Consulate in the states about transferring your driver's license BEFORE you move. They WILL go out of their way to fuck you by requesting difficult to obtain documents if you wait until after your move to find out what those are, &amp; obtaining a driver's license in France actually requires a bit of work, a bit of skill, &amp; a ton of money.

Learn French (assuming you don't already speak the language). Now. Don't wait until you move. Every thing that you can learn before you move will make your life that much easier, &amp; will make you feel less like an idiot when you begin taking your government-mandated language courses after you arrive. Hit the ground running, I say.

Bring a copy of your medical records. These can be more difficult to obtain than you might imagine, once you're living overseas.

Stock up on clothing if you want to save money for the first year. Clothing is expensive here. I personally buy most of my clothes while visiting family in the states.

See if your favorite products can be purchased in France, &amp; if not, bring some with you. There are stores where you can purchase limited American products, but they're very expensive, &amp; when I say limited, I mean it.",0,1395315025,null,0,1395315237,0,cg7ay9p,t3_20r0wm,t1_cg7ay9p,t3_20r0wm,null,1432988761,1,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,1

Even if territory of one NATO country would be fully occupied by Russia - NATO still wouldn't use nukes unless Russia does it first, or gets dangerously close to doing so.

We need to shift our oil/gas source quickly. I was always against shale gas/oil, as long as its consequences are not well researched.

[Il suffit de voir la vidéo](http://tv.regionpaca.fr/index.php/page/conseil) : session du 21 février, à 565 minutes :

""**Nous partageons l'opinion du Front de Gauche concernant le nécessaire arrêt des négociations sur le partenariat transatlantique. Nous sommes totalement résolument opposés à ce pacte.** En revanche nous ne sommes pas d'accord avec certaines des dispositions de ce voeu, notamment sur les gaz de schistes. 

D'autre part quand on voit que le Président de la République est le valet bienveillant de M. Obama, nous n'avons strictement aucune confiance, c'est pourquoi nous voterons contre.""

Un autre exemple :

&gt;Mais dans l’hémicycle de la région PAca, c’est la contradiction totale. Lors de la plénière du 28 octobre 2013, les élus Front de Gauche ont proposé trois motions, pour soutenir des salariés de la région Paca menacés de licenciement. Il s’agit des 200 employés du journal Nice-Matin, des Fralib, qui luttent depuis trois ans pour la reprise de leur usine de thés et tisanes Éléphant en coopérative, et des Moulins Maurel. Les élus FN ont voté contre les deux premières motions, et se sont abstenus sur le cas des Moulins Maurel.

Sauf qu'il n'y a pas eu de plénière le 28 octobre mais [le 25 octobre](http://tv.regionpaca.fr/index.php/page/conseil/2) (voir à 504 minutes). Et que le FN n'a absolument pas voté contre ces 3 propositions, il suffit de voir la vidéo.

1. They tried to push the maritime boundary between the Romania and Ukraine. This ended up in arbitrage at ICJ. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_delimitation_between_Romania_and_Ukraine

2. They tried to dredge one of Danube's channels, which is the de facto border between Romania and Ukraine, in order to shift the flow of the river and consequently the border.

3. There is a considerable Romanian minority in Ukraine which is barely acknowledged. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanians_of_Chernivtsi_Oblast

4. Ukrainians never showed a strong support for Moldova. Trandsnistria exists today because Ukrainians allowed it.

true,minustwofish,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Into a ""they just want our monieeees!"" thing.

I find this polarization happen  along two directions. First, the economic crisis and the bail outs. Since the EU government is so weak, it doesn't have any channels for transfer of wealth for such eventualities. The ones that do exists are all improvised, and, not surprisingly, feel very unfair to everyone. Absolutely everyone is complaining that their country is getting screwed in these arrangements. Which is probably true: this is not a zero-sum game, a few powerful people in every country gambled on borrowed money, and fucked up, and nobody wants to own up to their responsibilities, such that the average person in every country is paying for this in one way or another. I don't think some countries are lazy while others are greedy, that is just a very stupid way to understand this complex issue. All the average individuals got fucked by powerful people (be it short-sighted politicians or banks), and all the countries are recovering from a sore-butt, while complaining the other countries butt is not as sore as it should be.  I don't find this bickering very surprising at all,  but at the same time, I don't know any good way to resolve these issues in a fair manner. However, this does lead to us-vs-them, especially at the level of countries, but not so much at the level of individuals. 

The second direction is immigration in general, both from outside the EU and within the EU. This resentment is because although many EU countries do need immigration to not have their demographics collapse, immigration was not really accounted for in a meaningful way within the well-fare systems. Those well-fare systems kind of originally assumed, essentially, no population movement. I think the xenophobia comes out here. Instead of admitting that the well-fare needs to be reformed to reflect the population movement in a globalized world, and that is the whole point of the EU, everyone just blames the people that are moving by calling them greedy or lazy (which is never the case), or simply ""not one of us"". This one I hate the most because it is more at the individual level. This saddens me a lot, I am an immigrant after all, and  I'm contributing a lot to EU with the education I brought and my hard work here. I certainly pay a lot of taxes for that privilege!

Bruno wasn't the guy who predicted that as he was merely repeating what others had said long before him. Plurality of worlds (i.e. exoplanets) goes way back in history and was in fact accepted into Catholic Church doctrine already in 1277 with the Condemnations of Paris.

Already the bishop of Paris Étienne Tempier had posited that Aristotle was wrong, and there could be more planets with life. This plurality of worlds also became the accepted doctrine, and anti-pluralism was condemned.

Perhaps the best-known Catholic writer to speculate with alien life is German born Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa in his book *De docta ignorantia*, 1440: [The Man Who Invented Extraterrestrials: Nicholas of Cusa](http://www.challzine.net/29/29extraterr.html)

After that there is also a higher rate of poverty level in Chicago with it having a rate of 23.7% compared to 19% in Houston. So these cities may also have other factors that lead to a higher number of deaths in Chicago.

But there is also another important thing to note. With Chicago it is only the city itself with strict gun control with areas in the surrounding state and in next door states being very lenient on gun control.

It simply is a sad fact that gun controls can be easily undermined in the US as there is no unified gun policy with ease of travel across state lines.

[US was already involved in a war on Libya for decades before French president and UK PM went anywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Front_for_the_Salvation_of_Libya). There were CIA operatives on the ground in Libya long before any no-fly zones were established.

US was not *reluctant* to go to Libya, US was *relieved* that they got the support from NATO on this because the general public was growing tired with spending billions on sending US soldiers to various shitholes. If you followed any actual military analysts with half a brain at the time of the conflict like the FP mag, the now-defunct Abu Muqawama or even the [GrEaT sAtAn""S gIrLfRiEnD](http://greatsatansgirlfriend.blogspot.nl/2011/06/libyan-box.html) instead of just taking White House bullshit rhetoric for a fact it would be bright and clear as a day to you as well. I am quite perplexed at how clueless the American *public* is in their knowledge of this conflict.

Il ministero degli interni decide che la misura e colma e si sospenderà il campionato per un anno solare, nonostante le lobby, nonostante tutto. 

Giorno uno: i calciatori grossi dicono che rimarranno fedeli alle squadre, ma già sanno che gli sponsor li molleranno quindi iniziano trattative on the side.

Giorno due: le serie minori dicono che comunque ""per allenamento"" loro giocheranno lo stesso le partite e nessuno può impedirgli di giocare una partita a calcio

Giorno cinque: la Serie A si allinea alle serie minori dicendo che trasmetteranno gli allenamenti in tv dato che non si può giocare

Giorno sette: il ministero emana un decreto esplicativo: se volete giocare giocate, ma non potete vendere biglietti e non potete trasmettere niente in televisione, sia pubblica che privata. Lo spirito della legge in questo caso è chiaramente punitivo; il calcio non sarà più, per almeno un anno, uno sport con pubblico superiore alle poche centinaia di persone.

Giorno dodici: la giustizia sportiva si scontra con quella amministrativa, ma a vuoto; le leggi sono state promulgate, e il coltello è dalla parte del mano delle forze dell'ordine. Diverse manifestazioni scoppiano in tutta italia per protestare la cosa, ma il movimento ha vita breve

Giorno ventitrè: i giornali sportivi danno notizia che i grossi giocatori stanno sciogliendo i contratti per passare a squadre estere. il sentimento comune tra i tifosi è che questi siano dei profittatori pezzi di merda. Alcuni giocatori italiani che vedono il trattamento riservato ai loro colleghi scelgono di perdere gli sponsor piuttosto che inimicarsi i tifosi

Giorno trentasei: la situazione ormai è normalizzata; le squadre di serie A continuano ad allenarsi senza partite, le squadre delle serie minori fanno lo stesso ma riescono ad aprire i campi per qualche partita. I controlli ci sono, ma per GS Assago contro Corsico United sono un po' più laschi. Viene solo fatto rispettare il divieto di ripresa e trasmissione. 

Giorno quaranta: i giornali e telegiornali sportivi iniziano a dare maggior spazio agli sport minori; Improvvisamente gli italiani scoprono di avere squadre di rugby, baseball e football americano.Timidamente, la gente si avvicina a questi sport, oltre che ad altri sport non di squadra.

Giorno Settantasei: fa scalpore la notizia di tafferugli durante una partita tra due squadre di serie minore rivali da anni, la Vitercellese e la Valdisottana. Nessun morto, solo feriti e nemmeno gravi, ma il ministero gira ulteriormente la vite istituendo multe severe per le squadre e per i tifosi. Alle voci di protesta, viene ricordato che il provvedimento è punitivo nella sua natura, non educativo, dato che centinaia di morti peril calcio nel 2015 non sono accettabili da un paese come l'italia.

Giorno Novanta: i giornali sportivi aprono con notizie non relative al calcio, che ormai viene spremuto fino alla fine in approfondimenti sugli allenamenti delle squadre di A e sulle amichevoli delle squadre di B. Rifioriscono gli sport minori, anche se la tendenza sta diventando seguire le partite delle leghe estere

Giorno Cento: i giornali sportivi e le chiacchere da bar sono spaccati tra sport minori e lege straniere. Il calcio è sempre il calcio, ma non poter tifgare per lapropria squadra è uno smacco non indifferente

Giorno Duecento: in tv si parla principalmente di sport minori, che ora minori non sono più. I programmi di approfondimento, precedentemente sospesi, tornano brevemente dedicati ad altri sport, ma nella loro quasi totalità vengono ostracizzati dai praticanti o dai tifosi di vecchia data, che non vogliono vedere il rugby (per dire) diventare la nuova scimmietta della televisione. La quasi totalità degli atleti non cede alle lusinghe dello schermo e gli opinionisti della domenica vengono ripresi quando dicono idiozie o dimostrano di non conoscere la materia. Ci sono quelli che saltano sul carosello mediatico, ovviamente, ma in genere la tv ha poco sangue da cavare da atleti, manager e professionisti di sport abituati ad essere di secondo o terzo interesse.

Giorno Trecente: iniziano i preparativi per lsa rimessa in onda del calcio. i giornali tornano a dare meno spazio agli sport minori a favoredi interviste e approfondimenti sugli allenamenti della big

Giorno Trecentotre: il ministero distribuisce dati relativi al periodo passato che evidenziano come tra gli sport minori non si verifichino episodi di tifo violento (nonostante raccoglimenti anche grossi di spettatori - san siro a milano ha ospitato partite di rugby e football senza problemi degni di nota), salva qualche contusione sporadica. Si ventila l'ipotesi di un rinnovo del ban sul calcio

Giorno Trecentoquattro: alla notizia della possibile estensione del ban, gli ultras e i tifosi che sono stati sedati con altri sport si infiammano. Secondo la questura, le manifestazioni che seguono sono piuttosto violente ma non partecipate come si aspettavano.

Giorno Trecentodieci: dopo una settimana di proteste più o meno violente, il ministero comunica che vista la reazione dei tifosi è chiaro che il messaggio non è ancora passato. E' al vaglio una estensione del ban, forse di altri sei mesi, e la situazione con manifestazioni del genere può solo peggiorare

Giorno Trecentoventi: a seguito di lunghe trattative, la notizia ufficile è che al giorno 366 ricominceranno le partite ufficiali in tutte le serie, ma ai tifosi (tutti i tifosi) saranno interdetti gli stadi per ulteriori sei mesi come misura cautelativa. Alle squadre che lamentano mancati introiti lo stato risponde essenzialmente ""cazzi vostri"" 

Giorno Trecentoquaranta: a titolo di indirizzo e consiglio il ministero emana una circolare in cui informa gli organi di stampacheil nuovo interesse in sport minori da lustro al paese e spinge le nuove generazioni a intraprendere carriere atletiche diverse da quella del calciatore; la richiesta allegata  che, una volta ripartiti i campionati, si trovi ancora spazio per parlare di altri sport.

Giorno Trecentosessantasei: nelle piazze delle città, gli italiani seguono da megaschermi l'inizio del nuovo campionato. Molti Derby in questa prima giornata, per festeggiare il riotteuto pallone. Tensioni nelle piazze più calde, ma nessuna sfocia in violenze (ad eccezione forse di quella verbale). Il campionato riparte con squadre in cui i nomi noti sono pochi, ma tutti inneggiano un calcio pulito e fresco.

Giorno 60 post nuovo campionato: il calcio la fa ancora da padrone su tutti i media, ma agli sport minori viene lasciato ampio spazio.

Il ministero ricorda, ad ogni opportunità necessaria. che come il campionato s'è chiuso una volta si può chiudere di nuovo.

[Latvia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_Legion)

&gt; Draftees were given a choice between serving in the Waffen-SS Legions, serving as (German Wehrmacht) auxiliaries, or being sent to a slave labour camp in Germany. Those who tried to avoid one of those options were arrested and sent to concentration camps.[10] As a result, only 15-20% of the soldiers serving in the legion were actual volunteers.[6] Unlike in Lithuania, potential legionary recruits in Latvia did not organize an official boycott of conscription; some Latvians deserted however rather than serving the Nazi war effort.[1]

[Estonia](http://goo.gl/0IGIyS)

With those who volunteered it is simpler to judge, I just wanted to point out that wast majority of soldiers of Baltic origin in both nazi and red armies were sent against their will to die for enemy country. In my eyes it is more important and worthy of remembrance and relevant: by number of soldiers, percent of casualties, and sheer drama of their lives, if survived can not even pay homage to their fallen without being called collaborators.

On other hand, volunteers were here:

Di che sigle stai parlando?

&gt;Se fosse un partitello marginale non avrebbe tre (o due, non ricordo) ministri

tre ministri (Difesa, Ecologia, non rircordo il terzo) e il viceministro. Guarda, davvero, mi sembra calzante il paragone con il CNL: dopo un colpo di stato, i partiti che lo hanno fatto si spartiscono temporaneamente le poltrone. Sarebbe stato ingiusto non concedergliele, ma perchè non ti concentri sui partiti NON nazisti che ora governano l'Ucraina? è come se un osservatore russo dicesse che in Italia siamo tutti coglioni perchè ci stanno i grillini in Parlamento. 

Esistono, ma non sono questa grande minaccia ad alcuna libertà in UE, che ha un'altissima soglia di attenzione verso i movimenti estremi: guarda cosa è successo con Haider e in Ungheria, dove, zittizitti, hanno depotenziato la minaccia neonazi dell'anno scorso. 

Davvero, cosa ti spaventa? 

&gt;Il consenso popolare mi sembra sempre che ognuno se lo tiri dalla propria parte. Senza discutere del referendum in sé, i crimeani sono per gran parte filorussi ma in questi discorsi vengono trattati come marionettine, mentre i rivoltosi ucraini sono dei sinceri democratici.

Mi pare di capire che per te è l'opposto: il referendum crimeano è stato una prova di democrazia russa (lol, scusa la sineddoche) e le elezioni del 2012 (10% a Svoboda) e le manifestazioni sono state pilotate dall'UE (che all'improvviso scopre di avere una politica estera*).

&gt;Potrò pur dire che la prospettiva di avere neonazisti nell'unione europea mi spaventa? Visto che ti fanno paura i neonazisti in UE, non ti fa paura un (altro) dittatore alle porte dell'UE?

Ce li hai già. E cosa ti spaventa?

&gt;O sono per forza un putiniano se dico così?

Devi dirlo tu: secondo te Putin ha fatto bene a rubare la Crimea a uno stato non ancora riorganizzatosi?

Romania isn't really in need of more clay, they already can't properly handle what they have.

Mi spiego meglio, il governo è caduto, al governo adesso è andata l'opposizione, opposizione che ha partecipato alle proteste.
Svoboda ha avuto il 10% alle precedenti elezioni, perchè non avrebbe dovuto avere dei ruoli all'interno del governo? Chi avrebbe dovuto decidere che sarebbero andati al governo tutti quelli dell'opposizione tranne un solo partito?

Inoltre, cosa molto importante e che tutti sembrano dimenticare, sopratutto i vari giornalisti, è che il governo è provvisorio, le elezioni sono programmate per fine Maggio, o almeno lo erano prima che Putin invadesse la Crimea.

La storiella del governo nazista è una barzelletta.

true,TheApatheist,BELG,Belgium,"Given that you're studying French, I'm assuming that your target list of countries in Europe is limited to mostly France, Belgium, Switzerland or Luxembourg.

I'd see in most of these countries, conspiracy theories still exist, especially among older generations who still remember when the countries were pretty much monoethnic. The standard conspiracy theories such as ""Jews own X% of the world's wealth"", ""Muslims are trying to take over Europe, their high immigration and child birth are part of that strategy"" and now we have the bank and government of and for babyboomers  among the younger population not much unlike there is in the US. On top of that, we have localized paranoia as well amoung certain peoples: in my country for instance, the increase of French speakers around Brussels is seen as some as a strategy to Frenchify the whole of Brussels and surroundings as French historically pushed into Dutch territory. 

Is it a constant fear? No. Is it as widespread as in the US? Probably not. Usually it's just a way to vent frustrations with life really. Nobody likes more foreign language speakers in their street, whether it's Arabic or French.

From your list though, many of the things you mention don't matter at all:

* Healthcare? Taken care of for now, fear that it might become too expensive in the future to keep at its current level.
* GMO? Already banned in the EU for commercial use anyway, so no fears. Some leftist protesters destroy university test fields every now and again
* Guns? What guns?
* Petrol? What's wrong with it? Expensive as fuck though, but it's always been and with global prices rising it becomes tough on some, but that's it.
* Water? What's wrong with it? Enough water in N-W Europe and it's getting cleaner too.

I think one of the biggest advantages we have is that our news channels aren't as corporate as yours and we have popular public channel options as well. A second advantage is that we've been through tougher times and we've been more political violence on our continent: this may sounds weird, but a terrorist attack on London or Madrid wasn't their first time seeing terrorism and despite following the US's lead somewhat, it didn't have the same impact on the national psyche. Being attacked or having violence happen in the area is something much bigger in the US historically speaking than it is in Europe.

tl,dr; We have our own paranoias that differ from those in the US, but for the most part are more moderate except when talking about migration as others already mentioned.",0,1395326885,null,0,false,0,cg7eik7,t3_20vth4,t1_cg7eik7,t3_20vth4,null,1432990441,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

true,axehomeless,GERM,Fuck bavaria,"If you have nuclear power (or coal or gas or whatever), what you do is you burn them or split them or something like that for one purpose. To get their energy. That's to say, to generate heat.

Well, that heat obviously can't go into copper wires and power your computer, so what are we doing? We use it for steam engines. We heat up water, use the pressure to fire up generators that set wheels in motion that spin magnets, which produce electricity. (In the case of biogas, we burn it in normal ottomotors that power the spinning magnets).

During this process, energy is lost, I'm not sure what the recent numbers are, but ten years ago, the ratio loss to usable energy was around 32% vs 68%. Meaning that 68% of all power generated my burning coal (or splitting atoms, it's roughly the same with all heat based electricy generating) went into the air unused. These big towers where the clouds come out? That's condensing water that's cooling off with our neat energy. 

So even if you can use 100% of electricity to heat your house, you still lose that 65% that went into the air unused. But if you burn the gas in your house and the ratio could be 80/20% (not sure what it is, but this is my guess), you do not lose the majority of energy in the material, because the heat is what you actually want as a last result, unlike when you split atoms in a nuclear power plant.

Nuclear power can't be used in that way. You can't have a fission generator in your basement that distributes heat in your house, but you can with coal, gas, oil and wood. So even if all the other problems with nuclear power wouldn't be there and it just would cost a few bucks to get uranium-ore, it's still economically problematic to use it for making houses warm.",0,1395327003,null,0,1395327242,0,cg7ekd3,t3_20vz3c,t1_cg7ekd3,t1_cg7ebli,null,1432990464,15,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,15

I always have trouble with arguments about pain. The natural death of any wild animal is painful: predators and disease don't bother with painkillers. The same goes for cruelty. I'm not sure how we can reject that human cruelty while happily filming a lion eating a still breathing impala in Africa.

I feel the underlying argument is less about the animal, and more about our motivations and attitudes as people.

Nel senso che vuoi sapere i nomi dei movimenti? Ne sono parecchi, i più preoccupanti sono Una-Unso, il tridente, patrioti Ucraini.

C'è parecchia letteratura a riguardo, [qui](http://www.lastampa.it/2014/02/22/esteri/ucraina-nazisti-o-nazionalisti-viaggio-nellarcipelago-del-radicalismo-cm67RAT97CaD8vNbOg2GZO/pagina.html) un articolo a caso 

&gt; ma perchè non ti concentri sui partiti NON nazisti che ora governano l'Ucraina?

Perché i partiti non nazisti sono usciti con le ossa rotte dall'ultima esperienza di governo post rivoluzione arancione, e adesso mi sembra che il sentiment diffuso sia quello di rivolgersi alle esperienze più radicali che ci sono in Ucraina, che non a caso hanno messo il cappello sulle rivolte, e lo hanno potuto fare.

Sinceramente mi spaventa (forse dovrei usare preoccupa, boh) il fatto che in un'Europa che già ora tende a destra si dia copertura politica a ciò che sta succedendo nelle piazze Ucraine, fino a prenderseli nell'UE. Siamo nel campo delle ipotesi, ma che ti devo dire, io preferisco non averceli.

Non perché ho paura che mi vengano a prendere a casa con un bastone perché sono di sinistra, ma perché non sono purtroppo più i tempi di Haider.

&gt; Mi pare di capire che per te è l'opposto: il referendum crimeano è stato una prova di democrazia russa (lol, scusa la sineddoche) e le elezioni del 2012 (10% a Svoboda) e le manifestazioni sono state pilotate dall'UE (che all'improvviso scopre di avere una politica estera*).

No, capisci male. Voglio capire chi e come stabilisce che una roba è democratica e civile e una no. Visto che poi in passato abbiamo assistito in altre paesi a consultazioni simili, con simili plebisciti. Solo che lì c'era l'esercito americano invece di quello russo, e allora evviva la democrazia.

Bada che non sto dicendo che forse non c'è stata una pressione sul risultato di un referendum che comunque avrebbero vinto i filorussi senza alcun problema, ma neanche che i crimei sono dei pazzi pilotati e le proteste invece sono democratiche.

Vorrei attestarmi su una posizione terza, se me lo concedi. Cioè che ci sono zone d'ombra in entrambi i casi, e che non me la sento di sedere dalla parte dei vincenti e sbertucciare la russia solo perché noi siamo di qua dal muro.

&gt; Devi dirlo tu: secondo te Putin ha fatto bene a rubare la Crimea a uno stato non ancora riorganizzatosi?

Devo darti un giudizio morale? Io sono un pacifista, vorrei che tutti si abbracciassero e facessero all'amore, invece di muovere milizie e alimentare la tensione.

One of my grandparents actually grew up near Yakutsk in a Gulag camp, and didn't leave Siberia until he was 22 years old (he was 5 when the Soviets annexed what is now Lithuania and deported his family). Two others were deported and chased out of their homes in what used to be Eastern Poland by their Soviet supported Ukrainian neighbors who murdered more than 300,000 Poles in the massacres of Galicia and Volhynia. All of them suffered for another 40 years under Soviet oppression. My father was nearly beaten to death by Communist forces when he marched in the Solidarity movement.

true,tusksrus,null,null,"&gt;The natural death of any wild animal is painful: predators and disease don't bother with painkillers.

Well, no, but that's an established part of nature that we either can't or it doesn't make sense to stop, even if there was a large call to do so. To stop predators killing prey, assuming we had the power to do that, or making them do it in such a way that the prey doesn't suffer, would be a massive intervention in nature which doesn't compare to the (relatively) much more practical idea of not fighting bulls any more. 

It's also not the only means available of obtaining food. Even meat. Even bull's meat. The cruelty is artificially added for entertainment purposes, which could be present in the animal kingdom as well but I don't think on the same scale and animals also don't have (or at the very least, less of) a sense of empathy and I think that humans ""should know better"". This leads on to the social mores point.

&gt;I feel the underlying argument is less about the animal, and more about our motivations and attitudes as people.

I am also uncomfortable about what it says about a society whose traditional form of entertainment is something like that. But yes you're probably right.

&gt;It might be incompatible with your social mores. Not necessarily other people's. Plus I'm sure appealing to social values is also a fallacy.

Fair enough, I guess I overlooked that. I feel like I could have made a stronger point but not right now, so I'll concede.

true,silverionmox,LIM2,Limburg,"&gt;To those influencing environmental policy but opposed to nuclear power: As climate and energy scientists concerned with global climate change, we are writing to urge you to advocate the development and deployment of safer nuclear energy systems. We appreciate your organization’s concern about global warming, and your advocacy of renewable energy. But continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity’s ability to avoid dangerous climate change.

We call on your organization to support the development and deployment of safer nuclear power systems as a practical means of addressing the climate change problem. Global demand for energy is growing rapidly and must continue to grow to provide the needs of developing economies. At the same time, the need to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions is becoming ever clearer. We can only increase energy supply while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions if new power plants turn away from using the atmosphere as a waste dump.

Nothing relevant was said.

&gt;Renewables like wind and solar and biomass will certainly play roles in a future energy economy, but those energy sources cannot scale up fast enough to deliver cheap and reliable power at the scale the global economy requires.

Again, [citation needed] that renewables can't do that and, importantly, that nuclear can. Calculation I have seen talks about a new nuclear plant every week for the next generation to make that possible... and the latest nuclear plant in Finland is planned to take *18 years* - so far. It's not finished yet, so it might well be 20.

&gt;We understand that today’s nuclear plants are far from perfect. Fortunately, passive safety systems and other advances can make new plants much safer. And modern nuclear technology can reduce proliferation risks and solve the waste disposal problem by burning current waste and using fuel more efficiently. Innovation and economies of scale can make new power plants even cheaper than existing plants.

They rely completely on innovation and new technology to counter these disadvantages. If that is a valid argument, why isn't it a valid argument to counter the disadvantages of renewables... who have had much less research money for a much shorter time (so there's more low-hanging fruit), and require less grand infrastructure (so more institutions can partake)?

&gt;Regardless of these advantages, nuclear needs to be encouraged based on its societal benefits.

Which societal benefits? Renewables can be deployed anywhere, with distributed production and ownership, and are within reach of individual households and small companies. Nuclear plants imply extensive centralized control and transfers of costs over a very long time and a very large area.

&gt;Quantitative analyses show that the risks associated with the expanded use of nuclear energy are orders of magnitude smaller than the risks associated with fossil fuels.

Not relevant.

&gt;We ask only that energy system decisions be based on facts, and not on emotions and biases that do not apply to 21st century nuclear technology.

Then I suggest them to shake off the fatal infatuation with nuclear energy. She looks stunning, but she's too high-maintenance. Or come back when 21st century nuclear technology actually exists.

&gt;While there will be no single technological silver bullet, the time has come for those who take the threat of global warming seriously to embrace the development and deployment of safer nuclear power systems as one among several technologies

You do realize that that contradicts ""It now seems however that nuclear energy has a better chance of saving us from climate change than other means"", or don't you? I'm open to plug the last remaining hole with up-to-date nuclear technology in a pinch, but at this point that technology simply isn't available.

Likewise I don't approve of Germany building Nordstream, but there it is. 

Having said that, I don't think sources of Uranium are much of a source of leverage, because it can be stockpiled easily, and shipped in from many different sources at relatively short notice. It's similar to LNG, even if you buy a large percentage from one country, if they block exports overnight, there are still quite a few other sources you can go to, without any disruption beyond paying a higher price. A pipeline without alternative infrastructure (for instance, LNG terminals) seems to be a much better lever, because stockpiling is more difficult and expensive, the supply can be switched off immediately, and the construction of the infrastructure for bringing in alternative resources would take years. In fact, even if Britain buys Uranium solely from Russia, it probably stands to reduce European exposure to Russian influence, because that opens up Norwegian gas to be sold elsewhere in Europe. Of course, not that British policy is motivated by those concerns.

That is false, Latvian passports doesn't even mention ethnicity if you don't specifically request to include it. 
The pensions are very low for everyone, regardless of ethnicity. My grandmother is Latvian, she worked all her life and it still would be impossible for her to live on the pension alone. It's not related to ethnicity, but to the fact the pension system is flawed and for the poor countries like the Baltics, the pensions are huge burden on our social budget.

&gt; Oh and fun fact about anti-semitism, the Nazis hadn't even reached Riga before the Latvians there started killing all of their Jewish neighbors. 

That's only partly true. The execution squads were created by the Nazi Security Service, and only some Latvians joined them, mostly motivated by revenge for the ""Year of Terror"" (1940), as many Jews were considered soviet collaborators. ""Started killing their neighbors"" is misguiding thing to say.

In Syria, for example, whole cities and neighborhoods were razed to the ground upon retreat. Taliban in Afghanistan have destroyed cultural heritages and infrastructure on their way out.

[I guess calling Mila Kunis 'zhidovka'](http://observer.com/2013/02/ukrainian-anti-semitism-and-mila-kunis-complicated-by-facebook-dictionaries/) -- that's 'female kike' for those who don't speak Russian here, is absolutely not attacking at all -- funny thing too, the ponytailed bastard who roughed up this Pershi Natsionalniy head was the same one who said that about Kunis. It's absurd to claim that Svoboda is not Neo-Nazi, far-right, hateful party. You're destroying the Ukrainian credibility on this sub by defending those whom you should instead attack, simply on a reflexive, knee-jerk nationalist whim. 

Now, the trick is that Russia claims Svoboda pretty much took over Ukrainian gov't. That's propaganda. Ukrainian gov't is mostly more or less moderate. But Svoboda still has too many top posts for a party of its history. That needs to be rectified. And right now, the Eastern raioni of Ukraine don't have real representation in the new interim gov't. So Putin is technically right about the gov't being illegal, it is in effect illegal if it does not represent the interests of the entire country. A coup has to be followed by immediate and democratic elections in order for the new gov't to be legitimate.

&gt;ONE-in-six civil marriages in Ireland are believed to be fake, according to a new documentary.The TV3 documentary reveals how Ireland has become the sham marriage capital of Europe because it isn’t against the law here to marry in order to secure a visa. Registrars in Ireland have to legally pronounce brides and grooms as man and wife even though they plainly don’t speak the same language. The documentary uncovers how Eastern European brides are bought and sold by brokers and often forced to marry complete strangers on Irish soil to secure residency visas for grooms, mainly from Pakistan and India. The Asian grooms desperate to stay in Ireland pay fees of up to €4,000 to brokers to marry brides, sent mainly from Latvia, in rural Irish registry offices as tying the knot with an EU citizen allows them to stay in Europe for five more years. Latvian police tell how they have been investigating claims of false imprisonment, rape and human trafficking in Ireland for the past two years.

Putin actually told them several times before to move money and property out of foreign accounts, there were laws prohibiting this etc -&gt; their own fault. 


It is actually beneficial for the people of Russia to see stolen money being frozen or arrested, this means that they have to keep in at least in Russia (maybe if we are lucky, even invest them into our economy). You freeze money or restrain capital - you loose credibility and reputation of a safe haven, Cyprus was 1 st bell, this is more of a gong. 


If there would be an escalation of sanctions, it is highly likely that Russia will begin abandoning everything that has to do with Western financial system or Western products, thus stimulating our our production and economy. Russia **can** afford autarky with several notable exceptions which can be compensated on Asian market. This will hurt European economy badly, thus undermining you competitiveness against China/U.S and collapsing smaller economies like Latvia, Eesti etc.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"The gas stats are from 2007. After that Russia's share of natural gas in the EU has been declining while other suppliers such as Norway and Quatar have been rising. So, has anyone got more up-to-date stats?

In Finland natural gas is about 10% of primary energy usage, and 100% of that gas is from Russia. Domestic household gas is rare, used for cooking, and buildings and houses are heated with distributed heating, electricity, oil or others - not directly with natural gas. No one would freeze to death if Russian gas pipes were suddenly closed (and things like electricity exists!) but it would have consequenses.

Natural gas is used in some powerplants providing electricity and distributed heat. Those powerplants would have to switch to other sources of energy (air-propane mix, biogas, oil, coal etc) or get compensated by other powerplants. In Finland there are [existing plans](http://www.huoltovarmuus.fi/static/pdf/607.pdf) for such case to arise, and legislation requires energy supply storages worth of at least five months consumption to buy time. The [National Emergency Supply Agency](http://www.nesa.fi/) is the body responsible for the relevant plans and their execution.

In case of sudden closure of Russian gas pipes no-one would freeze, no-one would die, but there would be some costs in switching over to other energy sources. 

There are plans and proposals for a more heterogenous gas supply such as the new LNG terminal with Estonia and the proposed Mid-Nordic Gas Pipeline from Norway through Sweden to Finland. I would like to see them both realized as the LNG terminal gives a lot of options for supply, and I'd rather support our Nordic bro's social fund than our Eastern neighbour's military buildup.

Finland also buys a lot of oil from Russia, but the supply channels are already heterogenous and in case of disruptions Russia would get replaced by other sources - though there probably would be some costs in doing that.

&gt; enforcing the legislation passed by Council and Parliament

You see, here's where entire dilemma comes from. You say that the Commission doesn't make any decisions, which is not quite true, since they do. They are given the authority by Council and Parliament to enforce these legislations however they see fit. There are problems with it, if there weren't any problems then there would be no concept of *Brussels bureaucrats* in smoky rooms. Which aren't smoky anymore, thanks to Brussels bureaucrats. But they would be if it was up to Wilders, it's in his program to relax the smoking rules. And yes, I'm a smoker, so thats one more reason to vote for him.

And yes, Wilders is a big fat statist. But he also calls for cutting spending on NL involvement in NATO-led operations and focus on domestic security instead, another thing I can't disagree on.

&gt; Two other investor groups have also unveiled plans to build new nuclear plants in Britain. Japan's Hitachi is developing up to five reactors at two sites, and France's GDF Suez has taken Japanese partner Toshiba on board to build three new nuclear units at a location in northern England.

The Portland area is more politically left leaning than most of the state around it (same holds mostly true for Sea-Tac area). Same thing in Helsinki and the greens.

More things coming, will post this an edit...

Oregonians tend to be environmentally conscious, more so than most of the rest of the US. Oregon was the first to establish a pantti (container deposit legislation). Many other states in the US do not have this... The Portland metro area has fairly good recycling service. Finland/Helsinki is the same way.

Yes but in the context of his version of *salvation*. There was nothing heretical in exoplanets as they had already been accepted to Church doctrine since 1277. In fact as per the Condemnations of Paris it was unacceptable to teach that god could only have created one planet with life.

What was deemed heretical in Bruno's case was his theological teachings regarding *salvation* on exoplanets. It was related to the centuries old question of would the other planets have each their own Jesus or would one Jesus suffice and if not then would each Jesus be a separate entity or part of the same trinity etc. On those points Church deemed his teachings heretical - his version of salvation, not the idea of there being exoplanets.

There was nothing heretical about the exoplanets per se. Exoplanets were a very old idea, and accepted doctrine since 1277.

I was refferencing the list on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svoboda_%28political_party%29#In_government) (meanwhile changed) and did check some of the names but not thoroughly, so that was my bad. 

With that said, even with corrections the point still stands. I honestly don't see where you're getting with noting it is an interim position. Won't they be there until the next elections? Same as the others? One could even argue that this is an interim government, given there were quite a few changes and early elections were set. 

As for economic power, that's not all that matters. You cannot say defense is not important. In a tense moment like this it is of uttermost importance, and that position alone makes me very uneasy. 

The General Prosecutor is that who leads investigations on what happened during the protests, where the violence came from. Would you expect Oleh Makhnitskyi, a Svodoba member, to come forward and incriminate high Svodoba members if that was the case? 

A vice Prime Minister is a high position in any case, but one in charge of humanitarian politics considering the current state of affairs, is pretty important. A member of a party deemed racist and xenophobic by the EU just a couple of years ago is definitely a terrible fit.

The best propaganda is based on truth, albeit truth that is, as you said, blown far out of proportion. Still, I don't like the fact that there are so many Svoboda ministers because most of them aren't holding useless posts, but rather fairly important ones:

Oleksandr Sych - Vice Prime Minister

Andriy Mokhnyk- Minister of Ecology

Ihor Shvayka - Minister of Agriculture

Ihor Tenyukh - Minister of Defence

Oleh Makhnitsky - General Prosecutor

****
Out of these, the first is very important symbolically, but lacks power. Minister of Agriculture is very important in Ukraine too, but it's not a position from which you can project a lot of power. However, the last two - MoD and chief Prosecutor is very scary, these are the *absolute worst* places to put Neo-Nazis, aside from the Presidential and Prime Ministerial seat. 

I don't understand how a party that is so often downplayed by the West controls such important posts. Looks like they're not as powerless as we thought.

***

Now, my prediction is that the next general election will unseat them. The East of Ukraine will participate there, that will dilute the Svoboda power. However, the very fact that the West of Ukraine has such a strong Svoboda following is worrisome.

&gt; Svoboda argued that in the Ukrainian language the word does not have the anti-semitic connotations that it always does in the Russian language.[43] Upon being petitioned, the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice wrote that it considered the term to be archaic but not necessarily a slur citing a Ukrainian academic dictionary.[43][79] Svoboda has repeatedly stated that it will not stop using words which it considers as legitimate Ukrainian parlance.[43] ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svoboda_(political_party\)))

So, his defence is: the word 'zhid' was not derogatory in Ukrainian until after WW2 (at least in western Ukraine) - and is not derogatory now in Polish and many other languages.If you ask me, it's fucked up and wrong that he used this word. But if that's enough to call someone a neo-Nazi, that really reduces the meaning of the term to ""your average neighbourhood closet racist dumbass"".

&gt;It's absurd to claim that Svoboda is not Neo-Nazi, far-right, hateful party. You're destroying the Ukrainian credibility on this sub by defending those whom you should instead attack, simply on a reflexive, knee-jerk nationalist whim.

I am not disagreeing that it is a far-right party that if it were up to me would be outside the political mainstream, but they are not neo-Nazis. I'm just not allowing Russian propaganda to frame the debate here. To call me a nationalist simply for disputing your labels is really quite sleazy. You know nothing of my political views.

Anything close like /r/news or /r/politics is full of sensationalist bullshit that is hardly worth anyone's time. In addition, neither of those subs offer the full breadth of topics, self posts, and discussions I see here on this sub. Because of this (and a litany of other reasons), I feel Europeans are seriously misinformed about what actually occurs in the US, what our internal politics are like (reddit is disastrous for this, since it is so heavily biased by young, 20's something year old demographics), and what government programs are like and why they are that way.

Furthermore, trying to correct these misconceptions on this sub are typically met with great suspicion, as if us Americans are just acting like shills or some bullshit. For instance, if we are discussing a system in the US, I have noticed that only negative anecdotes about that system are tolerated, and positive ones are down voted and dismissed as propaganda. I can have good quality discussions here, but it is virtually impossible to have good discussions that relate to European-American issues. Since this sub is European-centric, it reflexively take a pro-Europe stance on all issues relating to Europe and X other party. This is simply a natural by-product of being a sub dedicated to Europe.

It is for those reasons that I would like to see a sub dedicated to issues that transcend the Atlantic, since it wouldn't be inherently rooted in either a pro-American stance or a pro-European stance.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Almost the exact opposite, an episode dedicated a significant chunk of airtime to the story of Bruno and painted him as a radical skeptic and free-thinker, demanding that others ""question everything"" and saw him burned solely for his cosmological proclamations and implied rationality. 

*facepalm*

For some reason there still seems to be a need to have some sort of Martyrs of Science even if it is an anti-thesis of science itself. Bruno was not a scientist, not even a proto-scientist, and certainly not an astronomer but more of a religious mystic. It just so happened that his version of religious fanaticism was too far from the Church's version. Hell, I bet if Sagan or Neil Degrasse Tyson were to have a scientific discussion with Bruno they'd burn him themselves - metaphorically speaking of course.

&gt; Can you cite for me that the 'other worlds' referenced by the bishop of Paris were in fact exoplanets and not other bodies within the solar system? Potentially we are missing a key distinction here. 

Regarding the plurality of worlds there was no such distinction. What was condemned in 1277 was teaching that god could have only created one world with life.

What you're now asking for is to have references to centuries of thinking and intellectual tradition. Okay, but brace yourself.

As apparently Nicholas of Cusa failed to impress you as a predecessor to Bruno have you ever read books by [Johannes Hennon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hennon) (15th cent)? And of course his ideas of an infinite number of god created beings on infinite worlds was not original as he merely borrowed from [Albert of Saxony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_of_Saxony_\(philosopher\)) (14th cent). Neither of which were burned on stake for proposing such ideas. Because, as said, such ideas were not heretical - in fact the absolute opposite was.

Some other references from relevant scholarly research:  
&gt; So we find in 1277 AD, only three years after Aquinas died, the very blunt condemnation by the bishop of Paris, Etienne Tempier, against a belief ""that the First Cause cannot make many worlds."".  
&gt; 
*Corbally, 'What If There Were Other Inhabited Worlds?', in Gregersen, Görman, &amp; Wassermann (eds.), The Interplay Between Scientific and Theological Worldviews, Part 1, Science &amp; Theology 1997, number 5, p. 80 (1999).*

&gt; The assertion that God has at least theoretically the power to create many worlds was common in Scholastic literature, especially after Bishop Etienne Tempier's condemnation in 1277 of the Aristotelian thesis ""that the first cause cannot make more than one world.""  
&gt;  
*Harvey, 'Nicolas Oreseme and Hasdai Crescas on Many Worlds', in Fontain et al (eds.), 'Studies in the History of Culture and Science: A Tribute to Gad Freudenthal', p. 354 (2011).*

&gt; In 1277 there occurred an ironic event that Pierre Durhem and others have claimed to be a major cause of science. The bishop of Paris, Etienne Tempier, pressed by theologians concerned that philosophers of Aristotelian inclination were championing doctrines that could be construed as limiting God's power, issued a condemnation of 219 such propositions. Included in the condemnation was proposition 34: ""that the First Cause cannot make many worlds."" Abruptly after 1277 the milieu changed, with many authors formulating analyses aimed at showing God could create multiple worlds. Although few urged that God did in fact do so, this process led to a valuable reexamination and critique of Aristotle's antipluralist arguments.  
&gt;  
*Crowe, 'The Extraterrestrial Life Debate, 1750-1900', p. 5 (1999).*

&gt; Bruno's thinking was influenced by the many-worlds cosmology developed by the Greek atomists of the fourth century BCE. It also built on the systems of earlier European theological thinkers who either favoured, or left open, the possibility of an infinity of worlds in opposition to the Aristotelian view. Many highly prominent theologians considered that the principle of the infinity of divine power resonated with the possibility of a multiplicity of worlds. Such thinkers included: in the thirteenth century Etienee Tempier, Bishop of Paris; the Parisian theologians Godfrey of Fontaine, Henry of Ghent, and Richard of Middleton; in Oxford, the theologians William of Ware, Jean of Bassolos, and Thomas of Strausbourg; in the fourteenth century - both Jean Buridan (c. 1295-1358), rector of the University of Paris and William of Ockham (c. 1280-1347), of Oxford; and in the fifteenth century - the famous theologian-philosopher and cardinal Nicolas of Cusa (1401-1464).  
&gt;
&gt; Nicolas advocated an infinite universe of worlds without a center and merits special note as the first Euroepan Christian thinker to advocate life on other worlds. His influence on Bruno was profound.

true,goethe_human,null,null,"Zunächst vielen Dank für deinen moralischen Beistand; ich weiß das sehr zu schätzen - auch wenn ich meine Meinungen nicht von Mehrheitsverteilungen im Internet abhängig mache.

Ich sehe Probleme mit dem Begriff Rechtspopulismus in diesem Zusammenhang.

Zuerst aber zum Rassismus.

Es gibt nur eine menschliche Rasse. Die Vorstellung, es existierten mehrere Rassen, war eine menschliche Irrung, die mittlerweile widerlegt ist. Somit kann es keine Diskriminierung aufgrund einer Rassenzugehörigkeit geben. 

Verschiedene menschliche Rassen existierten niemals; es war immer eine Diskriminierung ausgewählter Gruppen aufgrund beliebig gewählter Merkmale und zugeordneten Eigenschaften. Historisch bedingt einigte man sich deshalb darauf, diesen Vorgang als Rassismus zu bezeichnen.

Rassismus ist die kollektive Diskriminierung beliebig gewählter oder geschaffener Gruppen. 

Rassismus ist immer gekennzeichnet durch eine Einteilung in Gruppen. Und diese Gruppen erhalten Attribute, die auf alle Mitglieder dieser Gruppe vererbt werden - genau wie bei der objektorientierten Programmierung, falls du dich für die Informatik begeistern kannst, nur eben mit Menschen. 

Einige solcher Gruppen, deren Mitglieder mit Stigmata versehen wurden, sind Arbeitslose und besonders HartzIV-Empfänger, es sind Asylanten, es sind Moslems; es sind aber auch Katholiken, respektive Protestanten, in Nordirland, ebenso wie die Anhänger eines verfeindeten Fußballklubs. Es gibt die Gruppen der Homosexuellen und der Frauen, usw.

Die Mitglieder werden solange diskriminiert, wie sie (bekennendes) Mitglied dieser Gruppe sind, oder bis sich die diskriminierte Gruppe auflöst.

Weshalb ich Probleme mit dem Begriff Rechtspopulismus habe, liegt nun nahe. Rassismus findet sich in der Mitte der Gesellschaft, wie auch am linken Rand des politischen Spektrums - es ist keinesfalls auf Nationalisten beschränkt.

Vor einigen Jahrzehnten hat man das althergebrachte, eindimensionale politische Links-Rechts-Spektrum um eine zweite Dimension erweitert - nämlich um die Vorliebe für Autorität. Je stärker die ausgeprägt ist, umso mehr neigt diese Person zur Diskriminierung anderer, und somit auch zum Rassismus. Es ist also möglich ""links"" oder in der Mitte zu sein und trotzdem rassistisch zu diskriminieren.

Populismus an sich ist auch nicht zwingend negativ besetzt. Zu sagen, was das Volk (populus) denkt, ist in einer Demokratie nichts Verwerfliches - im Gegenteil.

Deshalb finde ich den Begriff Populismus, in einer Situation, in der es um Rassismus geht, verharmlosend und nicht angemessen.

Viele Rassisten fühlen sich der Mitte der Gesellschaft zugehörig, assoziieren aber mit Rassismus rechtsradikale Schläger am Rande der Gesellschaft, mit denen sie ansonsten nicht viel gemein haben.

[J'ai montré](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/20m9er/inflation_de_rumeurs_et_de_hoax_racistes_nouveau/cg4vphr) qu'il y avait des déplacements de personnes depuis la région parisienne vers les campagnes (au minimum quelques centaines par an.

Ensuite, il y a eu pendant un certain temps une politique de ""panachage ethnique"" dans les logements sociaux. On [tentait de mettre des blancs](http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2014/03/06/les-bailleurs-sociaux-font-du-panachage-ethnique-sans-le-dire_4378493_3224.html)  autour de Paris et réciproquement, en dehors de Paris les immigrés sont prioritaires (ne serait-ce que parce qu'ils sont plus pauvres et ont des familles plus nombreuses) en HLM. Par exemple, en Franche-Compté, [40% des immigrés vivent en HLM](http://insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?reg_id=16&amp;ref_id=17408&amp;page=essentiel/ess11129/).

true,chodechugging,ROMA,Romania,"I'm curious as to what NATO will do if Moldova gets invaded, Romania sends troops across the Prut, the border between Romania and Moldova essentially disappears and Russian troops start appearing in the Danube Delta. 

Romanian troops crossing the Prut in case of Russian invasion is primarily a defensive act, the people living in the 2 territories being one and the same throughout 2000 years of continuous history, only being recently separated by Russian aggression. I doubt NATO will acknowledge this though. In fact, I think it's gonna be a perfect excuse for them to continue doing nothing when Russian troops start taking over Romanian ports. Because Moldova is not in NATO and Romania brought this onto itself by being the ""aggressor"". It doesn't even matter, hostile Russian troops would be present on NATO territory with no repercussions. The circumstances of both the Russian troops' presence in NATO territory and NATO's inaction are ultimately unimportant, what's important is a precedent would have been firmly set. 

That would be the perfect stepping stone Putin needs to attack Estonia. Not that he needs it that badly. To me, NATO is all but defunct. The European side has shown...let's not even talk about that. And Obama just showed Putin [his vagina](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/20usfd/president_obama_no_us_military_action_in_ukraine/).

And any bull that kills the Torreo (sp?) is too dangerous to be put in the ring again because it knows the trick.  He didn't like it either when only saw a bullfight because the the fighter was not good enough to kill it quickly and eventually, this is crazy, the Guardia Civil had to come down and shoot the bull to put it out of it's misery.

That said, the US has been in talks with European nations over exporting LNG for years. Mostly Eastern European nations have been the most interested. The problem is it needs strong commitments before building additional LNG liquification and export capability because they're extremely expensive. Europe has been on the fence, mostly because Russia can manipulate prices to make sure Russian gas is always more competitive. US gas is $1 (7%) more expensive than Russian gas per million btus, after liquification and delivery to the port of Hamburg. Russian PM Medvidev said he sees those trends continuing (aka Russia will make sure it is always roughly 7% cheaper than US). 

Because of the expense the US needs firm commitments. This is where deals have fallen apart. Many EU nations are not ready to commit to voluntarily spending an additional 7% when Russian gas is readily available. This is coupled with the fact Japan and South Korea have offered to build liquification and export hubs on the West coast. So if European nations are serious about spending a little more to diversify their energy sources, they should begin negotiating now. If Japan and SK get the most preferential contracts, it may be even less feasible for Europe in the future.

Well, the Russians are pretty damn efficient in Chechnya. Also Spanish Civil War comes to mind. And the conflict in Peru. So no, i wouldn't be so categorical.

&gt;using the best equipment that the Americans made at the time..

Actually you should brush up on that. Israel went into Suez crisis equipped with WWII-era tech. And later on, when the 6-days war came, Israel was equipped with (mostly)inferior French and Belgian gear. This also came at a time when Israel had a very very hard time purchasing new equipment or even spare parts from France or UK, while the Arabs had the newest state-of-art Soviet tech shipped by the boatloads. Israel was really nervous toward the end of 6-days war, since Israel was was literally running out of everything. AFTER the 6-days war Israel established arms imports from the US, so it went into Yom-Kippur war with US tech. But even then, I wouldn't call it superior to what the Arabs had, since the same tech performed quite poorly against the Soviet-made equipment in Vietnam.",0,1395346318,null,0,1395347158,0,cg7o33h,t3_20vymv,t1_cg7o33h,t1_cg7n8vx,null,1432995084,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2
