Unfortunateöy i have no idea, if american credits are accepted. The easiest way to find out would be to write a short mail to any university you are interested in. They are mostly very polite and answer very quickly.

You should definitely check out the universities of Leipzig and Zittau/Görlitz for east german ones, the Hochschule Rhein-Waal (while many of their bachelor degrees are in english now, their only biology master, in this case biomimetics, is in german) and the university of Münster.

At least Münster and Leipzig of the Universities above, should have standard application times. That means the deadline for the summer semestre (starting in april) is the 15. of January, and the deadline for the winter semestre (starting in oktobre) is the 15. july.

true,brother_number1,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; traditions and culture of the ""British nation"" are actually those of England

There are a lot of Scottish traditions that are British, likewise English traditions that are British. In fact I'd say I've seen more Scottish ""traditions"" and culture in the English part of Britain than I have uniquely English traditions in Scotland. I've yet to see a Morris dancer prancing through Sauchiehall Street, but there are Scottish and Irish traditional music sessions played regularly throughout English cities and towns. Not just by ethnic Scots and Irish. Burns night is not just confined to Scotland, Hogmanay neither.  I suppose Christmas in Scotland being more of a thing than it used to be, is perhaps a bit of an English influence up here. That's fairly recent though, was only 1957 that it became a public holiday in Scotland.

But in a geographical sense every Scottish, English or Welsh tradition is a British tradition, in the same way they are also a European tradition.

It'd be a futile, unsupported, vastly inefficient one-way suicide mission. That being said, it could be a potential avenue through which to send a small (1-2 planes) infiltration force, small enough to avoid detection and designed to land somewhere in the upper Canadian wilderness before proceeding on ground (you could probably arrange for a vehicle to be available nearby through spies/operatives in Canada, which I guarantee you Russia has) to their target/the American border. Not really sure what that small of a strike force would really hope to accomplish though, plus there are plenty of other tried and true methods the Russians have for infiltrating their operatives into foreign nations (including the U.S., but we also have tried and true methods for smoking them out/minimizing their capabilities) that are likely easier and more cost efficient than flying them over the North Pole.

true,RomeVacationTips,null,null,"Hey, I run a website that gives [free independent vacation tips about Rome](http://romevacationtips.com/).

Usually I turn reddit questions into pages for the site, but your question is kinda specific so I'll just answer it here.

OK, plug over. 

1) Note this is my opinion only: you'll be fine. I've wandered around Rome city center at all times of the night and never had any problems. With the exception of Castel Sant'Angelo and the Vatican, everything you mention is within about 10 minutes' walk of everything else. Stick to well-lit city streets (e.g. Via del Corso), and you will find few shady characters wandering around. The Trevi Fountain is particularly rewarding around 4-5am when there is literally nobody around it (during the day the crowds are obnoxious). 

The only area really to be wary about in the city center is Campo dei Fiori, where there are a lot of bars and clubs, and therefore drunk people. There have been a few incidents of violence there in the past few years, though always connected to soccer matches.

The Vatican, St. Peter's and Castel Sant'Angelo are about 20-30 minutes' walk from the dead center of the city. To get between them you can walk along the river; there are highways either side of the Tiber called ""Lungotevere"", but even though you'll find a lot of traffic drving down them, for a pedestrian that area is indeed quite dark and lonely at that time of night. If you can find a cab that might be a good idea.

The only other piece of advice I have is what I'd say for any other city: keep your wits about you, particularly if you're setting up a shot using a tripod and you may be exposed and distracted. But ultimately Rome is a pretty safe city, and muggings are very rare indeed.

2) Many tour companies do 'twilight' tours that start at the Spanish Steps and go all through the piazzas. These tend to last 3-4 hours and to finish around 10-10.30pm. One of the better ones I've been on is with Walks of Italy (Google it, I'm independent and not an affiliate!) but I don't know any that do actual night-time walks, apart from (in my opinion obnoxious) pub crawl tours, which are unlikely to focus on history and esthetics!

Hope that helps. If you have any other questions please feel free to [ask an expert on Rome Vacation Tips](http://romevacationtips.com/ask-a-rome-expert/).

Bad for the Finns - Sweden has very, very limited military capabilities right now. We have cut the budget so hard that some soldiers can't even practice with ammo, they run around in the woods yelling ""bang bang!"". Yes, seriously. Our defence spending is a small shrapnel of what it once was. Thus, we wouldn't be bringing very much to the table.

Bad for the Swedes - If Russia were to invade Finland, we would be the ones to come to Finlands aid. Due to the fact that the military might of Russia vastly outnumbers that of Finland, supporting could possibly be a suicide mission, leaving Sweden open to conquest when the two countries inevitably loses to Russia.

Think on it. Russia rolls into Finland, after a period of propaganda and subversive activities. We consider an invasion, and it would probably not be the manual, tedious invasion from WW2, but could be a fast assault by land, air and sea simultaneously. Sweden is obliged to help, and sends some of it's very limited forces into Finland for backup. This could be air support mainly, which could be moved swiftly into place. Since Sweden has so little resources, everything we send to help Finland weakens our own already poor capabilites greatly, leaving us open to attack.

On the other hand! An alliance with Denmark-Norway-Sweden-Finland. That's an idea I could stand behind. A defence pact, not for aggression outwards. This could be very good for all our countries, if we were to pool our resources together. Cross-country-exercises would not be far or difficult.

Be aware of the language barrier and make sure to keep that in mind. I had some missunderstandings with my host family and they were very nice about it. For example, I once confused a funeral home with a nursing home (yes, seriously) and instead of getting upset or even angry they laughed and explained. Or my guestmom asked me if I had a fever and I said that yes, her pancakes were totaly delicious because I thought she had asked me if i had a new favourite (food). 
Also if you need to make sure she understood something, really make sure. She might be to shy to admit, that she didn't fully understand. 

The other thing - allready mentioned by someone else - patriotism. We had a thing where they presented the hockey team of the school and talked about how proud they were. Then everyone got up and pointedwith their right index finger at a text on the wall (some kind of school-specific pledge of alligence?) and recited the text. It was super weird for me to see 500 people raising their right arm in one direction... right out of a history book. I really needed to talk about this afterwards. 

But other then that? I think she will have a great time with you! The pure fact that you care enough to ask around here for advice/tips, shows that you will be great!

I'd wager it's more about the UK's involvement in warfare rather than another country. In general it's mostly the right wing which are suddenly very anti-war as soon as it's another country (like Russia) doing it. The UK anti-war movement usually don't bother getting involved unless the UK is trying to get involved.

I would wager there would be a significant anti-war movement if the UK was doing in Ukraine what it was preparing for Syria, or Libya, or Iraq, or Afghanistan etc..

There have been protests all over Europe against Russia's actions. And they have been treated by the media and on social media/reddit etc.. in a much nicer way than any anti-war or students or equality protests ever have been.

Il rovescio della medaglia è che c'è anche chi non accetta il proprio lavoro di fatica fisica e cerca di sistemare, se non sé stesso, i propri figli in lavori da ufficio dove ""non si fa niente"". :-|

Questo secondo me va inserito in un contesto in cui esiste un certo atteggiamento elitario da parte di gente colta che usa la cultura come *status*, da cui un conseguente disprezzo per i lavori manuali e per chi li compie.

&gt;Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dačić proposed the partition of Kosovo as a solution to the Kosovo dispute. He stated that ""This is my opinion, although neither Belgrade nor Priština like it. However, I am a realistic politician and I don’t see any other solution... I think that the only realistic solution is that places where Serbs live stay in Serbia and that the other part where the Albanians live secedes. This is the only realistic way that can lead us to a quick solution... Other solutions are a waste of time and years and decades would go in an attempt to solve those small issues""

You are young yourself, give her some space. Even if she isn't sexually active, she may start during her stay.

Be open for questions. With you being so young, she'll probably see you more as some type of older friend than her mother. Allow her to confide in you, it's easier to talk to a friend than to her mother. Give her access to condoms, you don't want to deal with a pregnancy scare or STDs.

If you absolutely cannot do all that because of your beliefs or morals or law (what's the age of consent?), talk to her about it openly. She's coming from a society that is a lot more open about sex, so you might want to explain the local view on things.

1. The bicameralist system with a bullshit senate. (Not that a powerful senate would be better, just one chamber.)
2. The province as the electoral district, and a relatively high minimum allotment of seats harm proportionality.
3. The really complex system to assign competencies to autonomous regions, with the triple system for access to autonomy, and arts 149 and 150 which lead to constant court cases at the TC.
4. The monarchy.
5. The iridium-reinforced stability of elected governments. Motion of censure must be constructive, the executive can dissolve the chambers.
6. The rigid system of modification makes it practically impossible to change except when the EU commands it (both times it was modified).

Etant élu depuis le début des années 80, il a transformé Levallois, friche industrielle en ville attractive pour cadres avec enfants, et de ce fait a attiré je ne sais combien d'entreprises , a partir desquelles (taxes) il peut financer sa dette.

Edit: Je voulais ajouter que les Levalloisiens ne voient pas les effets de la dette. Les services municipaux ne sont pas supprimés, la politique municipale reste la meme dans l'ensemble, et qui plus est, pourquoi eliraient ils quelqu'un d'autre alors que Balkany leur donne TOUT ?

&gt; On Friday, Vladimir Putin signed a law on the adoption of the Crimea and Sevastopol to Russia, which means their final accession as the 84th and 85th regions. One of the legal consequences of the recognition of the peninsula will become part of Russian criminal liability for those who will speak publicly about the need to bring it back to the Ukraine.

&gt; C May 9 calls to action for the return of the Crimea to Ukraine will be punished by a heavy fine or up to five years, it should be signed at the end of 2013, Vladimir Putin Law on Amendments to Art. 280 of the Criminal Code. **Newly introduced Article 280.1 ""public calls for action to violate the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation""** complements article on punishment for calls for extremism and states that such appeals shall be **punished by a fine or up to 300 thousand rubles. or two-year income, or by compulsory works for a term of up to 300 hours, or imprisonment for up to three years**. If those appeals will be **in the media or on the Internet** - by compulsory works for a term of up to 480 hours or by imprisonment for **up to five years**.

&gt; The Bill was adopted on the initiative of the Communist Party Gennady Zyuganov, in collaboration with the Communist deputies. He passed the parliament as soon as possible - made December 10, 2013, December 20 for a third reading vote 447 deputies of the State Duma, and already 28 December 2013 signed by Vladimir Putin. Nevertheless, the law will come into force until May 9, 2014.

&gt; The explanatory note Zyuganov and other deputies noted that the territorial integrity of the current legislation is not considered as a separate object of criminal law protection, so ""imposed rules allow prevent possible separatist tendencies and calls for action to the assignment of the Russian territory to foreign countries, as well as prevent the spread of information to justify these actions. "" ""Every State shall refrain from any action aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity of the territorial integrity of any other state or country,"" - quoted lawmakers Declaration on Principles of International Law, adopted by the UN in 1970.

&gt; For opinion or debate on the advisability of joining the Crimea to Russia to prosecute under this law should not, says one of the authors of the initiative, an MP from the Communist Party Vadim Solovyov. ""The law we are talking about such calls, such as:"" Boys, let's take up arms and disconnect the Crimea ""- he explained RBC. Deputy Ilya Ponomarev, only voted against the adoption of the Crimea to Russia, will avoid criminal liability, sure Soloviev. However, he admits that ""fools and no law may be different excesses.""

&gt; ""There was a case - an example MP - when Gennady Zyuganov wanted to prosecute for contempt of the president when he's on one of his meetings with voters told an anecdote about Putin. There have already started testing, but Gennady Andreyevich then Putin personally told this anecdote, the president laughed, and that the incident was over. ""

&gt; The Penal Code also punishes incitement to terrorist activity or public justification of terrorism, calls for extremist activities and aggressive war.

Get your facts straight. In March 1921 there was no Belarus nor Ukraine as a separate countries. It was all USSR - USSR that attacked Poland. Ukrainians were fighting for their independence during that time, but in March they still haven't had it. Yes, in a way it was a betrayal of people fighting for independent Ukraine, but it wasn't a partitioning.

&gt; jackals gathered around the dead body

You got your quote wrong.

&gt; This was little different from what Stalin did to Poland in 1939.

It was very much different once you try to find out what was the situation back in 1938. Poland was surprised by ZSRR attack, and it was one of the reasons why German invasion succeeded so greatly - on the other hand Poland notified Czechoslovakian government before sending it's own troops to Zaolzie and Czechoslovakia agreed on that knowing that Germans are about to annex their country - it was basically lesser of two evils for them. (Still though it's certainly a shameful act, one of the darkest pages of inter-war history of Poland)

Historically, that's how it has always been. The few FN mayor experiments proved disastrous. They used to be an anti-Republic party anyway. But since a few years ago things have changed, the Le Pen daughter has made her father's party something closer to a ""realistic right"" than the orignal fascist tendencies of the FN. She tried to take her distances from openly xenophobic or ultra-catholic movements, she kept silent during the same-sex wedding thing.

Now for more and more people, the FN is a ""regular political party"". Not for everyone (yet), but more and more. We'll see how long the trend holds, and if voting FN ends up being a real conviction vote, rather than the ""contestataire"" vote it has pretty much always been. 

For the moment, this rise of the far-right is mainly a problem for the traditional right.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"I don't think it's ""the improving economic outlook"" and the ""increasing confidence in Prime Minister Samaras"" that allowed Greece to get away with this. It's the opposite: The EU parliament elections are coming and the creditor countries don't want any accident in Greece to destroy their image that ""we solved the Greek problem"". The Greek politicians can sense that and can ask for more than they normally would. Same shit happened in the previous elections: the recent German elections and the 2012 Greek elections, so it's a bit suspicious that the WSJ hasn't caught on. 

But let's take a step back: what did Greece get away with exactly? The article cites that the troika will show some flexibility in forcing Greece to adopt a new round of crushing austerity measures that were suggested by the OECD. The extent of this flexibility is unknown: for all we know it might mean that the worst-hitting measures will be postponed until after the elections. Greece also managed to get a deal to spend 17% of the primary surplus (which we actually don't know how big it will be) as a ""social dividend"". The budget of this social welfare one-off payment is going to be a measly 0.5 billion euros in the best case. The original promise was that 70% of the primary surplus would be spent on the poor. 

In summary: Greece is hardly winning the negotiations and the few concessions the troika is making can hardly be attributed to Greece's economic recovery. 

PS: I'm suspecting that we'll see a lot of ""Greece is doing fine!"" articles up until the EU elections. It suits the creditor countries because they show their own electorate that they ""solved the problem"" and at the same time they are paying back the Greek elites for their obedience so far. If they don't support the current establishment, the government might fall and who knows if the next government would be as willing to do their bidding.

But there indeed is closer military co-operation in the works, which sounds like smart thing for both of us to do. Initiative for that has been going on for quite some time and the defence ministeries in both countries have been working together looking at different options for military co-operation that would benefit both countries. Just a couple of weeks ago Swedish defence minister Karin Enström and her Finnish counterpart Carl Haglund were in Finnish TV discussing it and said that the relevant report prepared together will be ready and published in the near future within months.

What those options might be are joint procurement of armaments, maintaining techonological and organisational compatibility, joint military exercises, joint air and sea control etc...

To address the situation, YLE hosted a discussion with three defence ministers, **Karin Enström** of Sweden, **Ine Eriksen Søreide** of Norway and **Carl Haglund** of Finland. They were joined by undersecretary of state for defence policy ot the Estonian government, Mr. **Sven Sakkov**. The discussion was recorded at YLE studios on March 7th, 2014, and a shortened version of it was broadcast as part of a larger security debate with Finnish parliamentarians on March 12th. This is the complete version of the ministers' discussion.

Historically before WWII there were proposals and initiatives for alliance between the Nordics and also bilaterally between Finland and Sweden. But those initiatives were not successful. And especially after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact both Stalin and Hitler opposed such ideas and did everything they could to undermine such initiatives, including threats, as they had other plans for Nordic countries. The last effort was after the Winter War in 1940 as Sweden and Finland negotiated and finalized a bilateral defence agreement and were ready to sign it. Stalin said he would consider such defence pact a *casus belli* and prepare for war if you sign it, so Sweden had to back up from that one at last minute.

The future options for Sweden and Finland are:  

1. Both militarily non-aligned  
In this case co-operation is the smart thing to do. When the report is published we'll see what that co-operation might cover.

2. A bilateral defence pact  
At the moment does not seem like an actual option but things might change in the future.

3. Both NATO members  
There is no option where Sweden joins NATO but Finland not. If Sweden someday applies for NATO membership Finland has to apply too asap. NATO membership does not have popular support in either country but that might change in the future.

Those two are definitely related, several studies confirm that. Mortality for home births in the Netherlands is 2.3 times higher than for comparable hospital births (and one needs to factor in that those home births are generally the births that are considered low risk where hospitals have to deal with all kinds of births).

By just about any measure, home births are needlessly risky endeavors that cost lives. It's hard to imagine that as many women would opt for a home birth if they were properly informed about the significant risks involved by the midwives.

Imagine a mother was given the choice between two car seats for their child:

One of them makes it more than 2.3 times more likely that her child will die during a car crash - but it is slightly more comfortable and it matches the car's interior a lot better. It's also made by a really nice, small, local company who you feel you can really trust.

Parfois, j'aime bien Lordon. 

Mais plus le temps passe, plus je me dis que les obsédés de la lutte contre les inégalités ou de la lutte des classes ont loupé beaucoup de choses à force de se pencher uniquement sur les questions de répartition, et non plus de créations de richesses. Qu'ils soient marxistes, marxiens, ou d'autres écoles.

La redistribution comme l'existence d'une lutte des classes sont des questions *très* importantes. Le souci est quand cela se met à bouffer tout l'espace intellectuel de certains auteurs (très bons, d'ailleurs) ou que cela devient du rabâchage.

Et surtout, lorsqu'on s'enferme dans un univers où l'économie est une question de jeu ""à somme nulle"". En résumé : tout ce qui est donné à mon voisin m'est en fait retiré. 

**Sur l'article**

Il est particulièrement ennuyeux et indigeste. 

Ce qui aurait dû être un rappel, une opposition intelligence aux baisses de charges des entreprises, devient une sorte de tribune surchargée de concepts balancés à la va-vite, tournant un peu en rond et finissant par dire, en gros : ""ce qui créé des emplois, c'est la *conjoncture*"". Ah béh ouais. Aussi simple que ça. Et juste avant tout ça, on nous explique très longuement en quoi le Capital nous prend en otages.

**Je copie deux extraits.**

Celui qui explique le sens de l'article :

""En tout cas, derrière « les entreprises ne créent pas d’emploi » il ne faut certainement pas voir un énoncé à caractère empirique — que les vingt dernières années confirmeraient pourtant haut la main en tant que tel... Il s’agit d’un énoncé conceptuel dont la lecture correcte n’est d’ailleurs pas « les entreprises ne créent pas d’emploi » mais « les entreprises ne créent pas l’emploi ». Les entreprises n’ont aucun moyen de créer par elles-mêmes les emplois qu’elles offrent : ces emplois ne résultent que de l’observation du mouvement de leurs commandes dont, évidemment, elles ne sauraient décider elles-mêmes, puisqu’elles leur viennent du dehors — du dehors, c’est-à-dire du bon-vouloir dépensier de leurs clients, ménages ou autres entreprises.""

Sur la ""conjoncture"" :

""Tout ceci signifie alors que nous n’avons pas à déférer à toutes leurs extravagantes demandes au motif qu’elles détiendraient le secret de la « création des emplois ». Elles ne détiennent rien du tout. Mais si l’emploi n’est pas créé par les entreprises, par qui l’est-il donc, et à qui devraient aller nos soins ? La réponse est que le « sujet » de la création des emplois n’est pas à chercher parmi les hommes, en vérité le « sujet » est un non-sujet, ou pour mieux dire la création des emplois est l’effet d’un processus sans sujet, un processus dont le nom le mieux connu est la conjoncture économique — terrible déception de ceux qui attendaient l’entrée en scène d’un héros... La conjoncture économique est en effet ce mécanisme social d’ensemble par quoi se forment simultanément revenus, dépenses globales et production. Elle est un effet de composition, la synthèse inintentionnelle et inassignable des myriades de décisions individuelles, celles des ménages qui vont consommer plutôt qu’épargner, celles des entreprises qui lanceront ou non des investissements — et, drame pour la pensée libérale-héroïsante, il faut avoir la sagesse intellectuelle de s’intéresser à un processus impersonnel.""

You clearly underestimate the importance of midwifery services to a pregnant woman, to new families and infants, not to mention women in the process of giving birth. It is stated by law that midwives have to attend the birthprocess, it is NOT a doctor's business. Most doctors, even Gynocologists, are not nearly as trained and qualified. Additionally, with the schedules in a hospital, doctors most likely won't have time to attend every birth process - which will be left to the nurses who might have gotten a crashcourse on how to deliver babies. If any complication arises, how are these people supposed to know how to handle it? So they come up with the greatest interventions, most likely resulting in c-sections. This scenario is of much higher risk than letting trained staff perform.

&gt; 30.Our Strategic Concept underscores our commitment to ensuring that NATO has the full range of capabilities necessary to deter and defend against any threat to the safety of our populations and the security of our territory. To that end, NATO will maintain an appropriate mix of conventional, nuclear, and missile defence forces. Missile defence will become an integral part of our overall defence posture. Our goal is to bolster deterrence as a core element of our collective defence and contribute to the indivisible security of the Alliance. We have tasked the Council to continue to review NATO’s overall posture in deterring and defending against the full range of threats to the Alliance, taking into account changes in the evolving international security environment. This comprehensive review should be undertaken by all Allies on the basis of deterrence and defence posture principles agreed in the Strategic Concept, taking into account WMD and ballistic missile proliferation. Essential elements of the review would include the range of NATO’s strategic capabilities required, including NATO’s nuclear posture, and missile defence and other means of strategic deterrence and defence. This only applies to nuclear weapons assigned to NATO.

In the current climate, with Russia having just annexed Crimea, NATO members are not unilaterally disarming. If iScotland wants the benefit of NATO membership it should also be prepared to accept that having nuclear weapons, for the present, remains one of the burdens. The cost to rUK of iScotland refusing to have nuclear weapons on its territory would be billions.

Also, why would Scotland even want to be a member of NATO if you have a principled position against the West having nuclear weapons. It is extremely selfish to want people in France, US and rUK to have to pay to defend you, but not be prepared to contribute to that.

I dont know so much about you other 2 question, but i try to answee them as good as possible. There are quite a few ways to learn much german in a short time. For example, try looking for the Goethe or Humboldt institue. They are offering german language crash courses and cultural stuff. I even think some of them offer some free online courses. A friend of mine did a 8 week course of dutch before she moved to the Netherlands and she claims that she had nearly no problem in followong the lectures. In Germany you could look for a ""Volkshochschule"" or VHS in short. That aome kind of Adult education center offerimg all kinds of languages including german for foreigners. I think german will be rather easy for a native english speaker, but even if you dont feel confortable taking exams in german, many faculties offer foreigners to take dictionaries into the exam and getting more time to finish the exam.
In my state, NRW (Münster and Rhein-Waal are situated there), we have no study fees anymore. The only thing we have to pay is a little administration fee and an optional transportation ticket (which is valid for the whole state, and always cheaper than buying normal tickets), which ranges between 0 and 500€  per semestre. If i recall i right non-eu foreigners have to a special ""guiding fee"" but i couldn't find any valid numbers since we got rid of our tuition fees. My guess would be again, that the easiest way to find out is to ask the university, becausw this fee was always different in every single one. The average living expenses (housing, food, etc.) of a german student are about 800€, but i think its no problem to live on less.

I know mine certainly is. I think this subject is one of the few where one can observe the so-called 'common European values' at work.   

That been said, I still think your notion that one type of mutilation would occur regardless is simply wrong. Education does wonders, even in this matter. It's no coincidence that most educated African women who have been mutilated as children speak against the practice. 

After all, FGM is not religious practice (at least not a required one), but a tradional one. Most of African FGMs are done by village midwifes in unhygienic conditions. Even the FGMs done by nurses in South-East Asia have gone under a heavy criticism.

&gt;The trend towards medicalisation is also worrying because while it may reduce pain and struggling, it would also allow for a deeper or more severe excision – as was being promoted in a village in south Thailand by some missionaries from India. [source](http://www.theislamicmonthly.com/a-tiny-cut-female-circumcision-in-south-east-asia/)

As for the traditional/cultural values of the practise... I don't believe in the sentimental value of a harming tradition. The harm it does is not limited to the medical implications. It helds back the whole society.

&gt;Various reasons are offered for female circumcision, for example, to keep “clean”; to “purify the genitals and bestow gender identity”; to “control women’s sexual urges”; because women can only be beautiful if chaste; to help them not be “as wild”;  to make them “more beautiful in the eyes of their husband”; or to make the latter “more excited in bed.”

Pour Voynet, dans mes souvenirs, la dernière fois que j'ai lu quelque chose à son sujet, c'était dans les Inrockuptibles et c'était au sujet [des milices locales](http://www.lesinrocks.com/2013/06/02/actualite/video-derives-agents-tranquilite-publique-montreuil-voynet-11400139/)...

Pour me pencher régulièrement sur les problématiques de transport en France : c'est un gros sac de nœuds sur le plan politique et technique,  avec pas mal d'expérimentations et de grandes modes (tramway...). Il y a quelques années, l'idée de miser sur la voiture ou la route étaient impensables ; avec la crise, la route revient dans le débat (via les bus à haut-niveau de service, par exemple, l'intermodalité, etc).

Au niveau des tarifs, les élus expérimentent, également. Il y a déjà [quelques exemples en France](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_en_commun#Exp.C3.A9riences_de_gratuit.C3.A9_de_transports_en_commun). 

On peut même dire que [le Figaro](http://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/2014/03/06/20002-20140306ARTFIG00030-les-transports-gratuits-bonne-ou-mauvaise-idee.php) n'est pas spécialement violent à ce sujet. 

Je parle selon mes souvenirs, mais en gros, je me souviens d'échanges sur le sujet avec un maire qui expliquait que cela ne coûtait pas *si* cher. De toutes façons, en France, l'usager paye très souvent une part mineure dans les transports en communs. Dans l'article du Figaro en lien, on peut lire l'avis du GART à ce sujet : ouais, dans certains cas, ça peut inciter à rendre le réseau gratuit ; pas dans d'autres.

Dans les derniers débats parlementaires que j'ai pu suivre à ce sujet, la tendance serait d'accroître la part payée par l'usager sur certains réseaux. Enfin, la tendance... disons que certains émettent l'idée que puisque l'Etat est fauché, les collectivités sous pression et les infrastructures nécessaires dans tous les cas, il *faudrait* que *quelqu'un* mette la main à la poche.

D'un même constat (les usagers payent peu), il y a plusieurs réponses. Si vous dites que l'usager paye peu à certains maires, ils diront qu'autant qu'ils ne payent plus rien du tout (en raison des externalités positives dégagées par des transports en commun gratuits). D'autres diront que les usagers devraient bien plus payer (afin d'équilibrer les budgets et investir dans de meilleures infrastructures).

Mais globalement, j'ai rarement entendu ou lu des choses sur ""l'irresponsabilité"" des maires à ce niveau.

NATO has a whole has enough military strength to defend both its territories and Ukraine. The problem is : does NATO have a diplomatically sound reason to do so ? It's hard for western powers to do anything in former Soviets states. Ukraine being part of NATO would faciltate NATO actions in the area, thus strenghtening it.

Military allies are supposed to augment American power and improve the security position of the United States. The goal should not be to collect allies simply for the sake of collecting allies, regardless of the costs and risks involved. Acquiring an assortment of weak, vulnerable security clients masquerading as useful allies is the height of folly. They are dangerous strategic liabilities, not assets. Yet that is what Washington has done by pushing NATO’s expansion into Russia’s traditional sphere of influence.

I have basically been making this same argument in /r/europe whenever this issue comes up. Admitting the Baltics into NATO was a terrible decision of the same magnitude as admitting Greece was into the Euro. However, the Euro doesn't risk nuclear war making this decision a disaster of epic proportions. They are completely indefensible, and could easily be cut off simply by connecting Kaliningrad to the rest of Russia. If Russia seized control of the Baltic Sea (which it could easily do), any hope of re-taking those countries would be doomed. These countries should be expelled from NATO for this reason.

Seriamente, ormai ho perso il conto delle volte (casualmente sempre in concomitanza di anniversari, istruzioni di commissioni parlamentari o altra contingenza utile per finire sui giornali e/o fornire elementi utili a spingere determinate agende) in cui è saltato fuori qualcuno col complottone dei servizi deviati nel caso Moro: tutta roba che non è mai arrivata a nulla (e se la statistica ha un suo valore, ce ne sarebbe per trarre delle conseguenze) e che ha avuto come unico risultato pratico quello di inspessire la cortina caciarogena intorno alla vicenda.

Ora, tenere in salute la citata cortina è per una significativa maggioranza dell'opinione pubblica un'operazione di vitale importanza (approfondire qui sui motivi per cui questo accade sarebbe troppo lungo, e d'altronde se hai letto l'ultimo capitolo del famoso libro che aveva fatto girare le scatole al tuo professore sospetto minchione già li sai), e questo spiega l'enfasi e la grancassa che vengono alzate - ormai quasi in automatico, ché su certe cose non prendiamo lezioni nemmeno dal cane di Pavlov - ogni volta che arriva l'ultima rivelazionissima.

Alla fine (e al netto di tutta la fuffa che ci viene fatta sopra, che è di sicuro fastidiosa ma sostanzialmente innocua), credo che la cosa davvero seccante comune a tutte le rivelazionissime passate e future sia proprio quella di non contribuire a nulla se non ad incasinare ulteriormente (e quindi a rendere più difficile il lavoro storico) l'intera questione: quelli che vogliono credere al complottone del Fodria - e che lo vorranno e che lo faranno indipendentemente da qualsivoglia evidenza - hanno una nuova freccia al proprio arco con cui incrementare il casino; quelli che al complottone del Fodria non ci vogliono credere si ritrovano con una ulteriore rottura di scatole con cui fare i conti (che all'atto pratico si traduce nel perdere tempo) prima di potersi occupare di cose serie.",0,1395671555,null,0,false,0,cgakcqc,t3_215l57,t1_cgakcqc,t1_cgagm5n,null,1433045179,3,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,3

Since there has to be, by law, this is a problem that the clinics, not the midwives, will ultimately have to solve.

The situation for independent midwives is more bleak by several magnitudes.

&gt; Eines vorweg: es gibt NICHT mehr Schadensfälle!!! Es liegt also nicht an den Hebammen.

I hope we're clear on this: Yes, the increase is not due to midwives becoming sloppier in the recent years but due to the increased insurance payouts when they make a mistake.

However, independent midwives are part of the problem since the ""home birth market"" is exclusively their market and this market is inherently riskier.

I'm simply proposing that one possible solution would be, to considerably shrink this market and thereby massively reducing the amount of perinatal fatalities and disabilities that result in insurance payouts.

If we stopped romanticizing home births and confronted mothers with the cold facts, significantly less infants and mothers would suffer harm and insurance payouts and therefore insurance premiums would be lower.

However, shrinking this market would almost equally shrink the market for independent midwives, so this is not a solution in their personal interest of the group that is currently mostly affected by the problem.",0,1395671604,null,0,false,0,cgakdeq,t3_215mc7,t1_cgakdeq,t1_cgaiufn,null,1433045188,3,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,3

This does not in any way discredit what I said above. The expenditures you mention assume that the primary surplus will be 4 billion. We'll see if that is true. 

&gt; Also: People were screaming some weeks ago because the troika said there was about 10 or 15 billion euro hole in the banking sector ( i cant remember right now). The government insisted that any possible gap would be around 6 billion. In the end the government's case was true. 

""In the end"" no one's case was proven true. They just agreed to let it go for the time being. 

&gt; How can you say, objectively that things haven't changed at all since the beginning, and we are still getting pushed around like we were used to?

Objectively, the austerity measures taken now and the demands of the creditors are becoming bigger and bigger. If you had a time machine and went back in time 5 years and told people then of the measures the government is taking now, they would laugh in your face. They would think it would be political suicide to pursue these policies. 

But here we are today. We've reached the point that even I have to pick and choose which scandals, austerity measures and other bad news from Greece I'll post here; I simply can't cover everything. People are becoming numb to hearing about how many Greeks are starving, how many died from easily preventable diseases, what the newest demonstration of clientelism in the highest echelons of the government was and what punishing austerity measure they'll come up with next. 

For comparison, 2 years ago, I could cover almost everything and people would be absolutely shocked. 5 years ago, I was telling people ""this isn't so bad, we fucked up a bit and now have to spend a little less money"". 

You have to be a fanatical follower of the governing parties to not notice that things are bad and they're getting nowhere near better.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; 1.There are 28 members of NATO. Of these, three are nuclear states and five host US nuclear weapons - Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey (although I think that the Netherlands has been trying to get rid of these for a number of years). So, if Scotland does join NATO that would mean that there would be 21 NATO members without nuclear weapons on their soil - why should Scotland be singled out for criticism?

The reason why Scotland is in a different position from, say, Norway is that Scotland already has nuclear weapons on its territory whereas Norway doesn't. Norway isn't proposing to incur huge costs at a NATO member's expense, just because of some peculiar principles.

Also, you haven't answered my question. If you have a principled objection to NATO having nuclear weapons, why are you wanting to join NATO? And if you don't have this objection, why are you saying that rUK, France and USA should have nuclear to protect you, but that you can make rUK pay billions, at a time that the UK economy is weak, to move the weapons? Don't you realise how selfish this sounds?


&gt; THE UK Government has confirmed that Scotland would be banned from having nuclear weapons after independence under non-proliferation treaty rules.

I don't think so. Maybe some borders. But, so what?

&gt; Lviv would become Polish

I don't think so, but if they want to, let them. Who cares? But I think they would stay within Ukraine, but there would be more pressure on the central government to deliver good policies that benefit the citizens. Because if you don't, your citizens may just leave you.

&gt; Quebec would join France

They vote on that every 15 years or so. Let them join France, so what? But more likely they would become independent. And even more likely, they would not and just stay as they are, because who would leave Canada?

&gt; Catalonia would break off

Good. It would be a great wakeup call for the Spanish government to finally get their shit together and come up with policies that actually serve the people, and not just some elite.

&gt; India and China would fracture

I have not lived in India, so I have no opinion on that. But China would not fracture. In fact, China does not see itself as a country in the Western sense. China is a cultural area, 中华. That's why nobody has a problem with Hongkong and Macao having totally differen systems of govenment within the same ""country"", or that Taiwan is Chinese but not the same country, etc.

&gt;  every third world country, especially in the Caribbean and Latin America, would vote to become a new US state, 

Hardly. Most of them all the opposite. And yes, I have also lived in Latin America for many years and know from experience how people ""tick"". Some parts would maybe try to become independent, but other parts would join together. So hardly any tradgedy.

&gt; It would be chaos.

Less of a chaos than the usual 30+ years of bloody seperatist wars that we currently get when a region *really* wants to split off of their host country.

Imagine, the Kurds would already have theyr own country and so much fighting would not have happened in the past 20 years. Same for Pais Basco. And Northern Ireland. And northern Sumatra. And Mindanao. In East Timor so many lives would have been saved. etc etc.

I don't see what is bad about it. There should be clear international rules though. Becasue otherwise every African town president would try to start his own country.

true,Rc72,EURO,European Union,"&gt;    The bicameralist system with a bullshit senate. (Not that a powerful senate would be better, just one chamber.)

Many better functioning democracies also have a bicameral system. Indeed, it is a crucial part of the checks and balances in both the US and Germany. One may be circumspect about the obstructive role of the US Senate, but the German Bundesrat has time and again proven its usefulness. So, having a second chamber is less the problem than having a *toothless* second chamber. Which we can blame on the senators, rather than the constitution itself.

&gt; The province as the electoral district, and a relatively high minimum allotment of seats harm proportionality.

Said minimum allotment is set by the electoral law, not the constitution (except for Ceuta and Melilla, which get one seat each).  As for the province as the electoral district, I just don't see the problem.

&gt; The really complex system to assign competencies to autonomous regions, with the triple system for access to autonomy, and arts 149 and 150 which lead to constant court cases at the TC.

Here the problem is rather that these articles were infringed from the very beginning, with the ""[Almeria case](http://hayderecho.com/2014/02/28/referendum-andaluz-de-28-de-febrero-de-1980-el-caso-almeria/)"". Hence the subsequent mess.

&gt; The monarchy.

I'm far from being a monarchist, but I don't think that's the biggest political problem Spain has either. In any case, back in 1978, a republic was certainly not in the cards.

&gt; The iridium-reinforced stability of elected governments. Motion of censure must be constructive, the executive can dissolve the chambers.

Again, not a problem in itself. The alternative would have been the inbuilt instability of Italian or Belgian governments, and I don't think that would have been better either. The problems come rather from an electoral law that is hardly in real compliance with Art. 68 of the constitution, and a party law that does not really enforce Art. 6 either.

&gt; The rigid system of modification makes it practically impossible to change except when the EU commands it (both times it was modified).

The whole purpose of having a written constitution is that of having a stable framework. Otherwise you may just as well not have a written constitution at all and make do with a fully sovereign parliament, as in the UK. Looking at how political parties tend to use absolute majorities in Spain, I don't think that would have been a good idea. At all.

true,Devotedfollower,null,null,"&gt; True, but we're still talking about ethnic cleansing and mass murder.

just wanted to stop in here and say that it is widely known that the US were the instigators of this mass murder and ethnic cleansing. This of course because US officials are on record saying that they knew the outcome of the bombings would be this. Please watch Chomsky's discussion of this (your answer comes @ ~7min into it). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsI_aNwKNzQ

As Chomsky states in the above interview, ""to call that genocide is really to insult the victims of the holocaust"".
He has more indepth lectures if you want more of an impartial education on the subject.

Furthermore the KLA was a terrorist organization that was taken off the US's terrorists list shortly before receiving US funding to instigate trouble in Kosovo. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War#Eruption_of_War
And the morals of the then secretary of state Madeline Albright under the Clinton administration are very questionable. I would argue that someone who doesn't care about a half million children who die directly due to their policies/actions is a psychopath who lacks morals and basic empathy for humanity:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEtdw7Z04QQ

You can look more into what Gen. Wes Clark said about this and his photo ops/selfies with previous KLA terrorists -- always a reassurance of the US's moral supremacy and credibility.

Ultimately the US is our neighbour (I'm in Canada) and I find it quite amusing at how many Europeans buy into this antiquated narrative of good vs. evil / black and white view of the US when it comes to their foreign policy. As Chomsky says, this had to do more with forcing the former Yugoslavian states to adopt neo-liberalist policies and the selling of their state industries to private western interests.

Milošević was of course a horrible person, but that does not beget the assertion made by most in westerners that this 'humanitarian intervention' (double speak for NATO's warcrimes) was legitimized through prior intentional instigation.

But if it wasn't for the common regulations, many products simply wouldn't be available in some countries. Even if the product would meet the local regulations, the certification process just wouldn't be worth it for the producer or importer. With the common regulations, producers consider them early in the design phase, and it's enough to have the product certified in one EU country for it to be allowed on the shelves in the rest of the EEA.

It also lets us have regulations we couldn't have otherwise. The recycling directives (electronics, cars), for example, mean that products have to be designed in a way that easily permits recovering materials. It also means producers need to maintain an infrastructure for recovery. Producers would have simply decided that it would be too much effort if an individual country would have tried to introduce something like that on its own.

As with the Milosevic Regime, so does he minimize the crimes of the Khmer Rouge.

&gt;Furthermore the KLA was a terrorist organization that was taken off the US's terrorists list shortly before receiving US funding to instigate trouble in Kosovo

""Instigate trouble""? [You mean when Serbian ultranationalists would turn up in Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazimestan_speech) and stir up crowds with speeches demanding the eradication of Kosovo's autonomy within the constitutional framework of Yugoslavia, and hinting war against Albanian Kosovars?

&gt;I would argue that someone who doesn't care about a half million children who die directly due to their policies/actions is a psychopath who lacks morals and basic empathy for humanity

This is just standard whataboutery.

&gt;I find it quite amusing at how many Europeans buy into this antiquated narrative of good vs. evil / black and white view of the US when it comes to their foreign policy.

Pot, meet kettle etc. etc.

&gt;As Chomsky says, this had to do more with forcing the former Yugoslavian states to adopt neo-liberalist policies and the selling of their state industries to private western interests.

The Yugoslav economy was failing to provide further improvements in living standards. It collapsed on its own accord.

This is even hurting the Irish young who in greater and greater numbers have to work as contractors instead of getting real full time permanent jobs.

They're keeping the already troublesome Irish housing market in a status quo.

I'd like to know if these companies actually bring in any big money to the Irish state or if they're just become a nice-thing-to-have phenomenon. What it surely has done is that it has diluted Irish workers rights and made everyone less secure in their jobs. All because the politicians are too afraid they'll pack up and leave.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; Objectively, you're dead wrong. The bulk of the measures was taken in 2010-2012. With new measures being announced in succession. For some time now, the pressure has been relieved, and there are no new measures in sight. So this is just a talking point.

Objectively, I'm dead wrong? Are you kidding? This is just lying on your part. Just a quick example: between 2010 and 2012, the privatisation goal was 50 billion and the politicians, all of them, said that it would be achieved without selling off anything, just by making leasing agreements and such with the private sector. Two years after that, the goal gets lower and lower and the conditions by which it is to be achieved are getting worse and worse. What once was ""strategic leasing of some real estate"" has become ""sell the most strategic and profitable public utilities and enterprises for as cheap as possible"". And that's just the privatisation front. I could go on with examples from healthcare, labour rights, wages and so on, if you want. 

&gt; So the unworthy westerners do it to punish the proud Greek people? Please... I thought you were better than that.

Such a ridiculous straw-man. First of all, yes: there is an element of punishment in the whole ordeal. The creditor countries speak directly using protestant rhetoric about sinning and punishment. But beyond that, it's [a fucking figure of speech](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/punishing). 

&gt; **punishing** (comparative **more punishing**, superlative **most punishing**)

&gt; 1. That inflicts punishment
2. arduous, gruelling

You're really grasping at straws here trying to construct a strawman to ridicule my arguments. You should be ashamed of yourself for doing this. 

&gt; Why do you guys keep saying that? Things are hellish. But they are getting slightly better. You don't have to be a supporter of the government to admit it. 

Tell me of one thing that is genuinely really better. Just one. And I'm talking about things that have immediate material effects. Not something like ""the decrease of national income on a yearly basis is projected to decrease"". Something palpable, please. 

&gt; Look, everybody agrees that in an ideal world, the best solution would be for the EU to adopt a sort of 'Marshal Plan', where we could spend our way out of the crisis. But this isn't an ideal world, this is Greece, and all these past decades, the money that we borrowed, did not help grow the economy the way it was supposed to, due to enormous corruption. We didn't use it on infrastracture, or making a healthy basis for our economy. I don't think the troika came as a surprise. The lenders wanted to make sure their money wasn't wasted once again.

So, this is what you see going on here? There are macroeconomic effects to take into account but all you do is say ""Yes, it's all Greece's fault and now these good people are helping and they need to make sure we do our part"". The positive spin you put to the whole ordeal is unbelievable. One could apply the same spin to a loan shark and make him seem like a good person. The idea of ""these good people gave us money to help us fix our mistakes and are now making sure it's being put to good use"" is as much a departure from reality as the ""the unworthy westerners do it to punish the proud Greek people"" story you callously attributed to me.

Absolutely not. Italy is second last in Europe for knowledge of foreign languages.

&gt; (vii) italians value history much more than Brits and arguably for Italians the finest period of Italian history was the renaissance which was a particularly European part of history, whereas Brits don't tend to value or think about medieval or early modern history much and arguably the finest period in British history was between the industrial revolution to ww1, a time in which Britain was less interested in Europe (other than the balance of power) and instead more linked to the rest of the world)

Not sure about that. Brits are obsessed with antiques, traditions and the glorious past in general. You cherish your historical heritage, even the less obvious one, like private old houses and pubs. You are (rightly) proud of your Shakespeare, of Queen Elizabeth, and of your role in defeating Napoleon.

Yes. You didn't contradict what I said. The bulk of the measures was taken during these 2 years, and no new measures are in sight.


&gt;You should be ashamed of yourself for doing this.

I should be ashamed? You obviously don't live in Greece so you don't get to hear this on a daily basis. The basic rhetoric from the opposition is exactly that, if not worse. I am not to blame for not understanding that it was a figure of speech, because whenever this topic is discussed, what you said there is considered extremely mild.

&gt;Tell me of one thing that is genuinely really better.

Besides all the economic indicators that are far better than a couple of years ago, as they are mentioned in the article, first two things that come to mind are the record year Greece had regarding tourism, in 2013, and the decrease of the overdue payments (arrears?) from 8 billion euros to 4.4 billion. In the 2014 budget, 2.9 billions are earmarked towards eliminating those.

&gt;One could apply the same spin to a loan shark and make him seem like a good person.

One would have to be a shit loan shark to lend money with 2% interest. And yes it is, in my opinion, mostly Greece's fault.

I read the Wikipedia article you sent me, so I'm judging from that. And it's not like I don't believe you, but even then it's still nowhere the level of control Russia has had over Ukraine. I think the fact that they aren't trying to bully Finland around right now like they are with Ukraine is a testament to that.

The problem is, that from what we can observe without actual tax data it seems like Ireland isn't getting as much as it is offering from the multinationals. Nothing stops any country from competing with Ireland, that is true. But other countries want to secure a tax base so that they can offer the welfare services their citizens demand. This while many of them had to bail out Ireland after the financial collapse, further deepening their anger. Which has to be understood. If Ireland is to enjoy the benefits of the union they also need to live according to the standards set by the other nations.

But as I said, I personally do believe that the FDI stream hasn't always been to the benefit of the Irish people. This is just my belief and I might be wrong. But just looking at the infrastructure in Ireland that is lacking on so many levels, begs the question; what are these companies bringing to the party? Unemployment is as well a double edged sword. If the unemployment rates are down by the use of contractors one might ask if this is a sustainable way to go and how sustainable and stable the unemployment levels are.

No one is saying that you're doing anything wrong. Some are just questioning if this will be sustainable in the long run.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; This does not stop us from seeing us as part of the bigger picture. In the same way, UK has been an empire, with a great navy. They have explored and colonized, sure, but they have also interacted in Europe heavily.

I don't disagree that Brits have been very involved with Europe! That's not my point. But Britain has also been very involved with much of the rest of the world too and that has an impact on us seeing ourselves as part of the wider world just as much as we see ourselves as part of Europe. 

&gt; Especially in Southern Italy and in Venice, in Spain and Greece, and in the Flandres, the British Ambassador was a force to be reckoned. The british community abroad was always very lively, and during the 1800s it felt as part of a European culture which started with the Greeks.

But the British community has also been very strong (and still is) in places like Kenya, Australia and India. British internationalism (and sometimes insolationalism) has generally related to the world at large. Living in London (as I do) I never really feel like I am in a European city. There is so much of the rest of the world here too and this is very much a reflection of Britain's history. Whether you are from Sassari or Sao Paolo, Cagliary or Calgary you can come to London to make your fortune. In the mind of a Brit, an Italian isn't really less foreign than a Bangladeshi.

true,Naurgul,null,null,"&gt; Yes. You didn't contradict what I said. The bulk of the measures was taken during these 2 years, and no new measures are in sight.

First of all, by what metric are we counting? You keep repeating this point but I don't think you understand what you're saying. I presented to you one whole area of reforms where the scale of the measures becomes worse and worse and you just brushed it off. Do you want more examples? What data exactly are you looking for that would convince you that the measures are getting worse and worse? 

&gt; I should be ashamed? You obviously don't live in Greece so you don't get to hear this on a daily basis. The basic rhetoric from the opposition is exactly that, if not worse. I am not to blame for not understanding that it was a figure of speech, because whenever this topic is discussed, what you said there is considered extremely mild.

So, I said something that, if one tries hard enough, can be misinterpreted as something stupid that you think is what the opposition is saying, and that's somehow my fault? It's your fault for believing what the government says about the opposition's points and it's also your fault for applying this strawman not only to the opposition but to me too. 

&gt; Besides all the economic indicators that are far better than a couple of years ago, as they are mentioned in the article, first two things that come to mind are the record year Greece had regarding tourism, in 2013, and the decrease of the overdue payments (arrears?) from 8 billion euros to 4.4 billion. In the 2014 budget, 2.9 billions are earmarked towards eliminating those.

I asked for something palpable and all you mentioned is economic indicators and cheap talking points. The ""record tourism"" thing is laughable and there's not much data to substantiate it. But even if true, you would need to show how it impacted the economy (which it didn't). The rest of the things you mention are just logistical and are good only from the creditors' perspective. 

&gt; One would have to be a shit loan shark to lend money with 2% interest. And yes it is, in my opinion, mostly Greece's fault. 

I can lend you money with 2% interest if you agree to do everything and anything I say. Does that sound like a good offer?

But seriously now, if you only look at the loans themselves, then of course you'd think that. But these loans helped the creditor countries avoid a second costly bailout of their financial sector, bought their companies privileged access to the Greek markets and saved their currency from disintegrating, at least for a while. It was an extremely cheap deal for the creditors to do this while avoiding paying any real money to solve the underlying problem: which is none other than the fact that you can't have monetary union without some sort of political union. 

&gt; And yes it is, in my opinion, mostly Greece's fault. 

Assigning blame like this is mostly a fool's game. I mean, on one side, it's Greece's fault that their economy was not competitive and had a trade deficit. On the other hand it was not Greece's fault because normally monetary unions have fiscal transfers to make it easier on everyone; keep in mind that it's logistically impossible for all the countries to have a trade surplus and it's common sense that it's impossible for all countries to be able to compete with behemoths such as Germany on an equal basis. On the other hand, these transfers were not politically feasible for the other countries to institute, so it's not really their fault either. So, maybe it's Greece's fault that wanted to enter the euro? But who are you going to blame for that? The Greek citizenry didn't know enough economics to make an educated decision and no one asked them anyway. It was mostly a prestige thing for the politicians as well as a way to free themselves from the unions asking for more which caused inflation (the bane of all who are rich). So, it's a bit of no one's fault and everyone's fault. 

So, instead of adopting the simplistic rhetoric of ""it's our fault, now we must pay for our sins"" it's far more intelligent to try to understand what the fucking problem is and how it can be fixed. Grasping at straws trying to find the one economic indicator that is not unambiguously negative to rationalise and vindicate all the bad things that are happening is not the way to do it.

So you are advocating undermining the rest of Europe then? because right now Facebook/Twitter imports most their staff from the rest of Europe since Irish staff don't have the language skills. (Doe's that not say something about where the jobs should be in the first place and why they are in Ireland now, How can this situation be sustainable? )
No wonder the EU were so keen on not allowing Ireland any concessions on debt writedowns when the topic came up.

Sorry but these companies use our infrastructure, staff that had to be educated at a cost etc and after working the books they pay pretty much zero in corporation tax (as in apples case)

The reason other countries don't compete is because they realize these companies are taking advantage but as long as Enda can play it up as ""Tech Ireland"" they can continue to pull the wool over peoples eyes about this ""recovery"" a bit longer.

If anybody had long term interest in a tech sector in Ireland they wouldn't be marketing it as the cheapo call centre of Europe, Oh and if you want to know how this plays out look at what happened the great dell and intel manafacturing after they found somewhere cheaper.

It's too bad that you're mixing an otherwise quality report with your own liberal propaganda. But I guess you're a product of this forum. There used to be other excellent Hungarian commentators that were pro-Fidesz and they got downvoted too many times so I don't see them commenting anymore.

&gt; And sadly, people are buying this shit. 

Do you really, really think that a party can win 2/3 majority in the parliament because people are stupid? And you think you're somehow above-average smart and can see the situation much clearer?

To be clear, I hope they don't win 2/3 majority this time. There needs to be some checks and balances which don't exist right now. But they will definitely win by a majority, and this is not because people are stupid and easily influenced by propaganda, but because they can see what the situation is and will decide that Fidesz is the better party in these elections. 

What is it that the opposition parties propose?        
MSZP - abolish the flat tax, meaning it will punish everyone earning above the average; their leaders are the exact same that almost bankrupted Hungary

And that 2013 compared to these years was not as harsh. And that there are no new measures, at least of that magnitude, in the horizon. I am baffled that you would argue that, but let's just agree to disagree.

Have you read any of the recent memorandums? What privatisations they include, reductions in minimum wage, reductions in worker rights and all that? I mean, we can argue that technically the intensity of measures taken is not as severe as in the beginning, but this isn't really something to celebrate. If someone has a fever and it's 38 the first day, 39 the second and 39.5 the third, no one would dare say ""most of the fever came during the first day"". So, the metric by which you say ""things are getting better"" is severely biased.

I used the word ""punishing"" to describe austerity and you started telling stories about ""the unworthy westerners do it to punish the proud Greek people"". Now, show me one opposition party that uses that rhetoric on an everyday basis, quotes and everything. 

Your accusation was misinterpretation of what I said placed on top of exaggeration of populist rhetoric by some parties. 

&gt; How can it NOT impact the economy?

Um, show me some indicator of the ""real economy"" that was impacted positively then? Did wages rise in some sectors or something?

Explain to me, please, how any of what you mentioned is ""money that goes straight to the pockets of everyday people"".

Eigentlich man dann ja auch gar keine weiterführende Qualifikation und ist mehr zum mal gucken und lernen da. Schule wird auch nicht bezahlt.

Was ich damit meine ist das ich nicht finde das unbedingt jedes Praktikum bezahlt werden sollte. Warum sollte man da nicht genau wie bei jedem Job auf den Nutzen schauen? Natürlich sollte ein 27-jähriger Master Student genug Qualifikationen mit sich bringen um wenigstens eine geringe Vergütung zu erhalten. Aber pauschalisieren sehe ich hier eher als schädlich.

I mean it's just a cultural thing. Like when you come here you'd probably run past some shitdrunk 16 year olds on a saturday night which probably would be a cultural shock for you aswell.  
I must say though that the words ""not the fact that it actually happened"" kinda frighten me since I feel like the fact that it somehow seems 'normal' for you speaks alot for how casual gunrelated crimes in the US has become. I mean shit if someone in my town commits suicide thats some crazy shit that just has happened.  
For example the other day (this was the first crime in my town I've heard of in like 10 years. As I said I live in a rural part of germany) a guy broke into a house and threatened a boy and his mother with a knife. In the end that guy was arrested and the only one who was hurt  was the guy himself by cutting him while breaking through a window. But that crap was intense and our whole town was in an uproar about it. I couldn't even imagine what would happen if someone in this little town got shot or killed *knocks on wood*  
Anyways long story short: I've been in some parts of the US (sadly not texas yet but I'd like to see it..) and I never felt like I was in danger or anything.  
I somehow think this is just a problem in some parts of the country and if you consider the US is the size of almost the whole EU it's not surprising that there are happening alot more murders than in germany alone.

* Change the way you live as little as you can.  You're in this for an entire school year; if you make a change early on that you can't live with for the entire year, you're going to have to change it back, and explaining that can be awkward.

* Set some house rules up front.  How chores will work, how clean you expect their room to be, what time you expect them to be home on a school night or on a weekend night, what time you expect them to be in bed, how long they can hole up in their room or disappear into the Internet.  Not all of these things will be problems with all students, but if you do have an issue and can point to something you told them when they arrived, it helps a lot.

* DO plan to do some fun things on weekends that you might not have done at first.  They don't have to be expensive - visit local attractions that maybe you haven't been to in years, have a picnic in the park, go for a hike in the woods.  This is especially important in the first month.  Unfortunately for you, that's when school starts, so as a teacher you'll be super busy, but that's when they need you the most.

* DO NOT feel like you have to plan something for them the whole time they are here.  After they have been in school for a month, encourage them to make plans with their own friends rather than with you.

* Homesickness right away may be an issue, but so far we have dodged it.  2-3 months in, however, or maybe as far as Christmas, there's going to be a time when it shows up.

* German teens seem to be a bit more independent than American teens and restrictions at home or at school will probably eventually cause some issues.  This can combine with the homesickness to worsen both.

The point was the everyday basis. It's supposed to be such an influence on you that even hearing the word ""punishing"" brings it back, like a 'Nam flashback. I don't care if one or two politicians say these things once in a blue moon. In order for your defence to work, this must be something you're subjected to every day. it needs to be the official line of parties whose rhetoric is bombarding the media. 

&gt; Just a random article about a specific sector that tourism had a positive impact.

A positive impact to the bottom line of corporations does not translate to general welfare. Show me rising wages or improving public services. Show me more taxes or something tangible. Some corporation making more money that they put in the bank or use it to pay off past debts is irrelevant. 

&gt; How can you possibly make claims like that? If the sector that provides 20% of the GDP of a country has a good year, then the economy overall is better off. 

Not necessarily. First of all, ""good year"" depends on the metric. If the number of tourists is doubled and each of them pays less than half the money, then you get nothing. Even if there's more money coming in, that doesn't necessarily translate to higher welfare; for example the increase could be kept as profit, not taxed or not translated to higher wages.

No, you're right. But can I have a source please? All I remember was a promise that they'd do this. 

&gt; With your example you introduce factors such as remoteness of the islands, with everything that entails, and you pit them against the advantages of an urban agglomeration.

&gt; It's not like Greece is a poor island in the middle of the Atlantic. It's connected by land with the rest of Europe, and is on the crossroads of 3 continents (to quote my 4th grade history teacher). Which admittedly has many advantages.

Well, the location may be great but the technology and level of sophistication of the economy just isn't there. You could argue that theoretically if we go back in time and history plays out differently and Greece does different things then maybe it could be a trading powerhouse with more capital than France and Germany combined. But that's neither here nor there. 

The specific reasons (location, historical, social, cultural and so on) are what they are. But Greece is now behind and it catching up quickly (or at all) can not be taken as a given. To assume that Greece has all that is necessary to be a highly competitive economy is extremely hypothetical. It's totally unverifiable.

&gt; You're welcome to search the impact yourself. You didn't even bother to check that the amount of money that the tourists spent last year was also more than any other year. So anything more I throw at you will fall on deaf ears.

It's up to you to bring evidence to support your case, not me. I remember reading an article on Kathimerini claiming that the tourists spent more money in total but it was pretty dubious. But anyway, unless that money reaches ""the average household"", it's still meaningless. And you'd also have to demonstrate that the impact is bigger than all the other factors going worse and worse. 

This is really pretty funny, actually. When I post bad news on the economy, especially on /r/greece, people freak out and keep telling me ""ok, ok, we get it, things are bad, you don't have to keep saying it, we know"". But then once in a while there's people who attack me accusing me that it's all lies and things are actually getting better.

My aversion to Tutejszy comes from the fact that I spent a lot of time in that environment and to me it associates with the banal and anti-intellectual banter that I heard around me all the time. The really painful ssss sounds that the Tutejszy people seem to emit every time they open their mouths makes me irrationally angry.

My experience seems similar to your experience when you heard the proper Polish syntax for the first time. 

In regards to politics, I don't think ethnic questions should be a platform for any political party. What I care in a political party is the party's approach to economic issues, not that the party wants to allow Polish speaking students to take exams in Polish, even though they live in Lithuania.

---

&gt;The referendum was observed by 135 international observers from 23 countries and by 1,240 local observers.  RT News reported on March 15 that nearly 70 international observers from 23 nationalities had registered to [monitor the referendum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_monitoring).  Apart from the observers, 623 accredited journalists from 169 international media outlets were invited.   The Russian-funded news agency [RT News](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT_News) reported on March 10, 2014 that Crimea invited OSCE [election observers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_monitoring) to monitor the referendum.   However, later in the day, an OSCE spokeswoman said that Crimea did not have the authority to invite the organization into the region as it is not a fully-fledged state and, therefore, incapable of requesting services provided exclusively to OSCE members.  The next day the Deputy Prime Minister of Crimea, Rustam Temirgaliyev, said they did not invite OSCE to observe the referendum in an official manner.  He clarified that a verbal invitation was indeed made by de facto Prime Minister of Crimea, [Sergei Aksionov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Aksionov), but not an official invitation.  OSCE military observers attempted to enter the region four times but were turned away, sometimes after warning shots were fired,   which was another reason given for not dispatching referendum observers.

After working in tech in Ireland this is completely on the spot true. Fortunately enough I wasn't one of these call centre people, but almost every job in tech in Ireland is customer service or support.

IBM, PayPal, Xerox, Symantech, Creative etc... out in Ballycoolin are all call centres. SalesForce and Microsoft in Sandyford are also almost completely phone sales or call center for support. Google (Google Maps) and Oracle out in East Point all call centres except for a few positions. Facebook is also that sales, as is LinkedIn and Twitter. The ""high-tech"" industry in Ireland is almost completely support or sales functions while R&amp;D is done otherwhere in Europe, and the majority of the ones working in tech in Ireland are foreigners. About 90 % of the people you meet in Ireland that work for any of these big tech companies are foreigners. Mainly Spain, France, Germany and young adults from the Nordics that come to work in Ireland for a year while they figure out what they want to study in college.

Irony is that the IT-infrastructure of high-speed internet, 3/4G are all under developed in Ireland. Expensive and un-reliable. On top of that add huge electricity costs compared to example the Nordics. If the Irish politicians would truly want to develop Ireland to a tech hub they'd need to invest billions in just getting the basic IT-infrastructure up to a level beyond the rest of Northern Europe. But that would mean taxing these companies which I don't see them doing.

IMO Everything points in the direction that Yanukovich never had plans to sign an FTA with EU, as he knew that would imply anti-corruption measures and scrutiny of his wealth. He was just buying time and avoiding civil unrest until last November to show the direction that he was taking: A dictatorship supported by Russia.

His corruption was part of the plan to drain Ukraine economy to justify many actions and measures. 

Ukraine authorities in the last few years became extremely corrupt, and where not being punished for corruption because it was coming from above. The president would need support to continue with his agendas if the use of force would be needed, so corrupting justice and security officials was the way to go. He also knew he could steal as much as he could, that this way, ""selling Ukraine to Russia"" he would be always protected by Russia and could continue in power as a wealthy puppet president.  

Russian loans would be justified by the drained economy, and an intervention would be justified by the disorder to protect the increased Russian leverage acquired by the loans. And even if people would be against the Russian loans and interventions, they would have to subvert to it, and when the economy would start stagnating, propaganda would do its work and people would be convinced that Russia was actually a friend and a savior.

The plan went wrong because protests and resistance where not expected to get to the level that they got before the end of Sochi so Putin could start moving his army and taking the evil steps. Putin couldn't afford the shame to get the Olympics boycotted if he acted earlier, and Yanukovich probably fled on his advice as a rescue plan, so Putin could point the current Government as illegitimate, taken over by fascists, and scare the eastern people to start a counter-revolution and to justify what he started in Crimea.

Putin doesn't care about what the world thinks, all he cares is about his popularity and power at home, that with an economy already close to recession he can only continue keep by using the remnants of USSR in people's mentality, boosting nationalistic sentiments which would soar with any show of power and would boost the Russian pride. Taking Crimea and Ukraine would be a pearl, a symbol of new Russian power, the reborn of the Russian empire that Putin has been dreaming about since the fall of USSR. Without it, Putin dreams would be gone and he wouldn't be more that another president. 

Of course we know that he's just bullying Ukraine, a broke country in a phase of weakness... but for Russians is a daring fight against the West, the Nazis, the US, that are all weak and afraid to fight with mighty Russia.

true,Purple10tacle,null,null,"&gt; There's always a leftover risk. You can also have tragic outcomes with the best hospitalsetting.

Yes, that's pretty much the exact argument for out of hospital births that you will hear from midwives promoting them.

It doesn't hold up. I don't even think it's intentionally misleading, I think they need to delude themselves to continue promoting that part of their profession.

&gt; That is why only lowrisk births are taken into account for homebirth.

Yes, home births are normally only considered for ""low risk pregnancies"" - which makes it even more disturbing that a child is over twice as likely to die during such a low risk birth than in all of the comparable low and high risk in-hospital deliveries combined!

&gt; They still have the same leftover risk as births in a hospital.

And that is definitely, verifiably wrong! The fact that independent midwives are making and promoting this incorrect claim is my biggest, quite possibly my only problem with them!

It isn't the same risk, it's a massively increased risk. It's a risk that's doubled, tripled or quadrupled depending on which numbers you want to cite.

Your claim is like saying that riding a motorcycle without a helmet is *as* safe as riding one with because either way there is a leftover risk of serious injury or death. That's complete and utter bullshit and spreading that kind of bullshit costs lives (and back on topic: a lot of money).

I have no other problem with independent midwives. They provide otherwise necessary and important services.

But part of their current problem is self-made. Out-of-hospital births are the biggest factor in this. And I believe that an important factor in resolving the current problem is to stop the misinformation and delusion and to confront everyone with the cold facts.

But you won't find those facts *anywhere* in the current, midwife-lead discussion.

Erasmus is nice because they have a wider range of classes. They have access to all of the USAC classes, plus Erasmus classes, plus those students who are advanced in Italian can take normal university classes. It's a more diverse population, as well. Unfortunately I don't know much about the Erasmus program other than what students tell me. I know that it's very common in European universities though so if you are enrolled in a European university you should be able to access information very easily.
USAC is mostly Americans, some Koreans and this semester an Australian! USAC is cool because they are very, very, very helpful. The staff is always there to hold you up and help you with anything you need - for example, a girl last semester broke her leg and one of the staff members would take her to weekly hospital visits since her Italian was not very good. USAC classes are offered in English, and you can enroll in normal university classes as well if you think your Italian is advanced enough.

Yes, but XVII century is distant history that we know only from books. And I think that's a major difference - *time heals all wounds*.

While every civilian casualty is regrettable and every hardship on the civilian population during a war is tough, sometimes that is the only way to break a country's spirit. As long as the opposing side is still going strong, the war will drag on, causing more death than good.

It seemed to me that diversity was a fact, and actively fighting against it never led to an interesting outcome.

&gt; It sure can be. Recognizing that is why nationalists are gaining a lot of ground in Europe.

I understand that some people like it when everybody is just like them, thinks just like them and does everything just like them. Apparently some people feel threatened if they see others doing things differently. But the fact that nationalists movements are kind of gaining ground right now doesn't mean they are wrong about diversity being the cause of problems. Some people don't want their country to be diverse, they don't want their country to be attractive, and this is often coupled with a refusal of accepting that it's ok if people don't do things the same way you do.

I have lived in cities that place on different regions of the ""diversity"" chart in different countries, and can tell you that the places I'd be most likely to bring my contribution to and most happy to be part of are the most ""diverse"" ones. When the only people that like a place are those who were born there, it tells you something. I like meeting people that have done/seen/thought things I would have never thought of (and I'm obviously not the only one). It is much less likely to happen in places ""diversity"" is frowned upon.

There is no doubt integration issues are important, and when there are strong economical differences criminal activities take advantage of it and criminality can unfortunately be linked to immigration, but it is also true in any monocultural society that has its own inequalities.

And then you have people like that crazyhead at the top of this thread, who think if I like living in places where I can connect with a lot of different people rather than wallow in the idea that the more like me people are the best they are, it *must* be because I'm brainwashed.",1,1395701614,null,0,false,0,cgayzou,t3_218fp4,t1_cgayzou,t1_cgay1xl,null,1433052208,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
