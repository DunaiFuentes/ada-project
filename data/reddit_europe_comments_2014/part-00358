So, in a way, the UK has chosen to implement social welfare for people not able to find work paying a living wage by having what essentially amounts to a negative income tax?

The spirit of freedom of movement has always been that it only exists under the condition that you are not a burden for the receiving state. 

Compare with the Swedish situation. Although there is no legal minimum wage, the effective minimum wages are rather high, due wide-reaching collective agreements. This means that jobs almost always pay living wages. Social welfare can be given to people unable to support themselves, including EU citizens. However, EU citizens only have a right of residence on the condition that they [are actively seeking work and have a realistic chance of finding it](http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/ekonomisktbistand/utlandskamedborgare). This neatly avoids the problem of having EU citizens showing up for the sole purpose of claiming benefits.

Actually, I'm starting to get convinced that you can fix this while staying well within the current EU rules. What you need to do is to more clearly separate income tax one the one hand from social welfare for established residents on the other.",0,1417200397,null,0,false,0,cmfg7lq,t3_2nngie,t1_cmfg7lq,t1_cmfa9se,null,1425799817,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

di contro invece, come ben dice il tuo articoletto, il 90% di tutti gli infanticidi/figlicidi è commesso da donne, e c'è stata una recrudescenza del 600% dal 98 al 2001 (sempre su diritto.it), il che invece mi sembra allarmante e preoccupante

imho, si è barattato il ruolo della donna in quanto colonna portante della famiglia sia dal punto di vista educativo sia da quello di figura che cresce e accudisce, con la masturbazione americana della donna in carriera, cosa che non si realizza per prima negli us&amp;a ed in nessun altro paese, barattando quindi una vita a crescere altre vite con, nella stragrande maggioranza dei casi, una dietro alla scrivania a rispondere al telefono o fare pompini a colleghi impomatati, sottoposte alla costante pressione e minaccia di donne che per avere benessere non fanno altro che sgambettare in minigonna ed infilarsi nei letti giusti, mortificando dopo 30 anni di propaganda qualsiasi donna dovesse preferire una vita ""domestica"" e facendola passare per una cavernicola poveretta ""obbligata"" da chissà quale mostro di marito. in tutto questo, alla donna, un figlio invece che il frutto dell'amore o cmq della vittoria della vita che continua se stessa, appare come la condanna in un ruolo che la società più o meno compatisce, e zac: il bimbo è morto.

If you're gonna use that site you'll also probably want subtitles which can be found [here](http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search) In Portuguese, German, and English for pretty much everything, and also a subtitle editor ( [here's the one I use](http://download.cnet.com/Subtitle-Edit/3000-2170_4-90536.html) ) to edit the timing because it almost never matches up perfectly. 

I've switched over pretty much all of my media to German recently, and my comprehension has really take off. As someone not native to English I'm sure I don't have to tell you not to underestimate just how much help exposure to the language can be.

Oh yeah, Another cool thing to do is [have dual-lingual subtitles](http://actualfluency.com/guide-watch-video-2-sets-subtitles/) because it's really helpful to read and listen to the target language at the same time, but early on German language subtitles alone won't be enough to let you follow the show. The only issue is to use that technique it pretty much has to be a German produced show because all subtitle files you find online are usually translations of the original subtitles, not transcriptions of the dub. So if you get a German subtitle file for, say, how I met your mother, It will say something similar to what they're saying, but always in a different way which makes it really hard to follow. If the show was made in Germany then the German subs will match up perfectly to what you hear (most of the time).

Edit* Oh and one more tip, get Skyrim on steam (if you don't have it it's on sale right now for $10) and change the language in steam settings to German, it's got full voice acting.

But by and large I don't think we disagree too much. Ultimately, everyone in the world is trying to say the same things to each other. We have different approaches, but very few are so utterly alien as to be *that* hard to learn. Every language is going to want to conjoin phrases, so conjunctions. Every language is going to need to count items, so numbers. Every language is going to want to talk about time concepts, so different ways of expressing time.

To deal with the differences, you just need a little neuroplasticity and someone to rap your knuckles every time you ask ""but whyyyyy???"" about a new grammar concept.

Questi non vuol dire un cazzo Cosa si intende per ""motivi basati sul genere""?

I media nazionali calcolano come femmicidio anche i delitti casalinghi per causa scatenanti da litigi tra coniugi che nulla ha a che farci, non come si intenderebbe veramente con ""uso della violenza verso la consorte/compagna per motivi di tipo psicologico/altro"" 

E il motivo basato ""sul genere"" indicherebbe che sia stato fatto unicamente solo perchè la vittima è donna, come detto sopra, perchè potrebbe succedere anche tra uomini che vivono assieme e si urlano addosso. In quel caso il problema è da vedersi nell'incapacità di intendere dell'omicida.

&gt;Inoltre la Accademia della Crusca si é espressa su questo neologiscmo

l'Accademia della Crusca conta un cazzo nell'ambito legale. Il reato è ""omicidio"" che non fa differenza di alcun genere. Perciò continiuamo a parlare di omicidio come smettiamola di usare ""bomba d'acqua"" in sostituzione di ""nubifragio"", per favore grazie.

Non è perchè muore una donna bisogna classificare come un reato a parte ( e più grave) dell'omicidio perchè invece di un uomo è morta una donna per cause che vanno oltre questo ""motivo basato sul genere"" come una aggravante.

Deve esserci parità per tutti se no si arriva ad una situazione in cui le donne sono avantaggiate rispetto agli uomini perchè hanno una vagina, come fino a ieri gli uomini erano avantaggiati perchè avevano il pene.",0,1417203205,null,0,1417213905,0,cmfhjbc,t3_2nod8n,t1_cmfhjbc,t3_2nod8n,null,1425799199,0,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,0

One interesting thing your post made me think of... my partner's mom was appalled that I hadn't heard of Noam Chomsky, so she mailed me his ""On Grammar"" from Amazon. Haha... 'educating' me. Anyway, his theory was that the reason we learn languages so easily as children, is because we have a built in brain structure specifically for dealing with this style of communication... kind of like how we have a special part of the brain specifically for recognizing faces. (As a CS guy who's spent a little time with image processing and basic image recognition, recognizing faces from different angles is a complicated fucking problem, cool that babies can do it straight out of the box, so to speak). 

Anyway, if our brains are specifically pre-programmed to understand languages, then it stands to reason that it would only work with a certain subset of possible languages. Meaning that in theory, it's possible to come up with a completely logically consistent language that would be alien enough from all other human languages that it's impossible to learn through anything other than rote memorization. It'd be fun to talk to an actual linguist sometime who knows something about this sort of thing... I tried asking/searching in /r/linguists, but couldn't find anything relevant. It'd be cool though if the con-lang people have accidentally stumbled on any borderline unlearnable languages. 

Anyway... I'm only 1 week into my little German experiment, but it looks like it's really not going to be all that rough.

It is a fantasy that someone will come and magically make everything alright. Some also wish they had a monarchy led by Jesus himself. Welpz. And yeah, he was patronizing. I do not hold a grudge, though.

It's the 6th richest country (and all projections put it higher in the years to come), it has a permanent seat on the UNSC, it has the second-most powerful military in NATO, it's ranked #1 on the planet for soft power, it has the world's premier financial centre, its language is the lingua franca for business and legal, it has massive cultural capital, I could go on.

Okay, perhaps ""minor"" was an overstatement. I did not ""relegate it to nothingness"" either. But certainly UK has much less clout than China, USA, EU or even Russia.

About two weeks ago I made a few very simply quick graphs using the data above with numbers for those in favour of staying versus those in favour of leaving. 

I had to have only numbers for the dates, no slashes and no letters so I figured the easiest way was to assign each week with a consecutive number. It looks unreadable but there is a key to understand it. 0 = the first week in February and 87 = the third week of November.

As Rottermund claims, Swedish invaders robbed the Commonwealth of its most important riches, and most of the stolen items never returned to Poland.[8] Warsaw, the capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, was completely destroyed by the Swedes, and out of a pre-war population of 20,000, only 2,000 remained in the city after the war.[9] According to the 2012 Polish estimates, financial losses of Poland are estimated at 4 billion zlotys.

Nobody disputes that UK is a great addition to the EU. Frankly, I'd rather it stayed and not leave us with all the other lemmings.

I think its a Masters thesis.  The interesting thing is that for most cities it shows metros or trains (NYC you can see the subway and the MTA railways) but not busses. For some reason, though, in Madrid he's only got a feed on the busses, I thought it was crazy to see how many there were, all moving at once, thought you guys would dig it.

As to your question, obviously he's pulling data from some public or pseudopublic EMT API. There is at least an API that developers can use to get the waiting times for a given station, since there are third party mobile apps that do that. All of the EMT busses have GPS (which is where that wait time info comes from in the first place). Not sure that there public API allows you to access exact location info, or if he is somehow backing it out from the wait time info (which I think includes meters).

Wild west liberalism has its appeals aswell. Higher wage inequality means that most middle to high income earners will be taking home millions/year, whereas that might not be the case in a ""regulated"" wage environment such as Germany let's say.

Where social market economies win imo is at a fairer competition in capitalism.

&gt; Au départ, 8 jeunes âgés de 22 à 29 ans.

Déjà, se qualifier de « jeune™ » aujourd'hui, c'est commencer par s'autoflageller, en utilisant un qualificatif complètement **vide de sens**. Tu es « jeune™ » ? Sérieusement ? À 22 ans ? À 29 ans ?! À 29 ans, mon grand-père commençait la guerre d'Algérie, après avoir libéré, 10 ans plus tôt, la poche de Saint-Nazaire avec les FFI. Et tu fais quoi dans la vie à part être « jeune™ » ? Ouvrier ou trader ? Accessoirement, l'invention de la classe des « jeunes™ » est l'oeuvre même de ceux qui sont responsables de cette « défiance des Français envers la classe politique ».

&gt; La génération née entre le début des années 1980 et la fin des années 1990. Son nom aurait été inspiré par la forme des écouteurs de mp3. Ultra connectée, cette génération a connu de formidables avancées technologiques, a grandi avec la citoyenneté européenne, l'hyper communication, la mondialisation, mais aussi la guerre contre le terrorisme, le dérèglement climatique et la stagnation économique. De manière générale, la génération y est plus diplômée que les précédentes mais vit moins confortablement. Aidée par les réseaux sociaux, elle prend part à des actions de masse qui dépassent la verticalité classique de notre modèle démocratique.

Primo : je sais que ça s'adresse aux Français mais a-t-on vraiment besoin de forger un terme pour désigner une frange de la population mondiale aussi insignifiante, quantitativement, que celle née entre le début des années 1980 et la fin des années 1990 dans les démocraties occidentales ? C'est quoi, 5 % de la population mondiale ? À force de se regarder le trou de balle entre deux « mp3 », on finit, malgré sa soi-disant connexion au monde entier... par oublier le reste du monde.

Secondo : le terme de « génération Y » est utilisé ici par pure démagogie, afin de susciter un narcissisme de masse de la part des utilisateurs principaux des réseaux sociaux, les jeunes™. La page d'accueil, logo compris, est un monument de crétinerie. Les problèmes évoqués sur le site concernent le peuple tout entier, ma mère de 60 ans qui a du mal à consulter ses emails, autant que Brice-Hugo, designer de cupcakes à Versailles et internaute ultraconnecté. Aucune valeur ajoutée dans la mention de la « génération Y », à part provoquer une sensation d'appartenance à une « génération qui va tout changer » chez le jeune™ moyen, afin que celui-ci « partage ». Franchement : c'est sérieux le coup des réseaux sociaux, ou c'est une parodie ? Je me dois de citer ce passage encore une fois, en gras : « **Aidée par les réseaux sociaux, elle prend part à des actions de masse qui dépassent la verticalité classique de notre modèle démocratique.** » Tu parles des apéros géants ou de l'Ice Bucket challenge, là ? Quand tu seras au chômage parce que personne ne voudra de ton bac +5, tu vas la sentir profond, la verticalité, et c'est pas 10 000 likes qui feront bouffer tes gosses. Facebook n'a pas sauvé la Grèce. Si tu es naïf au point de tenter, encore, de te persuader que mettre ton site sur Github est une initiative qui participe au changement de la face du monde, éventuellement, fais une interface web moderne pour une AMAP locale...

false,CieloRoto,GERM,Germany,"Impossible to answer because there are a thousand different definitions of the term 'democratic'. The term in its broadest sense can basically just mean a majority rule. Other definitions might include rule of law, minority rights, human rights etc etc.

That issue aside it is still hard to say whether the EU is undemocratic or not. Some say it cannot be democratic because it lacks a real populace (with a shared identity as Europeans). This could be changed mainly if we would a) adopt a common language and b) had a shared public (especially media system).

Other critics aim for the institutions. Only the European Parliament is dependent on a direct vote from the citizens. The EP has limited power though (although its position was strengthend with the Lisabon treaty). The big decisions are made by the European Council and the European Commission. Both have a democratic legitimization, albeit an indirect one. The Council is compromised of the (nationally) elected leaders of the member states and the Commission needs (de facto) approval of the Parliament.

Another point is that the European Union can (in some areas) overrule laws of national parliaments, which is often seen as undemocratic. Then again all competences were transferred to the Union by democratically elected governments.

What it boils down to: Most people label the EU as undemocratic if decisions are made that they personally dislike. ",0,1417213949,null,0,false,0,cmfmjbt,t3_2npanp,t1_cmfmjbt,t3_2npanp,null,1425796866,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

In 1815 we became a kingdom, before we where a republic with the Wilhelmus as the anthem, but there where some problems with that, as the liberation of the Netherlands from Spain was entangled in religious conflict, and in 1815 Belgium was largely still catholic (and then part of the Netherlands) and the north was protestant as well as Wilhelmus was (well sort of he was born protestant, became catholic when he served under Spain, and protestant when he fought against Spain). 

So they replaced it to this one for a few decades to please the Belgian, and because the anthem was used by the side that opposed a kingdom. Or at least their supporters.

Only the marriage with Belgium didn't last long and they left us in an uprising. (funny as of today the debate is alive again to or not to add Vlaanderen (north Belgium) to the Netherlands again if Belgium would fall apart, and the south to France.

&gt;The F-35 deserves a lot of praise but it did receive a lot of criticism.

And in my opinion none of it was very well founded. The problems the program experienced were no different than problems every procurement program experienced. It was just another case of the media playing the public for ratings and viewers.

Short quip from longer, more detailed post --&gt; [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2n0osf/f35_fighter_confounds_critics_with_perfect/cm9gr67) In short the F-35/22 isn't just upping the game, it is changing it. 

&gt; 'Old' Philosophy:
&gt;  
&gt; * One that requires joint-operational cohesion between dedicated electronic warfare units, surveillance units, relay and intelligence units, air-support units, long range engagement units (USS  Ticonderoga Class Cruisers / Arleigh Burke Destroyers), and finally engagement units - where the term 'units' represents air-frames, or squadrens.  These units work together to gain air-supremacy first to enable complementary aircraft to fly unimpeded and further the tactical advantage.
&gt; 
&gt; 'New' Philosophy: 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; *  While comparatively F-22/35s can fly overhead deep into enemy territory, serve as secure relay nodes sending back high-detail imagery of area in real time, jam enemy radar/weaponry, and engage from a distance of kilometers to several miles.

Well I for one very much doubt that. Also very few market analysts actually propose that as the reason. The market dynamic is more interesting than that oversimplification. (Besides: If the US actually wanted to collapse the oil price all they'd need to do is start exporting it or selling it from their strategic reserves.)

OPEC did what many expected: nothing. And they did that because there is *little they could have done*. OPEC does not have the leverage to balance the market they used to have. 

So, instead of manipulating prices they wisely left it to the market to balance itself. Deciding otherwise would have been kicking against the pricks. The market has changed - big reason being technological advancements.

“OPEC has chosen to abdicate its role as a swing producer, leaving it to the market to decide what the oil price should be,” Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets at BNP Paribas SA in London, said yesterday by phone. “It wouldn’t be surprising if Brent starts testing $70.” 
&gt;
“The question is, what price level will be low enough to slow U.S. production growth?” Torbjoern Kjus, an analyst at DNB ASA, Norway’s biggest bank, said by phone. “What price will get U.S. growth to slow to 500,000 barrels a day from this year’s rate of 1.4 million barrels?”

Influential organs include the commission, the council and as a separate entity separated from the commission, the foreign affairs department. 

Last named is just all ministers of foreign affairs and defense, so those are as democratic as their memberstates since they ""elect"" them. 

The council consists of 28 heads of states(government for the monarchs) and an indirectly elected president of the council. Again, it's as democratic as it's memberstates are. 

The parliament is of course directly elected by the citizens, is it democratic? certainly. 

Is the commission democratic? Well, the presidential candidate is brought forward by (one of) the largest fractions in the EP, the council then needs a qualified majority to give him green light for the forming process, every member state will then present their candidate for the commission, the president creates a commission with all 28 candidates, makes a plan, and needs a majority in parliament to start it's term. 

During that term the parliament has about the same capabilities and rights as any national parliament, they can break the commission if they no longer have trust, they get to vote for there ideas, they get to present ideas, debate about decisions etc. 

Is the EU democratic? Without a single doubt. Still the matter in which it's democratic is debatable, but I would like a more specifik aproach if you wish to discus that.",0,1417215920,null,0,1417216327,0,cmfnf7f,t3_2npanp,t1_cmfnf7f,t3_2npanp,null,1425796430,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

Although you could argue whether this referendum (should it be legally binding, which it isn't) really affects the quality of homosexuals' lives more than my example **does** affect the quality of those weirdos' lives.

&amp;nbsp;

As I understand the questions, a let's-call-it-negative result would mean that gay marriage can't be called *marriage*. So? An orange can't be called an apple aswell and nobody's rioting. Who's to say we can't define marriage (a subset of *partnership*) as the traditional relationship and call the gay marriage something else? I'm sure a mutually acceptable definition could be found easily if both parties were just arguing semantics and the law was adjusted so that the newly named *partnership* would have similar/equal rights as marriage. Theoretically speaking, the first question shouldn't pose a problem.  
The second question... I won't even pretend to know enough psychology to advocate for, or against, same sex couples rising children. This I could see as a quality of life issue, but keep in mind there are other people who are not allowed to adopt children too. Also, every piece of gay propaganda(excuse my choice of expression, I don't mean it negatively, just can't think of a better fitting word) I've heard so far, said that the right to adopt a child is not something they fight for.  
The third question... This affecting quality of life can't be argued against, I think. But it was ruled unconstitutional by the Constitutional court and there you have it, democracy and human rights protection in perfect harmony.  
The fourth question is just silly, and doesn't really affect anything anyways. Apart from maybe the child's quality of life, which is a debate for another topic.

Most Baltics Germans fled during WWII along tens of thousands of natives due to Soviet occupation.

The big picture that you miss out on is that this will transform Piraeus port into one of Europe's biggest shipping hubs and create around 10-20,000 jobs in the local area. 

There is absolutely nothing wrong with selling state assests for cheaper than ""value"" as long as the buyer agrees to invest enormous amounts of money. Another example is the old Athens airport property that just got sold for around 1 billion but was valued at 2-3 billion. 

Yes, it sold cheaper than the government wanted but the Buyers have agreed to invest 10 billion$ to transform the property into a World-wide tourist destination, it will create 50-70,000 jobs(google it)

To put it simply, without this 300 million$ piraeus deal, the port would be not even the Top 50 most important European ports and that would never change. 

This deal not only transforms Piraeus into the Top 5 most important/active ports in the EU, this deal also came along with around 10-20 billion$ in other ""friendly"" deals between China-Greece including billions of $ worth of Greek food/wine/minerals to be shipped to China and also a massive tourism push in China to promote Greek tourism with the goal to bring in around 3-5 million chinese every year by 2030.

What if a country is overwhelmed by millions of people looking for a better life, its social net collapsing? What if the new immigrants fail to assimilate and form ethnic enclaves? What if they commit a disproportionate amount of crime, creating tension that leads to violence? What if they discourage proper immigration procedures in lou of just heading there?

I was making a point about the hand-wavy way you guys argue, but I guess it went over your head. 

&gt; What if the immigrants have a criminal history?

That's already covered by existing laws. Therefore this is not really the problem you guys have with immigrants. 

&gt; What if they work illegally to lower the average wage (more workers = less value)

That's true, but that's a problem with the economic system in general. If they don't come to your country, they'll stay where they are, which will make the products from that country cheaper, which will mean your country will have to lower wages anyway to compete internationally. So, this is not a problem you can solve by denying them entry. 

&gt;  What if they don't pay taxes, or if they get injured and don't have insurance?

Same thing that happens to non-immigrants? How is that a immigration-specific issue?

&gt; What if a country is overwhelmed by millions of people looking for a better life, its social net collapsing?

We'll do something about it when/if it becomes plausible? The prospect of what you describe is so hypothetical and far-removed from reality, it's hardly worth considering. This is the type of thinking that I was making fun of with my comment earlier. You're making a series of assumptions which sum up to ""immigrants are dead weight and they'll sink us"" which is frankly ridiculous. 

&gt; What if the new immigrants fail to assimilate and form ethnic enclaves?

The word assimilate if pretty patronising. Cultures are not the borg. If they form ""ethnic enclaves"" then the country in question should try to find ways to help the various subgroups of the population to come closer. 

&gt; What if they commit a disproportionate amount of crime, creating tension that leads to violence?

This statistical nonsense is hilarious. You can say that about any sub-group of the population. What if men commit a disproportionate amount of crime? What should be done in that case? Choose carefully...


&gt; What if they discourage proper immigration procedures in lou of just heading there

Your arguments become more nonsensical 

&gt; By the way, I'm not opposed to immigration. I'm opposed to illegal immigration. Are you arguing for open borders? Because that's the only way illegal immigration will only become immigration. 

It's funny how all of you guys use the style of argumentation, down to the very words. You have learned these tricks well. Too bad they're getting repetitive. 

Step 1: You pretend to take a moderate position. ""I'm not against all immigration"" you say even though you whine and moan about all immigration and want to reduce it to a trickle or even deport people who have already lived in the country for years. 

Step 2: You accuse your opponent to have an extreme position ""Are you one of those hippie open borders people? That's crazytalk, how dare you propose such insane things"". 

PS: Don't forget to say something about commies and cultural marxists! Or is that no longer considered ""a little extreme"" for the mainstream audience you're trying to target? ",0,1417228481,null,0,1417228705,0,cmfssoa,t3_2nnvr1,t1_cmfssoa,t1_cmfqc4k,null,1425793866,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

If people are as disconnected from reality in your country as you are, it might end up a poor, perpetually wrecked economic nation that has to be constantly bailed out by Germany and has one of the most prominent right-wing groups in Europe. The thing about this is how, even when we spoke before, i warned you to address the concerns of the common people to prevent this. That's how these groups arise: when people like you deny ""illegal"" immigration is an issue, and make absurd claims, not solving the ""non-issue"" between your parties and within your system. But, oh well, people are all crazy and ""extreme"" for demanding actions to problems you claim don't exist ( illegal immigration is not an issue for you). Maybe you should consider acting on these problems before your political enemies do.

&gt;That's already covered by existing laws. Therefore this is not really the problem you guys have with immigrants. 

It is if they are illegal and undocumented.

En gros, il dit ce qui aurait dû être répété en 1992 : une monnaie commune, ça veut dire la fédéralisation et la perte de souveraineté sans contrepartie pour les pays riches qui doivent donc exporter leurs chômeurs vers les zones de moindre chômage, voire baisser les salaires, leur fiscalité et leur protection sociale pour se mettre au niveau des autres, et surtout payer pour les régions pauvres, sans oublier le mot magique ""flexibiliser leurs économies"". Dans l'idéal, ça voudrait dire que n'importe européen qui doit pouvoir aller dans n'importe quel autre pays européen, au mépris des différences culturelles et de l'attachement à sa région.

L'Allemagne doit payer, elle doit payer pour tout le monde et accepter les eurobonds, mais elle ne le fera pas. L'euro est donc mort.

Le passage de synthèse est [cette question](http://youtu.be/4JxMhLR9Kr4?t=52m1s) et la réponse de Draghi (de 52' à 57'). C'est un très bon pédagogue. Sa conclusion est la suivante : Tant qu'un pays de la zone euro n'est pas compétitif avec les autres de la zone, ses salaires doivent baisser (dévaluation interne). C'est mathématique de toute façon, je ne comprends pas pourquoi les europhiles de gauche continuent de refuser l'évidence : au sein de la zone euro, tous les pays sont des concurrents qui doivent se battre entre eux pour être le plus compétitif.

Illegal immigration is a symptom of a wider problem. The same argument that applies to illegal drugs should apply to immigration: legalise it because people will do it either way. Sure, you can regulate it and place limits and whatnot but a the end of the day you have to allow fundamentally people to move countries.

&gt; So simple, yet so over your head. How is distinguishing between them a trick? Surely you must have known this. No human being could be so willfully obtuse.

Ad hominem, ad hominem, ad hominem. 

&gt; If people are as disconnected from reality in your country as you are, it might end up a poor, perpetually wrecked economic nation that has to be constantly bailed out by Germany and has one of the most prominent right-wing groups in Europe.

Racist ad hominem. 

&gt; illegal immigration is not an issue for you

Strawman. It is an issue for me. It's just that I approach immigrants as human beings and not as parasites. 

&gt; It is if they are illegal and undocumented. [...] Illegal. And. Undocumented. 

These cases would still fall under the same regulation. Deporting immigrants to fix untaxed labour is like cutting off your head to fix a headache.

Should we legalize murder and rape since it will happen anyway? I understand that its a cause of a problem, but it also is a problem in itself. If a large portion of people moved to a country in a short period of time, it would cause all the problems i mentioned in my earlier post due to them being undocumented and outside the system, as well as the sheer magnitude.

&gt;Sure, you can regulate it and place limits and whatnot but a the end of the day you have to allow fundamentally people to move countries.

You can't just state something of this magnitude as a simple fact of life. A country does not ""have"" to do anything that its people are not in favor of doing. Why do you believe this? In a world so fucked up as this one, with such atrocities occurring every day, why do you believe in this as an inherent human right? If the people don't want massive illegal immigration, then the government should, being the voice of the people, obey. All of our basic rights are written in pen but protected by force. 

&gt;Ad hominem, ad hominem, ad hominem. 

Just drilling the distinction through. I am a child of legal immigrants, so it would not make sense for me to hate other immigrants, though it is an issue if they come illegally.

What about that was racist? A little below the belt, but that's how you came at me.

You mentioned it was a non-issue, and dismiss those who point it out as having no basis in reality. Where did i ever mention that they were parasites? They are people trying to get by, but if I'm a leader of a country, I'm looking out for my citizens first. I will not destroy my country by taking the weight of the world on my shoulder, especially if it has its own problem. I do not oppose temporary refugee status and humanitarian aid.

He fled the country. With $100 Billion. Illegally. 

There's a warrant for his trial in the Supreme Court, to go through the legal process. But he fled to Russia and obtained Russian citizenship. Illegally. 

You know what's also illegal in Ukrainian Penal Code/Constitution? Stealing 2 national budgets worth of money from the Gov and fleeing to Russia. 

&gt; The decision on the removal of the President of Ukraine from office by the procedure of impeachment is adopted by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine by no less than three-quarters of its constitutional composition, after the review of the case by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine and the receipt of its opinion on the observance of the constitutional procedure of investigation and consideration of the case of impeachment, and the receipt of the opinion of the Supreme Court of Ukraine to the effect that the acts, of which the President of Ukraine is accused, contain elements of state treason or other crime. 

He did all of that. And the Rada followed protocol. *But he fled to Russia. You can't hold a court case across international borders*. 

Please go back to /r/russia and spread your love for Yanukovych there. And don't fucking condescendingly teach me about my own fucking constitution, you babbling idiot.

Di quanto tu dici a parte i tre account... personalmente mi sono stancato di leggere di dati e statistiche, argomentazioni con dati; ragazzi qui non è la teoria o i numeri che fanno fede ma i reali accadimenti, i fatti veri che accadono, altro che balle. Chiaramente valutando di caso in caso... Ritengo che la violenza in generale sia sulle donne che sugli uomini nell'ambito domestico sia una cosa seria, da condannare in ogni caso, non ho mai detto il contrario, ma e ripeto ma, la violenza sulla donna è più ""visibile"" di quella fatta sull'uomo.
Molte volte si vedono uomini che ""di colpo vanno via di testa"" e sterminano la loro famiglia, altri che di colpo uccidono la moglie e o la compagna... si è mai pensato che in parte, questi atti possono essere la reazione ad una lunga violenza psicologica subita? Condanno la violenza fisica sulle donne, ma facciamo anche una riflessione sulla violenza psicologica sugli uomini che ""non si vede"" ma che è a suo modo devastante. Chi non mette in atto una violenza fisica, può metterne in atto una psicologica che poi può essere ""un'arma"" a doppio taglio... dando come risposta una violenza fisica.
Non è mai stata mia intenzione sminuire la violenza sulle donne, anzi, io la condanno per primo, ma la mia domanda iniziale era questa: ""Perché non si parla mai della violenza sugli uomini?"".

Fair enough.

As a greedy evil westerner, why should i not care that illegal immigration is harming my country? Why is that not a problem? So dismissive towards the ethnic population. Does Greece, despite all its problems, have a moral duty to take in more refugees who will drain limited resources and probably lack jobs? This is truly the age of blind idealism.

It was a figure or speech, meant to emulate the argument about the legalisation of drugs. I didn't literally mean that ""if people will do X anyways, legalise it"". The people who want drug legalisation also don't mean that murder should be legalised. 

&gt; Keeping out a flood of people seeking to escape to your community

Are you crazy? A flood? They haven't caused any non-negligible economic problems and there aren't that many of them. Exaggeration is your argument of choice but it's weak. 

&gt; You COMPLETELY missed the point of that. 

You wrote, and I quote: ""So simple, yet so over your head. How is distinguishing between them a trick? Surely you must have known this. No human being could be so willfully obtuse."" This is the definition of an ad hominem if I ever saw one. Maybe there is an argument hidden somewhere there but you spent 90% of your words belittling me. 

&gt;  illegal immigration is harming my country?

Because the cost is negligible or non-existent. The same reason you don't make a big deal about any other phenomenon that is a net positive or a small net negative. 

&gt; Does Greece, despite all its problems, have a moral duty to take in more refugees who will drain limited resources and probably lack jobs? 

That's a disingenuous argument. You imply here that an economic criss is a crisis of scarcity and underproduction. But the crisis is a systemic one, there's no shortage of food production or any other resource. Greece could have taken in the refugees and probably even made a profit financially if it had a better working system and was not constrained by the eurozone's irrational policies. 

&gt; Illegal.

But my whole point is that if people are so desperate that they will try anyway, you better legalise it and make the best out of the situation. The money spent trying to keep everyone out would be better spent creating a more permissive process for immigration. 

&gt; Not hordes of refugees and illegal immigrants. 

There are no hordes, it's an exaggeration. Sure, there is an increase in immigrants because of wars in other countries. But hordes? Hardly.

How is that exactly? How is this different from any other supply/demand problem?

Why would they do that when they can have their friends the Saudis do it for them? Besides this way the have probable deniability.

&gt;OPEC did what many expected: nothing. And they did that because there is little they could have done. OPEC does not have the leverage to balance the market they used to have.

OPEC did what the Saudis wanted it do to. The other nations can't force Saudi Arabia to cut its output to bring the price higher if they Saudis' don't want that and neither Russia, Iran or Venezuela can afford to cut output themselves because they need all the money they can get.

&gt;So, instead of manipulating prices they wisely left it to the market to balance itself. Deciding otherwise would have been kicking against the pricks. The market has changed - big reason being technological advancements.

Oh yeah and if you believe that I have a bridge to nowhere to sell to you.

Oversupply is oversupply regardless of where it comes from. As I've already said Saudi Arabia isn't doing it solely to stick it to Russia, they are doing it to drive the shale oil produces into bankruptcy.

&gt;This is an unmitigated disaster for the other oil producers of the world as they no longer control the price of oil -- with the US starting to end imports, they are losing what was once the biggest source of demand.

Saudi Arabia can afford to keep prices so low for a long time, I've seen a report that said they have enough money to keep oil at $60 for **decades**. Russia, Iran, Venezuela or the US shale oil companies don't have the luxury.

&gt;Of course, this leads to conspiracy theories that the US is destroyIng Russia deliberately by crashing oil prices, except this again makes no sense. The US has no state oil company and the US government has no control over extraction rates. The land is privately owned and the production is privately conducted. They're capitalists, and they answer solely to their shareholders. And those shareholders couldn't care less about some ""great game"" between the US and Russia; they just want to do what is most profitable for them.

Which is why the US has the Saudis do it for them.

&gt; The break-even prices in shale are actually lower than most traditional sources today, so forcing cuts seems unlikely though.

People get overly hung up on the latter word, forgetting that it is only a procedural mechanism to achieve the former.

This explained, we can tackle the real objection to the increasing using of democratic mechanisms in the EU: they don't represent!

The very core of representative democracy is the the principle of free association, where we collectively assent to common rule, and agree to be bound by acts taken in your name, even if you preferred person doesn't get in.

We assent and agree because we recognise that we share sufficiently convergent and compatible aims and expectations that common  actions will result in a stronger result that on balance betters achieves those goals, rather than a lowest common denominator compromise that please no one.

This is where a supranational EUrope (rather than the intergovernmental EEC we thought we joined), fails; for many people do [not] recognise a sufficiently convergent and compatible aims and expectations to assent to common rule, and thus will [not] agree to be bound by acts taken in their name.

I am one of them. Thus i see these EU democratic mechanisms - with the implied legitimacy to EU rule - as a threat to good governance, leading to a reduced welfare and wellbeing for [all] the peoples of europe.

This is not to say that i do not see the benefit of freely cooperating and collaborating nations in europe seeking common goals where it is desirable. I absolutely do, but the key words there are ""freely"" and ""desirable"".

Does anyone think that capping bankers pay is something britain considers desirable and would freely enter into of its own accord...?

Just my thoughts. That won't stop people from elsewhere in the EU from moving to the UK and working there. However, it'll be a serious disincentive against them paying British National Insurance and taxes. If this is made real, I'd expect a surge in Irish temp agencies ""sending"" workers from elsewhere in the EU to work ""temporarily"" in the UK. And that's just a loophole that comes to mind. The result will be to undermine social security and tax collection. Which of course may be the whole point of the exercise...

false,rewboss,advanced,advanced,"""Eselsbrücke"" has an interesting history that goes all the way back to Pliny. There was at the time a sort of folk myth that a donkey would not cross a bridge if it could see water between the planks. In the 18th century, German academics originally adopted this term to mean something that would actually *prevent* a scholar from making a connection, but has changed its meaning since.

""Not all cups in the cupboard"" is just a term that indicates incompleteness and lack -- a metaphor for a lack of sanity. English has a wealth of similar expressions all with the same basic idea: ""Not all there"", ""One sandwich short of a picnic"" (and any number of often imaginative expressions of the form ""One X short of a Y"") and, in Britain, ""Not the full shilling"" (a shilling being a pre-decimal unit of currency).

""Male cat"", of course, translates into German as ""Kater"", which is also the word for a hangover; so offering the sufferer an aspirin is the correct response. There's a popular myth that ""Kater"" meaning ""hangover"" has to do with catarrh. In fact, it was the name of a beer popular with 19th century students in Leipzig, so called because if you drank too much of it, the next morning it would be clawing around inside your head.

""Vögeln"" is a slight mystery, but it may be etymologically related to ""ficken"". It seems originally only to have been used when talking about birds.

""Nett ist der kleine Bruder von Scheiße"" is an accusation of damning with faint praise. If you say something is ""nice"", that's just one step away from saying it's crap.",0,1417258060,null,0,false,0,cmg1l1o,t3_2nqvnq,t1_cmg1l1o,t3_2nqvnq,null,1425771978,5,false,German,t5_2qq51,5

When I was not on the football field of my local amateur club, I played football right behind our block of flats. There was a stretchy, grassy backyard and we used tiny poles as goal markings.

&gt; What are characteristics of the surroundings?

Well, there was almost no direct sun, even in the summer, because of the houses. These houses were seperated by a small, stretchy land of green. All flats had balconies, so this was the emergeny entry for firefighters. We also played *ueber bande*, so the ball would be cushioned against the houses' walls. This often led to disgruntled neighbours shouting from their windows, but we didn't care.

Most of the tenants were really friendly though and did not care about kids playing.

There was just illegitimate power grab by some EU politicians, hopefully by the next elections they will once again follow the treaty and we don't have to deal with this kind of undemocratic power grab. Or better yet, have direct democratic elections for the presidency.

Yes, there was a new treaty in 2009 and this year was the first to follow that new treaty. It wasn't any power grab. The treaty says the council must nominate a POTEC by taking into account the election result. They did by choosing the largest group's spitzenkandidat as the first to find a majority in the EP. I doubt there will ever be direct elections for the presidency because most member states have parliamentary systems.

&gt; But they can't, that's the whole point. He is this completely removed figure who carries no accountability. Most voters do not even know which EP party their candidate belongs to, let alone who that party's presidential candidate is. And even if they did, it is very, very unlikely that it would hold any significance for them. That's why the system is not really democratic, in a democratic system the people in power must be directly accountable to the voters, which Juncker is not.

Of course they can. Both EPP and S&amp;D nominated their spitzenkandidaten way in advance and all voters could have made a choice based on that nomination. If EPP does not gain a plurality in 2019, its spitzenkandidat will not get the first try at forming a majority. If Juncker runs again, all voters need to do to get rid of him is not vote EPP.

Quote from [Wiki: War crimes of the Wehrmacht](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_of_the_Wehrmacht#Mass_rapes):
&gt; In October 1940 the laws on rape were changed, making it a ""petitioned crime"" – that is a crime for which punishment had to be requested. Historian Christa Paul writes that this resulted in ""a nearly complete absence of prosecution and punishment for rape"".[73] There were rape cases in the east where the perpetrators were sentenced if the rape was highly visible, damaging to the image of the German Army and the courts were willing to pass a condemning verdict against the accused.[73]

&gt; According to the historian Regina Mühlhäuser the Wehrmacht also used sexual torture and undressing in numerous cases of interrogations.[74]

&gt; Estimates regarding the rape of Soviet women by the Wehrmacht reached up to 10,000,000 cases, with between 750,000 and 1,000,000 children born as a result.[73][75][76][77]

It doesn't.

Taxes, budgets, national systems of law, consumer rights et cetera are still very, very different among the member states. And the difference becomes even greater looking at welfare.

The UKIP motto ""taking back our country"" is nothing more than populist drivel. The UK is free to adopt new welfare or tax laws and the House of Commons still has the power of the purse nowadays like it did 50 or 100 years ago.

France has gay marriage, does Italy? Germany just approved new rental price limits, go hop over the border and see if the Netherlands has that... The whole tax haven debate is another point in favour of my argument.

Practical differences can be seen in all aspects of life. Rented apartments in Spain usually have furniture, in Germany they don't while in the Netherlands it's common for student flats to have ""inclusive"" prices meaning water/electricity/heat and often even internet are all included. Meanwhile in Belgium there is a quasi landline internet monopoly by the state-owned provider Belgacom. Organisation of pretty much everything is still very different among all our countries.

No, non ti preoccupare. Scusa me se ti sono sembrato un po' aggressivo. Il mio vocabolario inglese è limitato e vengo su reddit anche ""to improve my english skills"".

Quello che intendevo dire è che noi italiani siamo coscienti della visione un po' stereotipata e antiquata che hanno di noi all'estero, e nonostante a volte ci faccia divertire (mi sono piaciute le puntate ""italiane"" dei Simpsons e di Family Guy per esempio) o un po' indignare, alla fine ci lascia del tutto indifferenti.

D'altronde siamo campioni nel criticare il nostro stesso paese.

Partendo da questo ragionamento mi sentivo quindi di affermare che la canzone del topic non fosse né un monito per gli stranieri (""voi pensate che l'italia sia così, invece..."") né una denuncia per gli italiani (abbiamo cantanti molto più bravi e impegnati per quello). La mia idea è che sia semplicemente una presa in giro sull'abitudine tutta italiana di criticare in maniera qualunquista i problemi del paese. Infatti nonostante certi versi possano rimandare a specifici fatti di cronaca, questa canzone non cerca veri colpevoli da accusare, ma fornisce quasi una auto-assoluzione elecando una serie di -anche qua- stereotipi da discussione da bar. In genovese abbiamo un termine meraviglioso per indicare discorsi come questi: mugugnare.

**BONUS**: la correzione del post precedente:
&gt;
&gt;Senza offesa, volevo dire che gli italiani qui in Canada non sono come quelli in America. Lì sei prima americano, poi italiano. Qui noi **ci** identifichiamo di più con la nostra cultura e lingua. Studio italiano all'università perché voglio preservare quel collegamento **con i** miei nonni.
&gt; Sapevo che oggi l'Italia è più differente dell'Italia nei film, eccetera. Purtroppo ci sono tanti Americani e canadesi che non lo sapevano.

So by ""saving"" money on one high-end thing, the consumer is manipulated into spending more money than they normally would, thus actually losing money rather than saving money. The consumer is scammed, the retailer wins hands-down.

I didn't say it's not because of supply demand. In fact that *is* the reason. It was you who proposed a superfluous explanation beyond that. Which I doubt very much because: it is an unnecessary explanation, there's no evidence of it, and it doesn't reflect the developments.

&gt; Why would they do that when they can have their friends the Saudis do it for them?

Yet the Saudis haven't done ""it"". They have kept the ceiling OPEC set in 2012. It's the *market* that has changed since then - and in a very interesting way too.

Certainly, since OPEC set the ceiling in 2012 most OPEC countries have been overproducing. During the 34 months after setting the ceiling they have collectively kept to it only for four months. Four months. And that is not about Saudi Arabia but all of them including Venezuela and Iran who were happily in it planning for lavish gov budgets.

&gt; OPEC did what the Saudis wanted it do to. 

OPEC has 12 members. Saudi Arabia isn't the only country in it and was certainly not alone making the decision. In fact the decision to keep the ceiling the same was supported by many other countries. 

And Iran and Venezuela would have wanted it otherwise but their proposals of production cuts made no sense. Essentially their proposals would have ment that other OPEC countries would have been subsidising Iran's and Venezuela's government spending by willingly taking hits to their market shares. Their proposed cuts might have been a relief for Iran and Venezuela but only in short term and temporarily, and as a result everyone in OPEC would have suffered later on. 

As I already said: *There was little else OPEC could have done.*

And that's not because of some conspiracy but because *the market has changed*. It's in a new regime. And betting against it now is kicking against the pricks. 

By their decision OPEC said to the market: *Okay, we cannot set the price, YOU set the price.*

&gt; Oh yeah and if you believe that I have a bridge to nowhere to sell to you. All of a sudden Saudi Arabia find out about the wonders of free market, and it's only the most incredible miracle that right now oil prices fell and that helps both Saudi Arabia and the USA. 

I don't know what you're on about. 

&gt; I'm sure those things are not at all related, it's just an useful happenstance.

Now you are getting it! 

This has been in the making for years. Here's the biggest supply side factors in a [single graph](http://www.bloomberg.com/image/iV7u2pWKXAHE.jpg)

By looking at the graph it becomes apparent that it was only a question of when. This was also what the most far sighted analysts were saying already in 2012-13. High oil prices were encouraging investment into US tight oil accelerating its growth. And OPEC was constantly overshooting its targets.

Over time with the growing production the market balance became more and more labile. And a change on the demand side was needed to tip it over.

And then it happened. There was a slowdown in China and Asia etc. Oil prices started to decline in August because the demand side didn't grow as expected. 

No-one planned the timing. I'm sure the most insightful analysts expected it. But no single actor caused it to happen just now. Not the US gov, not the Saudis - unless one also believes they somehow convinced the Chinese gov and some other big oil consumers to slow down their economic growth.",0,1417263442,null,0,false,0,cmg2g7x,t3_2nnber,t1_cmg2g7x,t1_cmfzelc,null,1425771574,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

false,fauxgosse,FRAN,France,"&gt;By definition, EU membership cedes more sovereignty than not being a member, we're talking Norway, not currently a member, joining the EU, to do so they would have to cede sovereignty and control that is currently in their remit.

That's simply not true. 

First, there is no EU-demos so any powers given to EU institutions by a national parliament are, by definition, temporary. Member states decide to implement laws or not. Every member can leave the EU at any time and any member can choose not to implement EU directives (this happens all the time by the way, one example is Germany not implementing the data retention directive for years).

Secondly, a situation where Norway already adheres to all EU regulation while at the same time having no executive, legislative, judicial or monetary representation in Brussels, Strasbourg, Luxembourg and Frankfurt does not equal ""more sovereignty"". To say so is a joke.

&gt;clear tangible net-benefit to becoming a member, [...] that benefit [...] does not exist for the stunning success story that is Norway

The benefit might not be huge, but the disadvantages would be even smaller. The only real arguments are the special cases of oil and fishing rights. But in terms of sovereignty and political power the disadvantages are minuscule to non-existent.

&gt;For how long? The EU only reaps more power, it doesn't cede it back to states, the Union is unrecognisable now to what it was even two decades ago, where will it be in another two?

The EU by definition cannot ""reap"" any power. All power is given to it freely by each national parliament and government. Including yours. Any power can be given back to national member states. It's just that, apart from the UK, almost no national government wants to. Why else did Cameron desperately try to win Merkel over to the ""EU devolution"" side? And what was the outcome?

&gt;where will it be in another two [decades]?

Wherever the national governments/parliaments want it to be.

&gt;The Eurozone crisis has shown us what happens to national democracies when you cede your sovereignty to another entity

The Eurozone crisis has shown how bad economic policy of just a few members can almost drag a dozen other member countries into economic depression. In other words: a mixture of monetary union and political sovereignty doesn't really work. Anyone can derive their own conclusions from that observation, but your analysis is merely biased anti-EU spin.

&gt;If the EU is not open to any reform then what is it for?

The EU is constantly reforming. Just not in the direction you would like it to be. Especially the Eurozone is integrated much more tightly now than just a few years ago.

&gt;There is overwhelming support throughout the EU's population for reform, and absolutely no support for moves towards federalism

Federalism is 20-30 years away. We are currently discussing lowest common denominator projects like reform of the Maastricht criteria. Just a few weeks ago France presented a budget that pretty much ignored current rules. Your fear of federalism is, at the moment, completely unwarranted.

&gt;If I think Cameron has broken his promises or is a crap leader I can vote to get rid of him - what can I do to Juncker now that it's emerged he's corrupt as the day as long?

Where can you vote to get rid of Cameron? All you can do is vote for MPs that are for or against him. In the European Elections you vote for parties that are for or against Juncker. It just so happens that your political opinion is dominant in the UK and a minority in the EU.

For example (Präteritum):
""Ich baute ein Haus"" - ""I builded a house"". Simple just if you have something already done and it is finished. 

For example (Perfect):
""Ich habe ein Haus gebaut"" - ""I have build a house"". In the perfect you always use a ""Hilfsverb"" (don't know english word). This are mostly ""haben/sein"" and also the verb goes to the end of the sentence and goes in the Partizip II. 

What realy is important is ""Konjugieren"". That you have to learn how to build the times of verbs.

UKIP doesn't really seem to have any real policies, but their leadership is xenophobic and racist to a significant degree. 

What they are good at is using popularist rhetoric such as blaming immigrants for taking welfare benefits, while gaining positions of power and siphoning public funds into their own wallets.

Think of it this way: what would have a bigger effect on you — someone knocking you out with one punch, or someone hitting you with a spoon over your head for five years?

There's another factor to it, too: if Assange or Snowden released everything at once, the governments could analyze it and make a coherent and consistent statement. By gradually releasing data, the public can become aware of the lies and deceit — Snowden releases a document showing that Government did A; Government says ""yeah, we may have done that, but at least we didn't do B""; then Snowden releases documents showing that Government did indeed ""do B"", to which Government responds by saying ""at least we didn't do C"".

The nationality of the attackers may be relevant if it explains why no Germans have apologised to the Turkish community for the actions of their fellow countrymen.

It's a very fashionable thing at the moment to believe that since we are all ""one family"", nationality should never be an issue; but real life doesn't actually work like that, and serious problems have occurred in the past due to a failure to understand very important cultural differences. Race relations in the UK, for example, have been very difficult for this reason: the complete lack of awareness of the tensions that exist between, for example, the various African and Caribbean communities has been a serious issue that has caused a great deal of resentment and actually hampered murder investigations.

It's extremely important to guard against stereotyping; of course it is. But that's not achieved by being ""colour-blind"".

Let's see how this can play out. The victim's name was Tuğçe, which is a Turkish name; so clearly she's Turkish, or of Turkish descent. She was attacked, and died, in Germany. If that's all you know, what conclusion are you likely to jump to? I don't know about you, but to me it would look like a racially-motivated crime, even if I knew the part about how she was trying to save somebody else from a beating.

That is purposefully misleading. If the intention was that the biggest EP party's candidate gets the presidency, then that's what the treaty would say. But it does not. The Council chose Juncker because they were being blackmailed by the EP politicians threatening to deadlock the whole process and leave the EU without a functioning executive. There is absolutely nothing democratic about that, it's an illegitimate power grab. Pure and simple.

&gt;I doubt there will ever be direct elections for the presidency because most member states have parliamentary systems.

There won't because the politicians behind the power grab know they wouldn't get elected in a democratic election. Juncker wouldn't be the president if there was a democratic election.

&gt;Both EPP and S&amp;D nominated their spitzenkandidaten way in advance and all voters could have made a choice based on that nomination.

Again you're being purposefully misleading. You know full well that a minute fraction of the voters even know what spitzenkandidaten is, most have no clue what EP parties even exist or which one their candidate's party belongs to. People vote based on national parties and candidates, they are the ones with democratic accountability, Juncker has none. Juncker didn't come to my country to campaign, nor did he even bother to speak a language I can understand in the one TV ""debate"" I watched.

This is a time when EP's democratic legitimacy is already highly questionable due to the low voter turnouts, and they choose to pull political bullshit like this.

false,ZeamiEnnosuke,NRWW,Nordrhein-Westfalen,"&gt; The nationality of the attackers may be relevant if it explains why no Germans have apologised to the Turkish community for the actions of their fellow countrymen.

Why do they apologise? Did they attack her? No, it were a few persons who happen to be of some special descent nothing more. It was an action of individuals and had nothing to do with the descent of either the attacker or the vicitim. It was not a situation that arose because of cultural differences, it was a situation that arose because the attacker is an asshole.

&gt; It's a very fashionable thing at the moment to believe that since we are all ""one family"", nationality should never be an issue; but real life doesn't actually work like that, and serious problems have occurred in the past due to a failure to understand very important cultural differences. Race relations in the UK, for example, have been very difficult for this reason: the complete lack of awareness of the tensions that exist between, for example, the various African and Caribbean communities has been a serious issue that has caused a great deal of resentment and actually hampered murder investigations.

That's the thing I'm not saying that nationality or descent does not matter, I'm saying in most cases it does not matter and specially in this case it does not matter. There are cases where it does matter and than it's okay to mention it. If for example the attacker had attacked because she was of Turkish descent than it would be good and okay to mention it otherwise it has no real value.

&gt; It's extremely important to guard against stereotyping; of course it is. But that's not achieved by being ""colour-blind"".

Please tell how this case does have anything to do with stereotyping? All I can see is maybe a negative stereotyping for the attackers descent and a bit to the girls who were harassed by him. Otherwise it just shows that descent does not matter there are nice and good people everywhere.

&gt; Let's see how this can play out. The victim's name was Tuğçe, which is a Turkish name; so clearly she's Turkish, or of Turkish descent. She was attacked, and died, in Germany. If that's all you know, what conclusion are you likely to jump to? I don't know about you, but to me it would look like a racially-motivated crime, even if I knew the part about how she was trying to save somebody else from a beating. No matter how I might like to believe of myself that I am not a racist, this would inevitably be filed in my brain as an example of German xenophobia. And in this particular case, that would be wrong.

Then YOU have a problem with your thinking. If I would hear something like this without knowing the descent (which btw was the case for me, because I first heard from it in the radio where they didn't mention any descent and only the name) I would think ""poor woman and stupid arsehole who did it"" and not ""ahh that's an good example of xenophobia in Germany"".",0,1417268977,null,0,false,0,cmg3j4h,t3_2nqwfb,t1_cmg3j4h,t1_cmg377g,null,1425771070,-7,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,-7

His statement is not ridiculous at all, even if one uses definitions that would render it technically correct or incorrect. 

&gt; Shale oil extraction is much more costly than normal oil.

This statement is incorrect. The US tight oil is surpisingly competitive in its costs compared to world oil production. As has already been evidenced by its effect on the market.

Instead of going into semantics lets just look at the data (by Citigroup).

[US tight oil production break even points.](http://i.imgur.com/Olc9hs6.png)
(the graph leaves out the most expensive shales but there's only very few above 80, only about 4% IIRC)

[World oil production break even points.](http://i.imgur.com/9rcSkJj.png)

([source](http://uk.businessinsider.com/citi-breakeven-oil-production-prices-2014-11?r=US)) 

Some observations:

1. The basic reality is that *there is no single break even point*. It's a continuum for both the US tight oil and oil in general. 

2. The US tight oil production is very competitive as the break even point goes.

3. For now the oil price will balance itself somewhere on that continuum ('Gee, thank you Capn Obvious').

4. How that will affect the US tight oil remains to be seen. On the short term the lower prices will likely slow down its growth but it's very unlikely that the production would decline. And the projects that have gone even halfway though their capex cycle will continue to produce no matter how low the price gets.

Up til 1990 anyone from Eastern Europe who could claim German ancestors could automatically receive German citizenship, even if they'd never been there, and that right has been tightened but upheld in principle since. Vice versa, until the 1999 citizenship reform, it was extremely difficult for immigrants - and even difficult for children of immigrants who were born in Germany! - to receive German citizenship, even if they had lived there for decades. 

With its traditional emphasis on jus sanguinis rather than jus solis, Germany has been the classic example of defining national identity on the basis of descent rather than birth or residence for decades into the postwar era, and immigration-based communities have had a hell of a time as result to be accepted as ""Germans"". I guess your comment can be interpreted as a hopeful sign of how much things have changed in the past twenty years, but it also feels a tad hypocritical/holier-than-thou to now berate a Turkish newspapers for defining a person's identity on the basis of descent, when that was a quintessential German tradition for so long.",0,1417271751,null,0,false,0,cmg4943,t3_2nqwfb,t1_cmg4943,t1_cmg2t6a,null,1425770734,-7,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,-7

IMO this solution isn't the most humanitarian solution.

This way you would be threatening ppl like, ahm, garbage. Some of them can be criminals, but this is more of a human thing than a cultural thing. We deal with it through education. Also, there are quite a good number of immigrants who are good ppl.

&gt; Even better is building and financing and securing zones in the country they come from, to throw them back to the countries they left, but in a safe secured camp with the help they need.

No way this would help us. Why? Because it would be our taxes, our money, being spent in another country to build a (in this case almost literally) fortress. It is not the most smart way of expending money.

false,ShaunaDorothy,null,null,"Patrick Modiano, the French writer whose moody, terse and occasionally dreamlike novels are often set during the Nazi occupation of France, won the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature.   Peter Englund, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, called Mr. Modiano “a Marcel Proust of our time,” noting that his works resonate with one another thematically and are “always variations of the same thing, about memory, about loss, about identity, about seeking.”

Fans and publishers of Mr. Modiano, 69, celebrated his victory as a chance for him to finally gain international recognition for a body of work that spans nearly five decades, and as recognition of French literary glory in the tradition of fellow Nobelists Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus.  “This prize will help raise the global profile of one of our consummate writers,” said Anne Ghisoli, the director of Librairie Gallimard, a bookstore in Paris that is majority owned by Mr. Modiano’s publisher, Gallimard. “He is a master of writing on memory and occupation, which haunt and inform his work. He is a chronicler of Paris, its streets, its past and its present.”  President François Hollande congratulated Mr. Modiano, saying in a statement: “The republic is proud of the recognition, through this Nobel Prize, of one of our greatest writers. Patrick Modiano is the 15th French person to receive this eminent distinction, confirming the great influence of our literature.”

Mr. Modiano, who has published about 30 works, including novels, children’s books and screenplays, rose to prominence in 1968 with his novel, “La Place de l’Étoile.” Many of his fictional works are set in Paris during World War II, and some play with the detective genre. His works have been translated around the world, and about a dozen of his books have been translated into English. But he is not widely known outside France. One of his novels, “Missing Person,” won the prestigious Prix Goncourt in 1978, but has sold just 2,425 copies in the United States.  In France, Mr. Modiano’s books are widely read, in part because of their pithy and compact style. His most famous works include “Missing Person,” an existential thriller about a man who travels the world trying to piece together his identity; “Dora Bruder,” which investigates the disappearance of a Jewish girl in 1941; and “Out of the Dark,” a hallucinatory novel narrated by a middle-aged writer reflecting on an affair with a young drifter.

The Nobel academy was unable to reach Mr. Modiano before the announcement. During a halting, nearly hourlong news conference at Gallimard’s headquarters, Mr. Modiano said he learned he had won when his daughter called him as he was walking in the street. “I was a bit surprised, so I continued walking,” he said. He said winning the prize felt “unreal” and that he vividly remembered when Camus won the Nobel for literature in 1957. (Sartre won in 1964.) He also expressed puzzlement over being chosen. “I would like to know how they explained their choice,” he said. Mr. Modiano was born in a Paris suburb in July 1945, in the immediate aftermath of World War II. His mother, a Belgian actress, met his Jewish-Italian father during the occupation of Paris. He has typically kept a low profile, avoiding the news media.  In a 2012 interview with Le Figaro, Mr. Modiano said that he had grown more comfortable talking about himself and his books. “At the beginning, I experienced writing as a sort of constraint,” he said. “Starting so young as a writer is pitiable, it’s beyond your powers, you have to lay bare things that are very heavy, and you don’t have the means for that. When I recently looked at my early manuscripts, I was struck by the absence of space, of breathing room.”

Asked if he felt that he had evolved as a writer, he added: “No, not really. The feeling of dissatisfaction with every book remains just as alive. I had a longtime recurring dream: I dreamed that I had nothing left to write, that I was liberated. I am not, alas. I am still trying to clear the same terrain, with the feeling that I’ll never get done.”  The Nobel, one of the most prestigious and financially generous awards in the world, comes with a $1.1 million prize. The literature prize is given out for a lifetime of writing rather than for a single work.  Recent Nobel laureates in literature have included the Canadian short-story writer Alice Munro in 2013; the Chinese novelist Mo Yan in 2012; the Swedish poet Tomas Transtromer in 2011; and the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa in 2010. The last American writer to win was Toni Morrison, in 1993.

The Nobel committee has drawn criticism in the past for shunning authors whose works are widely read in favor of obscure Eurocentric writers. The selection of Ms. Munro last year was celebrated by many in the literary community as a sign that the academy was embracing more mainstream and popular authors. But in choosing Mr. Modiano, the academy seems to be shrugging off the critics.  The Nobel will surely help his sales. Mr. Modiano’s French publisher announced that the company would print an additional 100,000 copies of his books. In the United States, the small publisher David R. Godine, which has issued three of Mr. Modiano’s books, will print an additional 15,000 copies of the books. (To date, the three books — two novels and a children’s book — have collectively sold fewer than 8,000 copies in America.) After the prize was awarded, Yale University Press, which planned to publish a collection of three novellas by Mr. Modiano in February, moved the publication date of the collection to November, and increased the first printing to 20,000, up from 2,000.  Mr. Modiano, speaking at the news conference, said receiving so much attention for his work after so many decades of writing in solitude seemed “a bit unreal.”

“I have always felt,” he said, “like I’ve been writing the same book for the past 45 years.”

A boh, mai sentita, non so che dire. Direi che non è che sia proprio un fenomeno diffuso.

&gt; Forse, ma io mi riferivo a quel caso specifico. Ma il problema si può estendere come vuoi. Fra tutte le possibili divisioni (regione d'appartenenza, sesso, colore capelli, altezza, peso, religione) perché proprio il sesso deve essere la base?

Sulle regioni, boh, mi sembra che siano sempre tutte abbastanza rappresentate. Sul colore dei capelli non mi è mai parso di notare grandi discriminazioni. Sono basso, no, non credo di essere mai stato discrimato per questo, magari qualcuno molto alto? Per il peso, boh, sono un po' sovrappeso ma neppure qua mai pare di aver subito molto non mi pare che tutti quelli al potere siano dei grissini. Sono (parecchio) bianco e ateo, ma che il fatto che la religione non sia stato un problema non mi stupisce, potrebbe essere diverso avessi la carnagione più scura. Da buon ateo rompicazzo avrei anche le mie remore sulla religione, visto che è una scelta conscia dell'individuo, non una caratteristica innata (come il sesso, la razza o il luogo di provenienza). :)

Questo sproloquio per dire che secondo me non ci sono molte altre discriminazioni così rilevanti come il sesso.

Nuclear weapons were not contributor to that nor NATO alliance nor any other stuff. It is entirely on EU.

That is fallacy. EU is major contributor in new companies sturtups, innovations and other stuff where EU pays up to something like 70-90% cost depending on type and business plan. EU also contribute heavily to improvement of lesser urbanized areas in europe. Which directly translated to improvement of common wage worker.
Globalization is completely different thing and its problems aren't related to EU as source of problem. This is problem which has source in big global market as companies have means to grow beyond their original nations becoming entities with funds and means to outpace domestic competition by share size. If anything EU anti-thrust laws are #1 in world considering how they like to fine titans like MS where if you would be alone country you wouldn't be able to do anything for your people or anyone else. 

Opposite of open market is closed market and import taxes. Which never worked as good as om. Also EU does contribute to lesser competetive regions as those regions. Best case scenario was Polish apple business where in 2003 most of production was entirely low tech and now in 2014 they become #1 producer of apples in Europe along with major export (instead of internal consuption only) and most of people working in that field now earn a lot of money (i live in such area).

No we don't, free movement and work is strictly EU thing. No longer you need to have visa/passport to work somewhere else in europe and this changed a lot science field let alone business. Now it is common to start new company that will include few different nationalities without problematic paperwork and stuff.

European civic society is pipe dream of some people. EU never aspires to create unified nation because it is impossible considering how vastly different cultures are there in europe.

And then if there was a particularly strong attack, it will end up on the news.

They don't often delve too deeply into the specifics of methods, suffice to say it seems to play a part and be fairly effective

Ironically, when you think about it, surveillance is a lot less invasive that police kicking down doors, conducting searches, making arrests, interrogating witnesses and so on

Personally I do have stuff to hide, but I'm not the slightest bit worried about high-level anti-terrorist units using my private details as meta-data. I happily give enough sensitive information to corporations and private companies to worry about that. Ironically the politicians, high level police officers, government officials and diplomats have a lot more to worry about it's misuse than joe public

I would also presume they would use most of it not just for detection, but also prosecution.. they need to go through large amounts of calls/emails/data and it just seems to be the most common sense way given the current climate since 911, Madrid and 7/7

They could be more open about it though, no need to be so cloak and dagger, the Norwegians have the right way of doing it after the Breivik attack

And also why should I give any credits to young americans for this, i give it to everybody that actually fought in these wars, to your ancestors. Also the british, french and russian civilists had way more to endure in the war than american civilists, and then those who never participated in those wars think they have the right to brag. 

But you were asking about the ""Fall of the Wall"" as a single event, and you should know that a lot of germans you may talk to, may have participated or have parents or family members who participated, in the protests and risked their lives in it, it was not garanteed that they were safe in this time, then comes some foreigner and tells them something about how the USA destroyed the wall, this hurts them emotionally cause they think you want to take their achievements from them. Especially if you talk with people from east germany.

Also if you talk about the clima, that made it possible, it seems you think only america has taken part in creating it, as if creating a good relationship between russia and germany through the politics of ""Willi Brand"" and ""Helmut Kohl"" did not help to create a better clima between russia and germany and therefore the russians beeing less agressive in this case. The americans where against those actions of Brand and Kohl.....There is way more to it, then the achievements of the US in the cold war.

L'idée serait de favoriser les situations dans lesquelles les joueurs ont des buts divergents mais pas totalement opposés et dans lesquelles des alliances se fassent naturellement.

Au niveau de la résolution des actions, je vois bien deux systèmes sans jets de dé:

- pour les actions individuelles, celui de Ambre: les joueurs ont des stats, qu'ils gardent secrètes. Quand ils veulent résoudre une action, ils annoncent de combien ils veulent se dévoiler et voient si ça suffit. Par exemple je veux cacher que je suis en vérité le plus puissant mage de ma génération avec un score de 130. Face à la liche qui me menace, je dévoile un potentiel de 30. Merde, ça suffit pas et il vient de désintégrer mon cheval. Bon, on le calme à 60 alors ? Ok, ça passe.
- pour les actions de fond, un système à la Diplomacy. Si l'intrigue tourne autour de conquête militaires, c'est un jeu très simple (imagine Risk sans les dés) qui sera rendu plus ardu par le fait que les joueurs doivent se mettre d'accord et se synchroniser sur les ordres à donner. ""On doit déclarer la guerre aux Anglais ce tour-ci, pour avoir l'avantage de la surprise!"" ""Mais non voyons! Encore deux tours et on a toute l'Afrique. Avec ces ressources là nous seront invincibles!"" Ajoute à ça des événements du genre ""Un ovni vient de se poser au Mexique.

I mean, why should Mexico, Congo or India help us on this issue?  So, in the end yes, this is a problem of europeans only. But wait, this as a ""passive"" actor. Because of course there is the other side. While they live under dictatorships and such, then there will be ppl fleeing from those countries and trying to get a better life around here, which is not wrong. If you could get a better life, you would go to a place where you would get it (suppose that your country is in a civil war or civil liberties are non-existent) 

I don't care if a normal and honest person want to pursue a better life in another country. I care, on the other hand, with the same you said: violence and disease outbreaks (actually, I care more with religious fanatics - no matter the religion).

The alternative you gave I think it is more expensive and more inhuman. Let me explain:

1 - Europeans build fortress or whatever it is in, let's say, african countries. Where does this money come from? Europe. Then we put the immigrants that are here to live there. So, what will they do? They already have jobs here. It is nonsense, in my point of view, to build a city in the middle of nowhere without a natural economic flow. A region doesn't become economic attractive by magic or good will of a government.

2 - I doubt any sovereign government would want europeans to build a fortress in their countries - we are not in the age of the discoveries anymore. 

Now, here you said something I fully agree:

&gt; the solution lies in them building their countries, not fleeing them.

Imagine the entire african countries that lies in the mare nostrum (I like this name too) being as developed as Europe. Then we would not face the problems we face today. But then, this will only help with a more humanized view of the issue in question, and this is solved not by building fortress or whatever it is in their countries, this lies on helping their governments with technical support alongside economic ties. Also, imo, huge efforts in education (this is in the long term and the best solution, for me. The problem is to deal with the actual generation that have many tribesman and such) and in helping them curb corruption (although I think we must continue the efforts on this thing here too).

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Well villager, you seem to show up on just about every thread about Russia. Your arguments are alway pro Russia, you admit you delete your comment history and you are consistently denying being paid.

I used to visit this subreddit since a long time ago, and I liked it very much. I don't know what exactly happened a year or so ago, but it became too sarcastic, hostile and too much devoid of reason to my liking. It's certainly true that I turn up on a lot of Russian threads. There are two reasons for that. One is that they contain the majority of nonsense which I like to reply to. Second is that they form most of the threads together with pulp like ""look at my capital in the snow"".

The reason I delete my comments is that I do not want to be judged on things I posted in the past but on what I'm posting right now.

&gt;I am not the first person to raise the claim that you are paid. These seem like suspicious behaviors and either the views of someone being paid or an extremely partisan person. Regardless not the views that I would consider an objective bystander. You have an axe to grind.

There is some evidence that governments (Russian and otherwise) pay certain individuals to pollute the internet. However, anyone who has ever accused me of being paid did this for one reason only, comfirmation bias. If I would post something like ""Putin is God, plz Annex Ukraine"", one would instantly think I am just a poor fellow misguided by Russian propaganda. But because I sometimes manage to deconstruct certain arguments, it becomes more comfortable to blame me of being paid than having to reconsider your own beliefs. 

But in the end the truth is that, even if I am being paid, it wouldn't falsify anything I ever wrote. Only you can do that for yourself.

The reason why I do post these kinds of replies are many. The first one is the same reason anyone else posts their opinion. People like to share their insights, good ones or not, with a larger audience. It's a sort of selfishness I think. The second and main reason is that I want to learn; many replies to many posts have made me reconsider my beliefs. The third reason is that I really like to fuck with people's heads who think they own the truth. Truth is a struggle, you think you have it, and it's gone again. But if we remain in our echo box, it has grave consequences. I know full well I am not an objective bystander and I don't consider myself as such. Neither is giggster, No_KGB etc., you and everyone else here. And I like people to realize that.

Now, you might have a point that I play advocate of the devil too much. But I'm not blatantly pro Russian. For example, I have always said that the Russia should not have annexed Crimea, because it was a great catalyst for the Ukrainian civil war. I don't think that's what a pro Russian individual would write.

false,no_game_player,MOLD,Glorious Republic of Moldova,"Good question. Originally, I made the subreddit as a joke, after watching [this speech](http://webtv.un.org/search/vladimir-lupan-moldova-on-ukraine-security-council-media-stakeout-3-march-2014/3287925739001?term=moldova&amp;sort=date) live while chatting in the #UkrainianConflict IRC. It came on after the Ukrainian ambassador spoke, and everyone was like ""wait, wtf? Why is *Moldova* speaking? Why do we care?"" And he was talking about various forces being on ""high alert"" and so we were laughing about Moldova being on high alert (spoiler: he doesn't actually say that).

So then I made ""MoldovanCrisis"" as sort of a play on ""UkrainianConflict"", but obviously exaggerated. Then I started actually learning a bit more, as I sought out any Moldovan news and coverage I could find, and I learned about it really is critically important in the area, and how the situation in Ukraine really does affect it more than any other foreign nation. [This speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y1--SEVZ6I&amp;feature=share) by Iurie Leanca, then and current Prime Minister, speaking in English in Washington, D.C. during the beginning of the Crimean situation, really struck me. I gained a great sympathy for the country and admiration for the leadership.

And the name then morphed for me into sort of a journal title. I had to look it up just now; I've had a vague impression there was some sort of paper or publication by the name ""The Crisis"" like there'd been ""The Liberator"" famously (and so just now I realized that ""The Crisis"" is the NAACP journal). So I reimagined the name as being like ""The Moldovan Times"", except rather more jingoistic and sensationalistic, thus ""Moldovan Crisis"".

But to actually answer the question: the crisis is essentially exactly what is being discussed in this article. It is an historic decision between joining the European Union (and forming what I like to call 'The Moldovan Union of Europe') or going back into Russia's sphere of influence. And it's greatly complicated by, for instance, the Transnistrian situation in which Russia, to this day, has troops stationed on what is internationally recognized, including by Russia, as Moldovan soil. There has been coverage both in /r/europe and actually to a lesser extent in /r/MoldovanCrisis (because it actually seemed too extreme even for me) about the fact that there have been pro-Russian extremist groups which could attempt armed resistance if the upcoming elections on November 30th don't go the way they like.

Russia has been embargoing more and more Moldovan products as they continued with their European Perspective, starting with the wine a few years ago (and yet Russia is a major export market for their wine according to the numbers I've seen; I've never reconciled / understood that), and continuing on to fruits, meats, etc. And, of course, Russia denies that this is done for political reasons, but claims quality reasons to add insult to injury.

tl;dr: Russia

If the European economy continues to wane post-exit as it might do regardless if the UK is allowed into the EEA or not, these anti-EU nationalist parties can use that decision to allow the UK into the EEA to propel their political campaigns to victory. In reality however, this would be the beginning of the end for the European project and ultimately there would be no more single market for the UK to participate in.

So what happens if the EU disintegrates and a bunch of nationalist parties are in control in many European countries? What happens when Russia is the dominant power in Europe? These are some things I would rather not even think about.

It's incredibly ironic that the party that actually benefits from the comparatively better democratic representation in the EU is the one complaining the most about there being a democratic deficit.

Yes, however, how do you determine the difference?

&gt; 1 - Europeans build fortress or whatever it is in, let's say, african countries. Where does this money come from? Europe. Then we put the immigrants that are here to live there. So, what will they do? They already have jobs here. It is nonsense, in my point of view, to build a city in the middle of nowhere without a natural economic flow. A region doesn't become economic attractive by magic or good will of a government.

I didn't mention to throw out people that already have a citizenship or work here. Just the people that are now in refugee shelters awaiting further decision or arrive in the future.

This fortress is not eternal. People can live in a dictatorship, and civil wars don't last forever. These camps are temporarily until we can find a solution for the problem, and these people can return home. 

Protection can be done by the UN, as can help. 

&gt;  ''hey Europe, you can fix your own problems, since you are a bunch of states''.

Africa and the Middle East is as much our problem as the worlds'. It's our own problem from the moment we let an entire exodus of Africans and Easterners inside. 

&gt; 2 - I doubt any sovereign government would want europeans to build a fortress in their countries - we are not in the age of the discoveries anymore. 

Most of the countries creating this exodus of people don't even have a functioning government (Libya, Eritrea, Syria etc.) I honestly don't give a damn what one of the warlods in Libya, or Al-Assad thinks. 

&gt; this lies on helping their governments with technical support alongside economic

As long as their youth risks their lives to cross into Europe in their thousands these countries will remain a wastedump. By taking in these refugees, we strip north-Africa/M-E of their future. We also put a huge burden on our society, that is already incapable of carrying our own at this point

It's not often pointed out but there is also no *necessary* connection between EU party policy and their constituent national party policy particularly on specific EU issues. They will obviously share most economic and social policy but on issues which concern EU governance or international trade deals - things which are not necessarily party political issues - EU level parties seem to display a kind of uniformity that is not present among national parties. 

Federalism is an obvious one. Technically the EPP is a federalist party. The CDU in Germany or the UMP in France are both part of the EPP but neither openly campaign in EU elections (at least not to my knowledge) for federalism. 

If the CDU went onto the streets in Germany and said a vote for us is a vote for a Federal EU guaranteeing the debt of every Eurozone country allowing larger and constant fiscal transfers from Germany to the East and South they would lose the election because the Germany people would not be happy simply to subsidise the rest of the EU as their own expense (at least according to polling I've seen). But that is what the EPP, as a federalist party, will eventually aim to do. Now it's so far off into the distance as to seem pointless worrying about now but it seems to me that when people vote in EU elections the national party should be forced to include the policies of the EU parliamentary party in their own campaign so people really know what they are voting for otherwise it's very difficult to argue that the EPP has public consent to work towards federalist policies. I'm on the fence and I'm not opposed to a federal EU in principle but progress towards that end should never be done by exploiting a disconnect between the public and EU parties. 

The Labour party in the UK certainly never mentioned that their MEPs will be helping achieve a federal EU but they will because the socialist bloc in the EP is federalist to my knowledge or at least Martin Schultz was, things may be different now. 

The ALDE group as well is led by Guy Verhofstadt who founded the Spinelli Group which campaigns for a federal Europe. 

In fact most of the leaders of European Institutions like Schultz, Barroso and now Junker are all federalists. That kind of uniformity of opinion on a topic that really has had almost no serious discussion by most national parties especially not when campaigning in EU elections indicates there must be a disconnect at some point between the intentions of the public and the appointment of these officials.
