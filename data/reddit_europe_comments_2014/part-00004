true,TheByzantineDragon,FRIE,Fryslân (Living in Overijssel),"&gt; Although you are right about GLONASS and Compass, however I believe this was before they were implemented.

The first galileo satellite was launched in 2011, GLONASS was operational in 1995.

&gt; And we're not controlling our allies. We're influencing them.

Influencing is a whole other thing. Convincing countries to make their infrastructure vulnerable for attack takes more than 'influence'.

&gt; We're allowed to do this given the heavy role we play in Europe's defense &amp; military ability (Libya &amp; the late intervention in The Balkans would've never been possible without the United States).

Because Libya was much of threat to Europe...
And what has the Balkan got to do with this? I understand you intervened in 1998, but this is 2014. Unless another war breaks out (Not going to happen) there is no reason to keep them here. The balkan wars have nothing to do with the modern situation and are not an example of what might happen in the future.

&gt; Our assistance was also critical, although much diminished in comparison to the other two, in Mali. Because, you see, whether you like it or not, Europe can not project power against well-armed and defended foes, hence they rely on us significantly through NATO for power projection.

Mali isn't relevant here. Mali doesn't justify US troop placement in Europe. In order to get US help in Mali, their soldiers don't need to be stationed in Europe.

&gt; If you don't like this, fine. Increase military spending (even if it's at the expense of some social benefits if you are unable to handle the debt) and integrate further into the European Union militarily, as well as convincing the member states of the E.U. to adopt a Common Foreign and Defense Policy, or better than all that, create an independent E.U. military.
If you don't want to do that, and you don't want to sacrifice anything for more military spending, or if you just don't want to increase your military spending because of principle...well...stop bitching.

And you decide this? If we want no US soldiers and no EU military then that is our choice, not yours.

&gt; Because as of this moment, you are under a security umbrella funded by the United States, hence the influence we wield.

And we would shoot those Russian satellites down. If it came down to it, the United States threatened to shoot European satellites down to if we couldn't jam them.

I'm not saying I agree with this, because I don't, but I understand the logic behind it. 

&gt;Influencing is a whole other thing. Convincing countries to make their infrastructure vulnerable for attack takes more than 'influence'.

Well, when the alternative is a threat to straight-up destroy that infrastructure, I understand that logic. I don't agree or support it, but I understand it.

And I still contend this is no different than Britain's influencing of the Commonwealth or France's influencing of Françafrique. . 

&gt;Because Libya was much of threat to Europe... And what has the Balkan got to do with this? I understand you intervened in 1998, but this is 2014. Unless another war breaks out (Not going to happen) there is no reason to keep them here. The balkan wars have nothing to do with the modern situation and are not an example of what might happen in the future.

I'm not going to share my opinion on Libya, but the fact of the matter is this: Europe called for it, Europe instigated it, but Europe couldn't walk the walk after it talked the talk. 

That's my problem. 

Than you have to rely on the United States to assist you and pull the weight. Over something you called for. Than you ask why the United States has such influence over your military and defense? Because your country does shit like that. 

And you think that something like The Balkans will never, ever, happen again? Are you truly that ignorant? That's the same sort of attitude that allowed the Bosnian Genocide to happen. Jesus Christ. Are you really ignorant enough to think that ethnic tensions still don't exist in the region? Are you foolish enough to think that ethnic violence and similar incident will never, ever break out in Europe's vicinity again? Some immature shit right there. :) 

&gt;Mali isn't relevant here. Mali doesn't justify US troop placement in Europe. In order to get US help in Mali, their soldiers don't need to be stationed in Europe.

The United States was able to get help to Mali like it did *because we're stationed in Europe.* You don't quite understand how logistics work, do you? Or that Europe is closer to Mali than America is? I mean...I thought Americans were shitty at geography...but I might have that mixed up apparently.....

&gt;And you decide this? If we want no US soldiers and no EU military then that is our choice, not yours.

And you've chosen to have U.S. soliders and U.S. military bases. I don't get where you get this childish idea that we're forcing ourselves on you, that we're burning your women and raping your churches. Because we're not. Your government is letting us be there, hell, most, if not all, of the governments involved *want us there*. Because it's much easier for help with shit like Libya and Mali when we're stationed closer to Libya and Mali. Hell, many local German and British communities even prefer the United States military bases, as it gives a boost to their economies, but I admit, that's besides the point. 

Is this whole ""geography"" and ""logistics"" thing starting to make sense to you? 

If they want us to leave, and they asked us to leave, **than we would leave.** But they haven't, and I don't believe they will, because of the aforementioned examples and reasoning above. 

But..wait...do **you** specifically decide this? If your fellow citizens vote for a government which want US soldiers and no EU military then that is everybody's choice, not just yours.

&gt;An umbrella is only useful in the rain. It's completely dry here in Europe and there is no chance of any rain anytime soon.

Well good thing that Europe thinks it will never, ever rain again. And good thing Europe hasn't tried to bring it's own rain to Libya, Mali, Kosovo, CAR or the Ivory Coast. And thank god NATO and the United States military which backs it up has absolutely no effect or benefit in the European Union's negotiation with Russia over the fate of Eastern Europe. Because, you know, hard power serves absolutely no purpose what-so-ever, right? The world revolves around soft power and anything can be done with soft power...anything. That great logic. 

And the idea that a humanitarian intervention might be needed in somewhere like The Balkans, or in a region with similar circumstances? You're absolutely right. Fucking loony thought right, fit only for dumb Americans and fools.

There's also less economic incentive to automate jobs which are lowly-paid and low-skilled (especially if they're off-shore too, without labour rights) since the economic benefit will be less.

This could lead to a kind of Elysium-esque scenario of a world divided in to the terribly poor servants, working as maids, perhaps some production jobs, etc., the middle-rich technicians, and the super-rich owners of the resources and machines.

And yet we should want the automation. It should be a good thing that people needn't waste their lives sewing footballs, and driving trucks, etc. if it can be done by machine. The only problem is the madness of the wage and property system.

To quote Edward Bellamy's _Equality_:

""Tamerlane was a beast, and Arkwright was a genius sent to help men, yet the hideous juggle of the economic system made the benefactor the cause of as much human suffering as the brutal conqueror.

It's doable. But unless you got a skill in demand (essentially: IT) you will need to have at least a passable grasp of German. Just speaking English is not a qualification.  

&gt;What type of flat do you get for 300 Euros in Berlin? Is it furnished? What is the typical square area and room type? What about utilities, are they included in the rent? 

Realistically: You won't get one unless you are willing to live waaaay outside the city. For 300€ you'll be lucky to get a place in a shared apartment (and even that will be hard). All the numbers the other commenters posted here are highly theoretical. There may be flats like that, but as a student from abroad with limited funds and no secure income, speaking no German you will have to be extremely (lottery-style) lucky to get one.

* Le premier, c'est que le spectateur du JT ne ferait rien de ces informations, les chaînes parlementaires ne sont déjà pas regardées, c'est juste des bons sentiments de penser que les gens dont ce n'est pas le métier ont envie d'entendre parler des ""sujets de fond"" tous les jours. 

* Le deuxième aspect relève des mécanismes organisationnels qui régissent encore majoritairement nos sociétés. C'est à dire qu'il y a plusieurs niveaux quand on parle des sujets de fond : le contexte, ie la situation actuelle, les acteurs en présence, leurs ambitions ; les décisions, prises en cercle très restreint, pour des objectifs précis mais avec un volant assez ample de négociation ; l'exécution, c'est là où ça devient un peu le bordel puisque chacun va poursuivre son propre intérêt et l'interprétation comme la transmission comme les imperfections du système vont rendre aléatoires les actes de chacun ; les conséquences, qui incluent les actes directement liés à la décision mais aussi englobent les interactions avec d'autres milliers de décisions. Et là tu te rends bien compte des problèmes : Le journaliste n'a accès qu'au premier et au dernier échelon ( si tant est qu'il comprenne bien les conséquences, ce dont je doute ) et le reste tient de la boîte noire qu'il ne peut connaître sans grandes difficultés, il y a des milliers et des milliers de ce genre de décisions qui sont prises chaque jour et leur importance n'est pas forcément appréciée à leur juste valeur et quand les conséquences commencent à créer le besoin de savoir, plusieurs années ? après , les étapes intermédiaires ne sont définitivement plus accessibles. 

Croire qu'on peut expliquer 10% de ces choses en 3 min devant des types qui regardent le JT avec un plateau-repas, c'est touchant de naïveté, mais ce n'est pas réaliste du tout.

C'est la doctrine sociale de l'Eglise qui a permis l'émergence des droites pas trop conservatrices et non-nationalistes, la conférence dont tu as parlé est un bel exemple de la maturité du Judaïsme, on peut dire que l'Islam est dans un âge sombre mais que bientôt vont fleurir les partis ""Musulmans-Démocrates"" et les Imams diplômés dans les droits des minorités sexuelles.

Mon postulat est que, si comme tout texte, les écrits sacrés peuvent être élevés/élévateurs ou corrompus/corrupteurs, ils n'en sont pas moins des dogmes, le plus souvent universels (le seul contre exemple qui me vient en tête c'est Peuple Elu dans le Judaïsme), et basés sur des mythes. Certes avec un peu de jugeote, on ne s'enlise pas dans le dogmatisme, mais à ce moment, on fait du picorage. On peut alors institutionnaliser toute oeuvre de fiction avec un peu de profondeur sur la condition humaine.

Tu dis que la religion a été particulièrement bénéfique quand 95% de la population était analphabète. Mais comment veux-tu qu'une population ignorante rejette le dogme et embrasse un dieu métaphysique ? Il y aura toujours marginalisation des non-croyants, et souvent corruption de ses enseignements sociétaux.

Et puis tu as surtout défendu le Christianisme, et encore une fois, je suis conscient de sa spécificité. Je suis critique envers le principe de la religion, mais je crois que concrètement certaines sont plus dangereuses que d'autres. L'Islam par exemple est un code civil, pénal et social, il entre partout, dans la vie de tout le monde et impose la soumission à Dieu parce qu'il est Jaloux et Tout-Puissant. Même quand j'étais musulman — mais après m'être délavé le cerveau de toutes les horreurs qu'on dit sur les occidentaux — il m'apparaissait clairement que le Catholicisme était plus une religion de paix que l'Islam. 

Et alors ? C'est basé sur des mythes ! Tu vas me dire que la religion encourage l'auto-critique ? L'Islam, qui convertit tant en ces temps, se dit basé sur ""l'auto-critique"", la ""science"" et l'""examen empirique"". Mais l'ensemble du Coran et les Ulemas s'évertuent à ne laisser pour point d'arrivée à tout ce tralala que l'existence et la suprématie de Dieu.

Siamo abituati ad etichettare ogni aspetto della nostra esperienza in vari modi, dovendo individuare solo due macro-categorie, credo si possano individuare esperienze positive (bene) ed esperienze negative (male). Queste etichette rafforzano — quando non creano di sana pianta — sensazioni di desiderio o repulsione, a seconda dei casi. Questo ha molti effetti nella nostra quotidianità, ma non voglio allungare il discorso più del dovuto, quindi passo al punto successivo.

Se riesci effettivamente a vedere un'esperienza (= sensazione) per quello che è, senza categorie mentali, è come se tu riducessi il ""rumore"" ed aumentassi la qualità del ""segnale"" relativamente a ciò che stai vivendo nel momento presente. Potresti quindi scoprire che molte cose che cerchi di evitare, non sono così terribili e la tua repulsione altro non è che un capriccio; potresti altresì goderti un bel momento senza la sotterranea preoccupazione che il momento successivo sia almeno altrettanto bello.

Tornando nello specifico alla mia esperienza con i pruriti, quando scrissi quel post la mia consapevolezza era limitata alla transitorietà della sensazione: sorgeva, osservavo senza giudicare, dopo un po' se ne andava. Ora inizio a notare che la percezione di uno stimolo è separata dalla nostra reazione a questo. Notando questo *gap* posso focalizzarmi in modo specifico sullo stimolo, oppure sulla reazione, su quel viscerale e sottile desiderio che lo stimolo cessi. Quasi sempre, diventando consapevole di questa reazione, il prurito si dissolve nel nulla.

Ad oggi, ho avuto una sola seduta in cui sono riuscito a vedere in questo modo ogni cosa che entrava nello spettro della mia esperienza; è stato fantastico vedere letteralmente dissolversi ogni fastidio fisico ed ogni ansia.

It might be in a all-out war scenario, which is the scenario in which it was *""rumored""* it would be undertaken. 

&gt;The libyan war was not started by Europe.

It was mainly called for and instigated by European countries. 

&gt;US troops in Mali came from the US mainland, not Europe. Really smart of you. Insulting me because you don't know anything about the Mali mission.

You don't quite understand how a logistical network operates, do you? Or the principles which power projection are founded on? Or why the logistical capability of the United States, which is cemented by bases in Europe &amp; around the world, was so essential to the operations in Mali &amp; Libya?

&gt;Our people don't want US troops in Europe. The government wants it, but nobody here agrees with the government.

Yet, you voted for the government and the representatives which make up it's legislature? 

Are you not a democracy? Does your legislative branch have no authority over the executive branch, or no say in such matter? Is your executive branch itself corrupt? Is the vast majority of your legislature corrupt? Your judicial branch as well?  

And I'm also glad to see you're the singular mouthpiece for all 16.7 million Dutch citizens. :) 

&gt;As stated earlier: You can only bring up subjects that aren't relevant. Mali and Libya have nothing to do with EU defense policy or US troops placed in Europe. The Balkan wars are relevant in the same way the Mexico-US war is still relevant today. There are still forces in Kosovo to maintain the peace, but the American contribution to it currently is unnecessary since there are 2731 European NATO soldiers present and 862 European non-NATO soldiers against a mere 768 US soldiers. This shows that the US is not needed in order to maintain peace in the Balkans.

&gt;This leaves 0 use for American troops in Europe. They aren't used for any ongoing conflicts and war is far from likely in Europe.

Did...did you just say that a conflict that happened less than twenty-years, and which still has a active peacekeeping force deployed in the region as a result of it, is just as relevant as a War which happened more than a century-and-a-half ago? lulz Seriously? I'm not even going to respond to that.

And as I pointed out, it's odd that the operation which got those peacekeepers to actually, in effect, KEEP THE PEACE in Kosovo relied on major U.S. support and power projection, isn't it? Sure there's no connection there. And like I pointed out before, there were also Dutch peacekeepers at Srebrinca, but that didn't stop the massacre of 8,000 Bosniaks from still occurring. :) 

And if Europe doesn't want us in Europe, than the democratic governments of Europe should ask us to leave. They shouldn't call for and instigate interventions like that of Libya &amp; Mali, than expect the United States to provide major, and in Libya's case, critical support. Which is usually logistically, and our logistical network, which enables our power projection, is cemented through military bases like those in Europe and around the world. In addition, they should also not use us as a hedge against Russia, or allow/encourage us to develop a ABM shield like we're doing in Hungary and other areas in the region. :) 

So once again, do you understand this whole *""logistics &amp; geography""* thing I'm trying to get across to you? The whole connection thing and it's relation to U.S. power projection which European countries have come to rely on in scenarios like The Balkans, Mali &amp; Libya?

It's you who is not understanding things. The Americans in Mali, where did they come from? The bases stationed in the US or in Europe.

Obviously that was sarcastic. The mexico-US war is no longer important, neither are the balkan wars.

&gt; And as I pointed out, it's odd that the operation which got those peacekeepers in the door in Kosovo relied on major U.S. support and power projection, isn't it? Sure there's no connection there....

There is a connection. We are grateful for the US helping us out with Kosovo, but the war is over so they can fuck off.

&gt; And if Europe doesn't want us in Europe, than the democratic governments of Europe should ask us to leave. 

Europe wants you, Europeans don't want you. There is a difference. There is a reason Europeans aren't happy with the current government and a big shift is coming in 2014 with the coming EU elections.

&gt; They shouldn't call for and instigate interventions like that of Libya &amp; Mali, than expect the United States to provide major, and in Libya's case, critical support. Which is usually logistically, and our logistical network, which enables our power projection, is cemented through military bases like those in Europe and around the world. In addition, they should also not use us as a hedge against Russia, or allow/encourage us to develop a ABM shield like we're doing in Hungary.

There weren't many Americans in Mali, but I wouldn't in the least be surprised if they came from pre-positioned forces at bases in Europe and in Africa. 

What I can gurantee is the transport aircraft and refueling planes which we provided, which if you haven't realized, are both essential for power projection, did utilize our bases in Europe heavily, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were originally fielded from pre-positioned Air Force units based out of Europe. Because...you know...once again...we were supplying and supporting a European military in a region directly adjacent to Europe...so those bases, as logistical hubs, proved, I can't stress this enough, absolutely ESSENTIAL in providing that assistance effectively and in a timely fashion.

You....you don't quite understand how the European Union's legislature or executive branches are structured...are you?

Also, if you don't like the people in your national government? Why don't you *VOTE THEM OUT*? Is your national government corrupt? Are the people you elected to your national government corrupt? Is your national government not a democracy?

Also, where in the hell did you get this idea in your head that the European Union can legislate on defense and foreign policy? Seriously dude, you're a European, I'm an American, I shouldn't be the one telling you how much of a no-no that is, and just how improbable it is.

You can have all the personnel you want. But it isn't shit without power projection. It isn't shit without a proper logistical network. It isn't shit without proper intelligence support. 

Size is not the end-all. You don't understand just how handicapped European power projection is. And given the fact that France and the United Kingdom, the only two other nations in NATO which actually possess some form of power projection, are making major cuts, you'll only see this become that much more evident. 

The backbone of that power projection, the lynchpin of it, is cemented by the bases we have through-out the world. The ones we have in Europe are essential for operations in North Africa, which are usually in support of European endeavors.

And I made my Kosovo argument clear. After Srebrinca, the United States was essential in the bombing campaign which stopped the Serbian offensive and the Bosnian Genocide, and the reason why the peacekeepers there today can ACTUALLY KEEP THE PEACE. 

And there is no single threat to Europe. Just the threats Europe creates, like Libya and Mali. Europe shouldn't call for these if Europe can't do it themselves. Europe shouldn't expect United States support. But since they do call for them, and since they do expect our support, this is why your governments prefer us there. 

The only other threat I can think of is Russia, and let's be honest, M.A.D. ensures that's not going to happen thanks to the French, British and American nukes, which we would use given Article 5 of NATO.

The blog post is an example of using statistics in an effort to try and seek support for a preconceived notion. For example, he makes claims about ""no job creation"" without actually using the relevant up to date job data but chooses to use some other population data which seemingly supports his preconceived conclusions.

Let's see for example Latvia: [graph](http://i.imgur.com/4My9ezC)  
The trend is clear with about 70 000 new jobs.

&gt; no job creation

Bollocks.

Another thing is his superficial usage of population stats and hastily leaping to conclusions with them. He's correct in pointing out that the population has been and is declining but for example he fails to notice that by 2010-11 the trend of emigration from Latvia turned to decline and immigration turned to rise with clear trends: [graph](http://i.imgur.com/sUX59nF)

Those are not the only problems with his blog post. It's riddled with misleading usage of data in an apparent effort to support a personal agenda.

Because we had to supply and support European militaries in Libya, which are bases in Europe...you know...given the fact we were supporting European militaries in a region directly adjacent to Europe...were pretty god damn essential in enabling.

That's a whole other thing. We aksed for help, but we rather have slow help from your own bases, than quick help from your bases on our soil.

&gt; There weren't many Americans in Mali, but I wouldn't in the least be surprised if they came from pre-positioned forces at bases in Europe and in Africa.

Wrong. The few Americans in Mali were moved there directly from the United States.

&gt; What I can gurantee is the transport aircraft and refueling planes which we provided, which if you haven't realized, are both essential for power projection, did utilize our bases in Europe heavily, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were originally fielded from pre-positioned Air Force units based out of Europe.

We're happy to have some refueling planes and transport aircraft. We don't want ground troops, jet fighters and tanks. You're refueling and transport aircraft can easily be stationed at European bases, with European ground forces. The need for any forces and bases in Europe is unnecessary since we can provide that. If logistics is the big factor here, the US would be far more off using our bases.

&gt; If they weren't important, than there wouldn't be an active peacekeeping force there, would it?

That they aren't important doesn't mean we must encourage a new war. American peacekeeping forces are unnecessary, there are enough European forces and the balkan wars aren't important into defense policy since it only plays a small role. As long as the small European force is stationed there, nothing happens.

&gt; Size is not the end-all. You don't understand just how handicapped European power projection is. And given the fact that France and the United Kingdom, the only two other nations in NATO which actually possess some form of power projection, are making major cuts, you'll only see this become that much more evident.
The backbone of that power projection, the lynchpin of it, is cemented by the bases we have through-out the world. The ones we have in Europe are essential for operations in North Africa, which are usually in support of European endeavors.

And exactly who do we need to use this power projection against? The Russians are no threat (Nor militarily nor politically, even in Eastern-Europe.) and there are no real targets anywhere. Iran? Iran is an American antagonist, not a threat. China? Really?

&gt; And I made my Kosovo argument clear. After Srebrinca, the United States was essential in the bombing campaign which stopped the Serbian offensive and the Bosnian Genocide, and the reason why the peacekeepers there today can ACTUALLY KEEP THE PEACE.

Source please. It's only shouting and shouting.

Your government disagrees. Hence why we have bases. :) 

&gt;Wrong. The few Americans in Mali were moved there directly from the United States.

Source? And were they moved there, with, dare I say it, transport aircraft stationed with American Air Force units in Europe? Did they rely on supplies which got to them easier from, here I go again, forgive me, logistical hubs we have established through bases in Europe? 

&gt;We're happy to have some refueling planes and transport aircraft. We don't want ground troops, jet fighters and tanks. You're refueling and transport aircraft can easily be stationed at European bases, with European ground forces. The need for any forces and bases in Europe is unnecessary since we can provide that. If logistics is the big factor here, the US would be far more off using our bases.

See, this is the thing, and I know this might be kinda hard to understand, BUT YOU DON'T GET TO DICTATE WHAT WE DO WITH OUR SHIT NOR POMPOUSLY EXPECT US TO HELP YOU FOR EVERY ENDEAVOR YOU GET INVOLVED IN. The trade off is us having these bases, hence why we're so willingly to help you. Without them, there is no incentive. 

So you can close our bases. Fine. Close them. But you're not, and you won't. One of the reasons being you won't have bargaining chips on your side to GET US to help. If you don't like the status quo, increase military funding and encourage integration with the E.U. militarily. If you don't like those ideas, than stop your bitching if you don't have a solution. Or tell your government to, from now on, ignore anything like what happened in The Balkans *(Europe actually did this....which caused it to turn into a genocide...so not the best strategy)* or call for anything like Mali/Libya. 

&gt;That they aren't important doesn't mean we must encourage a new war. American peacekeeping forces are unnecessary, there are enough European forces and the balkan wars aren't important into defense policy since it only plays a small role. As long as the small European force is stationed there, nothing happens.

American peacekeeping forces are as necessary as European peacekeeping forces. I don't even know the point you're trying to make. It's a United Nation/NATO mission, which, I know this might surprise you, both include the United States. In fact, along with the French &amp; British, the United States peacekeepers are probably the MOST IMPORTANT, given they're a U.N. Security Council member, and the fact we pretty much provide the backbone of NATO. 

And what do you mean *""encourage a new war""*? What the hell are you even talking about? The whole reason the war, and genocide, stopped was because the Peacekeepers actually became effective. 

And the only reason they became effective was because the U.S. threw it's full weight into the operation after Srebrinca. 

&gt;And exactly who do we need to use this power projection against? The Russians are no threat (Nor militarily nor politically, even in Eastern-Europe.) and there are no real targets anywhere. Iran? Iran is an American antagonist, not a threat. China? Really?

Mali, Libya &amp; Kosovo. 

&gt;You're exaggerating this. The US isn't the major power projection force that makes Eastern-Europe swing to the western side.

No, but I'll be damned if our subsidized hard power through NATO doesn't compliment the E.U.'s soft power when it's negotiating with Russia over Eastern Europe. 

&gt;You haven't provided any sources either.

&gt;Source please. It's only shouting and shouting.

&gt;America was visibly reluctant to get involved, let alone lead the action. And, having helped to knock out Libya's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes, it pulled back from the front-line operations. But America's role remains essential, not least in providing air-to-air refuelling, as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the European allies.

&gt;NATO Major-General Marcel Druart, addressing the European Parliament committee on security and defence on Tuesday (20 March), said NATO relied heavily on US military expertise on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.

&gt;The French government has formally requested U.S. military assistance to combat al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in Mali, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the American Forces Press Service on Thursday

[U.S. aiding France's military operation in Mali](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57563710/)

&gt;*BAMAKO, MALI* - France's foreign minister said Sunday that the United States is providing communications and transport help for an international military intervention aimed at wresting Mali's north out of the hands of Islamist extremists.

Also, the last one doesn't even mention the extensive intelligence support we gave the French, nor the Special Forces we put down into Niger, a country which neighbors Mali, and the one which provides up to 20% of France's uranium *(also the realpolitik reason I believe France got involved in Mali in the first place)*.

And let's not forget about [The Balkans](http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/1998/12/balkans-daalder):

&gt;Washington's preference was clear. It repeatedly demanded that the U.N. forces either stop the latest Bosnian Serb assault or, at the very least, agree to NATO air strikes to punish the Serb forces and protect the ""safe"" areas. Most European allies had a different view. Unlike the United States, many Europeans had placed their troops at risks by participating in the U.N. operation on the understanding that their involvement would be limited to a strictly humanitarian mandate. When limited air strikes in late May 1995 resulted in nearly 400 peacekeepers being taken hostage, a consensus quickly emerged within the U.N. and among the troop-contributing countries that, however limited, NATO air strikes would do more harm than good. 

So this happened: 

[Srebrinca Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre)

&gt;The Srebrenica massacre, also known as the Srebrenica genocide, refers to the July 1995 killing, during the Bosnian War, of more than 8,000 Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), mainly men and boys, in and around the town of Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina, by units of the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) under the command of General Ratko Mladić. The mass murder was described by the Secretary-General of the United Nations as the worst crime on European soil since the Second World War. A paramilitary unit from Serbia known as the Scorpions, officially part of the Serbian Interior Ministry until 1991, participated in the massacre and it is alleged that foreign volunteers including the Greek Volunteer Guard also participated.

Right under the nose of Dutch peacekeepers, who knew exactly what was happening yet did not move because they were ordered not to. 

Which led back to [this](http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/1998/12/balkans-daalder):

&gt;Srebrenica was the West's greatest shame, with each of the 7,079 lives lost underscoring the failure to act in time to avert this single most genocidal act of the Bosnian war. Guilt led senior representatives of the United States and its key allies to agree in London a few days later that NATO would make a strong stand at Gorazde by defending the town's civilian population. (This decision was later extended to the three other remaining 'safe' areas of Bihac, Sarajevo, and Tuzla; Zepa had earlier fallen to the Bosnian Serbs). The allies agreed that an attack on, or even a threat to, Gorazde would be met with a ""substantial and decisive"" air campaign. ""There'll be no more ""pinprick"" strikes,"" Secretary of State Warren Christopher declared. A few days later, the North Atlantic Council worked out the final operational details of the air campaign and passed the decision to NATO's military commanders on when to conduct the strikes.

Basically Western Europeans powers were unable and unwilling to stop the Bosnian genocide in the 1990s, which was happening in THEIR VERY OWN BACKYARD, until the United States finally stepped in, unfortunately, after thousands had already been slaughtered. 

And if you don't see the implication or value of NATO when the European Union is negotiating with Russia, than, well shit, I can't really help you. Just because you don't use your army doesn't mean you derive no value from your army. I know Sun Tzu or someone said that shit a lot more elegantly than I just did, but it's the truth. You can have all the soft power you want in the world, but it only goes so far without hard power, which for the most part, the United States subsidizes much of in the case of Europe.

There's an even simpler way to think about this than that, when diagnosing patients primarily all that is done for most cases is to input symptoms and output the statistically most probable illness.

From the article you cite, it seems that that is inferred from article 1 of the law. It seems like that's a pretty big jump, but I'll let others judge:

&gt;**Art. 1** The French Republic recognizes that the transatlantic slave trade and the slave trade in the Indian Ocean on one side, and slavery on the other hand, starting from the 15^th century, in the Americas and the Caribbean, in the Indian Ocean and Europe against the African, Amerindian, Malagasy and Indian populations constitute a crime against humanity.

It seems that this ""European slave trade was bad"" is interpreted by some as ""Only Europeans traded slaves, and therefore only Europeans did bad"". 

OTOH Taubira does seem a bit of a douche

&gt;Christiane Taubira bluntly states should not too mention the Arab-Muslim slave trade that ""young Arabs"" ""do not carry on their backs the weight of the legacy harm Arabs.""

&gt;Europe, as it is now, has a [ageing population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Europe) which it desperately needs to correct. It has a decrease in fertility, a decrease in mortality rate, and a higher life expectancy, all of which will only stress and put more burden on many European countries economies *(as well as increase their debt)*. [By 2050, an estimated 35% of the European population will be over the age of 60.](http://www.thematuremarket.com/SeniorStrategic/ageing_population_european_facts-6204-5.html)

&gt;Compare this to the United States, which has a [population growth rate](https://www.google.com/search?q=United+States+Population+growth&amp;oq=United+States+Population+growth&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.7604j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8) close to 3.5x that of [Europe](http://www.indexmundi.com/european_union/population_growth_rate.html).  By 2050 close to [20% of the population](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/776.full) is predicted to be over the age of 60, which while not ideal, is still 15% better than Europe, or, in short, a 1/5th of the American population compared to Europe's 1/3rd. 

&gt;Economically, we are also faring rather well.  [America came out of the recession four years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Great_Recession), the European Union did as well, but had [a double-dip recession](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/15/eurozone-double-dip-recession) shortly afterwards, [which it only exited from last August](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/13/eurozone-exit-double-dip-recession). In short, we *(America)* still have years of growth *(albeit small)* while Europe as a whole still has years of recession/loss looming over it's head. We've reached pre-2008 levels this year IIRC, but Europe still has a long way to go before it regains the ground it's lost.

&gt;Plus, America had a 2012 [GDP growth of 2.2%](https://www.google.com/search?q=u.s.+gdp+growht&amp;oq=u.s.+gdp+growht&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65l2j69i60j69i61j69i60.9043j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8#es_sm=122&amp;espv=210&amp;q=united+states+gdp+growth&amp;safe=off), compared to the European Union's projected 2013 [GDP growth of .2%](http://rt.com/business/eu-gdp-q3-eurostat-707/) (remember, the E.U. was in recession in 2012). And since our growth has remained relatively stable, our economy is growing at something like 12x that of Europe. And our 2013 growth numbers are supposed to be even higher, so expect that mutiple to rise. If IIRC, we're even projected to surpass the European Union's economy by 2020.

&gt;Unemployment wise, the European Union has a [unemployment rate of 10.9%](https://www.google.com/search?q=European+Union+unemployment+rate&amp;oq=European+Union+unemployment+rate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5239j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8) and the Eurozone an unemployment rate of [12.1%, which is projected to go up to 12.3 percent](http://www.dw.de/oecd-predicts-record-eurozone-unemployment-for-2014/a-16953636)  by the end of the year.

I've heard similar to what you say from some teachers though. There seem to be some fairly common beliefs held among some of the poorer sections of British society. People who left school with little or no qualifications will tell their children things like ""Don't bother with school because it didn't get me anywhere"".

In reality, you will probably find that that sort of person was actually Dyslexic or something, but back in the 50s or whenever it wasn't as easily diagnosed as it is today, so they were just labelled as 'thick' instead.

Of course nowadays there is much more support for children diagnosed with special educational needs. 

There is also a greater recognition that not everybody learns in the same way. For every person who can recite facts from memory, there is somebody who learns better by actually doing a task.

As for the domestic abuse, racism things, I can't really say. The school I work in is in a predominantly white area, but I've seen no obvious racism towards any of the black or mixed race pupils.

Not very powerful and not likely to change, IMHO. Politically, they are mostly irrelevant ATM - just look at almost all elections except in some small towns in eastern Germany and regional phenomena like Pro-Deutschland. They would be happy to be in a comparable position to that of similar political movements in many other countries.

We need to be watchful, though. *They are trying* to expand their influence by attracting teenagers (via nazi music groups and such), (badly) masquerading as non-nazis with right-wing issues (like opposition to mosques), [infiltrating sports clubs, volunteer fire brigades and other clubs (sorry, german article)](http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/rechtsextremismus_aid_237428.html) and probably other strategies as well. OTOH, their more covert strategies also underline their problem: The stigma of being associated with nazis is so severe that they can't be very open about it.

Also, our politicians and law enforcement agencies need to get their priorities and approach straight - the failures in investigating the NPD and related groups (via numerous well paid informants) and in even recognizing the NSU murder series (surely not for lack of informants...) are disgusting.

grosso modo :

1. Vichy ne voulait pas tuer les juifs
2. Les nazis ont demandé, en 1942, la livraison de 100 000 juifs dans l'année, avec à moyen terme tous les juifs de France non Français en 1927 (200 000 en métropole). En particulier, les demandes nazies comprenaient la ""dénaturalisation"" de tous les Français juifs naturalisés depuis 1927, et de tous les Français juifs appartenant à ""l'espace vital"" allemand.
2. Sur demande allemande, la police française a livré plus de 71000 juifs, dont 52000 étrangers, 8000 naturalisés et 8000 enfants d'étrangers de nationalité française grâce à la loi du [10 août 1927](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loi_du_10_ao%C3%BBt_1927). 4000 autres juifs périrent, soit à cause de représailles allemandes, soit à cause des conditions de vie, soit dans les camps de transit, et un certain nombre de juifs (entre 1000 et 5000) furent arrêtés non par la police française, mais bien par les forces d'occupation allemande.
3. Les ministres du gouvernement autoritaire de Vichy et les autorités de police auraient probablement pu s'opposer à la déportation de 35000 juifs livrés pendant que la France avait encore une certaine aura (avant l'invasion de la zone libre et la destruction de sa flotte en novembre 1942). L'ampleur des représailles allemandes ne peut être estimée.
5. La police française a mal fait son boulot d'arrestation. En particulier, à Paris, sur les 22000 juifs demandés et listés, il n'y en aura que 13000 livrés.
5.

* Coloniales - the best tapas in Sevilla imo. There're two locations but the one near Alfalfa is better because there's outside seating (get there early-ish or you'll be waiting for hours, but the bar is nice so that's not so bad).  
* Las Columnas - for the best people-watching, right in the middle of Barrio Santa Cruz near the cathedral  
* Bar Estrella - there're tons of little tapas places in Barrio Santa Cruz but this one is one of my favourites.  
* I forget what it's called but there's a really nice Galician place on Calle Harinas.   
* Rayas - best helado ever  

**Granada**: As you probably know, Granada is one of the few places that still give you tapas for free with your drinks. Some places give you a bit of a menu to choose from; others it's based on the number of rounds of drinks you get.  
* Los Diamantes - All seafood, all amazing. Last time I was in Granada we planned to go here for a drink or two and ended up staying the whole night.  
* Om Khalsum - Moorish-type tapas like falafel and humuus.   
* Poe - The tapas here are great but if you're looking for atmosphere I wouldn't stay long, seemed to be almost all American and English study abroad students when I went  
* Babel - Went here three times in two days, good for tapas or for lunch. Fusion of a lot of different types of foods.   ",0,1388936576,null,0,false,0,cehvu1d,t3_1ugnhw,t1_cehvu1d,t3_1ugnhw,null,1435537732,2,false,spain,t5_2qhd6,2

I've attended dozens of demonstrations, both back where I come from in Western Europe and more recently where I live now in Central/Eastern Europe, and there are a great many protests that never turn into a riot and are unlikely to ever turn into one. The only demos I've seen that turned into a riot were obvious suspects: the far-right ones here in Budapest in 2006-2007, and a squatter protest or two way back in time in Holland. And that seemed to have a lot more to do with the political orientation and temperament of the people who would attend those specific kind of demonstrations than with any overall phenomenon of how ""crowd hysteria"" can make any ""peaceful gathering"" ""quickly turn into a riot"".

The IRA, around the time of Thatcher, actually set up some sort of mortar in London which they used to bomb Number 10 Downing Street (fortunately nobody was killed). A hotel on the British mainland was bombed where many Conservative Party members were thought to have been staying. The British army had already been deployed to Northern Ireland to try and maintain order and unfortunately the Irish Republican community largely misinterpreted the intention of putting troops their (UK government also takes blame for this misinterpretation) and the situation was *even further exacerbated*. Even today, ten years after the Good Friday Agreement, there are riots in Northern Ireland on an annual basis. Just think how bad it must have been before that agreement. 

I'm not defending the idea of exodus and segregation. I'm defending the government of the 1980s considering it. As it stands would have been a tragic decisions to make, *which is why it was never made*.

What the fuck are you talking about? *""Raised on tales of Revolution""*? Where in the hell am I suggesting you take the *""revolutionary way""*? If anything I'm saying the exact opposite. 

The European Union needs to slow down, stop expanding so fast and **actually negotiate** what it is and agree on it's future. Those treaties arn't effective, **the treaties are what is promulgating authority**. 

This is evident. The common European citizen, *educated* citizens, barely understand how the government structure of the European Union works. This, at least for me, is solidified by the fact that many subscribers on this very subreddit don't understand that the European Parliament doesn't have a legislative mandate. Many barely understand the difference between the Commission and the Council, and I for one, see them as simply two groups that mirror each other except for semantics. 

You know what's going to cause implosion - or explosion? The average citizen not feeling like they have say in a new government that is having increasingly more &amp; more sovereignty over them. They need to be made more aware of the changes, they need to be made to feel like they have more say in the direction of the European Union.

And you know **why** they feel like this? Because the European Union has a shitty fucking PR department. And this is because they have a identity crisis. It doesn't know what it wants to be, a consolidated supranational union which emulates a nation-state, or a loose confederation of nations. Because of this institutional confusion, the citizens are confused, which means they feel disconnected. This leads to BIG problems down the road. 

Don't sit here and try to act like you understand me or know me, to assume I was raised on *""revolutionary tales""* or move to chastise me as a *""poor, little unknowledgeable American""*, because the only one you're doing a disservice to is yourself. The European Union's image is bi-polar, it has serious problems brewing under the surface and it needs to properly respond to them. Get off your high horse and recognize this, because the superior and posh attitude isn't going to do you any good.

A vote for Greens is both a wasted vote because they have no chance of getting into office (yes, I know with PR there are no wasted votes, I'm sure you know what I mean!) and also a vote for a party whose most enduring achievement was being complicit in the banking crisis and enabling FF to do what they did by refusing to force an election when one was desperately needed. I will never forget this, and until the leadership is replaced completely I will never consider this party for any reason. Since their green credentials have essentially been adopted by the other parties, there is no environmental benefit to voting for them either.

A vote for Labour is not pragmatic because a vote for them is a vote for the policies of Fine Gael; why not just vote for FG? Labour has capitulated to FG on all important issues and I can't see any meaningful policy contributions they make. This really would be a wasted vote. Indeed, their impotence and political cowardice is even more apparent since they are less effective than ever before despite having historically large representation; this shows that the problem isn't Labour being marginalised by outside forces, it's them. It's a fundamental problem with the people in charge. 

I do respect Fine Gael for what they are; they are, in general, effective and honest (although there is no doubt in my mind that they would't have handled the banking crisis any differently than FF; they just wouldn't have worked with the banks to protect the criminals in them).

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;some source on this?

Let's start stating common known-facts:

1. The gold was Romanian deposited in Russia for the safe-guard in 1916.

2. Romania invaded Bessarabia (part of Russia back then) in the year 1918. The Soviet government in response confiscated the gold. But Soviet officials stated that the gold will be returned to Romanian government in exchange for the return of the Bessarabian region.

3. Bessarabia was not returned. Then WW2 happened with Romania taking sides with Germans and losing in 1944 because of the Red Army invasion. The region was returned not willingly, but by force.

Just with these facts Romania would not have a strong legal claim to the gold accordingly to the international law. In any case let's study the ""debt"" balance between the two states:

By the [Paris Peace Treaties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Treaties,_1947) Romania had to pay $ 300 000 000 in 8 years in commodities (oil-products, grain, timber, seagoind and river craft, sundry machinery, etc.). Which is equivalent of the 243 tons of gold by the price of $35 stated in the [page 69 of the Draft Peace Treaties](http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1946v04/reference/frus.frus1946v04.i0006.pdf).

Also by the same treaty (article 25, for example) - all the German and partly Italian assets in Romania became Soviet Union property. Which by the end of the war was significant share of the country's industry.

The Romanian gold in Moscow was estimated in 100 tons (at best), which would be 41% of the debt to the Soviet Union and was accepted by Soviet government in good faith (because they didn't have to, they could consider it already as property of USSR).

For the rest of the Romanian debts a series of programs were created, since it was virtually impossible to pay that much - SovRoms, trading treaties, barters, etc. In the end both parts of the agreement Soviet Union acquired Romanian resources for cheap for at least 2 decades and Romania gained control over the ex-German and ex-Italian firms in it's territory and wasn't crush by an impossible debt.

Later in 1956 Soviet Union in good faith returned all goods of any historical or cultural value to the RSR.

How it works is you shovel as many people as you can onto the bottom tier of the pyramid and this increases the value of the limited resources and commodities people at the top of pyramid own. This is referred to as ""growing the economy"". Those at the bottom of the pyramid will also be used to pay for the retirement of those exiting the pyramid in the middle. 

If a worker ties up their income in savings for retirement and other things, then that wealth is effectively out of use. In can't be used to inflate property prices for example. What the puppet masters who control governments want is for workers to cycle all their income back into the economy as quickly as possible and to have borrow money to pay for any large living expenses as borrowing creates interest which creates more money for those at the top of the pyramid, another way to ""grow the economy"". 

When people live in a pay-check to pay-check society like his, the bottom tier of the pyramid needs to continuously be larger than the one above it to fund the welfare expenses of the people in it.

The problem however was after WW2, gradually people stopped having large families. This was for a combination of reasons including contraception and the womens' rights movement etc. So European governments decided to import people from third world countries who didn't have womens' rights and still have large families to fill the void. 

In fact a recent [study](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/05/migration-target-useless-experts) revealed that between 1995 and 2011, non-EEA immigrants actually received more benefits than they had paid in taxes, receiving £100 billion more in benefits and services than they paid out, the main reason being that they had had more children than people living in Britain.

true,King_of_Avalon,EURO,Croatia,"I agree. I'm not entirely sure that they (both Cameron and Farage) think they can actually accomplish with rhetoric like this. No one in Europe is interested in letting the UK stay in the EU, claim its rebate every year, not let in EU citizens, but expect to be able to take part in every advantage to the common market. It's absolute nonsense - a unified message from the rest of Europe of ""you're all in or all out, no cherrypicking"" is gravely needed at this point.

But what's even worse is that I think at least Cameron knows this is all nonsense and none of it is possible. This is a common tactic in politics, where you tell the press all the things that you're *going to* do, then wait for a bit for it all to die down and then don't do it. That way, most people remember and seem to think that you did something when you never actually did. 

And what's worse still is that this isn't just an issue of economics or public policy; they're spewing vitriol over *people's lives*. I am an immigrant to the UK and have been for a very long time. I happen to be away at the moment but was planning on going back in about six weeks or so. Now I'm not really sure I want to. I know Cameron is trying to outmanoeuvre Farage because UKIP's going to wipe the floor with the Tories in May, but by fuck playing with people's lives and **pandering to xenophobia, spurious and outright inaccurate facts about immigration is dangerous**. For fuck's sake, you would think the people of Europe would have learnt this lesson a few times over by now. It's one thing for Cameron to get up and swing his dick about on television, talking about how stupid the shadow chancellor's tax proposals are, but when you are intentionally and systematically working in concert with a corrupt, populist right-wing press to whip up national sentiment against *other people*, the lives they lead and the freedoms guaranteed them under law, this is **not** constructive and **never will be**.

Sure, I have lots of problems with the Home Office and the UK Border Agency and, were I the home secretary, I'd drastically reform immigration policy to the UK because there are some serious shortcomings, even if the backbone of the system is relatively robust. But you know what? I know UK immigration policy like the back of my hand; every major high court ruling, every white paper, every public consultation that never turned into anything. Quite frankly, if you can't explain the differences between a Tier 1 and Tier 2 visa, how one can qualify as an intra-company transferee, or what the purpose of the EU registration card is, then *you don't get to shout*. Your ignorance of immigration can only drag the debate down, and on a subject as sensitive as this, people without facts are in no position to be afforded soapboxes from which to spew their fucking nonsense.

To everyone in the UK: the *overwhelming* majority of 'facts' you read about immigration in the press are wrong. They're nonsense, deliberately misconstrued and twisted to fit a political narrative, and moreso than most other areas of public policy frequently reported on. Anyone who is an immigrant to the UK can attest to the fact that there is so much wrong information out there, there's almost nothing left that's right. 

If you have any questions about UK immigration policy, feel free to ask me and I'll respond as and when I can, because it's about fucking time that someone calls out Cameron, Farage, and anyone else on the bullshit they spew based largely on anecdotal evidence of ""I see more brown people, therefore there must be a problem.""",0,1388944648,null,0,false,0,cehyjav,t3_1uge08,t1_cehyjav,t1_cehw7x6,null,1431809897,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Yes we do share a lot of similar cultural elements with our neighbors, especially with our Slavic neighbors.

&gt; but I've been told that there's the Balkan influence on Romanian is understated because that region tends to have negative connotations.

It's not the Balkan influence as much as the Slavic influence which is minimized, due to our national identity focusing on the Latin aspect of our language (""an island of Latinity in a sea of Slavs"").

We don't have problems with Paleo-Balkan influences, such as the [schprachbund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_sprachbund) (since we consider the Dacians our ancestors, and they were Paleo-Balkans, we tend to exagerate it, especially when it comes to vocabulary), nor do we have problems with Greek or Turkic/Ottoman influences.

We don't like the ""Balkan"" label though, but more on the political front, not on the linguistic front.

You know you've contradicted yourself :P It's far from a waste, it'll be recycled. It's a show of support. While I wouldn't like a Green majority government, I feel like the Green agenda needs a boost.

&gt; and also a vote for a party whose most enduring achievement was being complicit in the banking crisis and enabling FF to do what they did by refusing to force an election when one was desperately needed. I will never forget this, and until the leadership is replaced completely I will never consider this party for any reason. Since their green credentials have essentially been adopted by the other parties, there is no environmental benefit to voting for them either.

The Greens were not elected like the PDs were (on the basis of keeping a 'check' in FF), and in all fairness, if they had pulled the plug on government, there was a huge fear of a massive economic calamity. They pulled it safely and responsibly in my view. It's not the Greens fault that the people gave FF a mandate in 2007 you know.

&gt;A vote for Labour is not pragmatic because a vote for them is a vote for the policies of Fine Gael; why not just vote for FG? Labour has capitulated to FG on all important issues and I can't see any meaningful policy contributions they make. This really would be a wasted vote. Indeed, their impotence and political cowardice is even more apparent since they are less effective than ever before despite having historically large representation; this shows that the problem isn't Labour being marginalised by outside forces, it's them. It's a fundamental problem with the people in charge.

Because it's not a vote for FG - a vote for FG is a vote for FG. Besides, they are certainly to the left of FG, and more liberal besides. But in a coalition, compromises must be made.

&gt;I do respect Fine Gael for what they are; they are, in general, effective and honest (although there is no doubt in my mind that they would't have handled the banking crisis any differently than FF; they just wouldn't have worked with the banks to protect the criminals in them). But I don't agree with the majority of their policy, economic or social, so it doesn't make sense for me to vote for them.

I'd vote for them to keep SF and FF out of Parliament. I think that's a good pragmatic decision.",0,1388948140,null,0,false,0,cei00sh,t3_1ue29f,t1_cei00sh,t1_cehy4ld,null,1431810616,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

If Salmond or any other nationalist had been campaigned that Elizabeth shouldn't be the monarch of an independent Scotland, then that nationalist wouldn't be saying ""we want a *different* monarch"", they'd be saying ""we want *no* monarch"". 

British nobody in the current United Kingdom likes the *idea* of monarch, but most people are pretty fond of the *reality* of it. Scots are similar, but (I think) are slightly more sympathetic to republicanism than the rest of the country by-enlarge.

The whole argument for the continuation of the monarchy comes from Conservative values about tradition, with the monarchy at the centre.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"I disagree. I think there are hypothetical situations where even genocide is worth considering. I mean, for instance, a zombie apocalypse might target certain races more than others and at that point I'd say that the world's governments should evaluate whether a genocide of those people is necessary to protect the longevity of the rest of the human race.

In my opinion it's ethical to execute an action if the ends of that action justify the means of it. That is to say that, if committing genocide of a certain race (the means) led to the survival of humanity over a disease (the ends) then I would think that we should commit genocide. 

In almost all other circumstances genocide would be a completely stupid idea, but I think that it would be naïve to believe that the outcome of genocide is always inherently negative and should never *ever* be discussed as the solution to a problem. I think it should be considered as a solution to problems and then immediately ruled out because in ~99.999999% of situations genocide is a terrible solution to your problem, but it should be considered because maybe this will be the ~0.000001% of cases where genocide is the appropriate course of action. 

I feel the exact same way about forced exodus and segregation. It's almost always the wrong answer but this (Northern Ireland C.1980) is one of the situations where it might have been the appropriate course of action. As it turns out it wasn't quite right (walls were errected in Belfast between Catholic and Protestant communities which seem to have helped the problem). I'm glad they didn't do it. I'm very glad. Because it would have been overkill. However I don't think we should criticise them for considering something or weighing up the pros and cons. 

Governments have contingency plans for everything. The US had and still does have plans for an invasion of Canada. The United States of America is, in all likelihood, *not going to invade Canada*, but the plans are there just in case. These plans were also made ""just in case"". It's the way of government.

In the students life you can find anything from tie &amp; suit, hipster &amp; indie and hip &amp; hop parties and communities, although the cliché is that Berlin is somewhat of a hipster and alternative city. 

Berlin is pretty large though, so depending where you can get an apartment you need to travel a lot with publics to get around. Also the trendy parts of the city can be expensive as any other high rent city like Munich or Hamburg, while the more inexpensive ones are not always ideally located for you. It's really our only metropolitan city with lots of people and buildings everywhere.

----

Hanover - The smallest of the three with just around half a million people here. It's often called bland and boring and many nice old parts of the city were bombed to ruins in WWII. The club and party scene is a lot more limited than Berlin and Munich. But you can find some very nice and interesting places if you dig a bit deeper, it might just not be so easy for an exchange student who only stays for half a year. It's nice and compact though, so even if you live outside in the suburbs you can easily reach the city centre in around 30mins. 

I think the largest advantage is that Hanover is has a very commanding position in the train and Autobahn network in Germany. It is pretty central in the main South-North and East-West transit routes (Munich-Hamburg and Berlin-Köln ICE trains runs through Hanover). You can easily reach cities like Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, Leipzig and the Rhine-Ruhr area around Hanover for quick day or weekend trips. This can give you are very broad view of all the kinds different cities, people and culture we have here. Even the regions in the south are pretty quickly reached, Munich for example is only ~4,5hours with the ICE from Hanover.

---

Munich - Together with Hamburg and Berlin probably one of our most trendy and popular cities. Most of the older parts of the city survived WWII thanks to the larger distance to the Allied bomber bases. Which means there are a lot of nice looking old buildings and neighbourhoods to look at. Rent is expensive, but survivable. If you can get your hands on some of the newly built dorm apartments you can luck out - ~250-300€ monthly including power and internet for a small, but modern and clean room. The apartment and room market is highly competitive though, not enough affordable rooms for too many people. Simple one room prices are mostly around 400-500€ in more central parts near public transports, but even neighbourhoods more outside are not really much cheaper. Really depends on what you find though, if you can find nice room mates it can get lower.

The cliché is that people are more stuck up, arrogant but the Southerners have their own gruffy charm. The students community is a lot more laid back though  - Munich is a super popular location for students all over Germany and Europe, so you often find even more people in your courses who are not native to the city than born and bred locals. Extensive party and clubbing scene with large diversity, a bit like Berlin but people in general dress more trendy than hipsterly. ;) There are some smaller fairs and festivals similar to the big and famous Oktoberfest all over the year, so if you want to you get your chance to see your share Lederhosen, Dirndl and beer. 

Around Munich you mostly have smaller cities and towns, also popular castles to visit. It's pretty far away from the other big German cities though, but on the other hand you can reach the skiing and hiking regions in the Alps very easily and Austria and the Czech Republic are just right around the corner for a visit to Salzburg (Mozart!) or Prague.",0,1388953063,null,0,false,0,cei26yr,t3_1uh2y3,t1_cei26yr,t3_1uh2y3,null,1435537392,23,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,23

true,Ripolin,FRAN,France,"&gt; Yeah, we talked about this in my European Security class. My professor was... not terribly positive about this. She flippantly compared it to the desire of Russians for a ""strong leader,"" and noted that the Fifth French Republic is younger than India, Israel, and the Philippines.

Our constitutional history is not really quiet (it's an euphemism). We made a lot of experimentations (the First Republic, the Restoration, Second Republic, the end of the Second Empire, the Commune, etc.). The Fifth Republic gave us an institutional stability. In 4 years, it'll be our longest political regime since 1789. But also, it never had to deal with a war. All of our previous regimes failed, in one way or another, because of a war.

&gt; Indeed, the Fifth Republic does look like a constitutional monarchy where the monarch has devolved most powers onto a parliament but retains substantial power for himself.

The affirmation of Duverger is less true today. With the last constitutional reform of 2008, the powers of the opposition have been strengthened and our Supreme Court, the Constitutional Council, can control the legislation a posteriori, etc. I would say it's ""less worse"" now.",0,1388955737,null,0,false,0,cei3fuq,t3_1uh1af,t1_cei3fuq,t1_cei1hy3,null,1431812267,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,Bosco89,veneto,null,"Provo a riportare telegraficamente un po' di affermazioni divise per argomento (indicando la fonte all'inizio del paragrafo), cercando di essere più neutrale possibile.

**Brevetti:**  
*Vannoni*: Consegnato il metodo all'Istituto superiore di Sanità [che da quel che ho capito i documenti relativi non sono pubblici]. Metodo non brevettabile, perché la richiesta di brevetto in US è decaduta e quindi non è più brevettabile. Il metodo è pubblico, nel brevetto decaduto.  
*Remuzzi*: USPTO ha richiesto chiarimenti, la comunità scientifica italiana ha fatto pessima figura, figure copiate in russo senza autorizzazione.

**Vannoni col camice:**  
Vannoni smentisce di essersi finto medico a Brescia, insieme alla smentita del direttore generale dell'ospedale dott. Belleri.

**Dati e cartelle cliniche:**  
*Vannoni*: l'ospedale di Brescia ha solo raccolto i dati sulla innocuità del metodo, non sull'efficacia. Le analisi di efficacia sono state fatte negli ospedali di riferimento e che verranno presentati domani mattina in conferenza stampa [che casino...]  
*Remuzzi*: Membri della commissione ISS scandalizzati dal rapporto. NAS non sanno se ci sono staminali nei campioni del metodo.  
*Vannoni*: Il rapporto dei NAS è fatto con i piedi e contestato dalla Regione Lombardia.  
*Spettatore post-intervista 2*: E i genitori dei bambini malati che hanno visto miglioramenti?

**Sperimentazione:**  
*Vannoni*: Nel 2010 richiesta di sperimentazione al'ISS, che ""per ragioni di fondi e per un terzo ente"" ha bloccato la sperimentazione. Il TAR ha ordinato di cambiare il comitato scientifico. I tribunali impongono di far trattare i pazienti all'ospedale di Brescia. ""Sarò a Miami per ulteriori studi di approfondimento""  
*Remuzzi*: La sperimentazione deve seguire un certo iter: Meccanismo d'azione plausibilie, dati nella sperimentazione animale, e successivamente volontario sano, piccoli numeri di pazienti, analisi approfondita dei risultati. Non c'è in Stamina.  
*Vannoni*: Fondazione applica una legge italiana al di fuori dalla sperimentazione. Sperimentazione scientifica =/= processo di autorizzazione di un farmaco. Troppo tempo per la sperimentazione, vogliamo farlo adesso.  
*Remuzzi*: La legge Turco sulle cure compassionevoli devono essere già state autorizzate dalle autorità (quindi già in fase di sperimentazione animale/umana), o che possono essere utilizzate per altre applicazioni, o per pazienti gravi se la sperimentazione è in corso all'estero (ma tutto se hanno già ottenuto l'autorizzazione). Stamina non ha a che vedere con questa legge. Il comitato etico dell'ospedale di Brescia non aveva le informazioni per approvare la sperimentazione, eppure l'ha fatto, cosa completamente fuori legge.  
*Vannoni*: I giudici dicono il contrario, che il metodo applica la legge. Contrariamente alle affermazioni della dott. Lanfranchi, l'ospedale di Brescia ha tutti i documenti che servono per il metodo.  
*Remuzzi*: L'autorizzazione dell'AIFA non c'è, e serve sia quella dell'AIFA che dell'ISS. Lettera Dg. osp. Brescia: ""Abbiamo l'autorizzazione per le malattie ematologiche, possiamo usare quello?"" AIFA: ""Forse, vogliamo chiarimenti."". Il chiarimento è di tre righe, non di 50 pagine di dettagli come è consono. A questo punto stop dell'AIFA.  
*Spettatore post-intervista 1*: Non ci sono molti modi per sperimentare le cose in medicina.

**Estero:**  
Vannoni dice di non voler abbandonare l'Italia, ma di voler portare il suo metodo ovunque possibile.

**Money:**  
*Vannoni*: Finanziamenti nel 2008 bloccati, e al tempo la fondazione richiedeva un contributo a chi può. Ora metodo amministrato gratuitamente dall'ospedale di Brescia. Fondazione con sede a Torino, biologi fanno la preparazione cellulare, medici osp. Brescia fanno l'operazione. ~7 medici per raccolta dati e controllo. Dopo investimento iniziale di Vannoni, donazioni (non dai pazienti in cura o dai parenti, controllabile dai bonifici).",0,1388955897,null,0,1388956103,0,cei3iqr,t3_1uh22d,t1_cei3iqr,t1_cei01e5,null,1431812318,19,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,19

I live in Glasgow, which has its own dialect (called 'the Patter'), but it varies across class and geographical boundaries. There's no standard orthography for Scots, AFAIK. Even people who speak mainly in Scottish English will use a wide variety of characteristically Scottish words, e.g. outwith, ashet, snell, dreich, haar, braw, weans, weel kent etc. The pronunciation varies very noticeably across the country.

It is a pre-Indo-European language without a family (isolated language) surrounded entirely by Romance languages. The Basque language itself is divided into five different dialects (Western or *Biscayan* dialect, Central or *Guipuscoan* dialect, Navarrese dialect, Lapurdian dialect and Souletin dialect) plus the standard unified dialect known as ""Unified Basque"". There were more dialects, like the Alavese and Roncalese dialects, but they went extinct, the latter one in the early 90s. Every dialect has a ""regulated"" ortography, although when regulating the language most of the efforts go to the batua or ""standard"" dialect, which is the one taught in schools. 

Example:

* Josef Staribacher, former Minister of Economy has died at the age of 92. Staribacher, who was born in 1921, was interned as a socialist oppositional during the Austrofascist dictature and was kept for a year in the Buchenwald Concentration Camp during National Socialism. After the end of his sentence in 1941, he was used for military service, where he was wounded, leaving him unfit for service and allowing him to spend the rest of the war without any major harassment. After studying economics, he was employed at the Chamber of Labourers. In 1961, he was elected as a member of Parliament for the Social Democratic Party. In 1970, he became minister of Trade, Commerce and Industry under chancellor Bruno Kreisky. He held this position until the end of the Gouvernment Kreisky IV in 1983. His political actions were influenced by the so called Austro-Keynesianism. As a part of the Kreisky governments, he supported the expansion of the social security net, the easier access to education and the reduction of weekly worktime to 40 hours.

* The new Administrative courts have started working. These courts will decide over appeals against decisions of administrative authorities. Before these Administrative Courts were installed, the appeal stages led through the same authorities, that had made the decision in question.

It is yet unknown, why it is till possible to use the postal system for transporting bombs - it was not, that this possibility had not been abused before. 

* Despite protest, criticism and already appearing problems, a motorway is planned to be built in the eastern part of Vienna and the danube wetlands, which are protected as a national park. The costs are expected to be 2 billion €. Critics of this motorway argue, that the it would just induce more traffic into the town and attract transit traffic, while the planned costs would be more than enough to expand the town Tramway network and improve the railway network in the surrounding area.

* In the month of December, the number of accidents on railway crossings reached new levels. In one case, a car hit a train, that had come to stop on the crossing. The crossing signals worked failurless in each case. An inhonorable mention goes to the individual, that drove around the barrier at a crossing near Györ/Hungary and got stuck in the tracks. The driver escaped before his vehicle stood in the way of RJ 165 from Zurich to Budapest. The engine was set on fire by the collision, noone was injured in the train. The engine is expected to be a total loss. 

* The constitutional court is going to give the final verdict in the trial of a dove-breeders widow against the local hunters cooperative.

I think that most of French people are attached to ours institutions. Abstention rates are quite low concerning legislative and presidential elections for instance. From time to time, you have a debate around a hypothetic Sixth Republic, more democratic and closer to the electors. But you know, when the things are working good, there is no reason to change them.

Of course, our political system is not perfect. We can (and we have to) make some changes, especially in terms of conflict of interest, transparency, decentralization or the nature of the voting system (like the integration of proportional vote in the National Assembly). Currently, we don’t have the time or the political will to change these things now.

However, the reform of 2008 is already a big step, which is quite appreciated by the French. For instance, it allows citizens to submit a “Priority Question of Constitutionality” to the Constitutional Council during a trial in order to control the constitutionality of a law a posteriori. It’s a big enhancement, allowing citizens to control and revoke bad laws, according to the constitutional corpus. Thanks to it, the police custody (which didn’t allow formerly) the presence of the lawyer during the first hours or the psychiatric hospitalization without consent have been reformed.

Après le ""camp des gentils"" passe toute sa vie à argumenter là contre et on ne peut plus parler des autres sujets, sur lesquels ces mêmes extrémistes ont tout faux, parce qu'ils décident de l'agenda médiatique.

Prenez la Suisse, où je vis. On a l'UDC qui lance initiative sur initiative contre les étrangers. Interdire les minarets, expulser les fraudeurs aux assurances sociales automatiquement (et leurs familles peut-être), dénoncer les accords avec l'Europe parce qu'on trouve qu'il y a trop d'immigrés, etc. Chaque année on en a 1 ou 2 de ces propositions qui monopolisent le débat. Du coup c'est drôle, on a l'impression de couler dessous. On a beau expliquer, ils ont plus de sous et plus d'affiches, qui font plus peur, qui donnent pas trop  à réfléchir... et voilà.

true,SpaceRaccoon,null,null,"Whenever the nuclear aspect of the cold war is brought up, I like to bring up the interesting case of Samantha Smith. She was a young American girl who sent a letter to Yuri Andropov with the following: 
&gt;Dear Mr. Andropov,
My name is Samantha Smith. I am ten years old. Congratulations on your new job. I have been worrying about Russia and the United States getting into a nuclear war. Are you going to vote to have a war or not? If you aren't please tell me how you are going to help to not have a war. This question you do not have to answer, but I would like to know why you want to conquer the world or at least our country. God made the world for us to live together in peace and not to fight.
Sincerely,
Samantha Smith

But of course, that is not what any Soviet citizen or leader wanted, regardless of what Westerners knew about the USSR. I'm glad videos like this exist, to show the other perspective of the missile crisis, because here in the West it seems to be portrayed that the USSR was a deluded, sociopathic, and reckless aggressor. And so, I loved Andropov's reply to Samantha's letter, which showed that Americans and Soviets, capitalists and communists maybe aren't very different after all:
&gt;Dear Samantha,
I received your letter, which is like many others that have reached me recently from your country and from other countries around the world.
It seems to me – I can tell by your letter – that you are a courageous and honest girl, resembling Becky, the friend of Tom Sawyer in the famous book of your compatriot Mark Twain. This book is well known and loved in our country by all boys and girls.
You write that you are anxious about whether there will be a nuclear war between our two countries. And you ask are we doing anything so that war will not break out.
Your question is the most important of those that every thinking man can pose. I will reply to you seriously and honestly.
Yes, Samantha, we in the Soviet Union are trying to do everything so that there will not be war on Earth. This is what every Soviet man wants. This is what the great founder of our state, Vladimir Lenin, taught us.
Soviet people well know what a terrible thing war is. Forty-two years ago, Nazi Germany, which strove for supremacy over the whole world, attacked our country, burned and destroyed many thousands of our towns and villages, killed millions of Soviet men, women and children.
In that war, which ended with our victory, we were in alliance with the United States: together we fought for the liberation of many people from the Nazi invaders. I hope that you know about this from your history lessons in school. And today we want very much to live in peace, to trade and cooperate with all our neighbors on this earth—with those far away and those near by. And certainly with such a great country as the United States of America.
In America and in our country there are nuclear weapons—terrible weapons that can kill millions of people in an instant. But we do not want them to be ever used. That's precisely why the Soviet Union solemnly declared throughout the entire world that never—never—will it use nuclear weapons first against any country. In general we propose to discontinue further production of them and to proceed to the abolition of all the stockpiles on Earth.
It seems to me that this is a sufficient answer to your second question: 'Why do you want to wage war against the whole world or at least the United States?' We want nothing of the kind. No one in our country–neither workers, peasants, writers nor doctors, neither grown-ups nor children, nor members of the government–want either a big or 'little' war.
We want peace—there is something that we are occupied with: growing wheat, building and inventing, writing books and flying into space. We want peace for ourselves and for all peoples of the planet. For our children and for you, Samantha.
I invite you, if your parents will let you, to come to our country, the best time being this summer. You will find out about our country, meet with your contemporaries, visit an international children's camp – Artek – on the sea. And see for yourself: in the Soviet Union, everyone is for peace and friendship among peoples.
Thank you for your letter. I wish you all the best in your young life.
Y. Andropov

And on the differences between capitalist and communists or even milder socialists, the reason behind the cold war, I have come to feel that perhaps there is not much difference between them at all: many of both have similar goals. People want peace and prosperity, happiness and justice, but perhaps because of different circumstances and experiences, they believe they these goals must be achieved through different means. Maybe one day we will all just be able to get along, and focus on inventing things, writing books, and flying into space.

&gt; In the commune, at this time, everything was working very well. Even the centres in Europe were running beautifully. The last chapter of His dream had started. The Rajneesh Academy and a library building were already in the pipeline. Books were being published on schedule, festivals were being planned and then executed well. The controversies in the press and television were at an all-time high, and we were in the spotlight big time. New sources for donations were being discovered every day. But Bhagwan was not excited or happy. Perhaps everything was going on too well. He was getting bored. So one day, out of the blue, He demanded of me to get Him 30 new Rolls-Royces within one month. At this time He already had 96 brand new Rolls-Royces. Obviously He was only looking for entertainment.
&gt;
&gt; Thirty Rolls-Royces meant about three to four million dollars. We could have arranged this kind of money only by drastically reducing our operating budget...
&gt; 
&gt; This conflict threw me back to His teachings. ""If you have difficulties making a decision, choose the lesser of the two evils."" For me, in this case, that was refusing to get His new Rolls-Royces. When I told Him this, He became bad tempered. My refusal became yet one more reason for Him to procure these cars. He decided to change His tactics. Next day, I received a list from Him with 50 to 60 names. He asked me to invite these people to a meeting to take place the very next day in His living room. I immediately knew what He was up to when I saw the names of the people on that list. Most of them were quite rich. My heart sank...
&gt;
&gt; As expected, 21 people were declared enlightened. They were now a part of ""the inner circle"" that was to lead His commune and the Sannyasins after His death... But the agenda here was different: emptying pockets and accounts for 30 new Rolls-Royces. A large sum was at stake, and so the enticement had to be greater as well.

Three young people exist in a strange world of their parents' devising in this bizarre drama from writer and director Yorgos Lanthimos. A father and mother (Christos Stergioglou and Michele Valley) live in a large house on the outskirts of town with their three children, whose ages range from mid-teens to early twenties. The children have never been allowed to leave the house (which is surrounded by a tall fence), and their knowledge of the outside world has been strictly controlled by their parents, who have chosen to teach them only what they believe is important and have deliberately confused or misled them in many other areas. The parents quite literally treat their children like animals, and the only contact the youngsters have with people outside their family is Christina (Anna Kalaitzidou), a woman who works with the father's business and comes by periodically to have sex with the eldest son (Christos Passalis). Christina makes the mistake of bringing a present for the two younger daughters (Aggeliki Papoulia and Mary Tsoni), and explains the custom is that they should give her something in return. This simple act sets off a chain reaction of events that has terrible consequences for everyone involved.

true,kentuckyfriedmeerkat,UKGB,United Kingdom,"I live in North Staffordshire, England

Potteries dialect is largely dying out so I don't know too much about it or speak it. That said, for me probably the most noticeable differences are:

'Book', 'cook', 'took' etc. are, like some other northern English dialects, typically pronounced with the vowel from 'tool' rather than 'foot' (however I don't do this even though my mum does and most of my friends do)

There is no foot-strut split (think that's what it's called) so both of those words are pronounced using the vowel from 'foot'. Until recently I couldn't distinguish those sounds, they were identical in my head, and when I was a kid I wondered why Americans on TV paid for things with 'books'

There's more glottal stops replacing the 't' sound than standard English, like a lot of English dialects, but there's also 'r' sounds fulfilling the same purpose such as 'I've got a sandwich' seeming to often become like 'av gorra samwidge' which also occurs in other dialects/accents

I say 'bath' with the vowel from 'pack' instead of 'father' as do most people in the north of England - there's no distinction there although I recognised it occuring in other accents as a child because it's an obvious one you hear on TV all the time

Except for, as far as I can tell, the word-initial voiced 'th' in 'this', I tend to replace the voiceless and voiced 'th' sounds with 'f' and 'v' sounds respectively such as 'bath' becoming 'baff', 'think' becoming 'fink'

'ing' like a lot of English accents becomes 'in'' like 'going' becomes 'goin''

I seem to tend to drop 'to' from phrases such as 'going to do' or 'going to the...', for example 'I'm going to eat a sandwich' or 'I'm going to the shop' (which often probably just becomes 'I'm going shop')

Crappy examples I know, but I'm too tired to think of anything more/write coherently and I can't do IPA symbols on my phone.

&gt; I don't think I used words that could have offended you in some way. And I don't think I said anything to give you the impression that I'm trying to change your writing style or that I'm incredibly bothered by it. But it can be interpreted as showing off, or at least that's the way I interpreted it.

I'm going to assume that English is not your first language, because if you're being serious right now, there is a serious cultural misunderstanding concerning the tone of your posts. Your English is excellent, so I apologize if it is, in fact, your native language. The fact is that your previous two comments are written in a way that can be easily interpreted as very patronizing.

What really triggered my defensive reaction was your use of ""bub"" and ""pal"" to end sentences. This comes off as *incredibly* patronizing  in English. I know this is not true in every language, but in English, one generally does this only to children. It's literally **patr**onizing, because ""bub"" and ""pal"" are nicknames that dads commonly use for their kids. Using these nicknames with people who you don't know very well comes off as belittling. In the previous comment, your sarcastic quip about the world coming to an end was also very dismissive, so I interpreted it as maliciously funny instead of simply flippant.

I apologize if I misinterpreted your comments and you were not, in fact, deliberately being an asshole. But I do stand by my interpretation as not being without basis.

And I like using foreign words when discussing foreign topics because sometimes the translations aren't what you might necessarily think. If you are learning German and want to talk about the ""states"" of Germany, you shouldn't say *Staaten*, despite the fact that that is a perfectly fine translation of ""states,"" and if you were talking about the states of the USA, then you would use *Staaten*. But if you're talking about German states, you should be talking about *Länder*. You see what I'm getting at? The occasional usage of foreign terms makes language learning easier and doesn't seem to confuse conversation that much in the language of conversation.

Eh...I'll clarify. I meant I wouldn't waste my time on them. I agree a green agenda is a good thing, but I don't trust the Greens to forward one. 

&gt; there was a huge fear of a massive economic calamity. They pulled it safely and responsibly in my view. 

There was a massive economic calamity in spite of anything they did; I don't accept they averted anything. I'm not going to try and convince you the bailout was a bad idea, but I hold that the banks should have collapsed. Even if I believed the official propaganda that Ireland would be worse off if the banks had collapsed (Iceland is doing okay following their banks collapsing), I still be opposed because in principle I reject the notion than every man woman and child in Ireland should be handed a bill of over 100,000 euro for the incompetence of the bankers and the political party in bed with them. If you're in favour of the bailout and the Greens, fair enough. I believe the bailout itself was unforgivable and I couldn't ever see myself voting for them again.

&gt;But in a coalition, compromises must be made.

I wish Fine Gael agreed. Government policy is 90% FG 10% Labour when it should be at least 60:40. Socially, Labour TDs almost universally voted against abortion legislation and for all the talk about secularisation, they're doing nothing. If they do nothing important they should have remained in opposition. Labour is what it is and always has been: A mildly left-wing, socially moderate alternative to the civil-war parties for affluent intellectuals and the urban middle-class. I guess I was naive to think all they needed to grow some backbone was real power. I'd sooner vote for FG than Labour; at least FG don't present themselves as the party of social progress. Labour looks nice on paper, but in practice they're remarkable for their ability to achieve nothing and believe in nothing beyond woolly notions of prosperity and social justice.

I'd vote for anyone to keep FF out of parliament. SF....well, they're solidly social-democratic without being socialist, they're in favour of full secularisation, they were the only major party opposed to the bailout and in recent years they've toned down the nationalism. It's shocking because it's SF, a party in 2007 I vowed to never vote for, but I find their policies are by far the best, and while they have shown themselves to be able to compromise they also refuse to bend over backwards or forwards for others.

Getting back to the original thread title, I wouldn't vote SF in EU elections because they're anti-EU, but I would probably give them my vote in a general election.",0,1388965937,null,0,1388966237,0,cei8b6s,t3_1ue29f,t1_cei8b6s,t1_cei00sh,null,1431814547,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

For some reason it's considered ugly and some Finns even pretend it's difficult to understand. That's complete BS of course, since Standard Finnish itself is an artificial compromise language based on both western and eastern dialects. At first, the written Finnish was based completely on Turku (or South-Western) dialect, and only in the 19th century it was modernized with some eastern Finnish components. So in a way modern Finnish was a made up language no one originaly spoke, but every Finn could understand.


That being said, my dialect is even more heavily influenced by Swedish than Standard Finnish is (and that's a lot). Also, out of all the Finnish dialects, the South-Western ones (including Turku dialect) have most in common with the Estonian language. 

Here's a funny ad featuring a stereotypical speaker of Turku dialect: (in Finnish, naturally)

That reason being that most Catholics (and most protestants) in Northern Ireland are fine, good people who do not deserve to be forced out of their country. It's discrimination by religion. The fact that it is a bad idea is *not* a reason for not discussing it. How do you know an idea is bad until you've discussed it and thought it though? At first the idea of euthanasia or rehabilitation instead of punishment in the justice system sounds silly to me at first, but once I think about it more critically I realise they're good ideas *because I thought them through*.

3. I agree. And so does the government of Margaret Thatcher. But they wouldn't be agreeing with you unless they'd have thought it threw carefully, which they did do and as a result made the right decision. 

You're criticising me as if I'm saying it's a good idea. I'm not. I'm saying it's a good idea to discuss things and think them threw. Are you arguing that we shouldn't discuss ideas and think them through? I doubt that you are and I'd ask that you understand my position in the same way I understand yours.

Mi sa che non ti sono chiari i termini del problema; Arrow assume che ogni votante abbia una gerarchia di preferenze, e che si cerchi una gerarchia globale che soddisfi un certo numero di criteri **usando solamente le gerarchie degli elettori**, e dimostra che una gerarchia siffatta non esiste, per cui qualunque sistema si usi per produrla non si puo' avere successo.

Provo a farti un esempio diverso: il [range voting](http://rangevoting.org/RangeVoting.html) permette ad ogni elettore di assegnare un punteggio ad ogni candidato, vince il candidato con il punteggio piu' alto. Da un certo punto di vista assegnare un punteggio sembra equivalente a fare una graduatoria, ma non lo e': e' possibile cambiare un punteggio e determinare un cambio della graduatoria globale senza cambiare la propria graduatoria, per cui il teorema di Arrow non si applica (il risultato del sistema di voto non dipende solamente dall'ordine relativo delle preferenze degli elettori, ma anche dal punteggio).

Il plurality puo' essere visto anche come un caso degenere di range voting (una versione diffusa del range voting e' quando si puo' votare per al massimo 3 o 4 candidati), ma non si puo' cambiare il risultato della votazione senza cambiare la propria gerarchia di preferenze (votando per qualcun'altro e mettendolo in cima alla lista) quindi il teorema si applica.

The main accusation against Carol II is of abusing his powers as a constitutional monarch: initially through manipulation of the political parties (1930-1938), then openly overthrowing the democratic system and instituting a personal dictatorship (1938-1940).

His hands-on approach eventually turned against him: he was blamed for failing to act in any way during the year 1940 while Romania lost about 1/3 of its territory to claims by its neigbours.

On a personal level he's seen as a reckless playboy: he eloped with a commoner in the last months of WWI, then, in 1925, abandoned his second wife, princess Helen, for another liaison with a Jewish (the horror!) adventuress.

Michael I, the child of Carol II and princess Helen, ruled as a simple figurehead from 1940 to 1944, during Romania's involvement in WWII as an ally of Nazi Germany.

In August 1944, as the Red Army was penetrating the front in NE Romania, Michael I staged a palace coup against wartime leader, general Ion Antonescu, issued a ceasefire, and announced the acceptance of an Allied armistice, on extremely harsh terms imposed by the Soviets.

His action in 1944 is seen by some as a unnecessary capitulation in front of the Soviets, and as a betrayal of the German ally.

For the rest of his reign (1945-1947), Michael was again just a figurehead, this time for the pro-Soviet government of Romania.

One of the ways I see the royal family is as a sort of fail safe against a Nazi Germany situation. 

Anyway, the federal president of Germany is more than simply a fail safe. He is a political figure and he makes decisions more often than the Queen. If all goes well the Queen and later King Charles should never have to make a decision (apart from the decision to comply with the PM) however part of the German system requires the political consent of the president which can't be counted upon, where as the consent of the monarch always can be (unless you're Hitler). 

As for them both being ""ceremonial"" I think that's more to them being 'figure heads' in that they embody the spirit of the people and act as a representative of the people in a more spiritual way than the elected head of government (prime minister or federal chancellor) does. 

The royal family supposed to show leadership to families around the country, where as the PM is supposed to be lead by the people's wishes.

But to answer the question in its intended sense: I've spent half my life in Australia and half in the UK, with time in Canada and Ireland. Effectively, I have the South Australian vowel phonology with vowel values closer to Southern British English, along with L-vocalisation, flapping and glottal stops.

Grammatically, the only real differences I notice from people around me are that British English seems to allow/require

""have you got any sausages you want cooked?""

or something else entirely.

That is what worried/worries me about Marseilles. As interesting as it is, it didn't seem as safe as some other cities. 


So far I've been to Aix, Paris, the Loire Valley, and a few other places in the South. I'd love to spend some more time in the North, but I think I'd also do lots of day trips to areas around Cannes or Nice. 


I think renting a car is a good idea. I'd probably take a train to Switzerland/Germany, but for going around the country driving is probably best. I'll definitely go to Fréjus-St Raphaël! It looks beautiful. In particular, I'd like to visit Normandy (I know it's on the opposite side of the country, haha) and Loire again, briefly. I also would like to visit the sites of various WWI battles, as it's very interesting and important to me.

King Michael's coup is a pretty divisive and politically-charged subject in Romania.

Germany is seen in this situation not so much as ""The Nazis"", but as the only ally who stood by Romania's side against the Soviet occupation of [Bessarabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_Bessarabia_and_Northern_Bukovina) (aka Moldova). Of course this is false, because the 1940 Soviet ultimatum came as a direct consequence of the 1939 [Soviet-Nazi Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ribbentrop-Molotov.svg) (but these protocols were secret at the time). What is true though is that none of the traditional western allies of Romania did or say anything before or after the war to support us, and, ultimately, did nothing to obstruct the imposition of a brutal dictatorship by the Soviets.

Also, the Germans are seen as a wartime comrade-in-arms, and it's seen as dishonorable to abandon them in a difficult situation.

The classic view, and the one which many--including me--embrace, is that king Michael did what was possible in a very tight spot, when his options were very limited, and acted in the best interest of the country.

The revisionist view, though, is different. Beside viewing the capitulation as unnecessary (Romania should have obtained better terms, or maybe kept fighting etc.), they see king Michael as an enabler of the Soviet post-war occupation.

I've had this conversation with Poles, Lithuanians, Czechs, etc. before, and my question is: what could we have done? What could we possibly have done? Were we expected to, upon reaching the Elbe after shipping our troops 3000 miles across an ocean and meeting our erstwhile allies who did the lion's share of the work in grinding the enemy down to nothing, immediately declare war on those erstwhile allies and try to roll them back across the European plain?

No one could accuse me of sympathy for the Soviets, and in all honesty, I wish that we lived in a world in which the Soviets had allowed the legitimate prewar governments to return unmolested, and not rearranged the borders and governments of Central and Eastern Europe.

This alienation, this gulf of mistrust—greater than any I have encountered anywhere else in the world, including in the black townships of South Africa during the apartheid years](http://www.city-journal.org/html/12_4_the_barbarians.html)

""That is one of the reasons that, when I approached groups of young men in Les Musiciens, many of them were not just suspicious (though it was soon clear to them that I was no member of the enemy), but hostile. When a young man of African origin agreed to speak to me, his fellows kept interrupting menacingly. “Don’t talk to him,” they commanded, and they told me, with fear in their eyes, to go away. The young man was nervous, too: he said he was afraid of being punished as a traitor. His associates feared that “normal” contact with a person who was clearly not of the enemy, and yet not one of them either, would contaminate their minds and eventually break down the them-and-us worldview that stood between them and complete mental chaos. They needed to see themselves as warriors in a civil war, not mere ne’er-do-wells and criminals.""

""No one should underestimate the danger that this failure poses, not only for France but also for the world. The inhabitants of the cités are exceptionally well armed. When the professional robbers among them raid a bank or an armored car delivering cash, they do so with bazookas and rocket launchers, and dress in paramilitary uniforms. From time to time, the police discover whole arsenals of Kalashnikovs in the cités. There is a vigorous informal trade between France and post-communist Eastern Europe: workshops in underground garages in the cités change the serial numbers of stolen luxury cars prior to export to the East, in exchange for sophisticated weaponry.

A profoundly alienated population is thus armed with serious firepower; and in conditions of violent social upheaval, such as France is in the habit of experiencing every few decades, it could prove difficult to control. The French state is caught in a dilemma between honoring its commitments to the more privileged section of the population, many of whom earn their livelihoods from administering the dirigiste economy, and freeing the labor market sufficiently to give the hope of a normal life to the inhabitants of the cités. Most likely, the state will solve the dilemma by attempts to buy off the disaffected with more benefits and rights, at the cost of higher taxes that will further stifle the job creation that would most help the cité dwellers.

true,Dzukian,UNSA,United States of America,"Well, you might be getting a lot of negative votes because you're trying to put a positive spin on genocide. The deliberate, systematic killing of a specific ethnic/religious group is generally seen as evil and never necessary. And the reason your argument for genocide doesn't work is precisely because it *is* never necessary, because restive minorities can always be moved, instead of being killed.

Now, ethnic cleansing, you don't have to try hard to get people on board to support that. Almost all the Germans were ethnically cleansed from Eastern Europe after World War II. How many Czechs do you know that support the repatriation of the Sudetendeutsch? How many Poles are in favor of turning Wrocław back into Breslau? Do you think there are many Russians who think, ""you know, it was unkind to kick the Germans out of Kaliningrad, we should let them all come back?"" And more recently, how many Croats think that the majority of Serbs expelled from that country should be let back in?

All of those countries, after years of war, expelled minorities who were making separatist or irredentist claims on them. And now, they don't have any trouble with that separatist or irredentist group any more. Problem solved! And since none of these countries has really had to pay any price, internationally-speaking, for these expulsions, governments see it as an acceptable long-term solution.

If you have a restive minority, you can look at Britain or Israel, who try to deal with the minority that's already there, while favoring your own group to the best of your ability, and they receive highly negative criticism for decades and decades. Or, you can look on the other side at the Czech Republic or Croatia, and see that after some temporary awkwardness, the rest of the world has moved on. Occasionally some Germans of Serbs will raise the issue, but world says, ""it's in the past: you should move on,"" and no real harm is done to the expelling country.

The fact is that the international community has a short memory, and ethnic cleansing has become a forgivable offense.

That's an economic cliche, from the end of ww2 to the 70's the US enjoyed enormous prosperity and had a top tax rate of 91% dwindling down to 70%. The idea that lower taxes create growth was popularised by Regan and Thatcher, but it doesn't make it true.

true,GeeJo,UKGB,British Expat,"* [Trollhunter](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740707/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), a ""found footage""-style monster flick, with a documentary film crew stumbling across one of the last government-sponsored troll-hunters in rural Norway. Sort of like Cloverfield, only without quite as much nausea-inducing shaky-cam (still a little, but not as much).

* [The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele Blanc-Sec](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179025/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) is something of a French version of Lemony Snicket. Typically Luc Besson.

* [Beautiful Lies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1529569/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) A hairdresser re-mails an anonymous love letter sent to her to her mother in the hopes of perking her up. It works a little too well - she wants more of them. Funny and endearing.

* [Monsters](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1470827/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) An interesting, slightly eerie film. What happens when you just give up fighting the alien monsters and just wall them off where they won't bother you any more? Don't go in thinking it's Pacific Rim, that's not the point of it.

* [The Intouchables](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/?ref_=nv_sr_1). If you haven't seen this, go out and get it *right now*. There's a reason that it's the second-best-selling French language film of all time.

* [[Rec]](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1038988/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3), another ""found footage"" film, this time a straight horror. One of the better zombie movies I've seen recently. If you've seen the American remake, you don't really need to see this - it's quite similar (though the original is a bit more *raw*).

* [Rust and Bone](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2053425/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) is a slow-burning drama / slice of life film. It's not going to get you majorly excited or worked up, but it's a solid all-round film.

If you're looking for series, [Attack on Titan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2560140/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) is probably one of the most Western-accessible anime series of the past few years.

true,yogavidya,earth,,"""Solo yoga o anche meditazione"", espressione che peraltro sento spesso, è una domanda cui non mi sento di rispondere semplicemente si o no, perché in questo caso ne riconoscerei implicitamente un presupposto che invece ritengo errato.

Mi spiego: lo yoga (e parlo dello yoga classico che patanjali descrive come  raja yoga - lo yoga reale, o ashtanga yoga - lo yoga dalle otto membra, da non confondere con il marchio commerciale moderno) è meditazione in ogni suo aspetto - di più, è un percorso il cui scopo è quello di trasformare una vita intera in un atto meditativo, e fare questo tramite strumenti concreti e realistici: una sorta di pragmatica scienza dell'interiorità.

In questo senso, alla domanda ""pratichi solo yoga o anche meditazione"" non mi sento di rispondere si o no, appunto.

Capisco comunque che, nel parlare comune, si intende per meditazione fondamentalmente la meditazione seduta, quella che i giapponesi chiamano zazen per intenderci. A questo riguardo la risposta è si, la pratico. 

E qui arriva un'altra domanda cui non posso rispondere direttamente perché parte da presupposti che voglio discutere. La domanda è: nel caso, quali tecniche?  La risposta è: la tecnica della meditazione, quando l'esperienza si approfondisca a sufficienza, non è riconducibile ad un'etichetta o marchio o comunque semplicemente schematizzabile, per parecchie ragioni. Una delle ragioni è che la meditazione è ricerca, e che gli strumenti e le tecniche non solo si affinano, ma si ridefiniscono nel corso della ricerca. Trovo, in questo senso, impensabile l'idea di praticare con rigidità un metodo - se succedesse, significherebbe che la persona non sta meditando.

Un'altra delle ragioni è che il mio metodo è estremamente personale, e non mi sento di descriverlo usando un'etichetta semplice, anche perché in me il sospetto che le etichette aprano la strada al commercio è sempre vivissimo.

Una terza ragione, infine, è il fatto che la meditazione profonda porta la coscienza ad esplorare domini della psiche che sono pre-verbali, cioè a fare esperienza della mente a prescindere dalla parola: ed in questi spazi la parola non si deve avventurare.

Fatta questa (pesante, ahimé) premessa, ti dico brevemente che la mia tecnica abituale si basa sull'ancorare l'attenzione a tre punti focali: equilibrio della colonna, naturalezza del respiro e ripetizione interna di un mantra a tempo col respiro per bloccare il pensiero verbale. La meditazione è ciò che accade quando questa messa a fuoco sia mantenuta abbastanza a lungo, e non è descrivibile a chi non ne abbia esperienza personale e diretta.

The laws are crafted by politicians who have everything to gain and nothing to lose and are bought and paid for by those with money. The judges are then appointed by politicians so there is yet another opportunity for there to be corruption.

Then, once a politician is out of office, he/she will write a book, assume some corporate job that pays through the nose and they wield power. They shield their company from taxes, oversight, accountability, etc. 

Think of the current situation with the American Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare). The idea is good, it is noble. Yet the law is so poorly written that it boggles the mind. Companies got the members of the congress they had bought and paid for to carve out exceptions, to preserve their power to profit to an obscene degree off of the misfortune of citizens. It is symptomatic of a government which is unable to govern in any meaningful manner. The same situation can be seen in other advanced nations as well, not merely the US (look at Canada and the destruction of databases, collections, knowledge because the ruling party finds it inconvenient or otherwise at odds with their ideological position). 

That is why I think that perhaps a monarchy with some power might be worthwhile. Should a the normal political process break down beyond repair there will be one person the public can direct their anger at. One person who will suffer in the form of shame, loss of power and prestige or even his/her life...and the lives of their family. This one person who has a vested interest in making sure the whole system works and who is given the power to ensure that it can happen. 

Basically, a sort of ancient Roman ideal of the dictator who is empowered to solve the immediate crisis at hand. A sort of Cincinnatus for the modern day.

Old Norse also had a very strong influence on the dialect, and this can be seen through many of the place names.

Although Cumbria is the third largest county in England, it was formed in 1972 so the dialect of Cumbrian comes more from the north of the modern day county, what was known as Cumberland.

The dialect is not so much spoken any more, and in the south of the county, where I am from, it is virtually non-existent, although there is a distinct Barrovian way of speaking (I am not from Barrow though!).

So how does Cumbrian differ? Well it's nothing like English, really.

ars garn yam = I am going home.

Day-to-day, when I am home, I would hear certain Cumbrian words, such as the numbers and, if out at night, often ars garn yam. I believe it is more prevalent in the North.

Melvyn Bragg, an author from north Cumbria and writer of several books, including *The Adventures of English* discusses Cumbrian as he grew up speaking it.  He is from Carlisle, at the top of Cumbria.

He writes about how, in WW2, there were British soldiers in Iceland and they had no clue about Icelandic. All the British, except some Cumbrians, who, through their knowledge of Cumbrian due to the Old Norse influence and because Icelandic is an old language that has not changed greatly from Old Norse (I am no expert in Iceland, but I believe this is evident in the use of the thorn ('Þ'), which in now a 'th' in English).

true,waterfuck,TRAN,Transylvania,"""Transyvanian"" isn't considered a Romanian dialect because is very similar to Romanian but there are some differences. Also, is only spoken in northern Transylvania above the Tarnava Mare river. 

We say ""no"" which is an interjection that basically means everything. (it's not a negation). It can mean ""so"" sometimes. ""Ni"" which means ""look!"" and it's ""uite!"" in Romanian. 

I am is ""eu sunt” in Romanian but ""io îs"" in Transylvania. He is is el e(Romanian) but el îi(Transylvania). To go is ""a merge"" in Romanian but a mere in Transylvania(yet at first person is the same conjugation ""eu merg"" in both at the second person a guy from Bucharest would say ""tu mergi"" a guy from Cluj would say ""tu meri"".). To eat is also conjugated differently( Eu mânânc/ Eu mânc, el mânâncă/ el mâncă). Bread also has a different Transylvanian cousin in Romanian pită instead of the correct pâine. 


Musai is must in Transylvania and in Romanian is trebuie but we usually use trebuie or tre in Transylvania. Some regional words that mostly old people still use like ”făgădău” for bar, ""cătană"" for soldier etc.

Some words we use differently I've discovered because of my friends from the south like bathtub (vană for me and cadă for them), swing (hintă for me and leagăn for them) and a few more.  

And of course the accent, we have sounds which don't exist in Romanian like the french è when it's a Romanian e at the end of a word or a ""ea"" at the end of a word and a strange o (which I think is found in Hungarian but I don't know which one is it because Hungarian has too many o's) instead of the Romanian combination oa which should be read in Romanian o a. Ni is also read strangely a bit like in Hungarian.

The difference between the two is that the extreme right has no real political clout nowadays and barely any support within the mainstream. For the far left however, things unfortunately look a little different: it has quite a few supporters in the Die Grünen / LINKE parties and even the SPD. Some of the more prominent political players of those parties belonged to these shithead stone-throwers and ""Autonome"" back in the day, so the indirect or even direct endorsement of leftist violence and terror is no real surprise.

What these people don't realize or don't care about, is that both far-right and far-left extremism just wind each other up, which makes things worse. There is no place for extremism or anti-democratic and violent behaviour in Germany, no matter where on the political spectrum you come from.

Sounds like straight out of the mouth of some CDU press person, well done.

&gt;while the stinking Antifa vandalizes some cars or destroys a couple of storefronts because ""muh capitalism"".

**the** Antifa .. yea no.
&gt;The difference between the two is that the extreme right has no real political clout nowadays and barely any support within the mainstream.

Are you seeing the same mainstream as I am?  
Like the one with raising xenophobic tone, the one where refugees are treated like shit, the one where it's cool to say that ""Deutschland schafft sich ab"" and other thinly veiled racist bullshit?

&gt;For the far left however, things unfortunately look a little different: it has quite a few supporters in the Die Grünen / LINKE parties and even the SPD.

Meanwhile, in Hamburg, the SPD has created a ""Gefahrenzone"" and controls perople because of 2 supposed attacks on a police station.  
There's also the LINKE which, on their party conference some years back, decided that not capitalism itself, but the banking sector is the problem - that's like the opposite viewpoint compared to **the** AntiFa.

&gt;Some of the more prominent political players of those parties belonged to these shithead stone-throwers and ""Autonome"" back in the day, so the indirect or even direct endorsement of leftist violence and terror is no real surprise.

This is incredibly unlikely.  There's pretty sophisticated statistical fingerprinting techniques that processor manufacturers use to ensure their chips aren't being tampered with.  The major processor manufacturers are also moving to having processors ""phone home"" the first time they are powered on at the factory before they can be used properly, to get a unique key for further operation.  All this was developed to circumvent the bigger concern for processor manufacturers: Asian fabs running unauthorised night shifts off the clock and manufacturing thousands of unauthorised Intel or AMD processors which they then sell themselves.

For example, the *[Haydarpaşa Terminal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haydarpa%C5%9Fa_Terminal)* in Istanbul is still called the *German Station* to this day. There's no such conflict between China and the US today.

At the start of the 20th century the British fleet undermined its own dominance with the new Dreadnought battleships. During the century before the Dreadnought challenging the British fleet was nearly impossible. The Dreadnought however was copied by Russia, Germany, Japan, the US, ... . The Dreadnought made the previous generations of ships worthless in battle and introduced tough potential enemies for the British fleet where there were none before.

Particularly, the Dreadnought escalated the *fleet in being* deterrent. Since British ships could not longer be assumed to outnumber or outgun adversary battleships - particularly because at the start of the 20th century the British Empire had dominions across the globe - this inhibited the power of the British Empire significantly. This is best illustrated by the [Battle of Jutland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jutland) and earlier [Battle of Tsushima](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tsushima) between Russia and Japan.

Before the Dreadnoughts Western powers could sail to any part of the globe and play our their dominance however it wanted (see for example the [Opium Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_Wars)). After the Dreadnoughts that projection of power was no longer guaranteed. Where before Britain and France could stay clear of one another across the globe the Dreadnoughts steered both powers on a collision course with the new challengers: the US, Germany, Japan and Russia.

What intrigues me is that Dutch people are suddenly awake at the discrimination of women by (some) Muslims, and yet still manage to blissfully ignore the equally blatant sexism of the ""[zwarte-kousen](http://www.expatica.com/de/news/news_focus/Calvin_s-_true-heirs_-prosper-in-Dutch-Bible-Belt-_15034.html)"".

This has nothing to do with thinly veiled racist bullshit, but with logic and reason. Even the most brain-dead person should realize, that a flood of poverty immigrants does no good to Germany and it's society as a whole. Large scale poverty immigration will raise havoc on our social systems, education system and cultural cohesion. There are more than 2.5 billion people living under the poverty line, we have neither the place nor the money to take them all in.

&gt;There's also the LINKE which, on their party conference some years back, decided that not capitalism itself, but the banking sector is the problem - that's like the opposite viewpoint compared to the AntiFa.

Of course, the LINKE has to stay relevant somehow. [In reality a large part of them would like to institute communism](http://www.die-linke.de/nc/die_linke/nachrichten/detail/artikel/kommunismus-auch-unser-langfristiges-ziel/), but they know very well, that that shit wouldn't fly with the general population, so they focus on what they deem the worst part of capitalism (the banking sector) for now.

Unfortunately these dumbasses don't realise that capitalism and free trade are the very things that led to our wealth and status as a first world nation and are currently transforming other nations from wide-spread poverty to industrialism and beyond, to first world nations like us. It's far from perfect, but still much better than instituting communism and violent socialist redistribution, which has led to some of humanities worst atrocities in the past.

&gt;Interesting. Say, what about Vorratsdatenspeicherung? Isn't that anti-democratic?

No, why would it be?

&gt;As you can see, the definition of what is ""anti-democratic"" is completely up in the open, free for definition.

I don't see that at all. I see a clear definition of anti-democratic behavior as something that wants to undermine the democratically elected state leaders and their politics with violence and other unlawful acts of terrorism. You know, like Neo-Nazis and Antifa/Autonome scum.

Perchè il punto fondamentale è che vince A anche se la maggioranza degli elettori preferisce B ad A, mentre basta preferire B anche a C per far vincere B. Questo è vero solo se decidi di rappresentare così la realtà (che non è cosa banale, visto che si cerca di far rappresentare la vitavera con la matematica degli scienziati politici). Se invece consideri che per la maggioranza degli elettori B e C sono merda uguale (a cui dare valore 0), un eventuale cambio di ranking relativo imporrebbe un cambio di ranking assoluto.

Provo a spiegarmi:

* passare da A&gt;B&gt;C a B&gt;A&gt;C significa che il ranking tra B e C non è cambiato, solo quello tra A e B.
* passare da A&gt;(B=C) a B&gt;(A=C) dove il primo *vale* 1 e gli altri 0, implica un cambio radicale di ranking relativo tra B e C (per cui l'IIA non si applica).

&gt;Qui la politica non c'entra niente, si tratta di matematica e basta.

true,globaltyler,GERM,Germany until further notice,"Of course I am generalizing a bit. But the circle of people influencing the senile Hindenburg in the final years of Weimar republic wanted democracy to fail. They abused the emergency powers of the Reichspräsident to create the ""Präsidialkabinette"" of 1929 onwards (governments Brüning, von Papen, von Schleicher and Hitler were all without a majority in the Reichstag, but they did not govern like a minority government, those governments ruled by ""Notverordnungen"", emergency decrees that were signed by the Reichspräsident and became law without parliament agreeing. They could be declared invalid by parliament as countermeasure but then again the president could dissolute parliament with a stroke of his pen, that was a real error in the German constitution of 1919, it made the Reichspräsident a kind of replacement-Kaiser)

Now those guys behind Hindenburg (von Papen for instance was a member of the ""Deutscher Herrenclub"", today we would call it a lobbying association or a think tank, all members were big business, bankers, wealthy land owners or high government officials, that club wanted to ""stop communism"" by changing the constitution and the voting system so that the wealthy would have more influence and their vote would count more, just like in Prussia before the end of WW1), their goal was nothing less than the destruction of democracy for their own profit. There is a picture of Hindenburg surrounded by von Papen, von Schleicher and other people that really shows the influence those people had, sadly I can't find it only right now.

With the ""Preussenschlag"" of 1932 von Papen had already dissolved the state government in Prussia which was a social democratic government. Prussia was from then on ruled by a ""Reichskommissar"", a government official from the central government. Prussia which equalled ~2/3 of German territory was from then on de facto ruled by the Reichskanzler. German federalism as counterbalance to the central government basically did not exist any longer. And since the police force was organised by the federal states, the prussian police force was now also under control of the Reichskanzler. When Hitler was appointed Reichskanzler, he put Göhring in charge of the Prussian police by appointing him as ""Reichskommissar des Inneren für Preussen"", commissary interior minister for Prussia. Thanks to von Papen the Nazis were able to build their Gestapo from the political division of Prussian police.

The people like von Papen etc. needed Hitler and his votes to change the constitution because their own parties (DNVP etc) would never get enough seats to reach the 2/3 majority needed.

That's also the **TL;DR** - they could not just invite the Kaiser back because they only were in power because of the state of emergency powers of the Reichspräsident *granted by the constitution* which also stated that Germany was a republic. They did not have the popular basis to stage a coup against the republic and they would not have done so because the constitution (and their abuse of the powers within) was what kept them in power. The only way for them was a vote to change the constitution and they somehow hoped for the votes from NSDAP. **End TL;DR**

Which was retarded because Hitler had his own agenda and it should have been clear to people that he wouldn't do the bidding of others. But it made the ""Machtergreifung"" possible, which otherwise might not even have happened. NSDAP had peaked in votes in July 1932 but had lost votes again in November 1932. And before the coup in Prussia, Prussia had since 1920 been ruled by a stable great coalition of social democrats and some of the conservatives, contrary to what it was made after WW2, Prussia was actually helping democracy, it had escaped a lot of the turmoil that the central government faced, until 1932 when the excuse of a riot was used for that coup. Without the actions of guys like von Papen (he survived WW2 and got to publish 2 books afterwards trying to shift the blame to other people, namely to von Schleicher who was killed during the 1934 ""Röhm-Putsch"" and could not defend himself) the Machtergreifung would not have been possible like this.

Because the Machtergreifung was a coup d'etat done in an orderly fashion, it was all somehow in the letter of the constitution. A violent coup by the Nazis would have been opposed a lot more as it had been in Munich 1923 when Hitler first tried a coup against the state of Bavaria.

They write software models of the processor and blast example machine code programs at the two models.  Semiconductor companies are *the* largest employer of formal methods researchers after academia, and they develop sophisticated tools and technologies to ensure their processors are not being tampered with.  They know full well both the intended behaviour and the intended design of the processor before sending it off to be manufactured *en masse*.  They also manufacture their processors at multiple sites, both in the West and in the East.  If all else fails, they can simply randomly select processors after manufacture and examine the dies under the microscope to spot any sort of tampering.  Extra circuitry, or divergence from the design, is pretty easy to spot.

To accept the claim that China has backdoored ""all the chips it exports"" you have to first swallow the idea that processor manufacturers are ridiculously lax in their management of the manufacturing process.  That's clearly not the case.  They pay particularly close attention to the manufacturing process as they don't want unauthorised processors being manufactured outwith the licensing agreement they've made with the fab, and they also don't want to be on the hook for a product recall if something goes wrong, like they were with the FDIV bug.

Further, for really critical pieces of infrastructure, companies are not buying components off the shelf and just slapping them into satellites or fighter planes without actually examining the components themselves, as this example demonstrates.  Companies, especially aerospace and military companies, are also extremely conservative in the hardware they are using: old, well understood hardware that's been ""battle tested"" is preferred over flashy multiprocessors with weird memory models and relatively poorly understood concurrency behaviour.  Relatively old version of the PowerPC architecture are still used in satellites, for example.  BAE Systems' RAD750 radiation and temperature strengthened PowerPC 750 (PowerPC 750 was released ~2001) unit is widely used --- it powered NASA's Curiosity Rover, launched in 2011, for example.  That hardware also has a high chance of being manufactured in the West itself for critical infrastructure.  The RAD750 is manufactured in America under supervision by BAE.

Let's turn it around: if the United States cannot sneak a backdoor into a spy satellite supplied to the United Arab Emirates without being spotted, what makes you think China can do the same to e.g. Germany or the UK, two states that are critically aware of the possibility of a backdoor being slipped in to their military hardware/diplomatic encryption systems and fund masses of research in how to prevent it, or your native USA?  You think the likes of GCHQ, the NSA, and so on, let alone the processor manufacturers themselves, are incapable of spotting if the entirety of the processor stock, or a good percentage of it, being exported from China was completely compromised?",0,1389006606,null,0,1389026048,0,ceimeoo,t3_1ugwgj,t1_ceimeoo,t1_ceimam6,null,1431821391,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

It's actually written as ""a"" :)

Some of the features of the dialect are exemplified: [main Transylvanian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transylvanian_varieties_of_Romanian), [Maramureş subdialect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maramure%C8%99_subdialect_of_Romanian) and [Crişana subdialect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cri%C8%99ana_subdialect_of_Romanian).

And yes, a lot of dialectal features as well as regional vocabulary are due to Hungarian (and to a way lesser extent German) influence. ""Ni"" for example is the imperative ""Né"" from the Hungarian verb ""nézni"" (to look).

&gt;We say ""no"" which is an interjection that basically means everything. (it's not a negation)

I'm sorry for the ad hominem. You were saying that we should *decree* that an EU-state is the goal and do what is necessary to get there... but that's totally contrary to the premise of the project. Everybody needs to agree every step of the way. Not respecting that would make it fail instantly.

&gt;The European Union needs to slow down, stop expanding so fast and actually negotiate what it is and agree on it's future. Those treaties arn't effective, the treaties are what is promulgating authority.

That would *reduce* the amount of agreement we are having, because we only get to negotiate once. ""Everything is decided in Brussels in non-transparant ways"" is one of the biggest criticisms vs. the EU at this point. How would making one big decision in Brussels that eliminates every room to weigh in except for the details for the next century going to make that better?

&gt;This is evident. The common European citizen, educated citizens, barely understand how the government structure of the European Union works. This, at least for me, is solidified by the fact that many subscribers on this very subreddit don't understand that the European Parliament doesn't have a legislative mandate. Many barely understand the difference between the Commission and the Council, and I for one, see them as simply two groups that mirror each other except for semantics.

I agree, there's a lack of transparency.

&gt;And you know why they feel like this? Because the European Union has a shitty fucking PR department. And this is because they have a identity crisis. It doesn't know what it wants to be, a consolidated supranational union which emulates a nation-state, or a loose confederation of nations. Because of this institutional confusion, the citizens are confused, which means they feel disconnected. This leads to BIG problems down the road.

While I do agree that there's a PR problem, it's not caused by an identity problem: the EU is an open-ended project, it's in its nature. The problem is an unclear distribution of competences, allowing different institutions to blame each other.

&gt; 
&gt; Which is already shitty

So that justifies making it even worse, by flooding it with uneducated people?

Again, who's going to pay for that? All of this doesn't come without a cost.

Edit: BTW, our questionable immigration policies are one of the main reasons for the worsening education system. [Here is a good article on this matter](http://akarlin.com/2012/05/berlin-gets-bad-news-from-pisa/) and [another study here](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.225.4709&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf).

However I also acknowledge, that a **properly** implemented immigration policy, like in Switzerland for example, [leads to higher PISA scores and boosts a nation's educational performance as a whole.](http://skbf-csre.ch/fileadmin/files/pdf/publikationen/Staffpaper7.pdf).

Unfortunately Germany's current policies in regards to immigration are far from sensible.

&gt;the first world thing mostly has to do with being one of the first countries to be done with the industrialization

Made possible by free trade and capitalism - because industrialization has no real value, when you can't trade the goods you produced freely.

&gt;And I see it as something that undermines the foundations of democracy, and that are NOT it's state leaders but the laws that were made to protect the democracy from these leaders, and from the overreaching executive, and the ever-more ""WE MUST CONTROL Y'ALL"" feeling that seems to be coming from both big parties.

Don't you realize how ridiculous you sound, when you oppose state control while being a supporter of the far political left, that espouses and supports communism? The communist and socialist regimes of the past have by far the worst track record when it comes to population control and surveillance.

Communism will not bring the more freedom you seem to want, quite the opposite. Like it has been shown time and again in the past, it will lead to violent redistribution first and authoritarian rule with wide-spread surveillance and the implementation of a police state later on.

If you want more freedom from state control it would make much more sense to support liberal and libertarian leaning parties.",0,1389008498,null,0,1389011893,0,ceimoy4,t3_1ug3l1,t1_ceimoy4,t1_ceime61,null,1431821532,-1,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,-1

Disons que je crois que je pense que, sauf exceptions (Amélie Poulain, les Intouchables, Edith Piaf), les oeuvres culturelles françaises *dont l'identité française est marquée* restent destinées au marché national. De la même manière qu'un Hollandais ne va pas écouter du rap russe, un Américain ne va a priori pas écouter de hip hop français.

Il y'a sûrement plusieurs raisons, mais la barrière linguistique créé un véritable fossé. Ce fossé on le retrouve à tous les étages, de la culture mainstream aux sous-cultures a priori les plus américanisantes (geeks, gamers). 

Même le Royaume-Uni, un pays qui a une identité culturelle marquée, échange continuellement de manière directe (c'est à sans dire sans filtre, sans localisation, sans traduction, sans intermédiaire) avec les Etats-Unis. En France et dans les autres pays non-anglophones où la majeure partie de la population n'est pas bilingue, c'est plus délicat et l'impression que j'ai quand je suis en France c'est celle d'une relative isolation culturelle. On se limite souvent aux phénomènes superficiels qui viennent des US et notre mode d'échange est unilatéral. On importe bien davantage qu'on exporte.

Revenons à la musique. 

Par exemple historiquement il y'a eu toute une série de groupes anglais tellement populaires aux US qu'on pourrait penser qu'ils sont américains, ce qui est inconcevable pour un groupe français. Sauf, sauf, sauf, dans le cas des groupes d'électro, ceux justement dont l'identité française n'est pas très marquée.

Autant des Français auront du mal à perçer à l'échelle internationale dans le rock ou la pop, autant pour l'électro l'absence relative de paroles facilite le processus (encore une fois je ne parle pas des artistes qui sont connus justement pour être l'incarnation de la France, comme Edith Piaf etc.).

A mon avis c'est la raison pour laquelle Daft Punk voire même Remi Gaillard peuvent acquérir une certaine popularité à l'étranger sans même qu'on le sache forcément, là où personne hors des frontières ne va parler de je-sais-même-pas-quel-groupe-français-est-populaire-ici-en-ce-moment ou de Mickael Young.
