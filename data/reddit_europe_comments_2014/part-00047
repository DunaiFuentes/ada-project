La concezione politica moderna europea è di base repubblicana (a parte quelle poche monarchie parlamentari che ci sono) ed è una cosa piuttosto recente, ma non significa che questo rende il parlamento giusto a prescindere.

In ogni caso con il tuo discorso cerchi un modo per avere una rappresentanza reale, credendo che il problema risiedi nel sistema dei partiti.

In verità il problema è ben prima: un parlamento ha all'interno persone che ne rappresentano molte di più (nel caso dell'italia 60 milioni); il suo obiettivo (cioè il motivo per cui esiste) è quello di convogliare le idee di queste 60 milioni di persone in delle riforme.

In una situazione di questo tipo si va incontro a un concetto utopistico della rappresentanza, poiché è impossibile che tutti e 60 milioni di persone siano giustamente rappresentate e che il parlamento non vada incontro a problemi quando si discute su quale riforme fare o meno (in nome di quelle 60 milioni di persone). Per questo molti si sono inventati diversi varianti per venire in contro a questi problemi e cercare di rappresentare il meglio possibile le 60 milioni di persone e si è convenuto che il modo migliore è quello di trattare una riforma il più velocemente possibile (in modo da trattarne tante e avere più probabilità di farne una giusta), poiché rappresentare queste 60 milioni di persone è utopico.

Voglio solamente sottolineare come sia indifferente se i parlamentari vengono eletti direttamente o se vengano decisi dai partiti, poiché il loro obiettivo è quello di fare riforme per 60 milioni di persone. Ne uno, ne l'altro modo, cambia l'efficacia di questa rappresentanza; quello che viene a cambiare è la difficoltà di diventare parlamentare.",0,1392610758,null,0,false,0,cfh83q1,t3_1y3g8f,t1_cfh83q1,t1_cfh15kg,null,1432430338,5,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,5

They are preparations for suppression of opposition in the working class and a further turn to the right on the part of Russia’s gangster oligarchy.

There are many providers that are essentially the same, but Aldi should be fine.

&gt; How does it work in Germany/NRW? 

I am not familiar with the Mönchengladbach system specifically, but usually in mid-sized cities the whole city proper counts as one area and all trips, even if they require changes, cost the same. Generally there is a time limit for changes though and you are not allowed to travel back and forth on the same ticket. If you travel outside the city, then your destination starts to make a difference.

I would seriously consider a time-based (daily, weekly...) ticket. Often a daily ticket costs only ever so slightly more than two single tickets. Even if you aren't sure that you will travel more than that, you may change your mind later and you don't have to bother to buy one each time. Similarly a weekly ticket usually makes sense once you buy more than two or three daily tickets in a week.

They have more stuff than they show on their website, but not all that much. If they have what you need, then you probably won't beat the price. I wouldn't rely on them too much though.

Rady Ananda
Activist Post
Nineteen of the European Union’s 28 states rejected Dupont’s insecticidal corn, citing concern for pollinators.  Five EU states approved the genetically modified maize, and four abstained.

But because state votes are weighted based on population size, no clear majority was reached either way, which leaves it up to the European Commission, who approved Dupont Pioneer’s TC1507 corn on February 11.

The Commission approved TC1507 for import in November 2005 and five months later approved it for human consumption. This week’s approval will allow for its cultivation.

French activist and politician Jose Bove condemned the approval and explained that Germany’s abstention prevented a majority vote rejection of the corn.

“The European Parliament, the majority of Member States and 80% of citizens do not want GMOs in Europe,” Bove said in a statement, calling it “inconceivable” and “political” that the Commission would approve TC1507.

France is voting on a new bill to ban GM corn, to counter a high court ruling last year that annulled the ban.

Four of the five states approving its cultivation “produce virtually no corn in their territory,” he said.
The Greens/EFA plan to censure the EC for its approval of the crop and seek to revise GMO approval rules. Under EU rules, the Commission is empowered to approve GM for cultivation.
Rebecca Harms, Co-President of the Greens/EFA, warned that the authorization should be suspended until the approval process is revised to take account of “the legitimate and consistent opposition to this highly controversial technology.”

A motion of censure may be initiated by one-tenth of the members of the European Parliament (77 seats).

Twelve of the 19 nations that rejected TC1507 approval, the leading agricultural states in the EU, sent a letter to the Commission warning that GM approval may spark voter condemnation in the upcoming summer elections.

Reuters speculated that the battle may lead to a situation when GM crops would be allowed in the EU in general, with all countries reserving the right to ban them nationwide, without restriction.

But trade agreements may overturn this right.

Bove warned that TAFTA, the TransAtlantic Free Trade Area agreement still in negotiation, is setting up arbitration courts to enable corporations to challenge state laws, forcing their product on nations that do not want it.

TC1507 is the second GM crop to win cultivation approval in the EU.  Monsanto GM corn, MON810 is approved, but mostly grown only in Spain.  Three other GM crops were approved for cultivation, but later banned. Widespread populist opposition has stymied further market penetration of biotech crops.

The 19 nations to reject TC1507 are: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

Estonia, Finland, Spain, Sweden and the UK approved it, while four abstained: Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany and Portugal.",1,1392618230,null,0,false,0,cfharpt,t3_1y4k64,t1_cfharpt,t3_1y4k64,null,1432431596,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Luxuria ha poi apertamente e volutamente violato una legge - per quanto stupida e retrograda - di uno **stato sovrano** e, pertanto, ha assolutamente meritato di finire al gabbio.

Vedi... io sono stato iscritto per anni all'ARCI Gay, pur essendo etero. Non ho mai avuto problemi ad avere quella tessera in tasca, ed ho conosciuto tanti di quei gay da farci tre squadre di calcio, **ma** personalmente sono contrario al **matrimonio** gay, proprio perche' in Costituzione non e' chiaro (senza parlare di quanto il Vaticano si potrebbe mettere di traverso, rendendo questa solo una mera fantasia nella mente di qualche romantico)

D'accordissimo, invece, a riconoscere i diritti per ogni tipo di coppia di fatto, **sia essa etero che omosessuale**. Si, tranquillamente equiparandoli al matrimonio.

1.) Bildung ist Ländersache. 

2.) Teachers are usually trained for 7 years (Bachelor, Master and Referendariat), they study Lehramt and have to be qualified to teach 2 or even 3 subjects. And you have to study for the school track you want to teach in (Grund-/Sonder-/Haupt-/Realschule or Gymnasium).

3.) Most Länder hire their Teachers as Beamte, which you cannot become without German Citizenship.

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"? We have an inbreed wolf population that needs to increase. The hunters arguments are that they will have a less animals to shoot- I and several other million Swedes don't give a shit about that. Wolves are part of our natural fauna and should be given priority. If they eat elks so there are less elk for the hunters to shoot- so be it. 

We need wolves in our fauna, it is a natural predator that one can't just dismiss and remove. Look at what happened in Yellowstone when I t was reintroduced- several tropic cascades. It is a what we in Sweden call a key species. Just because a few hundred thousand hunters want to shoot more, we shouldn't eradicate a key species. 

And- it is also wrong to say the hunters. I know several hunters who think like me. Instead- say the uneducated one who care only about how much they get to shoot. 


As for the farmers- a) the Sami needs to take their responsibility as well. B) most of them don't even attempt to protect their sheep c) they get paid for every animal the wolves take d) so far at least 50 % of the ""wolf attacks"" have been by dogs. 


He is also making it into a city/country issues which indicates that apparently only  people in the countryside are allowed to a) have an opinion a out the Swedish fauna b) know what they are talking about c) only people in the city wants wolves (not true btw) d) they country people always know better and that they are the only ones that hunt.

* The politician Edathy is revealed to be a customer of *borderline* CP from a Canadian website. While the material is in bad taste (pictures of posing young boys, naked), it alone is probably not enough for a valid accusation.

* Edathy was a rising star before, bound to play a major role in German politics and at least a candidate for secretary of state, if not minister role.

* The government gets tipped of by Canadian authorities right in the middle of the coalition negotiations.

* The proper, legal course of action would be to keep mum about it, letting the SPD, the partner-to-be, run in an open knife later on when they make him a high-ranking government member and the scandal unfolds.

* CDU member Friedrich, one of the head negotiators for the coalition talks, decides to be nice guy and tips off the head of the SPD, Gabriel, to avoid this desaster.

* This is a breach of state secrets and punishable by law. Friedrich broke the law trying to be nice and build trust with the future coalition partner.

* Gabriel spills the beans to others in the SPD, therefore the news travel all over the Bundestag, probably also to Edathy. The German prosecutors are the last to get the memo, pissing them off supremely.

* Edathy **is proven** to have destroyed evidence, which might make prosecution impossible. The prosecutors are irate because Edathy' modus operandi points to more, graver things he hid.

* Friedrich has to resign. To this day, he doesn't understand why he is scapegoated for trying to be nice to the SPD.

* The CDU/CSU is in uproar. One of theirs (Friedrich) had to go for being nice, the SPD heads blabbed and don't see a problem with them not facing any impact.

* CDU/CSU members demand that one of the SPD guys has to resign as well to make up for it. One SPD guy even phoned the prosecutor's office to get more details, effectively being 10x worse than Friedrich. He should resign.

I agree. 

But on the other hand I have lived in both eastern and western europe, and I can say that while countries such as NL and DK might have well-functioning standards, this is less evident in the eastern part of the EU, where what passes for anti-discrimination, anti-sexism, and anti-corruption standards are often questionable at best. 

For that type of scenario, EU jurisdiction is probably a good thing in terms of making 21st century standards more ubiquitous.

true,kennon42,null,null,"I'm an American who taught English (to adults) for several years in Leipzig, so all of this may only apply to freelance English teaching to adults via private language schools and it might be slightly different in other Bundesländer/cities.

You don't technically ""need"" any qualifications at all to teach adults here, but most language schools won't consider you without a TEFL or CELTA certification (I did a 1 month course). These are probably cheaper in the US but doing it in Germany (I did mine in Berlin) gets you a month ahead on learning German culture etc. 

Getting the first residency permit can be tricky, but as a native speaker, if you can get several language schools interested in you (you probably won't get enough work from any one school at the beginning)  and can take a stack of letters offering you work with you to the Ausländerbehörde, your chances are pretty good. 

They just want to make sure you are going to earn more than your costs, so if you can start out with a cheap room in a shared flat (Wohngemeinschaft; WG) and get a cheap health insurance plan then you won't need to have TOO much work lined up. 

When I was teaching (~8 years ago), the per hour pay was good but it was sometimes difficult to get enough hours together. There were some weeks where I only worked 3-4 hours. This was tough on the wallet but great for having lots of free time to experience life in a WG.

As others have insinuated, you should probably just not even bother thinking about being a public school teacher here - even if you were in a state that hired foreigners, they almost certainly wouldn't accept any of your teaching qualifications and you'd have to do over several years of college and then a two year Referendariat (like an ""apprenticeship"" in some ways).

Private schools are possibly an option - a non-German buddy of mine teaches English in a private Kindergarten and school - but the pay is not normally very good and the competition seems to be pretty high. (That could vary wildly by city though)

If you're only interested in teaching kids, then private/international schools is probably the way to go, in which case you'd need to seriously market yourself well. If you could convince a school somehow that they had to have YOU then I'm sure it could all work out. I wouldn't count on just applying and expecting a school to come after you or anything, though.

In both language and private/international schools the expat teacher turnover seems to be pretty high, so if you could convince them that you were intending to stay longer term then that might encourage them to invest the time into you.

No. Sweden is not centuries old?  Or Sweden has no political boundaries?  I don't think you understand English very well.  That's fine.

&gt; We have an inbreed wolf population that needs to increase. The hunters arguments are that they will have a less animals to shoot- 

That's their business.  Let them decide policy amongst themselves in their locality.

&gt;I and several other million Swedes don't give a shit about that.

Majority oppression over minorities is tyranny and unsound.  If you don't live in the rural areas, why should you give a shit?

&gt;Wolves are part of our natural fauna and should be given priority. If they eat elks so there are less elk for the hunters to shoot- so be it. 

Ok.  Fair enough.  The wolves have standing.  Conservation and diversity is reasonable.

&gt;And- it is also wrong to say the hunters. I know several hunters who think like me. Instead- say the uneducated one who care only about how much they get to shoot. 

Ok.

&gt;As for the farmers- a) the Sami needs to take their responsibility as well. 

How can they?  If millions of Swedes, such as yourself, many of whom aren't even in the area prevent them from taking responsibility.

&gt;B) most of them don't even attempt to protect their sheep 

If what you say is true then they have only themselves to blame.

&gt;c) they get paid for every animal the wolves take 

So why should they try to protect their animals if they have no incentive to do so?

d) so far at least 50 % of the ""wolf attacks"" have been by dogs. 

If this is true, then I'm wasting my time discussing this issue.

&gt;He is also making it into a city/country issues which indicates that apparently only people in the countryside are allowed to a) have an opinion a out the Swedish fauna 

If he lives there, then he has to take responsibility for it.  Swedes and Sami are as apart of the fauna as wolves are.

&gt;c) only people in the city wants wolves (not true btw) 

If wolves come to the city, then they have standing in the debate.

&gt;d) they country people always know better and that they are the only ones that hunt. None of these assertions are correct. For example- younger people everywhere are more positive to wolves than older people. 

Ok.  So what?  If any of the aforementioned groups; country people, young people, old people, do not live or own property in the area of contention then to hell with what they think.  They have no standing to decide this issue.

&gt;So, people on an island can fish as much as they want, or can all people in northern Sweden decide to kill off all the elks if they want? Can people in Stockholm decide to kill off all the eagles if we want? Should the people in England be allowed to kill off every single bird if they choose to? People in Japan to kill off every whale close to them?

This is pure nonsense.  You're a fool and I'm a fool for indulging you.

&gt;Of course, and if you had followed the worf debate you should know that it has been done, several times. The problem is that it has been done to excess, plus that no thought at all has been as to build up a sustainable wolf population. 

Yet according to the article above the wolf population is higher than in the past.

&gt;That is why, after decades of trying to do that in Sweden, environmental groups took it to Brussel. 

A foolish decision. 

&gt;And, if you followed the debate, you should also know that Anders Carlgren, who made the promise that they should be able to shoot the wolves had no basis to do that, and he did that before the 2010 election. He had no clue as to what he was talking about, which was painfully evident when he talked about how ""importing wolves from Russia"" - that infamous interview he gave which every wolf research just laughed at. 

Ok.

&gt;And - you didn't answer my question. I want links, and details as to where in Sweden one should be allowed to hunt, how many wolves and how you are going to build a sustainable wolf population? How are you going to solve the inbreeding problem? 

I'm not a Swede.  I don't live there.  I'm not from Brussels either and I'm not going to do something as arrogant as tell the native population what they should do with their environment.  If I did, I would be as foolish as you and your cohorts.  There are solutions.  It is up to the property owners to decided what they should do.

&gt;Even if those who disagree have idiotic argument. And it is not the whole local population, it is some of the hunters.

So what?  If a fellow owns his property then he should do with it what pleases him.  If he is a minority on the wolf debate, then the majority will come to a sensible solution and are incentivized to preserve the wolves in their natural habitat.  They could even reach out to the fellow who dislikes wolves and offer him compensation (which you say already exists) to be happy with his situation.  Even then, if he doesn't agree, respect him.  He is in the minority, so what threat does he pose?

&gt;How the heck can they be a majority anywhere - and what area are you talking about if you claim that? I'd like for you to give me those numbers, in detail please.

I never made such a claim.  You will not find me making such a claim anywhere in this debate.  You're making stuff up and are riled up.  Go eat some Gravlax and settle down.

This GMO scare is fundamentally irrational. So good riddance. GM crops in general are neither toxic nor unhealthy, and they keep people who need food alive. *Certain* GMO crops may be at issue, but not the entire concept. It's the natural progress of humans making nature do their will. (Have you ever seen a [wild banana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Inside_a_wild-type_banana.jpg)?)

These plants produce their own pesticide, essentially. If we sprayed them on, which we also do, they would be regarded as environmentally friendly because they're very specific. Neither the toxins or the GM corn has ever been shown to be harmful to humans and the mentioned danger to butterfly larvae [is debunked](http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/br/btcorn/).

But in my opinion it's kinda crap, and a place where money is being spent rubbishly
There are about 5 people who watch S4C (welsh language channel) which is not worthy of putting that much funding into it. I have a feeling that this could be the same for Ireland if they choose to do this.

I see where he's coming from. Human rights aren't something which should be thrown around like they are. they were created so that people would have a decent life, not being tortured and so on and so forth, not for national tv language and bi-lingual politics.
In my opinion, the worst decision our assembly government have done is to make politics be in both Welsh and English. Seeing as English is a lot more spoken in Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and is one of the most spoken languages in the world (apart from mandarin and french I think [citation needed]) I feel politics should be kept like this. It just makes things more difficult and take longer to process.

&gt;  Allora sei bipolare. sei o non sei a favore del matrimonio omosessuale?

E tu allora sei incapace di elaborare cio' che viene scritto. La norma in Costituzione che definisce il matrimonio non e' chiara e puo' dare adito a interpretazioni tali da poter definire, al momento, il matrimonio gay come *anticostituzionale*

Se si modifica la norma, non ho problemi ad essere d'accordo. Ma finche' la norma e' scritta cosi', e visto che prima di tutto vengono la Costituzione e le Leggi dello Stato, non posso esserlo.

Come ho detto, discorso diverso sono le coppie di fatto e l'equiparazione dei loro diritti a quelli del matrimonio. Perche' e' aberrante, per fare un esempio, che il convivente di un malato terminale non lo possa assistere sul letto di morte. Indipendentemente dal sesso dei due.

&gt; le leggi possono essere cambiate

Vero ed allo stesso tempo falso: per cambiare la Costituzione serve un consenso condiviso fra i vari schieramenti che, per un tema come questo, e' semplicemente un'utopia inarrivabile.

Ergo: la si smetta di parlare di matrimoni gay fino a quando non ci sara' la possibilità effettiva di modificare la Costituzione. Fino a quel momento, parliamo di coppie di fatto. Che, essendo oltre tutto un termine ""unisex"", interesserebbe moooolte piu' persone, sia omo che etero

But my main argument is that there is always an excuse for doing something shitty towards animals or the environment in the West. People will always say ""but this"" and ""but that"" and suddenly act all nationalistic and start talking about ""doing what needs to be done"" and everyone gets into a circlejerk and starts agreeing.

But suddenly when someone else does it (in certain nations that are, let's say, different) then you start getting the racism, the xenophobia and all that shit. Everyone likes to climb up on the highest horse they can find and start shouting down on others.

When a town kills a man eating tiger in India everyone blames the town and people for existing in the first place on ""Tiger territory"". When China build a dock or a mine that destroys an ecosystem everyone starts to throw up a stink. 

When Britain, America or Western Europe makes almost every dangerous animal extinct and completely changes the coastline and destroys thousands of ecosystems everyone says it needs to be done for safety and civilisation. ""Muh family"" ""muh jobs"" ""muh town""

My only conclusion is that this mindset is born out of nationalism, xenophobia and racism hidden behind a veil of environmentalism.

The Arbitration Act allows arbitration on any grounds that the two parties accept, but the potential for religiously-based decision-making is far from the worst part of the system. 

What is much worse is that by accepting arbitration, you give up much of your right of appeal that you would have had if you went to a real court, but it is legitimate to include a binding arbitration clause in a form contract presented on a take-it-or-leave it basis between parties of significantly different bargaining power, even where the arbitrate is chosen by the party who wrote the contract (and thus the arbitrator knows who to find for if he can because he wants the repeat business).",0,1392634168,null,0,false,0,cfhe3r5,t3_1xoysm,t1_cfhe3r5,t1_cfditmh,null,1432433168,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

It is a rather unimportant distinction. What it boils down to is that the Swiss people voted against opening their borders to (a small part of) Europeans. And now the border closing if being effected in the opposite direction (in the form of an indirect closing of the Erasmus program). I can completely understand why the Swiss would vote for such a law, but I would not understand is a generalised outrage over the consequences. It's very likely that this measure was prematurely effected as a symbolic punishment, but it would have come sooner or later (without the retaliatory intent) anyways. I frankly for one believe that it being done in this way has the best chance of showing the Swiss populace of what exactly they voted for, and to understand on a deeper level that to reap to benefits of an open borders policy, one has to actually have open borders. Otherwise it would just be mooching. 

I think it's overall a sad thing because at least in a great proportion what motivated most people to vote for this law was sheer xenophobia.

true,dimitarRU,RUSS,Slava Rossii,"Russian here... There are several types of Russian Emigrants.

Many of White Russians(Revolution emigres) living in France, or USA strike me as very educated, cultured and very patriotic toward Russia. They are supportive to the current Russian government, and tend to think negatively towards USSR, though they are still proud of Soviet scientific and cultural achievements(Space Race, Victory in WW2, Superpower Status).

2nd type are educated scientist emigres. They left around the breakup of the soviet union, and they mostly live in University towns in US or England, teaching students math, chemistry, and physics. They're usually very bitter about break-up of the soviet union, and tend to be stuck in 90's about their perception of Russia. Nevertheless they tend to be very patriotic and cultured.

3rd type are the infamous Natashas and Svetlanas. At home they don't gather much respect, as they're considered gold-diggers, and whores. Usually they're from Ukraine or Kazakhstan, or some other post-soviet state. Relatively few of them are Russian. They're mostly uncultured, uneducated province girls, they mostly hate Russia. (I actually met a couple in my trip to USA, and they refused to speak Russian with me, and thought of themselves as my betters, even though their english was terrible). 

4th type are the Jews from all over former soviet union. They tend to very critical and spiteful of contemporary Russia considering its pro-imperial revival as a return to a [Pogrom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom) land. I also found striking of how soviet their mindset is, you walk in their house and you'd think they're stuck in the soviet union of 70's.

Edit: But then again, those are my perceptions and they might not apply to other Russians out there. 

Edit#2: Most of the people in Russia are either very critical of the diaspora, or totally indifferent. There are some people who consider recent diasporas as rich oligarchs who robbed the land and now live in London somewhere, others think that people in diasporas were too weak to survive the turbulent 1990, so they p#ssied out(kind of like rats leave the sinking ship first, before anyone else).

Ausies like BBQ's and go slightly mental in the sun and Canadians ocasionally use 'USesque' words and like Hockey, other than that no difference.

Countries like Zim/RSA are a little different, having friends and family in both I know they are very very similar to every other Brit. However they are a little bit more 'I want to shoot things' and much more racist (for various reasons). 

The USA is special, despite the fact that British/English Americans are likely the biggest group, very few consider themselves British decendants. They have a different outlook on life, cultural differences much greater than the rest of the anglosphere and are generally different from everyone else.

Getting a visa as a non-EU citizen is becoming more and more difficult, as companies have to have a genuine reason to hire you over someone else. No doubt there are bucket-loads of highly qualified, multilingual programmers from all over Europe with their eyes on Germany.

My advice - start learning German. While others on this sub may not stress it, it's something they probably should do a bit more. You will need to reach a certain level of German to continue staying on a blue card (if you get one) anyway, and it would look better on your application to say you know at least some. 

On another note, international companies might not use German as their working language, but might expect you to be able to speak it when needed.

Honestly, you will need to stop musing about how great Germany is or may or may not be and the whole idea of going there and start focusing on making yourself more marketable and employable there, if you do in fact intend on going. Germany is great, but wait till you get there to experience that.

Without reasonable set criteria, the precautionary principle suffers the same problem that other poorly reasoned things do: no falsifiability.  For example, prove to me that the earth was not created 6000 years ago.  You can't do it, you can't prove that wrong, which is why creationism is not science.

Translated:

""Dear anonymous online threatener,

You don't know her, you've never met her. Still you have ridiculed, mocked and even threatened a Rotterdam entrepeneur for opening a wine bar. Apparently you do not agree with her choice and wanted to give her your honest opinion. This went from bad to worse. The police even had to be called in. Where do you get the nerve to scare somebody like that?

This contributes nothing for your children, your family or society. All your cowardly behaviour shows is that you do not understand the rules. And you aren't the only one. Posting hurtful, threatening comments on social media appears to be the national sport sometimes.

The rule in this country is that everybody is free to make their own decisions in life. These choices deserve to be respected, even though we do not always agree with them. If you can not give this respect, you can not ask to be respected either. That is how easy it is. Compare it to sport. A fair game can only be played if everybody plays by the rules. Anonymous shitflinging is something that puts you completely offside if you ask me and it doesn't earn you any respect.

Luckily the democratic rule of law protects these rules. This ensures that citizens are protected and feel safe to be whoever they want to be. The next time you crawl back behind your keyboard, take the following rule in mind. A rule that is centuries old and is seen in all cultures: treat others the way you want to be treated.

Treaties, like contracts, are nullified all the time. Personally, I have no stake it it, but I have worked in international institutional setting before, and, as far as I can see, this is nothing new under the sun. 

Yes, its quite clear, the population was faced with a choice of being either less ethnically diverse, and also more isolated in a trade/commerce/development sense, **OR** steadily becoming more international both in an economic and demographic sense. They chose the former. 

They are not the first country in history to do that.

true,Hexaploid,UNSA,United States of America - Hawaiʻi,"&gt;What about biodiversity

What about it?  You can't just drop a word and call that a debate either, since there are multiple ways of discussing biodiversity.  If you are talking farm level, they you should support GE crops.  It has been shown that, due to reduced insecticide sprays on Bt crops (one of the three main types of GE crops currently in use) there are higher levels of non-target insect life.  There are reports of both [beneficial](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature11153.html?WT.ec_i) and [detrimental](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5982/1151) effects of this, benefit in that non-target insect predators are more prevalent, detrimental in that non-target pests previously controlled by insecticides can become problematic.

If you are talking biodiversity within a crop, then the topic becomes meaningless.  The GMO traits are commonly bred into a multitude of different lines.  The original GMO with the desired trait is produced, not always in the line you want, necessitating that the gene be bred into other lines.  For example, [here](http://www.seminis.com/global/us/products/Pages/ProfessionalGrowersSummerSquash.aspx) you can see a number of lines of transgenic summer squash.  For the big crop like corn and soy, there are a lot more different lines with transgenic traits.  If you mean species level agro-biodiversity, like eating crops other than the major ones (like teff, taro, pawpaw, salak, ect.), then that, while extremely important and deserving of much more attention, cultivation, and research, than they often get, has nothing to do with GMOs.

&gt;the huge socio-economical impact

You mean like papaya farmers in Hawai'i not going out of business thanks to transgenic papaya literally [saving the industry](http://www.agbioforum.org/v7n12/v7n12a07-gonsalves.htm)?  Or farmers not needing as much insecticide due to transgenic corn and cotton, leading to less [pesticide poisoning](http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/07/bt_cotton_cuts_pesticide_poiso.html), [reduced losses](http://www.biofortified.org/wp-content/uploads//2012/12/bn712-bt_cotton_chomp.jpg), and [higher incomes](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/06/25/1203647109)?  Or maybe we should talk about the socio-economic impact of hundreds of thousands of children going blind because Greenpeace is working hard to block Golden Rice.

Scientists do look lots of issues, the problem here is that there is two parts of the so-called GMO debate: the scientific one, and the public one.  The scientific one is looking at actual issues in a non-sensationalist way, for example, corn borers that have developed resistance to the GMO corn.  Then there are the anti-GMO people who will run around misrepresenting the issue entirely with shouts of 'superbugs.'",0,1392641255,null,0,false,0,cfhf9h8,t3_1y4k64,t1_cfhf9h8,t1_cfhe7yw,null,1432433777,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

true,Hexaploid,UNSA,United States of America - Hawaiʻi,"&gt;One modification is to splice a pesticide producing gene in the target genome

A pesticide in a plant is ubiquitous in the plant kingdom.  Plants, as a general rule, don't move too much, so unlike animal life, they can't run or fight anything trying to eat them.  How, then, is it that the trillions of insects on earth don't devour all plant life?  Part of that reason is pesticides.  Take black pepper, for instance.  Do you think it produces piperine, the chemical that gives black pepper its taste, in its seeds so that some primate will grind up and eat its offspring?  Nope, piperine is a pesticidal defensive mechanism.  Plants evolved the ability to produce chemical defenses to counter things that can move that want to eat them.  To simply talk about a plant having pesticides in them is pretty misleading without the context that all plants have pesticides in them, pesticides that can, speaking of putting things in context, [be bred for](http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/ar/archive/may02/corn0502.htm), though I can't help but notice no one cares when conventional breeders do that.

Bereits Ende August des Vorjahres hatten Ermittler bei einer Razzia auch in Ballstädt eine Wohnung durchsucht. Parallel dazu war die Polizei damals in Crawinkel bei Ohrdruf und in Erfurt zu Razzien erschienen. Damals sollen laut Polizei zahlreiche Waffen sichergestellt worden sein. Seit Juli des Vorjahres ermittelt die Erfurter Staatsanwaltschaft in dem Verfahren unter anderem wegen des Verdachts des Verstoßes gegen das Kriegswaffenkontrollgesetz.

Wie man hier sieht, sind es nicht nur kleinere Waffen, sondern gleich mal zwei Uzis und russische Sturmgewehre:

&gt; 

&gt; Büchners Angaben zufolge wurden bei den Durchsuchungen Waffen und Munition gefunden. Unter anderem handelt es sich um zwei ""augenscheinliche Sturmgewehre russischen Fabrikats"" und drei dazugehörige, mit Patronen gefüllte Magazine, sowie um zwei Maschinenpistolen des israelischen Fabrikats ""Uzi"". Außerdem wurden ein Colt sowie ein Schlagring, ein Springmesser, ein selbst gebauter sogenannter Totschläger und zwei Schlagstöcke beschlagnahmt. Laut LKA-Erklärung könnte es sich bei einem der beiden russischen Sturmgewehre jedoch um eine sogenannte Deko-Waffe, also keine echte Waffe handeln. Bei den anderen Gegenständen stehe eine waffenrechtliche Begutachtung noch aus. Außerdem sei ein gestohlenes Smartphone sichergestellt worden.

And that's why the talks were halted, not cancelled. The EU is waiting for Switzerland to introduce laws that are going to guarantee that the scientists are not going to have more problems working in Switzerland than in any other country with the same treaties.

&gt; They're not changing anything to the movement of capitals as far as I know.

That's true, but if the quotas are introduced and the EU uses the guillotine clause the Swiss market is going to be separated from the market of the EU until maybe there's another treaty addressing that issue, but its creation is still in a quite distant future. The EU doesn't want to stipulate science in a market its workers(the main beneficiaries of research) don't have access to. And that's the reason for halting these negotiations too.

It all boils down to the EU having no guarantee that the conditions for all of the current treaties are going to be satisfied. If Switzerland imposes quotas it'd also lessen the benefits the EU has now from the current relationship with Switzerland, which means that the Swiss might need to be the ones who have to offer more in order to keep most of the treaties that were signed. It might also be possible that all the treaties will be cancelled and then immediately renegotiated on new terms. Only time will reveal that.

Thats is pressure. It is not punishment, it is not ""imperialism"". If Switzerland does not want to cooperate in other places where the EU citizens need(and what is the point of the EU if not protect the interest of its citizens?) , all those millions of euros can be better spent on countries that do want to cooperate with us.

Switzerland is not even a part of the EU, it should not have the same benign treatment expected to a member of the EU. Applying this sort of pressure on a country member is not acceptable, but in a non-member that decided to go against the interests of the EU citizens? It is the least expected.

If the EU just say ""well, ok, thanks for trying swiss!"" it will completly undermine the EU authority to help its countries, and, in the long term, can even signify the weakning of it.

What do you mean by 'heavy modifying'?  So far the crops that are genetically engineered only have a handful of proteins inserted.

Nehmen wir weiterhin an, dass dies alles ist was er gemacht hat und dass er keine tatsächliche Kinderpornographie konsumiert hat. Wenn der Fall so aussieht, dann hat er meiner Meinung nach sich nicht unmoralisch verhalten. Er hat weder den Missbrauch irgendeines Kindes unterstützt, noch hat er seiner sexuellen Lust nachgegeben und irgendjemanden vergewaltigt. Er hat lediglich seinen Trieb (für den er nichts kann) mit legalem Material befriedigt. Soweit ich das beurteilen kann hat er niemandem geschadet.

All this stuff is heritage stuff is kind of foreign (pun?) to me.  Most of my family came to the US in the mid-late 1800s.  They were from all over, Austria, Prussia, Poland, Russia, Sicily, Romania, and I have NO connection to any of it.  Most of my ancestors were Jewish (besides the Sicilians), and I just assume they were all killed in the Holocaust.  I'm sure I can find where my family is from in Sicily easily, but I'm not inclined to.

I'm proud of being a 5th generation NYC'er (well really Brooklynite), so I guess that is my heritage.  The context that was totally missing from this thread would be the political significance of ""heritage"" in the US (ans I assume Canada).  My father ran for election in a fairly high state position, and I went to campaign with him.  So we went to every ethnic group association you could think of.  And the leaders of these groups drill heritage into these people's heads to keep them in their local society. Then the leaders get a lot of political power by the appearance of being able to deliver many votes.  This was 20 years ago, and I think the importance of ""white"" ethnic associations have died down a bit, but for ""minorities"" they are still very important.

Anyway, I plan to visit Scandinavia soon, and would love to learn about the heritage, but I will mostly be interested in the outdoors.  :-)  No lutefisk for me!

Homöopathie heisst so, weil sie - im Gegensatz zur Schulmedizin, die man auch Allopathie nenne - grundsätzlich anders wirkt.

Und damit ist eben nicht (nur) die totale Verdünnung gemeint. Homöopathie bedeutet, dass Krankheiten mit Stoffen bekämpft werden, die gleiche oder ähnliche Symptome auslösen wie die Krankheit. Z.B. wenn Du Fieber hast, bekommst Du ein Mittelchen, welches Fieber auslösen würde. Stell Dir das vor wie eine Impfung.

Allopathie oder ""Schulmedizin"" geht so vor, dass Symptome bekämpft werden mit Mitteln, die der Krankheit bzw. den Symptomen entgegenwirken, z.B. bei Fieber etwas Fiebersenkendes.

Mit der Verdünnung, der sog. ""Verschüttelung"" hat das erstmal nichts zu tun.

Zweifelhaft bleibt die Grundidee mMn dennoch.

I think it is people like you who need to ""come around"" and face reality, ditch the utopian dreams, EU isn't the freedom loving entity you think it is, right now it is showing its true colours more and more, it is a bully in the making.


How some of you can be so naive of what is happening that you completely miss the point that you're eliminating any national standpoint as a valid concern towards the EU(globalist in fact) agenda, regardless of factual validity.

If my understanding of how the Swiss government works is correct, they carry out referendums much more often (thus being closer to what some call ""direct democracy"").

I think this goes to show just why the concept is flawed.

Most citizens that can vote in a country have very little interest in actual politics. At most, some might be interested in politics affecting their local environment (like their city or neighbourhood) but as you go further and further out (to the national and international level) interest drops and knowledge becomes less factual and more based on hearsay.

A referendum is a powerful tool for understanding the will of the people taken as a whole, but it is rarely something that should be used for every decision a nation takes.

Politicians (much as it pains me to admit) are the ones that should make these decisions for the people since they are the ones that should have the most awareness of all pros and cons of any choice affecting the country and the people.

Generally speaking, if the weather is bad and the pilot of the plane you are on says there's no way you can land, you take his word for it because you don't know how to fly a plane and the pilot is there because that's what he's supposed to do; you don't go putting it to a democratic vote.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; I have no idea if these two numbers are comparable though.

As explosions go they're not even nearly comparable. 

What makes an atomic bomb so devastating is the fact that all the energy is released in a split second within a small volume (of air, as it's the radiation heated expanding air that creates the blast). Had Hiroshima bomb relesed its energy in say 48 hours on an area of several square kilometers it wouldn't have been much of an explosion.

An LNG tanker simply cannot release all its energy in an split second explosion. The LNG needs to be in a gaseous phase to combust, it needs oxygen to combust, and it needs a right mixture of gas and air (oxygen) to combust, which conditions are not present to create such explosion of an LNG tanker.

His claim:
&gt; The total energy released in the event of a liquefied natural gas tanker exploding would be as powerful as 50 atomic bombs, an engineer claimed yesterday.

 is incorrect, misleading and uninformed. There's simply no way an LNG tanker could do what he claims and release all its energy as a huge explosion.

Because of how combustion works several conditions are needed to have a gas explosion - such as gaseous phase, oxygen and favourable mixture. Gas explosions may occur when those conditions are met for example due to an undetected leak in a pipeline.

As misleading comparisons go I remember when the space shuttle Challenger disaster happened media was at first eager to compare it to an atomic bomb, with some saying that as the fuel tank contained a huge amount of energy it was comparable to Hiroshima. Yet that was not what happened at all. As anyone can see in the images, the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen did combust in a fireball but obviously not exploding like an atomic bomb, and the shuttle itself did not explode or break because of an explosion (aerodynamic loads tore it apart).",0,1392647076,null,0,1392648113,0,cfhgl8n,t3_1y4jon,t1_cfhgl8n,t1_cfhcr5o,null,1432434403,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Also sollte er lieber in Therapie, statt sich den nächsten Rausch zu bescheren.

Außerdem ist auch die Frage, wie das Material vertrieben wurde: Es kauft an sich keiner aus Unschuld oder Spaß Bilder von nackten Minderjährigen. Irgendwie wird da sicher an den Trieb appelliert und er wird sicher nicht zufällig drüber gestolpert sein. Es existiert dabei ein klar sexueller Aspekt. Das macht es für mich Kinderpornographie, auch wenn der Gesetzestext da eventuell abweicht.

Ich würde außerdem sagen, dass, wenn er denn wirklich dafür gezahlt hat, er indirekt die Fortsetzung solcher unschönen Praktiken unterstützt hat. Das Geld geht sicher nicht an Bedürftige und Leute, die mit solchem Material handeln werden sicher nicht gerade gute Menschen sein.

Give what, free immigration? It is unreasonable to demand some things the nations see as unreasonable, regardless when they decide it becomes such.
The give and take concerns collaborative economic policy, as in trade, not direct national interests, nor would one expect such subjugated behaviour to be needed, I don't see why you support such things.


There only exists a problem because EU decided collaboration should all be essentially a package deal, why should immigration be coupled with trade of goods is a valid question; They are utterly different animals.


&gt; And really: Why should we let Swiss students in, studying here for our tax money, if Switzerland doesn't reciprocate? It doesn't make any sense.

You shouldn't, unless such a treaty is renegotiated, why would you assume they should?
When immigration is the question, there should you also respond, if you feel the need for posturing; You do not, as you stated, close all dialogue and refuse to negotiate any issues as punishment just because a nation decided a current treaty was no longer in their interest as a whole.


&gt; As I said, Switzerland is free to do whatever the fuck they want. What they are not able to do, however, is to force the rest to like what they're doing.

Nobody is forcing anyone to like it, you can hate it as much as you want, it doesn't change the fact they can, as you put it, ""do whatever they fuck they want"".

The problem is people like you are prepared to shut down rational re-negotiations as punishment because Switzerland isn't conforming to the universal 'good for all' free immigration agenda which you so love.

Which is the reason I'm arguing with you because I don't see why a democratic vote which is legitimate should be punished to the point of extorting the nation into conforming with the absolute EU ideals.


&gt; Oh stop the fucking fear mongering.

Firstly, it has been stated federalization is the goal by EU officials.

Secondly, EU is mostly an economic collaborative entity yet dictating national policy, federalized and militarized in a highly homogenous consumer society it simply becomes USA 2.0, there is nothing fear mongering about that fact.

Den Vergleich finde ich nicht so passend. Aber das ist wohl darauf zurückzuführen, dass wir unterschiedliche Grundannahmen haben. Ich gehe davon aus, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit ein Kind zu missbrauchen verringert wird, wenn ein Pädophiler sich auf eine andere Art und Weise befriedigen kann. Zum Beispiel habe ich gehört, dass in Ländern, in denen (normale) Pronographie weit verbreitet ist, die Anzahl an Vergewaltigungen viel geringer sei. Dies könnte man dadurch erklären, dass potentielle Triebtäter ihren Trieb durch die Pornographie befriedigen. Wenn also ein Pädophiler seinen Trieb durch legales Material befriedigen kann, dann finde ich das nicht unbedingt falsch. 

Nun gut, er könnte auch eine Therapie machen. Aber dort wird er ja nicht von seiner sexuellen Neigung ""geheilt"", sondern es werden ihm wahrscheinlich Methoden genannt wie er mit seinem Trieb umgehen soll. Jedenfalls vermute ich das. 

Ich denke man muss hier bedenken, dass die Existenz eines Menschen zerstört werden kann, wenn diese Neigung öffentlich bekannt gemacht wird. Wäre er in Therapie gegangen, und es gäbe irgendwo eine undichte Stelle, dann hätte er mit Sicherheit seinen Beruf verloren. Dass also viele Pädophile Angst haben sich irgendjemanden anzuvertrauen ist zu einem gewissen Grad verständlich.

&gt;Ich würde außerdem sagen, dass, wenn er denn wirklich dafür gezahlt hat, er indirekt die Fortsetzung solcher unschönen Praktiken unterstützt hat.

Bloße Nacktfotos halte ich eigentlich für harmlos.

This eventually evolved into the ""encomienda"" system, perfected during the conquest of the Canary Islands, and reaching its summit in the Spanish colonisation of the Americas, in which the conquered land *and its population* were ""entrusted"" (""encomendados"") to the conquering soldiers. The outcome was an extremely unequal distribution of wealth, in which a very small minority of direct descendants of the conquerors held the vast majority of land, and the vast majority of the population was reduced to a precarious existence as tenants or, worse, mere day labourers (""jornaleros"").

To people not familiar with this. Arithmetic average shows how much money would every person get if wages were distributed evenly, whilst median average shows how much you are expected to make by working an average job.

**Example**: A place employs 100 workers. 99 workers get 1000 units of money, while 1 get 101 000. Arithmetic average is 2000 units of money, but it is more than all the people get, except for one. Median average is still a 1000.

Almost all the bilateral agreements with EU benefit largely more Switzerland than EU except the one which pertains the freedom of movement of workers. In this last agreement both parties benefit but Switzerland, for once, benefits less.

Switzerland already has a very good balance on the agreements with EU (meaning they have the better deals) however they want better. They want to change the one which benefits more the EU than Switzerland. However changing this agreement fucks up the balance between all the agreements.

EU should not allow itself to be put even more on a losing position.

ps - Also from what I have been reading there the problem in Switzerland was that on the campaign for the referendum this balance between all the treaties was not explained. And the focus was if that agreement in particular needs to be changed.

tl;dr: The agreements between Switzerland and EU are all interconnected in a balance of benefits for both parties. Except in the freedom of workers agreement Switzerland comes on top or even in terms of benefits. Switzerland wants to change this last agreement. However this fucks up the balance between all the agreements celebrated. As such it should not be allowed without changes from the EU side.",0,1392650717,null,0,false,0,cfhhphp,t3_1y4nq3,t1_cfhhphp,t1_cfhfapo,null,1432434930,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

Nobody is asking anyone to give anyone anything unreasonable, which is the point, self determined immigration control is reasonable and many other nations feel the same way.

&gt; No it isn't. A unified market contains all three of free movement of goods, labour, and capital. You can't leave out one and still call it a unified market.

Maybe that concept is to be questioned then, it seems quite interesting how those are unconditionally coupled, could you elaborate as to how they are absolutely connected without there being a rational possibility to separate them?
They are couple because it is simply how the EU wishes to do business.


&gt; But that won't entail Swiss people to work in the EU. Because allowing that would require reciprocity.

No arguments here, if that is how the EU feels and that is completely valid, I simply cannot support anything following the route of punishment to conform to something wholly unrelated.

&gt; But they can't expect the EU to give them stuff if Switzerland isn't willing to reciprocate. The EU owes Switzerland exactly nothing, so nothing is what they get if nothing is what they offer. End of discussion.

Nobody is expecting anything but a rational renegotiation, the EU owes nothing but it is in everyone's best interest to keep things reasonable, absolute demands of subjugation are not reasonable.

Switzerland is not offering 'nothing', they still offer largely everything else in the treaty, they just want to throttle immigration.

Trade is reciprocal with trade.
Immigration is reciprocal with immigration.

There is no mutual dependence here.


Package deals are simply EU's way to keep things simple and uniform, I also agree it is the ultimate way to keep down bureaucracy in a perfect world, unfortunately Europe isn't a homogenous society as EU would like, unique national conditions are to be expected and respected.

Somehow they think you cannot be well educated and live in poverty in the same time. Well in a place where a librarian makes €400 a month you can.

What migration does in my experience is to select for both extremes. The best educated and the worst. Those who can have the skills to win big, and those who have nothing to lose. The average - the small town history teachers - stay home.

When the article mentions discrimination it comes accross as clueless.  The point is, very often language skills are missing - even when people can communicate they often do not know the local dialect well enough to make customers feel good.

Once someone learns the language well enough to be able not only to understand orders but to really fit in, chat, banter, shoot the shit, have fun, and thus truly be able to be accepted in a workplace community, discrimination type problems go away. But that takes time.

I think it is more realistic to demand migrants to adapt rather than to demand hosts to adapt. So for we example we are very careful to give a very international name to our first daugther. Our family name is already so. Tha way she will not look too foreign anywhere.

And, in this specific case, research and educational cooperation is dependent on free movement of labour. So that a Croatian researcher can work for EU money at a Swiss university, without pesky immigration quota getting in the way. EU money, meaning also money of Croatian taxpayers.

Switzerland is getting a lot out of that education and research deal, btw. Its universities aren't really that good, lots of Swiss people study abroad, and when EU citizens study in Switzerland it's usually because getting a bachelor or masters in Switzerland is rather easy. They really only have pedigree in Economics. On top of that, many, many, many professors are German.

When it comes to research grants, they're receiving more than they put in.

* This is a human nonsense. Any network is vulnerable to hacking. Even if 100% EU-made perfect hardware and software are used to build this, what, ""new ISP"" and the services hosted in it, it will be a major target for every intelligence agency in the world. With their $10B budget, it would only be a matter of weeks before the NSA gets access to whaterver it wants. If they can't use built-in security holes, they will hire people to give them access. That or any of the hundreds of other ways. You just cannot make a network of that size 100% secure.
* this is a technical nonsense. There is no way to build such a network with 100% EU-made hardware and software. There will be processors conceived in the US, components built in China, etc. Unless our dear politicians also plan on creating whole industries out of thin air. So whatever it is they would supposedly prevent by using EU tech, they wouldn't.
* This is a political nonsense. ""European network"" you say? Well, the UK is part of the 5 eyes, so if they have access to it, they'll share it with the NSA. And even if the UK is kept out of this euronetwork, which would be ridiculous... Both French and German intelligence agencies cooperate with the NSA. They'd share their access too.
* This is a commercial nonsense. What, Gmail, YouTube, Facebook, Amazon, etc... would be legally compelled to host their european data in this euronetwork? And how would the european users interact with the rest of the world? Data would have to be exchanged with the rest of the world, and this ""european data safe haven"" would be less than useless. Or we would just have some euro-erstaz instead?
* This is a ""technologically-philosophical"" nonsense. This wouldn't be the Internet but some sort of [splinternet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splinternet) (I don't like the term ""balkanization"", which I find condescending towards the balkans' countries).

This is just going to be another fiasco like Quaero and most (if not all) other technological projects started by politicians. In the end, this will just make Europe look like fools, and lose credibility and money (and God knows we have money to waste right now, amirite?).



If that kind of idea had been discussed the week right after Snowden's disclosures, I would have been inclined to believe it was a knee-jerk reaction (even though I'm sure that major EU governements were perfectly aware of the US/UK spying). But considering how long it's been since these disclosures started, I really can't find sense in these announcements. They can't POSSIBLY be serious and believe this is going to happen. They can't possibly believe that it could work if we did it. European people outside of Germany don't even seem to be all that upset about the NSA stories anyway (at least, that's my perception), so that's probably not even a way to try and calm down outraged populations.

Tu peux aussi regarder du côté de Dacia, ce sont des gammes Renault de voitures simplifiées (pas ou peu d'électronique) mais tout à fait correctes. Elles étaient originellement destinées aux marchés d'Europe de l'Est mais Renault s'est dit qu'il y aurait un marché pour des gens qui cherchaient des voitures simples et solides en France aussi.

Si tu achètes en France assure toi d'avoir un certificat de non gage (http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/F1360.xhtml), c'est nécessaire. 

Penses bien aussi qu'une assurance est obligatoire en France (je ne sais ce que dit la loi à ce sujet dans ton pays d'origine) donc penses bien à la faire assurer le plus tôt possible, avant de faire changer le nom sur la carte grise. Pour une voiture de prix modeste ou un peu âgée, tu peux l'assurer ""au tiers"" (en gros c'est l'assurance minimum, elle ne couvre que les dégâts que tu fais aux autres avec ta voiture et contient une protection corporelle pour le conducteur, c'est le minimum légal).

Par exemple : j'ai une vieille Twingo je l'ai mise au tiers et j'ai juste pris le bris de glace parce que ça peut arriver et que c'est toujours chiant, la logique est que même si je la mets en tout risques, en cas de vol ou de destruction ils me rembourseront presque rien de toute manière car elle n'a plus aucune valeur vu son âge donc autant faire des économies.

Aussi le vendeur doit pouvoir te présenter un contrôle technique datant de moins de six mois, le contrôle technique n'est pas obligé d'être positif mais il doit dater de moins de six mois. Si le contrôle technique est négatif tu peux toujours acheter la voiture mais prends en compte les réparations nécessaires pour qu'elle soit autorisée à rouler dans le prix d'achat.",0,1392652291,null,0,1392652835,0,cfhiazd,t3_1y27if,t1_cfhiazd,t3_1y27if,null,1432435210,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3

And once aggressivity is not needed women make about as much money as men because the truly big difference is merely in this toughness instinct, coming from testosterone. A society that tries to do everything friendly and easy and nice does not really need manly men. And this results also women becoming not feminine i.e. not submissive, but more commandeering.

Negli ultimi anni, soprattutto nel mondo anglosassone, c'e' stata una riscoperta / riemergenza del pensiero italiano in contrapposizione a quello anglosassone (filosofia analitica et similia) e francese. Cosa si intende per pensiero italiano? e' una domanda ovviamente molto difficile. Per qualcuno (Negri) il pensiero italiano non esiste (con l'eccezione secondo lui di Tronti e Muraro), per altri si. Allora cosa si intende per per pensiero italiano? da una parte il pensiero italiano sarebbe il lavoro di alcuni filosofi / scienziati politici / sociologi / culturalisti che cercano di ""riattivare"" e comprendere in un'ottica contemporanea le opere (prevalentemente dell'ultima fase) del filosofo francese Michel Foucault sul cosiddetto biopotere. dall'altra studiosi come Esposito cercano di attualizzare figure chiave del pensiero italiano come Giordano Bruno, Galileo, Machiavelli, Pasolini nel dibattito filosofico contemporaneo e dimostrare come queste figure siano sempre state lette in maniera limitata e limitante. Poi c'e' il femminismo italiano con la Cavarero e la Muraro e la filosofia della differenza sessuale. Infine gli studi sull'Autonomia operaia che continua ad affascinare generazioni di studiosi in tutto il mondo (Michael Hardt per esempio). Insomma e' un mondo ricco e variegato.

&gt;

&gt;**Public displays of affection** are acts of [physical intimacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_intimacy) in the view of others. What is an acceptable display of affection varies with respect to culture and context. Displays of affection in a public place, such as the street, are more likely to be objected to, than similar practices in a private place with only people from a similar cultural background present. Some organizations have rules limiting or prohibiting public displays of affection.

Non e' un cambiamento netto, in alcune nazioni convivono in conflitto le due nature (USA per esempio).

In che modo si manifesta oggi il biopotere degli stati? chi detiene le diverse forme di potere sulla vita oggi? Cos'e' il colonialismo in quest'ottica? e Guantanamo?

&gt;Allopathie oder ""Schulmedizin"" geht so vor, dass Symptome bekämpft werden mit Mitteln, die der Krankheit bzw. den Symptomen entgegenwirken, z.B. bei Fieber etwas Fiebersenkendes.

Ähm, nein. Das ist nur ein Teil des Vorgehens. Und zwar der, der zum Schluß kommt. Davor gibt es eine Diagnose, welche wiederum auf Ätiologie und Pathogenese aufbaut. Wer wegen einer Blutung im Gehirn Kopfschmerzen hat, wird anders medikamentiert, als jemand, der einen Kater vom Saufen hat.

La sessualità alternativa riguarda ciò che concerne la coltivazione della propria sfera sessuale e le pratiche sessuali non tradizionali (cioè tutto tranne le 4 posizioni classiche fatte in silenzio a luce spenta, che costituiscono la massima espressione di sessualità per la maggior parte delle persone).

Il mondo in cui si muove il poliamore è invece quello dei modelli relazionali alternativi e poligami. Non è l'unico modello, ce ne sono tanti (anarchia relazionale, coppia aperta, ecc. ecc.) ma non ha nessuna relazione col sesso.

Ci sono molti kinkster che sono adamantinamente monogami e ci sono poliamoristi completamente vanilla che farebbero ridere anche un papa boy.

Poi che molti kinkster siano non-monogami è un dato di fatto ma è un mondo fatto di persone mentalmente aperte verso la sessualità, curiose e senza troppi blocchi. È inevitabile che dopo un po' un solo partner inizi a stare stretto.

Comunque non dovresti sentirti minacciato dalla poligamia: nessuno lo propone come modello valido per tutti e migliore a prescindere. Anzi, di per sè crea un sacco di casini in più. Solo che a molti la monogamia tradizionale va stretta e crea disagi, frustrazioni, malessere e conduce spesso e volentieri ad abusi psicologici, violenze e sopratutto tradimenti, tradimenti, tradimenti.

They had to start somewhere I guess, but it stands to reason that if the Swiss' actions and attitude do not change on this matter, the rest of the measures shall follow.

And no, it wasn't random in the sense that it is something that specifically affects the freedom of movement of a part of the population (as opposed to something entirely different and non-related as was your suggestion). IIRC, the guillotine clause establishes to some extent the delays until various measures are to be taken.

I'm not exactly sure what your particular beef with this measure is. I get you're somehow personally angered by the fact that it affects students, but your alternative suggestions make no sense, and whether we agree that students shouldn't be the first to be affected or not is irrelevant, as it would have followed suit. If I had to guess, I'd say that they wanted to make a policy change that would be noticeable and significant, but not one that would immediately cause major economic and political halting and caos as would be the case if, for instance, they revoked the Swiss' right to work and live in EU countries without a visa or residence permit.

People from Italy are following laws and working in switzerland. If the companies there are hiring italians is because they feel it is best for their interests. Italians are not going to switzerland to beg, to make crimes. They are going to work. And they keep going because IT HAVE WORK AVAILABLE.

Switzerland have an unemployment rate of 3.5%, meaning that there is plenty jobs and opportunities to the natives, and that they NEED the labour of surrounding countries, otherwise their companies cannot grow. Lack of labour force is as big of a problem as lack of money. 

A 3.5% unemployement rate is ridiculously low. It means that everyone can get a job, and whoever is unemployed is probably between jobs or looking for their first. Jobs are simply not a  problem to Switzerland.

Do you have any idea what means integration? What means cooperation? Switzerland benefits from Italian workers, economically and socially, and Italy benefits from Switzerland opportunities, economically and socially.

Take a look at USA and how it benefited from all those WORKERS from europe. Do you think they would be half of what they are without them?

Yes, Italian economy is not in a good shape. It is wrong to expect that surrounding friendly countries will accept our WORKERS in this time where we have more work-force then jobs? 

No one is stealing no one jobs. A native always have a uphand when lookign for jobs, because of networking, know the local customs, language. If they are employing so many Italians, is that simply there arent enough swisses around to fill in the jobs.

Or do you think that italians are a lesser race that should not walk in switzerland? Thats the only possible argument.

If that is the mentality in Switzerland (I know it isnt, the biggoted won by a small margin), prepare to be left behind. China, Brazil, India are coming, and if europe doesnt update its mentality, we are going to become peripherical countries.

This stupid decision is more damaging to Switzerland then to Italy , or EU. If this go trough, expect the Swiss companies lobbying for relaxation of imigration laws in the next years.

And dont ever say ""dump"". People are not shit to be dumped.

Dont speak too soon. If you go *way* up north, many Swedes and Norwegians immigrated to man the lumber and copper/iron mines. They were the only ones that didn't mind the snow, cold, and darkness in the winter. 

Many people in these towns still speak their native languages in addition to English. They still celebrate Swedish and Norwegian holidays. Funny enough, the towns still seem to either be only Swedish or only Norwegian. You will go through one town and it will be all Swedish flags, and the next town will be all Norwegian flags.

[Here are some numbers I drew up suppporting this, 2 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/1rj7ym/bitcoin_is_the_segway_of_currency_silicon_valley/cdnymg7)


On a more visual level, you can look at [this](http://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate?timespan=all&amp;showDataPoints=false&amp;daysAverageString=1&amp;show_header=true&amp;scale=0&amp;address=) and [this](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/File:Total_bitcoins_over_time_graph.png) to see the exponential rate at which the mining value of a specific amount of computing power is decreasing.

These  exponentially diminishing returns encourage me to speculate upon bitcoins.

&gt; lets see, I payed for VPN last month an it took 30 seconds to verify transaction, comparable to amount of time it would take me to pay with paypal or CC

In that individual case it took 30 seconds, in real life it will take anywhere from 5 seconds to 8 minuutes.  This also depends upon how much of a transaction fee you pay, and having payment accepted isn't always the same payment being verified, some markets/sellers take more risk in turn for speed and accept _probable_ verifications in lieu of verifications.  My CC will always process in less than 5 seconds.  There are quite a few applications in which this might matter.  Let's say, for instance, that I wanted to bet on a virtual poker table, but don't actually trust the host to hold my bitcoins for me.  If I have reliable 10-second processing I can literally send money to the table on every round of betting, without risking an account that could be raided long-term (and this has happened in the past, repeatedly with poker sites).  With a 5-minute processing time, there is no option to do that.

Punishment, which I continually see demands for in the comments is what I see as the biggest problem in this whole debate, punishment isn't a reasonable step for anyone, which is largely my point; Trying to extort Switzerland to lay down its national interests of preserving itself is simply being a bully and extremely worrying from such a powerful entity such as the EU, if it happens.

Pensa ad esempio alla sorveglianza di massa. La nostra e' una societa' post-panoptica? In che modo le forme di disciplina carceraria sono diventate pratica quotidiana? quando? quali forze lo hanno deciso? quali sono le possibili forme di resistenza a queste spinte disciplinari?

The Greeks I know in the US are extremely successful. They're known for working hard and doing well for themselves. I would say the most similar immigrant groups would be Eastern European Jews or Chinese immigrants. They own businesses at a higher rate than most other sub-groups and tend to work themselves to the bone so they can enjoy the later parts of their lives. 

I've always thought it was amazing how (relatively) quickly they become successful. My ex-coworker was an immigrant who moved to Chicago with her parents. Her dad wanted to leave Greece to make money so he could return and retire there. He was always struggling to make ends meet so he left for the US without a strong financial safety net. He ended up being successful and realizing his dream. His house in Greece looks incredible. For her wedding gift, her and her new husband got a condo in [this neighborhood](http://blog.chicagoarchitecture.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Lakeshore-East-Park-Chicago-Illinois-May-2009-001a.jpg), which judging by the size and location, I would guess cost over $1MM. Not bad for someone who started with nothing. 

I'm friends with someone whos parents started out in a similar situation. They might not be *as* rich but they're doing well. They worked hard and saved $5.5 million and invested it into a commercial building with retail and a grocery store. The value went down to about $4.5MM. They refuse to sell it for less than what they paid, so they're causing some undue hardship on themselves. But needless to say, they will be able to retire comfortably. 

Maybe Greece should advertise itself to rich Greek-Americans as a place to retire. That would give it a good infusion of capital. Although the ones I know wont put their money in Greek banks over fear of capital controls like in Cyprus. But at least what they spend will go into the Greek economy.

That's the rationale of anarcho-capitalism right there, efficiency for whom? Large economic entities aka. multinational corporations, this focus has neither national interests nor private interests in mind, which invalidates it wholly as a primary concern for me.


I simply relate to real world problems and assume a rational stance which doesn't encompass utopian ideals which Europe isn't ready for, for which there exists ample evidence as well.


&gt; If we take away freedom of movement then we might just as well break the EU as it's efficiency is considerably reduced.

Rationally controlled immigration is going to break the EU? Then that's one weak construct if I've ever seen one, well deserving the dismantling in such a case.

Maybe that would be the good step anyway, seeing as the EU isn't much more than an economic entity right now, it should be reformed from the capital-centric into the social-centric view instead, maybe then they could see how unlimited immigration could pose a real world problem.


Maybe people on Reddit might also want to entertain the idea of thinking from a social standpoint rather than the economic one, money clouds many minds, evidence is ample here as well, just seeing so many defending the globalist agenda without even thinking once and chanting freedom is disturbing.


I will never support the EU as a economic entity more than necessary for the immediate trade agreements it offers, unless the EU is reformed into a more people-centric entity it has no place in any national policy making, be it member states or those outside.

true,LazyJaydee,FRAN,France,"France, king of protectionism? I've heard some other countries are quite good at that too :p

As for the points you make:
* if intra-EU traffic does jump through US or Asia, it is the result of one of two possible reasons: either a massive hack (or mistake) that diverted the traffic, or the path EU1 - US - EU2 is ""better"" from a technical standpoint (faster, more bandwidth, etc). The path is determined by standard protocols. You could legally compel european ISPs to add more capacity to their exchange points, making it less likely for data to travel through the US, but that isn't the same as creating a euronetwork, so I guess this isn't what they have in mind. As for the example you give, whether it's a hack or a mistake, it's both exceptional and unavoidable. No law will force the packets to travel only inside the EU.
* network equipment from EU companies, yes! We have Alcatel-Lucent, for instance, and I very much agree that having such companies is of strategic interest. Once again, you mention protectionism, and that reminds me of French minister Arnaud Montebourg calling french mobile phone operators to [favor Alcatel-Lucent equipment](http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2013/10/09/alcatel-lucent-montebourg-appelle-les-operateurs-telephoniques-a-la-solidarite_3492526_3234.html). There again, it might be questionable in motive and execution, and that's a whole other discussion, but it has nothing to do with a EU-exclusive network and data protection BS...
* Common digital market makes little sense: the Internet and the Web are both global markets. EU services would be really cool, and we do have a few of them, but as long as the US equivalents are better and/or more popular, you can't force europeans to use the european ones. Once again, there probably would be things to do to increase the appeal of the european alternatives, but this euronetwork thing isn't one of them.

To sum up: while the goals - bringing jobs in the EU, developing our ""digital economies"" etc... - are good, none of the discussions of OP's link are good ideas to reach them, and completely miss the point.",0,1392667228,null,0,false,0,cfhogto,t3_1y55uz,t1_cfhogto,t1_cfhknrr,null,1432438182,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Right, Bitcoin has the handy feature of being able to be transferred internationally.  This is a good thing, and is a feature of all cryptocurrencies, not specific to bitcoin,  Having this trait does not mean that Bitcoin doesn't have any other negative traits.  Pseudonymity is also an awesome and very helpful feature, with positive implications for privacy and freedom long term.  These features, however, are unrelated to the other traits I was talking about.

I will also note that if you want to use those bitcoins in a completely equivalent way to how you might want to use that international bank transfer, you have to first purchase bitcoins from an exchange, which will take a non-negligible fee and probably a few hours, and then have to sell those bitcoins again through an exchange, for a further fee and further waiting.  The whole process is still much more convenient than an international bank transfer, but the fees inherent in it, if you aren't working for bitcoins, paying rent in bitcoins, and buying food with bitcoins, are larger than you represented.

&gt; Can you send your money with CC to someone?

Yes, I know of several ways to do this, I prefer going through Amazon Payments.

&gt;  To people who think bitcoin is sad little game all I can say is that you're an idiots unable to comprehend the technical feat and possibilities such technology brings to the world.

Bitcoin has some good points, and good tech advances, that is cool, however some integral parts of bitcoin, which are embedded within bitcoin's core philosophy and stem from the bitcoin whitepaper are heavily disadvantageous to use as a currency long-term.  And these features are not going to change because of how tightly tied-in to the concept they are.

Pointing out that these flaws exist, and aren't going to change doesn't make someone a luddite.  It doesn't mean that they can't recognize any benefit in Bitcoin.  It only means that they are at least a little bit capable of challenging the ""Bitcoin is the one and only true way forward, PBUH"" dogma.

Bitcoin is built to manifest speculative bubbles, and will continue to do so repeatedly into the forseeable future.  I do not want the value of my money to fluctuate wildly, so I will not store any of my wealth in bitcoins.

(Note:   This doesn't mean that I refuse to use bitcoins, only that I refuse to hold on to them.  Bitcoins can be useful, just not as an actual reliable currency.)",0,1392669836,null,0,1392670612,0,cfhpqoc,t3_1y2ms4,t1_cfhpqoc,t1_cfhmtcs,null,1432438781,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,ssshane,BELG,Belgium,"Working at the European Parliament and dealing with the next legislation on Roaming here. 

The 3 consecutive roaming regulations have introduced gradual price caps - eg Roaming 3 did that for SMS, voice and data on retail (what consumers pay) and wholesale lvl. This has been very effective in driving prices down for consumers.

That being said prices are still very high (fe there's an average retail to wholesale profit margin of 700% for data which is insane) - the reason being there's just not any competition on the roaming market. Roaming 3 tried to fix that by so-called structural measures but so far failed miserably.

New legislation (the Connected Continent Regulation) that is being debated in Parliament will primarily do two things for roaming: 
1) 'abolish' retail charges on roaming by December 2015 (this date might change though through the legislative procedure)  This means you and I will pay according to our domestic tariffs when we travel. 

2) review roaming wholesale caps in June 2015. The wholesale rate is the rate at which operators 'buy' SMS, voice and data from other operators to sell to their customers. The issue is is that we NEED wholesale caps to come down along with this abolition of retail rate, in order to prevent smaller operators from being driven out of the market because of this margin squeeze (i.e. suddenly your retail margin is substantially less). As of now a review probably won't guarantee lowering wholesale caps in time to prevent this consolidation. 

The primary effect of this will be of course less competition. As a consequence this could actually lead domestic prices to rise, especially in low-cost countries (e.g. Poland, Romania, etc.), because the few big players on the roaming market will need to compensate the loss of retail roaming revenues. Less pressure on prices means they have more discretion to raise theirs. 

**TL;DR - there is new legislation to get rid of roaming altogether, but it's not being done in a structural way and would lead to less competition and more consolidation in the EU telecoms sector**

The Metro is not as intimidating as I was expecting; I live in Saint Louis, MO, where we DO have a Metro system but...well, it's nothing like a real metro system. Just take your time, check out the maps. Do you have a smartphone? If so, the ""metro paris subway"" app is AWESOME. You don't have to be connected to wifi; just punch in the station closest to you and the station you want to go to, and it connects the two. We didn't ever use a taxi or bus over the six days we were there; just the Metro. And once you do it a few times, it totally makes sense. Get the carnet (pack of 10 tickets) instead of individual ones; it'll be cheaper! 

I second Sainte-Chappelle. I really knew nothing about it but it is SO WORTH IT. The Museum Pass is awesome if you're going to be around for a few days and have an interest in art and the other museums in the city. 

The Ile de Saint-Louis is AMAZING. Great views of Notre Dame, and you can hang on the Seine. Get some ice cream from Berthillion. At night, it's just...magic.

Pour ce qui est du tourisme humanitaire, j'avoue que j'accroche pas trop à l'idée: si ce que tu veux vraiment c'est aider les gens, ton argent apportera beaucoup plus que tes compétences, à moins que tu ne sois médecin ou ingénieur dans un domaine où tu pourras mener des projets concrets.

Les gens semblaient très satisfaits de leur vie et n'avaient aucunement l'air d'attendre qu'on les sauve.

Europe does have some companies in that field, such as the french [STMicroelectronics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STMicroelectronics), but you can't really create a giant out of thin air. Airbus was not ""created"" through political will - many already existing and established companies were ""merged"" to become Airbus. Also, for computer hardware, the market is very mature, with extremely well developped companies already very well established. The barrier of entry is way too high for a new player to emerge solely on (make-believe) political will. Decreasing overseas reliance would be a good thing... but it's something that cannot be forced. The thing that would be most likely to upset the CPU market (or any hardware market for that matter) would be a major discovery or invention, that a company would commercialize. If Intel's products became obsolete, and Intel failed to adapt, then a new company would take its place. But for that to happen, you need to invest in research, in hardware startups, etc... not in some european network fantasy.

true,tephe,ROMA,Romania,"&gt;That's the rationale of anarcho-capitalism right there, efficiency for whom? Large economic entities aka. multinational corporations, this focus has neither national interests nor private interests in mind, which invalidates it wholly as a primary concern for me.

Efficiency in all areas that are vital to the internal market, even in social areas. For example:

* Erasmus and the Horizon 2020 research program (the very topic of this thread). 

* [Gallileo Sattelite system](http://www.gsa.europa.eu/galileo/benefits) under full civilian control. 

*  [Reduced roaming charges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_roaming_regulations) - I can call my friends from all over EU without having the fear that I'd get charged 1 euro per minute or more, as it was the case before EC started to regulate roaming tariffs. There should be no roaming charge in the EU.

In July 2014 1 mb of data will be maximum 0.20 euro. Compare that with Switzerland where:
&gt;Charges are considerably higher for EU residents roaming in Switzerland, and for Swiss residents in the EU, especially on internet data, which vary, but are often around €3/MB (2012).


* 112 common emergency number. EU regulations oblige telephone operators to send location data.

Small countries are never really independent, they are independent only in the frames confined by external powers. Thus the question of independence is moot. The main thing that for example Finnish state should aim is preserving Finnish language, culture and way of life, after those things have been achieved they should concentrate on making sure Finland is wealthy country. In this context, having the EU transform to a Federation doesn't really interfer with the primary mission of the Finnish state.

&gt; Sharing the debt. Will the rest of the EZ look forward to pay off Greece's debt for example? 

That is socialism. In market driven capitalistic system states can and will go from time to time bankcrupt, and that is a-okey. Do remember that all new Eurozone bonds contain clauses for renogation of the debt if necessary.

&gt; Financial transfer - permanent. Will for example the Netherlands be fine with lowering their standard of living to make sure that the Portuguese get their pensions, the Spanish schools work - and of course, that the north lower their standard so that the south get their increased.

Again socialism. We don't need any financial transfers besides the current ones that the EU already has. What we need is change of thinking. Is it the job of state and society to provide you pension, or should it maybe your responsibility to provide it?

There will be no vote. Finland is a parliamentary republic and it will be made very sure that no refenredum won't happen again. It is against our traditions.

&gt; Other Finns- play with me Do you all agree that the Finns will have no problem to give up their independence as long as they can speak Finnish? Hahaha, even now, when you give 1 % the True Finns are soaring. Please, have the vote next year, so I can be sure to save this post and show it to you when it gets the biggest no in history. Hahaha.

True Finns soared not because of EU, but because there are large number of peoples who have been left behind. Essentially we have two Finlands, we have the global intellectual and entrepneuring Finland that is highly connected and engaged to global trade, and then we have Finland that is dreaming on returning to 70s.

Not at all.

80% of our GDP is domestic.  Ignoring the Rotterdam-Antwerp Effect altogether (so I'm high balling it) then half of our remaining GDP is connected to Europe.  So, with around 15% of all UK businesses having some business with the EU, around 10% of GDP.  Yet EU regulations apply to 100% of UK businesses, and now costs [in excess of 10% GDP](http://www.timcongdon4ukip.com/docs/UKIP%20Cost%20of%20the%20EU.pdf).  Even Peter Mandelson who is as Europhile as they come admitted when in power that the benefit to GDP-regulation cost ratio wasn't in the UK's favour.

15% of UK businesses would continue having to meet EU regulations when trading with the EU, much as UK companies that trade with China must meet Chinese regulations, but we *would* still maintain trade because even the federalist groups in the EU have argued that any country such as the UK that can't follow into federalism should be granted AA status i.e. free trade and cultural agreements, [from the President of the Union of European Federalists, no less.](http://www.spinelligroup.eu/article/fundamental-law-european-union)

     ""Those states, like the UK, which may decide not to take 
      the federal step forward can opt for the status of 
      associate membership.""

So trade's not going anywhere, it just means we're taking some of the red tape both Europhiles and Eurosceptics alike acknowledge, from the yoke around Small and Medium Sized businesses.

Added to that if the likes of Switzerland and Iceland can make trade deals 1:1 with the likes of China, Japan, and Canada without all the messiness associated with getting 28 states to agree to 1, then I dare say the UK in its unique cultural position and somewhat specialised industry and services will do just fine.

Not enough to justify not using the guilliotine if push comes to shove. Just because you might not like it and would be personally effected by it, doesn't mean the rest of the 99% of people would.

I'm sure that kind of political decision needs to be more justified than this, seeing what Switzerland wants to get, see what we want to get, find some agreement that makes everyone better.

When I say ""makes everyone better"", it's not only an economic calculation. The political statement that the EU gets from that (what you're talking about) is an important aspect as well. But the whole point of this kind of negotiation is to work something with that.

Cutting all negotiation is only done once you're sure that no beneficial agreement can be reached at all, taking everyone's interests into account (including the EU not wanting to look weak). And I doubt that nothing is doable there, although of course I don't know the details.

I don't know exactly what's feasible, but you could imagine that Switzerland agrees on some rules on those quotas that work well with what the EU wants to keep allowed the most, and agree some other things in exchange, while finding some wording and presentation that makes the EU look like they negotiated strongly and got a lot out of it.

Diplomacy shouldn't be made while angry or butthurt.

But the export volume will shrink once the free market clauses get axed . 

It will simply make buying stuff made in Switzerland more expansive then buying the same stuff from within the EU Market.

- Beauvais in the one where most cheap airlines go (Easyjet, among others). It's a fair bit away from Paris, there's a shuttle bus that will drop you in town in 1h for 17€. Timetable [here](http://www.paris-beauvais.fr/horaire.php?lang=fr).

- Orly is near the city but you have to take a special train/bus to get there. [Bus info](http://www.ratp.fr/fr/ratp/r_61866/orlybus/) (7.20€, goes to Denfert-Rochereau in the south of Paris), [train info](http://www.aeroportsdeparis.fr/ADP/fr-FR/Passagers/Acces-Plans-Parking/Paris-Orly/Acces/Transports-En-Commun/rejoindre-quitter-paris-orly-rer-b-orlyval.htm) (11€30, gets you on the normal public transportation network so you can go anywhere you want).

- Charles de Gaulles is also near the city and is serviced by the regular transportation network (the B line of the RER suburban trains, specifically).  The ticket is 9.50€ and will get you anywhere, you can buy it at the airport. Just follow the blue B symbol. Depending on the terminal you go to, you might have to take a shuttle to the actual train station (it's free).

Orly and CDG also have shuttle services that are more expensive but slightly faster/less hassle-prone, and of course you can always take a cab.

My advice would be to try for CDG if possible. Do try to check for public transportation strikes/technical issues, though, especially on the way back to the airport. And of course, if you're getting there after midnight or before 6AM, the train won't be running so you'll have to take a cab/shuttle.

This would mean that some (not all but a lot) of swiss goods cant be sold in the EU as easy as now. And as fast as now since certifications need time. 

on the other hand the EU would probably loose with regards to the road traffic regulations - which are now harmonized with EU rules. But even when it comes to traffic there is a problem. SWISS - which is now a highly profitable Airline (and several smaller Airlines in Switzerland) enjoy free access to the whole european Airspace and landing rights. This would have to be renegotiated with each and every member states of the EU. Given the rather dire situation in which the airline industry is i guess that swiss airlines would get less landing rights then now. 

and those are just the examples that come to my mind now.

First: you are asking to the wrong people. Here half of the people are IT guys with degree and looking for high quality job, i guess in this very subreddit nobody has ever worked on a cement plant, or has any direct experience with the construction business in general. Yes, the economy here is bad, and the unemployement rate is very high. But i suppose that you are only interested to know the situation in your specific business, and compared to your specific country. You want to know wether the situation will be better if you move from Venezuela to Italy, but you will not receive any anwser here: because here the people will tell only their difficulties, and they compare Italy with UK, Germany and other better country. It's true: compared to those country we are in a bad situation, but compared to YOUR country? Probably moving here will give some more opportunities, even if it's not exaclty the ""land of the opportunity"". 
 You should talk with somebody that moved from Venezuela to Italy to better understand.

There is a huge job opportunity with elders' caregivers, my country is very old, you will find a lot of families with some money to pay a person to help their old parents. And no italians want to do that. Read this comment below:

&gt; However, would you/your girlfriend be willing to spend 24hrs/day with a free day per week only with an old person, who might also be impaired, unable to walk, have AD...?
If you are dreaming about a family with your girlfriend, I can't see how it's going to happen. You would have to meet in the afternoons of your free day only, outside the home you live, and carry the burden of caring for a stranger old person who does not speak your language.


The opinion of this redditor is the opinion of most of the Italians. It's an hard work and the Italians don't want to do it, they are suggesting you not to go for it, even if it is a real job opportunity.

The girls from south America are very apreciated for this job: they are nice, they can cook, they are respectful. I don't see why anybody wouldn't reccomend this for you.

I repeat: you should talk with somebody that moved from Venezuela to Italy to better understand, in this very subreddit you will find just biased opinion.

Let's see: 
&gt; Treaty provisions generally are reciprocal (apply to both treaty countries). Therefore, a U.S. citizen or resident who receives income from a treaty country and who is subject to taxes imposed by foreign countries may be entitled to certain credits, deductions, exemptions, and reductions in the rate of taxes of those foreign countries. Treaty benefits generally are available to residents of the United States. They generally are not available to U.S. citizens who do not reside in the United States. However, certain treaty benefits and safeguards, such as the nondiscrimination provisions, are available to U.S. citizens residing in the treaty countries. U.S. citizens residing in a foreign country may also be entitled to benefits under that country's tax treaties with third countries.
Foreign taxing authorities sometimes require certification from the U.S. Government that an applicant filed an income tax return as a U.S. citizen or resident, as part of the proof of entitlement to the treaty benefits.

This is dangerously wrong. When the crisis ends, folk won't just start supporting mass immigration. On a weekly basis I hear taxi drivers, engineers, civil servants, bank workers, students, oaps, shop assistants and even an air hostess give out about mass immigration. The general public are becoming increasingly anti immigration and increasingly more entrenched in that view. This won't change for a longtime. Probably never. It's not just the 'uneducated' fed up of it. It's the majority of Europe. 

&gt;Anti-immigration sentiment was particularly strong in Europe, with over 65% of Spaniards, Italians and British polled strongly or partly agreeing that ""there are too many immigrants in our country"".Sweden and Poland were the only European countries surveyed that did not have majorities who considered immigration to have a negative impact. In no country did a majority consider immigration to have been beneficial.

However, I do know that it costs around $700 to apply for American citizenship, but I think that's higher than most. So, I would imagine that applying costs a few hundred euros.

I have no idea how much a visit to a consulate costs, or if it even costs anything. I imagine you could call a consulate/embassy and ask them about expenses for free.

This is all assuming that you don't hire an immigration attorney, which, will definitely not necessary, would probably make the process a lot easier. They're expensive as shit.

As for whether or not you can keep both nationalities, I honestly am not sure. The link I provided suggests that you can keep American citizenship no matter how you attain German citizenship.

&gt; Die Dauergucker sind in der Minderheit
&gt;Am 14. Februar, das ist die neueste Quote, haben alle Deutschen, die älter als 14 Jahre sind, im Schnitt genau 250 Minuten ferngesehen – und natürlich fragt man sich, als normaler Mensch, der vielleicht eine halbe Stunde lang die „Tagesthemen“ gesehen hat, wer das arme Schwein sei, welches die 470 Minuten Fernsehkonsum auf sich nimmt, die es braucht, damit der Schnitt gleich bleibt. Und da man, wenn man sich umhört unter Freunden und Bekannten, niemanden kennt, der mehr als zwei Stunden täglich aushält, muss es, um den Schnitt zu halten, auch umso mehr Dauerfernsehgucker geben.

als kritik an einer wissenschaftlich durchgeführten Befragung nennt er das Argument, dass er seine Freunde gefragt hat, wie viel sie fernsehen?

&gt; Genug geredet
&gt; Wer die sind, das soll die Statistik der AfG möglichst verschleiern, in dem sie nicht etwa das Publikum in Altersgruppen gliedert, sondern jeweils nur die Gruppen der 14- bis 29-Jährigen, der 14- bis 49-Jährigen angibt. Und so weiter. Interessant ist der durchschnittliche Konsum der 14- bis 69-Jährigen. Die sehen 232 Minuten täglich fern. Was nichts anderes heißt, als dass der Durchschnitt von 250 Minuten nur so zustande kommt, dass jene, die älter als 69 sind, ihn nach oben treiben.
&gt; 
&gt; Was daraus folgt, ist klar: Es ist nicht etwa die Mehrheit, die öffentlich-rechtliche Programme sieht. Es sind jene Leute, welche das Lesen anstrengt und das Ausgehen erst recht, Leute, die vielleicht auch schon genug geredet haben in ihrem Leben und ein paar Abende, in denen das Fernsehen zu ihnen spricht, gut aushalten können. Es sind diese Menschen, welche man auch mit dem harmlosen Quatsch erreicht, schon weil sie für andere Abendvergnügungen wenig Alternativen haben.

Also der Durchschnitt der Gesamtbevölkerung liegt 7% höher als der Durchschnitt der 14-69 Jährigen. Kann man daraus den Schluss ziehen, dass die Öffentlich-rechtlichen ausschließlich Programme produzieren, die von Leuten über 69 gesehen werden?

Und der Rest des Artikels liest sich auch nicht besser. Ist grausam

true,Ascz,null,null,"I don't understand. You are a nice fella wanting to work hard for his salary and his family. You are the kind of person Italy desperately needs right now, but all I read are comments spreading shit about our country. I don't think this is right, nor good.
One redditor had it right: you're not looking for a high-quality high-payed job, with plenty of guarantees and a fixed place with a full time long lasting job. You're trying to change your life. You will accept almost everything.

One of my friends went to London three months in search of a job. He lived in a shithole with 4 people and came back to Italy in November. But, oh my god, London! It's the promised land for many of our fellow ambitious and disappointed citizen. But is it really it? Maybe if you have financial stabily. Maybe if you have a good education and know the language.

When moving to Italy, I think you should consider the following, trusting my advice and that of other redditors too, as I'm just offering my viewpoint but have no ambition of being totally right:

- Judging from what I'm reading, you seem to hold Italy in high regard. It seems a beautiful destination from the outside, a simple yet industrious place with wonderful scenery and art and friendly people. This is indeed right, but it differs very much geographically, and this brings us to the second point.

- Italy is divided, or better yet, trivided. We have a prosperous, industrial north with cold winters and very hot summers, rainy days, beautiful mountains and hard working people. In the north the living conditions are indeed better than in the rest of italy, but people usually don't see foreigners in good light, for a reason of pure jealousy: they are thought of stealing jobs which are rightfully for italians only. This is indeed not true, and is just a xenophobic train of thought which, unfortunately, still retains much of its strength, and with the economic crisis has spiked. The population is usually conservative, with the exception of Piedmont (north-west, near France) and, recently, Friuli (north-east, near the Balkans).
The center of Italy is ""the Italy you know"". The one you've seen in postcards, Florence, Rome, history, art, the renaissance. Friendly people, good food, many different small towns. The economy is still strong, but has suffered from the crisis. Tourism is the main attraction, as some industry and the most important caves in Italy: those of Carrara, from which comes what is considered by many the best marble in the world. You can potentially look for both jobs in the tertiary and secondary sector of the economy. I have seen many foreigners welcoming visitors or guarding museums in Florence, for example. The climate is usually temperate, somewhat cold in the centre, near the Appenines, more hot near the sea, expecially in the western coast.
The south of Italy has probably the most desiderable weather and the frendliest people. Some may say they are too friendly. The culture is very different and much more relaxed. It is evident that the State holds much less power here than in the north and in the centre. Crime is much more rampant. Unemployment has skyrocketed. The south has a lot of potential, but years of bad government, bad education and bad decisions has made it a less than desiderable land, at least in my opinion. I would advise you to skip the peninsular south (campania, calabria, basilicata in particular) and look for a future, if you'll want, in the islands: sicily and sardinia.

- In italy the labour laws are much more strict than in other countries. One may say this is a weakness of our system and of our economy. I beg to differ. It is indeed very difficult to get a full time job for an unlimited time (what we call here Contratto di lavoro indeterminato). It is easier to find one part-time or for a specific period. It is even easier to work ""in nero"", unregistered, without paying taxes nor having any guarantees. I'd obviously advise you, no matter how desperate you are, to stay within the boundaries of law. It is not unheard of workers dying on the job for precarious security conditions. Try to be safe, and try to be regulated.

- In italy, the equality of sexes is almost reached. There are still some differences, but nothing so serious as to discourage immigration. Women are statistically less payed than men, however, so here's that. Abortion is legal.

- Probably the most amazing thing for a foreigner is our national health system. You simply get free medical assistance. Hospitals are very good in the north and in the centre; there are some good spots in the south even (source: my two parents are doctors), but conditions there are generally much worse.

- You are immigrating from a south american country and are therefore safe from much xenophoby which predominantely concentrates on muslims and eastern european groups.


I am at your disposal if you are willing to ask me any more questions about Italy or my city. I live in the north, so keep that in mind because everyone of us is biased in a certain way, even if we try to be objective. PM me or answer to my comment and I'll find time to answer to all of your doubts.
I think Italy may be one of the countries with the biggest potential, both in terms of manpower and in terms of history and cultural significance. I am indeed one of the few people fortunate enough to live a good life and I realize I can dream without worrying too much (but believe me, this time is hard for everyone).",0,1392683854,null,0,1392684088,0,cfhwc91,t3_1y5wig,t1_cfhwc91,t3_1y5wig,null,1432442066,6,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,6

Or just some examples. Of goods that are or can only be produced in Switzerland. No doubt that they exist. But they are only a tiny fraction of the 90 billion € export volume Switzerland has to the EU at the moment. 

But lets have a look at what is the main mass of export goods from CH to the EU. 

More then 50 % of the export goods fall into this categories : 

Chemicals and related products -&gt; so chemicals produced in large quanties and pharmaceutical products (which can be produced anywhere in the world and which will have the additional hurdle of EU recertification if it comes to the worst) 

Manufactured goods classified chiefly by material -&gt; which encompasses everything from simple plastics to High Technology goods. There is also office / telecom equipment in this category. While i guess that there will be some companies that produce unique goods in this category most of it can and is produced by other companies in the EU already. 

Machinery and transport equipment : Same as above. There might be some swiss companies that produce very specialised goods in this category. But most of it will be run of the mill more or less standard goods that can be bought from numerous sources in the EU. 

Switzerland and swiss goods are not unique. (well most are not) and thus can be replaced.

The bad: I don't want to be the 100th voice to tell you how hard it is in Italy, but the infrastructure has gone downhill since 2008 and there's very little stability. Living expenses like rent, food and phone/internet keep climbing but the country keeps crumbling and hemorrhaging jobs and its youth. It's a very hard life. However, it doesn't sound that much different than what you're going through in Venezuela. BUT, many South Americans who come over to Italy are convinced that it'll be a similar culture/language, but they tend to feel very alienated because the cultures (and food, obviously) are actually very different.

The good: It sounds like domestic work is beneath you based on your experience, BUT, for caretaker, housekeeper, domestic help and nanny jobs, for whatever reason, South Americans (and Filipinos) are much more desirable than, say, Romanians, Moroccans and Russians/Ukrainians. Many of these jobs are full-time, paid 'in nero'/cash, and can score you free room and board in gorgeous houses, decent wages, and a lot of times, the employer becomes an adoptive family. I've seen many Italians arrange legal and working papers for their caretakers which leads to free healthcare as Italians seem to be good advocates for their hired help. BUT, I've never been a caretaker and I imagine it's really hard work and you totally lose your identity. For the record, nannies are usually around 20 to 30 years old, while the caretakers for old people are usually in their 40s and 50s. I also know lots of South American guys your age who do cash-only handy work like repairing stuff in houses and moving furniture. I just don't know if you could live on that and be happy.

FYI there are TONS of Peruvians in North Italy so if you know any Peruvians, ask around as chances are that they'll know someone who's immigrated to Italy and might have good advice.

You're not taking into account most trade wars are tit-for-tat. If the EU starts imposing import tariffs on Swiss goods, it is very likely Switzerland would retaliate by imposing import tariffs on EU goods. It does not make logical sense, but trade wars often hurt both parties. That has never stopped them from happening countless times throughout history though.

I'm not Swiss, but that is just plain wrong. Two of the worlds largest pharmaceutical companies are Swiss, and Nestle is an absolutely massive consumer products company. There are many other large Swiss companies, including watches, but those are nowhere near the top. Switzerland spends the same amount of its GDP on R&amp;D as Germany, so there are a lot of research based companies there as well. This leads to the creation of specialty products that can only be produced in Switzerland because another company is not going to invest huge sums of money to produce a similar product to compete with the Swiss one, they will put their money elsewhere. 

Switzerland might be a small country, but its economy is large given its size. This vote will likely hurt output, but Switzerland does produce things. ",1,1392685647,null,0,false,0,cfhx3d2,t3_1y6ech,t1_cfhx3d2,t1_cfhsncd,null,1432442419,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,Aberfrog,ASTR,Austria,"&gt; Do you expect me to have a full list of Swiss products? 

no that would be ridiculous. But lets have a look at the examples you gave. 

&gt; Switzerland is leading in tunnel construction

Not so much. Switzerland does built a lot of Tunnels. True. The companies that built them are not only swiss though. For example the Gotthard Base Tunnel is built by a consortium of 3 non swiss and 2 swiss companies. 

&gt; exports specialties such as chocolate and cheese

so does belgium. Plus chocolate exports are 650 Mio. € out of 90 Billions. Doesnt really count much. And chocolate is not really hard to produce. The last major technological advancement (and the reason for swiss dominance in this field for a long time) was the conche - but it was invented / discovered more then 100 years ago. 

Agricultural goods actually account for 1.5 % of the exports to the EU from Switzerland. 

And belive me - if Lindt looses buisness from this - they will start the produce ""as good as swiss chocolate"" in the EU. 

&gt; is an important manufacturer of medical products and chemicals

absolutely no doubt about that. But chemicals can be produced anywhere in the EU. and when it comes to pharmaceuticals - If the guillotine clause is invoked they have to be recertified in the EU - a long and expansive endeavour. So why should Roche and all the others not just produce in the EU and get rid of that pesky little problem. 

&gt; their research and development in all kinds of areas is outstanding.

true - but as we speak here it seems that the EU already has stopped negotiation for the horizon program with Switzerland. a program (which if as successful as its predecessor) would bring nearly 2.5x the amount of money to swiss universities and research institutions as the swiss paid into the pot.

&gt; It's pretty sweeping and simplified remark to say that we can simply copy these products and do without their R&amp;D. This will also be painful for the EU.

We dont have to copy. The products already exist. What will be painful (for some maybe) is a bit less competition. But thats it. And when it comes to R&amp;D ? The swiss research facilities are good - no question. But the money that fed them so far stays and will just be redistributed to other institutes within the EU. I wouldnt worry so much about that.

2. si tu es juste décalée [certaines personnes ont plus de mal à se remettre d'aplomb] tu vas être obligée de te fatiguer pour retrouver le rythme. Ca + te vider un peu la tête, avec de la discipline ça va marcher. J'ai réussi à me recaler normalement en 2 jours après avoir pesté pendant je sais pas combien de temps, simplement en allant courir ou nager (il faut quand même que ça ait une certaine intensité, pas juste de la trempette ou 5 minute de jogging), en mangeant bien (tu manges peut-être trop / pas assez le soir) et en allant dormir dès que je sentais un peu de fatigue même si j'avais initialement prévu de me coucher un peu plus tard. Aussi éviter les siestes l'après-midi, même si tu es un zombie.

Bon là je suis re-décalée mais c'est juste que j'ai relâché les efforts. Tous ces conseils ont aussi un effet positif sur l'anxieté, et comme tu dormiras mieux ça fera un cercle bénéfique. Après faut pas lâcher sinon tu te retrouve de nouveau sur reddit à 3h. J'ajoute la sophrologie/méditation/yoga, tous ces trucs sont bons, encore une fois c'est une question de discipline.

i know - but the 6 % in trade that will partly be lost (not totally just partly) will not hurt the EU in total. Switzerland is bound to loose more and sooner or later its population will accept that. might be later though. 

&gt; I'm not Swiss, but that is just plain wrong 

No actually i am right. Lets just look at the examples you gave. 

&gt; Two of the worlds largest pharmaceutical companies are Swiss 

True - and as soon as they start the feel that their products ""Made in CH"" are less cost competitive (due to renewed certification for example needed to sell in the EU) they will ramp up their production in the EU plants and cool down production in their swiss plants. Those are multinationals. They are not bound by borders where they produce and in large parts the infrastructure is already in place. 

&gt; Nestle 

The same in food. Of the 340.000 employees of Nestle 8900 work in Switzerland. Nearly half of those 9000 work in the HQ and research divisions in Switzerland. So if it gets harder to sell Swiss made Nesquik in Baden Württemberg - they will simply ship french made there. The bottom line wont be touched.  

&gt; Switzerland spends the same amount of its GDP on R&amp;D as Germany, so there are a lot of research based companies there as well 

Absolutley true. But if you look at the why that is - you will find that CH profited extremly from several EU programs which they were part of so far. Programs in which swiss participation or the negotiation about that have already been shelved as a result of this vote. If it stays like that expect this ratio to go down south pretty fast. 

&gt; but Switzerland does produce things.

never said that they dont. 

I said that a lot of the stuff they do produce is mass produced and can be produced in the EU as well. Nobody is doing it now since the swiss have the market cornered. But if they cant offer their services to a competitive price anymore - well lets just say that new options arise.

&gt; Regulations that ensure high product standards are often good for both the consumer and the producer, for example.

On theory, yes. On practice, it's used by big corporations to drive out smaller competitors out of the market and to ensure more monopoly power.

New companies often can't afford to spend much on their legal departments and have more trouble navigating through all the required bureaucracy and complying with all the regulations, which on most cases are pushed forward not by consumer protection groups but by the already existing companies.

So while regulations isn't a dirty word, I personally would favour a very competitive market over a well regulated market any day. I just don't trust the politicians and the corporate lawyers that write those regulations.

&gt;In this case, however, regulations at the European level is no different from regulations at the national level. It's only an order of scale higher.
