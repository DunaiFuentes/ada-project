Oh, I am sorry to hear that.

You'll be living not too far from where I live, as it happens. I'm a few miles away, in a very rural area; the sort of place you can leave your car unlocked. I wouldn't necessarily advise you to do that in Erlensee, but it's essentially a dormitory town for the Rhein-Main conurbation, and far enough away from Frankfurt to be unaffected by Frankfurt's relatively high crime rates.

As has already been said, crime rates in Germany are relatively low, especially with regards to violent crime. Theft, burglaries and various forms of fraud are obviously a concern as they are in most places, but just take the normal common-sense precautions and you'll be fine.

Incidentally, for a nice day out with lots of picture-postcard type views, take a local (RB or RE) train from Hanau Hbf to Kahl (Main), and from there the number 50 bus bound for Aschaffenburg. Get off at ""Fähre Seligenstadt"" and take the ferry across. Stop for an ice-cream at the Eiscafé Maintor, the first ice-cream place you see when you get off the ferry. Once you've had a good look at the town, find your way to the train station and get the train back to Hanau.

You'll know, by the way, which is right stop to get off the bus if you sit near the front. After the bus leaves Kahl it goes through open country. When you see a massive church suddenly appear in front of you, that's the stop.

Es reicht doch schon aus, wenn die Kühlpaste zu lange nicht gewechselt wurde. Plötzlich soll sie höchstleistung zeigen und schafft es nicht mehr. Puff schaltet sich die CPU ab weil ihr zu heiß ist.

Bis zum Finale wird aber mit sicherheit hinter den kulissen noch viel optimert und das eine oder andere backup system verbessert. So sehr ich über die GEZ meckern möchte, die technik dahinter ist atemberaubend komplex und es gibt in solch großen systemen immer das ein oder andere Problem.

Autrement dit, que le rendement du capital augmente avec la taille du capital.

C'est dû à plusieurs choses, l'éducation, le temps, la capacité d'embaucher des gens, l'accès asymétrique à l'information, le ticket d'entrée élevé à certains investissements (désolé, tu ne peux pas dire que le marché est neutre de ce point de vue là quand certains investissements ont un ticket d'entrée à un million) et en effet le profil au risque font que les fonds plus gros ont un meilleur rendement. 

Je comprends que toi tu t'amuses pas mal à faire tes investissements et que ton rendement n'est pas mauvais en ce moment, mais franchement, dire que ton passe-temps est la solution à l'inégalité c'est comme si je disais que pour résoudre le chômage il suffit que tout le monde apprenne à programmer, puisque ça marche pour moi.

true,PyotrPan,null,null,"I think this illustrates both positives and negatives of authoritarian rule: 
First, a country under authoritarian leadership is usually able to reach a decision and respond to situations quickly. In this case of annexation of Crimea it is assumed that only 4 people took part in the decision making: Putin, Ivanov (Putin's chief of staff), Patrushev (security council secretary), and Bortnikov (Head of FSB). 


The common denominator here is the background they all share, from the KGB. They all think alike, they all have no regard for human life, no respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine and they all share the idea of a strong Eurasia, with Russia as the dominant player.

While yes, the Russian annexation of Crimea can be regarded as a victory on a tactical sense, strategically it is horrendous:  Sanctions, which will hurt the Russian economy and perhaps even drive it into a recession: After the Russian economy’s supply-driven boom wanes off, sanctions sends a strong signal to foreign investors to avoid at all cost, and make no mistake, Russia needs foreign investment, increased awareness of NATO importance in Europe, and subsequent increases in military funding, and an ever increased European agenda to lessen the reliance on Russian gas and oil. 


As an example here you should look at the gas deal Russia recently signed with China, where it is not even clear if Russia will break even… They have been in negotiations for this deal for over ten years, and just recently signed it. To me, it looks like a desperate attempt to turn towards the east. Now they are even in talks with DPRK to increase trade. 


And this is where a less authoritarian government is better; while it might take longer to actually reach a decision, the decisions are usually sounder, more correct and strategically proper.


I think this will be regarded as Putin’s biggest mistake as the effects will begin to present itself.

true,jeanralph,ZBSVUE,U-E,"&gt; On a déjà parlé de féminisme, tu sais que je suis d'accord avec toi sur la majorité des sujets

Pas mieux, t'as fait exploser mon nombre d'upvotes RES sur ce sub d'ailleurs et autant sur le fond que la forme de tes posts (ça + ton intérêt pour les filles de l'Est + tes connaissances aussi précises que délicieusement random sur des sujets obscurs pour l'occidental moyen, deux autres de mes hobbies) j'ai des fois l'impression que t'es potentiellement un clone dont j'ignorais l'existence. Bon maintenant qu'on a délimité les trucs sur lesquels on est d'accord, autant aborder celui sur lequel il va probablement falloir ""just agree to disagree"" comme ils disent.

Les mecs qui s'adonnent au harcèlement sexuel de rue comme ça ont clairement peu de respect pour les femmes, je le conteste pas. Est-ce que leurs dérapages contre les filles relèvent forcément d'une autre nature que le reste des incivilités et des personnes à qui ils s'en prennent ? Je peux me tromper, mais je ne pense pas. Comme éléments spécifiques il y'a sûrement une méconnaissance des codes sociaux appropriés de leur part qui se traduit facilement en colère, auxquels tu peux rajouter une dose de frustration sexuelle.

J'ai toujours en tête l'exemple d'une amie immigrée récente en France (et ""*dans une autre vie elle m'a fait côtoyer des petites frappes qui s'amusaient à ça*"" et à d'autres méfaits, mais ça c'est ma phrase copyrightée et je te soupçonne de l'avoir piquée :)). En gros elle reçoit pas mal d'attention de la part de toutes sortes de mecs, dont les petites frappes dont tu fais référence, la différence est qu'elle maîtrise bien leurs codes puisqu'elle habite dans une cité et qu'elle provient directement d'une société bien macho. Du coup elle sait leur expliquer avec leurs mots son désaccord et elle n'a jamais de gros problèmes avec eux. Ce qui m'amène à penser que le mépris de ces mecs pour les femmes qui les rejettent est peut être davantage une histoire de forme que de fond.

Tout ça pour dire que depuis mon expérience empirique limitée sur le sujet, le harcèlement de rue me paraît relever plus du sentiment d'aliénation, du manque de respect généralisé (donc pas uniquement limité aux femmes) et du fossé socio-culturel plutôt qu'à une différence profonde et systémique qui vise spécifiquement les femmes.

J'en profite pour rebondir sur : 

&gt; Une femme qui baise pas, c'est une connasse, une femme qui baise, c'est une pute

C'est sûrement une conception sexiste qui existe vraiment, mais de la même manière qu'un mec qui aborde en s'y prenant mal c'est un ""beauf misogyne"" ou un ""salaud"" et qu'un mec qui n'aborde pas mais reste seul c'est un ""puceau"" ou un ""pédé refoulé"". Bien des hommes comme bien des femmes ont des attentes contradictoires et sexistes à propos d'autrui, c'est comme ça.

What? vabbeh, passiamo oltre:

&gt; I tablet sono molto verosimilmente pericolosi per la salute, da un punto di vista neurofisiologico, tanto più che gli utenti sono prevalentemente giovani3.

Ah, c'è la citazione, sarà una roba seria. Andiamo a vedere:

Però non vedo come si possa digitalizzare l'ora di applicazioni tecniche al tornio, per dire.

Altro dubbio: alcune famiglie potrebbero non avere la possibilità di permettersi un pc o un tablet.

Ich meine, wenn mir ihr Spiel gefallen würde, ich es also im Sinne des Unterschieds zwichen Toleranz und Akzeptanz akzeptieren könnte, würde sich die Frage nach Toleranz gar nicht stellen. Ich habe den Eindruck, dass Toleranz wichtig ist, wenn unauflösbare Konflike - und sei es nur, was das ästhetische Empfinden betrifft -auftreten. Toleranz ist, wenn man emotionale Abwehrreaktionen rational überschreiben kann, weil man das für richtig oder praktisch hält. 

Also Akzeptanz auf der kognitiven Ebene führt zu Toleranz auf der emotionalen Ebene. So in der Art verstehe ich den Unterschied. Insofern würde der folgende Satz für schon Sinn machen:

Russia says this as a deterrent against what it sees as potential NATO aggression, but similarly again this is why Russia would never dream of picking a fight with NATO in the first place.

Now I realise your point of view still stands against what I've written here (and it is opinion, as we can't claim to know the future and any actual outcome of such acts) but just consider that if the USA bailed out of a defence pact it would absolutely screw them in unimaginable ways - and the same goes for everyone else, too.

But let's put it this way instead (and these are serious questions to you, tell me specifically where you think this would break down):

Russia invades Latvia. Do you think Lithuania and Estonia would sit by and do nothing? (Consider that they would almost definitely be next if Russia could get away with such a thing!)

So unless you think Estonia and Lithuania would literally not intervene when Russia invades Latvia - what do you think Poland would do when Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are at war with Russia?

Would Poland really sit by and do nothing, too? And consider the consequences for any of these countries not honouring their legal defence commitments. No one would ever sign one with them again - they might as well just bend over to Russia because there's no way in hell anyone would ever help them out if they were invaded.

So unless you think Poland would stand by while Russia is at war with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania --- do you seriously think the US would forsake one if it's major defence partners?

Or, for that matter, the rest of Europe - Germany, France, UK?

And I'm not just trying to stretch the realms of likelihood here. I seriously cannot see how any of these things could *not* happen.",0,1402944666,null,0,false,0,ci93u17,t3_289wcu,t1_ci93u17,t1_ci93a0t,null,1434265747,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

He never said there was anything wrong with becoming a federal state, merely that he could not see it working.

&gt;The federal current is above the will of governments and even the will of the people. It is slowly taking place across all continents. NA, SA, Asia. We just happen to be further along which is actually part of our advantage.

&gt;Can you imagine a federal Asian continent? The kind of weight such a state would have to throw around?

I do not see how a potentially federated Asia, North America or South America means that Europe should also be a federation. It is irrelevant. Federation will never happen unless a majority in all countries (of politicians or regular citizens) wills it - If no one wants it to happen, it won't.

&gt;Also, you are part of a Union of 28 now member states. If the rest want a federal Europe who are you (a single state) to hold everyone back through blackmail and extortion?

The EU can still work with some states federalising and other states staying as they are in the same way the EU works today. A state is not going to be forced into federalisation: Just because a single state does not want to become part of the federation does not mean no one else can create a federation. ""Who are you to hold everyone back through blackmail and extortion?"" Well, desiring independence is one thing - We have a right to self-determination, do we not? Blackmail and extortion is not equal to the desire for independence and autonomy. Who are you to force those who do not wish to be part of a federal Europe to join?

&gt;WHO ARE ""YOU"", to live a comfortable life, buy your iPhone and your expensive clothing, while people in the Philippines for example live and struggle with poverty beyond your comprehension, on a daily basis.

Those who were born into rich nations never chose to be born there, just as those who were born into poor nations never chose to be born there. People cannot be blamed for growing up in a country where they have comfort and have grown used to it. I don't understand how this is relevant to the debate on federal Europe however - I agree with a free movement of people, and we have that in the non-Federal EU. The EU itself has borders which makes it difficult for the poor of other nations to enter the EU. It seems that you are just attempting to make people feel bad by guilt-tripping them even though it's not relevant to the subject of ""Could a Federation of Europe work effectively and efficiently, replacing the individual member states of the European Union?"".

I am pro-EU. I am pro-Federation. However, I find your post accusative, insulting and aggressive.

The idea is that either you want to have prostitution, or you don't. If you do (which is certainly simpler - I have no opinion on the morals of it), just make it a legal and regulated trade so prostitutes can get decent working condition and you can still fight human trafficking. If it's half-legal (light green and blue) you can't control it at all.

If you don't want prostitution, you need to prosecute people. Prosecuting prostitutes (dark red) is counter-productive because they're usually the victims of trafficking rings, you'll just make those organisations treat them even more like expendable scum (they can replace them easily, they import them). It's usually based on the old, stupid view that those filthy whores are subverting innocent men, but we're no longer in the 19th century. Prosecuting organisers is of course better, but there may not be enough of a deterrent if you don't prosecute clients as well (pink). It's not insane, they're engaging knowingly in unlawful activity.

Of course it is, you must be a guy, eh? [THIS IS THE WORST KIND OF DISCRIMINATION -- THE KIND AGAINST ME.](http://imgur.com/zzTV21f) 

Fuck attitudes like this. Nobody forces you to use a prostitute. On the other hand, prostitutes are often trafficked and/or have not many other choices. It is the prostitute we should feel sorry for, not the horny (mostly) men who wanna fuck one. Poor men, forced into fucking a hooker, the plight of not being able to pick up a bar skank, forced into deprivation of using a call girl. 

Now, I disagree with the Norwegian/Swedish approach, but I don't think it is 'the most stupid one'. I think the one practised in Russia and the rest of Eastern Europe is worse, going after prostitutes. Prostitutes won't stop prostituting if they are arrested. They're already living a life of crime. On the other hand, johns, the men who come to prostitutes, well, they may be deterred if they knew there were police looking out for them. It's quite embarrassing for them to be caught.

I used to be like most of you, and think it should be legal but regulated. Now I'm a big supporter of the Swedish-Norwegian model. It protects the prostitutes, who in many cases are severely disadvantaged people (men and women) that would choose to do another line of work but get stuck. Why do I think this?

A few years back I was in Frankfurt and myself and an American ladyfriend decided to check out one of the brothels, just for shits and giggles. On the third place we tried, we managed to get in by pretending to be a couple looking for something kinky on our anniversary. Went up the stairs, and it was about three levels of a single long corridor on each level, room after room with gaudy pink lighting. In a few of the rooms, there were women standing in the doorways waiting for a client, most of which were smoking, but all of which had dead, impassive eyes of someone that was either on drugs, or wished they were, or at the very least were blocking out memories of prior nights and trying to prevent memories forming of that one. The entire place reminded me of a battery farm, but for people. 

Simply put, I don't think it in any way supported principles of human dignity, nor do I think these women would have been there if they had another choice. They were women that fell through the cracks of society, couldn't get out, and were stuck.

Now, I'm sure there are some high-priced 'escorts' that are happy doing what they're doing, with the money and benefits they get, and so on. And the Swedish-Norwegian system pretty much ensures that people can continue doing that if they choose. But what I saw in Germany struck me to my core, and whilst I already knew I never wanted to pay for sex, this experience just reinforced that feeling a thousand-fold.

EPITA is one particular school because it's really ""project"" oriented, you will get courses the day and you'll have to do projects (mostly programming) the rest of the day (and nights), both with teammates and alone. That's why I would suggest to go through the first year (M1) since it's a very dense program. After this first year you'll get to do an internship of 5-6 months and then move on to the next year.

Once there, finding internships is not difficult at all (in France anyway) and being from EPITA might be an asset. The school regularly invites companies to recruit students, so yes, that's pretty helpful and I haven't had difficulties to find something :-)

true,Aemilius_Paulus,RUSS,Russia,"&gt;What does my gender have to do with it?

Because prostitution is a unique case, it is almost all-female in the 'service' part of it and almost all-male in the 'client' part. 

&gt;If trafficking, slavery and exploitation already are crimes, why do you need a secondary §, that harms all the people who want to engage in it for free and on their own will?

I can agree with that, sure, but why would you say that Sweden and Norway are the worst though? How are they the worst? As far as I can see, they're only the worst because they punish men. You're a man. You don't seem to have as much of a care about nations where the prostitutes were arrested, since you only chose to speak out against the nations that went after the men soliciting prostitutes. 

Which is funny because prostitutes already have a sorry lot in life without the police after them on top. In contrast, I don't hold much sympathy for men who willingly solicit hookers whilst being aware of the fact that illegal prostitution is a sordid affair linked to many human rights abuses. 

&gt;All you will accomplish is to force it into the back alleys.

Exactly, which is why I support legalisation of prostitution. However, if prostitution is not legalised in a certain nation, I would object a lot more if only the prostitutes were arrested as opposed to only the solicitors being arrested. The solicitors bear a greater moral crime here, they solicit willingly and they solicit despite having no dire need of a hooker. It's not oppression that you can't use a prostitute.

 Sex trade is unacceptable since it's incompatible with freedom and gender equality. It puts the seller, often a woman, in a position where she is being exploited by mostly men. That view is based on earlier Government studies on the issue. 

The previous studies also found that prostitution often led to other crimes being commited. The main concern for them seems to be human trafficking. 

So, because of this, prostitution must be reduced and then eliminated. They want to hit the demand side of sex trade since they view it as a form of exploitation while they don't view the selling of sex as a crime. 

Lastly, they report that sex trade has shrunk by 50% since the ban was introduced in 1999 and that public support for the current law is at around 70%.

This is deliberately to motion against the Federalists as per ""...explains why it won't be fielding a candidate.""

* The media managment therefore needs to throw Cameron a ""little victory"" to avert the above snowballing out of control. Because as you point out the AECR have pittance of influence.

* The mismatch is that Economic ties are promoted to the public which docilely accept this. Yet behind the scenes political integration is then carried on by the elites. This is factual track record: ECSC -&gt; EEC -&gt; EC -&gt; EU -&gt; Federal USE

&gt;*What is seen as =/= What is* (1)

This is why in 1999 The Santer Commission rephrased ""More Integration"" =&gt; ""Reform"".

Cameron now adopts this language of ""reform"" also given the mismatch (1). However it is appearances for the public consumption, not for the political project of the EU's future which Federal USE as per the Lisbon Treaty = 90% EU Constitution.

Therefore the simplest explanation is:

1. Juncker will step-aside for the good of the EU

true,aragost,null,null,"&gt; Ciao! I'm from the UK and I'm going to Milano to study for a semester (October-March) at the PoliMi Bovisa campus.

Ciao! Thanks for choosing us :)

&gt; Currently in the process of sorting out accommodation and just wanted some advice.
We're looking at an apartment on the corner of Via Carlo Farini and Viale Stevio. Is this a nice area to live in? 

The area it's not bad (definitely not as sketchy as Bovisa as others pointed out), but not really glamorous either. 

&gt; What's the area actually called? 

No specific name; “zona via Carlo Farini - Viale Stelvio” identifies it pretty well, as they are two big and well known streets (Google Maps labels it just “Farini”). It's not far from other “named” areas such as Maciachini (northern end of the urban part of metro line 3, and civilized life for that matter), Isola (the quickly rising “new place to be” with hipsters and all), and Garibaldi (a train station, to the south of which lies the most fashionable area).

&gt; Is 480 euros pm a decent price for a single room?

Definitely. In a more requested area (closer to the central universities (did you know there are seven universities in Milan?), for instance) it would seem suspicious, but there it might be just honest.

&gt; Also, do you think it's a massive issue that I can't speak any Italian? Going to do some studying over the summer but I'm still pretty nervous..

Some of the degree courses in engineering (making a guess here about your destination) have english versions of all the exams; this could help you a lot, but check out the situation for the degree course you'll be studying for.

&gt; I'm also looking to travel around Italy a bit while I'm there. How easy is it to go to other places, specifically Aosta and other skiing places?

It's a 2 hours drive to the skiing destinations in Valle D'Aosta, specifically Cervinia, Courmayeur and Pila. There are coaches departing from the city to those destination, and in winter you'll find offers which include transportation and access to the slopes. Skiing in Lombardy is in my opinion not worth the hassle, especially since transportation is ironically more complicated. If you have some days to spare, I suggest you consider a longer trip to the dolomites.

Getting to the rest of Italy... depends. High speed trains will take you to Torino, Bologna, Firenze, Roma, and Napoli (all worth a visit) in a very short time, while smaller destinations are more complicated.

&gt; Any general tips about studying/living in Milano or cool places to visit in the area would also be much appreciated. Really looking forward to coming to your country! Grazie :)

That's broad enough for a book :)
Some random thoughts:

* Milan is different enough to cater to everybody: both the fashionista and the alternative punk will find what they're after. Concerts, art exhibits, food events, just don't be lazy! :)
* The engineers in PoliMi (especially in the Bovisa campus) aren't what they used to be; romance abounds for those seeking it.
* As I wrote above, we have 7 universities, easily topping 100k students. The PoliMi alone has 4000 foreign students.
* Milan in autumn / winter gets COLD. But it's also the season when it shines the most, so excellent choice of period!
* The best way to get to PoliMi Bovisa is with the Suburban rail system. Lines S1-S2-S3-S4-S5-S6 all stop in either “Milano Bovisa Politecnico” or “Milano Villapizzone”, which is just on the other side of the campus. (add 10 minutes walk if you'll have to go to the near Bovisa Durando campus). I'd look for accommodation near one of these lines.
* The 90/91 bus line, which is near places we've discussed, is the sketchiest thing in the city. 
* Since you'll be learning Italian, check out /r/italianlearning and http://italian.stackexchange.com/
* Feel free to PM and ask for further information, especially regarding the university, moving around the city and what to do/eat/drink :)",0,1402949674,null,0,false,0,ci96fhl,t3_289rbf,t1_ci96fhl,t3_289rbf,null,1434267035,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

true,flyingorange,VOJV,Vojvodina,"As a Hungarian I see it as an awful place and prison of nations, although I know some people think differently. Some people think the Austrians brought order and civilization, but a little research in our history always shows that they in fact destroyed what was genuinely native and replaced it with their system.

In the 16th century the Habsburgs captured the western part of the country after the last native kind died fighting the Turks. Then for the next 40 or so years they fought against the Hungarian nobles, trying to establish themselves as rulers of the country, and left the Turks to plunder the country. Those Hungarians who were still independent were Protestants so of course this didn't help calm the situation with the Most Catholic Austrians. To illustrate this, the Protestant Hungarians often allied themselves with the Muslim Turks against the Habsburgs, because they hated them even more. Then came 150 years of almost constant fighting during which most of the population of the country died.       
When the Habsburgs finally conquered all of the country it was mostly empty swamps and marshlands, most of the cities and villages were depopulated. They destroyed most of the fortresses so that the Hungarians could not use them to rebel - this is why today we barely have any castles that are older than 300 years. They continued to religiously opress the Protestants so nowadays most Hungarians are Catholic. Latin was the official language of the state until the mid 19th century.

They crushed every rebellion and when they weren't strong enough they brought in others. Medieval pre-Habsburg Hungary was a multi-ethnic kingdom where everyone lived in peace and harmony. The Habsburg changed this by giving tiny privileges to the Serbs, Croats, Romanians etc. who were kept as loyal subjects that could always be used to crush a Hungarian revolt. In 1848 they weren't enough so they had to bring in the Russians. The Habsburgs murdered the first prime minister of Hungary and executed most of the generals. The most famous poet also died in the fighting and many people had to flee abroad.

Then they started WW1 because some asshole from their inbred family was shot.

I may imagine that most prostitutes do not decide that selling sex is fun and games. The purchasers of sex, however, have a choice - they may choose to not spend their money.

Brothels are illegal, but are often tolerated because they can provide a safer working environment for the women who do it.

The quote you've taken is from a club owner, not a prostitute. Incorrectly attributing a quote is dishonest, espcially as prostitutes make nowhere near the same money. Here's a quote from a prostitute:

&gt; On a ""good day"" she sees six clients but sometimes only one -- at 50 euros per visitor not enough to cover her half of the 150 euro daily rent.
""But I can't do it for 20 or 30 euros like some of the others. That is not money.""

Kinderschänder und diese entsprechend angreifen. 

""Wir"" gegen ""die anderen"".

Wie du schon schriebst, selbst ""Nonkonformisten"" wie Punks oder Grufties oder dergleichen haben eine eigene Gruppe gebildet von ähnlicher Musik, Mode und Ansichten in denen sich die Gruppe wieder gegenüber anderen abhebt und sich dadurch besser fühlt.

Der biologische Ursprung ist auch klar - Menschen sind Gruppentiere die ähnlich wie viele Affenarten am liebsten in Kleingruppen unterwegs sind und diese verteidigen. So haben sie besseren Schutz gegen Raubtiere und können sich wichtige Aufgaben teilen (Nestbau, um Nachwuchs kümmern, nach Raubtieren und Nahrung Ausschau halten). Genau deswegen sind ja dann auch andere Gruppen eine Bedrohung weil sie die gleichen Ressourcen streitig machen. Das sieht man schön bei den Ureinwohnern in den Regenwäldern die es heute noch vereinzelt gibt (z.B. die Yanomami). Diese Dörfer bekämpfen sich seit Jahrhunderten gegenseitig wenn sie aufeinander treffen und rauben auch Nahrung und Frauen der anderen.

Tutti i cellulari di fascia alta hanno un hardware superiore all'iphone, processori più veloci, doppia o tripla memoria, sistema più avanzato. 

Ad esempio hanno tutti uno schermo più definito. Anche cellulari di fascia bassa come il moto g sono migliori, ma se dici che ha uno schermo ""720p 329ppi"" è una cosa mentre se dici che l'iphone ""ha un retina display (dalla retina degli occhi)"" sembra che sia speciale e capisci il potere del marketing.

And the entire Swedish society has historically been like that (aside of the immigrants of course), look up the [Law of Jante.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante) Maybe it has roots in the Lutheranism, but I doubt that. All North Germanic descendants of the Vikings are now among the most pussified and effeminate people on the planet, but Sweden is an extreme among extremes.

Anarchists roam the Swedish streets, invading the houses of the members of Swedish Democrats in their houses and beating them, major newspapers publish the names of people who commented on an politically incorrect Swedish website, only for the people to be harrassed and fired from their jobs... And the government turns a blind eye on that, because it's full of the exact same extremists Swedes elected. Swedes themselves want it to be like that.

As far as cities go you could try capitals. Rome is beautiful and so is Prague, but it depends on what you like to do. If you like to experience art and culture Rome is the choice, but if you like to hit the pubs Prague is a better alternative.

If you want cities a bit closer I would recommend Berlin or Amsterdam. If you like to experience nature I suggest Sweden/Norway. In the summertime Sweden is incredibly beautiful.

Because I'm Swedish, I'm going to convince you to go to Sweden. Here are some pictures of Sweden taken from /r/sverigeporr

There's no secret society of power-hungry Ohioans, yet Ohio still wields incredible influence over the government. Again, completely arbitrarily.

true,Asyx,native,native,"I think the Sekretär example is kind of special because lots of people (keep in mind that we talk about the entire pool of native speakers here. Not just the clever ones) don't know what a Sekretär/in does apart from writing letters and looking good. It's the stereotype of the Sekretärin that makes this a problem not the fact that the Sekretär is considered a high ranked position in a party or something. In fact, when I think about a Sekretär, I think about that furniture piece you have in your office.

So the problem here is in peoples mind not the language.

I also don't think that the shouting for a doctor is much of a problem. It's a sad fact that most professions are masculine. So in the heat of the moment, there might not be room for thought in thinking about the gender. Also, you'd yell for a ""Schwester"" instead of a ""Krankenpfleger"" as well and there is no way to bend ""Krankenschwester"" to anything masculine except ""Krankenbruder"" which would never be used because at this point, nobody thinks about a ""Sister of the sick"" but a person that takes care of sick people. It's starting to get weird when you think about male nurses because then, all of a sudden, you notice the gender based term.

It starts getting problematic when you have time to put some thought into it. Like, if you send out a letter to teachers at a school (could have taken students but there's already a gender neutral term), don't say ""Sehr geehrte Lehrer"" or ""Sehr geehrte LehrerInnen"". Take the time and write ""Sehr geehrte Lehrer, sehr geehrte Lehrerinnen"". Or do it the other way around if you're male.

Nuclear materials and weapons of mass destruction pose threats to the population, with few if any legitimate purposes unlike drugs or prostitution. Let me ask you this, has making it illegal to sell endangered animals eliminated the trade of endangered animals? What about drugs? Prostitution?

Making prostitution illegal simply drives the market underground. There has always been, and clearly still is, a demand for sex or companionship by hire. With the market legalized, regulations can be set in place to protect both the buyer and seller as the functions of state justice now apply. In an underground market, the only thing ensuring both respect of and payment for the product is the threat of violence since the police cannot be gone to. Introducing violence to the market to solve disputes imposes a number of additional costs to both buyer and seller. Blood is a big expense.

Now, if you want to ask me about personal liberty and what someone should be allowed to do with their body…should someone be able to sell themselves to be hunted? I guess so. I can't imagine this being common, though I have read of a case of this actually happening, where someone wished to be murdered (even eaten) and was obliged.

Should someone be allowed to sell all their organs? I guess so. The key aspect here is that they are making the decision on their own. If it is their true desire to sell all their organs and end up killing themselves, they aren't hurting anyone else, it is their body, so why not? They're fucking retarded though.

I don't like drawing lines. The world is not black and white, the world is nuanced. Your opinions should be as well.

PS: In regard to selling endangered animals, that *just* might be a solution.

""Je dois m'expliquer sur une question immense, d'autant que mes vues diffèrent probablement de celles de beaucoup d'entre vous: je veux parler de l'Algérie. Je n'hésite pas à dire que, sauf pour acquérir des frontières indépendantes, on ne me trouvera jamais, dans cette circonstance ni dans aucune autre, du côté des conquêtes.
Il m'est démontré, et j'ose dire scientifiquement démontré, que le système colonial est la plus funeste des illusions qui ait jamais égaré les peuples. Je n'en excepte pas le peuple anglais, malgré ce qu'il y a de spécieux dans le fameux argument: post hoc, ergo propter hoc.
__Savez-vous ce que vous coûte l'Algérie? Du tiers au deux cinquièmes de vos quatre contributions directes, centimes additionnels compris. Celui d'entre vous qui paye trois cents francs d'impôts, envoie chaque année cent francs se dissiper dans les nuages de l'Atlas et s'engloutir dans les sables du Sahara.__
On nous dit que c'est là un avance que nous recouvrerons, dans quelques siècles au centuple. Mais qui dit cela? Les riz-pain-sel qui exploitent notre argent. Tenez messieurs, en fait d'espèces, il n'y a qu'une chose qui serve: c'est que chacun veille sur sa bourse... et sur ceux à qui il en remet les cordons.
On nous dit encore: « Ces dépenses font vivre du monde. » Oui, des espions kabyles, des usuriers maures, des colons maltais et des cheicks arabes. Si on en creusait le canal des Grandes-Landes, le lit de l'Adour et le port de Bayonne, elles feraient vivre du monde aussi autour de nous, et de plus elles doteraient le pays d'immenses forces de production.
J'ai parlé d'argent; j'aurais dû d'abord parler des hommes. Tous les ans, dix mille de nos jeunes concitoyens, la fleur de notre population, vont chercher la mort sur cette plage dévorante, sans autre utilité jusqu'ici que d'élargir, à nos dépens, le cadre de l'administration qui ne demande pas mieux. À cela, on oppose le prétendu avantage de débarasser le pays de son trop-plein. Horrible prétexte, qui révolte tous les sentiments humains et n'a même pas le mérite de l'exactitude matérielle; car, à supposer que la population soit surabondante, lui enlever, avec chaque homme, deux ou trois fois le capital qui l'aurait fait vivre ici, ce n'est pas, il s'en faut, soulager ceux qui restent.
Il faut être juste. Malgré sa sympathie pour tout ce qui accroît ses dimensions, il paraît qu'à l'origine le pouvoir reculait devant ce gouffre de sang, d'iniquité et de misère. __La France l'a voulu; elle en portera longtemps la peine.__""",0,1402976830,null,0,false,0,ci9j5ml,t3_28c6jl,t1_ci9j5ml,t3_28c6jl,null,1434273099,6,false,france,t5_2qhjz,6

Ah ? Personnellement je prends le train tous les jours depuis des années, et il y a toujours au moins un controleur par train. Je n'ai constaté aucune disparition de guichets (certains se sont même ouverts récemment dans ma gare de départ), et les automates sont bien pratiques quand le guichet est fermé à 6h30 du matin et que je dois renouveler mon abonnement.
Quant au remplacement par des cars, ça ne se produit que si le train est supprimé pour travaux ou ... grêve !
Par contre, le prix des billets augmente, je suis d'accord.

&gt; ""Les cheminots ont donc cessé le travail car le projet de loi sur la réforme ferroviaire se discutera à l’Assemblée Nationale à partir du 17 juin.""

Je suis bête, donc j'aurais bien aimé un petit résumé de ladite réforme ferroviaire pour savoir si elle justifie ou non une grêve, et surtout pour mesurer le rapport avec les points discutés précédemment (disparition de gares, controleurs...). Là, tout ce que je comprends (je suis bête), c'est que les cheminots font grêve parce qu'un gouvernement démocratique respecte son calendrier parlementaire.
Et j'aurais bien aimé savoir aussi ce que la CGT propose comme alternative à ce débat.

&gt; ""Notre cible est bien ce « débat » parlementaire et non pas tes examens. Nous ne sommes pas responsables de ce calendrier imposé par le gouvernement.""

true,fringeel,null,null,"&gt; Moi j'attends toujours qu'on m'explique ce qu'on pensait que ça améliorerait d'interdire de travailler à une population démunie et nomade.

Elle n'était pas interdite, elle était soumise à autorisation de travail (comme les Croates aujourd'hui).

Ensuite, cela permet d'empêcher la pression à la baisse sur les salaires des non qualifiés et l'augmentation du chômage, entre autres.

Ces effets néfastes de l'immigration non qualifiée sont prouvés par [cette étude du CAE](http://www.cae-eco.fr/IMG/pdf/084.pdf). Il y a augmentation de l'offre à demande constante. Le salaire va baisser jusqu'au minimum légal, puis ça va créer du chômage (ou éventuellement descendre en dessous du minimum légal comme c'est maintenant le cas en Espagne. Il est illusoire de penser qu'on peut trouver autant de travail qu'il y a de gens, ça fait 40 ans qu'on a du chômage, ça ne va pas changer. Or sans travail pas d'intégration, que ce soit en une, deux, ou dix générations ça ne change rien.

Moi j'attends toujours que tu m'expliques ce que tu voulais leur proposer comme travail.

&gt;Assisté ou voleur, il reste quoi comme alternative ?

Rentrer dans leur pays. Encore une fois, on a 5 millions de chômeurs, tu voulais leur proposer quoi comme travail.

Il faut rappeler qu'avant tout, ils n'ont pas le droit de rester plus de trois mois en France. On ne permet pas de rester à des gens qui n'ont pas de quoi vivre, c'est la règle européenne. C'est pour ça qu'on impose des conditions de ressources et de logement aux immigrés, y compris européens. Extrait du [code de l'entrée et du séjour des étrangers](http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006334969&amp;idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006147746&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070158) :

Sauf si sa présence constitue une menace pour l'ordre public, tout citoyen de l'Union européenne, tout ressortissant d'un autre Etat partie à l'accord sur l'Espace économique européen ou de la Confédération suisse a le droit de séjourner en France pour une durée supérieure à trois mois s'il satisfait à l'une des conditions suivantes :

- 1° S'il exerce une activité professionnelle en France ;
- 2° **S'il dispose pour lui et pour les membres de sa famille tels que visés au 4° de ressources suffisantes afin de ne pas devenir une charge pour le système d'assistance sociale**, ainsi que d'une assurance maladie ;

Voilà, maintenant, l'État a décidé de ne pas appliquer la loi, les Roms ne respectent pas non plus la loi en majorité, les habitants de Seine-Saint-Denis ont également décidé de ne pas appliquer la loi.

La violence est extrêmement grave et je déplore cette situation et compatis avec le présumé voleur victime de cette violence. Mais pour moi le plus grave ici, c'est que l'État ne fasse pas appliquer la loi.

&gt;depuis le 1er janvier de cette année, cette connerie est enfin finie, ils ont accès légalement au marché du travail

Ils n'ont toujours pas le droit de rester plus de trois mois.

&gt;Ça a quand même créé une génération de perdue, qui a grandi déscolarisée en étant convaincue que leur avenir, c'est les petites combines.

Comment veux-tu qu'ils trouvent un boulot ? Ils ne parlent pas français, et on a 5 millions de chômeurs qu'il serait plus facile d'embaucher.

Les délinquants ne sont pas des victimes, il ne faut pas inverser les choses. Il y a une véritable culture du vol, de la prostitution et de la mendicité chez les Roms, avec une organisation mafieuse qui est ultraprésente et domine la majorité des sociétés Rom. Ils ont des pratiques sociales complètement incompatibles avec nos valeurs, par exemple ils organisent des [mariages forcés d'enfants](http://www.france24.com/fr/20121220-mariage-precoce-en-roumanie-une-tradition-controversee-qui-perdure-famille-roms). À un moment, il faut aussi reconnaître que leur mauvaise réputation n'est pas complètement sans raison.

I could just as easy say that the successful African Americans are overshadowed by the number of African American criminals (and many do). The problem with this reasoning is that you don't take into account social problems that African Americans face that, say, white Americans don't face to the same extent. The problems are originally the same with social exclusion and a caste-like system that sorts certain groups at the bottom.

The problem with Roma are similar to that of African Americans, but more severe, and that is reflected in a culture that focuses heavily on surviving by means that most others don't think are moral. The reason why this culture is prevalent in the first hand is that many many generations ago, this became one of few ways in which Romas could survive, so the one who became successful at stealing for instance, became successful within the bounds of what Romas had access to do.",0,1402990683,null,0,1403163669,0,ci9nezu,t3_289ng7,t1_ci9nezu,t1_ci986fd,null,1434275172,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

That's lashing out out of spite, what do they gain by that?

&gt;they're refocusing their exports to Central Asia and Asia and strengthening their ties with China.

They would have done that anyway. China has been *very* silent on the issue (as expected). Russia just had to hurry and give China a better deal than they would have to otherwise. If anything, Putin jumped the gun. Wrong timing has cost Russia billions that now stay in Chinese hands.

Besides, trading the European export market for the Central Asian export market? Is that *really* such a strategic masterstroke?

... You don't need to invade someone to paint them as a threat, if you're disregarding reality anyway.

&gt;and thus increase demand for strong (authoritarian) leadership, increased military spending and future use of coercion and intervention within Russia's sphere of influence.

Let's face it, they have been militarizing the conflict because that's the only area where their strength is (well, that and resource export). Diplomatically they've been totally marginalized in Eastern Europe. The EU doesn't even need to make hard promises to seem a more attractive partner to most Ukrainians.

You do realise that the (native) language has a large impact on their speakers' mind?

&gt; In fact, when I think about a Sekretär, I think about that furniture piece you have in your office.

You see, that's a problem. You associate a very different meaning to the male and female form. I could claim that your mind rejects the thought of a man doing ""lowly"" tasks so much that it evades to the meaning of furniture, but I won't, since it's not your single mind that does this, but the collective sprachgefühl hive mind, over generations of sociolinguistic diachronical mutation. But would you also do it if it was the same word for both/all human genders? If you hear ""secretary"" in English, you don't ask ""Is it the male sort making decisions or the female sort making coffee?"", or even ""Is it a peace of furniture or a woman?"".

Even if you talk about ""he"" and ""she"", you carry stereotypes. And I'm referring to

&gt; the entire pool of native speakers here. Not just the ""stupid"" ones.

Everybody has stereotypes. They are less common in languages where no ""he""/""she"" distinction is made. Look at Finland.

It's a differentiation. I don't consider most of the modern swedish ""left"" to be leftist. Certainly not the upper-middle class brats calling for ""revolution"", working people tend to hate their guts and would like nothing more to see those thugs in a jail cell.

&gt;Anyway, I don't really associate myself with the social democratic party because I consider myself a social democrat, which to me would mean V or Fi

So vaguely identifying as left but without all the important bits that actually help workers like union policies, workers rights and generally mixed-leftist economics in favor of minority social-liberal issues that affect sub-1% of the population?

That's all F! and V represents imo. F! arguably worse since they don't even have economic policies to speak of and actively attack workers for being the wrong sex or skin color due to recent ""only majorities can be racist"" academic feminist views. V are moving toward the middle under Sjöstedt and trying to rid themselves of their communist brand.

Well at least you're not a green. Those are the guys actively trying to harm working people through almost every policy they hold.

It's important to see what they actually do and think of the consequences rather than just accept politicians at their word, those are often just designed to sound as nice as possible until you put them under the lens.

&gt;Don't know much about Tage Erlander though, but he was before Palme wasn't he? What I know about Palme is mostly good and seems very leftist to me. Löntagarfonder, though a huge failure, is a very syndicalist concept isn't it?

Erlander was the last good Social Democrat leader we had yes. Palme was a huge mistake and there are many people on the left as well as on the right who hate the man. He was a globalist who was more interested in his international standing, so that he could hobnob with big men in other countries, rather than he was with swedens workers situation. Without him the Social Democrats would still be Social Democrat party rather than a bunch of gutless neoliberals. 

It's terrible that he was shot, if he wasn't martyred like that people would be remembering him for being the noble asshole that crushed the political representation of the workers in this country.

The only good thing I have to say about him is that he lost to Thorbjörn Fälldin who was a decent man with a good political stance back when the Centre actually stood for something.

&gt; I don't read it everyday, just articles linked every now and then. So I guess it's possible I only get the good articles. What incidents specifically are you referring to?

There's a whole bunch but just in the last week they've been caught out in immigration and racism-related debates. Lying about a fire station in Boden having acted racist against one of it's Arabic workers (turns out Boden's fire station has never had anyone more foreign work at it than it's current Belarusian who is quite happy about the situation, DN explained they ""should have anonymized it to another small northern town""), they're consistently lying about the OECD report on the economical benefits of immigration despite being called out on it weeks ago by several high-standing economists (Henreksson, Sanandaiji, etc) and they've recently started lying about Sandvikens report on the same with much the same people calling them out. 

But that's just in the last two-three weeks subject. They've been lying a ton since Wolodarski took over and started the warhawk business over Syria, Lybia, Russia, etc. It's classic American neocon shit and it's incredibly blatant if you remember DN prior to him.",0,1402993594,null,0,false,0,ci9nzyw,t3_287eza,t1_ci9nzyw,t1_ci994e3,null,1434275447,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Mit mehr vergleichbarem Wissen stellt sich immer wieder heraus, dass die eigene Frau eben doch nicht die Beste im Bett ist und die Mutter eben doch nicht die beste Köchin war; die eigene Firma vielleicht doch nicht die Beste ist.

Aufgeklärte Menschen wissen das einzuschätzen - es gibt auch aufgeklärte Mütter, aufgeklärte Ehefrauen und aufgeklärte Chefs.

Aufgeklärte Fußballfans finden sich hingegen selten Fahnen schwenkend und Parolen gröhlend in Fanblöcken wieder.

Und deshalb ist Fußball und der gesamte Kult, der ihn umgibt und für viele zu etwas Besonderem macht, auch reaktionär. 

Der Fußballfankult ist das Gegenteil von Aufklärung: Es werden Gesetze vorgegeben und es wird die selbstauflösende Gefolgschaft abverlangt, mit dem Versprechen, dass das einzelne Individuum ohne weiteres Zutun - nur durch den Konsum der Atmosphäre - für die Dauer der Gruppenzugehörigkeit über sich hinauswachsen wird.

Ins Allgemeine übertragen, gilt dies für jedes von dir genannte Beispiel.

true,kalleluuja,ESTO,Estonia,"&gt;Yeah, fuck the sanctity of human life.

This process of endless migrant pileup that you think is okay can eventually lead to some very dark chapters of history. By saving few right now will potentially lead to deaths of myriads. Look at the history, look what human does in times of desperation. When the excess of migrants start affecting the economy big time, the society will be ruthless. 
I think the only solution is to start turning them back and landing them back in Africa or Syria just judging by the looks(extremely politically incorrect I know). But if you think that this can go on without horrendous consequences you are naive. If you think I'm not worried about the lives of these migrants you are very wrong. I'm just trying to see bit further than just present. I'm very tired of that shortsighted higher moral ground stance, like the only way to be a good person is to keep the borders open. Look where Europe is heading. The extreme right is thriving. Just 5 years ago it was unthinkable. Get another crisis and how far will we go then?

true,Luk---,null,null,"L'état de droit, reste de la théorie. Vient ensuite la pratique. Un certain nombre de témoignages précédents sont à ce titre intéressants. 

L'état de droit s'applique avec une rigueur variable en fonction des coins. Il y a quelques mois, il y avait pas mal d'article sur la délinquance dans le musée du louvre et alentour, par des mineurs dépendant de réseaux mafieux. Pour bosser dans le quartier, j'en ai vu un ou deux, 14 ans, défoncés jusqu'aux yeux... Je ne serai pas étonné que le problème ait été maintenant jugulé. A l'inverse, j'avais un pote qui habitait à côté du métro chapelle et aucune pétition des habitants n'a réussi à faire éloigner durablement les groupes de toxico. La police les laissait se regrouper pendant quelques mois, les délogeait mais les groupes se reformaient plus loin ou le même jeu recommençait jusqu'à ce qu'il fasse le tour et reviennent au même endroit. 

Dès lors qu'il n'existe pas de solution à un problème de délinquance, on le déplace, on le circonscrit mais on ne le fait pas disparaître et ce sont en général les plus pauvres qui en héritent. Donc l'état de droit est dans la pratique à géométrie variable. 

A supposer que cet adolescent ait été effectivement un délinquant prit dans un réseau mafieux, puisqu'il semble avéré que c'était un récidiviste, l'immoralité de cette triste histoire est que le lynchage, a marché pour se débarrasser de l'ensemble du groupe. 

A supposer que les lyncheurs soient effectivement eux-mêmes des criminels la seconde immoralité de cette histoire est que pour les habitants honnêtes du coin, l'état de droit est une fable depuis bien longtemps.",0,1402994904,null,0,false,0,ci9o8ij,t3_28alqv,t1_ci9o8ij,t1_ci936jn,null,1434275559,3,false,france,t5_2qhjz,3
true,Marogian,UKGB,United Kingdom,"The interesting thing about this whole situation is the perceived democratic deficit in Europe is one of the issues which really puts British voters off- you vote in an election and this should have the effect of removing the previous Government if they get trounced and bringing in a new set of leaders. Instead you see months of horse-trading over various positions which is irritating enough- a load of invisible bureaucrats decide the result of the election- and then nothing really changes anyway.

Ironically this is exactly what we're seeing here, but its caused directly by the British position in rejecting what should be a straight-up result of the election if European democracy really functioned. This is because the vote was never sold as a vote for a European leader of any sort here.

The perceived disconnect to British minds is going to get far, far worse if Juncker gets in though - the ""big message"" from the election here, as sold by the media, is the rise of Eurosceptics. The expectation from the public would then be that if Europe was democratic this would result in European policy shifting slightly in a Eurosceptic (Less Europe) direction.

If the same old Europe continues, albeit with a slightly different unheard-of guy at the head of an institution no one understands, the perception will be that the election is completely pointless and it really is just a protest vote opportunity at best, and that Europe is ruled by an untouchable Brussels elite as the Eurosceptics always claim.

You could argue its the responsibility of the media to inform the public what the results of a European Election should actually be, but as it seems not even the leaders of the various members agree on this its not surprising that you can then end up with different members completely at loggerheads over something like this.",0,1402995016,null,0,false,0,ci9o94r,t3_28cm1a,t1_ci9o94r,t3_28cm1a,null,1434275567,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

true,canteloupy,ZBSuisse,Suisse,"On parle beaucoup des problèmes de justice ou de police vis à vis des Roms. De l'intégration, de l'intolérance, on dit qu'ils devraient rentrer chez eux, etc.

Mais mon impression personnelle c'est que ça va beaucoup plus profond. Quand on lit aussi des sources du point de vue Rom, on s'en rend compte.

Leur mode de vie, de leur propre aveu, c'est une sorte de rejet, de défiance. Qui augmente parce qu'en face on leur renvoie un rejet aussi. Y compris dans leurs pays d'origine, parce qu'ils ne vivent pas mieux en Roumanie ou en Hongrie en fait.

Ils y tiennent, à leur mode de vie, à leur communauté, à leur nomadisme. Pour un bon nombre, c'est impensable de vivre autrement qu'en nomade communautaire.

Et c'est notre souci en fait, autant des côtés qui prêchent une intégration totale et une éradication de la culture Rom en tant que telle, que des côtés qui cherchent simplement à faire en sorte que les enfants aillent à l'école et puissent faire des études ou trouver un job.

Et fondamentalement, je pense qu'il y a un fossé de compréhension. Parce que quand tu vois cette vie tu ne comprends pas pourquoi ils y tiennent. Pourquoi ne veulent-ils pas arrêter de vivre dans des taudis? ""Ne voient-ils pas que les égoûts, les poubelles, les buanderies c'est mieux que les caravanes?"" se demande-t-on. ""Pourquoi les enfants n'ont-ils pas l'ambition d'apprendre à l'école comment trouver un job, être stable, avoir un salaire?"".

On pense qu'ils penseront comme nous. Que tout ça c'est souhaitable. Mais franchement on dirait pas. On dirait que ça ne leur fait pas envie de changer. Parce que ça serait trop radical? Parce que ça leur enlèverait une part de leur identité? Parce qu'ils deviendraient ""l'autre""?

Et puis puisque de nos jours il n'y a plus de terrains qui appartiennent à personne, puisque les petits boulôts manuels n'existent quasiment plus, puisque les saltimbanques ne sont plus les seules sources de spectacles, etc. Puisque tout s'est professionalisé, se retrouve en grandes surfaces, finalement ces histoires c'est presque totalement obsolète. Les Jenisch en Suisse essaient aussi d'avoir ce mode de vie nomade, changer d'endroit tous les mois, vivre localement et temporairement, profiter de tout le territoire. Mais eux aussi voient bien que le monde s'est rétréci, que les opportunités s'en vont.

Bref, le changement, mais là il semblerait être un déchirement. Et on perpétue ce rejet de génération en génération, les enfants apprennent des parents ces attitudes et s'accrocheront à vie à cette identité et ce rejet.

Le plus gros problème des politiques à mon avis c'est lorsqu'elles partent du principe, erroné évidemment, que les être humains sont rationnels et vont vouloir agir dans leur propre intérêt. Si c'était le cas ça ferait longtemps que la religion aurait disparu. Le plus important pour un être humain c'est son entourage immédiat, les autres êtres humains sur lesquels il se sent pouvoir compter, et ce qu'on lui a inculqué dans son enfance qu'il tient pour sacré.

Bref, tout ça pour dire que je réfléchis beaucoup à ces problématiques et que je vois bien comment elles semblent inextricables. Mais c'est vécu comme une violence pour un être humain quand on lui dit que ce qu'il tient comme profondément part de son identité est mauvais pour lui, qu'on tente de le persuader de le laisser tomber, ou pire encore de le lui arracher. L'humain est irrationel et les politiques qui oublient de s'occuper d'êtres humains n'ont aucune chance de réussir.

Donc pour résoudre des questions de société, il faut faire en sorte que pour un individu lambda qui a enraciné en lui ces conceptions de ce que devrait être sa vie, il soit très clair qu'il y a un sentier qu'il peut emprunter qui à court terme et à long terme va lui apporter quelque chose de plus. Parce que se contenter de dire ""faut s'intégrer"", ou ""faut laisser tomber ce mode de vie"" c'est abstrait et agressif pour lui. Et il y en aura toujours une poignée qui pourra le faire, qui trouvera le courage de quitter la seule famille qu'il a, les liens du coeur et de son identité, il y en aura, mais ça sera jamais une part significative de la population.

Et il y a plein de comportements humains qui sont pareils. La sexualité, où évidemment l'abstinence fonctionne à merveille comme contraceptif mais n'est pas très réaliste comme politique de santé. La religion, où évidemment que manger du porc ou enlever un voile pourrait rendre la vie plus simple mais déchirerait toute la psyché de la personne à qui on forcerait la main. L'obésité, où on peut toujours dire ""il suffit de manger moins"" mais on ne peut pas consciemment contrôler tous ses instincts et sa vie sociale autour de ce principe à moins d'efforts quasi surhumains, etc.

La société change lentement, il faut guider les changements et être un peu malin pour voir des effets. Le contraire de ce gouvernement par déclaration de presse qu'on semble plébisciter dans la plupart des pays démocratiques ces jours...

Ça c'était pour venir en tant que travailleurs. Or ils étaient déjà là de manière illégale. Il n'y a aucune discrimination spécifique contre les Roms de ce point de vue là : si tu viens en France, que tu sois Allemand ou Luxembourgeois, tu dois avoir assez pour vivre et ne pas peser sur le système social français.

&gt;si ma mémoire est bonne) s'acquitter d'une petite taxe ou d'un petit frais administratif en plus

Source ?

&gt;On peut appeler ça être soumis à autorisation, j'appelle ça une interdiction avec exemption exceptionnelle.

Et tu as tort. J'ai 4 amis Roumains (dont deux ont été naturalisés il y a moins d'un an) qui pourront te dire que c'est faux. 

&gt;Leur pays où ils subissent discriminations et ostracisme.

Source ?

Si c'est vrai ce pays doit être tout simplement exclu de l'UE et ils ont le droit de demander l'asile. À savoir que [86% des demandes d'asile sont refusées](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droit_d'asile_en_France), malgré les nombreux recours possibles.

&gt;C'est vrai, on a jamais trouvé un Rom capable de parler Français...

Ceux qui arrivent en France ne parlent pas français. À moins que dans leur pays où ils sont ostracisés et discriminés on leur donne des cours de français ? En tout cas pour ceux dont il est question dans cette triste histoire, [ils ne parlent pas français](http://www.leparisien.fr/seine-saint-denis-93/jeune-rom-lynche-a-pierrefitte-le-temoignage-d-un-voisin-du-camp-17-06-2014-3929029.php).

Sinon tu ne réponds pas à la question : **comment veux-tu qu'ils trouvent un boulot ?** 

En tant qu'employeur, dans quels cas vas-tu préférer un Rom à un autre chômeur ou immigré ?

&gt;Dans ce cas où est le problème? Ils ne piqueront le travail de personne.

Tout d'abord j'ai déjà dit que s'ils entrent sur le marché du travail pour des emplois non qualifiés, ils pèsent à la baisse sur les salaires ou augmentent le chômage, la source est dans mon précédent commentaire.

Ensuite, le problème est d'une part qu'ils n'ont aucune chance d'intégration sans travail, d'autre part que sans ressources leur présence est illégale. On en revient donc à ta question : Assisté ou voleur, il reste quoi comme alternative ?

&gt;Je ne sais pas s'il y a quelque chose de spécial en réserve contre les Roms à cet égard, mais en France si tu as un boulot fixe, tu peux demander un titre de séjour pour rester.

Soit ils n'ont pas de boulot fixe, dans ce cas ils sont assistés ou pire. Soit ils ont un boulot fixe, et ils pèsent donc à la baisse sur les salaires et font augmenter le chômage.

&gt;Ils ont enfin une solution pour avoir un avenir en France.

Moi j'attends toujours que tu m'expliques ce que tu voulais leur proposer comme travail.

&gt;Je sais que ça choque les lyncheurs mais si: délinquant et victime, ce n'est pas incompatible.

En effet, mais ce n'est pas systématique. En particulier il n'y a pas de ""génération de perdue, qui a grandi déscolarisée en étant convaincue que leur avenir, c'est les petites combines"".

&gt;Ben c'est à dire que si travailler est illégal aussi, autant se tourner vers les choses illégales les plus rentables.

Travailler n'était pas illégal. Il fallait trouver un boulot, ce qui avec 5 millions de chômeurs a très peu de chances d'arriver. Mais ce n'était pas impossible, comme en témoignent les nombreux Roumains qui vivent en France (d'ailleurs il y a eu [660 naturalisations de Roumains](http://www.atlantico.fr/decryptage/14-naturalisations-supplementaires-en-2012-qui-sont-nouveaux-francais-mehdi-allal-maxime-tandonnet-maryse-tripier-828824.html/page/0/1) en 2012).

Enfin, c'est méconnaître la culture Rom de croire que l'insertion est leur objectif : ils ont un très fort attachement à leur communauté et sont extrêmement endogames. Ce qui est en dehors de leur communauté [est considéré comme impur](http://cultural.profiles.spirasi.ie/countries/roma.shtml).

There's a fine balance between giving the NHS a blank cheque and strangling it through lack of resources, but I think it's much easier to achieve given the heavy scrutiny under which it exists day to day. I'm not sure how much attention other countries health services garner from the people, but I think in our case it's an advantage, it honestly feels like we don't go a week without some kind of report on NHS performance and the merits/negatives surrounding any potential reforms.

The best way we can improve the NHS as individuals is to take more responsibility for our own health, the strains all the smokers, alcohol abusers, drug abusers and obese / unfit people will put on it in the next few decades is insane.

true,welfarecuban,null,null,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""wrong,"" because these are in large part normative rather than empirical issues.  Do you think a law ceases to exist if its implementation falls short of its lettering?  Sometimes, if the breaches are so frequent and egregious that it ceases to have any meaning.  But in most cases, it simply keeps chugging along.  

In other words, if you feel that Italy falls short of a UNCLOS article... so what?  Are you going to arrest Italy and incarcerate it?  Will opposition parties in Italy's parliament move for a no-confidence vote?  

Of course not.  The most anyone could possibly threaten would be expulsion from the treaty itself, which would never happen for many reasons, including vetoes by other nations which themselves would become subject to expulsion if the treaty were rigorously enforced.

My normative judgment is that:

-Italy has no real duty to patrol the seas beyond its territorial waters.  To the extent it does so, others should be quite thankful, because it isn't cheap.

-North African nations are not living up to their own obligations, but no one really cares about that, and that's quite understandable.  As mentioned above, a treaty is in many ways an advisory document, and if the advisories are not met... oh well.  

-Italy has quite a few problems of its own relating to economic issues, lack of jobs, integration of existing migrants, etc.  As does Western Europe at large.  This is an existential-level issue, as it pertains to the stability of the nation itself.  These concerns naturally supersede most others, and certainly supersede the interests of migrants sailing out of North Africa.

-Therefore, Italy's conduct with respect to the UNCLOS ought to be respectful but with national interests coming first.  If that results in what you might see as breaches of UNCLOS articles, I suppose you could complain about it online.  But in practical terms, nothing would change with respect to Italy's actual treaty ""status.""

The same goes for other such transnational conventions, including those relating to refugees.  

Now, in the interests of practicality, some treaties are more equal than others.  Italy would be a heap of trouble if it started disregarding (for example) the EU freedom of movement conventions.  That's because other signatories would get mad and demand punishment.

No such threat exists for UNCLOS, so, Italy is more or less free to mold the treaty to its own uses.

As for Libya and Tunisia, they are specifically receiving search and rescue training from European trainers:

I would argue that North African countries are living up to their obligations, and rather that they lack the means to do so effectively necessitating Rich country assistance. 

&gt;Italy has quite a few problems of its own relating to economic issues, lack of jobs, integration of existing migrants, etc. As does Western Europe at large. This is an existential-level issue, as it pertains to the stability of the nation itself. These concerns naturally supersede most others, and certainly supersede the interests of migrants sailing out of North Africa.

I don't know where you got the idea that I was suggesting that everyone that is rescued instantly gets to live in Italy. Those that are found to be genuine refugees should be given temporary (or permanent) protection visas, as required. Those that aren't should be deported. Regardless, I don't see how you find this to be such a big issue when countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, and literally dozens of other have disproportionally more refugees in their territory than the EU does.

Yes, and I maintain that claim, unless there are examples of a nation being ""punished"" in some fashion for not doing so.  You have a certain interpretation of what the law requires.  To which I'd ask - what are some examples of those requirements being ""instantiated""?  We know that there are enforced laws against speeding due to the existence of speeding tickets.  Where are the UNCLOS article 98 equivalents?  

This isn't even de jure vs. de facto... this is just de jure.  What are some de jure breaches of Art. 98 that have been punished as such?

Italy claims that the ""Mare Nostrum"" seaborne search and rescue operation has cost 9 million Euros per month, and I have no particular reason to doubt them.

&gt; Those that are found to be genuine refugees should be given temporary (or permanent) protection visas, as required.

Well that's the ""thin edge of the wedge,"" isn't it?  Here's an uncomfortable truth - a significant portion of the world's population lives under conditions that would ""legally"" give rise to refugee protections if they made it to a European nation and had their claims assessed fairly.

I put ""legally"" in quotes because obviously that law would fall immediately if such a thing even came close to happening.  That's the general nature of laws - they stand when can and they fall when they don't.

There are two separate but related arguments here.  One is that the UNCLOS document doesn't require as much as some believe.  Certainly not in practice.

The others is that - even if it did - that would be a marginal concern compared to far more practical concerns.

Mon discours c'est plus qu'il y aura toujours du racisme et il y en a toujours eu, à part faire avec que peut on faire face à quelque chose qui sera toujours présent quoi qu'on fasse ? Je ne dis pas qu'il faut tolérer le racisme, il faut toujours faire en sorte que cela reste quelque chose de marginal évidemment mais il faut aussi garder à l'esprit qu'on ne pourra jamais l'éradiquer et donc qu'il faudra ""faire avec"".

&gt;""toute façon, les racistes sont partout et c'est pire ailleurs""

C'est une évidence, certains pays font mieux que la France et la majorité des pays font pire. Évidemment qu'il faut tendre à prendre les premiers comme modèle mais moi ce qui me fatigue c'est quand on présente la France comme un pays atroce qui est naturellement raciste.

&gt;Quand un diplomate arabe se fait blacklister parce qu'il ne représente pas suffisamment la Francitude

Je suppose que tu fais allusion à M.Kédadouche ? Le moins qu'on puisse dire c'est qu'il n'a pas apporté la moindre preuve de ce qu'il avançait et que dans les faits sa carrière même semble démentir totalement ses accusations. Sauf info que je n'aurais pas on en est toujours à sa parole contre celle du Quai D'Orsay, j'éviterais donc de prendre parti personnellement.

&gt;quand une ministre est attaquée systématiquement parce qu'elle est noire et donc non légitime

Ou parce que tout ministre est soumis à la critique et qu'elle le savait très bien ? Les seuls critiques sur sa couleur de peau on les doit à Minute qui est un torche cul d'extrême droite. Oui elle a été beaucoup critiquée sur son travail de ministre, si tu ne peux pas l'accepter il faut pas accepter de ministère. 

&gt;on peut difficilement dire que ce sont des gens qui ne jouent pas le jeu. Ils sont toujours vu comme des aberrations ou des sous-citoyens.

Tellement sous-citoyens qu'ils finissent ministre de la République ou ambassadeur ? Alors même que Zaïr Kedadouche a été nommé à des postes pour lesquels certains rament 30 ans ? Je ne sais pas, pour moi ça ne colle pas.

&gt;La mentalité des ""intégrés"" est toujours celle de quelqu'un aux aguêts, qui ne sait jamais quand va tomber le couperet de la non-intégration et du rejet.

Oui, je suis sûr que ma supérieure hiérarchique, la personne chargée de la gestion du budget total de ma structure (autour de 4 millions par ans, c'est pas une responsabilité mineure) et le directeur du centre de formation qui y est attaché tremblent tous les jours parce qu'ils se sentent totalement rejetés et mis au placard en raison de leur couleur de peau, mais le moins qu'on puisse dire c'est qu'il le cachent extrêmement bien.

&gt;Si tu ne comprends pas ça, c'est dire à quel point tu te trompes sur tes ""connaissances"". 

J'ai vraiment de gros doutes personnellement, non pas que j'ai l'esprit fermé mais ton discours me rappelle vraiment le discours qu'SOS Racisme nous rabâche depuis 30 ans pour booster les scores électoraux du PS en expliquant lourdement aux français concernés que même s'ils ne s'en rendaient pas compte ils étaient très très malheureux en France et que SOS Racisme et le PS allaient les aider parce que c'était leur seule chance contre les vilains français qui étaient quasiment tous racistes.

It was never a money question.

Germany is densely populated and a evacuation zone of 30 km radius around any nuclear power plant would be a national disaster. 
We also see regular flooding of rivers here in Germany and this could affect a fission reactor.

All in all it boils down to the following question: Do we control this technology and is it worth the possible outcome of a disaster?

That was what I was meaning with fighting, since the issue was pretty controversial. The extension of running times was pressed through by Merkel's administration(s), but public opinion was with the opposition. At the same time Vattenfall, Eon, etc. were actually campaigning for an extension of running times up to 60 years and even the construction of new reactors. That was the time ""Ausstieg aus dem Ausstieg"" became a popular term.

Cold fusion is an idea of a variant of a nuclear fusion that was said to be able to produce clean energy via ""low energy nuclear reactions"".

""Riget"" (or The Kingdom) is the name used for the primary hospital in Denmark, known as Rigshospitalet. The tv series takes place on said hospital, where a lot of strange characters work and a lot of funny and weird super natural stuff occurs as well. 

In the clip we see the swedish neurosurgeon Stig Helmer, a recent appointee from Sweden, in the night, every night, standing on top of the roof of Riget, looking over the waters towards the now decommissioned nuclear plant Barsebäck in sweden, giving his monologue on his mother country, built in granite, standing there in the horizon - ending on pointing out his disgust of the filthy danes, exclaiming towards the sky: ""DANSK JÄVLA"" which translates into something like ""Damn Danes!""

The series is really good, check it out if you get the chance!

What is relevant is not just the fact of opposition to Juncker, but the nature of the opposition. The UK is not alone in opposing Juncker, but it is alone in the way it has gone about opposing him (Cameron writing opinion pieces in newspapers, mentioning that it might make a Brexit more likely and so forth).

Personally I think the UK is correct to adopt this approach. The UK is the only EU country where there is a real public debate about whether or not to leave the EU and a real prospect of a referendum on this in the not-too-distant future.

By apportioning an additional €120 million to Italy to help cover the cost of Mare Nostrum, for starters. That does not begin to cover the full costs of the rescue operation (the land-side centers and logistics, to name the biggest item), but it would help Italy keep its ships in the water.

true,halafever,null,null,"From what I could tell, and I might be wrong, Bavaria is one of the more expensive Bundeslaender, so things might not be so cheap. Don't worry though! As others have stated, Netto, Lidl, Aldi, Edeka - become familiar with them. It's definitely cheaper to stay home and cook than it is to go out and eat. A double cheeseburger meal from McDonalds, for example, cost me around 7 euros in Northrhine-Westphalia. I'm not sure if the price is the same in Bavaria. 

You can save money and eat more traditional German meals. They eat bread with butter, cold cuts, and cheese for breakfast and dinner. You can get freshly sliced deli meats, fresh baked bread and freshly cut cheese for really cheap. It's all so delicious. 
Travel, travel, travel. If you can, by a BahnCard 25 or BahnCard 50. They're a bit expensive, but worth it if you plan on traveling a lot. These cards give you a 25% or 50% discount on train tickets. There is a BahnCard 100, but it's like 4000 euros. If you have that kind of money and time to travel, I guess go for it. 

I might be a bit biased, seeing as how I lived in NRW for a year, but try to visit that area. As another person said, go to Berlin. I never get sick of that city. They have bar tours in Berlin that only cost like 12 or 15 euros. For one night, you tour five different bars, you get a free shot at each and a beer to start you off. 

Since you'll be in the area, try to make it down to Austria. The farther west you go, the prettier. I also lived in Vorarlberg, the western most state/province. Innsbruck and Arlberg in Tirol is also very beautiful. And of course, Vienna is a beautiful city as well!

If I remember correctly, they also have all day tickets for certain regions in different Bundeslaender. Try doing that one day if you have nothing to do. Get off the train in a random little city and just explore. I doubt you'll be disappointed. There's always a nice little Eiscafe or Kaffee und Kuchen place for you to relax and take it all in. 

It may sound a bit touristy, but don't miss Oktoberfest. I've been twice, and didn't regret either time. 

Most of all, enjoy every moment. Germany is a beautiful place with rich history.

If you have a few days a few weeks/months in the future, then [this](http://calendar.en.voyages-sncf.com/en/) page will help you to find cheap fares for train tickets. It's mostly for tickets within France, but some European cities where TGV goes are included. For destinations outside the TGV network, try the websites of the respective national railway companies, like [this one](http://www.bahn.de/i/view/DEU/en/index.shtml) for Germany. The earlier you book, the cheaper it will be.

As for food, just walk around and try what you find interesting. In Southern France, you'll find a lot of North African food. I like couscous with [merguez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merguez). But the first thing you should do is to scout the local bakeries, of which there will be plenty, for the best croissants, pain au chocolate etc.  
Btw. food, in France, payment in restaurants typically works like this: You ask for the bill, the waiter will bring it to you on a tablet with a bowl, you put some money onto it, s/he will take it to the register and return with your change, then you leave the tip in the bowl before you go.  
In other countries, this may work differently. In Germany you pay the waiter directly and say an amount while you hand over the money (e.g., the waiter says ""€8.70"", you hand over a €20 bill and say ""ten"" to indicate you want to round up to €10 for the tip). Tipping in restaurants is common and expected, but the US' typical 20% would be quite generous.

&gt;  Also, the last 6 days of my trip I will be going to other European countries, so any advice for that is welcome as well! (Want to go to possibly go to Italy, Germany, Spain, and Ireland.)

It might be technically possible to fly to all of those countries within six days, but you wouldn't really experience any of it. More realistically, you might manage one city in Northern Italy, and one in Southern Germany. Or two random ones if you fly from one to the other.

Since most of the Swedish left is Mp and S, I agree with you. I do think at the moment that V is a pretty good social democratic alternative, and Fi seems good as well IMO.

I highly doubt F! believes only majorities can be racist, but their politics are about structural problems and not individual. And in those cases it's correct, only majorities can be structurally discriminated against. And being an academic view gives it more validity in my eyes, not less. Thinking F! discriminates against white cis heterosexual males really shows you ought to read up on their politics IMO.

V represents green ideology and feminism as well as social democracy. But I like the green party as well, but a bit half-heartedly. The way I see it they're better than the reds to keep capitalism in check so it doesn't destroy the environment, but it's less effective to keep capitalism in check so it doesn't hurt people.

That stuff obviously carries an enormous price in blood.

However the actual deaths mostly happen to the very people involved in the mining or are extremely indirect. If you don't work in a coal mine, coal might still kill you, but it will be so indirect that it will be hard to connect cause and effect above a statistical level.

Chernobyl on the other hand was scary because of its sheer size and the very obvious connection between the accident and all the bad shit going.

Our justice system yet again fails to hold Jews to account for the crimes they commit. I'm not surprised people are taking matters into their own hands. 

**Maximillien** *121 points*
I'm not racist, but something must be done about the Jews, living in our cities in crime filled enclaves. If they don't want to obey our laws and culture, they shouldn't be surprised when people fight back.

**Hegelfan201** *100 points*
The jews have been in Europe for years now,and their culture has proven to be totally incompatible with our civilized way of life. Enough is enough, we've put up with them for too long.

**JJ** *54 points*
Que Liberals coming in here telling us the jews are all fine and we're racist for      mentioning their existence. The criminality and untrustworthy nature of the jews is well documented. They are not to be trusted because time and time again evidence has shown that they aren't. I'll 'tolerate' them, once they 'tolerate' our laws.

true,Rc72,EURO,European Union,"&gt; you can compare the UK with the Swedes, Dutch, Hungarians and whoever else opposes him

No, you can't. At most you can compare Cameron's position with that of Orban, who is the only other one having explicitly opposed Juncker as well. And Orban (like Reinfeldt in Sweden and Rutte in Holland) actually belongs to Juncker's own EPP, and gladly accepted the support of the EPP president during the campaign. He is *not* the most reliable of allies...

As for Reinfeldt and Rutte, they have been much more careful not to paint themselves into a corner like Cameron. Indeed, the only evidence we have for Rutte's opposition so far is the British press, duly briefed by Tory spin doctors. (I seriously doubt Rutte really opposes a fellow Benelux Christian Democrat like Juncker).

Cameron's negotiating tactics completely escape me. First he left the EPP (against the opposition of many old Tory MEPs), allegedly because of the EPP's ""federalist"" stance. Compare that with Orban, an outspoken nationalist, who instead continuously threatens the EPP with leaving, without ever following suit, but extracting many concessions and tolerance for his authoritarian policies in exchange.

Then Cameron has insisted that he wants to ""renegotiate"" the EU treaties with ""Brussels"", without apparently stopping to consider that it is with the other 27 member states that he will have to negotiate, and that each one of those can block that process (or put the ""renegotiated"" treaties to a referendum). He's also remained resolutely noncommittal about what exactly he wants to renegotiate.

And now he's picking a fight about a single person who, BTW, is nowhere near the single-minded federalist he's being said to be in the British media. In particular, during his tenure as PM of Luxembourg, Juncker was, for pretty obvious reasons, the single most reliable ally of Britain in its fight against tax harmonisation. And in this fight Cameron has managed to alienate the Germans, most small member states and almost the entire European Parliament, where Juncker is now getting support from his own center-right to the far-left of Tsipras, who ideologically is as far as one can be from Juncker.

Quite frankly, if Cameron wanted to spoil his own bid for ""EU reform"" and push the UK towards the exit, he wouldn't be doing otherwise. Which may not be accidental, since he appears to act mostly on the advice of Daniel Hannan, who is somewhat to the right of Genghis Khan in the political spectrum, and as much of an advocate of leaving the EU as Farage.

BTW, you can be certain that what Renzi (or most other Continental politicians) understands under ""EU reform"" and what is understood in Britain under that concept are two entirely different animals.",0,1403010180,null,0,false,0,ci9rd6s,t3_28cm1a,t1_ci9rd6s,t1_ci9q4ee,null,1434277035,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

That doesn't mean it's the main driving force. Threat of force does exist with other kinds of illegal workers too, in the construction industry, fruit picking or house personnel and other areas. Should we make those professions illegal too?

&gt;Legal booze, tobacco and drugs doesn't prevent people from getting this substances from illeagal market

I don't know a single person who has ever bought illegal beer. The only ones who moonshine at home do it for fun, not for profit. Cigarettes, on occasion, though usually that were just people who bought them in a country with cheaper prices. Cigarettes are also very light and convenient to take along in your suitcase. That's not the same for prostitution. You underestimate the convenience factor. People do these things for fun and instant gratification. If it's difficult enough, they won't.

&gt;in case of prostitution, black market probably should stay big in case of total legalization - because it's better not to pay taxes, if you can.

By that reasoning everything would happen on the black market to avoid taxation. It also works the other way around: paying social security contributions on your income is useful to build up social security rights, officializing it would allow sex workers to use it as evidence of solvability so they can get a mortgage more easily.

Fact is that you can crack down on the remaining illegal branches. Carrots and sticks - you'll chase customers to the legal suppliers.

&gt;And I can't imagine people going to court with cases against pimps and hookers.

They don't need to, but it becomes an option.

Firstly, they're retired. Is there any proof showing that they're acting on Russia's order ? No. Also, there are CIA officials helping out the Ukraine government. Following this logic, the United States invaded Ukraine.

Secondly, Ukraine's government showed it was capable of providing false evidence, which was [stupidly](http://consortiumnews.com/2014/04/23/nyt-retracts-russian-photo-scoop/) parroted  by Western media. [NYT retracted its previous statement](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/world/europe/scrutiny-over-photos-said-to-tie-russia-units-to-ukraine.html?ref=world&amp;_r=1) regarding Russia's alleged involvment in eastern Ukraine. 

Thirdly, the Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, Andrei Parubiy, [is also the co-founder of Ukraine's Social-National Party](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/02/12/who-are-the-protesters-in-ukraine/) (currently named Svoboda). 

Svoboda's other co-founder has been placed [fifth in a list of the top 10 anti-Semites and haters of Israel by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, based on his previous comments regarding Jews in Ukraine](http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Wiesenthal-ranks-top-10-anti-Semites-Israel-haters). Svoboda is also rabidly russophobic.

But let's get back to Parubiy, who's the author of some ludicrous statements [such as this one:](http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/205586.html)

*""If Putin is not stopped in Ukraine, no one knows where his tanks will be tomorrow. Everybody understands that this crisis is not between Ukraine and Russia, it is a global civilization crisis""*

To summarize, one should be extremely careful of statements coming from the Ukrainian government, still comprised of putschists.

&gt; There are also tapes released by the SBU that make clear the Kremlin's direct involvement in hostage taking and the ""Cossack"" state-sanctioned militia's role.

These tapes may show that weapons cross the borders. Russia's government being involved is not mentioned at all. Again, where is the proof ? If  armed members of a drug cartel in Juarez cross the US border, does this mean Mexico is involved ?

&gt; There were no reports of that

[Yes they were.](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/04/ukraines-offensive-falters-as-elite-units-defect-to-pro-russia-side/)

&gt; That's a strong argument. Couldn't be Russian because Rust, but Ukrainian? Sure!

Yes, it's a strong argument. If Russia wants to send in tanks, they're not gonna use outdated and decomissioned tanks.

&gt; Also, if you wanna see no restraint, check out Grozny after Putin's war on Chechen people.

Whataboutism.

Unlike germany there was more continuity, from that frankish aristocracy to todays france, of course there are etnic variations, people move, and like Prussia, history moved that aristocracy more to the west.

rare metals and hydrocarbons to make mirrors? is that something you actually worry about? OMG BUT MIRRORS ARE MADE USING HYDROCARBONS AND RARE METALS! because firstly let me put your mind at rest and say that reflecting light is a pretty common ability of most metals and even some minerals, you won't need to go finding any rare metals if you're planning on making a mirror.  
  
As for hydrocarbons, they do currently involve a lot of processes which are linked into a hydrocarbon dependent ecosystem within our industrial machine and yes that is bad, it's the same bad when nuclear power stations have walls and pipes, the same bad when your house has things or when you eat - it's a bad thing which is a reality of our current situation and the only way of changing that is to move away from oil based power generation and away from crude-derived plastics.  Switching to green energy generation methods is the solution not the problem here.  
  
You have a minor point with PV in that the silicone used in their creation is relatively rare, we probably only have enough to cover the earth with these panels a couple of thousand times over - however that's not really a problem any more because wafer based PV is fast being superseded by new lower cost or higher efficiency molecules, many of these biological and synthetic.  
  
also i don't really understand what you mean to imply by 'short life' and 'fairly inefficent' because the only sensible way of thinking about such a thing is in relation to how soon the energy used for creation is recouped and how much excess is created, minus of course maintenance and clean up - solar and wind are exceptionally cost/energy effective. 
  
The real fact of the matter is that neither solar or wind are likely to upset more than a few birds in the worst case situation where as in my lifetime two things that weren't the worst possible situation but actually can really be considered more 'lucky escapes' have left two large areas of the world uninhabitable, to call nuclear safe is absolutely absurd.

true,AvskyrAmerikanismer,null,null,"&gt;Since most of the Swedish left is Mp and S, I agree with you. I do think at the moment that V is a pretty good social democratic alternative, and Fi seems good as well IMO.

I think all four are fundamentally horrible. The old Left was patriotic with Folkhemmet as it's backbone, believed strongly in the right to work for everyone and placed a huge emphasis on work ethic once actually being granted work.  

To those four the word patriot might as well be a slur, right to work has become right to unnacountable welfare through citizens pay that actual workers will pay for and work ethic is exchange with liberal notions of the ""right"" to do what you ""feel"" like.

The Old Left wouldn't give the New ""Left"" the time of day.

&gt;And being an academic view gives it more validity in my eyes, not less. 

The academic (if you can still call gender studies that) views of third-wave feminists are full of rethorical tricks of conflating definitions, one second racism means their pet ""structural"" definition (that somehow exclude all non-western nations) and the other the dictionary one of actual racial inferiority/superiority beliefs. I find it to be highly intellectually disingenous and not at all comparable to the solidness of old marxist analytics much less contemporary liberal sociological analyses. 

The Academia of the social sciences had a huge hand in destroying the left for that matter as it was the '68-Leftists that formed on the campuses that co-opted the Worker's Left into the modern socioliberal internationalist ""Left"" under Palme.

&gt;Thinking F! discriminates against white cis heterosexual males really shows you ought to read up on their politics IMO.

F! does discriminate against white heterosexual males as is clear from listening to their representatives whine about the patriarchy of ""white offended men"". They're also laughable as feminists when they put a woman who sold her own daughter to another gypsy family at 16 years old and still defends it as their first representative in power.

&gt;V represents green ideology and feminism as well as social democracy.

V represents a few failed communists from Ohly's time and young people who have no unified ideological standpoint beyond being vaguely left-aligned. ""Green ideology"" in this case is merely throwing around a few nice words, much like the Greens, and getting upset when people ask for actual solutions. (which unfortunately is looking like nuclear for the perceivable future)

&gt;The way I see it they're better than the reds to keep capitalism in check so it doesn't destroy the environment

The Greens are the most environmental-hostile party in practice. All their policies have been tried in Germany and we know that in practice it means importing massive amounts of coal power from less environmentally friendly nations when the wind turbines fail to meet base power needs.

It's mentioned elsewhere ITT but it bares to repeat it. The Greens are 100% image that falls apart under scrutiny. I can't think of a single policy of theirs that isn't provably harmful. 

&gt;I'm curious about your thoughs about Löntagarfonder. 

A fundamentally bad idea as Kjell-Olof Feldt made clear well before it was enacted. Social Democracy is and always will be about class compromise and here we have Palme letting LO magnates stomp all over our employers in a huge breach of trust.

La pauvreté a baissé des années 1970 au milieu des années 1990. Elle est ensuite restée plutôt stable jusqu’au début des années 2000. Depuis 2002, le nombre de personnes pauvres au seuil de 50 % a augmenté de 1,1 million (+ 30 %) et le nombre au seuil de 60 % a progressé de 1,2 million (+ 16 %). Sur cette même période, les taux sont passés respectivement de 6,5 à 7,9 % et de 12,9 à 14,3 %.

Le mouvement de hausse est de plus en plus net. Il constitue un tournant dans l’histoire sociale de notre pays depuis les années 1960. La dégradation économique enregistrée depuis 2008 pèse tout particulièrement sur les moins favorisés.

Les données viennent probablement de [cette enquête de l'INSEE](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?reg_id=0&amp;ref_id=ip1464), dont voici un extrait :

Le seuil de pauvreté, qui correspond à 60 % du niveau de vie médian de la population, s’établit à 977 euros mensuels en 2011. **La pauvreté continue d’augmenter, mais plus modérément qu’en 2010. Elle concerne 8,7 millions de personnes, soit 14,3 % de la population, contre 14,0 % en 2010.**

La pauvreté s’accroît davantage parmi les chômeurs et les jeunes âgés de 18 à 29 ans. L’augmentation des durées de chômage et des conditions d’emplois moins favorables expliquent pour partie que ces populations soient plus affectées.

&gt;sur un autre critère.

Le critère de pauvreté est toujours le seuil à 60% du revenu médian. Une zone est dite pauvre si la moitié de la population y est pauvre.

Tu confonds ""nouveau"" et ""plus"". Tu confonds ""zone pauvre"" et tente de faire un amalgame entre la diminution du nombre des zones pauvres et la diminution de la pauvreté, qui sont deux choses distinctes.

Romania was booming in the pre-2009 period and there was no reason to believe that a global economic crisis would happen. Yes, I understand what you are saying. The growth rates get smaller as the country gets richer and also, the prices would rise. My point was that Romania had one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Certainly one of the fastest growing relatively developed economies of the world. Therefore, I can see why some people thought that it would catch up to it's western neighbors quite quickly at the time. And it's true, it would have. Maybe not exactly in 2020, maybe it would have been in 2025 or something like that. The point is, a presumption like that wasn't very far-fetched back then.

The problem is that when such actions are committed in a such manner, the justice system is ill-equipped to leave such people accountable for such actions. And it might be the Gypsies today and we deport them all tomorrow, yet the vulnerabilities in the justice system remain there for someone else to exploit them.

For god's sake don't advocate *solutions* centred around the Roma. I find it laughable that people advocate mass deportations, yet in reality this will lead to deportation volleyball and will actually worsen the situation since it will denigrate to a routine of *wack-a-mole*. Or a solution of ""Throw all the Roma in jail"". Yeah, because that will encourage those Roma who are actually trying to play by the system, yet instead have to pay the price of actions committed by others. 

In the end antagonising a set of people will do nothing to solve the current problems but probably add them up down the lines as soon as we have to pick up the pieces of escalated racism. Instead the solution lies in letting justice be flexible enough to adapt to such circumstances, as the potential methods are there.
