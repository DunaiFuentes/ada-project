... is not the way the German system is designed. Finishing your vocational training (Ausbildung zum staatlich geprüften XY) is just that; it does not qualify you to study at an university. [There are several ways to go from the Ausbildung](http://www.studis-online.de/StudInfo/studieren_ohne_abi.php) towards a regular university, but it will take at least two years of additional training.

&gt; or starting at a company is virtually not existent.

WTF? THe DGB (unions!) claim that 40% of Azubis are given a job in the company they had their Ausbildung at, 15% know that they won't get a job at their company and 45% haven't yet heard a definitive answer.

&gt; First of all ""vocational training"" is almost never accepted at uni

Strike the almost.

&gt;  secondly with the Bologna Process we are trying to move EVERY secondary(?) degree over to bachelor/master.

What does the name of the piece of paper have to do with anything and how does it impact the quality of vocational training?

&gt; For example cops are now „Bachelor of Arts in Police Leadership“ or „Bachelor of Arts - Polizeivollzugsdienst/Police Service“.

Bachelor of Arts is not the same thing as Bachelor of fine Arts (Kunst)

Trucks, Trains, Boots.

Combine that with the British Navy sealing German's ports virtually airtight. They denied the nazis access to oil, tungsten, rubber, copper, nickel, titanium, wheat, and every other raw material critical to making war. 

Germany couldn't make high penetration ammunition for their tanks. They had to compensate with extra high velocity guns, which limited their use for infantry support because of poor quality HE shells.

They were forced to transport their tanks everywhere by wood fired trains because fuel was too precious to use for driving tanks to the front. Coal was unavailable because it was being converted into synthetic fuel.

German tanks were severely overweight, limiting mobility, straining their underpowered drive trains, and their overly thick armor was still vulnerable to high explosive shells (spalling, look it up) because they were unable to make high quality steel alloys.

German tanks were also designed to use gasoline rather than diesel fuel, as it is easier to convert the former from coal into fuel via the Fischer–Tropsch process. Gas engines are more vulnerable to catch fire when hit than diesel.

The luftwaffe was often limited in the number of sorties it could make per day, because of the lack of high performance aircraft fuels. If the luftwaffe wanted to make a big week-long bombing push, that forced the tanks on another front to sit still and wait for synthetic oil production to catch up.

German troops were never fully mechanized, because of the lack of rubber for truck tires and gasoline/diesel to power them. They had to walk or ride trains.

German artillery was almost exclusively pulled by horses, which severely limited their mobility and capped the maximum size of guns that could be deployed en masse.

Warum dürfen alle anderen Länder das, nur wir nicht? Nationalismus is doch erstmal generell nichts schlechtes, oder interpetier ich den Begriff gerade falsch?

Ich bin Stolz das ich Deutscher bin, ich bin Stolz auf unsere ""rich history"", und ich bin auch Stolz darauf das wir die dunklen Zeiten unserer Geschichte überkommen haben. Ich bin Stolz darauf das wir einen hohen Lebensstandard haben. Ich bin Stolz darauf das wir Technisch, Wissenschaftlich und Wirtschaftlich relativ gut dastehen. Ich bin Stolz darauf das ""Made in Germany"" noch was heißt. Ich bin Stolz darauf das wir ein Kultureller Schmelztiegel sind. Ich bin Stolz darauf das wir es uns leisten können Leute aufnehmen zu können die in ihrem eigenen Land nicht mehr leben können. Ich bin Stolz darauf das andere Leute nach Deutschland kommen wollen, egal ob es Urlaub, Arbeiten oder Schutz ist. Ich bin Stolz darauf das wir so viele große Persönlichkeiten hervorgebracht haben. Ich bin Stolz darauf das wir in einem freien Land leben. Ich bin Stolz darauf das jeder eine gute Bildung bekommt. Ich werde Stolz darauf sein wenn ich mit dem Studium fertig bin und Schüler unterrichten kann, das ich der nächsten Generation etwas zurückgeben kann. 


Und wenn mir jetzt jemand sagen will: ""Was hast du denn für ein Recht Stolz auf all das zu sein, du hast dazu ja garnichts beigetragen!""

Dann Sag ich darauf einfach: ""Warum muss ich denn zu dem worauf ich Stolz bin was beigetragen haben? Wenn ich jemanden seh der etwas gutes tust bin ich auch Stolz auf diese Person, ich denk mir cooler Typ der hats drauf. Warum identifizieren sich dann so viele Leute als ""Fans"" von Fußball-Clubs. Die freuen sich doch auch wenn ihre Mannschaft gewinnt, und haben da jetzt nicht so viel beigetragen.""

Und guess what? Ich bin nichtmal ein ""richtiger"" Deutscher. Ich bin Siebenbürger-Sachse (""Rumänien-Deutscher""). Aber ich identifziere mich selbst als Deutscher, und deswegen bin ich Stolz auf Deutschland. Ich bin auch Stolz auf andere Nationen, aber ich bin Stolz auf Deutschland. 

Ich sage auch nicht das Deutschland, oder die Deutsche Regierung alles richtig macht. Und ich sage auch nicht das man Rückhaltlos hinter Deutschland stehen muss. Aber ich sage das man seinen Nationalstolz auch mal zeigen darf, gerade während der WM, wo wir als Nation gegen andere Nationen antreten um zu sehen wer der bessere Sportler ist. Und wenn die Deutsche Mannschaft gewinnt, werd ich auch Stolz auf die sein, obwohl mich Fußball nicht die Bohne interessiert.

Ich persönlich zeige meinen Stolz auf die Nation nicht dadurch das ich mir Fähnchen ans Auto hänge aber ich sehe definitiv den Appeal darin. 

Natürlich haben wir eine nicht ganz so gute Geschichte mit dem Nationalismus aber gerade deswegen sollten wir doch alle wissen das wir es nicht zu so was kommen werden lassen (gelesen als: wir werden verhindern das wir es zu sowas nochmal kommt).

true,Naurgul,null,null,"There are several factors at play here. 

PASOK, the ""mainstream social democratic"" party of Greece completely dissolved under the pressure of the bailout programme. The whys and hows this happened are complex and I won't go into the details, but with PASOK out of the picture, its voters needed to vote for something different. 

They needed  a party that 

* was leftist 
* not completely radical
* but still more radical than PASOK
* and would express their anger towards the bailout programme

Syriza was simply in the right place at the right time to fill that particular void. It was already an established thing, it had an air of progressiveness about it, it talked a lot about the woes of capitalism and the promise of a better system, was not isolationist or too stuck in old rhetoric. 

Another important factor that should not be overlooked is that leftist ideas are still held in high regard for a significant percentage of the population (historical reasons, won't go into details for this either). Therefore, when hit with the crisis, more people than in other countries were willing to go for something more radical on the left rather than on the right.

The initial surge happened in the first 2012 elections. Syriza got a good amount of votes there and then. From that point on, the Greek election system worked its magic. In case you're not aware, the Greek system gives a huge bonus to whatever party comes first in the elections, giving an incentive to people to vote for the biggest party they prefer instead of the party they prefer the most from all of them. In addition, coalition governments were rare by tradition and that also gives a similar incentive to people to vote for big parties instead of small ones. Therefore, all the leftist vote that opposes the bailout programmes has converged to Syriza. 

So, what did Syriza do right? Well, for one thing they managed to create an image of a radical left party that didn't seem completely out of tune with reality and obsolete. Then, they managed to stay above the 3% threshold during the ""good years"" so they had a presence in the parliament and were in everyone's radars. Third, they chose to oppose the bailout agreement. 

But again, it cannot be stressed enough that most of the factors that led to their rise were extremely circumstantial. 

&gt; Do you think that Greece had any particularities that other Southern European countries didn't have?

As I implied above, yes. Being a leftist (even beyond social democracy) in Greece (much to the horror of right wingers who call this ""the hegemony of the left"") is considered cool, rational, normal. It was not a subject of too much scorn. The reasons for this are complex, but suffice to say they had a lot to do with the fall of the military Junta in the 70s and the rise of PASOK in the 80s. 

&gt; -When did Tsipras start receiving attention from media? 

Not until after the first 2012 elections. The polls before the elections didn't even give a hint of what was to come. 

&gt; -Could PASOK avoid losing thousands of voters to Syriza?

That is difficult to know. If there was not a popular movement against PASOK during the first bailout years and if the media were as pro-bailout then as they are now, surely it could have maybe lived. But material conditions are material conditions, voters vote leftist parties for doing the opposite of what PASOK was doing and that had to cost them no matter what. (On the other hand, a right-wing government is not voted for its social policies, it is judged with different criteria, which is why a right-wing party that is governing a country that is cutting social welfare will not lose as many votes. )

&gt;  Could have KKE benefited from those voters?

Nah, KKE's response basically was ""the material conditions are coming and the people will soon take over in a peaceful revolution"". It didn't really seem to *want* to become government. It also is perceived (rightly if I may add) as too stuck in old rhetoric and their old ways and out of tune with reality.

That was over 90% of their entire train/truck logistical system. The merchant fleet kept England from starving to death which allowed England to keep the Royal Navy at sea and maintaining its iron grip on Germany's access to sea trade.

Winning the Battle of Britain and Battle of the Atlantic were every bit as critical to the war as Moscow or Kursk.

Germany couldn't get oil, rubber, titanium, copper, nickel, tungsten, wheat, and any number of other raw resources highly critical to fighting an effective war. You know why Russian tanks and troops could drive all day without fear of being attacked from the air? The blockade. Planes can't fly sorties without gas. You know why Russian tanks could maneuver at will around static German tank emplacements? No fuel for the tanks because of the blockade. You know what triggered the Germans getting themselves trapped in Stalingrad? The blockade. They were so desperate for access to oil that taking Stalingrad and the Caucasus oil fields because #1 priority for German military planners. Why was the armor on Russian tanks so good? The germans couldn't afford to use tungsten in their armor piercing shells, severely reducing their effectiveness. Why did German tanks break down all the time and why were Russian tanks able to blast through their armor with ease? They were over-armored and thus overweight to compensate for their low quality, brittle steel alloys. That thick, brittle steel was fairly effective against AP shells, but very vulnerable to high explosive, a russian favorite. The armor of german tanks would crack and spall, killing the crew inside, when hit with a 122mm HE shell. There's a million other factors that when added up, become a war winning contribution. 

Russia had the big, sexy numbers. Millions of soldiers, thousands of tanks in single battles, but it would have fallen apart without the US and the UK/other allies.",0,1402428873,null,0,1402429492,0,ci44vz5,t3_27s2ch,t1_ci44vz5,t1_ci3z3z5,null,1434179903,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Pensiamo magari ad una comunicazione mirata alle community online che potrebbero davvero apprezzare /r/italy. Pensiamo di dover convicere loro a venirsi a divertire qui con noi.

Poi giù a manetta ci teniamo pronti con:

* jpg in diversi formati da far circolare
* grafica coordinata della pagina: header, banner e css 
* pagina wiki o stickied post per dare il benvenuto ai nuovi iscritti e spiegare sia la storia del contest, sia un po' di reddiquette nostrana
* prendiamo contatti con qualcuno che ha un blog letto un po',insisto sul fatto che gianluca neri si divertirà a parlarne e a noi non ci da mica fastidio se, dato che è di strada, ricorderà ai suoi lettori che esiste quarantadue.it
* il messaggio e lo slogan della comunicazione deve avere qualcosa che non stuzzica tanto l'attenzione dei potenziali nuovi subscriber, quanto di chi scrive su blog molto letti dai potenziali nuovi subscriber, penso a wired, vice,ecc... Magari potrebbe persino non essere il contest il focus del messaggio, dovrebbe proprio essere qualcos'altro. non so cosa, ma si deve parlare di quello.

Insomma: grafica pronta, messaggio pronto e qualche cassa di risonanza pronta.

 - Job market is horrible. Private lessons in english could give you a little income, but as mentioned by another person, you need to know italian. Plus english isn't one of the critical subjects at school, math is more the trend.

 - Law school is another abused graduation in Italy. We have a LOT of people graduating in law. I don't know if they have it easy finding a job, I think the lawyer life starts in a pretty hard way. Plus consider that such graduation would be useful only in the country you graduate in probably.

Consider the English sentence: ""There are days on which I wish I were my dog."" Colloquially, we would shorten it to something like ""There are days I wish I were my dog"" (or, even more colloquially, especially if you're British, ""There are days I wish I was my dog"").

The basic meaning of ""da"" is ""there""; but that makes sense when you consider that we often talk of time in terms of space. The days leading up to now are *behind* us; we look *forward* to the future; we plan *ahead* and look *back*.

The phrase ""an denen"" refers, of course, to ""an den Tagen"". And like many prepositions, ""an"" can be used for time or places. We can say ""an der Schule"", ""am Bahnhof"", ""an der Kasse"", and we can always replace those phrases with ""da"": ""Es war an dem Strand. Da haben wir uns zum ersten Mal geküsst.""

If we can replace ""an dem Strand"" with ""da"", why shouldn't we replace ""am Tag"" with ""da""? ""Es war an dem Tag. Da haben wir uns zum ersten Mal geküsst.""

Sure, the communists were better organized and more experienced in underground action than other political movements. Their armed wing, the *Franc-tireur partisans* (FTP) were the single biggest French resistance group. 

Taking wikipedia's numbers, the FTP was roughly 100,000 men strong in 1944. The biggest non-communist partisan group, the *Organisation civile et militaire*, had some 45,000 members. There were six more partisan organisations in the National Council of the Resistance - all of them smaller, but certainly a few ten thousand more mre in total. 

Then there were another tens of thousands of unorganized [*maquisards*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maquis_%28World_War_II%29), and only few of them were communists. 

The communists were the biggest group in the Réstitance, but certainly nowhere near 90%.

Lasciamo che siano gli USA a specializzarsi nell'informatica (infatti Internet, google, fb, la Apple sono già ammerregani), e noi facciamo quello che solo noi possiamo fare.

Potremmo campare tranquillamente sfruttando ciò che abbiamo già, cioè l'immensa ricchezza storica-artistica-culturale che molti altri paesi del mondo sognano e ci invidiano e pagano fior di quattrini per vedere.

Mica sto dicendo di ignorare i computer, ma che è uno spreco assurdo ignorare il nostro patrimonio.

Rest of Europe (that's not now USSR): Lots of rebuilding and generally a mess. People displaced everywhere. But actually recovered quite well.

true,0xKaishakunin,,ˈmaχdəbʊʁç,"I do Research about our TVET System in German, especially in comparison to other systems. I Wrote an article about Racial BIAS in the US SAT in comparison to the German Abitur last year, which was quite interesting, so I am also somewhat familiar with the US training system. And I watched all episodes of Community ;-) 

However, it's already late, so I'll just give short answers. Feel free to PM me. 

&gt; Sadly I'm not actually in Germany so that limits my reporting quite a bit (that's why I'm posting on reddit).

Which information do you need? 

If you need statistics, check the annual Berufsbildungsbericht and the Datenreport: http://datenreport.bibb.de/

A huge Problem for foreigners: They don't understand that you do not have a Uni degree in Germany for many career paths. Our Uni degrees have one of the highest standards in the world and are intended for scientific training, not vocational. 


&gt; is German vocational training successful at producing skilled and highly productive workers? 

Definitely. Since all stakeholders (Unions, Politicians, TVET Teachers and Researchers, Trainees) have to work together, consensus is required. This leads to a well balanced system. 

The curriculum for the theoretical part taught in TVET school is the same for every TVET school in Germany. So for example every Car Mechatronic has the same training in school, no matter if they work for a small Garage near Dresden, for VW in Wolfsburg or Zuffenhausen. Therefor they can swap their Jobs pretty easily. Another advantage, especially for hi tech jobs, is the broad theoretical background taught in schools. Trainees are not only trained in company on the job, but get a very broad training in school. 

Not every company understands this, especially craftsmen often complain about this, but the trainee does benefit from it. 

Another thing is the in company leadership, were German workers have much more freedom than US workers, because they are well trained. 
That was also one of the reasons Wal Mart failed in Germany. A sales clerk in Germany can be trained for 2 or 3 years. 
When she is trained for 3 years she will learn management stuff to manage her own market (accounting, planning, marketing etc.), so an incompetent manager cannot bullshit the sales clerks so easily. 
BTW sales clerk is the most popular training among females. 

They are also better united in the Unions, allowing them to weigh in their political power better.

&gt; Do you think vocational training actually is responsible for lower youth unemployment? 

Definitely. 

Just check the youth unemployment across Europe. Those countries with a German style training system (DE, AT, CH, kind of DK, NL) have pretty low unemployment rates among the youth. 
The German system was also designed to battle youth unemployment. 

http://www.avenir-suisse.ch/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/relative_arbeitslosigkeit_OECD_600.jpg

&gt; Could something like this system be replicated in the USA or other countries, or can this system only exist with the unique characteristics of German capitalism?

One of the Problems is the acceptance of not having a College degree. As long as parents and society expect you to get a college degree, any German style TVET system will fail. 

There has been multiple attempts by different countries (eg. South Korea in the 1960s) to adapt the German system and they mostly failed due to the not acceptance of TVET degrees. 

I worked in a project at my Uni were we train TVET teachers form SE Asia. Some countries there are interested in the system and trying to adopt it. 
I had to train some Chinese TVET teachers in didactical methods and the biggest problem there is the mindset of IMO stupid theoretical learning

Anyway, the German system won't work in the US due to the lack of respect for TVET degrees, the ""must go to college"" mindset, the lack of Career Paths for people coming from the TVET system, the unwillingness of employers to invest in the training system (see the VW unions at chattanooga debate. Everyone here was baffled that politicians are against unions ;-) and much more factors. But this are the main problems. 

BTW: Have a look at Unevoc: http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=fwd2UNEVOC+Network+-+History+and+Overview

If you want more Info, PM me here. I can set you up with further contacts of TVET Researchers. 


&gt; What's the impact of having kids be put on different ""tracks"" depending on their aptitude in school?

This is a *very* complex topic and also a very emotional debate. 

IMO having different tracks according to the skills/IQ of pupils is necessary. Even educational systems that don't have different tracks sort their pupils in a way or another, be it AP courses and SATs or extra curricular activities.

One thing that got better in the past 10 years is the permeability and formal acceptance of TVET degrees at Universitäten and Fachhochschulen. The OECD often criticized this, but they usually don't understand how the TVET system here works. 

Another important difference when comparing DE to the US is the social function of formal qualification. A Abitur (allgemeine Hochschulzugangsberechtigung) qualifies you to study everything at every Universität or Fachhochschule in DE. But the decision if you get your Abitur is made by your grades in school and your school teachers. In the US, the decision is made by the Uni, hence the reason SAT, ACT, mSAT etc.pp. exist in the US but not in DE. 
The same applies to jobs in the industry. Since the TVET degrees are standardized, there is not much need to set up Assessment Centers for plumbers or brick layers. You also dont' have that much scammers or idiots among craftsmen, since know scammer does 9 years of work and training to get a Meister.

true,0xKaishakunin,,ˈmaχdəbʊʁç,"BTW: I wrote an explanation about the German TVET system some month ago, but I cannot remember where, probably a Mailing List. However, here is the posting for further information: 

The TVET system in Germany is basically the same system since the 12th century. Back in the high middle ages in Europe guilds set up rules for training and education and forced their members to stick to the rules. The guilds (nowadays organized as chambers) are still there and set up the curricula and final examinations. So after the training, every trainee is examined by an independent examiner. 


The German government created a law that allows companies only to train trainees in officially recognized training programmes. The programmes themselves are created and regularly updated by a round table. Every curriculum for the vocational schools actually is a law and every teacher there is required to teach that curriculum. 


Some years ago, the most popular trainee programme, the motorcar mechanic was abolished and a new programme, motorcar mechatronic, was created. The new curriculum also includes more electrical engineering and computer science to deal with modern cars and their computer systems. So nowadays you can only be trained as a motorcar mechatronic and no longer as a mechanic. 


Now imagine that Alice and Bob are starting their training as car mechatronic. Alice lives in Wolfsburg and starts her training in the developmental department of Volkswagen, Bob starts in a small car dealership with 5 employees in a small village near Hamburg. Both spend 3 days in their company and 2 days per week in the local TVET school. 


Both TVET schools will teach the same curriculum, as every other TVET school in Germany will do. They are teaching general subjects (Math, German, English, social/political studies) and theoretical and practical subjects regarding to the training programmes (testing and repairing electrical systems, brakes, networked devices etc.).  Both will all in all spend 1020 hours over 3.5 years in the TVET school and the rest in the training company. In the company, they are trained on the job by senior co-workers (*Meister*, master craftsmen who have to take classes on didactics and training themselves). So the on the job part of Alice and Bob will differ. Alice will work in several departments of Volkswagen, from prototyping to research to an assembly line. Howevers, she might never have contact to an customer buying a VW. Bob on the other hand, might never see a motor research lab, but he will deal a lot with customers, since he is working in a car dealership. But due to the theoretical and practical skills and background they got in TVET school, both can switch their positions and only would require very little on the job training. Therefor, typical trainee programmes as in the US are not that common in Germany. Another advantage is the huge available workforce of skilled labour. Every car mechatronic in Germany went through the same curriculum in TVET school and can work in every car mechatronic job in Germany. Be it a car dealership or Volkswagen, Porsche, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Siemens, Bosch, Putzmeister whatever. This gives the German industry the flexibility to create new products, to react to higher demand and to gain technical leadership in smaller industrial fields like Putzmeister, Stihl, Kugelfischer and so on. In fact, only 20% of all trainees are trained by huge companies like Adidas, Siemens or BMW. 80% are trained by smaller companies. Even very small family owned companies can train skilled labour, because the TVET school will take care of the theoretical and scientific background of the training. 



The companies only have to pay the wages for their trainees (Alice and Bob would make 500€ after deductions per month in the 1st year and ca 2200 € per month after deductions per month as skilled labour). TVET schools and teachers are paid by the local county (local administrative district), which of course uses tax money for it. TVET teachers are required to hold a Masters degree in Education and have to do a 2 years training period in a TVET school. 



Another thing that differs from most other countries are the open career paths for skilled labour. Most of the job positions in Germany do not require a Bachelors degree. Most working groups in the industry are lead by master craftsmen (*Meister* or *Industriemeister*) and not going to university but doing a training is the norm. There are a lot of smaller companies that don't have a single employee who went to a university. 



The advanteges of this training on the job and in a TVET school is the broad training (or education, the German language has more concepts of training and education than the English, and it is almost impossible to translate these concepts). Trainees are trained on the job, so Alice and Bob know how to dismantle motor and drive, because they have done it several times under the supervision of a senior master craftsman. And in the school they learned all the theoretical concepts and physical backgrounds about motors and drives. Thus they are able to repair a motor in a standard VW Golf. But they could also work on a Mercedes-Benz Actros 40 tonne truck. Or a combine harvester. Or a Leopard battle tank. 



Someone who only had theoretical training is not able to repair a motor without additional practical training. Someone who only had pracitcal on the job training is usually not able to transfer his skills from a Golf to a combine harvester. But combining both enables the trainees to learn this. 





So, the dual system of TVET has a long tradition in Germany. The Government does not give money directly to companies, but pays for TVET schools and teachers. It also does some regulations regarding curricula, training standards and of course the training of the trainers. It costs some money, but it is the fundamental basis for the industry in Germany. And we only have about 10% of jobless youth. Most of them are not able to be trained, because they dropped out of school, have no discipline at all or have problems with the German language. So the composition of the lost generation in Germany differs from that in other countries.

So in both cases - the war in Europe and the Pacific - it was Russia's involvement that made the biggest overall impact. Of course, nothing is that cut &amp; dried.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. What I said was that the ECR refused to post a candidate for the presidency. So if you didn't have a chance to vote for one, that wasn't Europe's fault; it was Cameron's fault.

&gt; And yes - people cast their votes for their national parties; that does not necessarily mean they were also endorsing those candidates' Spitzenkandidaten. When you look at the number of people who watched the debate between them (derisory), and the number who could name a single one (less than one in ten), it's a joke to claim a democratic mandate.

I don't see how that's relevant, though. They voted for a party; they gave that party their vote because the voter believed that party represented him/her the best. The party, in turn, selects the person that the party belies is the best leader. 

The group of parties we call the EPP got a plurality of voters to vote for them. So these parties select Juncker as their candidate for President. You're right that Juncker's campaign is no ""Yes We Can"", but there is nobody in the entire continent more legitimate than Juncker for the position of the European Commission presidency.

Et que dire du Vlaams Belang? Bon, à part leurs sympathiques commentaires sur les ""franskillons"" et leur slogan ""België Barst"" (""Crève, Belgique""), on peut prendre note de leurs solides liens avec le ""Sint-Maartensfonds"", la désormais dissoute association d'anciens combattants flamands des Waffen SS.

Yugoslavia is a particularly striking example: there's quite a bit of Tito nostalgia. Why? One reason is the relative lack of ethnic strife under his regime, compared to the civil wars that followed the breakup. Another, related, reason is that Yugoslavia was objectively richer back then, in terms of material wealth. The 1978-88 period is still the peak period of per-capita GDP for the region, not yet matched or exceeded by the post-Yugoslav successor states (current per-capita GDP for the region as a whole is about 10-15% lower, adjusted for inflation, than it was when Tito died in 1980).",0,1402436543,null,0,false,0,ci48v88,t3_27smrx,t1_ci48v88,t1_ci45wuo,null,1434181780,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

All of which the US made up for with the Marshall plan, and then some. It turned the US into the economic superpower it is today. Before (and during) WW1 and pre-WW2 the US was a pretty insignificant country and it wasn't doing so well either.

&gt;WWII directly led us to a confrontation with the USSR

There would have been a confrontation with the USSR anyway. Capitalism vs. communism.

&gt;Decades of having thousands of nuclear warheads pointed at me.

That has nothing to do with WW2 but more with the fight against communism the United States started on their own. The US was afraid Europe would follow the USSR instead of them. They were afraid they wouldn't be the baddest bully on the playground anymore.

Also nothing to do with WW2 but with communism vs. capitalism.

It's called being ALLIES. It's like having a friend at school but times a million.

Without alliances the world would be different, for starters there would be no United States of America.

The US has always had connections with Europe, probably because you all came from here. It will never change, deal with it.

Zur Erklärung: Du schreibst, daß Unterschiede interessant und das Betrachten von derselben wichtig ist. Dem widerspreche ich nicht, ich sehe nur den Zusammenhang nicht, warum man sich deshalb als Deutscher/Iraner/Franzose/Portugiese etc. definieren soll. 

Wenn dein indischer Freund z.B. nicht mit Besteck ißt, dann ist das bestimmt interessant, es sagt nur eben gar nichts über Indien oder die Inder aus. Es ist zunächst lediglich eine Betrachtung zu einem einzigen Inder, weil es glücklicherweise eben nicht so einfach möglich ist, ganze Menschengruppen anhand einzelner, oft marginaler Merkmale zu klassifizieren. Dabei spielt es auch keine Rolle, ob die Unterschiede positiv oder negativ wahrgenommen werden.

Was hat das mit der ganzen Definitionssache, dem Nationalismus und der Identifikation zu tun? Ganz einfach. Wenn die Identifikation mit staatlichen Symbolen nur eine blanke Begrifflichkeit wären, beispielsweise um lediglich auszudrücken ""Der kommt da und da her"", dann würde ich gar nichts sagen.

More proof that 'radical' doesn't necessarily mean hard left (ie anti-capitalist)?

France's [Radical Left Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Party_of_the_Left) is a social liberal party, like ALDE.

Moreover, there's a [Radical Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Party_%28France%29) in France, that's also liberal, and they sit with EPP.

Denmark's [The Radical Left](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Social_Liberal_Party)? Social liberal as well.

How is Syriza radical left, *nowadays*? They are pro-NATO, pro-EU, pro-Euro, and pro-market economy. They held a joint press conference with the Industrialists Association (ΣΕΒ) just last week. Does it really sound like radical leftism to you? 

Yes, 10 years ago Syriza was left-wing. It was between PASOK and KKE. Now they are PASOK, and PASOK is dead. 

If you are looking for radical left parties in Greece, you are looking for ANTARSYA, the anti-capitalist front. They get like, 0.5% of the vote. 

tl;dr: Syriza wouldn't actually catch up if they were truly radical, because people do not look for radical solutions, but rather for sweet words that comfort them. If they wanted radical solutions, they'd vote for KKE or ANTARSYA, or go ""fuck the state"". They didn't. KKE is actually losing ground. They used to have a solid 8% back in the days. Now it's 4%?

true,redditbot56,null,null," A large influx of immigrants has given the UK the fastest-rising percentage of ethnic minority and foreign-born residents of any Western nation.

The country is likely to overtake America as the Western world’s greatest ethnic and cultural melting pot if current migration trends continue.

By 2040, the number of foreign-born and non-white residents will double, meaning they will account for a third of the population. By 2066 they will outnumber white Britons.

Prof Coleman, a professor of demography, drew his findings from research on international population forecasts carried out for the Migration Observatory.

He said: “On current trends European populations will become more ethnically diverse, with the possibility that today’s majority ethnic groups will no longer comprise a numerical majority.”

We can already see the consequence of this: 

The Cockney accent will disappear from London's streets within 30 years, according to new research.

A study by Paul Kerswill, Professor of Sociolinguistics at Lancaster University shows the Cockney accent will move further east.

In London, Cockney will be replaced by Multicultural London English - a mixture of Cockney, Bangladeshi and West Indian accents - the study shows.

""It will be gone within 30 years,"" says Prof Kerswill.

Then what did they have? A duty to fight, even if that likely means defeat? That doesn't hold in a World War. Its an atrocious idea.

&gt; They should have kept up a naval war/blockade of Germany, certainly no one is expecting them to get all the way to Warsaw as the situation stood in 1939.

&gt; It's really more the principle of the matter.

What you seem to identify here is that it was not possible for Britain and France to liberate Poland in 1939. Any attempt to do so would therefore have been exceptionally costly and dramatically changed the outcome of the war (and not in a good way for the Allies, or indeed Poland).

I appreciate the idea of principle, but in a context such as a World War, it really does not apply. Losing but doing ""the right thing"" is not a consideration or a bonus. The Allies were unready for war in 1939, hence the lack of action.

&gt; it's insulting that they didn't try to fight when they had a good opportunity and knew they would have to anyway at some point.

I completely disagree. The idea that they should just fight now because ""they would have to at some point"" is very short sighted. Again, fighting and losing because its unfair to Poland is entirely wrong. Anything that doesn't involve winning was the wrong move.

true,MerlinsBeard,UNSA,United States of America,"In a way, it's like this:

The world is represented by runners. In 1900 all of the nations are properly kitted and in a somewhat tight formation but the US is already pulling ahead. Germany/UK/France/USSR are quite close to one another and it stays this way just about up to 1939. The US is ahead but not by a significant version (estimates are around 10% higher than Germany/USSR and ~15% higher than UK). 

WW2 comes by and effectively all runners lose their shoes in 1945. The US throws thumbtacks down and then keeps pacing out. One thing to note is the US economy took 10 years to recover to 1929 levels (Great Depression) but another 10 years after 1940 to effectively *triple itself*. It's hard to wrap one's head around the inordinate industrial capacity of the US and how insane the resource pool it would require to manufacture the goods it did.

Here's something: [In Dec 1941 the US Navy had 790 ships. In August of '45 it had almost 6,800.](http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org9-4.htm#1945) That's unreal. 225 major vessels (destroyers, cruisers, battleships, carriers) to *833*.

EDIT: To further put that into perspective, a destroyer (2,500 tons usually) is almost 85 standard tanks (30 tons each). The US produced at least 17,000 tanks with the destroyers alone (pre-war 171 to post-war 377 doesn't account for losses sustained from 41-45 just force numbers total).",0,1402440566,null,0,1402443254,0,ci4ar1p,t3_27s2ch,t1_ci4ar1p,t1_ci46zad,null,1434182733,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

Lesson 1: things must remain as they are, with no regard for the morality of what it takes to keep them as such.

&gt; After all, we are an European people from white race, Greek and Latin culture, and Christian religion.

Lesson 2: identity is eternal and unchanging, crystallized in a perfect moment in history (which might be the current moment in some breeds of conservativism or a mythical golden age in others) and defineable in clear-cut terms like ""Greek and Latin culture"".

&gt; Try to mix oil and vinegar together. Shake the bottle. After a while, they get separated again.

Lesson 2-bis: identity is eternal and unchanging, just like natural phenomena.

&gt; The Arabs are the Arabs, the French are the French.

Lesson 3: ignore the multiple, deep interminglings with other cultures that profoundly influenced our own when we wish to draw the distinction.

&gt; Do you believe that the French nation is able to integrate ten million Muslims who shall be twenty million tomorrow and forty million the day after? If we integrated them, if all the Arabs and Berbers were considered French, how could we prevent them from moving to our home country where the standard of living is so much higher?

Lesson 4: assume that all change is catastrophic, paint an apocalyptic picture of it without further analysis.

I mean, it's an ideology. People get convinced that the world works this way and there's not much you can do about it. Not that this is limited to conversativism, I just happen to disagree with it so I immediately spot the flaws.

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; What's extremely sad about this is that the dip since 2008 probably isn't all that much caused by changed policies and industries looking for cleaner alternatives, as it is by people being unable to afford gas and cars, and less production of goods in general. 

Actually it's the other way round. While the decrease of GDP per capita was one factor, the 2008-12 reduction of emissions happened mostly due to lower carbon intensity of energy (e.g. more renewables) and decrease in primary energy intensity (e.g. improved energy efficiency).

EEA analysis: [Why did greenhouse gas emissions decrease in the EU between 1990 and 2012?](http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/why-are-greenhouse-gases-decreasing)

&gt; Summary 2009 - The strength of the 2009 recession affected all economic sectors in the EU. Consumption of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) fell compared to the previous year, mainly due to reduced coal use. The decreased demand for energy linked to the economic recession was accompanied by a strong increase in renewable energy use, which also contributed to lower emissions. Sustained growth in the use of renewables was therefore a key factor explaining the strong decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in 2009. 
&gt;
Summary 2010 - The increase in emissions in 2010 was partly driven by the economic recovery from the 2009 recession in many European countries, which had itself caused substantial emission reductions in 2008 and 2009 in all Member States. Final energy demand increased by 3.8% in 2010, outpacing the increase in economic output (2.0%). In 2010 the winter was also colder than in the previous year, leading to increased demand for heating and higher emissions from the residential and commercial sectors. The continued strong increase in renewable energy use and the improved carbon intensity of fossil fuels - underpinned by strong gas consumption - prevented the increase in GHG emissions from being higher. 
&gt;
Summary 2011 - For the EU as a whole, the 4.1% decrease in CO2 emissions in 2011 came amid positive economic growth in most EU member states. GDP increased by 1.7%, although economic growth was lower than in 2010, when GDP increased by 2%. A milder 2011 winter compared to 2010 can, to a large extent, explain lower fossil fuel emissions. This is because, on average, the higher winter temperatures led to lower heating demand and lower emissions from the residential and commercial sectors. The increase in coal use did not offset a much larger decrease in the consumption of natural gas, and emissions fell as a result. 
&gt;
Summary 2012 - The 1.1 % decrease in CO2 emissions from energy in EU-28 in 2012 came along with economic recession across the EU as a whole. Half the EU member states experienced negative economic growth in 2012. In the other half, positive economic growth in 2012 was lower than in 2011. The winter in Europe was on average colder in 2012 than in 2011 leading to higher heating demand and emissions from households. However, higher residential emissions did not offset much lower emissions in other sectors such as transport and industry. Also, the increase in coal use in 2012 did not offset a much larger decrease in the consumption of oil natural gas. There was also a substantial increase in renewable energy in 2012, continuing the long-term trend observed since 1990.

Ich mache das nicht. Und auch keiner meiner eher linksradikalen Freunde und Bekannten tut sich dabei besonders hervor. Die meisten von uns haben ein sehr ausgeprägtes und positives Verhältnis zu ihrer Herkunft, zu ihrer Kultur, zu ihrer Community. Fast wilkürlich gezogene Grenzen, welche das Ende des Verwaltungsgebietes der hiesigen Regierung markieren, tragen dazu nur schlicht und ergreifend nichts bei, das sich nicht auf den Einfluss der selben politischen Institutionen beschränkte.

Das kann leicht gezeigt werden anhand der zig-hundert Sprachen und Mundarten, welche in Europa seither ausgestorben sind. In Italien sprachen überhaupt nur die allerwenigsten Menschen italienisch. An den Flickenteppich, der nicht Deutschland war, erinnerst du dich? Damals war man keiner Nation ergeben, sondern dem König, dem Papst o.ä. Und *Das* ist ungefähr die Kategorie in die das gehört.

Der Schluss liegt darum nahe, dass nicht eigentlich Anti-Nationale hier ihre Herkunft verleugnen, sondern *Du* machst das indem du sie in diese Flagge wickelst, welche mit dir so wenig zu schaffen hat, wie schon mit den Menschen hier vor einigen hundert Jahren, und die darum äußerst brutal etabliert und im, bis heute, extremsten Ausbruch totaler Barbarei, dem Zweiten Weltkrieg, verteidigt werden musste.

true,much_reddit_so_amaze,ANAR,Apathy,"&gt;Greece was long thought of as the easiest way for potential refugees get into the EU, as its borders were very porous – the government could not afford to patrol the borders between Greece and Turkey. 

It has never been a question of lacking the funds to patrol the border. There's a tangled web of international law, trafficking organizations and local corruption that makes it futile. No amount of patrols mean anything if all they will find is crowds of ""asylum seekers fleeing warzones who just happen to have no form of identification whatsoever"". Current international and European law mandates that asylum seekers must be accommodated by the receiving country while their asylum applications are processed. Processing these applications without any paperwork or the cooperation of the countries of origin is near impossible. Traffickers know how to game the system. Please note that I'm not saying immigrants are to blame for this state of affairs. They are the victims of this whole charade and are treated horribly by traffickers and the Greek authorities.

&gt;But in late 2012, the Greek government erected a four-metre, six-mile barbed wire fence along the Greek-Turkish land border that would keep out potential asylum seekers. Since then, the flow of refugee seekers has moved from land to sea, to different Greek islands in the Aegean, and eventually Italy and Malta.


The flow of refugees didn't shift from Greece to Italy and Malta. These are different pathways that have existed independently for many years. The Greek pathway is mostly used by middle easterners while the Italian/Maltese one by North/Central Africans.

Same goes for ""The Arabs are the Arabs, the French are the French"" and the mosque fearmongering thing.

HOWEVER, I find his argument that minorities should stay minorities makes sense: the idea of a ""Leitkultur"", though more common among Germanic countries, argues that a society can only undergo changes up to a certain limit. Beyond that, radical changes such as heavy diluting a pre-existing culture (remember, we're not the U.S.) and in fact creating a radically new one (which would happen if minorities stopped being, well, minorities) would cause social unrest. It's a well known fact that an established ""national identity"" (culture and religion, mostly) leads to less social unrest. This one of conservatism's core arguments. 

However, De Gaulle doesn't advocate cultural statism: IMO, he merely advocates the mixing of minority cultures with the leading one, the latter obviously retaining its dominant status but gaining in diversity. That is what I would call cultural enrichment.

1 month in Greece-7 months in cyprus-1 month in Greece close to my home place as a reward for serving to Cyprus.
- As an infantry general porpuse driver, my training was frequent but not hard. Not in Greece Neither in Cyprus.
-But i used to drive vehicles and infantry/material to the training fields and there i can say a few times it was quite intence. I dont know how things are today.
-I sudjest people who serve should always have a book to read or an mp3 so that time masses a bit more creatively, this is what I did. 
-As a driver i had a pretty boring everyday schedule driving through Cyprus for military or non military porpuses (even driving officials to everyday works they had).
-Every 5-6 days i was on a beach or Nicosia Center for a beer - coffee.
-I got many day offs (every guys used to have 33 days off split in 3 periods plus the extra day offs you have before and after we seve in cyprus) so i totally might have actually served minus 2 months(=total day offs for a guy that has served in cyprus)
-I got payed 440 euros per month. Not bad, guys that serve in greece get 8 euros per month. lol
-I met people, greeks and turks, all seemed nice people. I liked turks more than cypriots (=greeks,  sorry turks i am used to talk like that, i ask forgiveness). Cypriots seem kind of arrogant-selfish and not ready (mentaly) to protect their land, although they suffered a lot, they forget. I think they feel greeks are responcible for their fate and might be true, but I didnt live back in 1974 and if they dont like me for some thing that a dictatorship and the CIA+MI5 did,they are always welcome to express their opinion. (Yes my turk friends, among greeks there is hate as well).
-if i was forced to serve again i would choose cyprus again though, is a nice place to visit.
-I have heard that the guys that serve in the Turkish or Turk Cypriot army have quite a hard time due to their officers take advantage of their position and humiliate them. I never experienced such a thing in the Greek militarry regime there.
A message to Cypriot citizents: I know serving must be hard or useless for our lives (short thinking but ok people have opinions, i disagree). Just think the fact that people are brought to serve from an other country on your own and if a war escalates might die on your land. So be glad you serve 2-3 hours from your home (worst case scenario). I served 2 hours flight distance, i am an islander from the Ionian Islands and i chose to serve in cyprus instead of Thrace (some ho i knew it would be better-easier-calmer etc) but if something hapenned i was 1500km from my home town. think about that. be gratefull things can be worse for a greek or a turk or anyone else.",0,1402451533,null,0,1402453162,0,ci4fkw0,t3_2712j6,t1_ci4fkw0,t1_chwk635,null,1434185008,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

In Europe, I think the countries are better off having their traditional ethnicity in the majority. European states are centered around ethnic groups: Germany for Germans; Slovakia for Slovaks etc. When this gets even a little out if wack, things can get tense and societal cohesion begins to tear, just look at the Castilians and the Catalans: relatively speaking, they are *extremely* similar in terms of ethnicity and language, and yet there is still tension. **Its just better that European states don't get their ethnic equilibrium too out of balance.**


My opinion regarding my own country, the United States, is entirely different on this matter. The US has no right to declare itself as an ethnically based state, if the natural course of population dynamics bring the US toward a non-white majority, so be it. (however, the US does need to stay linguistically and to a certain extent, ideologically homogenous)

Tl;dr **Old World societies are better of maintaining their ethnic and cultural equilibrium.** New World societies are syncretic by nature and should accept racial / ethnic change.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"&gt;I can't come up with many faults in liberal democracy.

It depends on your point of view, and there's a lot of take into account. I think the problem is more the flaws of Representative Democracy.

The whole idea is that we elect an educated set of people to represent out interests. More often than not, you get people who are uneducated in policy and only campaign on rhetoric or capitalize on the ignorance of people. 

Essentially, instead of compensating for the weaknesses of direct democracy, it exacerbates them then puts the power in the hands of a few people who do not have the general population's best interests at heart, or who will not do what they have campaigned to do, or will flip flop on issues.

Capitalism is indeed a very major part of this problem, and I personally find it hard to criticize one without the other. But it is an inherent problem within the system as well; When the whole game is rigged so that all the candidates only have an interest in getting into power, and all the candidates flip-flop, and all the candidates just focus on campaigning and finding a way to win the next election, there's no real viable alternative and you end up in an essentially oligarchic system. Yeah, you get to change the oligarchs every few years, but nothing really changes. In a recent talk, Chomsky actually said Europe was *worse* than the US in this regard, stating that no matter who we've elected in the past several decades, each successive government has done the same as the last one.

So, I think there's a fair bit to criticize about it, but it's not a system without good ideas, and I think it'll talk a new form of representative democracy in which the population plays a much more direct part for things to work properly.",0,1402454191,null,0,false,0,ci4gsp7,t3_27smrx,t1_ci4gsp7,t1_ci426hj,null,1434185582,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Das ist ein schlechtes Beispiel für Paid Content. Solche Art von ""breaking news"" wird sich - ähnlich wie Fussballergebnisse - immer den Weg bahnen. Zumindest kann auch hier der Paid Content Subscriber offenbar noch rufen ""Ich las es als Erster"".

Die Aussage Niggemeiers gilt übrigens nicht nur für Bild: Wer irgendwo ""breaking news""-Content exklusiv bezahlt, ist zu blöd zum kurzen Warten, bis es woanders erscheint.

Agreed.

I see De-Gaulles point as being about the capacity of society to turn immigrants into french people, noting that a small minority can be steadily integrated.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As an American I can give you a few good reasons why not:


1. Putting aside his revelations regarding mass surveillance, when he got to Hong Kong [he gave the Chinese IP addresses being monitored by the NSA to ingratiate himself.](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1260306/edward-snowden-classified-us-data-shows-hong-kong-hacking-targets?page=all) Just a few months ago files from his cache were published detailing US espionage operations against Huawei and the top levels of the Chinese government. Just putting aside the fact that China has been waging unrestricted cyber economic warfare against both the US and Europe, any nation by virtue of accepting Snowden is placing themselves in the middle of a cyberwar between the US and China. China now routinely uses Snowden as the reason that they won't even negotiate a code of cyber conduct. The Snowden leaks also came right before the Obama meeting with Xi Jinping and completely derailed any American attempt to have a dialogue on the issue. Ultimately by taking Snowden in it would undermine the US and legitimize the Chinese aspect of Snowden's leaks despite the ongoing conflict. That will not be taken lightly, in fact it will be taken as siding with a US adversary in a militarized conflict.


2. Snowden is conducting himself as if he was a civil rights campaigner practicing civil disobedience. Look, if he did something illegal that he believed was justified he should come back and fight for his day in court. Frankly that is a whole new can of worms for the US government and privately I'm sure that they would much rather him stay in Moscow for the time being. I don't remember Rosa Parks, Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr. or Ghandi fleeing a continent and an ocean away to escape the consequences of their civil disobedience. In fact, part of civil disobedience is taking the consequences to show how truly unjust the system is. That is how you bring about real change. It's very easy for the NSA and Congress not to reform itself with Snowden living in Putin's Russia, having lawyer who sits on the board of the FSB while phoning into Putin's call in show. It's ridiculous with his appearances by screen in Scotland, the US and Europe where he rails from his FSB safe house about how unjust the US is.


3. He has lied very obviously during his interviews multiple times. Take for instance his blanket statement saying that he has no relationship with the Russian government. You don't have a lawyer who sits on the board of the FSB or get on the Putin call in show without some sort of relationship with the Russian government. His denial is preposterous. He's also said things like that he has written policy for the NSA. Putting aside anything about his functionary levels, Snowden worked for a defense contractor. By design US policy is written by US government employees not outside contractors.  He has also boasted about having more access to intelligence than just about any other official in US intelligence: ""I had more access than almost any other official in the intelligence community,"" That's bullshit, okay. We can argue that maybe he had more access to intelligence than he was supposed to, but to say that a outside contractor sysadmin had more access than almost any other intelligence officer is grandiose bullshit. It smacks of vanity and he shouldn't be undermining himself with such lies. You can see how his internal monologue has changed over time to where he is now some sort of super contracted sys admin that is writing US policy and has more access to intelligence than almost any other intelligence officer. By nature contractors are given lower security clearances than agency employees and while he may have had more access to information than he should have I sincerely doubt that he had the access privileges of the NSA director or generals in the Pentagon.

true,WalkerEU,CYPR,Cyprus,"&gt; i simply don't recognise a sufficiently converged set of aims and expectations to forge what we might call a european people. the result is that common governance would not be able to be [both] representative of, [and] accountable to, a people. it is therefore a much better result if governance remains principally at the nation-state level.

This always will be an important point and I'm glad you think this way. In the United States of America, the Republicans are constantly talking about reducing the competences of the federal government and clawing back powers to the states. You see, the same arguments we use for why there is no such thing as ""europeans"" can apply to the ""americans"" too. The only thing that makes it slightly more complicated for us are the languages, which are slowly becoming less of an issue due to knowledge of the English language being on the rise globally. But in the meantime, ""americans"" remain divided on many issues such as abortion, legality of gay marriage, immigration, taxation, social benefits, healthcare, climate change, weed legalization, etc. In fact, you will probably find that we may have much more common ground in the EU on some of these issues than they do over there.

&gt; i do not recognise the legitimacy of a spitzenkndidate to rule a europe i am subject to the governance of, i do not consent that he should rule in my name.

I hear arguments such as this one at a national level all the time. Lets say the ""right wing"" candidate wins by 2-3%, the ""left wing"" supporters can make the exact same argument. Obviously in the EU Parliament it feels slightly worse because the power is split up quite a lot more, but they can bring ""legitimacy"" by having S&amp;P support Juncker.

If, on the other hand, you want to bring light to the weaknesses of ""democracy"" as-is in today's world, then I may be willing to agree with you to a certain extent. I am definitely a fan of the way Switzerland handles democracy.

Can't really call what we have today, even at national levels ""democracy"". I view it as an act of convincing everyone that the majority wants ""these people"" to make decisions, then they do whatever they want/feel like for the remainder of their term citing the democratic will of the people, while fucking over the general population. I heard a quote regarding the greek minister reshuffle on the local news yesterday and I seem to recall that the new goals are to look out for the Greek people or something similar to this (*we heard you loud and clear, yeah!*)..

That analysis was a bit tendentious in its selection of criteria. For example, they ignore eg. geographic proximity and political backing. They also had an all-or-nothing approach: adding a few outliers to an otherwise solid currency area would sink its coherence score.

That was explicitly not its job - practically all national differentiation remained a competence of member states due to their sovereignity concerns.

&gt;Europe is very likely to loose its place in the world if it spends 20 years in stagnation, which if the euro survives is inevitable.

The stagnation is due to austerity backed by neoliberalism, which was the dominant mode of thought anyway. That would have happened without the Euro too.

Those Communists and their sympathizers were more likely to appreciate the actual contributions of the USSR as well as overvalue Soviet accomplishments as compared to the contributions of others.

By 1994 the Communists in France were no longer a viable political force and attitudes about Communism were very different (a Cold War will do that). People were more likely to undervalue Soviet contributions or to never have fully learned about them in the first place.

The jump from 1994 to 2004 is also likely influenced by modern  issues such as simply the passing of time (America is still powerful militarily, Russia far less than the USSR in 1945, and modern perceptions do impact those of history for many people), as well as modern politics and personal affiliations.

Russia did this by acting the way it is. We *cannot* allow that kind of aggression right on our doorstep. We must stay the course and stand up to those who seek to weaken us.

The investment may be pleasant in the short run, but in the long run it will make us more dependent on Gazprom and less able to deal with the Kremlin on equal footing.


This is way too serious to give in, we are playing the Kremlin's game and any sign of weakness will be fully taken advantage of.

Edit: they will try to do the same thing they did with the nord stream in Germany.

They will use the south stream pipeline to deliver discounted gas to Austria, Italy and eventually to France. The business communities of all these countries will become hooked on the south stream gas. Just as Germany's business community became hooked on nord stream gas.

Then, when Russia makes it's moves in Eastern Europe, it will be able to call upon Italian, Austrian and French business communities to lobby against any harsh moves to counter the Kremlin.

You next best bet is to be near a subway station, ideally closer to the center (it can take a while to reach the stations near the edge of the city) and/or well connected. RER stations can be very convenient because those trains only stop at a few stations. I would advise to stay in Paris proper, not the suburbs.

rosa Elefanten, Zinssystemen und Juden
?
Bzw. was ist dein konkreter Vorwurf?

Rosa Elefanten weiß ich nicht, aber fangen wir bei den Chemtrails an. Die gängige Erzählung dieser Leute ist, dass eine ominöse Clique aus der ""Ostküste"" der USA, meistens werden hier die Rothschilds genannt oder die Zentralbank Fed, das deutsche Volk vergiften will. Dazu werden Giftstoffe mithilfe von Flugzeugen verteilt, die dann offensichtlich für jeden, am Himmel verteilt werden. In diesem Narrativ ist eindeutig das ""Brunnenvergifter"" Motiv zu erkenne. Der Jude (Rothschild, jüdisch unterwanderte FED) will das Volk (meist die Deutschen) mit Gift im Brunnen (Chemtrails) unterdrücken und ermorden.

Ähnlich verhält es sich mit der Zinskritik. Den Zins zu bemängeln ist nicht die Hauptmotivation dieser Kapitalismuskritik. Es ist aber praktisch für diese Leute, weil es zur Personifizierung ökonomischer Phänomene geeignet ist. Der Zins wird als ""Instrument von Einzelpersonen"" genutzt, um andere Volkswirtschaften zu knechten. Oft fällt die Phrase der Zinsknechtschaft. Tja, und wer knechtet die armen Deutschen? Überraschung, wieder tauchen dort nur jüdische Namen auf. Der Zins als Mittel der jüdischen Weltherrschaft, wieder ein altes Bild im neuen Gewand.

true,waazd,SVAK,USA,"Excellent points. Many people don't seem aware that whistleblowers **are protected under American law.** We're not barbarians, anyone who exposes illegal activity has protection under the Whistleblower Protection Act. The issue at hand is that, barring an unexpected Supreme Court ruling, to the best of my knowledge Snowden has not revealed anything illegal. Edward Snowden is not the arbitor of legality in the United States, and despite all of his claims that the government is engaging in illegal activity to the best of my knowledge nothing revealed by his leaks has been revealed to be illegal.

Beyond that, he lost any credibility he had as a supposed advocate of free speech or human rights when he sought asylum first with China, and then with Russia. No country is perfect and ours is less so than many, but it's impossible to take a man seriously when he, as you said, rails against American tyranny from an FSB safehouse.

Another issue I have with the man is his obvious taste for celebrity. He claims to value his personal safety, but revealed himself to the public almost instantly after he had arrived in Hong Kong. Although he claimed he did so out of a desire to protect his colleagues from being accused of leaking information, something tells me the NSA isn't stupid enough to say to themselves ""Hey, we just had some leaks and one of our guys is hiding in Hong Kong. Must not have been him!""

I don't think Snowden is necessarily a bad guy-misguided, overly self-impressed maybe but not a bad guy. I just don't think he's any real hero. Oh, and any country that gives him asylum risks doing incredible damage to their relations with the USA. For better or for worse there are *maybe* 5 countries that could do so and not immediately run into dire economic consequences, and it's simply terrible politics to put your neck out like that.

e:

And for what it's worth, although the average citizen can and should be upset about American spying, it has to be said that the spying would have been of no surprise to a leader of any reasonably relevant nation. It's the name of the game-every single country spies on other countries. My parents are Americans who worked overseas for many years, and in their last posting we saw Chinese men taking pictures of the front of our house a few different times. I once had a white man with a northern European (no idea where) accent ask me detailed questions about the local American embassy's layout when he found out I was American.

3: Compound nouns with a proper name as the first componend are combined by a hyphen. However, the variant with a space is seen sometimes and has a good chance of becoming standard some time.

4: Spelling, and comes after the modifying prase.

**Crematorio** es nuestro The Sopranos particular. Trata sobre un constructor corrupto envuelto en una trama de corrupcion urbanistica en Levante. Es corta, al estilo ingles, solo 6 episodios, pero con excelentes interpretaciones y guion.

**7 Vidas** es probablemente nuestra mejor *sitcom*. Un tio se queda en coma y se despierta 17 años despues. Bajo esa excusa para comenzar la trama se emitieron 7 temporadas de una especie de Friends en Madrid que a su vez dio luz a un *spinoff*, Aida, que fue divertido durante unos pocos años.

**Historias para no dormir** es el equivalente español a The Twilight Zone. Nunca se menciona aqui porque es viejilla: Se emitio en los 60 y 70 en TVE, pero es una obra cojonuda. Esta escrita y dirigida por uno de los mejores realizadores de TV de España: Narciso ""Chicho"" Ibañez Serrador. Algunos son guiones originales, otros son adaptaciones de relatos de Ray Bradbury entre otros, pero todos estan enmarcados en el genero del terror, el misterio y un poco de ciencia ficcion. Soberbios.

**Cuentame** es una serie de 2000 sobre la vida en España de una familia de clase media de Madrid a partir de 1960, aun con el regimen de Franco a pleno rendimiento. Ha tenido unos años posteriores francamente malos, con personajes desquiciados por exigencias de un guion que nadie sabe ya como estirar.

German leaders command their adherents to spread German rule across the entire globe and they are certainly trying. I could not care less about having a chance of not being killed outright, but live in Untermenschen while non-Aryan culture gets slowly annihilated by the repugnant culture of Germany. I oppose all German immigration into my country exactly because I do not want them to do to my country what your ""tolerant"" Germans did to the Poles and Jews.

Hey look, I can make stupid generalizations about your culture too!

Oh, and the Germans killed millions in genocide much more recently than anything to do with the Byzantine Greeks. Does that mean all Germans are terrible people? Should I call my congressman and tell him I want to stop Germans from emigrating here?

true,hashthug,EURO,Europe. Enlightenment.,"They were not pretending. An alliance with the UK and France was the USSR's strategy in the 1930s. What really changed it was the Munich agreement in 1938 - the westerns practically gave Czechoslovakia to Hitler and the USSR wasn't even invited. The soviets concluded that the westerns are trying to push Germany to the east. You can't just ignore that and say ""Hitler+Stalin=BFF"".

Contacts with Germany after the M-R pact was how the soviets knew that Germany is going to invade.

&gt;Before Molotov goes to Berlin [November 1940] Stalin gives him instructions. The instructions generally indicate that Stalin is interested in the possibility of new Nazi-Soviet pact which will establish, re-establish Soviet-Germany relations for the long term, or at least for the immediate term. There’s a genuine attempt--in my reading of it--in Berlin by Molotov to arrive at some kind of agreement. When that proves impossible, that’s the moment in which Stalin (and Molotov as well), conclude that the Nazi-Soviet pact is over and the scenario that is emerging is a war scenario. The issue then becomes when that war scenario going to materialize and how long can conflict with Hitler be put off.

Please, if you want to open a bar that doesn't allow smoking then its your good right to do just that, on the other hand a smoker should be able to open a pub that allows indoor smoking. If a non-smoker doesn't like it then he's free to frequent another pub with different rules. No need to get the state involved in this.

Castile and León were joined dynastically in 1230, not by conquest, so in a very loose sense one continued to exist along the other.

Catalonia was never a kingdom. It was a collection of counties, the greatest among them being Barcelona, and the highest treatment it received was of ""Principality"", about 200 years after being dynastically joined to Aragon. That's why it technically doesn't have arms in the CoA because it isn't a separate kingdom or crownland in itself, but part of another (Aragon). Of course the point is moot because the royal house of Aragon from the union to the Trastamaras was Catalan and always used the red and gold bars as their symbol which are Catalan in origin.

The [ZDF Mediathek](http://www.zdf.de/ZDFmediathek/#/hauptnavigation/startseite) certainly has quite a bunch that are useful for learning while watching. And I think Luther as well, as soon as another season is running. From what I know it is even dubbed quite well.

Personally I would probably choose one of the many crime series (SOKO etc.), because it's pretty much always the same story line, very predictable and thus easy to follow.

And then I can only suggest you watch [Die Sendung mit der Maus.](http://www.wdrmaus.de/aktuelle-sendung/index.php5) Entertaining, informative, well explained and easy to understand. The best kids show on the planet.

Finally here's how I learned much of my spoken English: I used to watch CNN International a lot as a youth esp. the sports sections. So if are into this a news channel like [N-TV's live stream](http://www.n-tv.de/mediathek/livestream/) may be helpful.

It's worth pointing out that the state of press freedom in the USA has declined immeasurably in the last decade. 

Not only are they sitting at no.46 for press freedom index - that's one notch below Romania and one notch above Haiti - but they currently have Barrett Brown in jail with charges for over 100 years for refusing to give up a source. 

I know reddit is typically hyperbolic but the state of freedom in the US compared to Watergate 1970's and today is a world of difference.

There is no way on earth that Daniel Ellsberg, in 2014, would've been allowed to tour the US discussing at USA's best universities why what he did was right. He would be locked up, like Barrett Brown, with over a centuries worth of charges levelled at him. 

In fact, here's an article written by Daniel Ellsberg himself saying exactly why Snowden wouldn't receive a fair trial like he perhaps would've received if he'd leaked at the time Daniel leaked the pentagon papers.

Kolonialherrschaften von GB, Frankreich und den Niederlanden oder Sklaverei in den USA). Da wirst du schnell sehr froh sein, dass man die Vergangenheit in Deutschland in der Regel nicht mit einem lapidaren ""Achja - das ist ja jetzt auch schon bisschen her!"" abtut, sondern differenzierter und sensibler behandelt und sich dessen erinnert.

The right to a fair trial can't be waved away by saying ""*Of course* he'll get a fair trial - they will fairly apply their (US, Saudi Arabian, North Korean, whatever) law!"". There are very specific provisions in the [UDHR](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/) about that exactly is ""fair"" and what explicitly isn't, and we need to check in each specific case if this would be the case.

Relying on *any* government to say if their trials are fair or not doesn't work and there's no point even asking them. They will *all* claim that it does anyway.

We have to regulate it because it simply doesn't work otherwise. In a perfect world we wouldn't need laws making stuff illegal, but we don't and so we need to regulate some stuff so we can live together. That you are allowed to smoke in a bar actually is an anachronism, because the smoke actually infringes several regulations about the air quality at workplaces.

A monarch has no natural legitimacy to impose or expect standards just like any other government for each individuals condition and context determines what is right and what is wrong. That can be inforced my a more tight nit society but the general entroby of society is continously increasing you can not bring the individuality down just because you wish it so.

 Also power will fundamentally be abused the only difference is that within a monarchy the lack of a actual threat or finality will make the abuses less urgent, however a rulling class always takes it's piece of the pie, morality is just a pretext for seeking power, power by its self is the motive. And even if the rulling class is honorable as it's interest is in preserving and imporving the country, the people closer to them have other concerns as their position is transitory and like all men our rulers will still be vulnerable to the soft words of a friend, lover or neighbour.

The advantage of monarchy on society, all being very anecdotal as monarchies are products of their time rather than actual independent case studies in national organisation, are far outweighed by the problems caused by the frailty of the human spirit(we are not intrinsically moral and honor is just a myth told to lesser men, that can not really think independently, to aspire to and be on their best behavior, we can not see the future or predict complex outcomes, in short none of us are fit to rule) combined with the the lack of accountability and permanency. 

Due to the sacrificial nature of election the rotation rate is high, some stay longer others less, but the long term result is that you get an average, not great rulers nor horrible, and if you acount for paradigm shifts and revolutions, then you get representatives that are reasonably in lign with the people they serve.

That's indeed a very interesting question and I fear I cannot answer it. Some people may think ""it's the german spirit"" but this seems far to simplistic to me. Maybe the [Kleinstaaterei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleinstaaterei) had to with it. Because germany was a unification of a shitload of smaller states, there were also shitloads of political, cultural and technological centers throughout germany (instead of only one big center like in France or the UK). Maybe this was an ideal situation for innovative thinkers and companies.

But even if this is true, it's also only one piece of the puzzle.

Concerning appeasement politics, the wikipedia article I linked to is pretty solid (browsing over it gives you a good idea). There were a lot of political crisis and just twenty years after WWI, the other nations hoped they could prevent a second ""big war"" by tolerating Hitler's aggressive actions. Partly, they also tolerated this because germany was treated very badly after WWI and a lot of (important) people thought ""Actually, it's all right if Hitler does that - we were pretty unfair to them after WWI.""

Which is why I'm trying to explain that your argument is in effect trying to make this an isolated incident, that if not only the lax regulations and lack of investigations of private Muslim schools then the problem would not be. 

As I said, if not in this situation then they would impose Islam on the British people through other means. Islam is the exact issue, and if Cameron's privatization frenzy, or whatever we might call it, is somehow furthering their cause, it's still not the problem in itself.

Alas, it seems that a vast majority prefers to be able to smoke in a bar and thus those bars are more frequented. If you don't like it then nobody is stopping you from opening a smoke-free bar and become a billionaire with all your non-smoker customers.

Air quality at the workplace? A ridiculous point, especially for those Eckkneipen with only one room where the owner is also the barkeeper. You want to tell this guy he has to leave his own bar to smoke outside?? And if people don't like smoke in their work environment they can feel free to look for a job in a different venue. Outlawing smoking in a bar for employee health reasons is about as retarted as outlawing smoking in shisha bars or dutch coffeeshops. People go there explicitly to smoke, it can't be compared to other work environments such as a hospital.

And those cigarette vending machines are next to the bubble gum machines has to do with the simple fact that they are often both owned by the same vending machine company, it makes logistical sense to have em close together so that the refill guy can do his job faster. Gum vending machines are a dying breed though, this won't be much of a problem in the near future.

My final point is simple: I stay out of your business, please stay out of mine.

true,MrKnot,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Putting aside his revelations regarding mass surveillance, when he got to Hong Kong he gave the Chinese IP addresses being monitored by the NSA to ingratiate himself.

The article you linked says nothing of the sort. It says that he *showed* the South China Post, a *Hong Kong* newspaper, some *civilian* IP addresses that the NSA had monitored in HK and China. It says nothing about 'ingratiating himself'. This is no different than revealing the NSA had tapped specific people in Europe.

&gt; Snowden is conducting himself as if he was a civil rights campaigner practicing civil disobedience.

That's a mischaracterization. Snowden is not practicing civil disobedience, which is openly disobeying a law you believe to be unjust. He doesn't think that laws making intelligence activity secret are wrong. He's broken secrecy laws to show that there exist *other* laws and practices that are wrong. That's whistleblowing, it has little to do with civil disobedience.

&gt; He has lied very obviously during his interviews multiple times. Take for instance his blanket statement saying that he has no relationship with the Russian government. You don't have a lawyer who sits on the board of the FSB or get on the Putin call in show without some sort of relationship with the Russian government. His denial is preposterous.

So your entire evidence to say that he has lied about this is that 'you don't have to actually have evidence to know he lied'?

&gt; He's also said things like that he has written policy for the NSA. Putting aside anything about his functionary levels, Snowden worked for a defense contractor. By design US policy is written by US government employees not outside contractors.

His point was precisely that the way matters were handled, private contractors had the power to effectively write policy. And you don't have any evidence that his claim here is an 'obvious lie'.

&gt; He has also boasted about having more access to intelligence than just about any other official in US intelligence: ""I had more access than almost any other official in the intelligence community,"" That's bullshit, okay. We can argue that maybe he had more access to intelligence than he was supposed to, but to say that a outside contractor sysadmin had more access than almost any other intelligence officer is grandiose bullshit.

Once again, his point is that access control policy on the NSA systems was so leaky that he could gain access to practically anything even though he was just a technical contractor.

Stop this stupid bullshit, mate. NOBODY will answer like that in a pub. They go there either they want it or they accept it. If someone can't stand it, he will not go into a goddamn pub.

This is so wrong in so many ways. IF there was a majority like you, smoke-free pubs would be popular. But there isn't. You are the minority, most people don't care.

There are plenty of skilled people. They're not all succesful. The difference is luck.

Because the already succesful already have all they need. We need to remove preexisting success as a prequisite for access to resources, by reducing the importance of networking, making requirements for capital availability more transparent etc.

&gt;Because these families value education more 

There are plenty of people with similar education. Well, if they can afford it. See, people who value education similarly but can't afford it are left behind. So it's not their value system (or their implied moral superiority) that matters, but their money.

Die Hühner gehen auch so dermassen an den eigentlichen Kritikwürdigen Dingen vorbei, dass man sich fragt warum die überhaupt noch Thema sind.. 

Die eigentlichen Kracher sind vermutlich völlig andere Themen. U.a. die Zulassung von Chemikalien für den Markt - in den USA dürfen die erstmal auf den Markt bis *wissenschaftlich* nachgewiesen wird, dass sie schädlich sind. Das [kann schonmal dauern](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/02/10/140210fa_fact_aviv?currentPage=all)... 

Ob darüber verhandelt wird, wissen wir natürlich nicht - das allein ist auch schon ein Skandel. 

Dann diese dubiosen Investitionsschutzabkommen... Konzerne können den Staat oder ein Bundesland verklagen - die Historie aus anderen Gegenden der Welt zeigt, dass dies meist gegen vorsichtige Regierungen verwendet wurde, die Verbraucherrechte durchsetzen wollten.. z.B. gegen günstige Medikamente in [Kanada](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/eli-lilly-files-500m-nafta-suit-against-canada-over-drug-patents-1.1829854)

Ansonsten ist so gut wie alles was wir essen und nutzen durch die EU-Reguliert. In den meisten Fällen durchaus sinnvoll soweit ich das beurteilen kann. Das kommt alles auf den Verhandlungstisch. Massenhaft Fruktose-Glocuse-Syrup in allen Lebensmitteln, weil es billiger ist könnte auch kommen, wer weiss... es weiss ja keiner.. 

Und natürlich das geistige Eigentum.. etc.pp 

Mal sehen was passiert... noch ist ja überhaupt nichts klar und soweit ich das sehe, muss das EU-Parlament auch darüber abstimmen d.h. die Verträge werden irgendwann öffentlich werden. Falls das auch nicht der Fall sein sollte.. holt die Heugabeln aus dem Keller ;) 

Es gibt wirklich verdammt viele gute Gründe gegen dieses Abkommen die nichts mit Chlor-Hühnchen und Gentechnik zu tun haben... 

Achja.. ganz vergessen.. natürlich wird auch vermutlich mehr privatisiert werden.. mit den in den meisten Fällen *tollen* Folgen für öffentliche Kassen und Service... ich sag nur Wasserprivitasierung in Frankreich und teilweise auch in Deutschland...

true,TheEndgame,NORW,Norway,"&gt; There are plenty of skilled people. They're not all succesful. The difference is luck.

No, i wouldn't say luck alone. Even if you have skills in one area you may not have them in another. Being a good carpenter doesn't help when you start a business in the middle of a recession for example.

&gt; Because the already succesful already have all they need. We need to remove preexisting success as a prequisite for access to resources, by reducing the importance of networking, making requirements for capital availability more transparent etc.

So what do you suggest? That we seize a good chunk of their assets? What good would that do? Established corporations growing bigger is absolutely something that benefits the majority of people. Tax revenues go up as well as employment.

&gt; There are plenty of people with similar education. Well, if they can afford it. See, people who value education similarly but can't afford it are left behind. So it's not their value system (or their implied moral superiority) that matters, but their money.

Despite what you think it's not all about money. Schools like Harvard and MIT are free for people with low incomes and good grades. Also it's not a given that you need a good education from a prestige university to succeed. Working your way up in the company is also another way.

&gt; By definition. But why do they have good contacts?

Because when you run a successful business you get in touch with a lot of important people. Contacts are really important even if you like it or not, and always will be. Schools and internships are also good ways to get contacts if you are not of the wealthier kind.

&gt; So we should organize opportunities for people to show their worth previously, rather than relying on happenstance.

I am really curious on how you are planning for this to work.

&gt; I think they get the message at 10 million. Why would 11 million be more motivating?

So what you are saying is that if you got to choose between a job that paid 10 million, you would choose it over a job that paid 11 million? I highly doubt that most people would do it. People much prefer the higher number, it's natural. 

&gt; Which gives you a convenient excuse to blame anyone for their situation. What does ""really want it"" actually mean? Pray hard enough?

I don't blame them, but you can't go around and blame everything around you. I can understand how there isn't much you can do in impoverished countries to better your situation. In western countries however, everything is set up for you in life. If you want to succeed, there is not much stopping you. The definition of success is also another factor. I think most people would be more than happy to live a middle class lifestyle. To achieve that isn't really that difficult. 

&gt; By definition poor people have, at the very least, worse access to capital than rich people.

Which is why public services in western countries are either free or subsidized so that everyone can succeed.

I believe in allowing them to open prayer rooms and mosques, kebabs and halal shops, and so on. I said above that I have an issue with another culture replacing traditional French culture, but to be fully honest, I don't believe that is about to happen.

The second generation of immigrants from traditionally Muslim countries is splitting into two groups - one which is radicalising farther and farther, and fueling the jihadi networks in the Middle-East, and the other which is completely Westernised and who's turning away from tradition - if not from religion itself. That's why I'm not all that worried and I will push for their freedom to live according to their culture.

The caveat, though, would be for these arrivals to respect a French saying, that may or may not exist in English, that goes ""Freedoms of the ones end where the freedoms of the others begin"". That means that you're free to live as you please as long as you respect the other's rights, even if that's not in your culture. If your freedom means putting a burqa on your wife so nobody can see her face because she's a foul temptress bringing men to sin, fuck your freedom. If your freedom means catcalling women in the streets because unveiled women are all sluts, fuck your freedom. If your freedom means booing the Marseillaise at sports events because you want to be edgy, fuck your freedom. And if your freedom means cutting off your daughter's clitoris when she turns 12... Fuck your freedom all the way back to Sudan and I hope you get assraped by a buffalo on the way back.

That's a subject I'm a bit passionate about... Anyway, to fully answer your question, my opinion of the recent arrivals is that they're by and large well integrated into French society. Despite the horror stories about ghetto kids and riots, that's not the majority. We're seeing a common situation of vocal minority, silent majority. Most immigrants study, most work, most respect others. The immigrant community is undergoing a big change with its relationship to women, which is going to last another few years but is headed in the right direction.

Yes, market value of goods and services that are legal and taxable. The shadow economy is made up of things that are illegal, the proceeds of which often go towards funding some of the worst things humanity has to offer, such as terrorism and continued sex trafficking. 

Increasing the EU's funding by way of including the black market in a nation's GDP is an awful idea. It would (aside from the obvious moral bankruptcy) be fuel to the fire of sceptics, who could then correctly argue that, ""the illegal drug trade funds terrorist organisations, crime and the European Union"".

The EU should absolutely not be trying to fund itself by including the  shadow economy. For example, there will never be an EU programme that they say is ""Funded by revenue generated from the West European illegal sex industry"" for very obvious reasons.

&gt; It isn't calculated in GDP because of its moral implications.

But you are warping my original point with some racial slurs.
De Gaulle puts forward this idea that culture (in this case French) would be lost when multiculturalism happens. I was pointing to Ireland as an example of a society who attempts to brush a lot of its historic Catholic culture under the rug (Child mass graves, priest paedophilia etc etc) that had a mild (when compared to France) rise in immigrants in the 90s and lo and behold the Irish culture is still there with plenty of people of African and Asian ethnicity taking part in it.

And the US does a good job welcomming  people of the whole world to make it big, this isnt the case in Europe I will admit, especially culturally. US has a more ""hands off"" attitude and is more tolerant in each person's beleifs. Being French I think its also because 1. France is more secular, so the concept of religious tolerance is less. 2. US law is more about personal liberties. French law more focused on collective liberties and protecting ""state"" values- the state is bigger in France basically. 

Anyways after this tangent on to my comparison. Muslim immigrants to France are different. They didnt come to France for the ""French dream"". France colonized North Africa. After World War 2 France needed to be rebuilt so a lot of North African immigrants came to work in factories. They lived in the then modern high rise buildings outside of big cities to work. But then -boom the 80's, deindustrialization, factories close. All the children of these arab immigrants are now packed in areas full of high rise buildings where there are no jobs. What do they do? They have to resort to other means to make money. These high rise buildings have a terrible quality of life and a lot of crimes and they are incidently populated mainly by immigrants to Frnace- Arabs, carribeans, africans, portuguese. So these French guys were not here for the French dream. Being born in France they are French. Yet they see themselves in a different situation to thre rest of Frnace. There is racism ofcourse, but the main reason that Muslims in France are in a bad situation is because they the reasons for which they came in France didnt work out and they got the wrong end of the stick.

It would affect the human gene pool negatively if this was done. Genetic defects are obviously hereditary, so we're talking about cutting out specific family trees from the gene pool here. If we do that it would lower the diversity within our gene pool. A species that has lower diversity within the gene pool is less adaptable to changing environmental conditions and is more likely to go extinct. It is also more likely to stagnate the beneficial evolution of the species. From the perspective of the health of our gene pool it's more valuable to us to have high biodiversity a we can within the species than it is to eliminate bad genes.

Besides it'll be a moot discussion soon enough anyay, I'd say that we will get the ability to cure genetic diseases trough gene therapy at the end of the century at the very latest, probably quite a bit sooner.

Ansonsten empfehle Ich immer mal wieder das Üben von Leseverständnis und Kontextlesen:

Im Muttercomment wurde implizit der Versuch des pushens der transatlantischen Agenda nahegelegt und ferner die Möglichkeit offen gelassen, dass es eine Falschinfo sein könnte. Das zusammen führte mich zum Begriff ""Propaganda"". Außerdem formulierte der Begriff des ""lupereinen Transatlantikers"" (-&gt;oft auf osteuropäische Politiker angewandt) implizit eine Art Korruptionsvorwurf; in jedem Fall ist eine pejorative Konnotation vorhanden, von der es nicht mehr weit zum Begriff ""Bösewicht"" ist.

Daher wiederhole Ich mich gerne nochmal:

With the U.S. there's recent and ample precedence as to that one or more of those points can be viewed as very likely.  
  
Actually, if Snowden would apply in Germany (which he did, but they refused arguing that he has to actually be in Germany when he asks for asylum, but he can't of course do that because of the uncertain outcome), they'd be legally bound to grant him asylum because he's being persecuted for political reasons which is grounds enough to grant him sanctuary. They then could extradite him to the U.S. but they'd break the constitution in doing so, but we've learned that they do that in a systematic way anyhow, so I'm just not sure.  
  
I don't know how far the U.S. legal system gets you in that matter, because  
  
- He wouldn't get a public process because he's accused of espionage   
- Secret evidence is legal in that process  
  
and of course Manning, Assange, Hammond, Drake.... provide grave doubts that this would be a fair process, but I don't know if that's grounds enough to stop an extradition, but torture and death penalty absolutely are.

I think it was fairly common that a lot of upper class German citizens did not want their cities to be further destroyed by combat on the ground. So many cities tried to send committees to the incoming Allied forces to negotiate a peaceful capitulation of the city.

The sad thing is, that many Nazi officials, like my grand-grandfather was one, shot soldiers or citizens who wanted to surrender. So it was quite dangerous for the people in the committees.

I only found a German source for the capitulation of my home town (and region). It says that the third Canadian division sent their 7th, 8th and 9th division to conquer the city of Aurich and use that as a bridgehead for the conquest of the war-important city of Emden.

After the Spanish revolution of 1868 and the deposition of Isabella II of Bourbon, he was the first king elected in parliament. He was picked because of his progressive leaning (which made him more compatible with the newly set constitutional monarchy), and because he belonged to a related dynasty (son of the king of Italy).

However, when he got to Spain he found out that just about everyone hated him: Carlists (ultra-conservative traditionalists who supported the Old Regime) and republicans for obvious reasons, but also the Church (as he supported the confiscation of some of their goods and lands), the Borbonic aristocracy, and even the people, who mocked his poor fluency in Spanish. He was only supported by the progressive party, which was becoming more and more divided by the day. After only two years of kingship he just said ""Fuck this shit, I'm going back to Italy!"" and abdicated, making way for the First Spanish Republic.

i went to both a private (Berufsakademie Rhein-Main) and a public university. I guess its the same as in every country. The private one was expensive as fuck, had small classes, excellent teachers and was really comfortable, but I couldn't bear working in financial sector so i quit. After seeing both sides, there are really really good public universities depending on your field of study. For example I'm now at Saarland University and they have one of the best IT departments in the world, we got people there from china, india, usa etc. Plus people in Germany start to rethink. I spoke with colleagues and 10, 20 years ago it was important to which university you went. Hell, you should even mention your teachers. Those times changed, now your personality is important and you overall skills, noone gives a shit where you studied as long as you are good at what you do.

Thats just my 2 cents, maybe some people see it different. If I were you, I'd go to the private if you got tons of money. If youd have to think twice about going out for a beer or two then, go to the public and enjoy your life.

Depending on whether or not you consider him a monarch (French historiography tends to separate his line from the Kings of France), i'd say **Napoleon I**. Sure, he betrayed the Revolution, but his legislative work served France well in the long run, and he made the rest of Europe shit their pants, which is always fun.

**Henry IV** - Ended the Wars of Religion, ensured free practice to Catholics and Protestants, promoted the arts, restored Paris, more of a diplomat than a warrior, and was assassinated before he could fuck up.

But my favorite has to be **Louis XI** - Hated his father for not taking the fight to the English sooner. Tried to remove him from power at the age of 17. Was forgiven but exiled away from court to his own domain, where he continued to plot against his father until dad died and he became King. Surrounded himself with men of talent, not rank or noble blood. Got the English to renounce their claims to Normandy through ""The force of pâté, meat and wine"" (wining, dining and paying them until they went away). Dealt with his enemies by playing them against each other, brewing wars between them and executed those that didn't fall for it. This is a man who was so far from giving a fuck it's not even funny. He had such a web of spies and plots and betrayals always ready that he was nicknamed ""The Universal Spider"".

Diese Rahmenbedingungen ändern sich ständig und diese änderungen sind hauptsächlich zum Tierwohl. So gibt es in der Massentierhaltung eigentlich keine Anbindehaltung bei den Kühen jedoch ist diese häufiger in alten Ställen der kleinsten Bäuerlichen Betriebe anzutreffen da bei den grossen Betrieben der Personalaufwand bei der Anbindehaltung zu teuer wäre. 

http://www.br.de/radio/bayern2/sendungen/notizbuch/verbot-anbindehaltung-biokuehe-100.html

Bei den Hühnern wurden die herkömmlichen Legebatterien in Deutschland 2010 verboten und in der EU 2012.

Eine weitere nebenwirkung dieser ständigen überarbeitungen der bedingungen zur haltung von Nutztieren ist das diese meist teurer sind als die bisherigen. Was dazu führt das der kleine Bäuerliche Betrieb es sich nicht mehr leisten kann die Tiere zu halten und darum werden die Betriebe immer grösser da sich dort die Kosten für den Tierschutz auf mehr Tiere verteilen.

every certificate includes every perk of lesser certificates. (i.e. Abitur can choose to do the same things as the people with Hauptschulabschluss or Realschulabschluss)




* Hauptschulabschluss (10yrs): you can get basic apprenticeships (mechanic etc)

* Realschulabschluss/Mittlere Reife(10-12yrs): you can apply for all apprenticeships (laboratory, sciences, IT)
 
* Fachabitur (12yrs): you can study in (Fach-)Hochschulen. They are supposed to teach the applied knowledge from the universities to kickstart them into businesses
 
* Abitur(12-14yrs): you can study a broad spectrum of topics in a very theoretical environment. extremely good for scientists, not so good for hands-on guys.

  
some things have changed though... you can now sidestep the disadvantages from university by doing something like an advanced apprenticeship where every week consists of  a few days in a company and some days studying in the university, getting the best of both worlds. i believe its targeted at people with Abitur

Now, I'm not a fan of these christian charities who receive shady funding and use the poverty and desperation of the world's poorest people to further their own religion (you know, 'we'll only feed you if join Jesus) BUT that's a debate for another day.
