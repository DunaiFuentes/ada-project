This gave it away for me. I already suspected you to be some kind of supporter of Erdogan, but the way you are rationalizing this course of action is in itself hypocritical. What you are basically saying here is: there should be freedom of press, but.... In this case, you insert 'not for pro-gulenists' behind it, supposedly out of your own political views. You are willing to simply cast aside the freedom the media possesses, a freedom that is vital for a country to be considered normal and above all: developed.

You willingly ignore and cautiously avoid talking mentioning that Gulen is a political opponent of Erdogan. The same political opponent that is being muzzled here. 

&gt; You are a hypocrite. You don't want democracy for Turkey. You don't want people to have a say on how their country is run if they disagree with you. You want them to be exactly like Western Europe. If the people don't agree then you want the military to bash some heads in and keep them quite.

No, what I want is a responsible state. Read my responses again: did I ever call the democracy the final system of government as has been 'prophesied' by certain high priests of democracy? I don't want a nation on the eastern borders of Europe that goes towards the religious extreme, nor should there be *a place* for it in our present day world.  Democracy should be restored in due time as I said, but I do not consider it untouchable. Secular values supercede democratic rule, as long as the niceties of a normal state of law will be observed. 

And indeed, after Erdogan gets what is coming for him his party, as well as similar parties that harbour non-secular ideas, should be banned. It will end the discussion once and for all and return Turkey to what it once was: a secular state. The same thing that you forget mentioning and something that only changed the past few years. You are so blinded by triumphalism that you simply disregard this important historical fact. No matter what the people back on the countryside might have believed for the past 100 years: the public order in Turkey was mostly secular until a few years ago.
 
I don't see the Kurds voting for Erdogan by the way, especially given how he simply continued the crackdown on Kurds in Turkey. Not to mention his role in using ISIL as a tool to 'get rid' of his Kurdish question.

&gt;  It used to be a shithole and a joke. It has completely transformed and it's a serious country now.

Is this it, national pride? Elsewhere in this topic I already mentioned the dangers of charismatic leadership, and I believe I'm looking at it once again. You do not care whatever Erdogan will make of Turkey, as he was **a strong leader** with an own myth surrounding him. That type of loyalty will make you roll into a dictatorship because you simply refuse to ask the right questions, as have people like you in the past. You see this man, this great and powerful figure, that has done it all and therefore must be considered infallible. 

Given that you do not commented on Erdogan his views, I suspect that you at least share quite a few of them. I hope you do not share his latest view on women for example, otherwise I would find that highly disturbing.

Reiche zahlen mehr Steuern, weil sie mehr versteuerbares Einkommen haben und dazu zahlen sie auch einen höheren Prozentsatz an Steuern. Dass sie weniger im Verhältnis zu ihrem Nettovermögen zahlen liegt ja wohl mehr daran, dass Reiche per Definition über Nettovermögen verfügen...

Außerdem erkläre mir dochmal logisch warum es gerechter ist wenn Reiche prozentual mehr Steuern bezahlen als Leute mit weniger Einkommen? (Bitte hier nicht falsch verstehen, ich habe kein Problem mit höheren Steuersätzen aber ich finde auch den Klassenkampf ala Marx nicht richtig hier)

Arbeiter aller Länder erhebt euch? Kommst du jetzt mit Marx? Außerdem ist gerade in Deutschland es möglich zu studieren, weil wir hier eben keine Studiengebühren haben und alle meine Kommilitonen kommen soweit aus dem Mittelstand und ""knechten"" bzw. arbeiten muss keiner und München ist weiß Gott kein billiges Pflaster.

&gt;Außerdem muss der Staat durch das Immer-Reicher-Werden von 1% der Bevölkerung immer mehr sparen, was letzendlich nur der Bevölkerung schadet. Die Politiker haben ja ihre Tausenden €s im Monat und die Reichen werden parallel zur Staatsverschuldung reicher.... was für ein Zufall!

Und das Klima wird immer wärmer, weil es immer weniger Piraten es gibt!

Wo ist denn bitte der Zusammenhang zwischen dem dass die Reichen immer reicher werden und dass die Staaten immer mehr sparen müssen?

Versuchst du gerade echt es so darzustellen dass Deutschland am Bettelstock lebt? Deutschland ist eines der reichsten Länder der Welt. Deutschland belegt immer die obersten Ränge wenn du dir GDP per capita anguckst.

If Germany were a ""small"" country (like Norway), ther would be probabbly a EU max speed limit, and they would tell us, if you want to become a member in our club ypu have to accept the union-wide speed limit.

There's been a huge number of posts on this subreddit ([here's one](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/24g7e2/survey_of_9_european_countries_on_whats_morally/), as an example) that establish that there's a definite per-country bias when it comes to certain issues.

As an example, do you think the EU in 50 years would be more or less likely to enforce the legality of gay marriage at a federal level with Turkey as a member? I'd say less.

Some people would rather keep the EU smaller to reduce the source of such incohesion, there's already been a lot of disagreement relating to the Eastern &amp; Southern-European expansion.

There's reasons entirely unrelated to that why some would think Turkey joining the EU would be a bad idea, in a purely geopolitical sense it's in a much less stable area of the world, the EU would be more likely to get entangled in that as a whole if Turkey was a member.

Having said that I don't hold any particular opinion on whether Turkey should be a member, but I think you and barsoap are oversimplifying the issue thinking that it can be waived away with the notion that not all Turks think the same, or that it could be solved by more EU federalism.

false,redindh,null,null,"&gt; This gave it away for me. I already suspected you to be some kind of supporter of Erdogan, but the way you are rationalizing this course of action is in itself hypocritical. What you are basically saying here is: there should be freedom of press, but.... In this case, you insert 'not for pro-gulenists' behind it, supposedly out of your own political views. You are willing to simply cast aside the freedom the media possesses, a freedom that is vital for a country to be considered normal and above all: developed.

You willingly ignore and cautiously avoid talking mentioning that Gulen is a political opponent of Erdogan. The same political opponent that is being muzzled here. 

No one is talking about muzzling the freedom of the press here. I believe in my values unlike you. I'm talking about Gulen and his group. They are not a legitimate political force that need a voice. They are a subversive group and Turkey should do all it can to remove them systematically. You've had people secretly recording classified government meetings and leaking it to the press. This has gone beyond public good and crossed into illegality. If this was in the UK the would have all been arrested. 

Those media organisations that gave them an open space, should  have their editors arrested and any journalists involved. Just as in the UK where people got arrested for the phone hacking scandal.


&gt; Secular values supercede democratic rule, as long as the niceties of a normal state of law will be observed. And indeed, after Erdogan gets what is coming for him his party, as well as similar parties that harbour non-secular ideas, should be banned. It will end the discussion once and for all and return Turkey to what it once was: a secular state. The same thing that you forget mentioning and something that only changed the past few years. You are so blinded by triumphalism that you simply disregard this important historical fact. No matter what the people back on the countryside might have believed for the past 100 years: the public order in Turkey was mostly secular until a few years ago.

This is what I am talking about. You don't want people to be represented if they don't want secularism. Unforutently for you a lot of people in Turkey have never been sold on secularism. The reason why Turkey has been a strictly secular state was because the military was too powerful and there was deadly consequences for not toeing the line. That situation was unnatural. For those days to come back, there will have to be a severe military coup and a lot of blood. It's not going to happen.

&gt;Is this it, national pride? Elsewhere in this topic I already mentioned the dangers of charismatic leadership, and I believe I'm looking at it once again. You do not care whatever Erdogan will make of Turkey, as he was a strong leader with an own myth surrounding him.  

No, a ""strong leader"" is an authoritarian leader. I'm talking about a transformative leader that changes the face of his country so that the nation he first stepped up to rule is different from the one he stepped downs from. Thatcher for example, the UK of '79 was not the same UK she left in the early '90s. Love her or hate her she changed the country.


&gt;I don't see the Kurds voting for Erdogan by the way, especially given how he simply continued the crackdown on Kurds in Turkey. Not to mention his role in using ISIL as a tool to 'get rid' of his Kurdish question.

Yeah they do vote for him, in large numbers. There is no crackdown on Kurds. They've been given significant rights and espect in the past decade. He has also spent billions investing in Kurdish majority regions that were deprived and ignored by previous ""secular"" regimes. He's also frozen the war with the terrorist group PKK and is undergoing a peace settlement with them.

Assuming they have some troops in Donbass and they remove them, then what, restart the war? In Syria they have fought two and a half years for Aleppo, you want that kinda destruction and bloodbath for Donetsk, Gorlovka and Luhansk? Because that's the minimum it'll take to break a 20-30k strong local militia with significant local support in urban environment. Even after that, the hostilities would continue for decades.

Step 1. for Kiev if they want to end this madness is to sit on the same negotiation table with LPR/DPR and have direct negotiations with them. Eight months ago a simple federalization plan would have been easily archived if they had the political will for it then, now although distant it's still the only viable way to keep the ""territorial integrity""

It is, rather, a matter of theory, a moral question as to the character of society. It is also apparent that there are portions of most societies which appear rather uncomfortable with outsiders and consequently alternative culture. However, such discomfort is not necessary. In a cosmopolitan society, citizens are not required to adopt cultural practises that they do not enjoy, or to condone illiberal practises. Rather, it is simply the acceptance that humanity is vibrant, and that such vibrancy can exist within any society, while retaining a commitment to liberalism, and in fact enhancing that commitment.

There are probably multiple reasons. Today some have already brought up a shady Rosneft deal as one of the reasons.

Forbes: http://fortune.com/2014/12/15/the-rubles-collapse-is-disastrous-for-putin-and-bad-for-you-too/
&gt; But that is nothing compared to the egregious piece of money-printing that was agreed last week, when the central bank agreed to lend money against 625 billion rubles (still over $10 billion, even after Monday’s mayhem) of bonds freshly printed by Rosneft, the oil company headed by Putin confidant Igor Sechin. The aim is to let Rosneft hoard its export dollars and meet a $10 billion loan repayment later this month (and another $4 billion in February).
&gt;
The realization that Rosneft, one of the biggest players on the foreign exchange market, would be buying far fewer rubles with its export dollars appears to have been one of the reasons for the ruble’s drop Monday (the failure of the central bank’s half-hearted rate hike and intervention last week also being partly responsible).

Wouldn't matter if he did, Putin doesn't get elected through fair, democratic elections. /r/europe is a lovely place, they make fun of the illegitimate voting in Russia (DAE 140% approval rating) and then they blame the Russians for supporting Putin. So which one is it? 

Apparently it isn't OK to blame Germans for Hitler on reddit as he wasn't democratically elected even though support for him was riding high when Germany was still winning. And it isn't OK to blame Americans for Bush policies on reddit even though his approval ratings following 9/11 were sky-high. Reddit is so full of the ""I love Americans but not the American gov't"" and ""Nazis were bad but the regular German people were really cool"". And then on /r/europe it's usually ""Fuck Russia"" and often Russians get the same treatment on the top comment (which is why this thread is interesting to me).

Inb4 'whataboutism' accusations... I am OK with blaming the Russian people for this, provided we can agree to remove the doublestandards. Russian people are homophobes for instance, it is a problem in our society right know, I know this better and more personally than anyone here. However, /r/europe can't decide what to do, American invasions and torture are usually blamed on their gov't and not the people who (fully democratically) elected it (and with full access to free media), but Russians are usually blamed for supporting Putin when our elections aren't democratic or free, when all viable opposition was crushed through every means and when nearly every media organ of ours spouts Kremlin brainwashing. 

Putin is relatively popular in Russia because there is no viable alternative to him. Maybe things will get bad enough to where *anything* is better than Putin, but for now people are still wary. Putin's presidency saw a lot of things restored in Russia, people like that. All the media is Pro-Putin and no opposition party can manage to field a decent candidate thanks to Kremlin machinations. What do you expect Russians to do? To go sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the rest and go back to the lawlessness of the 90s? 

I don't even know what can be done now, I'm just hoping that Putin dies of cancer or something and people wake up for long enough to get someone better... Dunno if this is realistic. ",0,1418676612,null,0,false,0,cmvu7to,t3_2pdnb3,t1_cmvu7to,t1_cmvpjop,null,1425384844,34,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,34

Oil is profitable for Saudis even if it goes under $20/barrel and they have assets to last them a few years with low prices (~8 years at 80$/bbl).

They tighten their belts now, and after they cripple the shale production they can cut the oil production to raise the prices of oil. And they're again the undisputed kings of the oil market, probably even surpassing the US as #1 producer.

I've read an analysis somewhere which states that TTIP is beneficial to the EU and the US in the manner that the EU will become more dependent on American gas exports rather then Russian.

If the shale industry keeps on developing, EU, Germany included, can say ""fuck you"" to Putin, because they're safe energy-wise in the long run.

But if the US shale industry is crippled, that means EU won't decrease dependence on Russian gas anytime soon, which could lead to Brussels being more lenient towards Moscow.

&gt; arrive pas. Une nuit de merde comme j'en ai depuis une semaine.  
&gt; Je commence à comater plus profondément et ça tourne au cauchemar, je
&gt; visualise un visage en face de moi, et surtout sa mâchoire, une figure
&gt; un peu monstrueuse commence à apparaître. Me sachant en train de
&gt; comater, je commence à bouger mes orteils pour débloquer tout mon corps
&gt; et me réveiller.

&gt; droite éclate et commence à pisser le sang d'un jet que je sens sur le
&gt; palais et les dents au dessus. Je comprends que je suis dans un rêve, je
&gt; tente de me réveiller, ça fonctionne. Je sens un peu mes dents craquer,
&gt; je rebascule dans le rêve et en ressors, c'est brouillon. Au moment où

&gt;That does a great disservice to those suffering under the regimes like North Korea. Iran, where people were arrested for dancing to Pharell William's song ""Happy"". Uganda's ""Kill the Gays"" law. Don't give me that. Sudan, where the Omar al Bashir has an arrest warrant by the ICC for crimes against humanity. My family suffered under Mussolini.

Oh really?

The US is a lot worse than that. Just because it doesn't oppress its own people (whom it needs to stay ignorant of its crimes or at the very last apathetic due to complacency) doesn't make it any less the world's biggest human rights violator. The US is the most criminal, most dangerous, most destructive country on this planet. It is a rogue state that tramples on international law, tramples the human rights of others, tramples the will of the people, tramples the needs of the planet and human society, tramples the opinions of its allies.   
On a global scale.    

Nothing North Korea does, nothing Iran does, nothing Uganda does threatens global peace and freedom and human rights more than what the US does. These countries couldn't even come close to the crimes of the US even if they tried. In fact, if they tried *anything* the US does, these countries would very quickly cease to exist.

&gt;Now, I'm not trying to whitewash human rights violations by the US. 

That's exactly what you are doing, though.

&gt;You wanna talk crimes in Iraq, the torture programs, the cia scandals, I am all ears. They're a neocolonial power, with a corrupt government, trying to exert their influence on the world. [Though the president doesn't have any known mafia ties like in Italy.]

Yes. Exactly. The biggest warmongerer and human rights violator on this planet.

&gt; You don't think, them being the biggest human rights violator on the planet, it might make them upset, just a bit? 

They should be upset. They should start a revolution against their government. It's long overdue anyway.

&gt; Their military spending is extremely high and a large part of their economy depends on it.

Yes. It needs to end.


What you are doing does a great disservice to those suffering under the US regime. You are downplaying the crimes of the US by pretending that others are worse just because their populations suffer more than the US population. Guess what: They simply aren't rich enough to properly indoctrinate their people and give them a decent quality of life, thereby making them complacent. The US has a massive GDP and therefore can easily uphold the delusions of peace and prosperity within its own borders. What happens if you can't do that is what you can see in North Korea.

Seriously, what you provided is a really terrible argument and nothing but a slap in the face for all the millions of victims of US crimes. But hey, maybe you should submit your thoughts to the families of the hundreds of thousands of innocent people killed in the Iraq War. Or maybe you should tell it to the countless of people who were tortured and killed all around the world without any kind of fair trial.

The data focus on both perceptions and experiences with public sector corruption, along with the extent to which citizens believe various public sector services are impartially allocated and of good quality. The 2010 round of the projet was first funded by the EU Commission for Regional Development (REGIO). The 2013 round, funded by the EU Commission’s 7th Annual Framework Project and is included in ANTICORP, a large research consortium on anti-corruption. It is the first source of data to date that allows researchers to compare QoG within and across countries in such a multi-country context.

So which one is it? Either Russia is a shitty autocracy or the Russians are shitty people. OK, OK, as a Russian I am inclined to say both can be true, but in the context of the argument /r/europe has to pick one.

Otherwise it just looks like /r/europe is only interested in floating whatever crap that makes Russia&amp;Russians look bad, which really is the only recurring theme I see.

Comment peut-on répondre à l'UE après cela ?

Je me suis franchement posé la question... Devons-nous donc nous limiter d'avoir une opinion sur ce traité et ses conséquences sur notre mode de vie vu que c'est seulement en cours de négotiations ? Soit.

Parce que c'est en négotiations que le peuple n'a pas à faire d'Initiative Citoyenne Européenne ? et elle reçoit une fin de non recevoir ? Les citoyens n'ont-ils donc pas le droit (et le moyen) de penser, s'alarmer et alerter les dirigeants ?

Par contre, discuter **dans les hautes-sphères en cachette** d'accords de ce traité trans-atlantique n'est pas une raison pour lui donner une fin de non recevoir ?

Désolé mais pour moi, cela est un pur vol de **démocratie** (""gouvernement du peuple, par le peuple, pour le peuple""). Elle est belle notre *Eurocratie* : gouvernement du peuple, par les lobbies, pour le profit.

https://college.harvard.edu/college-events/elson-lecture-jacques-attali-french-economist

Il a été classé parmi les 100 plus grands intellectuels actuellement vivant sur notre planète par Foreign Policy. Il rencontre régulièrement tous les hommes politiques français, Francois Hollande, mais aussi bien d'autres (Pierre Moscovici, commissaire européen). Il organise des soirées a Paris ou on croise des musiciens de jazz, des clowns, des artistes tres etranges, mais aussi Nathalie Kosucko Morizet, Jean Claude Trichet, des grands patrons, des grands universitaires ou encore le fondateur de Microsoft.

Cet homme livre des analyses souvent brillantissimes, notamment sur la crise, le capitalisme, ou l'humanité, mais aussi parfois terrifiantes (l'euthanasie, la mort de la France, gouvernement mondial).

On se demande juste pour qui il roule. Et c'est ça qui m’inquiète le plus. Est ce qu'il roule pour lui même (banquier d'affaire), pour le peuple juif (dans son ensemble), pour les élites françaises, pour les élites occidentales néo-libérales, ou encore pour l'humanité toute entière?

I've spent some time on Reddit - not that much - but it seems like there's a lot of people asking for help from others.  I'm a computer person and recently someone was asking for advice about their website and I spent a good 20-30 minutes reviewing it and making suggestions - and then responded to some follow-up questions.  I also spent time responding to people who were asking for advice and were starting their own business (I've had my own businesses for 35 years now).  Maybe that was dopey of me and I should have told them that they were asking for free consulting and here are my hourly rates.  I guess I'm not quite certain where the line is between asking something unreasonable and asking for some help/advice from the Reddit community.  It seemed as if my request was in the reasonable category and wouldn't take more than 5 minutes to review the invoice and comment.

Given that bribes occur illicitly, however, a specific figure can only ever be approximate, and it excludes other corrupt transactions such as the embezzlement of public funds or theft of public assets, or non-monetary bribes such as favours, services and gifts. Analyses which focus on the movement of money also ignore the social costs of corruption, which are impossible to quantify. No one knows how much the loss of a talented entrepreneur or an acclaimed scientist costs a country. Who can say what social malaise, illiteracy, inadequate medical care or means in economic terms?

There is a freeze on the border with YPG/PKK because they are a terrorist organisation. Syrian Kurdish civilians however are allowed to freely cross into and out of the border. Armed fighters aren't.

I don't mind translating for free for friends or for charities, or working out special deals for people who would like my services but couldn't otherwise afford them, like grad students.  I enjoy mentoring other people in my field, and think that that is a necessary part of anyone's job.  However, you're in a position where you're set to potentially make a ton of money off of the translator's work, and you'll likely never post in this forum again (and therefore have no knowledge to pass on to anyone else here).  Why wouldn't the translator/ editor want to be paid for their work?  If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys, as you've seen by hiring this online service that sent you a translation with typos.  You're not even offering a peanut here and I still pointed out that there were some problems, which is more than anyone has to do.  Maybe someone else here will correct the translation; maybe they won't.

Unternehmen zahlen nicht grundlos überdurchschnittliche Gehälter, sondern tun es, weil es für sie rentabel ist. Wären die Gehälter unangemessen, so würde das Unternehmen schnell insolvent gehen. 

Was aber ein Problem darstellen könnte, und das ist ein guter Punkt, ist die Alternativlosigkeit. Es könnte für die Unternehmen rentabler sein, weniger Gehalt zu zahlen, wenn sie die gleiche Leistung (bzw. Erfahrung) dafür erhalten würden. Dies passiert aber nicht, weil es für die meisten Menschen schwer ist, überhaupt erst in die Lage zu kommen, solch eine Stellung zu erreichen. Habe ich dies richtig verstanden?

But reddit is different. Reddit is full of Nazi apologism, racism and eugenics and warhawks. Reddit perpetuates the myth of the clean Wehrmacht. Reddit likes to engage in a creepy obsession with Nazi military. Reddit does a lot of things Germans generally don't do. You can see all this for yourself by checking the vote totals on comments. 

Reddit will say that Soviets were bloodthirsty raping beasts and that Germans were the le glorious masterrace, conveniently ignoring that Germans raped ten times the Russians and then killed around 30mil, of which only around a quarter or so were military deaths. What happened on the Eastern front is irrelevant. Reddit will sometimes even use the bombings of Germany and say that it's all 'grey' and that there were 'no good guys' and that 'German and Allied war crimes were both bad'. Which is incredibly offensive to many people and most of all, actual historians.

&gt; En 1982, Jacques Attali s'est fait prendre la main dans le sac du vieux Jünger. Certains passages de l'«Essai sur le temps» de l'écrivain allemand ont été purement et simplement recopiés dans les «Histoires du temps». Et les journalistes enquêteurs de l'époque avaient également remarqué des démarquages tout aussi peu discrets de textes de Jacques Le Goff ou de Jean-Pierre Vernant. Après une tentative d'explication très médiatisée, Jacques Attali lâcha avec un bel aplomb: «Je ne compte pas mes emprunts, je les pèse.»

false,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; What you call ""free trade"" between two regions is always beneficial only to one of the four involved parties: There's the populations of the two regions, and the capitalist elite of the two regions. What you call ""free trade"" is beneficial to only one of the two capitalist elites. It is detrimental the other three parties. So, be careful what you wish for.

So you say. Can't help noticing that your theory is coloured by your political ideology though, which I don't share. 

&gt; The UK would simply go under if strong trade restrictions would be put into place. And these restrictions should and *will* be used as a credible threat in case the UK political elite ever even seriously considers giving their people a referendum (protip: they will not)

Referendums have to be granted if there is sufficient support for the idea behind them in the general populace. ""The elite"" as you term it, loses any control of the situation if they fail to respond to popular demand. Thats the problem with living in a demicracy, you see, people can want ""inconvenient"" changes, like universal health care, unions, state pensions, or their own country.

Also, the mere *fact* that you think trade restrictions being used as a threat is fine is all the more reason to leave, in my eyes. I would rather live in a freer but poorer country, than one that lives under constant threat from people that claim to be its ""friends"".

&gt; We call that Continental Europe. Funny though, we don't have that kind of silly hateful language for the UK. 

Whats silly is that you think that that language is hateful. Its the same language that was used during the Scottish referendum to refer to the UK after Scotland broke away - rUK. There is no hate implied at all.

I also find your assertion that the continentals don't use hateful language to refer to the UK to be disingenuous. Just look around this subreddit - even in the other comments against this article - the amount if pure, unfiltered hatred directed at us is jaw-dropping, and was a big factor in my decision to vote to leave the EU. I don't want to be in the same country as people that hate me, merely because I don't share their language or their outlook.

&gt; We mostly just shake our heads at how the UK capitalist elite keeps getting away with robbing the population blind.

&gt;Uh... yes... because that is exactly what the EU is about, and if the poll I mentioned is accurate it's incredibly hypocritical to expect benefits from european rules about movement within the EU, without in return offering other EU members the same thing. Honestly if you don't get that I'm going to think you're a bit slow.

It's a silly thing to compare polls on. 

Unless the figures are identical then you're getting the inverse that people think they shouldn't be allowed to leave their own country but people from other EU members should be allowed to move to theirs.

The UK would reconsider them but there's clearly no the appetite from the public for it. Why would they reconsider their Schengen opt-out when it's debatable if they'll even be in the EU?

Damn right I can compare you to the Nazis. I say you might even be worse then them. You will probably not read what i'm about to write but I'll write it down anyway.

When the soviets occupied my country in 1940 before they were even at war with anyone, they came in here with their soldiers started raping the local women, beating up men and boys to the point of death and sending people to siberia for simple reasons like ""I like your house I will move in here with my russian family and you and your family will go live in a gulag in siberia"" They took all of our potatoes, grain, meat products etc and transported them to russia leaving us to the point of near famine. They knew nothing of hygiene and would not think it is bad to take a shit in a middle of a street and not clean it afterwards. 

Then the Nazis came, they kind of treated us almost as equals yet forced us into their army and made us kill all of our jews (we had a lot of them) but other than that they did no harm to us, they even gave children chocolates and other expensive exotic sweets that you just couldnt get before for washing their car or something like that. They didn't rape any women ( I know they did in other countries and maybe somewhere else in my country but not my town) and they were clean and organised. They only burned down one village in my entire country and it was only because the villagers killed a lot of german soldiers and refused to give up the killer to them.

Then the russians came back and it was hardly a ""liberation"" There were more rapes, more killings, more banishments to gulags a shitton of towns were burnt to the ground because stalin said so and this went on until the 70s or something, then we just lived in a very poverty stricken, backwards country with no freedom of speech.

If you're saying ""Scandinavian family"" you're referring to the regional grouping of Scandinavia, which includes things from Finland to Iceland to the Faroe Islands.

So your reasoning for saying Denmark owns Greenland is because random people say ""Greenland is just little Denmark"" Let's get Sweden and Norway in there, then, too.

Also, calling a region a Federal State or Constitutional Monarchy? It's not one or the other, that's not how political science works. They're both. Greenland is Greenland and a member of the Denmark Constitutional Monarchy. But that's not what you said. You said a Denmark owns Greenland, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the Danish Crown Denmark, which means you'd call the Faroe Islands Denmark, too.

In general, of the three ""unknowns"" for the EU, namely Belarus, Ukraine and Turkey, I don't think any of them should be given full membership. 

To be brutally (and admittedly rudely) honest: 
Belarus can't get in while it's dictatorship and if it ever stops being one it will take 20 to 40 years to be in economic position to enter (unscientific estimate based on fall of communism/dissolution of Yugoslavia and entrance to the EU of those countries), 

Ukraine is too large, too poor, too divided and too close to Russia to be let in (though, I would personally love to see Ukraine as EU member as I have great fondness for the country) and 

Turkey is too populous (almost the same population as Germany, if Turkey were to enter it would completely change the balance of power from the current UK-France-Germany with Germany leading), too Asian and, frankly, too muslim to be let in. I don't think anyone in the EU is excited by the idea of accepting ~75,000,000 muslims in. 

Instead, I think all three should get some sort of arrangement similar to what the Norway and Switzerland have with close economic ties and relatively few obstacles but, obviously, with more more limitations than those two due to their relative lack of prosperity. 

Also it would be in EU's interest, in my opinion, to keep Belarus, Ukraine and Turkey close and tied to itself while not giving them full membership as, in that scenario, they would serve as a modern day version of medieval marches that guard the border sections of the country, in this case federation, from more hostile territories outside, specifically Russia and the general mess that is the Middle East. In addition to those three, it would probably be well in EU's interest to establish strong, wealthy, stable and pro-western countries in North Africa and levant to serve as the buffer zone against political instability, crime and illigal immigration.",0,1418687990,null,0,1418688973,0,cmw0qml,t3_2pdbqu,t1_cmw0qml,t1_cmvtqln,null,1425381801,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

* Siegburg has a ~1000 year old monastery, with quite some history - I'm not sure how it is used now, also a pretty old city hall with a former witch torture chamber I think, something along those lines

* Niederkassel (or some town next to it) has a rhine fishery museum, I think you could actually walk along the Sieg (small river) up to Siegburg

* Blankenberg has a very old inner city on a hill further up the Sieg or at the Agger (another small river), it was at some time the smallest city ever granted city rights, not sure if it still is.

* Cologne - as a kid I took a guided tour through the old ""sewers"" that aren't used anymore and some undergound, was pretty low key compared to many other tourist attractions

* Wahner Heide (a nature reservation) can be entered from Troisdorf, no attractions or anything there, but might be interesting for a walk

* Bonn Rheinauen - a park like area right next to the rhine

* Dechenhöhle (that's actually about 2 hours away) pretty big cave...~800m long, ~350m open for the public

There are probably lots of little things everywhere I don't know or care about to think of now - I think there's little christian shrines scattered all over the area...some people love them and hike along a route connecting them. I couldn't tell you where that starts/ends though, I just heard about it and seen some.

I'd also advise to at least visit one of the museums in the area, there are a few of the best ones in Germany here, but I understand not being into that.

Maybe call/mail tourist info of some cities here and ask for the less prominent attractions, too. If you're local like me you don't always consider something interesting because it was always around you, but someone from far away might love it - you get the idea.

Cities that might have interesting stuff, except cologne/bonn but (very) close: Troisdorf, Siegburg, Niederkassel, Rösrath, Lohmar, Königswinter, Düsseldorf, Bergisch Gladbach, Bad Neuenahr (casino, but I wouldn't advice anybody to gamble), Bergheim, Leverkusen, Wuppertal...

false,VernierCalliper,SILE,Lower Silesia,"Well, actually we can compare Nazi Germany to USSR.
Let's start with dispelling the lie of the liberation in 1945. Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was signed on 23 August 1939. Officially it was non-aggression treaty between USSR and Germany. Unofficially it also described shape of the German-Russian borders after partition of the Central Europe in the case of ""hypothetical"" war in the region. Soviet army crossed Polish borders 17th of September 1939, as an Germany's ally. Putting it plainly Soviet army was a part of Nazi invasion. USSR joined the Allies only after German invasion on the Eastern Front in 1941. Fighting a unexpectedly common enemy and former ally is hardly a liberation.
As to the argument, that Hitler planned to kill all the Slavs, it's also false. Before the World War II Hitler didn't care about the Slavs. His real desire was to conquer Western Europe, but couldn't find a reason to declare the war since Great Britain and France caved to all his demands. It's equally bad, I grant you. Just wanted to point this out before noting, that conquest of al the Slavic nations was Soviet agenda from the very beginning of USSR's existence. In 1920 Soviet army invaded Poland and almost reached Warsaw. Fortunately they lost.
There is also the matter of the Holocaust. It's true Nazis killed six million Jews. And also Poles, French, Norwegians, homosexuals, Gypsies, mentally handicapped, Jehovah's Witnesses, people with clinical depression and many more they deemed undesirable. Over eleven million civilian lives in total. But it has to be said, that Russians weren't any better. I won't mention Stalinist purges in the 1930's, where around 30 million were killed. Those were Russians killing other Russians after all. But lets take the Great Hunger (Holodomor) in Ukraine, country forcefully incorporated into USSR. Over 7 million people died of starvation because of forced collectivization, done on Stalin's orders. And it wasn't even at the time of war, it was 1932-33. This is only one example of many. Are you going to say those death were less morally wrong than Jews killed in gas chambers? Soviet ""liberation"" was just a great wave of rape, pillage and slaughter done under the pretence of bringing peace and freedom.
There are numerous accounts of survivors of both Nazi and Soviet regimes saying, that what NKVD did to them was actually worse than anything by Gestapo.
Russian march on Berlin during World War II was the biggest mass rape in the history of Europe, and dare I say, World.
And while we're at it, how do you explain the Katyn massacre? How do you explain murder by the shot to the back of the head of 22 thousands of civilians of the country you are claiming to be liberating? And not just any civilians, but army officers, doctors, lawyers, teachers, scientists, policemen, priests - people that could help maintain the order and rebuild society after the war. There is, literally, Stalin's signature under the order to do so. And the date, 3 April 1940.

Jews, Slavs, Gypsies, gays, etc. Then they enslaved the countries in a communist order. Baltic countries had the worst experience, Germans treated them OK-ish, even though they planned to exterminate the Balts as well (a fact which many of you don't seem to appreciate). The German plan for the Baltics was to deport and eventually kill 2/3 and then enslave the 1/3, possibly weeding out a few blonde, blue eyed Balts for Germanisation. 

Same plan for Slavs, except 2/3 were to be killed right away and the rest enslaved. 

Jews didn't even have that luxury, all would perish. 

That's why I take offense with the other Lithuanian here saying how Nazis were better than Soviets. My own town of Berlintsi in Moldova was massacred, most of us were Jews. My mother was Jewish via my grandmother, she survived because my grandfather was a butcher who supplied the German troops (read: they stole all his cattle). Most Jews did not survive, Romanians and Germans shot them up in front of our village bathhouse. Our village was made up of German expats, hence the name Little Berlin. My grandmother's maiden name was Shvera, she was of German-Jewish descent. 

When Soviets came in, we got schools, roads, public facilities, scholarships to Unis, propserity, our famines ended after the early 50s, we got justice so that Romanians no longer killed our men and got away with it as it happened in the early 1900s.

 - is will of people enough to secede now? I thought Chechenia wanted to be independent a few times?

 - The people of Crimea have been seeking a return to Russia for the last 23 years - some of them. Tatars weren't. 

 - Crimeans held a referendum and voted to secede and rejoin Russia - elections were watched by Russian army, after mass brainwashing campaign calling all Ukrainians - nazis

 - In the east, Russia advised Kiev to adopt federalization and regional autonomy - funny that Russia won't take their own advice rgarding Siberia or Kaliningrad :)

 - Kiev's response was to start a war against the east - yeah, how could they respond to army enetring their territory. Russia would never do sth like that - killing people that wanted to secede from your country? Outrage! Chechenia was totally different matter after all.

 - Under the guise of a ""War on Terror"", Kiev targeted the entire population, men, women and children -- that's aggression. More than that, it's genocide - no proofs of that, meanwhile Russian army and rebels shoot from civilian buildings, shot down civilian passanger plane, and use martial law in the territory they control - sentencing people to death without court

Sorry but these arguments are bullshit, just like the tales Putin told about green men in Crimea that ""weren't Russian soldiers"", and ""got weapons in military surpluss stores"".

So why do the majority of Russians disagree with you, then?

First, disagreement is not a crime.  Nor is it a proof of Inherent Inferiority or Subhuman Nature or Totalitarian Mentality.  

You seem to be Absolutely Certain that you know more than Primitive Russians -- that you are Right and they are Wrong.  This certainty is a hallmark of a religious True Believer.  The only way to attain such certainty is to read from a script.

Russians have access to their own media and also to the BBC and the NATO-bloc media and get to see more than one side.  Is it possible that they are seeing something that you do not see?

Nobody cares about that foreign and silly mythology. One can of course find a handful of skinheaded nutjobs, but that'd be a venture far into the outskirts of the society. 

&gt; Check out the Lithuanian here replying to me how Nazis were much better than the Soviets...

As far as the scale of crimes against local population is concerned, that's certainly true. During the first Soviet occupation (1940-1941), 13 500 Estonians lost their lives, and that grew by 11 000 between the beginning of the second Soviet occupation (1944-1991) up until Stalin's death (1953), bringing the total to 24 500, with tens of thousands more deported to labor camps to [inhumane conditions](http://proof.nationalgeographic.com/2014/01/06/russians-adapt-to-a-freezing-dark-and-polluted-place/).

Though we have been lied to over and over again, we treat every word uttered by the Establishment as Gospel.  In the area of foreign affairs, the Government is God.

So we have a contest -- ""God"" on one side, and a Demon named ""Putin"" on the other side.  Who should we cheer for?  ""God"", obviously.

Our cheering takes the form of intensification.  We feel an urge to demonize Putin and demonize Russia.  We project all of the evil in our own Empire onto Putin and Russia.  Putin, in our eyes, becomes a ""Dictator"" (forget that his popularity is twice Obama's!).  Then he becomes ""Hitler"".  Then he becomes a ""Worse than Hitler"".  He becomes ""Hitler Plus Stalin Plus Ghengis Khan, Attila the Hun, and Jack the Ripper"".  Russia, in our eyes, becomes a Totalitarian Police State inhabited by Mindless Zombies, where people who refuse to worship Putin are shipped to the Gulag.

&gt; The danger of outright war between the two nuclear powers is actually much greater than during the Cold War. We are now in a sort of Frozen War, because nothing the Russians say or do can have any effect.

&gt; Yeah, Turkey doesn't want to be a part of EU anymore. The process is more of an act nowadays.

&gt; But in the old days when Erdoğan was nothing, there were a lot of pro-EU parties in Turkey and they had a big support. When EU made it clear that it was almost impossible for Turkey to join EU, those pro-EU parties started to lose power and fall. Around those times, AKP was born.

&gt; You can ask any old Turk and they'll confirm the EU craze in Turkey where every aspect of society was influenced to adapt to EU standards better.

Nowadays only %17 of the population support the accession according to a poll in 2012, compare it to the %74 of the population supporting it in 2005.

About how the U-turn, again, I have written [a comprehensive analysis](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2ndacr/women_not_equal_to_men_erdogan_claiming_it_is/cmcx42d) about how AKP is getting this many votes. Check it out.

TL;DR: Just read the example below and think about millions of people like him:

&gt;  I read in the papers about a guy with cheap shoes made of rubber. His son has just died in a coal mine accident. His shoes were absolutely ruined. I wonder how can anyone walk without bleeding their foot off like that. Anyway, the government intervened and provided him... a new pair of shiny cheap rubber shoes. Probably at the cost of like 5 dollars or something. Don't let them starve, but don't feed them too much either. There is a video of it.

&gt; And he is actually thankful to the government. Imagine your kid dying after a mining accident because of the government and you being grateful for the government buying you a pair of 5 dollar shoe. Oh, and people keep on mining in Soma, if you think the company actually got any punishment or anything.

The Turkish redditor /u/bishey3 is absolutely right about how AKP keeps people between in starvation and barely fed situation, so they can send voters aid just before the elections to appear as their savior.

A democratic nation with an ignorant and uneducated population is the breeding grounds for sneaky dictators.

&gt; Sadly, at the moment there are not enough capable officers left to stage a coup

Yep, Erdoğan already replaced the higher ranks in military with his Islamist palls. Too late for that.

And my ex-leftist father would probably have a heart attack if we go back to USA-backed military coup era with the military dishing out torture against all communists and socialists.

At this stage, a military coup would end up with giving birth to more potential dictators.

&gt; The EU should break most diplomatic ties with Turkey to send a clear signal for once; hopefully it will result in some kind of public response in Turkey.

Turks used to support EU ascension with polls showing at least %70 support for it, now it's around %20. Turks are really tired with EU constantly changing requirements for joining and people steadily started to become more anti-EU. Pro-EU parties started to lose power and those were the times when AKP was born.

Even secular Turks don't care about EU anymore, really.

So that will only further increase the ""Europeans wants us dead"" mindset and xenophobia among Turks. And Erdoğan will be able to use it to spread his toxic rhetoric in a ""Pesky Westerners hate you, so it's only logical for me to turn further into a Middle East dictator and logical for you to keep supporting me"" way.

Erdoğan will keep getting more autocratic as long as he has the support of the people. He doesn't care about EU. He would burn the whole country to the ground if it would benefit him. Yeah, we protest every now and then (like in Gezi) but the apolitical uneducated ignorant people (who makes up most of his voter-base) will only react if their quality of life decreases drastically.

Many people say he should have been more radical doing the reforms, but then they forget several factors:

1. Ukraine is a parliament-presidential republic and the President has very little power (as compared to the Russian president, for example). Most of the executive power is in the hands of PM (Yatseniuk).
2. The whole governance system is extremely corrupt and if he started with some radical actions it could blow up in his face and he could lose control. I don't rule out assassination attempts. Slow but steady progress and reforms is what is better for the situation in my opinion.

Many people say he should have been more active in fighting with Russia, but then they forget that Russia is a much larger military power and is able to counter any attempt to escalate the conflict. In the end of August Russia countered most of the Ukrainian military successes with direct invasion, leading to thousands of Ukrainian soldiers MIA, KIA, WIA. This is often forgotten.

I say that the current process - peace in the east and Crimea, pressure on political elites in Ukraine to go on with reforms and pressure on Russian economy - is what will lead to the stronger Ukraine and as a result - much stronger EU in 5 years.

Poroshenko and Yatseniuk should not be viewed as those who will stay forever. I see much more promising political parties like Samopomich (Self-reliance) coming up and what they are doing right now is much more likeable.

They want welfare improvements and welfare did improve under him (he had a lot of help with oil and other natural resource prices but he did do some of it himself). However, welfare would have improved a lot more had not the lions share of the gains and the economic structuring gone to enrich his biggest supporters.

They want Russia to be powerful and influential. Putin made dramatic public statements, increased regional influence, took Crimea (the way he took it was messed up but it is Russian so many didn't care) and, and, when things weren't going his way, manufactured entire crises a la fascist ethnic cleansing junta to explain away his failures and increase domestic concern. 

He also created an outside enemy. The US and Western Europe were to a certain degree degree true rivals with Russia, but he created a narrative where they were fully out to get Russia. This makes people feel they need to support him against outside trouble while providing a handy scapegoat for any internal failures that might otherwise be attributed to him and his system. All helpful - he destroys, coopts, discredits or sidelines any potential alternative leaders before people support them. 

It doesn't help that Yeltsin and the 90s were so terrible - with only Yeltsin and the stagnating USSR in living memory, Putin is judged against a pretty low standard of what makes a good leader and information from the West is more deeply mistrusted (the 90s crash is blamed on the West - people expected great things and got an alcoholic president, the mob wars and years of economic disintegration).

&gt; Now Russia is heading into a recession with no less than whopping 17% 

[Holy. Fucking. Shit. I've made some dire predictions on the state of Russia's economy. And for the most part I've been more or less on the mark.](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2nnber/russia_facing_further_economic_tumble_as_opec/cmf496k) **But never in a million years would I have guessed the central bank would increase the interest rate to 17%** -- an overnight increase of 650 basis points is unheard of. 


**For Comparison:**

^The ^current ^interest ^rate ^is ^the ^rate ^at ^which ^banks ^can ^borrow ^money ^from ^the ^central ^bank. ^The ^interest ^rates ^are ^used ^by ^central ^banks ^to ^shape ^monetary ^policy. 

Bank | CB Interest Rate
---|---
United States | 0.250%
Great Britain | 0.500%
European Central Bank | 0.050%
Sweden | 0.000%
Canadian | 1.000%


Russian only recently increased their interest rate to 10.5%. This increase to 17% shows you just how desperate they are. It now, more than ever, seems obvious how little foreign reserve they *actually have*. Having already spent tens, if not hundreds, of billions trying to stabilize the currency I'm starting to think they're running dry. Maybe Russian Oligarchs have been using the fund as a personal piggy bank.


[**Russia's foreign-exchange reserves: What's really there?**](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2014/12/russias-foreign-exchange-reserves)

&gt;According to the central-bank website, in November Russia had $419 billion-worth of reserves. Even after this year’s drop, only a handful of countries have bigger reserves than Russia.

--

&gt;“In reality”, says Anders Aslund of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think-tank, “Russia’s effective international reserves are only $203 billion.”


But this recent move to stem the tide, and prevent the need for further capital injection, presents an *even gloomier* image. It is anyones guess as to how much reserve they actually have. I'm guessing *very very* little. 


--

&gt;About $170 billion of its assets sit in two big wealth funds, the Reserve Fund (worth about $89 billion) and the National Wealth Fund (worth about $82 billion).

--

&gt;The economy may shrink 4.5 percent to 4.7 percent next year[.]

Previous predictions -- by the same bank -- went from: no growth this year and limited growth over next three years; possible 0.5% contraction to stability over the next year; and now they are saying possible contraction by 4.5-4.7%. Conservatively you can add 50% -- in line with the velocity (1^st / 2^nd derivative -- the rate of change / the change in the rate of change) of the money supply -- to *any official estimate*.  

--

[**From my Above Post**]


&gt; [Additionally the rouble closely tracks the oil price](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2014/11/articles/body/20141122_FBC287.png): 30 roubles per dollar at the start of 2014, now 45-50 roubles per dollar. So we can expect the fall... [in oil price]...  to put the rouble at 55-70 roubles per dollar. 

--

&gt;In either case this hurts the Russian economy more as a [majority of their budget comes from oil exports](http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=17231) (I did some quick n' dirty math and it looks like a **loss of 50-100b USD per year; or 25-33% of their budget.**). This is going to deepen their deficit as sanctions [""...cover not only technological equipment, but also oil services, such as construction, repairs, and drilling preparation and exploration in new oilfields.""](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30217070) 

So they've lost *at least* 100b -- but with the contraction, inability to borrow (to finance new oil ventures, etc) that figure is ***at least* at 150b USD per year. From a budget of 414b.** 


**They're fucked.**

false,Index7744,UKRA,Ukraine,"Sarcasm aside, the Rurik dynasty (Kievan Rus) settled Northern Russia and Belarus before they even reached Ukraine. They're called 'Kievan' because Kiev was about as far south as they settled, and Kiev became one of the most successful cities in europe during the 10-11th century. However, the official name for the Kievan Rus is the 'Rurik dynasty'. In this case, Russians are correct when they attribute their identity to the 'Rurik dynasty' because the identity originated in the north and the larger part of it existed in Russia.

After the destruction of Kiev in 1240, descendants of the dynasty re-united Ukrainian territory under Galicia - Volhynia and it was very successful again. However, nearing 1350, the Polish state and the Lithuanian Duchy initiated an invasion campaign to take Galicia - Volhynia which they eventually succeeded. By 1400, North, Central Ukraine was controlled by the Lithuanian Duchy and the west was controlled by the polish state. The south was under the influence of the Crimean Khanate. Under this time period, Ukraine (especially the west) underwent a period of cultural and political 'polinisation' as well as serfdom. Many places were renamed according to Polish names, and Catholicism was promoted, while the Orthodox religion was supressed. Still to this day, you will notice that less than 6% in Ukraine are catholic, and this is because many of the Ukrainians hated the polish and resisted their reign. The continued harsh enserfment of peasantry by Polish nobility and especially the suppression of the Orthodox Church alienated Ukrainians. Throughout this time period, Ukrainians were living as peasants and slaves of the Polish - Lithuanian commonwealth while suffering raids from the southern Crimean Khanate. 

Despite Polish - Lithuanian denomination in Ukraine, neither of these groups held Ukrainian ancestry. The REAL Ukrainians during this time formed the 'Zaporizhian Host (Cossacks)', and revolted against the Polish, Jewish, Lithuanian, and Crimean Khanate for their own identity. Completely encircled and enslaved, these are the Ukrainians that fought to the death for their freedom! And the only ones to come to their aid was their long lost relative, Russia. Side by side they fought for 30 years against their enemies in 'The Ruin' to set the path for a sovereign nation. By the end of the 1700s, Polish - Lithuanian control was non-existent and the Crimean Khanate was annihilated. Although, Polish and Lithuanian culture had an important place in Ukrainian history, they had their own identity seperate from either. The path was set for a sovereign nation, and it was recognized as an independant state for the first time in 1764. Hopefully, you know the rest. The problem is, no one gives a damn about history anymore.

This is why the south stream was originally conceived, to bypass Ukraine and secure gas into Europe, which paid its bills and was growing trade with Russia.. this would have made Ukraine a simple buffer zone, with nothing to add to the world except been a money pit, or a US military base for weapon/missles ""shields""..

Then shale raised its ugly head in Ukraine large deposits at a reasonable price compared to Russian supplies, and then massive oil deposits in the black and Azov sea.. by shell, Chevron and exxon.. 50yrs contracts were written, so that Ukraine only gets 10% of its gas and 10% of its oil, the rest is profits for the oil companies..

the south stream became a point of contention, because all that oil and gas could have been shipped to Europe from Ukraine using the pipe system already in place in Ukraine, totally cutting out the Russian supply.. 

and then 1yr later all hell breaks loose in Kiev and the pro Russian party fails, and a pro US party takes its place, 

Only crimea wanted secession and the East didnt want to be ruled by Kiev.. access to the asov, and the black sea becomes difficult for the oil companies and all hell breaks out as poroshenko tries to claim the East in the name of the CIA, US oil companies and Washington...but its not working out, 

All the while the US are offering LNG to the EU to replace Russian gas at cheaper prices, still much higher than US prices and selling this LNG to the EU means prices at home can be subsidised and profits made, so all the EU have to do is push through TTIP and that cheap gas is theirs....

BUT Russia didnt play along, and now the saudis, have played a hand.. and the EU need a secure supply of gas from Russia once again.. yup its all a clusterfuck, the past few decades of Ukrainian syphoning and theft is not as relevant as the current US, TTIP, Chevron, Exxon and massive cheap deposits under the azov and Black seas. imho

[I found this article which makes it clear American money has been used to fund the purchase of arms for the IRA but it was all private donations and certainly not sanctioned by the US government.](http://www.csmonitor.com/1985/0114/anor1.html)

[This source states that the US government actually actively worked against Noraid, the organization collecting private donations in the US, which was using the donation money to purchase arms. The US government enforced a visa denial policy, among other things, that prevented suspected IRA members from traveling to the US.](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/wilson95.htm#chap9)

Further reading which indicates private aid was given through Noraid but that ultimately the US government actively worked against Noraid and the IRA:

[NY Times article, private citizen supports IRA.](http://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/14/world/a-new-yorker-backing-ira-s-armed-struggle.html)

[BBC News, mentions ""US-backed newspaper adverts"" as supporting the IRA cause but the context clearly indicates ""US-backed"" means private citizens and that the government was working with British officials to dampen support for the IRA.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/northern_ireland/latest_news/77699.stm)

[An archive of Noraid's site, ""Irish Northern Aid is an American based membership organization that supports through peaceful means, the establishment of a democratic 32-county Ireland."" Although peaceful means clearly were not the goal, this is what was advertised. It's clear that many supporters of Noraid were aware of the support of violence by the organization, evidenced in my previously linked articles, but it's impossible to say that all were aware of the malicious intent of the organization.](http://web.archive.org/web/20071022052300/http://inac.org/mission)

Penso che entrambi ti risponderebbero che potrebbero benissimo fare quello che fanno senza laurea, ma che sicuramente studiare filosofia è stata un'esperienza molto interessante.

Anche mia madre è laureata in filosofia: avendo fatto una tesi su freud (in un epoca in cui non esisteva ancora psicologia), questo le ha permesso di specializzarsi in traduzioni tecniche nell'ambito della psicoanalisi.

Di nuovo il titolo di studio non è stato utile di per sé come foglio di carta, però almeno in questo caso ha fornito un certo valore aggiunto alla sua conoscenza approfondita delle lingue.

Penso che uno possa studiare un po' quello che gli interessa, a parte alcune facoltà che sono direttamente professionalizzanti (medicina, giurisprudenza…) ci si può sempre riciclare. A volte sono le passioni che uno coltiva all'interno di un corso di studi che informano le proprie scelte: il malefico Steve Jobs sosteneva che aver seguito dei corsi di calligrafia dopo aver mollato l'università era stato fondamentale quando si era trattato di decidere l'importanza della tipografia per il Macintosh. È per questo che nel mondo della grafica i mac sono sempre stati più diffusi dei PC, per questo vantaggio iniziale sul trattamento dei caratteri tipografici.

false,Krawall2,null,null,"&gt;Mal eine ernstgemeinte Frage an alle User hier, die Pegida unterstützen: glaubt ihr den Scheiß eigentlich selbst, den ihr der Öffentlichkeit da vorbetet?

Natürlich nicht. Die meisten Menschen dort haben so die Fresse voll von Medien, Politik, aufgezwungenen Ideologie wie dem Genderwahn, staatlicher Propaganda, von dem ständigen Ignorieren des Volkswillens usw. 

Auch sorgen die Beschimpfungen der Politiker, was man sich im Übrigen mal vorstellen muss, da werden Demonstranten, der Souverän, von Politikern beschimpft, dafür, dass dort immer mehr Zulauf stattfindet.

Auch machen sich die Medien hochgradig lächerlich wenn sie denen rechtes oder menschverachtendes Gedankengut unterstellen, während sie dem Özdemir zujubeln, der auf der Gegendemo redet.

In den Worten Roland Tichys:

&gt;Cem Özdemir, der Grünen-Chef, beschimpft diese aus seiner Sicht so minderbemittelten Demonstranten in Dresden pauschal als „Mischpoke“. Nun ja, das Wort kommt aus dem jiddischen und bezeichnet Familie, Gemeinschaft, Bande und wird in Deutschland abwertend für jüdische Familien gebraucht. Schon bezeichnend, dass der Grünen-Chef sich aus der Sprachkammer des Nationalsozialismus bedient, um Menschen zu entwerten, die nicht seines Glaubens sind. Man sieht förmlich seine Koteletten zittern, wenn jemand seine Bande mit diesem von den Nazis so infam benutzten Begriffen belegt hätte. Aber das ist ein Seitenast – und doch ein Hauptast.

Zudem sind die Grünen für Waffenlieferungen, haben die Deutschen in den ersten und zweiten illegalen Angriffskrieg seit des 2. Weltkrieges geführt, unterstützen offen Faschisten und betreiben massive Kriegshetze.

So was nehmen die Medien nie auf, nicht einmal in einem Absatz wird darauf eingegangen, denn die Grünen gehören ja zu den Guten^^TM .

Das ist es auch, was die meisten hier auf Reddit überhaupt nicht verstehen. Die meinen zu den Demonstranten ""Wie kann man nur so doof sein?"" Sehen aber selber nicht den doppelten Standard dem sie da anhängen. 

Die Linksgrünen verkennen völlig das Problem welches zu den Mahnwachen, Friedensdemonstrationen und Pegida führt. Es ist nicht der Ausländerhass, es sind nicht die Verschwörungstheorien, es sind all diejenigen, welche vom Mainstream übergangen wurden, von denen man immer nur mehr Integrationsleistung forderte, mehr Toleranz, mehr Akzeptanz, mehr Unterstützung, mehr Solidarität, mehr Verzicht.

Das war die Mehrheit der Bevölkerung die diese Experimente der linksgrünen Traumtänzer so lange mit trug. Der Deutsche hat alles getan für Integration, EU, Europa, Amerikaner, jedem den seine Marionettenregierung in den Arsch gekrochen ist. Er hat gezahlt für den Zusammenhalt der EU und übt sich dafür seit 10 Jahren in Lohnverzicht. Er zahlt und bürgt für die Banken, wissend welches Betrugssystem da legalisiert wurde und nimmt dafür staatliche Kürzungen hin. Er nimmt Flüchtlinge in seinem Land auf und wird dafür als Nazi beschimpft, weil es nie genug sind. Mit den Problemen wird er indes allein gelassen. Er leistet viel zur Integration, trotzdem werden die Mehrzahl der Straftaten von Migranten begangen.

Nie durfte er Kritik an irgendeinem Missstand äußern. Immer hieß es sofort Nazi. Bei allem, bei jedem. Der Begriff verlor völlig seine Macht, erst bedeutete dies nicht mehr die gesellschaftliche Ablehnung die mit der öffentlichen Diffamierung einherging, irgendwann relativierten sich die Taten der Nazis selber. Ich bin auch Nazi, weil ich die EU kritisiere. Ich bin Rassist, weil ich ein anderes Asylsystem wünsche.

Da ist es kein Problem mehr für mich, mich zu anderen Rassisten und Nazis zu stellen.

All das wird aber nicht gesehen. Die Presse drischt auf Demonstranten ein wie nie zuvor, die Politik speit Galle, die Linksgrünen rotieren in ihren Foren und alle können nichts anderes mehr außer Nazi, Nazi rufen. 

Es gibt keine Argumente mehr, die dem linksgrünen Mainstream verständlich wären. Für sie gibt es nur einen Weg, alles andere endet im Nationalsozialismus. Die Medien haben dabei geholfen jegliche Debatte und Meinungspluralität zu ersticken. Man hält sich für unfehlbar und im Recht, dabei ist der Wahn in dem man sich befindet offenkundig.

Selbst der Dümmste sieht die schweren Verfehlungen der EU und der USA in der Ukraine. Für die linksgrünen ist so jemand automatisch ein Putinversteher und Nazi. Dass die Kritik berechtigt ist gibt es in deren Welt gar nicht. Da ist eine Sezession eine Annexion, obwohl es offensichtlich und für jeden nachprüfbar nicht so ist. 

Aber sie können nicht anders, sie müssen ihr Lied weitersingen und verstehen nicht, warum plötzlich überall Nazis sind. Die sind da, weil ihr jeden Nazi nennt der nicht eurer Meinung ist. Und das sind viele, denn ihr seid wie die Social Justice Warrior nur eine kleine, dafür vokale Gruppe, die nichts mit dem Volkswillen zu tun hat.",0,1418719534,null,0,1418722622,0,cmwek2p,t3_2pfy7y,t1_cmwek2p,t1_cmwceev,null,1425375221,-21,false,de,t5_22i0,-21

Oh yes, we can. Some liberation that was. Definitely liberated us of many lives and resources. I've been raised with stories of the war from my grandmother, and the most striking difference was in the way the people were treated. Germans always asked politely first for whatever they needed. Should you refuse, they took it anyway, but gave you compensation (money, or some other things you needed). Russians just outright pillaged, raped and torched the fucking place.

And while I'm not a 100% ethnic Romanian, I still feel resent for the continued (hello Transdniester) occupation and russification of Bessarabia which turned a fairly backwards place to begin with into an even more backwards place.

- Yes, Ruriks came from the North, but  the lands were already populated heavily by the Slavs before that, and Kyiv was already an important city
- The fact that Varangians first came to Novgorod and other Northern cities doesn't make them any more Russians than Ukrainians - they were foreigners to all Slavic tribes. (You wouldn't say that England was conquered and ruled by the French since William the Conqueror came from Normandy - it's generally considered to be the invasion of the Nordic people)
- Still, it is true that cities like Novgorod and Pskov were undoubtedly the integral part of Kievan Rus', but can Moscovy be considered the successor of those cities' heritage, or was it merely the conqueror, having different lineage? I'd say the history of the Novgorod Republic and Moscow suggest the latter.

As was the case of Kosovo. 



In what way is Crimea different from Kosovo? Why isn't it acceptable for an area predominantly populated by ethnic Russians to secede from a country it feels it does not belong to (Ukraine), if at the same time an area predominately populated by ethnic Albanians is encouraged to do that exactly (secede from Serbia). 



The matter of making sure the populace is not oppressed may have been a valid one in the 90s, but Serbia lost military control of the area to coalition forces (KFOR) for many years prior to the unilateral declaration of independence by the ethic Albanians inhabiting Kosovo. There was no real danger to the lives *of the ethic Albanians* at that moment, this cannot be used as an excuse. And who is to, conclusively, say that the lives of ethnic Russians may not have been in danger in Crimea as well?

I think that's being too conservative. The sudden rate hike was made in the middle of the night, literally 1 AM. Reeks more of desperation than resolve. But it did bring ruble back to about 61 per dollar. Temporarily.

Today the market will test the CB's resolve. And will find it lacking. And ruble will fall further today and this week.

Then Russia has both falling ruble and very high rates. And very little, even less than before, room of manouver left while they're heading into the recession. Which just got much much deeper with the rate hike.

Yesterday, before the rate hike, the CB estimated 4.5% to 4.7% contraction next year if oil price averages $60. And that was their worst case scenario. But that was yesterday. With the rate hike the scenario just got much much worse. I'd say even doubling the estimate is conservative, and because I'm a conservative my guess is at least -9% to -10% next year.

They remember being afraid of Romanians because Romanians were animals, they would beat and murder local young men for the sport of it. Then the Soviets came and with it, justice. Yeah, from the Soviets, imagine that. Sure, in the late 40s and 50s some men were sent to gulag, but almost everyone came back and when the Stalinist horrors ended, the Khrushchev era marked a time of prosperity and good life for my parents and grandparents.

I understand your countries suffered more from USSR... But it's quite damned selfish of you to overlook horrific German genocides and say that USSR was worse or the same. Nazis would have killed your people too, they had the plans in motion to eventually deport and kill all Balts who weren't fit to be Germanised (i.e. blue eye, blonde hair). Maybe they should have killed more Balts so that we wouldn't have people like you?

According to [EU-Oplysningen](http://www.eu-oplysningen.dk/euo_en/spsv/all/79/) , the Danish EU Information Center, here are the actual numbers if we look at the net contributions of the 5 most recent years they have: (numbers in EUR millions)

Year | France | FR Rank | United Kingdom | UK Rank
------ |------- | ---------- | ------------------ | --------
2008 | **3.842,7** | *3rd* | 844,3 | 6th
2009 | **5.872,7** | *2nd* | 1.903,3 | 4th
2010 | 5.534,8 | 3rd | **5.625,9** | *2nd*
2011 | **6.405,8** | *2nd* | 5.565,6 | 4th
2012 | **8.297,5** | *2nd* | 7.366,1 | 3rd


Total in the period 2008-2012: **29.903,5** for France against 21.305,2 for the UK, after rebate. 

So the UK is not only far from the net contribution of France but more than half of the time it actually contibutes less than Italy which is a smaller economy. And the trend is real for most of the 2000s with a few exceptions (eg. 2000, 2002, 2003, 2007).

That means exactly what I said in my first post: Many Americans know that the Iraq war was a terrible mistake, but refuse to give it the same level of atrocity as other events, because that would imply that the US has lost the higher moral ground long time ago. ""It was bad, but there are other countries doing worse!"". The fact that Bush was re-elected means that the people had other priorities instead of terminating the guy who caused the death of millions.

I am not saying that all the Americans were the same, hardly one can generalize over 300 million people, but people like you say are also in Russia. They are the *definitively yes*, *mostly yes* and *yes* option, which sometimes sum up to 20-25%, which is not negligible. But as much as there are demonstrations in Russia, and there are, you cannot say that they were a majority, as it is shown in the polls and it will be shown in the elections.

P.S: Just for curiosity, who of the government wanted to arrest Bush and Cheney? I am asking seriously, no irony.

P.S: I doubt that there were more demonstration, adjusting the population, in the US than in Spain, mostly because in Spain between 90% (the more leftist media polls) and 70% (the most rightist media polls) of Spaniards were directly against the war in the polls. Literally half of the country went to the street to demonstrate against and, as I said, the PP lost by the largest margin in its history.

Right now everyone downplays the USSR and it's crimes, just because they were made in the eastern Europe.

Why don't you imagine another scenario where USSR, Germany and China did not exist, then US is the ultimate evil... It's retarded. US is not evil. And while USSR was, it wasn't anywhere close to the level of evil Germany was. And USSR during Khrushchev was little different from what US did. And US during 19th century was far worse than Russia during 19th century. And if aliens invaded... It's bullshit hypotheticals. 
****

You know what I noticed? Lithuanians try the hardest to prove that USSR=Germany. Also Lithuanians still apparently honour their SS soldiers... I get that Lithuanians got the hard end of the stick from USSR, but I've studied my history in a US Uni, there is a scholarly consensus here that USSR did not come anywhere close to the evil of Germany. It is actually a form of holocaust denial to liken the two because usually in the US only the far-right and actual racists try to create equivalency between USSR and Nazis, it's a way to minimise the Nazi crimes.

During Cold War Western propaganda rehabilitated the Nazis due to Western German leadership being primarily ex-Nazis and due to the need of some sort of an anti-Soviet rhetoric to make Soviets the bad guys again after pro-Soviet propaganda during WWII. You know, now we are at war with Eurasia, always have been at war... Both sides pulled off that shit, US did that because they logically wanted USSR to look bad. 

Today's scholarly tradition (not that you would probably know, I doubt you have a BA in history from the way you sound) actually swings towards revisionism of the Cold War propaganda in favour of a more balanced view of USSR. See for instance the efforts of David Glantz to rewrite the history of the Eastern Front. Previously we only wrote our history with only German materials. No wonder all the West talked about during Cold War was the inhuman rape of Germany estimated at 0.5-1mil, conveniently forgetting the estimate 20mil raped and 30 mil dead Soviets. 

USSR did many bad things, but it had a long time to do them, not the five years that Hitler ran his extermination programme -- a very limited programme too, since the war really hurt his efforts to fully realise his plans. What Hitler did in his brief time outstripped anything USSR managed, imagine what would happen if he had more time? 


&gt;Nazis are considered more evil than the soviets but they shouldn't. Both were totalitarian, aggressive and committed massive crimes against humanity. You cannot say that one evil is better than the other evil - both are the same evil.

See, something like this is a logical argument. Not saying it is wrong. It's a philosophical point. I guess all murderers are bad too, Belgium genocided Africans in Congo, ergo Belgium is just as bad as Nazi Germany and USSR. Your argument can go anywhere if you structure it like that. Historians condemn Congolese genocide but they also recognise that Belgium does not compare to USSR and USSR does not compare to Nazi Germany. At least that's what I learned studying for a history BA in US. Not from Russian schools as you may imagine, so don't say I was raised on a diet of pro-Russian propaganda because I was not. My focus was Antiquities and Classics, but I took plenty of Euro history and read a great deal of books.

We’re incredibly sad to announce that, due to recent changes in Spanish law, we have removed Spanish publishers from Google News and closed Google News in Spain. We understand that readers like you may be disappointed, too, and we want to share the reasons behind this decision.

Google News is a free service, loved and trusted by hundreds of millions of users around the world and available in more than 70 international editions, covering 35 languages. It includes everything from the world’s biggest newspapers to small, local publications and bloggers. Publishers can choose whether or not they want their articles to appear in Google News -- and the vast majority choose to be included for very good reason. Google News creates real value for these publications by driving people to their websites, which in turn helps generate advertising revenues.

But sadly, as a result of a new Spanish law, we had to close Google News in Spain. This legislation requires every Spanish publication to charge services like Google News for showing even the smallest snippet from their publications, whether they want to or not. As Google News itself makes no money (we do not show any advertising on the site) this new approach was not sustainable.

We remain committed to helping the news industry meet challenges and look forward to continuing to work with our thousands of partners globally, as well as in Spain, to help them increase their online readership and revenues.",0,1418721815,null,0,false,0,cmwf2f1,t3_2pe1i2,t1_cmwf2f1,t3_2pe1i2,null,1425374980,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Puis... du réseau. Des charges d'Etat. Des capitaux. Du réseau. Des projets entre le public et le privé. Des capitaux. Du réseau. Des capitaux. Du réseau. Des capitaux.

Fondateur d'Action contre la faim ? De la BERD ? Il a tout fait de ses petites mains ? Non ; cela faisait plusieurs années qu'il traînait dans les sphères du pouvoir et qu'il avait les ressources pour monter des projets de ce type.

Il n'a rien du ""génie"" (wtf) ; il a tout de l'intellectuel médiatique et de l'homme de réseaux français : après un départ fulgurant, il capitalise sur ses premières réussites puis utilise son influence et ses relations pour ses projets. Si tu prends Alain Minc ou BHL, tu découvres des individus comparables.

Généralement, ça commence ainsi : 

* Né dans une famille bourgeoise ou confortable. Ou au moins des ""territoires aisés"" (Neuilly, 16^ème arrondissement, etc).

* Grandes études initiales (Polytechnique, ENS ou ENA), puis récupération de diplômes équivalents ou ""inférieurs"". Attali qui fait Polytechnique *puis* Science Po, c'est pas impressionnant, même il y a plusieurs décennies où cette école était encore élitiste.

* Premiers faits d'arme en lien avec le secteur public et la politique, liens avec les médias et *surtout*, il faut une première (parfois une unique) innovation, ou quelque chose de glorieux. Un *starter*. 

Prenez Alain Minc : premier rapport remarqué sur la *télématique* (ou quelque chose du genre) à l'époque où on imaginait pas que l'informatique puisse prendre autant de place dans nos vies. BHL voyageait et écrivait avant d'être terriblement riche et intégré dans les milieux mondains, et ne suivait pas une voie prédéfinie pour lui. Attali reçoit un prix de l'Académie des Sciences avant (ou vers...) ses trente ans, réuni des jeunes chercheurs plein de talents, bosse avec Mitterrand.

* Relations avec les milieux politiques, médiatiques et économiques à pouvoir. Là, c'est un système qui s'entretient tout seul. Des types comme Attali apportent des idées neuves, des projets, des dynamiques, et peuvent nourrir le besoin de représentation et de spectacle des institutions en place. Surtout, ils sont parfaitement conscients de leur place et savent s'adapter à la demande. On les voit sur des plateaux TV, à créer des organisations dans tous les sens, payés comme consultants, rapporteurs, conseillers spéciaux, ou se retrouvent à des dîners où il faut être. On les écoute, on les trouve très actifs, ambitieux et intelligents, et plus le temps passe plus ils ont de quoi prouver leur réputation.

Par contre, oui, c'est un type actif, ambitieux, brillant et qui sait utiliser les ressources qui sont à sa disposition. Je l'aime bien. Je n'aime pas trop les autres intellectuels médiatiques. Attali s'amuse et se lance dans plein de projets. Contrairement à BHL ou Minc qui se sont spécialisés dans certaines postures, Attali sort de sa zone de confort avec régularité ; pour ça, je me dis que ça doit être un mec intéressant à écouter ou rencontrer. 

Et surtout, c'est un mec terriblement positif. Là où un BHL cherche à se créer une petite noblesse de toge, où Alain Minc se planque de plus en plus en s'enterrant sous des tas de fric, Attali s'expose de plus en plus et fait preuve d'un optimisme assez délirant.

D'ailleurs, si vous êtes sur Paris, et que vous cherchez un vrai BBQ sauce américain qui soit pas industriel, PM me.

En gros, le vrai BBQ sauce authentique est une mixture d'au moins 40% de sucres et de molasses, de la moutarde, de l'ail, des oignons, du vinaigre, de la sauce tomate, sel, poivre et épices (je fais la mienne au Chipotle, très épicée sans être trop pimentée, afin de caresser les palais français dans le sens du poil). Et bien sûr l'incontournable smoke flavor. J'utilise en général la marque STUB, qui produit aussi un magnifique BBQ sauce dont on peut en trouver au ""Thanksgiving"" - une petite boutique américaine pour les immigrants américains qui ne peuvent pas vivre sans leur Jello et leur Macaroni and cheese, mais ça vous coutera bonbon. Parfois, au moment de la cuisiner, je la *frenchise* un peu avec un fond de veau et du beurre, ce qui exagère son goût et casse un peu son acidité.

Généralement il y a deux sortes de BBQ sauce, un plus ""ketchupy"", plus souple, à la consistance d'une sauce tomate de couleur brune et plus épaisse, et l'autre, plus ""molasse"", généralement très sucrée, dont on laque les travers de porc avant de les cuire au fumoir ou au Barbecue. La ""ketchupy"" est généralement ajoutée en sauce à la fin de la cuisson, ou cuite avec les travers de porc, le tout dans du papier d'alu, pour les cuissons très lentes au four (105-110 degrés, pendant 5-6 heures, après avoir saisi et bruni les ribs à feu vif). Les ""blancs"" américains préfèrent généralement la première méthode, tandis que les africains-américains les font plutôt au four dans de l'alu. Ces sont mes ribs favoris.

I don't really see your point though. Imagine if Nazi Germany lasted 'till 1990. Much worse. I don't see another alternative. It was either Nazi Germany or USSR. Sure, you can invent a fantasy scenario where the totalitarian horrors of the 20th century don't exist, but that's a pipe dream. 

The longer shit lasts the harder the stink is to get rid of... A dead rat that sat in my attic for seven days stinks harder than a dead pig that sat for one day. Especially if I just removed the rat two days ago and the pig was removed six days ago.

&gt;Yes they were less racist as they wiped out all peoples equally.

Very misleading. For one, USSR only cared about people resisting it generally speaking, it did not directly murder women and children for simply being born as what they were.

However, USSR was not equal in wiping out all the people. The Ukrainians got the worst time, Stalin was afraid of Ukraine rising up and he let it suffer the worst of the famines that spread through USSR in the 30s. He exacerbated the Ukrainian famine by exporting grain whilst Ukrainians starved. He may not have necessarily had a racist hatred of Ukrainians so Ukrainian generals and politicians still served under him unlike Germany's Jews, but Ukrainians got shit on hard by USSR. Not equal really. 

Still, USSR did not seek to exterminate, the gulags had comparatively low mortality rates of ~10-15% and released those who reached the end of their terms. Compare this to the German camps. Comparing German to Soviet camps is just as misleading as comparing American to Soviet camps. American camps sought to detain, but not to exterminate or work half to death - any deaths that happened were not planned for, although may have been resulting from poorer conditions. Soviet camps sought to work the inmates half to death and some indeed died, but that was not the aim -- but many deaths happened since Soviets didn't care enough about welfare of the inmates, only in getting work out of them. German camps simply sought to exterminate, some got more work out of the inmates than others, but generally nobody got released and everyone would eventually die unless liberated.

AH BON?! (à prononcer avec l'intonation de la marionnette de roselyne bachelot dans les guignols)

&gt;Enfin, il ne me semble pas que les cultures OGM aient pour but de favoriser un système de monoculture, ce qui serait un non-sens agronomique.

Et pourtant, c'est exactement ce qui se passe. 

Les semances OGM sont un non-sens agronomique. 

On remplace des choses qui marchent très bien par d'autres de plus en plus efficaces *économiquement*, tout en réduisant drastiquement la biodiversité. L'agronomie et l'écologie n'entrent jamais dans l'équation.

I mean obviously not ethnic hatred and similar things. Just protecting the rights of minorities abroad even if they are no your citizens, just your ethnics. Ideally of course it would be all minorities.

So I just mean it in the sense being extra sensitive about human rights when there is an ethnic connection, not necessarily a passport.

I don't think we will buy into ignoring the human rights of our ethnies living abroad if they don't have passports. It seems from here that protecting an ethnic group from persecution is the _reason_ for our states to exist. Giving that up, we might as well stop having a Hungarian state, if it is not the state meant for protecting ethnic Hungarians, we may as well just integrate into some kind of a Greater Germany. Or turn the EU in the state. As long as the state exists, it will do this job or at least the voters will expect it.

And it is not something bad - it is not the hatreds of old times, it is merely a human rights focus: with extra diligence when there is an ethnic link.

false,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"&gt; As an Asian American (from India), will I be stared at or singled out?

Germans maintain eye contact for slightly longer than Americans do, which makes Americans *think* they're being stared at all the time. However, since whites complain about this as much as anyone else, it's just a cultural thing and nothing to do with your ethnicity. Berlin is a fairly cosmopolitan city, and a few years ago Germany actually did all it could to attract Asian Indians to work in IT.

&gt; What should I do in terms of a bank account/financials?

Open a bank account in Germany. It makes life a lot easier. The two main banks you might want to consider are Berliner Volksbank and Berliner Sparkasse. I know the Volksbank has (or at least used to have) a free current account; if you regularly go to one of the branches and use the machines there to print out your bank statements instead of waiting for them to be sent to you, you won't pay any charges at all. They may have special deals for students.

&gt; Is cash or credit more widely used in Berlin?

Germans generally prefer to pay by cash for ordinary purchases; for larger purchases, regular bills (such as utilities and rent) and for online purchases, it's usual to pay by direct transfer.

If you want to pay by card, use your bank card at any place with the ""EC"" (""electronic cash"") symbol -- this is a debit card, not a credit card, so you don't have to pay any fees or interest.

Often, anti- and pro-EU supporters dislike the same things about the union: overpaid MEPs who don't seem to do very much, unelected (if indirectly) people with seemingly lots of power, weird regulations concerning fruit &amp; veg... I think there are two things that really divide both camps: unstoppable migration, both as a springboard, such as non-EU citizens getting citizenship somewhere and moving elsewhere, and the intended workforce movement (Polish workers, Romanian workers, gypsies from other countries, etc). The second thing is the general idea of the EU, and possible eventual federalisation, as a whole. It is seen, and certainly to an extent quite rightly, as a loss of national identity. It won't be Britannia ruling the waves but Europa, that kinda thing, I guess (ignoring the fact that actually it's the USA now)?

Your countrymen lined up the Jews in front of our bathhouse with the Germans supervising and shot them all. My 12 yo grandfather had to watch his best friend shot with his family only to have the best friend lose and arm and survive until the Romanian soldiers beat him to death with rifle butts. Visit Northern Moldova for me, see how much you are loved there, especially in Jewish villages like Berlintsi. Who am I kidding though, no fullblood Jews survived the war in my locale, thanks to your people. Briceni region where my parents grew up and Chernivtsi where I grew up were all areas of very high Jewish settlement, my mother was half-Jewish too, from her mother. No full Jews survived in my village, no Jewish men that I heard of survived. Boo fuckin' hoo Russians caused a mess in your country.
 
&gt; Too fucking bad Russians pillaged you. You genocided my mother's people. Your men raped, pillaged and looted Russia and Moldova and Ukraine. I guess it hurts when the shoe is on your foot. Except you're very lucky you didn't get what you deserved, an eye for eye. Brutal, sure, but Nazis deserve no less. Exterminating women and children for who they were born as.... FUCK your people. I bet you liked the Germans. They were polite and they murdered all Jews and most Slavs they could find. Why don't you tell me how much you love Nazis now, ignoring all the dirty stuff they did. I guess Marilyn Monroe didn't shit either because your grandmother didn't see it.

&gt; One thing for a Pole to complain about USSR, Poles did not invade USSR along with Germany as Romania did. I've got no sympathy for your folk, sorry, not when you present your case this way. My grandparents hate the Romanians. When they were children and when their parents were young, Romanians roamed Moldova as lord and they would murder Ukrainians and Russians sometimes and suffer no consequence. They remember being afraid of Romanians because Romanians were animals, they would beat and murder local young men for the sport of it. Then the Soviets came and with it, justice. Yeah, from the Soviets, imagine that. Sure, in the late 40s and 50s some men were sent to gulag, but almost everyone came back and when the Stalinist horrors ended, the Khrushchev era marked a time of prosperity and good life for my parents and grandparents. Not like the slavery under Romanians landlords.
 
&gt; No sympathy mate, no sympathy.

&gt; As the half-term bank holiday Monday dawned, it became clear that I could either spend the day looking out of the window, imagining that the clouds were lifting while the children Instagrammed pictures of their own stools — or we could go to Paris for lunch.

&gt; And so, three and a bit hours later, we were sitting in a cafe in the Place des Vosges, making reservations at the delightful Benoit restaurant off the Rue de Rivoli. A small walk round the Louvre later, we were back on the train and by 9pm we were back in London. It was one of the most wonderful and joyous days I’ve had in years.

&gt; And it was all so easy. Yes, the train station at London St Pancras International has various passport booths and security measures, but unlike the security measures you encounter at airports, you are not made to remove your shoes and your belt, you are not expected to unpack your computer, nobody caresses your testicles and you are allowed to pass through carrying as much toothpaste as you like.

&gt; Check-in times? Well, they suggest you should be at the station half an hour before departure but because of the adult way the French treat the terrorism threat, we made it to the Gare du Nord three minutes before the train left. And were still allowed to board.

&gt; It’s not just the rail link between London and Paris that’s easy either. My son says that on his InterRailing travels last year from Amsterdam to — actually he can’t remember where he went after that — he was never asked to show his passport once. And that at no point did stern-looking men with greatcoats and alsatians board the train demanding to see everyone’s papers.

&gt; It’s the same story on the road. You simply don’t know any more when you’ve passed from France into Belgium and the only way you know you’ve gone from Italy into Austria is because there’s no litter, or graffiti, or untidiness of any kind. It’s like you’ve gone from a Roman orgy into a Victorian lady’s underwear drawer.

&gt; I love Europe and it makes me happy that one day we will have forgotten the difficult birth and made the EU work. I long for a time when I think of myself as a European first and an Englishman second. I crave a United States of Europe with one currency, one army and one type of plug socket. And yes, I know, there will be drawbacks. We’re already seeing some of them, which is why more than a quarter of those who went to the polls in the recent European elections voted UKIP.

&gt; One of the drawbacks I notice quite often is that in South Kensington, which is a leafy part of southwest London, almost everyone is French. The whole area is awash with lovely patisseries and the pavements are rammed with women so elegant and beautiful I have to bite the back of my hand to stop myself from crying out. This is obviously so much worse than if everyone were lurching around in tracksuits looking for somewhere to vomit.

&gt; Just up the road, I know of a Polish restaurant where you can buy dainty little dumplings. And for sure this is a huge step backwards from the takeaway joint that used to be on the site. Because who wants to be served a dumpling by a charming Polish man when they could have a polystyrene tray full of slime instead?

&gt; My local off-licence is staffed entirely by French people who know everything about wine. And that’s wrong too. Because what you actually want is a fat school-leaver and a shop full of Carling Black Label.

&gt; Outside London there are real problems, of course. In the flatlands of East Anglia farmers are finding that all the traditional home-grown workers are sitting at home playing video games on gigantic televisions, and as a result they are having to employ an army of Romanians and Bulgarians.

&gt; The only upside to this is that these recent arrivals are prepared to work 27 hours a day and pay the farmer for permission to come to work, which means fruit and veg prices in the supermarket are low.

&gt; Further north we have Rotherham, a South Yorkshire town in which UKIP is now the main opposition party to Labour. Locals are said to be fed up with the number of immigrants and want to go back to the olden days.

&gt; Hmmm. I worked for three years on a Rotherham newspaper back in the late 1970s. And, I’m sorry, but back then it was pretty terrible.

&gt; There was one sandwich shop and if you discounted the council-run cafe in the bus station — which I did on a daily basis — there was not one single restaurant.

&gt; Going out for dinner meant going to the pub and buying some salt and vinegar crisps. Prawn cocktail? No, we bloody haven’t, you poof.

&gt; It was a monoculture. Everyone thought the same and did the same. When one person went on strike, everyone went on strike. They didn’t even trust me because I was from Doncaster.

&gt; Nowadays when you drive through the town it takes about five seconds to realise that it isn’t a monoculture any more. Half the cars sport foreign registration plates. There’s an eastern European delicatessen on Wellgate. Many men look like potatoes. The town has become a blend of several things. And is that a bad thing?

&gt; Well, I suppose if you think that Rotherham is your town and that all of the jobs in it are rightfully yours, then, yes; it is bad when Mr Zyscyzsky offers his services at the call centre for 32p a year and, as a result, you have to sit at home all day watching Cash in the Attic.

&gt; But look at it this way. When I worked in Rotherham almost everyone was deeply resentful of the Queen. They argued that entitlement was not a birth right. So by the same token it’s quite wrong to say Rotherham is your town just because you were born there.

&gt; I know that the EU doesn’t work now. I know the currency is a disaster and that it’s run by an army of muddle-headed fools. And I know too that they obsess about the correct size for a haddock and the proper shape of a banana. But on the upside you can go to Paris for lunch ever-so easily.

&gt; A poll conducted by the Crimean Institute of Political and Social Research on 8–10 March 2014 found that 77% of respondents planned to vote for ""reunification with Russia"", and 97% assessed the current situation in Ukraine as negative. A poll conducted by the GfK Group on 12–14 March 2014 with 600 respondents found that 70.6% of Crimeans intended to vote for joining Russia, 10.8% for restoring the 1992 constitution and 5.6% did not intend to take part in the referendum. The poll also showed that if Crimeans had more choices, 53.8% of them would choose joining Russia, 5.2% restoration of 1992 constitution, 18.6% a fully independent Crimean state and 12.6% would choose to keep the previous status of Crimea.

There are innumerable examples where the pope's opinion on matters of sovereignty, during the middle ages and beyond, were ignored. Any decisions made by the pope that were contrary to the outcome of battles were either retrospectively changed or forgotten. A prime example of this is the 4th Crusade.



&gt;And as I said, neither of these concepts are absolute. De facto world is always a little different than the conceptual situation.



So if only force decides where borders lie (whether it is military force, economical force, diplomatic force etc.), why all the butthurt over Ukraine? If international law, treaties between countries and respect for the wishes of the peoples living in each area are inconsequential, why blame any powerful country for taking what they want when it is in their interest?

false,EmperorZIZ,EURO,Belgium likes no war neigbours,"Personally, i care about that Palestine becomes a state more than for the Basques f.e. because tensions (often escalating to serious violence) have been going on foreeever. I think they've passed the point of reconciliation (if Israel f.e. made a 'Palestinian' region within Israel with a lot of power).

I'm a Belgian, and there has been argued that we exist out of multiple nations and that we therefore need to split up. I don't agree with that: as long as the rights and desires of a big majority is fulfilled (and there is no conflict) i don't see a reason to split up. (true: the structure of our state can be a lot simpeler).

I get the 'etnic' nationalism: you want your state to be shared by those who are your equals and want your taxes go to those you consider ""your own"", but, although understandable, i think it's a bit outdated. (although i will admit, it will be easier to administre a state where the citizens are largely of one culture; it's no reason for creating or destroying a state however. It needs to go along with the will of a large chunk of people who want a totally different policy than that of the current state)

In that light, i see current nationalism in Europe nowadays as a weaker form of such Etnic nationalism. True, they claim to be different cultures, but it is also combined with a difference in state policy. They don't see themselves as a completly different etnicity as other people (difference between teh Flemish and the Dutch f.e.), which is why i'd support their independence in a peaceful way.

I hope i'm making sense here :)

&gt; I propose that the ""strong"" should be civic nationalists and the ""weak"" should be ethnic. So it is defense, never offense.

I don't understand this. Do you mean that leaders should look on their country as full of citizens, instead of one etnicity, and the normal citizens should be ethnic nationalists? Why not all be civic nationalists?

Because you can't push them to do anything. Least of all abandon the very idea Israel was created upon as a safe haven for ethnic Jewish people. 

In a perfect democracy any state could theoretically have an influx on foreign nationals with ideas of their own, and be turned into any other state which drives a lot of fear against a complete loss of national identity. In reality a state is more like a huge family where democracy is a part of it but it's restricted by constitutional provisions aimed at preserving the status quo within the state. 

Ultimately for your ideal to work we'd have to first see religious and ideological heavily political states disappear before the more relaxed states can afford to abandon those provisions based on national identity.

It is a bunch of entities who all have different price points for success. For OPEC to function there needs to be a single strategy and price point which can service all of these members.

The rise of shale has destroyed that reality. The OPEC members with tighter margins need oil priced at price points that shale easily competes with. To hold that price point OPEC has to cut production, something they've done regularly the past decade. US shale has consistently expanded as OPEC cuts production. It has gotten to the point where the stronger OPEC members no longer tolerate such losses of income. Every time they cut they lose income and the price doesn't even go up because US shale expands.

Saudi Arabia and other stronger OPEC members have decided their best value lies in dropping the price point and taking a larger market share. This effectively stabs other OPEC members in the back. OPEC are effectively dead at this point. Nobody has officially stated as much yet because no benefit comes from admitting your grand cartel is done. The power of OPEC is gone though. Probably for good.

The collapse has come on because it is has become apparent just how dead OPEC is. The death of OPEC has put a bomb under the futures market. This was already uncertain because of the huge gap between expected and actual Chinese energy and oil usage.

In the case of LGBT rights specifically, this is evidently a global problem. The West has made significant progress in this space, but it was not many years ago when Western societies were rather illiberal in this space, and there undoubtedly remains much progress to be made, even in the West.

Clearly, I am not advocating the importation of illiberal practises. In fact, immigrants are often profoundly affected in a positive way when they come into contact with a liberal society, if they have lived previously under an illiberal society.

Oui, mais une Italie debout qui participe activement à la prospérité économique de la zone euro c'est plus utile qu'une Italie à genoux hors de la zone euro. Bien sûr dans le cas où l'Italie propose des réformes intéressantes, si c'est pour continuer d'entretenir un système défaillant alors à quoi bon ? Mais je suis sûr qu'on peut faire confiance aux italiens.

&gt;Alors qu'ils peuvent très bien retourner au mark, ou même garder l'euro avec les pays du nord.

Avec la disparition ou une modification en profondeur de l'euro l'Allemagne sera grandement perdante sur tout son commerce extérieur, la réévaluation profonde de l'euro ou d'un nouveau Mark perturbera le commerce avec son partenaire principal (La France) et nuira aux investissements allemands dans les autres pays.

Aider l'Italie à se redresser ça a un coût. Sortir de l'euro ça a aussi un coût. Maintenant y a pas d'application Leclerc pour nous dire ""Qui est le moins cher"" et c'est de toute façon très dur de mettre un prix sur chacunes des actions sans faire de débats politiques (chose que j'ai pas envie de faire).

L'euro j'ai envie d'y croire, une zone euro en bonne santé j'ai la conviction que c'est un atout non négligeable (transactions facilités entre partenaires et une monnaie solide face au Dollar).

&gt;Google made the decision to close Google News in Spain as well as to remove all Spanish publishers from all other editions of Google News. Because of the Spanish government’s new law, which comes into effect in January, Google would have been required to pay all those publishers for merely linking to them from Google News.

&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;It is unlikely that Spanish government has any grounds to be able to force Google News to return to the country, despite the AEDE’s insistence that it is required to *“protect the rights of citizens and companies”*. But it is presumed that there are definitely some publishers upset about losing the traffic, although the AEDE refused to comment on the reactions from publishers. Free traffic is still free traffic and publishers still have the ability to monetize on the traffic the Google News sends to them, even if they are not getting paid for Google linking to them.

&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;What will the next news be? Many believe that Google will not relent on their position, as they do not make money specifically from Google News.

&gt; TV Rain's case is really simple, and the roots of it being thrown out go back to the way it was created. Rain is owned by Natalia Sindeeva, who also owns slon.ru and ""Silver Rain"" radio (both are heavly favoring the opposition). Sindeeva is a close friend of Natalia Timakova, press secretary of Dmitriy Medvedev (since when he was a president). Her husband, Alexander Vinokurov owned (and lead to bancrupcy) ""KIT Finance"" bank. You can read about the corruption scandal about the money sent to save the bank [here.

Overall, TV Rain was created with a massive administrative support behind it. Medvedev himself was endorcing the channel.

&gt; This resulted in an extremely stupid situation. Normally, content providers pay cabel network owners to broadcast their channels and include them in channel packages. In case of TV Rain the situation was *reversed*. Network owners were the one paying Rain for the 'privilege' of showing their content. Not particularly popular content at that. And they couldn't do anything about it, because the channel had massive money and support behind it. So of course they dropped the channel like a hot potato, the moment it screwed up.

I didn't realise freedom of expression was so worthless.

What is fundamentally wrong with what you are saying is that it *is* possible to change these things, it just takes time. Do you think that Iraq is going to be occupied forever? Troops have been gradually pulling out and restoring order and governance to the country. In contrast, Crimea is now likely to remain a part of Russia for all of the foreseeable future. *Part* of that is public opinion - democratically open States have no interest in annexing other territories, in general. 

The states in Iraq face massive internal pressure to withdraw troops, and are doing so. In contrast, Russian people don't even believe that troops are in Crimea, and even if they did it is not clear whether they would support the withdrawal of those troops. There is absolutely no internal pressure on Russia to cease the illegal annexation of Crimea. Admittedly, the West is thankfully crippling Russia's economy in response to it, but because of the Russian propaganda, people in Russia genuinely think that this is an aggressive move by the West rather than a response to a horrific power grab. Thus, the propaganda machine can use this response to prop up the regime and ensure that Russia will stay in Crimea for longer.

A world were bad things are happen and everyone knows about it, but is unable or not willing to change something, is worse than a world when the atrocities are widely unknown.

false,_I_Have_Opinions_,ASTR,Europe,"That's the piece (shamelessly stolen from /u/boq):

&gt; As the half-term bank holiday Monday dawned, it became clear that I could either spend the day looking out of the window, imagining that the clouds were lifting while the children Instagrammed pictures of their own stools — or we could go to Paris for lunch.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; And so, three and a bit hours later, we were sitting in a cafe in the Place des Vosges, making reservations at the delightful Benoit restaurant off the Rue de Rivoli. A small walk round the Louvre later, we were back on the train and by 9pm we were back in London. It was one of the most wonderful and joyous days I’ve had in years.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; And it was all so easy. Yes, the train station at London St Pancras International has various passport booths and security measures, but unlike the security measures you encounter at airports, you are not made to remove your shoes and your belt, you are not expected to unpack your computer, nobody caresses your testicles and you are allowed to pass through carrying as much toothpaste as you like.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Check-in times? Well, they suggest you should be at the station half an hour before departure but because of the adult way the French treat the terrorism threat, we made it to the Gare du Nord three minutes before the train left. And were still allowed to board.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It’s not just the rail link between London and Paris that’s easy either. My son says that on his InterRailing travels last year from Amsterdam to — actually he can’t remember where he went after that — he was never asked to show his passport once. And that at no point did stern-looking men with greatcoats and alsatians board the train demanding to see everyone’s papers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It’s the same story on the road. You simply don’t know any more when you’ve passed from France into Belgium and the only way you know you’ve gone from Italy into Austria is because there’s no litter, or graffiti, or untidiness of any kind. It’s like you’ve gone from a Roman orgy into a Victorian lady’s underwear drawer.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I love Europe and it makes me happy that one day we will have forgotten the difficult birth and made the EU work. I long for a time when I think of myself as a European first and an Englishman second. I crave a United States of Europe with one currency, one army and one type of plug socket. And yes, I know, there will be drawbacks. We’re already seeing some of them, which is why more than a quarter of those who went to the polls in the recent European elections voted UKIP.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; One of the drawbacks I notice quite often is that in South Kensington, which is a leafy part of southwest London, almost everyone is French. The whole area is awash with lovely patisseries and the pavements are rammed with women so elegant and beautiful I have to bite the back of my hand to stop myself from crying out. This is obviously so much worse than if everyone were lurching around in tracksuits looking for somewhere to vomit.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Just up the road, I know of a Polish restaurant where you can buy dainty little dumplings. And for sure this is a huge step backwards from the takeaway joint that used to be on the site. Because who wants to be served a dumpling by a charming Polish man when they could have a polystyrene tray full of slime instead?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; My local off-licence is staffed entirely by French people who know everything about wine. And that’s wrong too. Because what you actually want is a fat school-leaver and a shop full of Carling Black Label.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Outside London there are real problems, of course. In the flatlands of East Anglia farmers are finding that all the traditional home-grown workers are sitting at home playing video games on gigantic televisions, and as a result they are having to employ an army of Romanians and Bulgarians.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The only upside to this is that these recent arrivals are prepared to work 27 hours a day and pay the farmer for permission to come to work, which means fruit and veg prices in the supermarket are low.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Further north we have Rotherham, a South Yorkshire town in which UKIP is now the main opposition party to Labour. Locals are said to be fed up with the number of immigrants and want to go back to the olden days.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Hmmm. I worked for three years on a Rotherham newspaper back in the late 1970s. And, I’m sorry, but back then it was pretty terrible.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; There was one sandwich shop and if you discounted the council-run cafe in the bus station — which I did on a daily basis — there was not one single restaurant.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Going out for dinner meant going to the pub and buying some salt and vinegar crisps. Prawn cocktail? No, we bloody haven’t, you poof.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It was a monoculture. Everyone thought the same and did the same. When one person went on strike, everyone went on strike. They didn’t even trust me because I was from Doncaster.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Nowadays when you drive through the town it takes about five seconds to realise that it isn’t a monoculture any more. Half the cars sport foreign registration plates. There’s an eastern European delicatessen on Wellgate. Many men look like potatoes. The town has become a blend of several things. And is that a bad thing?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Well, I suppose if you think that Rotherham is your town and that all of the jobs in it are rightfully yours, then, yes; it is bad when Mr Zyscyzsky offers his services at the call centre for 32p a year and, as a result, you have to sit at home all day watching Cash in the Attic.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; But look at it this way. When I worked in Rotherham almost everyone was deeply resentful of the Queen. They argued that entitlement was not a birth right. So by the same token it’s quite wrong to say Rotherham is your town just because you were born there.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I know that the EU doesn’t work now. I know the currency is a disaster and that it’s run by an army of muddle-headed fools. And I know too that they obsess about the correct size for a haddock and the proper shape of a banana.

A lot of the sanctions in place serve as limitations, barriers to markets, produces, or services. Had sanctions not been in place the price of oil would have still affected the Russian budget. But the sanctions [""...cover not only technological equipment, but also oil services, such as construction, repairs, and drilling preparation and exploration in new oilfields.""](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30217070) Because of the sanctions Putin's working with one hand tied behind his back -- no access to foreign capital (to prevent the ruble demand from falling and inflation spiking) or the technology required for his ~~business~~ country.

*Avremmo bisogno di un diverso concetto degli animali, più saggio e forse più poetico… Trattiamo con condiscendenza la loro incompletezza e il tragico destino di avere assunto una forma assai inferiore alla nostra, e in questo sbagliamo: non possiamo misurare gli animali con il nostro stesso metro. In un mondo più arcaico e completo del nostro gli animali si muovevano compiuti e perfetti, dotati di percezioni sensoriali che noi non abbiamo mai raggiunto o abbiamo perduto, vivendo di gridi che non udremo mai. Gli animali non sono nostri fratelli né subalterni; sono popoli altri, coinvolti come noi nella trama della vita e del tempo, compagni di prigionia dello splendido e faticoso travaglio della terra.*

&gt;Crimea was annexed by Russia. It is now a part of Russia. 



And Kosovo is basically an extension of Albania, a country largely (politically and economically) under the control of the US; in much the same way that Greece, FYROM, Bulgaria and Croatia are. That is to say they house US troops on their soil, they have favourable trade agreements with the US (as part or not of the EU), they do not oppose US foreign policy, and even go against their own county's best interests when those conflict with US interests (South Stream).



The annexation is simply a formality the US choose not to go through.

If you were to make a graph since 911 it would be a continuous upward curve, at least in the UK and Spain. You would think - logically - that at some point you reach a plateau where the laws are in place and at functional level - you don't get increased anti-murder laws every time there's a murder for example: the law is what it is and the penalties are there if you break it.

With 'terrorism' it's not like that. There's a symbiotic relationship where if an event happens then an increasingly restrictive law happens in response. This alone should give one pause to think that maybe the laws in the first place don't actually work and therefore increasing the same laws in a more Draconian fashion won't work either.

That's the charitable view. Personally I see it as being more sinister that that. At the very least if such a relationship exists where an event happens and Police/Intel are guaranteed more power then I'm cynical enough to be suspecting maybe they might give a little tweak here and there.

The law is fit for purpose, because in this case there is nothing that can be done.

You can't send them back to the country they escaped from (breaching the non-refoulment principle, plus massively open to abuse and runs completely counter to the spirit in which the refugee convention was adopted).

That's the thing. There *is not solution.* Apart from sanctions being lifted, and oil prices shooting up above 100. The situation they're in has no options -- let alone good or even decent options. 

Capital controls could serve as a short-term 'stop-gap'. But they've already effectively limited large withdrawals, placed limits on foreign currencies, and placed levies on the rich. Should they resort to stringent capital controls it would indicate a last ditch, all or nothing, effort to prevent their economy from heading toward a near-zero non-elastic free-fall.

...And they've already passed my worst predication. Saudi/UAE have stated their reluctance to curb production *even if oil falls below $40/b*, and it's still falling.

E parte del marketing era anche il disprezzo del 'diverso', cioe' di quello che non si voleva (o poteva, per mancanza di quattrini) conformare.

E' stato un fenomeno prettamente commerciale e tipicamente italiano, e la cosa allucinante e' che non c'e' stata (per almeno qualche anno) alcuna controcultura capace di opporsi a questo vuoto pneumatico (a parte altre frange minori).

Il paninarismo ha dilagato ovunque (complici anche le TV del Berlusca), per poi disperdersi nel nulla da cui proveniva... sparito, come tantissime mode raccapriccianti primi anni '80, che a me sembrano sempre piu' un periodo oscurissimo.

The Blue Card is VERY easy to get, seriously. In my situation, there was no degree, and it was still very easy to get a (different) visa. They tried to submit it for a Blue Card, but it was turned down and they gave me a normal one instead. With a degree, you can show up, go to the Ausländerbehörde with 110€, your passport, a passport photo, your Meldebestätigung (city registration, so you need an address and rental agreement or letter from residence owner saying you live there), and your degree, and you will receive a 6-month looking-for-work pre-Blue Card Visa. If you want, you can also wait untill you have a signed job contract and go in with those same things plus the contract, and get the Blue Card directly.

You need, because software engineering is on the job shortage list, only 32.000€ a year salary to qualify (with a degree) for the Blue Card. You should be trying to accept at least 50.000€, though it depends on city and experience.

Without a degree, you need to make more than 46.000€ (though this is not really defined anywhere so it could be less and they'd still give approval) and have that signed job contract within the 90 days of your ""tourist visa"" that you arrive, and it will have to be approved by the Agentür für Arbeit (the Ausländerbehörde will handle it for you), and then you will get a normal residence permit and work permit, that doesn't have some of the benefits of the Blue Card, but with an open-ended work contract, you can still get a 3 year residence permit.

Blue Card will allow you and any spouse and children to live and work. After 21 months, if you pass a B-1 language test, you can apply for permanent residence, and citizenship after 5 years.

On a normal visa, you can only apply for permanant residence after 5 years, no spouse/children umbrella, and citizenship only after 7 years.

Hope that helps ;)

Però dai tempi di Berlusconi in poi gli italiani son diventati troppo fighi e tutti volevano l'auto per mammà e l'auto per papà e guardavano le bici come roba da sfigati. Infatti tutte le scorciatoie sono sparite, ci hanno fatto su strade per andare ai centri commerciali o cose simili. 

Da un po' di anni le bici sono tornate un po' di moda, adesso ci sono piste ciclabili ma ormai quasi più ciclisti. Per me era fattibile allora ed è fattibile adesso, ancora meglio se ricreano quelle scorciatoie tra i campi (che ridurrebbero anche gli incidenti con le macchine). Il problema è pigrizia / paura di rovinarsi il vestito / paura di fare una brutta figura.

UKIP policy is not to join the EEA or EFTA.

Of course, UKIP won't actually be in power, a less anti-EU party would be, so it's quite possible that after losing the referendum the main governing party would try to recreate EU membership as much as possible using other treaties. EEA membership would be an obvious thing to want, including freedom of movement.

Personally, I think that EEA membership would drive the UKIPpers much more crazy than it would the EU :)

&gt;  It's not like trade will stop but we might see some pretty severe reductions as import/export tariffs and other restrictions are imposed.

Tariffs are not all that big, an average of 1% according to this: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/TM.TAX.MRCH.WM.AR.ZS

(But much bigger in specific areas).

It's the bureaucracy and other non-tariff barriers that'll be the killer. Proof-of-origin rules, for example.

&gt; But at least you'll have some British jobs, not necessarily more than now but there will be less Europeans competing for them.

And there'll be fewer Europeans earning money here, spending it and creating jobs. Money circulates, and the employment rate is not fixed.

* The city's historical centre is, save for a few patches around the main stations, reasonably clean; the rest of Rome's suburban districts offer varying standards of cleanliness but I think that most of them are just slightly below average. The posher parts of town aren't necessarily cleaner.

* Public services (such as transportation) are terrible and inefficient; moreover, most Romans love going around in their cars and wouldn't probably take public transport into due consideration even if a better alternative was provided. Italian industrial products are generally good quality, but expensive.

* Yes, but there need to be harsher standards (even at the cost of flunking everybody). 

* Yes, but it depends on where you are; big cities have better structures, and the Centre/North has generally better hospitals than the South or the islands. If a public hospital isn't satisfying or the waiting lists are too long you can always fall back on private healthcare, though.

* No, absolutely not. IMHO 15, 20 years ago everybody was just... more sensible, polite and considerate. And there was more social cohesion, I remember we used to chat with our neighbours or the shopkeeper; now try to strike up a conversation at a bus stop, you'll be looked at as if you were an alien (unless you're taling to an elder person, they're chatterboxes!). Hell, I don't even know who my neighbours are, never seen or talked to them: general rudeness has also become rampant lately, and things have gone downhill since the early 2000s. The current (financial, but also moral) crisis didn't help, either. Parking cars correctly? There's no space left for them in city, so any spot is good - always assuming you manage to find one. 

* No, only a starry-eyed expat who doesn't know any better would ever think that living here could be any good. But if you've got money (as in: lots of it) things are of course *very* different.

Venire in italia direttamente è un salto nel buio, potresti rimanere senza niente e rimanerci per mesi (o anni) oppure trovare subito qualcosa. Scegli comunque una grande città del nord o al massimo Roma.

In ogni caso il problema in italia è che non hai nemmeno troppe alternative, nei momenti in cui non c'era la crisi potevi stare anche senza lavoro e arrangiarti facendo il cameriere o lavoretti temporanei aspettando il lavoro adeguato, ma ultimamente è proprio questo tipo di ""lavori"" che sono rari e pagati talmente poco che non ci puoi vivere. La crisi vera italiana è proprio nel settore ""temporaneamente faccio questo"", perché le piccole imprese (anche i ristoranti, ad esempio) ormai vivono con camerieri familiari, sottopagati e (molto spesso) in nero. E sono lavori ricercatissimi perché quelli che prima campavano in questo in maniera ""temporanea"" ormai lo fanno come lavoro fisso chiudendo ancora di più il mercato che è già fermo di suo...

Insomma, il salto nel buio te lo sconsiglio. Se hai già contatti allora è un altro discorso.

false,back-in-black,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; We can ask the same question. It is the British that hate Europe, the other way around is just a consequence of that.

I think you're lying to yourself, and you know it. Be honest for a moment, and take a look around this subreddit. The UKIP posters do not express hatred for the EU. Wanting to leave is not hatred. The UK tried to change the course of the EU and failed. We must now either leave or accept the reality that we will live in a federal state that most of us don't want. That is the UK position. 

I have not seen any of the UKIP posters say that they want the EU to fail, or have its people suffer, or see the EU break up, or state that they want punitive action against the EU after the split. I have not seen them negatively characterise the people of the EU as a whole, and say unpleasant things about them. 

But I have seen EU posters say all of the above about the UK. Unadulterated hatred. And your excuse for partaking in this is that ""the UK hates us too"", which is easy to see is completely false. Are you not ashamed of yourself? Hatred is never the right course of action, even if you feel it is justified, and in this case, it clearly isn't.

&gt; This is a self fulfilling prophecy, but all the UKIP voters certainly understand that don't they?

Poverty is quite high. There is a middle class affording western standards, but that's not the majority.

It depends on the city. Some cities are clean and tidy, some are not. Generally, they're much less tidy than Western Europe and slightly dirtier. :)

No, mainly due to corruption.

So-and-so. The quality varies by location. You can bet that the pre-unversitary education is incomparably better in Bucharest than in a small village.

No.

Definitely not.

Brauchen die Pädagogikstudien?

&gt; Volkshochschulen

Sind Mittel der Erwachsenenbildung, in denen man zum Beispiel Excel-Grundkurse machen kann, oder Salzteigzopfflechten. Dozent kann jeder werden. Wozu braucht man da ein Pädagogikstudium?

&gt; man mit dem Beruf einen Kredit problemlos abbezahlen kann?

Ja. Ich bin der Meinung, daß man sehr wohl für ein Studium 200€/Monat steuerfrei wird abbezahlen können. 

&gt; Meinst du weiterhin, dass man Bafög und den Kredit gleichzeitig beziehen kann (soll)?

BaFöG und diese Studienkredite sollten voneinander unabhängig sein - weil die Voraussetzungen unterschiedlich sind. Jedermann soll in meinem Modell einen Rechtsanspruch auf Studienkredite haben (wie heute beim AFBG) - auch Multimilliadäre. Rechtsanspruch auf BaFöG hat ein sehr eng definierter Personenkreis: Leute, die während des Studiums den Lebensunterhalt anders nicht bestreiten können.

Deshalb wäre es IMHO legitim, beide gleichzeitig zu beziehen.

&gt;  Es müssen mehr Berufe ohne Studienvoraussetzung vorhanden sein.

Woran machst Du das fest? Wenn ein Personalchef zwei Bewerbungen bekommt, eine mit Abitur und kaufmännischer Ausbildung, eine mit BWL-Studium ... dann wird er bereits heute abwägen, ob man einen Praktiker sucht oder einen Theoretiker. Die allerwenigsten Berufe haben wirklich eine Studiumsvorschrift (spontan fallen mir nur Apotheker, Ärzte und Anwälte/Notare/Richter ein).

&gt; Braucht man für die Arbeit in einem Museum o.Ä. ein Studium?

Nein. Restauratoren beispielsweise arbeiten rein handwerklich, und viele haben nie eine Uni von innen gesehen.

&gt; kann man heute absolut sicher sagen, dass man ohne ohne Studium genauso gut beruflich klarkommt wie mit?

Nein - und wenn dem so wäre, gäbe es ja auch keinen Anreiz des Studiums - oder der Fortbildung

Ein Studium ist eben *mehr* als nur ein Schulabschluß und eine Ausbildung: Studium = Schule + Ausbildung + Berufsbegleitende Fortbildung. 

Ein Elektrikergeselle ist eben kein Elektrotechnikingenieur (kann aber über entsprechende weitere Fortbildung zum Meister aufsteigen^1 und damit Elektrotechnikingenieurähnlicher werden - und als Elektromeister lebt es sich offenbar besser als als ausstudierter Ingenieur.

Übrigens: Diese Weiterbildungen zum Meister ... zahlt der Prüfling selbst. Und man könnte argumentieren, daß die Ausbildungsvergütung auch nur ein Trostpflaster ist und der Auszubildende eigentlich für die Ausbildung durch entgangenen Lohn zahlt.

Violence is not widespread, but traffic accidents are common. Unfortunately driving culture here is really bad. It is improving though.

&gt; Is poverty low and can most people afford reasonable standards?

Poverty is low in capital and in other cities, but rural areas are less developed. You can reach good living standard if you have ability to learn some basic skill.

&gt; Are cities clean and tidy?

Capital is quite clean, albeit not Vienna. Rural areas are not clean because cow shit and stuff.

You can do most of public services via internet, like start a company, taxes, whatever - I don't remember last time having to *go* somewhere.

&gt; Is education good in your country?

Pretty okay, there is weird system where ~50% of people study for free and the rest have to pay. If you want to study some over-popular thing, you are more likely to pay because you need better exam results. If you want to study something that is in demand, but there is shortage of people (i.e. computer science), you will likely not need to pay.

&gt; Is health care good in your country?

I personally cannot complain.

&gt;Are there high levels of social cohesion, and do people take care of common good and are mindful of others? (Like parking cars correctly, or not jumping the line, or not being loud as not to disturb other people in a restaurant or the bus.)

More in capital, less in other cities. Sometimes people seem to be rude, but it's just because everyone is grumpy, silent, and not very social, but they still genuinely want to help you.

&gt; Taking a cold and realistic view of your country, not hindered by stereotypes or preconceptions, is it reasonably good to live there? (This one is rather subjective.)

I would say so - I am 23 year old and have well paying job, can afford modern newly furnished 80 sqm apartment in the center of the capital and have plenty left for spending on nights out or other nice things, travel twice a year to anywhere and take days off just because I can.

false,falconberger,CZEC,Czechistan!,"&gt; Is violence widespread is your country, and are traffic accidents common?

I wouldn't say so, but there are of course occasional reports on violent crime and car accidents. I feel safe in Prague at night.

&gt; Is poverty low and can most people afford reasonable standards?

Depends on how you define poverty, but I'd say lots of people would consider themselves poor. I.e. they have food to eat but live wage-to-wage. I also noticed a significant increase of homeless people in Prague, it seems as if they doubled or tripled.

&gt; Are cities clean and tidy?

Somewhat clean but definitely not Switzerland-clean.

&gt; Are public services and/or products of your homeland efficient and reliable? (Any products, like softwares, for example.)

I'd say we have generally high-quality products, especially those made by companies founded in the last 10 years.

&gt; Is education good in your country?

Relative to the EU, I'd say average or below average. Relative to what I think education should look like, I think it's shit.

&gt; Is health care good in your country?

Same answer.

&gt; Are there high levels of social cohesion, and do people take care of common good and are mindful of others? (Like parking cars correctly, or not jumping the line, or not being loud as not to disturb other people in a restaurant or the bus.)

Hard to say, quite a broad question, most people are generally polite.

&gt; Taking a cold and realistic view of your country, not hindered by stereotypes or preconceptions, is it reasonably good to live there? (This one is rather subjective.)

I think Prague is a nice place to live. But I got bored of it somehow, perhaps it's time for a change :) The center is very nice, the suburbs are ugly because they were build by the communists.

&gt; Lastly, how beautiful is your country during Christmas season?

Some places in Prague are nice, some not, especially if there's melting snow, that can be quite ugly. Recently, I've been finding many Christmas decorations kitsch, ugly, lifeless, boring.

Aktuelles Beispiel: Frauenquote. Andere Beispiele beinhalten Sprache in öffentlichen DokumentInnen, Ampelfrauen. Dazu kommen Bildungspläne etc. 

&gt; Ich verstehe nicht, warum du Linke und Grüne in Sippenhaft nimmst. Mir persönlich zwingen die Grünen nichts auf, genausowenig wie die anderen gemäßigten Parteien. 

Dazu dies hier:

&gt;Doch diese Botschaft kommt anscheinend nicht bei allen an. So haben sich die Grünen in Baden-Württemberg um den ersten grünen Ministerpräsidenten Winfried Kretschmann gerade erst einige Änderungen der Landesbauordnung ausgedacht - und einiges von dem, was da zum 01. März 2015 in Kraft tritt, wird sehr wohl von vielen im Ländle als Bevormundung empfunden.
Fahrradständer - sie sollen künftig vor jedem Haus stehen.  Fahrradständer sollen künftig vor jedem Haus stehen.
So muss künftig jeder Häuslebauer für zwei Fahrrad-Stellplätze pro Wohneinheit sorgen, für Fahrradständer, die wettergeschützt sind und die Räder gegen Diebstahl sichern. Und wenn ein Neubau keine Gartenfläche vorweisen kann, muss das Gebäude begrünt werden, an der Fassade oder auf dem Dach.

Das nur dort, wo die Grünen in Regierungsverantwortung stehen. Von dem was die umgesetzt haben während sie an der Regierung waren, den völlig fehlerhaft gehandhabten Atomausstieg(nicht weil dieser schlecht wäre, die Umsetzung und gesetzliche Grundlage ist es), dazu die Massenüberwachung, Ottokataloge, Ökosteuern, Isolierungen, Energiewende, wo die damals überall dran mitgeschrieben haben ist wirklich nur der übelste, bevormundendste Mist herausgekommen. Auch die Verbote die man gern in Angriff nehmen würde, hat man die Beine endlich wieder breit genug gemacht für eine Regierungsbeteiligung, sprechen für sich.

 

&gt;Ich glaube aber auch, dass das liberale Ideal eines Staates, der sich nicht einmischt, eine Utopie ist, die schädliche Konsequenzen für Umwelt und Bürgerrechte hätte. Es gibt eben Regelungen, die zur Sicherung des Gemeinwohls durchgesetzt werden müssen. Nicht umsonst hat Neoliberalismus einen schlechten Ruf.

Das ist es nicht. Auch Modelle eines liberalen Staates kennen Allgemeingüter zu denen die Umwelt gehört. Der Unterschied ist eben, dass nur die Grundlagen bestimmt und dann auch mit aller Härte durchgesetzt werden. So besagt zum Beispiel das Verursacherprinzip im Umweltrecht, dass jeder der die Umwelt schädigt vollständig für die Behebung der Schäden aufzukommen hat.

Erst als einige Leute anfingen bestimmte Dinge dort zu regulieren, einige Schäden als nicht so schlimm und damit straffrei, andere als extrem schlimm und damit nicht mehr zumutbar zu deklarieren, kam es zu dieser völlig irrsinnigen Regulierung die wir heute haben. Nur wegen der Wegentwicklung vom liberalen Grundsatz gibt es heute sowas wie Fracking in Deutschland, natürlich mit Ausnahme der Wasserschutzgebiete. Hielte man sich nur an das Verursacherprinzip, wäre Fracking absolut unwirtschaftlich. Dann wäre Atomkraft unwirtschaftlich, weil niemand für die Lagerung bezahlen will. All diesen staatlich subventionierten oder legalisierten Unsinn würde es gar nicht erst geben, wenn der nicht überall seine Finger drin hätte, einfach weil die Grundsätze des liberalen und ökonomischen Denkens so etwas schon verbieten.

Der Neoliberalismus hat auch nichts mit dem zu tun was ich fordere. Der Neoliberalismus ist wie seine Schöpferin darauf angewiesen, dass der Staat tief eingreift. Wären auch hier liberale Grundsätze gegeben, würden Banken krachen gehen wenn man sich verzockt, würde es kein Zins und Schuldgeld staatlich verordnet geben. Es hatte seinen Grund warum die Gründer der USA eine Lockerung der Goldpreisbindung mit dem Tode bedrohten.

Nur durch staatliche Eingriffe kam es überhaupt erst zu diesen Missständen, weil der Staat aktiver Spieler ist und sich zum Instrument der Eliten macht. Es war immer so, es wird immer so sein.

&gt;Und dass die Rechtspopulisten der AfD uns ""in Ruhe lassen"" würden, ist auch nicht wahr. Allein der Ausstieg aus dem Euro hätte gravierende wirtschaftliche Konsequenzen, ganz zu schweigen von der angestrebten Abschaffung des EEG.

Was den Euro angeht glaube ich kaum, dass sich die AfD von allen anderen Parteien unterscheidet. Sobald man mit im Boot sitzt wird man nach ""langer, ausgiebiger Prüfung"" zu dem Schluss kommen im Euro zu bleiben. Vielleicht noch ein bisschen gegen Griechenland stänkern, aber das wars. Die Regierung ist längst nicht mehr unabhängig von den Märkten und der Akteuren, sowas wie einen Euroaustritt lassen die nicht zu. Das EEG indes muss weg und komplett neu geschrieben werden unter folgenden Prämissen: 1. Deutschland rettet das Weltklima nicht allein und 2. Der Klimazug ist bereits abgefahren, allein die bereits wissenschaftlich gesicherte Erwärmung der Erde wird katastrophale Folgen haben, ein Drosseln irgendwelcher Emissionen hat keinerlei Einfluss mehr auf das was kommt.

&gt;Jede Regierung, jede Partei fällt Entscheidungen, die mein tägliches Leben betreffen. So ist es nunmal, deshalb gehe ich ja wählen. Wenn du die AfD wählen willst, tu das. Obwohl ich vermute, dass du noch lieber eine Partei wählen würdest, die härter durchgreift.

Ich werde zwar die AfD wählen, mir aber keine Illusionen machen dies ändere irgendetwas. 

&gt;Ich gehe ja auch nicht wählen, damit es mir persönlich gut geht, sondern damit wir eine Gesellschaft entwickeln, in der ich und meine Mitmenschen sich zuhause fühlen können. Und dazu gehören auch Flüchtlinge und Migranten.

That is why there is no Palestinian state and there will not be one until Israelis and Palestinians can solve things to a point that they both are willing to end violence once and for all. And it is not just current leaders deciding to do so, it must also be the people willing to do so...

""A 2011 poll found that 61% of Palestinians opposed and 34% supported the idea of ""two states for two peoples."" Some 66% agreed with the two-state solution, but only as a first step to the elimination of Israel. Though quotes in the Hamas Charter urging the elimination of Israel were found to be highly supported, most Palestinians supported idea of peace talks over violence.""

Of course it is not totally impossible that Israel would just make an unilateral withdrawal from most of the West Bank as they did from Gaza and drawing new borders along the way on how it suites them. The problem of course on doing this is that this if done too hastily could lead to collapse of the Palestinian Authority in West Bank and rise of another Islamic lead regime in the area.

I have to say that if I would be Palestinian, I would take any peace with Israel because the terms only become worser year after year as there are more and more facts of the ground. But it might take a new generation of Palestinian leadership to actually take the peace, Abbas and the old guard are unwilling to go down in history as the people who made the peace and gave up the old areas.",0,1418740320,null,0,false,0,cmwjnlc,t3_2pgfji,t1_cmwjnlc,t1_cmwgqqm,null,1425372769,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

* There is no ""third side"" in the discussion present in the article that I am not representing in the title (ie this would potentially be editorialising by omitting a reference to a stance which I did not support)

As such, I am sorry, but I fail to see how this is editorialising in any way. If you feel strongly about it, please feel free to report the submission and let the mods decide.

Bzgl. Studienvoraussetzung:  
Ich bin der Meinung, dass das Studium heutzutage in dem Sinne einen zu hohen Stellenwert hat, als dass viele denken, dass man nur mit Studium vorwärts kommt, weshalb halb viele sich für die Uni und gegen eine handfeste Ausbildung entscheiden. Beispiel: Person A wägt ab zwischen BWL-Studium und kaufmännischer Ausbildung. Was wird ihm gegenüber attraktiver erscheinen? Das Theoriewissen des Studiums oder die Praxiserfahrung? Ich wage zu behaupten, dass sich viele für das Studium entscheiden, da Studienabschluss ""besser"" klingt als Gesellenbrief, aber ich kann keine Statistik dafür vorweisen. 

http://www.forschungsverbund-universitaetsgeschichte.uni-mainz.de/Bilder_allgemein/Diagramm_Studierendenstatistik.jpg sagt, dass die Uni Mainz zum Beispiel allgemein mehr Studenten hat, aber das kann unterschiedliche Gründe haben - kann auch einfach per Bevölkerungsänderung erklärt werden.

&gt;Die allerwenigsten Berufe haben wirklich eine Studiumsvorschrift 

Mein Unternehmen bspw. hat dieses Jahr 23 neue Studienplätze (reine Ausbildungsplätze weiß ich nicht exakt, aber es werden nicht viel mehr sein), 19 davon BWL-Versicherung. Andererseits sind das duale Studienplätze und an das Unternehmen gebunden und diesen liegen ja auch Ausbildungen zugrunde, deshalb trifft das vielleicht nicht zu.

Du möchtest also das Studium wieder etwas anzurren in dem Sinne, dass nur Leute studieren, die bereit sind dafür zu zahlen und nicht nur jeder planlos nach der Schule ein Studium anfängt in der Hoffnung, damit später was anfangen zu können? Dann wären Studiengebühren nur ein Teil der Rechnung, ein andere wäre, überhaupt erst einmal zu vermitteln, dass ein Studium nicht zwingend zum Erfolg führt und dass Ausbildungsberufe, wie du sagtest, auch zu Wohlstand, Karriere und sonstiger Bedürfnisbefriedigung führt.",0,1418741505,null,0,false,0,cmwk58u,t3_2pd0as,t1_cmwk58u,t1_cmwj4n4,null,1425372540,1,false,de,t5_22i0,1

There's always people here talking about Germany's bad memories from 1920's and 1930's inflation levels. How it scarred them and influences policy today. How about Russia? It wen't from collapse to collapse, even as recently as 20 years ago! And it's a highly militarized nation, with rampant nationalism, vivid memories of suffering and an almost institutional hatred for Western Europe. Already this is shaping up sinister contours internationally, in a escalating game of blame and provocation. With Russia and Europe gone, out goes the multipolar world. China and the US will be left to pick up the pieces, unchallenged. 

Not preparing for the worst this time could very well be our biggest regret as Europeans. The prospect of millions being irradiated due to the inadequacy of our leaders and lack of cooperation is very much on the table and is not just a nightmare scenario for video games. This could dwarf the economic woes of our generation.

The poorer states, as in Eastern Europe have actually been improving a lot over the last years, and even if results are not obvious keep in mind that some of them like Romania and Bulgaria joined in 2007 at the start of the global economic crisis.

The issue is that the EU has been doing everything it can, the problem is that national governments still retain the last word in all these issues and you have a situation with many countries using the Euro but all implementing different policies at different speeds. 

What is needed is not leaving the EU but rather more integration, at least for the countries which have the Euro. Here problems go as deep as corruption and partisan interests which cannot be tackled by the EU as it stands, but giving more power to the EU and to the ECB and removing some from national parliaments will help - this is already happening. 

As for the cohesion funds - basically giving money to poorer countries, is actually a no-brainer, these countries are not big exporters but rather big importers, for countries like Germany, UK and France who are huge exporters this means more money in the long run than they invest to begin with.

* dopo aver comprato due case (a roma sono comunque belle tasse annuali da pagare) e investito 100k euro, non avresti una rendita abbastanza soddisfacente per campare fino a 70 anni.
* io personalmente ho notato che quando non lavoro passo la mia giornata dormendo, bevendo, masturbandomi e disintegrandomi. Trovo il lavoro (o un impegno qualsiasi giornaliero) uno stimolo per rimanere in vita e impormi un minimo di decenza.
* vincendo un milione di euro comunque è difficile imporsi un tenore di vita simile al precedente. Itnendo che se oggi tu spendi mensilmente 500 euro al mese per vestiti, cibo, servizi, difficilmente con un tesoretto notevole tu non aumenteresti il tuo tenore di vita. Spendendo di più e quindi ti necessiterebbero più soldi. Se ci riesci buon per me ma:
* non c'è un limite massimo dei soldi che bastano. Se anche avessi sufficienti soldi da non lavorare, LAVOREREI proprio perché sono altri soldi incassabili da destinare all'aumento del mio tenore di vita. Avere soldi vuol dire volerne altri. Capisco sia un'idea fortemente capitalista, ma è così che si vive al giorno d'oggi.
In ogni caso probabilmente mi metterei in part time sul lavoro attuale e terrei l'altra mezza giornata per amministrare gli investimenti fatti (che è comunque definibile come ""lavoro"", quindi torniamo al fatto che il lavoro come definizione non lo interromperebbe nessuno).

false,Tom1099,POLA,Poland,"&gt;An other word for Ruthenian is Rusyn. 

The whole thing with Russia/Ruthenia/Rus/Rusyn etc. names is much clearer in Slavic languages than in English. See:

 The medieval country and its territory is 'Ruś', Russia is 'Rosja' in Polish. In English we end up with ""Kievan Rus'"" which is quite weird name in this language. Add to that English doesn't distinguish between Russian coming from 'Russia' and Russian from 'Rus'' or 'Ruthenia'. So there are things like ""Russian principalities"" on maps describing times before Russia came to be. In Polish the words are 'ruskie' and 'rosyjskie' respecively. 

And now there are Rusyns - in fact this term can apply to all Ruthenians (by this I mean people from Rus'/Ruthenia, so practically all Eastern Slavs) or can apply to just Carpathian Ruthenians/Ruthenes (one more word from the same root). 

Another thing is that Ruthenia is often used to describe the Red Ruthenia (Czerwona Ruś) - an area in Western Ukraine - instead of the whole Rus'. Or it can even mean the Transcarpathia in Ukraine

&gt; The term Ruthenian or Rusyn has pretty much the same meaning as Slavic.

For the second part of this statement: I can't agree. I could if you said 'Eastern Slavic', and that is a big difference.

&gt;For example Kievan Rusyn are the ancient Slavic people of the Ukraine, while the Bela Rusyn (Belarus) are the Slavic people of the white direction. 

Well, Kievan Rus' is a shared ancestry of three states, not one. Bela Rusyn - in English it's just White Ruthenians. ",0,1418743780,null,0,false,0,cmwl64g,t3_2pe1mg,t1_cmwl64g,t1_cmwex81,null,1425372062,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

false,KakosPhone,null,null,"- Is violence widespread is your country, and are traffic accidents common?
 I am not going to say that it is widespread, it is not an uncontrollable problem, yet it does exist. The police is very visible, though. Traffic accidents are quite frequent, since my country is quite small and you can travel far using only a small amount of time - therefore a lot of people do so. Thus, frequent accidents unfortunately. 

- Is poverty low and can most people afford reasonable standards?
  Poverty is very low, and is not an urgent problem. There are homeless people and people on transfer income, but it is a minority. Yet, many elders are not being helped properly, and it is a problem widely discussed by various political parties.¨

- Are cities clean and tidy?
  Mostly, but not as a rule. In my opinion, danes are not very good at keeping neither nature nor cities clean, sadly. 

- Are public services and/or products of your homeland efficient and reliable? (Any products, like softwares, for example.)¨
  I think so; I mostly feel safe using them. Most of them are free as well.

- Is education good in your country?
  That is a matter to be discussed, I believe. Education is free, but school for younger kids is very loose and ineffecient (IMO). Going to High School and University is free as well, and I like to believe that these two are quite good and efficient.

- Is health care good in your country?
  Again, it is free, and mostly good. I had cancer as a child, and I was well treated. There are scandals, but I think they are impossible to avoid. 

- Are there high levels of social cohesion, and do people take care of common good and are mindful of others? (Like parking cars correctly, or not jumping the line, or not being loud as not to disturb other people in a restaurant or the bus.)
  No, I do not find that. Danes are not very open towards each other, and people tend to have prejudices and xenophobic behaviour - of course with exceptions. I think Denmark has a very individual culture today, which is odd looking at our history as a nation.

- Taking a cold and realistic view of your country, not hindered by stereotypes or preconceptions, is it reasonably good to live there? (This one is rather subjective.)
  Yes, I think so. Very many services are free, and the system is mostly safe and structured. Poor people or people in need will be catched by the net of social security, that Denmark offers. 

- Lastly, how beautiful is your country during Christmas season?
  Well, filled with lights and plastic hearts on the streets - yet indoors, at least what I know of, you will find paper hearts, beautiful golden decorations, candles, sweets, sculptures, miniature landscapes etc. Denmark has great Christmas traditions! :)",0,1418743809,null,0,false,0,cmwl6lu,t3_2pgq64,t1_cmwl6lu,t3_2pgq64,null,1425372055,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
