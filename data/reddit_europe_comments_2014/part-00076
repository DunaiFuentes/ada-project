Especially if you want to attend a music festival or another event where large groups of people gather.  
And of course there are some bad areas in all of the big cities, although they are generally safer than their counterparts in the USA. This is mostly due to a difference in size. Germany just doesn't have cities so big that they could sustain huge crime ridden areas. 

(Attention: You will see what looks like towns of very small wooden houses with small gardens and vegetable patches. These are typically somewhere outside the main city/ town. Those are not shanty towns or ghettos. They are basically are small plots of land those living in the actual city can rent to have their own garden and weekend retreat)

It depends a little on your dialect and skincolor though. Especially in some rural towns in Eastern Germany there are a few racists that could give you an uncomfortable experience if you are anything but white. I have no idea why you would be visiting those though.

The thing is, most people are pretty content with the rights they have and your advice doesn't make much sense [to us around these parts]. 

What rights, precisely, are we lacking? We can move around. Own stuff. Do business, whatever. For most Russians it's okay and they don't see any more rights that need acquiring. What we want is to do business easier. What we want is less bureaucracy. What we want is better funded police that doesn't have to resort to bribes. What we want is a more professional medical staff at our gloriously free hospitals. Higher pensions. Higher salaries. This is seen as urgent, everything else seems irrelevant.

Corruption on the lower levels is somewhat institutionalized because that's how you grab your police force by the balls. You let them do corrupt things to feed themselves and that gives you leverage over them, because if they don't do stuff that you want to be done, you can throw them into prison on the basis of corruption charges. Easy. And that gives you power over the masses. That's what you do with lower-ranking officials to keep your hold on everything.

Most people don't care about free assembly because they are well-fed, clothed, entertained and content. Most people don't want to be able to own fire arms because duh, what are they, criminals? Most people don't care about gay rights because it's something out of movies. You see? Apathy. 

Apathy fostered by the turbulent 90-ies. 90-ies during which ""democracy"" and ""liberal"" became curse words here. And then some guy comes to power and brings stability. No more soldiers panhandling on the streets. No more red-jacket wearing New Russians doing mafia shoot-outs at nights. Guess why people like this new found stability more than some fairy-tale bullshit that didn't work out for them. Guess why the Iron Hand scored more than rambling alcoholic who let us bark but took away our food. That's why they are happy with how things are and all they want is more rubles and not rights, because they have just enough. 

When I look deep inside my soul all I see there is my racked up credit card debt and mortgage and not a proposition for a revolutionary bill of rights that will somehow turn Russia into large Norway or a slightly angrier Canada. And this goes for many of us. We aren't starving. We aren't being forced into some stupid ideology. We're content with the status quo. I, personally, don't want to have another putsch or revolution or whatever because IT SUCKS. IT SUCKS immensely living through a revolution. I'm all for gradual changes and growth, for evolution, for progress. The people in power will die out. People who were exposed to another way of thinking will take their place. 

Our constitution is okay, our laws are mostly okay, the problem is that the officials are corrupt as hell, on every level, and the rule of law isn't observed. The legal framework was always there, what we traditionally lack is good management. Maybe we should be a little less cynical, as a society. But this is something that doesn't grow overnight.

Since the production relied on free or super cheap raw materials coming from all around USSR, when the borders closed and the old distribution network collapsed, it simply became impossible to keep the factories running. Some factories managed to gather enough capital to buy materials at market price and found some markets to sell their stuff, but you have to remember that the markets also shrank considerably, since nobody wanted the shit being produced.

In USSR, you, as a manager of a company didn't need to worry about selling your product, since everything was deficit. But with the market opening to the west, but closing to the east, the products were simply unable to just compete. You had to sell your stuff. Therefore companies and their managers had to change their entire way of working, when the USSR collapsed.

Spain have specifically said that they will not veto Scotland's EU membership if Scotland becomes independent by means of a lawful process. 

The current process for independence for Scotland is a lawful one, with an agreement negotiated between the Scottish government and the UK government and specific legislation has been passed for the referendum. Therefore, if Scotland becomes independent, Spain will not veto Scotland's membership of the EU.

The situation with Catalonia is very different as the Spanish government is not allowing a lawful process.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Do you have a reference? The last thing I heard was Barroso saying that Spain is unlikely to approve Scottish membership since it even vetoes recognition of Kosovo until the present day.

Barroso did say something along those lines, but I think the big difference between Scotland and Kosovo is that Kosovo became independent outside a legal process with Serbia. Scotland is not planning on doing that.

[Here is an article which confirms that Spain considers that the Scotland situation is different from Catalonia](http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/politica/margallo-admite-que-espana-consideraria-entrada-una-escocia-independiente-3067209).

I'm not sure if you read Spanish, but the Spanish foreign minister essentially told the Financial Times (orginal behind a paywall) that Spain has no intention of interferring in Scottish independence and is ready to consider a Scottish application to join the EU as an independent state. I am going to trust the Spanish foreign minister here.

&gt; If a country does not allow for a lawful process for self-determination, then that is a good case for breaking the law. Even you, as a lawyer, can hardly claim that all law must be obeyed. 

I'd never claim that all law must be obeyed. There have been plenty of instances in human history in which laws should not be obeyed. I see the job of a lawyer to say what the law is and to advise on the legal consequences of breaking the law rather than to say that a law should necessarily be obeyed or not.

I agree, that outside a legal process for self-determination, an illegal process is the only option.

Tipo ""[nome azienda] is boat"" a Venezia, o altri esempi di inglese maccheronico che mo non mi vengono ma penso non siano difficili da trovare in Rete.

A me il sospetto viene anche perché la croce separa la A da Men (perché separare la parola ""Amen""?) e la ""M"" è grossa quanto la ""A"" ma più di ""en"", come se fosse in inizio di parola.

Poi eh, si può pure essere in disaccordo, ma secondo me non è improbabile ciò che ho detto.

tl;dr: So benissimo che ""men"" è plurale, ma a me pare che l'intenzione sia di fare un malriuscito gioco di parole su ""A-Men"".

**Edit: Purtroppo avevo ragione io.**

Da un'intervista al proprietario:

&gt;A Men, se permettete la licenza poetica e **l’errore voluto** (dall’inglese, A=un e Men=uomini), simboleggia l’unione dell’uomo con l’amen spirituale. Coniugazione ottenuta grazie alla Croce del Sud inserita nel logo che fa da trait d’union tra le due parole a voler trasformare l’Uomo in Amen. Una croce formata da stelle, sempre a voler riportare tutto al cielo e a tutto il suo significato.

Think about this logically, the election doesn't need to be clean to be influenced:

1. The vote presented a false dichotomy between joining Russia or restoring the '92 Ukraine constitution (which wasn't great for Crimea btw). 

2. A majority of people in Crimea are ethnic Russians. 

3. A good deal of people in Crimea are family of Russian soldiers stationed in Crimea. 

4. The Crimean tatars, which account for around 12% of the population and were most pro-Ukrainian/anti-Russian,  boycotted the referendum. 

5. Ukraine is up shit creek right now, so opportune timing for a secessionist referendum. 

6. All the major newspapers and outlets would be running a falsified referendum as the main story, can you find one that does instead of just down voting me?

2nd edit: **Here's what al-Jazeera had to say about the fairness of the referendum:**

&gt; As a result, the referendum was conducted without major problems; 83 percent of the population cast their vote and 96.7 percent of them - Russians, Ukrainians and even some Tatars - voted for secession from Ukraine and annexation to Russia.

And if Snowden deserves asylum....than people who's country just went through a chaotic revolution where dozens, if not hundreds, were killed and whom's country was just invaded and a part of such annexed, with the Russian military massing on their Eastern border as well....*don't deserve the same treatment you propose for Snowden*.

This two departments have destroyed nearls every horror movie and videogame. Why is a movie x-rated when there are 20 min missing of the original movie? Why do I have to order a lot of things in austria? Because they don't ban things, oh no they index them. Which means you are not allowed to advertise them and you must asure that you can only buy them in a section not accessible for minors. Because that would mean the producing company would not make any money with its product they provide a ""X-rated"" version for the german market. Here are some examples for videogame-indexing:  
- ragdoll effect  
- severable body parts  
- too much animated blood  
Here is an example for a movie: ""I spit on your grave"" (the new one) is 25 min shorter in the german x-rated version than in the international x-rated version. How do they protect young people if the product is clearly not aimed at them? Its just adult-censorship under the pretext of youth-protection.

Especially when you factor in the fact you're going up against **Russia**. It's not Libya and Mali *(which both required differing levels of United States support)*, it's a advanced and powerful nation with technology, while lacking in many regards, are still somewhat on par, especially when it comes to Anti-Aircraft Defenses. 

So not only do you need to purchase more strategic airlifters and airborne refueling tankers, but you also need things like drones for reconnaissance/intelligence and F-35s for stealth *(because most other planes going into a Russian-controlled airzone are probably going to have a bad day if Russian SAMs haven't been eliminated)*. 

Personally, and this is my armchair general opinion, it's going to be very hard to develop the capabilities to do all that if you're not spending at least 2% of your GDP on the military;  so the lack of spending and the lack of general plan go hand-in-hand, and once again in my opinion, it's hard to have one when you lack the other.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; Would you concede that this applies to the Crimean referendum under Russian supervision, considering that a nationalist government in Kiev is unlikely to provide for a lawful process of secession for Crimea?

In general, a unilateral declaration of independence is, I think, justified only after all legal and diplomatic efforts have been tried and have failed. 

I don't think Crimea have really reached that point yet. The new Kiev government is only a few weeks old and it is planned that there will be new Ukrainian elections relatively soon. We don't know what that new government will look like. I think it would have been better for the Crimean government to have waited a little longer and agreed the process with the next (democratically elected) Ukrainian goverment.  Also, it would have been better if this Crimean referendum weren't being boycotted by a particular ethnic minority within Crimea and there weren't Russian troops within Crimea and that this referendum weren't being supervised by Russia.

Personally I think that in the long term it probably does make sense for Crimea to be part of Russia rather than Ukraine in the longer term. But I think that too much has gone wrong with the current process, so I think that, on balance, the West is correct not to recognise the referendum.

Having said that, perhaps my expectations and standards are unrealistic. What manages to work between Scotland and England (which are, whatever their faults, mature and stable democracies which have gone through a slow and continuous transition of constitutional change lasting 100s of years) is unlikely to work for Crimea.",0,1395057653,null,0,false,0,cg4o93d,t3_20ic1y,t1_cg4o93d,t1_cg4nvyt,null,1432943395,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt;It is a plane designed for conflict with a technologically inferior opponent.

I disagree, I contend that the F-35 is one of the *few* real options available in a conflict versus Russia. 

And I actually hear the opposite complaint, that the F-35 is a plane overly-designed for a conflict that'll probably never happen *(I.E. China &amp; Russia)*. And this sentiment I hear very strongly from Europeans, who insist that F-18s, Grippens and Eurofighters are sufficient for the guerillas/jihadists in Mali, CAR and Libya, and that the F-35 would be a waste of money. 

I think that is a view which has been dispelled in the last week. 

And, in my opinion, the F-35 has a much higher survivability than *any of those planes* when in contested airspace, especially contested Russian airspace. 

&gt;Even 1% of GDP would be fine - onyl for the EU, this would be ~0.13 trillion EUR. This would be more than russia could ever dream of.

Which would be great...*if the EU had a integrated military and a cohesive foreign policy*, but it doesn't, so you don't know who's going to be willing to contribute to what or at what level of readiness they are. 

Look at Libya, countries which were spending 1% of their GDP weren't fine, they were reduced to dropping cement training bombs after their logistical lines gave out and before the United States got fully into play. Even Britain couldn't prop up the rest of it's European allies in the operation. Mali also sticks out, because even though France required *much, much less* military support from the United States, *it still required it*, especially in the regards of logistics and intelligence.

C'est expliqué [ici](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/t6v30/ama_request_je_soutiens_le_fn/). Vous ne donnez absolument aucune envie de venir s'exprimer ici, et répondre à 15 personnes qui vont te répéter toujours les mêmes mensonges déjà entendus cent fois à la télé en te traitant de raciste, ça n'est pas évident.

En particulier [ce commentaire](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/t6v30/ama_request_je_soutiens_le_fn/c4khfil) résume un peu tout.

&gt;Il y a 7 downvotes à l'article maintenant, seulement 2 commentaires (edit: bon 6 et 3 maintenant!): celui de BonConseil upvoté 4 fois, downvoté Zéro... 

N'importe quoi, je me fais systématiquement downvoter pour mes opinions. Faut arrêter votre délire.

D'ailleurs, ton commentaire est upvoté alors qu'il est insultant. Le mien est dans le négatif alors qu'il est sourcé...

Mais ça devrait te faire plaisir : un des moyens faciles pour gagner facilement du karma sur /r/france, c'est de me répondre en disant le contraire. Pas besoin d'argumenter, pas besoin de sourcer, un petit ""nauséabond"" suffit, si nécessaire ajouter ""la vraie nature du FN"" et le succès est garanti.

Serve il certificato di conformità europeo. Una roba che in Italia resta alla motorizazione mentre qui tutti hanno nei documenti della macchina. Mah. Mille telefonate e mi rassegno a ordinarlo dal sito renault. 150 euri. E mi chiedo: che cazzo certifica se si può ordinare on line?

Poi si va alla dogana che si sta importando ""un bene"". Il ""bene"" è una clio del 2003 usata. Tenete presente che si possono esportarw 15000 euri cash senza rotture di cazzo.

Però ok. Prendi le ferie e vai alla dogana. E siamo a due giorni di ferie che uno era per chiedere alla motorizzazione belga come fare.

Poi non è chiaro se serve o meno un controllo tecnico per vedere se la macchina è un regola con le norme *europee*. Ribadisco: renault clio, mica robe indiane.

Ma ora ho il dilemma. Assiurazione italiana e revisione sono scadute (e in ogni caso la seconda invalida la prima). E come la porto a fare questo controllo che forse serve o forse no?

Venerdì prossimo ho preso le ferie e chiedo in assicurazione belga se me l'assicurano un giorno per il controllo.

Ah, non ricevo l'attestato di rischio da 2 anni... Quindi forse dovrò ripartire dal livello più alto...

Tutto per quanti? 1500 euro di macchina? Parcheggiata da mesi? (a 90 euri il mese eh).

Poi dovrò smontare la targa e portarla al consolato (=ferie) per non pagare il bollo...

Das sich Richter und Staatsanwalt einig sind, heisst noch nicht, dass das Gesetz von ihnen auch ordentlich/richtig ausgelegt wird. Daher gibt es Präzedensfälle und immer höhere Instanzen, wobei man sagen kann, dass zum Beispiel ein Bundesgerichtshof sehr genau abwägt, meist viel genauer als ein Landesgericht.

Und die Quelle des Materials ist natürlich relevant, denn im Fall Edathy geht es nicht um die Heimlichkeit der Beschaffung für die Strafverfolgung, sondern um das Auftauchen seiner E-Mail bei einem Kinderpornohändler bei denen er Kunde war. Da muss sich die Frage stellen, welches Material er da erworben hat, handelt es sich tatsächlich um Material ""Stufe 2"", was immer das rechtlich genau aussagt, dann wird er ja keine rechtlichen Konsequenzen fürchten müssen. Wobei sich bei so einer Quelle auch die Frage stellen muss, wie das Material entstanden ist. Denn auch wenn etwas natürlich aussieht, heisst das nicht, dass es nicht unter Zwang entstanden ist.

Dass er in der Öffentlichkeit schlecht darsteht, ist eben seinem Handeln geschuldet, sowohl über die Wege der Beschaffung als auch das Versteckspiel das er jetzt vor der Öffentlichkeit betreibt. Hätte er eben aus ich nenn es mal Massenkaufhäusern Fotobände mit ähnlichem Material erworben, wäre die Empörung der Öffentlichkeit vllt. nicht in dem Maße vorhanden, wie sie es jetzt ist, bzw. würde sich die Empörung vllt. gegen eben diese Händler wenden. 

Ich habe nicht ausgesagt, das alles was es auf Amazon zu kaufen gibt, automatisch auch legal sein muss, ich habe von dem Beispielkünstler Sturges gesprochen, dessen Werke geprüft wurden und für rechtlich unebenklich erachtet werden. Es gibt viele Künstler die Akte von Kindern gemacht haben und darüber gab es auch mehr als genug Gerichtsverfahren die geprüft haben, ob es sich dabei um Kunst oder eben Pornographie handelt und wie dies zu bewerten ist.
Doch ich denke wenn man Fotobände im deutschen Handel kauft, die von großen Verlagen vertrieben werden, kann man erstmal davon ausgehen, dass dieses Material legal ist, was man bei einer Quelle wie die von Edathy wohl nicht in diesem Maße erwarten kann. Er hätte solche Fotobände eben auch beim Buchhändler um die Ecke bestellen können, weil es sich eben da um von rechtlicher Seiter anerkannter legaler Kunst handelt.

On the other hand, let's try some math.... I am translating ethnic sizes to comparable eligible voter groups. So... 58% russian majority in crimea, 12% tatars, which leaves us 24% of ukrainians and 6% other.

It was reported that 80% of voters actually voted, with 96% voted for russia. Logically, let's split these numbers, let's say that:

* 58% russians voted for russia
* 6% others voted for russia

Which makes up 64% of voters. Let's say 12% tatars didn't turn up to vote. So the left 16% that voted must have been of ukrainian ethincity (when 12% tatars that didn't vote are counted in, and another 8% of ukrainians to make the 80% voter turn up). 

Am I to believe that around 320.000 ukrainians voted **for** russia? Is that the logic I'm supposted to follow? That's **66%**, two fucking thirds of ukraininan population...

Please do not insult my intelligence, as well as intelligence of others here, by trying to find ""sources"". What sources do you want when you dissed all the mainstream media in your ""logical"" view of situation? 

What sources, I am not blind, nor deaf.

I think the F-35 is the best option in any war with Russia. We can send in drones for saturation attacks, but when you need a man in the air, a dog-fighter, or simply a delicate operation executed, there just isn't any replacement. 

Plus, unlike the F-18 or Eurofighter, one of the [F-35's capabilities is the ability to network with a number of drones](http://thediplomat.com/2014/01/uavs-and-the-f-35-partners-in-air-power/), thus it can use drones like missile trucks to fulfill those mass-wave attacks to overwhelm Russian SAM defenses that you're referencing. 

And keep in mind, we're not under-buying the F-35 like we did with the F-22, hell, [the United States ALONE plans to buy up to 2,400 F-35s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-35), and if our allies stick to their guns, they're supposed to acquire up to 3,100 F-35s on top of that as well.

Questa è la mia opinione, e ammetto che ci sono svariati motivi validissimi per cui un uomo adulto vive ancora con i propri genitori (genitori che obiettivamente hanno di bisogno, ad esempio, o essere totalmente disoccupati), ma **spesso i motivi che ci si da per rimanere a casa dei genitori non sono così validi**.

Arrivati ad un certo punto bisogna assumere la responsabilità di sapere gestire la propria situazione finanziaria (avere delle priorità: devo gestire i soldi, per pagare l'affitto viene prima di comprare il nuovo smartphone, oppure sapere scegliere di farmi due spaghetti piuttosto che mangiare fuori ogni sera, e allo stesso tempo mettere dei soldi di lato se possibile), sapere gestire la propria vita quotidiana (non sai cucinare? non sai fare il bucato? non sai cosa fare se hai un problema nell'appartamento?), e insomma **essere un adulto responsabile**. I tuoi genitori hanno compiuto il loro dovere, ora spetta a te essere un membro produttivo della società. Spesso si cercano delle scusanti per restare a casa, ma la maggior parte sono solo delle scusanti. Molti prima di noi, con molto meno di noi, ci sono riusciti, ma noi invece, beh, ci si culla con la speranza di trovare quel lavoro che paga €2500 al mese. 

Hai un lavoro? Allora usa i tuoi soldi per vivere la tua vita, e smetti di usare i soldi dei genitori. Stai dai tuoi perché non hai un lavoro, forse stai aspettando un lavoro ""dignitoso"" della tua laurea? Mentre stai aspettando, vai a fare il cameriere o un altro lavoro. Se vivi indipendentemente con i propri soldi troverai la motivazione per migliorarti. Più si rimane a casa, più difficile sarà lasciarla. I tuoi hanno bisogno di te? Beh, non significa che non li vai a fare visita o che non ci sei se hanno bisogno di un passaggio o per fare una commissione. Anche loro devono superare la paura del sindrome del nido vuoto. 

Ripeto: ci sono dei motivi *assolutamente validi* per stare a casa. Ma spesso siamo noi stessi a legittimare i motivi che noi diamo alla situazione. Su 5 persone che conosco in questo tipo di situazione, solo 1 ha forse veramente un motivo legittimo. Gli altri parlano di:

- **""tempi duri""** (sono sempre stati dei tempi duri, chiedi a tuo padre, i tuoi zii, i tuoi nonni), 
- **aspettare di trovare il ""lavoro giusto""** (sai? probabilmente non troverai mai il lavoro giusto per te, quello ideale, e dovrai sapere essere flessibile nella vita e accontentarti del lavoro che trovi - e se non cerchi, non trovi; non aspettare che un lavoro ti si viene ""dato"" o offerto)
- **""purtroppo mia madre ha bisogno di me""** (se è a letto e non si muove, allora sì. se è perché non sa guidare e la devi portare tu in giro, beh, non è una scusa secondo me!), 
- **""non ce la faccio proprio con lo stipendio che ho""** (se hai uno stipendio, forse devi imparare a gestirti un po' meglio, riconoscendo che non è un tuo diritto comprare vestiti nuovi ad ogni cambio di stagione, o di fare lo spavaldo).

Per non parlare dell'indipendenza, della privacy... Devo ancora spiegarmi?

&gt;The Commission is modeled on the European Commission.[5] The headquarters of the commission will be in Moscow, and the expenses of the infrastructure and accommodation of commission workers will be financed by Russia, while in general the commission budget will be financed by all three countries and dependent on taxation shares received from the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia.[6] The existing three-country ECU represents a market of some 165 million people, and a combined GDP of around $2.3tn.

I know this is all crude wiki linking but there are some other discussed [integration links/projects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Union#Existing_integration_projects)

&gt;The Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia has already brought partial economic integration between the three states, and the Eurasian Economic Union is said to be a continuation of this customs union. A number of other regional organisations also provide the basis for further integration: the Union State of Russia and Belarus, the Eurasian Economic Community of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, consisting of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan, and the Commonwealth of Independent States comprising most of the post-Soviet countries.

&gt;Armenia, whose economy has been crippled by a blockade imposed by arch-enemy Turkey, has been a staunch Russian ally. It has depended on Russian loans and hosted a major Russian military base.[19] Kyrgyzstan's U.S. air base, - a key for supporting operations in nearby Afghanistan, - is now being shut down under Russian pressure. Kyrgyzstan also hosts a Russian air base, which is set to expand.[19] Tajikistan, one of the poorest ex-Soviet nations on Afghanistan's northern frontier, hosts an estimated 5,000 Russian troops and depends on Russian economic aid and remittances from migrants working in Russia.[19]

The Americans defend their interests anywhere in the world, especially where there is oil and other coveted resources. But they would never annex Iraq, they would never give any conquered nation American citizenship. 

Russians on the other hand are not driven by mercantilism. For them annexing territories is the only way to prove their greatness. When they see some weak nation on their borders, they annex as much as they can, they expel the natives to Siberia, they move Russians to the new territory, and voila, new clay. They have been doing this for hundreds of years.

&gt;The Island was a British Military and Naval station directly opposite the Zone. England holds the Island on yearly rent-free lease, and every year the Lease and Permit of Residence is formally renewed. The entire population turns out--attendance is compulsory--and gathers at the municipal dump. The President of the Island is required by custom to crawl across the garbage on his stomach and deliver the Permit of Residence and Renewal of the Lease, signed by every citizen of the Island, to The Resident Governor who stands resplendent in dress uniform. The Governor takes the permit and shoves it into his coat pocket: 

&gt;""Well,"" he says with a tight smile, ""so you've decided to let us stay another year have you? Very good of you. And everyone is happy about it? ... Is there anyone who isn't happy about it?""

&gt;Soldiers in jeeps sweep mounted machine guns back and forth across the crowd with a slow, searching movement. 

&gt;""Everybody happy. Well that's fine."" He turns jovially to the prostrate President. ""I'll keep your papers in case I get caught short. Haw haw haw."" His loud, metallic laugh rings out across the dump, and the crowd laughs with him under the searching guns.

Like It or not (and it sounds like you dont like it) in the EU we have the highest standards of living, and enjoy a consensus about human rights and not settling things by invading each other. 

Is It perfect? no, the strasbourg to brussels thing is ridiculous, as is CAP, as are other stupid things when states get greedy. Personally I think we should be allowed to limit immigration between each other to a certain degree But we are so fucking far ahead of Russia and its puppet &amp; client states economically, and in human developement terms its laughable to even think about. The Ukraine with the EU has the chance to be a strong country that stands on its own feet, as opposed to being forced to trade with russia at a discount or get starved and threatened with gas.

true,TheMemo,null,null,"So where will it end? It's pretty obvious that the EU and the US won't engage Russia at all, lest they start WW3, which gives Russia carte blanche to act aggressively, knowing there will be no serious ramifications. Nuclear weapons are useless if you don't have the will to use them, or put yourself in a situation where they have the potential to be used (any serious conventional war between nuclear powers).

It reminds me of the 'Salami Tactics' episode of Yes, Prime Minister: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX_d_vMKswE

The amusing thing about that episode is that our nuclear deterrent isn't a nuclear deterrent at all, given that all the highly secret information about it was given to the Russians by the US a few years ago (in exchange for various concessions), and Russia has probably sold that on to everyone else by now, rendering our nukes largely useless as a defensive measure. As such, the only purpose for them are as a 'fire first' measure. Which we have taken off the table, out of the room, and thrown into the ocean.

&gt; Russia is on a downward spiral, let it fail without giving Putin the excuse he needs to blame the West.

Because what we completely need is a failed state with nuclear weapons. Of course! What could be better for security and stability than that? We're still looking for a load of nuclear materiel that is unaccounted for when the USSR fell, so I'm sure things won't get any worse!

The real problem with nuclear weapons is not that they could cause the destruction of the world, it is that their very existence will inevitably cause the destruction of humanity, by virtue of the fact that they maintain the status quo and, in so doing, offer a tactical advantage to those willing to act aggressively or irrationally (NK or Russia). Worse still, while maintaining the current hegemony, they make revolution and significant social and political change in nuclear-armed countries more dangerous and, as a result, less likely (due to increased security, citizen monitoring, and so on) - locking such countries and their client states into their chosen political and social systems, regardless of how appropriate they are to changing circumstances. Without that leeway, that ability to change rapidly to accept new political, economic and social realities, the world is stuck replaying the same bit of tape over and over again, each repeat significantly more expensive than the last. As long as this continues, humanity will probably waste away as a result of the continuing divergence of political systems and human need, eventually resulting in - as we have already seen - revolutions and general turmoil, which will eventually overcome even the nuclear states.

About 1/4th-1/5th of the population of both countries lives near capitals, with only 80km of water in between. Ferries go ever 15 minutes and most of Tallinn's city center places offer services also in Finnish language. Elderly people are looking to buy cheaper Estonian houses/apartments for retirement. Many businesses are opening offices in the other city (movement happens both ways), there's already tax regulations in place that are interdependent of the two cities because many people migrate for jobs. Even the public transportation was recently better organized to work together. It's cheaper to rent a flat in Tallinn and fly to work in Helsinki. The wage and cost difference is just too great at the moment, but the potential for cooperation is certainly huge. 

I know a girl who moved to Finland and after 1 month could hold conversations in Finnish, it's more complicated the other way around, but still, think of the possibilities...

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; i am indifferent towards European Union, i do not think its some devil incarnate nor a heaven for everyone. I do think however, that if you are weak economically and lack vision and desire to improve your country, you might get the rough end of the stick the same way some countries already had a pleasure to experience. Ask their citizens if they see future in their respective countries or any prospects of improvement, ask if European Union has answers or methods to improve situation there and not leave people to poverty or immigration.

I have many friends that come from eastern European countries and they all think that EU has done lots of good for their countries: and this is very understandable as EU is funding everything from motorways to culture, not to mention that due to EU citizens from these countries have had the ability to move all over EU. Not to mention that some people, especially Romanians see the EU as the only force to repair their countries as their political elite is so corrupted that without outside help no change will ever happen.

Now if you talked about countries such as Portugal, Spain, Greece and Cyprus, these countries are in trouble because they had an economic bubble, however the thing is that without the EU and without EU funds, they would be lot more poorer than they now are. Spain for example was almost going to become a net payer thanks to decades of EU funds to help the Spanish to build their economy.

&gt; Business opportunities are fantastic, but starting conditions are different (think civ 5 if u played it). Germany is strong and it is very hard to compete with them on pretty much anything that they produce with their several centuries old industrial school/tradition (i am not blaming them, their work ethic is admirable). Other countries has other strengths, so if you open your market for their products, you can expect for local production to go under. You know what comes next, so if you do not have a plan how to employ millions, perhaps you d better get one first, then execute this plan and theeen join political and economical unions from position of strength, not as banana republic. 

Lots of work has been moved or outsourced to Eastern European countries where it has taken the place of old industries that were not and would never have been competitive in global market.

In my honest opinion the only way to build competitive economy is to face global markets from the day one without subsidies. Domestic companies either handle it or not, if they are replaced by foreign companies that has largely happened in retailing and banking, then that is positive development as those foreign entities have been more competitive and thus been able to offer better services for the rest of the economy.

&gt; This is not unique problem but a global one and Russia has plenty of outright shitty or useless jobs who are not competitive or has any chances on global market (i'm looking at you AVTOVAZ). There is a lot of incoming unemployment to be experienced with automation of previous workforces alone, (if you add here competitiveness and possible crisis its even worse) this people need a job. What kind of job ? How do you teach millions ? What will be needed in several years? How much do you pay? Who will do all of that? Where do you get money for this ?

The answer is again let the market do their job. If people don't have skills that are in demand or the investment environment friendly enough then their wages have to go down until equilibrium is achieved. In case of Russia foreign companies would gladly invest into Russia if the business environment and especially the government was more stable and less corrupt. For example many Finnish pulp and paper companies have tried to invest to Russia, but due to erratic local government officials, they have deemed it too risky thus preferring to invest in southern America. Do note that if you are going to build a pulp or paper mill, the company doing the investments needs to be sure on what is going to happen in the next 20-30 years and be sure that nothing jeopardizes their investment.

&gt; Now on to what i consider evil and hostile to Russia and Russian interests, which is NATO, led by United States of democracy. Having lived my whole life in Russia and Russian information field, i saw over and over again how we were tricked, lied to, condemned, ignored or spat on. What you might see as separate events non connected to each other, i see as a continuing efforts to undermine Russian interests or concerns. You and i can be as friendly and peace loving to each other, respect each other and wish for us the best, but this means jack shit when it comes to policymakers. I look at Western actions and see a continuation of Cold war era policies, with an end goal to put a gun next to Russia's head (maybe there is more, i don't know). Open map of Europe, look at Ukraine and realize that Ukraine in NATO is a gun next to Russia's head, or since you are finnish, a knife next to throat. Now, how do you like to live with such prospects? 

Have you ever thought that Europeans regard Russia as a loaded gun against it? For example when Russia and US had dispute about US missile defense system, what happened was that Russia located short range nuclear missiles to Kaliningrad that are pinpointed towards Europe. Not to mention that Russia has a huge nuclear arsenal multiple times bigger than European states together have. Russia is the loaded gun for Europeans, that is why eastern European countries joined the NATO and EU, and that is why Ukraine is also going to join both organizations.

&gt; There are other issues, but this is my view on what is European Union and what awaits us in the future. 

I would like to add that thanks to Russian invasion to Crimea regardless do the locals want it or not will make the EU to speed up its efforts to form a unified European army. If Russia would invade eastern Ukraine, this would even further make this transformation more hasty... 

Have you ever wondered how would you feel if you would have a neighbor with 500 million inhabitants and who is economically and technologically superior to you and that has armed forces triple the size of yours, and who shares the same border from Black Sea to Barents Sea?

&gt; This is amazing to watch from Russian perspective. And now to last thing which i hate the most about Western world - unreal, outstanding, infinite hypocrisy. I fucking ""love"" reading Western media outlets or politicians, when they start to talk about corruption, or how Russia is bad because :""insert here"". 

The idea to this date has been that by integrating economies and enabling Russians to do business in the west, it will in long term liberalize the Russian economy and society, thus enabling it to transform to a modern democratic state. Unfortunately it seems that this idea has been largely wrong in the case of Russian political elite. However the thing is that declaring a cold war against Russian political elite would also hurt ordinary Russians so that isn't something that should and would lightly chosen as a policy.",0,1395066633,null,0,false,0,cg4qsqv,t3_20jkie,t1_cg4qsqv,t1_cg3zcj1,null,1432944660,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Parmi les choses qui sont dites et diffusées, il y a des rumeurs. En faire une stratégie massive comme tu le fais, avec un bureau d'études de rumeurs et des soldats chargés de les diffuser, c'est ne pas comprendre comment les choses fonctionnent.

&gt;les élites mentent, mais pas assez... et leur mensonges sont crédibles/pas évident... alors que faire? Tiens on va mentir mais mieux!

Il y a plus de sens dans la rumeur du 9-3 que dans n'importe quelle mesure du gouvernement sur l'immigration. C'est pas tellement le caractère mensonger qui m'interpelle. Il est évident la plupart du temps.

C'est le fait que c'est une réponse à un adversaire beaucoup plus puissant et disposant de moyens institutionnels pour diffuser sa propagande. Par contre, il ne peut rien contre le bouche à oreilles et les réseaux sociaux.

Voilà :

&gt; les immigrants jouent un rôle décisif dans la croissance économique à long terme

Faux : 

Le rapport complet est [ici](http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/economics/oecd-economic-surveys-european-union-2012_eco_surveys-eur-2012-en#page1). L'OCDE préconise de diminuer largement les allocations familiales, chômage et retraite. Dans ces conditions, l'immigration est souhaitable et bénéfique. Dans ces conditions seulement.

&gt;le travail des immigrés ne « concurrencerait » qu’une fraction du salariat issu des anciennes vagues d’immigration

À nouveau faux. Cela a été prouvé [au Royaume-Uni](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9004733/Immigation-does-keep-Britons-out-of-jobs-government-committee-admits.html), pour l'immigration hors-UE. Par contre, dès qu'on prend en compte l'immigration intra-UE, les chiffres changent.

C'est [la même chose en France](http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2012/06/15/les-descendants-d-immigres-plus-exposes-au-chomage-que-les-immigres_1719482_3224.html), il faut distinguer les immigrés hors-UE des autres dans les études.

&gt;Si la France optait pour une « immigration zéro », ce n’est pas 3 % du PIB supplémentaire qu’il faudrait trouver à l’horizon 2050 pour financer la protection sociale, mais 5 % du PIB

Comme déjà dit ailleurs, et confirmé par l'OCDE, l'immigration a en France un impact négatif sur les recettes fiscales. S'en servir pour justifier un gain est donc absurde. Et encore une fois, on oublie de comptabiliser le coût en infrastructure et en intégration. Voir par exemple [cette étude au Royaume-Uni](http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/6869/1/MPRA_paper_6869.pdf).

Et c'est ce que rappelait Maurice Allais, le seul prix Nobel français d'économie :

*Les raisonnements économiques sur l'immigration sont ici généralement tout à fait superficiels . C'est un fait que dans les différents pays, le capital national reproductible est de l'ordre de quatre fois le revenu national. Il en résulte que lorsqu'un travailleur immigré supplémentaire arrive, il faudra finalement pour réaliser les infrastructures nécessaires (logements, hôpitaux, écoles, universités, infrastructures de toutes sortes, installations industrielles, etc....) une épargne supplémentaire égale à quatre fois le salaire annuel de ce travailleur. Si ce travailleur arrive avec une femme et trois enfants, l'épargne supplémentaire nécessaire représentera suivant les cas, dix à vingt fois le salaire annuel de ce travailleur, ce qui manifestement représente pour l'économie une charge très difficile à supporter*.

&gt;le taux d’activité entre des étrangers de 30 à 49 ans et des Français du même âge est sensiblement identique (90 % et 95 %)

Encore une fois, [distinguer UE et hors-UE](http://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/actualite-presse,42/breves,2137/etudes-recherches-statistiques-de,76/etudes-et-recherches,77/publications-dares,98/dares-analyses-dares-indicateurs,102/2012-077-emploi-et-chomage-des,15556.html) : 

*La participation des immigrés au marché du travail est comparable à celle des non immigrés pour les hommes. Elle est nettement plus faible, mais en progression, pour les femmes, en particulier pour celles originaires du Maghreb ou de Turquie. Le taux de chômage des immigrés nés hors de l’Union européenne est beaucoup plus élevé que celui des non immigrés. En 2011, il approche 23 % pour ceux originaires du Maghreb ou d’Afrique subsaharienne, contre 8,5 % pour les non immigrés.*

&gt;Il n'y a pas plus d'immigrés aujourd'hui qu'avant

Les immigrés n’ont ""jamais été aussi nombreux"". En proportion, c'est à peu près stable. En nombre total c'est vrai : Selon les recensements partiels de l’INSEE, il y avait 3 771 000 étrangers en France en 2009 contre 3 338 000 en 1999, chiffre auquel il faut rajouter les naturalisations.

&gt;Les expulsions n'ont pas ralenti sous Hollande

Les expulsions ""ont ralenti"" sous François Hollande : [Source](http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2013/10/08/01016-20131008ARTFIG00588-clandestins-la-police-francaise-relache-son-effort.php).     

Extrait : le rythme moyen d'éloignement des étrangers en situation irrégulière est passé de 100 personnes par jour l'an dernier à 60 par jour pour les huit premiers mois de l'année

&gt;Être pour l'immigration est de gauche, et vice versa

Les immigrés ""servent le grand patronat"" : [Rapport du CAE](http://ingiagzennay.free.fr/Immigration-Gilles-Saint-Paul.pdf).

Un petit rappel de [Francis Bouygues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5dsEMl_F0Y)...

D'ailleurs, [Georges Marchais en 1981](http://www.bvoltaire.fr/robertmenard/identitaire-de-gauche,2478) était très clair là-dessus.

&gt;L'immigration ne fait pas baisser les salaires

[Rapport du CAE](http://ingiagzennay.free.fr/Immigration-Gilles-Saint-Paul.pdf). C'est prouvé partout pour les emplois non qualifiés. Dans ce cas, soit l'immigration empêche la hausse des salaires (l'immigré n'a pas le choix) soit elle augmente le chômage.

Which is exactly why you need to rev up your military spending and integrate more so we have less influence over you. :) And as I mentioned above, those bullshit projects you pointed out arn't so *""bullshit*"" after Crimea. :) 

&gt;EU went to Iraq and they also went to Afghanistan along with the US. So whats the problem? That they still request logistics support from US? Well, US requested logistic support from Russia and Pakistan during their gig in Afghanistan, so whats your point?

The United States could operate in Afghanistan and Iraq without the  European Union and without Russia or Pakistan. This was proven clearly when Pakistan cut off the supplies going to Afghanistan and the United States still managed to provide supplies, albeit of less quality, to the soldiers. 

See the difference? EU allies helped with Iraq and Afghanistan out of solidarity, we helped with Mali and Libya out of necessity. Don't confuse the two. 

Point is, you're completely incapable of acting by yourself when it involves power projection without the United States. What if Finland is invaded tomorrow and the United States doesn't lift a finger because it's not in NATO? Europe can't do shit. You're handicapped, and any action which requires strategic airlift or amphibious assaults, hell, *power projection in general* is determinant on the U.S. willingness to help, thus giving us influence and pull over you. 

But if you enjoy the present make-up, by all means, continue with the *status quo*. Giving the United States undue influence over your foreign policy, and hell, even your domestic politics when it comes to security is a *awesome idea*. 

Though...seriously....despite all the benefits and influence it gives me country...it's distracting us from our *""Pivot to the Pacific/Asia""*. We have to draw forces away from there to reassure our allies in Eastern Europe *(Estonia, Poland, etc.)* and to help with interventions in Mali &amp; Libya, which isn't good at all for us. This isn't the Cold War anymore, our doctrine isn't based on a Europe-based strategy anymore. 

Europe needs to get it's house in order, there's a reason they've started calling this the *""Asian Century""* and America doesn't want to be left behind because it's distracted and tied down by Europe.

# Testo per mail/fax:

Dear &lt;Nome parlamentare Europeo&gt;,

On March 18th, you are going to vote in the ITRE committee on the proposal on a ""Telecom Single Market"" regulation. There are still dangerous loopholes in the compromise texts. 

The remaining loopholes in the text are: 

* The definition of ""specialised services"" in Article 2.15 needs to cover online services as well as access services. Existing online services, or functionally identical services to them, should be prevented from creating a competitively destructive fast lane online. 
* The first sentence of Article 23.5. severely restricts the non-discrimination principle, as it only covers activities that are within ""contractually agreed limits"". This would allow ISPs to discriminate outside of (potentially very low) data caps and undermine the open internet, affecting millions of users and businesses. 
* The principle of ""net neutrality"" as defined in Recital 45 has to be binding in the legislation. Users need a guarantee for net neutrality against discrimination of their ISPs. 

We need to get this right. A small amount of loopholes that undermine the open internet is the same as a large number of loopholes that undermine the open internet. ISPs have proven their determination to establish themselves as gatekeepers of online services for their own short-term interests and against the interests of their users and the digital economy in Europe. 

Sincerely,
   &lt;firma&gt;",0,1395067572,null,0,false,0,cg4r5bx,t3_20mq7y,t1_cg4r5bx,t3_20mq7y,null,1432944826,9,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,9

We're both (my girlfriend and I) trying to be conscious of how much we're spending to stay, as we both don't have a large income to expense (She's a teacher, I work for the fire department). So my better question might be, where's a safe and enjoyable area to stay without breaking the bank?

* Where are some good places to visit/see while we're there?

I found the information on the beaches helpful, as well as the restaurant/bars guide; however, I was hoping for some ""hidden gem"" type finds? i.e. If you were visiting my city (Atlanta, Georgia) I'd tell you to do a ""shoot the hooch"", where you float a local river in an inner tube and see some neat things from the water, though it's not really an advertised thing that's very known by people not from the city.

* What are some good ways to get around the city?

I suppose I should rule this question out, after going back over the transportation part of the wiki I think that's rather clear and covered.

* What kind of money should I expect to spend while I'm there?

The problem with the current situation is that whatever happens Putin comes out of this (in the eyes of the ordinary Russian) smelling of roses.

He either gets to keep Crimea in which case he has won a significant strategic battle. 

Or, the West forces economic sanctions on to Russia and the economic problems Russia is now facing can be blamed squarely on the West. And I'm sure Putin will find some petty way to retaliate.

Or, the West stands up to Russia militarily and we get the same as above with the added potential of a conventional war kicking off. Europes economies will tank and it'd be interesting to see where China stands. 

It is unlikely at this point that Putin will be forced out and even if he was it is not clear that the various factions in the Kremlin would be any improvement.

Thats why Gysi and his Linkspartei are saying that nobody considered that Russia might feel threatened if Ukraine or the other surrounding countries get closer to the EU (which the Russian government already said years ago), because few years later there could also be the NATO in Ukraine.

Neither me or Gysi are saying that Russia pushing Janukowitsch to cancel the trade agreement with Europe was right in the first place, or that ""invading"" the Crimea and more or less annexing it is compatible with the law of nations. But once again, after the cold war we shouldve learned that you can only deal with Russia if you have a constructive dialogue and if you try to find a common ground, otherwise you will have a situation like we do now.

Japan is only slightly behind China in terms of economic strength *(and it could be argued it much more stable)* and Russia is dwarfed economically by a great number of countries, although it's natural resources make up for it somewhat, it still lacks in soft power. 

Militarily, China and the Russia have *nowhere near* the amount of power projection the United States has. It can't launch a 10+ year military offensive half-way around the globe, it lacks the logistical infrastructure *(military installations, friendly ports, supply bases)* and necessary equipment *(aircraft carriers, refueling aircraft)*. 

So while Russia excels in hard power *(and it has a absolutely huge border so it has that advantage logistically)*, it lacks in soft power. And while China excels in soft power, it lacks in hard power. Plus, with the degradation and loss of Soviet military infrastructure, Russia doesn't have the reach it once did...it can't reach and conduct combat operations for a extended period of time like in Afghanistan or Eastern Europe *(by itself)* anymore, it's borders have gotten smaller, it's loss warm-water and deep-water ports *(as it's struggle for Crimea and Syria go to show)*. China is still a economic beast, but in my opinion, a house-of-cards which depends on extraordinary growth, because if it's growth ever grows stagnant, or god-forbid, goes into recession, in my opinion, the whole house comes crashing down. It needs to keep momentum or it implodes. In America, such circumstances would be like chopping a limb off, but in China, it's like loosing your head if that analogy makes sense. 

And, on top of that, I don't think you can have more than two super-powers. Because once you move away from a bi-polar world and into a tri-polar or multi-polar world...that whole *""unparalleled""* thing doesn't really stand anymore. You can, in my opinion, only have one or two Superpowers. Once more states are able to compare to them, everybody reverts to Great Powers. 

This is also the direction I see the world going into. A *""multi-polar""* world in which America, China, Russia, Brazil and the European Union *(if it integrates)* are the Great Powers, with India and South Africa coming up from behind. 

But, as of now, only the United States can be considered a superpower...and even than it's loosing that position fast and I don't know how much longer we'll hold the title, if we haven't lost it already to simply be the strongest of the Great Powers.

""la charge de la preuve repose sur celui qui procède à une affirmation"" mais dans un débat idéologique les deux côtés procèdent à des affirmations. La charge de preuve repose donc sur aucun côté en particulier, ou plutot sur les deux côtés. D'un point de vue scientifique, dans un débat de type ""X existe/X n'existe pas"", il est plus facile de prouver que quelque chose existe. (impossible de prouver que la télépathie n'existe pas sauf à tester tous les humains vivants et morts) donc la charge de preuve revient à celui qui procède à une afirmation qui peut être prouvée par expérimentation.

 Il est impossible de trouver des faits qui prouvent que la culture du viol n'existe pas. Par contre trouver des faits qui prouvent qu'elle existe est possible.

Wealth does not automatically follow joining the EU, see Greece. It's a bit complicated.

Brain drain with 5x higher salaries is causing doctor shortage for example. Perhaps it helps in the long run, cannot tell yet.

The conflict in afghanistan in tl;dr: The Afghan govt. at that time tried to build a secular, modern state after their revolution. The Afghan government was attacked by mudjahedeen who were sponsored by the US.Afghan called soviets for help. At first the soviets didn't want it because of the political backlash, but because of the ""thread"" that they'd let the NATO take care of it, since the position of the afghan government wasn't constrained to political blocks even though they vieved themselves as communists. So the USSR mobilized. Well, you know the rest of the story. 

Chechnya tl;dr: They got independence, first thing they've done was enforcing sharia and attacking their neighbor to proklaim a kalifat, combine this with some suicide attacks in russia and you have your intervention in Chechnya

Georgia: I can't even comment on this, because it seems so obvious. Georgia leveled that city over night and russia stepped in.

There was this other guy Napoleon who wanted to conquer the world as well, well it's unclear what he had in store for everyone, but i doubt that he would put Polish (although poland aligned itself with the guy, because it was partitioned before ) or Russian interests before French.


Poles might hate Russia with passion, but you are pretty much a ethnically homogenous (?) society, meaning you don't really have any troubles with minorities.
 I also think that because Poland was so long under Russian rule and wanted to break free etc, your elites actually care about your country and its future and judging by how Poland treads on world stage your hatred for Russia and desire to prove the world that Poland is STRONK helps you implement correct measures and not become a third world country.

Not always well. As rich nations can afford to pay 3x - 5x as much to (good) doctors as poorer ones, there is a clear case of brain drain, especially of good doctors and good nurses. I don't want to be too dramatic, but this kills. Yes, I think it contributed to why my father succumbed to cancer at 62 in Budapest. Because the good doctors were already working in Norway or the UK pulling €4000 a month, while the Hungarian government couldn't pay them more than say €800 a month. (Rough figures.)

There is no reason for EU to rev up anything right now. Much less so if it means investing more into NATO. Did NATO actually manage to accomplish anything of value, that justifies preserving it at all?

&gt; arn't so ""bullshit"" after Crimea.

What, are you suggesting that zee Russians are going to invade the EU? UK, France and Italy each have more military power than Russia does. EU has enough deterrence as it is. This whole shitstorm in Ukraine was stirred up by Americans anyway. Thanks Obama, now we got a fascist state on a brink of civil war at our border!

&gt; See the difference? EU allies helped with Iraq and Afghanistan out of solidarity, we helped with Mali and Libya out of necessity.

Yeah, and each of these (probably Mali eventually) ended in a big waste and failure. Whats the point in spending hundreds of billions on your military force if you can't achieve the political goals that you have set?

&gt; it's distracting us from our ""Pivot to the Pacific/Asia"". We have to draw forces away from there to reassure our allies in Eastern Europe (Estonia, Poland, etc.) and to help with interventions in Mali &amp; Libya, which isn't good at all for us.

Yeah, go for it! Mind you that these guys wouldn't even need any reassuring if Ukraine just waited until the next elections. Instead you send them [this douchebag](http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/21/88/00/00/rian_02338557.hr.en.jpg) and ruin the balance in entire region.

I'm not advocating isolationism or anything, but like you said, this isn't the Cold War anymore. EU should let the US sort out its geopolitical ambitions alone and just focus on defense at home. And at the moment EU is working on precisely this, coordinating its defense efforts for domestic purposes. So its only logical that they spend less on the military, since they have more than enough to protect themselves from any feasible threats.

In my island we have a pecorino cheese that we make exactly like our pre-Roman nuragic ancestors did, 5000 years ago. Nobody is interested in improvement of pecorino cheese. What people want is diversity, and the story attached to it. What does it evoke?

People go on holidays, and when they go home they try to cook what they saw for their friends and family. They want to get back the complexity of the places they saw, their flavours. This is easier if you find the original product sold abroad, near your home. 

Take my pecorino cheese. We use this pecorino to make a dish with sheep broth, traditional ultra flat bread, spices and other things. If you can cook this even at your home, buying the actual products with the exact same label as those you saw abroad, your nice dinner for friends/relaxing cooking night is made. You are back in rural Sardinia, and you are bringing them there! 

We are not talking about what you need to make a lazy dinner. We are talking about what you buy to make something special. Some actual Parmigiano Reggiano on pasta makes even humble spaghetti a delicacy, a way to care for your family.

Well...sure...if you completely ignore the Fulda Gap, The Balkans, Libya and Mali, yeah, you got a point. 

Replacing reality with your own version of it works wonders. :) 

&gt;What, are you suggesting that zee Russians are going to invade the EU? UK, France and Italy each have more military power than Russia does. EU has enough deterrence as it is. This whole shitstorm in Ukraine was stirred up by Americans anyway. Thanks Obama, now we got a fascist state on a brink of civil war at our border!

The whole shitstorm on your border was stirred up by a EU Associated Deal which *you put forward* and it was inflamed by reforms *you demanded* as a condition of it. 

And than when things got out of hand, protesters starting getting shot and the government started passing draconian Anti-Protesting laws, you dropped the ball and didn't do shit, at which point America picked up the pieces to the mess *you started*. 

Thanks EU. :D

And it's odd.....the Estonians and Polish always head to the United States for military assistance instead of the non-existent EU military. :) You can't even maintain the confidence of your own member-states. 

&gt;Yeah, and each of these (probably Mali eventually) ended in a big waste and failure. Whats the point in spending hundreds of billions on your military force if you can't achieve the political goals that you have set?

Doesn't matter how it ended, the point of the matter is **you called for it** and then **couldn't handle it**. Kinda like Ukraine; see the running theme here? Starting shit you can't finish because you didn't prepare enough for it? 

And it's odd, The Balkans didn't really cool down until America got involved and actually gave the Peacekeepers some teeth to their bite. Or are you forgetting about Srebrinca which happened right under the nose of EU Peacekeepers? Or that the whole situation spiraled out of control because of European inaction and indecisiveness *(wow...there's that running theme again)*? 

&gt;Yeah, go for it! Mind you that these guys wouldn't even need any reassuring if Ukraine just waited until the next elections. Instead you send them this douchebag and ruin the balance in entire region.

&gt;I'm not advocating isolationism or anything, but like you said, this isn't the Cold War anymore. EU should let the US sort out its geopolitical ambitions alone and just focus on defense at home.

Then let us? *lulz* When you want to do something like Mali or Libya, **be able to do it yourself**. When you want to start shit in Ukraine with a trade deal that has extensive reforms as a condition and who's offering riles the population into a uprising, **then be able to clean up the mess and handle the fall-out**.

It does because it was a fucking disaster. It was unnecessary and uncalled for and the EU should leave this kind of shit to US.

No. EU Deal was brought forward when Yushenko was still in power, and he was replaced by a democratically elected Yanukovich who scrapped it. And they could have voted him away and gone on with their European aspirations if they just waited for another year. Europe never intended there to be a revolution. Europe did not have anything to gain by it. It was largely sponsored and perpetrated by the likes of Victoria ""Fuck the EU"" Nuland and the US government, still is.

D'ailleurs cette association fait partie des [associations à qui l'État donne le plus d'argent](http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/visuel/2013/07/01/associations-a-qui-profitent-les-subventions_3430228_823448.html).

L'arrivée massive de migrants en province [est un fait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRN_OkTDDQw).

Il y a par exemple [ce programme d'intégration régionale des populations immigrées](http://www.scribd.com/doc/176337483/PRIPI-2) qui précise bien une volonté délibérée de délester les zones urbaines de leur trop-plein d’immigrés  et d’utiliser pour cela les zones jusqu’ici préservées : 51% des immigrés présents dans la région sont arrivés il y a moins de 5 ans et 38% sont envoyés en milieu rural.

À cela s'ajoute la démographie : depuis 1998, [le nombre de naissances d'enfants](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&amp;ref_id=NATTEF02233) dont un des deux parents est né en France a augmenté de 13%, dont les deux parents sont nés à l’étranger de 38%, dont les deux parents sont nés en France de 2%.

&gt;

&gt;The __Automated Transfer Vehicle__ or __ATV__ is an expendable, pressurised [unmanned resupply spacecraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_resupply_spacecraft) developed by the [European Space Agency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) (ESA).  ATVs are designed to supply the [International Space Station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) (ISS) with propellant, water, air, payloads, and experiments. ATVs can also [reboost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboost) the station into a higher [orbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit).

&gt;Four ATVs, *[Jules Verne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne_ATV)*, *[Johannes Kepler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler_ATV)*, *[Edoardo Amaldi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edoardo_Amaldi_ATV)* and *[Albert Einstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein_ATV)*, have been launched since March 2008. ESA has contracted suppliers to produce one more ATV to be flown before 2015.  On 2 April 2012 the ESA announced that the ATV program would end after the fifth ATV is launched in 2014. 

&gt;Further developments of the ATV have been studied by the European Space Agency and [EADS Astrium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EADS_Astrium).    ESA member states decided in 2012 that the ATV would be adapted to serve as the service module of the NASA [Orion spacecraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft\)). In January 2013, the ESA and NASA announced the combined Orion and ATV derived service module.

true,CurtHoliday352,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; What the hell was the point of Libya intervention? What did it achieve? A secular state now turn by sectarian violence, with a bunch of islamists in charge. Great success that was.

It doesn't matter what the point of it was. What matters is **you called for it**. The United States didn't call for it, the United States didn't even want to be involved with it that much. But we helped, and basically led, it anyway. 

If you start shit, you should be able to handle it yourself. 

&gt;No. EU Deal was brought forward when Yushenko was still in power, and he was replaced by a democratically elected Yanukovich who scrapped it. And they could have voted him away and gone on with their European aspirations if they just waited for another year. Europe never intended there to be a revolution. Europe did not have anything to gain by it. It was largely sponsored and perpetrated by the likes of Victoria ""Fuck the EU"" Nuland and the US government, still is

Oh fuck off with that bullshit. Yanukovich was going to sign it than pulled away at the last minute, know what's going on around you on your god damn continent dude, this happened only six-months, if not less, ago. 

And *""Fuck the EU""* Nuland only said that because of the EU's inaction and indecisiveness after protesters started dying, getting abducted and the government started passing draconian Anti-Protest Laws. 

And in my opinion, she was fully justified in saying-so to a fellow employee on a private phone call. You ain't never curse with a fellow worker? 

And I love how you gloss over the whole Russian dick-deep involvement. 

&gt;What, like spending 5 billion to bring democracy to a country and end up with a fascist government instead?

Fuck off with that amateur propaganda bullshit dude. 

&gt;How does one start a revolution with a trade deal? Did you see any European politicians prancing around on the stage in Kiev? Did you hear any phone recordings of European politicians discussing which opposition leaders they would prefer in power? Don't be silly.

I don't know, are you blind? *lulz* Have you seen Ukraine? EuroMaidan? How does any revolution start? A spark. You gave the Ukranian people hope for the EU, you kindled the flame, and it blew up in your face. 

And influencing which opposition leaders meet with negotiations WITH THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT is important when you're trying to keep order in a chaotic environment, or if worse comes to worse, have a stable transition if the President did step-down. Yes,we used our influence in the situation, you're damn right, that's what countries are supposed to do, **that's the point of soft power**, and I love how you just skip over Russia's underhanded involvement in the whole thing, subverting the whole process. 

Europe didn't do shit. They instigated the revolution, but they didn't do shit when protesters were being murdered, when authoritarian laws were being passed, they weren't doing shit at all. So yes, *""Fuck the EU""* for it's inaction and indecisiveness on a paramount issue directly on their border. America, a country half-a-world away, had a more cohesive and effective foreign policy than the EU over the course of this whole thing. And that's a damn shame. It literally took Russian soldiers invading Ukraine for the EU to fucking step-up and develop some sort of cohesive foreign policy, and even now it's handicapped. 

For fuck's sake, human rights abuses were going on RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES in Ukraine and you ain't do shit. 

Also, Russia never seems to get any criticism or blame from you, huh? *How odd...*I guess everything and anything is Ameri**KKK**a's fault when shit goes wrong in Europe. :) 

And the only fascist shit I saw was the Anti-Protest Laws and Yulia Tymoshenko, Yanukovich's only real opposition and political threat, languishing away in prison. :) ",0,1395078771,null,0,1395079136,0,cg4w12p,t3_20mb11,t1_cg4w12p,t1_cg4vm3x,null,1432947126,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

2. very few tourists go to Parc del laberint d'Horta  or Bunker del Carmel


3. metro.. depending on how long you are here and how often you want to metro... personally anything over 3 days i recommend buying a 70/30 (€55 ish) you can both use it ie put it through the machine once for each person. you can go from metro to bus without paying within 30 minutes i think. 

4. food... bring a water bottle with you that you like ie filtered etc there are lots of water fountains about and is drinkable. you will need it. 

most people dont do breakfast here, coffee  and then about 1030 a pastry and more coffee... if you dont drink starbucks (there is only a few here) good coffee will be about €1-€1.50 ... expect to pay €3 ish for a coffee and pastry

lunch allow €10 - opt for fresh pasta etc that would cover food and a drink. honestly it will be less but go with that figure.

evening meal.. depending on taste can range from €10 to €50 each and how much wine you want to drink but honestly, we go out with my kids and my folks to a good restuarant when my folks come over every few months ... so think 6 adults (they dont do kids menus) and 3 courses and good wine comes to €140

5. Activites... i would suggest depending on your time lines, do the bus tour €25 (get the two day ticket and use it to hop on and off), pre book sagradad familia (morning 10.30 is best).. allow €20 each per activity and plan at max 2 per day, one morning, one evening.

a note... outside tourist places, life moves more slowly, places dont open till 10am,close for lunch, reopen at 4 till 9pm etc.. dont open on sundays etc etc... 

btw, the fire station here is open for visits if you want to go, and if you bring some tshirts from your unit station for my hubby and my nearly 6 year old girl who is obsessed with fire engines, maybe we´ll sort you out with dinner one night

However my concern is the fact that Putin has over-reached himself here, and the question is whether he will do it again as he's so used to a lack of intervention. Like you say, a NATO invasion will not slide, while Georgia did happen, Georgia was both on shaky ground, and far further away from core NATO countries like Poland and Germany (which NATO was effectively built around fighting a war in).

As said, America does have conventional superiority. But a shooting war would flatten Estonia. The concern is whether Putin has gone beyond the expert brinksmanship of recent years, or if hell be pushed by the nationalism he's whipped up these days, or a lot of other factors. 

Being circumspect right now, Russia is acting foolishly, and theyve over-stepped what the West will live with long term. The annexation of Crimea could become a status quo with time.

true,mk270,null,null,"As someone born and raised in Australia to British and Irish parents, and who then moved to the UK, I have Australian and UK citizenship by birth (but not, apparently, Irish). I always say that I am ""from Australia"" or ""from the UK"" and ""British"" / ""Australian"" or both, and I avoid saying that I'm ""English"" or ""Irish"" to avoid any sense of being a ""plastic Paddy"" or whatever the English equivalent is. In cultural and ethnic terms, those labels would be perfectly applicable to me, but I don't feel I've completely got the right to use them (though I was educated in England, Ireland, Australia and Italy). I am not a European: I wasn't born here, and I don't accept it as an identity; to me, it sounds like code for ""white"", and I wouldn't want to ask British citizens who are black or Asian, and whose ancestors suffered just for being black or Asian, to call themselves European.

I cannot abide ethnic/cultural nationalism, but am a strong adherent of civic nationalism: loyalty to the ideas and history of a continuous human community, rather than people of a particular ethnicity or religion.

As to people moving across borders: if the individuals entering are a net benefit to the receiving country and they assimilate, then I'm happy with it.

That means I oppose immigration to the UK and support it into Australia. Some countries attract immigrants who are better educated than their native workforce (extreme case: Dubai), and Australia seems to be one of them. UK and Germany are in the converse situation. See http://akarlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/pisa-scores-migrants.jpg from the recent PISA study. Some people say you're a racist if you oppose immigration. What if you both support and oppose it? Are you a racist and non-racist at the same time? :)

Let them take Crimea? Eastern Ukraine? The whole of Ukraine? How's about some Kazakhstan? Poland? 

Once again, Salami Tactics, your opponent will never leave you without choices, will never make it a necessity to use nuclear weapons, so when do you use them, or threaten to use them? If never, then you essentially have no defence whatsoever, and no means of realistically stopping a nuclear aggressor.

&gt; That's a terrible idea. Anything that prolongs the time before a nuclear war is worthwhile. Anything to avoid nuclear war is worthwhile.

There is no avoiding nuclear war. The only question is if we want it to be as quick and painless as possible, or involve generations of suffering before eventual extinction. 

Nuclear weapons have created a form of political and social stagnation, leaving obsolete political, economic and social systems on indefinite life-support, allowing only war-by-proxy so as not to rock the rational boat, or knock over the poorly-balanced jenga. As those systems become increasingly detached from technological and social reality, they will  continue to choke the life out of their citizens, and then they will fall in a messy and unpredictable way, leaving huge questions as to the destiny of the nuclear weapons that kept the whole sorry edifice from collapsing. 

No significant political change can be permitted in a nuclear state by other nuclear states. The idea of dealing with a completely new political system would threaten to undermine the very stability of the nuclear pact, which is predicated on a certain type of self-interested rationalism that would not exist in newer political philosophies. Existing political systems will even use nuclear weapons as leverage for outside assistance if they are encountering trouble from their own people. A country may acquire limited territorial survival with nuclear weapons, but the country gets to be 'locked in' socially and politically at that point forever, able only to evolve socially in ways that other nuclear states are comfortable with. Eventually, that will no longer meet the needs of the people, and there is little more dangerous than a state in revolution with nukes.",0,1395080713,null,0,false,0,cg4wy2e,t3_20m9d0,t1_cg4wy2e,t1_cg4vrb9,null,1432947634,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Economists have looked for the economic benefits of IMF-administered programs, and they haven’t found many; often, in fact, the opposite. A paper published in 2003 (pdf) by Robert Barro of Harvard University and Jong-Wha Lee of Korea University found “greater IMF loan participation has a direct negative effect on economic growth.” The next year, research produced a similar result (pdf). “What I find is, basically, that IMF programs reduce growth rates,” wrote Axel Dreher, an economist at Germany’s University of Heidelberg.

2. Offshore gas fields in Black Sea. More natural gas for gods of Gazprom means more money personally for him as well.

3. Russia pays Ukraine 100M USD annually for hosting Russian Fleet in Crimea (btw, without these forces legally being on Ukrainian ground Crimean trick would not be possible). If Crimea is not Ukrainian, Russia would not pay this money to Kiev.

    This deal was about to end in 2017, but Yanuckovich prolongated it to 2042 by signing [Kharkiv Pact](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Kharkiv_Pact). Kharkiv Pact was heavily criticized and current government sure have intentions to denounce it. If Kiev doesn't control Crimea, there is now way to kick Russian Fleet out.

4. Just cool way to piss in neighbours soup to make Ukraine busy. Another one was natural gas prices. Russian-style geopolitics is all about pissing in someones soup just because.",0,1395081397,null,0,1395081577,0,cg4x9tu,t3_20m9d0,t1_cg4x9tu,t3_20m9d0,null,1432947779,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

I didn't call for it. Thats my whole point, EU should not have done it, there is no point in it, it should just focus on its domestic defense and leave the world-policing to US.

&gt;  the United States didn't even want to be involved with it that much

Then they shouldv'e spoken against it. But they didn't. The whole thing was perpetrated by NATO, 75% US effort as you mentioned. And yet the US somehow gets *dragged* into Lybia, even though it voted pro-intervention.

&gt; Yanukovich was going to sign it than pulled away at the last minute

And he would be gone in a year. What difference did it make that he pulled away?

&gt; And ""Fuck the EU"" Nuland only said that because of the EU's inaction and indecisiveness after protesters started dying

[Killed by the snipers hired by the new coalition](http://humanrightsinvestigations.org/2014/03/05/estonia-fm-kiev-snipers-from-new-ukrainian-coalition/), the coalition that the US had been supporting.

&gt;draconian Anti-Protest Laws

Not as draconian as anything the US has in place, and you don't see the Americans revolting.

&gt; Fuck off with that amateur propaganda bullshit dude.

What propaganda? That's what your own politicians say. Yeah, thanks everyone, doing a great job on this whole Ukraine thing, now the evil dictator is gone so soon they will have democracy too. Like they do in Iraq, Afghanistan, Egypt, Lybia and all the other sunny places.

&gt; How does any revolution start? A spark.

No revolution starts without a good measure of foreign investment these days. Don't be silly. EU did not invest in overthrowing of a democratically elected government, US did.

&gt;  trying to keep order in a chaotic environment

So how did that work out?

&gt;skip over Russia's underhanded involvement in the whole thing

What involvement? Russia did not even step into the game until it was already fucked up beyond any repair.

&gt;They instigated the revolution

EU was trying to mediate a legal solution till the very end.

&gt;  they didn't do shit when protesters were being murdered

Murdered by WHOM? Is there any evidence actually pointing at the government involvement in all this?

&gt; when authoritarian laws were being passed

Still peanuts compared to any laws active in USA or most of the EU

&gt; America, a country half-a-world away, had a more cohesive and effective foreign policy than the EU over the course of this whole thing.

And what did it achieve exactly? Big chunk of Ukraine gone? [Neo-nazis](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/06/opinion/speedie-ukraine-far-right/index.html) in charge? Great job, America, have a pat on the shoulder!

&gt;For fuck's sake, human rights abuses were going on RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES in Ukraine and you ain't do shit.

And WHO was the perpetrator? What I saw was a bunch of ultra-nationalists throwing molotov cocktails at the police. Do you think this kind of behavior would be acceptable in EU or US? Do you think they would get away with it? Again, is there ANY evidence at all that these *human rights abuses* were actually the work of Yanukovich and not the fuckheads in charge of the country right now?

Oh god you have not a single clue what you're talking about.

1. There is a stoneage debate in the EU: **integration vs. expansion**. 

 As you might imagine nations that have a more limited (trade-orientated) vision for the EU usually support the **expansion** argument, because expansion favours their argument about the impossibility of a federal EU.

 In contrast to that, countries that ultimately view the establishment of a federal EU as the right way are more favourable to the **integration** argument, because fast expansion makes integration significantly harder.

 = = = 
 
 The **United Kingdom** was one of the loudest and most vocal supporters of the 2004 eastern EU expansion. It is a logical course of action when what you aim for is a free trade zone with free movement of capital.

 **Germany** feels it has a historical obligation to support the former Warsaw Pact countries but was more calm in its support because Germany has always been for the **integration** argument. The German ideal post-1945 was to gain re-entry into the civilised world. Post-1970 and post-1990 it was to support the dream of a united Europe.

2. Calling it ""Eastern Europe"" as if they're a common construct is stupid. The former Warsaw Pact members are diverse and with different interests. Even among the west Slavs Poland, Slovakia and Czech Republic the interests aren't the same.

 For obvious reasons though the countries east of Germany have a different attitude towards Russia than the UK calmly dwelling along on its island.

&gt;Their predecessors were all these conquerors and war time heroes etc.. they wake up every day wishing they could get even 10% of the glory their predecessors got. The only people the West truly ever immortalise are the war/expansionist type peoples.

Seriously. It's misspelled consistently.

""Its"" is a possessive pronoun. E.g. ""It ate its own foot.""

true,Trucidator,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Like most Brits I have heritage from all over Britain and like a large minority of Brits I also have Irish blood (two of my grand-parents are Irish). I was born in England and except for a period living in Italy and a period living in Japan I have always lived in England.

Most people in my position a generation ago would have self-defined as British. Recently I have increasingly started to define myself as English rather than British - this has been one of the somewhat surprising but noticable trends since extensive devolution for Scotland: the English have re-discovered an indentity that they had almost forgotten they had. I only tend to use ""British"" when I am speaking legally or formally, but in terms of culture and identity I now use English. Like most English people I still have a sense of the ""home nations"" and still would always support the Irish, Welsh and Scottish football teams if they are playing any foreign nation.

I feel I have some connection with:

- the anglosphere and commonwealth (those peoples that for example speak English, live under the common law or the Westminster system of government, have QE2 as their head of state and play British sports like cricket and rugby)

- those other Europeans that have been responsible, along with my own nation, for creating ""Western civilization""

- but also, having lived in Japan and spent a lot of time in Kenya and Ethiopia and knowing a lot of people who come from outside Europe and outside the Anglosphere, am reminded that a common humanity is already a very strong tie and stronger than many other cultural ties.

Every kid had to attend this school from Klasse 1 ( ca. age 6-7) to Klasse 8. Every settlement had at least one school (more or less).
Depending on the size of the schools there were not only boys and girls in one classroom but also several grades at once. Some schools were so tiny they had only one classroom. 

The curriculum was pretty basic, but I can't find a reliable source for detials. Kids had to learn reading, writing, maths, religion, singing (religious songs), handicrafts, local history. Did I mention religion?

Next to that there were Realschulen and Gymnasien for kids who were more gifted and / or rich. The more rich the less gifted they needed to be to attend these kinds of schools. Those schools lead to an higher education level and at time they were very often for either girls or boys as well as either catholic or protestantic.

If you really want more details you'd really need to chose a federal state first because every federal state has its own laws considering education.

Quelques secondes plus tard, une voiture vient se placer derrière moi et le conducteur, ne semblant pas satisfait de la position que j'occupe sur la route appuie donc sur son klaxon pendant 10/15 secondes sans le relâcher, c'est long mine de rien 15 secondes.

Le feu passe au vert quelques secondes plus tard, je m'avance à faible vitesse au niveau du carrefour pour permettre aux autres voitures de me dépasser pendant que je laisse passer les automobilistes venant d'en face, le conducteur énerve tente alors de m'intimider en faisant vrombir le moteur de sa voiture, comme pour me dire de m'écarter si je ne voulais pas me faire écraser. Pas de chance, il voulait en fait tourner à gauche, il se retrouve donc obligé d'attendre derrière moi, encore.

It was not a genocide only an ordinary massacre. More than hundred thousand people died in Yugoslavia breakup wars before Srebrenica and Nato didn't lift a finger. The only reason why it intervened in the first place is because it became too embarrassing for US not to act at home.

At any case, your argument is fallacy - [appeal to emotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion]).

Krstić, the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \(ICTY\), located in The Hague, ruled that the massacre of the enclave's male inhabitants constituted genocide, a crime under international law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre)

Excuse me while I take their word over yours over whether it constituted genocide.

&gt;More than hundred thousand people died in Yugoslavia breakup wars before Srebrenica and Nato didn't lift a finger. 

That's an argument for earlier intervention, not no intervention. 

&gt;The only reason why it intervened in the first place is because it became too embarrassing for US not to act at home.

The American people pressure their government to act in a situation of unspeakable horror. How awful and undemocratic. Wait no, the opposite.

&gt;Yes horrible things happened, but there are institutional ways to handle local wars - UN SC. 

**That was the whole lesson LEARNED in Rwanda and Srebrenica!!** You see how angry this misrepresentation makes me. The lesson was exactly that the UN was UNABLE to act and prevent it. Mladic selected Bosnian men and boys to be killed while the UN peacekeepers were standing next to him basically.

&gt;International law only makes sense if all of countries follow it. It cannot be applied selectively.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_to_protect

International law isn't as simple as you make it out to be. Responsibility to Protect is often conveniently forgotten or marginalised. 

International law also has to be **interpreted** because like ALL LAW it can contradict itself.

It says there is a duty to prevent genocide but it also says sovereignty has to be respected. It says peoples should determine their own fate but it doesn't grant the right to separate from a state.

It does and that is shitty. The only feasible comeback to that is that Gerhard Schroeder was accountable to Germany and nobody else. Its a case, and possibly and bad case, of the Member State being more important than the Union.

Nord Stream AG stated the fibre optics were [neither planned nor necessary.](http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/schroeders-pipeline-spionagekanal-in-der-ostsee-611094.html) 49% of Nord Stream AG is European Union owned. It would be interesting to see if that 49% are cool with Russia (through Gazprom) installing fibre optics that have been ruled out altogether, presumably to spy on Sweden. If so, another case of Member State &gt; Union.

&gt; There is no quick and painless nuclear war. You make a very strange dichotomy about it.

I am not sure how more plainly I can put it. The choice is between MAD between nuclear states, ensuring worldwide annihilation (nowish) or waiting until the US, Russia, China and so on become failed states due to economic and technological pressure, unable to protect those non-nuclear states they are allied with, precipitating limited nuclear exchange by opportunist nuclear states or agencies against non-nuclear states, with no means of preventing this - causing death by a thousand cuts or, rather, slow worldwide irradiation through limited nuclear exchanges for a generation or more. After all, we've been so good with the whole global climate change thing, haven't we?

&gt; The West won the Cold War to the extent that the Soviet Union collapsed completely. The failure since then was underestimating the extent to which Yeltsin could screw things up.

And they were only allowed to progress in ways that other nuclear powers permitted. Yeltsin may have screwed things up, but we provided the framework and the systems by which the current oligarchy rose to power as 'people we could do business with.' 

Let us imagine that a nuclear state is no longer serving its citizens correctly, and they start to revolt. A popular new philosophy is in the ascendant, let's call it the 'autopanopticon' whereby there is no voting or democracy, no capitalism, but all citizens are watched at all times by sophisticated machine learning systems that change the world around each individual person to better facilitate their personal and intellectual growth. Even in a non-nuclear world, that would pose a problem to other systems. In a nuclear world, however, said nuclear state would automatically come under pressure from all other nuclear states which would significantly limit their freedom of self-determination. The state does not even have to be nuclear as any nuclear state has de-facto territorial integrity and, therefore, is freer to manipulate other nations (and prevent competing or inappropriate political ideas), hence the prevailing global hegemony. Who could argue with interference in another nuclear state to 'prevent' a nuclear holocaust, or even just 'uncertainty?' We see, already, that the US, Russia and China are deliberating what to do about North Korea, and we, seemingly, are fine with the fact that North Korea, as an entity, has been decreed to have no right of self-determination by the major nuclear powers. In the case of NK, this is probably a good thing - for the moment. However, if we 'manage' North Korea's dissolution the way we 'managed' the USSR, we are setting the country up for failure at a later point by imposing systems that meet the other powers' geopolitical requirements, but not the needs of the actual people.

Look, it's perfectly legal for Crimean Russians to move to Russia if they wish to. What's not legal is to take a piece of Ukrainian territory with them as they do so without asking the rest of Ukraine for permission. If such a thing were permitted, you'd have any number of groups, however small, running plebiscites and claiming the right to do just that. Say, a random Chinatown in an US city decides to join China. Or a Pakistani-majority neighborhood in London declares themselves Pakistani territory. Hell, Chavs could set up their own republic in West Midlands. That's just anarchy. Hence, international law.

As for:

&gt;And was it lawful or constitutional that a mob ousted an elected government?

Was it legal for Russian forces to take Crimean administration building, to depose of the former administration and have the local parliament 'elect' a new one behind closed doors? ;)

Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) like to emphasize the word *genocide* in order to increase the perception of themselves as victims, and demonize Serbs. Croats also do the same to Serbs and vice versa - at has reached such level of absurdity that there is an [ongoing case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia%E2%80%93Serbia_genocide_case) against each other on the semantics of ""genocide"" alone. Similarly, Croats and Serbs see Bosniaks and genocidal descendants of Ottomans who are responsible for the death of millions of their kin over the centuries. What each of those parties think means nothing. The only reason why they are so keen to paint themselves as victims of a genocide is to psychologically downplay their own war crimes.

&gt;That's an argument for earlier intervention, not no intervention. 

Any intervention is illegal unless UNSC authorizes it, or as an act of self-defense. Under international law. What self-righteous idiots think is a ""necessary reason"" doesn't really matter.

&gt;The American people pressure their government to act in a situation of unspeakable horror. How awful and undemocratic. Wait no, the opposite.

To give you a context - American people also overwhelmingly supported Iraq invasion, and most Russians also support Russian intervention in Crimea. Ultimately, what people think doesn't matter - leaders are the ones making decisions, and whose acts are subject to international law.

&gt;That was the whole lesson LEARNED in Rwanda and Srebrenica!! You see how angry this misrepresentation makes me. The lesson was exactly that the UN was UNABLE to act and prevent it. Mladic selected Bosnian men and boys to be killed while the UN peacekeepers were standing next to him basically.

UN peacekeepers where standing idly because they failed to fulfill their duties. What happened in Srebrenica was preventable. If anything, it's a testament of how impotent European military forces are. Regardless, Srebrenica is immaterial - I was referring to Nato intervention in Serbia.

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_to_protect

&gt;International law isn't as simple as you make it out to be. Responsibility to Protect is often conveniently forgotten or marginalised. 

""responsibility to protect"" is convenient psychological whitewashing and propaganda slogan for Western aggressor countries, namely US. We're not invading Iraq because we want to secure Iraqi oil and Sadam selling oil in euros, but to ""overthrow a dictator"". We're not throwing billions at funding colored revolutions and selling weapons around the globe to secure US-friendly regimes (who cares if they're authoritarian, as long as they are our allies!) - it's to spread ""democracy"" and ""freedom"". And so on.

Your perception of reality is very naive. There are dozens of violent conflicts around the globe now and West only conveniently gives a fuck when it touches their strategic interests. Pragmatism and reality has been their politics since the time immemorial.

That amount of dependency on a globally traded, volatile product is a disaster waiting to happen. A sudden crash of oil prices will tank the entire economy.

true,KGB_for_everyone,RUSS,༼ つ ◕3◕ ༽つ,"&gt; I have many friends that come from eastern European countries and they all think that EU has done lots of good for their countries: and this is very understandable as EU is funding everything from motorways to culture, not to mention that due to EU citizens from these countries have had the ability to move all over EU. Not to mention that some people, especially Romanians see the EU as the only force to repair their countries as their political elite is so corrupted that without outside help no change will ever happen.

&gt; Now if you talked about countries such as Portugal, Spain, Greece and Cyprus, these countries are in trouble because they had an economic bubble, however the thing is that without the EU and without EU funds, they would be lot more poorer than they now are. Spain for example was almost going to become a net payer thanks to decades of EU funds to help the Spanish to build their economy.


All this is fantastic and i am sure a lot of people benefited from EU up until they became financially insolvent, but this does not refute my point that Spainiards, Greeks, Portuguese or Cypriots are fucked. This is not complicated, they joined EU, got rid of any production stuff and decided to make ""service"" economy with tourism, house bubbles and shit like that. Then they naturally collapsed and are unable to recover at all, year after year they show record number unemployment, vacant homes, immigration numbers are through the roof, debt is skyrocketing. You know that, i know that, they know that. What European Union offered them as solution does not seem to work, in fact it looks like it make things worse (and i am not even commenting on terms of bailouts, role of european banks and their exposure).


&gt; Lots of work has been moved or outsourced to Eastern European countries where it has taken the place of old industries that were not and would never have been competitive in global market.

&gt; In my honest opinion the only way to build competitive economy is to face global markets from the day one without subsidies. Domestic companies either handle it or not, if they are replaced by foreign companies that has largely happened in retailing and banking, then that is positive development as those foreign entities have been more competitive and thus been able to offer better services for the rest of the economy.


Again, this model is beneficial to someone who is already stronk and will only make them stronger. Rich get richer type of thing. Jobs are being created, no doubt about that, but profits are leaving countries and leave a miniscule impact on local economies. And if suddenly this ""trickle down economics"" cease to exist (as we've seen on Cyprus for example), local population is left with what is called ""naked ass"". Good luck surviving without any kind of competitive global product + outstanding debt.
 

&gt; The answer is again let the market do their job. If people don't have skills that are in demand or the investment environment friendly enough then their wages have to go down until equilibrium is achieved. In case of Russia foreign companies would gladly invest into Russia if the business environment and especially the government was more stable and less corrupt. For example many Finnish pulp and paper companies have tried to invest to Russia, but due to erratic local government officials, they have deemed it too risky thus preferring to invest in southern America. Do note that if you are going to build a pulp or paper mill, the company doing the investments needs to be sure on what is going to happen in the next 20-30 years and be sure that nothing jeopardizes their investment.


I get that you are ""let the market do its thing"" and ""invisible hand of the market"" type of guy, i am unfortunately not as optimistic. In Russia free market capitalism means increase of prices every year by a random number (it used to be double digits), just because we can and we are in monopoly/cartel agreement. 
The old joke of - prices on oil has raised, so we must raise prises on fuel as well! Prices on oil has declined, so we must raise prices on fuel to compensate loss of profit! Prices on oil has not changed, we must raise prices because ""insert any random reason"".

But thats not the point here, what i've personally witnessed throughout years is that workers on a global scale loose their rights on a yearly basis. People loose their jobs and no one gives a shit about them, because they either outsource their job to China/India/SEA or simply buy a legal ""slave"" in form of gasterbaiter who will work for 1/5, 1/10th of wages. This is very good for corporations as charts show, i am sure you saw a couple of them with corporate profits being at all times high. For common folk working for a minimum wage, with no social benefits or vacation does not sound like a fantastic career opportunity though. What i am afraid of, is that eventually we will go back to early XX century work environment which was pretty close to slavery and there is enough evidence that we are slowly, but surely walking in that direction. 

I'm not gonna defend Russian laws and policies, caz they are truly retarded, but the idea that South America is gonna be stable for 20-30 years is lil bit funny :)


&gt; Have you ever thought that Europeans regard Russia as a loaded gun against it? For example when Russia and US had dispute about US missile defense system, what happened was that Russia located short range nuclear missiles to Kaliningrad that are pinpointed towards Europe. Not to mention that Russia has a huge nuclear arsenal multiple times bigger than European states together have. Russia is the loaded gun for Europeans, that is why eastern European countries joined the NATO and EU, and that is why Ukraine is also going to join both organizations.


Your example is historically inaccurate unfortunately. Almost entire human history indicates that it is in fact industrial, advanced nations who go for a land and resources grab, not the other way around. India did not conquered British Empire and pillaged it for centuries, China did not attacked tiny Japan or SEA, Germany, United States, French Empire. Advanced nations need two things - **resources** and **markets to sell their shit**. Modern Europe is useless in that regard, you don't have anything of interest to Russia that we cannot already simply buy (either from you or China/U.S). The only reason why certain parts might become relevant is if BIG WAR was incoming, thus buffer states would be of utmost importance. 

But back to resources, Europe needs energy and raw materials (to compete with China and U.S). There are a number of places in the world, where you can get them. In South America you will meet United States in all its might and C.I.A activity, coups, economical pressure and to a lesser extent China; In Africa China is already a big player, they will increase their presence there as well; Middle East is unstable as always and they lack in certain aspects; and then there is Russia who provides you with cheap shit, which kind a helps to compete with both U.S and China + a big market for your stuff. Now imagine there is a trade war between EU and Russia, how do you think it will affect European competitiveness? Imagine that China would get even cheaper energy and resources, thus making their products even cheaper? 


Lastly, about missile shield and russian nukes, there is this thing in logic - cause and consequence. Its really simple, United States decided unilaterally to quit some treaty about Anti-ballistic stuff and put their missiles in poland/Czezh republic, Russia tried to negotiate, relocate, get some guarantees of non-hostility towards Russia, we got the middle finger. As a response Russia deployed Iskander. Again, Russia **reacted**, not caused this shitstorm. My point about Ukraine in NATO remains, Russia will invade and occupy Eastern part for sure if such event to occur, Western and Central parts are questionable. We shall see when IMF reforms will hit general population to the amount of unrest in South-Eastern part of Ukraine.

If Russia would invade eastern Ukraine, this would even further make this transformation more hasty... 

&gt; Have you ever wondered how would you feel if you would have a neighbor with 500 million inhabitants and who is economically and technologically superior to you and that has armed forces triple the size of yours, and who shares the same border from Black Sea to Barents Sea?


I already expressed my concerns about consequences of Russia's actions in Crimea in other threads, i do think that our actions will have bigger impact than some asset freezes and visa bans and bigger european military is one of them. But when such things would materialize, Russia will probably leave anti-nuclear treaties and just deploy several thousand nukes as a deterrent. Cheap and cost effective solution.


&gt; The idea to this date has been that by integrating economies and enabling Russians to do business in the west, it will in long term liberalize the Russian economy and society, thus enabling it to transform to a modern democratic state. Unfortunately it seems that this idea has been largely wrong in the case of Russian political elite. However the thing is that declaring a cold war against Russian political elite would also hurt ordinary Russians so that isn't something that should and would lightly chosen as a policy.


This does not change the fact that West **systematically** attacked Russia's interest around the globe and was more than happy to hoard dirty Russian money, stolen from local population. In fact, there was no effort whatsoever from Western elites to address this issue, thus i am skeptical that policy makers from EU or U.S give a shit about poor local population.

true,gensek,ESTO,Estmark,"Hrm. Well. Putin isn't an autocrat, in the _technical_ sense. Yes, he effectively has absolute power, but he has that power due to him acting — much like a feudal lord — as an arbiter between various groups with various interests. That is, he governs with the consent of the governed, but the ""governed"" under consideration are a tiny subset of the actual Russian society.

There are various groups that can be discerned using criteria like the one I described above (some call them 'clans') who control various aspect of both he economy and the state. For example, the different security services (GRU, FSB, SVR) are controlled by different clans, as are the immense state companies. Putin, to use the feudal parallel again, sometimes reassigns different pieces of the cake between different groups to maintain overall balance. And sometimes... he punishes the obdurate. If one's power is derived from money, the money can be taken away (Khodorskovsky famously denied Putin his fealty, so he was made an example of). If one's power is due to one's position in the state structures, he can be relieved of that post. Things like that.

The strongest clans are those ran by the siloviki, basically people with intelligence service backgrounds who came into power and money after Putin's ascent, be it by milking the state or raiding oligarchs. Their main opposition have been those who, basically, think that ideological approach and revanchism are bad for business. There used to be balance between those two groups for many years, but lately... if the pragmatists were still part of decision-making, the first question on the ballot would've been about Crimean independence, _not_ annexation — because that's a relatively safe, business-as-usual method they employed after the war with Georgia, and the international furore would've been over fast. The fact that they went for actual annexation, and them likely deciding to go through with it means that those who have Putin's ear right now don't give a fuck about what's good or bad for business. Basically, the siloviki have convinced Putin to push for a new world order and to make sure that Russia's status in that new order is superior to the one it enjoys today.",0,1395088030,null,0,false,0,cg50kg1,t3_20mkh1,t1_cg50kg1,t1_cg4xbwe,null,1432949330,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,ThunderstruckGER,EURO,Europa,"&gt; Das ist auch keine Relativierung, sondern dringend notwendig, denn das Klischee ""Frauen sind immer Opfer, Männer immer Täter"" entspricht halt eben genau nicht der Realität. 

Also ich persönlich kenne wirklich keine einzige Person -Frau oder Mann-, die dieses Klischee als wahr ansieht. (ist jetzt natürlich nur meine eigene Erfahrung)

&gt;Die Propaganda der Feminstinnen, die Frauen immer als Opfer darstellt kann nunmal nur durch Studien, die beide Geschlechter betrachten, entschärft werden.

Natürlich ist diese Propaganda totaler Bullshit! Und natürlich muss auch die Gewalt an Männern endlich so ausführlich wie Gewalt an Frauen untersucht werden!

Aber das ist doch kein Freifahrtschein für ""Counter-Propaganda"" wie im Text!

Der verlinkte Artikel besteht vielleicht gerade einmal zu 20% aus gedanklich korrekter und gerechtfertigt-kritischer Basis, die aber nur zur Überleitung zu diesem polemischen antifeministischen bis maskulinistischen Geschwalle dient.

Maskulinisten sagen zum Beispiel, dass Frauen ihre angebliche Opferrolle ausnutzen um (leichter) Täter sein zu können. Damit verkehren sie die angebliche Rolle genau ins Gegenteil -und in diesen Kanon stimmt der Link sehr explizit an der Stelle mit Brüderle mit ein. Und das ist ja wohl mindestens genauso beschränkt wie die Aussage, dass Frauen auschließlich Opfer sein können.

&gt;Der Artikel ist auch nicht dafür da, etwas zu lokalisieren, dafür ist die Studie dar. Der Artikel berichtet über die Studie. Die Studie ist einseitig, denn es wird nur ein Geschlecht betrachtet.

Naja, wenns jetzt in genau dieser Studie nur ganz ausführlich um frauen gehn soll, dann is das halt so. Der Fehler liegt ja dort, wo generell noch nie jemand so umfassende Studien für Gewalt and Männern durchgeführt hat. Müsste ja nicht genau diese eine Studie sein, die das auch noch übernimmt, irgendwer anders könnte ja stattdessen Gewalt an Männern untersuchen.

Um den Rassismusvergleich aufzugreifen:

Eine Studie über Rassismus deutscher Weißer gegen Farbige wird ja nicht dadurch tendenziös und/oder wissenschaftlich schlecht, weil sie nicht gleichzeitig Rassismus Farbiger gegen deutsche Weiße untersucht, verstehst du?

Eine Studie untersucht ja **immer** nur einen Teilausschnitt der Wirklichkeit. Was meinst du wieso es zu jedem Themenfeld immer viele verschiedene Studien zu verschiedenen Themen und manchmal sogar mehrmals gibt?

Außerdem:

Du musst das historisch betrachten: Die Frau musste sich ihre jetzige Stellung ja auch erstmal im Laufe des letzten Jahrhunderts mühsam erkämpfen!

Natürlich ist die Frau heute in so gut wie jedem Aspekt dem Mann gleichgestellt, dafür sorgen neue gesellschaftliche Standards und sogar zuweilen das Gesetz.

Dennoch ist es doch bitte zu verstehen, wenn Institutionen nun häufiger und ausführlicher [ ""Gewalt an Frauen""](http://fra.europa.eu/de/press-release/2014/gewalt-gegen-frauen-sie-passiert-taglich-und-allen-kontexten) untersuchen, als [""Gewalt an Männern""](http://www.bmfsfj.de/BMFSFJ/Service/Publikationen/publikationsliste,did=20526.html).

Es gibt ja auf jeden Fall Studien zu beidem, nur die Studie von ""Gewalt an Frauen"" ist 1.) historisch begründet interessanter (ist es immer noch auffallend schlimm?) und 2.) können sich Frauen allein vom biologischen Körperbau in konkreten Gewalt-/missbrauchssituationen nur sehr eingeschränkt wehren. Diese Hilflosigkeit hat eine ganz andere Qualität als bei Männern, die sich zB bei körperlicher Gewalt idr beser schützen können. (Bei psychischer Gewalt wirds da natürlich schon komplizierter.)

Dass mit der ""neuen"" (Gleich)Stellung der Frau jedoch das Gewaltpotential von Frauen auch oft verkannt wird, ist logische und historisch  bedingte Konsequenz.

Ich würde es ja auch begrüßen, endlich entsprechende umfassende Studien zu sehen (wobei Ich da nicht sehr viel andere Ergebnisse als in dieser Pilotstudie dazu erwarte), aber bei Texten auf solch niederem Niveau wie der Verlinkte, dreh ich durch, die machen nämlich die öffentliche Debatte nicht objektiver - ganz im Gegenteil!

The migration of aspirational workers to the [Blue Banana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Banana) from England to Venice has been going on for a thousand years; the current policy mix is only accelerating a deeply-rooted historical process. The losers are the ""remote"" areas (in different centuries, Scotland, India, Lithuania, etc) stripped of their up-and-coming go-getters.

We need better data, and better modelling: do the inflationary effects of immigration (more demand for housing, transport, food) outweigh the deflationary effect on wages? What happens to unit labour costs if you tax the whole population, then stick much of the native-born part of it in ill-suited, poor quality compulsory education, and then on benefits, while unprestigious jobs go unfilled in the private sector due to lack of importable skills? What are the cost of unassimilated migrants, and what are the benefits of cultural diversity? What is the Net Present Value of UK citizenship on the current terms, and does this provide an opportunity to people smugglers / degree mills? Pretending that any of the variables is zero or unmeasurable is not going to work.

true,1_048596,,Haltern,"Hey /u/celestec !
To answer your opening question: No, it's not the ""average"" German view of this situation. There are several reasons for this: First you have tv channels as for example ARD, ZDF and 3Sat which heavily criticize most of Russia's actions on a daily basis. Homophibic agendas, imperialistic behavior, corruption, a stagnant human rights development, mass media related brainwashing - all of these issues are portraied as typical ""Russian"" problems. In this regard the ZDF might be Russia's biggest detractor. I'm not judging any of these issues concerning their credebility or relevance - I'm just saying that these things stick to the average German mind. In general ""we"" don't like Putin just as ""we"" didn't like Bush. To the Germans they are warmongers, liars and the leaders of wicked superpowers.

So whenever Gysi mentions ""die russischen Interessen"" which neither Germany nor the Nato/EU ever seemed to consider for making their decisions he speaks contrarily to the average German opinion. The average German just thinks ""Why should we regard their interests? They are invading a weak country! They are wrong and need to be punished!"" Merkel's course covers their opinion much better (sadly).

And you need to consider the German history- which leads to a strong pro-americanism and a view of Russia (and China) as our ""foes"" since they don't even accept human rights and such. The world is painted in black and white and the average German likes it this way. Germany's former Chancellor Schröder (SPD) changed his profession and signed for Gazprom (what a silly decision for a former chancellor!). This ~~dickmove~~ decision dealt a serious blow to the ""image"" of the SPD. Any other left-wing-parties like for example ""Die Linke"" never had a huge support whithin the German news-agencies or voters to begin with. Hence Germany's relations with Russia are mainly influenced by the right-wing CDU or at least by the opinion of their leading politicians anf their view of Russia.

If anyone shares Gysis opinions it would be comedians, cabaret artists (Pispers comes to my mind), young educated people and mostly people from the city. People who weren't involved in any war - let it be cold or hot. Just look at Gysis latest election result: His party got about 10%. This should indicate how few actually seem to share his reasonable view.

true,zenicaone,EURO,European Union,"&gt; 1- Kosovo was part of Yugoslavia, a failed state which was disbanded and violently disolved in multiple other states. Ukraine is a functioning state, with no previous examples of break away regions. 

Kosovo was part of Serbia which was part of Yugoslavia with no previous examples of break away regions - until they broke away

&gt;Yugoslavia had provided autonomy and self-representation of the local Albanian population. Upon disoving of YU those rights were removed and the local populace was no longer represented, hence the escalation of the conflict and discrimination of the local population.

first post soviet constitution of Ukraine provided ability of Crimea to secede from Ukraine , but that ability was removed very soon after that 


&gt;Upon disoving of YU those rights were removed and the local populace was no longer represented, hence the escalation of the conflict and discrimination of the local population. This discrimination caused an effective break which could not be repaired and autonomy would no longer suffice to mend the distrust. Crimea was and is autonomous, its self-representation or self governing as an autonoumous region is not in danger. Ukraine has not stripped its autonomy, disolved schools in Russian language, removed from managerial positions all Russian employees in government administration or prohibited the use of Russian as an official language.

first move of post-coup government was to outlaw Russian language which indicated that discrimination of Russians in Ukraine is coming - instead of waiting for nuber of people to be killed they hurried up and proclaimed themselves independent - you would be happier if they waited for number of people to be killed ?

 
&gt; Kosovo referendum did have international monitors, they were free and fair (albeit Serbian population did chose for the most part to take part- this is however thier choice).

Is that why no country recognized Kosovo after their referendum , because they were so free ? - referendum was in 1991 , and Kosovo was recognized by number of countries only 15 (or something like that) years later 

&gt; I will however mention that Crimea did ask OSCE for international monitors and they were refused (not to be confused with military monitors that were prohibited from entering Crimea)

So OSCE refused to monitor referendum - but they were free to monitor if they wanted to - like you would say ""it was their choice"" - right?


&gt;Kosovo's referendum had significant media coverage and all parties were free to discuss pros and cons of each decission, in addition significant time was given to the electorate to make a sound and rational decision. The same can not be said about Crimea. 

define significant - because as far as I remember (I am from Bosnia , ex-Yugoslavia) all you claimed is factually incorrect

&gt;Kosovo followed Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and FYROM 's examples in breaking away from a failed state, it is not comparable with Crimea. This is apples and oranges. 

you somehow implied that autonomous region with no right of secession from Serbia (because it was part of Serbia) was equal to federal republics of Yugoslavia with rights to exit federation at any time they want - what is factually incorrect


&gt;To clarify, I am not saying the referendum is invalid or the voices of the Crimean people should not be heard. That is not for me to decide, **I am only clarifying the comparison is absurd**

maybe only in fact that Kosovo never had right to secede from Serbia , and Crime at one point in time did have that right guaranteed by Ukrainian constitution (first post soviet one) but was soon taken away from them in next Ukrainian constitution that followed",0,1395089978,null,0,false,0,cg51jbb,t3_20mpsc,t1_cg51jbb,t1_cg4xoit,null,1432949786,16,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,16

I can understand the business names being in Estonian as those are part of large chain franchises, but even small stores rarely have a Russian sign on the window. There *are* some laws that say a sign has to have an Estonian translation, but it's only about the translation and rarely followed as you may know many Tallinn's Old Town places have fully English names. Also I have never heard of any complaints or topics being raised about not being allowed to use Russian sings.

I don't have a good answer to this, in a city with 80-90% the population speaking Russian I'd honestly expect to see more Russian language around because the business owners are bound to be Russians too. Maybe a Estonian Russian could answer this better?  

If I'd have to guess I'd say there's enough dual language speakers and non-locals that it somehow has to make sense?

I don't mind it. As a year off after high school, I would have loved to be conscripted. Unfortunately, they won't let me. Only very few people have to go. Out of all the people I know, only those who wanted to serve had to. Three of them were girls. 

The military pays for your rent while you're there. You can take a university class while you're there, you can take courses so you can work on an oil platform, you can take your ""fagbrev"", which is the final stage of vocational education in Norway, you can get your driver's license, you get to ride around on snow scooters, you can be stationed on a boat, which means that you can be employed on a boat when you're done. People cook your food, people wash your clothes. 

All the people I know who have done their service, enjoyed it.  

As long as the majority of the military consists of conscripts, there won't be any large foreign interventions, either. Conscripts don't need to take part in interventions. 

The only reason you might have to fight is if Russia invades. And that probably won't happen. And even then. Wouldn't you want to do something until the Americans come?

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; All this is fantastic and i am sure a lot of people benefited from EU up until they became financially insolvent, but this does not refute my point that Spainiards, Greeks, Portuguese or Cypriots are fucked. ...  What European Union offered them as solution does not seem to work, in fact it looks like it make things worse (and i am not even commenting on terms of bailouts, role of european banks and their exposure).

When Spain, Portugal and Greece joined the union they were already then underdeveloped countries, they really didn't have big manufacturing bases. Under the EU Spain has probably profited the most, it nowadays does have very diverse industrial base and actually its export industries are at full swing. The problem that Spain had was huge housing bubble that disrupted the normal functioning of the market for almost an decade and this war largely thanks to corrupt state officials who gave an blind eye to the problem. Greece too had a corruption problem, and in case of Portugal, their economy is just too rigid and too entrepreneur hostile, thus they became crisis countries.

However we have seen these kinds of crisis come and go. They are normal part of market economy. Some times after a strong growth period there is a recession, and sometimes there is deep recession or even a depression. Countries go to these faces from time to time. The key to get out of these crisis is to actually restructure economy and make structural changes to it. In Finland we had the same kind of situation in the 90s when in the same time trade to USSR collapsed and we had an housing bubble and world wide recession. It took approx 6-7 years for things to stabilize and growth to come back. What the EU has done in crisis countries correct, the problem has more of been that political elite of these countries haven't implemented fast enough or at all needed reforms.

&gt; Again, this model is beneficial to someone who is already stronk and will only make them stronger. Rich get richer type of thing. Jobs are being created, no doubt about that, but profits are leaving countries and leave a miniscule impact on local economies. And if suddenly this ""trickle down economics"" cease to exist (as we've seen on Cyprus for example), local population is left with what is called ""naked ass"". Good luck surviving without any kind of competitive global product + outstanding debt.

Cyprus had an economic collapse because they pretended to know what banking is when in real life they were just offering a money laundering site for rich people, they actually didn't know how to do banking, that is why they made very risky investments for example to Greek bonds to be able cover their costs. However with Greek their risks materialized. What was funny with Cyprus and Cypriot banks that essentially the banks were bankrupt the moment Greece said that they would restructure their debt, however it took almost an year for the Cypriot banks to go officially bust... You know why they didn't go bust before? ... The Cypriot state committed a fraud and covered the banks until they themselves were on the verge of bankruptcy.

What Cyprus and Cypriots need to do is to concentrate on their other industry segments than banking and start to create conditions for them to grow. You do know that new industry sectors and companies are constantly born. For example mobile gaming is booming in Nordics and there is nothing in here that would naturally support it, it just happened because right kind of people were concentrated in large enough numbers to make the industry jump start.

&gt; I get that you are ""let the market do its thing"" and ""invisible hand of the market"" type of guy, i am unfortunately not as optimistic. In Russia free market capitalism means increase of prices every year by a random number (it used to be double digits), just because we can and we are in monopoly/cartel agreement. The old joke of - prices on oil has raised, so we must raise prises on fuel as well! Prices on oil has declined, so we must raise prices on fuel to compensate loss of profit! Prices on oil has not changed, we must raise prices because ""insert any random reason"".

Inflation doesn't just happen, it is caused by the government and central bank. If you want the inflation to be lower then the state needs to stop pumping money into the economy and start to decrease it by raising interest rates. In Eurozone the ECB has just done that, that is why we have very low inflation, however it makes things harder for governments because they need to be more wise on spending their monies.

&gt; But thats not the point here, what i've personally witnessed throughout years is that workers on a global scale loose their rights on a yearly basis ... What i am afraid of, is that eventually we will go back to early XX century work environment which was pretty close to slavery and there is enough evidence that we are slowly, but surely walking in that direction.

In countries were growth of the population tops growth of the economy you will see increase of poverty. In this sense yes it is true that we have problem, but in countries were economy grows faster than population, things get better. Good examples of these countries could be both China and India were your average people have more wealth and prosperity than ever before. All in all the world economy is constantly growing. We aren't globally moving into direction that you describe, but yes, some parts of the world are, but Europe, US, China and India are certainly not of these places.

&gt; I'm not gonna defend Russian laws and policies, caz they are truly retarded, but the idea that South America is gonna be stable for 20-30 years is lil bit funny :)

Some south American countries have very investor friendly environment and political stability that has allowed massive investments into them. For example UPM build an pulp mill in Fray Bentos Uruguay, the investment cost them 1.2 billion EUR, and you can be sure that the investment wasn't made on lightly bases. For pulp mill to start producing profit, it needs to producing day and night for a decade to pay itself off.

&gt; But back to resources, Europe needs energy and raw materials (to compete with China and U.S). ... Now imagine there is a trade war between EU and Russia, how do you think it will affect European competitiveness? Imagine that China would get even cheaper energy and resources, thus making their products even cheaper?

In global markets commodities have the same price everywhere and for everybody. In this day and age, you don't have to own or control a resource, what you need to have is something to trade with it, and that is what Europe has lots of. In case of Russian gas and oil, they are priced by the global markets, they are not cheap for Europeans, they don't bring any competitive advantage to European industries. If in case of trade war between Russia and EU, Europe would buy its oil from global markets with global prices.

&gt; Lastly, about missile shield and russian nukes, there is this thing in logic - cause and consequence. Its really simple, United States decided unilaterally to quit some treaty about Anti-ballistic stuff and put their missiles in poland/Czezh republic, Russia tried to negotiate, relocate, get some guarantees of non-hostility towards Russia, we got the middle finger. As a response Russia deployed Iskander. Again, Russia reacted, not caused this shitstorm. My point about Ukraine in NATO remains, Russia will invade and occupy Eastern part for sure if such event to occur, Western and Central parts are questionable. We shall see when IMF reforms will hit general population to the amount of unrest in South-Eastern part of Ukraine.

You didn't really answer my note about that Russia is a threat to European states. You can play tit-for-tat with the US, but if Europe is threatened the natural reaction is to do something about that threat, and I have a feeling that in a decade you will have to start to get used to having that 500 million inhabitant federal state as your neighbor that in worse case scenario is pinpointing nuclear missile against you, and be assured that as we have more resources and more money, there will be lot more to pinpoint from here to there, and from there to here.

In case of Ukraine and IMF, the government has subsidized consumer gas prices by 80%, that really needs to end because it leads to waste of resources and sub optimal usage of resources. Yes things will become harder for your average Ukrainians, but the market conditions need to be normalized in Ukraine for the country's economy to recover. We have to remember that ex-Soviet Republics like Baltic state did these reforms in the beginning of 90s and that is why they have seen huge economical growth.

Se l'Ucraina vuole diventare neonazista va bene tutto, ma se gli ucraini che stanno in Crimea vogliono opporsi a questa roba e rimanere nell'orbita russa non vedo perché non possano. E se si esprimono con un referendum allora SICURAMENTE il referendum è truccato. Solo perché l'ha detto Obama.

In regards to Cyprus, how is it exactly different from any tax havens really? Luxembourg, all the British Isles and other microstates. Also, who the fuck told Cypriot banks that it is safe and okay to buy Greek bonds, who encouraged them? WAS IT NOT EUROPE? They do have sun and sea, so they'll manage somehow probably, but what exactly of value mobile games produce? An app made by 10 people which you can sold for couple millions if you are really lucky? You do realize that this is entertainment and non-essential life expenses and you can't base your economy on that. The smaller the country, the easier it is to rebalance economy, but bigger countries can't be that quick to react or restructure, because they are *big*.


My joke about how Russia's fuel cost is formed is just an indication of what there is plenty in the world already - monopolies and cartel agreement. This is really simple again, there is no need in competition when Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell and BP can gather and set a price they want. Human history shows time and time again, if market is being ""let go"", it goes **full retard** and creates shit like 2008 Global clusterfuck, destroys any sort of meaningful regulation or safety measures designed to protect people and by the way, they control the media as well, so if something would be discovered - firstly they will call you a conspiritard, then will deny everything and in the end everyone will say that they already knew. It is truly sad when one by one conspiracy theories are being proven as true and no one gives a shit, **zero** consequences. 


In regards to growth, sooo, this growth you are talking about is backed up by a strong and solid economies, and not credit bubbles and debt, right? Caz if they are, well, our future is not so bright. EU GDP growth in 2013 was something like zero???


&gt; In global markets commodities have the same price everywhere and for everybody. In this day and age, you don't have to own or control a resource, what you need to have is something to trade with it, and that is what Europe has lots of. In case of Russian gas and oil, they are priced by the global markets, they are not cheap for Europeans, they don't bring any competitive advantage to European industries. If in case of trade war between Russia and EU, Europe would buy its oil from global markets with global prices.


Are we talking here about an immediate trade war or possible trade war in near future, where resources would be lets say ""harder to get""? There are also things like transportation costs, extraction costs, labor costs, reliability of shipments, infrastructure costs. Let's be real here, Europe imports Russian resources not because they love us so much, but because its financially best option for them and other options (including shit like renewables) is simply more expensive. You can start going full Wind/Geo thermal/Solar, buy raw materials from Africa (where you will meet China's needs and demands) and transport it via ships, but this will simply cost you more, **otherwise you would already be doing that**.


I believe I *did answered* about Russia's perceived threat by providing **historical data** who attacks who and why the do it. Read my post about Empires, markets and access to resources. There is nothing of interest for Russia in Europe that we cannot already buy or have and we *do* have other sources to buy equipment, cars and agricultural stuff. Europe *can* buy their energy and materials from others, but cost of their manufacturing would increase significantly and cost of life will rise as well. Thus we will both hurt each other, while our competitors in the face of U.S and China will strenghten their position. 

Unfortunately i am not a guy from Kremlin or smtn, so i can only provide my armchair opinion that Russia will simply go full nuclear retard and deploy lots and lots of nukes. 


Lastly, no doubt that IMF reforms are needed in Ukraine, since they haven't done shit in 20 years, what i am saying is ""how will the general population react to a decline in lifestyle?"" And ""What makes you think that Russia will not use turmoil caused by harsh economic conditions to further destabilize Ukraine and annex Eastern parts of it?"". I mean really, government in Kiev is already almost as anti-Russian as it gets, why would Russia stop in its quest to secure its interest and move borders away? Putin did mentioned not so long ago, that ""we did not started this"". If Ukraine hates Russia so much, i highly doubt that Kremlin will think about brotherly feelings or support them economically, they screamed about ""Hand of Moscow"" for couple of months without any proof, now they might as well see it.

It shows that it is willing to make token gestures which is all the EU-USA has been willing to do during this whole conflict. Sometimes it's enough to push a battered regime over the edge (like Yanukovych) but it also shows that the EU-USA is unwilling to take serious action *because* if they were willing to take serious action they wouldn't have made token gesture, they would have made a real gesture which caused real harm. This gesture is so token that they didn't even include Putin or the foreign minister in their list of sanctioned individuals! 

The sanctions look good on a headline,""Obama puts cuts of money to Russian elite"", or in a speech by Francois Hollande, ""Today, we dealt Russia the first of many serious blows"". But we didn't deal Russia a serious blow and we didn't even really cut of their money (they have plenty of other places where they keep it). 

TL;DR: We've proven nothing with these sanctions. We've not proven that we are willing to take hardship at home in order to get the job done. We had the opportunity to take some minor hardships at home in order to stop Russia. We did not take the opportunity. This is an indication of an unwillingness to do what is necessary. The reason we have made token sanctions is so that the political rulers can earn browny points for those that only skim read the headlines.

I understand. If it was France would be looking in towards the continent for military alliances (like it does for most issues) instead of to the UK. The fact the PM of the UK and the President of France went to Washington to ask for assistance in Libya instead of to Brussels speaks to how they feel about their European defense partners. 

I wouldn't take the view you do above that the EU has more than enough defense capability. If it integrated forces it might, but as of now many countries have redundancies that cause inefficiencies. If Latvia or Estonia was attacked it would be a complete mess if the EU was in charge of coordinating a response. There isnt a mechanism to manage any response.

true,melonowl,DENK,Denmark,"I think it's heavily dependent on a country's situation. I have a fair few objections to conscription, but I think there are some potential benefits as well. As for myself, I haven't been conscripted, I had to go to a conscription center place, take a test, had a physical examination, was told I was too underweight to be considered, which I was perfectly content to hear. Also, I think this will end up being longer than I initially anticipated. 

For an example against conscription, I don't really think Denmark needs it. There aren't really any major threats for Denmark to prepare itself for, and apparently there's enough volunteers each year to fill the quota, so why bother making all the men go to wherever the conscription center is for tests and a physical examination if they're not gonna be needed anyhow? If Denmark gets involved in a war requiring more than our professional military and those of our many allies then we're probably fucked anyhow. 

Edit: I thought of another point, the people making decisions regarding conscription likely aren't going to be affected by those decisions. I think it was Austria that had a referendum or something about conscription, and of course all adults had the right to vote in the referendum, but the outcome would only affect males conscripted in the future. It must have felt very bitter to be a guy under 18 having old people making decisions about how he'd be forced to spend a large chunk of his near-future.

As a counter-example, I think it can be necessary in the case of a country like South Korea. I know it's not in Europe, but it's just the first good example that popped into my mind. Anyhow, in South Korea's case they have North Korea right next to them, with a lot of weapons pointed at them, and practically daily threats of annihilation. Obviously in the case that NK actually attacks it's only prudent to be very well prepared. Besides North Korea, there's also a giant China to the west/north, and if China wants to, it can become an absolutely massive threat to South Korea.  

I think if there's going to be conscription it should absolutely apply to females as it applies to males. It makes no sense to me that in this day and age only men can be conscripted. What's the point of equal rights and universal suffrage without equal duties? Another problem is hazing, I don't know if that really happens in Denmark but I know it's a problem in some other countries with conscription, and it has caused completely unnecessary deaths because of cruelty and negligence. There's also a problem when military conscription is mandatory. Even if the country recognizes the right of conscientious objection you might still be forced to do work you absolutely hate for months. If the country doesn't recognize conscientious objection then imagine being forced to do something that absolutely goes against your beliefs and being forced to participate in it for months.

Now on the other hand there are potential benefits. It can be a very maturing experience for some people. It can look good on a CV. It can be a chance to earn money at a time when you might otherwise have problems finding employment, or just problems finding direction in life. It can give you training useful for your future career. If your country happens to get involved in a war you'll have the relevant training. It can potentially be a fun and satisfying experience.

true,kodiakus,RUSS,☭,"Title V of the Ukrainian Constitution on the President of Ukraine is quite explicit on what is required to remove a President. In the case of Yanokuvych, he did not resign, he is not unable to exercise his authority for health reasons, and he is not dead. Therefore, he can only be removed by impeachment.

Under Article 111, an impeachment procedure can be initiated by a majority of the members of the Rada. To bring charges against a President requires two-thirds of the members. However, as the Constitution states: ""the procedure of impeachment shall be adopted by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine by at least three-quarters of its constitutional membership upon a review of the case by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, and receipt of its opinion on the observance of the constitutional procedure of investigation and consideration of the case of impeachment, and upon a receipt of the opinion of the Supreme Court of Ukraine to the effect that the acts, of which the President of Ukraine is accused, contain elements of treason or other crime.""

There are 450 members of the Rada. On February 22, 2014 the Ukrainian parliament voted 328-0 to impeach President Yanukovych. This would have been sufficient to bring charges (two-thirds), but to adopt impeachment requires a three-quarters vote, i.e. at least 337 votes, which were clearly not cast.

Furthermore, the Ukrainian Constitution also states that such a vote, had it been cast would still need to be reviewed by the Constittuional Court of Ukraine to determine if the procedure had been constitutional. Moreover, the Constitutional Court's review would have to be approved by the Supreme Court of Ukraine. Neither of these steps was ever taken. Instead, the unconstitutional regime proceeded to fire members of the Constitutional Court, who had voted for the 2010 Constitution on the grounds that their decision violated their oath of office. So much for the independence of the Judiciary.

Thus under the current constitution, Yanukovych is still the incumbent and legitimate President of the Ukraine, as he has stated.

The relevant articles of the Ukrainian Constitution follow:

Article 108

The authority of the President of Ukraine shall be subject to an early termination in cases of:

1) resignation;

2) inability to exercise presidential authority for health reasons;

3) removal from office by the procedure of impeachment;

4) his/her death.

Article 109:

The resignation of the President of Ukraine shall enter into force from the moment when he personally announces the statement of resignation at a meeting of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.

Article 110. Incapability of the President of Ukraine to exercise his authority for health reasons shall be determined at a meeting of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and confirmed by a decision adopted by the majority of its constitutional membership on the basis of a written petition of the Supreme Court of Ukraine, upon a recourse of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and a medical opinion.

Article 111. The President of Ukraine may be removed from the office by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in compliance with a procedure of impeachment if he commits treason or other crime. The issue of the removal of the President of Ukraine from the office in compliance with a procedure of impeachment shall be initiated by the majority of the constitutional membership of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.

The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine shall establish a special ad hoc investigating commission, composed of special prosecutor and special investigators to conduct an investigation.

The conclusions and proposals of the ad hoc investigating commission shall be considered at the meeting of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.

On the ground of evidence, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine shall, by at least two-thirds of its constitutional membership, adopt a decision to bring charges against the President of Ukraine.

The decision on the removal of the President of Ukraine from the office in compliance with the procedure of impeachment shall be adopted by the Verkhovna Rada (Supreme Rada) of Ukraine by at least three-quarters of its constitutional membership upon a review of the case by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, and receipt of its opinion on the observance of the constitutional procedure of investigation and consideration of the case of impeachment, and upon a receipt of the opinion of the Supreme Court of Ukraine to the effect that the acts, of which the President of Ukraine is accused, contain elements of treason or other crime.",0,1395102048,null,0,false,0,cg57c0f,t3_20mpsc,t1_cg57c0f,t1_cg562ld,null,1432952584,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

I spent two years living in Italy and I do think the attitude of Italians towards a European identity is profoundly different from the British attitude towards it. I think this is mainly because (i) Italians have a very strong local identity whereas Brits don't, (ii) Italy is relatively young as nation, whereas Britain (or more realistically England and Scotland as separate nations) are old nations, (iii) Italy's experience of empire was particularly unhappy and Italy has not tended to see itself as a global nation, other than with respect to emigration to the us and Argentina, while Britain's experience of empire (while not without problems) was less unhappy, (iv) Italy is the only major nation speaking Italian and most Italians speak English and French, helping them identity with other parts of Europe, whereas English is spoken as a native language in other parts of the world and most Brits do not speak other European languages, (v) while Italy has an incredible cultural history, it has arguably not been good at exporting its culture around the globe, whereas Britain has forced its culture everywhere, and this means that those cultures where they play rugby and cricket, watch English tv shows and the bbc, use the English legal system, share lots of cultural references and ways of thinking with Brits, (vi) Italy's experience of ww2 was an unhappy own and some Italians associate ideas of Italy with that unhappy experience, and use the idea of Europe as a way of moving on, while ww2 was for Brits, to quote Churchill, our finest hour, which has meant that we are much less inclined to want to trust a European system as being safer for us than a British system, (vii) italians value history much more than Brits and arguably for Italians the finest period of Italian history was the renaissance which was a particularly European part of history, whereas Brits don't tend to value or think about medieval or early modern history much and arguably the finest period in British history was between the industrial revolution to ww1, a time in which Britain was less interested in Europe (other than the balance of power) and instead more linked to the rest of the world) (viii) Italy has only recently been immigration nation and Italians have not had much time to get used to ""extracommunitari"", whereas Britain has been an immigration nation for longer and has had a long time to get used to West Indians, Pakistanis and Indians etc, while we are still getting used to the massive amounts of immigration from Eastern Europe (though in fairness Italians have been coming to Britain for decades and fit in very well) and finally (ix) the consequence of being an island rather than a peninsula: when Brits say ""Europe"" we mean ""that place across the channel"" whereas Italians say ""Europa"" and mean both ""that place across the Alps"" and also ""this side of the alps"".",0,1395102588,null,0,false,0,cg57l89,t3_20mnnf,t1_cg57l89,t1_cg55bja,null,1432952705,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Russia centuries ago was different from today, they were surrounded by enemies- Germany and Austria in the West, Nomad Mongolians in the East and South, British Empire in the South also Ottoman Empire in the South. Conquering was to make a buffer zone. 

The world today is a bit different. Germany or Poland or whatever is not going to invade Russian territory. Hundreds of years ago, it was a genuine threat.

If you think Russia is not driven by economic benefits aswell you are mistaking. There are many smart economic advisors in the Putin government who know exactly what theyre doing. If Russia is invading Crimea, its not just to get a hard on from territorial expansion. Its because their experts think its the best way to get a geopolitcal advantage over neighbours and rivals",0,1395104167,null,0,false,0,cg58cgt,t3_20m9d0,t1_cg58cgt,t1_cg4pua2,null,1432953061,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
