true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; How so? Things have changed a lot since the 90's.

Yes, which is something the ""just run your own servers and encrypt everything"" crowd doesn't seem to understand. We don't use computers like we used to in the 90's anymore.

Setting up an email server and have it send and receive emails is one thing, *properly* running and maintaining it is something else, especially if protecting against an adversary like the US government is something you're concerned about. I don't care about your time, but I do care about an overall increase of spam due to people whose competence merely extends to following a decently written howto guide.

Next, encryption. Great stuff, works well for what it was intended to do, *if* you use it properly and know its limitations. It only protects the content of your communication, though, and in most cases what ""they"" are interested in is the metadata (who communicates with whom when from where). If they then decide that they're *really* interested in the content, they *will* get it one way or the other. Still, use encryption and get other people to use it.

However, the main point to make here is that, since those aren't the 90's anymore, it's inherent to the way your data is being used that you can't encrypt it if you want to lead a normal modern life. Your mobile phone has to connect to [cell towers](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/world/how-the-nsa-is-tracking-people-right-now/634/). You may be willing to go at great lengths to protect your communication, but odds are, the person you like to communicate with will still call you on Skype and finds proper key exchanges cumbersome. This girl you met last night will find your dislike of Facebook a bit weird. Your activity on Reddit tells quite a bit about yourself. Your bank transfers will still go through SWIFT, and the HQs of your credit card company and PayPal are still in the US.

We use more and more online services, increasingly location based services, share stuff with ""normal"" people online, and so on. Even if you're willing to pass on all, extrapolate the developments of the past ten or even only past five years, the increases in data, processing power and rapidly improving capabilities of data analysis, into the future. Unless you want to permanently live like in the 90's, encryption will only go so far. We need a legal/political solution.",0,1398575443,null,0,false,0,ch33x2x,t3_241uvf,t1_ch33x2x,t1_ch2zguy,null,1433539469,22,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,22

These countries accepted to use a foreign currency that imposed a foreign economic policy over which they had no de facto influence whatsoever. One of the reasons being the Eurozone doesn't have instruments for creating a unified economic and financial policy yet, instead it's being dictated by the financial institutions of the major currency holders (read Germany &amp; ilk). This resulted in affected economies losing price and competitive advantage mainly in food exports and services.

I would rather not have our politics dominated by two parties, but until that changes, it is indeed all about party allegiance. 

There are no independent Republicans out there accomplishing laudable goals.  I had respect for Ron Paul when he filled that role.  With him gone and the moderates squeezed out of the GOP, it's now the Tea Party, which is a bullshit populist party that isn't fit to govern.

&gt;When we filed this challenge we knew the path would need to start with a magistrate judge, and that we'd eventually have the opportunity to bring the issue to a U.S. district court judge and probably to a federal court of appeals. Today the Magistrate Judge, who originally issued the warrant in question, disagreed with our view and rejected our challenge. This is the first step toward getting this issue in front of courts that have the authority to correct the government's longstanding views on the application of search warrants to content stored digitally outside the United States.

true,TheMania,null,null,"When you designate ""money"" as being something that comes from outside of your jurisdiction you find yourself entirely at the mercy of lenders. This means you can find yourself in a situation where a huge portion of workers cannot find employment, but where the government has to tell people ""sorry, but there's nothing we can do - we've run out of money"". Because they have. This is despite that there's *heaps* of work that needs to be done, you just cannot connect the workers with the jobs, private or public, for a shortage of funds.

So even as a government, if you're borrowing something you do not have any jurisdiction over, you can run out of capacity to afford that debt. Cue the South's financial crisis.

The only way to succeed in such a system is ultimately mercantilism. To export more than you import, such that you can keep foreigner's ""money"" in exchange. This is what Germany does - each year it exports a lot more than it imports, such that Germany's holdings of Euros can increase. This is why Germany has not been subject to the same woes - there the government can run a balanced budget, with the Euros for households to save coming from outside the country. The problem with this solution, is that it fails hard in aggregate. Euros are a zero sum game - for every country that's acquiring Euros in this fashion, there's another losing Euros in the opposite fashion. Again, cue the south.

And the solution? Well there's one obvious one. A fiscal union, with the union government at the level of the ECB. Once you're spending at the currency-issuing level, you're no longer constrained like a household. Banks, quite simply, do not assess currency-issuers running out of the currencies they issue, which is why Japan has no problems sustaining its world leading debt (which is denominated entirely in yen). This union level government, free of having to balance its books, could simply make full employment and price stability across the EMU its dual goals, and use policies such as a [job guarantee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_guarantee) to achieve this. Unlike interest rates, the only tool the issuer has currently, a job guarantee can fully cope with a receding Greece and booming Germany simultaneously. It is, imo, the ideal policy if we are to make GDP, growth, full employment and price stabilities goals across the union.

Or, of course, the EMU can just continue doing as it's doing. Muddling through until somehow the situation resolves itself, in one way or another.",1,1398588201,null,0,false,0,ch36s8w,t3_24380d,t1_ch36s8w,t3_24380d,null,1433540820,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

It wasn't the armed efforts that made it easy for the state to be established either. Also, the ""stopped"" deals are (I presume) referring to the White Paper of 1939.

To say the immigration stopped is patently false. The immigration contributed heavily to the 1936 Arab Revolt, because of the 1935 bump in immigration as a result of Nazi persecution.

Britain handed the mandate to the UN, which formed UNSCOP. It then voted on UNSCOP's partition plan in the UNGA. The UNGA would've had to get the UNSC to implement the plan, but this was very likely...unfortunately, the Arabs entirely rejected the plan (while the Jews mostly accepted it) and a civil war erupted, leading to the eventual declaration of independence. All the British did was stop effectively enforcing their mandate. That isn't what got it accomplished, it just created the opening. Also, Arabs conducted their own attacks against British forces.

&gt;Mit der Privatisierung von Eisenbahngesellschaften geht eine Konzentration auf «Kerngeschäfte» einher, wozu die Autoreisezüge meist nicht gezählt werden.

&gt;Autoreisezüge weisen oft nur eine saisonale Nachfrage auf, wodurch ein wirtschaftlicher Rollmaterialeinsatz erschwert wird.

&gt;Das Geschäft der Autoreisezüge ist eng mit den Nachtzügen verbunden, die von den Eisenbahnunternehmen eingestellt wurden, in der Hoffnung, Reisende würden stattdessen die neuen schnellen Tagesverbindungen benützen.

That's an incredibly misconception you have, that everyone has control over their budget. It can only mean that you don't realise that money is a zero-sum game, that for you to ""spend less that you earn"" another needs to ""spend more than they earn"".

With that in mind, simply divide the economy into two, any way you like (say Germany and ""not-Germany""). At most one of those two parties can have control over its budget, and that's the simple truth of it. This means, by definition, that some people are forced to spend more than they earn.

So if you believe Germany has control over its current account surplus, you have to accept that the rest of the European Monetary Union is having dictated to them that they shall run a current account deficit, being drained of Euros. Cue Greece.

Or for an alternative look, divide Greece into three. The Greek foreign sector. The Greek households. The Greek government.

Now the first we **know** is in surplus. The Greek foreign sector includes the likes of Germany, of course they're saving Euros.

Back to the zero-sumness that is money, this means that either Greek households **or** the Greek government is going to be **forced** to spend more Euros than it earns, funding that foreign sector hoarding of Euros. Now it's a simple matter of which sector has greater control over its budget. That'll be the sector that gets to ""spend less than it earns"" (yay) at the expense of the other sector, which will be **forced**, outside of its control, to spend more than it earns (boo). Again, that's Greece.

So no, the government may well have been forced to ""spend more than it earned"" by the system, as the system literally does not allow for everyone to control their budgets simultaneously. If Germany control their budget, not-Germany cannot control theirs.

Again, this is how democracy works, and this is what choosing a representative means. It's the exact same way with national issues that come up after the elections. It does not mean people are getting lied at or cheated, as these have been the terms from the beginning. I tire of explaining this.

&gt; people vote for national representatives on the basis of national issues, not european ones

Please, speak for yourself.

&gt;its a legally obliged under our constitution

OK then, that's why I added the disclaimer. Good on your country if the population is happy with that arrangement, but not every country has such an arrangement, and it's not a bad thing. If we were discontent with the current situation, we'd change it (as indeed some citizen movements in some countries have).

&gt;Now are you honestly saying had the citizens in every member state gotten a vote that their collective vote would match their governments? 

I'm not a wizard, but I'm pretty sure in general terms this would be the case, yes. And, again, whenever this doesn't happen people get voted out and either the opossition replaces them, or new parties are created to represent the complex issues.

&gt;If proper democracy was practised the EU would be significantly different than it is now.

I'm sorry but this is just inflammatory demagogy. And again, false (unless you can point out which laws specifically have been broken where to deem it all ""not a proper democracy). May I instead suggest an alternate hypothesis, where your personal disagreement with the views on this matter with the majority of the european population tints your view on the facts in a paranoid way?

Now, listen. I tire of this discussion where I continue to ask for the basis of your claims, and you continue to do nothing but provide opinions pretending to be facts.

But they choose to. Then blaming something they knew would happen on anyone but themselves is idiotic.if I start borrowing money like crazy, wouldn't that be my fault? 


 It is like the Americans would start blaming the EU for not warning them enough about how stupid it would be to start the second Iraq war. We did, we told them there were no WMD's (and frankly, we really knew that because some of us would probably have sold them). They did listen, and they fucked up for a lot more countries than the US. But at least they blame themselves. 

Greece, choose, over decades to stay in a low tax corrupt, rather non efficient economy. That is what they voted for. They could have voted to pay more taxes for, non corrupt politicians and to be more efficient, but they were apparently content with the way things were. Then they entered which is arguably a really bad currency union. For everyone actually, not just for Greece. A union that everyone knew would lead to disaster, and the problems that Greece are facing now.  They did that happily and with open eyes. Do you want me to show you pictures from Greece being happy a our the Euro. And, the happily continued to borrow despite knowing that the internal devaluation would hit them and hit them hard!  They knew this. No one was cheating (well, Greece was to get in). Yet, when the day of reckoning comes it is all of a sudden everyone else's fault. There has been so many steps along the way to where Greece is now when they could have turned around, when they could have changed path. But every single time Greece and its population pushed forward, with open eyes. 


Blaming anyone but the Greeks for that is idiotic.  The information and the knowledge was and is there, the whole time. Again, with the comparison to the Iraq war, which was stupid. Guess what, the Brits were stupid who signed up for it as well. And they have no one to blame but themselves.  Same with Greece.  No one to blame but themselves. Or are you saying that the poor Americans and Brits were tricked and we should all help pay off their debt for that little tiny war mistake we all knew would happen. One is not excused from responsibility just because one willingly throws oneself of a mountain. 

If you want an efficient economy-build one and vote for non corrupt politicians. If you want a working society, again, pay taxes.  If you don't want to drown in debt- do not borrow!  If you don't want the consequences of a bad currency union, don't join. No one forced them, the information was and is there. Again, optimal currency 

The fact that you absolve the Greek people from the responsibility and the millions of steps the have taken to be where they are today is actually really, really sad. Asking anyone else to fix problems they have not caused is never going to fix them actually. That will not change the mentality and make people take responsibility for their mistakes. Do you want us to fix the US debt to,after all they were tricked.....

I dislike the Euro because it is a very imperfect, inefficient currency union. Maybe it can work 40 years in the future, with political and financial integration, but as it stands, it has been disastrous. I do not argue that. You don't have to convince me it is bad. However, that doesn't absolve anyone from knowing what they were getting into. Just like the Americans had all the information and choose to ignore it, the Greeks had it to.

It's just a shame it's impossible for them all to succeed at that at once.

FWIW though, there is a system that ensures balanced trade at all times, but it's messy, never-before-implemented, and basically gives you multiple free floating exchange rates within a currency region. And that's that you have each export $ create an import certificate that allows for $1 of imports within that country, with the price of those certificates free-floating. With this system, a country cannot import more than it exports, and if everyone implements it, a country cannot export more than it imports either.

But really that's just a theoretical exercise - you're better off just going to your own free floating currencies, another way to address the problem.

Economics is very simple. If you spend more than you earn you'll be in debt. You can spend more than you earn if you can plan to pay for it in the future. Offsetting consumption today for consumption tomorrow or consuming today and consume less tomorrow are the fundamentals of credit economics.

The Greek government spending was above its ability to earn. It lived on credit and could only do so as long as it could access cheap loans to roll the debt. They were playing with fire in a house filled with gas and it finally blew up in their face. It was all their own doing.

No one is forced to spend more than they earn as you say. Absolutely no one is. You can cut spending to balance your budget. This is what any business or country with a sound economy does. You take what you get in and ensure that you aren't spending more or you ensure that you are in such a good economic state that you get low interest credit to roll the loans when they fall for payment. The Greek government refused to do so. It fabricated its books and didn't do anything about the fact that people were lifting pension money from dead relatives and not paying taxes. That is one big portion of what the government could have cut spending on.

If you cannot produce income you need to diversify your economy or live with the fact that you cannot spend as much as the one earning more. Your logic is so flawed that it does not make any sense what so ever. It is not a zero sum game it is a game of balancing your books.

Except the borrowing wasn't necessarily their choice at all.

Governments do not generally get to decide their budgets, rather they're [dictated by the system](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/242yj9/greece_pressures_germany_on_wwii_reparations/ch374ua?context=3), as the private sector typically gets to exert more control over theirs. Now you add in a foreign sector (Germany) hoovering up Euros, and you're left with a government being **forced** to borrow by the system. Quite outside of their control, and apparently something few people realised going in.

Yet if Germany/Sweden/the Netherlands weren't hoovering up Euros, Greeces deficits would have been a lot lower. They'd be nowhere near the crisis level they reached. Such imbalances of trade ought **never** have been allowed to occur, and yet **everyone** sat by and let them happen. It was a system terribly poorly designed (I'm glad you agree with this), and the designers and implementers of that system have to bear a lot of the blame.

Importantly though, it's not Greece's fault that they fell foul - had they never entered, the problem would have just been worse somewhere else. There's always going to be a weakest member in a union, and as long as the strongest members are hoovering up Euros, the weakest member is going to find itself in an unsustainable position. Remove Greece, keep the current account surpluses, and the problem's just moved somewhere else. That's why the fault lies with the system, those that designed the system, and with those running the unsustainable current account surpluses.

true,Pokemon_Name_Rater,null,null,"Yes, much as I would like to make out Scotland as culturally Nordic, fortunately the case for strong cooperation with the Nordics doesn't demand it. Similar population density, similar environment, similar economies. Consider Denmark's example in renewable and green energy and Scotland's current and proposed future investment in that area. Scotland's potential oil revenue would, at this late stage, likely never be able to yield results like Norway, and Scotland wouldn't really need to invest in infrastructure already established. Still, Norway's expertise in such matters is invaluable. Whilst fishing largely comes under EU jurisdiction, as I understand it, combined efforts on studies for impact on ecosystems, sustainable practices etc would likely benefit all parties with commercial fishing operations in the North Sea. 

Scotland isn't Nordic. Many of you will ask why this sort of cooperation can't happen as it is with Scotland in the UK. It probably can, to a point, but the whole idea behind independence is that these things which are British concerns only by virtue of Scotland's membership are often given less attention and merit than they are due by Westminster, in cases where it is not a devolved matter. Scotland would be better placed to share knowledge and resources with the Nordics based on certain common ground than Britain, because under independence these matters would be of national significance, as they well should be.",0,1398592155,null,0,false,0,ch37dww,t3_240kxd,t1_ch37dww,t1_ch2kneh,null,1433541104,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

So the crisis was expected by the architects of the EURO but they rationalized that would be a ""benefitical crisis"" as the **EURO was a political tool** for the current EU to force through more integration and loss of national sovereignty of member states.

This was all predicted decades ago and more importantly allowed to happen:

For example the price for West and East Germany to re-unify was the signing agreement to leave the Deutchemark and join the EURO.  Losing control of your money supply is the first step on the road to usury of a government.

There are many strands to this story that go far back that explain how the EURO came to be (it was always a political project) and how that led to the GIIPS depression you see today.

The EU will argue it was a terrible mistake and that the EU grew too quickly or that fiscal union should have come atst so now only Banking union (ECB control) can resolve these problems: It's a big lie to explain away what was the objective of the EU all along. Of course the crisis has probably been worse than predicted, and the measures to resolve it, have been more complicated than anticipated. But the main objective of ""Ever Closer Union"" = ever more powers from member states and ever more members continues.

The current objective for the legitimate Federal Elections for ""more democracy"" again is just another observation of that trend to convert a supranational single regulatory regime into a legitimate political Federal Union.

Therefore ultimately you could well argue: The decisions of leaders at the top level with full knowledge that a crisis would eventually emerge from the currency union and that was collateral damage to their political objectives.",1,1398592367,null,0,1398592688,0,ch37f0k,t3_24380d,t1_ch37f0k,t3_24380d,null,1433541118,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

Euros **are** a zero sum game. You need to understand that if we are to have any kind of meaningful discussion on Greece, or money in general.

Tell me with which of these steps you disagree, and we can debate it:

1. Euros enter circulation when people borrow. The ECB loans Euros to banks, banks loan Euros to people, loans circulate as deposits.

2. Euros therefore represent someone's debt.

3. Therefore if you have +5 Euros, someone not-you, has -5 Euros.

4. If you decide ""I'm going to save Euros"" and achieve that goal, someone, not-you, must be dissaving Euros - spending more than they're earning - for where else could those Euros come from?

5. If Germany decides ""we're going to save Euros"", someone, not-Germany, must be stuck dissaving Euros.

If you agree through to 5, then you have to accept that some entities within the economy are not going to be able to dictate the terms of their budget. This is why even [ridiculously harsh austerity measures](http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/978261-financial-genocide) fail to produce budget surpluses - because the government does not control its budget, it can at best influence it, but on the whole it's *determined by the system*.

The truth is that the present crisis had a different background and was precipitated by different contingent factors in every country. I do not pretend to know Spain, Portugal, Ireland or Greece well enough to explain how it happened there, so I will talk about my own country, Italy.

Let's go back in time a little bit, unfortunately this won't be brief. If you want to skip to the immediate causes of the crisis, scroll down to the first bold line.

Up until the mid-70s, Italy was a fairly regular European country both in terms of its economy and in terms of the efficiency and honesty of its state apparatus. Between the mid-70s and the early 90s, a succession of Italian governments started using public debt and currency devaluations to prop up the economy, guarantee prosperity and buy themselves public favor, leading to an explosion of public debt (debt/GDP doubled in 15 years) and making the economy over-reliant on currency devaluation to stay competitive.

In the early 90s that system came crashing down. Not only was that political class swept away by a series of scandals, but our new European obligations meant that we could no longer borrow or print money to keep going. Governments started to try to rein in spending while our economy was brutally exposed to world competition without the benefit of a weak currency.

Needless to say, we did not adapt well. The reckless and very inefficient public spending of the previous 15 years had become entrenched and power figures of all kinds fought tooth and nail to protect their turf, meaning that cuts were ineffective in reducing excess spending and disproportionately affected those areas that did not hold significant political power (healthcare and education for example).

Our economy didn't fare much better. Our industries reacted to the new demands of global competitions well enough at first (early 90s) by reorganizing and streamlining their processes, but they largely failed to make key investments in new technology (especially IT), which meant that once reorganization was done our productivity stagnated while it kept growing in the rest of the world.

The reduction in public stimulus, stagnation of productivity and end of competitive devaluation meant that, in real terms, our economy has stagnated since the early 90s, but at least our debt/GDP ratio was slowly coming down. In the early 2000s, budget decisions by the Berlusconi government effectively ended the debt-reduction trend; the increase in public spending was unfortunately mostly swallowed up by the economic downturn following 9/11, so any potential GDP-boosting effect was lost.

**When Berlusconi returned to power in 2008**, at the beginning of the world economic crisis, his government failed to recognize any potential risk for Italy, claiming that we were not going to be involved. By then, Italy was a country with a stagnant economy (practically zero inflation-adjusted growth for the previous 20 years), excessively high public debt, very inefficient public administration and dangerously unrestrained public expenditure.

Due to the relative conservativism of our financial system we were not immediately hit by the crisis, and for two and a half years we weathered it relatively unscathed. In early 2011, however, the continually worsening economic outlook and reckless economic policy (Berlusconi was still resolutely refusing to do anything about the crisis or our budget) prompted investors to reconsider their confidence in our public debt. Berlusconi's dismissive and irresponsible reaction to allegations that our finances might not be as solid as in the past only precipitated the matter, causing a spike in our interest rates that threatened our ability to finance ourselves on the financial markets.

Amidst public terror for a potential sovereign debt default, with news programs giving daily and sometimes hourly updates on our interest rates, Berlusconi was forced to step down by an internal rebellion in his own party and pressure from virtually the entirety of the Italian and European political and financial establishments. Mario Monti was called in to form a new government, while the ECB effectively guaranteed that it would not let the country slide into default (because we are way too big to fail).

Il problema non è il realismo inteso come possibilità che la cosa avvenga, se no dovrei criticare il 90% del cinema mondiale. Intendo a livello di sceneggiatura. Mi sembra una scelta pigra quella di far fare una ""punizione esemplare a dei ragazzi che tentano di fare i furbi"". Lo spot Neozelandese oltre che molto più breve (e uno spot DEVE essere rapido per non perdere l'effetto), riesce a dare un tono drammatico, quasi da thriller, che muove l'emozione, le cose che dicono i protagonisti sono decisamente reali: ""c'è mio figlio che dorme dietro"", ""scusa non ti avevo visto"". Lo spot nostro invece ha la solita retorica bonacciona all'italiana da soap opera. Il poliziotto ""che infondo è buono"" che cerca di correggere un cittadino con uno scherzetto da prete, il medico che se ne fotte dell'etica e lascia adoperare i suoi strumenti ad un profano, un ragazzo che invece di essere contento per aver scoperto casualmente una malattia gravissima e forse riprenderla in tempo per curarsi, si spaventa e scappa dall'ospedale.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"&gt;You're making light of the crimes committed against Europeans throughout history and exaggerating what the Europeans did to others. It suits your argument to do so. I don't fault you for that. Interestingly enough, your point about the Reconquista seems to indicate that you think we are even with the muslims. Good, then we don't owe them anything.

We might have been even if we didn't decide it was a good idea to colonize North Africa. 

&gt;Sub Saharan Africans had no written languages and lived in huts made out of straw until they became slaves to the north Africans, Arabs, and Europeans. Maybe you could enlighten me.

Mali, Ashanti, Songhai, and Zulu Empires, Great Zimbabwe, Swahili States, Axum, Nubia.

See, you have an ignorant, backward ass stupid view of Africa. It wasn't straw and mud huts with a bunch of Africans running around eating shit from a giraffe's asshole. They have their own societies that functioned, they often had stone structures, and rule of law. 

&gt;That's all fine and good but I was talking about post-colonial governments.

Define ""post-colonial"" government. Do you mean for African countries?

I brought up the Congo because it is a classic example of what happens with an African government attempts to defy corporate interests. The Congolese government wanted control of the natural resources in Katanga, so French and Belgium corporations encouraged secession and were backed up by the Belgian Army. 

&gt;Infrastructure, education, modern medicine, and a written language in some cases. We gave these things to the colonized. I'd hardly consider the relationship to be one of a robber baron and a peasant.

""Infrastructure"", the only infrastructure that was created was to help Colonials extract resources. So you should take a trip to Africa sometime and when you come back, tell me about all that glorious infrastructure.

Hint; There isn't any.

We have established that they were not educated, and medicine could have been given without colonialism. 

So, I don't know why you keep repeating these things when we established those are not real benefits. It's like shooting someone and then taking them to the hospital and demanding they should be grateful that you're such a good person.

&gt;Where does the state get its money? Who do you think is the one who really pays for restitution? That's my point. Generations today shouldn't be made to suffer for sins of the past.

Absolutely untrue. Do you think the United Kingdom would be this wealthy without ever having an Empire?

&gt;People do it all the time.

If they are middle class and are lucky enough to live in a heavily developed country. Even working class people in our countries cannot simply quit a job. Try telling a factory worker in Bangladesh to go get a real job. You are so fucking ignorant of actual realities. How middle class are you?

&gt;I doubt many of these people care about colonialism.

Oh, I didn't know you knew about 4 billion people personally. 

&gt;They've learned from your own media to beat you over the head with it in order to guilt you into giving them what they want.

I doubt it, seeing as there is zero media coverage of these issues.

&gt;If you are so intent on eternally prostrating yourself to foreigners, why don't you do the 'tolerant' thing and give your house up to a family of Somalis?

Strawman, not even worth replying to.

&gt;Maybe you could let Chinese nationals vote in your elections? 

See above.

&gt;The possibilities for saying, ""We're sorry"" are endless.

And the ""We're sorry""s we have given are endlessly meaningless. 

Let me sum you up. You are 100% ignorant of everything. Everything. You know nothing about Africa. You know nothing about Asia. You know nothing about India. You don't even know shit about your own country. You don't know anything about history. You are being blatantly revisionist from your stance of ignorance. You're also pretty clearly racist.

But this hasn't really stopped you from commenting, in the same way knowing absolutely nothing about women has not stopped you commenting on /r/TheRedPill. So, when you actually get knowledgeable in even the most minute sense, we can then have a debate of equals, because this is not an equal debate, this is me speaking facts and you denying them. 

I strongly suggest you pick up a history book and read about something before giving in to the incessant need to comment about it in future.

The northern countries are responsible for the same thing, minus the very important corruption/debt/not paying taxes/corrupt politicians/refusing to become efficient etc. They joined a union with the full knowledge that some countries would suffer internal devaluation. I agree with that. 

However, you blame them for joining a union where some countries suffer internal devaluation. There is no blame. Why would there be? The north didn't create Greece's problem, the problem would not existed had they not joined. It is like blaming the bank for me going there and asking them for a loan with 15 % interest rate and then not being able to pay. I am the stupid one then, not the bank.

And the fact that you say Germany shows that you really do not know anything about currency unions or the Euro.

Please, if you want a serious discussion you have to start dealing with facts, and to accept them. The facts are that it us a bad currency union that Greece fought to get into. Greece knew that they would suffer from it, and it has nothing to do with Germany, it is the construction of the Euro I itself. That is one of the many things that makes it a bad currency union.

true,TheMania,null,null,"Ah, I get what you're getting at now. You accept that Euros are debt, that if you have saved, another has borrowed, but where we differ is you believe that everyone **chooses** to borrow. That everyone has control over their own individual budgets, and that nobody has them determined for them by the system.

See, the thing is, what you believe is impossible. If everyone has control over their budgets, and everyone decides to save +€1, clearly some are going to fail at that task. Perhaps half the people will succeed and save +€1, with the rest being forced to dissave €1 against their will. Perhaps 90% will succeed and 10% will fail to a huge degree. Whatever the outcome - it's impossible for everyone to have control over their budgets. Literally impossible.

So now think back to the EMU. Let's say some of the most disciplined countries *can* control their overall budgets. By definition, this means some *can't*, most likely those with the weakest export sectors. Let's say one of those is Greece. Now divide Greece into its private and public sectors - at least one of these sectors is going to be **forced** to fund the foreign sector surplus. Against its will, it won't be able to stop it - for Germany has control over its budget. See what I'm getting at?

Within Greece, this is a simple tug of war. Private sector vs public sector. Household and business budgets, over which people exert a great deal of control, vs a public sector budget determined largely by automatic stabilisers, with at least one of them funding the foreign sector surplus. It's obvious which will win. The public sector will be left holding a deficit, such that the foreign sector can save. The public sector can try and break the backs of households, try and force them to cough up their savings through spending cuts and tax increases - but ultimately, it's always going to be a tug of war that at most one sector can win - and no matter what, this can only go on so long before neither sector can fund the foreign sector's savings any longer. Cue the sovereign debt crisis.

If some countries are to save Euros, eg Germany/the Netherlands/Finland/Sweden through their high current account surpluses, some are going to be left holding the corresponding debt, perhaps against their will.

true,jeanralph,ZBSVUE,U-E,"Au-delà de la forme de l'article qui est insupportable et imbue d'elle-même, le fond est douteux aussi. Sachant que l'auteur a exclu de son étude les milliers de niches qui existent et qui cohabitent dans le monde du porno pour ne se concentrer que sur la pornographie quasi-caricaturale qui est conçue pour assouvir les fantasmes du mec hétéro lambda, c'est évidemment facile de conclure après que le porno est le reflet d'une société bâtie autour des désirs du mec hétéro lambda.

&gt; L’apparent paradoxe qui réside dans le fait de se présenter comme des «entrepreneurs de fantasmes» et d’exclure de façon aussi drastique les fantasmes homosexuels masculins (relégués à une autre catégorie spécifique du marché, le porno gay ou bisexuel, et faisant l’objet d’un tabou dans le porno généraliste)

L'auteur de l'article s'étonne que le porno gay est relégué au segment de marché qu'est le porno gay et qu'il est exclu du porn mainstream. Ça revient à dire que les bateaux sont tabous auprès des concessionnaires d'automobiles, parce qu'ils n'en proposent pas à leurs clients venus chercher des voitures.

S'il est persuadé que les pornographes se plantent et que lui a trouvé la faille, il n'a qu'à lever des fonds et monter sa boîte, comme tous les entrepreneurs qui veulent combler une faille du marché.

&gt; On s’aperçoit ainsi que devenir le sujet (et non plus seulement l’objet) de l’expertise sexuelle et de la construction des fantasmes hétérosexuels reste encore largement interdit aux femmes; ce processus rencontre en tous cas une large résistance masculine. Pour les acteurs en revanche, la reconversion en tant que réalisateur est vue comme «naturelle»: eux qui étaient déjà, pour la plupart, entrés dans le métier par goût personnel, deviennent progressivement les concepteurs des mêmes fantasmes que ceux qui les avaient initialement attirés vers la pornographie.

C'est aux consommateurs de porno et à eux/elles seul(es) de participer à la ""construction des fantasmes hétérosexuels"", si les gens veulent voir du porno réalisé d'un point de vue plus féminin (du reste c'est une tendance réelle, comme quoi il n'y a pas tant de résistance que ça), ils iront spontanément vers et celles et ceux qui en produisent.

&gt; L’enjeu, c’est donc bien la partition des territoires masculins entre «homosexualité» et «hétérosexualité», c’est le maintien de ce binarisme hégémonique qui «ne préexiste pas à son énonciation» et «acquiert consistance à travers un processus de réification».
Ou, selon les mots de Judith Butler: 
«L’hétérosexualité hégémonique est elle-même un effort constant et répété d’imitation de ses propres idéalisations. (…) la performativité hétérosexuelle est en proie à une anxiété qu’elle ne peut jamais tout à fait surmonter, (…) elle est sans cesse hantée par le domaine de possibilités sexuelles qui doit être exclu pour que se produise le genre hétérosexualisé».

La seule chose qui ""ne préexiste pas à son énonciation"", c'est exactement l'existence de ce genre de théorie invérifiable qui se donne une légitimité et une apparence scientifique sans l'être.

&gt; L’enjeu de la pornographie, pour le dire autrement, c’est la maîtrise masculine de la sexualité féminine, c’est la jouissance du «pouvoir de faire jouir».

Même dans le cadre bien étriqué de l'objet de l'étude qui se concentre pourtant sur les préférences pornographiques du ""macho de base"", ça n'est pas une affirmation cohérente. Où rentre l'homosexualité féminine, pourtant omniprésente dans le porno mainstream, dans ce tableau ?

If one country had more gold than another, it was necessarily better off. This idea had important consequences for economic policy. **The best way of ensuring a country’s prosperity was to make few imports and many exports, thereby generating a net inflow of foreign exchange and maximising the country’s gold stocks.**

Whilst the Euro may have been to make trade easier, if one were to play the game wisely you'd actually do everything you can to ensure you were a net exporter (like Germany/the Netherlands/Sweden/etc) and not a net importer (like Greece/Spain/Italy/Ireland/etc).

Politics

* Since the Fidesz supermajority prevents meaningful debate at the National Assembly, more focus and work is done by the 15 parliamentary committees since 2010. [The new distribution was negotiated](http://www.politics.hu/20140426/new-parliament-to-have-15-committees/): 10 committees are headed by Fidesz, 5 by the opposition parties. Jobbik demanded to have the national security committee (to the obvious dismay of everyone else), but according to custom it went to the biggest opposition party, the Socialists along with the budgetary committee. Jobbik got employment and the cultural committee instead, the latter includes education as well. LMP aimed for and secured the sustainable development one. 

* The [football stadium of Felcsút](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=hu&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fhvg.hu%2Fnagyitas%2F20140421_Felcsut_mindenki_ott_volt_Orban_foto&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url), Orbán's home village, built literally next to his house got opened by the final of the international U-17 football tournament that occured previous week. Felcsút's football academy lost against Real Madrid to 0:1. The star player of the local academy, Mátyás Tajti, announced that after a lot of courting and debating what's best for him, [chose to sign with Barcelona instead of Real Madrid](http://www.espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1794852/barcelona-sign-hungarian-teenager-matyas-tajti-report?cc=5739). I posted this news in the Politics section because of it's huge political overtones and the general consensus that this place got built simply out of Orbán's love for the game (the stadium holds twice as many people as the population of the village). [A small protest was arranged at the opening as well.](http://www.politics.hu/20140422/leftist-opposition-holds-demo-at-felcsut-soccer-stadium/) 

* Unsurprisingly [EP-voters will factor in domestic politics heavily in their decision](http://www.politics.hu/20140422/domestic-politics-leading-priority-for-ep-voters/), Hungarian even more so than the 12-country test average show.

Also, a total of 8 parties will be able to field a list for the elections.

* The Socialist party has amassed CHF-loans in excess of 2b Fts (~6m€). Banks have frozen some assets and ultimately the question is whether they'll be able to keep their party headquarters or not.

* Want to learn a Hungarian word? Try 'mutyi' [sort of like moot-ye]. It's a very region-specific word which is milder than 'embezzlement' but sort of means the same thing with the added nepotist, favoritist attitude. The mutyi of the week is the use of EU funds to improve the water supply system in excess of 140b HUF, about 450m€. Already initial tender for planning were won by Fidesz-friendly entrepreneurs, including the mayor of Felcsút who's highest degree is in plumbing and managed to become a billionaire from there. 

* A good week for motor vehicles: new [trams](http://www.politics.hu/20140423/govt-to-extend-subsidies-for-new-budapest-trams/), [buses](http://www.politics.hu/20140423/govt-makes-huf-150-billion-available-for-new-buses/) and [ambulances](http://www.politics.hu/20140423/ambulance-system-to-be-upgraded-using-eu-funds/) will arrive, funded by EU funds. 

* [The Central Bank sued one of its supervisory board members for slander](http://www.politics.hu/20140423/central-bank-sues-board-member-for-slander/), because they don't like valid criticism on whether they should spend billions of Fts on artworks, instruments and such without any oversight. 

* Brussels rejected our request for reverse VAT in the sugar industry, which is one of the biggest areas of people quickly becoming billionaires through tax evasion. They utilize the rigidness of the EU tax system, by purchasing sugar in Slovakia, claiming to sell it in Romania or Bulgaria (and paying VAT on those there), which never actually happens and the sugar is sold VAT-free in Hungary.

Thus far, this has been the jurisdiction of the country where property is located. 

This is very problematic because Google and the other 'Net firms have been building data centres in Europe the past few years precisely to assure European customers that their data would stay under European jurisdiction.

The EDPS has recommended that information should only be handed over to law enforcement bodies in accordance with clear procedures defined in international or bilateral agreements. Such procedures are under discussion but in many cases are not yet official agreements.

This is how things are supposed to go. In the state where the data is located, if bilateral agreements don't say otherwise.

Again, divide the economy into three.

Say households want to net save at 3% of GDP/yr, and they key that into their budgets. Say the foreign sector wants to net save at 3% of GDP/yr, and they key that into their budgets.

What do you have left? A government deficit of 6% GDP/yr, funding both the private and foreign sector surpluses.

For any level of private sector net savings rate, the government sector deficit will be lower with a lower current account deficit.

true,canteloupy,ZBSuisse,Suisse,"Ce que je veux dire par ""quelques centaines d'euros"", c'est que soigner une personne dans un hôpital lorsqu'il est arrivé ici ne coûte pas très cher, et pourtant ça peut lui sauver la vie (ou égoïstement aussi éviter qu'ils répandent des épidémies...). J'estime que lorsqu'on a un pays riche (oui, car la France n'est pas encore à genoux), on peut très bien mettre ces petites sommes individuellement à des gens dans la misère.

Il y a de l'argent. Ce n'est pas là qu'il faut aller chercher les économies. Au moins, lorsque certains demandent d'augmenter les impôts sur les hautes tranches, on peut critiquer le résultat (évasion fiscale) mais pas les intentions, parce que ça revient à vouloir prendre là où il y a un excédent (personne n'a *besoin* de plus d'un million d'euros par an).

Appeler des gens des ""hors la loi"" n'en fait pas moins des êtres humains. Surtout pas les enfants, qui ne peuvent pas être hors la loi, je le rappelle. La politique que tu défends demande qu'on laisse des gens mourir ici y compris des enfants, alors qu'il y a les moyens pour les aider. Soit dit en passant, tous les partis s'interrogent sur la manière dont on peut réduire les dépenses publiques. Ce n'est pas l'apanage de ton camps.

""Dépenser n'importe comment de l'argent qu'on n'a pas"" est un total non sens quand on parle ici de dépenses médicales pour des gens n'ayant pas d'argent, dans un pays qui en a. La politique c'est décider de l'allocation de ressources, eh bien je pense que c'est pas plus mal que ça d'allouer ces ressources à ces gens qu'à autre chose, ils en ont besoin là, maintenant, sinon ils vont aller très mal. Tu penses qu'on devrait les laisser être malades, et éventuellement mourir. Bien, on est pas d'accord. Je pense que tu es irresponsable de vouloir laisser mourir des gens. Et ça me dégoûte. Voilà tout.

Le problème de la dette est un débat entre économistes. Certains disent que c'est la pire engeance, d'autres disent que ce n'est qu'un outil et une abstraction. Mais en attendant il y a des gens dans la misère et je maintiens que leur retirer le minimum qu'on leur accorde aujourd'hui ne revient pas à ruiner le pays. [Le budget est ailleurs](http://www.liberation.fr/economie/2014/01/29/budget-de-l-etat-ou-economiser-des-milliards_976108).

C'est une question de philosophie. Je ne reste pas éveillée la nuit à l'idée que quelqu'un, quelque part, utilise peut-être l'argent de mes impôts à mauvais escient... Je vois que la majeure partie est employée à des causes que je soutiens, et lorsque quelque chose me tient à coeur je m'engage politiquement. Si je vois un mec qui fout la merde, je suis contente de me dire qu'il ne parviendra pas demain à faire s'écrouler la société car elle vaut mieux que cela, elle est plus forte que cela, et je me dis ""il a sûrement plus de problèmes qu'il ne peut en causer"", et je préfère me demander comment on peut éviter que le suivant en arrive là aussi. Je ne dis pas qu'il n'y a pas de problèmes, mais qu'ils ne sont pas là où tu dis et que les solutions ne sont pas celles que tu proposes. En particulier, je pense que les réductions de dépenses que tu proposes auront un effet tangible très malheureux et peu d'effets positifs.

The economy would have been healthier without the Euro. But employment would not necesarily have been higher. Japan (and Denmark btw) gets to exceed 100 % of GDP in debt, because they have transparant economies. Greek didn't have a transparant economy. And the only reason why Greece have one now, is because of this huge Euro cock-up. Due to theese problems, the Dracma would not have been strong enough to support much growth. The interrest rate on statebonds could easily have been as high as they became in 2011 under the near default. And the interrest private firms would have gotten would have been equally shitty.

I think the only thing I really disagree with you about, is how much Germany is at fault. Greece wanted to enter the Euro.

If they were truly arsed about having their vote, they would have already taken advantage of the citizenship test in the past 20+ years like my mother did.

And now that I am permanently settled in the UK, there is little point in me learning the language, though I have been educating myself on the culture. However, I see this as a consequence of their upbringing; ethnic tensions and (arguably self-inflicted) isolation were very much a thing in Latvia when I grew up, and older generations remain brainwashed against native Latvians.

Tout à fait d'accord. Aborder la pornographie par l'angle de la sociologie ça pourrait et ça devrait être un sujet passionnant. Il y'a des questions pertinentes à se poser : 

Comment sont réparties les différentes formes de porno ? Qui regarde ce fameux porn mainstream ? Quelles sont les valeurs de ces gens ? Font-ils une différence consciente entre la représentation et la réalité, et il y'a t il débordement de cette représentation dans la réalité ? Quid des autres segments du marché qui ne se sentent pas représentés par ça ? Y'a t il de la place pour une pornographie davantage féminine, et si oui qu'est ce que cela implique par rapport à notre société en général ? Les pornographes sont-ils en phase avec leurs audiences respectives ?

However, what you're saying is that Germany's trade surplus has somehow caused Greece's trade deficit, which then resulted in a government deficit. But Germany can't magically make BMWs pop up in Greece and then force people to buy them, the causality works into the other direction. In Greece's case, it begins with an expanding government budget (deficit), which caused wage increases that outpaced productivity gains. Those wages were spent on imports of consumer goods instead of on capital goods, and investment inflow dried up due to a loss of competitiveness -- and the problems escalated because the Greek government had *somehow* managed to delay the necessary reduction of the deficit.

But instead they made precedence for a lower fiscal standard. That is EU's most deeprooted problem today. Greece got caught up in that. 

As for the shortterm bonds. They are feasible. But they don't wield the same potential as the Euro would have held, had the Greek economy really been ready to use it possitively.

The second the Euro got into effect, huge investments should have been made in bringing southern Europe up to speed. Theese investments where not made. And that was irresponsible. But again. With the relatively high level of coruption in Italy, Greece and Spain, I understand why many investors where weary at sending too much cash-investment that way...

My problem though, is if you're going to always look at this from a competitiveness point of view - there are *always* going to be countries in the union that are least competitive, by definition. That have less flexible labour markets, for whatever reason. Etc.

The way the union is currently configured, where we allow unfettered trade surpluses (and how can you stop them, really?), will ultimately lead to those countries running out of Euros. They won't be able to compete, their exporters will forever be yelling that the Euro is just too overvalued (from their perspective), their industry will just be finding imports too cheap to compete with, and ultimately they'll end up with an unsustainable CAD.

This CAD gives the government three, poor, options:

1. Simply target high employment and growth, ignoring the CAD. Deficits will run as a matter of course, eventually though it'll blow up as people stop loaning the government Euros. Cue Greece/Spain/Portugal/etc.

2. Forget about employment/growth, simply run austerity from the get go, *before* it blows up. Now household fund the CAD rather than the government, the too-few Euros being spent within the economy mean job losses, poverty, a very unhappy populace, and probably won't even stop the deficits. I also doubt its sustainability - once households have run out of Euros who's left funding the CAD?

3. Try and become more competitive than your neighbours, making it their problem instead. This one really is a race to the bottom in terms of labour laws etc, but hey, you don't need to outrun the bear - you only need to outrun the guy next to you, right?

To me, 1 and 2 don't work at all, and 3 does not work in aggregate so it is not in fact a solution. It just moves the problem. The system's just messed up, basically.

&gt;Du gehst zu Frauen? Vergiss die Peitsche nicht!

ist ja auch deswegen nicht gut, weil es nicht direkt von Nietzsche stammt, sondern von der literarischen Person Zarathustra und des weiteren kontextlos präsentiert ist.

Viel wichtiger ist aber: Wir hatten damals drüber diskutiert und es gibt wirklich tausend andere Aussagen von Nietzsche -sowohl während seiner geistigen Umnachtung als auch davor!- die einfach auf gutdeutsch fürn Arsch sind. Da is von (latent?) elitaristischer bis faschistoider Scheiße alles dabei.

Der Mann hat einfach viel unglaublich kluges von sich gelassen (Nihilismus, anderes aus seinen 3 Hauptwerken), aber einfach auch Dinge gebracht wo Ich nur den Kopf schütteln kann.

Ich bin Zarathustra atm am lesen und sorry, der Eindruck den ich damals hatte -ohne die Primärliteratur zu lesen- scheint sich mir tendenziell zu bestätigen.

Aphorismen von ihm -wo er Sklaventum befürwortet usw- sind natürlich viel krasser, aber bei Zarathustra hatte ich auch schon ein paar Momente, wo mir ziemlich seltsam wurde, als Ich seinen Gedanken fortgeführt habe.

Und exakt diese Dinge kann Ich an Nietzsche kritisieren. Man muss jemand ja nicht unbedingt verreißen, weil ein Teil des contents kompletter Bullshit is.

_____________________________________________________

Je nachdem kann man jetzt aber schon sagen, dass bestimmte Aussagen den Urheber ganz oder teilweise disqualifizieren. Bei Nietzsche ist das sicher nicht so einfach und/oder gerecht, aber bei Hetzern wie Pirincci oder Sarrazin umso eindeutiger.

Jeder der auch nur eine Kritik Pirinccis Buches gelesen hat, hat mittlerweile genug Hetz-Zitate über links/grün mitbekommen. Da wird doch direkt klar woher der Wind weht.



Und da sind wir am Knackpunkt unseres Diskussionsgegenstandes. Es geht darum, ob es sinnvoll ist aufgrund von Sekundärliteratur auf das Werk zu schließen.

Und das lässt sich nicht eindeutig, bzw nicht ohne Abstufungen der Antwort beantworten. Es gibt Sekundärliteratur über Inhalte, die ist so ausfürhlich, dass sie je nach grad der destruktiven Kritik ein direktes Lesen ersetzt. Man nehme als Beispiel ""Mein Kampf"".

Bei Nietzsche, einer viel ambivalenteren und komplizierteren Person geht das garantiert nicht. Da muss man schon entweder sehr, sehr viel Sekundärliteratur lesen, oder gleich das Buch.

Und auch hier sei gesagt, dass bei Büchern wie ""Mein Kampf"", ""Deutschland schafft sich ab"" und ""Deutschland von Sinnen"" es trotzdem immer besser ist, die direkte Quelle zu lesen, das schafft Autorität, Kompetenz und Sicherheit bei einer Diskussion um das Thema. Auch wenn es  vielleicht nichts an der Meinung ändern wird. Wäre aber sicher sinnvoll solche Bücher zu lesen auch wenns dann leider Geld für den idiot gibt, ders geschrieben hat =/

Bezogen auf meinen verlinkten Artikel heißt das nach meinem Verständnis folgendes: Die Verfasser der Sekundärliteratur in den eher moderaten, auch linkeren Medien servieren Pirinccis Müll ab (haben sie das Buch/Auschnitte gelesen?) und die anpolemisierten Kommentatoren unter den Artikel stemmen sich dagegen ohne vergleichbare argumentative Kraft oder Sachkompetenz wie der Autor.


Sie kennen anscheinend sehr viel weniger Inhalt des Buches und interpretieren in ihrer Rage (-&gt;polemisierte und populistische Kommentarkultur der Kommentarspalten) eher in das Buch, sodass ihnen die Schärfe, Radikalität und allgemein das Gedankengut von Pirincci gar nicht bewusst ist.

So habe ich das zumindest verstanden. Wird ja auch direkt im ersten absatz der [Link](http://www.zeit.de/2014/15/pirincci-deutschland-von-sinnen) zu der Literaturkritik gemacht.

Also fernabd meiner obigen ""Grundsatzdiskussion"" bezieht sich der Zeit Artikel auf die Kritik eines kompetenten Literaturkritikers, der das Buch gelesen zu haben scheint. Und Leute die das Buch nicht gelesen habem -es aber trotzdem verteidigen- sehen da schon sehr alt aus.

Darum dreht sich der Zeit-Artikel aber auch nicht nur. Es geht auch wieder ein wenig um soziologische Eroierung des Verteidigermilieus mit dem Schluss, dass sich viele -durchaus gebildete und sozial gut gestellte- Leute anpolemisieren lassen und stänkern, dabei aber eigentlich nur wieder eine ""alte Normalität"" haben möchten. Da lässt sich viel zwischen den Zeilen lesen. Deswegen hat mit der Artikel so gut gefallen.

Sry für den endless langen post, aber hoffentlich trägt das -trotz der Länge- ein wenig zur Klarheit bei.

Third, in the short term (I am thinking over several decades here) it is not immediate how it hurts everybody. I mean, right now it is evident how the south is not benefitting, but it is not evident how it hurts the north yet (I am simplifying with north/south, hope that is ok). 

Fourth, quitting the Euro will hurt, not just the individual country but the world economy. That makes the threshold even higher. 

Fifth - we need brave politicians, ready to stand there and take the heat.......

The thing with the culture part of the committee isn't that serious, but I say that bitterly: because Fidesz already completely overtook the area by using borderline retarded, Fidesz-fanatic people in cultural positions. For example we had the Academy of Sciences in place for deciding how scientific and cultural grants should be allocated, they did their job well for decades with little political involvement (if anything, they were slightly right leaning), but they didn't like that so they ""upgraded"" a second, private Academy of Sciences to be in charge of this and basically they, led by a crazy nationalist architect, are the gods on deciding what theater, cultural institute, exhibition, etc. gets state funding and in what amount. The actual Academy of Sciences does what it's supposed to do: scientific work, the other one badly lacks that and it's there as a government appointed guiding force...

I very much support a common fiscal policy (which includes transfers), but apart from that there's somewhat more flexibility that those three options of yours, especially #3.

One problem that Greece has is that the government bureaucracy isn't merely inefficient, but in many ways even ineffective. Even if the overall economic situation in ""the North"" is better than in Greece, they have their own problems and quite a number of people aren't rich at all -- especially not compared to Greece's elite. So, as long as tax evasion remains a problem in Greece, any kind of transfer will be extremely difficult, politically.  

Bureaucracy is also a factor in competitiveness. This means the kind of regulations that are truly unnecessary or rooted in clientelism, corruption, time to process applications, and so on. This is not ""race to the bottom"" stuff, and Greece has quite some room for improvement in this regard.

As for moving the problem, while competitiveness is a relative measure, productivity is not a zero sum game. Wages are only one factor on the cost side of the productivity equation (time would be another). Increases in productivity raise the standard of living globally, because less time has to be invested into either making a product or to gain the wages to pay for it. However, this would require investment into better machines and more specialized services, which takes us back to the need to properly reform the bureaucracy.

A free floating currency functions nothing like that - your money supply isn't tied to how much of a second currency you have, or gold, or anything else.

There are five Arabic sources, all at least 500 years after the supposed events, which mention the fate of the library.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_the_Library_of_Alexandria)

Abd'l Latif of Baghdad (1162–1231) states that the library of Alexandria was destroyed by Amr, by the order of the Caliph Omar.[18]

The story is also found in Al-Qifti (1172–1248), History of Learned Men, from whom Bar Hebraeus copied the story.[19]

The longest version of the story is in the Syriac Christian author Bar-Hebraeus (1226–1286), also known as Abu'l Faraj. He translated extracts from his history, the Chronicum Syriacum into Arabic, and added extra material from Arab sources. In this Historia Compendiosa Dynastiarum[20] he describes a certain ""John Grammaticus"" (490–570) asking Amr for the ""books in the royal library."" Amr writes to Omar for instructions, and Omar replies: ""If those books are in agreement with the Quran, we have no need of them; and if these are opposed to the Quran, destroy them.""[21]

Al-Maqrizi (1364–1442) also mentions the story briefly, while speaking of the Serapeum.[22]

There is also a story in Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) which tells that Omar made a similar order about Persian books.[23]

true,ptitz,NETH,The Netherlands,"Well, like I said, the whole *unemployment* issue is sector-specific. On the other hand it's very debatable who's going to support whom in a decade or so. Chances are, the current ""ethnic Dutch"" proponents of curbing migration will sing an entirely different song when they are placed in a nursing home and there is just no one out there to care *for them*. They already have this problem in Japan, which historically has been a very isolated country. There they are even seriously thinking of ways to [automate nursing care](http://japandailypress.com/japan-pushing-for-low-cost-nursing-home-robots-to-care-for-elderly-2927943/) as well. Dutch population is ageing, 2005 had the lowest birth rates since 1900. If you curb the migration *right now* you will have a real trouble in a decade or two.

But besides the whole employment issues, you seem to have a misconception that these *benefits* are some sort of handouts which enable these pesky migrants to sit on their ass, leading a life full of luxury. Which is bullshit. And if you say that they *more often have no jobs*, are you implying that they are somehow hard-wired to be more lazy or less capable of holding one? One of the major reasons for these unemployment stats disparities is that a larger chunk of allochtone female population starts joining the work force. Now that's already breaking the culture boundaries if you like. There are other reasons too. But none sound more retarded than implying it's in their genes or something.

And talking about culture. Here you might be right, I'm not going to pretend that multicultural issues aren't there. But the sense of hysteria with which they are approached these days certainly isn't helping. Like for example I have a friend who came here for study and work from Spain, before the crisis hit. Now she decided it was in her interest to learn Dutch while she's at it, even though in her line of work she can get by with just English. So she went and did the state-sponsored course. What she actually learned was a bunch of bullshit about the royal family(including memorizing each sibling by name) and other useless nonsense. She still wishes to learn Dutch, but since she is occupied with more important stuff (like earning money), it seems quite pointless right now. Now you've got this whole debate how  integration courses should be made mandatory, some say that migrants must pay for these themselves and it's not in state interest to sponsor them.

true,TheMania,null,null,"I do somewhat agree with all of that again, it's just that to me anything that fails to address what is an inherent flaw in the system - one that every country has to have equally competitive export sectors, lest they find themselves drained of Euros - is merely a bandaid. Or rather, a ticking bomb, something that just puts off the problem until, say, one country suffers its own financial crisis, or a population aging faster than another, or any other kind of setback and we're back to where we are today.

I mean, we're discussing just Greece here. But have you seen what's going on in Spain? Youth unemployment &gt; 70% in parts. Ireland - the only escape anyone can find is in emigration, which is at record levels. Portugal. Etc. To say ""well Greece should have done XYZ"", and then a different set of prescriptions for each of those others.. to me it's clear the problem's not with the entire bottom third of countries that use the Euro, but rather with the design of it itself.

&gt; I very much support a common fiscal policy (which includes transfers), but apart from that there's somewhat more flexibility that those three options of yours, especially #3.

More than that. Once you have a government at the level of the currency-issuer, it never finds a shortage of people willing to lend it the currency it issues. This means that if your people want more savings... fine, just have the currency-issuer run a sufficient deficit, it isn't going to run out. Just look at Japan - quadrillion yen of debt, and yet people continue to loan Japan more yen - because what else are they going to do with it?

To me, this is essential. We just could not deal with an aging population with the current system where all money is debt and all entities are revenue constrained in how much debt they can sustain.

I mean, even today, transfers couldn't solve it without a government at the fiscal level. If Germany simply ""transferred"" Greece the money they need to be fully employed again, Germany itself would suffer badly. Either through rates, or through taxes so high that people can't work. A government not constrained by revenue in its borrowing could address the problem in the south *without* overly negatively affecting the north. It's what the Euro zone needs.

true,FleshyDagger,ESTO,Estonia,"The source I provided was a table from ministry of defence's ordinance that set conscription numbers for 2013 and 2014, and assigned them to units. It should be enough to settle the matter.

As for reservists, you seem to not understand the defence concept that is based on conscription. Estonia, as well as Finland and several other countries, do not keep a large active military, but instead run a small peacetime force that is tasked with training conscripts. After their training, these conscripts are assigned to reserve and continue their normal life (with refresher training now and then), but they are seen as fit for active duty for ten years from their training, and should the need arise, are called up with a mobilization. Thus the main fighting force is 10 years' worth of conscripts. They are sometimes called ""active reserve"" to distinguish them from those who simply sometime in their life got military training. For example, Finland's armed forces have trained 3.5 million conscripts in the past 90 years, and about 2 million of them are alive, but only ~350 000 or ten years' worth of them are considered the fit for immediate duty and thus added to active personnel (36 000, most of them conscripts in training) of Finnish armed forces to form the wartime size.

Romania abolished conscription in 2007. This means that by 2017, there will be no reservists who would be generally considered to be fit for immediate duty. So here's my question again: where are you going to take reserves from to boost wartime size? Are you going to rely on 40-somethings and 50-somethings with obsolete training, many of whom have never even seen the current equipment?

I believe my comparison of Estonian active personnel + active reserve + members of paramilitary organization against Romanian active personnel was the most accurate way of comparing size, considering the core differences between professional armies and conscription-based armies.

The only thing that you could pick on is that the Estonian wartime operational size includes the Estonian Defence League, a volunteer military organization, in addition to conscripts. If Romania has any similar organization, its size should of course be added to wartime strength.

For this week, I will add a ""Video of the Week"" section.  It will have one video every week, mainly documentaries and clips.  Also, there isn't much news, maybe because it's not a multi-week report.

Thursday was Armenian Genocide Rememerane Day.  I did a post here, and it got a huge response!  Thank you to everybody!

In other news, I actually did a collaboration comic on /r/polandball.  It was very interesting.  I enourage everybody to [check it out!](http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/23xwer/the_caucasus_according_to_caucasians/)

(1) [...] _Mehr als 15 Rad Fahrende dürfen einen geschlossenen Verband bilden_

(2) _Geschlossene Verbände, Leichenzüge und Prozessionen müssen, wenn ihre Länge dies erfordert, in angemessenen Abständen Zwischenräume für den übrigen Verkehr frei lassen_

Geschlossene Verbände dürfen im Übrigen nicht auseinander gezogen werden (müssen also zusammen bleiben, was bei mehreren Critical Mass Fahrten die ich gesehen habe, absolut nicht der Fall war), und ihr Führer hat trägt die Verantwortung, dass der geschlossene Verband die Verkehrsregeln einhält.  Die Schweizerische und Österreichische Rechtsprechungen dazu verlauten ähnlich.

Des Weiteren, obwohl ich auf den Pages jedes Radverbands, die ich nach Kommentaren zu § 27 StVO kurz durchlas, die Meinung fand, dass der Übrige Verkehr nicht behindert werden darf, oder zumindest nicht übermässig, gehen die Meinungen zu den rechtlichen Anforderungen hiermit auseinander.  

Wie schon geschrieben, ein riesiger Pulk von Radfahrern, die den Verkehr mit der Einstellung ""fuck you, wir haben eh recht"" blockiert, verdient (und kriegt) eh wenig Verstäniss von Mitbürgern.  Aber das sind ja sowieso nur Autofahrer.

Wenn die Critical Mass anständig und ordentlich im Verkehr fährt, und sich um ein Maximum an Repekt gegenüber Mitbürgern bemüht um das Argument zu machen, Radfahrer sind auch Verkehrsteilnehmer und haben Rechte, dann ist das Ganze eh irrelevant.

In 148 BC the Land of Modern Day FYROM was INhabited by the Thracians, The enemy of the Makedons . . and they existed there for hundreds of more years until the Slavic Push from the East. 

I'm sorry for being rude . .. but I Get EXTREMELY Angry at people making up facts like you do and other Revisionist of History . . . I would expect better from a Archaeologist.

Understand this . . There Ceased to exist a People called Macedonians in 148 BC. they assimilated with the other Greek City-States to form the Modern Greek person. . by the time of the Slavic Push circa 800-1,200 AD the idea of a ""Pure"" Macedonian was dead for a thousand years. 

The area of Modern Day FYROM has never been Macedonia . .this is the land of the Enemy of Macedonians in Antiquity. The Kingdom of Makedon is Entirely inside Modern Day Greece. 

The people of MOdern Day FYROM were called ""Vardaskans"" up until Late Ottoman times. They were ""transformed"" into Macedonians from foreign powers(mainly soviet) so they could claim Greek land and access to the Sea. 

If you are not on the Greek side of this issue you are an enemy of Greece, I don't give a fuck where you come from, if you try to distort history to paint these Slavic Scum who appeared 1,000 years after Alexanders death as ""Macedonians"" you are our Enemy.

Si les Français légaux ont tant de mal à joindre les deux bouts, quel avenir tu proposes aux clandestins ?

Quel travail tu leur donnes alors qu'il n'y en a pas pour les résidents légaux ?

true,TheBoardGameGuy,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;I think a center-right EU is best right now though, since it helps keep Eurosceptics movements at bay and lets people like the Tories at least somewhat build the case for continued EU membership.

In the UK, yes, people are more comfortable with a center-right government. In the rest of Europe, I do not think that is the case. Also, the EU already treats the UK too kindly (special deals all around), so I'm not buying that argument.

&gt;None of your concerns pose an existential threat to the EU, but if the UK, France, the Netherlands, etc. were to leave it would collapse.

I don't think there is a chance in hell that any existing member-state leaves the EU in the near future. The Euroscepticism is largest in the UK, and the Eurosceptics don't have even near a majority there. The latest poll I saw (today) said that UKIP will get around 30% of the votes.

But even if the UK left, the EU would not collapse. I like the UK, but it is not _that_ important.

&gt;The things you're concerned with should probably remain within each member state's own political systems -- imposing that on everyone is highly risky.

Yes, they should, but the politics of the EU effects national legislation quite a lot. If the EU continues being center-right after many years of already being center-right, the member-states will inevitably keep moving in that direction as well. I think it has gone far enough.

Do you not consider roads, hospitals, and schools infrastructure? Damn that evil white man for curing polio and providing clean drinking water!

&gt;Absolutely untrue. Do you think the United Kingdom would be this wealthy without ever having an Empire?

After two world wars Great Britain was bankrupt. In fact that's what killed the empire. Whatever wealth they had before that is irrelevant to their continued success. Never underestimate the British.

&gt;If they are middle class and are lucky enough to live in a heavily developed country. Even working class people in our countries cannot simply quit a job. Try telling a factory worker in Bangladesh to go get a real job. You are so fucking ignorant of actual realities. How middle class are you?

The point isn't that they ""get a real job"". The point is that they have the power to leave. Starving, disease-ridden Africans sail across the Mediterranean in leaky skiffs all the time. Do you really think it's a question of money?

It might come as a surprise to you but not everyone has an education. There are villages in Afghanistan only a few miles a part and the people don't even know that the other exists. There are cults that worship Prince William as a literal god. I'm quite secure in my assumption.

Furthermore as we have fractional reserve banking banks create money out of thin air so each state in the EU creates money through its financial institutions. People seem to also misunderstand trade balances. A country with a trade deficit doesn't have to be poor. The UK and US as an example have the highest trade deficits (US = $-784.775 billion and UK = $-162.973). Having a trade deficit does not mean that your economy will fail automatically. Looking at the biggest deficits according to WTO numbers in order the ten countries with the biggest deficits are:

1. USA
2. UK
3. India
4. France
5. Turkey
6. Spain
7. Hong Kong
8. Italy
9. Japan
10. Egypt

Greece comes in at 11, so blaming the Greek financial crisis on just trade deficits is plain ignorant and shows lack of understanding for basic economics. Furthermore a country can balance it's trade deficit with domestic creation of value or export of services. This is what Hong Kong does, it has basically had a constant trade deficit but produces enough value through services to be able to pay for the imports.

The Greek problem stems from a complete lack of respect for balancing their books. Tax evasion and poorly managed pension scheme's are also contributing to this. I mean blaming the fact that more than 100 000 people were claiming pensions from dead people on the Germans is just ridiculous.

This attitude has been fundamental to all pivotal points in human history, whether it is greek, roman, chinese or whatever. The world is fated to deal with a lot of bullshit in the next 20 years, but what will emerge afterwards will be massive European prosperity.


A state is a company, Europe is the birth of Western civilisation and the embodiment of the longest and most constant region of development. Regarding economy; If you know anything about economics you'll know that the innovator always dominates the market no matter how deep in shit they might of sunk - Microsoft is still around, Nintendo is still around, Greece is still dumps salt on everything, Italy is still making pizza, France is still made out of cheese.

... consumption doesn't create money, it moves it. From the bank account of the buyer to the bank account of the seller.

If a tomato seller is ""saving Euros"" by selling to others in Spain, those others are paying for those savings.

&gt; Furthermore as we have fractional reserve banking banks create money out of thin air so each state in the EU creates money through its financial institutions. 

Money is only created when people borrow, which was my whole point. Fractional reserve banking doesn't change this - banks create money **when they loan**, which has been my stance all along.

&gt; A country with a trade deficit doesn't have to be poor. The UK and US as an example have the highest trade deficits (US = $-784.775 billion and UK = $-162.973).

Of course not, but a country with high trade deficits *will have a lot of debt*. That's evident behind both the UK and US. The thing is, a country can have a lot of debt and not be poor **if that debt is denominated in their own free-floating currency**.

That is, if I owe you a lot of Euros, I am poor.

If I owe you a lot of tokens that I issue, I am not.

That's the difference between Greece and the US - the US's trade deficit is due to foreign nations (China, for instance), accumulating USD, which the US controls, and so the debt those trade deficits are racking up is inconsequential.

Same story with the UK - when a nation acquires pounds, the UK is drained of pounds - but it matters not, pounds come from the UK, it isn't going to run out of them.

Different story with Greece - when a nation acquires Euros at Greece's expense, it does matter, as it can will and did run out of them.

Do you follow? Because it's vital to understand the difference between owing something you issue, vs owing something you don't. The former's the US/UK/Japan/Australia, the latter's your household/Detroit/California/Greece/Spain. The latter's entirely revenue constrained in how much they can borrow and can find themselves in a position where people won't lend to them any more, the former is not.

Japan doesn't run out of yen, the US doesn't run out of USD, Greece/Spain/Ireland/etc do run out of Euros.

Too bad that this issue is not reported on media or discussed in parliament. It's fiction suited to stroke a particular narrative.

The majority of Greeks have accepted that whether Greece has a right on WWII reparations or not, it doesn't matter, because Germany politically controls Europe.

&gt; Basically every country in Europe was part of the war and no one else whines over it anymore.

...the Allies within continental Europe certainly got quite a few of territorial cessions from Germany. In the case of Greece, they only got a hungry population, powerful guerillas on the north, a ravaged industry and a non-existant economy.

Though an interesting exception from the Allies who both got territorial cessions AND still demanded reparations is Poland:
&gt;After German reunification, Poland demanded reparations again, as a reaction to claims made by German refugee organisations demanding compensation for lost property. In 1992, the Foundation for Polish-German Reconciliation was founded by the Polish and German governments, and as a result Germany paid Polish sufferers ca. 4.7 bln zł. There is an ongoing debate among Polish international law experts if Poland still has the right to demand war reparations, with some arguing that the 1954 declaration wasn't legal.

During the Greek Civil War, Greece was a participant of the Marshal Plan (though of course not to the extent of Western Germany, despite there being a war going on). It never really got anything back from Germany.

I can't think of low-calories cheese except perhaps cancoillotte but it's not something you get in restaurants (it's some kind of by-product of cheese you can buy in pots and spread on bread).

Ist schonmal ein sehr guter Ansatz. Noch genauer sagt ihm das eine alte Frau und nämlich dann, als er sich unter Menschen befindet.

Man muss den Nietzsche nicht gut finden, seine Werke sind keine Bibeln, auch wenn sie so gut geschrieben sind. Den Zarathustra hab ich als 18-Jähriger gelesen, was viel zu früh ist. Ich habe Vieles nicht verstanden und das Meiste falsch verstanden. Mit 30 habe ich mir den dann nochmal vorgenommen und da ging es schon erheblich leichter von der Hand und die Erkenntnsigewinne waren ganz andere. Ich denke, für den Nietzsche braucht man ein abgeschlossenes Studium oder zehn Jahre Berufserfahrung, oder so ähnlich.

Wichtig ist auch, dass die Literatur im Kontext von Zeit und Gesellschaft betrachtet wird, in dem sie entstanden ist. Das heißt also, eine Eins-zu-Eins Übetragung von 130 Jahre alten Aussagen in die Gegenwart ist nicht immer möglich, und umgekehrt können heutige Wertvorstellungen nicht ohne Weiteres auf diese Aussagen angewendet werden.

In deinem anderen Kommentar hast du das schon erkannt: Ich habe diesen *Zeit*-Artikel bis jetzt noch nicht gelesen und werde das wahrscheinlich auch nicht tun - vor Allem, weil mich diese öffentlichen Scheindiskussionen von als kontrovers betrachteten Büchern nicht mehr sonderlich interessieren.

Diese ganzen Bücher sind Ausdruck eines Gefühls und die Verkaufszahlen geben in etwa das Interesse an diesem Gefühl wieder, möglicherweise auch eine Stimmung in der Gesellschaft. Statt sich ernsthaft mit diesem Gefühl in der Gesellschaft auseinanderzusetzen, genügt es uns, den zu köpfen, der es gewagt hat, aus der schweigenden Masse hervorzutreten. Diese Hinrichtung wird manchmal mehr, häufiger jedoch weniger gekonnt durchgeführt.

Das ist der Reinigungsprozess in unserer Gesellschaft: Wer es wagt aufzufallen, wird vernichtet. Dass diese ganzen hetzerischen Gedanken fest in der Mitte unserer Gesellschaft verankert sind, wird komplett ausgeblendet, denn dieses Problem lässt sich nicht mit einem einzigen intelligenten Feuilletonartikel lösen. Es ist für die Gegenposition immer angenehmer zu behaupten, der Störenfried wäre ein Einzeltäter. Wir lügen uns dabei aber häufig selbst in die Tasche.

Ich denke, unsere Gesellschaft ist schlecht gewappnet gegen solche Angriffe.

Allerdings.

&gt;Mit 30 habe ich mir den dann nochmal vorgenommen und da ging es schon erheblich leichter von der Hand und die Erkenntnsigewinne waren ganz andere. Ich denke, für den Nietzsche braucht man ein abgeschlossenes Studium oder zehn Jahre Berufserfahrung, oder so ähnlich.

Kann bei manchen Sachen so sein, Ich würde aber soweit gehen und behaupten, dass ein bereits vorhandenes literarisches/philosophisches/politisches/soziologisches/psychologisches (=allgemein gesellschaftwissenschaftliches) Interesse -wenn es denn auch gestillt wird- diesen Prozess enorm beschleunigt und einige Aspekte aus der eigenen Lebenserfahrungen frühzeitig ersetzen kann.



&gt;Wer es wagt **(zu) negativ** aufzufallen, wird vernichtet.

FTFY

&gt;Es ist für die Gegenposition immer angenehmer zu behaupten, der Störenfried wäre ein Einzeltäter. Wir lügen uns dabei aber häufig selbst in die Tasche.

Ne eigentlich nicht. Hab in den letzten Wochen tatsächlich schon mehrere Porträts (u.a. von der Zeit) über die (etablierten) Milieus in denen solche Gedanken aufallend ihr Unwesen treiben gelesen.

&gt;Besonders unserer journalistschen Elite fehlt es meiner Meinung nach deutlich an Qualität, oder der Freiheit, diese Qualität auszuspielen.

Nicht unbedingt. Qualität muss man immer suchen. Und beim Journalismus unserer Wochenzeitungen, der sich ja vorwiegend mit geisteswissenschaftlichen  Themen beschäftigt ist schonmal klar, dass manche diese Qualität gar nicht suchen, weil (ich drücks jetzt mal so platt aus:) Bild nunmal die leichtere Kost ist und vielleicht auch lustiger zu lesen und mit mehr Bildern ist.

Ich muss ehrlich sagen, dass Ich das Problem noch nie im Angebot, sondern doch eher in der Nachfrage - und den Nachfragern gesehen hab.

Außerdem -und das finde Ich ganz wichtig- können auch einzelne Menschen in unserer Gesellschaft dahingehend etwas verändern indem sie aktiv an der gesellschaftlichen Debatte teilnehmen und den Sarrazin/Pirincci-""Kreiswichsern"" mal zeigen was los ist.

Ein Verwandter erzählte mir zb von seiner Erfahrung mit einem Bekannten seiner Frau, der im Wohnzimmer ""Mein Kampf"" stehen hatte.

Da kommen dann die üblichen ""Hat ja doch Recht gehabt""-Phrasen, obwohl er das Buch nicht mal aufgeschlagen - sondern nur im Schrank stehen hatte. Echt irre.

Blöd war nur, dass ebendieser Verwandte ""Mein Kampf"" gelesen hat. Irgendwann -nach bereits mehreren Besuchen- waren Sie dann aber auch so weit, dass der Kerl nach einiger Aufklärung den Inhalt des Buches realisiert hat und postwendend scharf abgelehnt hat.

Da hats dann auf einmal ""Klick"" gemacht: Genau das müsste in hunderttausenden deutschen Wohnzimmern passieren.

Deswegen schrieb Ich ja auch weiter oben, dass solche Bücher ideal gelesen werden sollten - und dann persönlich verrissen. Das gibt auch in jeder Diskussion einen enormen Autoritätsvorteil und dementsprechend sehr  viel Gewicht der eigenen Argumentation.

true,bobdole3,UNSA,United States of America,"There's a number of key differences between the buildup to WW2 and what's going on with Russia which you're not taking into consideration. With Hitler, you have to take into account that before the war actually started, he had been building up for years in defiance of the law. The victorious powers from WW1 drew a line in the sand, and then did nothing while Germany crossed it. Then they'd draw another line, which Germany would then cross without consequence. Even the final line, the invasion of Poland, was crossed it took almost six months for the British and the French to actually do much of anything. 

Further, while Germany was building up its military capabilities and expending in power and territory, the British, and French were hemorrhaging capabilities. Their armed forces underwent serious cuts, and a general wave of pessimism about war gripped t he population.

Neither of these two things have occurred with Russia so far. Russia violated international law, and now their economy is taking a downturn due to economic sanctions. It's not a crippling blow, but it shows that the West is not pleased with their actions.

Even more importantly though, the disparity between military forces is absurd at the moment. In conventional forces, Russia is massively outmatched by NATO forces. NATO has more troops, better troops, larger amounts of superior equipment, and multiple staging grounds which can be used to attack the Russian homeland. There's no way for Russia to win a conventional confrontation. In terms of nuclear weapons, Russia might technically have more, but that's a distinction without a difference; each side has enough to reduce the other to ash. Everyone looses in this situation. Either way you look at it though, from Russia's perspective any confrontation with NATO is a no win situation. This is a far cry from the military situation in Europe during WW2

As for North Korea, it doesn't really matter if they're aggressive or not, they simply don't have the capacity to start a World War. If China doesn't come to their aid (and there is reason to believe that it won't), then North Korea is limited to a regional conflict.

&gt; Ich glaube, wir sind unterschiedlicher Meinung betreffend Autos und deren Rolle in der Gesellschaft

Das scheint so. Für mich sind Autos einfach nur ein Mittel um von A nach B zu kommen. 
&gt; und ich werde nicht versuchen, dich meiner Meinung zu überzeugen.

Überzeugen nicht, aber ich höre gern Argumente/Gründe von 'der anderen Seite', einfach um ein besseres Bild zu bekommen. Daher auch öfters mal mein etwas schärferer Diskussionsstil der schon an Streiten grenzt. Ich möchte den Gegenüber aus der berühmten Reserve locken um die echten Argumente zu hören, die die Person für sich selbst 'entdeckt' hat.

Nun, in jedem Bereich gibt es Ideologen und Puristen. Wenn dieser Teil aber überhand nimmt und eben nicht mehr nur eine Randgruppe ist, dann hat man irgendwo ein Problem das gelöst werden will, ansonten hätten solche Randgruppen nicht solche Zuläufe.

Wegen dem 'aufs Dach hauen und anmotzen', letzteres hab ich des öfteren schon einmal gemacht wenn ich wusste das der Fahrer/die Fahrerin mich hören kann. Allerdings ist das oft die Folge eines absolut unverantwortlichen Verhaltens des Autofahrers, welches eine Vollbremsung meinerseits zur Folge hatte (bspw. blockieren des Radstreifens, 'klauen' der Vorfahrt obwohl Augenkontakt bestand und der Autofahrer sehen konnte das ich ein beträchtliches Tempo drauf hatte. Scheibenbremsen sei dank ist nichts passiert...).

Da ich als Fahrradfahrer keinerlei Möglichkeit habe einen Autofahrer auf mich aufmerksam zu machen, wenn dieser die Fenster zu hat, würde ich in einer Gefahrensituation auch durchaus mal aufs Dach schlagen, ist bislang aber noch nicht vorgekommen. Ich hoffe das wird es auch nie.

Mir wäre es übrigens am liebsten, wenn Fahrradfahrer durchgängig auf baulich getrennten Bereichen fahren. Abgetrennt von der Straße. Wenn ich die Chance habe auf einem Gehweg zu fahren, nutze ich diese auch. Dafür müsste dieser Bereich aber auch entsprechend 'gepflegt' sein. Im Idealfall asphaltiert. Damit wären so gut wie alle Probleme gelöst.

Let me add some more info to the discussion. Russia's defense budget has risen 92% since 2010. And they are going to double their defense budget in the next three years. 

The objectives are clear: by 2020, to have 1 million active-duty combat-ready personnel equipped with the most modern weaponry and equipment. Adding to the already existing military vehicles are 2300 new tanks, some 1200 new helicopters and planes, 50 new surface ships and 28 new submarines. Also, 100 new military communications satellites are going to be deployed into space.

This happens in a time when many of the EU countries that are part of NATO have reduced their military spending due to the economic crisis. Of the 25 European members of Nato, only Britain, Greece and Estonia met an unofficial target of spending at least 2 per cent of national income on defence last year. The average figure was only 1.3 per cent. Also, the UK, for instance, is intending to reduce it's [""regular army troops to their lowest number since the Battle of Waterloo, to roughly 82,000 by 2018, and to withdraw all its 20,000 troops stationed in Germany.""](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/27/world/europe/europe-begins-to-rethink-cuts.html?_r=0)

What is keeping NATO alive is the US military spending. However, the US military is spread out to it's limit with their presence in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Also, the US economy hasn't yet recovered from 2007. Politically, I don't think Obama has the political strength to do anything more than diplomacy. Furthermore, 2016 elections are coming and the balance of power in both Congress and Senate has more than once showed that it will be hard for any politician to raise US debt even further. 

Add all of these factors in and the advantage you claim exists, exists only on paper. It is clear to most of the analysts that this aggressive pressure on the Ukraine by Russia happens because Russia knows it will win this faceoff. Putin knows he can do what he's doing not because the World doesn't want war but because NATO can't answer back like it once could.

Da molti anni, anche avendo superato quel periodo, mi ronza dentro il desiderio di costruire un dispositivo software che elabori dati in ingresso da una rete di recettori e sforni un output su una rete di effettori, e che funzioni al suo interno mediante alcuni dei principi che regolano l'attività del sistema nervoso: non una rete neurale come nelle implementazioni note, ma una autentica simulazione biologica, capace di evoluzione nel tempo.

When Antonis Kantas, a deputy in the Defense Ministry here, spoke up against the purchase of expensive German-made tanks in 2001, a representative of the tank’s manufacturer stopped by his office to leave a satchel on his sofa. It contained 600,000 euros, about $814,000. Other arms manufacturers eager to make deals came by, too, some guiding him through the ins and outs of international banking and then paying him off with deposits to his overseas accounts.

Mr. Kantas is also fueling a broader outrage here, particularly toward Germany, which has berated Greece for the financial mess it finds itself in. Mr. Kantas’s testimony, if accurate, illustrates how arms makers from Germany,  passed out bribes liberally, often through Greek representatives, to sell the government weaponry that it could ill afford and that experts say was in many cases overpriced and subpar.

The first is that, while Russia's increase is surprising, it's still not actually all that much. Russia is spending about $90 billion. France and the UK are each around $60 billion. Germany's around 50, Italy's around 30. Already we've more than doubled Russia's budget. The US meanwhile spends about $500 billion accounts for something like 40% of *global* spending. Even with predicted buildup for 2020 (which is hardly assured to happen), Russia is still outnumbered. Iraq and Afghanistan have been expensive, but the US has only deployed a fraction of its military force in each, not to mention that both of those conflicts are winding down, freeing up those forces for use elsewhere. Even if you completely discount the rest of NATO, the US alone would be more than capable of defeating Russia. 

As for why russia is taking an aggressive stance on Ukraine, it's true that it will win that face off, but you're misunderstanding why. Russia is picking its battles *because* it can't afford to get into a fight with NATO. It attacked Georgia because it wasn't within NATO's sphere of influence, and it's meddling in Ukraine for the same reason. Russia is trying to grab as much territory as it can before NATO expands and gobbles it up.

**When Antonis Kantas, a deputy in the Defense Ministry here, spoke up against the purchase of expensive German-made tanks in 2001, a representative of the tank’s manufacturer stopped by his office to leave a satchel on his sofa. It contained 600,000 euros, about $814,000. Other arms manufacturers eager to make deals came by, too, some guiding him through the ins and outs of international banking and then paying him off with deposits to his overseas accounts.**

**Mr. Kantas is also fueling a broader outrage here, particularly toward Germany, which has berated Greece for the financial mess it finds itself in. Mr. Kantas’s testimony, if accurate, illustrates how arms makers from Germany, passed out bribes liberally, often through Greek representatives, to sell the government weaponry that it could ill afford and that experts say was in many cases overpriced and subpar.**

OK - also meinerseits, ich fahre des öfteren Auto weil

- es günstiger, flexibler, und viel unkomplizierter ist, insbesondere mit Gepäck, vom Zuhause meiner Frau in Köln zu mir nach Hause in einem Ausserort von Zürich, bzw. zum abgelegenen Dorf meines Vaters zu fahren
- meine Frau öfters hochhackige elegante Schuhe trägt, ÖV in Köln manchmal ziemlich schlecht sind, und Taxis brutal ins Geld gehen wenn man mal essen gehen will
- ein Auto mir die Flexibilität gibt, schnell beim OBI, Ikea, oder anderswohin etwas holen zu gehen, in den seltenen Momenten wo ich mal Zeit habe
- ich öfters an abgelegenen Orten fotografieren gehe
- wir in verschiedenen, an unterschiedlichen Orten gelegenen Läden einkaufen gehen und nicht den halben Tag im Tram bzw. der U-Bahn oder Bus verbringen möchten
- im Sommer Leute in den ÖV öfters zum heiteren Himmel hoch stinken (und anscheinend immer noch nicht die Kunst des Aussteigen-lassen-vorm-Einsteigen gemeistert haben)
- ich meine Mutter am Flughafen mit Gepäck abhole, und wir trotz Wohnung in der Stadt verkackte, langsame ÖV-Anbindungen haben
- sowohl ich als meine Frau oft spät oder von irgendwo im Unkraut draussen von der Arbeit zurückkehren
- wir gerne mal ein Wochenende in einem Ort im Abseits verbringen
- ich gerne Auto fahre
- es regnet
- ich viel Zeugs dabei habe
- ich nicht schwitzen will

Ich fahre Rad oder gehe zu Fuss wenn's schön draussen ist, wenn ich Zeit habe, wenn ich nicht gross beladen bin, wenn ich keinen schönen Anzug trage, wenn ich kein im-Verkehr-Stehen riskieren will, und und und.

How hot your apartment will be really depends on how it is oriented. If you have west-facing windows with lots of light--it will be a sauna and it won't cool down well at night. If you are up on a higher floor and have a little terrace or the ability to open up windows, things will cool off at night. Mornings are usually nice and cool until around 2pm, then it starts scorching. We use ""persianas"" (blinds that roll down) here to keep the light out from 14:00-19:00. The siesta in July/August--if you choose to stay here--is for real. And it's great if you don't fight it.

I really like August in Madrid. (And, I actually think July is hotter, temperature-wise.) Especially the kitschy verbenas (street parties) mid-month in La Latina and Lavapiés. It's a fun time. You just don't do anything until after 8-9 pm. 

We get by without AC, just evaporative fans, lengthy museum visits, copious amounts of gazpacho, and hardcore lazing to cope. Maybe think of buying a fan for the bottom of your laptop if you have one, so it doesn't blow up. Otherwise, I'm sure you'll have a good time, especially if you are a night person.

We also have a strong tradition of allotments from WW2 rationing and so many people grow ornamental flowers and lawns at home but have land elsewhere to grow food on. The climate makes a big difference as well, the further South the milder it is and the easier to grow stuff, I found when I lived up North people were more likely to value natural landscapes than cultivated gardens simply because they don't get the same reward for the effort as you do down South. Most people who own their property will have some flowers or fruits and vegetables, just having a lawn or decking or paving is the low maintenance option and is usually associated with rented properties or with those who haven't the capability to garden, perhaps working very long hours or disabled.

&gt;Top public schools in each major city are more ""prestigious"" than any private school.

In the chaotic transition from communism  to a ""free"" market, almost all newly opened private school were scams. It's just a lot easier to make money by simply selling degrees, than by actually educating and failing students. 

This has established a firm perception in everyone's mind that private schools are crap. And that's been a great benefit to many public schools. Many but not all. Different public schools definitely have different reputations. It's just that no private school has as good a reputation as the best public ones.

&gt;Top universities are also public.

Really the same pattern as with schools. Chaotic transition, new private universities tend to be degree mills. Established a perception that public universities are better. But if you have enough money you still want to go the top US schools.

&gt;There is no pursuit for popularity in schools like in American movies.

I think that's true of almost everywhere that's not the US. Including Western Europe, Japan, China and other places. I think there's definitely a uniquely American culture regarding schools.

&gt;Discrimination because of wealth is rare 

Everyone hates the nouveau riche. The perception is that their wealth is mostly ill gained. But the wast majority of regular people are close to each other in income. And the nouveau riche are few and far beyond everyone else.

Germany - Everyone votes for the CSU because they fancy Merkel, FDP hilariously wiped out, three mainstream left parties remain stagnant and bunch of new crazies walk in.

Italy - centre-right eat each other, Five Stars gain second place, Democrats win and everyone else dicks around at threshold level.

Greece - PASOK (lol) vanishes as does LAOS; ND loses a bunch of seats and Potami, Syriza and Golden Dawn burst into Parliament.

Spain - PP tepidly win and PSOE are a close second, but third parties (IU and UpyD) increase spectacularly.

Portugal - Socialists beat governing Social Democrats.

Ireland - Labour wiped out, Sinn Fein gain plurality and independents reach new record vote because all Irish parties suck. (No offence to Irish people intended)

Sweden - All members of government coalition are punished and left-wing parties gain accordingly.

Denmark - As above, but the *right* reap the electoral rewards.

Finland - everyone loses seats to the Finns.

Hungary - Fitna burn opposition hard, Jobbik reap some rewards, left continue their spiral into hell.

Belgium - Flemish Alliance triumph and pretty much demolish all other Flanders parties. Labour win Waloonia, just.

Netherlands - Labour and Christian Democrats severely weakened. Socialists and D66 gain seats, while liberals go tepid. Wilders party remains strong.

Austria - FPO, SPO and OVP essentially tie in first; while NEOS and the Greens scrabble in fourth and fith for remaining seats.

If the income is more equal in a group of people, the people become more happy regardless of the relative size of that income.

People are happier to live in a group where every body earns 100 euros, than when they live in a group where there is a big class distinction, like 25% earns 50 euros , 30% earns 75, 40% earns 100 and 5% earns 200 euros.

People in Eastern Europe might be much poorer, but the wealth is relatively spread out. (I know, there are a lot of people both corrupt and not that earn much more than most people, but you have to look at the size of the people that do not, and the poor people that are more equal in income or much larger).

While their environmental policies are backwards, I just don't see how they come across as racist, unless you consider Australia's immigration policy racist too. Additionally, if anything I feel the media are biased toward the status quo. I struggle to take BBC's, Channel 4's or Sky's interviews with UKIP seriously for the reason that they rarely ever seem interested in UKIP's actual, deeper policies. It's always about the latest scandal regarding 1 of hundreds of members. ""20 years ago, man A made a racist comment..."" Indeed he did! But *why* didn't you sensationalise this a few years ago when man A was still part of the Labour / Conservative Party? Why was the effort made to dig this story up as soon as the member moved to UKIP?

I don't hate the EU either. I just don't like where we are with it right now. In fact, I'd *love* to see a strong and efficient EU. But...Either we federalise, or we drop it. This awkward 'Stuck in the middle' position isn't doing anyone any favours. We're expected to run our own country *and* manage membership responsibilities? For me that takes up too much resources. Our people will never move closer to integration with public opinion being what it is, so why keep draining resources waiting for a better Europe to happen? It won't happen until tighter integration. With this in mind I want what I've always wanted - A strong, flexible, economically trustworthy U.K. And we can't have that in this awkward middle ground.

This is probably already downvoted to oblivion, but I'll finish with my own opinion. I've listened to interviews, read through the previous manifesto (I don't know if their current one is up yet, but policies have hardly changed too much...), I just *agree* with them on most of the points they bring up. This isn't a freak phenomenon, people are *listening* to UKIP, and seeing an ideal vision for their country. And the result? UKIP are tipped to win this May's European elections, with polls suggesting a 31% victory compared to 2nd Place Labour at 28%. 

We're seeing Cons, Labour and especially the Lib Dems playing catchup now because of this. These parties are, in my view, out of touch. UKIP's immigration plan is not racist. What we're doing is normalising unprecidented immigration levels - We give public services some time to catch up with the high population, and then we resume with an *Australian*-like immigration system, not a sectarian or racist one. 

If someone can give me some solid proof of Nigel's secret Nazi plot, I'm all ears. Otherwise...Well, you know what they say! *Don't barrage the Farage.*

true,SkyPL,SILE,"Poland, Lower Silesia","Erm... I thought I explained that already. Excessive farming is the cause why *every day, 288 hectares of farmland are lost*. 

What would you expect farmers to do? Preventing landslides in any ways other than seeding trees with a very deep root system (not all kinds of trees give you the effect) and waiting till they grow to hold the ground and prevent landslides is extremely expensive, it's usually done by sticking few meters long poles into the ground. It's not feasible for anything else than dedicated constructions like building houses on a hill and preventing landslides of a risky ground right above it.

Planting trees can be done, sure, but it almost never happens. Reasons are quite obvious: it takes minimum several years till trees develop roots long and strong enough to make a difference, and the density of trees per acre depends on many, many factors, in either case: you give up a notable portion of land (and by this: income) to something that might or might not pay off (first of all there's a risk landslide will happen before trees are ready, and secondly there is a hope that it'll never happen (some types of the ground are more prone to landslides than the others), so noone risks loosing money on expertise, seeds, and wasted space). 

Oh, and to make things even worse: You can't just plant these trees on your own farm and think it'll prevent the landslide - they need to be planted in specific, crucial locations where landslides might begin, and that means some people might be forced to sacrifice all their land for the good of others. Reaching an agreement on something like that is next to impossible. Even more so because after the landslide you still can farm that ground on a next season.

Mostly through the trading of slaves and precious metals. Even with outside assistance in the modern age, it's still a dump. Whether or not you think my geography skills are up to snuff, the fact remains that north and east africa are genetically and culturally distinct from their cousins to the south. 

&gt;sorry to say, but Africa south of the Sahara has been a dump for the last 6000 years of recorded history. Sub Saharan Africans had no written languages and lived in huts made out of straw until they became slaves to the north Africans, Arabs, and Europeans.

I'm not seeing any goal posts being moved. Both statements claim that they were extremely primitive before contact with civilizations to the north. Why wouldn't genetics and culture impact the historical achievements of a civilization? For instance, in some of today's African cultures there is a belief that raping children will cure diseases.

Ton absence de réponse en dit long : tu n'en fais rien car tu n'as rien à leur proposer. Ils doivent rentrer chez eux car il n'y a rien pour eux ici.

&gt;la dépense des bénéficiaires est plus faible que celle de la population générale

C'est faux. Elle est plus faible que les gens qui ont la CMU mais plus élevée que la population générale.

*les dépenses en soins qui concernent les bénéficiaires de l'AME, essentiellement hospitalières, auraient coûté en moyenne le double de celles des assurés du régime général : soit 3 200 euros (8 000 euros en région parisienne en 2002) contre 1 500 euros*

Renvoyer ces gens chez eux serait bien plus efficace et humain.

I am not totally against the idea. It would be propably one of the most important moments in the Union's history. Because of Turkey's location and it's involvement in the whole Middle East, welcoming them as a EU member would mean a major shift in the Union's interest in this direction.

With that being said,I think, having the Middle East as a top priority for EU's actions would be hard to compromise with interests of current members states. It is hard to expect, what is going to happen on the EU's eastern border with Russia being apparently eager to start another Cold War. We will propably also need to engage in stabilising the situation in North Africa, not only to secure member states' interests but also to prevent further massive illegal imigration.

Then comes the trade deal with the USA. It's propably still going to take some time before both sides agree on it's terms but it's also going to take much effort before and after signing it to keep the trans-Atlantic trade relations in the right balance.

What I'm trying to point out is, that the EU has many geopolitical challenges to face in the next years. I don't think the member countries will have enough resources to add the Turkish integration to the list. We should not forget, that Turkey is considered a regional superpower and it always has a say, when something is happening in relation to Syria, Iran, Israel and rest of the region. Having the Turks on board, their business would have to become our business.

Even if Turkey underwent a huge change, democritising it's society, growing a secular middle class, providing environment for people from rural regions to stay and work at home instead of just emigrating, even if they met all the criteria for new members, accepting them into the EU could be too big a chunk to chew for us. And as for now, I don't even see the country going in the right direction. Not only is PM Erdogan constantly violating democratic principles, even worse there still seems to be no reasonable alternative to his rule.

All thing considered, we should treat Turkey in a special way. There is no other country like it and we do share many common interests. They will have to be taken into account when building EU's strategy in the region and there is a huge potential in trade with their ever growing economy. To be taken seriously, the EU must stop pretending, that Turkey may join it one day, instead, it must offer a strategic partnership with profits for both sides.

TL;DR It's an interesting idea but it's close to impossible in short-and mid-term. Instead we must form a close partnership.",0,1398642646,null,0,false,0,ch3oyjw,t3_244o43,t1_ch3oyjw,t3_244o43,null,1433549518,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

In Budapest's City Park, every year, there is a part where all the sundry far-left grouplets have their own stands, and I think the main socialist party usually has a stage with music acts etc. In previous years I also saw a stage with bands and so on from the far-left Workers Party (who still think Kadar was a hero), but I think last time I went they were down to just a stand.

In the Netherlands, May Day is a regular working day, and pretty much nothing is done. 

When I was a kid (in the 70s), there would at least still be local indoors May Day meetings, held by the Labour Party and maybe some of the small left groups; there was one in our suburban town of 50,000.

A number of years ago (a *fair* number - maybe ten or so) my dad and I decided to go to a May Day meeting, for old time's sake - my idea actually, though he was pleasantly surprised. I think there were only four or five left in the whole country, but one conveniently took place, like every year, in The Hague, at the monument of Troelstra (early 20th century Labour Party leader). There were a couple hundred people; 200 maybe? The most elderly sat on fold-up chairs at the front; most of the rest, bar a few Young Socialists and a couple of kids, were middle-aged. A choir sang socialist and other left-wing songs; middle-aged speakers said nothing memorable; but a young local Labour politician in his twenties gave a surprisingly passionate and engaging speech, which the pensioners much liked. 

When the Internationale was played, he was also the only person under 50 who could still sing along, but the old people stood up from their fold-up chairs for the occasion and sang every word.

true,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"I think we can all, mostly, agree that free trade amongst the European nations is a desirable goal. To that end, a free trade agreement is required. In order for that to function as well as is possible, some institution that can harmonise rules, make trade offs between the interests of the separate nations, and act to integrate the economies is required. That institution is the EU. 

Every country that is in the EU came to that conclusion, i.e. that pooling some of their sovereignty with the others was a worthwhile trade off for the free trade and economic opportunities it would bring. 

The requirement for the parliament comes from the desire, or rather necessity, to lend that institution democratic legitimacy. Any organisation that makes laws should be accountable to the people. The EU makes laws, exercising the sovereignty that it was lent, and therefore it must be democratic. 

That's about as simple as it can be. 

To move back through the reasoning from the otherwise, as it's always interesting to look at it that way. The parliament lends the institution democratic legitimacy. That is necessary as the institution as a whole exercises powers lent to it by the national governments, and so requires the oversight of the people. Being beholden only to the national parliaments would be insufficient. The national parliaments gave the ability to create laws in certain areas to the EU as they viewed it as the best course of action. Their goals may have differed but they included amongst them ensuring peace in Europe, boosting the economies of their nation, and increasing the clout of Europe by acting together. 

Whether it was successful in those goals is a question up to you to answer. If the answer is yes, then the expense (decreased sovereignty and money) was worth it. If it wasn't, then the price was not worth paying and you should seek a refund. Personally I think we are richer, more peaceful, and more influential as a result of the EU. The pros outweigh the cons and I do not believe, despite what some parties in the UK would have us believe, that we can keep most of the pros while dumping the biggest cons/costs I.e. Free movement, the monetary contribution, the bureaucrats and so on. ",0,1398645894,null,0,false,0,ch3qbh9,t3_244mob,t1_ch3qbh9,t1_ch3prk7,null,1433550222,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

true,ultimomono,5,Linea 5,"Oh, sure! It's the Verbena de San Cayetano, San Lorenzo, and La Paloma (this last one ""la verbena de la paloma"" has a famous zarzuela written about it). Each one centers around a different church and part of the neighborhood. But don't let that make you think it's a conservative sort of religious celebration--todo lo contrario. It's pretty hedonistic--a small dose of the sacred with a massive helping of the profane.

The church of San Cayetano is on Calle Embajadores, between La Latina and Lavapiés--his day is August 7. The parties and procession are in the side streets around there (Calle del Oso) and the Plaza de Cascorro. This is the smallest of the three and kicks off two weeks of low-level debauchery. San Cayetano's mystical claim to fame is that if you grab a flower from his float, you'll have good luck finding a job in the coming year--which has, as you can imagine, gained in popularity in recent years. I like this one--it's mostly neighborhood peeps. Lots of older ladies dancing paso dobles to bad disco, alcoholic limonada, etc. The other two draw people from all over.

San Lorenzo is the 10th of August (coinciding with the yearly Perseid meteor shower, which is called ""las lágrimas de San Lorenzo"" here) and that verbena is centered around the Plaza de Lavapiés and Argumosa and the little streets around the church at Doctor Piga 4.

La verbena de La Paloma wraps things up. She is city kind of saint--an aparition of the Virgin Mary with a pigeon. Her church is in La Latina and the party spills out to almost every street in the hood, to Las Vistillas, the area around the church of San Francisco, etc. 

It's pretty crazy and mixed up, with the many bars catering to their particular scene--traditional castizo abuelo types, heavy metal disciples, hipsters, pijos, Eurovision lovers, older Movida types, salsa, punk, ska, gay disco fabulous folks, even little kids. At some point, everyone ends up on calle Calatrava packed into  the street like sardines, all mixed together in a sea of bodies bopping around singing Spanish ""canciones de verano"" from the eighties at the top of their lungs at 3am. 

There's live music--some of it so atrocious it's hilarious (think Achy Breaky Heart in Spanish seguing into Bésame Mucho--drag chulapa competitions, an ""encierro"" where guys in bull costumes chase little kids around the neighborhood, contests for fanning, poetry, tirando piropos (coming up with the best lines/compliments), dancing the chotis, etc., etc.

There is no use for a written language in hunter-gatherer societies - written language is generally the product of cities and agricultural societies because of the need to document massed stored food materials. It is almost entirely created for administrative purposes, nothing more. It would be counter-productive to invest time into writing when it provides your society with no material benefit. 

Secondly, it would be an equal waste of resources to construct shelters out of anything valuable because nomadic lifestyle reaps no benefits from a permanent settlement. Earlier forms of agricultural practice in more southern areas of Africa were that of pastoralism - nomadic cattle herding. It also made no sense to establish permanent settlements in this circumstance either, when a static house could very well doom your herd and your chances of survival when they outstrip their food supply.

Those that weren't nomadic, you've dismissed as ""spears and feathers"", because apparently, they should have been doing something different, like...? 

Then, finally, no contemporary anthropologist recognises such a thing as a ""primitive"" culture. There are cultures that exist which find different solutions for perceived problems, and you, for some reason, are criticising cultures for not solving problems which didn't exist until the ""civilizing"" white man turned up to take their resources. 

Then your assertion about sub-Saharan Africa and the subsequent great civilizations of Africa being ""primitive"" is also true of Europeans, who were ""elevated"" by other cultures on account of them being only hunting and gathering animists at the time. 

While you are right in that writing systems did generate independently - most notably being those in Mesopotamia and Mesoamerica - those found in Europe are derivatives of near Eastern systems. A single origin and the subsequent spread of an idea or people (unigenesis) is much more common than the same thing happening in several locations at once (polygenesis), though of course, not impossible. Given that Europe was so openly exposed to the near East, with no natural barriers between the people there and elsewhere (unlike the Far East, Southern Africa or the Americas). So it is quite safe to say that Europe greatly profited from this openness.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"I'm going to argue that there are laws that individual member states can't realistically introduce by themselves, but this needs a bit of an explanation first.

*The* central project of the EU is the Single Market. There have been other projects recently, like better coordination of foreign policy, but almost the entirety of laws, rules and regulations, that the EP enacts are related to the Single Market.

Do *not* confuse the Single Market with a free trade area. We have free trade with South Korea, that's not the same and to understand the distinction is absolutely crucial if you want to be able to form and informed opinion about the EU.  
I believe the best way to exemplify this is the CE mark. You've seen it thousands of times, it's those ubiquitous two round letters that you can find on the packaging or in the manual of almost any non-trivial consumer product you can buy. It means that the product was made to comply with EU regulations about everything from product safety to environmental standards.  
Before the EEA, each country had its own set of regulations. So, if you wanted to sell a product, you had to pay lawyers and engineers to make sure it complied with all the regulations in each individual country you wanted to less it in, and with many products even go through an expensive and time consuming certification process. With the EEA, the largest market in the world, manufacturers take those regulations into account right at the beginning of the product design phase, and when they have it certified in one member state, it can be sold throughout the EEA.

This isn't merely a matter of practicality, but it makes the EU enormously powerful. If an individual country had tried to introduce something like the two year warranty or the recycling quotas for electronic products or cars on its own, most manufacturers would have probably decided that selling their product there simply wasn't worth the cost. They certainly wouldn't have designed something around the requirement to recover materials just to access a small market like e.g., Denmark. So, the animal testing ban for ingredients in cosmetic products would be one example for a law that individual countries couldn't have, realistically, come up with themselves. But since the EU did it, this pretty much ended animal testing for cosmetic products globally.

It's similar with tings like environmental regulations that limit emissions or pollutants locally where things are produced, work conditions and so on. If an individual country enacted those on its own, manufacturers would move their production one country over, but when a ban on keeping chicken in battery cages covers the entire continent, they have no choice but to comply. Free trade can't do that.

We have a common data protection directive. It may not be obvious, but this is also connected to the Single Market. It means that a company in country A can serve a customer in country B and have the data processed by e.g., a payment service provider in country C, without consulting an army of lawyers first. Individual members couldn't have limited roaming charges from ISPs in another on their own, and so on.

If we want a Single Market, that as I have explained is different from a mere free trade area because it has a common set of rules and regulations, then the question arises how we agree on those regulations. This requires a common legislative, and that legislative better had the democratic legitimacy it needs to make such decisions that deeply affect people's lives. And that's why we need a European Parliament. As an added benefit, we're in a much better position when we negotiate trade agreements or other international matters as the EU than as individual countries.",0,1398655569,null,0,false,0,ch3unwt,t3_244mob,t1_ch3unwt,t1_ch3prk7,null,1433552336,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

People have already explained to you that colonialism did no favours for the African economy. Now you're acting like they should have uh... ""caught up""? Given the disparity in income and development in these areas, it's fucking stupid to think that would even be possible, let alone expected. 

People have already explained to you both reasons: you tried to state that colonialism was beneficial. People showed you that you were wrong. You tried to assert that the cultural traditions of Africa lacked the ability to develop cities and grand civic organizations. You were shown to be wrong. So now you've changed the subject again, and moved to: ""BUT WHAT ABOUT NOW?""

    (defclass neuron (discharger synaptable)
      ((out-potential :initform 10.0 :type float :accessor out-potential)
       (action :initform 
    	   (lambda(self) 
    	     (mapcar (lambda(x)
    		       (send-potential (to x) (potential x)))
    		     (out-synapses self))))))

Questa è la definizione di una classe (neuron) che eredita dalle classi 'discharger' e 'synaptable': cioè ho messo a punto gruppi di features desiderate in classi base specializzate che poi incorporo nel mio oggetto.

Da qui inizi a vedere una caratteristica tipica: il CL - senza imporlo - incoraggia in maniera naturale uno stile di sviluppo incrementale o 'bottom-up'. 

Le espressioni seguenti sono la definizione di due slots della classe; il primo (out-potential) è un numero, ma il secondo (action) è una funzione (in Lisp le funzioni sono oggetti di prima classe), definita 'al volo', che chiama una seconda funzione, anche questa definita al volo, su tutti gli elementi della lista delle sinapsi in uscita da questo particolare neurone (tieni presente che, data l'ereditarietà, faccio riferimento a campi delle classi base, quindi non definiti qui). 

Spero di essere riuscito, attraverso la nebbia dei tecnicismi, a darti l'idea della flessibilità, modernità e potenza incredibili di questo linguaggio che, dicono, è il secondo linguaggio di programmazione più anziano ancora in uso dopo il FORTRAN.
