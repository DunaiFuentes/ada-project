Per gli oggetti, una volta ho trovato una piccola boccettina sigillata di un liquido misterioso. Per sicurezza ho chiesto online in giro cosa fosse, dopo lunghe ricerche e' emerso essere una piccola boccetta di bolle di sapone (in italia non ne ho mai viste di quel formato). Poi ho trovato dei lego (figo perche' io sono un enorme fan dei lego), qualche collanina carina etc.. Una volta abbiamo trovato in una cache un sofficino findus (quei pupazzetti che davano dentro le confezioni). Fatta un'altra cache, ne troviamo un'altro.. Avanti cosi' finche' non ne abbiamo fatti su 5 o 6, evidentemente qualcuno li aveva sparpagliati prima di noi :)

quanto a luoghi, sicuramente niente batte il bunker.. era dalle parti di brunico, in mezzo a un bosco.. era una specie di montagnola, un macigno che pero' era finto, fatto di cartapesta e cemento, della seconda guerra se non sbaglio.. o forse era piu' recente.. nascosta c'era una porticina e una scala che portava all'interno, dentro c'erano due piani, con ancora le targhette ai muri delle varie stanze e delle grandi cisterne per l'acqua.. pensa che ne abbiamo parlato alla proprietaria dell'albergo li vicino dove dormivamo e non ne sapeva niente :) certi posti li trovi solo col geocaching

Dentro il libretto di solito si scrive solo nome e data e magari la provenienza, perche' molto spesso e' piccolissimo. Se e' piu' grande, molti team hanno un timbro (me compreso) col loro logo o degli adesivi da attaccare, oppure si puo' scrivere qualsiasi cosa.. saluti, frasi d'amore quello che si vuole. E' bello vedere magari dei log di gente straniera venuta da lontanissimo :)

Mostly the Bruxellois, not walloons. I think nearly all those famous comic book drawers are from Brussels. French was always seen as the *cultured language* by the bourgeoisie and Dutch was for the commoners. It also helps to have the large market of France at hand with very few linguistic diversity in it. The Flemish market is 6.5m pop. and even then you have the dialectic divide which makes it inaccesable for the Netherlands and usually other Flemish dialect speakers, think of Ch'ti every 20km.

For comparison, only 5.4% of people in Southeast Ukraine would be willing to take up arms against  threats from Russian forces [2]. 

Finland is also EU country. What part of ""Let's have all trade with EU stopped and our foreign assets frozen and hope that they greet us as liberators at the end?' sounds like good idea?

For example, the traditional thing people think about when they think ""Communist"" is the USSR. Big bad guys. This was brought about, as you say, by Vanguardism. However its form became something that it wasn't intended to become, due to Stalinism. Stalin created this giant, nameless, faceless, unaccountable bureaucracy, which up until his reign was pretty much counter to Communism/Socialist movements. So much so that other forms of Communism sprung up specifically against him, eg. Trotskyism. That's not even going into modern Socialism, which is mostly geared towards democratic reform, or even mentioning the other forms of Revolutionary Socialism that did not believe in the Vanguard at all.

What was meant to be created was an extremely decentralized government, governed by Soviets, i.e. worker's councils, from the ground up. All the power was meant to lie with the people at the bottom. Hence the name ""Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"". 

Many would argue that this is not anti-democratic, but is even a purer form of democracy than what is already practiced. It, like the representative democracies in Italy and Germany, got derailed by a politically savvy mover and shaker in its seminal period.

There's no such thing as a democratic revolution. Even revolutions to install a version of democracy are not democratic in nature. So, I don't think that's much of an argument.",1,1400520269,null,0,1400521877,0,chlw786,t3_25xjv5,t1_chlw786,t1_chltxis,null,1433864521,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Eine Imagekorrektur ist höchstens insofern nötig, als die AFD in der Tat immer wieder als homophob oder migrantenfeindlich dargestellt wird. Für dieses Image kann die Parteispitze aber selbst m.E. weniger als die Medien, für die allein die Kritik an der Gemeinschaftswährung schon ein Sakrileg darstellt, welches nur durch Ausländerfeindlichkeit erklärbar scheint. 

Der Spiegel-Artikel ist in seiner Unausgewogenheit im übrigen ein gutes Beispiel für den Willen, das Image der AFD genau in diesem Sinne zu beeinflussen, da klare Absagen an Ausländerfeindlichkeit und Homophobie einfach nicht als solche gewertet werden, sondern stattdessen das Gegenteil als Tatsache vorausgesetzt wird. 

Ein Bekenntnis zum traditionellen Familienbild birgt nicht per se eine schwulenfeindliche Haltung. Andersherum wird dies im übrigen ständig ebenfalls behauptet, also daß ein Bekenntnis zum Schwulsein keine Nachteile für Heterosexuelle bedeuten würde. Beides ist nach meiner Meinung auch richtig. 

Bezüglich der Immigration ist bei der AFD zu lesen, daß die Zahl der Asylbewerber erhöht werden soll, während die sonstige Einwanderung nach dem Vorbild Kanadas stärker geregelt werden sollte.

There you have the benefits of this relationship to the UK. There are clear and undeniable benefits. Does the USA benefit more? I personally think that's an impossible calculation. But, based on your own evidence: the UK invests less into this relationship, yet also stands to lose considerably more.

&gt; I argue us to consider this fact and be more wary of allowing it such privileges.

The US invests more in foreign countries than the UK in this respect (this being the influencing of foreign governments). I completely agree. Should that be the case? Morally speaking, no it shouldn't. But we are engaged in similar activities, albeit on a smaller scale. Morally speaking, one would argue we too should change. This doesn't prove anything with the quality or worthiness of the alliance though.

&gt; but that it is openly belligerent and competitive, worried about it's own world dominance

So your answer to this is to distance ourselves from the USA, thereby making us much more likely to be on the receiving end of such a policy.

A NATO operation. i.e. one involving the US and many European countries (in the Cold War and against communism no less). If it was the US alone, there'd be more of a point here.

You have a dubious deal at hand and you're glad you're not getting nothing?Not a good way to build a relationship.

&gt;But we are engaged in similar activities, albeit on a smaller scale.  Morally speaking, one would argue we too should change.

I am not in this for the moral argument. Let someone else make that. I am arguing from a selfish standpoint. I wish my own safety and prosperity, and this is achieved by adequate political system. I do not wish to be ruled by a foreign power, or have one influence my environment. The UK's and other countries own ambitions can be set aside, the important part is to not have other countries unduly influence us, first and foremost, without adequate political representation.

&gt;So your answer to this is to distance ourselves from the USA, thereby making us much more likely to be on the receiving end of such a policy.

Appeasement of a belligerent is aid to his belligerence. But let's not focus that. I am in favor of a ""firm handshake"" stance to the US. Creating a EU that can stand firmly to the benefit of its members and deal with the US on a quid pro quo basis. US spy bases in the UK should be accompanied by European spy bases in Virginia.

&gt;A NATO operation. i.e. one involving the US and many European countries (in the Cold War and against communism no less). If it was the US alone, there'd be more of a point here.

We keep coming to this idea that European countries are equals to the US. We are not, we are too easily influenced and manipulated. There were European participants, but the results clearly show that national governments had little control over the project.

Però la scaletta è incredibile, Mangum dice tre robe in croce lungo tutto il concerto (principalmente ""thank you""), ma ha un carisma devastante e quella voce lì. Loro ci mettono passione, sono affiatati e le robe che devono fare sono tecnicamente semplici.

Il punto è che hanno quei pezzi lì: per cui lacrimoni quando chiude con two headed boy pt2 che ti spacca a metà, e grandi salti durante holland 1945 e song against sex, un casino festoso con un delirio di percussioni e fiati e banjo e un sacco di altri strumenti a cazzo.

Il palco lo tengono bene, ma perlomeno a Dublino il 50% lo ha fatto il pubblico.

Ma era un po' quello che mi aspettavo.

Io comunque ci sarà sicuro a Ravenna, stavo pensando anche di farmi la data di Padova se trovo qualcuno dei miei amici che se l'accolla.

Are there russian solders within the ukraine supporting the local forces? How are those protestors all well equiped military people? How many of those forces are actually ukranian? I don't know, but we *do* know that in crimea, lot's of them were russians.

To pretend that russia has nothing to do with this, after we saw the exact same thing happeing in crimea, and insists that russia is really all nice and shit because the USA is actually the devil is a ridiculously naive way to look at the world. You can argue over details and semantics all day long, but you might want to take a step back and look at the messy, confising, bigger picture of things.

Those events don't make any sense if you take russia out of the picture. I might even say that from Putins point of view, this is a smart, calculated move. Doesn't mean that it's a good thing. Americas foreign policy makes a huge amount of sense too. Doesn't mean that it's a good thing either. Sitting on your ass, not interfering, upholding moral principals in a world were most of the planet doesn't give two shits about human rights might be a really bad idea in the long run too.

Shits complicated. The right thing to do is not necessarily the smart one. More often than not, there is no ""right"" thing to do. If the US does something bad, it doesn't necessarily mean that the alternatives were better. But what really puzzles me is how you people can ignore all the shit russia has done in the last 20 years and go on about how bad the US is, how it's all US propaganda, because *this time*, maybe somehow russia might not doing the things that look like what they've been doing for the last decades / just a few months ago.",0,1400527866,null,0,false,0,chlzr46,t3_25x96s,t1_chlzr46,t1_chlyln5,null,1433866190,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

This is a big argument. Maybe too big. There is AFAIK no effective indication for this. Yes, there are more military exercises going on. No, the German gouvernment is still selling old and new weapon systems (Assault Rifles, Tanks and IFV's, Missiles, Submarines ...) instead of keeping them. No, the Bundeswehr is still not capable of fighting such a big war. No, politicans and most importantly the majority of the people are strictly against any kinds of war. 

What i find really interesting are these words from ""Charles_Knause"" a commentor below the article:

&gt; Some sources seem to be indicating that NATO has been undergoing a slow transformation where the center of gravity and the central command apparatus seems to have passed from Washington to Berlin. [...]

And:

&gt; One of the pre-existing conditions that the present situation has inherited is the mistaken assumption that Germany is not a nuclear power. The US through NATO has turned over to German control hundreds (perhaps thousands) of various types of nuclear warheads. Combatant commanders in the field have been delegated the authority by NATO to be able to use such ""tactical"" nukes based upon their own best judgment regarding any potential situation that they could conceivably be facing that would warrant such use.

--Don't yell. Americans talk way louder than French people-- be aware of how loud your voice is and probably lower it.

--Always always approach any interaction by saying Hello/Bonjour first, then saying whatever else you have to say. Never just walk up to someone and say something in English-- this is considered rude both because you didn't greet them AND because you assumed they speak your language. This includes buying stuff and asking directions or for information.

--Greet employees when you come in to small shops and when you leave again. Also the bus driver.

--Try not to dress like a total tourist-- comfortable shoes yes, slobby clothes no. You'll be treated better if you look as if you care

--Ignore the gypsy/Rom kids, sail through them without response, and watch your wallet when they're anywhere nearby. Also, backpacks are asking for trouble/pickpocketing

--Don't be nice to annoying people who prey on tourists. Just ignore them

--If you go to a farmers' market, take photos discreetly. The merchants get annoyed at tourists who never buy anything

--Don't put ""love locks"" on the bridges. It's become vandalism. http://nolovelocks.com/2014/03/16/a-bridge-too-far/

--The new chic area is around the Canal Saint-Martin/La Villette/République

--Don't walk three abreast on crowded sidewalks; if you go slowly on stairs or moving walkways, stay on the right side (the Germans do this too; there are often signs that say Rechts stehen, links gehen or ""right to stand, left to walk""); don't expect people to stop because you're taking a photo

--Flirt, joke, humanize people you deal with and you'll be treated better

--Never be afraid to ask waiters lots of questions about the food-- they'll respect you for it (if you actually care). Restaurants in touristy areas with menus out front in four languages are to be avoided. Many restaurants in Paris have English-language menus-- just ask. If the waiter doesn't speak English, maybe the person at the next table will.

--You can use metro tickets on the buses and they are fun because you can see where you're going.

I responded with sarcasm because I thougth you where asking me if journalists are kidnapped by soldiers, which is infact the whole point of the article we are commenting on. There's even a picture of soldiers with an imprisoned journalist. I didn't realize that you were so incredably dishonest (or too stupid to understand my point) that you where actually asking me if I claim a physical impossibility.

Like what? Btw, how is your braindead question not deflecting from the comment I made? Remember?

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"&gt; why else would the federal US government give that money to exactly the kinds of states who usually do nothing but wine about taxes and the federal government?

It is ironic that they are the largest recipient of federal funds. Many of the programs were started during the great depression, so by design they automatically transferred wealth from rich to poor states. As taxation was federalized fiscal policy began to become a tool for economic stimulus. The federal spending programs now take into account the relative economic benefit an area will get from a program, which more often than not is in a poorer state. 

The first income taxes were to pay for war efforts in the 1800s (unless you count British income taxes previously). So no, this was not the original intent. But at that time the dollar wasn't a strong currency, and different states had different competing currencies. 

As the dollar became federalized and even global, the federal government had to target discrepancies between rich and poor states with targeted spending. 

I was curious so I took US Census data and made [this chart](http://i.imgur.com/VBwFCLN.png). Even though the disparities between the top 25 income states and the bottom seem relatively persistent if you look at the trend it shows something interesting. During the time the chart covers many states suffered severely from outsourcing and industrial decline. This is pure speculation, but I think federal spending had to play a part in making sure low income states did not experience further decline than high income states. The trend is largely cohesive despite very different economies. ",0,1400532453,null,0,false,0,chm1uji,t3_25wiqo,t1_chm1uji,t1_chm09ba,null,1433867178,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I've never *ever* heard anyone call it ""Irish Gaeilge"". It'd be like saying ""French Français"" or ""Spanish Español"".  

&gt; but calling it Gaelic isn't wrong as Irish is Gaelic.

Irish is a Gaelic language just as French is a Romance language, but Irish is the official and academic name for the language in English, not Gaelic. If you go to your book store and buy a ""Gaelic dictionary"", you'll end up with the wrong language. Foreigners continue to call it Gaelic but from an Irish perspective it's wrong.

That's the only Irish language organisation in Ireland today that uses the term 'Gaelic' in its English title.

The Gaelic League was founded in the 19th century at a time when 'Gaelic' was often used to describe *any* indigenous Irish culture, same goes for the Gaelic Athletic Association.

&gt;On peut prendre l'exemple des Tartares de Crimée, Poutine les a defendu corps et ames, et au moment ou il s'est accaparé la Crimée, c'en était fini
 
Sans déconner, les Tatars ont une représentation adéquate dans toutes les institutions gouvernementales ainsi que la légalisation à leur profit des terres qu’ils avaient réquisitionnées illégalement et sur lesquelles ils continuaient de vivre sans aucun droit ni garantie.

removed the Ukrainian flag, harassing verbally and physically female employees.*

C'est le LoCoCouncil qui valide les candidatures de LoCoTeam (ubuntu-fr a renouvelé sa candidature, et devra le refaire bientôt).

Et une LoCoTeam à le droit d'utiliser la marque Ubuntu (goodies, site web,…), et comme c'est Canonical qui à les droit de la marque Ubuntu, c'est comme cela que l'on est ""lié"" à Canonical (donc on ne rend pas de compte à Canonical et ne travaillons pas pour eux, on rend des comptes au LoCo Council, leur prouver que l'on organise des événements sur Ubuntu et les logiciels libre ou que l'on propose un support tel que la doc ou forum, l'ensemble des dons récolté nous servent à fabriquer des CD/DVD, d’occuper de nos serveurs,…).

true,MrKnot,null,null,"&gt; 1) Perché alcuni grillini vennero espulsi dal M5S per aver partecipato a talk show e oggi Grillo andrà da Vespa?

All'epoca Grillo disse che avevano violato il codice di comportamento nei rapporti con i media; se ricordo bene gli interessati smentirono che vi fosse alcun codice di questo genere. Nella pratica, Grillo e Casaleggio ci tengono moltissimo a controllare l'esposizione mediatica dei grillini: andare in tv va bene, ma solo se si è avuto il permesso. Grillo essendo Grillo e il portavoce del moVimento, si può dare il permesso da solo.

&gt; 2) Perché Grillo nega solo oggi di avere preso 60 milioni in nero dall’impresario Liguori quando la notizia era uscita 3 anni fa?

Boh, ma non ci leggerei chissà che. Può semplicemente non aver mai dato particolare peso all'illazione, anche se chiaramente fa strano da uno che capeggia un movimento discretamente forcaiolo.

&gt; 3) Perché il M5S tiene un comportamento manicheista?

Il manicheismo è una delle caratteristiche costituitive del moVimento. Serve a compattare i grillini in modo che non si facciano tentare dalle alternative e crea una mentalità di gruppo che permette alla leadership del partito grande libertà d'azione perché si sta lottando dalla parte del Bene contro il Male. Se noti, fra gli argomenti preferiti dei grillini quando vengono criticati c'è ""beh invece tu voti per quelli che...""; il manicheismo è necessario per cementare questa mentalità e anestetizzare lo spirito critico.

&gt; C'è una grande mancanza di chiarezza e trasparenza da parte del M5S che è un movimento politico fondato in gran parte sulla Casaleggio Associati, tant'é che il blog www.beppegrillo.it (pieno di pubblicità) linka a siti di Casaleggio (ES: ""Tze Tze politica"" e ""La fucina"") arricchendo la sua azienda.

Qui i grillini ti risponderebbero che non c'è niente di male, Grillo vende onestamente i propri spazi pubblicitari e prodotti mediatici. Io invece lo trovo estremamente disonesto e un palese caso di conflitto di interessi, visto che beppegrillo.it è la sede ufficiale del movimento in base al Non Statuto. Di fatto Grillo ha posto la sede di un movimento politico su una sua proprietà e sfrutta commercialmente il traffico che questo gli garantisce intascandone i proventi (piuttosto, invece, che devolverli al movimento).

&gt; Scusate la stupida associazione ma in questo mi ricorda i Testimoni di Geova che da casa editrice sono diventati una religione, la Casaleggio Associati da azienda di servizi online è diventata ""quasi"" un partito.

Già. Oggettivamente il M5S è un partito azienda, ma a differenza di Forza Italia che era un partito-azienda degli anni '80 che la gente bene o male la metteva a libro paga), il M5S è un partito azienda degli anni 2000, che la gente non la paga e la fa lavorare gratis con la carota e il bastone.",0,1400534414,null,0,false,0,chm2rgu,t3_25yztc,t1_chm2rgu,t3_25yztc,null,1433867616,21,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,21

France and the USA are on top of the list and the next countries are way down (Spain, China, Italy if I remember correctly, each get half as many tourists - so they're on a totally different ball park).

However, when it comes to money from tourism, the USA is number 1 by far. That's because the average spending of a tourist in the US is much higher.

Tourist countries are rather interested in the average spending per tourist. That's the goal. The US wins on that. Mostly because it's a big country with only Canada and Mexico as geographical competition. So a tourist who goes to the US will likely stay longer and thus spend more money. Non-European tourists in France will likely visit another neighboring country while they're at it. Because they want to get their money's worth and see other countries in one trip.

So you should be glad you're technically winning when it comes to the benefits of tourism, in sheer free money given to your economy by foreigners.

You don't need to worry, it's not subject to additional taxation. It's foreign income and thus subject to another country's taxation.

&gt; Secondly I find it so confusing with tuition calculations

Typically, Italian university tuition is calculated based on an index called ISEE. Calculating it is a bit of a technical thing, so most people have it done by either a public office (the Milan municipality has several) or by private services.

&gt; but I am still uncertain of how much I have to pay and who I have to include in the calculation of my family

For legal purposes, your family is the group of people that a) you live with abitually and b) you are related to by blood or law. In addition, to calculate ISEE you also add anybody you are a dependent of, even if you don't live with them (e.g. if you live in student accomodation but you are still your parents' dependent, you include them).

How's your Italian? there's a wealth of information on this stuff to dig through, so if you speak the language I could give you a lot more pointers.",0,1400535678,null,0,false,0,chm3cfj,t3_25y3pu,t1_chm3cfj,t3_25y3pu,null,1433867894,2,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,2

Qui, due considerazioni:

La prima è che nonostante l'etichetta dica Peroni (in grande) Nastro Azzurro (in piccolo), nessuno usa la seconda parte del nome - nemmeno Peroni nel fare pubblicità - e la maggior parte della gente non nota la scritta in piccolo, tanto che se dici Nastro Azzurro non sanno di cosa tu stia parlando.

La seconda ovviamente riguarda il claim: La Peroni non è la birra più bevuta in Italia. E nemmeno la Nastro Azzurro, che io sappia. Il Gruppo Peroni, l'insieme delle etichette che possiedono (Peroni + Nastro Azzurro + ...), forse.

My translation (apologies for any mistakes, I blame my not being Swedish):

&gt; ""When will you journalists realize that it is deeply rooted in the culture of Islam to rape and abuse those women who don't conform with [its] teachings. There is a large correlation between rapes in Sweden and the number of immigrants from MENA countries.""

My opinion about it:

MENA countries have a huge issue, but the name of that issue is Patriarchy, not Islam. Well, Islam feeds into Patriarchy, like most other religions (curious, that, isn't it), but rape and abuse are obviously not the norm among Muslims, and claiming that it is serves no other purpose than inciting hatred of an already vulnerable minority in Sweden.

Looking at a satellite image of Australia, it's obvious that the desert starts halfway into Queensland and New South Wales. The rainfall in those areas is basically nothing and for most of the year there is not much or no cloud cover.

If you plastered those areas with solar panels you could get most of your electricity from this one source - transmission lines would run for 500-700km. That's not nothing in terms of loss but still entirely manageable. Adding a few offshore parks of wind and voila, you've got yourself a completely renewable electricity production.

&gt; Well, Islam feeds into Patriarchy, like most other religions (curious, that, isn't it), but rape and abuse are obviously not the norm among Muslims, and claiming that it is serves no other purpose than inciting hatred of an already vulnerable minority in Sweden.

It's pretty relative. Honour killings have roots in preislamic arabia, specifically the honour culture and view towards women. Honour violence and oppression are things that happen regularly. For instance brothers who want to ""revenge"" because their sister likes a guy and the guy likes her back. This isn't something unique for Islam but general middle east. To quote [wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing#Europe)

&gt; The issue of honor killings has risen to prominence in Europe in recent years, prompting the need to address the occurrence of honor killings.

&gt; It mainly affects women, who are its most frequent victims, both in Europe and the rest of the world, especially in patriarchal and fundamentalist communities and societies.

In Sweden, there was a case where the father shot his daughter because:

&gt;  ...she had refused to accept Kurdish traditions of arranged marriages and instead chose a relationship with a Swedish man, Patrick Lindesjos.

In Sweden we've had six convictions of honour killings, however there is a lot of hidden statistics on this subject mainly because it's difficult to prove. People don't want to testify. Women are thrown off balconies and then say they fell. 2/3 of the interviewed support groups say that women who come there say their parents invites them to commit suicide. 1/3 of the support groups heard cover ups of honour killings.",0,1400539918,null,0,false,0,chm58ah,t3_25yo2g,t1_chm58ah,t1_chm411m,null,1433868780,13,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,13

J'ai essayé de m'endormir en les écoutant mais je n'ai pas réussi. 

Les deux journalistes sont nulles. 

Voici un résumé (les deux sont d'accord sauf si je le précise) :

Économie : il faut de la rigueur mais aussi de la relance (avec quel argent on ne sait pas). Il faut aider les pme à obtenir des prêts. Junker est un peu plus hostile à la dépense publique. 

Immigration : l'Europe est une terre d'accueil, mais il faut des règles communes. Le dumping social c'est pas bien. 
Schulz propose de répartir certains immigrés entre les 28 états (on ne sait pas comment).

Les deux sont d'accord pour réformer l'Europe. Les problèmes locaux doivent être résolus au niveau local. Il ne faut pas que L'UE se mêle de tout. 

Il faut rééquilibrer l'Europe. Ça doit être fait au niveau des États. La France doit gagner en compétitivité. Les eurobonds c'est pas nécessaire car les taux sont bas. 

Attention désaccord : Junker dit que la rigueur permet plus de croissance. Schulz dit que c'est plus compliqué, et que la spéculation a fait augmenter les dettes souveraines . Les deux sont d'accord pour dire qu'il faut réduire les dettes (on ne sait pas comment). 

Diplomatie : il faudrait plus de concertation et de coopération et de cohérence dans la politique étrangère européenne. La France a sauvé l'honneur de l'Europe au Mali et en centrafrique (mais rien sur une possible aide européenne pour l'intervention). 

Sur la Russie, on ne pouvait pas rester sans rien faire. Ils ne croient pas à la guerre en Ukraine (pas d'invasion russe).

Conclusion : 

Junker : il faut tout faire pour réduire le chômage.

If you are just trying to collect the sites, the whirlwind tour is good. If you want to meet people spending longer is better. If possible, an open itinerary without a rigid plan might allow you to have the most fun. Having fun in Berlin? Stay a couple more days.. I think Hamburg, Berlin and Dresden are all worth longer stays and are all very different cities. I think it would be a shame to not spend some time going along the Rhein, with castles around every corner and wine everywhere. Really beautiful region that would be worth quite some time. 
You should be able to get cash just fine with an ATM card. Keep in mind that credit cards are seldom used in Germany, so don't rely on that. 
The German idea of ""camping"" is generally highly prepared lots, typically where you have easy access to fresh rolls in the morning because anything else would be uncivilized. ""Wild"" camping is rare and mostly illegal. Regions where you can just ""Set up camp"" are much much more common in the U.S.

I also second the recommendations for Cologne or Heidelberg (have heard lovely things about Leipzig, but have not been). Heidelberg would give you a flavor for a city not quite as big and is a really nice place, though it maybe has too many American tourists! Anyway, there are so many awesome things to see that you can't go wrong.

Right, I forgot about that.

When it comes to Czech and Slovak languages, they are similar enough to be called mutually intelligible (i.e. when you can communicate with a person using your language while another person uses his/hers). So in this case the difference is so small, that one does not need to put much of an effort in communicating. So just to sum up, there are three key points:

* Czech and Slovak languages are mutually intelligible
* It makes very little effort to speak the other language
* English is taught in every Czech school yet only fraction of people have enough of courage (and opportunity) to use it in practice

These two guys are playing clowns, with their deliberate overacting, the suggestions of slapstick and the unsubtle gags. This is fine in mainstream German culture, and illustrates the point I've been making for years now: the German comedy hero is a clown who transports you away from real life to a better place. This doesn't go down well in America, where the comedy hero is a wisecrack who teaches you to get the better of your enemies with wit and humour, or in Britain, where the comedy hero is a loser who teaches you how to survive everything life can throw at you by laughing at your own misfortune. Hence the perception in the English-speaking world that Germans have no sense of humour.

It's not true of course -- and I have to say this, because I am forever being jumped on by Germans who think I am saying that German humour is crap. I'm not, although I personally don't enjoy it: I'm saying it's excellent, but just different because it comes from a different culture.

Il processo é piú simile a quello delle stampanti di Shapeways (il tipo di stampante che puó stampare una pistola o una chiave inglese) rispetto alla classica stampante reprap da 1000 euro.

In sostanza (molto ELI5 e sostituendo molta sssscienza con della ottima magia) si riempie una camera di metallo vaporizzato (immaginalo piú fine del borotalco, una nebbia di particelle di metallo finissime) e un laser molto potente viene sparato in un determinato punto. Il punto in questione si scalda quel tanto che basta per fondere la polvere che gli gira attorno, andando quindi a creare una sottilissima e strettissima ""lingua"" di metallo dove é passato il laser (ovviamente per fare una area ""piena"" bisogna passare a zig-zag molte volte, come se dovessi colorare l'area di un disegno con una matita molto fine). Questo crea uno strato di metallo, per creare un oggetto basta sovrapporre abbastanza strati (se non hai presente: immagina quelle sculture fatte di ""fette"" di legno o di cartone sovrapposte, [-tipo cosí-](http://laughingsquid.com/wp-content/uploads/head1-640x480.jpg) ma con strati piú sottili)

[-IMG-](http://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/slm-nasa-cusing-rocket-part-640x353.jpg) Esempio di cosa viene creato da una macchina del genere.

Il vantaggio é che si possono costruire strutture molto complesse in un pezzo unico. Questo riduce il numero di giunzioni e quindi i punti di fallimento: se avviti ogni vite potrebbe rompersi o allentarsi, se saldi ogni saldatura potrebbe portare con se imperfezioni che potrebbero cedere a causa delle sollecitazioni (é per quello che in impianti che non possono permettersi fallimenti, come nel caso delle centrali nucleari, si fanno le radiografie alle saldature).

Riguardo alle temperature: il pezzo finito resiste alle stesse temperature a cui resiste il metallo di cui é fatto. Di solito per aiutare il metallo a resistere a temperature estreme (specialmente quelle dei razzi) o si fa in modo di non raggiungere quelle temperature o si raffreddano costantemente le parti che non possono evitare di surriscaldarsi.

Ad esempio tutti i tubicini che vedi in [-questa immagine-](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/eande-f1scale.jpg) (uno degli ugelli del razzo Saturn) hanno lo scopo di tenere la parte alta dell'ugello (camera) a temperatura accettabile (ci passa all'interno il carburante prima che questo venga iniettato nella camera di combustione, con il doppio effetto che l'ugello rimane ""fresco"" e il carburante si surriscalda, aumentando di pressione e temperatura fino a raggiungere quelle ideali per essere iniettato). Senza quei tubicini l'ugello si scioglierebbe (letteralmente, immagina una barretta di cioccolato nel forno, stessa cosa)

So in this case the difference is so small, that one does not need to put much of an effort in communicating. So just to sum up, there are three key points:

-    Czech and Slovak languages are mutually intelligible
-    It makes very little effort to speak the other language
-    English is taught in every Czech school yet only fraction of people have enough of courage (and opportunity) to use it in practice

true,nolok,null,null,"Two rules about ""niceness"" that seems to make american people feel we're weird/arrogant if they don't know in advance

1 - french don't smile by default when talking to someone, we smile when we genuinely like someone, say something nice, etc ... By default a seller, waiter, etc ... Will not smile to you. That is not considered rude. He won't smile to french people either.

2 - french might use a lot of small swearwords in their everyday speech, but they're actually very polite in their conversation. If you talk to someone, including someone serving you like a waiter, you're expected to say hello (""bonjour""), please (""s'il vous plait""), thanks (""merci""). Again, this is not arrogance, this is the reverse of point 1, while we don't smile by default we use those very polite phrasing for every little things. Not using them will make whoever you're talking to feel like you are disrespectful.
Reading this you might think ""of course I say thank you after someone help me"" but you would be surprised at the amount and scope of things we say it for, again this is our equivalent of smile by default.

A couple more:

 - You're in Paris, this is a large capital full of busy stressed out working people, random passerby are as likely to be happy being stopped and asked for stuff as they would in New York, London or whatever. If you need help that you feel is going to take more than a couple of sentence, ask the younger or older people. Or go to a bar, buy a coffee and ask the waiter. This is true in every big city, but somehow people tend to judge the french on that :)

 - Trying to speak a little french first, even if horribly broken, will help smooth thing a whole lot. Our language is very important to us, we have a culture of it being the only language needed, so we don't feel as natural with people talking to us directly in english. Call it cultural smoothing.

 - To go along with the previous one, no matter how good your french is, people who speak english will probably try to revert back to english as soon as possible (like, on their first or second sentence). Please don't take it about arrogance about the language ('how dare they speak french'). French is heavily tone based, the right word said in a slightly wrong tone becomes impossible to understand or mean something different entirely ([see this](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/135/a/7/french_by_mellapants-d34ugq0.png) :P). We even have trouble understanding other french dialect who have derived too much from our own like canadian. More info [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/255511/reasons_to_like_france/chead9o)

Bonus round:

The waiters on large tourist restaurants (like on the Champs Elysées) are the most obnoxious and rudes ones you can find, this is not french being french this is people who have to deal with tourist 100% of their time and know they will get clients and tips no matter what. If you want a good time, go in a restaurant or brasserie in any random ""smaller"" street.


Also, don't take these advices as too important, while they're true they should not impede on your fun, the most important part is that you don't feel wronged or insulted because of a cultural difference or misunderstanding.

Two men playing golf one day.  
One of them, terrible at golf, swung at the ball and missed completely.

""Damn!"" he said. ""Missed.""

""You shouldn't swear like that,"" said his friend, who was deeply religious, ""It offends God.""

The other golfer shrugged and ignored him, carried on playing.

Five minutes later, at the next hole, the bad golfer swung again and failed to hit the ball.  
""Damn! Missed.""

His friend's face turned red and he said ""I've told you already. Don't say that. It offends the Lord. And His punishment shall be swift and severe.""

""Sorry."" He wasn't sorry.

Later, on the next hole, the first golfer's game had still not improved. He sat the ball on the tee, messed around selecting the right club, took a long swing at the ball and succeeded only in throwing the club into the air. The ball sat there on the tee, unmoved.

""Damn!"" he shouted. ""Missed again.""

Suddenly, from a darkening cloud overhead, a lightning bolt leapt towards the earth. It struck right where the religious friend stood, killing him stone dead.

And as he lay on the ground, burnt to a crisp and smouldering gently, never to complain again, the clouds parted. The heavens opened. A brilliant light shone down from above, stronger even than the light from the Sun, and with a great rumbling in the heavens came a terrifying voice. The voice of God himself.

Tino Sanandaji is among the last people one would expect to argue that immigrants pose a threat to Sweden’s way of life. An economist at Stockholm’s renowned free-market think tank Research Institute of Industrial Economics, Sanandaji is a member of a Swedish elite that has long defended open borders. And his own life offers a clear example of an immigrant success story: Sanandaji arrived in Sweden from Iran in 1989, with his mother and younger brother, when he was nine years old. With financial assistance from the Swedish government, Sanandaji was able to attend the elite Stockholm School of Economics. From there he moved to the United States, where he earned a Ph.D. in public policy from the University of Chicago.

And yet Sanandaji now argues that Sweden should stop taking in people who share his background. “Immigration has meant that Sweden has imported a bunch of social and economic problems that to a degree didn’t exist before,” he tells me, sitting in a modern conference room at his office in the upscale Östermalm neighborhood of Stockholm. “For a number of reasons -- a long period of peace, a homogenous population -- Sweden has had a unique combination of welfare, growth, and equality. That idyll is to a certain degree over.”

Over the past several decades, a stream of people from countries such as Bosnia, Iraq, and Somalia have taken advantage of Sweden’s asylum policies, the most generous in Europe. As a result, this once homogenous Nordic country has been utterly reshaped. In 2000, 11 percent of Sweden’s population was foreign-born. Today, the proportion is closer to 17 percent, higher than any comparable country in Europe -- and higher also than the United States, where only 13 percent of the total population is foreign-born.

And far from slowing down, the trend is accelerating. In 2013, Sweden -- a country of 9.5 million -- received a total of 54,000 asylum requests, a 24 percent increase over 2012. In September, Sweden became the first European government to offer permanent residency -- a designation that extends to all immediate family members -- to any Syrian who manages to arrive in Sweden. Since then, Sweden has been taking in Syrians at a rate of more than 500 per week.

All this is happening against the backdrop of big economic challenges. Sweden’s open refugee policies were formulated in the 1970s, at a time when it was the fourth-richest country in the world and unemployment rates hovered just above zero. “Equality” and “solidarity” were the catchwords of the day. It was an easy time to be generous, in other words, to people fleeing dictatorships in countries such as Chile and Iran. But economic growth has been sluggish since the 2008 financial crisis and, even more worryingly, jobs have become scarce -- especially in the sorts of low-skilled sectors that newly arrived immigrants have traditionally flocked to. Unemployment is now stubbornly stuck above eight percent. Among foreign-born Swedes, the rate is twice as large.

Compared with many other Western countries, Sweden has weathered the financial crisis fairly well, and it is still a remarkably comfortable place to live. Sweden’s welfare state remains in place. Every resident of Sweden -- whether they were born there or not -- is entitled to free public health care, a year of parental leave paid by the government, mandatory sick-leave benefits, and free dental care until the age of 20. But the social contract that this system depended upon is beginning to fray, especially due to the scarcity of jobs. According to Lars Trägårdh, a historian who has written extensively on the Swedish welfare state, the hallmark of Swedish society has been a combination of very high social trust and a marked degree of individualism based on a duty to work. Sweden is becoming the clearest case study of a question being asked across Western Europe: Can a modern welfare state be reconciled with rapidly increasing diversity at a time of rapidly dwindling job prospects?

THE RISE OF THE RIGHT

There are many places to watch this unfolding Swedish drama, but a particularly good spot might be a balcony overlooking the center of the Stockholm suburb of Husby. One such balcony, on the top floor of a beige five-story apartment building, belongs to the Al-Khamisi family. The family fled Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in 1994, and arrived in Sweden after a long and dangerous journey, which ended with an arduous ride across the Baltic Sea on a small fishing boat with 60 other refugees.

What you see from the balcony is a fairly typical Stockholm suburb, and very much a physical manifestation of the Swedish welfare state, with all its faults and its merits. It was built in the early 1970s as a part of a massive state program to create a million new homes in a decade. In the beginning, the apartments were mainly filled with working-class Swedes, many of whom had recently arrived from other parts of Sweden. 

But over time, Husby has changed. Standing on the balcony today, you see well-kept but graceless four- or five-story housing blocks; a tidy park; a church; a supermarket where you can buy big sacks of basmati rice, jumbo pistachios, and phone cards; and people wearing hijabs and Afghani pakol hats. What you don’t see are many blond people -- a reflection of the fact that 85 percent of the 12,000 inhabitants of Husby were either born abroad or have two parents who were. That makes Husby the mirror image of central Stockholm. Together, they offer a portrait of Sweden’s segregation problem. Immigrants live in satellite cities, removed and out of sight. Until something happens.

A year ago last May, the Al-Khamisis’ balcony was also the perfect vantage point to watch the riots that shook Husby, making headlines around the world. “Right down there, cars were burning,” said the 25-year-old Rami Al-Khamisi, the second oldest of the family’s five sons, pointing to a road beneath the house. “That same street is the way the police came. And that pedestrian overpass, leading to the park -- that’s where the kids stood, throwing stones. My mother was terrified. She stood here screaming, ‘Baghdad! This is like Baghdad!’ ”

It wasn’t really like Baghdad. The riots were actually quite Swedish. When similar riots struck France, in 2005, some 10,000 cars burned. Several thousand people were arrested. In 2011, during riots in the United Kingdom, five people were killed and 2,000 people were convicted of criminal activity. In Sweden, on the other hand, fewer than 400 cars were torched. There were some minor injuries --mainly police officers hit by stones -- but no one was seriously hurt. No looting took place. Thus far, 19 people have been or are being investigated by public prosecutors, and four young men have been convicted for minor crimes. 

But despite the limited scale, what happened in Husby touched a raw nerve in Swedish society -- and soon became enmeshed in Sweden’s increasingly complicated politics over immigration. A little over a week after the riots, Jimmy Åkesson, the 34-year-old leader of the Sweden Democrats, a far-right, anti-immigrant party, delivered a speech in which he solemnly declared, “My friends, this won’t do.” Later uploaded to YouTube as “Straight Talk on the Husby Riots,” Åkesson’s speech squarely blamed Sweden’s immigration policies for the unrest: “A gigantic, social experiment has been forced upon the Swedish society. It is now clear that this experiment has failed. The vision, utopia, dream of a multicultural society has fallen apart.” ",0,1400578439,null,0,false,0,chmi738,t3_260a0q,t1_chmi738,t1_chmhmdg,null,1433875022,27,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,27

Until the mid-1990s, the Sweden Democrats were a party of militant skinheads in black uniforms. Its xenophobic message is unchanged, but today the group presents itself as Sweden’s only reliable guardian of the welfare state. A television ad released by the party for the 2010 elections depicts an ethnically Swedish retiree hobbling forward while a hoard of Muslim women in burqas greedily charge past to grab money from the national coffers. The choice, a voice-over explains, is to “cut money from immigration budgets, or from pensions.” 

This messaging plays into the worries of many Swedes that the welfare state is increasingly fragile. Over the past two decades, the size of Sweden’s welfare state has shrunk. Public spending has fallen from its peak of 67 percent of the GDP in 1993 to 52 percent today, as taxes have been cut quite drastically: as a percentage of the GDP, overall taxes have gone down from 51.4 percent in 2000 to 44.3 percent in 2012. Both services and benefits have been cut -- most notably unemployment benefits -- and big parts of the welfare sector have been opened to private, profit-making companies. In international economic circles, this has been hailed as a new “Nordic model” -- a lean but well-financed and still generous state. But for many Swedes, the cutbacks carry a clear sense of loss. And, increasingly, some Swedes seem inclined to blame immigrants for that feeling.

In the 2010 elections, the Sweden Democrats earned 5.7 percent of the vote, enough to enter parliament. Post-election surveys clearly showed that the party got most of its support from working-class male Swedes -- the group, apart from immigrants, hit hardest by the shrinking supply of low-skill jobs. Today, as the next general elections in September draw closer, most opinion polls show the Sweden Democrats at close to ten percent. A recent survey showed that about 30 percent of young male members of Landsorganisationen, Sweden’s largest trade union, support the party. Thus far, the government has carefully avoided dealing with the party, and no one expects this to change after the coming elections. But as the party grows, the lure of the policies that the Sweden Democrats espouse clearly grows with it. 

USING A MEGAPHONE

Rami Al-Khamisi is a fierce-looking young man, with close-cropped hair and a physique shaped by regular visits to the local gym. But he is no delinquent -- quite the opposite. He’s in his second year as a law student at Stockholm University, and in recent years, an organization he helped found, Megafonen (“The Megaphone”), has emerged as one of the most notable community organizations in Stockholm’s suburbs. Unlike the Swedes who think of immigrants as the cause of recent tensions rippling through Swedish society, Al-Khamisi blames the tax cuts, privatizations, and cutbacks to the welfare state.

As we walked through the neighborhood, Rami seemed to know pretty much everybody. Meeting some teenage boys hanging out in a doorway, Rami shook hands. “What’s up,” he said. “You on your way to school?” (It’s a question with an uncertain answer: In Husby, 19 percent of the 15-year-olds don’t have the grades to earn placement in high school.) As we reached a footbridge near his building, Rami pointed to a low-slung yellow building with peeling paint and darkened windows. Inside, you could see furniture strewn about, like someone had left in a hurry.

“This used to be the Yellow House, a place for kids to hang out,” Rami said, peering through the broken blinds. “It’s been closed for five, six years. There was another place as well, called the Barn, that closed ten years ago. They used to arrange all kinds of things. In the summer, we went out into the Stockholm archipelago, camping and stuff. In the winter, we went skiing in Fjällen -- the mountains up north. Now, there’s almost nothing.” 

“I think the politicians might understand that kids here need something to do,” Rami continued. “But they don’t live here, they don’t know our reality, so they don’t realize what it does to the neighborhood when they board up places like this. Most kids here don’t have their own rooms; they live six, seven people in a two- or three-bedroom apartment. So where do you hang out? At McDonald’s, feeling like a bum? You know what happens? They’ll start looking for some action.” 

Listening to Rami, it is easy to get a dark view of Sweden’s future. He sees -- as does the immigrant-turned-economist Sanandaji -- a whole generation of “lost kids” in areas like Husby, boys with an immigrant background who are at risk of never truly becoming part of society. But that’s not because they’re not integrated into Swedish culture. “Most of the kids who rioted were born here and speak no other language than Swedish,” he said. “So what exactly should we integrate into?”

What Rami sees instead is a generation that, lacking education and real jobs, feels excluded from the possibility of ever having a voice in Swedish society. “I’m sorry to say, but there are so many here that are already on the wrong path,” he said. “I don’t know what it’ll take for the politicians to realize that the segregation you see here -- it’s a problem for all people in Sweden. Because this is our country, too.” 

AN IMMIGRANT COUNTRY 

The politician in charge of trying to solve this peculiarly Swedish puzzle -- at least until the September elections -- is Erik Ullenhag, the integration minister. Since 2006, the Swedish government has been a center-right coalition under conservative Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt. But the 41-year-old Ullenhag is a member of the Liberal Party, and his politics on immigration don’t deviate from the Swedish establishment consensus that straddles both the left and the right and argues that the country’s open immigration policies should be kept in place. In 2010, after the Swedish Democrats earned a place in parliament, the Reinfeldt government made a point of agreeing to an immigration deal with the Green Party that guaranteed just that. 

“We deal with this differently than in most other European countries,” Ullenhag said. “It’s about showing political leadership. Instead of adjusting our policies to the Sweden Democrats, we stand up for being open and tolerant. We’re a small and rich country; we should take our share of responsibility in the world. And we think that if people who come here get jobs and become part of Swedish society, there is a lot of support for the idea that people should be able to continue coming to Sweden.” 

Ullenhag points to surveys showing that Swedes have become more positively inclined toward immigration in the past decade. And he insists that, in the medium term, there are clear economic benefits to immigration. “In 20 to 25 years, I think we will see a situation where this openness has been very good for Sweden,” Ullenhag said. “It’ll make us stronger in this globalized world.” 

But he admits that there are challenges -- above all, with education and jobs. “The big integration challenge is that too few of the recently arrived have jobs. And it’s true that a lot of the simpler jobs have disappeared from the labor market in the past few decades. But we think other sectors, like the service sector, can fill these gaps.” To that end, the government has put in place a number of reforms to ease entry to the job market -- Ullenhag points to tax subsidies to domestic services and a focus on vocational training in school. But so far, they don’t seem to have put a serious dent in the high unemployment numbers.

But economics aside, Ullenhag admits that Swedish society will have a problem as long as Swedish citizens don’t recognize that they need to alter their own sense of national identity. “Sweden is an immigrant country today, as much as the United States or Canada,” he said. “But have we gotten used to it yet? No, not really. This is still a country where many people who were born here identify themselves as immigrants. Which means you’re not really part of society. That’s the big challenge. We have to get better at coming together around a common future -- instead of focusing on where your mom and dad were born.”",0,1400578465,null,0,false,0,chmi781,t3_260a0q,t1_chmi781,t1_chmi738,null,1433875023,15,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,15

BUILDING THINGS

A glimpse of this Swedish future can be caught at Arlandagymnasiet, a high school in Märsta, half an hour north of Stockholm, which offers remedial Swedish classes for immigrant students. On a recent morning, Ayaan Hassan Ali, a 16-year-old recently arrived from Somalia, was sitting in a modern classroom, with blue chairs and bright wood paneling on the walls. In one corner, there was a large flat-screen TV, in another, a map of the world, and in the back, a couple of bookshelves filled with dictionaries: Swedish-Arabic, Swedish-Russian, and Swedish-Tigrinya among them.

Ayaan spends almost every afternoon studying at home so she can come to class well prepared. After two months in school, she says she still has a hard time speaking Swedish, but her reading and writing have improved considerably. “I want to be done with the language introduction by the end of this year,” she said. Her aim is to earn a middle-school diploma as quickly as possible, so that she will be able to begin high school and eventually study engineering at a university. It is an ambitious plan. “Some of them complete it in a year,” said Veronica Suskic, the headmaster in charge of the introductory program. “But very few.”

Ayaan’s main challenge might not be her own motivation but her fellow students -- and a school system under strain from the steady arrival of new immigrants. Ayaan is one of only two girls in her class of about 20. (It’s a number in constant flux, Ayaan’s teacher, Thomas Engqvist, said, since new kids come all the time, while others “move, get deported, some just disappear.”) Many of the boys arrive to Sweden as unaccompanied minors, most of them from Afghanistan. The others in the class are from Albania, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Somalia, and Tajikistan.

“It’s a difficult environment in which to teach,” Engqvist said. “The testosterone level is pretty high, and their level of education tends to vary a lot. And then we have the whole world in the class -- you get mini wars, conflicts that sometimes boil over.” The situation shows no sign of letting up. With a wry smile, Engqvist quoted a colleague who said that, “as long as there are wars in the world, we have a job.” And there are always wars, he pointed out -- “right now, in Syria.”

That day, the class spent several hours reading aloud a simple text over and over. After they had finished, the teacher turned to the class to test them on vocabulary. “Modig,” he asked, using the Swedish word for brave. “Does anyone know what modig means?” Silence. “Okay, it’s when you do something even though you’re afraid to do it. Does anyone have an example of being modig?”

“It’s like when a small guy picks a fight with a big guy,” one of the Afghan boys, 17-year-old Sadiq, said. Like most of the Afghanis in the class, Sadiq had arrived alone, after passing through some ten countries on the way. “Yes! But he has to be afraid,” the teacher said. “Otherwise he’s just stupid. Someone else?”

Ahmad, one of the Somali boys, tried telling a story about how he was fleeing his home in Somalia and crossed a river filled with crocodiles. But the gap between his halting Swedish vocabulary and the sheer horror he wished to express was too wide, and the teacher was unable to follow along. Instead, he asked, “Ayaan, is being modig something good?” Ayaan looked down into her book, thinking hard. “Yes,” she said in her deep voice, a voice that makes her seem older than she actually is. “For example, when you dare to do a test even when you’re afraid you will fail.” She paused. “Or when you speak up, even though you don’t want to.”

Later in the day, the class had a discussion about jobs. Sadiq, the 17-year-old Afghan boy, asked me if being a journalist was a good job. After being told that becoming a lawyer or studying economics would be better if we wanted to make money, he nodded absent-mindedly. “How about welding? Is that good?” It turned out that he’d been a welder since the age of five. He looked proud. “You’ll always have to build things, don’t you?”",0,1400578473,null,0,false,0,chmi79n,t3_260a0q,t1_chmi79n,t1_chmi781,null,1433875025,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

true,ssshane,BELG,Belgium,"Good point. It's a bit more mixed though.

But just two things to add here: one, the problem is that in this case the timing is different. the Dutch had their NN law back in 2012, as an implementation of the EU's 2009 Telecoms package. So if the EU's law proves to be more ambitious in the end, then the Dutch law will be de facto overridden.

Two, if we look at the content, or at least the EP position, I'd say this is already the case. The Dutch law is quite limited, and institutes a general prohibition on traffic management practices (plus the exceptions). The EU law also does this (in art 23.5) but goes much further and adds another prohibition on discrimination between functionally equivalent services (art 23.2). The center piece of the EU law is also the distinction between internet access services, and specialized services. There's no mention of that in the Dutch law.

So in short, the European Parliament's provisions are more extensive. If the EU were to pass these as law (which is unlikely), then in all the areas where the EU goes further, Dutch law will be superseded.

Second, 'Power', or democracy for a better term is man-made, it does not 'belong' anywhere. We decided as a people to give that power to our national government at one point, to regulate our lives.

So God, the merciful and forgiving, sees a bunch of loving people organize a demonstration and decides to punish everybody else with rain and flooding, instead of targeting those especific individuals disapointing him.

Le Canada, selon l'encyclopédie collaborative libre de l'Internet répondant au nom de Wikipédia, est une monarchie constitutionnelle fédérale à régime parlementaire d'Amérique du Nord, situé dans la partie septentrionale du continent. Le Canada est peuplé de 35 millions d'habitants.

&gt; 1. (C) Summary. Following a muted first reaction to Ukraine's intent to seek a NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP) at the Bucharest summit (ref A), Foreign Minister Lavrov and other senior officials have reiterated strong opposition, stressing that Russia would view further eastward expansion as a potential military threat. NATO enlargement, particularly to Ukraine, remains ""an emotional and neuralgic"" issue for Russia, but strategic policy considerations **also underlie strong opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia. In Ukraine, these include fears that the issue could potentially split the country in two, leading to violence or even, some claim, civil war, which would force Russia to decide whether to intervene.**

The only place where the EU has an added value is in open trade, freedom of movement and legislation of business practices. The rest it should stay out of at all cost. If not it is the time for the people to remove them from power.

[Hier](https://www.alternativefuer.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Europaprogramm-AfD-kurze-Fassung.pdf) ist das Europaprogramm der AfD. Darin findet sich ein klares Bekenntnis zu einem Europa der nationalstaatlichen Verantwortlichkeit bei Stärkung demokratischer Prinzipien und Bürgerbeteiligung. Des weiteren die Forderung nach einem Arbeitsrecht für Asylbewerber, Regelung der Einwanderung nach kanadischem Vorbild, etc. 
Du kannst es ja selbst nachlesen. 

Worin ich Dir und den anderen Kommentatoren recht gebe, ist der Punkt, daß die AfD auch rechte Schwachmaten anzieht, die meinen, es gebe einen unausgesprochenen Konsens in der Partei zu ausländerfeindliche Positionen u.ä. Von diesen Leuten gibt es m.E. in der Tat zu viele, und die Medien schenken ihnen auch zu viel Aufmerksamkeit. Dennoch sollte man zur Kenntnis nehmen, daß sich Lucke im Namen der Partei mehrmals öffentlich und sehr deutlich von ihnen distanziert hat, und diverse Parteiausschlüsse zeigen, daß sie nicht toleriert werden. Der Erfolg der Partei wird davon abhängen, ob sie über genug gemäßigtes Personal verfügt, welches sich auch längerfristig politisch engagieren kann und will. 

Auch wenn diese Forderung ja von einigen bereits als Verschwörungstheorie bezeichnet wird, bin ich daneben aber der Meinung, daß die deutschen Medienvertreter sich durchaus etwas zurückhalten könnten, wenn sie unbescholtene Bürger, die lediglich eine Euro-kritische (nicht europakritische) Partei gegründet haben, als Faschisten, Nazis, Ausländerhasser, Rechtsradikale, etc. bezeichnen.

Your Visa debit card will work fine in any ATM. Best check with your bank though and tell them you're going abroad, some banks automatically lock up your account when you unexpectedly use your card in a foreign country. Look up foreign withdrawal and currency exchange fees for your card as well.

From what I've read, more and more ATMs in Germany are starting to require ""chip-and-pin"" cards though, so if yours only has a magnetic strip but no chip you may have a harder time finding an ATM. Ask your bank if they can issue you a chip card.

true,OparinOcean001,null,null,"Ah ok, I didn't have a paywall. Here are some excerpts:

""Tino Sanandaji is among the last people one would expect to argue that immigrants pose a threat to Sweden’s way of life. An economist at Stockholm’s renowned free-market think tank Research Institute of Industrial Economics, Sanandaji is a member of a Swedish elite that has long defended open borders. And his own life offers a clear example of an immigrant success story: Sanandaji arrived in Sweden from Iran in 1989, with his mother and younger brother, when he was nine years old. With financial assistance from the Swedish government, Sanandaji was able to attend the elite Stockholm School of Economics. From there he moved to the United States, where he earned a Ph.D. in public policy from the University of Chicago.

And yet Sanandaji now argues that Sweden should stop taking in people who share his background. “Immigration has meant that Sweden has imported a bunch of social and economic problems that to a degree didn’t exist before,” he tells me, sitting in a modern conference room at his office in the upscale Östermalm neighborhood of Stockholm. “For a number of reasons -- a long period of peace, a homogenous population -- Sweden has had a unique combination of welfare, growth, and equality. That idyll is to a certain degree over.”

Over the past several decades, a stream of people from countries such as Bosnia, Iraq, and Somalia have taken advantage of Sweden’s asylum policies, the most generous in Europe. As a result, this once homogenous Nordic country has been utterly reshaped. In 2000, 11 percent of Sweden’s population was foreign-born. Today, the proportion is closer to 17 percent, higher than any comparable country in Europe -- and higher also than the United States, where only 13 percent of the total population is foreign-born.

And far from slowing down, the trend is accelerating. In 2013, Sweden -- a country of 9.5 million -- received a total of 54,000 asylum requests, a 24 percent increase over 2012. In September, Sweden became the first European government to offer permanent residency -- a designation that extends to all immediate family members -- to any Syrian who manages to arrive in Sweden. Since then, Sweden has been taking in Syrians at a rate of more than 500 per week.""

...

""Compared with many other Western countries, Sweden has weathered the financial crisis fairly well, and it is still a remarkably comfortable place to live. Sweden’s welfare state remains in place. Every resident of Sweden -- whether they were born there or not -- is entitled to free public health care, a year of parental leave paid by the government, mandatory sick-leave benefits, and free dental care until the age of 20. But the social contract that this system depended upon is beginning to fray, especially due to the scarcity of jobs. According to Lars Trägårdh, a historian who has written extensively on the Swedish welfare state, the hallmark of Swedish society has been a combination of very high social trust and a marked degree of individualism based on a duty to work. Sweden is becoming the clearest case study of a question being asked across Western Europe: Can a modern welfare state be reconciled with rapidly increasing diversity at a time of rapidly dwindling job prospects?""

Then it talks a bit about the rise of the far-right in Sweden:

""Until the mid-1990s, the Sweden Democrats were a party of militant skinheads in black uniforms. Its xenophobic message is unchanged, but today the group presents itself as Sweden’s only reliable guardian of the welfare state. A television ad released by the party for the 2010 elections depicts an ethnically Swedish retiree hobbling forward while a hoard of Muslim women in burqas greedily charge past to grab money from the national coffers. The choice, a voice-over explains, is to “cut money from immigration budgets, or from pensions.” 

This messaging plays into the worries of many Swedes that the welfare state is increasingly fragile. Over the past two decades, the size of Sweden’s welfare state has shrunk. Public spending has fallen from its peak of 67 percent of the GDP in 1993 to 52 percent today, as taxes have been cut quite drastically: as a percentage of the GDP, overall taxes have gone down from 51.4 percent in 2000 to 44.3 percent in 2012. Both services and benefits have been cut -- most notably unemployment benefits -- and big parts of the welfare sector have been opened to private, profit-making companies. In international economic circles, this has been hailed as a new “Nordic model” -- a lean but well-financed and still generous state. But for many Swedes, the cutbacks carry a clear sense of loss. And, increasingly, some Swedes seem inclined to blame immigrants for that feeling.

In the 2010 elections, the Sweden Democrats earned 5.7 percent of the vote, enough to enter parliament. Post-election surveys clearly showed that the party got most of its support from working-class male Swedes -- the group, apart from immigrants, hit hardest by the shrinking supply of low-skill jobs. Today, as the next general elections in September draw closer, most opinion polls show the Sweden Democrats at close to ten percent. A recent survey showed that about 30 percent of young male members of Landsorganisationen, Sweden’s largest trade union, support the party. Thus far, the government has carefully avoided dealing with the party, and no one expects this to change after the coming elections. But as the party grows, the lure of the policies that the Sweden Democrats espouse clearly grows with it.""

The plight of immigrants living in a country they don't feel integrated into:

""Listening to Rami, it is easy to get a dark view of Sweden’s future. He sees -- as does the immigrant-turned-economist Sanandaji -- a whole generation of “lost kids” in areas like Husby, boys with an immigrant background who are at risk of never truly becoming part of society. But that’s not because they’re not integrated into Swedish culture. “Most of the kids who rioted were born here and speak no other language than Swedish,” he said. “So what exactly should we integrate into?”""

And Swedish national identity with respect to immigration:

""But economics aside, Ullenhag admits that Swedish society will have a problem as long as Swedish citizens don’t recognize that they need to alter their own sense of national identity. “Sweden is an immigrant country today, as much as the United States or Canada,” he said. “But have we gotten used to it yet? No, not really. This is still a country where many people who were born here identify themselves as immigrants. Which means you’re not really part of society. That’s the big challenge. We have to get better at coming together around a common future -- instead of focusing on where your mom and dad were born.” """,0,1400582464,null,0,false,0,chmiv58,t3_260a0q,t1_chmiv58,t1_chmhvxq,null,1433875355,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

And then there is the fact that there are no clear guidelines for how to collect data for rapes. In some countries ""one rape"" is different from others. Exampel : In Sweden, if a husband rapes his wife every day for a year, that would enter into the stats as 365 rapes. In most countries it would count as one : one rapist, one victim. Same with gang rapes. Is it one rape, or several because of the number of rapists.

Canada is the kidnapping capital of the world for the same reason.

This is an overview of the current situation in our countries. I have been following numerous news and portals and I’ll try to keep it as concise as I can. I am not professional reporter or anything, so forgive me if the level of writing is not very high. I hope it’s understandable at least. By doing this, I am simply trying to raise awareness of what is happening to us, hoping that as much people as possible can help.

•	The flooding in Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia, started on Thursday. Our countries have been hit by worst floods in 120 years (probably ever!), after [cyclone named Tamara] (http://mojahercegovina.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/tamara-ciklon.jpg) dumped three-months worth of rain onto the region in just three days.  [Here] (http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BoDmCC0CMAEKC3L.jpg:large) is a map of flooded area. 
•	In only a few days around three months' worth of rain has fallen, so even the most prepared of countries would have been in trouble. So far emergency systems in Serbia and Croatia appear to have worked relatively well, but less so in Bosnia. [The Economist]  (http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2014/05/floods-balkans)
•	More than 100,000 homes, 230 schools, businesses, roads and railways were washed out by the flooding. Tens of thousands were evacuated across the three countries, 20,000 plus in Serbia alone, including entire towns in some instances. Around a million people are without drinking water in Bosnia alone.

•	First it hit Bosnia and Herzegovina, specifically central Bosnian towns of **Doboj** and **Maglaj**.  People say it was like a tsunami. In matter of hours, water level has risen up to 3 meters high. Tens of thousands have fled their homes, but many stayed.  Yesterday, the water level has already fallen, revealing devastated buildings and bodies on the streets. Official reports mention 20 people died only in the town of Doboj, but the death toll is expected to rise. (Unofficial reports from rescuers on the spots say number is much higher).  Doboj was isolated from the rest of the world for three days. It is still without electricity and some of its neighborhoods can only be reached by boat or helicopter. Also, problem is that animals have been brought by flood (namely, snakes and rodents) – bites have already been reported and instant medical care is a big issue at the moment. 
•	At the moment, water that is flowing into the Sava from the Vrbas, Bosna and Drina rivers hit  towns of Odzak, Orasje, Brcko, Samac and Bijeljina. 
•	After water level decreased, over 3000 landslides have appeared, literally swallowing homes. 
•	Worst of all, landmines buried during the war and not yet removed are in some instances being shifted with the landslides, adding to the dangers of people living in the areas as well as rescuers. 


•	At the same time, situation in **Serbia** reached critical point. Serbia ordered the evacuation of Obrenovac and 11 other towns along the raging Sava River. Situation is the worst in Serbia's agricultural and power plant hub, **Obrenovac**, some 30 kilometers southwest of the capital Belgrade, is the worst hit, with water levels reaching up to nearly 3,5  meters in the streets. Over 35 people have already been reported dead. Serbian PM refuses to talk about number of victims as long as rescue operation is in progress. There are numerous reports and devastating stories from people on the spot, who fled o who are still rescuing. 
•	Belgrade braced for a river surge that threatened to inundate Serbia's main power plant, Nikola Tesla, and cause major power cuts in the crisis-stricken country. Sava flood wave, expected to reach Belgrade Monday and peak by Wednesday, originated in the upper segment of the river, where town of Sabac is situated - which forms the border between Bosnia and Croatia. This is now THE point of defense for Serbia and they’ve been building and strengthening sandbag barriers for days now, as expecting the wave from Croatia and B&amp;amp;amp;H to come. 

•	In somewhat lesser extent floods have hit **Croatia**, specifically its eastern region – Slavonia. On Thursday, flood occurred due to heavy rain, in inner part of Slavonia, near town of Pozega, where small river named Orljava turned into a giant water-monster and swallowed few villages. Situation there is now under control; water has decreased and people are trying to make these areas suitable for living again. Luckily there were no human casualties, but material damage is huge. 

•	On Saturday, when all these waters from rivers of Bosna, Drina and Vrbas went downstream to Sava, eastern Slavonian towns and villages found themselves in trouble. Level of water in Sava riverbed grew rapidly, finally reaching the level 1,30 m higher  than ever recorded. Authorities as well as civilians organized themselves really fast and started to build sandbag barriers and reinforcing the river embankments. However, the length of the riverbank to be defended is very long – almost 200 kilometers (from Slavonski Brod to Serbian border) and lot of people is needed!

•	On Saturday, high water level of the river Sava broke through the embankments near Racinovci and Rajevo Selo in Croatia, flooding village of Gunja and Rajevo Selo. People have been evacuated so far, some 15 000 from this area - even though some individuals were really stubborn and refused to leave even until today. Situation is horrible – water level is so high that all you can see from these villages are rooftops of the houses. People, who are now safe and sound in many shelters in villages nearby, are in terrible state of mind since they’re aware they have lost everything. Many of them haven’t had any insurance on their households (same is in Bosnia and Serbia!) and they are being given psychological help. This is mostly agricultural area – people had farms, and even though many animals have been rescued, there are lot of dead animals too. Authorities warn there is great danger of diseases. Snakes and wild animals, fleeing away from food, are also the threat in these areas. 

•	Since water level is decreasing, but still in its extreme levels, and is expected to be so for a week or more, people are constantly working on embankments – reinforcing and monitoring, because there is still great danger of flooding. Situation is extreme for days now and embankments are very wet and constantly leaking. If the worst happens, and the water breaks through flood will spread on huge area, all over the valley next to river Sava and numerous towns and villages will be underwater. Brave people are constantly fighting on the spot and hereby I thank them.
•	Authorities say the economic impact of these floods will be huge, devastating the agricultural sector vital to both the Serbian and Bosnian economies. Therefore, dear fellow redditors, *any help* is much welcome and needed. These are confirmed Red Cross accounts:

You can have it automatically top up whenever balance is low, with a cap; I suggest enabling bono auto-renew and enabling auto-top-up with a limit of €20 per month that it will do automatically.

Then there's also the example of some of the last non military executions in Belgium. 2 Flemish mineworkers in Wallonia that were accused of robbing a woman who fell during the robbery hit her head and died. The investigation was lacking but hey they were Flemish. Their trial was given to them in French only in which the 2 were not adequate and they were executed shortly after only to have the real criminal confess 6 or so years later.

I don't believe the Flemish soldiers during WW1 had that much fun either.

The downvotes put the topic out of discussion. Part of being pro-EU is wanting to entertain dissenting viewpoints and argue against them. In this case, the article is about the EU's ability to promote democratic values in its neighbors and across the world, and this article claims that the EU is falling short in that respect. That argument is interesting, and whether or not you agree you should upvote it as a way of promoting discussion.

(I don't say this as a eurosceptic by the way, if anything I am in support of the European project but as a non-European I have less of a personal stake and more of a remote interest.

If we're talking about the same person, it was just a fine he received for making an offensive facebook post, and the reasons that the courts gave where really based more on technicalities; he didn't cite his source, so it was deemed intentional misinformation. It still seems pretty idiotic and repressive, but it's nowhere near as bad as implied.

&gt; I mean, in the USA you have that crazy southern baptist church but don't think their leaders are being arrested for voicing their bigoted opinion.

The Westboro Baptist Church (who aren't actually Baptist) are a small cult which makes a living off of being provocative and suing people who attack them. They're about 2 dozen random assholes who are completely irrelevant, not politicians, so they're not in any position to potentially enact any of their stupid ideas. I admit it's a double standard, but politicians probably should be held to a higher standard.

&gt; And how about the stuff where he says that a law was enacted where it is criminalized if you criticize immigration?

But it wasn't enacted. Every country in the world winds up with laws that are basically fascist, because in many countries just about any random crackpot can submit them.

C'est d’ailleurs ce qui a été annoncé par Clément Lefevre de chez Linux Mint: maintenant Mint va se baser sur les Ubuntu LTS au lieu des non-LTS, afin de garantir plus de sécurité et stabilité et de mise à jour des paquets.

Autre avantage d'une LTS: passage automatique d'une LTS vers une autre. C'est comme passer de XP à Seven sans passer par la case Vista (si l'on considère par exemple que XP et Seven sont des LTS et pas Vista). Si tu es sur une 11.04, tu doit passer par 11.10 avant d'arriver en 12.04 LTS, puis passer de 12.04 LTS vers 14.04 LTS. Ce n'est pas très cool d'attendre autant de mise à niveau avant d'utiliser sa machine ! (Après ce sont des cycles qui sont très bien adapté à certaines personnes tel que les développeurs qui souhaitent avoir accès aux dernières fonctionnalités, les tester etc.). Je ne peux que recommander une LTS et ça tombe bien puisque la nouvelle version qui viens de sortir est la 14.04 LTS.

Le salon de ce week-end est dédié à Ubuntu, mais tout les premiers samedi du mois nous organisons une install party au même endroit, et Mint rentrerai surement dans ce cadre.

From [James O'Brien's interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pyYoL9ngtE#t=14m50s)

&gt;**Nigel Farage:** ... I was asked if a group of Romanian men moved in next door to you would you be concerned.

&gt;**James O'Brien:** What if one group of german children did? What's the difference?

&gt;**Nigel Farage:** Well, the difference... and you know what the difference is.

&gt;**Nigel Farage:** (goes off the tangent talking about human trafficking, thankfully he gets called on it later by the host)

Of course this question (and Farage's answer) are totally about how self-evident is the difference between groups of men and groups of children living alone. Could you be even more disingenuous?

See, this is the same excuse you used last time we had this discussion: Farage is not a racist, he just words things poorly all the time. Ok, I think it's safe to say we have reached a point where that excuse doesn't fly anymore and you are either 1) completely deluded of what's obvious for everybody else or 2) a cynic that supports a racist.

When it comes to Czech and Slovak languages, they are similar enough to be called mutually intelligible (i.e. when you can communicate with a person using your language while another person uses his/hers). So in this case the difference is so small, that one does not need to put much of an effort in communicating. So just to sum up, there are three key points:

* Czech and Slovak languages are mutually intelligible
* It makes very little effort to speak the other language
* English is taught in every Czech school yet only fraction of people have enough of courage (and opportunity) to use it in practice

Where does the EU have power it should not have? 

Also, Herman van Rompuy was elected by the Member States so he derives his democratic legitimacy from there. In any case, he does not make any policy decisions so if anything he's a glorified mediator that does not need any 'direct democratic legitimacy'. When it comes to the Commission President, he should be directly elected through European elections, I would totally agree. The current set-up for these elections are a step in the right direction.

How exactly is the EU stopping member states though? If you want your country to leave the EU, get a majority for it in national elections. If you want a referendum, you can have that  too. No one is stopping you. If you want to disband the EU altogether, get a majority in the European Parliament.

&gt; The only place where the EU has an added value is in open trade, freedom of movement and legislation of business practices.

I agree - the single market should be the EU's main pillar. But it's hard in practice to delineate what those added value areas are, the reality is not that black and white. 

If you can see the added value of the EU, then by all means vote on parties that actually want to improve it, make it more democratic, and more accountable. The way I see it is we have a responsibility to govern ourselves on a regional level in many policy areas, and ignoring this for short term political gain is too easy. There's a lot of room for improvement, so we should not not throw the baby out with the bathwater.

true,rewboss,UKGB,Expat from UK,"First, just to clarify one thing: in German, ""schnaps"" is the catch-all term for spirits distilled from herbs, grain, fruit or vegetables.

Translating the German: ""Grassl's Gebirgs-Enzian is a traditional Bavarian speciality obtained from the root of the famous curative Alpine gentian"".

The gentian is a plant that grows in the Alps, which most people associate with brilliant blue flowers; this blue gentian is usually pictured on the bottle, but it is actually distilled from the root of the much less pretty yellow gentian. It is reputed to have various curative properties, and is supposed to be especially good for stomach ache. This is probably nonsense, of course, but southern Germans in particular like to finish a heavy meal with some kind of schnaps from bitter herbs to prevent indigestion and so on.

Grassl is based in the city of Berchtesgaden, in the extreme south-east of Germany, and is Germany's oldest gentian schnaps distillery; it can be traced as far back as 1602.

[This page on the official website](http://www.grassl.com/de/herstellung-im-tal/) details (in German) the process of making the spirit. At the bottom is a slideshow, showing:

1. fields of gentian (in the wild it's protected, so it has to be cultivated for use in schnaps)
2. the ""root press"" used to crush the chopped roots
3. the master distiller checking the quality of the mash
4. the mash
5. the master distiller
6. the scales used for weighing out the herbs added to the drink

If you're not used to it, most schnaps of this type smell quite unpleasant -- my wife refuses to drink any of it, on the grounds that it tastes like medicine (Germans will drink it on the excuse that it is actually ""medicinal""); the taste of Gebirgs-Enzian is described as ""aromatic and bitter"". In theory, the alcohol content (37.5% by volume) is such that it should still be perfectly drinkable, but if the seal is broken and the bottle is 50 years old, I might still err on the side of caution.",0,1400590111,null,0,false,0,chmknbl,t3_260vx5,t1_chmknbl,t3_260vx5,null,1433876179,9,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,9

Probably because certain immigrant groups are more prone to sexual assault than the natives. You mentioned Norway. Welp.

&gt;In a news report in 2010, a spokesperson for the Oslo Police Department stated that every case of assault rapes in Oslo in the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 was committed by a non-Western immigrant.[20] This picture has later been nuanced, as only perpetrators in the solved cases were counted, and 4 of the victims in the 16 unsolved cases described the perpetrator as being of Norwegian ethnicity.[21] The report shows that, of 131 individuals charged with the 152 rapes in which the perpetrator could be identified, 45.8% were of African, Middle Eastern or Asian origin while 54.2% were of Norwegian, other European or American origin. In the cases of ""assault rape"", i.e. rape aggravated by physical violence, a category that included 6 of the 152 cases and 5 of the 131 identified individuals, the 5 identified individuals were of African, Middle Eastern or Asian origin. In the cases of assault rape where the individual responsible was not identified and the police relied on the description provided by the victim, ""8 of the perpetrators were African / dark-skinned appearance, 4 were Western / light / Nordic and 4 had an Asian appearance"".

I'm sure we're easier to discard by using strawmen. And I do understand that other Europeans might be prejudiced by how idiotically isolationist the ""euroskeptic"" movements in other countries are. The rhetoric of UKIP makes me sick to my stomach. 

But the ability of the European Union to function democratically is miserable, pure and simple. Maybe the contrast is less significant for other European nations, but we are very proud and fond of our tradition of short distances between our leaders and our people. Until September 11th raised security demands, our Prime Minister used to take the bike to work, and we all take pride in this egalitarianism.

And in both our debates over membership, *the democratic deficiencies* were actually by far the most significant argument against - to a greater extent than sovereignty over national resources.

I mean, just the idea of the European Commission, an executive body that pretends it is a non-political technocratic body, is a highly anti-democratic fiction. Technocracy works in the civil service and other advisory bodies, not for executive power.

I'm no euroskeptic in the least; I'm for a European Federation. I just cannot accept that it should be built on a foundation so poorly engineered as this.

Our political freedom to employ a sane fiscal policy, the Keynesian policy opposite of the rest of the Eurozone's insane idea of ""austerity"" - really, neo-liberal ideology disguised as response to a crisis - kept our unemployment at 2% and made us the only country in Europe to maintain a positive purchasing power growth throughout the financial crisis.

true,putin_is_gay,null,null,"Ich bin auch für die säkulare Gesellschaft! Und ich möchte noch zwei Zitate aus dem Text ""Muss man Religiosität respektieren?"" von Jan Philipp Reemtsma anfügen: 

""Eine säkulare Gesellschaft zeichnet sich dadurch aus, dass Religion zwar im privaten wie im öffentlichen Raum gelebt werden kann, dass der öffentliche Raum aber durch keine Religion bestimmt wird. Auch wo Religion öffentlich stattfindet, ist sie Privatsache. In einer säkularen Gesellschaft findet Religion in der Öffentlichkeit statt, weil sie Privatsache ist, und weil in einer säkularen Gesellschaft – anders als in einer Theokratie – vielerlei private Ansichten in der Gestaltung des öffentlichen Raumes eine Rolle spielen können.""

""In einer säkularen Gesellschaft – nur darum geht es – ist der Zugang eines Bürgers zur Öffentlichkeit nur durch seinen Status als Bürger definiert und nicht dadurch, was er denkt. Damit kümmert sich eine säkulare Gesellschaft um genau das nicht, was einem religiösen Menschen – wenn er es ernst meint – das Wichtigste sein muss. Für einen religiösen Menschen ist – eigentlich – eine säkulare Gesellschaft eine Gesellschaft des Irrtums. Diese Ansicht teilt die Geistlichkeit Teherans mit der (orthodoxen) Geistlichkeit Jerusalems und der Geistlichkeit Roms.
Diese säkulare Gesellschaft zu bekämpfen ist ein klares Ziel islamistischer Gruppen überall in der Welt, sie in Israel zu bekämpfen Ziel eines Teils des dortigen politischen Spektrums, und sie weltweit zu bekämpfen war das erklärte Ziel des vor Kurzem verstorbenen Papstes Johanns Paul II. Ich sage nicht: sie zu bekämpfen ist das Ziel jedes religiös empfindenden Menschen, und es ist auch nicht Aufgabe eines nicht-religiösen Menschen, wie der Vortragende einer ist, zu definieren, was ernstliche Religiosität ist und was nicht.
Festgehalten werden muss aber doch, dass eine gewisse Spannung besteht zwischen einer Gesellschaft, zu deren Öffentlichkeitsverfassung gehört, dass es keinen privilegierten Zugang zur Wahrheit gibt, und Menschen, deren Leben von der Vorstellung erfüllt ist, es gebe dergleichen und sie seien im Besitze dieses Zugangs. Dass solche Leute die säkulare Verfasstheit einer Gesellschaft durchaus schätzen können, ja sich dafür kompromisslos einsetzen, erfolgt aus einer Einsicht, die zu ihrer Religiosität hinzutritt – es geht nicht aus ihr hervor.""

Konrad Adam spricht in dem Artikel durchaus einen wichtigen Punkt an. Wenn eine Mehrheit im Lande Leistungsempfänger ist, werden deren Interessen übermäßig stark berücksichtigt. Das ist doch in den Wahlprogrammen der SPD und CDU der letzten Jahrzehnte immer wieder abzulesen gewesen, indem sie den Rentnern große Zugeständnisse machten, die von der erwerbstätigen Bevölkerung und den kommenden Generationen bezahlt werden müssen. Der Grund liegt natürlich darin, daß die Rentner immer mehr werden in der alternden Republik und überproportional an Wahlen teilnehmen. Das Problem anzusprechen ist mehr als legitim. 

Die Forderung, das Wahlrecht an die Leistung zu knüpfen geht m.E. zu weit, aber stammt ja auch aus einer Zeit, in der Adam Publizist war und nicht Parteivertreter. Daß da für Gedankenspiele mehr Freiraum gilt, ist ein positives Chrarakteristikum unserer öffentlichen Meinungslandschaft. Davon ist im übrigen nichts im Parteiprogramm zu lesen, und m.W. hat sich auch Adam selbst davon bereits distanziert.

Da un lato è vero che la classe dirigente può agire per forgiare delle nuove generazioni ""migliori"", ma è altrettanto vero che, che ti piaccia o no, emerge dallo stesso popolo che dovrà poi amministrare, condividendone quindi i valori. 

E' il vecchio discorso del perché la gente vota(va) Berlusconi. Berlusconi è l'espressione perfetta di quello che ce l'ha fatta secondo i valori standard dell'italiano medio. Simpatico, guascone, imbroglioncello, donnaiolo, bugiardo, inaffidabile sono solo alcune delle qualità in cui moltissimi dei suoi elettori si riconoscevano o avrebbero voluto farlo. Da noi è troppo poco radicato il valore dell'etica o dell'onestà per far si che solo la sua candidatura sollevasse indignazione e scherno (come sarebbe probabilmente successo negli stati uniti, dove però sarebbe realisticamente finito in galera molto prima di potersi candidare). Da noi è ""eh vabbè ma ha rubacchiato un po', chi è che non lo fa?""

Quindi perché un politico arrivato in parlamento grazie a favori,  marchette e un'attitudine alla disonestà (valori indispensabili per emergere nella nostra classe politica) dovrebbe poi dedicarsi anima e cuore alla riforma della giustizia? Stesso discorso per l'educazione.

Il problema è quindi far si che il popolo sia abbastanza educato da poter selezionare veramente i migliori esponenti da porre al comando della nazione. Ma l'educazione passa per la classe dirigente attuale. E siamo al cane che si morde la coda.

O peggiori, o uguali. Non è una questione di scala di valori.

&gt; ma è altrettanto vero che, che ti piaccia o no, emerge dallo stesso popolo che dovrà poi amministrare, condividendone quindi i valori. 

Tu dici? io fra la classe dirigente italiana vedo pochissimi emersi dal 'popolo' e moltissimi, quasi tutti per la verità, provenienti dalla classe dirigente stessa: figli e parenti di vecchi politici, figli di imprenditori (tipicamente impegnati a loro volta in politica), eventualmente ragazzi con un retroterra anonimo ma cooptati fin da giovanissimi dalle strutture giovanili dei partiti e da questi plasmati (penso sopratutto agli ex-PCI e ex-MSI).

&gt; E' il vecchio discorso del perché la gente vota(va) Berlusconi. Berlusconi è l'espressione perfetta di quello che ce l'ha fatta secondo i valori standard dell'italiano medio.

Ma tu credi davvero che la gente voti Berlusconi perché è un simpatico guascone? io non mi capacito di come la gente si convinca di queste cose.

&gt; Quindi perché un politico arrivato in parlamento grazie a favori, marchette e un'attitudine alla disonestà (valori indispensabili per emergere nella nostra classe politica) dovrebbe poi dedicarsi anima e cuore alla riforma della giustizia? Stesso discorso per l'educazione.

Sono d'accordissimo ma quello che hai appena detto rafforza la mia posizione, non il contrario.

&gt; Il problema è quindi far si che il popolo sia abbastanza educato da poter selezionare veramente i migliori esponenti da porre al comando della nazione. Ma l'educazione passa per la classe dirigente attuale.

Either blindly follow all these laws - or realize that it is a lot of stupid shit, that people thousands of years ago believed in, but is not applicable today!

BTW, Jesus famously said “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfil them.""

So if you regard yourself as a Christian - In the words of Jesus -  All these laws still stand!

You may either choose to obey them all, you are free to do so - or you may choose ignore them all. - But you do not have the right to choose to obey some of them while disregarding others.

You either believe the bible or you do not!

Sarà anche comodo, ma è il punto di vista giusto per capire le cause (di una gran parte) dei problemi attuali.

Es wäre schön, wenn der säkulare Staat tatsächlich neutral gegenüber allen Religionen sein könnte; tatsächlich ist er es nur gegenüber denen, die mit ihm kompatibel sind. Dies ist beim Christentum, besonders beim Protestantismus, wohl eher der Fall als beim Islam. Auch dort gibt es Stimmen, die zum Ausdruck bringen, dass nur ein wahrer Moslem der sein könne, der die Wahl hat, aber sie sind nicht so deutlich zu hören wie diejenigen, die eher eine Theokratie vertreten. 

Das ist ja (für mich) der eigentliche Knackpunkt an der Diskussion: Kann es einen religiös neutralen Staat geben, oder ist diese religiöse Neutralität nicht selbst eine spezifische Form von (post-protestantischer) Religion?
