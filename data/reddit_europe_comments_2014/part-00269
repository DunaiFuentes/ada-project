Everyone of my former buddys from the University has a well paid job (Consulting, Insurance, IT, Enginieering). As far as I know, nobody cared much for their major (but of course if you want to go into IT you should be able to code). 

Basicly none of these friends need their mathematical knowledge (nobody in insurance cares about PDEs or groups etc).

However, one of my friends works at BMW and does numerical simulation for their cars. This is basicly as ""mathy"" as you can get. But obviously he needs the ability to code and understand numerical results. If you want to go into insurance, you will have to get an additional degree (""Aktuar"") but this is generally after graduating and paid for by your employer.


So my recomendation: Take a major you like (you are generally not hired because of your knowledge on Navier-Stokes equations, they take you because you survived math ;) ) and learn a programming language. Do something you are interested in (Stochastics, Numerics, Algebra, etc) and do not wory about money. We math guys are generally paid well. We are Jack-of-all-trades and Masters-of-one-tiny-bit-who-no-one-cares-about. :)   

Edit for shameless advertising: If you really want to go into engineering, perhaps your university offers masters like [this](http://www.ces.rwth-aachen.de/master/index_html/view?set_language=en).

The first real networks we had did not have access to internet, were basically big LANs within an apartment complex. This way, most of the people could play Diablo2, Quake2, or Starcraft via LAN - even if the game was pirated, direct connection via IP worked.
People realized that being in a network was cool, you could download a song on dial-up (took about 1 hour with a 14400dial up connection) and share it instantly with your neighbor. He would download another song and you would get that one from him.
The flats stated to link up with each other and created ""neighborhood networks"". Still no internet, we are now in about year 2 of dial-up being available in Romania.
ADSL made an appearance but it was too expensive for most people, so it all but vanished in leas than a year.
These networks had to be maintained by someone (keep the switch plugged in, repair the cable that someone from the 6th floor cut because it look bad hanging near his window, link the network with others, etc) so the local sys admin job was created. Since they were getting regular, small payments, they decided to bring the real internet and make more money. You could pay ""x"" for LAN, or ""x+y"" for Lan and Internet. Since the target customer was the kid on the next floor, the prices had to be reasonable.
More and more people started to get 2nd hand computers and needed software (windows, office) so they would pirate it. Yeah, its not nice, but back then, a licence for win95 was the equivalent of about 2 monthly salaries for a teacher. Or that of a policeman. So no one, and I mean it, no one cared that the software was pirated.
People loved the internet because you could download movies and watch them at home. You had software like DC++ that allowed you to download with 10MB/sec from others within your network. And when I say download, you can read pirate. I honestly think that there's not one person in Romania who used a computer at least once and never downloaded anything illegal.
By this time, there was at least 1 of these networks for every 50-100 people. The networks started to link with each other via optical cable and would promote their speed with slogans like ""100mbs within the city, 1mb outside"" or ""download a movie in minutes"". Just in my neighborhood we had about 5 of these firms.
Then the torrents got popular and the shit hit the fan. People switched from DC++ to torrents within months and the networks had to keep up. So they added more capacity and advertised better upload speeds and by this time most of the cities were connected via fiber so you could download almost anything with around 10MB/sec.
All in all, the switch from 56k to 100mbs took less than 2 years in the big cities. Extreme levels of piracy -literally, you didn't knew anyone who had a licence for anything back then - meant that the police did not care, they were pirating stuff as well.
tl;dr Romanians love movies, we needed a way to download them and fiber was the answer. Much cheaper than copper, no risk of the cables getting stolen.
OMG I just wrote a novel!
edit: Thanks for the gold :). Also, RIP my inbox.
BTW, I'm not saying software piracy is great. I own a lot of software now and I'm happy to pay for what I like because now I can afford it.
I'm just explaining how things got started here. And honestly, the companies never lost a penny because we got to download stuff for free. No one could afford to legally buy the content. There was never a choice between buying and pirating it. This is something most people in the west dont get - we were never like ""hey, I can buy this new game, but screw it, I'll just pirate it and keep the money"" - back then most of us did not have the money in the first place. In 2003 the GDP was 2.700$. That's the median income for the ENTIRE year. So less then 250$ per month. If you think with that income people had the option of spending 50$ to buy a game or 15$ to buy a DVD, you are dead wrong. People had more pressing matters that needed money, like food and bills.
Even now, the lowest income salary is at around 250$. Do you honestly think people who make so little are able to spend 150$ for Windows? Buying the software is simply not an option for them.
Also, to the people saying that this wouldn't work in US due to the huge size difference: who says you have to blanket the entire nation with fiber on day 1? I agree, that's impossible. You start with areas that have a high population density and then fan out to lower and lower population density zones.

Fiscal balances are a tricky subject that can be easily manipulated depending on where your camp lies, let me give you an example: If a corporation has its headquarters in Catalonia, and thus pays corporate taxes there, but has customers all over Spain (who are the ones who ultimately bear the cost of taxation) then can you really claim that such tax burden is felt by Catalans?

Another example, but this time on the expenditure side: Let's look at the AVE high speed rail between Madrid and Barcelona, what percentage of the expenditure of that project can be considered expenditure in Catalonia and what percentage can be considered an expenditure in the rest of Spain? Should we consider only the kms of rail that are built on Catalonian soil to be an expenditure in favour of the Catalans? I don't think we should, since a train that only went from Barcelona to the border with Aragón would be much less valuable than one that got all the way to Madrid.

In conclusion, I don't believe we can calculate things such as fiscal balances when we're talking about economies that are so integrated and that if Catalans want to argue for independence they should use more honest arguments, maybe about national identity, language or political system (like wanting a republic instead of a Monarchy).",0,1410540997,null,0,false,0,ckget8c,t3_2g50qq,t1_ckget8c,t1_ckg8i30,null,1427049543,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Not all Basque people are Basque speakers (in fact, in Basque there are different words to refer to Basque-born people and Basque-speaking Basque-born people). But, if they feel and relate to the Basque Country, that makes them Basque as well. Many are learning, and since the language is back in the public education system, the numbers are improving greatly, there aren't many examples within Europe of a language renewal as successful as Basque is being. 

Bilingualism is an essential part of today's Basque society and it certainly would still be after independence.

&gt;__Quebec French profanities__, known as ___sacres___ (singular: *sacre*; [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): *sacrer*, ""to consecrate""), are words and expressions related to [Catholicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism) and its [liturgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgy) which are used as strong [profanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanities) in [Quebec French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_French), the main language variety of [Canadian French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_French), and to a lesser degree in [Acadian French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadian_French) spoken in [Maritime Provinces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_Provinces) east of Quebec. *Sacres* are considered stronger than the foul expressions common to standard [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) which centre on sex and excrement (such as *merde*, ""[shit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shit)""). For other French-speakers *sacres* have no meaning at all.

true,rewboss,advanced,advanced,"""That is why I study there.""

German has a very handy word: ""deswegen"" means ""that is why"", from ""wegen"" = ""because of"" and the genitive of ""das"" = ""that"". ""Deswegen studiere ich dort.""

Other options are ""darum"" (the answer to ""warum?"") and ""deshalb"" (the answer to ""weshalb?""). The former has the prefix ""da(r)-"" which basically means ""the thing referred to previously"".

""That is how I get here.""  
""That is where he died.""

In these cases, the best option is to keep it simple, unless the assignment is specifically supposed to drill you in some aspect of grammar. In the first sentence, German has the word ""so"", which can mean ""in this manner"" or ""thus""; the ice-cream manufacturer Langnese commissioned a song to be composed for their advertising, called ""So schmeckt der Sommer"": the title literally translates as ""Thus tastes the summer"", but we no longer say that in English: ""This is how summer tastes"" would be a more contemporary translation.

Similarly, instead of saying ""That is where..."", you can say ""There..."": ""Dort starb er."" If you want to say ""This is where..."" simply say ""Hier..."": ""Hier starb er"", or: ""[Hier waren Deutschland und Europa geteilt](http://media05.myheimat.de/2010/08/04/1195444_preview.jpg?1286445600)"".

Sometimes you may need something more circumspect: ""An dieser Stelle..."" literally means ""At this/that place...""

true,metroxed,EUSK,Basque Country,"Some years ago a Basque president from the Basque Nationalist Party proposed making the Basque Country an ""associate state"", something like still being part of Spain but at the same time highly autonomous. Some people equated it with Puerto Rico in relation to the US. It was rejected both by the Spanish and by the Basque. For the Spanish, it was going ""too far"", for the Basque, it wasn't far enough; they didn't want half-measures. It cost him the reelection. 

Some Spanish political parties are now (amidst the Catalan independence crisis) advocating for moving towards full federalism. I don't know if it will work, but given that the autonomous communities model (now in crisis) only managed to last 40 years, I wouldn't be too hopeful. 

&gt;If all the Castillians (sp?) formed one state, and the Galicians, Catalans and Basques had their own, what would be the balance of the population?

The problem with this is that it leads to even deeper regionalist problems that are difficult to deal with, and that are ""dormant"" right now but could awake at any moment. What is ""Castile""? The original Castile was formed by Castile the Old and Castile the New, but now it is divided into several communities, some of them (like Cantabria and Rioja) have already expressed their unwillingness to become again part of Castile. The community of Castile and Leon includes the former Kingdom of Leon, and sice its conception in 1983 the Leonese people have been unsuccessfully pushing for their own community. This problem goes on and on. Not all Valencians identify as Catalans, and not all Navarrese identify as Basque. What do we do? How do we rearrange them?

&gt;I don't know, sometimes I think the EU would function much better as a collection of regions instead of nation states.

I agree, but this also leads to some problems that many people and governments do not want to deal with.

&gt;Oh, and it would be great if Spain could eliminate the monarchy (in my opinion).

Have you read financial news on the subject? Because much of what has been posted on /r/Europe has been false or extremely misleading. The European Commission was very much in favor of it. I am not sure if the EC would be promoting it if it would dismantle health and education systems and cause many Europeans to be staunchly anti-federalization. That would be rocket fuel for far right parties if the EU unilaterally dismantled European health and education systems (although even if it wanted to it couldn't because of the need to have it ratified). 

Here is a [statement](http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/blog/2014/March/Facts-Investor-State%20Dispute-Settlement-Safeguarding-Public-Interest-Protecting-Investors) by the US trade office on ISD clauses:

&gt;The United States wouldn’t negotiate away its right to regulate in the best interest of its citizens, and we don’t ask other countries to do so either.  Our investment rules preserve the right to regulate to protect public health and safety, the financial sector, the environment, and any other area where governments seek to regulate.  

It will essentially get a dispute out of national court systems into international arbitration (typically). It would extend protections for things like Russia's illegal nationalization of Yukos. If the foreign trade holders (and Russian ones) brought suit in Russia's national courts they would likely lose. 

Australia's free trade agreement with the US came into force in 2009. Since then, its health and education systems have continued on just fine. 

&gt;I'm not familiar with the case. If you are going to use it as your main support, could you give me a link?

[Here it is](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-28464002). Keep in mind, the UK has a very developed legal system. This case was not filed under a FTA or using an ISD clause. The agreement would extend some of these protections to companies that enter into agreements with other countries covered. Also the main benefit is, disputes will be handled by an international tribunal, not a national court system which could be biased. I would not exactly call it my main support, but only as an example that companies have protections already in most national courts, this would give a complaintant the option to file suit in an international tribunal instead of a national court.

Germany does not have a problem with it. It promised to ratify the Canadian deal, then when people began getting up in arms about the ISD clause in TTIP it held off. As I said above, they were not angry about the ISD in the Canadian deal, but Germany still changed its mind on ratifying it. 

&gt;According to TACD, USA shows the drafts to corporate advisors (that is, the biggest American companies). It's only private citizens who are left out.

The EU does this as well. They will consult with companies as to what issues they have doing business in the market they are negotiating with. Most governments (likely all) consult with companies to see what hurdles they face. I still think it is better than full blown lobbying efforts. Would a mandatory public comment period help counter your feelings on the negotiation method (although many countries have these as is)?

&gt;Even if it would concern us, we hardly even get outraged on stuff that directly affects us, not to mention stuff that might have something to do with us a decade down the road.

I am talking about the European Union negotiating a free trade agreement with Japan. [It is in the works](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/japan/) as we speak. Negotiations began roughly the same time as TTIP. My point is nobody cares that these negotiations are also behind closed doors or the fact an ISD clause is likely going to be included (almost all FTAs have them). I was pointing out that out of two negotiations, both beginning at the same time, and that are likely substantially the same, only one is being protested. They will both likely take roughly the same time to negotiate and the European Union is a party to both. It seems fairly clear that the reason only one is being protested is because it is with the US. Unless I am missing something.

I've asked that same question to some independentist friends (good friends, by the way) and they seem to understand the rules quite differently. For them, if the ""YES"" wins, that's final and Catalonia is independent, but if the ""NO"" wins, then it's only a temporary set back. Wait 5 years and start again. Clever, huh? We're both playing the same game but only one side has unlimited lives.

But of course, if asked if I prefer to celebrate a referendum *right now*, I'm inclined to say no. Why? Well, for the same reason the independentists are so eager to vote this year. Because we are in recession and, like it or not, the economic crisis is a key factor in the recent popularity of the separatist movement. And they know it. So if they want to vote when the circumstances favor their agenda, I propose to do it when the circumstances favor ours. I agree to celebrate a referendum, but let's do it in five years when the economy has recovered and everybody has a job. Deal? ;)

true,LupineChemist,null,null,"The big issue here is the constitutionality. 

First, I'm against it because it would hurt both the rest of Spain and Catalonia economically in a pretty obvious way as the two cities are VERY economically connected (A thousand seat AVE leaves every 20 minutes at rush hour plus it's the busiest EU plane route on top of that to give an idea). I'm also not a native Spaniard so my heart isn't all that into any side even though I do live in Madrid.

Now that my biases are on the table, here is the issue I have. Catalonia approved the constitution 40 years ago with around 90% in favor within Catalonia. That constitution very clearly states a unilateral independence is a no-go. Legally speaking, they had a binding vote on the issue already and independence lost by a huge margin as it was part of the constitutional referendum.

Now, I'd be against it, but would understand if there was a campaign to change the constitution to make a framework where a legal vote were acceptable. However the idea that a simple 50%+1 referendum can overturn a constitutional principle is just crazy. The whole point is that a constitution is much more difficult to change than just being slightly more popular in any given moment.

If Catalonia really wanted to go down that road, they would have to declare the entire Spanish constitution invalid in Catalonia (and see how popular THAT would be....not very). But as it stands they are just picking the parts they don't like and ignoring it and then every time the judiciary weighs in, it gets put into quotes like it's somehow not valid how a judge interprets the law. Seeing so many things about how ""courts"" are declaring the referendum ""illegal"", but that shouldn't matter. Well what the fuck is the point of having courts anyway if you just get to ignore them anyway.

The whole thing to me is an exercise in showing exactly how populism shouldn't behave in front of rational governments. And the whole fundamental question of what it means to be a constitutionally supreme government.

Note that the Scottish case is VERY different because UK has parliamentary sovereignty and lacks a constitution.

As far as the answer to your question:

It's probably viable as a state though it would be significantly worse off and though it would hurt both Spain and Catalonia, it would hurt Catalonia much more. Simply because of numbers, right now Catalan companies have access to a huge number of people across Spain as do companies based in the rest of Spain. Voluntarily shrinking that marked from 45 million to 9 million will so obviously hurt business it's crazy and people who are disagreeing have a very fundamental misunderstanding of how multinational business work.

While yes, it's easier thanks to the EU, there would still be separate legal systems and companies would be required to have lawyers in both Catalonia and Spain then to deal with the issue. Smaller companies won't be able to afford it so will just have to choose one side or the other. And it makes a very big deal when deciding under what legal system a contract will be signed. Just the new-ness will also discourage a lot of international business since companies would rather award big contracts under a system with established case law history rather than a wild card court system that nobody really knows how it will rule.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"The US safety standards for cars are higher, and it would likely be a tough sell to reduce them. That said, this does not have to make cars more expensive. Factories have to produce cars for different markets on different days because the standards are so different. With harmonized standards they could build them all and ship them where there is demand. 

The US has excluded financial services from the agreement until the EU makes changes it promised to make by 2012. The US harmonizing financial regulations with the EU would require it to remove many of the changes it made after the crisis. The EU has mostly been on board for making these changes, but the UK has been pushing back. This could be a good way to get the UK to agree to EU proposals. 

These are two examples of how the EU could benefit from US regulations. 

The inverse is true for the US. The EU is serious about its food, so that could change US practices. Even so, the EU does not have to remove its protections. The free trade agreement could simply streamline trading in food that meets EU standards. Despite what you're reading daily on /r/europe, FTA's dont harmonize all regulations between two countries. They might take aim at manufactured goods or something of that nature (see cars above, that is a main target). 

The other main benefit is what I mentioned above. If European or US medical regulatory agencies performed their own tests, they could be shared. These tests are absurdly expensive, and done after extensive testing already, so allowing regulatory agencies to share research seems like a no brainer. Note, this does not mean that US or EU regulatory standards would apply to each other, it would simply allow research to be shared. 

Here is an [excerpt made by the US Trade Office:](http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/blog/2014/March/Facts-Investor-State%20Dispute-Settlement-Safeguarding-Public-Interest-Protecting-Investors)

&gt;The United States wouldn’t negotiate away its right to regulate in the best interest of its citizens, and we don’t ask other countries to do so either.  Our investment rules preserve the right to regulate to protect public health and safety, the financial sector, the environment, and any other area where governments seek to regulate.  U.S. trade agreements do not require countries to lower their levels of regulation.  In fact, in our trade agreements, we require our partners to effectively enforce their environmental and labor laws and to take on new commitments to increase environmental and labor protections.

Australia's Free trade agreement with the US came into effect in 2009. The EU is in a much better bargaining position given its size, but Australia's heath, education, environmental, etc. regulations are still in tact and doing just fine.

---

&gt;

&gt;American deliveries to the Soviet Union can be divided into the following phases:

&gt;


&gt;* ""pre Lend-lease"" 22 June 1941 to 30 September 1941 (paid for in [gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold) and other minerals)

&gt;* first protocol period from 1 October 1941 to 30 June 1942 (signed 1 October 1941), these supplies were to be manufactured and delivered by the UK with US credit financing.

&gt;* second protocol period from 1 July 1942 to 30 June 1943 (signed 6 October 1942)

&gt;* third protocol period from 1 July 1943 to 30 June 1944 (signed 19 October 1943)

&gt;* fourth protocol period from 1 July 1944, (signed 17 April 1945), formally ended 12 May 1945 but deliveries continued for the duration of the war with Japan (which the Soviet Union entered on the 8 August 1945) under the ""Milepost"" agreement until 2 September 1945 when Japan capitulated. On 20 September 1945 all Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union was terminated.

&gt;Delivery was via the [Arctic Convoys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_convoys_of_World_War_II), the [Persian Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Corridor), and the [Pacific Route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_route_(Lend-Lease\)).

&gt;The Arctic route was the shortest and most direct route for lend-lease aid to the USSR, though it was also the most dangerous. Some 3,964,000 [tons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_ton) of goods were shipped by the Arctic route; 7% was lost, while 93% arrived safely.  This constituted some 23% of the total aid to the USSR during the war.

&gt;The Persian Corridor was the longest route, and was not fully operational until mid-1942. Thereafter it saw the passage of 4,160,000 tons of goods, 27% of the total. 

&gt;The Pacific Route opened in August 1941, but was affected by the [start of hostilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Malaya) between Japan and the US; after December 1941, only Soviet ships could be used, and, as Japan and the USSR observed a strict neutrality towards each other, only non-military goods could be transported.  Nevertheless, some 8,244,000 tons of goods went by this route, 50% of the total. 

&gt;In total, the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America) deliveries through Lend-Lease amounted to $11 [billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,000,000,000_(number\)) in materials: over 400,000 [jeeps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep) and trucks; 12,000 [armored vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_vehicle) (including 7,000 tanks, about 1,386  of which were [M3 Lees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3_Lee) and 4,102 [M4 Shermans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lend-Lease_Sherman_tanks));  11,400 aircraft (4,719 of which were [Bell P-39 Airacobras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_P-39_Airacobra))  and 1.75 million tons of food. 

&gt;Roughly 17.5 million tons of military equipment, vehicles, industrial supplies, and food were shipped from the Western Hemisphere to the USSR, 94% coming from the US. For comparison, a total of 22 million tons landed in Europe to supply American forces from January 1942 to May 1945. It has been estimated that American deliveries to the USSR through the Persian Corridor alone were sufficient, by US Army standards, to maintain sixty combat divisions in the line.

One of their highest-ranking members took her daughter out of school at 11, and later entered her into an (arranged? not sure) marriage at 16.

Another congratulated AFA on their ""birthday"".

The leader tweeted positively about an article talking about how it's natural, harmless and actually positive to hate men.

At a conference a few years ago three members sang a song about how awful men are and how they should be killed. They were, of course, cheered.

On a more hypocritical note, they want to use affirmative action in all public and large private organizations (sometimes defined as **at least** 50% women). Meanwhile, their top leadership are 3 women, and their board/council/don't-know-the-right-term is composed of 93% women (14/15).

 [**Big Five personality traits**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big%20Five%20personality%20traits): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;In [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology), the __Big Five personality traits__ are five broad domains or dimensions of [personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology) that are used to describe human personality. The theory based on the Big Five factors is called the __five-factor model__ (FFM).  The five factors are [openness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience), [conscientiousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness), [extraversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion), [agreeableness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness), and [neuroticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism). Acronyms commonly used to refer to the five traits collectively are OCEAN, NEOAC, or CANOE. Beneath each global factor, a cluster of correlated and more specific primary factors are found; for example, extraversion includes such related qualities as gregariousness, assertiveness, excitement seeking, warmth, activity, and positive emotions.

&gt;The sizable traffic safety lead enjoyed by the USA since the 1960s had narrowed significantly by 2002, with the US improvement percentages lagging in 16th place behind those of Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland in terms of deaths per thousand vehicles, while in terms of deaths per 100 million vehicle miles travelled, the USA had dropped from first place to tenth place.



&gt;Research on the trends in use of heavy vehicles indicate that a significant difference between the U.S. and other countries is the relatively high prevalence of pickup trucks and SUVs in the U.S. A 2003 study by the U.S. Transportation Research Board found that SUVs and pickup trucks are significantly less safe than passenger cars, that imported-brand vehicles tend to be safer than American-brand vehicles, and that the size and weight of a vehicle has a significantly smaller effect on safety than the quality of the vehicle's engineering.

In the US there are places that would not be able to function at all without federal money (like Louisiana and Mississippi), though every state does get a lot of federal money.  But the flow automatically adjusts by need.

Of course the funniest part is that the most conservative states which are always railing against federal spending are by far the biggest recipient of that money.

This is a long boring read, but it kind of explains it:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_of_federal_assistance_in_the_United_States

Selon l'émission, tout n'est pas déjà écrit, et même si ça l'était, ça prend quand même un minimum de temps, qu'on devra payer à quelqu'un, il faut donc le rentabiliser ou le faire rentrer dans les quotas de programmes accessibles aux sourds et malentendants. Dans le cas de C+, vu qu'ils diffusent déjà énormément de films avec des sous-titres je pense qu'ils dépassent allègrement le quota (qui doit être de 30%, si je me rappelle bien) ils ne se feront donc peut-être pas chier à diffuser les émissions avec STSM.

&gt;Moreover, democracy and the democratic process doesn't save anyone from having to comply with policies that they don't agree with. It only guarantees that you have the right to participate in the process and to be heard, but once the votes are counted, the outcome is to be applied to everyone, whether they've voted for or against it.

Yes? What does that have to do with anything?

No, because none of it is a contradiction of what I have said and what I have said is not self-contradictory. Furthermore it is not a paradox. You people have just made the assertion that it was without actually giving any actual argument (which isn't complete bullshit).

You don't seem to get what I said - Scotland is vastly outnumbered by London alone in both houses, meaning that they are dominated by a particular segment of British society. In a European model that strives to split up the large nations in the EU into smaller nations Scotland will comparatively speak - with negotiation - get more influence compared to being dominated by England.

Es kann nur sinngemäß ungefähr so wiedergegeben werden: ‹werde ja nicht frech zu mir, du Dreckskerl, du windiger. Im Vergleich zu dir bin ich noch lange kein Sautreiber, elender Dreckskerl, nackter Hund!, plärrte der Anderl›.
&gt; 
&gt; Als Schimpfwort hat *Gribbl* eine geradezu natürliche Affinität zu steigernden Zusammensetzungen.  Sehr gebräuchlich sind beispielsweise *Saugrippl*, *Mistgrippl* und *Hundsgrippl*.  Die Jugenderinnerungen des weit über Bayern hinaus bekannten Kabarettisten Gerhard Polt (…) lautet «Hundskrüppel: Lehrjahre eines Übeltäters».
&gt; 
&gt; Das Wort kann aber – wie noch viele andere Schimpfwörter im Bairischen – auch anerkennend gemeint sein.  *Bist fei scho a Grippl* kann durchaus als Kompliment gemeint sein und bedeuten ‹du bist wirklich enorm schlau›.  Es schwingt aber auch die Bedeutungskomponente ‹trickreich, gerissen› mit.

&gt;*""There have been calls for public submissions and comments on the TTIP from the very beginning, anyone is free to make one.""*

There you are misframing the factual situation. 

The European Commission had what they called a ""consultation"" on the TTIP which received by many accounts 150,000 responses, but the European Commissioner 

1.) tried to trivialize many who joined that response by [saying that their use of an online outline of what the issues were disqualified them](http://www.ttip2014.eu/blog-detail/blog/consultation%20ISDS%20discount.html).

Additionally,

2.) a recent analysis of the CETA - well, you should [read the news story](http://www.euractiv.com/sections/science-policymaking/eu-canada-trade-deal-leak-ridicules-ttip-consultation-307797). Basically, it appears that the ""consultation"" was quite possibly a sham as it occurred after the disputed text had been finalized enough to insert it into CETA unmodified..

So, the ""consult"" appears to perhaps have been just for show. 

It should be mentioned that a similar series of events occurred in 2009 in the US, shortly after Obama's election. What was framed as a ""debate"" in the US over ""healthcare reform""  was really a faked, stage managed series of events, for show only as shown by the fact that doctors who tried to bring up the country's need for single payer were arrested, and the constraints which the US trade negotiators placed on the states and national policy space, hidden. (and still are hidden in the US!)

Jeff, previously, were you talking about this new leak? (of the entire CETA text)

Poi credo che dovreste mettervi d'accordo su una cosa. Scegline una:

- o c'è una cupola del pd che pilota le conversazioni (e tutti sappiamo che è una stronzata, e TUTTI sappiamo che è una paranoia assurda), e allora non puoi aspettarti che quando ti lamenti di questa invenzione 24/7 la gente non si rompa i coglioni e ti downvoti.

- o ti rassegni al fatto che c'è un sentiment su italy, dovuto al fatto che l'area demografica e culturale è omogenea (siamo di media sui 25-30 anni, con un titolo di studio e una formazione culturale di un certo tipo), e quindi c'è una normale maggioranza che si esprime a favore di certe posizioni.

The king and the Court were in Barcelona, spoke Catalan, keep the arms of Barcelona counts... The kingdoms were separated (Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia and Mallorca), each with its own courts and laws. All independent, but sharing the head of state. And even if you consider it a single independent country, you must identify it with current Catalonia.

Around 1475 the crown of Aragon got together with that of Castille. But, again, each had its laws and courts. This time, the main capital was in Castille.

In 1714 Spanish and French troops conquered Catalonia, and its laws and courts were suppresed. That's when Catalonia ceased to be an independent state.

It would not force the EU to adopt American standards though, mearly recognize the fact that both are ""safe"". For example, after X year, all new cars in the US have to have rear view cameras and (possibly) backup sensors (cant remember if that was passed too). 

EU manufacturers would not have to install these to meet EU requirements, but they could sell cars in the US that meet the agreed upon structural standards.

&gt;If they are so good then wouldn't it behoove the negotiators to hold the negotiations in public and if they are bad shouldn't we know about it, as they will affect all those in Europe and America?

That is a fair point, and in a perfect world that would work. But in the interest of having productive negotiations without outside interference they are done this way. Maybe there can be changes to the laws to allow negotiations to take place in a new way without outside interference, but make them public, but as of now, that is not how it works. I do think little would get done if they were public though. Say all the negotiations were broadcast, but the negotiators started with investment regulation. The public would be screaming about negotiating protections for healhtcare, education, etc. off the bat.

Others would want what they cared about discussed first, not realizing these things take years. I dont think any FTA would be all that popular, but maybe I'm wrong.

[EU-Canada trade deal leak ‘ridicules’ TTIP consultation, campaigners say](http://www.euractiv.com/sections/science-policymaking/eu-canada-trade-deal-leak-ridicules-ttip-consultation-307797)

""The leaked text of an EU-Canada free trade deal confirms fears that multinationals may sue EU states in special tribunals for enacting laws that upset their profit forecasts, and now campaigners question the public consultation on a free trade deal with the US.

The leaked EU-Canada Trade Agreement (CETA), signed last November and due to be unveiled on 25 September, contains a controversial chapter on Investor-State Disputes Settlement (ISDS) that is substantially unchanged from previous drafts.

These were used by the EU in March to get stakeholder responses to negotiations for a similar TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the US. At the time, the Commission said that it would seriously consider all 150,000 responses.

***But the use of the draft’s unamended wording in the final CETA treaty - before the results of the public consultation have even been analysed - show that it was little more than a PR stunt, according to Kenneth Haar, a spokesman for Corporate Europe Observatory.*** 

*“The Commission is not really serious about its own consultation,” he told EurActiv. “It's more about image than substance. Though they [CETA and TTIP] are two separate agreements, I think those who chose to respond to the Commission's consultation are being ridiculed.”*

The ISDS chapter was “an outright danger to democracy” he argued, because it enabled a mechanism to block attempts by national governments to legislate in the public interest.  

US officials routinely play down the likelihood of companies actually bringing ISDS-based lawsuits - or winning substantial damages if they do - while Commission officials stress the advantages a TTIP deal could offer to European businesses, whose lobbies have pressed hard for it. 

Looking after the investors

Speaking at the European Policy Centre in June, Rupert Schlegelmilch, the services and investment director at the Commission's trade directorate, argued that an ISDS chapter was needed because legislation designed to protect foreign investors in not always embedded in national statute.

""Because today's world is so integrated, in order for governments to support the competitiveness of their companies and protect their investors, it is necessary for them to look after their investors' international agenda,"" he said.

But TTIP-sceptics point to a raft of cases like the $250-million (€191-million) lawsuit launched by the US oil and gas firm Lone Pine Resources challenging a shale drilling moratorium in Quebec under similar Chapter 11 provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Lone Pine argues that the shale ban was “arbitrary, capricious and illegal,” as it had invested millions of dollars in obtaining permits to drill in Quebec before it was announced.

Such cases have darkened prospects for a TTIP agreement, with reports that Germany is restive over ISDS, and the incoming EU president, Jean Claude-Juncker, revealing that he too is uneasy about its implications.

Juncker speaks out on TTIP

“I don’t understand why great democracies would not have faith in the judiciary,” Juncker told Green MEPs. “We have courts which are able to deal with cases that are brought to them, and so I’m not really in favour of what one could call ‘private courts’ or arbitration bodies which may sometimes reach good decisions but don’t always have to justify their decisions.”

Lawmakers in the new European Parliament may also throw chairs in the way of any agreement, while the European ombudsman has opened two investigations into a lack of transparency in the EU’s conduct of the talks.

Canadian media reports anticipate a change to the current ISDS text to reflect European concerns, as the treaty completes a two-year slog through the EU institutions before gaining approval.

“The clause on investor-state dispute settlement is by now completely obsolete,” said Jos Dings, the director of the Brussels-based environmental think tank Transport and Environment. “People all over Europe have woken up to how this will make them have to pay for litigation by foreign investors.”

“The only right thing to do is to take the clause out of CETA,” he told EurActiv. “It is an excellent opportunity for Juncker to match his fine words on this issue with action.”",0,1410550762,null,0,false,0,ckgjzov,t3_2g83ex,t1_ckgjzov,t3_2g83ex,null,1427046378,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

I don't have any specifics, but there are a lot of possible reasons. 

- Different regulations: you can't just build a car and sell it everywhere, if a car has the same name in two different places, it might still be different in a thousand little details. Even if it's the same car, it might need an independant approval process.
- They are owned by Renault. They take care that similar, cheaper products don't cannibalize their more expensive ones which already sell well.
- People have different budgets and perception of value. Someone might prefere a ""cheap"" car with a little glitter to a ""good"" car with no extras for the same price *(with cheap and good I mean quality)*, but the price range is not the same as elsewhere. So you pimp out a Dacia instead of trying to sell the quality brand like you would elsewhere.
- People buy different types of cars, eg there might by a larger market for pickups in Brazil.
- People buy different brands. In the US, what are effectively the same cars are sold as different brands in different regions, because people. This happends in the EU too now, but it's not so extreme yet.

All these combined result in ""weird"" reasons that aren't easy to point at in every specific case. That pickup might sell in europe too, but if you can't just sell them without investment, and if sales would probably be low because the niche is much smaller, or certain functions are already much more associated with other brands, why bother?

The answer to your leading question is that nobody would ever admit it in so many words, but success has and will always be driven more by who you know than what you know. We are social animals. The current Congress (and the British parliament, for that matter) are certainly no angels here.

My cause is to encourage people to question the simplified and mythologised version of history that we grow up with. Every country is guilty of this. It's just that American culture is more widespread, and Americans are more strident in their patriotism, so you tend to see it more often.

But if I'm honest, as an English person it does irk slightly that so many people are so inordinately proud of their ancestors for starting a war against my ancestors over basically nothing at all. Parliament voted to give the colonies everything they'd asked for, and removed all taxes, and yet we still had a war. A lot of people died, and neither country particularly benefited from it.

I can't figure it out. Were the rebels already too far in, and afraid of being arrested for treason? Were they so determined to spread further west and kick out the natives, which England wanted to protect? Were they goaded into continuing the fight by the French, who were still weakened after the seven years war, and delighted to be able to give the English a good kicking via someone else's army? England was weakened as well, by the way. That notorious extra tax was levied specifically to pay for the English navy to continue to protect the colonies.

Because I've read the Declaration of Independence, and I think it's a beautiful, even exquisite expression of the human soul, written by a man widely regarded as one of the most intelligent of his time. And yet, in the relationship between the colonies and England, the accusations don't match the facts on the ground. There was no tyranny, unless you were black, and the revolution didn't help them at all. They didn't become ""whole"" people until a century later, and were still segregated for another century after that. 

People were not brutalised and starving in the streets, like they were in Paris or Russia before their revolutions. We know there was no great injustice, because there was no real change in the law afterwards. The Bill of Rights looks very much like the Massachusetts BoR from around 1640, which itself was based on English statutes and common law going back to the 13th century and before. Elections are the same, using the same First Past The Post system as England. Congress is bicameral, just like Parliament. They even kept the ""speech from the throne"", in the form of a regular State of the Union address.

I can't make sense of the official story, so I have to conclude (for now) that there was some private agenda at work, some vested interests at stake, which made the whole enterprise extremely desirable and profitable for someone. That's my spin.",0,1410551702,null,0,false,0,ckgkiap,t3_2g5bn5,t1_ckgkiap,t1_ckgb9mp,null,1427046034,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

There were other attempts that were crushed by force - the Anarchist revolutions in Catalonia that succeeded but were eventually stomped out by Franco and the Russian-Backed Stalinists during the  Civil War, the Paris Commune, which was stamped out by French Army, there was the 1918 Left-Communist Revolution in Germany which was militarily crushed and ended in the creation of the Weimar Republic, there were various cases all across Latin America and Africa where regimes that were what we consider today to be Liberal Democracies, but which were sympathetic to Communism, were overthrown in military coups... 

It's not that Socialists or Marxists haven't tried anything, it's that when they did - particularly during the Cold War - pretty much everyone tried to kill them. Those that survived did so specifically because they were authoritarian regimes that suppress all dissent and therefore maintained a secure grip on power. The theory's sound, it just requires that some dickhead doesn't come in and knock over the sandcastle.

If instead you are more into IT jobs and don't mind a French-only highly-priced daily life, there are good English-speaking job offers in the areas of Nice and Sophia-Antipolis.

true,misterbrisby,null,null,"**""So weit die Füße tragen"" (1959)** - About a German POW, who escapes from his prison camp in Siberia, trying to get back home to Germany via Mongolia and Iran.

**""Der Stern von Afrika"" (1957)** - About German fighter ace Hans-Joachim Marseille, who flew in North Africa and had 158 victories.

**""Der Adler ist gelandet"" / ""The Eagle has landed"" (1976)** (not a German production) - A German commando of paratroopers lands in England, disguised as British soldiers. Their mission: Kidnap Winston Churchill and bring him to Germany!

**""Des Teufels General"" (1955)** - Based on a famous play. It's about a group of German officers spending some time talking about different things. As time passes, some of them turn out to be very critical of the Nazi regime. The main character is General Harras (played by Curd Jürgens!) who makes fun of the SS all the time and obviously doesn't think much of Hitler. Things start heating up...

**""Der Unhold"" / ""The Ogre"" (1996)** - Okay, not about German soldiers, but still great: It's a drama with John Malkovich, playing a French POW named Abel, imprisoned in Germany, who shows a certain talent that makes him valuable for the Nazis. - He's good at kidnapping children and taking them to a castle where they become part of the Hitler Youth. The movie doesn't want to be realistic, it's almost like a dark, bizarre fairy tale.

Ti riporto un estratto di un mio precedente [commento di un altro thread](
http://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/1u8d9j/frazioni_dellexport_italiano_per_settore/cegb9ad)

&gt;Nella categoria **Aircraft, spacecraft &amp; launch vehicles** l'Italia non fa la parte del leone a livello mondiale (1,7% dell'export mondiale), ma $ 2.0 B significa una grossa fetta dell'export nazionale (0,48% di tutto l'export italiano).

&gt;Al contrario la categoria **armi da fuoco e simili dispositivi**, corrisponde ad una piccola fetta dell'export nazionale (0,058%), eppure questa la rende la principale esportatrice di armi da fuoco nel mondo.

Detto in modo più chiaro:
----

siamo i primi esportatori di armi da fuoco, ma a livello mondiale quello è mercato molto piccolo in termini economici, tanto che solo lo 0,058% dell'export italiano è dato dalla armi da fuoco. **Sì, siamo i primi esportatori di armi da fuoco, ma nel mercato della guerra è come vincere la coppa del nonno** perché è un mercato molto piccolo, che anche a livello nazionale non ha un grosso impatto.

Diverso è il caso di altre categorie di armi (es.: **elicotteri, arei e altra roba cicciona**). Lì il giro d'affari mondiale è davvero grande, e anche se **abbiamo una piccola fetta** di quel giro d'affari (solo l'1,7%) **è comunque una bella fetta**. Tanto che corrisponde allo 0,48%  dell'export italiano.

^^^Rileggendo ^^^questi ^^^miei ^^^dati ^^^potrei ^^^avere ^^^interpretato ^^^male ^^^la ^^^categoria ^^^*Aircraft,* ^^^*spacecraft* ^^^&amp; ^^^*launch* ^^^*vehicles*, ^^^ma ^^^forse ^^^anche ^^^no.

I think that Catalonia would be quite viable as an independent state. The breakaway Soviet republics had far less going for them and have made a go of it. Catalonia is prosperous economically and has an ideal geographical setting. It is absurd to worry about military threats once independence is established since most of its neighbors have aging populations who seldom engage in military aggression. France wouldn't tolerate proximate outright  aggression for a very long. 

The well known economist and Euro blogger, Edward Hugh, has been living in Barcelona since 1990, so I think his ideas are worth noting.

&gt; Following the bursting of the property bubble, the Catalan industrial fabric is perhaps the strongest single component of the Spanish economy, and in addition we have an important tourist sector. Barcelona also has a worldwide reputation as a prestigious center of creativity and innovation. One example of our potential can be seen in biotechnology, something that is particularly feasible in Catalonia because we have three manufacturing sectors – the food industry, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals – and the necessary research capacity to make a cluster based on all these ingredients work.



It seems that Catalonia would be fine as a separate state, if it can be established over opposition from Madrid. Since that is unlikely, Catalonia probably will wrest concessions in exchange for going along. 


----------------------------------------------------------
Here is Edward Hugh answering a commenters question:


Hi again aguest,

“Well, if “Catalonia would have a GDP level in line with some of Europe’s wealthiest nations”, then it would become a net contributor to the EU”

Actually Catalonia is already a net contributor to the EU and has long so been.

“which would not solve the issue of paying more in taxes to a supranational entity than it gets in return.”

This isn’t the problem. Catalans are quite happy, along with other members of the EU, to continue sharing some of the burden of supporting Spain. They are just tired of paying a disproportionate amount of the cost of maintaining a dysfunctional national state.

They would also like a bit more respect shown for all the effort they are making

true,MauvaisConseil,YAFrance,France,"&gt; Là où ce raisonnement pose problème, c'est dans le cas où l'assimilation complète des individus d'immigration extra-européenne se produit avant la substitution.

Tout d'abord, la première partie ""les « minorités visibles », en premier lieu d'origine noire et maghrébine, tendent à devenir majorité sur des portions en expansion constante du territoire français métropolitain"", est un constat.

Ensuite, l'assimilation n'est plus la doctrine d'intégration à la française depuis les années 70. On lui a préféré le communautarisme. Et pour les minorités visibles, il n'y a pas d'assimilation possible, Césaire l'a bien montré.

Il n'y aura pas d'assimilation des minorités visibles. Apprendre ""mes ancêtres les Gaulois à un Polonais, ça marche, mais à un Antillais, ça ne marche pas. Bref, [la négritude](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A9gritude), pour résumer. Ça ne veut pas dire qu'ils sont moins français, il n'y a pas de limite à l'amour de la France, ce qui est pour moi la seule marque d'intégration (et non d'assimilation).

Après, mon point de vue, c'est qu'un maghrébin mat ressemble à un italien du sud, honnêtement je ne vois pas la différence. Pareil pour plein de kabyles, ils ne font pas partie d'une minorité visible. L'assimilation est entièrement possible pour les maghrébins, mais il faut pour cela abandonner sa culture d'origine.

&gt;Il y a encore une centaine d'années, on bastonnait les polonais dans les mines.

Et alors ? Il y a une centaine d'années, la moitié des immigrés rentraient chez eux en moins de 5 ans. La situation n'a rien à voir avec celle d'aujourd'hui, les différences de développement entre les pays sont trop grandes, le nombre de personnes à intégrer est trop important, les moyens de l'état sont insuffisants. Ça ne marchera tout simplement pas tant qu'il y aura des communautés cloisonnées qui ont un fort attachement à leurs cultures d'origine.

Et ils abandonnaient en venant en France leur culture d'origine très vite, ce qui n'est plus le cas aujourd'hui.

&gt;Qui aujourd'hui considèrerait un Borowski, un Szwagier, un Stefanski comme un étranger ?

Est-ce que la France a colonisé la Pologne ? Est-ce qu'il y a eu une guerre entre la Pologne et la France ?

Voilà une grande différence.

The problem is that currently if illegals push their way through enough they'll eventually obtain a legal status. It should be made clear now: sorry, you won't get a legal status from now on. That's the first step. Word will spread hopefully. Then there are other incentives which can make our countries unattractive for illegal immigration, and sure, some might find it offensive.

you mean in Ukraine or Middle East or where? cause purpose of EU and NATO was and is quite clear - let's trade, not war. NATO never posed any military threat to Russia, on the contrary, it was trying, and still is, to have a dialog. Russia however...

&gt;Only when you put both versions side by side and in the general context, one can realize that both are partial and hide interests.

everyone in the world has interests, and more often than not they tend to forget their declared higher values in favor of interests. you think Swiss chose path of neutrality just because? I don't know your background is, but basically you have to choose *the* side, or sides, or something to hold on. f.e. I laugh and despise US for so many things, its corrupt political system, its fake facade and... oh boy I could go on. but I know that as a Lithuanian I have to thank them for being world police, for providing security and stability in the world even though they are looking out for their own interests by doing so. basically, you have to find something in the world where your interests of well-being as a citizen and taxpayer coincides with some other parties. Russia, on the other hand, is a real security threat for Northern hemisphere, and its government, patriots, and general population think that they can achieve its interests only by being this threat, in other words, by being a terrorists. and there's rationale for this behavior having history lessons they have, however my belief is that if they change their  course 180° they would become a lot more successful as a nation, but it's a loooong way to go. 

other way to look at the world is to take high moral ground and be resentful to everyone, and I mean everyone, cause every nation every country every group of people are fucked up in their own special way with closets full of skeletons. while this is true that the world would be way better place if everyone would just take a higher moral ground, it's unfortunately just as utopic idea as communism. and no country no man cannot yet live full complete life without trade and social interaction.

to sum up - everyone is bad, but Russia is worst. that's why when I (and other people on /r/europe or in Poland/Lithuania) see Putin's apologists, Russian propagandists and conspiracy theories which just deny every fact there is and every law of the universe and spew shit like ""Ukrainians shot down plane themselves"" and call it ""different opinion"", we tend to just ridicule them, not take seriously, and call them many different insulting names - it's just too obvious to deny, and if you are denying, then either you have some ulterior motive, either you are just too dumb to talk with. so still, even while I write this long post I am still very doubtful if I will be heard or understood on some level. I hope not, but that's all there is in this damned world - hope. hope this terrorist country will not achieve its purpose, hope European countries will take higher moral ground and will help Easterners despite the promises and bribes and simpler (as it may seem) pragmatic solution they will be offered.",0,1410560079,null,0,false,0,ckgoqyj,t3_2g82z1,t1_ckgoqyj,t1_ckgnld8,null,1427043516,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

&gt; Btw, if you have time, how accurate is this piece in the Danish newspaper Politiken. He seems the writer has the biggest metaphorical boner for FI (not an actual one though, that would be misogynistic) 

Judging by the polls I've seen, FI has no real chance of getting into the Swedish parliament. They can get voters in the EU parliament when voter turnout is relatively low and there's little at stake, but with the upcoming election looking like a very close run between the social democrats and the moderates, people will be much more hesitant to vote for a ""fringe"" party.

I also think the author severely overestimates the party's influence on politics.

On a side note. .. had Ukrainian people been keen for there to be a vote to join Russia before Russia invaded, aside from the 1 vote in the early 90's?

Also, it's worth remembering that the host country is not compelled to accept a proposed vote for regional independence. Spain has been refusing Basque applications for a independence vote for years.

And, the Russian-inspired vote was not even a serious choice,  there was no option for people to vote to stay with Crimea. The vote was a sham.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;You mean the sovereign debt crisis everybody has? How come the EU gets blamed for that one?

It is significantly worse in ailing Eurozone economies due to the shared currency. Normally countries in financial trouble would just print more money and make the relative value of their debt obligations become smaller (inflate away their debt). So Southern European economies are in free fall, and dependent on bailout money which they are being given in exchange for austerity, and it is turning out that austerity was potentially the wrong method (see, IMF reports, who initially advocated austerity). It was all very poorly handled and no solution has yet been reached. Even has the huge Europhile I am, I can't say that the Eurocrisis was anything other than poorly handled. It wasn't as badly handled as some people thing, but it was still poorly handled. 

&gt;And what exactly is bad (aside from Africa, but we are talking about Czech republic here) about agricultral policy

Because the purpose of the CAP was to ensure European food independence which it hasn't achieved, and instead of the money going to small scale, innovative farmers, it has gone to large scale, multinational conglomerates like Nestlé, and also the British Royal Family. So it's effectively damaging to economic enterprise and continues to fail hopelessly at achieving its goals. Seems pretty poor to me. 

&gt;And what the fuck does that have to do with the Euro

It doesn't. But it is an example of poor management (note: I did not say 'incompetence'. I am not going that far) by the European Union which would make Czechs and other non-Eurozone countries suspicious of the credentials of joining the Euro. 

&gt;And mass immigration? I don't even...

One of the pillars of the EU is freedom of movement, specifically of labour. This is a pillar I support, but it is viewed negatively by a lot of individuals throughout Europe, in the West because migration depressed high Western European wages, and in the East and South because it has led to a 'brain drain'. It is a pillar I fundamentally support, but it has led to many problems which could have been and should be offset.

NATO has bases in many countries and still seeks to expand when it was agreed that it wouldn't happen after the fall of the USSR. We can argue if that supposes a military threat or not, but not following the pacts and enlarging into another country sphere of influence is at least a reason for mistrust.

You are saying that both parts are evil but you are sided with one because of a personal interest. I think that is the best way to promote conflict and giving reasons for the other part to be unable to reform and become better. I haven't seen Russia starting any major conflict, but I have seen the US having wars at least officially with Afghanistan, Iraq, and many more. I am not sure if Russia is a threat, but I know a country is a threat when they act without having UN resolutions.

Nothing can justify closets full of skeletons. I go home I open my closet and it is empty, and so I would like to be my country to be. If social interactions are based on openness, there is no need to have them. And I don't believe neither in the utopia of unbridled communism, nor in unbridled capitalism, but rather in some realistic approach based on mutual understanding.

There is no need to side with the ""bad"", no matter which one is worst. Hate cannot be defeated with hate, and lies cannot be replied with lies. The truth is that it is still unknown who was shot the plane and under which circumstances and no side has offered conclusive proof other than ""it was something fast"". And from that we see finger pointing when there is nothing to hold to. Here we hear one, and over there they hear another one. Does it mean that the preferred version here is more credible? I want facts and none has given them, so I mistrust them both. And I post this here to make people aware of what they say over there, which is not any better of what they say on this side of the fence.

If someone can help Easterners is ourselves to point out that the powers of each block are defending their turf, but none is putting human rights first. And I am convinced that neither NATO nor Russia can get out of this. It has to be people like us that point out how information is used for power interests, but not for the interest of the people.

true,iisno1uno,LITH,Lithuania,"&gt;NATO has bases in many countries and still seeks to expand when it was agreed that it wouldn't happen after the fall of the USSR.

I heard that myth(?) million times, and still no one provided the source (not that I asked or searched myself). who, when, to who, and why gave that promise? on the contrary, I read not so long ago one Danish(?) journalist saying there was no promise of that sort and there couldn't theoretically be because this even wasn't on agenda in 1990, since Gorbachiov had many other issues to deal with and independences of Baltic countries weren't even declared/recognized yet. anyways, even if there was some promise by some government official of some country, it wasn't in writing, it wasn't a treaty or anything like that, and here I come to my next point:

&gt;NATO seeks to expand

I hear that a lot. actually, NATO itself does not seek to expand, no one is rushing to accept Georgia or Ukraine (or Sweden and Finland for that matter). there was A LOT of negativity from old members towards accepting Baltics. thing is, it's not NATO expanding (like some monster who is colonizing new territories), it's that sovereign countries in fear of their security and because of their Western oriented views are pushing and asking NATO to let them join. f.e. Baltics made their priority to join EU and NATO in the first years when independence was regained, and started working towards that. and as I said, NATO didn't open their arms straight away, even US was hesitant. and thank god we did achieve that in time, cause otherwise we would have been considered under the Russian zone of influence and things like in Georgia/Moldova/Ukraine might have been happening there.

Ukrainian leaders up until last month, when Russia burned all the bridges as they say, weren't declaring any interest of joining NATO, and actually publicly stated they do not want to join. and I can guarantee that at the very least 10 years will pass until Ukraine will be ready if ever to do so. so, again, NATO isn't expanding per se, it's not its purpose.

&gt;We can argue if that supposes a military threat or not

yes, I fully understand why Russia as such might be afraid of NATO/Western powers (well, just look at their history), but it's impossible to even imagine NATO would go on offensive on a conventional war scale against nuclear country. NATO always was transparent with Russia, a lot of treaties exist, one allows to inspect each others military on the ground and from the air (which Russia few months back broke unilaterally), also on a diplomatic level there was always cooperation. Poland 15 years already in NATO, Baltics 10, and still no bases there, no US soldiers, nothing. only 2-4 planes in the airspace rotating from countries like Portugal, Romania, and US obviously and occasional military exercises for like 300-500 visiting US soldiers. doesn't seem like a threat to me. well, if NATO was a threat to Russia really, I imagine two years after Baltics have entered NATO there would have been 10k US soldiers located in each of the country alongside with tanks and such. even now, when Baltics got really scared because of events in Ukraine, everything that has happened is: increased Baltic airspace policing (now it's 10-20 jets instead of usual 2-4, also it coincides with increased Russian provocations, when they fly straight into our airspace and then suddenly change the course, or are flying near borders with heavy armored planes designed to carry nuclear weapons etc. for some reason no NATO jets are testing the waters like that), +temporary presence of ~500 US soldiers who are participating in exercises throughout the Baltics, so far they are deployed until the end of this year, +there were one big military exercises in Lithuania with total of ~5k soldiers from Denmark, UK, Poland etc. not really a threat is it?

&gt;enlarging into another country sphere of influence

we are sovereign countries, we are under no one's sphere of influence, especially not under Russian. the term itself is poisonous. if sovereign country like Ukraine chooses not to be under someone's sphere of influence it should be aloud to do as it wants, and Russia can't claim nothing. and yet again - NATO is not enlarging into Ukraine, at least not for a veeery long time if ever.

&gt;You are saying that both parts are evil but you are sided with one because of a personal interest.

I am saying our world is fucked up. and yet it's the best we got.

&gt;I haven't seen Russia starting any major conflict

Chechnya, Georgia, Ukraine.

&gt;I have seen the US having wars at least officially with Afghanistan, Iraq, and many more.

they did not war with Afghanistan. USSR are the ones who wared with Afghanistan however. yes, Iraq was ugly, it was mistake, I do not support them, however, it's not like land-grab in Georgia or Ukraine. 

and if you want to talk about many more... should I open USSR war and military interference history? 

&gt;I am not sure if Russia is a threat

so how do you call what they are doing in Eastern Ukraine? what about my mentioned provocations against Baltics? even against Sweden, Finland. what about the recent kidnapping of security officer on the Estonian soil? what about Moldova and Padniestre? Kaliningrad, f.e. is heavily militarized. in that small piece of land they have more soldiers stationed than Baltics have active military personnel combined. 

&gt;Nothing can justify closets full of skeletons. 

it's ugly world. but as I said, every country has them. it says more about human nature, but that's probably topic for another time.

&gt;And I don't believe neither in the utopia of unbridled communism, nor in unbridled capitalism, but rather in some realistic approach based on mutual understanding.

what about Scandinavian social democracy?

&gt;There is no need to side with the ""bad"", no matter which one is worst.

the good of the scorpion is not the good of the frog. small countries like Baltics have to side. Switzerland can be neutral, Netherlands could be, Belgium, etc. it's very fortunate to have good geography and cool neighbours. Lithuania f.e. does not have this luxury. we must side with Western World / EU / NATO, cause alternative is not pleasant. we experienced it. for centuries. and in most recent history. not siding with US f.e. would mean eventual loss of sovereignty.

&gt;Hate cannot be defeated with hate, and lies cannot be replied with lies.

that's why we say - Russia, c'mon, wake up, become democratic prosperous country, cool neighbour, the one we can have strong trade relations with. unfortunately, they weren't lucky enough with the government, and it doesn't seem likely they will get one in the near future. firstly, the mindset of Russian people must change, which is absolutely hateful towards West. actually, they do not like no-one. they do not even like themselves. ah, but yet again, it's another topic.

as for the plane...

the investigation shows it was shot from the earth - proved

the investigation shows there were no planes/jest around the Boeing - proved

it was shot down over the rebel controlled area - proved

it fell into the rebel controlled area - proved 

different witnesses say rebels had BUK, photos show rebels having BUK, NATO claims BUK crossed Ukrainian border from Russia and then back, evidences say BUK was in that area during the incident - proved/debatable

rebels on social media bragged instantly after the plane crashed about shooting down a ""Ukrainian military transport plane"" and then after they understood it was civilian all the entries were deleted - proved

phone calls released by SBU of rebels talking shooting down that plane - debatable 

Ukrainian army have never shot anything into the air and had no reason to do so simply because rebels did not have any flying objects - fact

rebels have shot down many Ukrainian aircrafts during the conflict - fact

what kind of additional evidences one might need?

&gt;If someone can help Easterners is ourselves to point out that the powers of each block are defending their turf

are you Bulgarian? anyways, ""us Easterners"" ARE NATO. WE are defending our turf and our interests. and our interests are to be safe, to live our lives, trade, build homes, and to live happily ever after. at least here in Baltics we have been doing it quite successfully, a lot of significant progress was made and will be in the future. and that's why we understand Ukraine - if it wants to align itself with EU instead of Russia it has to have the right to do so, cause so far that's the only way of actual progress. 

&gt;And I am convinced that neither NATO nor Russia can get out of this.

exactly, shit that is happening is no good for no one. at least, if your interests are to live. however, many Russians are ready to die. because of their tsar, because of imperialistic and chauvinistic ideas. because of ""Western homogayjewfascists are coming"".

and yes, there are a lot of misinformation out there. but you talk about Western media as if it was some unison like the Russian one. no it is not! Russian media is controlled by government and are spewing lies, twisting facts and fabricating news stories. 

Western media are not some ""side"" that you can put against the Russian counterparts. Western media is divided, independent, with a lot of different views, credible socially responsible journalism (which has NEVER existed in Russia. NEVER). so when someone says something along the lines ""well, there are lies from both sides"", my first response is ""there are no two sides. there is Russian side and countless other sources, if they all tend to portray some truth and reach same conclusion then maybe Russian side is lying?"". and lying they do. so many funny examples of FABRICATED stories. I will not go into this right now cause I'm half asleep already. I just want to remind you that on primetime in the news they claimed Ukrainian army crossified and killed 8yo boy in front of his mother when they retook Slavyansk. I mean...

The thing is that you can keep dividing and dividing by any means possible. There will still be bad governments and disgruntled peoples. I think the better option is to struggle for unity and participation - for government that responds to citizen needs. This is why the structure of government is important - the tyranny of the majority cannot work in any situation. Leaving the country is not a solution - at least, not for the country. Maybe for those who leave. But what if they leave to form a new tyranny of the majority? 

I've seen many countries where rural areas suffer due to central government policies. Is fragmentation the answer? I don't think so. Especially if the disadvantaged are scattered between major cities. A bit harder to divvy up. Reform of the system is the answer. It's a long and difficult process, but what happens if small rural areas break off? If they even can - could you have a leopard-like map? Dots of cities belonging to one country surrounded by rural areas belonging to another? Does the situation improve? Reform rather than fragmentation. It's not an immediate solution, but it's a better one in the long run. 

And then if we were talking about ethnicity, which is hard to avoid since it does become prevalent in most discussions of secession - well, I know Macedonia to some extent. So, the west is largely Albanian, the rest is largely Macedonia. What about a town like Kicevo, which is about 55% Macedonian and 28% Albanian? Both significant numbers. Where does that go? And if you have a nation based on identity in case of division, what happens to the people who don't belong? Should more than a quarter of the population leave the city they consider home because of power hungry politicians? What about the terrible upheaval of the great population exchange between Greece and Turkey? My own grandparents were kicked out of their home in Silesia because of their language and heritage, even though their actions were very anti-Hitler. I don't believe in just forcing people to move. Why should diversity in any form - ethnic, religious, lingual, etc - be such a terrible thing?

There are advantages to both (the less special letters the less need for transcription for example). I disagree about the speed of reading, you don't readsingle letters anyway - you read words and lines at once. I would get rid of the ch, rz and ó before changing anything else in Polish language.

Btw Polish adopted words en masse too - we just have grammar that almost force you to change the spelling eventually(because you need to declinate and add pre and post fixes to words to use them). So we have komputer and  kolor and bateria and akumulator. Btw we stolen words for color from 3 languages: kolor is color, barwa(Czech color) is sth like shade or hue buf not exactly, and farba(German color) is a paint.

true,vieque,GERM,Germany,"There's two different things you have to differentiate: Censorship by the company and the state. Most media isn't actually really censored by the state, nor are many things forbidden outright, but media (like games) are rated by the BPjS (Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien - Federal agency for media that is dangerous to minors).

In almost all cases when a game or movie is censored it's because they want to get a lower rating than what they would get if they left it uncut. This is especially critical for stuff that's rated to be ""dangerous to young people"" because you can't advertise them or put them on shelves in stores (so they can be only available on request or if there is an adult-only section). That's only-sort of related to labels though, because some titles might also be rated 18+, but not put on the index of media that's dangerous to youths specifically (so they should be able to put it on shelfs and so on, but it's been too long since I've bought any physical media, can't even remember anymore).

Since that's very limiting companies often self-censor themselves to get a 16+ label or at least get 18+ without being on the index, pretty much akin to how in the US movies are often cut to be suitable for PG-13 instead of R-rated. So long as the game isn't put on a separate index of stuff that's completely outlawed (because it violates laws), all uncut versions of these games or other media is completely legal in Germany and could theoretically be sold or distributed so long as the appropriate age checks are done (which most companies, specifically Steam for example, don't do, which is why they can only sell cut versions).

As for these specific games, probably to prevent trivialization it would have only gotten a high rating if it features swastikas or other such symbols or the company just didn't want to bother and cut it out before submitting stuff.",0,1410592286,null,0,1410592729,0,ckh0ccc,t3_2g701b,t1_ckh0ccc,t1_ckh02yi,null,1427036973,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

* In Russia more than a quarter of people fear of possible political prosecution in case if they answer polls with a criticism of the state (6% are sure they will be prosecuted, 22% fear it's likely, 44% unlikely, and 17% are sure they can't be prosecuted for that).

* 32% of all Russians can't talk freely or at all about politics. And out of people who admitted they don't support Putin that's already 40%.

Now go meta and imagine how much of people who fear political prosecution and can't freely speak about politics because they don't support current state policies managed to overcome their fears to answer political polls honestly or agreed to participate in a poll at all. I imagine not much of them. Even this poll above should be normalized by this fear coefficient.

You should also take into account that a lot of polls are conducted over the phone, which means 100% ability to identify the respondent.

Now finally compare Russia where all the violence people see is on TV and Crimea which was recently annexed and armed people are on streets. Crimeans have much more reasons to fear answering the polls ""in the wrong way"".

true,metroxed,EUSK,Basque Country,"The education reform implemented by the current Spanish government (which will be implemented for the first time this year) called ""LOMCE"", gives absolute priority to the Castilian language in detriment of the regional languages, especially Catalan and Basque, but also Galician. Not only is there pressure to increase the number of Spanish-only hours in class, but also make Spanish the only main language of education.

If someone does not want their children to learn Catalan or Basque (for whatever reason, which most of the cases are political), traditionally they sent their children to Spanish-only private schools (with the social detriment that means for said children, who will be monolinguals in a bilingual society, but that's off topic). With the reform, the Government of Catalonia will be forced to either accommodate them in the public school (reducing the number of Catalan hours in a given class) or paying them the private school. If the government was to pay for the private education of your children, what would you choose?

The goals are clear; the Spanish Education Minister said, himself, in the Congress, that the objective of the reform was no other than to ""Spanish-ize"" (españolizar) the children of Catalonia ([Source](http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2012/10/10/actualidad/1349859896_604912.html)).

Traditionally is the Basque pro-independence movements who make most of the noise about separatism in Spain, and that have more support within the local (Basque) population. What happens is that lately Catalan independence support has skyrocketed; and as Catalonia has more population than the Basque Country and it's more important within the Madrid-Barcelona duality, then most people and media (and the world) are giving more importance to the Catalan issue, especially because there's a date for a referendum.

This kind of demonstrations, with thousands rallying in the streets; we have been doing them for decades now.

In sounds small compared to the number of people who showed up in Barcelona, but we only have a population of 2,2 million, whereas Catalonia has 7,5 million.

From a political perspective, the Basque Government, the Basque Parliament, and up to 95% of the Basque municipalities are controlled by nationalists and independentists, so I would say the political support is there. In the French Basque Country is slowly growing too; the main pro-independence party Euskal Herria Bai now controls for the first time the local government of a town with a population greater than 5000 (previously only controlled smaller ones).

Yes, let’s not worry ourselves with such pettiness as definition of democracy...

Spoken like a true democrat.

The idea of democracy is to give the people the power to govern themselves and for that to be possible a free flow of ideas and opinions needs to exist. That’s why we have freedom of speech.

There is a basic flaw in democracy, though — which is why Churchill called it the ‘worst form of government except all the others’ — and that is its potential to turn into a tyranny of the majority. Just because the majority of population agrees that someone’s basic human rights need to be taken away from them, doesn’t mean their will should be followed.

Freedom of speech exists to guarantee that no ones world view is forcefully changed and/or his freedom to express that world view oppressed, simply because there’s no objective world view, rather everyone’s world view is subjective and, thus, part of their identity.

That is why, in a democracy, you don’t censors someone’s freedom to express their world view, but you’re both given the right to change each other’s world view through free flow of ideas.

If you limit freedom of speech, it sets a bad precedent, except in cases such as libel, where one’s identity, image and possibly livelihood are directly endangered through mis- and disinformation. Under what pretense is it OK to limit it?

You say if it threatens or advocates against democracy and freedom of speech.

First of all, who will decide what threatens democracy, and thus needs to be punished? That seems like too much power for one person or entity to have.

Second, if you censor free speech, it goes against the basic idea of democracy that conflicting opinions need not be censored but challenged in an open debate. With all facts and both sides’ opinions presented, the public can decide what is ‘right’ and ‘wrong’. There is nothing more democratic than that.

Third, it is vital for democracy to always question and critically approach *status quo*, rather then defend it and uncritically maintain it.

Fourth, let’s have a little thought experiment. I take a megaphone and in the Brussels’ main square I announce that ‘Demoracy is flawed, freedom of speech needs to be abolished and all Jews need to be killed.’ There are a few possible scenarios from there on:

1. I am considered a lunatic and ignored.

2. My opinion is censored because the majority disproves of it. This sets the precedent that majority is always right and that it can take away even some of our basic human rights. This is a greater threat to democracy than anything I’ve said, because it leads into a downwards spiral of unifying and homogenizing the spectrum of opinions by dismissing all those in minority, and thus eventually trumping all diversity, turning all of us into clones of each other.

3. I gain support of the people. This points again to the problem of tyranny of the majority. If dissenting opinion can be censored by the majority disagreeing with it, than my opinion should also be enforced if it gains the support of the majority. Because, if it gained support of the people who have the right to govern themselves, and that through a democratic process, which in this case would be true, then it is democratic to act upon the will of the majority, at least according to your opinion.

4. My view of the world is confronted and discussed in an open and free debate, and it is either changed or I’m simply ignored further on for refusing to do so.

Which one of these seems more democratic to you?

Fifth, and last, censoring dissenting opinion is a cheap cop-out. We should strive to make an effort to change what we don’t like in the world, rather then simply banning it and ostracizing it.",0,1410595617,null,0,1410630540,0,ckh0zeh,t3_2g701b,t1_ckh0zeh,t1_ckgonvy,null,1427036590,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

But the French Basque and Catalan areas have very little separatism. I'd call it largely negligible. That's perhaps due to the fact that they're much smaller and much less populated than the Spanish regions, and also that France did suppress regional languages more effectively back in the day. But today the regional languages are still largely understood in those areas, yet there's no strong push for separatism.

However, I wouldn't be surprised if the French government opposed Spanish Basque and Catalan independence, out of fear that France's own Basques and Catalans might want to secede and join their Iberian counterparts. 

Unless we rather consider that now that the Basques and Catalans have a country to the detriment of Spain, the Basques and Catalans in France would be even less of a problem because they'd just be happy to know that their culture has its country already.

Ich find's ja schön das Du dich im wesentlichen auf Wikipediaartikel und Medienspekulationen beziehst, nur um eine dämliche Wortwahl in einem dämlichen Artikel zu verteidigen. Warum auch immer. Denn nur darum geht es.

Um die Frage, inwiefern ein Begriff wie ""Eliteeinheit"" angemessen ist und die Feststellung, dass dieser in den Medien inflationär gebraucht wird.

Und eine Einheit wie diese ist nunmal nach - meinem - Verständnis keine Eliteeinheit. Was sich im übrigen auch daran zeigt, das Eliteeinheiten gemeinhin nicht aus Reservisten zusammengestellt werden, die solche Briefe wie die hier diskutierten verfassen. 

Also: als Elite würde ich militärische Einheiten bezeichnen die eine Auswahl nach besonderen körperlichen, intellektuellen und psychischen Kriterien vornehmen und zusätzlich ideologisch besonders gefestigt sind. Die demgemäß besonders risikoreiche und persönlich gefährdende Einsätze ausführen. Ich würde etwa Navy SEALs, KSK oder Jechidat Duvdevan als Eliteeinheiten bezeichnen.

Die fragliche Unit 8200 ist halt 'ne nachrichtendienstliche Struktur aus Leuten die technische Geräte bedienen, Sprachkenntnisse haben und ggf. auch was programmieren. Das machen die sicherlich auch gut aber das macht sie nunmal nicht zur Eliteeinheit.

As I said I don't really give a shit. Say for example tomorrow torrent technology disappears and there becomes a ZERO way to watch tv and movies that torrents and popcorntime provide - I wouldn't then go pay for netlfilix for the reasons outlined above. 

I'd either play more Open Red Alert (http://www.openra.net/) or Mega Glest (http://megaglest.org/) or the hundreds of other open source games or watch BBC Iplayer and 4od (2 free british streaming stuff with all british stuff on) or YouTube. 

The majority of stuff i watch anyway is British TV which I already contribute to by a TV license in the UK. 

Sure you might call it selfish or inconsiderate (which it is) but as i said I really don't give a shit and the bottom line is I wouldn't be contributing to the production costs of those shows anyway. 

So in that vein I may as well utilise the frontier of opensource technology which surpasses the closed sourced (netflix) variant ",0,1410598654,null,0,false,0,ckh1i5g,t3_2g773s,t1_ckh1i5g,t1_ckh1e6e,null,1427036255,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

That is pretty fucked up imho. You invaded and occupied a country for 11 years. And now, when you are gone for 2 years you shirk all responsibility for the country by saying 'they asked us to leave'. Well guess what, they never asked you to invade the country.

Al Qaida in Iraq (or IS as they call themselves now) has been active in Iraq from long before the invasion in 2003. Except, it was the Iraqi military that kept them underground and small. 

Then the US [disbanded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_Provisional_Authority_Order_2) the Iraqi military. The only thing that kept Iraq clear of Jihadi's for the past 20 years. And then you spent billions on building a new army. And look at how competent they are...

Also: Malaki became PM in [2006](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri_al-Maliki). So for 7 years the US has let Malaki do whatever the fuck he wants and now that his policies has resulted in this enourmous discontent that allowed IS to rise.

As my (Greek) family told me the prices for bottled water are regulated in Greece, that's why even a kiosk in the most touristy places in Athens doesn't charge more than one euro for a big bottle - the same kiosk in Berlin would ask for at least triple that amount. 

I visit Greece quite often and I usually buy one bottle every other day or so and keep filling that one up - to the endless amazement of my family which simply cannot understand why I would carry this bottle around with when it is so much easier to just throw it away and buy a new one - after all they are so cheap.

true,vieque,GERM,Germany,"&gt; First of all, who will decide what threatens democracy, and thus needs to be punished? That seems like too much power for one person or entity to have.

That's wrong. Nothing is declared a thread and punished. Certain things are restricted or outlawed and only those who then use it are prosecuted for it. In Germany the Grundgesetz or Basic Law (i.e. constitution in everything but name) already gives everybody unlimited freedom of speech so long as it is within the bounds of the law. The symbols like swastika are prohibited because they are considered a party symbol and propaganda for parties that are outlawed (due to not conforming to the constitution in their goals) cannot be used for PROPAGANDA purposes. It's not outlawed in most other cases.

There really are very few other exceptions to free speech other than libel, youth protection and conforming to some other laws in a similar vein.

&gt; Second, if you censor free speech, it goes against the basic idea of democracy that conflicting opinions need not be censored but challenged in an open debate. With all facts and both sides’ opinions presented, the public can decide what is ‘right’ and ‘wrong’. There is nothing more democratic than that.

That's not the definition of democracy at all (here is one: ""a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.""). Just how it usually plays out. Direct Democracy (everybody discusses and votes on every issue) like that doesn't exist in most countries, they vote for people to represent them. In Germany that's the Bundestag, and they vote on what they consider to be the right choice in these matters.

&gt; Third, it is vital for democracy to always question and critically approach status quo, rather then defend it and uncritically maintain it.

You can, so long as it doesn't endanger minors, uses propaganda for outlawed parties etc. etc. What you cannot do is go against certain articles in the Basic Law, such as the fact that Germany is a democratic Republic. You cannot form a monarchist party or a party trying to implement communist dictatorship. What you can do is propose a new Basic Law system or attempt to change it (which requires a 66% majority vote and happens once in a blue moon).

&gt; Fourth, let’s have a little thought experiment. I take a megaphone and in the Brussels’ main square I announce that ‘Demoracy is flawed, freedom of speech needs to be abolished and all Jews need to be killed.’ There are a few possible scenarios from there on:

All of which are horrible straw man arguments that are really neat in theory but still really stupid. Here is a ""little thought experiment"" experiment (read: straw man bs that doesn't have anything to do with reality) about unlimited free speech.

1. I call up the police and tell them I planted a bomb in a local school. It's cool though, just expressing my opinion.
2. I am called to court. Of course I claim he did it. I don't like his hair cut, so I want him to go to prison for something. Not like they can bring me up on perjury charges, it's just my opinion that he did it.
3. Allergic against peanuts? Yeah our ""Freshly fried peanut chips"" don't contain any. At least in my opinion they don't.
4. Sometimes I just like to yell ""Fire!"" for fun. Oh yeah, that's just an opinion I happen to have.

&gt; Fifth, and last, censoring dissenting opinion is a cheap cop-out. We should strive to make an effort to change what we don’t like in the world, rather then simply banning it and ostracizing it.

Yeah. Well, everybody does that already. Certain things (e.g. nazi propaganda) are banned to protect those that cannot protect themselves (e.g. minors), but they are far and few between and that's it.",0,1410603725,null,0,false,0,ckh2ar2,t3_2g701b,t1_ckh2ar2,t1_ckh0zeh,null,1427035857,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Sebst die Leute auf HN redeten grösstenteils von NSA und ""Mossad"", und Mossad bedeutet eben Unit 8200, denn die sind für diesen Aspekt zuständig. Das auf ""Wikipedia"" (Ja und? Was tut dir daran so weh, haha? Fussnoten kennste, gell?) und ""Medienspekulationen"" zu reduzieren ist nur mehr von deiner billigen Sophisterei.

&gt; Was sich im übrigen auch daran zeigt, das Eliteeinheiten gemeinhin nicht aus Reservisten zusammengestellt werden, die solche Briefe wie die hier diskutierten verfassen.

Die sind dann allerdings immer noch Ex-Mitarbeiter eines der grössten Geheimdienste der Welt.

Dass Medien das Wort ""Elite"" inflationär gebrauchen, um aufzubauschen ist ja schön, aber irgendwie auch nebensächlich. Der Guardian-Artikel kommt jedenfalls ohne aus. Vielleicht übersetzen die Deutschen auch irgendwelche Worte besonders dumm, wäre ja auch nix neues.. aber darum geht es wie gesagt gar nicht: die tun was sie tun, die Leute haben beschrieben, was sie beschrieben haben. Da man über all das reden kann, ohne sich an ""Elite"" hochzuziehen, ist das ausschießliche Tun dessen bestenfalls dumm, schlimmstenfalls Ablenkung. Ihr blökt hier so stammtischmässig rum, und du lallst mir was von Pubertät? Heh.

Überhaupt, laut deiner Definition von Elite werden diese super-indoktrinierten Roboter *niemals* auspacken. Wie praktisch. Auch Binney oder Drake können ja nix gewußt haben, waren ja offensichtlich nicht wirklich loyal, also nicht Elite. Wortspiele sind geil.

This again could be followed up by the merging of all europen army into one which would reduce costs and again decision making processes. 

The impact on world politics would be immens. While the eu doesnt have the aircraftcarrieres the US has it has effectivly the second largest army in the world while maintaining a high level of modern equipment for half the price compared to the US.

This would make the word of the EU have a comparable impact on worldpolitical scale as the US has in terms of enforcing ""freedoms"".

Another point that surfaced is the ukrainian crisis the EU has to deal with. We have a huge problem because we are dependent on Russian GAS which is hindering us to engange in an agressive manner against Putin.

Das ist die Grundlage der Demokratie. Die gewählte Mehrheit kann darüber entscheiden, was für Rechte das Individuum hat. Dass Minderheiten so berücksichtigt werden, ist erst einer langsamen Entwicklung der letzten 20 Jahre zu verdanken. Und warum? Nicht weil der ""Mob"" unterwegs war, sondern weil viele Individuen immer wieder zivilen Ungehorsam begangen haben, um die universellen Recht nicht nur auf Deutsche oder Heterosexuelle oder Christen anzuwenden. Wie gesagt, dein Freiheitsbegriff ist äußerst naiv, weil er so formal ist. Nazis operieren unter dem Deckmantel dieser naiven Rechte.

&gt;Und die Mehrheit darf nun entscheiden wie mit dieser Tat zu verfahren ist.

true,Kryptospuridium137,ESPA,Canary Islands,"Well, freedom of movement between member countries makes it significantly easier for people to... well, move... So people are more willing to visit places they might not have before if they had to go through heavy paperwork and such measures. That means more tourism between member states, which is always good. Especially if they also share a common currency that is worth the same regardless of where the tourist came from.  

From the point of view of the citizen it's also a great idea, since, if you aren't satisfied with your prospect of life in a place you can always ""easily"" (as long as you can afford it, of course) pick your baggage and go where the grass is greener. Ideally, this would mean that member states share human capital (a Spaniard who currently can't find a job can go work on, say, France. And a British doctor who's tired of the work load can choose to work on a more relaxed place).  

Of course, this second point is a negative from the point of view of the country itself, since one country is losing a job a native could have had and the other is losing a trained professional. 

This also makes all the economies involved much more competitive, since your workers aren't competing just between themselves but also between the potential workers of all member states as well. This could be a very good or a very, *very* bad thing depending on your point of view. 

Nonetheless, it's also true that these problems would exist as long as there is any immigration at all. And it's debatable whether a Freedom of Movement policy truly significantly worsens these problems or just merely makes them more visible (I am in no way an expert, so my take on the matter is unimportant).

I'm not sure why I felt called out there... 

My idea is not based on evidence so I'm not going to push it too hard. There are many better qualified people who can argue for/against these points. What I wanted to say was that democracy is imperfect and that you can't shove ideas down peoples throats. If any ""significant minority"" doesn't like an idea then it MUST be reconsidered. I'm not condoning separatism by any means, but if a genuine impasse is reached, sometimes it is a good option.

In your example of Kicevo, I would ask if the 28% Albanian population is happy and has the same rights/oportunities as the 55% Macedonian population. If more than 50% of the decisions made by the city about daily life actually benefit them there is NO reason for them to feel like they don't belong. But if the majority of the daily decisions the city makes disadvantage them then it is not good for them to stay. Now, a lot of the decisions a city will make will benefit BOTH sides, some might disadvantage a certain group, but not always the same group. This is what I was getting at. It is the responsibility of a government to keep its population prosperous and happy. If they fail to do that, separatism will flourish.

As for rural vs non-rural areas, I don't have a solution. I too have seen this and it is endemic of any government that has a significant party system. Most votes are gathered by the majority and so the parties tend to focus on the large cities to gather votes. This leaves rural areas unrepresented. This could be solved if the votes were proportional to the amount of land you own but that would be retarded. I think that the Irish system of a representative in parliament represents a certain number of people in a particular region is probably the best way to address this issue and yet it still doesn't solve it completely.

Wenn du genau darüber nachdenkst, kann man nicht widerspruchsfrei für eine Seite argumentieren. Und in der Geschichte hat sich gezeigt, dass gerade die Universellen Rechte immer der Denkmantel für Diskriminierung war. Die Verfassung der USA oder die Allgemeine Menschenrechtserklärung waren universell formuliert, galten allerdings in der Praxis nur für weiße, christliche, heterosexuelle, besitzende Männer. Mit der Geschichte universeller Rechte sollte man sich auseinandersetzen, ehe man sie naiv vorbringt.

&gt;Die logische Schlussfolgerung von ""Ich möchte nicht, dass Nazis sich ohne rechtliche Folgen frei äußern können"" ist - für Normalsterbliche zumindest - ""Ich möchte nicht, dass bestimte Personen freie Meinungsäußerung betreiben können"" = ""Ich bin gegen freie Meinungsäußerung"".

- some people can't speak English and don't want to learn it through television (In Germany: Older Generation, especially from the east, foreigners, etc)
- It's easier to follow. You don't have to read, you don't have to concentrate. Some people just watch TV to relax or while working on something else. 
- Sometimes you can't watch the facial expressions and gestures while reading the subtitles during dialog.

Wo anders gelten ""andere universelle Grundrechte"". Also können wir uns doch schonmal darauf einigen, dass sie in diesem Punkt, auch von dir, eine Einschränkung erfahren und somit nicht mehr allgemein sind, sonder sich auf die Staatsbürgerschaft beschränken.
Die Einschränkung von Grungrechten geht auch in den anderen von dir aufgemachten Szenarien weiter. In Russland darf Snwoden bleiben, weil Putin dies so entschieden hat. Russland ist kein Beispiel für die Verteidigung von Freiheiten. Kommt Snwoden nach Deutschland, würde die Bundesregierung die US-Gesetze brechen. Also eine Institution, die sich an universelle Grundrechte halten muss, bricht sie. Was lernen wir daraus? Es gibt  keine universellen Rechte, in dem Sinn, dass sie allgemeine Gültigkeit haben. Sie sind im Falle von Snowden auch abhängig von der *Meinung*. Und da sich viele Leute angepisst fühlen durch die USA, ist es ""mobartig"" legitim gewisse Grundrechte zu brechen. Was mich zu dem Punkt führt, dass ich nicht für das Brechen von Grundrechten bin, dass allerdings deine Vorstellung von universell gelten Grundrechten einfach nicht existiert, sondern dass sie immer mit der Praxis und den Inhalten in Kontakt stehen.

I've yet too see one example of this being objectivly true. Czech dubbing is usually atrocious. Even when I rewatch things I loved as a kid and got used to dubbing I still prefer the original. Like the Simpsons. The voices might ""sound"" wrong when you're not used to them, but the czech translation is horrible. 
  
Example: Simpsons episode Weekend at Burnsie's where Homer smokes pot, Ned Flanders wants him to sign petition to recriminalize medicial marijuana. In the Czech version, he asks him to sign petition to LEGALIZE it. Not only it's legal at that point, but the translator clearly gives no shit about the show... why would Ned Flanders out of all the people support such thing.  
  
As I rewatch more and more stuff I find there are plenty of those things in every movie/show ever dubbed. Some are better some are worse, but on average it's pretty bad.  
  
I wouldn't care if we were given the choice between dubbing and originals, but when I wanted to see the first Hobbit movie in 3D AND with original sound, I had to go to IMAX because it was the only cinema in the country which offered that.

I kind of like the German system of 75% proportional and 25% first past the post, but definitely agree that differences like this need to be resolved through systemic change (not fragmentation). 

And that's my point - I understand that various groups become frustrated over time and their frustrations are often justified. Forming new states might benefit that group but disadvantage others. It is through reform of existing governments that you solve most of these problems. I believe in fighting for change. I just don't believe in fragmentation as a viable strategy. Even those who might benefit politically could suffer in the long run - it's not easy for a small country with no history of self-government to compete. 

And no matter what your means for division, there will never be perfect separation. 

There are times when new states are justified - but those times are mostly past, the era of large empires where huge regions were ignored. 

I can't say I have an opinion about Scotland. I don't know the current degree of self-government nor the extent to which the UK government focuses only on London, as I've heard many state. It seems like a situation where increased self-government is all that's needed, but then I can't imagine the Scots abusing the English among them (by means other than words) if separation were to happen - so I guess either result seems like not a big deal, but I've never spent much time studying that area of the world.

true,votapmen,SRPS,Република Српска — Republika Srpska,"&gt;That's wrong. Nothing is declared a thread and punished. Certain things are restricted or outlawed and only those who then use it are prosecuted for it. 

That’s the same thing. You ban something. If someone does it, he gets prosecuted. That’s how law works.

&gt;In Germany the Grundgesetz or Basic Law (i.e. constitution in everything but name) already gives everybody unlimited freedom of speech so long as it is within the bounds of the law.

It’s not “unlimited freedom of speech” if it’s limited.

&gt;The symbols like swastika are prohibited because they are considered a party symbol and propaganda for parties that are outlawed (due to not conforming to the constitution in their goals) cannot be used for PROPAGANDA purposes. It's not outlawed in most other cases.

I believe that no party should be outlawed, even if it’s a Nazi party. As I said previously, I would have supported a moratorium on such parties for a period 50 years after the WWII, but in a true democracy people are able to choose which party they’ll support, even if such party is undemocratic or anti-democratic.

&gt;There really are very few other exceptions to free speech other than libel, youth protection and conforming to some other laws in a similar vein.

I do fully support outlawing libel and protecting the youth.

&gt;That's not the definition of democracy at all

I’m not saying that's the definition of democracy, but rather the idea behind it. 

&gt;(here is one: ""a system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.""). Just how it usually plays out. Direct Democracy (everybody discusses and votes on every issue) like that doesn't exist in most countries, they vote for people to represent them. In Germany that's the Bundestag, and they vote on what they consider to be the right choice in these matters.

Exactly — *whole population*. But in this case, this principle is broken because certain parts of population don’t have the right to participate in governing themselves and choosing representatives ‘they consider to be the right choice’, specifically Nazis, fascists and as you mention further on, even communists and monarchists.

&gt;You can, so long as it doesn't endanger minors, uses propaganda for outlawed parties etc. etc.

Again, I agree with protecting the youth, but not with the second part.

&gt;What you cannot do is go against certain articles in the Basic Law, such as the fact that Germany is a democratic Republic. You cannot form a monarchist party or a party trying to implement communist dictatorship.

It’s undemocratic to disallow the right of the population to vote themselves out of democracy. That may be a paradox of democracy, but a beautiful one at that.

&gt;What you can do is propose a new Basic Law system or attempt to change it (which requires a 66% majority vote and happens once in a blue moon).

Again, this is undemocratic. The parties in power don’t have any incentive to jeopardize they’re seats in the Parliament by spreading the spectrum of parties you can vote for. And parties that have the incentive to do so, are outlawed and cannot present their program to the population which might accept it. So, it’s undemocratic towards the parties that are outlawed and it’s undemocratic towards the population which doesn’t have the full choice in deciding who governs it.

&gt;All of which are horrible straw man arguments that are really neat in theory but still really stupid. Here is a ""little thought experiment"" experiment (read: straw man bs that doesn't have anything to do with reality) about unlimited free speech.

I really fail to see what is wrong or far-fetched with the scenarios I laid out.

&gt; 1. I call up the police and tell them I planted a bomb in a local school. It's cool though, just expressing my opinion. 
&gt; 2. I am called to court. Of course I claim he did it. I don't like his hair cut, so I want him to go to prison for something. Not like they can bring me up on perjury charges, it's just my opinion that he did it. 
&gt;3. Allergic against peanuts? Yeah our ""Freshly fried peanut chips"" don't contain any. At least in my opinion they don't. 
&gt;4. Sometimes I just like to yell ""Fire!"" for fun. Oh yeah, that's just an opinion I happen to have. 

You are obviously mixing *opinions* with *facts* and their distortions.

Saying you planted a bomb is not an opinion, it’s (endangering the public safety through) misrepresenting the facts, i.e. lying. Committing perjury in this case is worse than libel, which I said I’m against. It is not your opinion, it is you lying and endangering someones wellbeing, image and livelihood by doing so.

The same goes for peanut-butter and yelling fire. You're not stating your opinion, you’re putting others’ wellbeing and life at risk *by lying*.

&gt;Yeah. Well, everybody does that already. Certain things (e.g. nazi propaganda) are banned to protect those that cannot protect themselves (e.g. minors), but they are far and few between and that's it

Again, directing *any* form of political propaganda towards minors (and even commercial advertising towards children), I believe, should be outlawed.",0,1410613308,null,0,false,0,ckh42p0,t3_2g701b,t1_ckh42p0,t1_ckh2ar2,null,1427034808,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt;*The pope began his brief visit to northern Italy by first praying in a nearby, separate cemetery for some 15,000 soldiers from five nations of the Austro-Hungarian empire which were on the losing side of the Great War that broke out 100 years ago.*

&gt;*""War is madness,"" he said in his homily before the massive, sloping granite memorial, made of 22 steps on the side of hill with three crosses at the top.*

&gt;*""Even today, after the second failure of another world war, perhaps one can speak of a third war, one fought piecemeal, with crimes, massacres, destruction,"" he said.*

&gt;*In the past few months, Francis has made repeated appeals for an end to conflicts in Ukraine, Iraq, Syria, Gaza and parts of Africa.*

Having no dubbing in TV program enables children to accept langue as natural extension to their native language.

In France, where the Joinville studio was converted into a dubbing center, the supremacy of dubbing derives from the nation's cultural mission to preserve and protect the French language in the face of foreign (especially American) influence, and the prevalence of French as the lingua franca for a populace accustomed to hearing it in its own films. For the other countries of the FIGS group, culture and political ideology were determining causes.

So the producers send people watching the dubbing process because it is so important for them, and as foreigners they give false indications to the actors, wrong intonations or accentuations of phrases, or insist that some jokes or concepts are translated word for word or in a very old fashioned way (such as university positions such as assistants or lecturers,  which have been reformed in France in 1968, etc).

true,strozzapreti,null,null,"**War + Bases = $** 

The freedom with which the U.S. military used its Italian bases in the Iraq War is a case in point. As a start, the Italian government allowed U.S. forces to employ them even though their use for a war pursued outside the context of NATO may violate the terms of the 1954 basing agreement. A classified May 2003 cable sent by U.S. Ambassador to Italy Melvin Sembler and released by WikiLeaks shows that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s government gave the Pentagon “virtually everything” it wanted. “We got what we asked for,” wrote Sembler, “on base access, transit, and overflights, ensuring that forces... could flow smoothly through Italy to get to the fight.”

For its part, Italy appears to have benefited directly from this cooperation. (Some say that shifting bases from Germany to Italy was also meant as a way to punish Germany for its lack of support for the Iraq War.) According to a 2010 report from Jane’s Sentinel Security Assessment, “Italy’s role in the war in Iraq, providing 3,000 troops to the U.S.-led effort, opened up Iraqi reconstruction contracts to Italian firms, as well as cementing relations between the two allies.” Its role in the Afghan War surely offered similar benefits. Such opportunities came amid deepening economic troubles, and at a moment when the Italian government was turning to arms production as a major way to revive its economy. According to Jane’s, Italian weapons manufacturers like Finmeccanica have aggressively tried to enter the U.S. and other markets. In 2009, Italian arms exports were up more than 60%.

In October 2008, the two countries renewed a Reciprocal Defense Procurement Memorandum of Understanding (a “most favored nation” agreement for military sales). It has been suggested that the Italian government may have turned Dal Molin over to the U.S. military -- for free -- in part to ensure itself a prominent role in the production of “the most expensive weapon ever built,” the F-35 fighter jet, among other military deals. Another glowing 2009 cable, this time from the Rome embassy’s Chargé d'Affaires Elizabeth Dibble, called the countries’ military cooperation “an enduring partnership.” It noted pointedly how Finmeccanica (which is 30% state-owned) “sold USD 2.3 billion in defense equipment to the U.S. in 2008 [and] has a strong stake in the solidity of the U.S.-Italy relationship.”

Of course, there’s another relevant factor in the Pentagon’s Italian build-up. For the same reasons American tourists flock to the country, U.S. troops have long enjoyed la dolce vita there. In addition to the comfortable living on suburban-style bases, around 40,000 military visitors a year from across Europe and beyond come to Camp Darby’s military resort and “American beach” on the Italian Riviera, making the country even more attractive.

**The Costs of the Pentagon’s Pivots**

Italy is not about to take Germany’s place as the foundation of U.S. military power in Europe. Germany has long been deeply integrated into the U.S. military system, and military planners have designed it to stay that way. In fact, remember how the Pentagon convinced Congress to hand over $600 million for a new base and related construction in Vicenza? The Pentagon’s justification for the new base was the Army’s need to bring troops from Germany to Vicenza to consolidate the 173rd brigade in one place.

And then, last March, one week after getting access to the first completed building at Dal Molin and with construction nearly finished, the Army announced that it wouldn’t be consolidating the brigade after all. One-third of the brigade would remain in Germany. At a time when budget cuts, unemployment, and economic stagnation for all but the wealthiest have left vast unmet needs in communities around the United States, for our $600 million investment, a mere 1,000 troops will move to Vicenza.

Even with those troops staying in Germany, Italy is fast becoming one of several new pivot points for U.S. warmaking powers globally. While much attention has been focused on President Obama’s “Asia pivot,” the Pentagon is concentrating its forces at bases that represent a series of pivots in places like Djibouti on the horn of Africa and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, Bahrain and Qatar in the Persian Gulf, Bulgaria and Romania in Eastern Europe, Australia, Guam, and Hawai’i in the Pacific, and Honduras in Central America.

Our bases in Italy are making it easier to pursue new wars and military interventions in conflicts about which we know little, from Africa to the Middle East. Unless we question why we still have bases in Italy and dozens more countries like it worldwide -- as, encouragingly, growing numbers of politicians, journalists, and others are doing -- those bases will help lead us, in the name of American “security,” down a path of perpetual violence, perpetual war, and perpetual insecurity.

Io vado tutti gli anni per le prove (consecutivamente da 5 anni, credo). Abbiamo provato un po' tutte le posizioni: prima e seconda variante, ascari e, quest'anno abbiamo optato per le tribune centrali di fronte all'uscita dei pit.
Due anni fa abbiamo avuto addirittura in omaggio due posti all'ospitality per il giorno della gara, con hostess (gnocchissime) che ti accompagnano al posto riservato (proprio sulla linea di partenza), ti offrono aperitivo con prosciuttino crudo tagliato vicino all'osso, ti permettono di fare il walkabout ai box e, prima della partenza, ti servono un pranzettino gustoso. Giusto per dire che il karma esiste, quel giorno ero seduto di fianco ad un tifoso sfegatato della McLaren (sob!).   
A parte questa esperienza extralusso, tutte le posizioni sono carine e ragalano emozioni. Trovo comunque sempre molto bello, più che guardare i bolidi sfrecciare in pista, andare a girare per il parco e constatare che ancora esistono tanti altri appassionati come me.  
Per quest'anno, menzione d'onore per 5 vichinghi che indossavano tutti zoccoli di legno dipinti di rosso con il cavallino rampante sopra (!!!).

&gt; Ad Ottobre se non sbaglio replicano la giornata ACI, con diversi campionati molto interessanti, tra cui il campionato GT Italiano, ero andato a Giugno, ingresso 5 euro o forse era gratuito, non ricordo, consigliatissimo, mattina in prima variante, pomeriggio in Ascari, tanto spettacolo, purtroppo non sono riuscito a portar via le slick consumate dai paddock, le regalavano, ma quando siamo andati per prenderne qualcuna, erano finite ahhaha. 

Peccato!

1) the public was already so used to dubbing of foreign films, especially after the war, that Italian filmmakers figured it wasn't worth it to record sound directly (in particular for films in the Neorealist tradition which were shot outside studio locations). After a while, it just became standard practice.    
All dialogue was done in post-production, usually by the same actors that you saw on screen but not necessarily. This also allowed for last-minute changes in the script if they were needed, so that sometimes the words spoken didn't match the movement of the lips in some older films.

2) International distribution. The European cinema industry in the '60s and '70s was much more intertwined than it is today. Lots and lots of co-productions between French, Italian, Spanish studios. Because of dubbing, actors weren't restricted to work in just their country; sometimes films had an international cast of people who spoke three or four different languages (Leone's westerns are notorious for this).

Notice that Italy wasn't the only one doing this. Spain's first film with natural sound was, I think, *El espíritu de la colmena* in 1973, and people protested because they couldn't hear what was being said (they tend to whisper a lot in that film).",0,1410622760,null,0,1410622953,0,ckh779t,t3_2ga4ox,t1_ckh779t,t1_ckh6kio,null,1427033011,14,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,14

1) Pas forcément. Tu peux sans doute réduire le déficit public (en tant que budget utile à l'état) à zéro, si le remboursement de la dette est inférieur à la charge de la dette, la dette augmente mécaniquement, même sans déficit. 

C'est le principe du surendettement avec les crédits rechargeables, où des gens se retrouvent à rembourser plusieurs fois la dette originale. 
La France est un peu dans ce scénario, la dette française ayant déjà été remboursée une fois, mais les intérêts cumulés constituent aujourd'hui l'ensemble de la dette.

2)Les 'experts' pensent aujourd'hui avoir sous estimé le levier de l'investissement public (dit 'keynésien', mais c'est aujourd'hui un gros mot, synonyme de 'Gauchisse'), provoquant la récession.

&gt; Sauf que, la dépense publique est l'une des plus élevées du monde, et la pression fiscale est également l'une des plus élevées du monde

Je n'en suis pas certain. Pour la dépense publique, jette un oeil à ce [document de l'OCDE](http://www.ofce.sciences-po.fr/blog/les-depenses-publiques-en-france-en-fait-on-trop/) , loin d'être un repère de gauchistes. 
Pour la pression fiscale, ça dépend si on inclut les cotisations (ce que ne font pas forcément les autres pays).

 4) Tu as en partie raison, les dépenses doivent bien sûr être contrôlées, mais la dépense publique hors social a diminué en 30 ans. Dans quoi tailler désormais?

Sometimes there is only one Russian actor to dub some famous actors, e.g. Kuznetsov is the voice of Keanu Reeves, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, sometimes Johnny Depp (sorry if I've misspelled names). 
That's why we often don't understand your love to some actors - we don't have a chance to actually hear their voice.

TV show and series are mostly mvo, voiceovers. There are some professional studios, like Lostfilm, and sometimes it's Kuraj Bambey - that monotonous strange voice from TBB, HIMYM and other series. Well, it's at least something, and he tries to translate and convey most of the puns and culture jokes. As for the voice itself... I recommend you to search ""Кураж Бамбей"" on YouTube. There's a lot of RWJ in Russian made by him.

You know what's also annoying (at least to me) is when you're reading subtitles and what they're about to say is printed a few moments before they actually say it, so you lose some of the dramatic impact of the delivery.  It's like reading through a script a few seconds before the actors say the lines. It feels a whole lot less spontaneous. And no matter how damn fast a speed-reader you are, that's time you're not studying the rest of the frame. Because there's a whole lot more to film than what the actors are saying.

I'm just saying, both dubbing and subtitles involve artistic compromise.

If the creators intended for a running script to be in the frame, they would have put it in the original.  So it's a compromise; it literally compromises part of the visual frame by covering it up with text. Perhaps minor compared to the compromise of replacing the dialog performances, but they are clearly both compromises. Again, I'm shocked that people might have different preferences regarding artistic compromises!

Also, what about creators who intended to release dubbed versions? I'm imagining this group of directors being held hostage here forced to release dubbed versions by unwashed proletarian scum who don't go to the cinema to read a novel.
