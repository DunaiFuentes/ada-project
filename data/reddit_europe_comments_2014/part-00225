The government's scope of negotiation is limited because it wants to attract foreign investment. Therefore, it has to make an offer that is interesting to the foreign investor. For a manufacturer to set up shop abroad, it doesn't make sense if he has to pay high wages. For example, Volkswagen pays it workers in the US about half of what it pays its workers at home, even though the US isn't a low-wage country. Of course, they also do some R&amp;D abroad to tap local talent, but the bulk of R&amp;D together with the high-value items typically stays at home.

So instead, males are being bombarded with protein shakes and fitness ads starring obscenely good-looking men - feeding our want of confidence and physical beauty and making money off of it, the same way other entrepreneurs can make money off of the female want of confidence and physical beauty.

So etwas saugt man sich aus den Fingern, wenn man Position beziehen will, ohne dabei Position beziehen zu müssen.  Wann haben die IDF denn je von Angriffen abgesehen, nur weil israelische Zivilisten dabei in Gefahr hätten geraten können?  Gibt es Präzedenzfälle?  Mir sind keine bekannt, aber vielleicht weißt Du da ja mehr.

Aber gehen wir doch einmal in Gedanken durch, unter welchen Umständen ein solches Szenario realistisch wäre:

1. Kampfhandlungen finden in israelischen, von Zivilisten bewohnten Gebieten statt, und diese konnten nicht rechtzeitig evakuiert werden.  Würden die IDF hier den Tod eigener Zivilisten in Kauf nehmen, wenn es militärisch notwendig wäre?  Wahrscheinlich schon, denn es nicht zu tun, käme einer Kapitulation gleich. Ich würde es tun.
2. Israelische Friedensaktivisten lassen sich mit ihren Kindern in Gaza freiwillig als menschliche Schutzschilde einspannen^1.  Würden die IDF die von ihnen versehenen Stellungen angreifen, wenn dies militärisch notwendig wäre?  Ich bin mir ziemlich sicher, dass sie es nach Warnschüssen tun würden. Ich würde es tun.

Der Grund dafür, dass solche Szenarien lediglich hypothetischer Natur sind, ist, dass die Israelis den Schutz ihrer Zivilisten ernst nehmen, während die Strategie der Hamas darauf gründet, so viele palästinensische Kinderleichen wie möglich in die Kameraobjektive der Photographen und Kameraleute halten zu können, damit intellektuell minderbemittelte Menschen sich darüber entsetzen und als Reaktion öffentlichen Druck auf Israel aufbauen.  Leute wie Du sind der Beweis dafür, dass diese bösartige, perfide Strategie eine ziemlich wirksame ist.  Dein Unwille zur Differenzierung stellt Dich unweigerlich auf die Seite der Hamas, und da hilft auch Dein Verweis auf die Subjektivität des eigenen Urteils Dir nicht heraus.  Du bist Teil der Manövriermasse der Hamas.

Additionally, the wording is pretty clear: by stating other members of christian churches can join they implicitly state only christians can join. This is underlined by the reference to Ökumene, which, even with your weired attempts to redefine set meanings, still only means one thing in a religious context: there is catholics, who agree that the pope has jurisdiction over them and other christians, who dont agree that the pope has jurisdiction over them. Ökumene is directed at all but catholic christians. And before you keep on making up bullshit: the term christian is defined. And it is defined in way, that you cannot be muslim at the same time.

I know a worryingly significant number of people can't tell the difference between being Jewish and supporting Israel's actions. And I know Israel is significantly more impopular among muslim circles.

BUT, some people seem to believe France has become a hell hole for Jews, and that because of Islam France is basically Nazi Germany all over again. This event is used as a proof. Well, here's what happened on that day.

There was a demonstration to support Palestine. On the same day, the synagogue of rue de la Roquette had organised a prayer event for peace in Israel. It is still not clear how/when it happened, but a group called the [Jewish Defense League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Defense_League) considered the pro-Palestine demonstration was attacking the synagogue they had to protect, and what you can see in the video is not random people being attacked because they are Jews, it's just a bunch of assholes. Obviously, those among the pro-Palestinians who responded are a bunch of assholes too. Then you can see the LDJ guys running behind the riot police, and the rest is what logically should happen.

For those interested, at the beginning they're yelling ""Palestine on t'encule"", which intelligent people should not do...

All of these people are idiots, and I don't even want to have to say who I root for, because fuck it, I despise violence whoever commits it. But I'd like people to know it's not just a ""bad vs good"" problem, or else it would be much easier to solve.

He also reminds, at the end, that they have excellent relations with their muslim neighbours in the area, and the imam of the neighbouring mosque condemned the violence (that's for the dickheads in the other topic saying muslims never condemn other muslim's violence).

true,europeanfederalist,EURO,The Flemish Empire,"'No, I haven't said anything about ""explaining"" an overrepresentation. That is an extremely complex task that is related to an infinity of factors, some economical, some social, some related to other aspects. What I'm saying is that if one group is overrepresented in crime, then the desirable outcome should just be that group having more individuals who face consequences (because that desirable outcome is that criminals, and only them, pay for their crimes).'

I knew I misunderstood because what I thought was your explanation was extremely simplistic. I'm happy that I was wrong.

'However, I disagree completely with discrimination being OK, as that amounts to people paying for other people's actions, and it's the radical opposite of justice in my opinion. When you make life more difficult for a subset of people because some others who share an arbitrary trait with them have infringed the law, then you make that collective (rightly) feel marginalized, and you are more likely to create bigger tensions that will result in more crime.'

Either way they're paying for other people's actions. Whether the government profiles them or not, the public will have negative views towards an entire community. It seems logical to me that if for example an overwhelming amount of car theft in Paris is on the hands of someone with Moroccan roots, the police should focus (not exclusively) on that group. Individual police officers will do it automatically whether the government permits them to do it or not, so it would be better if it is within a legal framework.

Profiling is everywhere! You do not see the government focusing on average middle class people when it comes to off-shore tax shelters for example. The only place where it isn't applied is in our criminal (prevention) system.

'I strongly support the idea that every citizen in a country (including people who were immigrants but could eventually become citizens) should have the same rights and obligations. If someone doesn't speak the language correctly, then they will be at a disadvantage when looking for jobs outside of their community; if someone is plotting a terrorist attack, then they will go to prison if they are caught by the police. No discrimination is necessary.'

Citizens should have the same rights and obligation, until one proves not worthy of that citizenship.  

We're talking about Europe here: We have a social security system. The fact that so many people chose not to learn the language proves that learning it doesn't benefit them (or so they think). 


Terrorist attack: No, they should denounce his citizenship if he has a dual one.

There is hardly a consensus, and the matter gets entangled with anything ghetto. In fact, a lot of people will likely think it was mostly a Jewish uprising with some sympathizing Polish running around there. 

Was it a good thing? Actually, I do think it was the same you saw in Iraq, ca. 2004-2007: a grassroots ""terrorist""  (in fact, the Wehrmacht used that exact word to describe it) situation doing asymmetrical warfare against a massively militarily superior foe.

true,meidei,ANAR,isyanάσταση!,"To echo some of the other users here, it's important to acknowledge what happened, it's important to punish those who committed the atrocities if they are still alive (some conflicts aren't that old you know), and stop glorifying those events. This is how you forgive. 

Now, as someone who lives in Cyprus, this is not abstract to me. My grandparents were alive when Greek nationalists under the flag of ""anti-colonialism"" were killing Turkish nationalists and viceversa (and my grandparents were communists so they were hated by both nationalist movements). They were also alive when Greek nationalists began attacking Turkish neighbourhoods in such scale that Cypriot Turks become refugees in 1963. They lived in crowded enclaves without basic amenities for a decade. 

My parents were alive when Greek nationalists staged a coup accepting that many will die, but ""at least we will be reunited with Greece"". They were alive (barely, as their home was nearly hit by warplanes) when Turkey used the coup as an excuse to invade  and force a population exchange. My whole become refugees in 1974. Some of them to Sweden, UK and Australia. Others lived in refugee camps out in the open until some ""abandoned"" Turkish Cypriot property was allocated to them. 

You cannot forgive and move forwards if you deny that those things happened and at the same time honour the sick bastards who committed them, when you find excuses for the ""innocent people"" who supported them then. If you admit the atrocities your kingroup committed, and do not glorify or excuse them, then you have nothing to be guilty about.

[Czech source](http://www.parlamentnilisty.cz/arena/monitor/Ohromna-ostuda-rekl-knize-k-veci-ktera-trapi-Romy-A-Ransdorf-mu-pripomnel-tuto-nehezkou-vec-z-minulosti-329210) (in the middle of the page, starts with *Pokud jde o Lety ...*). 

My translation:

&gt; Regarding Lety we should make clear what we want to build there. The myth about gypsy camp is according to available information a lie.  It was a work camp for people who avoided work duty and included also Czechs and Germans from the Protectorate [of Bohemia and Moravia]. People were not locked in because of their ethnicity but because of gyspy way of life, meaning that those Roma who worked weren't in. The guards until almost the very end of the camp were not equipped with arms and the camp commander took his maid and likely also mistress to a picture theatre. Nobody was murdered in the camp, people died by old age and to diseases which they brought in and contracted before due to nomadic style of life. The major problem was the commander who was beating the inmates and hid the poor state of the camp from higher authorities; he was eventually recalled and medical aid was send to the camp. The camp victims were in no case victims of holocaust. Any comparison is disrespect to the real victims of holocaust, be they Roma or Jews, in real concentration camps. By all means I condemn and criticize any violence on people, said Tomio Okamura, leader of party Úsvit and MP.

No, a sign of recession is deflation (negative inflation). That's what we got here in Portugal for years now. But I see what you mean.

Admiting guilt is a part of making sure that things like that won't happen again and keeping nationalism in check. I don't think that making students a bit uneasy during history lessons is a big price to pay.

Also I don't think that Mongolian example is a good one, not only due to sheer amount of.time that has passed, but due to circumstances being completly different. Same goes for most medieval events.

When it comes to more modern times things change dramatically - Armenians are still in Turks' arm's reach, Poles are still living next to Germans, Ukrainians and Czechs and all that history is neither forgotten nor an effect of circumstances that are long gone.

National identity is a real thing, and when nation refuses to accept that parts of.it's history are badmit is very likely that children.will be thought in a way that will make another go at those things possible.

As far as I see it those are two separate issues. The first is that the goods we export aid the suppression of opposition movements (whether or not they're all that democratic is a whole other can of worms. Let's leave it closed, please). IMHO that would only be the case if they were strong enough to pose an existential threat to the Saud regime. In that case, the quality of arms the state possesses might make a difference. For the small-scale clashes during the Arab spring it doesn't. Whether Saudi security forces were armed with high-tech German SMGs and assault rifles or cheap AK47 knock offs would have had zero impact on the outcome of the protests.

And it's not like the Saudis import western arms for those purposes. They import them for the same reason everyone else does: to deter potential foreign threats, like Iran and Syria. And everyone, from the west to the other powers in the region has a vital interest to ensure that they stay deterred. 

The other issue is whether we should trade with countries with bad human rights records at all. Well, if we didn't, we also shouldn't trade with China for example. And I'd argue that trade, and the middle class  that goes along with it, is the main reason why human rights have ever so slowly been gaining ground there.

true,austinhuebner,advanced-english,advanced (native English),"I may be wrong, as I'm not fluent in German, but I think you misunderstood the meaning of *sein + zu + Infinitiv*. At least according to *Erkundungen: Deutsch als Fremdsprache* a textbook that I bought for my previous German class, *sein + zu + Infinitiv* is a *Passiversatzkonstruktion*. Now, I'm not sure exactly what that means myself, but the original sentence ""Die Hausaufgaben sind nicht einzureichen"" would then be equivalent to *Die Hausaufgaben sind nicht einreichbar* The homework is not submittable? The other, more valid way to say this is *Die Hausaufgaben lassen sich nicht einreichen*, and normally Germans use this when adding *-bar/-lich* (-able) doesn't make any sense, which may be this case for einreichen. These two forms can be simplified into plain passive as *Die Hausaufgaben können nicht eingereicht werden.*, meaning ""The homework can not be submitted."" But, also according to this textbook, *sein + zu + Infinitiv* can also be used as a command as well or to express ""must"". 

So that's really confusing. You can find another explanation of this at this [website!](http://www.mein-deutschbuch.de/lernen.php?menu_id=115)

Unfortunately, this does not say anything about *haben + zu + Infinitiv*, and I really don't know why this would be preferred. I have heard it used before, however. When you use *haben + zu + Infinitiv*, it's likely just same meaning as *haben* would have with a noun, but instead with a verb. (I have **something**, I have **to do something**) This happens to also express the idea of ""must"", and has a similar meaning to the passive construction before. This may not sound right to a German, but I think you could say *Passagiere sind sich bei dem Flugbegleiter zu melden*, but it would have the meaning *Passagiere können sich bei dem Flugbegleiter gemeldet werden* instead of the command form that I talked about before.

TL;DR German is super confusing. There are three ways to say ""The homework can not be submitted"", one of which uses *zu + sein + Infinitiv*. This, in turn, might be why you can't use *zu + sein + Infinitiv* with the second sentence, because it may be confused with passive. Or something.

I have these events referenced in a book, but I don't have access to the actual source for these claims - serbian newspapers from the time and just looking at papers *Većernje novosti* and *Politika* from these dates should clear these matters a bit.

That's why they were conquered so easily and could barely resist. It's not even remotely similar to modern-day immigration, which goes the other way around, unless Lithuania has a huge influx of immigrants from northern Europe and North America pushing people out of their homes?

And as for how you decide who is let in: you simply create a set of basic standards that you expect all potential immigrants to meet. This is what the US and Canada do (although lots of Mexicans illegally enter anyway) and it works quite well. For example, in the US, there is the lottery system (which anyone can get provided they get lucky and aren't associated with any flagged organisations or ideologies), there are special skills VISAs for engineers, scientists, doctors, musicians, athletes, etc., and there are temporary work VISAs for unskilled labour as necessary (which they accept from Mexico, as opposed to the Middle East or other societies where people do not integrate well).

So the end result is that some immigrants are more traditionally poor and unskilled, but they come from the entire world rather than one place so they have a much greater need to assimilate, and a roughly equal number are the highly-skilled, well-educated ""elites"" of their home countries (mostly Indians and Chinese scientists/engineers, they make up the #2 and #3 source countries of immigrants). Many Europeans and Russians also fit in here. Then there's the small number of extremely wealthy people who invested a certain amount in US assets, which let them acquire legal permanent residence.

The whole system works so much better than Europe's, which as far as I can tell involves letting x number of people in every year and ignoring the massive number who enter illegally from volatile places. And those x number who we lawfully invite aren't screened for any particular skills at all, so they end up making up the lowest rungs of our society.

[Take a look at the US's socioeconomic groups:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_United_States_by_household_income) immigrants and their children are at the top. The richest demographic in the US are Indian Americans, followed by South African, Filipino, Taiwanese, Russians, Latvians, Iranians, Lebanese, Chinese, Fijian, Japanese, Sri Lankan etc. all with higher average incomes than native-born white Americans. In other words, immigrants to the US pay far *more* into the system than they take out and they add a huge amount to the economy -- not to mention they do extremely well and don't end up in slums. And remember, nonwhite immigration was mostly banned until 1964, so these achievements are all very recent. 

This makes for a much more racially cohesive society too -- I've lived here for a few years now and not once has there been a race riot as far as I'm aware and immigrants' children are extremely well integrated. When I go to the cinema, I don't just see groups of Indian kids by themselves, Iranians in another group, etc. but rather everyone mixed in together, probably because they grew up together rather than in homogenous places. By contrast parts of London don't even look British at all.

Immigration is one of those things we really fucked up on and should look at NA for a better system.

There are also some Muslims from other countries, including Pakistan and South Asian countries, but their not numerous and they get along with other communities from their region, like Chinese and Indian immigrants (edit: as incredible as it may seem). 

In total there are about 40k Muslims in Portugal according to the 2011 Census. There are possibly more, since the Census only gathered information about 85% of the population or so, and people aren't forced to reveal their religion. 40K people is much easier to manage than millions of people like in France.

Also, Portugal isn't a country of chauvinists and Muslims in Portugal come from multi-religious countries that are familiar with Portuguese culture. There are also many Portuguese people who have lived in those countries who now live and have families in Portugal. Basically it's a great recipe for a well-paced integration.

France on the other hand, like the UK or Germany to name but a few, is a country with vocal chauvinists. Chauvinism transpires to the media (including entertainment) and everyday interactions and makes immigrants feel threatened by prejudice. 

And to make things worse, Muslim immigrants in France come from Muslim countries that are religiously and culturally homogenous (and some are even riddled with religious extremism, violence and/or political ideologies). They're chauvinists too, to make it simple.

Notably their anti-clerical efforts are pretty heineous. Another is their neoconservative tendencies against social injustice or the poor-wealthy gap.

The [Muslim Brotherhood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood) is another one, who promote [Qutbism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutbism). It's virtually a jihadist movement to advance Islam across the board. They're pro-Sharia, anti-social democracy, conspiracy theorist, and all sorts of insanity in a can. Oh, and in tradition they're anti-West and anti-Semitic.

Now, there's always extreme sects in the Islamic world. This would be similar to a second Crusade as more Muslims practice these anti-West or anti-left ideologies. They're really not happy with the West due to the colonial era.

There's plenty of Muslims who are moderate or liberal. It tends to mellow out the longer they're exposed to Western culture. The issue is self-segregation of certain people that cause some of the issues we see. They don't want Western culture, they want to keep theirs while disrespecting the nation.

Though this is generalized due to its diversity, the [Ahmadiyaa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmadiyya) are a point. Some of their beliefs are peaceful preaching if their views of Islam. Notably they consider the Jihad to be spread by the pen and not the word. Another part has multiple definitions of Jihad, most of which are peaceful sans one: *Jihad al-Asghar*, which preaches self-defense if your right to worship is being persecuted to an extreme. The worst you might find is them being a bit too pushy in their religion, but they won't scream at you.

The thing is that it's not the religion that defines them, but the sect. The more Western a Muslim becomes, the more secular and 'irreligous' they become. It's a matter of *where* they immigrated from you need to factor in.

""Ich lese nicht viele Bücher"" -- here you are negating ""viele"", so the sense is ""I read not many books"". In English we say: ""I don't read many books.""

""Ich lese viele Bücher nicht"" -- here you are negating the verb. Now what you are saying is that there are many books which you refuse to read. You could still be a veritable bookworm, it's just there are large numbers of books you *don't* read. This is hard to express very simply in English, but the usual form is: ""There are many books I don't read.""

Another example:

Er hat das Buch nicht gelesen. = He hasn't read the book (so he doesn't know how the story ends -- please don't spoil it for him).

Er hat nicht *das* Buch gelesen. = He didn't read *that* book (it was a different book he read).

Mentre ho un ricordo nettissimo dell'annuncio del rapimento di Moro, le mie memorie del 1980 sono più ricche di eventi personali.

Ricordo, però, che alla mia maniera - intuitiva, immediata, da adolescente - avevo la sensazione che il mondo delle regole degli adulti mi si rivelasse come una gigantesca commedia, ridicola, spregevole e spaventosa. Il mondo rassicurante dei miei genitori: cattolicesimo, DC, lavoro in banca, l'essere ""per bene"", io lo percepivo come un mondo di falsa informazione e diseguaglianza, dove i potenti avevano la maschera del Tartufo di Dario Fo, maschera che peraltro poco nascondeva della loro mediocrità, e dove i fascisti ed i criminali uccidevano liberamente e lo Stato si affannava a coprire, in un gioco di ragioni disumane ed incomprensibili. E giù giù fino all'usciere dell'inps, tutti coloro che concorrevano a mantenere in piedi questa messinscena di normalità erano complici per un cocktail di convenienza, ignoranza e vigliaccheria.

Come vedi, molto sturm und drang, molta adolescenza. Il punto è che crescendo per oltre tre decenni ho scoperto molte regioni di bellezza, armonia e piacere in me, nel mio Paese e nel mondo in cui vivo: ma l'essenza della visione di allora si è arricchita di esperienze, riflessioni, conoscenze e dettagli, ma non è cambiata di molto.

Your assessment that there is ""one base word"" in English is false, as my reply demonstrated -- and interestingly, my reply contained an Americanism and and Anglicism, as a way of pointing out that there even regional differences (as there mostly likely are in other languages, of course).

That there are translators who will translate, for example, the various different Russian swear words as ""fuck"" or variants thereof is just proof that there are some lazy and unimaginative translators out there. You just have to go through all the insulting terms the English language has to describe a man: dickhead, asshole/arsehole, twat, cunt, wanker, cocksucker, motherfucker -- all offensive, all but one referring to sex or the genitals, all very commonly used.

As a way of qualifying other words, we have a whole range of obscenities to choose from, not just ""fucking"", but a range of terms starting with the very mild ""damn"" up to and including the highly offensive ""mother-fucking"". We have qualifiers like ""crappy"" and ""shitty"", not to mention many terms that are best avoid because they are insulting to certain groups: ""gay"", ""lame"" and ""retarded"", for example (and these are the mild ones -- although, to be fair, all of those exist in German as well). Then you have a whole pageful of euphemisms for ""fucking"", including ""fricking"", ""freaking"", ""frigging"" and the extremely convenient Irish ""fecking"" which can be used on prime-time TV without upsetting anyone.

Je me demande ce qu'il entend par là. La france participe à la FINUL au liban qui a pour but d'instaurer une zone tampon entre le liban et Israël. Est-ce que Fabius pointe dans cette direction avec un équivalent pou gaza ? Ce serait assez osé car le bilan de la FINUL est mitigé et toute force de l'ONU à Gaza serait prise entre deux feux.

true,Traubert,FINL,Finland,"&gt;Even without digging into the the link myself, it looks like you quote the article saying essentially what I was saying about the proportion of people from different ethnic groups

&gt;&gt;In February 2012 a report was published by the Ministry of Justice providing demographic statistics of the people charged over participation the riots up to 1 February 2012 which revealed that 41% of those brought before the courts identified themselves as being from the White group, 39% from the Black ethnic group, 12% from the Mixed ethnic group, 6% the Asian ethnic group, and 2% the Other ethnic group.

&gt;It looks like I went a little too far saying that a majority of rioters were white British, but white British is quite clearly the largest ethnic group

By two percentage points, of those brought to justice, UK-wide, yes.

&gt; and comes very close to being a majority.

Well, nine percentage points away from that.

&gt;So essentially we're agreeing on both counts? The England Riots were mainly perpetrated by (to use the anti-multiculturalists' own phrase) ""native white population"" and that rioting has no inherent connection with ethnicity or culture. 

I think you have something you want to prove here, and I appreciate that you're doing it with good intentions, but overall I think it's clear that the riots were an illustration of racial and ethnic tensions in the UK. The numbers are disproportionate for one thing, but the narrative from people in London was definitely that it was originally a black riot that brought in opportunists from other groups as it spread.",0,1407222907,null,0,false,0,cjhcpi5,t3_2ckved,t1_cjhcpi5,t1_cjgyzu2,null,1435075325,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

*Saber y Ganar* ('to know and to win'). Far from annoying, Saber y Ganar has reached cult status. A small, more or less high-brow quiz show that's aired daily in the afternoons on the second public TV channel (La 2). It's been on air for over 17 years now and if you approach any random Spaniard and ask about its host, Jordi Hurtado you'll hear two things: ""*oh, yeah, the Saber y Ganar guy*"" and ""*did you know that he's immortal?*"".

Es ist ja nicht so, dass christdemokraten nur die Demokratie mit Füssen treten würden, sie können halt auch nix - siehe Mutti. Lächeln, abwarten, lügen...

Did I say that he's not allowed to comment? It's not because you think a said a certain thing, that therefore I actually said it. 
Oh is he joking? Doesn't seem that 'obvious' to me. 

'Do you mean the Chinese community in Europe? I've not once been bothered by a Chinese person. They, and other Asians, are considered among the best immigrants in the west.'

No, I'm not talking about the Chinese community here, I'm talking about Chinese in China and the various tensions between different ethnic groups there.

Since the rest of your comment was based on the assumption that I was commenting on Chinese in the West, which I wasn't, there's nothing more to reply to.

Ebenso sind täglich tausende Sozialarbeiter auf den Straßen um mit diesen Menschen in Kontakt zu treten.

Es wird dafür, dass es sich um illegale Substanzen handelt, eine **ganze** Menge getan, um Opfer eben jener Substanzen aus dem Keller zu holen. Und zu sagen die Prohibition sorgt für die Verbreitung von HIV und STIs ist ein ebensolcher Schwachsinn und nichts weiteres als verallgemeinernde Schuldzuweisung. Heroinabhängige z.B. bekommen von Ärzten, oder Helfern, welche bekannte Plätze abklappern, Spritzen, Kondome und Medizin ausgegeben.

Der ganze Kommentar ist fast copy+paste aus dem angegebenen ""Manifest"". Und dieses ""Manifest"" ist mal ziemlich dürftig und voller Strohmänner für ein solches Thema. Z.B das Thema Ausgrenzung. Diese hat natürlich damit zu tun dass es sich um illegale Substanzen handelt. Aber vielmehr damit, dass es sich um ""schädliche"" Substanzen handelt. Siehe die zunehmende ""Ausgrenzung"" von Rauchern. 

An allem was Du aufgelistet hast(Therapie, Krankheitsübertragung etc.), ist nicht die Prohibition schuld, sondern die persönlichen Entscheidungen Beteiligter. Und diese Beteiligten wissen sehr wohl welche Möglichkeiten sie haben. Deutschland als Sozialstaat und auch einzelne Kreise tun unglaublich viel für Aufklärung und Hilfe von Drogenopfern.

Ernsthaft, ""die Prohibition"" ist Schuld, ist der größte Haufen Strohmannsmüll den ich seit langem gelesen habe.

Que tu qualifies d'""âneries"" ce que je pense, témoigne de ton ""ouverture"" d'esprit. Je continue à penser ce que j'ai dit (je suis loin d'être la seule). Ton argument n'est absolument pas convaincant. Je ne dois surement pas avoir ton ""intelligence"". Et ton ""phénoménal recul"".

&gt;Ils en sont à moins de 0,1% en 1 mois

Tout va bien alors? C'est que dalle 0.1%!!! Ou est ce qu'il faut les remercier ces braves gens d'épargner ""pour l""instant"" les autres?

Parce que, si je sais encore faire des calculs, et si on suppose qu'il s'agisse de la population française, ça nous ferait,(0.1%) 650000 personnes, c'est rien du tout, pas vrai?

&gt; Et si tu veux relativiser, 51 000 enfants de moins de cinq ans meurent tous les jours ...

Je n'ai absolument pas envie de relativiser. Qu'un gamin meure en Afrique ou ailleurs par malnutrition, ou par manque de vaccin, c'est une chose, (horrible certes) c'en est une autre quand une armée puissante DÉCIDE de lui ôter la vie, de façon brutale, violente. Dans un cas, c'est la nature qui frappe, sans que les autres humains ne prêtent secours, dans l'autres c'est l'humain lui même, qui apporte le coup de ""grâce"". C'est complètement différent.


Sur le reste de ton commentaires, qu'il y ait des morts à coté, ne change rien à la situation. Si tu es blasé de la guerre au point de ne plus donner de valeur à la vie humaine, à être là à évaluer les pourcentage, dans une logique comptable, je ne pense pas, en effet, que tu arriveras un jour à condamner les bombardements qui tuent femmes ou enfants. Il faut un peu d’empathie pour ça...

It was definitely biggest, but we were economically (measured in GDP PPP per capita) ranked as we are now. Less developed than all the West, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, a bit behind Poland and Greece, about the same as Bulgaria and ahead of Albania. 

&gt; we were democratic (sort of)

Before WWI, we were an oligarchy (literally), having censitary suffrage. Also, some minorities (especially the sizeable Jewish community) were not given citizenship at all, despite all the protests from the West.

After WWII, we had male suffrage (women, along with some social categories, such as military men, were not allowed to vote), but it was more of an *illiberal democracy*. The law banned some ideologies (for instance, ""spreading communist propaganda"" was legally punished by death) and the elections were typically shockingly corrupt and full of fraud.

Great point. I'd like to add a few observations to this statement. 

In the '50s, Romania experienced the good kind of communism. There was real progress, the country was recouping nicely from the war. Unfortunately, that didn't last very long. 

In the 1860s-1870s there was a lot of progress as well. There were lots of reforms which brought us in line with the rest of Europe. A kind of modernization, if you will. However, lots of people confuse that modernization period with the golden age of the 19th century. It wasn't so. The age of stability and growth was actually from the late '70s to 1914. That was the period when Romania experienced an extreme economical, social and cultural growth. 


And, of course, as you said, the 1920s and the 1930s were by far the best period of our history. ",0,1407235696,null,0,false,0,cjhfcmb,t3_2coayb,t1_cjhfcmb,t1_cjhet5v,null,1435076634,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Well...

&gt; ""Several members of KKK groups were convicted of murder in the deaths of civil rights workers and children in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham.""

But nevertheless, they live in a stable country that can put out way more firepower than they can should they start being annoying. They have also less incentives to do so because they live in a wealthy environment with controlled behavior (see the civilization process of Elias). If you're going to compare two groups in a completely different environment you will have to look further than whether they are armed or not. The IRA also did various atrocities, and other examples I mentioned earlier. You can find fundamentalism everywhere, it's not because the media focuses itself on the troubles in the Middle-East that only those fundamentalists exist. Fundamentalism derives from taking holy writings and traditions literally and often by neglecting parts, putting too much importance in little details in the text and misinterpret other parts. Having read both the Bible and the Qur'an I can tell you they both have more than enough shit to play with in that sense. And if you really want to compare  the actions of fundamentalist groups (=/= how fundamentalist they are) religion plays a minor role compared to geopolitics and power struggle. 

The focus of today's geopolitical attention lies in the Middle-East, of course horrible things will happen there, given the situation. And ofcourse hatred will be present, as always. The Islam has little to do with that. You might as well have said that Christianity is backwards and aggressive should you live elsewhere during the World Wars.

It's really important for Putin and his government to say things like this, even though they cannot and never will do it. The presentation back home will be something like this:

&gt; Portugal’s rescue of Banco Santo Espirito has left taxpayers on the hook for large potential losses, sparing senior bondholders in the first serious test of the EU’s tougher rules for bank failures. 

This was the kindest approach in terms of protection to taxpayers ever. All bad assets were put in a 'bad bank', together with all owners of stock and subordinated debt who were left to burn. The new 'good bank' was not nationalised, and instead will be initially be managed by 79 financial entities. 

Public funds are only used to lend money (on interest) to the current management fund, and payment does not depend on success of the new bank at all as the creditors are those entities managing it.  Also these funds come from a pre-existing troika fund, which hadn't been fully used, meant for stabilising the financial system at low cost.   

Complaining abut sparing senior bond holders is fucking madness. The new bank with all the good assets financed by these bonds still exists. The investors (mainly stock holders) were already the most hurt in this scheme, to take it even further would be insane.

true,Djmedic,null,null,"&gt; I disagree. Putin dreams of comparisons with Peter the Great or the Catherine the Great.

Citation needed.

&gt; But if we judge him by his ability to achieve even his own stated goals, his record is not so great. He has achieved some objectives aimed at restoring Russia to the position of global greatness he believes it deserves, but failed at achieving those most important to him. And the future looks even darker.

True.

&gt; When I was still the U.S. ambassador to Russia earlier this year, there was much consensus among diplomats, Russian officials, and analysts about Putin’s priorities. Back then, the list was (2) check American power around the world, including most importantly our **alleged policies of regime change in the Middle East and Eurasia;**

""Alleged"" ? Dropping bombs and financing color ""revolutions"" is not ""alleged"" regime change.

&gt; nurture the image of the United States as an enemy, as a way of strengthening Putin’s domestic supporters and weakening his domestic critics

NATO expansion and the portrayal of Russia in Western media is perfectly capable of doing that without propaganda.

&gt; One important objective from the past — stop NATO expansion—was not on this list because that objective, many believed, already had been achieved.

How can those diplomats say NATO expansion has been stopped when Western powers reasserted in 2008 their plans of having Georgia and Ukraine join NATO ?

&gt; Putin has demonstrated that he sees a different path to glory, one that does not involve democratic governance,

Russia certainly isn't a model of democracy, but then if we look at the US, it's not a democracy as Jimmy Carter and Hardvard researchers said.

&gt; that is suspicious of private property, 

Who's owning what ? Are we talking about tax-evading oligarchs like Khodorkovsky owning strategic national assets ? Yelstin sold them to him at a discount price, no wonder Putin is 'the devil' compared to Yelstin.

&gt; increasingly, that ignores or circumvents international rules and norms Putin himself used to champion.

Examples ? Because as far international rules go, I'm pretty sure the US win the prize with Afghanistan, Pakistan, Irak, Lybia, Syria, Venezuela, PRISM, Snowden, Assange, and NATO giving the UNSC the finger.

&gt; No doubt [Putin] has had some victories over the last few years. First, he has helped keep Bashar al-Assad, Russia’s closest ally in the Middle East, in power in Syria, blocking Security Council action and supplying arms and money amidst a brutal civil war. That’s a tragic fact.

Assad's a bloody dictator, but if him still being in power is a tragic fact, then compare Syria with Lybia where there's no state anymore and the land is divided between various warlords, and Irak with ISIS. Assad also has support from many citizens.

&gt; Second, he has succeeded in convincing most Russians that the United States is an enemy of Russia – and he did so well before this latest crisis over Ukraine and the correspondingly massive anti-Western propaganda on Russian media. In 2010, roughly two-thirds of Russians had a positive view of the United States. Today, the same percentage now has a negative view

Their opinion was pretty stable until 2014. Again, propaganda has nothing to do with that. Seeing Ashton, McCain and Nuland pose next to Svoboda leader Tyahnybok, seeing the European conservatives pose with the neo-nazi Parubiy is enough. 

And that's putting aside Kerry accusing Russia of downing the MH17 plane prior to any investigation, and 'proofs' circulated over social media which get debunked few days after their release.

&gt; Propaganda works

Yes, especially Western warmongering propaganda.

&gt; This effective campaign in turn has helped Putin crack down on Russia’s democratic opposition, since they are portrayed as puppets of the United States

The US don't need to crack down on their domestic republican ""opposition"", there is no difference with the democrats. The real opposition is not given the opportunity to be heard on big news channels and read in big newspapers. THAT's the Western way.

&gt; Third, he had begun to restore Russia’s international stature, at least before the Ukrainian crisis. His positioning of Russia as a conservative counter to the liberal, decadent West resonated with many around the world, as did his stance in defense of sovereignty and against **so-called American interventionism**

""So-called"" ?

&gt; Initially, it had looked like **Putin might succeed in bribing Ukraine to choose his Eurasian union over the European Union. Putin’s $15 billion** “aid package” to Ukraine seemed to have helped convince Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich to postpone signing the accession agreement with the European Union (EU). 

Offering 15 billion to a country near default is ""bribing"" ? And there are quotes around the aid package term ? And it's not bribery when the EU offers 600 millions ?

&gt; Putin pursued what he saw as the next best outcome, a Russian-friendly government in Kyiv for as long as possible. In February of this year, European, American, and Russian officials worked together to try to forge a pact between the Yanukovich government and the Ukrainian opposition that **would have prolonged Yanukovich’s tenure in office and postponed new elections.**

That's a blatant lie, [go read the deal](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/ukraine-protests-the-full-text-of-the-agreement-to-end-the-crisis/2014/02/21/e224faf8-9b07-11e3-975d-107dfef7b668_story.html), it clearly says elections would have to be held ASAP and **no later than December 2014**, while Yanukovych's mandate should've expired in 2015 [as per the 2010 Ukraine Constitution.](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine,_2010)

&gt; Again, however, **Ukrainians** on Maidan Square said no, and Moscow’s ally, Yanukovich, **fled**

Whitewashing a coup from Svoboda and Right Sector.

The problem with Russian media isn't that opposition media doesn't exist, it's that this private media is drowned out by the presence of state media. You can perfectly well go and subscribe to a rabidly anti-government paper but pro-incumbency is the 'default'. 

Of course we think that Western media has better journalism, they don't have the legacy of an oppressive garrison state but for some (like the UK) hundreds of years as the fourth estate. 

At the same time, just asking these questions or being better than Russian media (what kind of comparison is that?) will do.

&gt;Generell ist festzustellen, dass der Film deutlich macht, wie sehr säkulare und christliche Weltbilder auseinander klaffen und wie groß das Unverständnis ist gegenüber allen Glaubensformen, Gottesdienstformen oder religiösen Kundgebungen, die nicht durch eine klassische kirchliche Praxis noch legitimiert sind.
In dem Film geht Vieles sehr durcheinander - direkte Beziehungen zur Deutschen Evangelischen Allianz oder zu einer Ortsallianz stehen neben Gruppen, die in keinerlei Verhältnis zur evangelischen Allianz stehen.
Leider sind kritische Stellungnahmen durchweg anonymisiert und nachprüfbare Fakten und Behauptungen wechseln sich auf undurchschaubare Weise ab.
In seinem Fazit differenziert der Film zwischen evangelikalen Christen als solchen und radikalen Auswüchsen an ihren Rändern. Dieses Fazit kann ich durchaus mittragen, leider stellen die beiden Filmtitel wie auch die Zusammenstellung der einzelnen Filmbeiträge evangelikale Christen unter einen Generalverdacht. Das kann und darf in dieser Weise nicht geschehen.
Zugleich will ich deutlich sagen: christlicher Glaube soll befreien und nicht in die Abhängigkeit führen. Es ist notwendig, dass christliche Gemeinden und Gruppen immer wieder überprüfen, ob die Erlebnisdimension des Glaubens überbetont wird oder die Gefahr der Manipulation von Menschen besteht. Wir sind als Evangelische Allianz dankbar für das Glaubensprofil charismatischer und pfingstlicher Gemeinden, aber gerade hier ist an dieser Stelle besondere Vorsicht geboten. Durch Handzeichen eine Heilung von einer Depression anzuzeigen ist ebenso unseriös wie die Aufforderung Spendengelder für alle sichtbar hochzuhalten. Auch schriftliche Beichtspiegel, die weit in die Intimsphäre eines Menschen eingreifen, halte ich für unangebracht. Evangelische und christliche Beichte insgesamt sehen anders aus.
Es ist auch nicht verkehrt sich einmal aufzeigen zu lassen, wie unsere Veranstaltungen auf säkulare Besucher wirken können. Die Deutsche Evangelische Allianz stellt sich ausdrücklich hinter die Mitglieder ihres Hauptvorstandes und wird zugleich darauf hinwirken, dass eventuelle substantielle Vorwürfe auch lückenlos aufgeklärt werden.
Wir erwarten von Fernsehbeiträgen gerade öffentlich-rechtlicher Sender, dass sie sich um ein differenziertes Bild auch der Evangelikalen bemühen und nicht einseitig nur auf teils durchaus negativ zu betrachtende Erscheinungen hinweisen.",0,1407238057,null,0,false,0,cjhfucr,t3_2coakm,t1_cjhfucr,t3_2coakm,null,1435076949,4,false,de,t5_22i0,4

Portuguese explorers discovered many places, such as Brazil and others, going as far East as Japan, and discovered new routes, such as the sea route to India. Portugal became a very rich state due to the spice trade in India and the gold from Brazil.

The idea is simple, the northern Europeans earn their hard earned money in their native countries, and when they retire, they migrate south, with much more cash than they need. Meanwhile, the southern Europeans develop services and tourism programs and work in said jobs, and get paid far less than their northern European counterparts. Those who can't find jobs in those areas have to emigrate (if they can money wise) or get stuck in unemployment.

I'm sure hat someone will find a good reason for eliminating the outliers or binning them in a separate class - let's not let raw data get in the way of a good story !

Hypothesis to test:

* The outliers have significant populations who have immigrated from countries with penis sizes that skew the average

* The non-outliers engine size correlate with repartition along some geographical axis

Charlemagne of course, if one is willing to admit that the early Francs were the ancestors of the kingdom of France, since there's an uninterrupted line from their kingdom to modern France. Period of conquest, education, and culture, notably with the start of the Chanson de Geste which defined medieval literature, and chivalry. 

Otherwise, the period under King Philippe Auguste (Philip II of France), 13th century, where France [settled the rivalries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-French_War_%281202%E2%80%9314%29) and eventually came on top for good, expanding its territory.

Then there's France under Francis I, early 16th century. Only rival to Charles V of Spain. This was followed by Henry IV, late 16th century, though a period of turmoil, was posthumously considered a great king, and the 16th century did mark the beginning of the Renaissance in France, and the construction of a great many beautiful castles.

The victory in WW1 saw France considered invincible, having led the allied forces under Marshal Foch, and having sacrificed the most men in the war amongst the victors (so that excludes Russia).

&gt;The Ukrainian Army can make Donetsk bitter for the next several decades or they can take it back honourably with men and tanks and regular accurate rifled artillery. 

Alright, but don't think there won't be civilian casualties in urban fighting. Fallujah had 800 of them, for example. Donetsk will be bitter anyway, I think, because civilian casualties will be unavoidable imo.

&gt;Let them show that they're the better man, they have massive numerical superiority in every single category conceivable. 

If that was they were so superior the war would be over pretty quickly. Doesn't help that Russia is probably supplying the rebels to keep the war going.

&gt;So far I see that they cause hundreds of civilians and rebels cause hardly more than a few confirmed ones. 

Funny that.

&gt;The United Nations observed an ""alarming deterioration"" in human rights in insurgent-held territory.[481] The UN reported growing lawlessness in the region, **documenting cases of targeted killings, torture, and abduction, primarily carried out by the forces of the Donetsk People's Republic.[482]** The UN also reported threats against, attacks on, and abductions of journalists and international observers, as well as the beatings and attacks on supporters of Ukrainian unity.[482] A report by Human Rights Watch said ""Anti-Kiev forces in eastern Ukraine are abducting, attacking, and harassing people they suspect of supporting the Ukrainian government or consider undesirable...anti-Kiev insurgents are using beatings and kidnappings to send the message that anyone who doesn't support them had better shut up or leave"".[483] In August, Igor Druz, a senior advisor to insurgent commander Igor Girkin, said that ""On several occasions, in a state of emergency, we have carried out executions by shooting to prevent chaos. As a result, our troops, the ones who have pulled out of Sloviansk, are highly disciplined"".[484]

The rebels also use GRAD rockets. But about that, nothing is said here.. and nothing is said here about the fact that rebels encamp in densely populated civilian areas, indirectly causing the casualties too.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/07/25/human-rights-watch-ukrainian-forces-are-rocketing-civilians/

Also, nothing is said about Russia attacking Ukraine with Grad missiles either.

Well, sorry for the bluntness, but I find the interface terrible, both from a purely aesthetic pov and a... how shal I put it... ideological (may not be the best word) point of view. Aesthetically it's just too crowded, too many things going on on a very amateurishly made collage. Beyond that, the fact that you have 4 elements that scream ""Serbian ultranationalism"" (Mladic, Karadzhich, Arkan and the 3-finger salute) is not really helping you. Now it all depends on what you want to do with the subreddit. If you want it to be a ""Serb nationalist"" club than it's ok, I guess.

But if you want to make it a sub where outsiders coe to get information about Rep. Srpska, you need to do the following imo:

* Get rid of the controversial stuff. No portraits of people most of the world considers criminals against humanity.

* Simplify the upper banner. My opinion is you keep the flag, and just the flag.

* Get  a more matter-of fact map. Show Rep. Srpska as it is, not as you wish it to be.

The important thing is that we're doing a lot better at these cultural things than we used to, which is great for everyone, but we're also doing about as good in World terms as we ever have because everyone else is also doing better than they have historically.

Il fatto è che la parte customer-facing dell'assistenza è la punta dell'iceberg. Perché funzioni come si deve, l'assistenza deve essere supportata dal resto dell'azienda: gente che analizza i problemi, gente che scrive il codice (sia per risolvere bug sia per aggiungere nuove funzionalità richieste dai clienti), gente che scrive i test in modo che i problemi non si ripresentino...

Just to be clear: StPO §153a lists several ways a defendant can go to have the case closed. They can

* make sure the damage done by their deed has been repaired
* pay a sum (that's determined by the court) towards charity or the state
* do ""other charitable acts"" (= e.g. appear in an ad, do a year with medicins sans frontiers, work in a soup kitchen)
* (in alimony cases): Pay alimony
* (in traffic cases): go to special training seminars for road safety.

Which of the routes the defendant *has* to go is to be determined by the prosecutor (before the case is given to the court) or the court (after it got the case).

Each year the French school system brings young people (between the ages of 20 and 30) from around the world to work as foreign language assistants in the public school system. (General info here: [Centre international d'études pédagogiques)](http://www.ciep.fr/assistants-etrangers-france). The US branch of this program is called [The Teaching Assistant Program in France](http://highereducation.frenchculture.org/teach-in-france).

I believe that TAPIF requires you to have at least three years of higher education before applying, but you don't need a Bachelor's degree to participate. As you'll see online, the program is a part-time job (only 12 classroom hours a week!) and is a great way to spend time in France. I loved my experience in the program! One thing to keep in mind, though, is that there is no guarantee that you'll be placed around Paris. You can request it, of course, but I believe it is more competitive. Additionally, you are expected to live off of €790 per month regardless of where you're placed, which I imagine would be a real struggle in Paris!

Obviously, this was proven wrong 20 years later.

I'm not saying the British/Commonwealth didn't play a large part in the western front in WW1, but ultimately the idea was that one can't break through the fortifications and trench lines in France, even the military machine that was Germany. ""On ne passe pas"", aka ""you shall not pass"" :p, was the French motto, and no one questioned that after the war. In addition to that, after the Armistice, the French army had the largest standing infantry. I know the events in WW2 distorts our perception of a strong French army, but that's how it was in the 20s. The British had a very strong navy, but even from the 1850s to the 1930s, the British infantry had nothing in comparison to France.

Another thing to note when speaking about Hamas is that they are not for peace. When they talk that they want Israel to lift the blockade, etc... they are only offering a cease fire for the next 10 years. They are not offering permanent peace. Their objective is to rearm and destroy Israel what ever the cost is.

Just think about that. Israel would lift the blockaged. At that moment arms from all supporters of Hamas would freely flow to them. They would arm themselves, maybe even arm Islamic militants in Egypt. Then think about the possibility that Iranians would smuggle nuclear arms to Gaza and modern short distance missiles. Only few well placed missiles to the metropolitan area of Tel-Aviv and half of the Israeli population would be dead.

I know it seems like he bribed the court to drop charges but in reality this is  common practice and has been for about 40 years now.

This is only possible if there is no ""schwere Schuld"" (literal translation: heavy guilt) so you can't buy yourself out of murder trials or anything similar.

 In this specific case it has to be noted that ecclestone hasnt been found guilty yet and proof is very hard to come by. So chances are that the court and the judge go through all the work that comes with a trial and in the end Bernie just walks or if he were to be found guilty just goes to the next instance. This process could take years in the end and Ecclestone would hardly spend time in prison any way since hes 83 years of age and most of his ~8 year punishment would pardoned.

This way Ecclestone is fined a substantial amount  of money and the court doesnt have to go through trial with an uncertain ending.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"late 1500s and early 1600s were certainly a great time for British playwrights, but was there much else going on at that time? Were we influential in paintings and music and did we have many great works of literature besides Shakespeare? I don't know the answers to that, but I'm certainly not aware of much else. One great artist does not a golden age make.  

British music is very influential at the moment, but I think it falls down a similar problem in that it's not enough by itself. We're no 17th century France. You're right in that music is certainly our most cutting edge aspect of culture at the moment. I'm just sceptical of whether that's enough. 

As for English being the Lingua Franca (which is actually closer to ""frankish language"", or so I have just been told), that really does have more to do with America than Britain, as does the wearing of suits. Obviously the UK played a formative role itself in the earl part of the 20th century and prior, but America finished off what we started and has maintained it.

It isn't conductive to threats at all and Israel has a policy of ambiguity about a lot of things, it's intended to stop people from knowing what we did or did not do, so we don't admit illegal dealings or refute them so other countries won't know when we are responsible.

Then why did the IDF shoot down a Hamas official instructing his members to stop rocket fire, *after* having already arrested hundreds of Hamas members for literally no reason since they knew Hamas had nothing to do with the kidnappings, *after* already having expressed satisfaction with Hamas' upholding of the 2012 ceasefire?

It just doesn't make sense. It is much like the lies being fed to the American public about WMDs in Iraq as a distraction to justify an invasion.

&gt;As for water the whole notion that Israel needs to supply water free of charge to Gaza is ridiculous, though, for the record, we do supply both Gaza and the west bank with water even though they do not pay the agreed upon cost of the water.

The right to affordable water is a UN-backed human right, and a part of the internationally agreed rights of occupied people. Yes, Israel does need to supply water at affordable rates so long as it maintains its occupation of Palestine. I know Israel does not like international law and thinks it can blatantly ignore it, but as a member of the United Nations those are its obligaitons.

As a side note, for many years [Israel has intentionally conspired to keep the Gaza economy from reaching anything above humanitarian crisis levels](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/wikileaks-israel-aimed-to-keep-gaza-economy-on-brink-of-collapse-1.335354).

&gt;Because obviously the only place with radical Muslim movements in the ME is Israel, it's not like they exist in every Arab country or that the Hamas are an offshoot of the Egyptian MB.

Honestly though, Fatah spent the better part of two decades jumping through hoops to get Israel to the negotiating table, only to be met with intransigence on even the most basic things like ending the settlements, the right to return, etc. In fact, Israel would more often than not intentionally *expand settlements at their fastest rates* during these negotiations. Fatah became unpopular as a result of their obsession with these bilateral negotiations, and Hamas was the only group presenting an alternative approach since the leftists of Palestine decided to ally themselves with Fatah.

There is a reason Fatah have put less faith in bilateral negotiations and more faith in airing its grievances with Israel in the United Nations: because there is literally no way a Likud-led Israel will ever concede to even a reversal of the settlements, let alone the existence of a Palestinian state.

Had Israel negotiated in good faith with Arafat, Hamas would not have been elected in 2006, and would not have any sort of political support since the Palestinians are not by any means an Islamist people. There is a significant portion of Palestinian Christians, just like there is in the rest of the surrounding countries.",0,1407247165,null,0,false,0,cjhiouy,t3_2cn2ne,t1_cjhiouy,t1_cjhhsp2,null,1435079548,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

true,Darth_Odan,null,null,"I took intensive German in college sevral years ago as well. If your class will be anything like mine, you'll take German every day for at least an hour. Studying an hour a day(one hour besides the class, anything more and you'll be on your way to a burnout) for six days a week will help a lot. Take a day off from studying German so you can rest and allow yourself to process the new informaiton. Memorize the nouns with their gender and practice them until you can subconsciously know if they're neuter, masculine or feminine.

After the first week or so use Deutschewelle's [langsam gesprochene Nachrichten](http://www.dw.de/deutsch-lernen/nachrichten/s-8030). You won't understand it at first, but you'll get a feel as to how German sounds and you can shadow it, ensuring that you can pronounce the language correctly. As you progress through the semester you'll be able to understand some of it(depending on the article and your interest in the subject) and you'll be able to listen to 'normal' German(in the beginning it will always seem as native speakers or advance speakers speak really fast, but after you get used to the language this won't be true). By the second semester you should try to think(in the beginning you will most likely think in English and then translate to German before speaking) in German and speak German outside the classroom. Even if you're all alone in your house doing nothing, try thinking in German. Try to describe your surroundings in German, heck when I was stuck in traffic on my way to college I would either talk to myself in German or try to describe the cars and people around me in German. It seemed stupid, but I would notice things I was doing wrong or words I didn't know, etc. I kept doing this until I could express myself relatively correctly (some time in the second semester, if your class will be like mine, you'll  learn Nebensätze, subordinate clauses where the verb or verbs go at the end. This took me a bit to master while speaking).

Trust your professor. If you don't understand something don't be afraid to ask him/her to explain it to you again if needed. I would some time ask my professor after class about things related to the language or even suggest excercises (this was in the third semester). Remeber: you're learning the language and you know what you want to focus on, wether it's reading and writing or just speaking. Let the professor know, in advanced courses, what you would like to focus on. Ask the group as well. In my grammar and composition class, I basically begged the professor to give us more writting assignments to practice. The group wasn't opposed to the idea and we got more writing practice(less than I wanted, but it was something). One group asked the professor if they could read a novel while taking the class. They read Der Vorleser(the Reader) and would discuss a chapter once a week in addition to the class.

Lastly: You will only learn what you study. If you think that just going to class and doing the homework will be sufficient to learn the language you'll be disappointed. If you expect the professor to explain everything to you you'll be lost. You need to put the time and effort into the language. People in my classes expected the professor to explain everything, that they wouldn't need to study after classes. They either didn't pass the first year or they would continue to make elementary mistakes in their advanced courses, complaining how they couldn't master the language. I only did the 'basic' work for my French class. I did the homework, went to class and passed. I learned French but didn't retain it because I didn't like it continued with it after classes. I rregret not studying when I had the momentum, but I know that it's my fault. I didn''t keep up with it because I didn't like the language. Make sure you actually enjoy German. If you like the language, you'll have fun studying and look foward to it. Once you're in an advanced level (second to third semester of intensive German) you can do fun things like playing video games in German, watching movies or series with little to no trouble.",0,1407247761,null,0,false,0,cjhixsb,t3_2cd97a,t1_cjhixsb,t3_2cd97a,null,1435079717,2,false,German,t5_2qq51,2

In 2004 they were acquitted, but the Federal Supreme Court ordered a retrial. On November 29th the defendants, their prosecutors and the retrial judge agreed to shelve the new proceedings on the understanding that the defendants would make public and charitable payments according to their means. For Mr Ackermann that meant €3.2m ($4.2m) out of his own pocket—around 20% of his 2005 income.

I assure you, the EU, NATO and ACO are not just sitting around all day. If your organization has as much power as NATO and the others do, you'd do well to talk things through before implementing them, instead of running head-first into conflict, as many people suggest doing right now.

Según tengo entendido, tienes que hacer un Máster Oficial Universitario para acceder a un doctorado. De todas formas, échale un ojo a estas [FAQs](http://escuelaposgrado.ugr.es/pages/faq) y a la [normativa de doctorados](http://escuelaposgrado.ugr.es/doctorado). Si tienes algunos estudios además del grado, o tu grado es especial, creo que te lo pueden ""convalidar"" (para ello tendrás que hablar con el director del programa de doctorado).

Yo creo que no hay nota de corte o al menos no hay un límite estricto de plazas. Si tienes una nota decente (no un 5,00) y no es un doctorado que tenga muchos alumnos, podrás entrar.

Mi consejo, contacta con un investigador que trabaje en un tema que te interese, preséntate y pregúntale si te quiere dirigir la tesis. Lo más importante es tener el director de tesis, una vez que lo tengas, que te oriente y asesore un poco sobre tus opciones. A partir de ahí, el resto es ""fácil"" y son sólo ""papeleos"".

''a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish, humiliate and terrorize a civilian population, radically diminish its local economic capacity both to work and to provide for itself, and to force upon it an ever increasing sense of dependency and vulnerability.''

true,jrohila,FINL,Finland,"&gt; Israel does have the means to do so: they just need to take away the little leverage Hamas has over Gaza strip civilians: Charity. Give the Palestinians real support, give them water, electricity, food, and work - and they will not feel like the only way they could survive is to trust Hamas - or Iran. Give the Palestinians something to lose, because if they got nothing to lose, they only will grow more dangerous.

Water and electricity are already provided by Israel. In case of work, Palestinians have previously worked more in Israel, they have a good reputation as being good construction workers and builders. The problem however is that due to high number of suicide bombers in the 2000s, Israel just can't let people freely flow over the border.

&gt; Give the Palestinians something to lose, because if they got nothing to lose, they only will grow more dangerous.

Have you asked do the Palestinians any more have a say in this? Hamas is executing left and right people that object against them. Gaza is not a democracy.

&gt; Instead, they choose to send in the IDF, killing hundreds of people without getting closer to shut down Hamas, thus perpetuating this conflict for the next fifty years.

What else to do? The thing is that it is cheaper to launch a rocket towards Israel from Gaza than for Israelis to destroy that rocket with their Iron Dome. If Israel would have done nothing, then sooner or later they wouldn't have had any more interceptor missiles to destroy rockets fired by Hamas. Then those rockets would have exploded everywhere in Israel causing death and destruction.

&gt; Edit: Back-of-an-envelope peace plan. Specifics obviously have to be ironed out.

If you ask me, the best way to achieve peace is for Israel is to just send a note to Hamas that Gaza is now an independent region and Israel has nothign to do with them. Provision of water and electricity will either be cut down or being billed by the market rate at the end of 5 or 10 year transformation period. When the population has to actually start to think about how they will pay for their water usage or where they will get electricity and work, then they start to concentrate on something tangible and not supporting a lost cause.",0,1407249230,null,0,false,0,cjhjl3e,t3_2coa3k,t1_cjhjl3e,t1_cjhib3b,null,1435079959,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

An expat resident in Portugal is supposed to pay tax on their *worldwide* income in Portugal. If they pay tax in their home nation on any given type of income or gain, they are supposed to pay the difference in the Portuguese system as well.

However since Portuguese taxes are often far higher than their equivalents elsewhere (UK for example), many people do not - simply by not telling the Finanças about their offshore income. So long as the expat is paying their taxes in full back home, the revenue in that country has no incentive to tell their Portuguese counterparts what's going on either, so they don't.

With this little scheme, in return for full access to ""wealthy"" expats' overseas income, they're offering an exemption from local taxes which are likely to be far higher once the amnesty period is over. When you take into account that a future government could withdraw or modify the scheme at any time this begins to look like a pig in a poke.

As for the promotion of Portugal as an ideal retirement destination, I'm not seeing it. Nearly all consumer goods, cars, telecom products, electricity, fuel etc. are far more expensive here than other European countries.

That's the easy answer.

Just give it a thought, at worst it doesn't change you opinion at all but at least I've tried.

Considérant qu'on ne fait pas de stats ethnique en France il n'y a rien à sourcer.

Le Pen père parlait à une époque de la nécessité d'avoir ses quatre grands parents français pour prétendre être un bon français (un peu à la mode des 4 quartiers de noblesse), ce qui je pense exclue pas mal de monde (dont moi-même).

It is located on the central coast of the province and integrated into the region of the Costa del Sol and the Commonwealth of Municipalities of the Costa del Sol Occidental. 

&gt;It is a major tourist resort, with more than 8 km of beaches and a [mediaeval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages) [Moorish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moors) fortress. In common with much of this coast, it has been the subject of considerable urban development.

&gt;The area has a [subtropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropical) Mediterranean climate, with annual average temperatures of 18 °C and average summer temperatures of over 30 °C

One, the commander killed while instructing not to shoot is alleged by Hamas, Israel shot at a squad trying to launch a rocket, there might have been someone killed who was coming to stop them.

Two, the killers belong to Hamas's militant wing, the Al-Quds brigade.

Three, Israel declared satisfaction up until that point, the increase in rocket fires before the beginning of the operation constitute a breaking of the ceasefire.

&gt;It just doesn't make sense. It is much like the lies being fed to the American public about WMDs in Iraq as a distraction to justify an invasion.

Except that I was in Israel and saw the rockets before we started mobilizing.

&gt;The right to affordable water is a UN-backed human right, and a part of the internationally agreed rights of occupied people.

Yeah, they signed an agreement detailing how much they need to pay, they owe us, stop making it as if this isn't an issue of embezzling and faulty management. Not to mention that we continue on supplying them water, effectively for free.

&gt;As a side note, for many years Israel has intentionally conspired to keep the Gaza economy from reaching anything above humanitarian crisis levels.

Because the government in Gaza declares the destruction of Israel and the killing of all Jews in the world its ultimate goal? We aren't obliged to deal with them, you want to see what happens if we really stopped the entry of everything from our side? I give Gaza a month before half the population is dead.

&gt;Honestly though, Fatah spent the better part of two decades jumping through hoops to get Israel to the negotiating table, only to be met with intransigence on even the most basic things like ending the settlements, the right to return, etc.

You're talking about the guys who planned the second Intifada right and who did nothing to stop the Hamas suicide bombings of the 90's?

&gt;There is a reason Fatah have put less faith in bilateral negotiations and more faith in airing its grievances with Israel in the United Nations: because there is literally no way a Likud-led Israel will ever concede to even a reversal of the settlements, let alone the existence of a Palestinian state.

Relevant to what exactly, are we debating the whole conflict now?

&gt;Had Israel negotiated in good faith with Arafat

Arafat didn't negotiate in good faith, in fact he would have never signed the Oslo agreement had it not been for Mubarak practically forcing him.

&gt;Hamas would not have been elected in 2006, and would not have any sort of political support since the Palestinians are not by any means an Islamist people.

Speculation, the main reason Hamas was chosen wasn't the Israeli issue, it was the corruption within the Fatah regime, don't believe me? Read Palestinian commentators.

Taking 2001 Argentina, and Greece 2010 as their crisis point comparison. To 10-15 years on. note: Argentina contracted 20% 1998-01.

Argentina defaulted, unpegged from the dollar, and defaulted in 2001. 2001-11 Argentina grew 94%. Their real income rose 73% 2003-13. Unemployment peaked at 16%, dropped steadily and plateaued at 7% since 2011. Welfare was largely protect, while cuts were made else where, harsh austerity was largely avoided. Inequality vastly improved. Argentina burned their bondholders by 65%. here1 here2

Greece's unemployment rate is 27%, Youth unemployment 65%, 37% of the population live on under 60% of mean income. Greece contracted 18% since 2010 (bailout year). contracted 3.9% 2013. World Bank. Predictions for this year are 0.6% by the ECB who are notoriously optimistic. Greeces bonds are 3.5% and there GDP Debt ratio is at 175% 2013 and growing. 170% was same rate as as the initial haircut. Bonds at 3.5% and GDP:Debt at 170% would require about 5-6% growth to just pay the interest. At that growth cannot compound. Greece would be lucky to stagnate to 2020. Best case senario is pidding growth. And further contraction is quite possible.

Inflation is at 0.4. 1 million (of 14m) citizen without healthcare, soaring HIV, Suicide, and infant mortality.

As for Argentina's 'kick in the face'. It is a small upset and not a crisis. The initial bondholders will get paid., and no serious damage will come of it. They are essentially squabbling over 15bn dollars. And even if it was a full default, which it is not, they are in a far better position to deal with it than in 2001.

The Argentina recovery was a massive success!! Greece is an absolute disaster! These are not isolated cases, countries who have previously follow similar crisis strategies to Argentina and Greece got pretty much the same results.

There was a fiscal crisis because France spent a lot in wars and the nobility, who had a lot of money and land, didn't pay taxes (so the king sold offices to get money). But there wasn't many serfs anymore (it kinda disappeared in France after the Hundred Years' War during th 15th century for different reasons (and serfdom was even officiaily abolished in 1779, 10 years before the revolution)), and if there were high taxes for the Third Estate (those who weren't in the clergy or nobles), the economy was good and many merchants or bankers became very rich (and then bought offices to become nobles) ; peasants weren't rich and often quite poor but famines were very rare. On the other hand France was the first economic, military and cultural power in Europe.

The French Revolution was mainly a political revolution. The poors were angry and hungry because the harvest had been bad but they had lived far worse without making a revolution. The main problem was that with the Age of Enlightmen, the Third Estate (and especially the bourgeoisie) couldn't stand the fact that they paid all the taxes and had no political power.

So it was definitly a golden age : that's not because their ideas weren't the same as ours (indeed women were oppressed, there was slavery,...) that it couldn't be a golden age : at this time being successful was having a glorious king with fancy clothes and big palaces, and we had the fanciest kings in the world !

Oui, vous aussi Français d’origine étrangère, je vous appelle à communier sur nos valeurs, dans la mesure où vous respectez nos coutumes et nos lois, dans la mesure où vous n’aspirez qu’à vous élever dans ce pays par le travail, nous sommes prêts, comme nous le fîmes toujours par le passé, à vous fondre dans le creuset national et républicain, avec les mêmes droits, mais aussi les mêmes devoirs. Il y eut un Platini, il y a eu un Zidane… pourquoi ce grand dessein ne serait plus possible demain ?*

Oui, tous unis, gaulois, céfrans, ouvriers et entrepreneurs, paysans, pêcheurs et poètes, qui veulent apporter à la France leur courage et leur énergie quand d’autres - Français d’ici ou d’ailleurs, souvent d’ici d’ailleurs ! - ne pensent plus qu’à brader le pays, à liquider nos traditions et nos valeurs, à profiter d’elle sans plus rien lui rendre en retour !*",1,1407251772,null,0,1407252582,0,cjhkscs,t3_2coa0s,t1_cjhkscs,t1_cjhjvx6,null,1435080696,-2,false,france,t5_2qhjz,-2

Sinon, je ne pense pas que se rendre sur le terrain des statistiques, en reprenant les expressions et termes anti-immigrations pour mieux les contrer, soit une bonne stratégie.

D'autres feront remarquer qu'en comptant les enfants d'immigrés, ça devient gigantesque. 

En face, plein de gens trouveront que ça fait peu. Mais au final, tous ceux débattant afin de savoir si c'est élevé ou non valident implicitement que *si c'est élevé, c'est potentiellement un problème*. Parce qu'ils ne débattent pas du rôle positif ou non de l'immigration, mais plutôt de son poids dans la population, tout en reprenant des termes dépréciatifs (""invasion"", etc) ou se plaçant du mauvais côté du débat.

An isolated incident or examples of hate speech are not remotely comparable to mass murder on a global scale. Fundamentalism can't always be measured in the number of people killed, but it *can* be compared in the number of people who *would* be killed if certain groups had power and others didn't. It can also be compared in the intent to kill or willingness to commit religiously-inspired violence. 

2. Other factors definitely play a role, but the only true consistent trait is Islamic religious fervor. Some Islamic societies are majority, others minority, some are among the poorest on earth while others are among the richest, and yet these disparate societies exhibit a tremendous amount of violence and anger toward each other and others faith groups. The primary factor is religiosity -- the more Islamically devout a society's culture, the more inclined to fundamentalism and violence. Poor central Asian former Soviet states are less fundamentalist than rich Qatar while at the same time poor Somalia is more fundamentalist than rich Turkey. 

The only way Islamic societies break this cycle is through strict, enforced secularism. Coincidentally, this is what the Christian west had to do as well.
