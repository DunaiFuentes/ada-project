This is more [about the financial implications](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20p5lu/america_is_too_broke_to_rescue_ukraine_the_real/cg5g1pe). Some [sources](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20dzzh/russian_stock_market_is_crashing_before_the/cg2pgv4) for my last comment (keep in mind the $16 billion figure for what Russia's central bank has spent to defend the Ruble since the crisis is 2 days old, it has been growing fast so I am sure it is decently higher now). 

They really shot themselves in the foot. Russia's former finance minister estimates sanctions would cause $100 billion of capital outflows *per quarter*, that is 20% of the Russian economy over one year. It cant be explained away as Western propaganda because the guy is a Putin ally. 

Given what I just said, an energy war would likely be overkill and *far* more than what is needed. But, the US gave Russia a friendly reminder that not only is it capable of ramping up production of oil and natural gas, but it is sitting on 700 million barrels in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (thats in my first comment). 

Russia really backed itself into a corner. The US/EU are in a position to make Russia an economic wasteland. I highly doubt they desire that because there are several issues that the West is trying to cooperate with Russia on (Syria, Iran, etc.). But the West is in a far more advantageous position than Russia. ",0,1395346455,null,0,false,0,cg7o5pm,t3_20w98n,t1_cg7o5pm,t1_cg7na2v,null,1432995118,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; I know the UK, Hungary, and Finland have been increasing (or planning on increasing) their reliance on Rosatom to meet energy needs. 

It is not Finland planning as government or a nation. That future nuclear reactor from Rosatom is a plan by a *private* energy consortium [Fennovoima](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fennovoima). The next step for them is to have licence for their planned NPP, which needs parliamentary decision.

I support it. Rosatom or not that NPP would actually make Finland less reliant on Russian energy, and also helps in meeting the future CO2 targets.

And it's not like an NPP has a valve that Russian gov could shut down just like that. Finland already has two improved Soviet NPPs ([&amp;quot;Eastinghouse&amp;quot;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loviisa_Nuclear_Power_Plant)) which have been working reliably and producing energy despite the disintegration of the SU. In an NPP the energy reliance just works differently.

Regarding nuclear power my biggest gripe is still the Sweden's decision to abandon developing it.

true,Fredlamb,null,null,"depuis le retour de Larry page à la tète de Google il y a trois ans, le moteur a beaucoup changé.  Google Shopping,  le comparateur de Google, a été intégré à la recherche principale et dans le même temps, Google dégradait  nos pages dans son index principal.   En gros, quand tu tapais  le nom d'un  produit dans Google tu avais des réponses variés, aujourd'hui c'est Google Shopping.    Google Shopping avait 8 à 10% de part de marché en France jusqu'en 2011. Aujourd'hui, il a 85% du marché alors que ce n'est pas un vrai comparateur de prix .

Google a une position privilégiée car il peut tout voir:  si il veut s'accaparer un marché, il le fait.  Imaginons que demain il veuille aller sur le marché de la recette de cuisine , il lui suffira de faire la même chose: affichez son service et dégrader les services concurrents. 

Aujourd'hui en France, c'est difficile d’être dégrader dans Google qui a plus de 90% des parts de marché.

Il abuse dans la mesure ou il ne pourrait pas avoir acquis 85% du marche de la comparaison des prix sans sa dominance dans la Search.

Google est devenu le roi de la Search, il veut maintenant faire aussi les réponses...   

Google a eté super pendant 10 ans: il se transforme peu à peu en  un monstre ...

&gt; Erreichbarkeit

Kommt vor, wenn kein Telefoniegerät am Registrar angemeldet ist. Kann sein, dass deine Hardware zickt (also Telefon/Router) oder eben das Internet ist kaputt.

&gt; Störungsverhalten

Du kannst dir VoIP im Prinzip wie Skype vorstellen, also wenn kein Internet, dann auch kein Telefon. DSL Ausfälle sind ja aber selbst beim schlimmsten Anbieter sehr selten der Fall.

&gt; Latenz

Ist abhängig von deiner Leitung (Latenz) und verwendeten Codecs. Ein Telefon unterstützt in der Regel mehrere Codecs und beim Verbindungsaufbau wird dann in der Regel ein gemeinsam Unterstützer gefunden. Ist also sehr variabel aber meist kaum spürbar, etwas nervig wirds nur mitunter bei VoIP im Mobilfunknetz.

&gt; Sprachqualität

Eben auch stark Codecabhängig, hier mal mehr dazu als ich erzählen könnte: https://www.elektronik-kompendium.de/sites/net/0905121.htm

&gt; Stromversorgung

Verstehe nicht konkret worauf du hinaus willst. Ich nehme an du hast bereits eine DSL-Leitung, oder? Dann kommt die Frage in etwa der nach dem Stromverbrauch von (Ja, schonwieder) Skype nah. So ein DSL-Router dürfte aber um die 10-20W fressen.

&gt; Geräteautonomie

Es gibt VoIP-Anbieter, die binden dich an einen Anschluss. Das passiert dann meist, wenn man dir Telefon &amp; Internet sowieso in einem Paket verkauft - dadurch bist du dann tatsächlich an deren Hardware gebunden. So läuft es bei mir auch: Ich besitze einen Anschluss von O2, mein Telefon läuft also leider zwangsweise über die Box von denen - ansonsten agiert die aber nur als Bridge für die dahintergeklemmte Fritzbox. 
Dann gibt es auch Registrare, die bieten Anschlussunabhängige Nummern an. Da bekommst du dann einen Server, Benutzer und Passwort mitgeteilt und kannst dich von jedem beliebigen VoIP Client anmelden - z.B. [Phoner](http://www.phoner.de/), [Zoiper](http://www.zoiper.com/en), einem Router (der deinem Analogtelefon dann eine analoge Leitung vorgaukelt) oder eben einem VoIP-Telefon.
So habe ich z.B. meine Geschäftsleitung auf der Fritzbox aber auch auf dem Handy für unterwegs und bin aber immer unter der gleichen Nummer und zum gleichen Tarif verfügbar - brauche nur Internet.

Ich glaube insgesamt, du stellst dir das ganze Thema VoIP einfach eine Nummer zu kompliziert vor. Im Consumer-Bereich ist das tatsächlich fast nichts anderes als Skype mit Festnetznummer.",0,1395348728,null,0,false,0,cg7pbb5,t3_20xie1,t1_cg7pbb5,t3_20xie1,null,1432995663,7,false,de,t5_22i0,7

What war would that be? If I remember correctly, Bush declared a *war on terror*.

And while US did take over the country in a matter of days, US ultimately failed to achieve what they came there for in the first place. Clausewitz defined *war* more or less as *use of engagement to compel the opponent to conform to your will*. You can not just treat an engagement as an end, only as means to an end. So if you declare a *war on terror(Al Quaeda)* you either win it by eradicating them or making them bend to your will, or you give up and lose it. And so far *Al Quaeda* is the one winning, since they not only did not go anywhere, but they also spread and grew more powerful than before this war started.

It could be an effective carrot to hold in front of the population, who would then pressure the politicians to see it done, thereby applying much needed reforms.

I suspect that joining NATO right now would be suicide. In his speech the other day, Putin admitted he took Crimea to prevent NATO from having control over Crimea, which he considers a strategic point. He'd invade Moldova before our president flipped to page 2 of the NATO treaty. Putin doesn't seem as concerned about the EU though, so he might let that slide.

Of course, it's easy to say: ""well, tough shit, we're not letting you in until you're looking pretty"", but this isn't really constructive thinking.

Ribadisco: il verticale è consigliabile solo in un setup con due schermi (o più).

Those would be the wars executed in Afghanistan and Iraq that were approved of, in advance, by the UN.

The US went to war in Iraq and defeated the armed forces in a few days.

By any measure, the military victories were fast, total and absolute with minimal casualties.  The failure to nation-build and reshape an entire society is an entirely different set of diplomatic and political goals that are entirely separate from the military goals.

A civil war CAN turn into a war under international law if both sides are recognized as stable, ruling governments of their own nations by the IC while still fighting each other and having made a declaration.  This didn't happen in any of the cases you cited though.  An example of this happening would be the Korean conflict which started as a civil war and became a regular war once the government of the north and south were both recognized by the IC - a war that's still technically being fought today (and is just in a long-standing cease-fire).

Immigration being one. Sure, lots of Americans talk about Mexicans coming and taking jobs and whatnot, but the language that comes out of decent-sized European far-right political parties (think Front National in France) is language that would be completely unacceptable for mainstream politicians in America. Maybe those few Tea Party wackjobs, but not anyone who is nearly as mainstream as Le Pen is in France.

Another thing that Europeans get fearful of is science, I think. Genetically modified food is a big one, as is nuclear power. Germany has committed to phasing out its nuclear power plants because of the Fukushima disaster in Japan - despite the fact that Germany is not exactly prone to tsunamis, the fact that modern reactors are far more safe than older designs like the one at Fukushima, and the fact that Germany's neighbor France seems to be getting along just fine with about 75% of their electricity coming from nuclear energy.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"That really depends. If Russia tries to retaliate by selling Treasuries the value of the Ruble could collapse (investors dont like questionable currencies without quality foreign reserves to back them up). Russia only owns 0.7% of US Treasuries so I am fairly confident the Federal reserve could counter most of its actions. But doing so could crush the Ruble. 

Many people suggest that energy exports would counter this, but if you look at Venezuela it is clear energy exports are not a substitute for foreign reserves. The real (black market) rate for the dollar/Venezuelan Bolivar has skyrocketed in the past few months. Venezuela has more proven energy reserves than Saudi Arabia. A similar thing is happening in Argentina, except they dont have energy exports to counter it. But its the same story, dwindling reserves are causing ""dollar inflation"" (where an emerging market currency loses value compared to the dollar).

US sanctions would directly cause capital outflows from Russia having a very detrimental effect on the Ruble. Russia's attempts to retaliate would only destabilize it more. The US also has the energy card, where it could depress the prices of energy, causing further substantial damage to the Russian economy and the Ruble.

Long story short, just the sanctions mentioned above would have a crippling effect if all were implemented. Alone, $400 billion of capital outflows in one year would likely be enough to break the Ruble. Energy dumping would be the final nail in the coffin. I dont think the US will since it is trying to work with Russia on other issues like Iran, Syria, etc. 

You have to remember though, oligarchs dont hold their wealth in Rubles, so any action would cause the savings of average people evaporate. There is no question sanctions will have an impact on the Ruble, that is unavoidable. But I am not sure the US has any interest in causing a hyperinflation scenario in Russia.

Con il monitor verticale sarebbe comodo avere shortcut simili per dividere due finestre nella parte superiore dello schermo e per la parte inferiore.

&gt; Abstract  
&gt;
Human conflict, geopolitical crises, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters can turn large parts of energy distribution networks offline. Europe's current gas supply network is largely dependent on deliveries from Russia and North Africa, creating vulnerabilities to social and political instabilities. During crises, less delivery may mean greater congestion, as the pipeline network is used in ways it has not been designed for. Given the importance of the security of natural gas supply, we develop a model to handle network congestion on various geographical scales. We offer a resilient response strategy to energy shortages and quantify its effectiveness for a variety of relevant scenarios. In essence, Europe's gas supply can be made robust even to major supply disruptions, if a fair distribution strategy is applied.",0,1395355721,null,0,false,0,cg7sn85,t3_20wmqq,t1_cg7sn85,t3_20wmqq,null,1432997233,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,spin0,FINL,Finland,"&gt; During this process, energy is lost, I'm not sure what the recent numbers are, but ten years ago, the ratio loss to usable energy was around 32% vs 68%. Meaning that 68% of all power generated my burning coal (or splitting atoms, it's roughly the same with all heat based electricy generating) went into the air unused. These big towers where the clouds come out? That's condensing water that's cooling off with our neat energy. 

And that's a huge waste of energy right there. That energy wasted to heat air in the cooling towers could as well be used to heat water and distributed as hot water and heat to buildings and housing. And burning gas to make up for the originally wasted energy makes it even worse: first energy is wasted in the powerplant to heat the sky and then even more energy is wasted by burning gas in the housing.

I dont think they grasp the concept that not only are Americans not all sitting around plotting and scheming against Russia, but most Americans very rarely even think about it. Its still a major power, so it still comes up, but most conversations have been about UN vetos or Iranian negotiations, etc. 

What I have realized in the past few weeks is Russians cant fathom the fact Russia is not a household topic in the US. It comes up occasionally and is forgotten until the next crisis.

The reason they're part of NATO is so that the US can set up military bases surrounding Russia and its allies to deter another European general war. Post-USSR, it has taken on the role of boxing Russia in by setting up missile defense shields and military bases around the borders of Russia and its allies.

NATO would not be gone overnight if the Eastern states that didn't hold up their part of the bargain were shed from the alliance. After all, they've effectively nullified any provision for their defense by violating the terms of NATO. And I don't see most of the Western States leaving NATO in the event of the US refusing to back up the East. The US provides 75+% of NATOs total budget. Germany, France, the UK, Poland, etc. aren't going to just leave NATO and all the free protection it gives because the US potentially won't protect members who violate the terms.

true,h0uz3_,,Baden-Württemberg,"Basically, musicians are automatically represented by the GEMA. You have to actively opt-out if you don't want to. This leads to the crude situation that YouTube needs to have a contract with GEMA to be allowed to let people watch videos containing certain music in Germany.

As of now, YouTube and GEMA could not make a deal, because GEMA want's to get paid for each view of a video. And it would become really expensive, therefore YouTube is still not going to accept the ""offer"".

Some more background: Germany has a different concept of ""Copyright"". The rights on the creation aka ""Urheberrechte"" (which cannot be sold, ever) and rights to monetization aka ""Verwertungsrechte"" (which in case of music are automatically managed by GEMA, if you don't opt-out, or any record label you sell the rights to) are split and are two separate things.

Furthermore, the GEMA was formerly known as STAGMA, which was established in 1933. Their regulations of 1938 excluded all jewish composers. From 1947 to 1989 (42 years) the head of GEMA was the same person continously. Until today, the GEMA is ruled by mostly classical composers and benefits mostly those who are not active musicans or composers anymore. If someone is giving a concert, a significant amount of money has to be paid to GEMA which for some musicans makes it impossible to play a concert as their compensation by GEMA plus entry fees combined are below what they would have to pay to GEMA in the first place.

Oh, and by the way: If you are a very succesful musician, GEMA will give you money for your music's airtime. Not all of it, just a good part of it, GEMA needs to pay all it's employees and the good old composers and ""real"" musicians.

This makes GEMA one of the most hated organizations in Germany.

Puerto Rico even voted to become a state, and Americans dont want it (US territories vote on statehood, independence, or to continue being a territory every X amount of years). It is not a racist issue, there is already visa/passport free travel between the US and PR. 20-25% of Puerto Rico's economy is made up of transfers from the US federal government, and statehood is seen as a further financial commitment. 

Closer to this story, the US presence in Europe is losing popularity as well. As with Puerto Rico, it is seen as an expense whos funds could be put to better use.

true,ptitz,NETH,The Netherlands,"&gt; There is not a military on this Earth that would win in a conventional war with the US.

First, they said that about Napoleon and look where he ended up. US army is formidable, but it is definitely not invincible. That would be a bit ridiculous, like comparing Obama to Ghengis Khan or Alexander the Great.

Second, if you talk about *conventional war*, that's a very narrow definition of war, since almost *every* war is unconventional in one way or another. But let's assume for a second that you are talking about the good old war between two states. Like say between US and Libya. Now what constitutes *winning* a war? War is just an extension of politics. A war is won when some political gain is reached. The desired political gain in case of Libya was to install a friendly, democratic, pro-western government. Did US reach this goal? Tactical - yes, strategic - not so much. So its declaration of *victory* in this case is quite arguable.

Third, like I mentioned before, *conventional wars* don't happen very often, especially these days. US doesn't have a good track record with going against irregular warfare, to put it mildly. And you can't just dismiss it either. Ottoman Empire was brought down by irregular warfare, like many others. I mean hey, if it wasn't for American guerrillas going against the British, there would be no America to begin with.

&gt; You might not like it, but it's the truth.

Where did you get that impression? I'm actually quite fond of US military. It's certainly the most impressive military force in history. It's trained, its very well equipped and it is experienced.

That we have a pretty good health care system compared to other countries like the US were an operation can ruin you financially, some beautiful landscapes especially the alps and the lakes in Bavaria, that you can attend University or get an higher education even if you are quite poor (Bafög, BOS etc.), some really pretty women around, at least some people are starting to realize that the environment should be one of our biggest concerns (Energiewende), that you still can find some decent human beings despite all the shit that is going on, in most professions you get 26-30 days payed vacation every year (was shocked when i learned that like 5-10 are what you get in the US), unions at least still exist, most big cities have a very good infrastructure with public transport etc.

The bad: 
Neoconservative and lobbyist parties (CDU, FDP, CSU) that dont work for the people but for the industry and big companys, right wing nutjobs and neonazis, the gap between rich and poor widens here as well, some cities are so expensive that you can hardly afford to live there anymore if you dont have a high paying job or are willing to move to the suburbs/bad areas (Munich, Hamburg, Frankfurt), people abusing the social systems in place, everything gets more and more expensive, people are very reluctant to stand up and say no more, because we still live quite comfortably compared to other countries, even though our rights and freedom get cut down piece by piece here as well, many people here do only care about how much money they make and nothing else.

All in all Germany is still in the top 7 countries in the world to live in.

&gt;Erreichbarkeit – Kommt es häufiger vor, dass Leute, die euch anrufen wollen, nicht durchkommen?

Hatte mehrfach Verbindungsabrüche, Kompressionsartefakte und ähnliches... eher selten, aber passiert. 

&gt; Störungsverhalten – Wenn das DSL derzeit zickt, kann man wenigstens noch über Telefon die Störungsstelle erreichen. Wie ist das bei IP-Telefonie? Sind die Störungsraten da derart gering, dass man diesen Aspekt vernachlässigen kann, oder ist der Besitz eines Mobiltelefons o.ä. dann ein Muss?

Kein DSL, kein Telefon.... allerdings hatte ich in über 5 Jahren DSL hier noch keine nennenswerte DSL-Störung (Telekom-Leitung)

&gt; Latenz – Ist die Gesprächslatenz spürbar höher als bei Analogtechnik?

Gute Frage... tendenziell technisch bedingt wohl ja, aber vernachlässigbar würde ich sagen. 

&gt; Sprachqualität – Wie ist die Qualität und wie viel Bandbreite nimmt VoIP in Anspruch?

Qualität ist für mich in Ordnung, Bandbreite reguliert die FritzBox... du kannst parallel wohl 2-3 Gespräche führen mit 16Mbit-DSL, dann ist wohl schluss. Es gibt aber teilweise neue HQ-Codecs dort ist die Qualität deutlich besser, natürlich mit mehr Bandbreitenbedarf... 

&gt; Stromversorgung – Das Schöne an Endgeräten der Analogtechnik war, dass sie vom Telefonnetz selbst gespeist wurden. Deswegen konnte man auch bei Stromausfällen selbst dann noch telefonieren, wenn das Mobilfunknetz schon zusammengeklappt war. Auch hatte man durch das Telefon dann keine zusätzlichen Stromkosten. Weiß jemand, wie viel so ein Speedport (oder was auch immer) im Monat realiter verbraucht, wenn man den rund um die Uhr laufen lässt?

Hast wohl kosten von etwa 10 bis 20€/Jahr.. die Dinger fressen um die 5W bis 15W - leh dir beim lokalen Stromanbieter ein Messgerät aus, wenn du genaue Daten haben willst. 

&gt; Geräteautonomie – Meine größte Furcht ist, dass die Tatsache, dass Telefon und Internet integriert sind, bedeuten wird, dass ich unveränderlich an einen Plasterouter gebunden sein werde, und ich ihn notfalls nicht durch einen umgeschraubten PC ersetzen kann, wenn ich einmal mehr Funktionalität brauche. Sicher, ich könnte immer noch einen zweiten Router dahintersetzen, aber das will ich eigentlich vermeiden. Gibt's da gute Modelle, die auch fortgeschrittenere Ansprüche (VPN mit entsprechend hochwertigem Zufallsgenerator, IPv4/6, IPSec, Traffic Shaping, auditierte Firmware usf.) zu befriedigen vermögen, ohne dabei unerschwinglich zu sein?

Generell für billige gute Router... die besseren TP-Link Modelle mit OpenWRT betreiben... allerdings ist das bastelarbeit mit Asterisk und co... dafür halt ein Linux wo auch ein paar mehr Leute draufschauen.... 

AVM hat einen guten Ruf - die Fritzboxen sind schon in Ordnung würd ich sagen... bin aber kein Poweruser...

Alles selbst machen ist technisch auf jedenfall Fall machbar, besorg dir ein einfaches DSL-Modem ohne WLAN oder Routing-Funktionen... Plasterouter sind auch meist so zu konfigurieren, dass du PPPoE aus der Buchse bekommst.. dort kannst du dann deinen selbstauditierten und gehärteten Krempel anschliessen... VoIP ist genau das... ein normales Netzwerkprotokoll - SIP - kannst dein Telefon auch auf deinem Desktop installieren.... der Plasterouter nimmt dir halt ein paar Funktionen ab... und ist immer an... 


Je nach Anbieter und Tagesform ist es schlechter als echtes ISDN z.B... aber hey, wer hat denn Gesagt das der Kapitalismus und die Zukunft alles besser machen wird?

* The refreshing honesty - people usually won’t hold back warranted criticism out of fear that they might hurt your feelings.
* People are generally level-headed, and act like grown-ups.
* No speed limits on the Autobahn.
* Great public transportation makes cars mostly unnecessary.
* Amazingly tasty food: meat from the butcher, bread from the baker, really good beer, etc. I’m not kidding, I do miss the food!
* Sane laws and law enforcement means you generally feel safe.
* People know how to party: get drunk, have a good time, stay up until the sun comes up.
* Socialism means good health care, and a reasonable standard of living for most.

The bad:

* The brutal honesty - often, people will constantly offer criticism without being asked to do so. People can be quite tense from this without even noticing it, because it’s such a common part of the culture.
* People act like grown-ups when there’s no need, which results in stiff interactions.
* (Corollary: the language reinforces a strongly hierarchical structure of society, where you must be very respectful of your boss / professor etc., which can get in the way of things.)
* Speed limits and construction on most parts of the Autobahn.
* Expensive public transportation (especially the ICE) means I still just get a rental when I’m visiting.
* Very little variation in food. Compared to California, where you usually have a choice of several Chinese, Thai, Japanese, German, Italian, Indian, Russian, Greek etc. places nearby, you’ll really have to search and/or drive a while to get any diversity in cuisines.
* Sane laws and law enforcement means no blowing shit up and shooting guns at stuff in the wilderness. The crazy fun is limited to getting drunk.
* People always party the same way (e.g. varied theme parties are not common), you get used to the patterns.
* German politics get caught up in small stuff. The worldwide perspective is seems to be missing, and yet Germans are quick to decide that they know best, and everyone should be adopting their ways. (Of course, that kind of goes for most countries…)

true,MrMysterious95,EURO,Proud European,"&gt;Russian national identity is mostly based on WW2 and role of USSR in it. Through a series of destalinizations, perestroikas and basically shitting on our history, this is like the only thing left for us.

So you consider 'destalinization' and 'perestroika' equal to shitting on your history? That's an interesting point of view. 

&gt;In a way it all makes sense, because Eastern front was not all tea and bagles, but a campaign for extermination not even remotely similar to anything Western front ever saw. What Soviet Union faced was almost a completely United Europe, who came not to conquer, but to end the existence of Slavs and get lebensraum for itself.

That's true, Nazism was a direct consequence of Western philosophy of rationalism and progress. Except that goals of the Soviet Union weren't much different - just replace 'Slavs' with 'non-communists'.

&gt; This is actually perfectly falls in line with every empire ever, since all they care about is - markets and resources. Think about it for a bit, India did not invaded Britain; Chinese were conquered by small Japan;Native Americans ordeal; Dutch colonies; Spanish Empire; all of them shared the same pattern -&gt; a leader of its time looks to expand it influence and get those 2 key things. In that way modern Russia do not see itself as a threat to Europe, precisely because there is nothing of interest there, but Russia on the other hand is like the biggest prize ever.

Russia (whom you conveniently omit from your list of empires, nevertheless is in many way the epitome of imperialism, starting from Ivan the Emperor of All Russia and ending, well, with Crimea and even possibly Transsnistria today) has laid its eyes on Europe many times, in particular the Balkans.

&gt;But back to WW2 and SU, after the victory Churchill proposed a plan to redraw maps of Europe and establish spheres on influence. Stalin agreed and this is why when there were communist uprising in Greece, he did nothing and when there were uprisings in Czechoslovakia and other places, West mostly remained silent. Because of Cold War split and a somewhat competing ideologies it was essential to keep those buffer states between mainland USSR and Western world, we fought via proxies mainly.

So what you're saying that a) buffer states actually should belong to one of two zones of influence (which rather defeats their purpose, other than being a meatshield for your empire and b) people living there have no say over the future of your motherland.

&gt; People often look at things from the perspective of a modern, liberal, civilized man, but back then things like Empires still existed, concentration camps or deportation were a normal practice, oppression of minorities bloomed with all colors of rainbow. History is a crazy thing and if u want to understand Russians a bit more, i highly suggest reading some books from Russia right after revolution and what followed it, to USSR, Eastern front and end of WW2 and what followed it.

And many Russians still have an imperialist mindset. Two mad dogs fought over a bone, the red dog won, why would the bone be grateful?

&gt;But back to modern times, Estonians might felt threatened or scared, but truth is Russia is not really interested in them; it is widely accepted by population that Baltics, Poles, Finns are a lost cause and should be left alone (unless they start to shit on our history or try to shake balance of regional power with things like Anti missile shields etc).

Shit on your history? Like what? Ask compensation for fifty years of you shitting on our history, of teaching about ""evil feudal and imperialist Poles"" and how Empress Catherine the Great destroyed Poland ""because she was pure-blooded German""? Remind you of NKVD massacres of officers and civilians? Do you expect Poland to stay silenced?

&gt; Baltics or Poles for example get reminded that big part of their trade is with Russia, only when they are being assholes, with stuff like border restrictions, swine plague bans and so on.

Hahaha, so you actually admit that these are government-manufactured? So why would even Russia be mad over sanctions, when it's been using them for years, even in a clandestine form?

&gt; Finns are mostly quiet, so almost no troubles with them. Ukraine also falls under this category, they are a weird bunch and when they start shitting on everything Russian and treat folks like Bandera a hero, Gas prises rise and trade barriers are implemented, when they are chill - no problems.

And when they start considering themselves people, we send in the troops. That's the Russian policy. God forbid they have culture we don't approve of! A different road to socialism - send in the tanks! Elections won by the wrong candidate - send in the tanks! Independent worker union - send in the tanks!

&gt; In a mind of a Russian - we almost never start any kind of shit or a mess, we just react to it and defend our interests. Crimea in that sense is a bit weird and something i would call an ""overstep of boundaries"", but from geopolitical point (historical justice for some) of view its probably the correct move, since Ukraine was already lost for at least 1 presidential cycle.

Ukraine is not part of Russia anymore. You can't enter it and pretend that nothing has happened. Russia has ensured territorial integrity of Ukraine for fuck's sake. Sure, Crimea was immensely important to Russian economy and military, and in the long run it would probably better to negotiate a Hong-Kong-like status for it. But Russia has stated its message ""we are ready to invade an independent state in the name of recreating Soviet Union and we are not afraid of western repercussion"". Why are then Russians so hostile when other independent states that have been conquered by the Soviet Empire declare their negativity?

&gt;Euromaidan initially started as a protest to Eurasian Union stuff, during its 3 months Russia was portrayed heavily negative in Ukrainian media, so in a sense people were brainwashed and pro-Russian candidate could not win, then shootings happen and the probability of it went to even lower number and lastly EU/U.S brokered deal went out the window as well. So, no matter who Russia would get as a candidate, he had zero chance of victory, which i guess ""upset"" Kremlin to say the least.

That is an insane version of events. I can't say anything because I haven't been there, but several Ukrainian posters have presented to me a different version. Maidan started as a protest against corruption. Russia was not portrayed negatively in media, there's been a massive pro/anti Russian divide (again, I repeat what I've read).

&gt; Thus events of kicking the guy on the ground started with a potential to continue in South-Eastern Ukraine. To be honest, after reading both UkrNet and RuNet i don't think we see each other as a brothers or even a friends anymore. The amount of hatred is overwhelming, everyone is an ""armchair warrior"" and while Russians are mostly trolling or making fun of them (as usually is, when you feel powerful), Ukrainians is more up in arms and wanting to fight (which i guess is fair, since we took Crimea, but they kind a were not too fond of us even before).

I really don't understand Russian logic - Russian imperialism dictates to conquer all the Orthodox, Slavic or generically Eastern European lands because they're similar. Surely, with hundreds of years of brutal domination and today with the internet you'd discover that they're different?

&gt; Overall, i expressed my concerns on reddit a couple months ago, that one of the worst things i fear could happen - would be Slav on Slav action. Back then it was elusive and highly unlikely, today i am not so optimistic anymore.

And also pan-slavic romanticism, best propaganda invention of Russians!

true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"La citation de Louise Michel (une institutrice anarchiste, une des figures de la Commune à laquelle Victor Hugo a dédié [un très beau poème](http://durru.chez.com/lmichel/viromajor.htm) ) replace très clairement ces tags dans la logique de commémoration de la Commune.

La Sacré-Coeur a été érigé pour expier ""les fautes du peuple français"", supposées coupables de la défaite de 1871 face aux Prussiens. C'est une initiative catholique, présumément royaliste. Ça s'inscrit dans un contexte assez particulier: la création de la 3e république. Politiquement, un vrai merdier. La France vient de perdre une guerre qu'elle a provoqué et a perdu une partie de son territoire. Le gouvernement Français officiel vient de réprimer la Commune (entre 20 000 et 50 000 morts, Français contre Français) avec une aide des Prussiens. 

Les royalistes sont majoritaires mais divisés en deux camps irréconciliables et les républicains sont majoritairement anti-Commune puisque c'est eux qui l'ont réprimée (mais une minorité de gens comme Clémenceau continuent de défendre les communards). 

Exproprier sous prétexte ""d'utilité publique"" les habitants de l'esplanade de Montmartre avait un énorme sens politique pour plusieurs raisons:

- Ça donnait des gages à ceux qui ne voulaient pas d'un état laïc, car c'était reconnaitre que ""demander pardon à Dieu"" est une cause d'utilité publique. Imaginez ça aujourd'hui.

- Ça permettait de neutraliser le site de l'affaire des canons de Montmartre, qui a lancé la Commune, et qui serait autrement probablement devenu un site mémorial de l'événement.

- Ça permettait d'emmerder au passage quelques habitants expropriés, Montmartre étant considéré comme un des hauts lieux de la Commune.

La Commune ne figure pas comme une raison officielle à l'édification du Sacré-Coeur, mais elle a été mentionnée (en mal, comme d'une souillure à nettoyer) lors de l'inauguration, et je pense que les articles de l'époque dans le Figaro (seul grand journal français de l'époque à avoir survécu) doivent dissiper tous les doutes qu'on pourrait avoir à cet égard.

Ça a été un camouflet pour les communards, mais finalement un bien bénin au regard de la répression qu'ils se sont pris dans la figure.

Aujourd'hui, beaucoup de personnes ne connaissent pas toute l’histoire, en particulier les touristes, et c'est bien dommage, mais je doute que le vandalisme soit la réponse adaptée.

The strategy was to buy time by retreating to better defensible terrain without losing too much soldiers, while France and Great Britain prepare troops to attack from the west. German left almost no soldiers to defend itself (Hitler believed allies would not dare to declare a war over Poland).

Ribentropp-Molotov Pact was what made WW2 possible. Otherways it would be a few months war ending in Germany defeat.

You have to remember that the American ideals with respect to immigration is the myth of the successful foreigner as a shop-owner.  Even within that, if you ask the now-assimilated communities, like the Italians, the older ones have a memory of being discriminated against. So, thing aren't as good as the American myths makes it seem. In fact, in a way, all the American paranoia that the OP notices stems from this.

Also, when you allow for immigration, you can't really say ""you come, but this and that idea can't come"". It never works. In the end, allowing immigration changes everyone, the country and the immigrant. It is reasonable. If you have a significant population from a new place, of course they will change social norms, policies, values, etc. I don't see how it is possible to bring the people, but leave their old values behind. Also, just because you moved to a new country doesn't mean you have to love it. In fact, you can be a very good citizen and be very critical of the accepted norms in that country. In the end, in real diversity, everyone changes somewhat. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but if change is too fast, it can be disruptive.

Dugin is a bit of a funny ideologue. I understand and empathize with his problems with Western liberalism, I too find it often a bit too nihilistic. (That our modern individualistic culture does not tell us anything to live for, it leaves it to the individual to find meaning in life, it does not give any. I understand that it is easily seen as a problem.)

But Dugin does not say to go back to the past, Dugin say to progress past this liberalism, to the future, to a new age, but he does not say how or even where.

The Fourth Theory is NOT a theory - it has no content at all except to move on beyond liberalism but does not say where or even what to look for.

Fino a qualche anno fa spaziavo dal Death Metal (ahh, spensieratà pre-pubertà) a qualche accenno di Alternativa/ Indie Rock.
Spinto dalla nostalgia delle atmosfere della WTF-Culture anni '90 grazie al libro di Frullo (il tizio di Il Meglio di Internet), anche se sono nato nella seconda metà dei 90's, mi metto a cercare un genere semi-sconosciuto: ambient (o low-fi). Il gruppo che più di tutti sintetizza quell'atmosfera sono i Fila Brazillia: la prima volta che ho ascoltato le loro canzoni mi sembravano molto familiari. Da piccolino, invece, mi ricordo di essermi incuriosito nell'aver visto due robot alla TV: si, erano i Daft Punk. Ho comprato il disco ""Human After All"" al negozio di dischi (ormai chiuso, RIP in peace) ed in seguito, grazie all'internet, ho scoperto e comprato tutti i precedenti (oltre ai successivi, of course); seguiranno i Kraftwerk ed i Justice.
Recentemente (grazie Rockstar Games) ho incontrato un gruppo tedesco che si è guadagnato un posto nel mio Olimpo musicale: i Tangerine Dream, fra le figure di riferimento della sperimentazione elettronica fra 70 e 80 (Coevi di Giorgio Moroder). Con la lettura della biografia di Jony Ive (capo designer di Apple), ho provato ad ascoltare un mix di Techno low-profile mentre disegnavo (ho scelto l'indirizzo di Design come specializzazione del Liceo Artistico) e sono rimasto sorpreso dal fatto che sia un genere che ti coinvolge ma non invade la mente con emozioni fuorvianti come farebbe un brano di Power Metal o una sinfonia classica.

Why, whats the problem?

&gt;  couldn't nuke any population that decided to fight to death against him

Neither does US. If they *nuke* Russian population then there will be nothing stopping the Russians from *nuking* US population. If it was that easy, there would never be a Cold War. Don't be silly. *Nuking* the Korean population was [the original US plan](http://hnn.us/article/9245) as well, and that never really worked out, did it?

&gt; Queen Victoria who accomplished just that

She never quite beat the Maori. And she never openly went against Russia. But she certainly had a good run fighting the brown people! I might even say she had more success in that area than the Americans ever did. The Brits were actually quite good with winning allegiances among the populace that they conquered, something that is very essential if you want to have a proper empire, and also something that US consistently fails at. The greatest Empires like the Macedonians, the Mongols or the Russians succeeded not just by conquering but by assimilating the people that they conquered. And look at the US. They go to Iraq and the first thing that they do after getting rid of the government is disbanding a perfectly good army, turning them into insurgents. And after several years of fighting them they just give up on that and withdraw. That's a shit way to go about it. But nonetheless, the moment the Brits went against the other great Empires, the whole thing ended up falling apart anyway.

&gt; Russian army in general is a joke compared to American army.

Said like no one ever. Except for the Swedish Empire(twice), the French Empire and then the Nazi Germany. The only guys who actually managed to conquer the Russians were the Mongols.

J'ai dit ""faire écho"", faire ""un pied de nez au grand n'importe quoi et aux mensonges du gouvernement"". Évidemment, quand il y a une rumeur qui confirme ce que pensent les Français et qui contredit ce que dit le gouvernement, elle va se diffuser plus facilement dans les milieux contre le système. De là à imaginer que l'extrême-droite crée des rumeurs sur mesure, ça me parait déraisonnable.

&gt;La culture française n'est pas supérieure à aucune autre

Bah si. Par exemple elle est supérieure à la culture nazie. Elle est supérieure à des cultures cannibales. Faut arrêter l'hypocrisie, il ne s'agit pas de dire que les Français sont supérieurs à d'autres êtres humains ni d'invoquer un droit d'ingérence comme l'a fait le socialiste Jules Ferry pour justifier la colonisation.

&gt;Il se défend qu'il parlait de celle des talibans mais il est largement plus vicieux que ça. Il englobait toutes les cultures étrangères des pays dont les habitants émigrent en masse en France.

... C'était quoi la phrase d'avant ? C'était quoi la phrase d'après ?

De toute façon, si des gens viennent en France, c'est parce qu'ils trouvent c'est mieux que chez eux. Personne ne les pousse à venir, et à leur place je ferais pareil.

À noter, les filles de parents Marocains et Tunisiens ont de meilleurs résultats que les filles dites ""de souche"".

In sostanza è chiaro che il traffico stradale da e verso la Francia (sull'arco francese) è in diminuzione da tempo, se si eccettua il passaggio a Ventimiglia (ma anche conl'aiuto dei [dati del database CAFT](http://www.segutti-di-zurigo.org/it/statistics/results-caft-with-queries/queries/) si capisce che a Ventimiglia è in crescita soprattutto il traffico di transito da e verso la Spagna).

What is most certainly useful is the creation of an *equal* partnership between the US, EU and Canada in all security, military and economic matters, all while preserving our respective sovereignity. 

On the military side, we have been too dependent on the US, and in turn the Americans had to pick up our slack. This must end, and both parties will be better of for it. Same goes for security matters.

Economically, we have different views on how markets should work, and I do not see how it will be beneficial if we force either party to chose between concepts. We will profit far more if we remain heterogenous.

The European Union was created because people felt that a formal framework was not only beneficial, but required in order to make co-operation the norm between European states. I do not think that, if the EU makes clear what it will and will not do, we need more besides a more balanced NATO and bi/trilateral agreements to get results that benefit both Americans and Europeans.

Let's remind ourselves that our nations are, besides all, relatively close to each other in how we think, approach problems and our geopolitical interests. We are what one would call ""natural allies"", and any pressure to make this more formal would most likely only result in pulling ourselves apart.

I grew up in Russian information field, vast majority of it consisted at the time of shitting on our history, disregarding any achievements and basically saying everything is bad and we should feel bad. As i grew up i have read a lot about situation in Russia during different times and the more i have read the more obvious ""liberal"" version of events looked like a whole bunch of bullshit. 


&gt;That's true, Nazism was a direct consequence of Western philosophy of rationalism and progress. Except that goals of the Soviet Union weren't much different - just replace 'Slavs' with 'non-communists'.


Communism initially was anti capitalist in its nature, 
thus the idea of confrontation was considered inevitable. You add to that the fact that Allies *invaded* Soviet Union during Civil war, were generally hostile towards new State and the idea that USSR would be on friendly terms with West seems ridiculous to me. You continue to look on things from 21 century perspective, back then idealogies existed, it was ""us vs them"" type of thing . Eventually Stalin dropped the idea of international communist revolution and dismantled ""Коминтерн"". If communism was equal to nazism, you ""Hardcore Polish Nationalist"" would not exist today and independent Poland would not exist as well, this is just a fact based on sheer size and manpower of Soviet Union compared to polish Solidarnost' movement. Your struggle for freedom was crucial, but it was USSR who has let you go. 

&gt; Russia (whom you conveniently omit from your list of empires, nevertheless is in many way the epitome of imperialism, starting from Ivan the Emperor of All Russia and ending, well, with Crimea and even possibly Transsnistria today) has laid its eyes on Europe many times, in particular the Balkans.


There is no point even in mentioning Russia because  back then it was called **Russian Empire**. Every empire is the same as i said and they want more influence, power, resources and markets. Russian Empirialism is well documented and Balkans were Russian sphere of interest for centuries, this is widely known by everyone at the time, hell, we even started WW1 because of them and Pan-Slavinism. 

Russia was a policemen of Europe in 19 century, but why is it that Russia did not conquered your beloved Europe? I mean we took Paris, participated in a number of police actions against revolutions and had a pretty good army at the time, yet we did not occupied and conquered Europe like Napoleon. The answer is again goes in notion with what was considered normal at the time - *spheres of influence and existed treaties*, if Russia were to start annexing parts of Germany or France, there would be immediately formed a coalition with a goal to stop Russia from becoming a dominant power on European continent. Open wiki and read about ""Great Game"" and Britain's actions on the continent throughout centuries.
 

But back to modern times, today Poland (for example) has **nothing** of interest for Russia, except missile defence shield, worth of conquest. Compared to what Russia possess in terms of resources, water and land mass, you possess no threat, nor any significant value. Same can be said about any Baltics or other countries who are scared shitless of Russian Tanks rolling in. Time of ideologies are long gone and its all about **raw natural resources** and **markets to sell your shit** now. Europe has exhausted its resources long time ago and what you have right now is often economically too expensive to develop. I don't know if you are aware, but big **markets** are the reason for economical prosperity.


Lets say a Pole is working day and night to make pierogi, but he needs to sell them. You can make as much pierogi as your neighbors, friends, city, country can buy and then you hit the economical wall of ""demand met"". This means that you cannot sell any more pierogi and cannot grow any more, making you stagnant at best. Meanwhile your neighbor from Ukraine has managed to get on Russian market and sell even more pierogi that you, double the amount, tripple the amount, he is economically stronger than you and he **can** start economical warfare against you, to get your market as well. He would possess a variety of instruments from price dumping to smearing campaigns, to pressure on authorities and so on, the list is pretty long. Now, because you haven't expanded and improved, you has lost your job and source of income + your country lost taxpayer and money instead of flowing **in** Poland, are gonna go **out** to Ukraine, thus even more improving Ukraine's economical position allowing it to buy even more goods and services and Poland falling behind even more. This is what markets are all about. 


&gt;So what you're saying that a) buffer states actually should belong to one of two zones of influence (which rather defeats their purpose, other than being a meatshield for your empire and b) people living there have no say over the future of your motherland.


I am not saying anything, i am talking about human history here. Belgium wanted to stay neutral, they became highway to France. Weak don't choose my friend, entire human history is confirmation to my words. If you want to be neutral and stay out - you either need to be a natural fortress with every single household having a gun and rigged tunnels, roads, bridges + controlling your neighbors money(Swiss) or if you are far away and possess no strategical significance you can trade both sides and profit immensely (Sweden). In times of big wars there is no choosing, you do what your stronger neighbor tells you to do, such is life. And yes, buffer states serve as a temporarily obstacle to overcome for invading force, thus giving you more time to prepare for war. Lastly, about ""no say in motherland stuff"", again - Weak don't choose, World was split between Great Powers at the time under a certain condition, one of them was not meddling into others sphere of influence, it was mostly honored because otherwise it would destabilize whole world and everyone would start shitting in each other back yard, making XX century even more bloody than it was.

Whereas the law doesn't say it in such words (""reasonable force"" is to be interpreted by the CPS and/or a jury""), it most certainly allows for it.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6902409.stm

Here's a quote from the BBC News article:

&gt;""**What is the situation if the intruder dies?**

&gt;*It is still lawful to act in reasonable self-defence, even if the intruder dies as a result. However, prosecution could result from ""very excessive and gratuitous force"", such as attacking someone who is unconscious.*""

From the [Crown Prosecution Service](https://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/householders.html) website:

&gt;**What if the intruder dies?**

&gt;*If you have acted in reasonable self-defence, as described above, and the intruder dies you will still have acted lawfully. Indeed, there are several such cases where the householder has not been prosecuted.*

So basically, if the circumstances are that you reasonably believe that the intruders intend to do serious harm to/kill you or your family, then self defence up to killing them would be considered lawful. It only becomes disproportionate as soon as it stops being ""self defence"" (i.e. you know they're coming and set an ambush instead of calling the police, or chase them down and beat them to death).",0,1395406270,null,0,false,0,cg87o2j,t3_20vth4,t1_cg87o2j,t1_cg7w4e1,null,1433004450,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

That's exactly why. If someone starts hoarding finite money, there's less money in circulation for everyone else. Given time, money will be worth more and more, because productivity always rises with technology. And since the hoarders took away part of the money, it's even worth more. What happens is that the hoarders have more purchasing power, even though they did nothing with that money.

Inflation is needed to counteract this. Inflation is nothing more than putting an expiration date on money.

I'm from Barcelona, so I don't know what you might miss from Canada as far as products go. However, if stores are anything like in the states, expect a strange schedule. It's not unusual for many stores to close for lunch (anywhere within noon and 5 PM), and most stores close around 9 PM. There are few 24 hour supermarkets and they are a lot more expensive.

In my opinion the people are very friendly, it's just a matter of putting yourself out there a bit, and joining a soccer league is a great idea for that!

[Putin's project: What sort of Messianism?](http://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2014/03/putins-project)

Here's the jist of it:

&gt;According to Molly McKew and Gregory Maniatis, the striking thing about Mr Putin's rhetoric was its disavowal of the Soviet past, and its embrace instead of a much older dream: the idea of consolidating and expanding Russia as the heartland of an Orthodox commonwealth.

It's an interesting idea that Putin is espousing Orthodoxy as the new ideology to bind together similar nations/peoples.

&gt;Among the most vocal supporters of Russian membership of the EU has been former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. In an article published to Italian media on 26 May 2002, he said that the next step in Russia's growing integration with the West should be EU membership.[17] On 17 November 2005, he commented in regards to the prospect of such a membership that he is ""convinced that even if it is a dream ... it is not too distant a dream and I think it will happen one day.""[18] Berlusconi has made similar comments on other occasions as well.[19] More recently, in October 2008, he said ""I consider Russia to be a Western country and my plan is for the Russian Federation to be able to become a member of the European Union in the coming years"" and stated that he had this vision for years

true,MMSTINGRAY,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Here is the more infamous part of the whole question of the French navy after the German occupation. The UK did the right thing really but damn was a tough choice-

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Mers-el-K%C3%A9bir

For people who can't be bothered to read the wiki article, here is the UK's ultimatum to France. The remaining French were dicks about it and wouldn't help the British out as most of the remaining French were defeatists and those who hated the Nazis/Germany were not powerful enough or had fled the country. In the sinking of the French fleet about a 1000 French people and 2 British airmen died. The French responded by bombing raids on British Gibraltar which did kill some people but I can't find how many. 

 &gt;It is impossible for us, your comrades up to now, to allow your fine ships to fall into the power of the German enemy. We are determined to fight on until the end, and if we win, as we think we shall, we shall never forget that France was our Ally, that our interests are the same as hers, and that our common enemy is Germany. Should we conquer we solemnly declare that we shall restore the greatness and territory of France. For this purpose we must make sure that the best ships of the French Navy are not used against us by the common foe. In these circumstances, His Majesty's Government have instructed me to demand that the French Fleet now at Mers el Kebir and Oran shall act in accordance with one of the following alternatives;

 &gt; (a) Sail with us and continue the fight until victory against the Germans.
 
&gt;(b) Sail with reduced crews under our control to a British port. The reduced crews would be repatriated at the earliest moment.

 &gt; If either of these courses is adopted by you we will restore your ships to France at the conclusion of the war or pay full compensation if they are damaged meanwhile.

 &gt;(c) Alternatively if you feel bound to stipulate that your ships should not be used against the Germans unless they break the Armistice, then sail them with us with reduced crews to some French port in the West Indies — Martinique for instance – where they can be demilitarised to our satisfaction, or perhaps be entrusted to the United States and remain safe until the end of the war, the crews being repatriated.

&gt;If you refuse these fair offers, I must with profound regret, require you to sink your ships within 6 hours.

 &gt;Finally, failing the above, I have the orders from His Majesty's Government to use whatever force may be necessary to prevent your ships from falling into German hands.

Reading that just gives me chills, thinking about how Britain was left alone against an almost entirely Nazi-lead Europe. Even France our closest ally in this era had fell and mainly given up the fight except for a few who had fled mainland France. It must have been a scary time for the British government and people. 

It would have been so easy to make peace, Britain wouldn't even suffer as they still had the Empire and the World's strongest navy. Europe could so easily have been left to Nazi Germany. I'm guessing everyone here is glad that Britain didn't just turn a blind eye ot Europe.

Edit: People still getting butthurt about WW2, really? lol 

Or do people seriously disagree that Britain was in a really scary position at this point in the war. The US wasn't going to help. France had fallen. Italy and Russia were allied with Germany. How is that not scary? Britain could easily have juts made peace with Germany and carried on being safe rich and prosperous thanks to the Empire.

From your comment further back;

&gt;but gun crime in Dublin isn't a problem to the average person,

So the life of an individual doesn't matter to you even slightly? Because the point of guns isn't to cater *to the average person* as the average person will usually have no interest and is willing to entrust their safety entirely to other people. Fine by them.

Furthermore, the whole point of my ""analogy"" is that there are *frequently* innocent standers by who get wasted in gang land crime and you're simply trivializing their death. If guns were legal, do I expect them to have carried a gun? No. If guns were legal, does it mean necessarily that everyone should carry a gun everywhere at every time? No. Sometimes you can't account for the variables. However I would personally give that innocent passer by a chance to defend themselves for a violent criminal thug. 

Because I value individual life.

You seem to be some sort of warrior for ""society's well being"", well too bad for you it holds absolutely no weight. Switzerland has the lowest crime rate in the Western world yet is ***4th*** in gun ownership per capita. I have yet to see societal collapse take place there, please let me known when the cracks start to show, I really wanna see this argument put to the test.

The whole point of the word ""paranoia"" is an unfounded suspicion. It isn't paranoia if *people are actually getting shot* or if *people actually get murdered in their own homes* or *if crimes happen to people in general*. That is no paranoia. You can call it an over reaction, and at that point we have subjective arguments because an ""over reaction"" is an entirely subjective sentiment, but paranoia? Absolutely not. 

You can continue to attack me as a ""paranoid gun nut"" or whatever all you want, but I guess wearing a seat belt in a car is also paranoia too, huh? Who crashes anyways!

See, there's nothing fearful about me, because the difference between you and me is that I'm safer in my house and you are not. Tell me how that would correlate with me being *more afraid*? I'm curious.

You don't *need* a lot of things but they're still permitted. You don't need alcohol, cigarettes, fast foods, sodas, you don't need certain types of cars and you don't need a nice big fancy TV or the next biggest smartphone. Why not ban those as well, seeing as they're not needed?

The State does not get to decide what I need or want unless what I need or want is directly responsible for harming someone elses physical well being. And guess what, there's absolutely *zero* correlation between rate of gun ownership in any given country and the frequency or nature of crimes committed.

Now, tell me, do you hate our armed forces? Using your logic, you absolutely do. Surely the Republic of Ireland, a country which will never be invaded and have no use for armed forces should simply get rid of them, right? We don't *need* an army, all they are is a bunch of armed people that this country doesn't need. 

Unless you're saying that the State has more rights to defend itself against another State than an individual human being against another individual human being, in which case I can only shake my head in embarrassment for you.

The point that people like you are simply are not getting is that there is zero correlation between gun ownership and the frequency and nature of crimes committed. That's because people who want to commit crimes don't do it with legal, traceable firearms(Because, hey guess what, people who commit premeditated murder aren't mentally handicapped). 

See, it's hilarious, because the only reason there aren't more guns in this country in the first place was because the government *literally stole them* back in 1972. They told everybody they'd just take them for one month, and then when that month is up they told all the owners to fuck off. 

And that nice 2008 ban on handguns because ""they were being used in crime""? You know, the ban that is proven to have *absolutely no factual basis*?

You are a major problem as a member of society. Not because you think differently, but because you are blindly ignorant to *facts* and *reality* where everyone that thinks differently or everyone is either a bad person, or out to get them, or insane, or stupid. No, see, I didn't think you were anything of those things just because you disagreed with me, I think those things now because literally all you've been capable of is *ad hominem* attacks on me as a person and an absolute inability to discuss the actual issue in a manner not filled with loaded questions or aggressive, misleading, statements that appeal to emotional response.",1,1395410988,null,0,false,0,cg895nj,t3_20vth4,t1_cg895nj,t1_cg7wjsq,null,1433005150,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

As the crisis in Ukraine shows that security in the Euro-Atlantic area cannot be taken for granted, the secretary-general discussed NATO’s essential role in an unpredictable world. He outlined the agenda for the September NATO summit in Wales as a critical opportunity to ensure that the alliance has the military capabilities necessary to deal with the threats it now faces, to consider how NATO members can better share the collective burden of defense and to engage constructively with partners around the world.

Je suis assez partisane de la thèse selon laquelle il existe une mesure objective de l'éthique, et que celle-ci doit être liée au bien être des êtres vivants (plus ou moins The Moral Landscape de Sam Harris).

Yes they do and Poles also think that they are the greatest, ""from sea to sea"" and so on. So what? I don't think i have proposed anywhere to invade everyone around us and conquer the world, nor any sane Russian would propose such thing, we are peaceful people and only get violent if you try to fuck with us.

 You should be grateful, because black dog wanted to kill your mom and dad, and their mom and dad and a lot of other moms and dads, if black dog would have won, Poland, Ukraine, Baltics, Jews - none of them would exist, as simple as that. Red dog also restored your country devastated by war. If you remember history - Poland annexed part of Czechoslovakia, refused Russian troops to pass through, thinking they could handle Germans, you failed, the rest is history.
 
Through sheer existence of red dog concepts like colonial empire vanished over the time, new things like worker right were introduced, pensions were implemented and many other things. If red dog would not exist, you would *probably* still work 15 hours a day for minimum wage without any benefits or social stuff. If you would pay attention where world labor force is moving, you would notice that everything shifts to dismantling of social institutions and abandoning or workers rights, rich keep on getting richer, poor get even more poorer and in debt. I believe there are even talks about debt prisons somewhere in the states, if this is not 18 century shit, i don't know what is. How would you like also an idea to pay bail outs for failed banks, bad debt with your money? This is already a reality and things would get even ""funnier"", not so long ago Polish pension funds were all transferred under management of State, do you think they did it out of care for the people ?

Remind you of NKVD massacres of officers and civilians? Do you expect Poland to stay silenced?


If you want money, you won't get shit, simple as that. There are always 2 sides of the coin, you can bring Poland partitioning, i can bring your opportunism during 1605 war and your sacking of Moscow. You as Hardcore Polish Nationalist may not like it, but the idea that you guys are angels, who did no wrong and constantly suffer because everyone around you is evil, is disingenuous to say the least.
 Russians has a very good historical memory and they don't forget ""good deeds"", you may not like it, but in reality Poland and your Commonwealth managed throughout history to piss off pretty much everyone around it. There is a certain pattern from a **Russian point of view**, best described by this comic http://i.imgur.com/Ccc5aFp.png  

You start pissing everyone off, you will get handled by ""bigger boys"". Most recent examples would be you installing ABM shield, Russia deploying Iskanders; Poland wants a better gas prices - Russia and Germany build Nord Stream. Bigger and stronger countries has **more tools** to influence its neighbors or work around troubling developments, you guys don't have that much. This is why you are  ""Most important partner"" with U.S and host all those CIA prisons, missile shields and other shit, because by yourself in world of realpolitik Poland is not that strong. This is also the reason for existence of polandball, which originated on image boards such as krautchan and 4chan. 


In regards to Katyn and other atrocities, yeah this was Stalin getting rid of opposition and possible ""polish divisions"", a war crime no doubt about that. But we acknowledged it and apologized several times already i believe? What more do you want? 


&gt; Hahaha, so you actually admit that these are government-manufactured? So why would even Russia be mad over sanctions, when it's been using them for years, even in a clandestine form?


Everyone with 2 brain cells know these are government manufactured, but no one will say this out loud, because this is illegal under a variety of treaties. This is called soft power instrument, there are many others. Russia is not the only country in the world who exercises such things, European Union is the same.

Now where the hell did you read that i was mad about sanctions or against them? Everyone knew they were coming and if freezing assets and property of wealthy oligarchs abroad would bring these money back - i am all for it! Remove dirty money from London, stop selling property to Russian officials, stop laundering money in tax havens and bring them home. But European Union won't do any of that, because that would hurt their economies. I am for **more** sanctions on wealthy Russian officials and oligarchs, make them move money home, not feed European economies and house markets. 


&gt; And when they start considering themselves people, we send in the troops. That's the Russian policy. God forbid they have culture we don't approve of! A different road to socialism - send in the tanks! Elections won by the wrong candidate - send in the tanks! Independent worker union - send in the tanks!


Are we talking about modern Russia or Soviet Union here? You should choose one, caz otherwise its pretty difficult to have a discussion. You should also open wiki and type ""colorful revolutions"" and who is behind them, protip - not Russia. So far Russian ""send in the tanks"" (which i by the way don't understand and my feelings toward the fact fluctuate from neutral, to slightly negative) resulted in 1 dead guy with suspicious circumstances around it. But Euromaidan had 100 body bags and i haven't heard anything about international investigation of the matter or any names at all, weird isn't it ?
 Compare this to Kosovo campaign, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya or even Egypt coup and counter coup. I guess referendum was rigged as well and all those people celebrating on the streets of Simferopol and Crimea has done it under machine gun threat? 


&gt; Ukraine is not part of Russia anymore. You can't enter it and pretend that nothing has happened. Russia has ensured territorial integrity of Ukraine for fuck's sake. Sure, Crimea was immensely important to Russian economy and military, and in the long run it would probably better to negotiate a Hong-Kong-like status for it. But Russia has stated its message ""we are ready to invade an independent state in the name of recreating Soviet Union and we are not afraid of western repercussion"". Why are then Russians so hostile when other independent states that have been conquered by the Soviet Empire declare their negativity?


You can't bomb Serbia, occupy the country, make referendum and pretend that its ok. Serbia constitution does not allow that, Serbia is a sovereign state. There's been plenty of posts about Budapest memorandum, how it was not ratified and all the other legal international aspects of this mess. I am not gonna pretend that i am a specialist in international law, neither should you. I know there were other ""precedents"" or ""special cases"" in the past, in the end West has shown the way - ""Might makes right"" and international law means jack shit, if you cannot enforce it. There is Western point of view on recent events, there is a Russian one as well.

Again, don't put your words in my mouth, i never said we should occupy Crimea and Ukraine for the sake of it, i too would like to see a better solution, but i am no fucking Kremlin official or Putin, so i have no fucking idea why it could not be done, but i would guess there were some reasons behind it. I am not a policy maker, i just express my opinion on Internet, is that a crime? 

You can express your negativity, but biting the hand that feeds you is your own doing. Latvia wants for Russians to keep on buying their property and Lithuania wants to continue to be a major transport hub for trade between Russia and Europe - it is wise not to shit on someone who is giving you money and work.

 Imagine you openly smearing your employer in front of everyone and him as well, you would loose your job immediately and he will get someone else. This is the same in international relations - you want to make a moral stand and ""do the right thing"", prepare to open your wallet.

true,KGB_for_everyone,RUSS,༼ つ ◕3◕ ༽つ,"&gt; That is an insane version of events. I can't say anything because I haven't been there, but several Ukrainian posters have presented to me a different version. Maidan started as a protest against corruption. Russia was not portrayed negatively in media, there's been a massive pro/anti Russian divide (again, I repeat what I've read).


Da fuck you are talking about ? Euromaidan has ITS NAME for a reason. It started as a protest **against** Russia proposed deal and signed by Yanukovych, you know, the one with 15 billion$ and a reduction on price for gas. Yanukovych kept bullshitting his people that they are moving towards Association agreement and Europe, but he crumbled under Russian economical pressure. The first month of Euromaidan it was a protest **against** Russian deal and **for** European future. Then *later* down the line it become a protest against corruption, bad Yanukovych and government. 

The initial opposition leaders - Klitchko, Yatsenyuk, Tyahnibok were all for European deal, read up how it started jeez. 

During this whole time Russia was portrayed not in a positive light, whenever i tuned in into live streams such as Expresso, spilno and others i kept on hearing the same fucking shit that was during Orange revolution of 2004, ""Russian tanks are coming"", ""Chechen spetsnaz is almost there"", ""Russian intelligence is everywhere!"". I would agree, that the amount of anti-Russian bullshit has skyrocketed since invasion of Crimea, but it was pretty bad even before events of 20-21 of february. Open Euromaidan and EuromaidanPR twitter, scroll back to couple months and observe ""daily reminders"" of Hand of Moscow. This is brainwashing in its finest, propaganda is being used by both sides, so when you hear that Russia is bullshitting with banderovets stuff, there is an equal amount of bullshit from Ukrainian media. These are well known and documented manipulation of mass conscious techniques, they create the mood, the attitude and the notion of enemy. *Both sides* were engaged in this shit. 


&gt; I really don't understand Russian logic - Russian imperialism dictates to conquer all the Orthodox, Slavic or generically Eastern European lands because they're similar. Surely, with hundreds of years of brutal domination and today with the internet you'd discover that they're different?


I am no imperialist, so i can't tell. You should talk to someone who is interested in restoration of Soviet Union, not me. 


&gt; And also pan-slavic romanticism, best propaganda invention of Russians! I really can't see why the belief that ""Slavs are superior than Germanics because they're more spiritual"" is any less wrong than ""Germanics are superior than Slavs because they're more rational"".


I expressed a concern that it would be pretty sad if ""brothers"" would start slaughtering each other, nothing else. Nor Russian nor Ukrainians would benefit from a blood bath, but a weakened Russia is desirable for pretty much everyone from China to U.S to European Union, so Russia would continue to cave in to foreign interests. I don't think there are many Russians who think that ""Russians are superior to everyone else!"", i think they are in a overwhelming minority, just like Praviy Sector or Svoboda guys.

The party, which became the largest single party in the Serbian parliament after the fall of Milosevic, was responsible for organizing and sending out death squads which were involved in numerous war crimes in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo during the 1990s. Its platform was and still remains extreme Serbian nationalism with openly irredentist / greater Serbian rhetoric towards Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo. After the party rose in power in the 2000s it was unable to participate in government because no other party wanted to form a coalition with them, marginalizing them despite a huge relative majority in the parliament. Unhappy with this situation, first Vucic and then Nikolic left the SRP and formed a new party called Serbian Progressive Party. This ""reformed"" party was able to shake off Radical perceptions and ultimately helped both its leaders to take up key leadership positions in Serbia.

true,MMSTINGRAY,UKGB,United Kingdom,"Well there is obviously a moral argument over it. In terms of *realpolitk* it was unarguably the right thing to do. 

What would the French gain by keeping the fleet that the Germans would inevitably try to take? How would they stop them? 

Think of the impact on the war if the Germans had been a bit more powerful at sea, the Royal Navy was just as important as the RAF in keeping Britain in the war, arguably even more so overall. Ultimately this action potentially saved France. If Britain had made peace with Germany then the US would never have entered the war. 

Of course it was awful, but war is awful, as a military commander (especially in a time when nationalism still was quite high) then I feel like it is the most sensible deceison. We gave the chance for the French to give it up and they refused. From any perspective, especially a British one, it must have seemed very strange as France stood to gain nothing and could potentially cuase a lot of damage to the British war effort. 

Also I still think it's important to remember that ultimately Britain did what was right for Europe. 

It was also made Germany, the US and the Soviets realise that Britain wasn't going 

Legally it is more complex because although France was techinically independent we now know that they were essentially a Nazi puppet state. Also the British tried to mine the water to keep the French fleet in the harbour and the French shot down one of the airplanes (these where the two British casualties) so the French actually attempted to do the first ""lethal damage"" and succeeded. Churchilll gave the order to open fire **after** the French had show down a British plane. 

I would have expected the French to do the same to us if the roles were reversed. 

Morally I don't think it is any worse than the killing and bombing of anyone in the war. It wasn't racially motivated, it didn't involve raping and looting, there was relatively minimalised damage and it had limited but highly important aims so overall it was probably a lot MORE moral than many other occurences in the war. 

It is another sad loss of life in a very sad war. ",0,1395414634,null,0,false,0,cg8an4f,t3_20zh8m,t1_cg8an4f,t1_cg89i3i,null,1433005919,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

È vero che bisogna pagare per la musica.  

Spotify monetizza presso utenti che altrimenti non si curerebbero di comprare; inoltre non è da dimenticare che genera molta visibilità per gli artisti, i quali possono arrivare a guadagnare notevolmente di più all'atto dei loro tour e/o della vendita del merchandise. Inoltre, se sento un disco in streaming e me ne innamoro, probabilmente andrò a comparlo in edizione CD/vinile. Mi sembra un buon indotto.  

Poi vabè, ci tengono a venirci a dire che i [Galaxy 500](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_500) rimediano una miseria dai proventi dello streaming: ok, si facciano i loro conti ed eventualmente rinuncino.

&gt;&gt;""Pandora and Spotify are doing nothing for the business of music-- except undermining the simple cottage industry of pressing ideas onto vinyl, and selling them for more than they cost to manufacture.""  

&gt;The answer is capital, which is what Pandora and Spotify have and what they generate. These aren't record companies-- they don't make records, or anything else; apparently not even income. They exist to attract speculative capital. And for those who have a claim to ownership of that capital, they are earning millions-- in 2012, Pandora's executives sold $63 million of personal stock in the company.

true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"D'abord, dans le contexte de la citation, il faut savoir qu'il faisait réponse à une (longue) argumentation de Ferry sur les trois intérêts que trouvait la France à la colonisation: économique, humanitaire et politique. Clémenceau a attaqué ce qu'il percevait comme une hypocrisie de l'excuse civilisatrice alors que les cendres du palais d'été, pillé à l'issue de la seconde guerre de l'opium venaient à peine de refroidir. 

Son interlocuteur utilisait de la pseudo-science pour justifier une politique qui l'arrangeait en invoquant des raisons fallacieuses. Il ne s'est pas fait avoir, il l'a démonté en reformulant autrement le principe que Ferry avait travesti en mission humanitaire: la primauté de la force sur le droit.


Ceci dit, tu parles toi d'une question plus large que tu résumes bien je trouve dans ces deux phrases:

&gt; Le droit des peuples à l'autodétermination est-il supérieur aux droits de l'homme et aux droits de l'enfant? Et si on accepte ça pour les peuples non contactés, devrait-on aussi l'accepter en Corée du Nord?

Personnellement je répondrais qu'en théorie ce sont les droits de l'homme qui l'emportent, mais qu'en pratique, rendre le droit des peuples à l'autodétermination prioritaire est la seule façon qu'on ait aujourd'hui d'empêcher des Poutine ou des Bush de proclamer des raisons humanitaires dés que ça les arrange d'attaquer un pays. 

Les droits de l'homme existent et sont bons mais ils sont inapplicable sans une justice et une police indépendantes pour les appliquer. La Corée du Nord tue et torture des gens dans les camps ? Eh bien on vérifie et si c'est vrai on condamne. Et là, tu vois les problèmes pratiques que ça pose. 

Mais on peut rêver à la façon dont ça devrait marcher: des inspecteurs assermentés et indépendants (ce qui n'est pas trivial à établir) viennent faire un rapport et rendent compte de ce qu'ils ont vu et de ce qu'on les a empêché de voir. Les attaquer ou leur faire obstruction peut être une cause d'intervention militaire. Ces interventions et inspections seraient prononcées par une cour internationale ne dépendant d'aucun pays et indépendante des différents gouvernements. 

Ça parait utopique et pourtant... On a des institutions comme la [CPI](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cour_p%C3%A9nale_internationale) ou la [CIJ](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cour_internationale_de_justice) qui n'auraient besoin que de la compétence universelle pour devenir cette cour de justice. 

Reste alors à trouver comment former une ""police"". Je ne suis pas sur que le principe des casque bleus, qui sont des forces ad-hoc et volontairement prêtées par les états, suffisent, mais ça se pourrait: la cour déclarerait qu'il faudrait intervenir, de telle façon et avec tel mandat, et les pays volontaire pour le faire y vont.

Esco dalla fermata della metro e mi ferma questo ragazzo che mi dice ""eh sai vendo profumi, lavoro per i servizi sociali blablabla"", faccio per schivarlo ma questo mi attacca una pippa immortale mostrandomi anche un tesserino (visibilmente stampato in casa e senza foto), mi dice che per SOLI QUARANTA EURO posso prendere questo ottimo profumo e che grazie al tagliandino col codice a barre che si sarebbe tenuto lui più della metà di questi 40€ sarebbero andati ad aiutare giovani bambini malati e minorenni in riformatorio e ancora un po' aiutavo a distribuire il vaccino per l'aids, vabbé.

Faccio per superarlo dicendo che non ho soldi, quando mi prende un braccio, si mette i profumi in tasca, ed estrae questo coltello da cucina con 15cm puliti di lama, io ci resto di ~~merda~~ sasso, anche perché erano tipo le 1400 e la piazza era pressappoco deserta, l'amico mi intima di dargli tutto con quel tono che è meglio non rifiutare ma io purtroppo ero veramente senza soldi e con un cellulare veramente di merda, inizio a cagar spaghetti.

La mia risposta gli entra da un orecchi e gli esce dall'altro in meno di un battito di ciglia mi avvicina la punta del coltello, eliminando subito ogni dubbio sulle mie possibilità di tornare a casa senza prese d'aria, e mi dice ""tranquillo adesso andiamo a prelevare"". Che vuoi fare? Sudi freddo, deglutisci, lo accompagno e gli mollo 500€ perché la mia solita fortuna mi permette di prelevare al bancomat della mia banca e quindi il massimale era 500 invece che 250.

 [**Communications protocol**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications%20protocol): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;In [telecommunications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications), a __communications protocol__ is a system of digital rules for data exchange within or between computers. In [computer science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), when data is exchanged through a [computer network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network), the rules system is called a __network protocol__.

&gt;Communicating systems use well-defined formats for exchanging messages. Each message has an exact meaning intended to provoke a particular response of the receiver. Thus, a protocol must define the [syntax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax), [semantics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics), and synchronization of communication; the specified behavior is typically independent of how it is to be [implemented](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation). A protocol can therefore be implemented as hardware, software, or both. Communications protocols have to be agreed upon by the parties involved.  To reach agreement a protocol may be developed into a *[technical standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard)*. A *[programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)* describes the same for computations, so there is a close analogy between protocols and programming languages: *protocols are to communications as programming languages are to computations*.

I am however sure that we all agree that there need to be rules around voting ages. And budgets.  And those needs to be respected.  Unfortunately that is not the case in the Eurozone and I think we can all agree that Italy's debt of 120 % (I think) is very high. 


So while a deficit of 4 % might be ok, the question should be- when to stop then? And will they stop? I mean, Greece's debt is uncontrollable 160 %. Or if one say that a debt between 50-70% is ok, will countries stop then if they get 75%? 

The second issue should be that countries respect and follow their common rules, whether the debt is 60 % or 50 %. Or 70 % Trust is very important. And a willingness to subject oneself to rules all have decided together. That is part of working together.   Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case.

true,352235,null,null,"&gt;There is no amount of ink on paper, that magically allows a monetary union to survive without a fiscal union.

I generally think you are right, but I think for example a union between BeNeLux and Germany could survive, without a fiscal union, since they are so close and ""equal"". However, with the Eurozone you are right. 

But, why aren't you having a fiscal union then? 

&gt;ece experiences deflation at -0.9 annualized, the latest increase from -2.9 to -0.9 is based on a cost-push in energy and medical prices. It means the real value of Greece's outstanding debt increases, while the Greek population gets squeeze out on the income and expense side. Unemployment stands at 27%, how long do you think 'trust' will last? This is basically a replay of the deflationary spiral in Germany 1929-1933.

But Greece shouldn't have been in the Eurozone in the first place. First becaue it is a monetary union, not a political/fiscal one which means they will be in big trouble (internal devaluation for example). Second, actually, I am sorry, but Greece had not place to be in the Euro in the first place. The economy is to different from the north and it didnt' qualify. And, those two things (which encompasses a lot more really) leads to Greece today. 

&gt;If Greece still had monetary sovereignty, the central bank would be dropping money from helicopters, to avoid the destruction of output capacity.

No, not really. If Greece had never entered, they would not have been in the state they are currently are in. Sure, they would still be battling a lot of problems, but not the problems that comes from being in a currency union that they (sadly) didn't really qualify for.

NATO was pretty hostile to Russia from the point of its creation to collapse of Soviet Union. It did not dissolved but in fact increased its activity, thus your argument is invalid. You guys live in your informational field, Russians live in different one, in Russian - West betrayed Russia over and over again, thus animosity towards you grew. Again, from Russian POV we offered you help and proposed partnership or asked for security guarantees, you spat on our face, denounced us as loosers and shat on all kinds of agreements and treaties. Putin is a logical conclusion to open humiliation and complete disregard of Russian interest. 


Lastly, you do realize that the leader who would let Ukraine join NATO would be a national traitor in the eyes of the Russians, right? This is pure and simple geopolitics, no hatred, just strategic position and immense importance for Russian national security.

While it wouldn't be problem free, there would be more trust and no internal devaluation. But I agree, a monetary union should also be financial and political. 

But you know that- so why aren't you creating a political and financial union though? I don't mean it is easy, but frankly, I see no true moves towards that and then it will be like this forever. or a very long time. So, why aren't the Eurozone doing anything?

But also, you have to understand that trust is a two way street. It isn't exactly like the rest of the Eurozone or the EU see Greece as the most trustworthy country there is.

true,OWKuusinen,FINL,"Terijoki, Finland","&gt;Nowhere in Eastern Europe was a free election possible after the end off WW2 until more or less the fall of the Berlin wall. Budapest and Prague were the direct result of countries getting a bit too democratic.

Indeed! But people in the West still found USSR propaganda of a better system endearing and ""Soviet peace nukes"" weren't seen as a joke. Partly it was because even with all the fails reported, they also saw similar fails in the Western system. On the ground level, it was hard to see who was right and who was wrong.

&gt;Note that whilst people protested in the west, there was very little protest permitted in the east. 

True. But protesters were also painted as communists in the West. And being painted as a communist could make you unemployable or even get you shot. 

&gt;More or less all healthy young males were conscripted and then went to reserve status. Soviets were taught that support of their country was everything and do not dissent.

There isn't anything wrong with conscription and reserves per se. Many Western countries used the system (and my country still does). Teaching kids to be patriotic is also something many countries does - in this context, we may perhaps remember that in many US states they swear wealthy to the flag daily at schools and teach how USA is ""the greatest country on earth"", ""leader of the free world"", ""number one"" etc. 

&gt; There was a big black market and organised crime to support it, but when media is state supported,it doesn't get reported hence the wide perception that crime ""happened"" from Perestroika onwards.
