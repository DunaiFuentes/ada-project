Probably yes. Wind resistance, and thus the force transmitted through the wheels to the road, increases with the square of speed. There's thus massively more friction on the road. You're perhaps aware that driving fast dramatically increases tyre wear: logically, it should also increase road wear.

true,Heshvoby,POLA,Rzeczpospolita Polska,"I strongly oppose any laws that force tolerance. Everyone should have equal rights, yes I agree, but hate-crimes are very abusable. Hate crimes eventually lead to thought crimes and thought crimes lead to totalitarian control of citizens of a country( because when the law exists someone must enforce it).

My very point is to give everyone equal rights(gays, although i oppose gay adoption, women, man? in some cases) but 'hate crime' must have to be judged by society and accepted or condemned according to the people's morality.

Look for example on USA. What they are doing is reversed racism. They went from one  extreme situation(slavery, then racism) to another (hate crimes). Take for instance most recent 'knockout game' also known as 'polar bear hunting' and you have perfect image of the case. The mainstream media had been silenced by the fear of accusation of racism or hate crime. The most recent news about some kid who stated in his video that he attacked a black person because black people used to play the game on whites is now under arrest and the whole world know, as it was reported, that he committed a hate crime.

Although I don't support stormfront or any other neo nazi and racist organisations i agree with one point: hate crime is a tool to European Civilization and European people genocide (American would say White genocide).

In my country, Poland, people aren't judged by race, sexual orientation and so on, at least not by the law. It doesn't matter that you said you are going to hit someone cause he is white/black/yellow/mixed. You would be prosecuted for hitting the person, not the entire race. 

One may say Polish people are racist. Yes, maybe by american standards they are but the reason of it isn't racial superiority but lack of face-to face contact with them.

true,xdey,POLA,Polska,"&gt; Universal Monarchy, or fear of. British Foreign Policy aimed at siding with the weak against the strong in order to prevent a genuine naval threat emerging. It's worked for 600 years at least. I was being moderately glib, implying we should revert to it.

Feudalism and colonialism also worked for some 600 years, yet I don't think many people would want to try that in this day and age.

Besides, what the heck would the UK achieve in dividing Europe? A weaker position when dealing with countries such as the USA, Russia or China?

&gt;The Franco-German axis is in the hypocritical position of protectionism at home and wanting the 3rd world to lower barriers to them without it being reciprocated, and a captive market in those without strong manufacturing and dependent on imports for their often sub-par goods.

Sounds to me that the UK and many other countries are trying that just as hard.

&gt;Protectionism is not, as we learnt in the 18th century, a sustainable trade policy.

You're absolutely right yet that doesn't stop politicians (from the UK, from the EU or from elsewhere) from bending over to lobbies and special interest groups.

&gt;German fears of inflation lead to austerity being forced without the Quantitative Easing that came with it here, out of fear for inflation.

Quantitative Easing is the maximum expression of trickle down economics, it's issuing currency and handing it over to the financial system, that's one of the things the ECB is doing well when compared to other central banks.

&gt;There's a reason that Britain is doing better than the continent right now. 

Yeah, I'm going to need a source for that, the UK is better than the rest of Europe in many aspects but certainly not in monetary policy.

&gt;The Germans wrecked the economies of Southern Europe in order to prevent price increases

As a southern European, no, we wrecked our own economies with our regulation, our public spending and our taxation. It would be nice to be able to scapegoat Germany but it's not their fault that we're in the mess we're in.

&gt;we've had higher inflation but that's the price you pay to avoid mass unemployment sometimes.

There are plenty of EU countries with an unemployment rate below yours of 7.5% such as Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands. Not to mention countries such as Finland, Estonia and Belgium which all have unemployment rates below double digits.

So yeah, some EU countries do have massive unemployment but it's certainly not because of the Euro, just like it's not because of the Pound that the UK has a lower than average unemployment rate when compared to the rest of the EU.",0,1388745678,null,0,false,0,ceg86ai,t3_1u8dg6,t1_ceg86ai,t1_cefwc5x,null,1431779726,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt; Could have skipped all those steps with Greece and just pay a tax-tribute to glorious banks.

Well, if you paid directly to the banks then:

1. The move would be political suicide as it would be the second bank bailout within a couple of years.
2. You'd have to pay all the money for your banks yourselves, whereas now all of Europe is contributing. 

&gt; You know, people keep saying that. But somehow Sweden and the UK can get by without being in the Euro to ""exploit"" countries with weaker economies. Why don't they want to have the Euro?

That's a nonsensical argument. By that logic, the only way to prove that some monetary union hurts its weakest members would be if literally every rich country in the world belonged to it? Anyway, you don't need to trust me; [here's what a 1974 EU study on the possibility of a monetary union had to say on the subject:](http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1t9bt6/)

&gt; The need for redistribution between member states arises partly because the process of economic integration, which may confer net gains in the aggregate, does not necessarily raise the economic welfare in all areas. The changing pattern of production and exchange that characterizes an integrating Community typically brings gains to some but loses to others. To make integration acceptable to all participants may thus require an explicit redistributive mechanism to divide the gains from integration in a politically acceptable way.

I was part of an Antifa group in my mid teens and, while we did go to protests and sing the internationale blah di blah, most of the time we just handed out flyers, had rather open discussions on politics and tried to do a little something good. 

What I was going for was that in Germany it seems to be more acceptable to be a christian conservative than to be on the left part of the spectrum. I consider myself a socialist, but I'm pretty far away from what is usually called ""linke Spinner"". I usually call that the German McCarthyism. If it even has the slightest hint of being ""leftist"" policy, everyone will be up in arms and go ""hurr durr we already had that in the GDR, Stasi, SED yadda yadda"".

L'ancien testament parle de [Sheol](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheol), et ce n'est pas une punition, tous les morts y vont. Le concept d'enfer comme un lieu de punition n'existe nulle part dans l'ancien ou le nouveau testament. C'est un concept apparu dans le christianisme avec Saint Augustin vers le 4ème siècle, dû à une influence de la mythologie germanique sur l'empire romain.

Avec l'influence de la mythologie grecque (Hadès et les enfers) Jésus parle d'un état de malaise (comme sur la [Géhenne](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guehinnom), lieu proche de Jérusalem où des païens sacrifiaient des enfants). Il n'est pas impossible que ça soit un jeu de mot car le terme grec *kolasin* désigne aussi bien l'élagage des arbres (euphémisme pour le sacrifice des enfants) que la punition.

C'est un état (une sensation à la fois physique et morale) qui touche les vivants qui refusent d'admettre qu'ils ont tort ou de demander pardon alors qu'ils sont conscients qu'ils ont fait du mal. Ils se sentent alors comme ceux qui ont tué leurs propres enfants.

Maintenant, tu peux aller chercher un seul passage de la Bible où on parle d'un enfer comme lieu de punition. Je te trouverai toujours une traduction qui le contredit.

C'est d'ailleurs pour ça que l'Église catholique a pris beaucoup de recul par rapport au texte, et s'attache plutôt à faire des synthèse entre les philosophies à la mode. D'où les très nombreux conciles et adaptations qu'elle a connus.

&gt;En quoi la miséricorde divine fait de la religion quelque chose de bien

Jamais dit que ça faisait de la religion quelque chose de bien, mais que ça annulait l'enfer. L'enfer n'est pas une punition de Dieu dans le Nouveau Testament, donc l'argument ""promesse d'un châtiment ou d'une récompense"" est faux.

&gt;Je t'en prie, explique-moi

Si on fait un peu d'historique des religions, on est passé d'un polythéisme à un monothéisme (judaïsme), d'une synthèse entre judaïsme et pensée grecque (christianisme) puis d'un Dieu personnel à un Dieu métaphysique, qui est la conception actuelle des principales religions, hors fondamentalismes.

Donc, pour avoir pas mal déménagé dans toute la France, je pense avoir pas mal cerné le 66. Département très identitaire, très fier de son appartenance à la catalogne. Politiquement, on a beaucoup ""souffert"" de la puissance de Montpellier qui a centralisé l'économie régionale (languedoc roussillon, alias septimanie, coucou a feu Georges Freche). Geographiquement, le 66 est mal positioné,trop loin des grands centres economiques francais pour y etre intégrés (Montpellier et Toulouse a 2h de route), idem pour l'espagne avec Barcelone.

Y'a quand même une tonne de points positifs. Justement tout les points cités plus haut: ca en fait un département à la qualité de vie ""isolée"" exceptionnelle, même dans la capitale Perpignan, qui fait pas du tout grosse ville. La mer et le ski sont séparés de 2 heures de route. On a du bon vin. Une dynamique omnisport assez intéressante (en dehors des sports classiques, trés gros impact de l'usap au rugby, beaucoup d'escalade). On reste une zone touristique, on sent la différence de vie quotidienne entre l'hiver et l'été, pas forcément en bien (parigos tête de veau!).

As for the comment you linked to, literally he first line is *""I live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship.""* so your point kind of falls flat right away. The UK isn't a dictatorship and doesn't actually show any signs of becoming one. 

I *agree* that it's a bad idea but the hyperbole surrounding the issue really isn't helping. All we have to go on is what is **actually** happening in the country. What other countries do with similar systems is irrelevant and what *might* happen is also irrelevant. 

For now it is *optional* and it's not being used to round up 'deviants' to be shot. Absolutely those things could change but we can't live our lives judging everything by doomsday scenario's. The government *might* round up everyone with type A blood and have their legs cut off but you aren't going to seriously use that as an argument against the NHS. 

I did IT support for several years, I know that parents don't know how to/don't want to setup home-level filters so I buy the argument that we should encourage ISP's to offer a solution. I also believe that we shouldn't need filters, that we should teach our kids to be level headed and know that it's a big world out there and they might sometimes see things they don't like and thats *ok*. I also think it's bad that children in delicate situations might be stopped form accessing useful information.

**However**, we aren't getting to talk about any of those things sensibly because as far as I can tell the whole debate is drowned out by two lunatic sides. You've got the ""*Stop the kiddie rapists*""-Ignorati on one side and the *""Government wants to chip my brain*""-Conspirati on the other.

On one hand it is clearly difficult to even define hate speech, and punishing people for saying things is a *very* uncomfortable slippery slope. But on the other hand, we can't pretend that words are powerless. From a legal perspective, this is highly problematic — there is no good solution that isn't muddy and ambiguous.

But either extreme (be that ""free speech fundamentalism"" or ""punish speech and thought"") is worse. I favor open debate, and the ability to face and challenge discriminatory statements head on. This is easy as long as the offending opinion is held by a minority. But there is always the risk that a memetic disease in the form of unfounded prejudice takes hold in the broader population, and we know the consequences of this. It is literally what enabled the Holocaust. It is the reason we're even still talking about gay rights. It is the reason people of color in Western societies are still facing huge challenges.

I would like to believe that we are always moving in the direction of progress, but history simply does not support this view. I would like to believe that open discourse ensures this progression, and it has in recent years, but regression is still a risk (look at the rise of populist movements in Europe, for instance). So how *do* we ensure the freedoms of all in the face of a prejudiced majority?

A constitutional foundation for European law, that defines and implements all human rights regardless of race, gender, sexuality, religion, and ethnicity, could be one solution. However, such proposals are universally met with accusations of ""elitism"", and it's not untrue — progress is mostly led by the elite.

I mean, there are a few that are no-brainers (websites advocating and planning violence or terrorism, child porn) but if someone wants to have a racist website, or a sexist website, or a homophobic website, I kinda think they should have that right.

Die wenigen Infos, die ich hier habe, sind hauptsächlich aus dem Rundfunk und dem Netz, und da heißt es, dass ein Baggerfahrer an der Alfred-Nobel-Straße die Weltkriegsbombe wohl ausgelöst hat.
Die darauffolgende Explosion hat den Fahrer getötet und einige wenige schwer und viele weitere leicht verletzt.
Um den Explosionsort herum, sind Gebäude von der Wucht der Explosion sowie von umherfliegenden Trümmerteilen beschädigt worden. Einige sprachen von einem wahren Trümmerfeld.

Die Explosion war so laut, dass man es wohl bis Rheinbach, Erftstadt und sogar Bonn spüren/hören konnte.

Am Hit-Markt kamen Teile der Deckenverkleidung runter, so dass man im Inneren davon ausgegangen ist, ""dass ein Flugzeug das Gebäude getroffen hätte"" (sic!). Das klingt zwar reichlich verwirrt, aber im ersten Moment rasten in meinem Kopf auch unzählige Gedanken herum und hab an einen Terroranschlag geglaubt. Hab ernsthaft überlegt, wo ich mich jetzt am Besten schützend verstecken könnte, sollte eine weitere Bombe hochgehen.

Viel kann ich momentan nicht dazu beisteuern. Da wissen die unzähligen Gaffer mehr, die sich tatsächlich extra auf den Weg gemacht haben, um sich am Unglück aufzugeilen und dabei auch noch munter die Zufahrtswege für die Rettungskräfte behindert haben.

true,FrankOBall,tourist,,"&gt; Trovo incredibilmente squallido chi downvota quei post. Oltre a fare un uso improprio del downvote ci fa pure passare da cafoni inospitali.

Ammetto di essere, in molti casi, uno di quei cafoni inospitali, anche se faccio una distinzione fra post che chiedono cose che si possono trovare facilmente con una googlata e post che invece hanno domande specifiche.

I quesiti del primo tipo sono facilmente risolvibili con una guida turistica o i mille mila siti turistici che ci sono, o persino con wikipedia. Inoltre, se uno non fa lo sforzo di guardare sulla parte destra della pagina, dove è scritto, in grassetto e in inglese, ""Are you planning to visit Italy?"", onestamente non merita lo sforzo di essere aiutato.

Ed in questo caso penso che il downvote sia usato nel senso giusto, cioè trovo che il 423.597esimo post del tipo ""sono in vacanza per 5 giorni a Roma e Firenze, cosa mi consigliate di vedere?"" non contribuisca alla discussione, che è il motivo per cui andrebbe usato il downvote.

Un altro discorso meritano richieste particolari, dove sono ben lieto di aiutare, ma di questo si è già discusso in precedenza.

-----------

Ecco, bella domanda, avevo cercato un po'.. ma non capisco il nome che hanno dato a quelle categorie, ho trovato queste 4 categorie di prodotto, ma non so se includono tutto:

Merce |  export globale | export italiano | percentuale dell'export globale
---------|---------:|:---------:|:---------:
[Parti e accessori per armi militari](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/tree_map/export/show/all/9305/2010/) |$1,573,744,097|**$ 99 M** |**6,7%**|
[Carri armati e altri velivoli corrazzati](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/tree_map/export/show/all/8710/2010/) |$3,857,750,553|**$ 19 M**|**0,51%**|
[Aircraft, spacecraft &amp; launch vehicles](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/tree_map/export/show/all/8802/2010/) | $119,131,102,139 | **$ 2.0 B** | **1,7%**|
[armi da fuoco e simili dispositivi](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/tree_map/export/show/all/9303/2010/)|$1,073,748,440|**$ 250 M**|**24%**|

-------------


Nella categoria **Aircraft, spacecraft &amp; launch vehicles** l'Italia non fa la parte del leone a livello mondiale (1,7% dell'export mondiale), ma $ 2.0 B significa una grossa fetta dell'export nazionale (0,48% di tutto l'export italiano).

Al contrario la categoria **armi da fuoco e simili dispositivi**, corrisponde ad una piccola fetta dell'export nazionale (0,058%), eppure questa la rende la principale esportatrice di armi da fuoco nel mondo.

 mi sono reso conto che classificazioni di prodotti diversi danno risultati diversi.

Infatti secondo [un'altra classificazione di prodotti](http://i.imgur.com/7RHdfeI.png) c'è la categoria dei soli veivoli corrazzati dove l'Italia nel 2010 sembra aver esportato solo [200 milioni](http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/tree_map/export/show/all/9510/2010/); quindi molto meno dei 2000 milioni della tabella qui sopra dove però sono inclusi anche altri veicoli corrazzati.

------

EDIT:ho letto ora il tuo EDIT e ora l'ho aggiunto alla tabella.

&gt; Risposto da solo, http://atlas.media.mit.edu/explore/tree_map/export/ita/show/9303/2010/[1] 246 milioni di euro. Poco!

Occhi che si parla di dollari. Comunque è poco a livello nazionale (è una piccola fetta dell'export nazionale), ma quei pochi 246 milioni l'hanno resa nel 2010 la principale esportatrice di armi da fuoco mondiale, con quasi un quarto dell'export globale.

EDIT2:
Per leggere tali dati ricordarsi che:

* [xkcd rilevante](http://xkcd.com/558/)

true,SavannaJeff,AUST,Australia,"As I've mentioned, I was talking about different cultures of looking at security (German vs British), and I think that there is a massive difference in how the two societies view it, I wasn't saying that 'because the Stasi were bad, all surveillance is bad. The Germans had the records of the Stasi being released in the 90s, the Gestapo before that, and they are very conscious of how dangerous surveillance culture can be. The British haven't been through that, and perhaps that's why they're less wary of it. It's not a matter of 'experiences with the Stasi and the nazis mean the Germans know better', it's pointing out the different cultures.

On a personal level, I am concerned. I'm not saying this *is* happening but the way that many security apparati of the state operate these days is not transparent and at a questionable level of transparency. Combine that with recent spying on private citizens scandals, data sharing agreements In the hands of just the executive, lack of judicial oversight, recent scandals involving backdoors in computer software and there is a very worrying picture. 

About two dozen British citizens have been stripped of their British citizenship this year with no judicial oversight or public scrutiny, based off the word of opaque security organisations and arbitrary decisions by the executive. Reportedly, these citizens went to Syria to fight against Assad and that's why. But how do we know that that was the case, how do we know these citizens intended to harm the UK, and how was this decision reached. They've basically been sentenced to permanent exile, and the public can't examine how.

Given that, I think there's serious reason for concern over how these kinds of systems operate, and the fact that British citizens are unconcerned is troubling.

That however is exactly what you propose. Do you want to censor me too because I think that people like you are the problem? After all you, just like Nazis, Islamic fundamentalists, identarians and others see society as being ""diseased"" (your words, not mine) and in order to cure it from impurity you need to employ the state to control what people think and say. This is incredibly arrogant and conceited. It is also hubris that leads to impossible government overreach, especially in the age of the internet. Who and how many do you want to employ to decide when exactly an opinion stops being legal? When is a prejudice a prejudice, when is it a conviction or a religion? You were talking about ""people of colour"", do you see black nationalism as a prejudice too? What about biblical and quranic mandated opposition towards homosexuality?

Have ever dared to think that the problem is maybe that other people actually have such an unfortunate opinion and that if you want to improve society you have to change their minds instead of censoring them? You can help victims of racism and you can protect people from assaults. You can put in school curricula that people are taught facts about history and biology that undermine racism. You can make public and private campaigns in favour of human rights and equality. You cannot however bully people to be less racist or put people in jail if they profess opinions you don't like because they are ""memetic diseases"". That's against their rights and it undermines democracy, liberalism and the rule of law and does not save it. 

&gt; A constitutional foundation for European law, that defines and implements all human rights regardless of race, gender, sexuality, religion, and ethnicity, could be one solution.

Websites are arguably the prime users of the internet. And they are the ones truly suffering from this. It doesn't even have to be malicious censorship, it can be accidental - Have a comments section? Some troll posting a few shock sites and porn images? An arbitrary crawler can suddenly identify you as a porn site. Oops, you may suddenly be essentially gone from the internet for a few countries.

There are however some problems with internet filters. They're more similar to the censorship we have rightfully abolished and pretty dissimilar to the censorship that's accepted today:

 - Censorship used to work the way that after you wrote something you had to get the permission to publish by the censor. Today we're used to first publish and only if someone comes across it and deems it illegal it is taken down. The internet filters don't work that way as they would be even less effective as they are now.

 - Taking down something right now is a juristic act. We don't have some clerk anymore that decides wether to allow something or not by his arbitrariness. We have judges that use legal actions that developed over centuries to be as fair as possible. With the internet filter this again is brought back to the status where you have to rely on someone's arbitrariness.

There are several problems this has like abuse or the use of the blocklist to find content, but I think most of them are clear so I won't go further into them.

In the end the internet filter was prevented in Germany mostly with the slogan ""deleting instead of blocking"" as the main argument for the internet filter was child pornography.

&gt; The point is that nothing is under censorship in the Internet. Indeed you have always the technical means to go on whatever website you want.

You are absolutely wrong. There are plenty of websites that are entirely blocked in several countries. In fact, nearly every country blocks at least a few websites. Some ISPs do it more poorly than others, which allows people to work around it with a few HTTP header modifications or simply by using HTTPS.

If you mean TOR, then no, TOR is not a ""technical means to go on whatever website you want"". TOR is a censorship circumvention tool, but it is only as good as the endpoint you're connected to. Saying ""there's no censorship because TOR exists"" is like saying you can't censor the news as long as you can phone someone in another country to ask them for the real news.

&gt; Today, I mean in our modern society, porn websites are likely the best way to learn how sex is working.

Now here's why I'm sad you're not a troll: You actually think that. The internet, and porn on the internet, has been around for long enough to have been around kids who are now adults. These kids are not any more fucked up than any other generation.  
But let's assume for one stupid moment that you're right. How is censorship a good way to deal with ""the best way to learn about sex""? If you don't want your kids to learn about sex through porn, then fucking teach them yourself (no pun intended). Or are you going to make sure you cover their eyes and ears their entire life up until an arbitrary birthday which will immediately mean they're mature enough to understand where babies come from?

In other words - you could not sign-up for a new ISP account without making a conscious decision between the two options.

So lemme get this straight - the law then is that now ISPs have to ask users whether or not they want a censored internet from the get go, vs before the user would have to ask for a censored internet? And there's no default option for the ISP? 

Do you happen to have the text of whatever law this is to support your position? Because [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_United_Kingdom#Default_blocking_of_content_by_Internet_Service_Providers) states that:

&gt;There is an ongoing program to introduce a broad system of default blocking of certain types of content to all Internet users in the UK. New customers have their Internet access filtered at the ISP level so that certain web sites are blocked. A voluntary code of practice agreed by all four major ISPs[6] means that customers have to 'opt out' of the ISP filtering to gain access to the blocked content.[7] The range of content blocked by ISPs can be increased over time[8] and now include content tagged as the following:[9]
&gt; [ ... a bunch of various categories of ""objectionable"" content ... ]

&gt;The idea for default filtering originated in manifesto commitments by the 2010 coalition government partners concerning ""the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood"".[20] This was followed by a review (the Bailey Review)[21] and a consultation by UKCCIS.[22] Prime Minister David Cameron made it clear in July 2013 that his aim was to ensure that by the end of 2013 all ISPs would have a filtering system in place.[23] **As a result three of the four major ISPs (TalkTalk, Sky and BT[24]) began applying default filtering to new customers by the end of 2013**. Virgin will begin doing so in January 2014.[25] **Default filtering of existing customers will be implemented by all four major ISPs during 2014 with the aim of ensuring that the system applies to 95% of all households by the end of the year.[26][27]**

It has a realistic chance of success, because it is cross-compatible with Android apps.

If you don't log into the BT account setup page, what is the default? 

I've contracted with at least 5 ISPs for internet service. I've never had to go into their account settings to get my account working properly. I call them up, say I want internet, they send me a modem or turn on a switch, plug the modem in, and it works. I just get internet, uncensored. Is this a new step that is required that UK users would have to go into their account settings before being able to access the internet?

What if you are setting up your account on the phone? Is the question asked by mandate now, or was this a question that was always asked?

I think you're trying to gloss over the issue here. I'm fine that an ISP is going to offer a censored version. I think it's a stupid idea, I think it's a bad idea, and I think parents who rely on it instead of monitoring their children themselves are neglecting their duties. But, that's up to them. But when a government steps in, and says to business ""Okay, you're going to have to offer this, you're going to have to do this, you have to do that"" in the name of censorship, then to me that's a big issue.

You are making it sound much simpler than it is.

Maybe you know how TOR and proxies work (and those chrome extensions you speak of are usually proxies), but in case you don't: The information is relayed from the person you are connecting to.

I meant it when I wrote my analogy earlier. Imagine you have no source of news in your country (eg. all newspapers and news stations are shut down). Would you consider ""calling a friend outside the country"" a source of news, therefore nullifying the censorship? This is my point: When you work around censorship, it doesn't make the censorship magically disappear. Lambda users are not necessarily aware of censorship circumvention, or it may not be legal at all in your country.

I perfectly understand your point and I disagree: Sex education has never been higher, especially compared to the previous century.

I fear for the future of quality of journalism because I fairly consistently see ""news"" articles with headlines that are pure clickbait and were written not by a true independent reporter but by someone who pretends to be an independent journalist but has no journalistic standards, and because of anonymity, they don't have to worry about their reputation as journalists.

The Guardian is a good example of independent journalism because it has true journalists who have a reputation to maintain and it has an experienced editor at its helm.

An example of fake ""independent"" journalism is the American pundit Glenn Beck. This man's ""journalism"" helped ignite the Tea Party movement in the US by preying on the fears of poor, undereducated white Americans. He convinced these American yokels that Obama was a muslim, a communist, a fascist, who wanted to enslave the white race. He used social media, he used radio, podcasts, youtube videos, and his own website to do so. It turns out that Glenn Beck was receiving ENORMOUS amounts of cash from the slimy billionaire Koch brothers to generate a perceived 'grassroots' movement. This artificially generated ""grassroots"" Tea Party movement is directly responsible for the government shutdown and threatened to destroy the global economy if ""Obamacare"" wasn't repealed.

&gt; * Established in 1291

Our founding Myth. Switzerland was founded in 1848. A treaty was signed in 1291 which created a alliance between three of todays cantons. By 1353 five additional cantons (Glarus, Zug, Luzern, Zürich, Bern) had joined and the Swiss Confedercy was formaly established.

&gt; Head of state is the President- he is also head of the federal government, elected for 1 year

Not really and misleading. We dont have a president. We have a Federal Council (Bundesrat) with seven members. Those are voted in by parliament. It is a collequal council, which means that they discuss stuff and vote on it and then every member has to advocat the position of the Council. This is however just a rule and not strictly enforced. Ignoring it may have political backlash and lead to a Bundesrat not beeing reelected (which is very rare, but happened to our beloved Blocher).

The Council has a president who is selected by rotation for a year. But the presidency is only for representative purposes and does not entail any actual power.

&gt; Frequent referenda, on the state, canton, local levels

Just calling it referenda is not very accurate. There are ""Volksinitiative"", ""Referendum"" and ""Staatsvertragsreferendum"". They have different purposes and aren't used that frequently. Additionally only 20 out of 305 initiatives were accepted since 1891. But have become more frequent in recent years as there are currently 22 initiatives in the works.

""Ummah Schweiz""

You're really naive on this one. An organization that lobbies or will begin to lobby towards segregation, not integration. An organization Rule by Islamic principles and that aims to unify Muslims to ensure Switzerland gives in to their political demands like shariah, building minaretes and laxing immigration towards refugee intake.

&gt; Bullshit. The vast majority of members are moderates. Any radicals are closely monitored by our intelligence service.

Moderate Muslims are irrelevant and likely non existent. Even non practicing ones are biased towards their religion and culture. These give tacit approval of violent action in the form of silence and non cooperation with authorities. Took years of self-vicitimization, funded by foreign oil and blood money, but it got the latest generation far more radicalized than the previous one. The tensions are quite present.

&gt; The ban made absolutly no sense on any level. Anyone who supported that billshit is a bigoted brick. SO getting angry about it is their right.

The ban was the only thing that made sense. It's worrying that it takes a right winged parties to do it, when it should be common sense.

true,UserNotAvailable,null,null,"For one there are different shipping companies, UPS, DPD, Hermes and FedEx exist in germany, but some of these only ship within europe or fall back to the other companies for international mail.

I think the biggest shipping company for private entities in germany is DHL. With DHL there are 2 different types of packets:

[Parcels (Päckchen)](http://www.dhl.de/en/paket/geschaeftskunden/ab-50-pakete/internationaler-versand/paeckchen.html) and [packets (Pakete)](http://www.dhl.de/en/paket/pakete-versenden/weltweit-versenden/paket.html).

**Parcels** have a maximum weight of 2kg and a maximum combined dimension of 90cm, as well as some other restrictions. More importantly parcels are not insured and not trackable by default. For ~2 EUR you can add an insurance of 35 EUR.  
Sending a parcel from germany to the U.S. costs ~16 EUR.

**Packets** are traceable and by default insured for up to 500 EUR. The price varies from ~36 EUR for a 5kg packet to up to ~94 EUR for a 31kg packet.

----

**Regarding tracking and insurance**:  
I think this depends a lot on the situation in the receiving country. I haven't sent out many parcels lately, but a few years ago parcels to Ecuador and Costa Rica arrived fairly reliably.

Over the last year, I have sent out ~300 letters with DHL / Deutsche Post to various countries, ranging from Australia and Serbia to Canada and Brazil, and had 2 lost letters. Both heading to Florida and both send at the same time. I suspect that there was some overeager machinery, which ripped the label from the envelope.

The law doesn't allow for very much ""common sense"" in these matters, and it is frankly the laws and regulations are responsible for this, not the man or woman at the Border Agency.  The Border Agency has also been hugely defunded during austerity and cannot reasonably cope with their application load (it's also painfully bureaucratic, application for UK work permit: 80 pages; visa application for Swedish work permit: 5). 

The fact of the matter is that there is a systematic campaign to remove EU migrants from the UK and discourage them from coming and, should they actually come, encourage them to leave before they have a chance to earn settlement.

I don't think this is entirely correct. The campaign has always been for an opt out system not an opt in one. There is no law because the ISPs were told they should either do it themselves or parliament would legislate. So the filters change from ISP to ISP. To quote an article on the topic:

&gt;BT has announced that it will be asking all its existing broadband customers to opt out of its filtering system, even as concerns grow that said filters may do more harm than good.

&gt;Part of Prime Minister David Cameron's plan to add block-by-default filters to all UK internet connections, announced back in July, BT's revised Parental Controls system is enabled for all new customers who then have to manually opt out of the system. Early next year, however, BT will start to contact existing customers who signed up before the on-by-default filter system was enabled and ask them to explicitly state they want to receive adult content or else have the filter foisted upon them.

Existing customers will be asked but for new customers it will be assumed they will want the system unless they uncheck the box. ",0,1388770502,null,0,false,0,cegeu6i,t3_1uav6v,t1_cegeu6i,t1_cegcbhy,null,1431782934,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

My main issue is the opt out process, the second issue with this filter is that if there was a guarantee that it would be applied only, AND I MEAN ONLY to ""rape+porn"" I still would be fine with it on principle. But adding terms like gay or even terrorism is limiting the access of information gratuitously.

Also, PM potato head argued that access to the darknet and limiting access to child porn are reasons for the filter. This convinced me that the whole matter is just an excuse for censorship, people don't google child porn, for a wank, and the filter won't stop onion access. The chinese are putting a lot more effort than the brits and there still are ways to conceal tor traffic. Oh, and as a tangent to asia censorship, every restriction measure in the last years was ""sold"" to the public as a *moral* necessity.

Also I find it odd that morality is such a big issue considering the UK has basically no legal framework for pornography, this type of behavior of close everything down:

* won't reduce the demand for extreme pronography, you just create an incentive to monetize it for pedos that aren't tech savy

* won't reduce the number of pedophiles, only increase tehir frustration


* won't limit russian children filmed by albanians within the uk, 

....but including words like terrorism will give the government the power to censor news that might contradict the official point of view on sensitive matters, without any scrutiny or explanation.

(Also terrorist don't recruit using the word terrorism)

I don't have a defensible position, my political views are to radical to even try to argue with someone that comes from a position of common sense.

TL;DR from a sociological standpoint: this filter is in line with mainstream internet use, that is why people support it, because the age of 35 year old programmers and 15 year old ""pirates"" is gone, grandma and uncle tony use most of the bandwidth for skyping, (or whatever the old people are calling it these days).

The difference between this and that is competition law. Simple as that. Market regulations are passed by the government because they apply to all companies equally and no one is exempt from them.

The difference is that you block a website because you personally have visited it and know you want to block it. There is a slight risk that companies may take a broad interpretation as to what they may have the right to block.Plus the fact that you have to tell the company that you want to have the flitter off,which arguably is an invasion of privacy.

Like this for example : http://torrentfreak.com/uk-porn-filter-blocks-legitimate-file-sharing-services-and-torrentfreak-140103/ 

I'm not sure if that's factual or just speculation,but there is a risk of broad interpretations from companies as to how far they have the right to take this. Not to mention the potential abuse of power. Collateral damage is very likely to exist.

You only qualify for jobs that ~~Germans~~ EU nationals cannot fill. So its not a matter of finding a job you *can* do, its a matter of finding a job that *only* an American can do. 

A potential employer will have to sponsor you for a work visa. This means that he has to go to the Arbeitsagentur (the government agency responsible for finding work for the unemployed) and make the case that they have searched all over the region (or EU) and simply have to go outside of the EU to fill the position.  Then the Arbeitsagentur gets six weeks (or six months if they like) to search all their unemployment offices for an EU national that could do the job. If they find one, and believe me they will try, you don't get your visa.

 You might be the best graphic designer in the world with fluent german, but I can name three unemployed GDs on unemployment right now that want your job. Unless you are an Engineer, Chemist, Medical or the like, you only qualify for jobs that say ""Native American English Speaking Required"".  Its not impossible. there are ways.  But you need to understand the specific nature of your challenge.

J'imagine qu'un truc pareil provoquerait une renaissance de la télévision. Un programme fichu comme ça pourrait durer plus de dix ans, avec assez d'événements ponctuels pour fournir des primes pendant de nombreuses années (arrivée, premier bâtiment construit, premier passage de Phobos à l'horizon, première tempête de sable, etc). Ca serait du pain béni pour des annonceurs et des chaines de télévision.

Pour le retour d'une télé intelligente, ça le serait moins. Je préfère relire le Magnus Opus de Kim Stanley Robinson.

Now there's a porn filter, that's all fine and dandy. We don't want little Timmy typing ""penis"" into Google for shits and giggles and suddenly finding himself in the middle of a hardcore porn site, now do we?

But what if they start adding small things to this porn filter? Animal abuse videos? Videos of people being shot?

To protect the children, of course. That makes sense. You can simply opt out if you do want to see it!

But then they start adding filters to more stuff. Some obscure websites of local communist parties for example that clashed with the police a couple of times. We all know communism is bad, right? No need for impressionable kids to be subjected to vile thoughts about a system like that. When they're old enough they can decide for themselves. Anyone else that does want to see it can simply opt out, right?

But are parents that opt out of the filter bad parents? Why would a good dad or mom want to view videos of people getting shot, look op communistic parties, or watch porn? Are they influencing their children with vile websites? Every child nowadays has a smartphone. Parents can't always control those. 

Mandatory filters are now in effect for all homes with children in them. It's for the wee little children, right?

Half the nation cannot research communist parties or watch porn.

This has created a situation where being Christian is now largely considered a cultural tradition, while government in many cases continues to offer formal institutional organisation of religion.

true,fruchtzergeis,null,null,"Yeah, sure. Basically, you can't know the outcome of the GDP per capita of a country if it was and if it was not in the EU/Eurozone. Thus, you can't claim anything like 'due to the Euro, France/Italy etc have a lower GDP' because you don't know the outcome without the Euro (the so called counterfactual) for example. 

In another example: on reddit, we have a lot of people claiming 'the Dutch have lower Marihuana consumption compared to other countries, even though consumption is legalized.' So legalization leads to lower drug consumption. This does not need to be necessarily wrong, but is not necessarily right either. What we need here is a counter-factual, for example a second Netherlands, where everything is exactly the same (very important) EXCEPT that this 'second' Netherlands does forbid Marihuana consumption, whereas the 'first' Netherlands does not forbid it. With this counter-factual, it is possible for us to compare the outcome of a policy appropriately. 

In medicine, one usually uses randomized controlled trials to measure the effect of a new drug. Since everyone is different and the method of randomization (so giving the medicine randomly across the sample) will effectively 'randomize out' individual differences. Thus, through this method we can exactly pinpoint the effect of a new drug. 

But because it is hard to create a whole 'twin' country in order to measure the effect of a new policy (drug legalization, or joining the Eurozone), it is hard to claim any effect of a policy. If we simply, naively, look at some figures and say 'in 1970, when it was not legalized, drug consumption was 10%. In 1990, they legalized it and it is 5% in 2010', we don't account for the counter-factual. Claiming that legalization made drug consumption drop by 5% is naive. What if, in the hypothetical second Netherlands, we have statistics that say ''in 1970, when it was not legalized, drug consumption was 10%. In 1990, they legalized it and it is 2% in 2010'. Using this counter-factual, we can claim that drug legalization *actually increased* drug consumption by 3%, even though it dropped in both Netherlands. 

Whenever statistics like that occur, one must always ask: what would the outcome be if this policy was not in place? It is hard to answer this question, but it can sometimes be answered if we are lucky to have so-called ['natural experiments'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment). In economics especially, one can use [difference-in-difference methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment) to measure a policy with a counter-factual, which requires conditions which natural experiments are said to fulfill sufficiently. One of such is the [Duflo study](http://economics.mit.edu/files/726) (2004), which measures the return of education on income. [Duflo](http://economics.mit.edu/files/5993) et al(2013) also pioneered the usage of randomized controlled trials in economics, where they, with the assistance of the microfinance institute Spandana, measured the effect of microfinance. 

I can talk about the importance of a counter-factual for hours. Whenever I see claims which 'use statistics' without a proper counter-factual, I facepalm. You don't use statistics, you simply take some numbers and figures to 'validate' your point in an improper fashion. I see this bad statistics on reddit a lot, but also on many newspaper articles and, unfortunately, quite a few academic papers.",0,1388791793,null,0,1388792274,0,cegoi50,t3_1ubigl,t1_cegoi50,t1_cegmwtk,null,1431787631,7,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,7

All education was initially meant as a way of preparing people for the various tasks a country needed done (be it in factories, hospitals, research labs or embassies).

Oh, the Danes who make up less than 1% of the German population, and the Sorbs who have the same numbers? Terribly important minorities, there! Ethnic Germans make up 80% of Germany's population. It's not as homogeneous as Poland, but don't let's pretend that Germany has any seriously important minorities other than the Turks. And the Turks are just that: they are Turks.

High skilled workers are always welcome in our country. We need them. Heck, Germany was rebuilt with the help of Italians and Turkish people. And Germany is today very multicultural and we embrace other cultures to a certain degree. 

But, some people are coming here just because we have a tight social net, which would benefit people that never worked here. We even have Romanian/Bulgarian immigrants here that buy children from Sinti and Roma just to abuse the children benefits that they can get. For each child, you get a certain amount of money from the state. And there have been cases where this was in evidence. 

So it is not really fear of job seekers, but fear of having more criminals in the country and being able to do more against it. I totally understand this to a certain degree. But we should not turn away people just because there are a few bad apples. We need the tools to throw criminal people out permanently though and have laws on a EU basis that would make it illegal for them to reenter the country they committed crimes in.

When shipping abroad from Germany, use [**Tomba Express**](http://tomba-express.com/). Unlike DHL, the shipping rate is accurately calculated according to the weight and every kilogram counts. With DHL, you pay flat rates for 2, 5, 10 and 20 kgs which is often way too expensive. Plus, your package is actually still shipped through DHL, you just pay less.

Tomba Express achieves these lower shipping rate by combining many shipments to one country, then handling the freight in bulk over to DHL which saves them money.

I successfully used Tomba Express already. They are as fast and reliable as DHL, just much cheaper. Sent a 11 kgs package from Germany to Brazil and paid around 60 Euros instead of 90 Euros. Plus, they are a small and nice company which need to be supported. I even talked to the company's boss on the phone already since I was wondering how they could afford to offer such low rates and he explained their business model to me like I explained above.
