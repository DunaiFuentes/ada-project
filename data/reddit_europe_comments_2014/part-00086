&gt; Pour une bonne raison, la paix ne pourra exister que lorsque la haine existentielle qu'ont les arabes contre l'existence même d’Israël n'existera plus. Parce qu'il suffit d'un volontaire pour faire une guerre, comme le prouve la guerre proprement asymétrique de Gaza avec ce mur et ses armes défensives comme Iron Dome.

Premier argument type : Nous voulons la paix mais elle n'est possible que si tous les arabes reconnaissent, respectent l'Etat d'Israël.

C'est un des arguments type que l'on entend beaucoup. Quand tous les pays arabes de la planète et chacun de leur habitants reconnaîtront, respecteront, aimeront presque, l'Etat d'Israël, ce dernier pensera à la paix. Israël ne s'est pas fait beaucoup d'amis dans la région, donc autant dire qu'il n'y aura pas de paix selon ses termes (pas beaucoup d'amis non plus parmi les peuples du monde, d'où la volonté de ""lutter contre les préjugés"").

&gt; Bref, je replace juste le contexte en disant que les Israéliens ne font QUE SE défendre...

Deuxième argument : Israël ne fait que se défendre

Sans commentaires. Tellement ironique. Seppuku.

&gt; Je n'ai pas peur de le dire, je trouve normal qu’Israël réplique sur les sites de lancement de roquettes et construise un mur pour empêcher les Palestiniens de commettre des attentats. Je ne m'en réjouis pas, mais c'est mieux que les dits attentats.

Enfin je finis par ce que j'attends de te dire depuis le début, Hadok, je n'ai pas de haine, ni contre toi ni contre les israéliens, et je pense par moi même. Donc pourquoi penser que ceux qui dénoncent haïssent forcément? Pourquoi se sentir haïr et détesté par autrui? A ce que je sache on discute, on ne s'insulte pas? Je suis honnête sois le aussi.

Si on prend l'exemple de [Gollnisch](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affaire_des_propos_de_Bruno_Gollnisch_d%27octobre_2004) en 2004, on a affaire à une condamnation politique.

Le truc est arrivé sur instruction du garde des Sceaux, avec suspension par le ministre de l'éducation François Fillon, et ensuite un véritable harcèlement judiciaire. 

Pourtant le procureur de la République de Lyon avait conclu que Bruno Gollnisch ne pouvait être poursuivi et le juge d'instruction avait refusé la mise en examen et ordonné un non-lieu.

Malgré cela, une commission de discipline, le Conseil d'État (encore lui), une cour en première instance et encore une autre en appel vont le condamner, son immunité ayant été levée par le Parlement européen (en violation des règles en cours).

Au final, il a été innocenté par la cour de cassation, qui a jugé que les condamnations étaient non fondées, mais le mal était fait.

Joking aside . . you realize that Greece is a soverign country correct? Not everything greece does has to be approved by Germany, although it does seem that way. 

This is an investment strategy on multiple fronts. 

1. Tourism industry - People cannot be seperated by the internet in the modern day without going through withdrawls. People who go to Greece from now, will view it as a major positive that they can be on the beach/museum/etc and have access to the internet to share stuff with friends and communicate. 

 Greece's best Tourism strategy is making the experience so good that the people who go tell their friends about their positive experience and then they go also, this strategy has been working for Greece for many decades and this is just another aspect of it. 

2. Athens/Thessaloniki are going to be major Technology hubs in the coming decade, this 1st step is to build the groundwork so most start-ups can get to work and more young people have the tools to learn and develop.

The model to dictate elements of healthcare opposes the one of there being no need for this enforcement. Compulsory vaccination is, for good reason, a very limited practice.

Individuals being in need for medical advise should be able to consult and trust their local experts which, in most cases, would be the role of 	family doctors.

Needless to say that, if you have a certain part of the ""parent generation"" sticking to questionable ideologies and/or celebrated ignorance interfering with their kid's health, there's a point in enforcing reasonable precautions.

Serbs didn't do anything wrong. How the hell are we to blame that the West insisted on Yugoslavia having to break up? The Muslims in the south commited genocide and got away with it. Now that they're a majority they get a country.

The Catholics in the west also commited genocide on us, no one remembers that. We tried to defend our people both from the West and from Catholic Slavs and we're the bad guys? We only ever *defended* ourselves. How many offensive attacks do we have to take before defending?

The West is consistently trying to destroy Slavs (and the Orthodox culture), again, how are we supposed to defend ourselves?

You got downvoted because of the depth of stupidity of your comment. C'mon read it: *Almost every government has people who have some kind of ties to the native mafia of their own country. Is this really news?*

I don't even go into the incorrectness of your first sentence, but YES it is news that the newly Russian installed puppet PM with only 4% election support in Crimea has an organized crime background. 

It may be not news to YOU. You may have long ago known that the Russian installed puppet 'the Goblin' has ties with organized crime. But news it is, especially with new evidence.

Another, and more important reason for the downvotes is the obvious Soviet era propaganda [whattaboutism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_you_are_lynching_Negroes) in that comment.

Et toi tu ignores des documents envoyés à des millions de Français où l'essentiel est censé être affiché, et où les mots ""euro"" et ""Europe"" ne figurent pas. 

&gt; L'Europe est un continent, une notion géographique. L'UE est une association politique d'États.

Les militants FN disent à l'UPR qu'elle ferait mieux de fusionner avec le FN parce que les deux partis ont les mêmes objectifs. Ils s'offusquent lorsque l'ont dit qu'au contraire nous n'avons pas les mêmes objectifs puisque le FN ne veut pas sortir de l'UE et de l'euro, qu'ils veulent comme tout le monde une ""autre Europe"".

Si le FN voulait vraiment sortir, il n'y aurait aucune raison de mentionner *une Europe* dans son programme, puisque ce que la France fera ce qui la regarde, et l'UE fera ce qui le regarde son côté aussi. Ca révèle bien que le FN qui tape sur l'Europe ne veut finalement pas en sortir.

&gt; Dans votre tête, il est impossible de négocier, la France n'a pas de poids, aucune influence. En fait vous méprisez la France.

N'importe quoi.  Pour rappel, c'est **De Gaulle** [qui disait qu'il n'y aurait pas de politique possible en Europe à cause des intérêts nationaux divergents, et que les Etas se tourneraient vers un fédérateur extérieur à l'Europe qui lui aurait une politique](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stUH3JZZSH4). 

C'est justement ce qui s'est passé, et il n'y avait que 6 Etats-membres à l'époque, dont 3 minuscules (Bénélux), une Italie assombrie par Mussolini et l'Allemagne coupée en deux pestiférée mondiale à cause de Hitler. De Gaulle méprisait la France quand il disait ça ? Réfléchis deux secondes...

&gt; Mais bien sûr, il faut être clair et exiger de la précision, mais seulement quand ça vous arrange.

L'UPR est précise et claire comme l'exigent ses adhérents, tu acceptes sans broncher que le FN dise tout et son contraire *passkecéleFNkiledi*.

&gt; Philippot pareil. Ce n'est pas un argument.

Tiens je l'avais oublié lui : [""Sur le fond, notre position n’a jamais varié : nous sommes résolument opposés au droit de vote des étrangers.

Cohérence où es-tu ? Ah, finalement yen a pas besoin, le FN dit que finalement c'est bien la citoyenneté européenne. Et si c'est le FN qui le dit, c'est qu'il a raison, même quand il se contredit.

&gt; Sur l'avortement, on propose la fin du remboursement. Il n'y a rien de choquant. Sur la peine de mort, on propose un référendum. Rien de choquant non plus à part peut-être chez les petits bourgeois bohème.

Il n'y a rien de choquant *selon toi*, faut te mettre dans la tête qu'il y a des Français qui ne pensent pas comme toi sur ces sujets minables et que tu perds ainsi leur vote. Ils sont déjà assez divisés sur l'UE et l'euro qui sont les véritables sujets stratégiques, comment est-ce que tu ne vois pas que rien n'est plus stupide de les diviser davantage sur des conneries pareilles quand on sait les problèmes que posent l'UE et l'euro ?

&gt; L'importance d'une chose est subjective. La sécurité, l'immigration, l'emploi, le logement, voilà des sujets que le FN a jugés plus importants.

Ca montre son incompétence, voire sa malhôneteté. Les immigrés ne décident pas du taux de change externe de l'euro, de l'interdiction d'emprunter à sa propre banque nationale, du déficit budgétaire maximal, de la libre-circulation des capitaux à l'intérieur de l'UE et entre l'UE et les pays tiers, de la désorganisation du service public, de l'alignement du prix des produits de l'agriculture sur les prix mondiaux, de l'appartenance à l'OTAN etc. 

L'immigration peut créer des problèmes tout en ayant ses avantages, et il convient de laisser le choix aux Français mais une fois qu'ils se soient d'abord rassemblé sur l'essentiel décrit juste au-dessus.

Les dérapages arrivent partout, c'est le traitement médiatique qui est différent. Le problème c'est les médias, pas les dérapages.

&gt;Est-ce que les communistes et ceux qui ont retourné leur veste disaient à De Gaulle après l'avoir rejoint qu'il fallait négocier avec Vichy et Hitler ?

Je te rappelle ta phrase d'origine :

""nous refusons toute alliance avec des partis avec lesquels nous sommes en désaccord sur les points les fondamentaux et stratégiques pour l'avenir de notre pays ; nous respectons nos électeurs en refusant toute auberge espagnole politicarde"".

Donc l'alliance avec les communistes n'aurait pas dû se faire ?

À l'inverse, si l'objectif est de sortir de l'UE, alors l'UPR doit se regrouper avec le FN.

Un peu de logique ne ferait pas de mal.

&gt;N'importe quoi. Je disais que pour être cohérent avec ce que le FN dit, JMLP aurait du refuser de s'allier avec l'UMP, or ça n'est pas ce qu'il dit puisqu'il trouve que s'alllier avec l'UMP est une chose logique.

Non. Tu as menti en tronquant une citation, en omettant délibérément la partie où JMLP dit que ce n'est pas forcément possible, et que c'est uniquement pour empêcher d'autres pires d'être élus dans les scrutins à deux tours, donc uniquement pour les municipales.

Tu fais croire qu'il évoque une alliance nationale alors qu'il s'agit de cas particuliers après le premier tour. Bref, tu es malhonnête.

&gt;C'est faux puisque le nombre d'adhérents et de sympathisants UPR ne cesse de croître

Le nombre de chômeurs ne cesse de croître... Le nombre d'adhérents à Égalité &amp; Réconciliation ne cesse de croître, le nombre d'adhérents au FN et à DLR ne cesse de croître... Ton raisonnement n'a aucun sens.

&gt;il propose de rétablir la peine de mort par exemple, beaucoup d'entre eux se disent sortie de UE = FN = rétablir peine de mort, donc sortir UE = truc réac extrême droite.

Ah oui, le mépris de l'énarque pour le petit peuple qui n'est pas capable de faire la part des choses. Classique.

I disagree. I know we like to present the Russian leadership as crazy, and to a large extend they are, but there's no good reason to assume that the hesitation to use nuclear weapons holds for the west but not Russia.

All bets are off if they were invaded, but if they start a conventional war with NATO - which in itself is extremely unlikely considering it didn't happen during the Cold War when they might actually have had a chance - they will certainly do so with the understanding that they will not turn it nuclear if they begin to lose it.

lulz [How do you think they made it to the trial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radislav_Krsti%C4%87#Arrest_and_trial)? ;) 
&gt;American troops and politicians haven't, and they should. The law is pointless if it's only enforced unilaterally. Its purpose is not to bring justice then, but to exploit the weaker countries, making political rulings which establish collective guilt and legitimize illegal wars by superpowers.



I don't remember us ethnically cleansing Iraqis and Afghans....but I do remember Saddam ethnically cleansing Kurds and the Taliban doing some pretty fucked up shit in the 90s......

&gt;US not only does not recognize the international war crimes court ICC, but instead engaged on an active campaign to sign bilateral treaties with countries to have their troops immune from prosecution there. Doubly hypocrisy.

Like I said...where did we ethnically cleanse people again? [And I'm glad we don't prosecute soldiers and give them life sentences for war crimes](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/23/afghanistan-massacre-robert-bales-trial). 

Also, why is it illegal and a war crime to sign a bilateral treaty? Treaties we don't force on people? If you remember, Iraq *chose* not to sign and we *left* without throwing a fuss. :) 

&gt;And bombing a sovereign country without UNSC authorization is not an aggressive military campaign according to you? What is then - perhaps an act of self-defense? I didn't know there was a significant American enclave in Serbia. 

Eh, like I said, it was a humanitarian intervention, but even if people do consider it a war crime, fuck off, *lulz* if it's a war crime to stop people from slaughtering innocent civilians than consider my country guilty. :) I'll swallow that charge with pride. 

&gt;Spare us of Orwellian doublespeak - it's better described at ""responsibility to bomb whomever the fuck Americans want"". But don't worry - those days are drawing to a close. With Barry in charge, you don't need enemies ;)

You mean the Barry who just maneuvered Ukraine away from Russia's Eurasian Union and is moving to contain China with a comprehesive military and economic shift towards the Pacific? The one who's every intervention has been U.N. authorized or is asked for by the reigning and legitimate government? The one who didn't bomb Syria, but managed to get chemical weapons out of there? That one? ;) 

Barry's doing just fine dude; much better than Stjepan Mesić or Slobodan Milošević, that's for damn sure. :) 

&gt;Are you talking about Kosovo Serbs kidnapped and organ-harvested by the terrorist organization KLA? Oh wait..

When did I every indicate otherwise? Tell me, were the massacres and war crimes going on at the same rate they were after NATO intervened? 

No?

1. UKIP says 75%
2. Ms. Viviane Reding says 70%
3. Germany Study says 84%
4. At least 50%

According to [FullFact](https://fullfact.org/europe/eu_make_uk_law-29587):

&gt;*""In 2010, the House of Commons library published comprehensive analysis of the variety of ways this percentage can be calculated. There are difficulties with all measurements, but they concluded “it is possible to justify any measure between 15% and 50% or thereabouts”.*

&gt;*The figures depend on which UK law is included in the calculation, and the extent of ‘EU influence’ that we look at*. **There is no single interpretation of UK law**, *it can include: Acts put in place by the UK Parliament; rules and regulations drawn up by Ministers; and regulations produced by the EU which apply here in the UK.*

So it depends on how you measure it. I'd be inclined to take the 50% figure at least to demonstrate to the public the extent of the EU's influence over the country's laws in comparison with the fact the last referendum held in 1975 was about ""Staying IN the EEC (Common Market)"" and since that economic relationship the extent to which it has become a political-legal and economic relationship - that requires a referendum on.",0,1395870801,null,0,false,0,cgcqgpq,t3_21frx1,t1_cgcqgpq,t1_cgcosha,null,1433082649,12,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,12

The democratic argument for it (polls by people and time since 1975 and changes since then) is too huge to ignore now, especially due to UKIP's rising influence over setting the policy agenda of the other parties (mostly Conservatives but increasingly Labour and somewhat Lib Dems eg Clegg's challenge).
3. Hopefully both have improved their profile with their own voters. I want to see a 4-party system emerge and would be happy if Lib Dems gain the pro-EU votes and UKIP all the eurosceptic votes off both Conservatives and Labour: I think from that pov both parties could win.
4. Farage appears to have convinced more but I think Clegg will have gained some votes so it's more a question of Farage gaining more (publicity) but Clegg also gaining (publicity).

Am British person; am sorry for my people's repression of India and other places.

Whilst I played no part in what actually happened to the subjects of the British empire, I reap the benefits of our colonial passed and am the result of a culture which did some pretty bad things (yeah, yeah, we were the nicest bad guys on the block, but we still took over their countries, even if someone else would have just done it anyway).

People are more than just themselves. You are your culture and your culture is you. Your culture stretches back hundreds if not thousands of years. You are the product of it, as well as the conclusion to it.

I'm also a cosmopolitan and believe that I am the product of all humanity, as well as more primarily a European and a Briton. 

We might not all be responsible for what everyone else has done, but we are connected to everyone else's evil deeds. We owe it to the world and to humanity to fix the mistakes of others, both passed and present. Often, mending things means apologising. Sometimes those that were best placed to apologise have passed on, which means it falls to the next most connected, and the next to do so. Eventually that leads to virtually any member of your culture or society who's alive. Which is why I see it as my duty to at least apologise for the misdeeds of my my culture, my society and my history, where appropriate. It's our job and our duty to make the world a better place.

There was no megalomaniac plan to get rid of all the Palestinians in few short years, attracting unwanted attention. No, they dragged it out into decades and that way the world didn't take notice.

Actually, if Israel had just expelled all the Arabs in the 60s the way that Poland and Czechia had expelled all the Germans, they could have made a plausible claim to be the legitimate successor state to the Mandate of Palestine but simultaneously refuse outright to take any Arab refugees back. The Arabs would still be pissed, but the outside world wouldn't really care, since Israel would be basically an ethnically homogeneous state and it wouldn't be ""occupying"" anyone.

The fact that Israel is *daily* condemned by the world community while everyone has pretty much gotten over the ethnic cleansing of Germans from Poland and Czechia, of Serbs from Croatia, etc., actually leads to the *opposite* conclusion of what you have said. If you have an unruly minority that constantly embarrasses you diplomatically: get rid of it. Kill it or just expel it, whatever. People will forgive a mass expulsion after 20 years, but people won't forgive a 20-year-old occupation if it's still going on.

Almost all of them were arrested and extradited by the Serbian government, and some even went on their own (Seselj). Your link is an isolated and unrepresentative case.

&gt;I don't remember us ethnically cleansing Iraqis and Afghans....but I do remember Saddam ethnically cleansing Kurds and the Taliban doing some pretty fucked up shit in the 90s......

There is absolutely no difference between ethnic cleansing and illegally invading, bombing and droning sovereign countries. Ooops, there is one difference - the latter is against international law. In both cases you get casualties measurable in hundreds of thousands.

&gt;Like I said...where did we ethnically cleanse people again?

So the illegal wars are ok if they are for oil and resource control, and not for nationalism or religion? OK, gotcha.

&gt; And I'm glad we don't prosecute soldiers and give them life sentences for war crimes. 

The few get convicted on kangaroo military courts, receiving symbolic penalties. Cheney and Bush should've been tried in Haag like Milosevic.

&gt;Also, why is it illegal and a war crime to sign a bilateral treaty?

It's not illegal - but it's immoral to blackmail countries into signing such treaties with arms deals and foreign aid, and later claim moral high ground and demand that others be subject to ""international law"".

&gt;If you remember, Iraq chose not to sign and we left without throwing a fuss. :) 

Yeah after you starved half a million to death in sanctions, and sacked the country two times. Now that the occupiers are gone, Iraq must be finally ushering in an era of immeasurable prosperity, where peace-loving law-abiding citizens democratically and transparently elect their politicians to lead them into the bright future. Oh wait, they're still stuck in sectarian/religious violence that predates America, car-bombing one another and casualties are rising on a rate not seen from the days of Chemical Ali...

&gt;Eh, like I said, it was a humanitarian intervention, but even if people do consider it a war crime, fuck off, lulz if it's a war crime to stop people from slaughtering innocent civilians than consider my country guilty. :) I'll swallow that charge with pride. 

Russians recently also had a ""humanitarian intervention"" and the Eastern Europe went batshit crazy. They also don't give a fuck what others think.

&gt;You mean the Barry who just maneuvered Ukraine away from Russia's Eurasian Union 

Barry is literally too stupid and uneducated to do anything that doesn't involve reading from a telepromter. After elections Ukraine will reposition itself back in the Russian sphere of influence, and by that time hopefully the coup-assigned Jew bankster serving as a prime minister will not sell 45 million people into perpetual debt slavery to his fellow Jew banksters at IMF (and will hopefully be hanged for his crimes before he escapes to Israel if he does so).

&gt;and is moving to contain China with a comprehesive military and economic shift towards the Pacific?

China is pissing in the face of puppet Barry. They're about to sign the landmark gas deal with Russia worth trillions over decades, and can't be bothered by American incompetence to stage a failed colored revolution, for the second time in ten years in the same county. I hope the next govt will make a quick kill of that corrupt Russophobic psychopathic Jew cunt Tymoshenko as well.

&gt;The one who's every intervention has been U.N. authorized or is asked for by the reigning and legitimate government?

Bombed citizens of Libya beg to disagree. Of course, no fly zone = license to bomb in US parlance. I forgot :P

&gt; The one who didn't bomb Syria, but managed to get chemical weapons out of there? That one? ;) 

Uhm that was Putin's maneuver - Barry and the MIC wanted to bomb the shit out of Syria because they crossed some kind of line. Plus I've heard that the US-armed Islamic terrorists (I mean ""freedom fighters"") are sustaining heavy losses these days from Assad's forces these days...sorry, no Islamic puppet-state for you in Syria Uncle Sam! Syria remains secular and progressive country.

&gt;Barry's doing just fine dude; much better than Stjepan Mesić or Slobodan Milošević, that's for damn sure. :) 

Barry will be renumbered as the first US teleprompter-president. Clueless on international matters, weak as a leader, lying to the American public, failing to close Guantanamo, supporting the CIA assassinations via drones, failing to contain the domestic spying  apparatus ... He's a disgrace for the leader of the ""free world"".

&gt;Tell me, were the massacres and war crimes going on at the same rate they were after NATO intervened? 

And yet Russian reunification of Crimea was completely bloodless and the West went crazy (screaming ""annexation, annexation!"") because it was not according to the law. Law which the West conveniently ignores when it suits them for ""higher causes"".

The truth is, were it not for the illegal Nato intervention, the cumulative damage (economic and human) incurred by the normal continuation of the civilian war at Kosovo could just as likely be less than that of the illegal Nato bombing campaign. Too bad the trigger-happy Germans couldn't wait. After all those years Luftwaffe *finally* bombing Belgrade, just like the good old times ;-)

It really isn't about the helmets, its about fighting against some perceived ridiculousness of laws protecting people from themselves.  I'm sure this gets conflated with the abundance of warning labels in common law jurisdictions. 

In this case, there are American state laws for children wearing helmets, but the jerk here went to ""stupid Americans scared of everything.""  The jerk was not limited to Americans, was also directed at Australians and Finns, and a few others.  I'm not aware of any American state laws requiring adults to wear helmets on bicycles, and many states do not require motorcyclists to wear helmets. 

Looking on this now, it appears to really be folks from the Netherlands defending a distinct and central aspect of their culture and identity, i.e. bicycling.  This is not unlike some Americans and gun culture.  So this jerk was ""You Nazis are aren't going to make me wear a helmet!""  Analogous to the ""You socialist motherfuckers aren't going to take my guns!""  So that got turned into ""Helmets are worthless,"" which is the analogous to ""Everyone should own automatic weapons.""  Analogous in terms of logic, otherwise not similar at all. 

To me this is a bit confusing, because I often see a strong Western European penchant for regulating for consumer rights and for safety regulations.  But when it comes to a nations culture, I suppose that is overridden.  

It reminds me of my friend Italian cousin who lived here (NYC) for three months.  She LOVED that mayor Bloomberg was trying to ban large sodas, because of fat people.  Ten minutes later we go to a bar, where she finds out you are not allowed to smoke inside.  ""What kind of police state it this!!  You are supposed to be free here?!?!?""  She was pretty pissed.

IMF recommendations for Ukraine have been phasing out the gas subsidies *with accompanied measures to protect the most vulnerable households*, revamping the judicial system, simplifying or repealing burdensome government regulations, stepping up anti-corruption measures, and enforcing clear and consistent rules in tax administration. 

I don't think anyone wants people to have no heating. But when 7-8% of public spending goes in such subsidies as in Ukraine it's the obvious place to cut. And in fact it would be cheaper to compensate the cuts by rising pensions and such accordingly.

Similarly, the attitudes towards military differ greatly within the EU. For instance the UK are more militarily interventionist, Greece and Eastern Europe are focused on invasion deterrent, where Germany is generally isolationist.

true,OWKuusinen,FINL,"Terijoki, Finland","&gt;&gt;But protesters were also painted as communists in the West. And being painted as a communist could make you unemployable or even get you shot.

&gt;Not always and protests did influence policy. A good example of someone emerging from the protest movement whose career wasn't harmed was the former German Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer.


True. I was probably thinking USA (and two-party systems in general) when I wrote the above. In a multiparty state even the votes of the protesters would be enough to rise representatives to the parliament. Once there, their views are somewhat validated by their position and they can try to gain larger consideration.

&gt;I would agree that conscription per se is not wrong, but when it is used to ensure a compliant population, it is not so good. This was actually the whole ""Service Guarantees Citizenship"" thing from Heinlein's Starship Troopers.

Heinlein's story apparently relied on the fact that the government was in war. So service meant decision to fight abroad in hope of surviving and gaining citizenship. Compare to US ""Service guarantees education"" and ""service guarantees employment""-pitches. In both systems the amount of soldiers compared to the population is fairly small. So it's possible to continue living your life ""normally"" even if the country is at war.

On the other hand, when conscription involves the whole population and also the reserve, you can't keep a peace-time society running while also being at war. Not only because of lack of resources, but because war itself means that most men  (iirc, every man between 18-45 or to 65 if you're officer) would be on the field. So going to war needs the consensus of most of the voting block.

Which leads to..

&gt;You do your service, you are taught to defend Finland but you do not exit thinking everything that your government says is correct, there is a big distinction between government and country.

The trained soldier moves to reserve knowing he's prepared to fight a war that can't be started without he voting for it or at least without public consensus (as measured by gallup) backing the course. So the government that oversees his training isn't the government that would decide if he will be asked to serve. I'd say this view blurs the line of government, nation and it's population. Most Finns don't really do a distinction between these three (this being my personal opinion, not a study). 

&gt;Many Russians were loathe to report problems under the Soviet System, but they did happen.

I know. This is a problem with all systems. But Soviet crime reporting system wasn't immediatelly rehauled (or, perhaps, rehauled at all or not rehauled to the better) after the fall of bolshevism. And even if it was, people wouldn't have thought so. So immediate jump (and even a general trend upward afterward) would tell us that the people who DID report crime before 1990 reported crime after 1990 as well -- and they did more of it.

I remember also reading that even today Russian police aren't particularly enthusiastic in cataloguing crime where you don't have clear evidence on who to blame.

&gt;I wouldn't say what the US did was particularly right either, but

If your last name was Vestrati, then a Latvian wouldn't know how to say ""to Vestrati"" or ""of Vestrati"". It doesn't work with the language's grammar.

true,demfrecklestho,trentino,null,"Beware- Italy is very big and the North and the South differ greatly as regards eating traditions. So I'm mostly referring to the northeastern part, traditions may vary elsewhere.

Carnevale - several sweet treats, mostly fried, some of which are called with different names in different parts of Italy; Chiacchiere/grostoli/frappe/bugie are the most relevant. On the Wednesday following the last day of carnival (which always lands on a Tuesday- Martedì grasso) some people don't eat candy or meat.

Halloween - introduced recently in our culture, kids go trick-or-treating, people buy candy and that's it. No pumpkin madness (seriously I've been to Canada and for the whole month of october everything has pumpkin in it).

On New Year's Eve, Christmas and the Epiphany most families tend to have big meals all together, but there isn't really something which is iconic like turkey is on Thanksgiving- every family has its own traditions. Panettone and Pandoro are cakes which are often eaten during the Christmas holidays.

On Easter, people often eat lamb. Kids have their chocolate eggs, which are bigger than those you usually hunt in North American culture. Colomba (dove) is a bird-shaped cake which is very common during this time of the year. During lent, some people give up meat on Fridays but it's a lot less common practice than it used to be. Still some places don't offer meat dishes especially on Good Friday.

The other holidays you listed are either relatively recent holidays (Liberation day, Labour day and Republic Day) or saint patrons days. Pretty much every city in Italy has a city holiday which matches a certain saint's day. For example, Trento has St. Vigilius, towards the end of June. So every city has its own tradition on that topic.

true,CreepyOctopus,LATV,Latvia | Sweden,"Latvia has been very heavily influenced by German culture, and even now many Latvian names are of obvious partial German origins. Lots of names that end with -bergs. So there's a system that seems fairly consistent.

Kreuzberg would become Kreicbergs, Mahler would be Mālers, Neumann would be Neimans, Fischer would be Fišers, etc. This is natural as Latvian writing itself evolved from German, for instance long vowels in earlier Latvian writing were indicated by adding h (like in German), so what is now written as Mālers would have been written as Mahlers in the 19th century.

Not so sure about other foreign names, but I know that at least in the 19th century the same suffixes as now were used for Lithuanian or Russian names. Russian names mostly got ovs/evs suffixes like Meškovs or Andrejevs, Lithuanian names also have had a system where their -unas suffix changes to -ūns, -skas to -sks, etc.

This again makes sense because Latvia has obviously had a lot of interaction with Lithuanians, Russians, Germans, Poles and others from nearby countries historically. The modern problem arises with names from more distant countries, which have always been uncommon enough so that no real system emerged. Say, Indian or Bangladeshi names. Many common names from that region have a format that's difficult to use in Latvian, and historically exposure has been so low that no real (at least widely known) system has emerged.",0,1395878273,null,0,false,0,cgctx3k,t3_21empg,t1_cgctx3k,t1_cgcth79,null,1433084277,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

Maybe you can assimilate into another body of water and try to critique the one that you came from the new one. However, then you critique it using only the distorted goggles of your new culture, and you end up in the same situation from which you began.

true,Deusdies,EART,Earth,"&gt; The actions of the Serbian military in Croatia and Bosnia was completely legitimate and necessary. If the Bosniaks and Croats were so keen on self determination why did they not respect the Serbs right to self determination within their own territories?

So this is what we've come as people. You believed the bullshit propaganda Milosevic was spitting out. No, the actions our military took were **not** legitimate, as per the 1974 Constitution of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, which was in force at the time. If you read it carefully, you will see that there are articles which enable the republics and provinces to secede should they choose to do so in a referendum. This is why adopting this constitution took YEARS, basically, because there was strong opposition to it.

&gt; why did they not respect the Serbs right to self determination within their own territories?

Because they did not have the legal right (the Const guaranteed it only for the republics and provinces and their present borders). If you don't remember the adoption of the 1974 Constitution, or don't know much about it, look it up. Shocking, I know, and even I thought until recently that the military call was legal and understandable, *until* I read the Constitution and saw that the republics and territories had a perfectly legal right to secede, based on their current borders.",0,1395884634,null,0,false,0,cgcwt66,t3_21fsbv,t1_cgcwt66,t1_cgcni5p,null,1433085639,8,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,8

Its really hard to tell with the navy because we operate different types of ship and have different focuses. The US has about 7 times more submarines, only 1.5 times more frigates and after the 2 new carriers enter service in the UK the US will have 5 times as many carriers but about 20 times more aircraft on them and many more support ships. 

The USAF is about 4 times larger than the RAF in terms of aircraft but about 10 times larger in terms of personnel. 

All in all the UK's military is not really that disproportionately smaller except in some areas when you compare it to the size of the economy. But with the cost of equipment these days that only really buys you enough to project power in certain places not everywhere. You could probably pull off an invasion of another medium sized country with 82,000 troops but if you face serious casualties your strength will drain fast and there will be more casualties. To quote James Gandolphini in the film In The Loop 'at the end of a war you need some soldiers left, really, or else it looks like you've lost'. With 2% of a European budget it's questionable what you could actually do unilaterally.

6 X self propelled artillery guns, [2S19 MSTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2S19_Msta), caliber 152mm. It is not a tank. The best Russian self propelled artillery gun it is though. It's NBC protected.

2 x self propelled anti-aircraft vehicles [Tunguska 9K22](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K22_Tunguska). It has 2 x 30mm guns and short-medium range AA-missiles and radar. It is in use also in Ukraine, Belarus etc. 

And then there is trucks, one MT-LB (command vehicle?), and some trucks with cranes (ammo loading) and 2 sapper/recovery vehicles. There is some text (0:48) on a crane that looks like Russia, can some one confirm? 

This is a Artillery Battery with some AA-cover on a way from somewhere to dunno' where... Not exactly a big force. Also Ukraine uses same equipment, but those new trucks indicate these being more likely Russian. 

On the second video there is 13 tanks, possibly [upgraded T-72's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-72). It's a Tank Company (with supply elements?) But nobody nowhere. Can't say anything about it, those can be also coming from rehearsals or going.

Need some more prove to that OP's title. Although it is sure that Russia has military power massed behind the borders and that moving this equipment in bright day light without guards, looks not ""so threatening"". The real moves are done at night and more guarded etc.  

Russians are just giving some sun bathing to their rusty equipments. The spring is way too early this year. :)

If the shit would be hitting the fan, there would be much more prove, sat picts, stock markets going down etc.

Under it, the Serbian minority would have received such a high degree of autonomy that it could be rightfully considered as almost having ""a state within a state"".

But Croatian Serbs refused the deal and reintegration into Croatian society (even though Milosevic in Belgrade was in favor of it), so the military option was back on the table and, after securing tacit Western approval,  in May and August of '95 Croatia won back the territory previously lost to Serbian insurrection in 1991. 

The territory of Krajina was never an autonomous region or republic like Kosovo in Yugoslavia or Crimea in the Ukraine. It was always under total Croatian sovereignty within the internationally recognized borders of Croatia. It represented almost a third of Croatian territory and split the country in two so giving it up was never an option.

Leaders of Krajina did not listen to reason back in '95 and the common people paid the price - it's them who you should blame.

&gt;On November 10, 1999, the Mars Climate Orbiter Mishap Investigation Board released a Phase I report, detailing the suspected issues encountered with the loss of the spacecraft. Previously, on September 8, 1999, Trajectory Correction Maneuver-4 was computed and then executed on September 15, 1999. It was intended to place the spacecraft at an optimal position for an orbital insertion maneuver that would bring the spacecraft around Mars at an altitude of 226 kilometers on September 23, 1999. However, during the week between TCM-4 and the orbital insertion maneuver, the navigation team indicated the altitude may be much lower than intended at 150 to 170 kilometers. Twenty-four hours prior to orbital insertion, calculations placed the orbiter at an altitude of 110 kilometers; 80 kilometers is the minimum altitude that Mars Climate Orbiter was thought to be capable of surviving during this maneuver. Post-failure calculations showed that the spacecraft was on a trajectory that would have taken the orbiter within 57 kilometers of the surface, where the spacecraft likely disintegrated because of atmospheric stresses.

true,RomeVacationTips,null,null,"Hi there,

Well with an entire day, you can definitely cram in visits to the Vatican, St. Peter's, and the Colosseum/Forum, which will take pretty much the entire day.

If you're an early bird you can book yourself onto an early morning [skip-the-lines guided Vatican visit](http://romevacationtips.com/skip-line-tours-vatican-legitimate/) (usually starting around 7.30am) which means you get to see the Sistine Chapel without the crowds. And when I say crowds I mean it - on a Saturday in summer there are probably 2,000 people at any given time are crammed into the chapel, shuffling through, and there are guards are standing around shouting ""shhh"" at people. It can be quite obnoxious. The other advantage to a guided tour is that if you have a guide you can use the passageway between the chapel and St Peter's; otherwise you have to leave the Vatican and then get into the line for St Peter's separately. 

You need about 3/4 hours in the Vatican, and maybe 2/3 hours for the Colosseum/Forum/Palatine. Again I would recommend using a guide - the places are amazing in their own right, but having someone to help interpret them for you helps you get a whole lot more out of it.

If you do want a guide, I recommend booking tickets in advance online, using the [relevant Tripadvisor page](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g187791-Activities-c42-Rome_Lazio.html). Private tours are very expensive, but if you can find a company that does small-size group tours you'll have a good experience.

true,Federbaum,null,null,"I agree with /u/sirprizes who mentioned that it has not been that long. I am very happy about OP's comment as it is a great statement of what I have heard several times ""over there"", from all sides. 

First of all, I do believe that there is a huge difference of mentality between Serbs and Kraina Serbs, also in regard to the acceptance of the past, and OPENLY talking about what happened. For starters, the integrity of Bosnia is still contested, and the state's structures allow all ethnic groups to veto each other - and thus do not incite any change or cooperation. Serbia - and most Serbs - seem to have accepted Bosnia's existence, not so the Bosnian Serbs. 

And I find it important, that it gets spoken about. Yes, OP, it is great that there seems to be a political shift away from ultra-right nationalism, but right-wing nationalism still can produce tensions, especially in the area. Moreover, 15 years is nothing, historically (AND there isn't even ""one"" history in the region. Ask three people and you hear five versions, so to speak. And in Bosnia, even three different schol curricula are taught!). The only reason Germany became accepted back into the state ""society"" was because the USA were more afraid of the Soviet Union than of a strengthened Germany. Serbia and its officials screwed up, as OP said. But the memories are very fresh. Former leading chetniks are still adored (honestly, how Mladic could live right in the middle of Belgrade and nobody said anything...).

You will have to work with people remembering what happened. The whole region will (I for one find it important that the Croatian crimes become more public. It's shameful that e.g. the US media received a note that told them to not write about the Bosnian-Croat conflict too much because a three-sided conflict would be too complicated for the public to understand. For the Bosniak crimes that might be true too, but they were more scrutinised because of their Muslim background anyway - and were in a much weaker military position to start with). 

So no, it has not been dealt with, at all. Victims are still being identified, and most importantly, many of those who committed the crimes are still adored, even if many of them have been found meanwhile. It is not that easy to say ""ah well. we talked about it, so will you now stop it, finally."" It will take constructive, but apologetic work. be aware of what happened! Do not try to just forget about it - the world won't let you (and in my opinion, it shouldn't. I for one find the work that has been done in Germany for memorialising the society's crimes incredibly important and it seems to have raised awareness among many of how easy nationalism can escalate. In my opinion, Serbia and all other countries in that region, who have suffered SO BADLY from it, need to realise that, too.). Work it into your past, be aware of what happened, how it happened. Do your very best to avoid the possibility of that happening ever again. 
It was not Milosevic alone who killed, who chanted - and still chants - ""Kosova je srce Srbije"" and who hailed Arkan. In Bosnia, it's even worse - e.g. Prijedor's memorialisation policy (a monument to fallen Serb soldiers on the ground of one of the transit camps for deportation? Seriously?).

So I do believe that it might be a little annoying to be reminded of what happened. But I think that it's important not to AGAIN fall into the rut of saying ""Us poor Serbs, again we are misunderstood and a victim of history."", because that is how much of this started. Rather, OP, tell your father's story. If you must, emphasise that there WAS opposition in Serbia. That's important! But don't forget to remember it or how it happened. Tell people off who are trying to give the war legitimacy. Cooperate with Croatia, Bosnia, and within Bosnia with Bosniaks and Croats. Be aware that many are not necessarily ready to forgive (as you might not even be towards them), but might be willing to coexist peacefully and to work on a shared future. 

And maybe, after a generation, or two, (not only 15 years, come on), it will become better. You will be known for hard labour, economic ideas, and for an honest facing of the past. I do wish this outcome for Serbia, I wish it for whole region. 

So don't say ""what else do you want us to?"" Memorialise, cooperate, teach.

Of course, to hear somebody butcher your language can be quite painful, but in general native French-speakers (a category that includes a lot of people besides French citizens) are as appreciative as anybody else when you bother to try to learn their language. The only justification for that stereotype is that (some) French people can be pretty direct in pointing out your mistakes, and that can indeed be a bit dispiriting, even though **they are actually trying to be helpful**. This is something that probably has its roots in the French education system, which is quite strict in making children talk and write ""proper"" French, and that you won't encounter in other French-speaking countries: Belgian French-speakers, for instance, are noticeably more relaxed in this regard, something which I guess comes naturally from dealing frequently with Dutch-speaking compatriots with less-than-perfect French language skills...

- be warned: it is harder for us to understand someone speaking French as a foreign language than it is to english-speaking natives. I think it has to do with the fact that everybody can speak engrish in the world, thus natives in English can understand quite easily nowadays someone who can't speak really properly. For us it's more unusual to hear someone speaking French as a foreign language, thus we may genuinenly have troubles understanding you. But I guess it's the same for turkish, so you may be aware of that.

- consequently, we'll find it cute to meet someone trying to learn our difficult language. We are bad at foreign languages, so we understand that you may be bad at speaking our language, and we know it's difficult.

- however, if you end up living in France for a long time, some people will be less and less understanding. After a few years, some people will think that you could ""at least make an effort to learn the language properly"".

Yes, it is a waste of resources that could be used for better quality of life for the people. In the words of President Dwight D. Eisenhower:

&gt; Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.
&gt;
&gt; This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. . . . This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron. 

...

&gt; *Think about it in this way, a powerful army translates to stability for investors.*

Which explains why Sweden (with its lousy 1.2% of GDP military spending and being part of no military pact) is so poor: nobody invests there.

true,metacoma,null,null,"&gt;He has mentioned Chateaubriand, Le Dome, Spring, and a bunch of &gt;other restaurants that reviews say are very expensive and not worth &gt;the price.

Le chateaubriand is a bit expensive but the food is awesome. I went to Le Dome, quite some times. And while being good, a pile of seafood is a pile of seafood...no need to spend 150€ for that. (there is other brasserie around the dome, that does this for less money.) 

My advice would be to eat at the restaurant for lunch only. The lunch menus are often less expensive and some little neighbourhood brasseries are the best ! like ""les 3 nonnes"" Avenue Trudaine 'metro ANVERS'. 11€ for lunch with entrée and plat. Please, do buy some roast chicken at a good butcher shop, you'll be set for around 8-12€ wth complimentary potatoes ! 
 You could also try to visit Rungis (The professional food market of, located in the south suburbs of Paris) You have to pay a visitor fee around 10€ and have to get there before 6am but you'll come back with great products at a ""low"" cost.

A restaurant you should try is ""le feu de vulcain"", it a japanese restaurant in the 13th district, on La buttes aux cailles. Tepanyaki restaurant with top quality food for a very reasonable price (25€/person). Ok it's not french food but what is great about Paris is also all the different type of cuisine you can eat.

true,tephe,ROMA,Romania,"&gt;Yes, it is a waste of resources that could be used for better quality of life for the people. In the words of President Dwight D. Eisenhower:

I agree the resources could be used for a better quality of life. But people view security as part of a better quality of life. Which is why Eisenhower deplored the situation ""under the cloud of threatening war"", when you're obliged to divert resources to security. 

Security is on the table yet again in Europe, with Russia's surprise annexation of Crimea. If you have a belligerent Russia that increases defense spending each year and just annexed part of a foreign country, then security becomes a vital component of the quality of life, from the state's point of view. 

&gt;Which explains why Sweden (with its lousy 1.2% of GDP military spending and being part of no military pact) is so poor: nobody invests there.

Sweden had mandatory conscription until 2010 and military spending dropped below 2% in 2001. Russia has 4.4% of GDP military spending and keeps increasing it. The Russian threat was dismissed until now. One assumption is that Putin wants to rewrite how the cold war ended because it was disastrous in terms of Russia influence. Is Europe still stable and secure? 

&gt;On the other hand, on the NASA project the US spent a hundredth the sums spent on the military and it provided even more returns in technology.

Would the US military be so powerful if it was split up into 50 individual militaries, each of which acted independently from one another? No, and in the times where that *was* the case, it allowed for a division that lead to a Civil War. I don't want that to happen within the Union.

On top of that, as it stands right now the EU is a paper tiger. It has no hard power and it cannot ever compel action by its member states. For all intents and purposes, when it comes to foreign policy, Europe is *divided*, and that is not good.

If you failed to detect my subtle hint of irony in that comment, I wholeheartedly suggest you to spend some more time on the Internets. But just so that you don't further embarrass yourself, I'm going to explain to you how was that supposed to have gone:

* KLA at one point being classified by USA, UN, UK and France as a terrorist organization (please check the sources at the [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_Liberation_Army#Status_as_terrorist_group) page before attempting to disprove it)... and being that about 90% of Kosovo Albanians are Muslims and...

* terrorism is almost universally recognized as radical Islam terrorism (this one's a generalization, but note that I'm not claiming exclusiveness in the terrorism &lt;-&gt; Islam link, just that almost the whole world generalizes thusly)

* radical Islam warriors, or Mujaheddins' battle-cry is ""Allahu Akbar"" which I believe translates to ""God is great"" (correct me if I'm wrong)

&gt;I'm not sure how you can make flippant statements

You seem to fail to understand the difference between an assumption and a statement. I never claimed that was the case, it was just my ... assumption. I do not know enough facts about the sentiment of different religious groups towards the Yugoslav government at that time, it's just that I had the impression that Catholic Albanians were rather reluctant to join KLA and supported the other side. If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to know the other side of the story, so if you know any legitimate sources showing the composition of the KLA and the sentiment of the different religious groups about the Kosovo case, I'd be really thankful if you showed them to me, or I'll be destined to know only half of the story which seems to be in favor of my original views. :)",0,1395917453,null,0,false,0,cgd5kqg,t3_21812l,t1_cgd5kqg,t1_cgd5adk,null,1433089836,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

La diffamation n'est pas une opinion.

Praticamente è il '96 e dopo anni di lavoro l'ESA ha sviluppato un nuovo lanciatore per sostituire l'Ariane 4. Hanno collaborato molte multinazionali (tra cui di nuovo Alenia) e il razzo è pronto e caricato sulla rampa nella Guyana francese. Ok, count down, tutto bene, il razzo parte, 40 secondi dopo perde completamente il controllo e si innesca il meccanismo di fail safe. Il vettore si autodistrugge con tutto il carico, l'intero progetto cluster dell'ESA. Danni stimati: 1 miliardo di euro circa. A questo punto si forma una commissione per scoprire che cacchio è successo. 

Long story short, un anno e mezzo dopo le conclusioni evidenziano che, riutilizzando software ben collaudato dell'Ariane 4, viene effettuata una conversione di un valore a virgola mobile su 64 bit (la velocità laterale) in un unsigned a 16 bit. La procedura di conversione non era protetta da overflow in quanto l'Ariane 4 non poteva fisicamente raggiungere velocità non rappresentabili su 16 bit. Ma l'Ariane 5 sì. Quindi il sistema di guida inerziale tenta la conversione, fallisce, non ci sono protezioni. Passa la palla al secondo sistema di guida inerziale in hot swap, che al ciclo di macchina successivo fallisce per lo stesso motivo. Boom. 

Ironia della sorte, i dati elaborati NON servivano ad un cavolo di niente in quel frangente, servivano per il solo allineamento PRE volo, ma le funzioni non erano state inibite per quaranta secondi in modo da facilitare eventuali reset in caso di piccoli ritardi nel lancio. 

La cosa ancora più divertente è che non c'è nessuno in particolare che abbia sbagliato.

&gt; *Halloween

Not considered as a holiday per se. Younger people go to parties. School age children may go trick or treating, but it's VERY VERY limited.

&gt; *Feast of St. Joseph

March 19th, fathers' day, ZEPPOLE DI SAN GIUSEPPE

&gt; *New Year's Eve

Seafood based dinner on New Year's eve, meat based lunch on New Year's Day.

* Typical appetizers include:
 * salted anchovies
 * boiled cauliflower and broccoli salad, with oil salt and lemon
 * [papaccelle](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaccella) - small hot pickled  peppers
 * [insalata di rinforzo](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insalata_di_rinforzo) - a salad made with a lot of pickled veggies and anchovies
 * olives
 * octopus

* First course
 * based on seafood; usual choices are spaghetti/linguine with seafood or crustaceans, other options include short pasta formats with fish-based sauces

* Second course
 * fish-based. In general a whole fish is prepared in a very simple yet tasty way.

* Fried fish
 * It's important to note than when you get to the fried fish you are already full, and could avoid eating for the next two days. The typical family discussion is: ""Does anyone want fried fish tonight?"" - ""NAAAH we're full"" - ""But just a little, for the sake of tradition..."" and then you'll get the following in your plate:
 * shrimps, calamari, small fishes dipped in batter and fried
 * Fried cauliflower
 * Fried cod!
 * EEEEEEEL! (Not many people like it, but I LOVE IT!)

&gt; *New Year's Day

* meat based lunch. Typically starts very late (3PM) because you overslept from the previous night. We generally have either ""baked pasta"" or cannelloni or something similar. In general it's pasta with a very thick meat sauce. Second course is general the meat from the ragu, plus some kind of meat with a side of vegetables (my favourite is ""gallinella di maiale e scarole"" - it's the deboned shin of the pork)

&gt; *Epiphany

* Good kids receive stockings full of candies and snacks, bad kids receive coal (yet made of sugar). When I was a child, I used to leave my mother's stockings (very elastic) but the Befana was smarter than me, and always substituted them with a pair of small socks!

&gt; *Easter Sunday

* Pasta with thick meat-based sauces, lamb and meat in general. PASTIERA!

&gt; *Easter Monday

* Casatiello, Pastiera, cured meats, fava beans

&gt; *Natale (Christmas)

* Similar to New Year's Day. Christmas Eve's dinner is similar to New Year's Eve.

Your error seems to be hiding in completely disregarding the political dimension of the conflict, and that loyalty of local population more often than you'd like to admit was also determined by intra-national political differences rather than exclusively by inter-national, black and white, good vs evil narrative-counternarrative exchange of that time.",0,1395920712,null,0,false,0,cgd65k1,t3_21812l,t1_cgd65k1,t1_cgd5smh,null,1433090176,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Ce que tu ne comprends apparement pas, c'est que ces ""dérapages"" salient par association toute critique de l'UE. T'as qu' a demander à des inconnus ce qu'ils pensent de sortir de l'UE : ""ah mais vous êtes extrême-droite, du balai !"" 

Et ça se fait dans plusieurs pays en Europe. Aube Dorée est contre l'UE, et ce sont des néo-nazis, donc si je suis contre l'UE je suis un néo-nazi. C'est comme ça que ça marche pour un bon nombre de Français à cause de toute la propagande européiste et les ""dérapages"" du FN.

&gt; Donc l'alliance avec les communistes n'aurait pas dû se faire ?

Est-ce que les communistes ont dit à De Gaulle ""je ne vous rejoins pas tant que vous ne prenez pas position sur la fiscalité, l'immigation, le mariage pour tous"" etc. et d'autres sujets de seconde importance ?

&gt; À l'inverse, si l'objectif est de sortir de l'UE, alors l'UPR doit se regrouper avec le FN

L'UPR veut sortir de l'UE, le FN veut renégocier les traités pour avoir une ""autre Europe"" comme on l'a vu. Considérant que l'UPR ne fait pas d'alliance avec des partis qui ne veulent pas sortir de l'UE et qui ne cessent de diviser les Français inutilement (ou utilement pour le système) sur des sujets secondaires, c'est donc non.

&gt; Tu fais croire qu'il évoque une alliance nationale alors qu'il s'agit de cas particuliers après le premier tour. Bref, tu es malhonnête.

Ah c'est un cas particulier, au temps pour moi. Je laisse donc le FN faire alliance avec la droite même s'il s'auto-proclame ""ni de droite ni de gauche"". Aucune politicaillerie derrière ça. De même, si jamais l'UPR décide de faire alliance avec un parti européiste, je ne dirai rien. /sarcasme

Compare l'évolution et le nombre d'adhérents E&amp;R / DLR / UPR pour voir ? Quant au FN, il y a probablement des gens qui rejoignent par ras-le-bol, mais les résultats électoraux ne sont pas là, et ce malgré une médiatisation énorme. Imagine ce qui se passerait si l'UPR avait autant de temps de parole que le FN. 

&gt; Ah oui, le mépris de l'énarque pour le petit peuple qui n'est pas capable de faire la part des choses. Classique.

C'est bizarre, BonConseil (du FN, si tu ne traines pas souvent sur reddit) me sortait que si le FN n'a aucune chance d'être au pouvoir, c'est parce que les Français sont assaillis par les merdias qui diabolisent le FN ! 

Dis-moi, pourquoi le FN n'a jamais été au pouvoir, c'est parce qu'il y a vraiment un problème avec ses dirigeants ou parce que les Français sont trop bêtes et influençables et qu'ils ne peuvent pas voir que le FN est leur sauveur ? Si c'est la seconde, option -&gt; Tu serais pas en train de mépriser les Français ?

&gt; L'immigration est un sujet important. Refuser de prendre position, c'est faire preuve de lâcheté.

Plus important que la souveraineté nationale pour toi, le choix est fait.

Euh, De Gaulle faisait des dérapages en 40 ? Est-ce qu'il a fixé des objectifs qui étaient acceptables pour le plus grand nombre possible de Français ?

true,Sixcoup,null,null,"tl?dr: 99% of the people saying french are rude, are tourist too stupid to understand.

French like almost every countries has his unique culture, his unique way of doing thing. And when you are in the country as a tourist you don't have time to understand the difference between your culture and the french one.
It's often that tourist misunderstand a french, and assume he was being rude while in reality, absolutely nothing was rude.

In majority it's from americans, sorry for all the americans here, but some of your tourist are just garbage. They have huge expectation about Paris and France as an all and they make absolutely no effort to adapt to the reality. No Paris is not all beautiful, not all the french are romantics, not everyone has a view on the eiffel tower, and the most important, not every Parisiens is a city guide. If someone doesn't help you, it's not because he doesn't like tourist or foreigner, it's mostly because they don't have the time. There is way too much, tourist for being able to help them all everytime.

And anyway most of the people saying french are rude, are in reality the rude one but don't even notice it. They stop someone in the street, they don't apologize for this, they don't even start by a french word like bonjour or excusez moi, they instantly assume the french will speak an english decent enough to be able to understand them when they are speaking at full speed.

The tourist often struggle to realise, he stopped someone being late to his work, he's not polite, he don't make any effort to make the french life easier, and he hope the french to make an effort in return ? 

You don't make an effort trying to speak in french, you don't even try to help by slowing your english or using simple word, so how on earth can you think he will make an effort and be late to his work only because you want to find the eiffel tower.

Our social interaction are also quite different, for a french for example it's completly normal to criticize someone or something, it's not rude at all. Or when you go in a shop, don't expect to find what you have in your country, yes in america for example, every seller is your best friends, and greet you immediatly and is always near you. In france a seller need to be discrete and only show himself if you need him. So no the seller is not rude to you tourist if he don't come instantly to help you, he's just doing his job as a french would do aka helping you if you ask him to.

So no the french are not rude like everything you need to apply the context to fully understand. If you think with your foreigner mentality while being in France, you may have a lot of problems, but if you adapt to your environnement and try to understand it you will have no problem with the french, i guarantee that.

I wouldnt call it contradictory

And the definition of ""third way"" is exactly that.

I have a friend of mine who is of Cambodian descent and we tend to correct him but mainly we tend to point out the fact that he made a mistake although we know what he means. On the other hand, though I'm pretty fluent in English, I every now and then make some teeny tiny mistakes and my American girlfriend NEVER interrupts me to correct me. Looking back from it, though it's just a way to be helpful, it feels good not being corrected at every mistake I make because people get the grasp and know what you meant, so what if we just stuck to focus on managing to convey a message before mastering the technicalities and subtleties of a language?

Conclusion: if someone makes a mistake but you get what they mean, don't correct them unless they specifically ask you.

The true Brusseleer will say ""Sais-tu fermer la fénêtre, s'il-te-plaît?"", rather than ""Saurais-tu"". Flemish influence makes Belgian French (or rather *Brussels* French) tend to eschew the use of the conditional and the imperative. This is BTW also what explains the use of ""une fois"". A Brusseleer may also say ""Fermes la fénêtre une fois"" instead of ""Ferme la fénêtre"": since in Flemish there's often no apparent difference between imperative and infinitive, the word ""eens"" is often used to indicate a request...this has been translated as ""une fois"" in Belgian French (French people mocking Belgian -Brussels- French tend to just use ""une fois"" a lot, without understanding how it is used).

true,GavinZac,IREL,Ireland,"Early European settlers were aware of how different races responded to different diseases (back when the word meant in its literal sense 'not being at ease'), one example of which being that they prefered black slaves who died a lot less than other slaves in the Caribbean environment. While they would not have known much of anything with regard to germ theory, if they saw themselves as living while the Indians died it would have seemed to them to play into the tropes of divine ""providence"" and ""destiny"" that they loved, and seen themselves better 'fit' to live in the land. 

The natives themselves viewed it as a sort of witchcraft by the Europeans, and many despaired that the European gods seemed far more powerful than the local gods. Indeed, local 'medical' treatments involved doing things that would not have seemed too alien to many Europeans at that time, like sauna-to-ice immersion, but those treatments actually made things worse.

There are confirmed isolated cases of intentional spreading of the disease by Europeans, but the consensus is swinging *away* from the idea that it was a widespread intentional policy. Instead, if we take the ""much larger populations"" theories now in fashion, it fits with the idea that Europeans basically *lived alongside* and *among* American Indian societies, trading with them, deserting to them, even intermarrying in some cases. Close contact is a much better way of spreading the diseases. One story that (the details of which I should look up again) recounts an Indian who was captured after a raid on a European village, his comrades returning to their homes. After a couple of years, with the Europeans he eventually led them to where his old village had been - and found it in ruins and deserted. His townfolk had returned, one or more of them now carrying the disease, and dropped like flies.

Later colonisers had a better understanding of germ theory. Smallpox was one of the first diseases postulated to be spread by tiny microscopic, even *air carried* worms. Transmission causes were well understood. However, a devil-may-care attitude certainly contributed to the spread, such as in cases where a sick Indian working on a steam boat (seems odd to even think of those technologies and peoples together) spread the disease all the way up the Missouri:

&gt; ""Fulkerson requested of the steamboat captain that he put the first man to come down with smallpox off the boat. Captain Pratte, who was a principal in the fur company that owned the boat, refused to stop or turn back because of the disease, for turning back would have interfered with his delivery of trade goods. That would have caused havoc with his business, and put his traders in danger from angry Indians who were counting on the trade goods. Thus the brunt of responsibility for the epidemic lies with Pratte, for refusing to cancel his trip upriver once the smallpox was discovered aboard. Upon William Fulkerson's return from the steamboat trip, he warned William Clark that: ""the small pox has broke out in this country and is sweeping all before it—unless it be checked in its mad career I would not be surprised if it wiped the Mandan and Rickaree [Arikara]Tribes of Indians clean from the face of the earth.""""

If there is major blame, it is for wilful negligence rather than any particular biological warfare scheme. This was an era of racial supremacy, and examples like this - seeing the misfortune of others as an opportunity, perhaps even god given - were well alive in Europe, let alone in America. Idly standing by, or pressing ahead with ones plans when disaster *for others* seemed likely was par for the course. Here's some quotes on the Irish Famine:

&gt; [The Famine] ""would not kill more than one million people, and that would scarcely be enough to do any good.""

Nassau Senior, Economics professor, Oxford University

&gt; English colonisation and English policy might be most effectively carried out by Irish starvation.

Edmund Spenser

Lord Trevelyn, the man in charge of the running of Ireland from Britain, is the most damned and a name stamped forever on the minds of Irishmen describing the Famine over which he presided as ""a direct stroke of an all-wise and all-merciful Providence"", calling it

Also:

&gt; I was trying to defuse the argument ...

&gt; You can't provide me any proof of Catholic Albanians sided with the Serb government.

I never said that. Read my original post and try again, this time without resorting to strawman.

But here, just for shit and giggles, I'll quote myself:

&gt; Well, they were **more loyal to the Serbian government**, maybe they were targeted by Muslim Albanians? Besides, wasn't the mainstream narrative ""Genocidal Serbs vs. poor Muslims""?

I hope you successfully deducted that *more loyal* meant *...compared to Muslim Albanians*.

One post down:

&gt; I got that **assumption** from a Miroslav Lazanski film where he showed multiple Catholic Albanian villagers greeting YPA like they were their saviors. While **that documentary was plainly biased**, I believe it's pretty safe to apply Occam's razor here preemptively and disregard any conspiracy theories about ""Serbia paid actors"" or something like that.

I can't seem to find where I mentioned *Catholic Albanians siding with the Serbs*, correct me if I'm wrong and such thing exists.

I deliberately neglected to **claim** anything because all I had was [**anecdotal evidence**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCnObKsR7xQ). You, on the other hand, seem to have no problem whatsoever with making bold statements without **any** sources while blatantly generalizing, disregarding everything I said, and finally twisting my position and implying ""U RONG U HAEV NO EVURDENC"". 

&gt; You're the one that has to convince me of your narrative

That was never my intention. Besides, it seems that you already have one, and it seems it's rather strongly rooted in emotions. I wouldn't want to rob you off your feelings.

&gt; Why is the burden of proof on me when you're the one claiming Catholic Albanians sided with the Serb government?

As a big club by Irish standards, we'd traveled all over Europe from the Baltics to Iceland to Cyprus (even knocking out Swedish and Dutch clubs!), going to places where hooliganism was a concern. However, only in Serbia (and, sort of, in Cyprus\*) was there ever any violence - we're a small band of happy Irish people, and even if there is initial trepidation (Hammarby seemed to think we were 'up for it') it usually ends in everyone drinking in the same pub and talk of how great the Irish are. Usually it's a maximum of 100 or 200 people making the journey to some backwater in Finland or whatever, and we don't exactly seem intimidating. It's a lot of fun and in our small community it would basically be people's summer holidays.

Not so, in Serbia. There, fans were only allowed to leave the hotel with police escort, and at that only a perfunctory tour around the city centre before being brought to the game. At which, we were positioned on the top tier of the Maracana, miles from the pitch in a half empty stadium. This seemed odd, until the behaviour of Red Star fans became evident. Positioning themselves beneath the away fans, they began throwing chairs and other objects *up* at the upper tier, and somehow managed to set ablaze a flag that was hanging down.

Evidently they weren't aware we weren't an English club, and sang lots of anti-English songs, to our general amusement.

This behaviour still goes on, and nothing is done about it, so I don't particularly appreciate reading about how welcoming Serbia is.

\*We beat Apollon Limmassol in the Champions League and when our players celebrated at the end, the Apollon players turned on and beat up several of our players. This incited their crowd quite a bit and we were made to hang back an hour or so before we were allowed to leave.

You finally got it.

&gt; I said it before but they're the same thing, you won't find anything talking about Albanian Catholics differing opinions on the Serb government compared to Albanian Muslims because they believed the same thing in general. Religion is NOT an important aspect of day-to-day Albanian lives, it's largely irrelevant. 

[citation needed]

Abscence of evidence is not evidence of abscence.

&gt; Where do I find sources of something NOT happening? Because that's what you're telling me to do. You're assuming there's a distinction to be made between Albanian Catholics &amp; Muslims, **and then telling me to find evidence that there is.**

Because you're the one making claims here.

Some helpful sources might include:

* A book on Kosovo Albanian culture and religion

* A substantiated and fact-based report on religious structure of KLA compared to religious structure of Kosovo Albanians

* A report on demographic changes after the Kosovo conflict

**EDIT:** Editing your post makes it hard to write a follow-up answer. Please refrain from doing so. And announce your edits unless it's a trivial spelling or grammar error.

&gt; no one else assumes this, maybe it's because religion is more important to Serbs in general?

Well you're not arguing with anyone else here but me, right?

&gt;Maybe you should also tell me to find evidence of Albanians that were loyal to the Serb government based on which ones like dark chocolate and which don't, because that's how relevant this argument about religion is to Albanians. 

The only thing irrelevant here is your example. Inter-religious conflict is a well observed occurance even between members of the same nation, while the chocolate preference in the same context is... just absurd.

Regardless, here's a report by International Crisis Group, including a part about how Kosovo Albanians feel about religion: 

http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/europe/Kosovo%2026.pdf

""Kosovo Albanians do not define their national identity through religion, but through
language and have a relatively relaxed approach towards the observance of the forms of
the Islamic religion. Neither Islamic leaders nor Islamic theology played a significant role
in either the eight-year campaign of non-violent resistance to the Serb occupation
regime or the armed resistance of 1998-99. Islamic political and social fundamentalism,
as that term is understood with respect to the Middle East, has very little resonance in
Kosovo.""

EDIT:

Also ""Islamic involvement in politics is entirely unknown within the Kosovo Albanian
political hierarchy"" from the same report.

We also managed to dodge a bullet with international crisis what certainly helped.

Problem is that many Poles don't see that. Opposition parties been focused purely on negative propaganda since... 2007. Initially that didn't work but in last 2 years everything changed and now many Poles got probably worse opinion about their own country than they did before we entered EU - at least that's my perception, it might not be entirely true, but radicalism become much louder than ever (eg. right now the most popular Polish youtube channel is MaxTV (with famous headline: ""I say how it is""), lead by right-wing populist dreaming about ""rebirth"" of imperialistic Poland) and talking shit on your own country become something that's not only acceptable (cause that was always truth) but even praised.

All ""open"" alternatives have glaring issues that make it impossible to base your daily business work on them. Also, when it comes to professional software (e.g. CAD tools) most of that is limited to Windows as well. Microsoft's main customer base are businesses, the main business model is selling business software to businesses. And they are doing a really fucking good job. It's not that they have the best product in a given niche but they simply have products in almost every niche and it all fits together in a nice, dependable ecosystem. 

I've run different Linux distros over the years, on my own servers, on the servers I administrated, on laptops and on my main desktop. debian is a great server OS and I would gladly recommend it for anyone who wants to set up any kind of server... But Windows 7 is just that much better for a desktop/work pc and I'm really happy with my choice to replace my ThinkPad (with debian on it) with a MacBook. I've been a FOSS fanatic for more than a decade now but the sad truth is that there are fast application domains where no one has bothered to write a competitive FOSS product. And I don't mean just features, program stability or update cycles. Most FOSS tools simply lack in ease-of-use, i.e. it's often incredibly difficult to get them/get them to run the way you want them to and using them is often a gigantic pain in the arse. E.g. Eclipse: it's actually full of interesting concepts and really intelligent ideas under the hood. In fact it's used in my uni's software technology course as an example how you should structure your framework. But it also sucks as a piece of software that you have to use, its non-community-developed competitors have left it behind in the dust years ago and continue to widen the gap.

People already commented a lot on the European citizenship part, so I'll address the other one: with a Master's in Biomed Engineering, your prospects should be fantastic, but do get the citizenship first before starting to apply for the jobs.

Do you have a special interest in what kind of place would you like to work at? 

I'm mostly familiar with pharma and while some companies did issue a hold on hirings because of the financial crisis, those are mostly gone/far more lax now. Switzerland, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Germany are big in this field, but basically every EU-member country has a decent job market for your degree. 

Local/national smaller companies will be less interested, because they tend to use the local language in the work environment even though they usually demand English fluency from the workers, but international companies would be no issue for you, especially if you end up in somewhere truly international, like a research facility. 

If your degree is from a noted school it also helps, but I have to say in some cases ""noted"" means ""schools that we Europeans have heard of"", so not necessarily ASU or UW, but more like MIT or Johns Hopkins. But then again, this will not be the case with international corporations, their HR knows their shit and the school rankings. 

It also helps if you can be present for the preliminary interviews in person instead of Skype. 

tl;dr: finish the degree, get the citizenship, come visit for the interviews and to get the gist of the place and your prospects should be great. ",0,1395929267,null,0,false,0,cgd8ocq,t3_21h9lm,t1_cgd8ocq,t3_21h9lm,null,1433091531,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

You keep using that word, I don't think it means what you think it means.

&gt;If I say that was not the case, you're supposed to prove me wrong, not the other way around. 

Again, sorry, no. If I present that as my opinion (and that's what an assumption basically is), you are welcome to change it by using legitimate sources (like you did with that report, which is certainly a step towards a sane, rational discussion on your behalf) which indicate otherwise. If I present it as an argument, I am obliged to provide extensive and strong evidence in favor of it. That's how it goes.

This report seems to confirm your claims that to (at least Muslim) Albanians, religion plays little role in their day-to-day lives, but still doesn't tell us anything of the nature of Catholic&lt;-&gt;Muslim Albanians or Catholic Albanians&lt;-&gt;Serbs interactions *during* the war. It's findings may apply to peaceful conditions (which is on what it mainly focuses, with blatant downplaying of destruction of religious objects and reducing it to mere ""vandalism"") but may not hold on to the political climate during wartime.

&gt;The bottom line is you're suggesting there is some kind of inter-religious conflict, and you're not providing any evidence that there is such a thing. 

Nope. Again, strawman. I was merely presenting an option that religious differences between Albanians might have also influenced  different political affiliations between those groups and the Serbs.

There is no point in continuing this since you have made several feeble attempts to discredit and twist what I was saying and it has crossed my threshold level of tolerance.

I know that you get civilian casualties in any military conflict.

“Here people are Muslims, but they think like Europeans,” says Xhabir Hamiti, a professor in the Islamic studies department at the University of Pristina in Kosovo’s capital. “Muslims here identify themselves as Muslim Lite,” an American police officer tells me. As Afrim Kostrati, a young bartender, puts it: “We are Muslims, but not really.” And Luan Berisha, an entrepreneur, agrees: “We were never practicing Muslims like they are in the Middle East. . . . First of all, we are Albanians. Religion comes second.”

“We Albanians,” writes Catholic priest Dom Lush Gjergji, “descendants of the Illyrians, are Christians from the time of the Apostles. . . . Without Christianity there would be no Albanian people, language, culture, or traditions . . . Albanians consider Christianity their patrimony, their spiritual and cultural inheritance.” That's from a known Kosovo-Albanian Catholic priest. 

This is what Albanians feel culturally on the matter. I can't find anything about it during the war, no tensions or anything, so what do you want me to do? If there were problems between Albanian Catholics and Muslims during the war, it would be possible to find something about it.

&gt; It is a growing problem among Russian world leaders: anorexia nervosa. The conquest disorder affects mostly leaders with low self-esteem and fear of loss of geopolitical influence.

&gt; The main symptoms are the incorporation of peninsulas, occupying sovereign states and organizing Winter Games. Some patients put punk singers trapped in Siberia.

&gt; Lyudmila Putina (56) experienced the disorder first hand. She was married to an anorexic patient until she filed for a divorce last year: ""In the beginning I did not notice, but at one point he started to attack Georgian republics. I should have already been suspicious.""

&gt; Lyudmila came more than once in embarrassing situations: ""If we somehow were eating in a restaurant, he could recognize from scratch the independence of Abkhazia. Then of course I saw the glances towards our table and I could sink through the floor. ""

&gt; Igor Tirmanov is a psychiatrist in St. Petersburg. According to him, there is little knowledge of the causes of anorexia in the international community: ""Many conquest disorders result from a traumatic childhood experience, such as the disintegration of a communist empire or losing a Cold War.""

&gt; The treatment options are limited. ""With economic sanctions and the freezing of funds, we can at most slow down the symptoms. A real cure for anorexia is still far away. Much more awareness and research is needed. However, it is currently in the process of testing the new anti-oppressiva. ""

You're interpreting it the wrong way. Zionists and Jews in general would *never* claim there is a lack of anti-semitism without a reason. Under normal corcumstances they'd rather make up the attacks or invent new and menacing forms of anti-semitism, which leads me be believe that they're downplaying it to support the Ukrainian revolution.

They all have seafood platters and the farther you are away from the tourist areas, the less those will cost. Seafood is expensive though. 

I don't like seafood platters much myself but my friends who do love Le Bar à Huîtres, 112 boulevard Montparnasse. Expensive, but reasonably so considering what you're getting--and across the street from Le Dôme-- but a nice atmosphere, good service and really delicious. So maybe save that for a splurge. 

Otherwise, Paris is full of good restaurants that aren't so expensive. If you want to experience top-of-the-line food without paying the price, go at lunchtime and order the ""menu""-- this means the fixed-price menu. Sometimes it comes in several different price ranges. 

Also, my friends here who really have little money either don't eat out or go to ""ethnic"" restaurants, not French ones. Chinese, Indian, north African, Ethiopian, etc. will usually be much cheaper.

true,mkvgtired,null,null,"They may want to look inward to their own country or Europe in general. Despite popular belief, financial regulations in Europe are very often weaker than in the US. The UK has been leading the push for deregulation. London has far less regulatory hurdles than New York. Even medium sized US banks do all their international lending out of London. 

Five of the 10 largest banks in the world are European, while only one is American, coming in at number 7. Your country's two largest banks each have assets roughly equal to France's entire GDP. 

Because EU ""One Passport"" regulations made cross border mergers and acquisitions easier, 62% of the world's banking mergers and acquisitions take place within the EU, not in a developing market where you may think. So the institutions I was talking about above are only getting larger. 

This does not even touch on securities regulations, which tend to be *far* more lax in London than in the US. Things that would be mandatory disclosures in the US are not mandatory in the EU. Also, if an issuer omits a material fact in the US shareholders can sue, this is not the case in the vast majority of Europe (with only limited private right of action in the UK). This incentives disclosing information if its questionable whether its mandatory or not. 

Lax regulation invites more questionable companies to list. Many of London's listings would not meet SEC requirements in New York. If you want a third party source, Japan allows any listing that has been approved by the SEC to be dual-listed in Tokyo. This was part of their push to get their economy out of its stagnant state (so the more dual listings the better). They reviewed extending the same benefit to European listings but they declined because regulations were not stringent enough, so European stocks are still assessed on a case-by-case basis.

I will give the EU credit, the original EU proposals for a pan-EU regulator would have filled many of these gaps. It had many provisions similar to the Dodd-Frank act in the US. But London took its eraser to the proposal and substantially weakened it. So London's more lax regulations will be spreading to the rest of Europe, not more strict regulations at the EU level spreading to London.

true,MrSwingKing,EURO,European Union,"I apologize, i looked in the wrong article. I just landed after a long flight. 
The right one is of course art. 6. Article 9 is about the administrative formalities for family members who are not nationals of an EU country.

Art. 6 states that:

&gt; 1. Union citizens shall have the right of residence on the territory of another Member State for a period of up to three months without any conditions or any formalities other than the requirement to
hold a valid identity card or passport.

I admit, that the word Visa was wrong, but what i tried to say was, that you don't require any don't need any permits to enter a country for shorter periods at a time. I know it could be confusing.

Now, in article 7, it states the conditions for when you can stay in a member state for more than three months. It goes:

&gt;1. All Union citizens shall have the right of residence on the territory of another Member State for
a period of longer than three months if they:

&gt;(a) *are workers* or self-employed persons in the host Member State; or

&gt;(b) have *sufficient resources for themselves* and their family members *not to become a burden on the social assistance system* of the host Member State during their period of residence *and have comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the host Member State;* or

&gt;(c) – are enrolled at a private or public establishment, accredited or financed by the host Member State on the basis of its legislation or administrative practice, for the principal purpose of following a course of study, including vocational training; and have comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the host Member State and assure the relevant national authority, by means of a declaration or by such equivalent means as they may choose, that they have sufficient resources for themselves and their family members not to become a burden on the social assistance system of the host Member State during their period of residence; or

&gt;(d) *are family members accompanying or joining a Union citizen who satisfies the conditions referred to in points (a), (b) or (c).*

(d) along with art. 7(2) is where the souse derives his or her right to accompany the other to the member state.

So, art. 7 sets up a few other requirements than ''you basically have to be homeless to fail the requirements'', in order to stay in another member state indefinitely. 

You said it yourself. you have the right to study and work in the other member states. What we're talking about is residency. As long as you're working, you can stay as long as you want, but if you just go to, let's say Hungary, you cannot stay there for longer than three months, generally speaking. 
If you want to stay beyond that period, you have to either be: 

A: Part of the work force or part of this ones family

B: Economicly self dependent (a privete health insurance and not relying on the country's benefits, or:

C: A student. 


&gt; Actual residence cards (Article 10) are only issued for non-EU spouses/family-members of EU nationals and that's the only thing that has limited duration (5 years).

The permanent residence is granted to anyone who has stayed for five years in a member state. If you have stayed for 4 and a half year, then technically, you should leave the country after your job as ended. This is stated in article 16(1):

&gt;1. *Union citizens* who have *resided* legally for a *continuous period of five years* in the host Member State *shall have the right of permanent residence there.* This right shall not be subject to the conditions provided for in Chapter III.

That's debatable though, as polls have shown that not to be the case. 37% isn't large compared to those who aren't sure or say no. http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/scottish-independence-yes-at-37-in-yougov-poll-1-3353921
&gt;The latest research by YouGov found 37% of people questioned said they support independence, up two points from last month, with 52% planning to vote No, down by one point.

Edit: To appease anyone who thinks I may be misrepresenting it, removing everything but the Yes and No votes brings this result:
