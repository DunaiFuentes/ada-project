true,Mshotts,UNSA,United States of America,"There's a lot more that goes into your ability to wage war than the amount of money you throw at it. 

Take oil for instance (you know, the stuff you use to run your tanks and planes and such). Only two European countries are in the top 20 oil producing countries (and one isn't even in the EU). Norway &amp; UK at 19 and 20 respectively. Yet 7 are in the top 20 for oil consumption and aren't dead last like they are in production. Where are you going to get the oil you need? The US &amp; Canada are both across the Atlantic as are Venezuela, Brazil &amp; Mexico. Russia or China? Maybe you'd prefer a Middle Eastern country like Saudi Arabia or Iran. Yet it remains to be seen what's going to happen in the Middle East once the US finishes our pullout and so far that hasn't looked promising at all.  

I'd also point out that the bulk of defense spending in the EU comes from the big four. UK, France, Germany and Italy. Do the Germans even have the stomach for war? I think their public opinion polls show that they don't and if anything want even less to do militarily. Are the British, French or Italians going to lead a charge to save their European brethren in case of attack? Hell the Brits aren't even sure they want to stay in the EU. This can't be overstated as for all the talk about one there is no integrated European military or defense group. That is not something you're going to be able to throw together overnight and would take years if not the greater part of a decade and you haven't even started yet. 

This is also completely ignoring the fact that while the world looks one way now it is going to look very different 20 years from now.  

The fact is that European nations enjoy an enormous security blanket with NATO membership that means American support. Take that away and suddenly Europe seems much less threatening. I'm not saying European armed forces aren't among the top in the world because they are. But it's a mistake to downplay how major an ally the United States is.

The US is there but not really helping as it's now clearly turned to the Pacific as it's main influence area. And New Zealand's governor-general is present on Obama's step reinforcing just that idea. 

Russia is unphased and isolated. Not even caring about what others do or say. Also, on the same step as Britain, who apparently wishes to become isolated too.

true,SpyMonkey3D,FRAN,France,"&gt; If you actually bothered to read instead of skim my comment for buzzwords you would know that I never said Saddam had any WMDs. What I said was that nobody knew at the time (throughout the 90's and early 2000s) whether he had weapons or not, but he had refused some 12-14 times to allow neutral international observers to enter his country to ensure that he wasn't building atomic weapons. 

Rhetoric, not ""not reading"". I actually bothered to read all your posts in the whole thread, and to answer. Anyway, WMD's or not, it was just a pretext (They totally knew he didn't have any before starting the war.), that's why I mentionned oil. Who's not reading/trying to understand what the other is saying again ?

&gt; What are you saying? 

I was saying that occupation is as bad as annexation, in this case, worse, because at least, Crimea was done with the approval of the Crimean people (more or less), and not violently. (Easy to ignore where I say 150000+ deaths and then say I had only a good argument, uh ?)

&gt;Occupation =/= annexation in any way. 

I did the differentiation between the two, you even said it yourself. But it seems you just ignored that part...

&gt; I don't know how else to explain such an easy concept. 

Don't be arrogant, please. You're not in position to explain me thing **I** said in the first place. 

&gt; The two are absolutely distinct.

Not shit Sherlock ! Maybe that's why there are two words and I used only one ? 

&gt; Iraq is not a US State now, but Crimea is now an Oblast of the Russian Federation. Nobody try to Americanize the Iraqi people, while Putin is beginning to Russify Crimea once more. The citizens of America are extremely critical of the invasion of Iraq. In Russia, Putin's popularity hit record highs once he conquered the peninsula.

Putin didn't russify Crimean, they already were. If you look at history, Crimea was part of Russia for an awful lot of time. This is not the Oppresive and bloody conquest you describe.

&gt;The citizens of America are extremely critical of the invasion of Iraq.  In Russia, Putin's popularity hit record highs once he conquered the peninsula.

So, they are critical. Maybe for the exact same reason as I am ? 

&gt; NATO isn't going from province to province seizing territory. NATO grows by sovereign democracies joining a defensive alliance of their own accord. 

And like I said, their influences are growing across Europe since 1991. Now that you explained me, how NATO grows, maybe should I explain you that the defensive treaty is clearly **against Russia**. Do I have to explain ? No ? 

&gt; Russia's growth has been through military conquest. 

Every damn country that exist in Europe conquered its land. 

&gt; There's a massive difference. 

That's truth, but you're missing the point. 

&gt; Sovereign countries can join alliances as they please. It doesn't matter that historically they were controlled by Tsarist and later Soviet Russia. They're sovereign now, and they can join alliances as they please. Russia has no right to dictate that.

And they can join Russia if they want to, too. That's what Crimea did. And the US and the EU have no right to dictate that they can't ... ? 

&gt; Absolutely not! Russia literally sent in troops and took a chunk of land from another sovereign state because they had already looted Ukraine's nuclear arsenal and the country was in political turmoil. How you can construe that as ""defensive"" is beyond me.

So, if I say to you that Russia see NATO as a possible threat/rival (in continuation of the cold war tensions) ? That Russia don't want it just next to their territory ? 
Do you know what the objective of the US was after the fall of the URSS ? Make sure it don't get back on his feet ! The US don't want a rival. (Comprehensible.) NATO grows over ancient part of the URSS so the URSS can't have that. Why do you think there is a anti ballistic shield in Poland ? In Romania ? Because Russia still have a shitload of nuclears weapon, and to think that ""It's cool now, the Cold war is over, everybody is nice and happy now"" is absolutely idiotic. 

&gt; This is really your only point that could actually hold some merit. I still disagree, though. 

Again, don't be arrogant. 

&gt; Ukraine began moving westward to finally start making progress at growing its economy and bettering the lives of its citizens instead of living as a satellite state of Russia. Seeing this, Putin attacked as soon as Ukraine was ""down"" in an attempt to sabotage the country and destabilize it.

Putin is evil ! He don't want the poor Ukrainian to be happy ! 

&gt; It was intended as a giant ""Fuck you!"" to the West to gain support domestically in Putin's own failed dictatorship, there's no doubt about it in my eyes.

The whole Ukraine crisis is just a embodiment of the tension between the US and Russia (Ex-URSS). It is the result of what happen when a country is torn between two sphere of influence. Not just Putin being evil to stay in power. 

In the end, it seems that you're panicking over geopolitical with Manichean views. (Not the best to understand Geopolitics) Calm down a bit. And as you said to another guy, maybe you should read history books.

If you only make minimum wage you already need food stamps to get by (7.25 $/hr * 40hr/week * 4week/month * 12month/per = 13920). That's if they keep minimum wage instead of free market principles. Don't forget that the young urban populations that have recently moved in and work in the tech sector are more likely then the average Texan to need federal assistance. If their already basic lifestyle gets further reduced they can pick up stakes and move out of Texas as fast as they moved in. 

&gt; Texas has mediocre k-12 schools, but they are very proud over their universities, some of them are among the best in the country. I don't know why redditors think Republicans don't like education. It's one of the most retarded memes I see on this site.

because they have their own set of facts like, The USA is a christian nation and was created to be a christian nation. Evolution, the central principal of biology, is not true. The world is 6000 years old. Climate does not exist because only God can change things. When you remove facts it is not education it is indoctrination. Also how many out of state students will not go to Texan schools if they now have to apply as international students.

Oh and think how much competitiveness Texas will lose when there is Customs and border checks between the US and Texas. It would make importing and exporting to Texas as difficult as it is with Mexico. Actually maybe more difficult as Texas isn't part of NAFTA. How much would it take for a company to pick up stakes and move out of Texas just so it wouldn't have to deal with that inconvenience?

No, with certain competences taken care of at its European government.

There are a lot of people with a lot of different goals in Britain too. If one parliament for those people works, then it also works at a larger level.

&gt;Britain has 100% of the seats in the British Parliament but 10.2% of the seats in the European Parliament, transferring all power to the European Parliament as you suggest would mean the British people would be far less represented if the supreme authority was a European government.

As I already explained, that is exactly the same situation as you have with any Parliament. Oxfordshire only has x% of the seats in Britain, but that doesn't mean they're underrepresented; they're adequately represented in the whole of the Parliament and weigh just as heavy as every other region.

Or, ça conduit à un blocage. On devrait encourager les élèves à d'abord parler l'anglais et ensuite le parler bien. Que d'abord ils s'en imprègnent, qu'ils aient l'habitude de parler et penser en anglais et qu'ensuite seulement on serre les boulons. Après tout, on doit pas attendre d'un élève de 12 ans qu'il sache faire une analyse sémantique sur Shakespeare en anglais.

yet, we dont even know what he looks like, or the matter what his native language sounds like. his entire's tribe language, the very essence of culture itselft, has been forgotten.

yet on the other hand, you have rome itself. yes it subjugated by might and by the sword to 3/4th of europe, but in doing so they built magnificent roads and town, brought their language and writing across the continent, and expanded a legal system all the way to the orient.
we remembered rome and her culture for the last millennium and we shall continue to do so for another millennium

after the american civil war, the us govt made sure to reconstruct the south in order to begin the healing process and made sure every southern state's constitution was rewritten to exclude slavery.

&gt;In [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics) and [pedagogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy), an __interlinear [gloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloss_(annotation\))__ is a series of brief explanations (such as definitions or pronunciations) placed between a line of original text and its [translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation) into another [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language). When glossed, each line of the original text acquires one or more lines of transcription known as an __interlinear text__ or __interlinear glossed text__ (IGT)—__interlinear__ for short. Such glosses help the reader follow the relationship between the source text and its translation, and the structure of the original language. In its simplest form, an interlinear gloss is simply a literal, word-for-word translation of the source text.

Aber DAS geht ja nicht! Es ist ja jetzt euer Protektorat, die Ukraine. Man hat doch so viel Geld in diesen Putsch reingebuttert! Das wäre doch SO ein Gesichtsverlust!

Oder man lässt Donezk gehen. Damit wäre was falsch, bitte?

true,katarn86,ESPA,EU,"&gt; I'm saying that Europe needs to take defense more seriously and that includes creating an integrated defense force. Standardization of tanks, jets, rifles, etc. 

That's already happening, and I'll give some examples:

- Tanks: Currently western EU uses: Leopard II, Challenger II, Leclerc and Ariete, but of those only the L2 has been exported to the EU, so de facto is the standard tank (there are also T-72, leopards and older pattons in the east but those are progressively been retired)

- Jets: there's more variety here, but most forces use either the F-16, the F-18, the Eurofighter, the Tornado or the Grippen.

- Rifles: most of EU follows NATO stanag rules, so 5,56 and 7,62 are the common standards (the exceptions are non-nato Finland and some Eastern EU members, that are currently replacing AK derivatives).

- Ships: most modern EU's destroyers follow a basic desing derived from the [NFR-90](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFR-90), some adapted with national systems (like the T-45 or the Horizon) and some with US's systems (like the Nansen or the Álvaro de Bazán).

There are exceptions to all of this, but those exceptions are similar to your ""pork"", and at this moment unavoidables.  

&gt; Quite frankly I don't think it's that unreasonable to ask Europe in general to spend more on their defense. If you want to be part of NATO you spend your 2% minimums. End of story. 

Or what? you'll send us a strongly worded letter? Really, without having to pay for a nuclear force there's no reason to spend 2% of our GDPs in defence (and US doesn't want us to get a nuclear force).

Yes this is all true. I think it would be a horrible decision for Texas to leave (plus, blockading their ports would essentially destroy their energy industry, and thus the backbone of their economy).

However, we are into abstract territory right now, discussing the nuances of situation that will almost certainly never play out. Therefore, I am not sure how much can be gained from continuing down this path. We might as well be discussing the implications of Zeus parting the clouds and re-asserting dominance over his earthly domain.

For books and music I could live with the fact that the artist holds the rights as long as he lives. But if he sells or transfers the rights to a corporation they should only be protected a maximum of 20 years.

Take Disney, they are hunting people for piracy, they've built their whole company on copying old works and remaking them.

Hollywood itself was built through the breach of patents and intellectual property. The sole reason to why the movie companies re-located to California and created what became the Hollywood of today was because it was far away from New Jersey, which made it harder for Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company to hunt them down. And now they have the balls to come after some kid who downloaded a move that most likely was shit anyways.

Forse la gente guarda poco la televisione d'estate proprio perché non c'è più nulla che le interessi, piuttosto che il contrario.  
Tutto questo mi ricorda un po' il caso del cinema: in altri paesi come ad esempio gli USA il periodo estivo è quello più redditizio e quello in cui vengono fatti uscire tutti i film più attesi dell'anno, cosa abbastanza sensata, visto che se si ha più tempo libero per via delle vacanze si ha anche più tempo per andare al cinema. In Italia invece fino a non molti anni fa durante i mesi estivi le sale cinematografiche chiudevano quasi tutte e non veniva fatto uscire nulla che non fossero fondi di magazzino. Poi ad un certo punto, complici forse internet e il p2p, hanno iniziato pure qui a fare uscire i blockbuster hollywoodiani anche d'estate in contemporanea con il resto del mondo, in modo da non doverli distribuire con troppi mesi di ritardo quando gli appassionati ormai se li erano già scaricati da eMule.

I'd not agree with that. I am against the EU. But I want trade, I want cooperation, I think that Europe is the best thing ever. But I do not want an undemocratic flawed organisation that has the goal to become a federation to make decisions that affect me. I want the people of each country to have the power to decide their own future. The only thing the EU should do is to ensure the free movement of goods, services and people. It should not get involved with anything else.

It should not have any mandate to stipulate any rules what so ever. It can only act when a member nation is putting up barriers for the free movement of goods, services or people. In all cases it shall sit quiet and do nothing.

If we want a body that represents Europe internationally we should create one and ask each country to vote if they want to be in it or not. Before the vote it should be made clear what it means, a clear constitution that isn't 1000 pages long. Hell copy the US one. The powers of this federation should be limited so that each state has the power to not implement federal laws that it's population does not support and that are outside of the boundaries of the constitution.

true,darian66,NETH,"The Netherlands (and Belgium, they just don't know it yet)","&gt;The best answer I've found to this question is that lend lease undeniably made the Red Army's victory faster and easier, but was not decisive enough that without it the Red Army couldn't eventually achieve the same result. Mark Harrison in this[1] essay http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/academic/harrison/public/lendlease.pdf (Dated but still useful) 

&gt;puts the peak of lend lease at 13.2 billion rubbles out of 129.4 billion total.
Lend lease trucks are often brought up as being critical for sustaining the Red Army's advance, especially in major operations such as Bagration and Jassy-Kishinev. Lend lease imports were certainly enormous, but the Soviet Union had its own even larger prewar truck fleet along with captured vehicles. Lend lease trucks made up around 5% of the fleet in January 1943, 19% in January 1944, and 30% in January 1945. Very few of these trucks, or indeed any trucks (Around 12,000 out of hundreds of thousands) were used for supply operations. Their main use was in artillery penetration divisions, along with other artillery formations, as prime movers. This gave strategic artillery greater mobility, allowing it to help in quickly reducing Festungs (Areas to be defended to the death under Hitler's orders) and pockets. Corps and divisional artillery remained tractor or horse drawn. So lend lease vehicles were by no means decisive, but definitely very useful.
Source for this is a GAVTU (Main automobile directorate of the Red Army) report which summarizes vehicle usage in the Red Army.

Well if landlords all act like you, a big part of the pop won't be able to afford rent. You know, like in spain where a significant percentage of the population is either illegally squatting because there's no money for rent, or steal cash to pay for it. 

But that requires you to think a bit further than your own bank account so i don't expect you can even understand so alien an idea that it's bad that people end up homeless because you decided they were more endebted to you and due to legal loophole making it ""legal"" for you they can't act against you or defend themselves in anyway.

true,RamblinRambo,FINL,Finland,"It's an interesting question to be honest and there is no simple answer. I think one problem is that the ECB cannot act in either way. The whole system became hand cuffed when countries manipulated their economic strength to be allowed to join. We started off with an artificial view on what was the economic status of the EMU. That effected all ECB policy making and once the truth came out we are sitting here with countries that are drowning in debt on one side, and countries with good solid economies slowly going into depression (like Finland) on the other because the ECB cannot do anything really. If it pushes policies that will stop the strong economies from going into depression it will hurt the poor ones. If it pushes policies that will help the poor ones to gain momentum it will hurt the strong ones.

So either way the ECB looks there is a huge pile of shit waiting to hit the fan.

The EU won't do anything either. They wont force say Greece out of the EMU because that will destroy the dream of a single currency EU. They cannot prioritise the strong economies as that would be seen as unfair by others.

It's a complete mess for monetary policy and there's no way out of it as it seems. Meanwhile UK is showing great economic numbers this week and Sweden has been going well throughout the crisis, both countries free from the ECB and able to adapt monetary policy according to their needs.

Germany especially seems to want to save the euro no matter what, so that will block any attempt to actually sit down and discuss how to solve this mess.

But on top of all this there are hundreds of other issues that needs solving to get our economies going. Bankers need to be kept in line, domestic (EU) production needs to get going, trade tariffs need to be considered on some sectors and so on and so on.

I would not have guessed.

&gt;What are your own views on free movement? Do you believe in free movement of people throughout the whole world?

I do.  I think the EU borders should be entirely open.  More controversially, I do not think anyone immigrating into the EU should have the freedom to choose in which city they settle.  Programs to evenly distribute immigration seem to be a basic requirement that has been overlooked. 

&gt;Globalisation is not anti the nation state. You need to check the definition of globalisation again. 

Globalization is an umbrella term for many processes and beliefs, including:

&gt;Democratic globalization is a movement towards an institutional system of global democracy that would give world citizens a say in political organizations. This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological Non-governmental organizations (NGO), political cults and mafias. 

Line break!

&gt;As an aside, I find your worldview, that anyone who is EUsceptic is against globalisation, extremely lacking in imagination and narrow.

true,RamblinRambo,FINL,Finland,"&gt;Really? I only have dealt with British and some French/Italian Euroskeptics, and their position was very clear: the complete destruction of the Union.

The French eurosceptics are in a league of their own. The British are pissed because the referendum they had years ago was not for a political union and they want to have a say on that. UKIP is very open for trade and cooperation but is against the EU as it is today. Nothing says that they would not support European cooperation. I mean if we are honest the EU has sneakily evolved into a behemoth that most people didn't sign up to in the first place.

The True Finns that is out EU-sceptic party says that it wants a referendum. But has clearly stated that it intends to let the people decide and that it will an active member in the EU. The Danish EU-sceptics aren't also after the destruction of the EU. I mean the biggest issue for most eurosceptics is that the EU we entered isn't the EU we have today and if we want to become anything else than what we signed up for, we should be allowed to vote on it.

It truly is so that the pro-EU movement is the one that will destroy the EU. You cannot fool people, and once they feel fooled you'll never get their trust again. Had the EU been open with the people and allowed them to vote on becoming what it is today it would be a different story. The EU also needs to become more democratic than it is today and the list is long.

So in conclusion people aren't against the idea of Europe but they are against the idea of the EU we have today.

&gt;UKIP wants to leave, but their leader wants EU's destruction.

You need to understand what many mean with EU destruction. Ask me and I'll say that I want the destruction of the EU. Ask me if I would like to be part of a European Union that is democratic, has clear rules, a constitution that isn't 1000 pages I would very likely lean towards a yes. But that of course depends on the constitution, the proposed other member states etc.

&gt;What? Where did that come from?

That comes form the fact that much is decided over the heads of the people. If the pro-EU people really cared about the future of the EU they'd say. Ok, let settle this. All countries currently members of the EU have a referendum. After that it would be settled and we could move on.

...Yes, because it developed? It's like complaining that the government you are a citizen of gained more power than it originally had and you were never asked if you wanted such a government in the first place.

En preuve formelle, les théorèmes correspondent à des programmes (A implique B nous dit en gros que si on me donne du A alors je peux produire du B). C'est ce qu'on appelle la [correspondance de Curry-Howard](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondance_de_Curry-Howard).

Les objets mathématiques sont par contre des objets. Les entiers naturels par exemple sont définis comme [un type de donné inductif](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_r%C3%A9cursif#Th.C3.A9orie) avec deux constructeurs ""0"" et ""+1"" (successeur).

Un axiome c'est quelquechose qui dit ""il existe un programme qui fait du A"" sans pour autant le fournir. À l'inverse une définition c'est la donnée d'un programme qui correspond à une proposition. Par exemple, ""raisonner par induction sur l'entier *n*"" peut s'écrire comme un programme ""induction"" qui correspond à cette description :

    entrées :
      - h0  : la propriété est vraie pour 0
      - h+1 : pour tout m, si la propriété est vraie pour m alors elle est vraie pour m + 1
      - n   : un entier

    sortie :
      - la propriété est vraie pour n

    programme :
     - inspecter n
       - si n = 0     alors appliquer h0
       - si n = m + 1 alors appliquer h+1 et appeler le programme induction sur h0 h+1 et m

Bon il faut faire un peu attention parce qu'avec un programme infini on pourrait prouver n'importe quoi mais tout cela est pris en charge par le langage qui demande précisément de justifier la terminaison si jamais celle-ci n'est pas extrêmement évidente.

La distinction entre définition et axiome n'est pas bien claire : on pourrait très bien décider de prendre une axiomatisation de l'induction, ou de l'addition sur les entiers si l'on voulait. Mais on préfère écrire les programmes parce qu'ils ne sont pas bien durs et que le fait que le calcul se fasse tout seul est un sacré bonus (plus de travail pour l'ordinateur, moins pour nous !).

Pour ce qui est du processus de preuve en lui-même, dès lors qu'on a des théories un peu complexes, il est irréaliste à l'heure actuelle de faire tourner une machine pour qu'elle prouve toute seule les théorèmes (ou invente ses propres définitions qui pourraient être utiles). D'où le fait que l'on parle d'*assistants* de preuves : ce sont des programmes qui sont guidés par l'humain (qui a beaucoup de choix à faire tout comme ses collègues codeurs puisqu'il écrit au final des programmes dans un langage un peu spécial).

&gt;So, just to clarify, you think that anyone in the whole world should have the freedom to move into Europe, but then not freedom of movement within Europe? How would that policy work?

Non EU-citizens would have a multi-year period where their place of residence would have to be within a particular area, be that a country, region, or city, to prevent the build-up of primarily immigrant neighborhoods that seem to drive hardline nationalists batty and slow or reverse assimilation.  They would of course be free to travel anywhere they want, but changing their permanent residence would not be possible within this period.

true,RamblinRambo,FINL,Finland,"&gt;Every government takes power from local governments, but I rarely hear it being approved by some form of a referendum.

There is a difference if your national government makes decisions as these are more easily observed by the people. Furthermore when the people were asked to vote on the EU there was never any mention of it becoming what it is today and that is exactly where the big problem lies. If the pro-EU people truly believed that the EU is the future they need to accept that it will never work if the people in it do not support it. So for this simple reason they need to work for a new referendum in each country. So to once and for all settle the matter.

&gt;It's like complaining that the government you are a citizen of gained more power than it originally had and you were never asked if you wanted such a government in the first place.

I government cannot get more powers just like that because they'll have hell to pay the next elections and will be voted out if that were to happen and replaced by others that will remove such power.

I think you are over simplifying the whole thing. There is a huge difference in national governments and the EU and that is why there is a problem. One big one is that the EU parliament cannot even propose laws. Only a non democratically elected commission can.

&gt;And you know this how exactly?

Because resentment is growing by the day and it will keep on growing because the pro-EU section isn't willing to allow anyone to put the EU project in jeopardy through a referendum. Why is it that these precise pro-EU people are the ones voicing the loudest that the UK should not have a referendum?

&gt;Who is fooling who? What in the hell are you even talking about?

Well look at the UK. They were never asked to vote on becoming a member of the EU. The EU didn't even exist when they got to vote. So that is fooling the people. Can you really not see how that makes people angry?

&gt;The anti-EU parties don't want it to become more democratic. Who do you think is against the whole idea of a 'spitzenkandidaten'?

The question is much wider than ""spitzenkandidaten"". As I've mentioned above we have parliament that doesn't have parliamentary powers, we have a commission that wields power that we cannot elect and so on.


&gt; And after 30 years the anti-EU side would go:
""Another referendum! This isn't the E.U. we signed up for!""

Make the referendum about a Federation and not make it sound like a free trade area. Make it exactly clear that if they vote yes we will become a federation. What the EU is today was never even talked about when most countries got to vote on it and it is clearly heading towards a federation and this needs to be stopped so that people can decide if they want that or not.

What does the EU have to loose if it truly believes in its own existence to allow the people to decide. Then move on with the ones that vote yes. The only reason a vote would be denied is because they know that they do not have the support for what they are doing.

In confronto a quelli di google, offrono prestazioni di pari livello.

Also: hai provato a lasciare i dns nel router di default, ma ad impostarli nelle settings delle connessioni nei dispositivi?

Most countries have previously signed treaties as they were to small to say no. Now if the EU wants to be a big player it can start looking for its own interest as well. But first and foremost end the US from trying to think it can dictate everything in Europe.

It is still a government.

&gt;Furthermore when the people were asked to vote on the EU there was never any mention of it becoming what it is today and that is exactly where the big problem lies.

There was. That's why they voted on it in the first place.

&gt;If the pro-EU people truly believed that the EU is the future they need to accept that it will never work if the people in it do not support it.

So, you believe that the pro-EU's side belief is that the EU would continue even IF it has no support? Where did you even get this idea from?

&gt;I government cannot get more powers just like that because they'll have hell to pay the next elections and will be voted out if that were to happen and replaced by others that will remove such power.

Exactly. So, how did the E.U. get more power, and those who support it didn't get voted out of power, if people didn't agree to it in some form or another?

&gt;One big one is that the EU parliament cannot even propose laws.

It can force the Commission to draft legislation.

From the EP's website:

&gt;Initiative under Article 225 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union

&gt;On the basis of a report by one of its committees, under Article 225 TFEU, Parliament, acting by a majority of its Members, may request the Commission to submit any appropriate legislative proposal. Parliament may, at the same time, set a deadline for the submission of such a proposal. The Parliament committee responsible must first ask the Conference of Presidents for authorisation.

&gt;A proposal for a Union act on the basis of the right of initiative granted to Parliament under Article 225 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union may also be proposed by an individual Member of the European Parliament. Such a proposal shall be submitted to the President of the Parliament who refers it to the committee responsible for consideration.

It isn't the complete legislative initiative have, but it isn't non-existent as you claimed.

&gt;They were never asked to vote on becoming a member of the EU. The EU didn't even exist when they got to vote.

What? They voted to join the EEC, which even then wasn't just an economic area. If people didn't agree to the transformation from EEC to the E.U., those who were in favor of it would have been voted out of power.

&gt;Because resentment is growing by the day 

[That isn't what the polls say.](http://youtu.be/0x4sihH2fSY?t=13m3s)

&gt;we have a commission that wields power that we cannot elect and so on.

And which sides political parties want the Commission to be non-electable, and be appointed behind closed doors by heads of states?

&gt;Why is it that these precise pro-EU people are the ones voicing the loudest that the UK should not have a referendum?

Because they don't think its necessary. If people think the same, they will support those parties which think the same way. If not, then the referendum will be held.

&gt;Make the referendum about a Federation and not make it sound like a free trade area. Make it exactly clear that if they vote yes we will become a federation.

true,CushtyJVftw,UKGB,United Kingdom,"One cannot simply judge the feasibility of the USSR winning WW2 on their own on their use of lend-lease. The entirety of German and Soviet strategy would be changed if Britain, and later the US, was not involved.

The most likely point for Britain to peace out with Germany would be if Dunkirk were to fail in mid 1940. This would leave Britain with basically no troops, no equipment and the Nazis with 300,000 British soldiers. Perhaps then Britain would agree to a truce.

With Britain out of the way, Germany would have no need to invade Norway, or help Italy in Greece. This would allow them to declare war on the USSR as early as they wanted in 1941, perhaps May. Furthermore, the Battle of Britain would not need to be carried out, allowing the Luftwaffe to be far stronger when operation barbarossa began.

However, the USSR, knowing they were Hitler's only enemy remaining, could focus on their western front far more than historically. In real life, Stalin believed much of their own intelligence reports to be British fabrications attempting to make them join the war. This would not be the case if Britain were out of the war.

Even if Germany were to fail to reach Moscow in 1941, I wouldn't be surprised if a 1942 offensive could be decisive. They would have no lack of fuel because the British blockade would be non-existent, thus could push directly for Moscow or Stalingrad instead of the Caucasus.

As the war dragged on, if it dragged on, Germany wouldn't need to spend manpower and material on the construction of the Atlantic Wall or repairing industry after strategic bombings, they could pour everything into the Eastern Front. The USSR might suffer without lend-lease, albeit perhaps not very much.

In my opinion, Germany could have won if the British peaced out in mid 1940, as all of their efforts could be focused on the Eastern Front.",0,1402093188,null,0,false,0,ci127qs,t3_27h25d,t1_ci127qs,t1_ci0yrmq,null,1434126544,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

What about such issues as the German Turks with dual citizenship needing to either fulfill compulsory military service of a year or pay the state of Turkey a sum of a few thousand euro's. The EU already suffers the detrimental effect of these unintegrated minorities, has some of them being controlled by shady Turkish governmental agencies or even domestically educated in Turkish ''Gulen'' schools and Turkey collects a fair share of those with dual citizenship buying off their service with euro's.

This seems just another leftist hobby spending money into a bottomless well, achieving nothing. Meanwhile we have Erdogan calling on Turks in Germany not to integrate or assimilate but to remain Turkish, playing on the rampant hyper nationalism.

* A move away from Federalism

Do those two things and about half of the ""Eurosceptics"" in the EU are happy. That's compromise, and none of it would destroy the EU.

true,RamblinRambo,FINL,Finland,"&gt;It is still a government.

The EU is no government but it has powers that surpass the national government when it passes laws so there is a huge democratic deficit here.

&gt;There was. That's why they voted on it in the first place.

So you're saying that the UK voters knew that the EU was going to become a political union moving closer to a federation. Is that what you are saying?

&gt;So, you believe that the pro-EU's side belief is that the EU would continue even IF it has no support? Where did you even get this idea from?

If that wasn't the case, why is the pro-EU side so against the UK having a referendum, and why isn't it pushing for every country to have a referendum to settle the matter once and for all? The only logical reason is that they do not dare to do so.

&gt; So, how did the E.U. get more power, and those who support it didn't get voted out of power, if people didn't agree to it in some form or another?

This comes down to the EU having powers that surpasses the national government. It might be ok for some states as when they voted to join the EU was closer to its current form than in others. Furthermore a national government cannot remove passed EU law, they can remove national laws passed by the previous government. Big difference.

&gt;It can force the Commission to draft legislation.

And we all know how well that works. The issue here is that it should not need to force the commission to draft laws is should have the power to do so itself. Like any other parliament.

&gt;They voted to join the EEC, which even then wasn't just an economic area. If people didn't agree to the transformation from EEC to the E.U., those who were in favor of it would have been voted out of power.

It is clear to me that you refuse to see the issue that anti-EU representatives have. Nor are you willing to accept that there is a call for the need to have a referendum on the EU as it stands today. As I said earlier, the national government can remove laws passed by the previous government. The national government of one country cannot force the EU to remove laws approved by the previous one.

&gt;That isn't what the polls say.

Polls are polls, they are not a referendum. No matter what numbers you or anyone else presents the only thing that will settle the matter is an actual referendum.

&gt;And which sides political parties want the Commission to be non-electable, and be appointed behind closed doors by heads of states?

What does it matter what or which parties want the commission to be non-electable. The big question here is that there is a need for a referendum and that people want the EU to be reformed from the ground up.

&gt;Because they don't think its necessary.

Finally. This is the big issue. Right here. If countries such as France an the UK have had huge wins for the anti-EU parties, how can it then not be necessary to hold a referendum. If you think that it isn't necessary to hold a referendum then you are in fact the exact reason why it will be the pro-EU side that will be the end of the union. As this many people being against the system you are promoting will in the end break it from within. So if you truly believe that there is a future let the people speak. Either the pro-side wins and it will have the political support to push forward or it doesn't and it will be questioned and undermined every step of the way.

&gt;It isn't the pro-EU side which has to get a referendum, it is the anti-EU side.

As I said above, if you don't push it the ""revolt"" will grow stronger and kill the thing you are promoting. It is just the reality of things.

National governments also would be ineffectual if local governments could remove laws passed by the legislature.

Isn't that kind of what you're doing already. Ridiculously low corporate taxes pissing of the UK and other, while still being happy to take money from the EU to bail you out.

Don't get me wrong I used to live in Ireland and live with and Irish girlfriend so I don't intend to be rude. I just mean that I completely agree with you. Ireland cannot be half in and half out. Either it is in or out. 

There seems to be very much a mentality in the Dáil that take but not give. But this isn't just limited to Irelands foreign policy, it is the same domestically. Huge tax breaks are given to corporations such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, IBM etc. while people are taxed fairly heavily, public schools and healthcare is poor and infrastructure in general lacking and every once in a while one politician gets busted for being corrupt.

It's really frustrating to watch and I can see where your coming from when saying ""this freeloader attitude is frighteningly prevalent"". I personally really like Ireland and it is sad that there is so much slacking among politicians there. One reason I decided to move instead of staying was that this ""ah It'll be grand"" attitude is everywhere relating to government or city council and nothing gets fixed.

true,MoreGott,,,"I came here, ready to post about my views. As I was a student of history and still am interested in it, I know about D-Day and its celebration. I wanted to give some points about German politicians not being invited for a long time, as Germany was not viewed as a liberated and now peaceful country, but as a defeated and still kind of dangerous state, which is why there has not been that much news about the celebrations in the past. That the D-Day is a great and good celebration for many states, but that maybe the real celebration should be the day, Germany surrendered, not just a day when the beginning of the end got accelerated. 

But then I read through your posts. First I thought you just misunderstood. But as others like /u/Hobbycoder have pointed out, you just came here with an opinion about what Germans should think about D-Day and then twisted most of the serious answers to your question so they said what you wanted to hear (which seems like ""Germans don't like D-Day, hate being defeated and are ignorant of the misery their grandfathers inflicted upon other peoples and should be more grateful to the Americans"").

We ARE grateful. Some of us just haven't heard much about one of the many events that led to the end of the war, as for us it is more about finally getting rid of Hitler and his henchmen.

If you are a student of psychology and aiming to be in that line of work, which you seem to be hinting, then please PLEASE study way harder or just choose another line of work.

Da das Feld sehr umfangreich ist, habe ich noch keine deutliche Richtung, in welche ich mich weiterbilden soll. Ich habe ein Semester Hüttenkunde und Materialkunde gern und sehr erfolgreich absolviert. Durch die Teilnahme an einem Reaktorentwurfskurs und einem Wärme- und Stofftransportkurs konnte ich erste Einblicke im Feld des Verfahrensentwurfes gewinnen. Bei XXXXXX könnte ich entweder im Bereich Materialkunde oder Verfahrensentwurf arbeiten. Ich bin mir sicher, dass ich eine kompetente Bereicherung in beiden Feldern sein würde. Durch dieses Praktikum hoffe ich meinem Traum als Verfahrenstechniker näher zu kommen.
Nach drei Jahren an der Uni bin ich nicht nur in technischen Themen und Kenntnissen bewandert. Zu diesen kommen neben dem Umgang mit Microsoft Office, Matlab, Mathematica, Polymath, und Arduino (eine Art von C++), auch noch die Fähigkeit mit gesprochenem und geschriebenen Deutsch zu glänzen. Während des Semesters vor meinem Praktikum wird mein Deutsch sicher noch besser. Ich erwarte mit Überschwänglichkeit mein Jahr in Deutschland, als eine spannende Aufgabe, und als eine Gelegenheit zu persönlichem Wachstum.""

Ci sono anche dei libri cult, come ""Harrington on hold'em tournaments"", ma devi sapere che ogni autore ha un suo stile, e questo tizio qui è un po noioso ( in quanto starai a foldare il 99% delle mani nelle prime fasi ) ma funziona bene per principianti.

Se non vuoi leggere, ci sono siti specializzati come card-runners, che hanno mille video tutorial di gente che guadagna un fottio con il poker ( e non di immagini tv ). Funzionano molto bene, ma in base al sito scelto possono essere cari.

Inizia anche a leggere la sezione no limit di 2p2 e volendo fatti un account per postare le mani su cui hai dubbi.

Vor ca. 10 Jahren hatte ich einen Freund. Er konnte fast kein Englisch. Ich habe mir aber sehr gerne die Originalversionen von ""The Simpsons"" und ""Futurama"" angesehen. Anfangs schlief er immer nach 5 Minuten ein da ihm die englische Sprache zu anstrengend war. Aber nach einigen Monaten war es für Ihn kein Problem mehr zuzuschauen. Jetzt konnten wir dannach auch noch etwas anderes machen. Das war toll.

Der Mann liefert das als Argument gegen eine Überlegenheit des Veganismus. Ich bezweifle sehr, dass er den Umkehrschluss für zulässig hält. Damit ließe sich dann ja z.B. auch Ernährungsblüten ala ""ich ess nur Rindfleisch"" rechtfertigen.

&gt; Totschlagargument. Wer sich allgemein nicht mit seiner Ernährung beschäftigt dem drohen Defizite oder Folgeeerkankungen. Das gilt auch für Leute die z.b. jeden Tag ein Kilo Pommes und ein Pfund Hack essen.

Übertreibung. Wenn man sich normal ernährt, also im Prinzip einfach ""von allem ein bisschen was"" isst, kann man recht problemlos ohne Defizite und Folgeerkrankungen durchs Leben kommen. Auch wenn man sich nicht genauer mit Ernährung beschäftigt.

&gt; Mangel an B12 kommt auch bei Leuten vor die nicht vegan oder vegeratisch leben. 

Die meisten Menschen essen eher zu viele als zu wenige tierische Produkte. Mangel an B12 bei Normalos ist also möglich, aber reichlich unwahrscheinlich. Bei Veganern ist er dagegen ein großes Risiko.

Whoa... öhm.. also ehrlich gesagt, ich persönlich kenne eigentlich ausschließlich dicke Veganer.

In einem Extremfall wurde die Pizza Margaritha zu vegan deklariert und nach einer mehrjährigen Ernährung fast ausschließlich von Pizza und Schokolade (ist das Fett da drin eigentlich tierisch? Gut, dass ich das nicht wissen muss..) ist jetzt eine längere ärztliche Behandlung fällig.

Völlig abgesehen davon, dass ein solches Kind in der Pubertät vermutlich aus der üblichen Trotzhaltung heraus anfangen wird, die Rindersteaks tonnenweise reinzuschieben.. man sollte das Kind finde ich prinzipiell einfach essen lassen was es mag, darauf achten dass es sich nicht zu einseitig ernährt, schauen dass es alles mal probiert hat.

&gt; With fiscal policy still neutral or contractionary across much of the zone, penalising savers and subsidising borrowers is unlikely to spark recovery on its own.

Is particularly concerning. In austerity moments where households are struggling, setting fire to people's savings (negative interest rates) is hardly going to get people to spend more. *Yes*, borrowing is cheaper now, but that's only useful if you expect prospects in the future to improve. It's a real chicken/egg problem there - if you're saving, you're worse off now, if you're borrowing.. you believe the recovery to already be on its way. So what in this policy kick-starts a recovery?

&gt; The negative borrowing rate (now a 0.1% charge) on money deposited by banks is designed to make them lend the money instead of keeping it in reserve.

1) Not for employment, for employment your degree is sufficient. 

Master of Trade degree is not easy. I don't know the exact rules, but it takes a certain number of years of experience after getting your initial degree and then 1-3 years of school (depending whether you do it part-time or full time). School is in German. You have to attend a master's school, some of them charge fees. A lot depends upon the area you are in bc in most cases you'll want a school that is close by. 

You'll get more qualified answers from the Handwerkskammer in the area you are looking at. You'll also need to have your degree recognised as equal to a German Gesellenbrief.

Moving to Germany from Italy with only the permanent residency card can be a not so smart move.

Actually, you shouldn't compare absolute figures. You have to look at the death rate among regular consumers, not the population as a whole. You also have to ask where that doctor got his figures (is it, for example, two recorded deaths in Germany ever, two deaths in the last year among his own patients, or what?). There are other factors you need to consider: smokers of weed, because of its highly illegal status, might be more inclined to smoke at home, while consumers of alcohol will be more likely to drink in a bar and then try to drive home.

edit for clarification: ""material goods"" do not have to be goods with material at all (such as clothes).. just stuff that are good to have but aren't technically a necessity. a frappe mixer is likely a material good.

edit #2: Posnania posted the proper definition.

The European Union is in deep trouble. Growth is sluggish at best, unemployment punishingly high and deflation threatens. The European elections returned many populist, anti-EU members to the European Parliament; public support for the project has plummeted. Against this background, the squabble over who should be the next president of the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, looks an ever more dangerous tragicomedy: Franz Kafka meets Dario Fo.

The front-runner for the job is Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured). The former prime minister of Luxembourg was picked as “lead candidate” by the centre-right pan-European political group, the European People’s Party (EPP), in March. He stands for the cosy federalist consensus that many European voters want to change. He was an ineffectual head of the euro group of finance ministers, creating doubts over his ability to run the commission—a huge job at the moment.

Most EU leaders, including Angela Merkel, the union’s de facto empress, consider Mr Juncker a bad choice. But since the EPP has the most seats in the parliament, his supporters claim that to seek any alternative is to deny democracy. Mrs Merkel was hounded by the German press for flirting with other names such as Christine Lagarde, the French head of the IMF. The only strong opposition to Mr Juncker comes from David Cameron, who fears Britain will be more likely to leave the EU if Mr Juncker is its public face. But Mr Cameron has no veto in the decision and since everything associated with Eurosceptic Britain is toxic in Brussels, his opposition is making it harder for the others to drop Mr Juncker.

It is not even clear that Mr Juncker wants the job. He is said by some to prefer becoming president of the European Council of national leaders. So Europe’s rulers could put somebody they do not want in a job he may not want.

It is possible that this is an example of the Merkelvellianism for which the German chancellor has gained a reputation: by dithering, she is letting enough opposition emerge for her “regretfully” to dump Mr Juncker (or give him the council job) and hand the commission to a better candidate. Our preference would be Ms Lagarde, but other competent names being proposed include Enda Kenny of Ireland, Jyrki Katainen of Finland and Pascal Lamy, a French Socialist and former boss of the World Trade Organisation.

Democratic values

By even entertaining the option of Mr Juncker, Europe’s leaders have indulged two dangerous fantasies for their union. The first is that “more of the same” is an option. In fact, without reform, Europe faces stagnation or even break-up.

The second fantasy is that the parliament is somehow more democratic than the European Council of (elected) heads of government. This is nonsense. Hardly any European voters have heard of Mr Juncker. They treat European elections as second-order national polls. In every single EU country, turnout is much higher in national elections. Under the Lisbon treaty, the European Council, “taking into account the elections to the European Parliament”, is meant to nominate a candidate who is then “elected” by the parliament. By insisting that it will block anybody other than Mr Juncker, the parliament is trying to deny the European Council its prerogative.

The folly of indulging this second fantasy could be revealed very quickly. Imagine that Mr Juncker withdraws and Mr Lamy or Ms Lagarde is pushed forward. The European Parliament, which now believes itself the acme of democracy, might well say no. Europe will then find that its economic crisis is followed by an—entirely avoidable—constitutional one.",0,1402131281,null,0,false,0,ci1dhzv,t3_27ew47,t1_ci1dhzv,t3_27ew47,null,1434131978,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

First of all every person I've met never called the city ""Volgograd"" all of them said something along these lines: ""I'm going on vacation in STALINGRAD"" or ""I have gotten a new job in STALINGRAD"" you see now why people want the name to be changed? Even themselves don't refer to it as ""Volgograd"" the fact that it has the name of a dictator doesn't mean jack. 
Secondly the history. People who look at the map trying to find Stalingrad the place where the bloodiest battle in history took place will never find it because some twat decided it would be best to change the name (Same goes with Leningrad).



But what I'm even bothering trying to explain this to you. You're more than likely projecting like a mad-man and you won't accept facts. All you think about is ""Hurr durr Russia evil Poland good""

The Party congress 'votes', but how everyone is going to 'vote' is generally decided in quiet, behind-the-scenes discussions and the congress is supposed to vote how they're told. The courts aren't independent because the they follow Party directives rather than rule of law. So the only people who are really in charge of managing corruption among Party members are Party members, lol. 

When members of China's ruling elite lose power in a 'corruption' scandal, it's almost never about the corruption itself. Usually it's the end result of a mafia-like power struggle between two enemies or competing camps in the same 'family'.  The losing side gets slapped with a corruption charge for something that they all do, like smuggling money out of the country or having too many mistresses. On the few occasions politicians are prosecuted for corruption, its usually so obvious and well-publicized that the powers that be can't *not* prosecute, like if someone gets footage of a politician banging an underage girl, or if a foreigner from a first world country dies and it looks like the politician was involved. 

Unlike China, Romania actually seems to have a mostly independent judiciary now. Also, not everyone the courts are prosecuting are politicians, they're prosecuting insanely rich people who just support whatever side supports business and not asking too many questions. Doesn't look like their political contributions are paying off at the moment.

In fact a recent study even found that smokers of cannabis and cigarettes had a lower cancer risk than those of just cigarettes, combined with the 1979 study showing Cannabis' anti-cancerous effects on cells, that's important information.

What I've been reading here sounds a lot like mainsteam knowledge about Cannabis in the U.S. perhaps in the early '90s.

""It's illegal"", as if law is dictated from the gods and is never to be questioned or changed. Your Cannabis laws came from treaty and trade requirements dictated by the U.S. and their drug war some years ago.

Thinking there is danger to Cannabis but never knowing what that could possibly be and only finding conjecture. There has been a massive education of the public in the U.S. and more and more studies (as they finally allowed studies to be conducted) to show that not only is Cannabis not dangerous, it has incredibly healing and helpful properties for vast amounts of ailments, mainly due to its Cannabinoids, for which we have Cannabinoid receptors all throughout our body.

Anti-cancerous, anti-inflammatory, pain numbing, anti-anxiety, anti-depressant. This helps people with many serious diseases that would otherwise have no options, or options only of Opiates (legal, and horrific, I think we can all agree Opium is no good at all) or drugs that have vastly dangerous side effects, when Cannabis has 0 side effects (maybe dry mouth with some strains?) unless you count euphoria as a side effect, I think that's a good effect.

The paranoia you mention actually comes from the effect that THC and Cannabinoids have been shown to repair the Hippocampus in the brain (bridge between conscious mind and sub/unconscious, also known as the  pathway for memories storage), and during this time your conscious mind has a more direct connection to your subconscious mind. As a result, you experience/realize things you previously pushed down due to ignorance/fear/pride, etc. and recall and process them fully. Generally more recent things, but this can be too overwhelming for some people, this heightened state of awareness and perception. It is not to be taken lightly. But there is no damage besides someone with a better view of things :P

But if nominating the Commission President is a power they don't want to cede to the Parliament, they have to act now before the Parliament's interpretation of the Lisbon Treaty is effectively ratified by precedent.

Really interesting article that sums up both sides' points of view on this, 'Never mind the Spitzenkandidaten: It's all about politics' here: www.ceps.be/ceps/dld/9363/pdf

And I also agree that the Parliament has every right to vote down any Council nominee. I don't think it would be smart though. 

However much people here might think MEPs telling national leaders what to do is a victory of democracy over backroom deals, it will be presented as ""faceless Eurocrats telling us what to do!"" by leaders and large parts of the press.

Dein Kommentar und deine Wortwahl  waren auch nur der Auslöser für meinen Exkurs, der dann doch eher allgemeinerer Natur war.

Ganz allgemein ist eine Entwicklung, auch eine gesellschaftliche Entwicklung, ein Prozess. Ein Prozess wird so beschrieben, als dass ein Produkt zu unterschiedlichen Zeiten voneinander verschiedene Zustände hat.

Die Leibeigenschaft wiederum zeichnet sich dadurch aus, dass das eigene leibliche Wohl, die eigene Entscheidungsfreiheit und somit die eigene Persönlichkeit einer Person vom Willen einer anderen, mächtigeren Person abhängig ist.

Dass es formell in unseren Breiten keine Leibeigenen mehr gibt wie im Mittelalter, bestreite ich nicht. Aber auch das war und ist eine gesellschaftliche Entwicklung, ein Prozess, mit unterschiedlichen Zuständen und Ausprägungen.

Auch heute finden sich noch Arbeitsverträge, in denen Angestellten verboten wird schwanger zu werden.

Es wird Mitarbeitern untersagt, amouröse Beziehungen zu Kunden zu unterhalten.

Das sind für Deutschland rechtswidrige Beispiele; viele Arbeitnehmer sind aber nicht aufgeklärt oder scheuen einen Konflikt, weshalb sich solche Eingriffe ins persönliche Leben immer noch halten und gesellschaftlich akzeptiert sind.

Du hast das gut gesagt: Wir können wirklich nicht unser Wertesystem, quasi als Schablone, über andere Gesellschaften legen und sie danach bewerten. Und umgekehrt ist es aber genau so fahrlässig - nämlich den Zustand einer fremden Gesellschaft mit dem der unseren zu vergleichen, um dann in einem selbstgerechten Gefühl der ""besseren Welt"" zu entschlummern.

Das alles möchte ich dir nicht unterstellen, es ist nur eine allgemeine Beobachtung.

My go-to dictionary is the Collins Dictionary, which subsequently was renamed when Ultralinqua acquired the firm (as an aside the Ultralinqua Dictionary for the Mac OS desktop isn't worth buying).

I use Anki for Flashcards.  I wound up using Anki too much to be honest.  It's really easy to wind up with too many flashcard and becoming a slave to the timed repetition.  Also, as far as flashcards go, Anki is simply and *only* a flashcard creation &amp; display engine.  It doesn't come with any German language flashcard with the default install.  Because sharing decks is so easy, there a lots of choices for german language content to be found.  However, in my experience, making the decks is an important part of the learning experience and it better to tailor the content to courses you are taking anyway. 

I also have several versions of the Langensheidt dictionaries, including the standard and DaF editions.  They are more comprehensive, I think, than the Collins. However, I found that the user interface on the Collins allowed me to use it faster and more successfully in class.  The Langensheidt also offer a flashcards feature.  I use Anki and actual paper for my flashcards, so I can't comment to much.

I went through a number of ""free"" dictionaries... none of them really impressed me.  I felt that Ultralinqua was worth the purchase price and failing that, I think I'd prefer using websites like dict.cc or leo.org.  Dict.cc also has an app which stores some data making it somewhat useable offline.  I was relatively satisfied with being able to assist my former classmates with its Bosnian and Hungarian to German... though it was not as comprehensive as either the Langensheidt or Collins DE&lt;&gt;EN Dictionaries.

At one point, while I was *really* struggling with adjective declension and grammar, I used an app which only generated adjective declension &amp; article quizzes.  I'm convinced this was the difference between a ""good"" and ""acceptable"" (or perhaps worse) on the exam for that semester.


I know that doulingo is available for the iPad... but I think it requires an internet connection.

Spitzenkandidaten and MEPs taking the initiative to nominate the Commission president, depending on whichever group wins the European election, can be fairly called a constitutional power grab.

true,todayohboy,null,null,"&gt; C'est facile de dire ""c'est une invasion"" . C'est facile et simpliste de dire ""il faut stopper l'immigration clandestine"". 

Mais justement, je ne fais pas que dire cela. Je montre pourquoi il faut le faire, et quelles mesures prendre pour commencer.

&gt;En attendant je ne pense pas que l'immigration soit arrêtable (salut les US)

Il ne s'agit pas de tout arrêter, mais de la limiter drastiquement. C'est comme si tu disais, ""il est impossible de faire appliquer toutes les lois, il faudrait envisager de supprimer la loi"".

Et bien je pense que 60% de l'immigration clandestine est arrêtable, et que 80% de clandestins sont renvoyables aux frontières, pour 2500 euros par clandestin, soit moins que ce le coût annuel en santé d'un clandestin (auquel il faut ajouter tous les autres coûts).

&gt;il faudrait à mon avis commencer à se poser des questions à propos de notre rapport à l'immigration pour voir comment on pourrait tous mieux vivre ensemble

C'est-à-dire ?

Qu'est-ce que tu proposes ?

J'ai réfléchi à la question et je n'ai trouvé aucun moyen financièrement réalisable dans les conditions actuelles (chômage de masse, pénurie de logements, augmentation de la pauvreté, montée des communautarismes et dette publique immense empêchant toute initiative publique d'ampleur).

&gt;il est utopique de vouloir stopper un flux humain quasi naturel qui a toujours existé et qui existera toujour.

Source sur le fait que ça a toujours existé ?

L'immigration massive n'a pas toujours existé, ça s'est limité à quelques conquérants.

D'autre part, tu proposes quoi à ces migrants ?

Une vie dans des logements surpeuplés et délabrés, de chômage, de pauvreté, avec des enfants qui seront confrontés, voire dans certains cas entraînés dans la délinquance ?

On n'arrive pas à permettre une vie digne à de nombreux Français, il est illusoire qu'on arrivera à le faire pour des gens pauvres, peu éduqués et d'une culture si différente.

&gt;si on commence à voir les immigrants comme des gens qui nous sont dommageables et qu'on ne souhaite pas, ça risque de faire des étincelles à un moment ou un autre...

Ce sont les faits. L'immigration clandestine est un coût immense pour la collectivité.

Les migrants ne sont pas des chances pour la France, c'est la France qui est une chance pour les migrants, et il faut que ça soit très clair dans la tête de tout le monde.

&gt;si le mec est persuadé qu'une vie meilleure ainsi qu'un avenir pour ses enfants existe pour lui en Europe, il fera tout pour y arriver.

On peut agir sur l'ampleur du phénomène. Le diviser au bas mot par 5, à des nombres que l'on serait capables de gérer en tenant compte de nos exigences envers nous mêmes (soins, éducation, logement, etc.).

Par contre, à ce rythme là, il est tout simplement impossible de continuer à donner des soins gratuits et une éducation gratuite pour leurs enfants. Nous n'en avons pas les moyens sans nous mettre en danger nous mêmes.

&gt;Mr Poroshenko, the owner of the Roshen chocolates group, took the oath of office and laid out a programme for ending the crisis that included an offer of early regional elections in the east and a decentralisation of power to the regional administrations.

&gt;Mr Poroshenko called on separatists in the east to lay down their arms, saying he would guarantee indemnity from criminal charges to all those who did not have blood on their hands.

&gt;But he added: ""Talking to gangsters and killers is not our path.""

&gt;The BBC's David Stern in Kiev says part of the speech was in Russian - directed at those in strife-torn Donbass - and offered concessions on Russian language and a corridor for Russian fighters to return home.

So, Ukraine's position since Yanukovych left power has been to: associate with the EU and maybe work towards membership, maintain control of all of their territory, remove Russia armed forces from their territory (both in Crimea and the East). 

Russia's position has been to maintain Ukraine as an ally (satellite state) or at the very least a neutral partner. This might be achieved through introducing a federal system so that the central government of Ukraine becomes too weak to make serious foreign policy decisions (like choosing between the EU and Russia). 

Poroshenko has made clear that most separatists will not be charged, and Russian armed forces can leave Ukraine without fear. He believe Crimea should still be part of Ukraine, but he is willing to give the Eastern regions some autonomy. The autonomy point looks like it alludes to Russia's long term demand for decentralisation of power, but also site steps the major problem with that decentralising, which is that it would have made Ukraine too weak to make foreign policy decisions. Crimea would naturally, return to its previous state of regional independence. Poroshenko's move on the Ukrainian language law is also progress in easing some of the Eastern Rebel's alleged concerns. 

TL;DR Seems like a good half way house between what Ukraine and Russia want. Compromise is the only way out of these kinds of situations, and I am very glad to see it happening.

Edit: Also, most of your links hardly even mention specific austerity policies. ""Students will not get debt forgiveness after 25 years"" is the only one that sounds almost like austerity. Where are the lowered wages and pensions? Where are the closed schools and hospitals? I'm shocked that you think this kind of thing entitles you to whine about austerity.

Whatever the case, while I can see the reasoning behind austerity measures, I never understood how it could be a good idea to slash health care spending (and investments in education, for that matter) as was done in the crisis, that's *the* perfect recipe to get your educated and wealthy packing and leave the country.

And vice versa, but in all cases dictatorships have to expend extra effort in suppressing people. That's a net loss, and on average that loss makes them inferior.

&gt;Just because some dictatorships are evil, doesn't mean that all dictatorships are evil.

They are by definition.

&gt;A dictatorial system can be put in place willingly and it can be removed.  The fact that decisions can't be opposed doesn't mean you can't create a dictatorial system in which a dictator can be put in and out of office. No it's not. If you apply a trias politica you can keep it in check.

No, then it's not a dictatorship. If you can remove the dictator it's not a dictatorship. If you have separation of powers it's not a dictatorship.

&gt;The date at which voting rights we're given didn't happen over the centuries

Democracy is so much more than voting. It's also individual rights, protections against abuse and whimsical laws, options and traditions of negotiation, freeer press etc., all the way back to the magna charta, town charters, estate representation etc. etc.

&gt;It's pretty clear what people worry about the most. The government successfully tackling these issues could immensely boost government trust.

People still do disagree about *how* these issues should be tackled. It's the same answer to the question ""why can't we let technocrats make the hard decisions?"": well, who's going to decide which technocrats get their say?

&gt;It will if those decisions actually work.

So you rely on a dictatorship being more effective than a democracy, but there's no reason to assume that.

But what I think is really important, is that Russia might be faltering. The second round of sanctions are in place and the fear of more has sent Russian markets and the Russian economy into a downwards spiral. Obama has given an ultimatum that the third round will come into effect if Putin does not engage with the new Kiev government after one month and Putin already asked the rebels to slow down and stop on certain issues (which they didn't listen to). I think this last point illustrates a certain level of apprehensiveness on his part. I think Russia would jump at the opportunity to drop this situation. I don't imagine that they intended for it to be playing out for so long or be so expensive or have yielded so few results for the Russians. 

If Russian support for the rebels is withdrawn, they'll likely fall apart before the Ukrainian forces have a chance to finish the fight.

Still arguing that no Sovereignty was lost in any of those Treaties? What about Lisbon's Self-Amending process? What about what the UK public vote on at the General Elections vs EU Elections?

A Meister is not required if you are employed. 

If you want to get a Meister, you have to pass the examination at the local Handwerkskammer. 

You don't have to take the offered training course, but it's pretty hard to pass the exam without it.

Natürlich ist ein Abschluss dort völlig gleichwertig wie an anderen Universitäten, es lassen sich dort aber nicht alle ""typischen"" Universitätsfächer studieren. 

Also wäre zum Beispiel das MIT (Cambridge) keine ""Volluniversität"", weil man dort nicht Jura (Recht) oder Medizin studieren kann. Das ist für den Abschluss aber völlig egal. ""Technische Universitäten"" sind auf jeden Fall gleichwertig. 

Im Wikipedialink von TheTiltster wäre nur zu beachten, dass ""Fachhochschulen"" etwas praxisorientierter sind und als spürbar leichter gelten. Der Abschluss ist dann auch nicht gleichwertig. Das müsstest Du vielleicht vorher mit deiner Universität klären, ob das deinen Anforderungen entspricht.


Stuttgart und Aachen (RWTH) haben auf jeden Fall einen guten Klang. Es kommt aber natürlich auch darauf an, was für Fächer Du benötigst. Die allerwichtigsten Fächer wirst Du vermutlich sowieso nicht im Auslandssemester machen wollen. Da reichen sicher auch die Universitäten, wo Luft&amp;Raumfahrt ""nur"" eine Vertiefung ist.
Außerdem musst du wissen, welchen Wert du auf das Umfeld legst. Dresden ist z.B. auch eine tolle Stadt und mit Sicherheit viel billiger als Stuttgart, München oder Berlin. Eine Wohnung zu finden ist in Dresden auch schwer, aber in Berlin oder München praktisch unmöglich (wenn man keine Connections hat).

There are several factors at play here. Before, people had jobs and therefore health insurance which covered a huge part of the cost of medicine. Second, even if you have insurance now, the insurance funds can't pay the pharmacists so you have to pay for your medicine out of your pocket. Hospitals used to not have an entrance fee, now they do.

&gt; **Cuts to public health spending**

&gt; In health, the key objective of the reforms was to reduce, rapidly and drastically, public expenditure by capping it at 6% of GDP. To meet this threshold, stipulated in Greece’s bailout agreement, public spending for health is now less than any of the other pre-2004 European Union members. In 2012, in an effort to achieve specific targets, the Greek Government surpassed the Troika’s demands for cuts in hospital operating costs and pharmaceutical spending. The former Minister of Health, Andreas Loverdos, admitted that “the Greek public administration...uses butcher’s knives [to achieve the cuts].” The negative eff ects of these cuts are already beginning to manifest.

&gt; Prevention and treatment programmes for illicit drug use faced large cuts, at a time of increasing need associated
with economic hardship. In 2009–10, the first year of austerity, a third of the street work programmes were cut
because of scarcity of funding, despite a documented rise in the prevalence of heroin use. At the same time, the
number of syringes and condoms distributed to drug users fell by 10% and 24%, respectively. hese events had
the expected effects on the health of this vulnerable population; the number of new HIV infections among
injecting drug users rose from 15 in 2009 to 484 in 2012 and preliminary data for 2013 suggest that the
incidence of tuberculosis among this population has more than doubled compared with 2012. Although needle and
syringe distribution has since increased, partly in response to media reports and popular pressure, distribution is still well below the minimum target of 200 per drug user per year recommended by the European Centre for Disease Control.

&gt; In his first act at the end of June, 2013, Adonis Georgiadis, the new Minister of Health (the fourth in a little more than a year), re-introduced a controversial law stipulating forced testing for infectious diseases under police supervision for drug users, prostitutes, and immigrants—a move that is not only unethical but also  counterproductive, because it deters marginalised groups from seeking testing during HIV outbreaks. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS has called for the repeal of the law, because it “could serve to justify actions that violate human rights”.

&gt; Additionally, drastic reductions to municipality budgets have led to a scaling back of several activities (eg, mosquito-spraying programmes), which, in combination with other factors, has allowed the re-emergence of locally
transmitted malaria for the first time in 40 years.

&gt; Through a series of austerity measures, the public hospital budget was reduced by 26% between 2009 and
2011, a substantial drop in view of the fact that expenditure should have increased through automatic stabilisers.
Evidence of the health effects of these cuts, at a time of increasing demand, is scarce, but staff workloads have increased and waiting lists have grown according to some accounts.Rural areas have particular difficulties, with shortages of medicines and medical equipment. 

&gt; Another key cost targeted by the Troika was publicly funded pharmaceutical expenditure, for which reform was necessary because of very high rates of prescription of branded drugs. The stated aim was to reduce
spending from €4·37 billion in 2010 to €2·88 billion in 2012 (this target was met), and to €2 billion by 2014. However, there have been many unintended results and some medicines have become unobtainable because of
delays in reimbursement for pharmacies, which are building up unsustainable debts. Many patients must
now pay up front and wait for subsequent reimbursement by the insurance fund. Findings from a study in Achaia
province showed that 70% of respondents said they had insufficient income to purchase the drugs prescribed by
their doctors. Pharmaceutical companies have reduced supplies because of unpaid bills and low profits.

&gt; **Cost shifting to patients**

&gt; Despite the rhetoric of “maintaining universal access and improving the quality of care delivery” in Greece’s
bailout agreement, several policies shifted costs to patients, leading to reductions in health-care access. In 2011, user fees were increased from €3 to €5 for outpatient visits (with some exemptions for vulnerable groups), and co-payments for certain medicines have increased by 10% or more dependent on the disease. New fees for prescriptions (€1 per prescription) came into effect in 2014.An additional fee of €25 for inpatient admission was introduced in January 2014, but was rolled back within a week after mounting public and parliamentary pressure.
Additional hidden costs—eg, increases in the price of telephone calls to schedule appointments with doctors—
have also created barriers to access. 

&gt; Another concern is the erosion of health coverage. Social health-insurance coverage is linked to employment
status, with newly unemployed people aged 29–55 years covered for a maximum of 2 years. Rapidly increasing
unemployment since 2009 is increasing the number of uninsured people. Those without insurance are eligible
for some health coverage after means testing, but the criteria for means testing have not been updated to take
into account the new social reality. An estimated 800 000 potential benefi ciaries are left without unem-
ployment benefi ts and health coverage. To respond to unmet need, several social clinics (primary care practices
staffed by volunteer doctors) have sprung up in  urban centres. Médecins du Monde has scaled up operations in Greece, and reports increasing numbers of Greek citizens receiving health services and drugs from their clinics as
the economic crisis deepens; before the crisis, such services mostly targeted immigrant populations.

&gt; To examine whether these policies have affected access to health services, we analysed the most recent data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, a nationally representative survey.
Compared with 2007 (a pre-crisis benchmark), a significantly increased number of people reported unmet medical
need in 2011. Inability to obtain care increased most for older people. These changes mostly result from increases in respondents reporting an inability to afford care, or to reach services because of distance or scarcity of transportation. Difficulty in transportation overlaps with financial reasons, because hikes in the cost
of transport affect mobility, especially for the poorest people, and patients who might have afforded private
clinics before the crisis now need to travel to access publicly provided services.

---

&gt;The __Attack on Mers-el-Kébir__, part of __Operation Catapult__ and also known as the __Battle of Mers-el-Kébir__, was a British Navy bombardment of the French Navy at its base at [Mers-el-Kébir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mers-el-K%C3%A9bir) on the coast of what was then [French Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_rule_in_Algeria) on 3 July 1940. A [British naval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy) task force attacked the French fleet, after giving them a warning that they would do so. The French fleet was at anchor and had not been expecting an assault from the United Kingdom, up until that time. The attack resulted in the deaths of 1,297 French servicemen, the sinking of a battleship and the damaging of five other ships. France and the United Kingdom were not at war but France had signed an armistice with Germany, and the UK feared the French fleet would end up as a part of the [German Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriegsmarine), a fate that would greatly increase the Kriegsmarine's size and combat ability. Although French [Admiral François Darlan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Darlan) had assured [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill)  the fleet would not fall into German possession, the British acted upon the assumption that Darlan's promises were insufficient guarantees.

Yes. There's a difference between following an order out of fear for your life and following an order with gusto.

The difference being that the Nazis at the Nuremberg trials were not conscripted front-line soldiers.

&gt;And Wehrmacht soldiers also willingly killed thousands of Polish and Soviet civilians just because they could.

And I see no reason why those who did so unwillingly should be excluded from remembrance on their account.

&gt;Did you read that list you posted?

Of course. Did you? Or did you just count the number of words?

&gt;Did you read just how few crimes there actually were by the allied forces (Soviets not included)?

So the *quantity* of war crimes committed by military forces is the deciding factor of whether or not the soldiers who fought for them should be remembered? If so, then what is the threshold? Should American soldiers be excluded from remembrance since American forces committed the most war crimes of any non-Soviet Allied force?

&gt;Have you forgotten that on the one hand the allies were fighting to liberate Europe and on the other the Axis were fighting for territory and the ability to murder tens of millions of people?

Have you forgotten that we're talking about front line soldiers?

As /u/Seefor said, it's about encouraging investment. If your money is becoming more valuable on its own anyways, there's no real pressure to invest in anything, as that has more risk.

And as /u/Gingor said, if I have a loan, deflation makes that loan worth more effective money. The reverse happens with inflation, which is how some countries(eg. America) actually make money on their loans. If the interest rate on a loan is lower that your inflation, then that loan becomes worth less and less money over time.  

You can probably gather from that if your inflation is less than your interest rate, your loan becomes worth more over time. Deflation is just negative inflation, so your loan becomes worth more and more so you're paying more to deal with it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_plans_for_Germany#Reparations_and_exploitation
&gt;Contrary to common myth, the US did in fact take ""reparations""; parts of it by John Gimbel called ""plunder and exploitation"", directly from Germany. The US for instance took an 8.9% share of dismantled Western German industry.[27][not in citation given]
The Allies also confiscated large amounts of German intellectual property (patents and copyrights, but also trademarks).[28] Beginning immediately after the German surrender and continuing for the next two years the US pursued a vigorous program to harvest all technological and scientific know-how as well as all patents in Germany. John Gimbel comes to the conclusion, in his book ""Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany"", that **the ""intellectual reparations"" taken by the US (and the UK) amounted to close to $10 billion.**[29][30][31] The US competitors of German firms were encouraged by the occupation authorities to access all records and facilities.[32] In 1947 the director of the US Commerce Department's Office of Technical Services stated before congress: ""The fundamental justification of this activity is that we won the war and the Germans did not. If the Germans had won the war, they would be over here in Schenectady and Chicago and Detroit and Pittsburgh, doing the same things.""[32] A German report from May 1, 1949 stated that many entrepreneurs preferred not to do research under the current regulations (Allied Control Council Law No. 25) for fear of the research directly profiting their competitors. The law required detailed reporting to the Allies of all research results.[32]
The patents, drawings and physical equipment taken in Germany included such items (or drawings for) as electron microscopes, cosmetics, textile machinery, tape recorders, insecticides, a unique chocolate-wrapping machine, a continuous butter-making machine, a manure spreader, ice skate grinders, paper napkin machines, ""and other technologies - almost all of which were either new to American industry or 'far superior' to anything in use in the United States.""[33]
The British took commercial secrets too, by abducting German scientists and technicians, or simply by interning German businessmen if they refused to reveal trade secrets.[34]

Compare that with the $1.4 Billion in **loans** given under the Marshall Plan.  Germany had to use that money to buy US products and then pay it back.

true,wiking85,null,null,"First of all it was the 4-year plan.  It was autarkic due to Germany running out of foreign exchange to buy imports, so was a necessity rather than ideal, as it set back rearmament a lot by investing in industrial replacements for raw materials.  Production itself was very flexible, as it relied on skilled labor using general purpose machine tools in small firms; they created massive problems for mass production during the war, which is a major reason why Germany wasn't able to keep up with production against the US, Britain, or USSR who all used specialize machine tools with unskilled labor in production assembly lines, rather than batch work with highly technically skilled labor like Germany.

Germany had an economic niche in the 1920s-30s, which was being a high tech, flexible subcontractor for industrial goods (the joke being today that they make the thing that goes in the thing that goes in the thing, which still holds today; they were very specialized for civilian production before the Nazis came to power and then demanded American style mass manufacturing of weapons, which took until 1942 to complete the huge production facilities to achieve this, which, incidentally, marked the weapons output boom in Germany in WW2.  So in 1939 they had plenty of flexibility yet in the economy, but without military orders the stimulus effect would wear off and Germany would again be dependent on the world market to drive its industry; this is why Hitler was preparing for war to conquer the markets and make Germany independent from world economic downturns like the Great Depression, as without war Germany would be mired in economy malaise much like the US is today, but far worse, as they didn't have internal markets like the US did then to sustain them in bad times; they needed to import to survive economically, so needed to export to get money to buy things from abroad and that system had broken down after WW1 (and prior to to a degree), so Germany was left with massive structural unemployment as a result that couldn't be fixed due to the Great Depression.

Hitler's solution was war in Europe to conquer prosperity for Germany, rather than let Germany suffer under market economic trends.  That is why post war Germany did so well, because free trade became the order of the day and Germany got access to world markets it had been shut out of by the Imperial systems of France, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Japan.  The US also cut its tariffs, so now Germany could freely trade and have a vibrant economy instead of suffering during a downturn when everyone raised tariffs and left Germany with a massive trade deficit and unemployment.

There is a reason that Germany had the worst unemployment during the Great Depression, because it was so dependent on world trade to survive; now that we've taken that problem away, especially with the EU giving Germany a captive European economy to exploit, Germany doesn't even want a military, because it has all it could ever want in trade and armies are expensive (and only useful when others are hoarding the trade).",0,1402154462,null,0,false,0,ci1i2s2,t3_27j95b,t1_ci1i2s2,t1_ci1hqii,null,1434134136,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

Eigentlich egal was du nimmst, zB Grillen, Fitness, Brettspiele, Tee, Whisky, bla. Hauptsache du hast was zu sagen und bist einigermaßen authentisch.

Sei aktiv in der jeweiligen community, bring mindestens einmal die Woche ein youtubevideo raus und mach 1-2 Produktrezensionen mit Amazon affiliate.

Bei youtube kriegt man im Schnitt 5$/1000 views und im Amazon affiliate Programm ~ 10% des Kaufpreises von allen Produkten die der Kunde in einem bestimmten zeitlichen Rahmen kauft nachdem er von dir zu Amazon geschickt wurde.

Wenn du das ganze als deinen Job behandelst, wirst du letztlich ziemlich gut verdienen.

Falls dir das zu stressig ist, empfehle ich, ein paar standard reviews zu Dingen zu schreiben die Leute immer mal kaufen, von denen sie aber keine Ahnung haben. Zum Beispiel:

* Guter Schnaps
* Laufschuhe
* Uhren
* Zigarren

There is no such thing as a clean Wehrmacht, it doesn't matter if many of the soldiers were conscripted and didn't want to fight, many did want to fight and many joined up under their own free will. 

This is why we don't remember German soldiers, because they are responsible for the deaths of more than 30 million people, because they fought for a government whose goal was to kill even more, to wipe out any non-German civilian east of Moscow. 

The allies didn't murder 6 million Jews and 6 million other ""undesirables"", the allies were not responsible for the starvation of 20 million Soviet civilians, the allies didn't order their soldiers to shoot certain PoWs on sight.

Is it really such a stretch to ask us this question. As it isn't racist, it is a question that stands like a pink elephant in the room and needs to be addressed.

Finland has its own gypsies and the problems are the exact same. Even if they are given housing, food, education, free healthcare and all social benefits they still are over represented in crime. There's only 10 000 of them in Finland and they represent 20 % of all robberies committed in Finland (Source: The National Research Institute of Legal Policy, Rikollisuustilanne 2012). 

Romanian nationals made up 13 % of the Finnish prison population in 2011. In the same report it is explicitly stated that the big rise of Romanian nationals in Finnish prisons is linked to the rise of Romanian gypsies. Romanian nationals are the third largest group of non Finnish nationals in Finnish prisons. (Source: The National Research Institute of Legal Policy, Rikollisuustilanne 2012)

Now this is just Finland, and I am fairly confident in stating that the results are the same across Europe.

In the case of Finnish gypsies, the argument that they are neglected, and poor does not stand as they get the exact same social welfare benefits as any other Finn and they are still over represented in crime compared to the size of their population.

So for once can we stop pissing around the issue and honestly ask why is it that this particular group even with social benefits does not seem to be able to integrate. At what point do we discuss what the solution is and not just kick the rock further down the road pretending that it isn't an issue. Something needs to be done because not doing anything will lead no nothing good what so ever.

If you don't have anything constructive to say but to start yapping about racism and other nonsense please don't say it at all.

&gt;So in 1939 they had plenty of flexibility yet in the economy, but without military orders the stimulus effect would wear off and Germany would again be dependent on the world market to drive its industry; this is why Hitler was preparing for war to conquer the markets and make Germany independent from world economic downturns like the Great Depression, as without war Germany would be mired in economy malaise much like the US is today, but far worse, as they didn't have internal markets like the US did then to sustain them in bad times;

This statement makes it sound like Hitler was 'forced' into going to war for the good of the economy. This is false. Hitler's four year plan and the economic policy under him changed from the pre- and early Nazi era policies of Schacht, which, as early as 1936 put them on a path towards a war that Hitler deemed inevitable, though, of course it was totally evitable. 

&gt;So in 1939 they had plenty of flexibility yet in the economy

Really? You really think that? Unless they decided to overthrow the government, the German economy was extremely *inflexible*  in 1939, because of the vision of the Nazis. It had already been geared towards being a war time economy. 

This is from Evans' *The Third Reich in Power*

&gt;&gt;The Reich's finances, which had recorded a modest surplus in 1932, recorded a deficit of 76 million Reichsmarks in 1933, rising to nearly 9.5 billion in 1938. Acting now in his capacity as President of the Reichsbank, Schacht wrote a personal letter to Hitler on 7 January 1939, signed by all the other directors of the Reichsbank, in which he warned that 'overstretching public expenditure' was rapidly leading to the 'looming danger of inflation.' 'The limitless expansion of state expenditure', they told Hitler, 'is destroying every attempt to put the budget in order. Despite an enormous tightening of the screw of taxation, it is bringing the finances of the state to the edge of ruin and from this position it is wrecking the bank of issue and its currency.' Hitler's response was to sack [Schacht] along with the entire board of directors a few days later, on 20 January 1939. He no longer fitted into the general National Socialist scheme of things, Hitler told Schacht.

&gt;Unsurprisingly, what Schacht and his fellow directors ... had called the 'unrestrained spending habits of the public finances' continued unabated, at an even more frenetic temp than before. On 15 June 1939 a new law removed all limits on the printing of money, thus realizing Schacht's worst fears. But Hitler and Nazi leadership did not care. They were counting on the invasion and conquest of Eastern Europe to cover the costs. In February 1934 Hitler had stated that rearmament had to be complete by 1942. **By the time of the Four-Year Plan, the date had been moved forward to 1940. Germany's economic problems, as Hitler had always said, could only be definitively solved by war.**


If by flexibility, you mean facing the real inevitability of runaway inflation and long depression, than you're right. They had that option.

&gt;Hitler's solution was war in Europe to conquer prosperity for Germany, rather than let Germany suffer under market economic trends

No, this was Hitler's plan from the beginning.

&gt;That is why post war Germany did so well, because free trade became the order of the day and Germany got access to world markets it had been shut out of by the Imperial systems of France, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Japan.

This argument could be made, however, for any world economy. However you seem to draw a causal link between this and Germany's 'necessary war' that is weak at best.

And, from another of your comments:

&gt;Had only the old world order gave Germany the free trade it needed to prosper there would have been no need for two world wars and over 100 million combined deaths.

Again, problematic. You paint the Germans as the victim; they were decidedly NOT the victim, considering it was German imperialism in the first world war and political philosophy in the second that led to both, rather than 'economic pressures' as you imply. In the world you are describing, it would have made sense for every Great Power to go to war all the time to subordinate the others and create the NWO you speak of. However, I am unaware of any other countries starting expansionist wars in Europe over the same time period, or even countries that seriously considered the idea.

This is because of bleeding heart people like you, who instantly hijack the topic into a racism vs anti-racism rhetoric which is just verbal masturbation, but achieves nothing. But at the end of the day it's not about race at all.

The situation is that Eastern-Europe is plagued by a sub-culture(not a race) that doesn't fit with European values at all. It has a tendency for violence, poor hygienic standards, total lack of civilized behavior, a disregard for formal education, a despise for work, it thinks of crime and getting welfare as the sole things to do for a living, they completely ignore contraception, thus they pump out children at third-world rates, not to mention the STDs, and they mostly live with third-world conditions as well, sometimes even more than their poverty would force them to.

I say again, I'm talking about a sub-culture, not a race. I've seen non-gypsy people living this way and I've seen people with gypsy ancestry live and work like everybody else. Also, while the word gypsy is racially charged, it actually comprises of a number of different ethnicities. Some gypsies look like Indians, but I've also met people with gypsy ancestry who didn't stand out at all and I couldn't tell they were gypsies by their looks. The thing is, the main features that signal belonging to the above described sub-culture are not even racial features, but the results of the lifestyle associated with it. Heavy drinking and smoking and poor living conditions make a mark on you. Also, their clothing and makeup style is distinct(and in poor taste) as well.

Take this from someone who actually lives in Eastern-Europe and has seen the situation with his own eyes, and not filtered through numerous media outlets itching to report about racism because it grabs peoples' attention.

Yes, escaping this sub-culture once you are born into it is very hard, if not outright impossible. The mistake bleeding-heart leftists make is that they assume that only if we gave these people more welfare/more jobs/more opportunities, the problem would instantly solve itself, because the only thing that is keeping these people in poverty is oppression, and really, they would love to work so much, if only someone gave them a job.

Well, no. Because other than the despise of mainstream society towards them, their own culture is keeping them in poverty as well. If we really wanted to sort-out the situation, we would have to forcibly take all of the children born into these conditions, and raise them in government boarding schools, so they grow up not with the anti-social culture of their parents, but according to the values of the mainstream society.

Of course, even if any Eastern-European country had the money to do something like this, it would be the leftists who would advocate with the most force against it.

Not really. The pro-EU campaign hasn't kicked into gear yet at all (save for Clegg getting beat in some debates he called). The pro-EU campaign will arise once the referendum draws closer, i.e. in 2015/2016.

The anti-EU campaign has been in full flow for a couple of years because that's the sole confirmed policy and the centrepiece of UKIP. That's the reason they exist after all.

true,wiking85,null,null,"Hitler was looking to transcend the perenial German problem of trade.  AJP Taylor laid out the structural issues of the world economy in the 1930s in his works, but ignores Hitler's broader ideological motives as well.  Still, there were reasons for war that went beyond just Hitler's racial and megalomaniacal ones.  The inflexibility issue within the economy was political not physical in the form of industry being unable to change over to civilian/export work, just the regime wasn't interested in deviating from its goals; so if they chose to they could shift to a non-economy collapsing path if they so chose.  
I didn't say there wouldn't have been a slide right back into economic doldrums, I in fact laid that out in an answer previously (not sure if it was in my post you're commenting on), but outright collapse wasn't necessarily the issue.  

German imperialism was small compared to British and French imperialism, not to mention the trade issues surround tariffs by the US and several other countries leading up to the war (though not causing them in 1914).  In WW2 Germany was locked out of a lot of trade due to protectionism that rose after WW1 by France, Britain, the US, and the USSR.  Germany lost its largest export markets in Austria-Hungary and Russia, while being pillaged by the Allies for reparations.  Add in the tariffs keeping German exports limited, Germany was hurting pretty badly pre-Hitler.  Some changes happened during Hitler's reign from 1933-39, but as Paul Hehn points out in ""A Low Dishonest Decade"" there was a lot of shady stuff going on that locked Germany into 2nd tier economic status.

Hitler's war was certainly one of choice, but he got the military and much of the elite in Germany on his side due to these pressing economic concerns.  Even with the Treaty of Versailles gone, Germany was living on British loans, reneging on US loans, issuing bonds, and grabbing foreign exchange from Austria and Czechoslovakia to survive (plus looking the savings of Jews in Germany, Austria, and Bohemia).  Political philosophy of the Nazis was only part of the issue driving Germany to war in WW2, as they wouldn't have had the buy in by the military and industrial elites if Germany had better options to prosperity; Hitler achieved power due to the structural economic issues afflicting Germany in the 1930s that showed now signs of letting up and unemployment was only temporarily solved by spending Germany into bankruptcy; the ruling class in Germany realized serious economic problems would return the minute they stopped deficit spending on the military and they could only achieve partial employment with what exports they could sell.  

As to the Holocaust, yes of course it happened, it was awful, and Hitler and his buddies should all burn in hell for what they did to the Jews, Russians, Roma, Homosexuals, handicapped, Ukrainians, Poles, Belorussians, and many many others.  In fact depending on who you count in the Holocaust 13 million victims is the low estimate.  If you add in the Eastern European people killed as part of the war in the East/Hunger Plan, then we could be looking at over 20 million victims of genocidal policies.  

However that said Hitler's war of choice was only one motivating factor in getting Germany to go to war in 1939, otherwise he would have been removed from power by a broad coalition of power brokers, not just clandestinely opposed by some of the military hierarchy on moral grounds.

I do not mean these questions as an attack on your well thought out argument; however it may be beneficial to the both of us if we can drill down potential ideological differences at the beginning of our discussion, so each may approach the other in good faith.

You seem to have been doing a lot of research into Germany, pursuant to your posts on /r/scholar. Why is that?

I have also seen that you post to TheRedPill. While that does not disqualify you as a historian, TheRedPill takes a distinctly unexamined approach at trying to explain gender relations. Why do you post there?

You seem to be attaching counterfactuals to your arguments at every turn. For example: 

&gt;German imperialism was small compared to British and French imperialism, not to mention the trade issues surround tariffs by the US and several other countries leading up to the war (though not causing them in 1914). In WW2 Germany was locked out of a lot of trade due to protectionism that rose after WW1 by France, Britain, the US, and the USSR. Germany lost its largest export markets in Austria-Hungary and Russia, while being pillaged by the Allies for reparations. Add in the tariffs keeping German exports limited, Germany was hurting pretty badly pre-Hitler. Some changes happened during Hitler's reign from 1933-39, but as Paul Hehn points out in ""A Low Dishonest Decade"" there was a lot of shady stuff going on that locked Germany into 2nd tier economic status.

In this paragraph you seem to be implying that German imperialism was excused because other countries were also imperialist. You also imply that Germany had no option for peaceful rebuilding. This is a generally rejected hypotheses. You also imply that Nazi Germany was better than Weimar Germany, when in fact the quality of life of Germans went down during the Third Reich. This question is leading, but bear with me: Can you conceive of a world where Germany wouldn't have gone to war, with or without Hitler? Why or why not?

Finally, I will state my own biases: I am a democratic socialist. I think the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis holds no weight. I think that the German economy was wrecked by Hitler, and I do not believe that Germany had an unfixable economic state under the Weimar Republic. I think that Hitler was unquestionably a bad actor, and despite Germany's tremendous war-supporting industrial growth (like synthetic fuel, for example), there was no economic recovery in Germany, since the Nazi aim was to alleviate deficit through conquest and extermination of native populations.

- 2) The attentisme of the population. ( Thus, i really think in this case attentisme is close to collaboration. Not fighting the occupant is helping him. And it's not really put in the right light ) 

Well, all that to say, i think the coverture of the role of France in WW2 was ""Okay"" in my experience. ( Including fringe history like STO &amp; the Malgré nous )

I've never deleted any comment. But the mod has said that he did. Nor do I need to edit my opinions as they are firmly open.

&gt;But don't act surprised when you keep sprouting racist bullshit then people flag you as such.

Define racism then. I mean you rant about racism all the time and calling the above user stormfront. This is what you do all the time. It just shows that you lack basic skills to make a point without filler nonsense or name calling. It's as if you seek some form of validation in your insecure person.

Furthermore why do you change the subject to a previous discussion when there is now a question about your reaction to what /u/Gingor said. But to make it clear my opinion has always been that illegal immigrants should be locked up or sent back home. Even in one of my comments that the mods deleted I made it clear. For all I care they can be locked up until they leave. So once again it comes down to the person making an active choice, to be locked up or walk away free. How is that racism.

&gt; the common tacit european agreement was that as long as immigrant don't make waves, issues and become productive members of society we look the other way.

Now exactly what agreement is that? Either I've missed some legally binding agreement and seriously need to call my representatives and ask what the hell they were thinking. Illegal immigrants are illegal and nothing more to it.

&gt; they're **probably** not a ""free man"" where they come from. 

Assumptions and assumptions. They were free enough to travel long distances to get to Europe. Furthermore there are legal ways to ask for asylum which they decided not to follow. Ruining it for the ones that try to get to Europe by following the laws. What you are saying is that we should pat the ones breaking the rules on their back and say good job while telling the ones applying for asylum legally to go fuck themselves.

Your views are deluded and based on some unsustainable concept of a fair world that will never exist. The rest of your nonsense I don't even need to address as it is just your attempt grab onto anything that would validate your opinion.

&gt;It's stand on your post history around which sadly i can't really prove or quote here but you quite know about yourself enough since you apparently thought best to remove/hide.

Once again nothing to hide here. I've said that muslim immigration is the biggest threat to European values of equality between genders, freedom of opinion, freedom of speech etc. I've said that illegal immigration should be stopped. We should also stop organised crime from taking money from the poor and taking them on not seaworthy boats onto open seas. To deter them from trying to come by sea I've said that I support shooting at the boats. I've also said that the gypsy issue that has spread across western Europe needs to be addressed.

No tell me what exactly there is racist. There it is open for anyone to read. So please come again.

You keep on seeing racism everywhere and your attempts to justify this are ludicrous and sad. So please if you cannot say anything but the same old yapping about racism, xenophobia and ""stormfront"" don't say it at all because I do not care what you call me. I'd also dare to argue that non of the ones you call a racist care what you say. Instead you could try to have a debate discussing the actual issue but no, you just resort to the same old bull shit which leads nowhere. It makes everyone reading what you have to say more stupid for having done so.

&gt;That my be one of my big fault to some degree, true.

At least we can agree on something.

&gt;The fact that i might fuck up doesn't mean you aren't talking shit about immigrants constantly then acting like a ""surprised innocent"".

Define talking shit. Is it shit to want to discuss an issue just because you don't like that it is being discussed. No it isn't shit. It comes straight back to what you just admitted, that what you are saying are poorly concocted opinions based on feelings.

I'm done talking to you because talking to you is a waste of my and others time.

Oh yeah, the nice /u/gingor who just said landlords should throw pregnant women in the streets if they can't meet a rent rise the landlord just decided unliterally. Such a nice person. Read his or my recent post history if you feel like it.

&gt; Illegal immigrants are illegal and nothing more to it.

You use law as a tool for casual disguised racism, because you know the only ones who are not ""legal"" are the immigrant foreigners. So you use that to advocate what is really quiet partial ethnic cleansing, removing any foreigners you can point out and see, ""because i can because the law say so"". 

What really you have isn't against illegals like you say, it's against any foreigners because you think they are ""invading"" our continent and we can't deal with them and they destabilize/parasite us.

&gt;  They were free enough to travel long distances to get to Europe.

People on illegal boats or hiding in plain wheel compartments aren't ""free"". It's a ""do or your family die"" thing.

&gt; Furthermore there are legal ways to ask for asylum which they decided not to follow. 

Ahahhahaha. Really. Because we totally accept pakistanis in number legally. Facts are a bit against you on that one.

The only way they can be ""legally"" here is by having a family member on the continent illegally then have him make his familly come ""legally"" under family regrouping procedures. Which still mean somebody coming here illegaly.

&gt;  We should also stop organised crime from taking money from the poor and taking them on not seaworthy boats onto open seas.

That much i agree, but that's another issue.

&gt; To deter them from trying to come by sea I've said that I support shooting at the boats. 

Aka ""i'm not racism but i advocate executing ~~jews~~ foreigners on sight"".

&gt; I've also said that the gypsy issue that has spread across western Europe needs to be addressed.

replace it again by ""jews"" and you got, word for word, a goebbels sentance. I'm not saying that to attack you for once. No i mean, pleas think about it for a minute. That's how racism take root in our minds and how it did 70y ago. Just following D-Day remembrance, it feels plainly wrong to hear the same kind of logic once again. And worse, to see it accepted in plain day. :-/

You'll probably go ""But i never thought we should kill them"". 100% Agree, i know. The issue is that the average WWII german didn't even knew about camps nor thought it possible or agreedable either. It did not stop in the smallest way what happened.

The only difference here is that nobody around the EU has the kind of superpower level firepower (maybe bar russia) to resist us if we were to go full fascist. So, it's a bit of a responsability we have. Not to make the same mistakes again. To stir clear of those as much as possible.

So, please, think about it for a minute. Labelizing entire population based on their ethnicities and advocating harsh treatment of them ""because they're a danger/issue for our society"".

&gt;  I'd also dare to argue that non of the ones you call a racist care what you say. 

If i were still angry i'd say something along the line of ""maybe you'll care the day more racists will get arrested"" but then, i wouldn't be any better than the people i decry. Just think a minute about it t'is all i ask.

&gt; Define talking shit.

You said ""To deter them from trying to come by sea I've said that I support shooting at the boats"". I'm sorry , but having saw actual fighting (as external from it), that does seems a bit harsh in my eyes. I can get shooting back at people who are armed and shooting at you. But *gunning down civilians like cattle because they're foreigners*, that fall entirely within the ""totally batshit insane"" to me, sorry. 

You have no fuckin idea what you are talking about when you talk about killing hundreds or thousands of people at the borders just so you can keep foreigners out of your sight in ""your country"". That's just plainly horrible and disappointing, especially coming from another educated european citizen. I thought we ought to know better.

Edit : Oh and if you have any actual idea what it means and keep maintaining we should shoot foreigners on sight, that means you either saw, approved or do approve killing large numbers of people for an illusion of protecting your lifestyle.

I'm sorry, but while it may be factually correct that Stalin was the wartime leader of the USSR, the Russians won the war on the Eastern Front more *in spite* than *because* of him. The Russians were surprised by the German attack because of Stalin's obstinacy, had a abysmal morale and were practically without a military leadership because of Stalin's purges. The moment when they turned the tide was when Stalin finally accepted to stop micromanaging the war, halt--temporarily at least--the political commissars, and let the generals (Zhukov, Konev, Timoshenko, and others) do their job.

The history of German and the World Wars is critical to understanding the world as it is today in all ways, not just internationally, but even domestic politics, gender relations, racial relations, sociology, philosophy, economics, literally everything; Germany having been the origin of so much of the modern social and physical sciences, along with the concept of the modern university system has been a deeply interesting place for me to study, especially given the horrors of the Nazi period being such a profound break from its tradition of intellectual development and relative peacefulness compared to its neighbors (until the period from 1860-1945 that is).  

You have have serious concerns about someone showing interest in Germany, why?  Personally I think there is too much phobia concerning Germany and too much propaganda from the war years has crept into modern historiography concerning Germany, from how much support the Nazi party actually had in Germany to the origins of WW1.  Sure, Germany has a very ugly history during this period and during Imperialism (Southwest Africa for instance has serious overlap with the Nazi era that we now know due to modern scholarship on the subject), but the context has been lost due to the fact that Germany did not operate in a vacuum as far as atrocities in Europe and the colonies went or for that matter how militaries operate.  Much of modern scholarship throws Germany under the figurative bus to cover up the atrocities of the Allies in WW1 and WW2, plus during the Cold War and even now with how the US military operates.  There are horribly disturbing parallels with how the US army operated in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan with the German behavior in the East in WW2, same with how the German army tried to influence the German public to be more warlike prior to WW1 and 2 with how the Pentagon works with video game companies and Hollywood to create a pro-military culture with the resulting products.

Studying Germany and the historiography around it in the late 19th and early 20th century is seriously eye opening in terms of understanding how the world works and the hypocrisy around the telling of history.

Now to the rest of your points about German Imperialism...Germany was late to the game and following the brutal scripts of the other European powers that committed great crimes in colonizing the world prior to Germany even existing and after Germany ceased to exist in 1945; Britain in Kenya in the 1950s is every bit as bad as German crimes during WW2, with dishonorable mention for the Dutch in Indonesia, France in Algeria and Vietnam, and the US all over Latin American and the Phillipines (plus Vietnam, Indonesia, parts of Africa and Iran, and of course Iraq and Afghanistan).  German Imperialism and its crimes are not excused, but were no worse and indeed in general less bad than that of the other Imperialists of the time.  Germany got its bad reputation in WW1 based on British propaganda which was largely refuted post-war, but shame being earned for generations during WW2.  

As to Weimar vs. Nazi Germany, in terms of employment numbers Nazi Germany was a better place to live for the average person in regards to being able to work and feed your family than in Weimar in 1932, but that's a low bar.  Weimar of 1928 was far better than Nazi Germany at any time in its horrible history.  Germany was on the track for war with or without Hitler by 1932, as von Schleicher was trying to place himself as the shadow dictator of Germany and openly talking about couping the government with the army (a hollow threat in the end), as was von Papen and Hugenburg, while Hindenburg was trending far right by 1932.  Weimar Germany was already rearming and planning for war with Poland down the road, Hitler just inherited the groundwork and reoriented it; ironically Germany was trying to unite with Austria already in 1931 but the banking crisis of that year dropped the plan and ultimately caused the Austrian civil war and rise of Austro-Fascism in 1934.  

I think a world without WW2 was potentially possible, but unlikely; had the Western power acted prior to the german banking crisis of 1931 to hold the Lausanne conference then, then we probably would have avoided the Nazis, but not German rearmament and a showdown over Poland and the Corridor/Danzig.  

I too am a Social Democrat, though such a thing is more an ideology than reality here in the US; I am general far left where I am.  Hitler was IMHO a reflection of the elite's id and achieved power due to their own incompetence and arrogance, but also by playing to their desires; I don't think he reflected the will of the average German at all and in fact don't think the German people deserve blame for him, rather German conservatives do.  He was a bad actor, but was the respresentative of an ugly strain of the German elite.  I do think that the world economy was structured against Germany due to the inherent flaws of the way Imperialism and Capitalism was structured at that time and Hitler represented a way for Germany to topple that structure and create a new exploitive Imperialism in Europe; I think it would have been horrific had it succeeded, but it came about for a reason, which was that the German elite realized that the existing world economy was unacceptable for Germany and Hitler was their chosen strong man to alter it; they chose very badly and something like 10 million German died during and after WW2 horribly for that choice, not nearly enough of the elite that actually made the choices and committed the crimes.  Of course that doesn't mean the 10s of million of victims of German, Japanese, and Italian (or Soviet, French, British, or US) crimes should be forgotten either.",0,1402164372,null,0,false,0,ci1lkg6,t3_27j95b,t1_ci1lkg6,t1_ci1kmfo,null,1434135884,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Nominativ: Wer oder was?

Genitiv: Wessen?

Dativ: Wem oder was?

Akkusativ: Wen oder was?


Dativ would be the question ""whose?"", Akkusativ ""whom?"".
e.g.: 
The dog got hit by the man. Von wem? The man, Dativ.

The man hits his dog. Wen? His dog, Akkusativ. 

A dumb sentence, I know. I just realized how hard it is for non-native speakers, I couldn't help me otherwise than writing the questions in german, excuse me.

Back to your question:
Akkusativ: Wen? e.g. ihn, sie. Du schlägst ihn/sie. You hit him/her/them.

Dativ: Wem? e.g. ihm, ihr, ihnen. Du glaubst ihm/ihr/ihnen. You believe him/her/them.

It's really helpful to ask the question to each part of a sentence.

du | dich | dir | deiner
er | ihn | ihm | seiner
sie | sie | ihr | ihrer
es | es | ihm | seiner
wir | uns | uns | unser
ihr | euch | euch | eurer
sie | sie | ihnen | ihrer

You will rarely ever use the Genitive, as it's only used with certain rare prepositions and verbs.

As for the others: With each preposition and verb, you'll have to learn whether they take an accusative and/or dative object. There are some rules of thumb, however:

Rule of thumb for verbs: Accusative is for an object directly affected, like ""You're reading a post"" or ""I like reddit"". Dative is for something indirectly affected or benefitted, such as ""They obey me"". You may have both with the same verb: ""She gave me (Dat) some food (Acc)"".

Rule of thumb for prepositions: Accusative for movement, such as ""into"", dative for position, such as ""inside"".

Note that there are **a lot** of exceptions. Really, whenever you learn a word, learn what case it takes. It may help to remember specific phrases.

Edit: For the sake of completeness, have two more pronouns:

Getting enough fish to survive means having a boat, which if they had means they probably wouldn't be stealing in the first place.

&gt;

&gt;The __Chinese Dream__ ([simplified Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters): 中国梦; [traditional Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters): 中國夢; [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin): *Zhōngguó mèng*) is a new term within [Chinese socialist thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_with_Chinese_characteristics) and describes a set of ideals in the [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China).  It is used by journalists, government officials, and activists to describe the role of the individual in Chinese society. 

&gt;In 2013 the [Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China) (CPC) [General Secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China) [Xi Jinping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping) began promoting the phrase as a slogan, leading to its widespread use in the Chinese media.  Xi has described the dream as ""national rejuvenation, improvement of people’s livelihoods, prosperity, construction of a better society and military strengthening.""  He has stated that young people should ""dare to dream, work assiduously to fulfill the dreams and contribute to the revitalization of the nation.""  According to the party's theoretical journal *[Qiushi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiushi)*, the Chinese Dream is about Chinese prosperity, collective effort, socialism and national glory. 

&gt;Some believe that, although the phrase has been used previously by many Western journalists and Chinese activists,   a translation of a *[New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times)* article written by the American journalist [Thomas Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Friedman), ""China Needs Its Own Dream"", has been credited with popularizing the concept in China.  He attributes the term to Peggy Liu and the environmental NGO [JUCCCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JUCCCE)'s China Dream project,   which defines the Chinese Dream as [sustainable development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development).

It's one thing attacking a country, killing it's men and raping it women. It's another thing to have your country attacked and destroyed and *then* doing the same thing to the nation who attacked you. Both are wrong, but not equally wrong.

And I know what you're gonna say: ""But those German people were innocent"". Yeah, they were but it's human psychology to get some kind of revenge.

true,durandaI,UNSA,Occasional lawful permanent resident,"&gt;You have have serious concerns about someone showing interest in Germany, why?

To answer this, it's a couple things. Now, the problem here for me is to try to present my argument in a way that doesn't seem like an attack. At this point I have little doubt that you've read more on the German Empire, the interwar period, and the Third Reich.

I think that you are trying to build a historical world view around Germany as central player and it's actions as the central actions, which is why I asked about your interest in Germany and the wars. In this very post, you conflate German actions with cold war and modern actions by the U.S. and others, which is very strange to me, since they hold few parallels. You also hold the opinion that modern scholarship has been unkind to Germany. I would argue that the opposite is the truth: Today, the actions of the Central and Allied powers are seen mostly as an extension of historical Great Power policy to a more modern military complex, and the result of bad actors on all sides. You would have a case regarding Nazi Germany, if and only if scholars equated Nazism with German peoples. If you can find me one instance where a respected historian claims that Nazis were Nazis because it's intrinsic to Germanness, I'll eat a hat of my choice. 

You make the case that every country was like Germany in your fourth paragraph, and that is just intellectually dishonest. Nazi Germany was not like all other imperialist countries. All other imperialist countries did not subscribe to the Nazi concept of Liebestraum, nor did you see other western powers engage in genocide against racial groups.

Finally, a small point:

&gt;As to Weimar vs. Nazi Germany, in terms of employment numbers Nazi Germany was a better place to live for the average person in regards to being able to work and feed your family than in Weimar in 1932, but that's a low bar. 

Indeed. If unemployment is the only measure of quality of life. However, in most other metrics, under the Nazis' rule, quality of life went down as the economy shifted to military industry. If you can find someone who argues the contrary, I'd be happy to see it.

But, again, I want to reiterate my point from above, and add a question, and then I leave you. Though I like discussing this stuff (or I wouldn't have left you my other comments) I find it exhausting to talk at length when I feel the other party has a closed viewpoint.

So, the point I want to reiterate: I think that you are trying to build a historical world view around Germany as central player and it's actions as **the** central actions.

And here's my addendum: You're obviously very educated on Germany since World War I. This education has led you to try and draw certain conclusions, seemingly on your own, about what the effects of that history  is on the modern world. This, however, is a common trap to fall into. When you focus on one area of study, you begin to see the effects of that area of study everywhere around you, and it is possible and often probable that in seeing those effects you will allow them to unconsciously reinforce what were before just hypotheses, until they become theories, until they become your world view. What I'll ask of you now is this: Given your extensive study of Nazi Germany, and the way it has helped form your view of the world as it is today, is it not possible that, indeed, history wasn't and isn't hanging on the actions of Germany, but is in fact an almost infinitely complex system with enough actors on the stage that fixing majority responsibility is usually hard if not impossible, much like how your area of study, Nazi Germany, is fantastically complex? Basically, I'm saying that your evident zeal and wide knowledge of one country and time period have contaminated your ability to be able to form other hypotheses, and to challenge your own beliefs in a meaningful way. Indeed, if you have in fact figured out history, I'm sure there'd be a lot of people who'd pay a lot of money for your system. However, I'm sure you see the absurdity there, and can in turn recognize some of the absurdities of your German-centric world view.

true,zeroark,liguria,null,"Farò la voce contro: non potete rendervi conto (a meno che non ci siano altri insiders) di quanto la Rai sia in realtà ben strutturata nell'impianto tecnologico e produttivo. 

La Rai manda in onda quello che la gente vuole vedere. Esattamente come altre piattaforme. 

Sul sito in sé ci sono due considerazioni da fare:
1) Silverlight è un gran dito al culo per gli utenti non windows, ma la sua logica di streaming è ottima. E per quanto limitato sulle integrazioni ""open"", si è poi trovato di fronte un ecosistema ampio e facilmente raggiungibile (pc, Win phone, Xbox)
2) Nel periodo in cui è nato quel sito, ci mancava poco che la Microsoft non cominciasse a pagare qualcuno in contanti purché si usasse Silverlight. Consulenze, licenze, supporto dati via per quasi niente. 

Ed in aria di sciopero aggiungerei: è vero, ci sono molto ""privilegiati"" a lavorare in Rai. Ma la cosa buffa è come (tolto gli stipendi stellari di chi va in video) viene percepito questo ""privilegio"": semplicemente vengono rispettati i contratti di lavoro fino all'ultima lettera. 
Se Sky invece che macinare ragazzi interinali avesse lo stesso approccio, spenderebbe gli stessi soldi.

http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2013-08/fleisch-konsum-ressourcen

Die anderen Punkte (Pflanzenschutz, Biodiversität) sind ja Probleme, die durch Fleischproduktion *auch* entstehen, und denen man gezielt begegnen kann. Tatsache ist, dass Fleischkonsum einen viel grösseren ökologischen Fußabdruck hinterlässt denn vegetarische Ernährung.

edit: Klar, man kann nun sagen, Wasser ist in einem Kreislauf und kommt irgendwann wieder zurück. Das ist auch nicht falsch. Das Wasser ist aber erstmal verdreckt und nicht mehr für den Verzehr geeignet. Das muss gefiltert werden. Wenn es durch den Boden läuft, häufen sich dort Schadstoffe an, die in dem Ausmass nicht mehr kompensiert werden können.

Rinder werden leider nicht mehr nur mit Heu oder Gras gefüttert. Sehr sehr oft kommt Soja dazu, oder (schlecht fürs Tier weil Magen nicht für gemacht) Mais, der auch erstmal angebaut werden muss und deutlich mehr Menschen ernähren könnte pro Anbaufläche. Für Weidehaltung in Südamerika wird Regenwald gerodet u.s.w. (jo, für Pflanzenanbau auch, ich weiss). Ökologisch gesehen spricht (fast?) alles gegen Fleischverzehr. Und selbst wenn man die Tiere nur noch ""ökologisch korrekt"" halten würde, also auf reinen Weideflächen, mit Heu füttert und gut hält, dann wäre das Fleisch so teuer, dass sich das kaum einer noch leisten können wollen würde.
