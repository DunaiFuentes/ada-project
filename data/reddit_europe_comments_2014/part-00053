true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"I have a lot of issues with the whole article but I felt qualified to illustrate this particular issue. On the video it indicates a chart showing voter turnout it in European elections dropping further and further as time goes on, but I thought I should point out that this is the trend in most European countries, [particularly the UK](http://www.ukpolitical.info/Turnout45.htm). I mean, in the UK for over a decade voter turnout has hovered between 59% and 65%. Is that enough for democratic legitimacy? Are we really a 'demos' if we can only garner 65% of the population to actually turn up? This is without getting into the problem that, out of the meagre 65% of the population which does turn out, you only need approximately 40% of that to form a government because of the awful way FPTP works (no UK government has had a majority of the votes which were cast since c.1945).

Somehow I don't think the guy writing the article or speaking in the video would make the same arguments he is making about the EU to the UK government. [UK turnout was 34% in the last European election](http://www.ukpolitical.info/european-parliament-election-turnout.htm) and and 43% Europe wide. 

Personally I think low voter turnout and apparent voter apathy is not a symptom of a lack of a common 'demos' but is in fact an indication of large scale public contentment. It's certainly not satisfaction, but if you look at it in world terms we're extremely near the top in terms of quality of life and many other factors. The nature of the problems which we face are increasingly complicated and require more attention as time moves on (as standards improve), so it's not really an indicator of the public becoming less interested, but an indicator of people being so content that they won't put in more work themselves to really understand the problem.

I worked for a European Company in northern France. The company was doing Software Engineering.

All employees were from the European Economical Area, most of them didn't speak French. Even though, it was in France and 30% of the employees (myself included) were French citizens, we were speaking in English everyday.

Of course this was only within the IT department. The accounting/marketing department was only speaking French.

As far as my experience goes, in software engineering, you *might manage* to get a job only speaking English. I other areas, even very technical areas where people think we lack manpower, I don't think it's possible.

Anyway, the problem in France is not the lack of manpower, it's the lack of cheap manpower. After living in the US and seeing 6 figures salaries in Software Engineering, I'm pissed of when people give me offers at 30k€ gross salary. Or, a carpenter in the US would be making around 40k, in France this would be insane. People blame it on tax, I don't think so, we just don't have this culture of reward.

Not to communism itself, but to Soviet Union. One of the things people demand is lustration, including the ban of communist party and limiting access of former or active communists to power. Opposition politicians promised to do this, but knowing that former communists are present even in the most right-wing parties, I'm not sure if they're going to implement it in the way people want.

&gt; The way I see it, it's more about sovereingty and anger towards the corrupt government than anything else.

Yes.

&gt; On the top it of, Lenin was far from being the worst possible leader and (?) generally represents the benign side of communism.

&gt; I don't understand that reaction. 

Lenin destroyed Ukrainian independence of 1917. Lenin hugely damaged Ukrainian culture.

Here's some news: The Commission isn't a government and doesn't have any sovereign people to back it up. That's exactly why nothing in the EU can happen without the approval of the member states and it doesn't.

It is a remarkable story, that most of Denmark’s Jews survived the war. But the fact there were only about 7.500 Jews in the country, most living around Copenhagen also made it a bit more of a manageable situation, and it makes it pretty hard to compare it to other countries' reaction to the final solution. As already mentioned in this thread, it is quite offensive to single out the Danes as specifically good people and in the process belittling the sacrifice of so many others during the war.

Another interesting fact about Denmark during the war: The place where most Danes died in combat was on the Eastern front fighting for the Nazis. This on the other hand doesn't mean that the Danes were worse people than others during the war.

&gt;Angered by what he saw as sedition by the Catalans and Valencians and taking his native France as a model of a centralized state, Philip V suppressed the institutions, privileges, and the ancient charters (Spanish: fueros, Catalan: furs) of almost all the areas that were formerly part of the Crown of Aragon (Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands). The decrees ruled that all the territories in the Crown of Aragon except the Aran Valley were to be ruled by the laws of Castile (""the most praiseworthy in all the Universe"" according to the 1707 decree), embedding these regions in a new, and nearly uniformly administered, centralized Spain.
 
&gt;The decrees effectively created a Spanish citizenship or nationality, that judicially did not distinguish between Castillian and Aragonese anymore, both with respect to rights and law. They abolished internal borders and customs except for the Basque territory, giving grant to all Spaniards to trade with American colonies (not only Castillians, as before).

&gt;Top civil servants were appointed directly from Madrid, the king's court city, and most institutions in these territories were abolished. Court cases could only be presented and argued in Castilian, which became the sole language of government, displacing Latin, Catalan and other Spanish languages.

Polls indicate that people feel the EU has too much power already and that additionally are angling for more powers: A United States of Europe.

The UK signed an agreement to join the Single Market via a referendum in 1975, since then we're now 40 years later up to a United States of Europe with no vote ever. It's more than likely it's the same or similar across Europe?

The will of the people is supposed to be translated into democratic actions such as voting on these issues: Each major party has promised in their election manifesto to provide a referendum and then not followed up when in government.

These are 2 major reasons why people call for a referendum.

The UK could if the public voted repeal the 1973 Communties Act in a single day and trigger Article 50 TEU of the Lisbon Treaty and be out of the EU in a day (in theory) and start renegotiation via the above according to EU's law.

This is why there has been no referendum: Not because of your wild goose chase suggesting all Treaties requiring referendums, but because the above on the EU Treaties has changed SIGNIFICANTLY on from the initial contract of the people with the government for 40 years and the government investing political capital into the EU and they don't dare allow the people to bring their political determination to bear to cancel all those stages. No Parliament can be held by legislation of any former Parliament in the UK but all Parliaments must represent the democratic will of the people and if it is large enough for long enough it must be represented.

What do you mean?  My reasoning is that you should not complain that you didn't get to vote in a referendum if you weren't alive yet.  I don't understand what you mean by the above claim. 

If your population wants to leave the EU they'll vote to do so in the coming years, right?  First there was a vote in 1975, then your democratically elected representatives made decisions to further integrate the UK into European institutions (and they managed to get special opt-outs from arguably the most important areas; Schengen, EMU, Fundamental Human Rights).  Even then you're getting a chance to undo what they've done.  Do you not recognize the democratic legitimacy of your own government's decisions and just want to inject a bit of direct democracy when it fits your specific interests?

     None :   4 -&gt; 7 

Even in only 5 years you can see a trend of belief in God going down, and atheists growing very significantly. Note how in both cases the number of atheists pretty much doubled.

The only reason Germany is in the position it is today is because the US prevented the entirety of the country become a Russian client state. Even now Eastern Germany have significantly lower lifespans, education, income and happiness than their western counterparts. That is of course after the Western half expended huge resources to get it to where it is now. If the entire country had been under Russian control the German economy would look much more similar to Eastern Europe than to the West. That is a huge drop in living standards.

But as far as Germany undermining the US for Russia and China, I do need to point out that the Germans are extremely afraid of the Russians. There are missiles based in Kaliningrad that are very close to Germany, there is also something called the ""North European Plain"" which is an extension of the Eurasian Steppe that runs from Russia all the way through to Northern Germany (and arguably all the way through the Netherlands, Belgium and Northern France). The North European Plain does not have any major natural geographical barriers, so historically it was very very easy for invading armies to rush through the plain in a matter of no time. This has resulted in a very very very very long history of fast and total invasions through this plain. Going all the way back to pre-roman times. Napoleon used it, Hitler used it, Stalin used it, Attila the Hun used it, Charlemagne used it, so on and so forth. Now, in the modern age this may not matter as much, but the history behind it has left a very profound imprint on German culture and the German worldview.

Also, you may think the Germans are being too friendly with the Russians, but I assure you this is just so they can get close enough to put a dagger in their heart. (and by their heart; I mean the heart of their corrupt regime)

true,gamberro,IREL,Éire,"Firstly, the Commission has a threshold for surpluses of 6 percent of GDP over three years, which the Netherlands appears to be in breach of (or at least is likely to be once it is updated for last year). At present this threshold doesn't distinguish between smaller and larger economies of the Eurozone, which would perhaps give the different economies of the Eurozone some leeway.

Secondly, as it is a big exporting power sharing a currency with diverse economies, when Germany exports outside the Eurozone (such as to the emerging markets you mention), it benefits from a significantly undervalued currency. This is an added advantage to Germany's already strong manufacturing industry and its ability to curb real wages. But now that the peripheral countries are focusing on exports (both Ireland and Spain now have small surpluses), the euro is likely to appreciate and thereby [squeeze the less competitive countries all over again.](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b3faf9b0-2489-11e3-8905-00144feab7de.html#axzz2mzvSEPiN) 

It would be unfair to single out Germany for this, as the same could be said for the other Eurozone countries that have surpluses in excess of six percent. If any of these countries still had their own currencies, they would appreciate in the face of such strong exports.

Thirdly, I don't think critics of Germany's surplus want to reduce exports from the Eurozone, but rather that exports come from across the Eurozone as a whole. [The argument made by the Belgian economist De Grauwe](http://www.social-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/ebook.pdf) is that reduced surpluses in the core countries would stimulate aggregate demand across the Eurozone as a whole and also make it easier for these countries to export to emerging markets. But I really do think that these countries are entitled to export as much as they like once they import enough to fall within the thresholds established by the Commission. As Barroso said last year:

What /u/jh1980 sayes are some good tips and I will also try to give some.

1)  For PC Building/Components there are some specific stores like: [Atelco](http://www.atelco.de/pcconfwelcome.jsp;jsessionid=A3804987B77C52223B4FB95BD8AA293B.www1) 

2) You can buy your Phone and your mobile plan by many companies separatly. If you do this you have to pay the Phoneprice at once but that`s is cheaper as a mobile plan/contract. 

Telekom (not T-Mobile anymore (all one Company (blablabla shit))) have the best Network because they were a ngo earlier, it`s called the D-Netz and say in the advertising: Mit D-Netz Qualität (With D-Net(work) quality), but Telekom are a big asshole, slowly Company (i know it, we keep their buildings repaired) and is really expensive if you want Internet for it. (in the small print of the part you can read stand that you have ca. 500mb before they reduce your Speed).

But, they are not all Idiot and have a sistar Company called Congstar and [here are their nice packages they have](http://www.congstar.de/surf-flat-tarife/). You have HSDPA Speed (7,2Mbit/s)(You don`t need LTE it is fast but you have it not everywhere and the speed of 50 Mbit / s who say they will never reach you), you can terminate your contract every month, can call everyone for 9c/min and that all in D-Netz quality.

Also from all stores by my home in Bonn it was the cheapest (Brand new Galaxy S3 without contract for 1 1/2 years ca. 20-70€ price difference).

Not your Question, but it is also important to read at which company to order his Internet connection. All telecommunications companys have to do with Telekom because they have the infrastructure. Personally I prefer cabel companys like Unitymedia, Kabeldeutschland and Netcologne. They have their own network and infrastructure so you don`t have to deal with two companys if you have problems.

In addition, you should as soon as possible after moving to Germany for a cheaper electricity supplier. By default, you will be supplied by Stadtwerke, but they are relatively expensive. In Germany exist many Internet Plattforms to find a new Supplier but they will paid by many Companys and the cheapest one`s are all fake. Before you select a provider, google reviews  about the Company.

if you have signed in you, he will take care of everything else (re-registration etc.)

Si l'hémicycle est un demi-cercle et que celui-ci est un unigone, alors cela pourrait résoudre les problèmes d'égalité puisque un unigone n'ayant qu'un seul côté, tout le monde est logé à la même enseigne au sein d'un unigone. Mais en réalité, le demi-unigone est plus que l'égalité puisqu'un demi-unigone serait l'égalité x 2. Mais qu'est-ce donc que *l'égalité x 2* ? Est-ce l'égalité partagée entre deux êtres ? Est-ce l'égalité mais en plus extrémiste ? L'extrémisme peut-il être profitable à l'égalité ? Que de questions...  
Je pense qu'il faut remarquer que si l'égalité est un but, le demi-unigone n'est certainement pas une solution acceptable, l'égalité ne devrait pas être multipliée à la va vite, il faut y réfléchir longuement avec l'aide des membres de la Cadémie Rançaise pour arriver à un compromis acceptable entre tous les membres de l'égalité.  
En ce qui concerne l'infinigone, serait-il l'opposé de l'égalité ? Pourrait-il être utilisé avec le demi-unigone pour créer l'égalité ? Car tout le monde sait que (2.égalité + 0.égalité)/2 = égalité parfaite. Mais cela impliquerait qu'un infinigone est la non-égalité finie, car si c'est une non-égalité infinie alors c'est impossible d'obtenir grâce à elle l'égalité parfaite. L'infinigone serait-il une création inglinoise pour semer la discorde dans nos rangs ?  
Pour en revenir à la question de base, je pense qu'on peut clairement dire que si un cercle est un unigone, alors il est aussi un infinigone ce qui en fait donc l'objet de tous les possibles égalitaires mais qu'il pourrait également très bien être utilisé pour créer un déséquilibre durable dans la devise Rançaise *iberté, galité, raternité*. Cela serait clairement un outrage à notre grande patrie et cela pourrait bien causer la fuite des élites de la Cadémie Rançaise.    

Je pense donc qu'il est nécessaire de dire que le cercle est une création inglinoise mais qu'il n'existe pas pour autant et que l'hémicycle est une demi-construction rectiligne et surtout uniligne, favorisant ainsi l'égalité entre ses membres tout en conservant les traditions rançaises qui nous rendent fiers d'être les membres de la plus belle nation de l'univers connu.

I don't believe anybody suggested you fire 200,000 people a day. I understand that you want to defend the honor of your country, yet we must remain objective.

That there have been more reforms in the last 2 years than in the previous 40 years proves first of all only one thing: that there haven't been enough reforms before.

If I said only 50% of the reforms agreed to were not acted on, that does also mean that the other 50% have been started, even though there is a difference between putting something into law and actually practicing it. Thus anecdotal data of reforms don't prove me wrong.

The problem really is that Greek leaders didn't decide reforms before problems occurred. In Germany, the public debate led to reforms of the pension system about 20 years before the problem will most likely occur. In Greece, which suffers from excessive public debts, the pension system still wasn't reformed years into the crisis.

Europe, the Troika, can only propose reforms, if they are not implemented in Greece they will have no effect. Moreover, it should have been the responsibility of Greek leaders to decide reforms without being told to do so from abroad. It is therefore totally unacceptable to blame Europe for the state of the Greek economy.

Without Europe, Greece would go the Argentine way. But since Greece is part of the EZone we have no choice but to keep on providing cash in the full knowledge that we won't see much of it ever again. 

The Ukrainians don't have that privilege.

Let's go to back to basics, shall we? A nation is a nation when its members decide they're a nation. Let's say you and me are from Murcia, we agree we share certain commonalities and we're different from the people in Albacete. Are we a nation? Of course not. Why? Because we lack the ideological construct that solidifies a national identity (common mythology, language, religion, etc, etc) and our consciousness of being part of it. (And for the record, Jews are an ethnic group, not a nation, same thing with gypsies).

This ideological construct came with the romanticism and we call it nation. Regardless of whether that nation has a state or not, mind you. Before that, people were from Scotland (and Catalonia!) in the same way we're from Murcia: we agree than we've more in common with each other than with other people, but that alone doesn't merit any special sense of unity or a common destiny.

Catalonia, today, is a nation as real as the Spanish nation, the Scottish nation or any other nation in the world. But to talk about nations before the very concept was created is an anacronism, there was no such thing as a Castilian nation or an Aragonese nation. That's new. The idea that these common cultural traits we share are worthwhile and deserve recognition is only a few centuries old. Back then we were all from Murcia. (And if a Redditor from Murcia happens to read this, please don't take it the wrong way!)

And as I mentioned in my last comment, people DID fall in love before romanticism, of course, but love by itself didn't matter. You married another person not because you loved them but because you'd have more cows and goats that way and you needed kids to work the farms. You think only nobles had arranged marriages? Those were the norm even amongst the peasentry. Of course bards sung about love, love is pretty much a human emotion, but the IDEA that love conquers all and love is reason enough for marriage... is another recent romantic construct.

Ever wondered why so many people in the right are against gay marriage? Because even though 200 years have passed, deep down many still see marriage as a social duty. As per tradition.

This signifies a clear shift from the market economy to the planned economy. I don't want to launch into a polemic about Comecon, but the point is that (leaving aside all speculations about merits or demerits) this can't work in a global market economy.

You can't force a country to consume more. In the face of finite natural resources and an environmental crisis that will hit us in the next few years, such a demand would be immoral to the highest degree. Moreover, it doesn't make economic sense. The problem is not that the EZone isn't consuming enough, the problem is that it isn't producing enough. 

The crisis states are loosing jobs to emerging countries like China not to Germany. They have failed to create new employment in the high tech field to compensate for losses in low-wage sectors that have become nonviable due to increasing living standards (and not due to the high value of the Euro). Germany as been phasing out low-wage industries for the last 40 years. The failure of the periphery is due to a lack of innovation (and resistance to reforms). Everything else is window dressing.

true,frenchyshadow,null,null,"&gt; I don't know where you got that 80k€ figure for Germany, but I am not sure you can ""easily get it"". Do you have a source for that?

No I don't have any source. Actually, what I said on Germany might be biased. This is based on one application I made once to a banking company in Frankfurt. And I don't have a regular background in software engineering (by regular I mean PHP/Java) which is valuable, and they knew a US company made me an offer, so they might have boosted the salary as well. I ended up turning off their offer because the job by the american company was more challenging in my opinion. (And more R&amp;D focused)

However, for the Brussel thing, 50k€ is really the salary everybody is talking about. (plus a lot of other benefits, like company car, and so on)

But anyway, [according to what I'm reading it's 44k€](http://www.payscale.com/research/DE/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary). Compared to the 35 k€ I was offered in France, this proves my point. The tax argument that tries to justify low wages in France is BS, it's mostly the non-rewarding culture we have in France that causes low salaries.

Our engineering schools generate thousands of extremely qualified engineers every year, but most of them flee abroad. So we drain brains from Africa, because what we want is cheap workers.

1) There is not a huge reward culture - massive salaries would be seen as excessive, like you say. 

BUT the biggest is by far... 

2) Social Charges are HUGE. The difference between what an employer pays you (NOT your salaire brut, but the salaire brut + charges patronales) and what hits your bank account (and which you then pay taxes on) is about 45% !! You have 22% taken out for your 'cotisations sociales' (social contributions) but your employer also pays around 23% on top of your gross salary directly to the government as charges patronales (or 'employer charges'). So basically you are only actually getting just over half of what your employer is paying you. 

This means that labour is SUPER expensive for businesses and so where a salary in the US might be 100k (70k EUR) in France even if they paid you the same, you would only ever see around 35-40k of that amount. And then you would have to pay income tax on top of that. 

The upside ? Those charges pay for a generous retirement package (no french person ever has to think about planning for retirement if they dont want to), excellent health coverage, free education, lots of social benefits for everyone (especially for working families with children), a relatively good social saftey net should you find yourself in difficulty and INSANE unemployment insurance (up to 2 years at 60-70% of your previous salary) if you loose your job.

I would base myself around [""le chemin des grands crus""](http://www.cotedor-tourisme.com/bourgogne/pied/chemin-des-grands-crus_rap0210001_fiche.html) (path of the best wines, roughly translated). If you are without a car your options will be severely limited, I'm afraid. You can tour some big wineries that have museum-like self-guided (but often pricey) tours in Beaune, Dijon, etc.

To get a more fulfilling experience you should get a car (or a bike, if you are trained) and get out to the smaller wineries/resellers. Check out the area around Cote de Nuits: stunning area and, if you avoid the more touristy resellers, a real bargain.

There are loads of camping options in the area, although I can't recommend any in particular (I stayed at AirBNB places). Food costs can vary wildly but Burgandy is not particularly expensive compared to the rest of the country. Be sure to eat lots of Jambon persillé (a ham and parsley paté, available everywhere) and escargots (famous in the region). 

Speaking French is a major asset, although the more established (but, from my experience, overpriced) wineries will have salespeople who speak english. Don't be shy with the tastings but try not to waste anyone's time.

READ THE LITERATURE you find about wine in hostels, hotels, etc. as soon as you arrive. The more you know about wine the more you taste and distinguish.

true,thebrainitaches,null,null,"&gt; I don't speak a word of French. 

Won't be a 'problem' for basics, in that most simple transactions you will be able to speak English, but certainly a lot of French people expect you to at least be able to converse in French if you expect to live here – not learning the language would be perceived as laziness / american-centro-ism and might hurt you finding friends / getting along at work.

Certainly if you expect to have to interact with the government for anything (health insurance, taxes, etc) lots of stuff can only be done in person and you will have to be able to speak French (your partner might find herself taking care of a lot!!). 

Certainly enrolling in an intensive French course before or shortly after arriving would be a HUGE help in getting a bit integrated.  I'd wager your poor experiences with language learning were due to insufficient hours and poor teaching. Immersion really is the only way. The ""I am just not made for language studies"" argument doesn't really fly as an excuse in Europe, where most people can passably communicate in a second language (and countries like the Netherlands are 70%+ trilingual !!). An intensive course (in France ideally) would be a great way, you'd be immersed, and I bet the results would surprise you :). It's never too late to give it a shot. If you are serious about wanting to live in France long-term (getting married for example to move!) you really need to seriously consider putting some serious work into the language. 

All the other points are secondary really – work is very hard to come by if you speak no french at all. Even doing things like langauge teaching, where you will be working in English, all the administration etc. will be in French and you will still be expected to be able to make yourself understood in French.

In terms of visa, you basically can't get a work visa in France unless you are married to someone who has the legal right to work in France, or you have an EU passport. There are rare cases of exceptions to this but they are obscure and I don't know the details. Get some advice from your French consulate in the USA (New York, Chicago, Texas, LA... there are a few others...) and/or an immigration lawyer. But my gut feeling says you will need to be married before you go, and you will have to complete a whole bunch of paperwork prior to leaving. The timescales can be long (up to 10 - 12 months?) so get informed in time. 

With a technical background, a work visa, and a mediocre level of French you will be pretty well placed to find some kind of job in your field.

I'm not trying to discourage you but I want you to be realistic – if you are serious about trying to get a job in France it is a big commitment, and will require a lot of time and effort. I have lived here for 4 years and I love it, and I've seen some americans who tried to rock up and make it work, but it doesn't work out in General. 

If you are more thinking 'my partner is going to France for a year and I would love to come along for the ride' then save up some money and go for 3 months, treating it as a vacation, cos working in any meaningful way is going to be WAY too much work in terms of red tape. 

Your last option : think about studying. You can enroll at a French university for around €500 (including foreign students) for any undergrad or masters course, which gives you the right to stay in France for 12 months, and work up to 15hrs per week. The downside - some administrative hoops to jump through on the US side (you have to go through an annoying organisation called Campus France - check out their site), you have to prove that you have sufficient ressources to support yourself during your studies, and you (in theory) have to go to all your classes (although attendance checks are few and far between).

We've had enough, your government is threatening our rights (in terms of education, culture, economy...) and while we way have *some* cessions from Madrid (the few we have -compare them to Scotland if you'd like-) they are getting denied with the many laws that nowadays come from Madrid that ignore our competences (the LOMCE, for example)... that's not adding our economical spolitation (that thing that some use to claim that ""Espanya ens roba"" or ""Spain robs us"", with some truth backing it) for example. 

So we come to a conclusion: Our country demands to vote for its freedom. **We** will vote, whatever Madrid says or does, we *don't* care.

Now we come closer to the point. 

Are the rules stupid? I'd yes. But all countries signed them, mighty Sweden included. So they have to be followed. 

Should they look at the whole of the EEC as a market and not look at market dominance in only one particular area? ...I don't know, because I am not an expert when in comes to geo-economic things. I am sure each EU member has such experts, consulted them before they signed the treaty, and there is a good reason why the rules are like they are.

Before the [Programma 101](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programma_101) computers were as big as trucks and used only by men in white coats, [Programma 101](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programma_101) was the size of a typewriter and accessible to all. [NASA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) bought at least 10 Programma 101 and used them for the calculations for the 1969 [Apollo 11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11) Moon landing. The [ABC Television](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Television) used the [Programma 101](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programma_101) to predict the presidential election of 1969, the U.S. military to plan their operations in the [Vietnam War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War) . The [Programma 101](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programma_101) was also used in schools, hospitals, government offices etc. etc. In 1968 due to the similarities of the machines, Hewlett-Packard was ordered to pay about $900,000 in royalties to [Olivetti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivetti) after copying some of the solutions adopted in the [Programma 101](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programma_101), like the magnetic card, the architecture and other components too similar, the [Hewlett-Packard 9100A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard_9100A).

I'm actually moving there March 6th, but the only reason I'm able to do so is because my father did his research and became an Italian citizen through ancestry and as a result, I now qualify for citizenship. I have to warn you, though, this process is not easy. 
If you do not have citizenship, the easiest way to live in the country would be through a student visa. If you're not currently attending an accredited university, however, you're second best option would be to find a job that has a branch in Italy so you could apply for a work visa. It should be mentioned that due to a staggeringly high unemployment rate, you have to prove that you have skills that are vital and that cannot be found amongst the Italian population. This is obviously, quite difficult. Work visas are very hard to come by because giving an immigrant a job means taking one from an Italian. 
Another option, and probably the best one in your case is to get an extended stay visa. In order to do this, you're going to be jumping through a lot of hoops (my citizenship is still processing, so I'm currently smack dab in the middle of this process). You will have to apply to your regional Italian consulate, and since there are only ten in the US, this will probably require travel. In addition to this you're going to have to do things to verify your current citizenship and prove that if you do move over there, you can be independently self-sufficient. In other words, you have to have your own money and cannot get a job over there. 
At one point there was a visa you could apply for that would allow you to reunite with family members abroad, but my Italian consulate informed me last week that this was no longer an option. Bummer. 
Anyway, long story short, Italy doesn't want you. I know it's not what you wanted to hear, but it's all I can tell you. Even if you do qualify for any of the visas I mentioned above, it's going to be a long and tedious bureaucratic battle before you can get there. The most helpful resources I've found are actually blogs of expats who have gone through the process themselves.  I wish you all the luck in the world!

Honestly, I don't give a fuck about what happens in the Parliament as long as the economy is booming.

&gt; Isn't that, with all due respect, all the more worrying?

My opinion is that people can do amazing things when they aren't disturbed.

&gt; then there is all the more reason to believe that a shift in power will mean absolutely nothing.

Yanukovich's government created problems for private busnisses: government higher-ups were corrupt and cared only about enriching themselves. They took bribes, sometimes just seized businesses. There was no way to protect against them since they all were together.

Private businesses is the only way to generate wealth, which is required for higher quality of life.

Ugh, do you think that countries like Romania and Poland are in a bad position? Why can't Ukraine be like Poland?

&gt;  This would be less of a problem if your parties had independent profiles and different socio-economic goals

All major parties have reasonable socio-economic goals, but it's hard to achieve these goals when businesses are being terrorized. ""Stealing"" from the budget doesn't help either.

&gt; There are no 'real' Working people's parties and hence no one to represent the interests of the vast majority of middle and lower class Ukranians.

The average salary have gone up from $42/month in 2000 to $360/month in 2008, that's 8x growth.

Old age pensions went from $13/month in 2000 to $150/month in 2008, 11x growth.

It's a common misconception - just think back to the complaints about Brown's government not being elected in 2007.

&gt;I mean it's deeply unpopular and people don't know the faces in the EU at all.

How many people in the UK know the faces of the government and opposition? I bet most people could only really name 6 or 7 of them. Cameron, Clegg, Milliband, Gove, Cable, Balls and perhaps Pickles. I wonder how many could even name their constituency MP.

&gt;I want more democracy and that means taking powers back from the EU and back from Westminster back locally per constituency.

I'm all for having power at the correct level, but sometimes power needs to move up rather than down. There are some issues that are best solved at European level and the EU should have the competencies to deal with these. I'm talking about trade, the environment, consumer protection (at *least* when it's transnational), amongst other things.

Some may say that even if those issues are dealt with at European/international level there's no need for the EU and it's bureaucracy but I strongly disagree with that stance.

It's better to have permanent structures and institutions in place rather than continually set up and tear down ad-hoc negotiations. Not just for logistical reasons but because it allows for proper democratic involvement.

We elect MEPs to serve our interests in the EU; to hold the Commission to account, to write legislation (well, usually amend legislation but there's nothing [other than the Council] to stop them completely re-writing a Commission proposal).

He therefore opposes the direction of travel.

If you mean that as a nationalist he believes central political administrations should reflect a group and territory that is identifiable as a nation - I do not think he denies this. He refers to it directly throughout the video.

Finally your complaint about his seeking to impose his views on others while claiming to be defending other people's is strange.

Your reddit post history does not constitute valid source material. Whatmore, the points you do make - that the Ukranian economy grew in 04-08 - is of little consequence if that wealth was not evenly distributed among the population but instead, as is the case of most neoliberal countries, ended up in the pockets of a few bankers, financial speculators and industrialists. 

In other words, you or the vast majority of Ukranians do not benefit one bit from however much money a billionaire in your country makes. It does not improve your life. 

&gt; Private businesses is the only way to generate wealth, which is required for higher quality of life

This is simply not true. I won't attempt to make this an ideological debate, you're entitled to your opinions but don't think that only private companies can make money. Nationalized companies make money just as easily. The only difference is that its easier to impose moral obligations - such as evenly distributing wealth, or investing in local infrastructure - on nationalized companies.

&gt; All parties do everything possible to support lower class Ukrainians, but that requires budget, and budget requires powerful economy. And that's where execution matters.

Thats great. Since you're Ukranian i choose to believe you know what you're talking about. Lets hope this ""revolution"" works out in favour of the average Ukranian.",0,1393164102,null,0,false,0,cfmj4it,t3_1yor3x,t1_cfmj4it,t1_cfmiwa9,null,1432521980,-3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-3

&gt;No, they were always contributors.

Of course they were, they were one of two countries around which EU was built (arguably if Europe would have no France, no Germany... no Russia, EU would be never born - as ""piece project"" argument would not apply)

You might want to look at the definition of ""sick man of Europe"" : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_man_of_Europe

I did not use it derisively, but rather as an example of simplification and generalization: Germany was called ""a sick man of Europe"" while it was contributing while paying reunification associated costs

&gt;&gt; For instance it would be unreasonable to expect Poland and Lithuania to contribute as much to EU as ""older"" Europe with comparable populations, they are still catching up.

&gt; And Greece has been in the EU since 1981, Ireland 1973, Spain/Portugal 1986. They have had time to catch up. What is the reason there?

Ah, if I would know the answer on this one :(

But if general, do you really think that you might apply the same set of reasons on any country of Europe? We can go from many possible explanations: the one that Stratfor seems to favor: there bunch of rivers in the north of Europe, it is easier to transport goods -&gt; higher capital accumulation rate -&gt; more prosperity; we can go with Protestants (and their descendants) work ethics, or less-politically correct one - ""lazy, cheating Southeners"" ... etc.

Let's take a look at your neighbor - Finland. It was part of Russian Empire, went through Winter War with USSR, using euro (you are opposed to euro, so I can count as a handicap, right?), but this country caught up with the most prosperous European nations.... so witnessing examples that you mentioned above... should we assign Poland and Lithuania to the hopeless group or to successful group? 
I am quite sure that in Sweden, not all regions are net contributors to the budget, but how many Swedes would like to kick them out of country? Even if there is no direct, immediate, financial reason to keep a territory, countries almost always prefer to do so.

&gt;&gt; So fortunes change.

&gt; People also make their own fortunes.

So are you saying that there is binary choice: sponsor forever weaker regions vs. let the strongest survive?

true,zedvaint,null,null,"&gt;Your argument relies completely on the false premise that it isn't possible to use a smart phone in a secure manner that protects one's privacy. Threema also runs on Android, which has several open-source implementations, such as CyanogenMod, readily available.

I don't see how that is a weak premise. Android is in large parts closed source and so is the parallel running phone OS. The system in itself is insecure, so it is rather weird how you suggests you could run a secure system on top of that. There is a reason Richard Stallmann has been advising against using phones/smartphones for years, and it is not because he doesn't like candy crush. 

Your suggestion of cyanogenmod fixes some of that, but then again even IF you run that you'll still want several Google services and - bang - you got your closed source back into the system. You and me might be ok with this, but to expect the general populace to do that is a bit naive. This isn't about some neck beard project, it is about a messenger so simple even my parents could install it. And your answer to that is: ""at first please install a Custom ROM on your phone""?! Pleeeease. 

That's my key argument you ignored: Yes there are solutions out there that are safe AND open source AND somewhat well designed.

If Spain and Portugal have a slight surplus now, it is simply because domestic demand for imported goods is down and not because they have become more competitive. They have priced themselves out off the market and are unwilling to do the necessary internal adjustments. 

To conclude from the fact that these countries have started internal devaluation doesn't mean that other countries should artificially increase internal demand. In the economy, the failure of company A cannot be compensated by causing a successful company B to also fail. But that is what you are effectively demanding. Anyways, for German trade the EZone periphery is insignificant with less than 10%. 

You keep on dodging the facts and my arguments: 1) Germany's trade is almost balanced with the EZone. 2) Germany's trade surplus with the rest of the World is an asset to the EZone. Without Germany, the EZone would just collapse. 3) The failure of the crisis states is due to lack of innovation, financial speculation (Ireland) and inefficient or corrupt administration. That cannot be remedied by handicapping the only successful economy. That needs to be treated at the roots of the problem.

true,PsyX99,Bretagne,Bretagne,"Those are 2 ways of spending public money. In France we are socialist and we based our country and economy in order to have easy access to public services. 
In the USA, there is a few taxes to pay for police/army/administration (and a huge protectionism of the agriculture, a big paradox isn't it ?). Nothing more. So yes, you can get richer faster. But if you are from a poor family your children will be as poor as you because you can't afford education. And if you get sick you will be able to get poorer (or die without being cured). In France we try (it doesn't work that well but that's another problem... ) to get the poorer richer : l'ascenceur social (social elevator). It worked for me at least... 

But I thing France has a too big administration, and maybe too much taxes. Everytime we try to increase the public money the price of life in increasing. It's not a perfect model...

Our big issue right now is that we are living in a capitalist and globalized world.. People can earn more money abroad, and all the ""brains"" are going to UK/Canada/... I think our system is making us lose the economic war we are at, because the other country have sacrifices the poorest to be more efficient.
And as a student in Biology, I don't want to do my PhD and I don't want to work in France because the salary in the public sector are very low. So I'll probably try to move in the UK to do that (and work in the UK public research).

No country is perfect. And I thing it can be hard for a US citizen to work in France because you'll not have a lot of money and France will not give you anything. The opposite is better : you'll have more money and French retirement/school/health systems.

That's not how it works. Generally, there are two kinds of loans:

1. Loan to central bank: It is used strictly to strengthen the local currency, it's used for open market operations.
2. Loan to government: Local government sells the bonds and uses money according to the budget. Money can't get to the wrong places, unless those wrong places are in the budget. Foreign governments/banks can help by reducing interest rates.

No, this isn't ""proof"" of lower physical boundaries at all. This is only your PERSONAL interpretation. For the French it is much less intimate to do la bise because your bodies do not touch save for your cheeks. Every French person I've asked about hugging before have told me about how uncomfortable it is because it DOES involve ""the chest, the shoulder and so on"". They're not used to this, and full body contact and being held by another person isn't something they're comfortable with letting a mere acquaintance.

&gt;  is of little consequence if that wealth was not evenly distributed among the population 

The fact that average salary (and pensions!) grew faster than GDP means that it was distributed more evenly than before. We are talking about growth from $45/month to $360 month, 800% growth that is. That's a difference between barely surviving and having relatively decent quality of life.

Another way to check this: price of a decent one-bedroom apparentment went from $12000 around 2000 to $60000 around 2010, that is, 5x growth. Who do you think buys one-bedroom appartments, billionaires or middle class?

It is very sad for me that red-black flag, which is symbol of fighting for freedom for us, Ukrainian nationalists, is a symbol of Volhynia Massacre for Poles...

Also, it is very sad for me that Poles blame on Bandera personally things that he even hypothetically could not do. Volhynia Massacre happened when he was already imprisoned by Nazis. Also, Poles act like they are white-winged saints and Ukrainian nationalists are black-winged demons, while in fact AK slaughtered Ukrainian civilians too, Volhynia Massacre was not only in one direction.

&gt; Many of those people are still alive. Maybe it would all be all history if not people like Andrij Tarasenko, who openly say that south-east Poland should belong do Ukraine. 

I completely agree with your point, but Polish press hugely changed what Tarasenko actually said. His claims were nowhere as radical, insane and aggressive as Polish press wanted to show. It would be better if he said nothing or at least avoided painful topics that are dangerous to bring up, like Ukrainian ethnic territories or Volhynia Massacre, but... he is the person of action, not the person of word.

true,quantum-confinement,MOLD,Moldova,"The Romanian and Moldovan press reacted rather negatively to the abrogation of the law, painting it as contrary to the interests of the Romanian linguistic minority in Ukraine. However, in my view that is both lazy journalism and unfair to Ukraine's lawmakers as it ignores the context in which the original law was passed. The original law was passed largely to curry favor with Yanukovich's Russian speaking power base and was meant to come as close to fulfilling Yanukovich's goal of effectively making Russian a second official language as was possible under the circumstances. 

More generally, I can certainly understand Ukraine's desire to protect the status of its national language. One simply can't ignore the historical context of the official and semi-official Russification imposed upon Ukraine's population over the course of the past two centuries when drafting language policy at both the national and regional levels. Almost all ex-Soviet states enacted policies protecting the role of the national language, otherwise Russian could easily have continued to dominate due to inertia as it continues to do in Belarus. 

I am a bit reluctant to spell this out, since as a matter of principle I categorically support the more liberal approach to regional policy common in the European Union, including a large degree of linguistic autonomy at the local level. However, what works for an established liberal democracy like Sweden may not be the optimal immediate solution for more vulnerable states like say Ukraine or Moldova. Indeed, an indiscriminate implementation of such policies in these latter states may have the opposite effect of that intended, e.g. producing an increase in ethnic tensions rather than greater stability.",0,1393172730,null,0,1393173087,0,cfmlqbl,t3_1ypauv,t1_cfmlqbl,t1_cfmjih4,null,1432523275,36,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,36

Actually I guessed you were American. The binary focus on wealth distribution (or wealth creation) is such an American thing, where most Europeans seem to strike a more balanced stance (I'm personally maybe 60% wealth creation and 40% wealth distribution).

&gt; I'm danish. I live in a functional social democratic Nation in which a vast majority view it the same way. 

I'm Finnish. We got it all pretty much working too, yet there haven't been a lot of great experiences with fully government run things besides the true natural monopolies. We're again in a position where the government has gotten way too big and needs to be scaled down because ultimately it does not create anything new.

&gt; Governments, as entities consisting of people making decisions, are no more prone to corruption than a Corporation.

Almost 100% correct, but not quite. I'd excuse founder run companies from this group as being slightly less corrupt. There's no difference between a huge corporation (say, GE) with faceless shareholders and a huge corporation with faceless voters though, you are absolutely correct about that.

&gt; The former, however, is easiler held accountable than the latter.

Is it, really? Depends on the situation. In a natural monopoly, the government one is easiest to hold accountable as both are insanely tough to hold accountable and the government one is marginally easier.

However, in any service provision environment, a government operation is FAR less accountable than a private one. Not that the private ones are accountable so much as they are susceptible to customer ill will. I have seen government operations survive being universally reviled.

(Then again, I live in the US now, and the worst of both worlds - the private monopoly - gives private corporations like TWC and Comcast the possibility to also survive despite being universally reviled)

&gt; I'm not - as you seem to think - arguing for a planned economy. I'm just trying to dispel the misunderstanding that only a privately owned company can generate a profit.

Yes, but you're making your case to a person (Ukrainian OP) that has dealt with FAR worse governments than we have which have shown little to no responsiveness to the citizenry... and of course true corruption requires the government bringing in (accidentally) friend/family owned private businesses to suck on the teat that gives on giving.

Under such circumstances, a weak government is obviously far preferred to a strong government.

true,Bowgentle,IREL,Ireland/EU,"&gt;I think your description holds some truth but it doesn't stop Hannan's video being a strong and consistent argument - just one you disagree with.

I largely did say that, though.

&gt;The polling he cites suggests EU citizens believe this even as the European Parliament gains more power. He therefore opposes the direction of travel.

Actually, polling doesn't really suggest that, neither the likelihood of eurosceptic parties gaining seats in the elections, nor the often-cited ""decline"" in turnouts for euro elections. The first is hardly surprising in a recession, and can be taken as being a protest against the political establishment which is reflected in national votes as well. It doesn't generally get taken to mean national governments are illegitimate, yet that's what's claimed for exactly the same phenomenon at the European level.

The ""decline"" in euro election turnout is more of a statistical artifact than anything else. Turnout in the EU-15 countries has been stable for the last three elections at about 52-53%. The apparent drop comes from adding in the accession countries, which in their first elections had turnouts of 39% on average, but then had turnouts almost the same in 2009. 

&gt;If you mean that as a nationalist he believes central political administrations should reflect a group and territory that is identifiable as a nation - I do not think he denies this. He refers to it directly throughout the video. Finally your complaint about his seeking to impose his views on others while claiming to be defending other people's is strange. This is the whole purpose of politics- however it's usually known as policy formation and campaigning. It's then up to electorates to pick which views they think should be imposed. I think it works rather well generally.

I don't have any objection to Hannan *being* a nationalist, or believing that ""central political administrations should reflect a group and territory that is identifiable as a nation"". I only made the point that he claims to be defending democracy and that he represents a majority view, when neither of these things are particularly true of his position as opposed to any other political position.

Essential for the conclusions that I draw is the view that any individual or company is a potential blackmailer, applying pressure through knowledge of information about me (that I might perhaps not want everyone else to know) to their benefit, at my expense. What this practically means is e.g. that I have to self-censor myself with regards to the personal information I reveal when using Facebook (I only post what I'd also be willing to announce on television).

It's also the relative accumulation of information in one place that makes a difference. Using different services for different purposes, one might leave different bits of information in different places. Facebook and WhatsApp were of course ""dubious"" to begin with, absence-of-data-protection-wise, and everyone had to know that.

Equally if a country exports less the value of its currency falls so its produce appears cheaper to other countries (exporting increases!). Without Germany the Eurozone would be an incredibly cheap currency therefor helping the poorer countries keep their head above water, sadly Germany is keeping the currency abnormally high for the majority of member states meaning their economic situations are harder to escape from.

Wenn z.B. das Material, welches Edathy sich von dem kanadischen Händler kaufte, nackte Posing-Fotos und Videos gewesen wären, so wäre er vermutlich schon längst verurteilt worden. Also bitte nicht einfach den Rahmen der Diskussion verrücken. Das ist unehrlich und tut so als wäre ich dafür, pädophile Menschen KiPo sehen zu lassen.

&gt;Selbst wenn es aber so waere, dass kein Zusammenhang zwischen Besitz/Anschauen dieser Bilder und Kindesmissbrauch besteht

Finde ich interessant. Das schreibst du nachdem du einen Link zu einer Referenz bei Wikipedia setzt, die eine gewisse Korrelation beschreibt. Warum, weil es die für dein Argument falsche ist?

Erwachsenenpornografie hat ja auch nie zu befürchteten Explosionen von sexueller Gewalt geführt, im Gegenteil, wenn sie relativ einfach erhältlich ist scheinen die Zahlen zu sinken (kann man auch Aufklärungskampagnen zuschreiben, daher ""scheinen""). Wieso man bei KiPo (oder sogar simplen Nacktfotos) also automatisch vom Gegenteil ausgeht ist mir schleierhaft.

&gt;Was aber diese Diskussion meiner Meinung nach in jedem Fall hinfaellig macht, ist das Persoenlichkeitsrecht der Kinder. Dies wird nicht nur durch die Produktion, sondern auch durch Tausch und Besitz von diesen Nacktbildern beeintraechtigt. Das alleine ist fuer mich trotz aller Liberalitaet ein schlagendes Argument dafuer, dass man hier nicht legalisierend taetig wird.

Und wenn ich jetzt ein Nacktfoto von mir selber als Kind verkaufe, wem schadet das dann? 

Wenn man zuhause Bilder von verwandten Kindern hat in denen diese nackt zu sehen sind, soll es ja bekanntlich in Ordnung sein. Okay. Selbst wenn ein Kind irgendwie geschädigt würde, wenn jemand sich beim Anblick seines stinknormalen Badewannenfotos selbst befriedigt und das Kind nie davon erfährt, so finde ich diese zweierlei Maß von Fremden vs Familie/Freunde recht zynisch wenn man bedenkt, dass die meisten Missbrauchsfälle im nahen Umfeld passieren.

&gt;Aber diesen Schund mit Methadon gleichsetzen zu wollen, halte ich fuer zu gewagt.

Und wer hat das gleichgesetzt? 

Etwas als Schund zu bezeichnen ist übrigens kein Anzeichen für eine rationale Diskussionsgrundlage. Vor allem wenn es lediglich um Nacktfotos geht. Wird das Bild eines Kindes zu ""Schund"" wenn jemand es erotisch findet? Es gibt ja auch Ideen, Fotos von bekleideten Kindern illegal zu machen, wenn sie 'sexualisiert' wirken.

I am **NOT** suggesting that Europeans are superior, only that a combination of geography, history and cultural dynamics set Europe on a path that created the European Enlightenment and thus the concept of a modern liberal/social democracy that is rooted in the rule of law.

The European liberal democracy and its very close twin the European social democracy (liberal democracies can turn into social democracies with a single election, and vice versa) are both *by far* the most effective, fair and ethical forms of government that humanity has discovered so far.

###EU warns west must be ready to rescue Ukraine

*By Christian Oliver in Brussels, and Jamie Smyth in Sydney*
 
The EU’s top economic official has warned that the west must be ready to rescue Ukraine from bankruptcy, filling the gap if the Kremlin drops its financial support for Kiev.

“It will have to be measured in billions rather than hundreds of millions,” Olli Rehn, the EU’s economic commissioner, said on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Sydney on Sunday. “We will have to work with the International Monetary Fund.”

Kiev’s finances will come under intense pressure if Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, responds to the fall of his Ukrainian counterpart, Viktor Yanukovich, by ending a $15bn bailout facility for Kiev. Russia could also revoke a 30 per cent cut in gas prices for the country of 46m people.
Russia’s support is already evaporating. Moscow bought $3bn of Ukrainian sovereign bonds at the end of December but the next step of its bailout – the purchase of a further $2bn of eurobonds – is on ice, after the auction was cancelled last week.

Ukraine must redeem a $1bn eurobond in early June. The government has also guaranteed a $1.6bn eurobond issued by Naftogaz in September. About $12bn of Ukraine’s $73bn of external and domestic debt falls due this year.

At the end of December, the EU said that the international community would have been ready to lend Ukraine at least €20bn if Kiev had signed up to a landmark trade deal with the 28-member bloc.

That trade deal was spurned by Mr Yanukovich but it is still open to Ukraine, along with the emergency loans, according to diplomats in Brussels.

The diplomats said that the majority of the funds would come through the IMF but there was disagreement between different EU institutions as well as with the IMF about what conditions to impose on Ukraine.

Timing could prove vital. Ukraine’s foreign reserves slumped to $17.8bn – about two months of imports – at the end of January from an already low $20.4bn at the end of 2013, according to Fitch, the credit rating agency. On Thursday, the Ukrainian currency hit a five-year low of 9.085 against the dollar, but recovered a little on Friday to 8.83.

Chris Weafer, senior partner at Macro-Advisory in Moscow, a business consultancy, said bondholders were unlikely to recover all their investment.

“If the rescue deal is abandoned and Ukraine has to take a deal from the EU and IMF then a debt restructuring and some write-off is inevitable,” he said.",0,1393181072,null,0,false,0,cfmp5vr,t3_1ypytn,t1_cfmp5vr,t3_1ypytn,null,1432524891,18,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,18

&gt; And since you will not show any such evidences since they do not exist my argument still stands that southern&amp;eastern countries are receiving more money then what they are contributing except Italy at the cost of the Western&amp;Northern countries.

Spain and Portugal (and Iceland) are the most westerly countries in Europe, yet look at their economies. Ireland is a country that is both a northern and western European nation and it required a troika bailout just like Greece which is at the opposite end of the continent.

For the last point [this report](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_the_European_Union#Net_contributors_and_recipients) was the best I could find although it is out of date (2009) I can't seem to find a more recent report from a reputable source where EU revenue is broken down by country.

From a quick glance in 2009:

1. ""Western"" Belgium  received twice as much as ""Eastern"" Bulgaria.

2. Lithuania (""Northern"" as stated above) received €200 million less than ""Southern"" Romania (which is in roughly the same latitude as Slovenia, Croatia and Hungary)

3. Cyprus the most Southern EU nation and yet it is a net contributor.

&gt;Since most UK govt. users are already saving documents in OpenXML, and since Since both LibreOffice and OpenOffice have the ability to read/write to OpenXML (although OpenOffice currently has write functionality disabled) it would make sense to allow its use.

&gt;There certainly are arguments against OpenXML, but this article gives a very warped view of Microsoft's handling of events in the UK regarding it's use by the government.

**Merkel calls for Britain to remain at heart of Europe**

By Stefan Wagstyl

German chancellor Angela Merkel will urge Britain to ignore the eurosceptics and stay at the heart of the EU in a speech to both houses of Parliament on Thursday.

But during her one-day working visit to Britain, she is unlikely to make significant concessions to prime minister David Cameron on his key concerns, including immigration curbs and changes to EU treaties to return powers from Brussels.


“Germany and the UK are, for each other, important partners – not only bilaterally but in Europe,” said Steffen Seibert, Ms Merkel’s spokesman. “That will naturally be a theme of the visit . . . we want an active, strong UK in the EU.”

Ms Merkel will highlight this in her speech, the first by a German leader to both houses since 1986. She will then have lunch with Mr Cameron before taking tea with the Queen at Buckingham Palace, returning to Berlin in the early evening.

Ms Merkel will be getting “the reddest of red carpets”, in the words of one British official. London hopes the lavish welcome could encourage Berlin to be more accommodating to Mr Cameron’s demands for EU reforms, including his hopes of diluting the union’s powers and curbing migration to appease eurosceptics at home.

William Hague, foreign secretary, said on Sunday the government planned to use Ms Merkel’s visit to try to persuade Berlin to support measures discouraging people from moving within the EU to access other nations’ welfare systems.

Mr Hague said on Sunday that he believed the Germans and British shared “common ground” over concerns about benefit tourism within the EU.

“We support the principle of free movement . . . but we don’t support people moving from one country to another because of the incentives of different benefit systems,” Mr Hague told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show. “And I think again with Germany we have a lot of common ground on that and there will be no problem discussing that.”

Officials in Berlin also hope Ms Merkel will press Mr Cameron to spell out exactly what concessions he wants from the EU as the price for staying in.

A German foreign policy expert said: “The UK lacks a consensus on what it wants from the EU. Outsiders like Germany cannot get a clear idea of what the UK actually wants.”

Ms Merkel shares some of Mr Cameron’s views on the EU. Like him, she wants to trim the powers of the Brussels bureaucracy and defends the market economy against criticism from countries that favour a state-led approach, notably France.

Britain sees Berlin as a possible ally in its bid to change some of the EU’s key treaties because Germany has also spoken of treaty change, albeit in the opposite direction – to boost the key institutions of the eurozone.

But German officials are wary about starting treaty change talks for fear of opening a Pandora’s box of demands from 28 countries. They also say Berlin’s plans for closer integration in the eurozone and London’s proposals for a looser union outside the eurozone could be incompatible.

Ms Merkel may give Mr Cameron some comfort on combating welfare abuse by EU migrants: members of her conservative CDU and its CSU have called for action. But, unlike Mr Cameron, the chancellor is a firm supporter of intra-EU migration.

German officials say there can be no question of reimposing migration controls on the bloc’s newest members, Romania and Bulgaria. Mr Cameron has threatened to veto the entry of future new member states like Serbia and Albania unless new migrant curbs are agreed but there is little interest in Berlin in even discussing this.

Berlin is worried that Britain is moving down a road that could, with a planned referendum on EU membership, result in its leaving the union.

Thomas Matussek, a former ambassador to the UK and now head of the Alfred Herrhausen Society, a think-tank, says: “We would like to help to keep Britain inside. But we can only keep the door open. Walking through the door must be done by the British themselves.”

&gt;Considering that OOXML has only received about 5.5% of the review that comparable standards have undergone, reports about inconsistencies, contradictions and missing information are hardly surprising.  


&gt;There have been allegations that the ISO ballot process for Office Open XML was marred with voting irregularities and heavy-handed tactics by some stakeholders

Before this, it could be said that every village spoke a different language with gradients of geographic similarity. There was no ""Polish"", ""Russian"", or ""Ukrainian"" (except the Krakow, Moscow, and Kiev dialects which would later be spread as the standard).

Zwar sprach ich von Posing-Bildern und Kinderpornographie, was es tatsaechlich auf den ersten Blick nahe legt, dass ""oder aehnlichem"" sich zumindest in diesen strafrechtlich relevanten Reigen gesellt. Aber erstens gibt es meines Wissens nach keine ""Steigerung"" zu KiPo, zweitens war mir nicht bewusst, dass wir hier eine Fachdiskussion fuehren wollen, also habe ich mich nicht um die Verwendung von termini technici geschert. In Ansehung der Tatsache, dass also ein Missverstaendnis vorliegen koennte, waere etwas Nachsicht deinerseits angebracht gewesen, bevor du meinst in die Offensive gehen zu muessen, was mir umso unverstaendlicher ist, als ich dir nichts unterstellt habe.

&gt; Finde ich interessant. Das schreibst du nachdem du einen Link zu einer Referenz bei Wikipedia setzt, die eine gewisse Korrelation beschreibt. Warum, weil es die für dein Argument falsche ist?

Was deinen Anwurf bezueglich meine Verlinkung auf Wikipedia betrifft, so liegt dem anscheinend ein Missverstaendnis deinerseits zu Grunde, denn erstens ist diese Erkenntnis, dass kein Zusammenhang zwischen diesem Schund und Kindesmissbrauch besteht keinesfalls gesichert, wie auch du anerkennst. Zweitens mache ich meine Intention ausweislich des Wortlautes meines Posts auch hinreichend deutlich, wenn ich argumentierte, dass selbst wenn es keinen Zusammenhang gaebe, dies keinen Unterschied machen wuerde. Insofern ist es auch unschaedlich, dass ich von Posing- und du von Nacktbildern gesprochen hast, auch wenn ich letztere in meine Argumentation ausweislich des letzten Arguments inkludiert hatte.

&gt; Etwas als Schund zu bezeichnen ist übrigens kein Anzeichen für eine rationale Diskussionsgrundlage.

Wie ich KiPo und aehnliches fuer mich bewertest, ueberlaesst du auch bitte mir. Wenn dir meine Bewertung nicht passt, musst du ja nicht mit mir diskutieren.

&gt; Und wer hat das gleichgesetzt?

Das hat /u/donvito getan. Da du an dieser Diskussion teilnimmst, bin ich davon ausgegangen, dass du den Thread gelesen hast.

Zu den Sachfragen:

&gt; Wieso man bei KiPo (oder sogar simplen Nacktfotos) also automatisch vom Gegenteil ausgeht ist mir schleierhaft.

Wie du zu Recht ausfuehrst, sprechen wir ueber ungesicherte Fakten. Daher eruebrigt sich fuer mich eine Diskussion. Ich habe dies nur der Vollstaendigkeit halber aufgefuehrt, da es fuer meine Argumentation nicht von Belang ist, ob diese Art von Schund einen Katalysatoreffekt hat oder nicht. Zumal ich ehrlich gesagt auch nicht die Qualifikation besitze, um einen ""educated guess"" zu treffen.

*L'attacco al cantiere*

Nella notte tra il 13 e 14 maggio scorso, un gruppo di 21 persone a viso coperto, aveva attaccato quattro cancelli del cantiere di Chiomonte, lanciando bengala, razzi e bottiglie incendiarie. In cinque avevano raggiunto il camminamento sopra il cunicolo esplorativo e scagliato 10-15 bottiglie incendiarie contro le forze dell'ordine e i mezzi del cantiere 

*I reati contestati*

L'accusa, formulata dai pm di Torino, nei confronti dei quattro arrestati (Mattia Zanotti, Chiara Zenobi, Claudio Alberto e Niccolò Blasi) è di «attentato con finalità terroristiche, atto di terrorismo con ordigni micidiali ed esplosivi, detenzione di armi da guerra, danneggiamento»

* Campaign season is in full swing, everyone's promising everything and more. 

* Reddit user /u/vernazza bravely stared into the abyss and the abyss has stared back at him as he spent the entire day with his and his girlfriend's family in a not-at-all uncomfortable manner. 

* [PM Orbán held the annual State of the Nation speech last Sunday, praising the economy to be at a 10-year high.](http://www.politics.hu/20140217/economic-performance-best-in-more-than-ten-years-says-pm-in-state-of-the-nation-speech/) As with many Fidesz achievements, this too is only true when put into the very specific context the government is using it in as they are really great at data crunching, using weird definitions for terms and such, i.e. employment is at a record high because people receiving unemployment benefits are now forced to do low effect public works, and their salary is the benefit, [making them part of the workforce and tidying up the numbers](http://www.politics.hu/20140217/registered-job-seekers-in-january-down-by-a-third-year-on-year/) this way. [Q4 GDP](http://www.politics.hu/20140217/q4-gdp-growth-at-eight-year-high/) and [public debts](http://www.politics.hu/20140217/hungary-public-debt-falls-to-79-of-gdp-at-end-of-2013/) are good too, but the overall economic outlook is still terrible. 

* Anti-campaigning is new on the campaign agenda this season, but with the help of foreign analysts and advisors, both major parties are pretty good at it. [In a miraculously well-timed manner, parts of the report on former-PM Gyurcsány's notorious speech \(when he admitted to lying to the people in front of his party delegates in a closed meeting\) was released](http://www.politics.hu/20140223/govt-website-excerpts-official-report-on-gyurcsany-lies-speech/) and it stated that Gyurcsány and the Socialists were informed about the existence of the recording before it hit the media and they consciously decided to let Fidesz ""leak"" it. The things he said in the speech could've been interpreted as somewhat well-intentioned and I think they didn't expect the media to view it in such a negative manner because of the ""we lied"" part. Absurd, but that's Hungarian politics for you. 

* Other than general campaigning, the main topic of discussion was the land law this week. Politicians are stillwanting to prohibit foreigners to buy land in the country, [including the removal of assets](http://www.politics.hu/20140220/ministry-says-mps-betrayed-hungarian-farmers-by-voting-against-law-criticized-by-eu/) from those very few (~50) Austrian farmers who already own land here. Again, it's the [""Evil EU vs. us, the innocent little lambs""](http://www.politics.hu/20140217/austrian-farm-minister-took-another-unfriendly-step-says-govt-official/) story, as [EU officials debate](http://www.politics.hu/20140219/eu-to-review-hungary-land-law/) if what we are planning to do is legal or not.

* [A ""celebrity"" doula, midwife and advocate of home birth was released from home arrest by court order](http://www.politics.hu/20140220/court-frees-celebrated-homebirth-midwife-from-house-arrest-amid-hopes-for-presidential-pardon/). One of her patients died due to what the attorney says was negligence, but what she states as unavoidable misfortune. 

* [Major national Jewish organization seems to not take part in all Holocaust Memorial Year events](http://www.politics.hu/20140220/hungarian-jewish-federation-eyes-holocaust-year-boycott-as-officials-woo-israelis/) as a protest against the government's whitewashing acts relating to the planned German Occupation Memorial.

* The government is having a hard-on for Iran these weeks. First, [we were one of only four countries sending official congratulatory messages on the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution](http://www.politics.hu/20140213/unity-criticises-hungary-leaders-revolution-anniversary-greetings-to-iran/), the other three being Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Azerbaijan. Now, [we are seeking to replace Ukraine in grain import to the country](http://www.politics.hu/20140223/hungary-said-looking-to-exploit-breach-in-ukraine-iran-agricultural-trade/) (because hey, we're all about style and right timing) and also planning to [open a cultural center there.](http://www.politics.hu/20140217/hungarian-commerce-culture-centre-could-reportedly-open-in-iran/)

You can be in a very rich and be running an horrible system for part of the population. You can also have the hearth at the right place but be very broke.

Social progress isn't linked only to money. I'd say it's more linked to how the omnipresent rich&amp;powerfull act to others around them. 

European history taught the leading class that if they oppress others or just plain forget about them (if food prices rise too hard for example or poverty goes rampant) it can (and WILL) blow up hard in their face so our leaders tend not to act like kings owned all and everything. It's a *cultural* thing.

East europe got a bit of it but then it got partly taken back. To expand, they got the red revolution which tossed the oligarch out. On the other hand staline was a goddam monster and fucked everything then the leaders following him were stuck in a (cold)war with the US destroying their economy and were just downright horribly bad at logistics and leading properly a country (you can't lead half a continent with 10 people; and they couldn't really handle delegating power for their own safety. Anybody criticizing the way things were run disappeared ""for social safety"" instead of being able offering better ways of running things, so nobody had any initiative and the country starved it's own stalling economy to death); so people tend to associate the opposite with bad memories too which screwed their economy/history a bit further.

Basically Europe run due to both culture and a bit of luck. The ukrainian or Thai or  hadn't said luck. The same can be said for a lot of countries. *We got lucky* and East Europe for example is still very close (about 10-20 years behind) and could easily join us in fact, even if very broke economically. Europe isn't just made of ""geniuses"". But i guess admitting it doesn't flatter the european ego just as much.

(and for the context i believe a lot of country are rising. For example life in china is becoming *better* even if living standards are currently bad there. While America is slowly going down to a dystopian police state led by all owning oligarchs lording above poors everywhere, and Europe risk stumbling to a stalling economy too).",0,1393185676,null,0,1393187078,0,cfmr676,t3_1ypauv,t1_cfmr676,t1_cfmocx6,null,1432525839,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

true,New-Atlantis,EURO,European Union,"&gt; I hear from UKIPers that they'll just sign a big free trade deal with Commonwealth countries

Not just from UKIPers, I hear that from others too. And there are parallels in the real world. The 5 eyes spying alliance is between the UK, US, NZ, Ca, and Oz and targets continental Europe together with 'enemy' states. British politicians and businessmen like to draw on their privileged relations with Honk Kong, India and other Common Wealth nations, etc. In short, the influence of the Empire is still there. In fact, without this idea the UK doesn't have a plan for the post Brexit era. 

When doing business in Asia, I can usually count on fellow businessmen from other EU countries to help with info etc., not so from the British, they keep themselves to themselves. 

But perhaps most importantly, it is the incapability of Britain to be a team player in Europe, that marks their special position. When we hear from Britain, it is either because they are vetoing something, want another opt-out, want their rebate, or because they are trying to build some alliances with Poland, the Czech Rep., the Netherlands, and now Germany, to split the EU: ""divide and conquer."" Old habits die hard.

That is just media hype. In fact, the German foreign minister said that Putin's envoy in Kiev had been very helpful in brokering the deal. It was probably he who made it plain to Yanukovych that he couldn't count on Russia's support if the situation continued to spiral out off control.

Russia does not want a civil war on its doorsteps. The Russians didn't have any means to calm down the situation after Yanukovych failed, since the protesters would hardly accept them as mediators. 

Thus, the disappointment to Russia is that Yanukovych failed. They bet on the wrong horse. They may even be secretly grateful to the EU for calming the situation.

Well, I know what you mean, but that's too much.

As an ethnic Ukrainian who lived in Crimea for almost of year, I've got another opinion. Yeah, people in Crimea are greatly influenced by Russian propaganda, but in the vast majority (95%) they do not bother that much about Ukranian government or even language. What they fear is mythical blood-thursting Benderovtsy from Western Ukraine, that was the main achievement of propaganda, but you wouldn't call Europeans or Americans frightened of Muslim terrorists (that they never saw) 'fucked in the head', would you?

Another 5% are just people with too much free time who take the whole Russia vs Ukraine thing too seriously and their personal challenge. This is the people you see on the video.

Sevastopol is a bit other thing, this a city of Russian military pensioners. so the split is maybe closer to 80%/20%, which is potentially dangerous.

La felicità è come una curva sul grafico: metti sulle x la cultura/informazione/istruzione e sulle y la felicità: il grafico inizia con una linea che è poco sopra lo zero, per poi aumentare col crescere dell'informazione e arriva al punto massimo a metà circa: tutte le informazioni che raccogli dopo sono superflue e inizi a scoprire un sacco di merda che ti fa male al cervello, quindi la curva scende.
Per questo molte volte invidio le persone che stanno nel loro mondo e ignorano bellamente, concentrandosi su amici di Maria de Filippi, sulle moto, sul calcio (a livello ossessivo-ignorante), sui concerti di Justin bieber ecc.

2. Il calcio non è il male e qualora avessi un figlio lo spingerei a giocare a calcio piuttosto che giocare a videogiochi o nerdare: è salutare, si fanno amicizie, ci si diverte. Anche semplicemente seguendolo e parlandone con gli amici. Ok, dietro girano troppi soldi per uno sport e corruzioni a manetta ma non è causa del calcio in sé. Le persone che dicono che sono 11 cretini che corrono dietro a un pallone mi fanno girare il cazzo e questo proviene da uno a cui il calcio non piace.

3. Le persone che dicono che la musica elettronica (house, techno...) fa cagare e non è musica, mi disgustano. Pieno così di metallari che mi indicano di ""ascoltare musica seria"" dicendomi Pink Floyd, metallica, ac dc, iron maiden ecc.
Poi gli dico che una volta ascoltavo Suffocation, Bloodbath, Slipknot (a cui aprirò una parentesi dopo), metallica, gorgoroth, dimmu borgir, immortal, shining, opeth, SOAD etc. e rimangono stupiti. Insomma, per me crescere è stato realizzare che i veri bimbiminchia spesso sono i metallari e che David Guetta, AVICII, Swedish house mafia, skrillex sono musica.
Poi ci sono quelli che ""ma gli slipknot non è musika!!1 ascolta sto assolo di malmsteen..."" Ma non me ne frega un cazzo del tuo assolo di malmsteen, gli slipknot e altri gruppi NU sono diventati famosi proprio per il loro stile particolare, la voce non da frocio, i testi che hanno significato ecc.

- come diceva Cossiga, è uno che ha sempre, sempre fatto politica davvero, ha iniziato attaccando i manifesti ed è arrivato alla presidenza del consiglio.

- è stato il miglior ministro degli esteri che abbiamo mai avuto.

- è rimasto coerente con le sue idee pur prendendosi la responsabilità di svolte epocali e difficili della sinistra italiana. Continua a dichiararsi garantista e ateo, e pensa che i giornalisti italiani siano tutti coglioni, tre idee che alla sinistra dei salotti non piacciono più da un bel po'.

- Ha subito stoicamente, senza mai piegarsi, tutta una serie di inesatezze sulla famosa questione della bicamerale, di cui nessuno ha mai capito un cazzo, e che lui pazientemente rispiega ogni volta che viene tirata fuori. 

- gli fanno le pulci ingiustamente per cazzate come la barca (che tra l'altro era in società) e le scarpe, come se un dirigente politico che ha avuto incarichi di peso non abbia tutto il diritto di avere una vita da benestante.

- è un oratore e un pensatore inarrivabile. Ha il gusto per la battuta e se non sei preparato in un dibattito con lui ti schianti (e infatti lo evitano attentamente)

- Ha rinunciato alla laurea alla normale di Pisa per non passare da raccomandato, anche se aveva finito tutti gli esami.

- Ha una cultura da far impallidire pressoché ogni politico italiano, forse con l'esclusione di Mussi e Diliberto.

- Ha fatto uno dei migliori discorsi mai fatti da un politico della seconda repubblica, che ancora adesso fa impallidire per lucidità e lungimiranza. [Questo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AowTgxkIGv0)
