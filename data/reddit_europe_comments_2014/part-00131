Well in §3 it says

&gt;Den lovgivende magt er hos kongen og folketinget i forening. Den udøvende magt er hos kongen. Den dømmende magt er hos domstolene. 

which means that the Queen and parliament have to agree on every law. And that the Queen is head of government.

§12 says:

&gt;Kongen har med de i denne grundlov fastsatte indskrænkninger den højeste myndighed over alle rigets anliggender og udøver den gennem ministrene.

which means that the Queen is the highest authority regarding all the empires matters and exerts that power through ministers. So? If Minister A doesn't do what i (The Queen) says then Minister A is fired and Minister B will do what i want. How the Queen can do that? Because §14!

§13

&gt;Kongen er ansvarsfri; hans person er fredhellig. Ministrene er ansvarlige for regeringens førelse; deres ansvarlighed bestemmes nærmere ved lov.

is a special exemption for the Queen. It doesn't mean what you think.

&gt;The king/queen/regent has literally been stripped of all power through the constitution. If you truly believe otherwise, I'd invite you to write a paper on this subject and revolutionize danish law forever, since you'll be disagreeing with every danish lawyer ever.

Did you actually read Grundloven?

§14:

&gt;Kongen udnævner og afskediger statsministeren og de øvrige ministre.

The Queen names the ministers. Without consultion or any other right of the parliament.

&gt;Han bestemmer deres antal og forretningernes fordeling imellem dem.

The queen decides how many ministers there are and what they do.

&gt;Kongens underskrift under de lovgivningen og regeringen vedkommende beslutninger giver disse gyldighed, når den er ledsaget af en eller flere ministres underskrift. 

Without the Queens signature any law or decree is invalid.

&gt;Enhver minister, som har underskrevet, er ansvarlig for beslutningen.

Again, this is just because the Sovereign is exempt from all responsibilty. And *someone* has to be responsible.

&gt; It turned the war around. Without Russia's military help, the Abkhazian minority would have never been able to ethnically cleanse the Georgian majority out of Abkhazia.

Nope. It's not that simple, it never is. Russians were there as well and a lot of them were killed as well, georgian leadership were stubborn and extremely corrupt - they didn't want peace either, as well as abkhazians. Don't put every sin in that fucked up civil war on Russia, we were avoiding civil deaths at least while dealing with two fucked up regimes. Being corrupt and incompetent idiots as we were there - no arguing there.

It would be equivalent IF russians in the early nineties had some word in what was going on in the country, and pretty much noone apart of a small circle of people knew what's going on and noone but them could control it. We all were naive idealistic idiots with crap in the head, including myself. I can say that i'm really ashamed of myself in the early nineties, doing idiotic stupid things without really understanding anything.

Are you responsible for killing 40+(or 100+, i don't know) people in Odessa a week ago? Do you have a share of responsibility? Is your country responsible for it? It's kind of different questions which will have different answers, isn't it?

And why do you think i'm distorting or dodging anything? I'm perfectly honest, what exactly do i need to be ashamed of? Nothing.

The second is that a lot of people probably probably think that benefits shouldn't be being paid in a lot of circumstances where it is being paid. Thus, whilst fraud is relatively low, it's because the qualifying criteria is so large.

&gt; Når der i de forskellige grundlovsbestemmelser siges, at beslutninger træffes af kongen, betyder det ikke at kongen har personlige beføjelser. Den reelle kompetence ligger *altid* hos ministrene, når der træffes beslutning i henhold til de pågældende grundlovsbestemmelser, uanset om kongen formelt medvirker eller ej. En personlig deltagelse i statsstyret fra kongen side er uforenligt med parlamentarismen og strider mod bestemmelserne i grundlovens § 12, 13 og 14.

I don't actually speak danish, i'm just able to read it. Anyway... As said already, Kongen uses his power through ministers he can fire at will. That' s the next best thing.

&gt;Hver eneste gang der står ""kongen"", betyder det regeringen.

It doesn't, because then it would say so. But it doesn't. It means ""King"". The same King that is the government. Regeringen handler in the name of the king, doesn't it? I'm pretty sure it does.

&gt;Når der i de forskellige grundlovsbestemmelser siges, at beslutninger træffes af kongen, betyder det ikke at kongen har personlige beføjelser. Den reelle kompetence ligger altid hos ministrene, når der træffes beslutning i henhold til de pågældende grundlovsbestemmelser, uanset om kongen formelt medvirker eller ej.

The law doesn't actually support that. Not completely at last. The law says that the king has all the power, but may only use it *through the ministers*. Obviously the ministers can make decisions on their own, that is not in question. But the King can change the ministers at any time and without giving a reason.

&gt;Men kongen har ikke **nogen faktisk magt**, selvom det selvfølgelig umiddelbart kan læses sådan.

Exactly. But we were talking about theoretical power. So, the king kinda actually does have real power. Until it is taken away from him by revolution. Which would quite probably happen immediately.

Your HS diploma plus a cumulative 3.0 GPA might qualify you for a ""college readiness test"". Also, the language requirement of B1 might only qualify you for a college prep course called ""Studienkolleg"". This is a one year long course offered for student who don't hold a German high school diploma qualifying for direct access to Fachhochschule or Universität. Usually you are on a B1 language level if you took German 2 or 3 in High School. I hope you are not getting ripped off with the three month course and promise of B1 language competence. At least make sure they offer the ""Deutsche Sprachdiplom II"" at the end of the course. Without that the universities in Germany won't even consider your application. Some colleges and universities will grant you access if you prove to them that a) you are competent enough in the language and b) have all the pre-requisite material studied or scored high on ACT and SAT scores. I think the ACT threshold is somewhere around 29 composite score. There is another website where you can look up the recognition of U.S. High School diploma in Germany and equivalency requirements.

&gt; Gun's don't people, people kill people. A gun is as harmless is a pillow.

If that's so, then why can't I take a gun on a plane, but I can take a pillow on a plane? The gun is just as likely to hijack the plane as the pillow, right? According to you, it's just as safe for me to take a machine gun on a plane, as a pillow. Absolute bullshit. It's like saying: ""Unsafe sex doesn't cause aids, HIV does! So everybody, have as much unsafe sex as you want, just make sure you don't get HIV!""

But we all know that unsafe sex is one of the things that can get you HIV and thus aids.

A gun is a million times more dangerous than a pillow. I can't kill a dozen people within a few minutes with a pillow. I can do that with a sub machine gun.

&gt; Do we blame pencils for bad grammar?

No but we do blame both pencils and eye stabbers if they are specifically designed to stab people in the eye and people use them to stab people in the eyes.

Murderers and guns should be blamed, but only guns can be controlled. Insane people will ALWAYS exist, the only thing you can do is try to keep dangerous weaponry out of their hands. Gun control will never be 100% safe, but its safer than no gun control.

A nice piece about it:

&gt; Then there’s the whole protection issue. Let’s take the recent tragedy in Aurora, which is obviously why I’m writing this piece. The guy who opened fire on the theater was dressed from head to toe in SWAT gear, armed like Rambo, and had the added bonus of a gas mask (which came in very handy when he tear-gassed the whole audience). The yahoos out there are saying “if there’d been someone there with a gun, it would have been a different story. So don’t go takin’ our guns away!”

&gt; Really?

&gt; First, as far as I know, Colorado allows you to carry firearms with a concealed weapons permit.

&gt; So…where the fuck were all those gun-toting people?!

&gt; Here are two facts for you:

&gt; 1 – It is completely legal to conceal a firearm in a movie theater in Colorado, as long as you have a license (which is easy enough to obtain).

&gt; 2 – You don’t need to know how to operate a gun, or demonstrate that ability, in order to own and carry a firearm.

&gt;So, let’s recap. The current laws ALLOWED there to be a slew of heroes “packing heat” in the audience that day. The fact the there weren’t any proves one thing: it means fuck all to have a gun if you’re not actually going to carry the damned thing. And who takes a fucking gun to a movie theater anyway? If you saw a gun tucked into someone’s belt as they were in line for The Dark Knight Rises tomorrow, you’d shit a brick and call the police. Unless you had your own gun, which could result in a shootout and two dead “heroes.”

&gt; But if there actually had been a hero there with a gun, he or she was outgunned and would have had no way to combat the tear gas. Basically, firing a gun blindfolded into a crowd in the hope of hitting the target.

&gt; Think that would have helped?

&gt; What if 10 people there had been carrying? Oh the joy of all those bullets going back and forth in a crowded place filled with innocent families. Maybe James Holmes would have been hit, but how many others would have been shot in the process.

&gt; Tell me I’m wrong on any of that. Tell me you, with your gun, if you’d been there, would have made a difference.

&gt; Liar.

&gt; Because we also have to realize that no one, not even you Mr. Tough Fuy, knows how they will react in that kind of situation. You could be a dead shot at the range, but those paper targets don’t fire back. That movie theater was a night and day situation. You’re under fire, unexpectedly, and the maniac has way more ammo and armor than you.

&gt; He’s ready. You're not.

&gt; When was the last time you were at the range? When did you practice? Have you ever taken a life? Could you? Would you freeze? You don’t know. Not unless you’ve had real training or seen combat, in which case, you’re not an average Joe anyway.

In South America, the take can go as high as 90%. I was in Northern Iraq last year, and their tax is roughly 90% as well. Ireland's tax is 25%, capping out at 40% for large finds. 

So giving away exploration rights isn't exactly a bad thing. It encourages production. Where Ireland screwed up is not taxing finds at international standards. If they want to encourage exploration and production they could have made the tax and exploration rights costs lower than international standards, but not drastically lower like they have done. 

They are a peaceful country with a strong rule of law. That is a strong incentive to explore there over the developing world.

So if you are open for a move to a more rural area, your chances will increase. But I should warn you that people in those rural areas tend to be friendly, but they are also less used to foreigners.

true,JasonYamel,UKRA,Ukraine,"&gt; The country is an abstract and decisions are made by people, someone supports them, someone doesn't. A country being responsible is a bit of a hazy concept honestly. I mean it's possible to have that wording in some contexts, but it's very lazy and dangerous way of thinking.

Well then, you share responsibility as much as any American shares responsibility for Iraq.

&gt; Don't put every sin in that fucked up civil war on Russia

Russia was the only player with resources - so my blaming it for the outcome does not mean it did so out of pure malice or anything. Although bringing in Basayev was decidedly not nice.

&gt;And as i was saying it's an idiotic concept.

It works out pretty nicely for Russians then - change a president and suddenly no one is to blame. I'd even accept that argument if something was different about Russia now, if it learned its lesson - but it is much worse now, an imperialist dictatorship invading its neighbours whenever it pleases. You Russians seem to support your leadership, so here I will agree with you - those who support these policies share the blame. And everyone, regardless of personal opinions, will share the inevitable consequences of chauvinism, fascism and imperialism that rules your country today.

&gt;It would be equivalent IF russians in the early nineties had some word in what was going on in the country, and pretty much noone apart of a small circle of people knew what's going on and noone but them could control it. We all were naive idealistic idiots with crap in the head, including myself. I can say that i'm really ashamed of myself in the early nineties, doing idiotic stupid things without really understanding anything.

But collectively you are much much worse now, more chauvinistic, imperialistic, racist, etc. So now you DO know what you want, and it turns out it's Abkhazia times 10.

Note how I say ""collectively"", implying that you as a person can be different.

&gt;It looks like you're desperately trying to accuse me of something or prove something to me or catch me on something i said or did or thought, what's up with that?

How many times do I need to say that I'm not personally accusing YOU of anything? Do you have paranoia or guilt for something? Gee.

tl;dr Tibet was a feudal society when the Chinese conquered/reasserted their rule. As with other Chinese provinces under the newly-formed people's republic, Tibet received improved healthcare, literacy, and infrastructure such as roads and hospitals. Chinese rule in Tibet has often been compared to Roman rule - sure, you don't have autonomy, but you get the benefits of modern civilization, so you've got that goin' for you, which is nice.  

As a side note, you have to understand that Chinese history is a cycle between two states: strong centralized power where all territory is thoroughly controlled followed by periods of anarchy when different chunks of territory a foreigner would consider 'China' are controlled by different people. Tibet was a part of China under the last Chinese dynasty (the Qing) then started drifting into autonomy when the Qing was in decline and even more so when the monarchy was overthrown and the Republic of China was born - as we can see with Ukraine right now, it's not easy to keep all of your country's land in check post-revolution. So when Mao reclaimed Tibet westerners saw it as a nasty land grab (plus, we were freaked out about the spread of Communism ans were all like 'OMG Domino theory!!!1!') but Chinese, aware of the cyclical nature of their history, just say it as yet another return to strong centralized control after a period of anarchy. China scholar Martin Jacques has proposed that China is a civilization state rather than a nation state for more or less this reason and talks about it [here](http://www.ted.com/talks/martin_jacques_understanding_the_rise_of_china).

The rise of UKIP (which isn't very significant, even with the opinion polls the way they are) is just populism which is independent of how the EU actually operates.

The EU could be the best institution that was ever invented and never do wrong, but support for UKIP would still exist because the EU are demonised by the press, justly or otherwise.

I do think it is fairly inevitable that the EU will gain power over time and eventually become more like a government of states than a union of countries. But that won't happen for a very long time, and is not necessarily a bad thing in the face of the uncertain future.

Others argue given the criminals may already out number you, anything other than lethal on the first shot is stupid because once you fire, they know where you are.

My personal policy is I will not go downstairs to have a gun battle with a robber, unless I have family down there.  That being said the minute the robber moves to come up the stairs, where my family sleeps, I paint the walls with his organs and body fluids.  There is admittedly a 99.99% chance he is just coming up to find other stuff to steal, but there is that slight chance he's a rapist, serial killer, or whatever other paranoid home invader you care to picture who is looking for the bedrooms and people.  I don't care to roll those dice, so my first shot will be lethal.  That personally is why I don't bother with less than lethal.  I'll exercise caution, a duty to retreat, and keep the family safe upstairs, my non lethal action was not going down and shooting him when he was unplugging the TV.

ACTA, as we know, was the subject of a Europe-wide primarily online campaign aimed at the EP, and was duly voted down. In Ireland, our version of SOPA was similarly the target of a public campaign, which was sufficient to provoke the government into sending the relevant Minister to defend his position at a public meeting in our Science Gallery. 

That, however, was *all* that was achieved - the Minister stonewalled the meeting, and passed the legislation. As it happens, the legislation could be, and was, passed by simple Ministerial order without going through our parliament, but even had it gone through parliament it would have made no difference, since every vote in the Irish parliament is subject to a three-line whip.

I would see it as highly likely that the same pattern will apply in respect of TTIP. It certainly applies in respect of our financial legislation, which is regularly written by the financial companies and passed by governmental decree. The main lobbying group for the financial services sector actually meets in government buildings, and is chaired by a senior civil servant.

Er hatte eine recht gut gemachte (und teilweise früher auch inhaltlich gute) Radiosendung auf Fritz vom RBB - dort ist er aber gegangen worden, weil er eben zunehmend Mist erzählt hat bzw. vom beobachtenden und aufklärenden Journalist, falls er das wirklich jemals war, zum Welterklärer mutiert ist, der die grosse Verschwörung kennt und die Menschen aufklären will...Widersprüche und richtige Recherche gehöhren da nicht mehr dazu. Ich hatte die Sendung vom ihm zum 11. September gehört: Fast 100% Truther Bullshit! Und mich gefragt wie lange das der RBB wohl noch durchgehen lässt... kurz darauf kam Broder und hat ihn - so fair muss man sein - absichtlich missverstanden: Er hat sich in dem Zitat auf die [Inszenierung des Holocausts durch Göbbels bezogen, der das Buch über Public-Relations von Bernays kannte und gelesen hat.](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays#Einfluss_auf_Joseph_Goebbels). 

&gt; Warum hören Menschen dem zu?

Weil die Welt ein abgefuckter Ort ist. Weil es vielen schlecht geht. Und er einfache Antworten liefert und schuldige benennt in schöner Verschwörungslogik. 

&gt;  Warum erkennen manche nicht, was das für ein armer Irrer ist?

Der großteil der Ken Jebsen Anhänger ist auch offen gegenüber Verschwörungstheorien. Ken Jebsen agiert in ähnlichen Mustern und Logiken. Ich glaube - ehrlich gesagt - dass der Mensch in gewisser Weise dafür anfällig ist und Ken Jebsen halt nur die Deutsche Variante ähnlicher ""Phropheten"" überall auf der Welt ist. 

&gt; Warum bezeichnen Menschen den als Held?

Wenn jemand die vermeintlich verbotene Wahrheit verkündet, dafür nur von seinem Job geschasst wird (in der Logik der Anhänger) und erfolgreich im Web weiter macht und bei Demonstrationen spricht - dann hat das schon viel einer Heldenerzählung. Das nutzt er natürlich aus und gefällt sich sehr in dieser Rolle. Der Artikel ist mit dem Prädikat ""Narzisst"" vermutlich ziemlich nah dran an der Wahrheit. 

&gt; Hilfe, warum ist es inzwischen so populär &amp; akzeptiert, so weit rechts zu sein? :(

Ich behaupte mal, dass der Grossteil seiner Anhänger nicht offen rechts sind. Der Vorwurf der ihm gemacht wird ist halt Antisemitismus bzw. sekundärer Antisemitismus. Der Vorwurf ist durchaus berechtigt, aber offen völkische oder nationalistische Worte habe ich vom ihm noch nicht gehört. 

Er glaubt halt zu viel von dieser Verschwörungskacke. Und vieles was er erzählt ist durchaus manchmal mit Quellen belegbar. Standard Oil - und aufgrund der damligen Machtverhältnisse auch mutmasslich wissentlich Rockefeller und IBM Rechenmaschinen sind wissenschaftlich belegt. Seine 9/11 Truther und Gladio-NATO Geschichten eher nicht... 

Nach seiner ""Klarstellung"" und der heute hier verlinkten ""Die Natur ist so toll, Demokratie ist Müll, da bleiben die Zugvögel auf Sylt stecken..."" Rede glaube ich aber auch, dass er _leider_ zunehmend den Bezug der Realität verloren hat...

true,antifool73,null,null,"Durante questa fortunata combinazione di festività è venuta a trovarmi un'amica di Torino. Abbiamo fatto amene passeggiate per Roma, e dopo gli iniziali entusiasmi ho notato nella mia ospite una certa stanchezza, quasi una sorta di insofferenza, di fastidio. Le ho chiesto quale fosse il problema e la risposta è stata: ""Questa città non ti dà pace, si vuole fare notare con la forza, prendendoti a schiaffi."" Non ho potuto che darle ragione. Roma è una città che bullizza i suoi abitanti. Quando camminando per i suoi i vicoli inciampi su un sampietrino mezzo divelto, sembra ti gridi contro: ""A cojone! Devi piegare la testa al mio cospetto. Guarda un po' che cazzo sono io. Io sono Roma e tu sei solo un povero stronzo.""

Roma cerca ancora di incularti con le sue cazzate tipo Caput Mundi, Città Eterna, Capitale, ecc..., e invece dovrebbe darsi una ridimensionata radicale. Ancora ingroppa il sogno di quello che fu, ancora esige tributi e onori per una trapassata superiorità. Ma se la guardi bene, soprattutto nelle notti del weekend, è il posto peggiore sulla faccia della terra.

Roma si è fermata a metà del processo che l'avrebbe dovuta portare da vecchia città novecentesca (più o meno) a metropoli moderna e capitale occidentale, tipo Parigi (da sempre ignobile punto di riferimento), Londra o Berlino. Be', Roma non ce l'ha fatta e non credo ce la possa fare. Non è in grado di rinnovarsi, troppo narcisa e indolente, troppo sicura di sé. Pretende che gli altri cambino, che gli altri si romanizzino. Pensa ancora di avere il privilegio di essere capita. Roma è eterna nel senso che è immobile nello spazio e nel tempo, non la schiodi mai.

E da qui deriva tutta una serie di prese a male.

SPOSTARSI A ROMA

Spostarsi a Roma è difficile quanto scopare durante un bombardamento nucleare. Con qualsiasi mezzo. La cosa ovviamente snerva parecchio e spesso lo scenario diventa quello di GTA. Vengono sguainati coltelli, attacchi col cric—insomma, si rischia la vita.

Per non parlare della metro di Roma, la peggiore metro della storia dell'umanità: non arriva da nessuna parte utile, è un cesso, passa poco, si rompe se piove e una volta al mese si ferma tutto perché c'è sempre uno sciopero. Non ci si va neanche a suicidarsi per quanto fa cacare. Gli autobus sono un bordello uguale, e viaggiando in superficie si vive l'armageddon generale sopra delineato. Inoltre sui notturni c'è sempre una gran puzza di piscio, chissà perché...

Quindi alla fine il mezzo ritenuto migliore rimane il motorino o motorone (tipo i 125 - 150). Le strade sciamano di orde di questi cosi tipo Mad Max, che non si fermano davanti a niente rifiutando la basilare teoria dell'impenetrabilità dei corpi. Anche lì rischio gun-fight elevato come a Compton. Prendere il taxi invece è considerato disonorevole, perché costano troppo e poi i tassisti romani sono addirittura più odiati delle guardie.


I LOCALI

Se devo immaginarmi un girone infernale me lo figuro come un locale romano, con pianto e stridore di denti. Si respira una tensione senza paragoni. Varcata la soglia, un strato spesso fatto di ansia da prestazione e mitomania ti si posa sul corpo come un asciugamano bagnato. In più, questa strepitosa accoglienza avviene in ambienti sapientemente allestiti secondo il gusto di un satrapo bulgaro. E così, immersi in un'assordante musica di merda, si potrà prendere parte a furiosi corpo a corpo per raggiungere il bar e pagare 15 euro per un cocktail di merda. Nessuno è interessato a nessuno. Occhi spenti ti scrutano nella nebbia polverosa di cocaina tagliata male: un deserto di corpi, una gran solitudine.

Ogni tanto qualche illuminato organizza qualche evento un minimo diverso, dove però si riversa in massa tutta la città. E dopo aver affrontato un viaggio eterno per raggiungere il posto ed esserne usciti vivi, è un po' pesante farsi due ore di fila per entrare.

Una situazione del genere si è verificata recentemente con la riapertura del Rialto. Per tutte le vacanze di pasqua si è assiepata una moltitudine di umani alla ricerca della agognata svolta della serata. Pare che ci sia stato qualcuno che per entrare ha aspettato anche tre ore in fila, manco ci fosse il Cristo risorto.

_(FOTO DI ZECCA CHE PISCIA IN UN ANGOLO, inoltre: o c'è una tensione pazzesca o ti guardano con gli occhi spenti, mettiti d'accordo)_

SPETTACOLO E POLITICA

Se poi riesci a penetrare in una di queste serate ""giuste"", la scesazza arriva inesorabile quando ci vedi troneggiare tronfia la gente dello spettacolo. La Rai, Cinecittà, il Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia continuano a produrre dalle loro catene di montaggio persone ignobili che scorrazzano felici per la città con l'aria di chi ha colto la verità dell'esistere.

Gli attori, le attrici e la gente famosa in generale con la loro inesauribile e disgustosa voglia di stare al centro dell'attenzione ti rovinano la soddisfazione di essere per una volta uscito di casa e di non stare in un posto di merda, riportandoti alla dura realtà, dove attrezzi come loro sono considerati più fichi di te. La combo mortale è quando l'orripilante mondo Rai/cinema si fonde con quello della politica, formando una gigantesca macchina che spegne la gioia di vivere. Di solito sono appostati in bar del centro, seppelliti da bicchieri vuotati nervosamente, che schiamazzano e ridono peggio di un tavolo di Erasmus spagnoli che hanno rimorchiato delle americane in infradito.

I GHETTI

Forse questa cosa ha a che fare con le difficoltà di spostamento. Roma è spietatamente divisa in ghetti, cioè in quartieri dai quali non si esce se non raramente per andare tutti insieme nelle serate ""giuste"". Visto che affrontare il Lungo Tevere la sera è follia, me ne rimango nel quartiere, senza un cazzo da fare.

Si dice che a Roma ci siano più avvocati che in tutta la Francia (o il Giappone) e la metà dei ristoranti di Milano. Quindi nella maggior parte dei casi rimanere nel quartiere vuol dire prendere una birra in un bar e bertela su una panchina.

Mi viene il sospetto che questa reclusione volontaria nella propria zona, nel proprio territorio come branchi di lupi, vada oltre la difficoltà di spostamento—anzi, forse ne è una causa. L'indolenza della città penetra nelle ossa e nella mente dei suoi abitanti, che si abbrutiscono nelle loro case, nelle loro strade, fino a non trovare più senso nella ricerca di altro, di qualcosa di nuovo.


AFFITTI ALLE STELLE

Per prendere una casa in affitto decente, in un posto non ai confini dell'universo, hai bisogno di uno stipendio netto di almeno 2.500 euro. Sto parlando di un appartamento sui 50/60 metri quadri da prendere da soli, e che costa non meno di 1.000 euro al mese più le spese. Alla fine quando arrivi sui trenta perché devi essere costretto a dividere ancora la casa con altri coinquilini o peggio con la tua ragazza? La risposta è: perché non te lo puoi permettere. Anche in altre città vivere in zone centrali o poco fuori dal centro è proibitivo, però le periferie non fanno cacare come a Roma.

L'ultimo intervento architettonico-urbanistico di un certo spessore lo ha fatto il Duce negli anni Trenta, dopo solo merda. Ovviamente non rimpiango quel periodo, tutt'altro. Dico solo che la gran parte di quello che è stato fatto dopo è più o meno inabitabile. Nessuno vuole andare a vivere a Rebibbia o alla Dragona o a Spinaceto. Si va al Pigneto, a Tor Pignattara al limite al Quadraro, ora anche a Centocelle Vecchia, tutti posti costruiti prima della seconda guerra mondiale.

L'alternativa è decidere di affittare una grotta a Trastevere, un sottoscala a Monti o un buco di culo senza finestre a Testaccio, e quando rientri a casa, dopo aver buttato la tua giornata ad alzare quei quattro soldi con cui ti paghi l'affitto, ti viene una leggerissima ansia che spesso sfocia in uno scuro cupio dissolvi.

XENOFOBIA

A Roma non è una buona idea essere: napoletano, non in grado di guidare un'automobile o motorino, nero, buono d'animo (che si traduce con il termine 'cojone'), calabrese, un trans, una guardia, terrone senza provare vergogna di esserlo, milanese, ebreo o musulmano, gravato da una forma qualsiasi di disabilità, americano, gay, sud americano con fattezze indios, rom, cinese, bengalese e asiatico in generale, veneto, tassista, ottimista, fiorentino e infine povero.



INGOVERNABILITÀ CRONICA

Nessun amministratore, sindaco, console, tribuno o che cazzo volete voi è riuscito a domare questa belva chiamata Roma. Parlando dei tempi recenti basterebbe fare l'elenco dei sindaci: Rutelli, Veltroni, Alemanno (che doveva essere un fascista duro alla Rudy Giuliani e che invece era un moscio pure lui) e Marino. Quest'ultimo è noto solo per fare dei colossali chioppi in bicicletta mentre cerca di raggiungere il Campidoglio. Ma non è colpa loro, che possono fare. Governano per cinque anni, e quelli non bastano neanche a capire le dimensioni della città, figuriamoci a darle un senso.


Credo che quando dà il peggio di sé, Roma sia veramente la Capitale d'Italia, una sfinge maligna e incomprensibile a cui vuoi comunque bene e che ti delude sempre. Un mio amico ha proposto questa chiave di lettura: _""Se hai la merda dentro, anche fuori ti sembrerà una merda.""_ In un certo senso spero che sia così.

Objectively, the best way to break apart Russia would be to economically isolate it, isolate it really hardcore (i.e. entirely cut off trade). Then - and this is critical - bring the BRICS (well, China) on board. I'm not sure how that can be accomplished even theoretically - acquiescing to Chinese expansion into the South China Seat, though, instead of ""pivoting"" to East Asia, would be a good start. If the West and Japan let's China build its East Asian emporium in peace, without resistance, then China will not have any great need for a strategically secure north, as it does now. Blocked off on all sides and from the three major global economic centers (Europe, North America, and East Asia), the Russian economy will collapse and, I suppose, separatism will become a real issue again (assuming Russia doesn't emulate North Korea and totally clamp down).

That said, he was both. He embodied the continuation of the French Revolution, that had built on the Enlightenment, Reason and Humanism. His wars killed countless people, both military and civilian, across Europe. And though he initially sparked most of the conflicts, the other side was just as ruthless.

 His regime was oppressive to dissidents and ruthlessly conscripted to further the war effort, but it also secure a codified set of law that secured basic rights in pratice for most people (since we're in the 19th century, rights obviously meaning adult&lt;elderly males, but still). He also brought a civil service and works which highly effectivised the running of the state, thereby increasing the value of taxes paid. And it must be said that without his pseudo-revolutionary façade, zeal and puppet-states, autocratic monarchies might well have lived much longer in Europe. Prince Metternich was able to quell resistance after the Congress of Vienna, but ultimately the overwhelming tension that had been building up exploded in 1848 and the years following. Before becoming a despotic Emperor he was even hailed as a kind of messianic freedom fighter, by Beethoven notably, but also by most of Europe outside the UK, Austria and Spain (the entrenched catholic monarchies and the geopolitical rival). Still, his rule was no worse than that under the Bourbon monarchs, which doesn't say a lot other than making him at least not worse than those before him.

Personally, I think the reason Napoleon is so important in European history is the forced uprooting of antiquated ways of running a state (mostly, through brilliant strategic prowess). Without him the avalanche of nationalism and ideology that has shaped the world we live in now wouldn't have gained ground anywhere near as fast.

Where do you live in the US? Because this is not the case in most major cities. They often congregate when they first move to the US in cities and possibly spread out later. 

The exception being educated immigrants coming for work or to further their education. They're fairly spread out depending on where their work or school needs them to be. A good example is software engineers in Silicon Valley. 70% are immigrants with wildly different backgrounds. But I would venture to guess almost all of them knew English when they immigrated to the US, many even being educated in the US. Despite being many different races and ethnicities they integrate very quickly because of their situation. 

But that is not the case for all immigrants. You will find neighborhoods in most major cities filled with immigrants of common backgrounds.

Laughable.

Whether it's the TTIP or straight up attempted coups on Venezuela or Ecuador, or SWAT teams kicking in a New Zealand mans house for piracy.

I can't approve of Russias actions on Ukraine anymore than I can of Americas actions. However pretending America is benevolent and that intelligent russians wouldn't see through the thin veneer of bullshit when it comes to actions in S.America, overthrowing irans democracy when they nationalised oil supplies, arming Al Qaeda in Syria, dropping religious violent imagery on the Afghans in the 80s, invading vietnam, installing the genocidal dictator in Chile for nationalising land, causing a 36 year long civil war in guatemala, Guantanamo, Iraq, Afghanista and funding the Muhjadeen against the Russians in the 80's.

State minister János Lázár first accused the Hungarian branch of the Norwegian Civil Fund in April of giving an unfairly large share of their own funds in grants to an organization (also an NGO) that can be tied to LMP, the green party. The amount in question is around 70.000€ and was given to the NGO to execute a program to develop citizen's knowledge about democracy.

That's a big no-no for Fidesz, so they first attacked through media, pointing out some common personal history between the leaders of the NGO and some LMP party-members and calling them a ""useless group of partisan tricksters"". 

Then they sent their first official complaint to the Norwegian government and ask them to ""co-operate"" with them on deciding who should win what grants for the ""mutual satisfaction of all parties involved"". The Norwegian Civil Fund is a grant-based funding NGO of the Norwegian state we are talking about.

[This was flatly rejected by the Norwegian state through the national branch's channels](http://budapestbeacon.com/featured-articles/norwegian-civil-fund-administrators-to-janos-lazar-we-are-not-a-useless-group-of-partisan-tricksters/).

But Mr. Lázár isn't resting, the linked article is his second cry and the most recent development in the story. Basically Fidesz wants control over deciding who gets funded through this fund's channels. Why? Because they really don't realize this shit belongs to Orwell, not to the EU.

The Conservative party did everything they could to get the bill through. They will try again in the next Parliamentary sitting.

It is shameful that the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrat Party allowed this bill to pass through the elected house, but then defeated it in the unelected house. It is the unelected Labour and Liberal Democrat peers that are trying to deny the British people a referendum. They are the ones that blocked the bill.

You're proposing a proportional allocation given by a function of the population (the function itself having a tunable parameter which you call the ""main modifier"").  While I agree with this principle, I have two issues with details.

My first issue concerns the type of proportional allocation you chose, namely the [""highest remainder"" / Hare-Niemeyer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_remainder_method) method (with the Hare quota), probably because it superficially appears to be the simplest.  This is exactly (I mean, forgetting the tunable function for the moment) the ""Hamilton"" method that was used in the 19th century by the United States for allocating seats in the House of Representatives: what is wrong with it is that it causes the [Alabama paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_paradox) by which *increasing* the number of seats in the assembly, while keeping everything else the same (i.e., all the populations), can *decrease* the number of seats appointed to one of the states.  Because of this kind of problems, highest remainder proportional appointment should be avoided: they are not really simpler and they are mathematically quirky.

The [highest averages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_averages_method) method is better in every way (it avoids the ""Alabama paradox"" and is used, with various quotas and modifications, in proportional representations in various countries, such as Germany, France and Belgium, and in allocating the seats in the US House of Representatives since 1940).  What the highest averages does is appoint the seats in turn: at each turn, the seat to be appointed is allocated to the group (here: country) with the largest ratio weight/quota, where the weight is whatever function is being targeted for proportional representation (e.g., population, or some function of the population) and the quota depends on the number n of seats already allocated to that group (typical choices of quota are n+1, n+½ or √(n(n+1)) for reasons explained in the Wikipedia article — and also in [this blog post of mine](http://www.madore.org/~david/weblog/2009-06-09-elections-proportionnelle.html#d.2009-06-09.1649) if you can read French).  In this case, I would specifically suggest [highest averages with the Huntington-Hill quota](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%E2%80%93Hill_method) which is currently used for appointing the US House of Representatives.

My second issue concerns the weight function (population ↦ weight) which you chose, which is a simple linear function between population and a constant function (the average population of the EU countries, but it wouldn't significantly change things if you took the number 1 instead, it would only change the scale of what you call the ""main modifier"").  Now, up to rounding, adjusting the weights in this manner is simply equivalent two having two batches of MEPs: one allocated equally for each country and one allocated proportionally to population.  I'm not saying this is wrong, but if this is the goal, then it should be clearly stated as such, and the equivalent number of seats (which proportion is divided equally between all countries and which is divided proportionally to population) should be clearly stated: you are effectively allocating 2.6/(1+2.6) = 72% of the parliament proportionally to population, and the remaining 1/(1+2.6) = 28% equally between all countries.

What I would do instead is use a weight function which is a [*geometric* mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_geometric_mean) between population and a constant function, or, which is exactly equivalent, the population *to a certain power*, where the power in question is the tunable parameter (between 0 and 1): 0 means giving an equal share to each country, 1 means allocating proportionally to population, and ½ would be a kind of [Jagiellonian Compromise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagiellonian_Compromise), although the arguments used to argue for the Council do not apply to Parliament.  I agree with your idea that the tunable parameter should be set at whichever value causes the smallest total displacement of seats w.r.t. the present allocation in the EU parliament.",0,1399633445,null,0,false,0,chdjc2t,t3_2545mh,t1_chdjc2t,t3_2545mh,null,1433719724,38,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,38

And, while it varies greatly, most religions, no matter if they are mono or polytheistic, have at least one character that can be considered as good (like God, Odin, Brahma, Zeus...) and another that can be seen as evil (like Loki or the Devil), or at least a representative of death (like Osiris, Hades or Kali). 

Thus, as one of the main reasons that religion arised was the need of an explanation for death, and death has usually been considered as bad, the representative of death have progressively become the antagonist, the one with all of the vices or the source of evil.

Sure, there are exceptions, including the ones where there's only the good guy (like most forms of Buddhism), and even some where there's only the bad ones (like Mexica gods, who really liked their blood), but there's clearly a pattern, and the pattern is dualistic, even in religions like the Christianity that don't recognize divinity to the evil one.

The campus is in the middle of nowhere and even though there are a few things closer to campus, most of students live in the center, as it is a rather small and cheap city and you can rent a huge appartment in a good location for less than the cost of a room in Madrid. Most of students use [public transportation](http://sig.caceres.es/callejero/autobuses-urbanos/?lang=en) to get to the [campus](http://sig2.caceres.es/callejero/autobuses.asp?linea=LC).

I don't really know if there's a lot of people biking to campus. If you are a bike person, take into account that the town has higher altitutde than the campus, so the ride back home is very steep. Also consider that Cáceres is relatively hilly, especially if you come from a very flat place. But other than for going to the campus, the town is very walkable.

If you are on a exchange program, you definitely want to ask the university, they probably have some kind of service to help foreign students find accomodation. There are some [university dormitories](http://www.unex.es/organizacion/servicios/siaa/alojamiento/colegios-mayores-apartamentos-y-residencias-universitarias/caceres), but almost every student that I know rents an appartment with some other people. The most popular site for finding an apartment is [idealista.com](http://www.idealista.com/alquiler-viviendas/caceres-caceres/?ordenado-por=precio-asc). There are also sites for people looking for a room like [pisocompartido](http://www.pisocompartido.com/alquiler-habitaciones-caceres_y_entorno_caceres?tipo_alquiler=residencial&amp;select_provincia=caceres.P00000000000010&amp;select_municipio=caceres_y_entorno_caceres&amp;select_distrito=&amp;select_barrio=&amp;precio=&amp;ch_hab=1&amp;disp_desde=&amp;id_tipo_hab=&amp;id_duracion_min=&amp;id_duracion_max=&amp;id_tipo_hab_size=&amp;id_tipo_inm=&amp;hab_disponibles=&amp;banos=&amp;superficie=&amp;id_estado_inmueble=&amp;conviven=&amp;sexo=/) (idealista also has this function). Anyways, Cáceres is dirt cheap and you can afford your own place if that's what you want.

There is an airport in Badajoz, but it's 1 hour away and there is almost no flights. People just go to Madrid when they travel. In public transportation time, that's almost 5 hours from Madrid's airport to Cáceres (you need to get from the airport to a train or bus station and then endure a lovely 3.5 to 4 hour ride).

I hope this is not breaking news, but you are moving to a small town in the middle of nowhere. Cáceres used to be a very lively university town and it is rumored to be the birthplace of [botellón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botell%C3%B3n).

&gt;

&gt;__Botellón__ ([Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language) for ""big bottle"") is typically a nighttime Spanish activity when people congregate in public areas to socialize while drinking alcohol. The activity is popular among young teenagers and young adults partly in response to rising drink prices at bars or clubs, and partly because more people can meet in one place.  Botellón is not an alternative to typical nightlife, but is rather an economical way to drink with people before going out to bars, discos, or clubs.

true,almodozo,null,null,"Thank you, that first link was informative. I stand corrected: I thought that insurrectionism in Dagestan had been quashed, but that article provides some evidence that it is still forceful. 

I do find it lacking in detail - I wish there were some mentions of actual, specific armed attacks the Dagestani rebels were involved in. This seems to be the meat of the piece on that count:

&gt;Dagestan also has eclipsed Chechnya as the seat of the most violent insurgency against the Russian state. The Muslim insurgents of the Shari'ah Jamaat have divided Dagestan into four sectors.[10] Anti-state activities occur on a daily basis on Dagestani territory. Not all of the extremist activity by the radical Islamists is directed against symbols of Moscow's rule. The extremists have targeted their fellow Muslim leaders thought to be too mild in their opposition to continued occupation of the north Caucasus Republics by Russia. On July 1, 2012, for instance, Muslim terrorists assassinated Dagestan's most esteemed Sufi Sheikh, Said Afendi.
&gt;
&gt;Dagestani jihadists are increasingly crossing the republic's boundaries to assist in anti-regime operations in other nearby Muslim republics. They have assassinated many Moscow-appointed judicial figures who had been condemned as apostates for having ignored the demands of the Sharia law and for having chosen man's atheistic legal system over that of Allah.[11]

This is informative but somewhat frustratingly lacking in specifics. The only concrete case they identify is an assassination that took place almost two years ago.

Your second link is four years old, so I don't think that's very relevant anymore. But still, obviously Dagestani rebels are more active than I'd thought.

&gt;Just think about what would the Caucasus region look alike if the West started to pour money and resources for every and anyone fighting against Russia?

They'd be fools to do so, though. There was a time when there was a genuine, popularly supported, nationalist rather than Islamist, insurgency in Chechnya -- but that was 20 years ago. The remaining rebels now appear to overwhelmingly be Islamist radicals, with very limited popular support. I don't think the US is particularly eager to arm and fund violent Islamist radicals to fight the Russians again -- it didn't end up working so well in Afghanistan. That seems to be borne out in Syria, for example, where the US seems to have taken several steps back away from the Syrian rebels since the Islamist extremists became ascendant there. That's my take, anyway.

&gt; It is not acceptable that freedom of 42 million people in Ukraine can be sacrificed for an nation that has during its history tried to eradicate Ukrainian language and culture. Enough is enough

I understand this argument and share the sentiment. But as the Iraq war (and arguably the Afghanistan war as well) have showed, a passionate conviction is not enough to achieve military goals. You need a strategic objective and realistic methods to achieve it, which won't backfire on you in ways that will undo your initial efforts. The way you phrased it in your previous comment seemed more like it would be a matter of retaliation than one of achieving a specific strategic objective. If Putin ends up gobbling up a chunk of Ukraine (let alone all of Ukraine), what would arming Chechen radicals achieve?

Which begs the trick question, if that is true, how did USSR win the war? It didn't, alone.


Not one single country won the war alone, the only thing that did happen was that Nazi Germany lost the war, that is accurate.


The reason why Nazi Germany fell was an absolutely **joint effort**, any effort lacking from it and it can be strongly argued we'd have seen a Nazi dominated Europe instead.


People have some delusional ideas that the more soldiers that die the more they matter in the war, it's absolutely false, especially considering Stalin's and Hitler's not one step back policies.


The significance of destroying Nazi Germany was the multi-front war and draining its resources by disallowing it to act in any part with a focused effort, even the internal resistance in Europe posed a massive challenge to security and logistics.

Die AfD macht sogar populistische Politik damit und zieht massig Leute aus den entsprechenden Teilen der Gesellschaft an. Das ist das was man als ""Conspiracy Mainstream"" bezeichnen könnte. Ihr seid kein Stück besser aufgeklärt als die Leute über die du hier pauschal herziehst. Es ist sogar viel schlimmer: ihr habt euch eine alternative Wahrheit zugelegt und die wurde wasserfest gemacht in dem alles andere als Teil der Verschwörung aufgefasst wird. 

Das oben Beschriebene Beispiel (auf deren Kernpunkt du nicht eingegangen bist) zeigt es doch wunderbar.

Daher entscheidet man sich hier dafür Pauschal das ganze als Werkzeug der Eliten darzustellen welches die Massen verblödet. Die Gegendarstellung wird dann ignoriert, als Gegenpropaganda diffamiert oder tatsächlich nicht wahrgenommen.

Ni pourquoi certains font une fixation sur l'aspect ""blancs/noirs"" de la chose. Et encore aux USA je peux comprendre, vu le grand nombre de descendants des esclaves qu'il y a dans la population noire et les problèmes qui en ont découlé jusqu'à aujourd'hui. Il y a des gens vivant aujourd'hui dont les grands-parents étaient esclaves, et ces gens n'ont pas eu le droit de vote avant le milieu de leur vie...

Bref. Mais en tout cas pour moi c'est clair que c'est une question humaine et pas raciale. Il s'agit d'un groupe d'être humains ayant traité un autre groupe d'être humains comme de la propriété. C'est une question qui doit nous toucher tous et nous pousser non pas à la culpabilité (ce qui est assez évident vu que personne ici n'a normalement été propriétaire d'un esclave) mais à la vigilance et au respect des autres.

Je comprends bien que comme pour l'Holocauste il y a toujours des questions concernant les conséquences à long terme pour certaines populations, qui peuvent être récupérées par les uns et les autres, ce qui peut donner lieu à du réactivisme de plus ou moins bon aloi. Mais comme les commémoration de génocides de manière générale, il faudrait laisser ces questions de côté pendant un petit moment et simplement se poser pour contempler l'immense inhumanité dont on a fait preuve et dont on continue de faire preuves dans certains pays. Ca devrait être simplement une occasion d'ériger en haut de notre pyramide des valeurs le respect de l'être humain.

J'aurais peut-être compris si on commençait dans ce genre de commémoration à s'attaquer à des descendants des planteurs des DOM TOM ou à des familles particulières ayant hérité leur fortune de l'esclavage. Ces gens pourraient légitimement considérer qu'on n'a pas à les culpabiliser personnellement, on pourrait avoir une discussion raisonnable sur les questions d'héritages et de réparations. On pourrait évidemment aussi débattre sur les vols faits aux Juifs et les confiscations de terrains, et la nature même du droit à la propriété privée, qui peut être une question éminemment philosophique. Soit. Et là je ne douterait pas du bien fondé d'un discours politisé.

Mais il me semble que personne ne fait ça ni au moment des commémorations de l'esclavage, ni du génocide Rwandais, ni des commémorations de l'Holocauste. Donc franchement, c'est assez dommage.

Man darf nicht vergessen, daß Medizin eine Erfahrungswissenschaft ist, die sich u.a. naturwissenschaftlicher Methoden bedient, aber eben nicht ausschließlich. Da Gesundheit ein Zustand ist, der sich nach weitverbreiteter Meinung über Körper und Geist gleichermaßen definiert, sind auch rein auf die Psyche wirkende Therapien nicht als unwirksam anzusehen.

In dem Experiment des Journalisten ging es ja sogar ausschließlich um (vorgetäuschte) psychische Leiden, da er ja nicht etwa wegen Erektionsproblemen beim Urologen war, sondern wegen vermeintlicher Inkongruenzen zwischen seinem sexuellen Verlangen und seinen internalisierten gesellschaftlichen Normen. 

Man könnte also sagen, Es und Über-Ich waren bei ihm in einem Kampf. Er hatte sich selbst (vorgegebenermaßen) dafür entschieden das Es zu bekämpfen, nicht das Über-Ich. Bei diesem Bemühen wollten die Ärzte ihn unterstützen. Bei religiösen Personen - und als solche gab er sich anscheinend aus - ist ein Gebet ohne Zweifel eine wirksame Maßnahme. 

Mein Fazit: Es kommt bei der Erfahrungswissenschaft Medizin nicht darauf an, mit welcher Methode dem Patienten geholfen wird, sondern darauf, daß ihm geholfen wird.

Cependant pour moi c'est lié. L'inaction entraine l'inaction et l'action entraine l'action. 
Si je comprend bien tu as beaucoup de temps libre et tu n'en fait pas grand'chose ?
Je persiste à croire que travailler entrainerai un rythme, des rencontres, une meilleure estime de soi propice à rajouter des activités à cet emploi du temps. 
C'est un cercle vicieux. Mais ok tu as peut être raison il faut peut être casser le manque d'activités pour être mieux et ensuite trouver une activité pro. 
Comme ça je dirais sport, activités domestiques et auto-apprentissage. 
Pour le sport le plus simple c'est courir. Il suffit d'une paire de chaussures à 35€. Trouver un programme d'entrainement online et c'est parti. Les américains obèses en ont des très bien car très progressifs. Cf ""From couch to 5 Km"", mais un français de 28 ans doit probablement être bcp plus en forme.
Deuxio un sport que tu aimes : des millions de français aiment le foot, le basket ou le vélo. Cherche d'autres personnes avec qui taper dans le ballon j'en vois partout où il y a une grande pelouse le week-end. Pour le vélo leboncoin, une pompe a vélo et trouver d'autres pratiquants. En fait c'est la dimension sociale qui est clé quand tu est inactif alors la pétanque avec les petits vieux c'est aussi tout à fait recevable même si ça ne fait rien point de vue sport.
Quand je parle d'activité domestique c'est par exemple la cuisine. S'intéresser à la cuisine c'est très riche et même si tu fait ça chez toi ça t'incitera à aller au marché plutôt qu'au supermarché, où tu discutera avec les vendeurs, ce qui n'est pas possible en libre-service bien sûr. Et si tu saus faire une recette tu ceux en faire profiter les autres. 

Autre activité : l'auto formation, l'informatique est probablement le domaine par excellence où il y a des choses a apprendre, dans le développement ou en dehors, il faut savoir écarter les oeillères.

Sinon aller quotidiennement a la médiathèque lire une revue un journal en libre-service.
Ou donner des cours de soutien payants a des collégiens lycéens. Du dépannage informatique payant (au black pour demarrer) pour petits vieux perdus. De ""l'alphabétisation"" informatique bénévole via ta mairie. Ou une petite annonce chez le boulanger s'il n'y a pas d'assos identifiables. 

Bref je m'arrête là c'est très inconfortable de taper un texte long sur smartphone. 
Mais je reviens à ma tirade initiale : sans travail point de salut. Ne pas embrayer une activité rémunérée maintenant c'est te condamner à une sur-vie au RSA et dépendant de famille/copine. Une sous-vie où tu ne peux pas avoir un chez toi, aller au bord de la mer ou rêver d'aller un jour en vacances a San Francisco voir comment c'est.
Il y a suffisamment de gens handicapés mentaux ou physiques coincés en survie pour que quelqu'un qui ne l'est  pas ne fasse pas les efforts nécessaires pour mener une vue d'adulte. 

Et je pense que le boulot alimentaire chiant (fast food, central d'appel téléphonique) hyper facile à chopper est un bon moyen de viser plus haut, une première marche. 

Fait les vendanges cet automne ! Rien de mieux que d'avoir mal partout pour ne plus avoir bobo à la tête. 

Sans compter que des études ratées ça se reprend. Tu as une vision fermée ""l'école ça se fait de 5 ans à 25 ans après c'est impossible"" qui te sert d'excuse. Il y a 160 000 étudiants en alternance en France donc ne dit pas que c'est impossible. Dis je ne veux pas faire l'effort.

As for your first concern: It took me a while to understand the Alabama paradox, but I think I get it now. The remainder thing was the part I put in last, in order to ensure that the total amount of seats would always be exactly 751. You are most likely right in assuming that there are better ways of doing it.

As for your second concern, yes, you could make the whole system simpler. I used the ""main modifier"" to make it easy for me to test various scenarios. After finding that 2.6 was the best value (results closest to the current ""system""), I should have changed the formula accordingly. The reason why I used this system to begin with was because the EU is neither a cooperation between member-states, not a federation. So I thought it would be fitting if the seat allocation was somewhere between the extremes of giving every member-state the same amount of seats and giving each member-state a number of seats based on population.

I want to point out that I am not an expert. I don't think that I have found a magical solution to the problem, but I think it is important that the problem is discussed, because as long as there isn't _any_ system in place, the back-room deals will continue.

We did not systematically follow USA in all its actions and we even reserved the right to do actions that the US did not approve. Would the US president launch nukes if France was attacked?

What if you are in college in Connecticut for 9 months a years, and home with your parents in NY the other 3 months?  Which are you a resident of?  You can be a resident of CT, and a domiciliary of NY, because you intend to return to your parents after college.   You would be able to register to vote at either place, but not both.

But that is for voting.   So let's say you own a house in Florida that you stay at in the winter,  and you want to register you car there bc it is so much cheaper than NY.  But NY makes you register your car in NY if you live in NY for over 90 days.  So you might still be a Florida resident, but you would have to get NY license plates.

What I'm trying to say is every application can have a different definition of residency, and the distinction between residency and domicile is important.   Then there are federal determinations of this as well.

So if you move to a town and have a kid, the first thing you do is go to the town hall, and register your kid for school.   If you bought a house in that town, it gets recorded by the County Clerk, and you will get tax bills from that town.

All these things are public record,  which the federal government has access to.  99% of the time, it is cut and dry where someone resides.  But if you are dealing with wealthy people who have properties all over the place, it get complicated.   The government will look at the mosaic of information,  and determine where is your domicile or residence.  The context this comes up a lot in is taxes and child custody cases.

So, no, there is no federal central register of residency, but there is so many records out there that it is not a problem to find out where someone is, or there last know address. 

You also do provide the fed government your address by filing taxes and applying for benefits.  Young men are kept in a database by the Selective Service Act, in case of a military draft.

So  there are so many records, that the government knows where you are, since they have access to all this.  But there is no central database.   Any federal agency can ask state/fed agencies where you are.  Hell, for $20 you can search for your info online using  a private company,  which will list everywhere you ever lived.

true,SeveQStorm,HAMB,Hamburg,"&gt; Das Problem aus meiner Sicht ist, dass ihr nicht seht wie sehr ihr ein Teil des Problems seid. [...] Es ist sogar viel schlimmer: ihr habt euch eine alternative Wahrheit zugelegt und die wurde wasserfest gemacht in dem alles andere als Teil der Verschwörung aufgefasst wird. 

Frage: wer ist denn ""ihr""? ""Wir"" sind eine äußerst heterogene Gruppe und so heterogen sind auch die Weltbilder, die ""wir"" haben. Wir sind uns im Grunde nur an wenigen Stellen wirklich einig: 1. den eigenen Kopf zu benutzen (was zugegebenermaßen zu wenige von uns wirklich tun), 2. wir wollen in Frieden leben (d.h. keinen Einsatz von Militär auf europäischem Territorium, schon gar nicht in Deutschland), 3. wir wollen darauf aufmerksam machen, dass unser Geldsystem ein grundlegendes Problem hat bzw. ist. Ich stimme beispielsweise überhaupt nicht mit der Aussage überein, dass es sich um eine jüdische Weltverschwörung handelt. Aber ich sehe trotzdem, dass es auf der einen Seite Menschen mit sehr sehr viel Geld und damit Einfluss auf der Welt gibt und auf der anderen Seite sehr sehr viele Menschen, die in blindem Gehorsam und aus Angst alles tun, was die nächst höhere Unternehmenshierarchie verlangt, ohne nachzufragen. Das führt zumindest zur Existenz der Möglichkeit, dass es eine steuernde Elite gibt. Ich behaupte nicht, dass es sie gibt (und schon gar nicht, dass das irgendwas mit irgendeinem Glauben zu tun hat), aber ich schließe ihre Existenz auch nicht kategorisch aus. Der Nachweis fehlt noch. Doch auch der NSA-Spähangriff auf unsere Privatsphäre hat sich von einer reinen Verschwörungstheorie dank der Beweise des Herrn Snowden zur akzeptierten Wahrheit entwickelt. Niemand kann uns garantieren, dass das nicht auch mit der Verschwörungstheorie einer lenkenden Machtelite passiert, die die Massenmedien nutzt, um ihre Interessen zu erhalten. Den Eindruck kann man schon gewinnen. Dazu bedarf es keines kontroversen Ken Jebsen. Dafür reicht eine Frau Krone-Schmalz mit gutem Ruf. 

Gegen Pauschalisierung bist auch du nicht immun. Die ganzen, teilweise wirklich schrägen geistigen Auswüchse, die aus ""unseren"" Reihen kommen, kannst du genau so wenig pauschalisieren, wie ich die Massenmedien. Genau so wie du mir/uns vorwirfst, alle TV Konsumenten als dumm zu bezeichnen, bezeichnes du alle Montagsdemonstranten als krude Verschwörungstheoretiker. Wir sind jedoch genau so wenig alle verrückt wie Medienkonsumenten alle dumm sind. Viele von uns sind durchaus für Argumente offen. Doch selten kommt wirklich mal ein Argument, das nicht in herablassender Weise dargeboten und mit Anfeindungen gewürzt wird. Letzteres ist keine gute Basis für eine zielgerichtete Diskussion. Viele von ""euch"" sind Argumenten gegenüber  nämlich genau so wenig offen wie viele von ""uns"". Nur statt der Behauptung, das Argument sei Teil der Verschwörung kommt von ""eurer"" Seite meistens die Behauptung, das Argument sei Teil der Verschwörungstheorie. So unterschiedlich sind wir also nicht.

Klar, ich sehe auch, dass es unter uns absolute Spinner gibt (noch weit, weit durchgeknallter als Ken Jebsen). Die Frage, die ich mir aber stelle, ist folgende: was ist gefährlicher? Ein armer Irrer mit einer seltsam abgehobenen Verschwörungstheorie, die (bis zu ihrem Beweis) ohnehin keiner glaubt, der also in seinem eigenen Weltbild gefangen ist und ein bisschen herumpoltert? Oder auf der anderen Seite der massenhafte, völlig unkritische Konsum von Medien, deren Glaubwürdigkeit aufgrund von Reality-TV und Castingshows eigentlich gegen null geht? Medien, von denen selbst die eigenen Vertreter sagen, es ließe sich ausnahmslos alles scripten und nichts sei wichtiger als Quote (ergo, Unterhaltung, Boulevard ohne Wahrheitsanspruch oder gar Bildungsauftrag). 

Mein Fazit daraus ist: es ist vollkommen egal, woher man sich Informationen holt. Das einzig wichtige dabei ist, dass man sie nicht unhinterfragt glaubt, selbst nach stützenden Nachweisen sucht und auch für Gegenargumente offen ist. Das eigene Weltbild darf nicht in Stein gemeißelt sein. Egal ob es der medialen West/Ost/gut/böse-Doktrin entspricht, der Weltverschwörung-Machtelite nachhängt, an eine außerirdische Unterwanderung glaubt oder überall CIA-Agenten sieht. 

Ich für meinen Teil bin durchaus offen für echte Argumente und ich werde je nach Beweiskraft einen Teufel tun und behaupten, sie seien Teil der Verschwörung. So weit würde ich nicht gehen. 

Ja, einige von ""uns"" gehen so weit. Aber sie definieren nicht ""uns"". Ich kann an dieser Stelle sehr wohl sagen, dass die mediale Darstellung über uns falsch ist. Die heute-Show zum Beispiel instrumentalisierte einige wirklich bekloppte Elemente unserer Bewegung, um uns pauschal zu diskreditieren (ja, das hat auch Frau Ditfurth auf 3sat getan, wofür wir auch 3sat kritisiert haben). Die Darstellung beschäftigt sich in keinster Weise mit kritischen Elementen wie ich eines bin. Wir Skeptiker sind nicht dafür geeignet, um uns zu diskreditieren, deshalb tauchen wir im TV auch nicht auf. 

Warum ich als Skeptiker dennoch an der Bewegung festhalte? Newton: jede Kraft (zu recht von Frau Krone-Schmalz kritisierte einseitige Berichterstattung und Wortwahl in einigen Medien) erzeugt eine Gegenkraft (gesunde Skepsis). Ich gehe als Systemkritiker auf die Straße, weil ich der Ansicht bin, dass es keine Denkverbote bezüglich unseres Geldsystems, seiner Auswirkungen und möglicher besserer Alternativen geben darf. Und ich gehe auf die Straße, weil ich keinen Krieg in Europa will - unabhängig davon, wie wahrscheinlich oder unwahrscheinlich dieser auch immer sein mag und von wem er nun ausgelöst wird oder nicht.

true,U5K0,SLOV,Slovenia,"The Schuman Declaration:


&gt; World peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it.

&gt; The contribution which an organized and living Europe can bring to civilization is indispensable to the maintenance of peaceful relations. In taking upon herself for more than 20 years the role of champion of a united Europe, France has always had as her essential aim the service of peace. A united Europe was not achieved and we had war.

&gt; Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity. The coming together of the nations of Europe requires the elimination of the age-old opposition of France and Germany. Any action taken must in the first place concern these two countries.

&gt; With this aim in view, the French Government proposes that action be taken immediately on one limited but decisive point.

&gt; It proposes that Franco-German production of coal and steel as a whole be placed under a common High Authority, within the framework of an organization open to the participation of the other countries of Europe. The pooling of coal and steel production should immediately provide for the setting up of common foundations for economic development as a first step in the federation of Europe, and will change the destinies of those regions which have long been devoted to the manufacture of munitions of war, of which they have been the most constant victims.

&gt; The solidarity in production thus established will make it plain that any war between France and Germany becomes not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible. The setting up of this powerful productive unit, open to all countries willing to take part and bound ultimately to provide all the member countries with the basic elements of industrial production on the same terms, will lay a true foundation for their economic unification.

&gt; This production will be offered to the world as a whole without distinction or exception, with the aim of contributing to raising living standards and to promoting peaceful achievements. With increased resources Europe will be able to pursue the achievement of one of its essential tasks, namely, the development of the African continent. In this way, there will be realised simply and speedily that fusion of interest which is indispensable to the establishment of a common economic system; it may be the leaven from which may grow a wider and deeper community between countries long opposed to one another by sanguinary divisions.

&gt; By pooling basic production and by instituting a new High Authority, whose decisions will bind France, Germany and other member countries, this proposal will lead to the realization of the first concrete foundation of a European federation indispensable to the preservation of peace.

&gt; To promote the realization of the objectives defined, the French Government is ready to open negotiations on the following bases.

&gt; The task with which this common High Authority will be charged will be that of securing in the shortest possible time the modernization of production and the improvement of its quality; the supply of coal and steel on identical terms to the French and German markets, as well as to the markets of other member countries; the development in common of exports to other countries; the equalization and improvement of the living conditions of workers in these industries.

&gt; To achieve these objectives, starting from the very different conditions in which the production of member countries is at present situated, it is proposed that certain transitional measures should be instituted, such as the application of a production and investment plan, the establishment of compensating machinery for equating prices, and the creation of a restructuring fund to facilitate the rationalization of production. The movement of coal and steel between member countries will immediately be freed from all customs duty, and will not be affected by differential transport rates. Conditions will gradually be created which will spontaneously provide for the more rational distribution of production at the highest level of productivity.

&gt; In contrast to international cartels, which tend to impose restrictive practices on distribution and the exploitation of national markets, and to maintain high profits, the organization will ensure the fusion of markets and the expansion of production.

&gt; The essential principles and undertakings defined above will be the subject of a treaty signed between the States and submitted for the ratification of their parliaments. The negotiations required to settle details of applications will be undertaken with the help of an arbitrator appointed by common agreement. He will be entrusted with the task of seeing that the agreements reached conform with the principles laid down, and, in the event of a deadlock, he will decide what solution is to be adopted.

&gt; The common High Authority entrusted with the management of the scheme will be composed of independent persons appointed by the governments, giving equal representation. A chairman will be chosen by common agreement between the governments. The Authority's decisions will be enforceable in France, Germany and other member countries. Appropriate measures will be provided for means of appeal against the decisions of the Authority.

&gt; A representative of the United Nations will be accredited to the Authority, and will be instructed to make a public report to the United Nations twice yearly, giving an account of the working of the new organization, particularly as concerns the safeguarding of its objectives.

&gt; The institution of the High Authority will in no way prejudge the methods of ownership of enterprises. In the exercise of its functions, the common High Authority will take into account the powers conferred upon the International Ruhr Authority and the obligations of all kinds imposed upon Germany, so long as these remain in force.",0,1399642753,null,0,false,0,chdlvkc,t3_254awn,t1_chdlvkc,t3_254awn,null,1433720988,32,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,32

So Germany exhausted by a long war with Russia and holding enormous territory from France to Ural would loose a war to US-UK alliance regardless of USSR counterattack, only difference would be in war lasting much longer and possibly would include US dropping nuke(s) in Europe.

true,gamas,UKGB,United Kingdom,"There is an electoral register form sent to each house a year before an election to confirm who is living at the address, so that they can compile the tick-off list.

This type of registration is pretty much to reduce electoral fraud by preventing people from trying to vote in more than constituency/region in a general/european election (though people are entitled to vote in more than one local election, since, for example, students are allowed to be registered both at their home address and their university address).

EDIT: It's worth noting that the UK has the additional technicality that Irish and Commonwealth citizens are eligible to vote provided they are currently living in the UK (thanks to us never getting around to revising the Representation of the People Act 1918 to change the definition of a British subject).  This leads to the bizarre situation that Cypriots can vote for our government even though ordinarily an EU citizen couldn't.

It's very weird because we have a centralised electoral based that is compiled by the register form, but the entire polling system is decentralised.  So the local constituency gets its registration forms, which it then sends to central government who compile the full list, the local constituency then uses this full list to make its own local lists for the election.  Also there is no requirement to show ID on polling day, and you can opt to vote by proxy.

true,Aluhut,null,null,"&gt; Frage: wer ist denn ""ihr""? ""Wir"" sind eine äußerst heterogene Gruppe und so heterogen sind auch die Weltbilder, die ""wir"" haben.

Ist das so? Ich habe jetzt ungefähr an die 10 ""Ansprachen"" von Ken gehört. Auf der Straße, aus seiner ehemaligen Zeit beim RBB und von kenfm.de. Ich bin schon der Meinung, dass man schon recht einen gewissen Anteil an Schamlosigkeit mitbringen muss um sich dazu zu bekennen den zu hören. Sich dort mit diesen Leuten auch noch in der Öffentlichkeit blicken zu lassen ist da ein enormer Schritt. Man bekennt sich ja damit zu der ""Bewegung"". Es ist mir auch nicht wirklich klar wie an diesem Punkt noch eine ernsthafte Abgrenzung stattfinden soll. Vielleicht kannst du mir das ja mal erklären wie das funktioniert, dass die gleiche Quelle von Informationen richtig und falsch sein soll. Vor allem an solchen Punkten wie der Rothschild-Verschwörung. Ich finde das paradox und es sieht eher aus als würdest du versuchen diese ""böse"" Seite auszublenden was ja der ganzen Ideologie des angeblich so informierten (und somit besseren) Bürgers entgegen läuft. 

Hast du dich eigentlich mal gefragt warum bei diesen Auftritten eigentlich nie jemand von den Anwesenden aufschreit wenn Ken mal wieder komplett den Orbit verlässt? Wo ist den plötzlich dieser ""kritische Geist""? Wo ist der Mut zur Wahrheit? Warum habe ich dich nicht gehört wenn du doch angeblich für ""deine"" Überzeugungen auf die Straße gehst?

Da wundert ihr euch dann ernsthaft warum wir Aussenstehenden euch über einen Kamm scheren? Genau deswegen. Das ist der Grund warum ich ""ihr"" und nicht ""du"" sage.

&gt;  Viele von ""euch"" sind Argumenten gegenüber nämlich genau so wenig offen wie viele von ""uns"". Nur statt der Behauptung, das Argument sei Teil der Verschwörung kommt von ""eurer"" Seite meistens die Behauptung, das Argument sei Teil der Verschwörungstheorie. 

Das liegt daran, dass wir (wahlweise Schafe oder Elite) Teil der Verschwörung SIND. Ob wir es wollen oder nicht. Daraus resultiert ja einerseits eure Opferrolle und gleichzeitig eure erleuchtete Stellung ggü. den Schafen. Das meinte ich oben mit einem geschlossenem Weltbild die einer der Kernaspekte einer vernünftigen Verschwörungscommunity /-story ist. 

&gt; Der Nachweis fehlt noch. Doch auch der NSA-Spähangriff auf unsere Privatsphäre hat sich von einer reinen Verschwörungstheorie dank der Beweise des Herrn Snowden zur akzeptierten Wahrheit entwickelt. Niemand kann uns garantieren, dass das nicht auch mit der Verschwörungstheorie einer lenkenden Machtelite passiert, die die Massenmedien nutzt, um ihre Interessen zu erhalten

Das ist wieder so ein klassisches Logikmuster. Erstmal wird angenommen, dass Abhörtechniken der Geheimdienste **pure** Verschwörungstheorien waren um Verschwörungstheorien aufzuwerden um dann im zweiten Satz eine komplett davon unabhängige Verschwörungstheorie wahrscheinlicher aussehen zu lassen. Weil Verschwörungstheorien sind ja so aufgewertet.

Das ist meine Gladio Erklärung von oben am Beispiel aufgezeigt. Deswegen ist es auch so kritisch, dass ihr dort sitzt und diesem Prediger unkritisch zuhört wenn er von der zionistischen Weltverschwörung schwafelt. Warum soll das plötzlich nicht so sein wenn das eine doch stimmt. Er sagt doch anscheinend die Wahrheit.

&gt; was ist gefährlicher? Ein armer Irrer mit einer seltsam abgehobenen Verschwörungstheorie, die (bis zu ihrem Beweis) ohnehin keiner glaubt, der also in seinem eigenen Weltbild gefangen ist und ein bisschen herumpoltert? Oder auf der anderen Seite der massenhafte, völlig unkritische Konsum von Medien, deren Glaubwürdigkeit aufgrund von Reality-TV und Castingshows eigentlich gegen null geht? 

Ja was ist den gefährlicher? Wo **gefährden** dich den die Konsumenten in deinem Leben? Verrückte die Verschwörungstheorien und den daraus folgenden Ideologien nachgeeifert sind haben den Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts geprägt falls dir das nicht aufgefallen sein sollte. Es nennt sich Terrorismus bzw. das Marketing hinter dem ""Krieg gegen den Terror"" auf der anderen Seite. Also was ist jetzt nochmal gefährlicher?

These ""powerful"" officials either have a direct democratic mandate (council) or are selected by people with a direct democratic mandate (commission)

Laws need to go through proper legislation, which includes approval by people who were directly elected (in either of two scenarios). Any recommendations (aka ""edicts"") are not mandatory - governments can choose whatever to implement them or not. Eg. Cyprus government skips all of them (with few exceptions), British government seems to be just fine with many of them. You got what you elected.

    Je ne suis pas un communiste
    Je ne suis pas une cycliste
    Je ne suis pas une catholique
    Je ne suis pas une footbaliste
    
    Allez allez circulez
    Avec ton cue d'un pede
    J'aime les femmes
    J'aime les garçons
    Et comme j'ai déjà dit
    J'aime les zizis
    
    Putain putain c'est
    Vachement bien
    Nous sommes quand même
    Tous des Européens
    
    Ne korte dikke stoot alles in stukken
    Ne lange dunne doet deugd van binnen
    'k heb een kleintje maar
    'k schiet verre
    
    Il y a des gens qui parlent beaucoup
    mais ne disent rien du tout
    Il y a des gens qui crèvent de faim
    
    Putain putain c'est
    Vachement bien
    Nous sommes quand même
    Tous des Européens
    
    Jolie demoiselle
    Prend mes mains
    Le samedi soir tout le monde
    Prend du bain
    The rich may be rich
    The poor may be poor
    They all beat the shit off eachother
    
    Putain putain c'est
    Vachement bien
    Nous sommes quand même

    Putain putain c'est

First of all, the ""planned to conquer the world together with the fascists"" line is clearly mental, and has no place in serious historical discussion.

Secondly, the reason for the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact was the percieved selling out of their allies (Czechoslovakia and possibly Poland) by the Western Powers to avoid war with Germany or to push Germany to war against the Soviet Union.

And judging by the number of illegal immigrants trying to get into the UK stowed away in lorries from Sangatte rather than boats as in from Tunis to Lampedusa this is a genuine consideration.

And it doesn't much matter why are all these dudes are trying to get into the UK from France, the latter being hardly the worst place on earth, apparently.

The answer is they are.

But the UK and perhaps more so London, the most international of cities can only assimilate so many new arrivals at once and there's probably more than can be coped with already, so we need the control.

USSR had its own physical extermination of undesirables, through gulag and starvation at home, but when they invaded rampant rape, murder and mass executions were commonplace.

They often put the German camps they found to use directly, sometimes not even releasing the prisoners, even if they were their own, claiming they were traitors.


&gt; Despite becoming satelites state of the USSR, the soviets did not try to exterminate nor did they use the population of their satelite states as slave force somewhere in Siberia.


Politicians, officers and other open minded people all across the ""new enlarged"" USSR were imprisoned, tortured and eliminated methodically, this kind of absolute oppression continued for decades over all of eastern Europe.


&gt; Unlike nazis, they used their own for that purpose...

USSR was an equal opportunity killer, they were not limited to their own, foreign prisoners in the gulag system were extremely numerous with the invasion of eastern Europe.


Mass executions, rape and rampant mutilations, torture was commonplace, and **ethnic cleansing**, by the USSR, this in all the affected nations you so claim never suffered from such things.



http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_crimes


Just some minor excerpts of atrocities by the USSR.


Lithuania:

""Some 300,000 Lithuanians were deported or sentenced to prison camps on political grounds. It is estimated that Lithuania lost almost 780,000 citizens as a result of Soviet occupation, of which around 440,000 were war refugees.[32]""

Poland:

""During the years 1939–41, nearly 1.5 million inhabitants of the Soviet-controlled areas of former eastern Poland were deported, of whom 63.1% were Poles or other nationalities and 7.4% were Jews. Only a small number of these deportees survived the war.[40][need quotation to verify] According to American professor Carroll Quigley, at least one third of the 320,000 Polish prisoners of war captured by the Red Army in 1939 were murdered.[41]""

Estonia:


""More than 300,000 citizens of Estonia, almost a third of the population at the time, were affected by deportations, arrests, execution and other acts of repression.[24] As a result of the Soviet takeover, Estonia permanently lost at least 200,000 people or 20% of its population to repression, exodus and war.""


Germany:

""Human rights expert Alfred-Maurice de Zayas estimates that about 2.2 million Germans were killed by the Red Army in 1944–1945."" (Non combatants.)

""Following the Red Army's capture of Berlin in 1945, Soviet troops raped German women and girls as young as eight years old.[73] Estimates of the total number of victims range from tens of thousands to two million.[74]""



**These are only some of the ""War crimes"", other crimes not accounted for here, the list goes on...**

EDIT:

After the war:

Romania:

""In 1948, the state began to nationalize private firms and to collectivize agriculture the following year.[87] From 1947 to the early 1960s, the Communist government established a terror regime, carried out mainly through the Securitate (the Romanian secret police). During this period they launched several campaigns of purges in which numerous ""enemies of the state"" and ""parasite elements"" of the society were imprisoned for political or economic reasons, tortured and eventually killed.[88] Punishments included deportation, internal exile and internment in forced labour camps and prisons, sometimes for life; dissent was vigorously suppressed by the regime.[89]""

""According to Valentino, between 60,000 and 300,000 people may have been killed in Romania beginning in 1945 as part of agricultural collectivization and political repression.[135]""


Hungary:

""In the political conflict that followed an estimated 2,000 people were executed and over 100,000 were imprisoned. Approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals were purged from 1948 to 1956.[70] Many freethinkers and democrats were secretly arrested and taken to inland or foreign concentration camps without any judicial sentence. Some 600,000 Hungarians were deported to Soviet labour camps after the Second World War and at least 200,000 died in captivity.[71]""
