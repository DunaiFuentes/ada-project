These units have trained together and are on paper combat ready. (it should be noted that there indeed have been reports on lacking internal cooperation, but these reports stem from 2010 and the Swedish commander promised that the issue would be tackled)

As for the second part of your post

If the Crimea wants to secede that's great for them. They should be given the freedom to do so, provided this happens in a orderly democratic fashion. If Russia forcefully enters the Crimea with the intention to speed this progress along, its an act of war against the sovereign nation of Ukraine. International law will be blatantly ignored and the Russian Federation will (again) put itself above the UNSC and above the Nuremberg principles. 



While i agree that the prospect of European troops dying in some (with all due respect) Eastern European clusterfuck just blatantly sucks, we cannot let Russia just annex a part of another nation, a nation that the UK, your country , guaranteed the sovereignty of. Russia can't just be allowed to bully the former USSR around like its 1960. On a side note hampering Russia's control of the Black Sea and in extension the Mediterranean is in Europe's strategic interest. I think it is in Europe's best interest to no let Russia take the Crimea.  

Me responding to the second part of your post is just my opinion on the matter and it should not be seen as anything else. I respect that people see things very differently. Its a very complicated and delicate matter.

Power dynamics sono, appunto, le dinamiche di potere. Il modo in cui, nel BDSM, si gioca con il potere, dandone tutto a una persona apparentemente, mentre investigando più a fondo spesso il ""top"", chi comanda in pratica, lo fa per assenso di chi sta sotto, ed è praticamente al suo servizio. La cosa che mi colpisce di più è il senso di liberazione e di leggerezza che ricevi quando abbandoni ogni potere decisionale su te stesso; senza potere non hai preoccupazioni, l'obbedienza annulla il pensiero e ti permette di concentrarti sulle sensazioni. Temo sia lo stesso effetto inebriante che rende tanto facile incontrare la risposta ""seguivo solo gli ordini che ho ricevuto"".

FLR sta per Female-Led Relationship, relazioni dove il potere decisionale è esplicitamente nelle mani della donna. Non sarei in grado, ovviamente, di metterla in pratica perché è richiesto un grado di fiducia e di innamoramento per l'altra persona molto molto raro. 24/7 M/s è una relazione di dominante/sottomesso che non si limita a delle ""sessioni"" o a delle ""scene"", ma è continua. Molto più legata al BDSM rispetto alle FLR, che possono anche non aver alcuno elemento sessuale. 

Edit: vorrei aggiungere che alla base di tutte le cose di cui parlo sopra c'è la fiducia. Senza molta fiducia non si va da nessuna parte, perché nell'abbandono delle preoccupazioni è inclusa la certezza che chi ""comanda"" si prenda cura di te, non superi i tuoi limiti, sappia cosa sta facendo, eccetera.

This might sound kind of cynical or something but the idea is, in the USSR they didn't have a problem with homosexuals, but they had a problem with the LGBT movement. They thought it was made up by capitalists, like, the capitalists pretend they have more social equality (by alowing the LGBT movement) but in reality capitalism is flawed. 

You can see this as anti west propaganda, but on the other hand it kind of makes sense, people would be like ""in the US they have HOMELESS people down the street, and just because some upper middle class kid can freely say he's gay they go on and celebrate the SOCIAL JUSTICE being SERVED""

The thing is in Greece and Cyprus the 'authentic' leftist parties are still in the 80s sometimes and they haven't cleared up their stance, for fear it would be against the real Communist Party's doctrine. So they have this almost incoherent theory where being gay doesn't mean being gay it's a ""construct"".

The Pentagon has recently recommended significant cuts to the defense budget, so I would not be surprised to see the US become more selective with where it spends its money. Considering almost none of the NATO members are committed enough to it to meet their obligations, it seems the US may be starting to feel the same way.

But the emplyers are abusing this contract to hire people for a full time job since the minimum wagę doesnt takę into account people that do 'errands' they Can be paid close to no money for more work than a regular person would do, like working more than 8 hours/Day, the employer also pays way lower taxes than while hiring someone full time, the work time with 'errand contract' doesnt count towards retirement/retirement fund. The contract itself Can bear ridixiolous restrictions that May result im employee having to pqy the employer in the end of themonth instead of geting paid, since he was one minute late to work or left ten seconds early. The goverment adresses the problem of those contracts only When the elections are near, but never have There been a solution.",0,1393640653,null,0,false,0,cfrfwtf,t3_1z7fgm,t1_cfrfwtf,t1_cfragfd,null,1432607061,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

true,aldhelm,null,null,"Look at it from their perspective. Their candidate Yanukovich faced a large pro-EU demonstration for rigging the election in 2004. They assented and let the pro-EU guys run the country. Well those guys ran the country down and their guy Yanukovich won fair and square. In an election that the US and the EU considered to be fair.

Then the EU tried to make Ukraine make a choice, either make a move to join the EU or join the Eurasian thing. Yanukovich wanted Ukraine to join both and since he couldn't, he played both sides off to get the best deal for his country. The EU offered a small loan with very harsh austerity terms. Terms that would have meant a lot of poor Ukrainians would suffer. The Russians offered $15 billion. He choose the Russians and a Pro-EU protest from people who never voted for him happened. Later on he signs a deal to allow opposition members into his government, hand over power to the Parliament and have early elections.

What happens? the rioters weren't happy and toppled his government. They surrounded the Parliament and the remaining MPs who didn't flee kept popping bill after bill after bill, including releasing the criminal Tymoshenko who is so much worse than Yanukovich ever was. This is a woman who destroyed the previous pro-EU coalition and then signed a really shit deal with Russia all for power and money.

What makes it even worse was that the Western powers despite agreeing to the agreement that Yanukovich and the opposition signed, decided to recogonise this has legitimate. 

In this case Russia played by the rules and they got screwed. This is all the fault of the arrogance in the West. This would have never happened if they gave Yanukovich a better deal instead of trying to force his hand to accepting a shit deal. Would have never happened if the US wasn't interfering and encouraging the protestors.

The difference for us in the west and for Russia is the importance. Ukraine to us is just another chip on the board. For Russia it's a neighbouring country that shares with it a very deep and historic ties. It's vital for their national security.

So many things could have been done better to avoid this crisis. We should have given Ukraine a better deal, we shouldn't have encouraged the protestors to topple a democraticly elected government, we should have forced the opposition to back down when they toppled the government, we shouldn't have recognised the coup and call it a revolution. If we don't respect democratic instituions and interfere in other countries just to get the outcome we want. Why should Russia do so? 

This isn't the 90s anymore. NATO isn't all powerful. We are getting relatively weaker and weaker every year. In the future we will just be bit players. We should be strengthing respect for institutions and be more co-operative with other countries. The days where we can force other countries to accept whatever we want is dying a slow death. 

Look at the UK and France. We just to run the half the fucking world. Now we can only fight a war if America is helping us. We should really be more like Germany and just give up the stupid idea of being ""globally powerful"". It's a marathon we won't win.

After overcharging Ukraine for political reasons for years. In fact Ukraine was starting to import Russian gas from EU countries. That's how much Russia exploited Ukraine. The 15 billion were also completely conditional on Ukraine being at Putin's whim. Of course you mentioned none of that.

&gt;including releasing the criminal Tymoshenko who is so much worse than Yanukovich ever was. 

Yes so much worse. Except it was Putin who made the deal with her. The deal that she was pressured to sign because there was the threat of another gas cutoff from Russia. That's what she was imprisoned for. Also at least she didn't order protesters killed. But she is so much worse, we understand. Obvious propaganda is obvious.

The protestors didn't behead Yanukovich. He let people be killed, fled, and then his own party realised the situation was lost and bowed to the pressure. That's when the parliament sacked him, which is the right of the parliament btw.

He wants people to think he is in total control. If that were true, there would have been much less corruption around the Sochi games. Corruption complete with intermarriage between the politicians and the wealthy. I forgot which Putin in-law was married to which oligarch.

He is not an all powerful dictator. A real absolute dictator would have executed a bunch of people for corruption, probably on live TV, before the games, and that would have fixed a lot corruption. Instead like most dictators, Putin has a complex relationship with the wealthy in Russia. And that's why he can't get rid of most high level corruption by just shooting a bunch of people. He needs many of those people to help keep him in power.

And that's why the evens in Ukraine, especially the IMF loans which demanded legal changes to fight corruption, are such a vital threat to him **personally**. 

Yanukovych, private pirate ship and all, was obviously part of the corrupt politics and wealth club. That's **a lot** of income from Ukraine that club could lose. 

And if things in the Ukraine improve much like things in the Baltics have, it's going to be hard to ignore that. The Baltic nations are tiny, Putin can pretend they don't exist, or that due to their size they can't be compared to Russia.

But you can't do that with Ukraine. Imagine Ukraine, as poor and huge as it is, starting to improve in an attempt to join the EU. Fighting corruption, and growing wealthier. 

**That's a direct attack on Putin and Co.** Sure Putin wants a strong Russia. But he **primarily** wants himself to stay in power and in wealth. And needs his supporters to stay wealthy. And not just stay wealthy, but he needs to make sure they continue tobe able to steal as much money as possible. And stay out of jail while doing it. 

That's not possible if Russians start clamoring for anti-corruption reforms like in the Ukraine. 

That's why Yanukovych is demanding he's still the president. Obviously Russia wants to take back the Crimea. But Yanukovych's demand are not just to help make that happen. They are also the sad and desperate attempts by a totally corrupt system to maintain its grip on an important source of income.


That's also why I think crushing economic sanctions could be effective against that regime. Sure most of his allies have their money in Russia. But Russia just does not produce very much that's not energy. If the OCDE gets serious about cutting him and his allies out of international finances, the the long run that would start to seriously hurt.

true,toresbe,NORW,Norway,"&gt; Would you rather have a job or none at all??

I think that's a false dichotomy. I want a job and I want equitable compensation for the value I create for share-holders. 

As productivity has sky-rocketed, most of the increased value has gone to the capitalists; an important reason why the gulf between rich and poor is ever widening.

&gt; also norway has a crapton of oil so you guys are lucky as hell.

Yes, the oil was lucky, but that does suppress a lot of other activity that our economy would otherwise be involved in. We weren't exactly a developing country when we found oil, either.

Besides, the way we actually regulated the oil so that the proceeds would benefit the whole people was not luck, but political foresight.

&gt; Unemployment in norway hasn't gone above 5% for a long time. unlike most of europe where it has at since the GFC.

One of the most important slogans of the Norwegian Labour Party, which dominates the Norwegian political landscape, is ""Keep the whole people working"". There are a great many political concequences of that, and one is that we refuse to use unemployment as an economic tool; because the cost to the unemployed and to society in the long term is so much greater.

It's not as if we practice some dark art here; we've remembered the lessons of Keynes that say - when the private economy is slumping, one must use the public sector to compensate - because if unemployment starts to bite into the economy, it doesn't let go - sometimes for decades after the original liquidity problems were resolved.

The reason other European countries have not done this has been largely ideological. It's really all an excuse for right-wing politicians to do what they always wanted to do anyway; kill the social safety net so that the very wealthiest don't have to bother with having to pay to keep the plebiscite out of misery.

&gt; I honestly wished i had been born in norway because anytime you guys have a recession you guys can just dip into your oil wealth an come back the next year like nothing ever happened.

It's easier for us to use the petroleum fund than other forms of deficit spending, but it's not as if it's free money. That wealth fund backs our social security, so we cannot risk it.

It's exactly like deficit spending except at a lower interest rates.

&gt; tons of norwegians online have the ""recession??? what recession???"" smirk whenever theres a discussion about eurozone problems.

Yeah, a lot of Norwegians are obnoxious, and I'm sorry about that.

Let's say tomorrow the Northern Irish decided they didn't want to be British anymore. They hold it to a referendum, it passes, they join Ireland(Or remain independent, whatever). All is well and good.

Now, let's say tomorrow instead of that, that the Irish government orchestrated mass dissidence, armed and funded militants, and set an atmosphere of tension of potential violence. The Irish government then went to the British and said ""Hey, look, the Northern Irish are clearly sick of you, we're going to step in and deal with the problem before it gets out of hand and protect the ethnic Irish majority and impost the will of the people in reuniting them with their countrymen. Don't fuck with us, OK?"". This is what it happening, and that is not all well and good.

Prior to this intervention by Russia, the separatist movement in Crimea was not galvanized to this degree. Yes, they were an Autonomous Republic within Ukraine, and nobody really cared about it. They did what they did, as long as nobody messed with what they wanted they continued on with their day being autonomous and self-governing. There was always a strong tie to Russia but Crimea was never even near the point where there was a strong reunification movement with the Russian Federation.

&gt;

&gt;The **Toubon Law** (full name: law 94-665 of 4 August 1994 relating to usage of the French language), is a law of the French government mandating the use of the [French language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) in official government publications, in all advertisements, in all workplaces, in commercial contracts, in some other commercial communication contexts, in all government-financed schools, and some other contexts. 

&gt;The law does not concern private, non-commercial communications, such as non-commercial web publications by private bodies. It does not concern books, films, public speeches, and other forms of communications not constituting [commercial activity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce). However, the law mandates the use of the French language in all broadcast audiovisual programs, with exceptions for musical works and 'original version' films.  Broadcast musical works are subject to [quota](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quota_share) rules under a related law whereby a minimum percentage of the songs on radio and television must be in the French language. 

&gt;The law takes its common name from [Jacques Toubon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Toubon) who was [Minister of Culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Culture_(France\)) when it was passed and who proposed the law to the [National Assembly of France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_of_France). A nickname is Loi Allgood – ""Allgood"" is a [morpheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme)-for-morpheme translation of ""Toubon"" into [English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) (""All Good"" being a translation of ""Tout bon"") – as the law can largely be considered to have been enacted in reaction to the increasing usage of English in advertisements and other areas in France.

Most Americans don't want to get involved in another war.  In Libya we were dragged in by Britain and France, and the Republicans bitched that we didn't do enough to lead.  In Syria, the President was dragged into it by Syria's use of WMD's, global pressure and bad rhetoric by Kerry.  The Republicans then bitched that we were doing too much.  Basically whatever position Obama takes the Republicans oppose even if it contradicts themselves.  The general populace just wants the troops home so we can stop wasting money in far away lands.

Plus if we interfere its not like the world appreciates it, no matter what course we take we get bitched at for being big dumb spying warmongers.

If you look at modern history conventional armies where all but useless in defending their(smaller) countries, however almost all foreign invasions suffered more due to civil insurgencies and guerillas.

It doesn't sound to me like you people really know how important work and having a money flow truly is. Perhaps you guys have been supported financially by your parents your entire lives and thus think that you're entitled to some sort of work with amazing pay and not have your dignity shattered.

But unfortunately this is not how the real world works. Most of us don't have the privileges like you guys to be supported by our parents. Most of us have to actually work to get any sort of income. If I didn't have my minimum-wage job I'd have no income and I wouldn't be able to support myself or pay for my education. Because let's face it, to most of us people this world is cold and just waits to kick you to the curb at any chance it gets. So talking about ""wanting equitable compensation for the value I create for share-holders"" and ""a low wage job that validates a societal model where the worker is a modern slave and only a few reap the profits"" is just utter bullshit.

We're talking about YOUNG people here. Young people start at the bottom of the ladder and then work their way up. Yeah it sucks having minimum-wage and I'd sure love earning more money but for the time being, I can't afford not having a job. Not having a job equals dropping out of university because I won't be able to pay for the courses, it means I won't be able to pay my bills, it means no food on the table. And you're telling me I should give up all this because ""hurr durr I'm no capitalist slave""? That is beyond stupid. You do whatever you have to do to survive. And if that means having a minimum-wage job then that's just how it is.

And a job that gives you cancer? Seriously? If there is risk of getting cancer at your job and you don't have the proper protection given from your employer then you can get the authorities involved in that. There are laws to protect you from hazards in the workspace. Don't be silly.",0,1393665466,null,0,false,0,cfrmpf5,t3_1z7fgm,t1_cfrmpf5,t1_cfriluq,null,1432610336,-6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-6

If it just were this easy. Consider this: there is no comprehensive European military structure existing right now but now wouldn't be the first time some people called for it. The problem is that a majority of member states were always against creating it.

Remember how difficult it was for the 13 colonies to raise a proper force to battle the British, even with external aid *and a direct threat to your own security*. You had a few colonies and already people were at times more concerned with their 'nation' than a unified colonial government. And you didn't even have an entire history (*1000+ years*) of blood feuds, devastating wars between you and *a lot* of additional cultural and language diversity than in 1776. And this time, not even one of your member states is in imminent danger.

Can you imagine the clusterfuck of trying to get a unified European military, let alone a unified military response without one leviathan in an already established context (here: the US within NATO) telling them to?

&gt;Well they are big boys but they don't have the toys to back it up. 

I disagree with your analysis. Our share in military expenditure is, taken together, not as big as the US (of course), but more than enough to defend the EU if we had a unified military. The latter part is the real problem.

You are right that we cannot act. I just doubt you have the right reasons in mind. The response I gave above points out what I think the underlying problem is here: we have no political will or sufficient external threat in order to force each member state to essentially give up their autonomous military service. On the other hand, no single member state is strong enough to project power in all of Europe.

This creates a horrible dilemma, especially since the existence of the US and US intervention makes any solution redundant. But I believe this isn't about money, rather about how we use it. Right now, each member state spends it on its own military, hence you get 28 different militaries that cannot act in unison, each strong enough to protect its own nation but nothing much else.

The same money would buy you a force that would be the 2nd strongest on this planet. For reasons mentioned above, this isn't happening. If Russia continues to strong-arm its neighbour, we might finally get some real world motivation.

&gt;Every time I get some Europhile saying how civilized the continent is[..]

Do you even realise how crazy this is to a European? The last time there was so much peace in and between so many European countries for so long was under the Roman Empire, nearly 2000 years ago (and the 19th century doesn't count because, for example, Prussia-Austria vs. Denmark, ""Germany"" vs. France). So you have to excuse a few of us to make the mistake of projecting this to areas of the world that aren't as lucky as we are.

It gives legitimacy. These men haven't ""taken"" the government, they appear to be in effect protecting it. 

&gt; Kidnapping representatives is the only way to achieve the sort of results expected from that sort of maneuver.

I don't see why anyone needs to be kidnapped. Right now, the Crimean government is working as usual and [gradually preparing their secession.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26397323) All of this demonstrates that the process is a calm political decision and will give strong legitimacy to an independent Crimea.

&gt; The first thing should be to prevent contrary opinion from being propagated, which is what people think taking control of government building would do. 

This isn't about contrary opinion. The secession already has strong public support in the one region that matters, Crimea itself. What the rest of the world thinks is pretty much irrelevant. By allowing free communication during the opening stages you demonstrate the world that your peaceful takeover/secession isn't just staged PR but actual fact. And it has nothing to do with taking control of government buildings either, since that is for entirely different reasons explained above.

They totally played by the rule. Of couuurse. And yanoukovitch is totally not a russian-friendly overlord and was totally a pauper totally not corrupt.

Well, let's have a look at the house of an average pro-russian politician in Yanoukovitch's party working for him :

So, tell me, btw, how did that country went bankrupt ? But i'm suuuure it's the EU who told Yanoukovitch&amp; company to steal like 25% of the gov's budget.

Don't make me post pictures of the inside of his boat or mansion especially. It reminded me of an Versailles at the height of Louis XIV reign; i've never seen so much wealth wasted on baubles in my entire life before.

We're out of Cold War period for quite a while. What decides about power in modern world is economy.

In general mainland Europe doesn't go for that sort of thing. It breaches both involvement in internal affairs and shyness of outright populism. Giving speeches to the public of another country is, even to me, somewhat strange.

true,keepthepace,ZZZZZZhacker,Hacker,"Peut-être que la première bonne chose à faire ce serait d'écouter ceux qui disent depuis des années qu'en effet, vous êtes des abrutis à faire confiance à des technos qui sont optimisées pour la surveillance de masse. 

Le grand public semble le découvrir, mais ça fait des années si ce n'est des décennies que les experts en sécurité **crient** que vous bradez votre vie privée.

Oui, je suis aigri. Des années à me balader entre le parti pirate, l'open source, les hackerspace et à constater l'indifférence du grand public sur ces problèmes de sécurité nationale et de droits de l'homme ont eu cet effet, alors désolé, et bienvenue quand même, mais tu prendras un peu pour les autres :-)

&gt; Alors, qu'est ce qu'on fait? C'est foutu? La vie privée n'existe plus? 

Déjà, non. La NSA n'est pas Dieu, Google n'est pas surpuissant. A moins que l'affaire Snowden soit une opération d'intox des US (ce que je n'exclue franchement pas, vu l'inutilité de ses révélations) elle montre que la NSA a un amateurisme assez incroyable. Donc tout ce qui est possible, ils l'ont tenté mais ils ne l'ont pas forcément réussi.

Google a énormément d'infos mais, pour l'instant, agit d'une façon plutôt éthique, car ils savent que leur valeur tient énormément à leur réputation. Je peux me tromper, mais je pense que tant que Serge Brin pourra peser dans les décisions de Google, c'est une entreprise qui restera un minimum éthique. Quand il sera parti, c'est une autre histoire, mais ça nous laisse quelques années.

&gt; Sur quel(s) terrains faut il mener un combat, et cela en vaut il la peine? Quels sont les solutions alternatives?

Il y a typiquement deux réponses, deux terrains. Le terrain technique, et le terrain politique. Personnellement je les pense complémentaires, je ne pense pas qu'on puisse gagner avec un seul de ces deux tableaux. 

Techniquement, aujourd'hui, les défenseurs de la vie privée sont au point. Pour les choses essentielles, comme échanger des infos ou des fichiers, aller lire des articles ou même des vidéos sur le net de façon anonyme, les solutions existent, on connait leurs risques et leurs possibilités, les outils sont assez bons et gratuits. Et, bonus: ils sont encore légaux.

Ce qui nous amène au deuxième terrain. Politiquement, on pourrait tout à fait voire les solutions techniques devenir illégales. Il n'y a encore pas si longtemps il fallait une autorisation de la DGA pour utiliser des algos de crypto solides. HADOPI criminalise (en théorie) les passerelles TOR. La Chine a montré que même quand des solutions techniques existent, on peut leur faire la guerre.

A mon sens, la solution passe par une approche double:

- Techniquement, l'utilisation, dés que c'est possible, de techniques qui rendent très difficiles voire impossibles la censure et l'espionnage.

- Politiquement, la transparence à tous les étages sauf excellente raison et un appui (au lieu de la méfiance actuelle) envers les technos sus-mentionnées.

Il n'y a pas à se demander si il vaut mieux rendre l'espionnage des citoyens illégal ou techniquement difficile. Il faut faire les deux. La loi doit l'interdire et violer la loi doit être dur. 

Si tu n'es pas sur de quoi faire techniquement, va au hackerspace le plus proche de chez toi, et ils devraient te donner des pistes:
http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/France

Si tu n'es pas sur de quoi faire politiquement, rejoins un groupe politique qui considère ça important. A une époque j'aurais recommandé le parti pirate, mais aujourd'hui je n'en suis plus si sur. Dans le doute, la Quadrature du Net est un lobby citoyen qui fait un excellent travail en France et en Europe. Aux US, l'EFF a également un rôle très positif.

Here's what will go down if Scotland votes yes (which I still strongly doubt): The EU will tell Scotland that it will have to apply as a new country, but it will probably be able to make the negotiations during the period between the referendum and actual independence. This will require a unanimous vote in the Council, but it's not in anyone's interest for anyone to veto it.

When Scotland becomes independent, they will simultaneously join the EU, but will have no opt-outs, as they are a ""new country"". Scotland's place in the single market will remain unchanged.

In terms of borders, the UK will try and fail to get a Schengen Opt-out for Scotland. Instead, Scotland will be obligated join the Schengen Area, and both the UK and Ireland will join simultaneously to maintain their open borders, thereby making membership eventually universal to the EU.

I would still argue that there is, from our ""Western democratic"" perspective a difference between moral, financial and media support (what the West did) and covert military intervention (what Russia might do), but I already know your answer, I think:  I only think it's a different thing because I apply our own standards (Western ones). And you'd be right in that response.

In the end however, I think nobody ever found a conclusive answer for that question: if you believe your own value system is superior to others, you are indistinguishable in that belief from those who hold incredibly callous believes (I'm pretty sure North Korean leadership is quite convinced that what they're doing is the right thing). 

The alternative is moral relativism. You accept that your view is equally valid or false as those of others, but the result is you can never really vehemently defend (let alone project) your system of values on others.

In the end, I lean toward the former approach then: I *don't* want to follow moral relativism, I *do* believe that the ""West"" (that amorphous mass) is somewhat justified in saying that our political institutions are better for a large number of people than those of Russia, and that we *are* justified in saying that moral/financial/media support is a different class of action than military intervention. So in that sense, we *do* have a right to apply double standards, as you would call it.

&gt;

&gt;Determination of the **fastest rail vehicle in the world** varies depending on the definition of ""[rail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_tracks)"".

&gt;The world record for conventional wheeled trains is held by a specially tuned [TGV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV) (Train à Grande Vitesse), reduced to three cars with higher voltage and larger wheels, broke [the world record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Pieczak) in April 2007, reaching 574.8 km/h (357.2 mph). 

&gt;The world record for non-conventional trains is held by the experimental Japanese [SCMaglev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCMaglev), having achieved 581 km/h (361 mph) on a [magnetic-levitation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_levitation) track.

Die abgebildete Werbung befindet sich auf Seite 11.

Soweit ich das beurteilen kann, handelt es sich nicht um “Mädchen-Ü-Eier”, sondern um Aufschriften auf den normalen Ü-Eiern. Ob es noch weitere Aufschriften gibt, ist mir nicht bekannt. Ob der Inhalt sich unterscheidet, weiß ich auch nicht. Ich bin mir auch nicht sicher, ob hinter der Weltmeister-Spielerfrau Unterscheidung gezielt nach weiblich und männlich unterschieden werden soll, da das Ei mit der Weltmeisteraufschrift keine männlichen Merkmale aufweist. Wenn man von der in der Gesellschaft stark verbreiteten Dichotomie Frau/Mann ausgeht, liegt es nahe. Ich rege mich vor allem über den Ausdruck ‘Spielerfrau’ auf.""

[Youth unemployment rate:](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Glossary:Youth_unemployment_rate) Youth unemployment rate is the percentage of the unemployed in the age group 15 to 24 years old compared to the total labour force (both employed and unemployed) in that age group. However, it should be remembered that a large share of people between these ages are outside the labour market (since many youths are studying full time and thus are not available for work), which explains why youth unemployment rates are generally higher than overall unemployment rates, or those of other age groups.

[Labour force](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Glossary:Labour_force): The labour force or workforce or economically active population, also shortened to active population, includes both employed and unemployed people, but not the economically inactive, such as pre-school children, school children, students and pensioners.

The matter of the fact is that Russia is most aggressive when oil prices are high (last time they were this high was in 2008, when Russia attacked Georgia) and fuel vast military spending. The EU can contain that aggressiveness by restricting oil and gas imports to give [a kick to Russia's economy](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/business/global/vladimir-putins-big-promises-need-fueling-by-high-oil-prices.html), but the EU has proven to be absolutely impotent in using its most potent weapon for containing Russia and protecting values it claims to stand for.

Nicht zu vergessen: Die Euroangst. 

Funzt doch wunderbar. Wo ist das Problem? 

Der Vorteil der neuen Ängste ist für die Rechten doch, daß sie nicht mehr nach Draußen gehen müssen und sich den Linken stellen müssen. Es reicht vor dem PC zu hocken, bei PI-News zu kommentieren und Petitionen zu unterschreiben. Oder eben einer Partei nach der anderen beizutreten. 

Das ist auch ein Vorteil für uns. Die gehen nich raus, machen nix kaputt und schämen sich meist auch noch dermaßen ihrer Meinung, daß selbst ihre besten Freunde und Familienmitglieder nichts von ihren Überzeugungen wissen. 

&gt; Plötzlich ist jeder, der auch nur im geringsten Kritik äußert, ein Nazi im Schlips. Schwups, Deckel zu!

Ja Extremisten gibt es halt auf allen Seiten. Dennoch sollte man auch hier nicht generalisieren. Die Islamophoben sind ja auch der Meinung, daß sie nur Islamkritiker sind z.B.

&gt; Die Bundesrepublik Deutschland zählt trotz all seiner Fehler und seinem Optimierungsbedarf zu den tolerantesten und humansten Ländern der Welt. 

Das finde ich auch. Ich finde die obige Entwicklung auch sehr gut. Auch wenn die AfD jetzt einen Hauch von Relevanz in einem irrelevanten Gremium bekommt, glaube ich nicht, daß sie es schaffen in Deutschland relevant zu werden. Selbst wenn, wäre es nur eine Frage der Zeit bis die Ausfälle der Stammtischrassisten die einen Großteil der Wähler darstellen ans Tageslicht kommen und die Partei genauso versenken wie die Freiheit oder die ganzen PRO-Parteien davor. 

&gt; Wenn sich diese türkischen Rechtsextremisten mitten in Deutschland zu Tausenden versammeln, stört sich die Öffentlichkeit kaum daran. Wieso? Die Grauen Wölfe attackieren hier vor unseren Augen Kurden, Aleviten und Homosexuelle und es geht kein Aufschrei durch die Bevölkerung

Wahrscheinlich weil wir das nicht sehen? Ich hab noch nie irgendwo gesehen, daß die Grauen Wölfe irgendwo durch die Stadt marschiert wären. Ich habe auch nicht nicht gesehen, daß die irgendjemand gejagt und verprügelt hätten. Hätte ich das gesehen, würde ich die Polizei rufen. Egal in welchem Verein die sind. 

Ich sehe das so, daß überall wo sich extreme Gruppen bilden die ein Problem darstellen, sich auch Gegengruppen bilden die versuchen diese Gruppen daran zu hindern. Daran ist ja die Antifa gewachsen. Jetzt mag es sein, daß die gelangweilt werden weil ihnen die Kunden ausgehen aber ich verstehe nicht was die Autorin jetzt verlangt. Sollen wir die jetzt auf Anti-Wolf umschulen? Warum gibt es keine Anti-Wolf unter den Türken? Ich weiss es nicht. Es wäre vielleicht interessant gewesen darüber zu schreiben wenn man sich schon an ""die Deutschen"" richtet.

&gt; Geschweige denn durch die Politik, die diese Bewegung ja eher noch unterstützt.

Ich glaube kaum, daß ""die Politik"" das Jagen von Homosexuellen unterstützt. Die werden es wahrscheinlich genauso gut verstehen ihre legalen Tätigkeiten zu schützen wie die Rechten. Oder vielleicht sogar noch besser. Keine Ahnung. Aber das eine gegen das andere aufzuwiegen finde ich irgendwie nicht ziel führend. 

&gt; Wieso verfallen die Deutschen immer nur bei sich selbst reflexartig in Selbstkasteiung, aber dulden nicht-deutschen Rassismus hierzulande gegen Minderheiten, ja sogar gegen die Mehrheitsgesellschaft?

Ja das Argument kenne ich auch schon von den Rechten gepaart mit der Unterstellung im zweiten Teil des Satzes. 
Ist natürlich genauso dumm wie kontraproduktiv. Wie ich schon oben sagte: würde ich etwas kriminelles sehen, würde ich es auch beanstanden. Unabhängig davon welche Hautfarbe oder Religion der Täter hat. Ich bin mir auch ziemlich sicher, daß das für die meisten der Bürger hier zutrifft. Das zeichnet ja eine von Vorurteilen befreite Gesellschaft aus.

Es ist natürlich praktisch, daß nach all den witzigen Provokationen und der Gegenüberstellung hier auch kein Lösungsansatz kommt. Nur die übliche Rechtfertigungsklausel im letzten Absatz. 

Also was sollte das alles? Was sollen wir den jetzt Ihrer Meinung nach tun Frau Cileli?

The activities and ownership structure of many of these financial vehicles is non-transparent. According to an expert from Trinity College, the IFSC is like a “black box” with nobody knowing what’s going on inside and when it will blow the lid. With more than 40% of the World’s hedge funds managed through Dublin, Ireland has become the global leader in this business. The government has rolled out the red carpet for hedge fund manager with flexible regulation and low taxes. Even though the fund managers may have their base in London or New York and the actual funds may be in a tax haven, the “back office”, which handles important tasks such as portfolio evaluations, is often in Dublin.

That's the way I see it at the moment. Obama hasn't said anything specific because he doesn't know if he has any avenues open to him. 

*However* that doesn't mean that no avenues will become open to him or the EU governments. Personally I'm doubtful that all of NATO will agree to act simply because this kind of action is not *officially* one of their competencies (it's primarily a defence organisation, not a foreign adventurers organisation) and the large number of NATO members means it is difficult to get any sort of consensus out of them. But on the other hand there are many economic avenues that the world's two largest economies (EU #1 and USA #2) could very easily pursue against Russia and Ukraine, should that become necessary. There's also the possibility of the USA and a couple of other smaller partners like the UK and France acting unilaterally (bilaterally?) in Ukraine and Russia. 

TL;DR Obama doesn't know if he'll be able to take any kind of action whatsoever but I'd be very surprised if action didn't become available to him and EU governments. ",0,1393692409,null,0,false,0,cfrs219,t3_1z9mmg,t1_cfrs219,t1_cfrreve,null,1432612860,9,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,9

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"So long as nobody steps food in each other's sovereign territory or outside of Ukraine then there should be no need for a larger conflict or for nuclear force to be deployed. (That said, the possibility of escalation is quite severe and should there be Western military intervention in Ukraine [I would certainly up the DEFCON to about 2 or 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFCON)). 
 
I think the ideal situation where Western troops are put in Ukraine, whilst Russian Federation troops are also in Ukraine (exclusive Crimea) is that Western forces support most of the country, including the Russian speaking East but do not set foot on Crimea and make a declaration to the Russian Federation that should Ukraine's territory be compromised further (ie, Russian troops advancing passed the Crimea) that it would initiative a hot conflict. 

Both sides are too intelligent to actually get into such a direct proxy war. It'll only end up with decimation of Russian troops and more casualties on the West's side than would be appreciated. Cuba c.1960 is a good example of both sides being intelligent enough not to escalate these hugely dangerous conflicts too far (they came damn close, but no matter how many times you replay that scenario they would never have done it). It's in neither side's interests to actually start such an intense war which is why a war won't happen. The two problems here are A) that it's a huge game of brinkmanship which could go horribly wrong (probably not nuclear war or escalation outside of Ukraine bad, but still bad) and B) that the Russian Federation gets Crimea, but personally I don't see that as such a bad thing if you believe in self-determination.",0,1393693253,null,0,false,0,cfrsd6l,t3_1z9mmg,t1_cfrsd6l,t1_cfrr3l4,null,1432612996,5,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,5

Half of my grandparents are from the east, and were very pro-Russian, the other half is from west, and was pro-Ukrainian. (If i go a bit further back, most of my family is from other parts of Europe like France, Hungary ect. This is great-great-grandparent stuff. Long forgotten, but i use that as a basis to call myself European) The developments in Ukraine wont mean much for most people in the west, and theres a good reason for that. Il get to it at the end.

When Ukraine got its independence, most people there were very pro-Ukrainian, though a lot of people all over the country regretted the collapse of the Soviet Union. There was no division like there is today. When my parents were growing up, they never had any desire to move outside, and never thought it would happen. Due to economic difficulties, they decided to move to the US, make some money over a year or 2, and come back.

What they discovered was a whole new world. They had no idea of the difference in quality of life. They saw the pictures, they heard the stories, but they never believed it until they got there. Their 2 year stay turned into a 10 year stay, and once they came back to Ukraine, they began to raise my and my sister a very ""western"" way, and immediately started making plans to move out of the country. They didnt win a green card, so they moved to Canada instead. Both were Engineers, so it wasnt to hard.

Salaries in Ukraine are fairly low, so we help out our relatives who still live in Ukraine. We also keep in touch, and talk about various developments. Vast majority of the people in western Ukraine are just like my family. They have relatives in EU or North America, and get financial assistance. These people dont rely on the government for anything, thats why they are free to riot. Government cant do anything to them. These people also understand that their country is in essence a failure. They know how a developed country should look, and what they have isnt it. They are rioting because they want a proper government which will modernise their country, so they can be on the same level as France or Germany for example.

People in the east and south generally dont understand that there is a whole other world. They genuinely believe that what they have is the same everywhere. They dont understand how corrupt and screwed up their country is. They had better lives during the Soviet Era, and they see Russia as its successor. They want to go back to a better state, and Russia is the only better they know.

Now i personally am 0% nationalistic, and i look at things neutrally. I call myself European, since thats what historically i am. Calling myself Ukrainian or Russian is a bit embaracing on my opinion, due to both countries being a complete mess. That was a bit long, hope you got what you were looking for.

But, yes, if there aren't any translators/they're not practical in a given situation the minority should definitely know/try to know the country's majority language or at least try if they're not good with languages (thus the part where I said they should study both in school).

But the thing is, not everyone is good with languages and some people no matter how hard they try can't learn another language, and that's why those people should have their language as official too, or at least have government funded translators which is honestly the same thing except it's cheaper to have translations done once (i.e. make the minority language official, paperwork and everything) than to have to manually translate/use a translator each and every time someone doesn't know it well. And for what? Just so you could say there's only one official language? You lose money that way and it's not practical. And you can't always make it oral only, sometimes you're gonna have to send a paper or something else in written form to a small village with no translators. What then?

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"Well personally I talk about whether or not a town of 1,000 people could be a viable state which it couldn't be. This is why the hypothetical you've put forward sounds ridiculous, because it's completely unviable for a legitimate state of only 1,000 people to separate from the United Kingdom. 

In these kind of situation, ideally, you'd end up with something like the UK's overseas territories (e.g. Falklands, Gibraltar) or maybe its crown dependencies (e.g. Jersey, Guernsey). 

[I should probably point out some kind of real world example, at this point, to show how this idea is actually very feasible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar). Gibraltar is virtually in the exact same position as some break away region of the UK which is administered by Romania would be. Only it's administered by the UK and is vaguely compromising Spain's territorial integrity. 

**This whole issue of the 1,000 Romanians asside**, does the Crimea have territorial integrity of its own? Well I would argue that it does because, at 2 million people, it has a larger population than many other independent countries like Luxembourg, Estonia, Qatar, Slovenia, Montenegro, Bahrain and so on. It also has a large surface area at 26,000 KM^2 which is as large as Haiti, Rwanda and larger than Israel, Fiji, Swaziland and Kuwait. I have no figures on the economic size of the Crimea, but I would be surprised if (given its population of 2,000 and the size of the Ukrainian economy) the economy of Crimea was not up to the same economic standards as other nation states.

In conclusion, there is a clear distinction between the Crimea and 1,000 Romanians in the UK and if there was such a village it should probably be an overseas territory of either the UK or Romania. As for Crimea, it has all the qualities that a nation state requires. distinct cultural identity, Democratic legitimacy, population, economy and land area.

Per ogni scontrino consegnato al cliente una copia dello stesso viene conservata dal negoziante. A fine giornata il negoziante fa ""chiusura di cassa"" e stampa uno scontrino globale riassuntivo. Questo scontrinone è equivalente ad una fattura e va registrato nei corrispettivi dell'esercizio.

Gli scontrini devono essere conservati dal negoziante per un fottilione di anni in caso di verifiche fiscali.

L'obbligo di emissione al cliente e lo spauracchio del verbalone servono ad evitare l'evasione e rendere possibili i controlli ""al volo"". In teoria. In pratica è un sistema farraginoso di merda che procura incubi al negoziante ed orgasmi a raffica alle ditte che fanno revisione e manutenzione dei registratori.

The situation in Donetsk was very calm, although there are people who are afraid of ""banderivtsi"" from western Ukraine, it's like a stereotype here that westerners are militant. But very few were actually harmed by these ""banderivtsi"".

Meetings we had until now were anemic and organized by local government, however today we had a meeting which was more agitated: it was organized by local government, but then pro-Russian separatists took over and they were actually against local government.

So it looks really weird and unusual. There are speculations that these meetings were organized with help of Russia. However, local government have chosen to support them and are asking for referendum.

We do have people with pro-Russian views here, but there are relatively tame, few of them actually want to do something (and few of them realize that joining Russian won't go smooth even in the best case). Also we have a lot of people who are pro-autonomy/federation: as I mentioned, they are very suspicious of western Ukrainians and want more autonomy, but they also not big fans of Russia, knowing Putin and his policies. 

Finally, there are pro-EU people here too, mostly among young people.

As you can guess, my presence in /r/europe might indicate that I'm, personally, pro-EU, that's true. But that's atypical.

I know people from Lviv living here in Donetsk, they are nice people; and in fact I visited western Ukraine two weeks ago (ski resort), so personally I'm not afraid of scary ""banderivets"".

However, I think it's time to admit that ukrainization have failed, it would make sense to let people to use whatever language they want.

However, what's important here is the military bases the Russia has in that region. Their contract ends in 2033. The new Ukrainian government did mention that they want them out - Russia is simply protecting it bases and honoring that agreement from their side. 

Moreover, Russia has also decided that the potential for violence there is too great for them to sit idly by, so they bring in the troops (rightfully or otherwise). May I remind you that there was a plan discussed by the then-Western powers to practically level Germany or at least occupy it before WW II started? Hypothetically, 50 million lives could have been saved if that happened. But they waited for too long. Similar examples everywhere in the world. 

I am 100% sure that the US, or any capable world power, would have done the same if their interests were at stake. 

Also, since the Russian troops, thousands of them are already in Crimea, have you heard any news about any resistance - other than the new Kiev government? I have not. So, obviously, they have been ""welcomed"". 

The West does have a tendency to install new governments all over the world (and let's face it, this is what was done in the case of Ukraine and also Serbia for that matter), but now it was kind of the first time that there's resistance to that. Our government (in the case of Serbia) was installed by the West - and while we're thankful that Milošević is down - we'd rather not have to endure the 3 months of bombings we had. I'd rather have Milošević for 20 more years than go through that bombing again. Yes, there were ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, we admit that. But then why not just bomb Kosovo? Why bomb roads, bridges, railways, power plants all over Serbia? And I'd also like to say that while Milošević was horrible, horrible man, he was not a dictator - he was democratically elected both in 1992 and 1996, and both elections had international observers. He stepped down from power in 2000, when he lost the elections (though even then barely).

There was a plan to build a defensive line on the Elbe, and the concept of regrouping in the South of Germany was suspected, even if the plans were not known in detail. Btw, ironically the Allies had less access to German High Command messages towards the end of the war, as they were using landlines rather than radio, so the Allies did not know that the Germans were about to cave.

The attack on Dresden seems hard in retrospect, but in that time there were attacks on places like Darmstadt, Kassel, Pforzheim and Wuerzburg. Many as destructive, if not more so (in Pforzheim, 1/6th of its population were killed and 83% of its population destroyed in one night, a couple of weeks after Dresden). The difference is that these latter cities were in the Federal Republic after the war so less mythologising. 

Dresden was a beautiful city but it had not been demilitarised or declared to be ""Open"". On January 1, 1945 General Guderian declared Dresden to be a *Verteidigungsberich* or ""Military Defence Point"". Essentially, it was expected to defend itself to the end with no surrender and was to become part of a defensive line on the Elbe.

First, the war was not over and no ceasefire was in place and Hitler was very much still alive. You do not take your foot off the pedal because the enemy is losing and there had already been losses due to the Ardennes offensive.

Secondly, in WW2, precision bombing didn't work very well. There were a few exceptions involving low level attacks, but these were very limited and the losses were high (the Dambusters being an example). Most bombing was area by that point of the war. You had particular targets which would be marked by the Pathfinders but the dropped bombs could be anywhere in several kilometres. Once the initial bombs had dropped secondary fires would quickly mask the real aim points. In any case, in common with many German cities, the main station and the goods yards were fairly central.

Next, the city contained (according to the German High Command's own handbook) identified 127 companies that were directly supplying the military and this does not count smaller workshops that supplied them. Civilian factories were repurposed so that a company involved in machine manufacture for confectioners switched to making torpedo parts for the navy. Other companies made field telephones, the afore mentioned bomb sights, steering elements and so on. Note that as Dresden jealously guarded its *Judenfrei* status, they were marched five miles to and from the factories. As armaments Jews they lived better than others but ideology was prevailing over common sense and there had been a decision to eliminate the remainder.

It should also be mentioned that whilst the Nazi officials running Dresden and the military had ensured their own survival in case of an attack, the fact that it had not been bombed earlier encouraged them to economise on protecting the rest of the population. Other cities tried rather better to protect their population.

It should also be noted that after the attack, the Germans made full use of existing slave labourers, both those in concentration camps and Allied POWs like Vonnegut to collect bodies and repair the damage.

Finally, the level of damage was a myth sanctioned by Goebels (a zero was added to initial estimates and the military / industrial connections concealed. It was perpetuated under the DDR (which helped to mask the tens of thousands of women raped by the advancing Red Army) and finally written up by a Holocaust apologist (Irving) and adopted in more recent times by the ultra-right wing. It is only after the end of the DDR that the matter could be dispassionately reexamined.

The book upon which a lot of stories were based is Der Tod von Dresden by Axel Rodenberger. He grossly and unprofessionally overestimated casualties by over a factor of ten, perhaps using the faked Nazi data. The next was Die Unbesiegbare Stadt by Max Seydewitz (1955) which was backed by the DDR regime. Then there was The Destruction of Dresden by David Irving (1963).

My source is *Dresden: TUESDAY 13 FEBRUARY 1945* by Frederick Taylor (2004) which dismantles a lot of the myths from the number of casualties, the so-called massacre on the ""Elbe Meadows"" and the nature of the targets.

true,Deusdies,EART,Earth,"&gt; 1. Russia's fleet is stationed in Ukraine, not the other way around. This gives them a tile of land where they can have a base and some ships parked. Not the right to intervene in Ukraine's domestic issues. Whether Ukrainian government wants to continue to rent out the tile of land is not Russia's final decision. That's the bottom line.

I agree. But I think you're missing the point of my post - I do not support Russia's invasion per se, but if the West does it, why should Russia be disallowed from doing so as well? 

&gt; 2. What does Germany's situation pre WWII has to do with this? Ukraine has NEVER ever been an imperial power with aggressive history toward its neighbours (unlike Germany, Russia etc).

I was just drawing parallels. I was giving the Russians a possible reason for their invasion.

&gt; 3. What does the US foreign policy and world policing has to do with Ukraine's right to remain a peaceful state? Since when does US' bad ways allow Russia to be exactly the same kind of douche bag?

Since never. But, again, my point was that Russia is not the only douchebag on the block - the US, France, Britain, Germany, Serbia, we've all done the same, yet the criticism is mostly against the Russians (and sometimes the Americans).

&gt; 4. Whether the troops are welcomed by the locals or not is not relevant. Russian troops are according to all relevant definitions, Russian troops are invading Ukraine.

I completely agree.

&gt; 5. What the West does around the world is not Ukraine's fault and why should Ukraine suffer from Russia's aggressive and illegal foreign policies?

I agree there too. Again, my point was if the West does it, why should we criticize Russia more than the West? They're the same in my eyes. For all intents and purposes, my country (Serbia) was invaded in 1999, breaking every international law. Why should the Serbian people suffer for the mistakes that those in power made?

**Tomte** Sample: [Ich sang die ganze Zeit von dir] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6zP71psCT4). Best album: Hinter all diesen Fenstern

**Blumfeld** Sample: [Graue Wolken](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS13ZiwPSR8). Best album: Jenseits von Jedem

**Kettcar** Sample: [Landungsbrücken Raus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eZ3AaiBnU0), probably one of my favorite songs of all time. Best album: Du und wieviel von deinen Freunden

**Muff Potter** Sample: [Wir sitzen so vor'm Molotov](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCit8Tpy8D4). Best album: Heute Wird Gewonnen, Bitte

Are we thinking of the same EU? Because the one I know has no combined army. It has battle groups donated by individual countries. However, these groups are incapable of joint military action in areas that aren't third world African countries with practically no military.

Ukraine isn't the EU's responsibility. All the EU can do is attempt to look like a big boy while it silently begs the US to head a mission like it did in the 90s during the Yugoslav Wars. There isn't remotely enough cohesion among EU member states, when it comes to military, to launch a uniform campaign. 

I personally don't think the US should do anything. Why? Because the world LOVES to blame America for everything when it does invade countries which are otherwise under dictatorship. This may sound selfish and inhumane, but let the world remember what it's really like if people cry for help and the US doesn't answer. Trust me, I'm Hungarian, we know what that shit feeling is like.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ukraine is a signatory the UN, under the UN Charter of Human Rights, a group of people have the right to self determination, this means any group of people can vote to become independent if they want, they have to hold a referendum or plebiscite for it to be legally recognised by the UN and every country in the UN. The only way Ukraine can prevent this is by leaving the UN. If Crimea has a free and fair referendum monitored by independent UN monitors and a majority (50%+1) of people vote to become an independent country, there's absolutely nothing the Ukrainian government can do to stop it without violating international law, Ukraine's constitution is totally irrelevant. This is why Scotland is being offered an independence referendum and probably Catalonia sometime in the future. 


&gt;In 1941 Allies of World War II signed the Atlantic Charter and accepted the principle of self-determination. In January 1942 twenty-six states signed the Declaration by United Nations, which accepted those principles. The ratification of the United Nations Charter in 1945 at the end of World War II placed the right of self-determination into the framework of international law and diplomacy.


&gt;The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights article 15 states that everyone has the right to a nationality and that no one should be arbitrarily deprived of a nationality or denied the right to change nationality.

A = The majority is in favour, but it's a weak majority.
B = A majority is in favour is more likely.

Notice how these do not mean the same are mutually exclusive (one is talking about a likeliness, the other about a definite statement).

C = The extent to what level people are in favour is essentially split.

Notice how the word 'essentially' implies an approximation.

You start by saying A. Then PlanesTrainsAndAutos says C. You then change to B (thereby denying A). Then I say C again. You then go back to statement A (thereby denying B). I then say both A and B do not give the right information to the reader, but C would do so. You then say B again (denying A again). 

You seem to be stuck between A and B, not realizing that when you say A you deny B, and when you say B you deny A. Yet, you try to prove your point by using the combination of A and B. 

Whether my short term memory might be worse than yours, my sense of logic is not.

The reason I picked C, might you be interested, is because although B is true (which it is - you said it right when you said B), it would not inform the reader as much as would C. ",0,1393711356,null,0,false,0,cfrz9k6,t3_1z9qe7,t1_cfrz9k6,t1_cfryw87,null,1432616314,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

Have I said otherwise? I merely tried to give you perspective why you shouldn't expect EU troops standing their ground in Ukraine any time soon, *and it's not an economic one* as some people from the US always try to point out.

&gt;You were all so quick to cut ties after NSA came out, I've been here the whole time.

I for my part am still in favour of doing so, while ramping up a European security apparatus. I won't stop trying to convince a few hundred million other people, but it's not really that easy. Don't do the same mistake you probably rightfully point out some Europeans engage in quite frequently in the American version, namely to hold any single citizen of the EU accountable for the actions of all.

There are plenty of us who want to have a feasible EU-directed military and security, it's just that we are going up against a whole metric fuckton of problems.

&gt;Yet now you all start crying for American help when Russia is looming? 

Really? Who is? Care to share some heardlines other than what the Ukrainian government is doing? I for one have not heard a single EU member state that is crying for the US at the moment. 

&gt;How many posts have there been in /r/Europe bashing people who have pointed out the relative military weakness of Europe? 

Is it ever discussed? I for one am holding this position since somewhere around the NSA revelations, where I switched over from thinking that NATO suffices to believing that an EU standalone security system. Reasons should be obvious.

But I will not disagree that there are many people who do not even consider this problem. Maybe now they will. 

But again, you talk to me like I am responsible for their actions. Are you responsible for actions of other Americans? I know people react to Americans for actions of your government, because I've seen and decisively stood against it. But please don't make the same mistake. It seems to me that you are rather aggravated at the treatment you've experienced on this sub regarding your country. If it was unfair, and I wouldn't be surprised it it was, then I apologise. I fear you will need to accept it as much as any European must accept that some will call us antique, out-dated and spoiled.

&gt;How many times has it been said by you lot that Europe has no enemies and nobody to fear? The top posts here in /r/Europe are things patting yourselves on the back with GDP and population comparisons of the E.U. and U.S. you were all so quick to feel good that you have ""more"" than us. 

I am sure this occurs at times, but I wouldn't really call this the top posts. For the past 4 months, most discussion was either about Brexit or Ukraine.

As I stated before, our military expenditure is sufficiently high to have a functioning EU military if we combine what we spend now nationally. This is no question of economics, it's a question of politics. Why would discussion about GDP or population enter any discussion about security matters?

&gt;We have a saying here in the U.S. ""If you can't run with the big dogs stay under the porch"". You lot have done a lot of barking but now when it comes time for the biting you all come running back to us when you were so quick to run away? I don't think so.

Peacefully overturning a government is no barking? Not using military channels doesn't equate to having no influence on the international stage. It's just that going against a nuclear power *head-on* is not in the capabilites of the EU at the moment, and I agree with you in this respect.

No, **you** named *illegal interventions* as something being a russain thing, I named other, more respected nations, as doing just that. I am not arguing what can one do / other not, I am arguing against your stupidity.

&gt;Its far worse in Russia given that you can't even hold fairly good standard elections, at a lot of Eastern Euope tries to change, russia however does not. 

Another arrogant bullshit, what the fuck do you know about russans and their will to change? They had elections, and they were fairly free before, while putin was popular leading them out of the deep hole communism left them. Then there was medvedev alias puppet-puttin and putin reelections which were mildly said, shaky. The need for fixed elections might to a smarter fellow indicate will to change, shouldnt it?

And what about pussy riots, what about kasparov and the opposition? What about the large demonstartions for months after elections?

I dunno if this is rage, or really just pure ignorance to go spewing this strange attributes of some russian-denial. I am not historically aware of some tendency of blaming others for their own situation.

&gt;Who cares about 70 y/o tanks, a defunct space station and a rifle that was past its prime in the 80s. 

Someone who screams incompetence and inferiority of products should try to be aware of some quite high quality ones. And they build and delivered to the orbit huge part of current ISS...  not that that argument is needed, since their first space station was quite a feat on itself, quite obvious to anyone who is not raging for being told.

and anyone who tries to make ak47 seem contemporary insignificant have no idea wtf is he talking about.

There are couple tiny issues with that statement:

1. Many Western powers hold on to their colonies as long as they could. 50 years passed, so now it is totally all right to claim a high ethical ground... right? 
Simultaneously India, Vietnam and Indonesia from 50-70 years ago are equated in their status to Siberia... I personally find it to be a bit of stretch. Closer comparison is territorially close ""separatists"" regions within Western countries. 
 
2. Even today UK/France/USA hold to some territories that are often half a world away... why? Population of these territories support status quo + it probably makes geostrategic sense for mother countries. 
In case of Crimea, Russia has interests there, majority of population of the peninsula want some closer relationship with Russia rather than Ukraine. ... So in some sense if UK fought for Falklands (that were somehow claimed by Argentina, Russia might feel the same about Crimea).

Thirdly, and as a consequence, many businesspeople are affiliated with AKEL. They are not voting against their interests, are they? AKEL serves their interests. 

Fourthly, AKEL rhetoric does not have a theoretical Marxist analysis. They are a party devoid of substance, as big parties always are. They often say things like ""Workers controlling the means of production? Is that a joke?"" (&lt;-- that's socialism, the first step to communism, you'd expect communists to believe in that)

The results of WWII are extremely controversial, Poland was one of the nations which gained absolutely nothing positive from the 'declaration of war' or the war results as a whole.

It was left for Stalin to do as he wished, where mass killings continued as he had been doing all across the Soviet Union since a long time.


There was no liberation of Eastern Europe, only nations changing oppressors.
Nazi Germany was destroyed and we let Stalinist Soviet Union reign supreme, when it was the same caliber of criminal, if not worse.

Okay, also warum nicht aufhören mit *allen* Geschlechtererwartungen? Ich bin genauso gegen Jungen-Ü-Eier oder sonstwelchen bullshit. Ich erkenne an, dass Jungs auch oft genug in irgendwelche dummen Rollen gepresst werden, absolut.

&gt;Das alles zu ändern würde die Umstellung der kompletten Gesellschaft verlangen. Das ist utopisch. Wir sind nicht alle gleich, können wir auch nicht sein.

Darum geht es mir persönlich auch nicht, ich finde es genauso utopisch alle gleich zu behandeln. Ich bin nur dagegen Unterschiede künstlich zu konstruieren oder herbeizuführen. Jungen werden wohl noch eine geraume Zeit technisch begabter bleiben und Mädchen z.B. künstlerischer, das hat ja auch biologische Gründe. Man sollte nur nicht Kinder einreden, dass das absolut in Stein gemeißelt ist. Ich finde, dass das viel zu oft passiert.

&gt;Das Geschlechtssystem ist hinüber - da ist ein Ü-Ei nur die Spitze und das lächerlichste kleinste Problem an der ganzen Geschichte.

Ich glaube, dass wir nicht wirklich unterschiedlicher Meinung sind. Die Ü-Eier sind auch eher ein Auslöser (haha, trigger warning :p) als der wirklich schlimme Grund.

I think it's a bit harsh to say Churchill ""sold Poland to the USSR"". Churchill was one of the only people at the Potsdam conference seriously arguing for an independent and democratic Poland, as the French had fiscal concerns and Truman wasn't really so experienced as Roosevelt and had other, more pressing, concerns (notably the Pacific). 

Furthermore, Churchill had actually pleaded with the president to continue the war passed Berlin and into the Soviet Union, saying something like ""We didn't declare a war on one dictatorship only for them to fall victim to another"". 

Unfortunately we were having an election *during* the Potsdam conference and changed prime ministers halfway through the conference (I'm not even joking) in favour of the more internally interested Clement Atlee who would later set up the NHS and the Welfare state. Not really interested in Poland. 

You could argue that British resolve faltered at the last minute, but I think we were really the last ones in there, who were fighting Poland's corner. And even if you are going to criticise us for pulling out, it certainly wasn't Churchill who let Poland down, it was the British people who voted for a more domestically interested prime minister.

He's blatantly ripping off hitler's playbook on czeckoslovakia.

Now i know it's not hitler but he expects to get away with it like he did in Georgia.

Except we can't let him do that. Why ? 

- Because we can't trust anything he says anymore as he saw us like a dozen time in a few weeks

- Because Ukraine just had a revolution to throw out a corrupt russian oligarch and tried to apply to UE and we can't let other countries bully our at the very least friends ? Because it'd mean we'd be weaker than them

- "" maybe they go to Kiev"" ; because he said that they'd not approch the frontier before. Then they'd not go in ukraine. Then they'd not go in crimea. Then that it was milicia ""unknown"" men. Then... 

Let's cut the BS right there would you ? If you allow that to run unchecked there is no limit ever. Then he'll be trying to push 'till Germania's border while trying to make us not react becase we fear war. Then bleed us economically and makes us a satellite state blatantly.

Four words for you here : *Not. going. to. happen.*

- Because we gave our word to the Ukrainian from Kiev that we would help them against russian rettribution when they ceased to pay protection money, and that if we can't hold our word we're either weak&amp;useless or cowards or traitors, and either way we're untrustable.

- Because i sure as fuck don't want T90 roll unchecked in Europe ? While we can handle diplomatic BS and realpolitiks etc, using *real weapons* against another UNSC nation is ought to be a big fucking no no. And somebody is forgetting it right now.

No, i said that we played *nice* by not doing that, because that's what the americans would have done in our place. And the russians are confusing that for *weakness* obviously just because we don't have the same first answer. But sometime you have to draw the line.

Liberalism, communism, party policies etc are just things they put in their manifestos because they have to.

That's how parties operate in Cyprus. they are the middle man between the people, and the rulers. they do you favours and in return you keep them to power so they get paid very well.

2/3 of Cypriot parties were created in a single month in the 70s when the Americans asked Archbishop Makarios, the first president (in power for 14 years, until he died), to make something to make Cyprus look like a democracy,  because back then parties almost didn't exist.

So long as you have enough nuclear weapons to overwhelm the enemy anti-missile systems and ensure that at least one missile can get through at any point in time, then you have an active nuclear deterrent. The UK currently has 225 nuclear missiles and has a whole bunch constantly at sea in its submarines, which allow us to launch a barrage of nuclear weapons at whoever we please, from where ever we please, whenever we please. If the Russians launched nukes at us we would just retaliate from some unknown location with more missiles than they can intercept which would probably lead to the absolute destruction of most of Russia's chief Western military installations and cities (St Petersburg, Moscow, Volgograd). 

If the Russians are willing to destroy the UK and have the entire Western portion of their country destroyed and uninhabitable for God knows how long, then it'd probably make no difference if the US missiles were there or not.

Let's say tomorrow the Northern Irish decided they didn't want to be British anymore. They hold it to a referendum, it passes, they join Ireland(Or remain independent, whatever). All is well and good.

Now, let's say tomorrow instead of that, that the Irish government orchestrated mass dissidence, armed and funded militants, and set an atmosphere of tension of potential violence. The Irish government then went to the British and said ""Hey, look, the Northern Irish are clearly sick of you, we're going to step in and deal with the problem before it gets out of hand and protect the ethnic Irish majority and impost the will of the people in reuniting them with their countrymen. Don't fuck with us, OK?"". This is what it happening, and that is not all well and good.

Prior to this intervention by Russia, the separatist movement in Crimea was not galvanized to this degree. Yes, they were an Autonomous Republic within Ukraine, and nobody really cared about it. They did what they did, as long as nobody messed with what they wanted they continued on with their day being autonomous and self-governing. There was always a strong tie to Russia but Crimea was never even near the point where there was a strong reunification movement with the Russian Federation.

Russia will occupy and annex Crimea in much the same way it did in Abkhazia and South Ossetia; the people there will vote for either Russian annexation or independence within the Russian sphere; either outcome will be recognised only by Russia; but with the Russian army firmly embedded in their new territory, the only option other than accept it and move on is route them out, which could in Russia be sold to the pubic as a war of aggression against them and which would be a nightmare situation for the west - a huge risk for, from the west's perspective, dubious gains. Only Ukraine and Russia care about Crimea; other nations' concerns are more to do with Russian aggression and defending a potential ally, not the welfare of Crimeans.

So in all likelihood there will be a round of international condemnation, Russia will suffer some economic consequences, but at the end of the day it won't hurt them in the long run since 50% of the Russian economy comes from oil and gas exports, which Europe cannot do without. Even if they can, China would love to buy them up too, and China is all about annexing regions it has historical claims on (and Russia does have some legitimacy in viewing Crimea as part of Russia, no that that is an excuse of course).

At this point I'm pretty sure more laws are broken from US/UK* (*US bitch) embassies around the world than from any military base.

Apart from that, all the debate about EU increasing military budgets and US lowering its own, is, in my perspective, pretty false. The US has no interest in the EU building a strong, combined, military. That will reduce instantly US world power and global reach, reducing the military spending in the US would cut what is really a jobs program, for military personal and for the military industry complex, which is a financial aide to another jobs program. European countries could easily rise to the necessity, but that would break a western pact, which is, in my opinion, unknown to the public and very much cared after in US/EU bureaus.

Им-то похуй на самом деле на страдания местных аборигенов, главное чтобы Россия не смогла тут усилиться, а Янукович как раз в последнее время составлял приятное впечатление диктатора, который и не ложится полностью под этих ужасных русских, и в то же время с ним можно договориться о бизнесе. В частности, о сланцевом газе и прочих ресурсных ништяках. И тут завертелось! Коктейли молотова, БТРы, катапульты, вся хуйня. Януковича походу могут скинуть - а кто блядь будет обязательства соблюдать, договоренности? Правый Сектор, да? А с кем теперь разговоры о бизнесе вести? С козаком Данилюком, да? А вдруг русские ломанутся и усилятся - разве такое можно допустить?
&gt; 
&gt; Китай, у которого здесь тоже свои интересы в Крыму, не столько в шоке, сколько в недоумении: почему местный варвар все никак не разгонит своих противников? В самом Китае в 1989 году была такая же хрень на площади Тяньаньмень, но они без лишних сантиментов расстреляли сотни безоружных студентов, и все быстро закончилось. Запад, конечно, немного побурчал, но потом стал активно сотрудничать в экономическом плане. Китайцам неясно, почему диктатор не может поступить самым очевидным образом, но в целом им похуй: все это очень далеко, в восточноевропейские разборки они пока всерьез не вникают. И вообще на носу дела посерьезнее: партия поставила задачу выиграть абсолютно все медали на Олимпиаде-2016 и водрузить красный китайский флаг на Марсе, не до украинцев сейчас.
&gt; 
&gt; Активное небезразличное население Киева в шоке уже несколько месяцев. Непрерывно в шоке. Шок с каждым днем все нарастал, но с какого-то момента его полностью заменил энтузиазм действия. Лучше привозить лекарства в Михайловский монастырь и хуярить омельченковскую плитку на Майдане, чем смотреть ужасы на Громадском и переживать у экрана. 
&gt; 
&gt; Пассивное безразличное население Киева пока еще пьет пивко на лавочке, лайкает фоточки вконтактике, смотрит Сваты-6 и топчет пельмешки. Оно еще не понимает, что происходит. Вот если негласное ЧП (в том числе ограничение на въезд в город), устроенное Яныком, продлится пару дней и в городе станет не хватать хавки - вот тогда оно окажется в таком шоке, которого еще не знало в своей жизни.
&gt; 
&gt; Я думаю, что не в шоке сегодня только тот козак, которого я сегодня днем встретил на Майдане. У него длинный чуб, шаровары и нашивки на камуфляже с текстом вроде ""Військо Запорізьке"". Он с улыбкой уверенно шел на передовую к Беркуту, держа в одной руке щит с надписью ""Слава Україні!"", а в другой какую-то устрашающего вида палку. Он весело напевал какую-то песню, и во мне возникла уверенность, что этого человека не тревожат вопросы ""как я доберусь сегодня домой?"", ""не случится ли со мной чего-нибудь?"" и ""что с нами со всеми потом будет?"".

I think that now is a situation where all around in shock from the hells going on.

First of all, the guys in shock from the EU. They portrayed themselves fucking diplomats , has come down to communication with cultureless barbarian - leader of third world countries numb awaiting handouts in the form of an Association Agreement , which allowed him to acquire a certain status bitching ""great evrointegratora "" in his banana republic and win elections in 2015 th year. From the height of its diplomatic mission, they missed that crucial moment when the barbarian suddenly fucked them by making 46 million for his slaves opt orkovskogo Mordor , not elven Valinor . Because Hells bureaucracy and misunderstanding Ukrainian realities they allowed initially peaceful situation result in almost a civil war. They , in fact , not needed here fuck hard kneading with crowds of refugees , terrorist attacks , tanks, and other pleasures - they will make every effort to prevent this, even if they have to leave power stupid barbarian leader. But the problem is that the leader , hike , quite mad. Now we have to not only respond to the extremely difficult questions of European viewers like "" a part of the protesters skhuyali there with our flags are nationalist paraphernalia ? But if they are peaceful , what dick they throw Molotov cocktails at the cops? "" and "" Che , they want so much to us in the EU? vnature Th and we will take 46 million of these barbarians to us? "" , but also to argue that the situation is under control and that the attacks on five Ukrainian NPP nobody will allow . Overall Old Europe shocked she had ever seen since the days of Yugoslavia. Especially shocked Commissioner Füle and Ashton - their diplomatic career in jeopardy because their efficiency is very low : as a representative of the EU to Ukraine , to achieve the transition is peaceful rally in phase ferocious fucking could and Arab immigrant suburb of Marseille.

Opposition leaders also shocked. They wanted to use the energy of the Maidan to meet personal political ambitions - and raskochegarilsya everything so Mama Do not Cry ! They are politicians , not the warlords - they really do not know what all of this motion to do. They insanely difficult task : on the one hand, they need to portray ardent revolutionaries to the barricades pizdyuley not discharged from the stage nafig not overthrown , and , on the other hand, they need hard cry on the West that they believed in the purely peaceful nature protest , they are not considered the leaders of illegal armed groups , and the legitimate leaders of peaceful protest , and then designate them as principal here when it's over . Yet handle bad : that "" kul forehead "" , ""we agreed on a truce ."" In fact , they somehow control the protest , already , hike , do not believe they are.

And Yanukovych himself too shocked ! After all evolved so successfully : rose from the bottom to the top, was one of the kings of Donbass , survived the disastrous year of 2004 and then all bent , provided the whole family and , as the crowning success , built himself a fucking mansion and there zaebashil golden toilet . The boy came to a total success! Moreover, in 2015 it expected several options to win the election , and then, suddenly , it would be possible to learn from Putin and Lukashenko in terms of an infinite board . But his greed has destroyed the same pigeons : Autumn gamble with the association with the EU was disastrous . Had several opportunities to all hush , but Dad made ​​missteps while listening to their ""hawks"" , and now the situation is extremely foul . What does he do now - finally clear. After February 18th, the situation is back to "" I'm a bad president , but dosizhu before the elections in 2015 "" will not return , not all forces Berkut Acceleration and Putin he already quite fucked by their greed and stupidity , and help from him is fraught with loss of power and assets. Has a chance to establish the capital of the Republic of Donbass Yenakievo and you will immediately sebat there by helicopter from Kiev, where there will be too hot. But suddenly it does not turn her? And , besides , how can throw your golden toilet on the right bank ? Confusing ... And if you run out of the country , then where ? Who needs it without influence and assets? Anyone ... But what if hanged ?

In shock and ""hawks"" . Guys honestly thought that once there pobryatsat slegontsa shields, so once all scatter. Because , you know , all the "" real boys "", "" clear guys , something decisive ,"" "" dear people with connections "" have long been known as a bit of support and ""hawks"" , and all these pros , farmers and students - all "" fuckers full "" . A "" goof - it's fate !"" Driven eagle , BB, GAI, SBU titushek , criminals , idiots just zazombirovannyh - began their assault. Just started ... Nihuya . The second time we started ... Nihuya . Third time began ... Nihuya ! Do not disagree , you bastards ! Quite the contrary - you beat them valish them and their contrary more and they are stronger. Hands begin to shake after seeing fun burning BTR previously -inspiring absolute confidence . Dad , of course, its not surrender : but what to do now , is EPT ? Use the army ? But they did not work, not unlike zadobryali cops and prosecutors - a sudden change ?

Ordinary berkutyata in even greater shock. OPG known fighters ""Berkut"" who work part -time for the police , faced with unprecedented garbage in the struggle with them united businessmen, which they milked the last few years , and football ultras , with whom they fought constantly in the stadiums . At first everything was cool : to participate in the movement in the center of Kiev , are fully protected pohuyarit clubbed unarmed people, and then get a medal with the money and return home. But it all somehow neebicheski delayed. Those who are more stupid ( and most of them) , now features as evil at all , do not understand why more Yanyk gave the order to disperse all ( and shoot for Ebony most active ) and believe that Yanyk - rag . Those who are more intelligent ( and they are a minority ) , clearly understand how dangerous acceleration. First stupid not the fact that it all succeed, but the fact that the loss will be great - and die for gold toilet is not desirable. Second, even if all disperse , because tomorrow it will be one by one watering Berkut in doorways as a database with their names and addresses. And , unlike the regionals sebatsya abroad they do not have time , and all the charm of popular anger they learn . They are now desperately want to Yanyk returned everything back as it was, but the probability of this decreases with each passing day.

The Kremlin is also shocked. They led her thin KGBshnuyu game , supporting Donetsk bandits slowly increasing influence in Ukraine and buying key assets . Slowly planned annexation of half of Ukraine in "" voluntary annexation "" by developing a real fifth column here and not in the form of situational Donetsk Gangs . But then this stupid ass fucked by their first maneuvers of extortion of money for entry into the vehicle, and then clumsily played in the afternoon and made some quite unnecessary now trash . In good tanks should be administered in the Donbass and the Crimea , it is too late , but that can not spoil the Olympics , and do not fucking ready - there is not a small Georgia, nice and fast to do everything without training does not work, and if do not beautiful, it is possible a minimum of visa problems in Courchevel , and a maximum of the Third World . Kremlin propaganda looks at how right now on Independence forged modern Ukrainian nation , and weeps tears of blood - dick now all these people explain that they are "" Little Russians "" that their language and artificially invented some dick that they should return to the fold Empire and unfasten tribute to Moscow . But even this is all garbage compared to the fact that the simple Russian man , accustomed to over the years and slavish obedience to the fact that "" nothing can be changed ,"" now looks thoughtfully at the TV screen and see how heavily armed Berkut third month can not do anything with a bunch of previously always funny and bizarre crests . Thoughts in his head come bad , and
is very concerned about the Kremlin . The Belarusian man a step up in development: he had retired from the screen to the window, and, not least thought already looks doors nearest police station , where from it not so long ago knocked bribe.

And the United States to Britain in shock. Fuck it im really suffering on the local Aboriginal people , the main thing that Russia could not immediately increase, while Yanukovich just recently was a pleasant experience of a dictator who never falls completely under these terrible Russian , and at the same time with him , you can negotiate the business . In particular, shale gas and other resource nishtyak . And then began to spin ! Molotov cocktails , APCs , catapults , all garbage . Yanukovych's campaign can throw - and who will damn the obligation to comply , the agreement ? Right Sector , huh? And who now talk about business news? With Kozak Danilyuk , huh? And suddenly Russian lomanutsya and effort - perhaps this can happen?

Yes, the US has been funding the Ukrainian government for quite a few years with small subsidies - bribes? I don't know what that money is spent on - but the rest of your post is, frankly speaking, borderline nonsense.

Allow me to incur Godwin's Law - want to know who got into power legitimately? Adolf Hitler. The fact that the elections were fair and free mean nothing if the leader is not continuing in that pattern post-election.

The situation in your analogy is also different - you are comparing a majority Euromaidan to a minority Irish Unionist. Maidan was clearly a grassroots movement to oust President Yanukovych. OK, let's say that it's just a protest and therefore has no democratic legitimacy - this is true. This does not give the right for a violent clamp down culminating in use of firearms on a civilian population. That effectively removes democratic legitimacy from any government and transfers it to the protesters. 

This entire problem could've been resolved had Yanukovych reacted in a democratic manner, called a snap election and had the problem resolved then and there, because while you can't know if it was a majority against him just from protests, there was a large enough vocal group against him that this action would have been justified.

No, instead he took a payout from the Russians and here we are.

How this ties in to Crimea is now that the Russians realize that their gambit with Yanukovych and Ukraine proper has failed, they're going to bully them into giving up a significant territory, bypassing yet again the democratic process.

If a referendum would be held now, I sure as hell would declare it illegitimate. You cannot have a fair, democratic process while under foreign occupation, or at the very least in an atmosphere of intense intimidation(Which the Fascists/Nazis used quite often in elections), depending on which side of the fence you're sitting on.

Had Russia not invaded and had simply used diplomacy and stated; ""Hey, look, our ethnic Russians do not feel safe in your country, have referendums in these provinces to decide if they want to leave, if they decide not to leave then we will respect that but we will absolutely intervene if there is violence in the region""

However, Putin isn't stupid, he doesn't go down the path of diplomacy because nobody wants to god damn join Russia of their own free will. All the Eastern regions are still majority Ukrainian with the only exception being Crimea, which he invaded. Now he's going to use tensions over Crimea, along with some other political machinations, as a pretext to invade Ukraine and annex the Eastern territories, securing with brute force what he could not get with democracy.",0,1393727437,null,0,false,0,cfs55i6,t3_1z9y45,t1_cfs55i6,t1_cfs4ab6,null,1432619162,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Is that just self-defence? What about another (non-European) country's defence? If so, our military would require some ""global reach"" to insure the defence of another country and may even require some *offence* to insure one side completely stops attacking or doesn't attack again (as your country knows first hand).

Or is it a case of ""it's their problem, not ours?"" In that selfish case; what pacifists seem to forget is that what at happens abroad *does* effect us, whether we take action to control the outcome or not. In other words, inaction can have consequences for us, just as taking action does.

---

&gt;**Carnival** (often spelled **Carnaval**) is a festive season which occurs immediately before [Lent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent); the main events are usually during February. Carnival typically involves a public [celebration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebration_(party\)) or [parade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade) combining some elements of a [circus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_(performing_art\)), mask and public [street party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_party). People often dress up or [masquerade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masquerade_ball) during the celebrations, which mark an overturning of daily life. In Germany and the Netherlands, the Carnival season is traditionally opened on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.). This dates back to celebrations before the former longer [Advent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent) season (40 days now reduced to about four weeks), or with harvest celebrations of [St. Martin's Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Martin%27s_Day).

Sure, once all or most electricity comes from renewables, it can make sense to heat directly with electricity, and a bit earlier for heat pumps. But first of all, bear in mind that this would severely increase the needed capacity of the electricity grid. Only around 1/8th of our energy consumption (in countries that do not primarily heat with electricity) is actual electricity usage, the rest is for heating. So in essence, if you wish to replace all heating by electricity, you first have to a) completely fill the current energy requirements with renewables, and then b) at least quadruple that energy production and c) upgrade the energy grid to cope with the higher load and d) upgrade it to cope with the huge fluctuations in energy production.

What makes a lot more sense than converting e.g. solar energy with solar cells into electricity and then back into heat, is to use solar heating collectors to heat water which can then be used in fresh water warming and radiators. My parents have one of those, for example. During the summer and much of spring and autumn, the water heater basically stays off most of the time.
