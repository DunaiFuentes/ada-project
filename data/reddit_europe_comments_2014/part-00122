If you did that in the US, you would be sued into bankruptcy and penalized by the SEC. European banks are the largest in the world, not because of stifling regulation. 

""Better"" is a very subjective term. A few comments above you talk about how taking the aggregate is a meaningless measurement, yet that is what you do in this comment by calling the entire economy ""better"". There are a lot of people suffering in Southern Europe, partially because they're being forced to use a monetary policy that does not fit their economies. This is where I would agree with your above statements. Taking the aggregate does not offer close to the full picture. Many people are suffering, and if you only look at the aggregate numbers sometimes that is easy to forget.

More importantly I met people who could legitimately say they survived a genocide attempt, I shared a 5 hour shared taxi ride with a guy from Baghdad, and a 4 hour ride with a guy from Mosul, how many people get to experience that? I will say I felt fairly unsafe once, but in all fairness I tried to avoid the route I was on, but the language barrier proved to be too high. There is almost no tourist infrastructure (especially in Iraq), so that is tourism on expert level. 

For a more familiar setting, you could rent a motorcycle in Vietnam. Hanoi is nuts, so while leaving the city you might end up sliding across a Vietnamese roadway like me. The mountains around Hanoi are often missed, and best experienced one-on-one on a motorcycle in my opinion. The fact you're on a motorcycle trip without the conveniences of chain hotels or other Western conveniences really adds to the fun in my opinion. If you prefer, you could take Vietnam Railways, where you will swear the train is going to derail, although they sometimes do. A 21 hour trip ends up taking 28, and the hallways are lined with stowaways that bribed their way on. But that is all part of the fun. You'll likely be the only white guy on there (like I was) and its a huge culture shock, but I bet you will look back at it with nostalgia.

true,mucco,trentino,,"Juventus and Inter are the two most hated teams in Italy, good choice.

Juventus is the most supported team in Italy, so it is also the most hated. The main source of the hate is that they stole two titles (2005 and 2006) from Inter.

Inter is the main antagonist of Juventus, so it is the second most hated as all the Juventus fans hate Inter. The main source of the hate is that they stole two titles (2005 and 2006) from Juventus.

Juventus has a policy of buying each and every italian player that might or might not end up in the Italy national team (or at least trying).

Inter has a policy of buying each and every argentinian player that might or might not end up in the Argentina national team (or at least trying).

Juve has more national titles. Inter has more Champions' Leagues.

Juve will allow you to get yourself in dangerous situations all over Italy, while nobody really has strong feelings for Inter fans outside of Juve strongholds - aside from a slight feeling of compassion and pity.

Both clubs have asshole managers; however, with some of the Inter's old guard retiring/moving on, now Juve clearly have more cunts/badasses (depending on your allegiance) on the pitch.

Juve is owned by one of the wealthiest italian families. Inter used to, but now it is owned by some asian guy who promises he will spend a ton of money.

Especially those that are considered crazy today (that is, among Europeans at least). Or in other words - western values from 19th, early 20th century. (No offense! just my opinion).

I think they do spend a lot of effort in re-building an image and a position in world politics they once thought they had. In a way, you can think of it as them trying to be the closest competitor to US or something like that. 

Its the only explanation I can find for Putin's support. And the whole 'KGB is cool' idea. Also, remember how they sent some soldiers in one of the ex-Yugoslavia wars? When they were practically running around the place, trying to capture some the 'bad-guys' bases only to surrender them to the British or something? Just to be the first... It really looks  me like the behavior of child nobody wants to play with. (again, no offense!)

Personally, I don't think its a problem, they can compete with the US as much as they want to, AS LONG as it goes through the UN. They have a good position there, so there's no excuse for not using it in my mind. I would be happy if they decide to compete with the US on UN-level. 

At the same time, if they go the 'US ignores UN, why can't we?' way... I think they should be pushed out of the various G7's, G8's or whatever...

Si, i lavori iniziarono davvero negli anni '30 ma durarono molto poco! Furono ripresi e ultimati solo nel dopoguerra.

&gt; I lavori per per una ferrovia di collegamento con l'EUR iniziarono negli anni trenta durante il governo fascista, allo scopo di offrire un collegamento rapido tra la stazione Termini, situata al centro della città e il nuovo quartiere denominato E42, dove avrebbe dovuto tenersi l'Esposizione Universale del 1942. La manifestazione non ebbe mai luogo a causa dell'entrata in guerra dell'Italia nel 1940. Al momento dell'interruzione dei lavori erano già state realizzate alcune gallerie (nel tratto che va da Termini a Piramide) che furono utilizzate come rifugi antiaerei durante i bombardamenti.

La tratta della foto è Colosseo, quindi rientra nella tratta anni '30, tra Termini e Piramide.

&gt; I lavori ripresero nel 1948, contemporaneamente all'avanzamento dei lavori nell'ex area dell'esposizione che mutò parzialmente fisionomia, destinazione (divenendo un riuscito quartiere direzionale) e nome (EUR). La ferrovia venne inaugurata a Termini il 9 febbraio 1955 dal presidente della Repubblica Luigi Einaudi, mentre il servizio regolare iniziò il giorno successivo.",0,1398846952,null,0,false,0,ch5tyqc,t3_24covu,t1_ch5tyqc,t1_ch5tx0i,null,1433586530,4,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,4

Not one-offs but definately on lower production rate. Of course Russia cannot out-produce the west, and US has resources and production capabilities to build tons of hardware. it still doesn't change the fact that Abrams would get destroyed by modern Russian, German or British tank. Just take a minute and compare Abrams with T-90. T-90 can fire missiles from the gun, has auto-loader, [3rd gen reactive armour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kontakt-5), has active [soft-kill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtora) and [hard-kill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_\(countermeasure\)) protection systems, [stealth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakidka). 
 
&gt;As I've repeatedly said Russia can match the capabilities in some areas, but their 'tech' is less sophisticated  
 
I still don't understand what you mean by 'tech'. Can you give an example? 
 
&gt;Also according to that link the PAK-FA's stealth is slightly worse because the US have been doing 'this' for far longer. 
 
It is slightly worse because of the design choices Sukhoi did. They decided not to sacrifice maneuverability to reduce RCS a bit more, the way US did. 
 
I think you don't quite understand how Russia does things vs how US does things. Lets continue with out jets example. Back in the day both US and Russia decided that they need 5th gen jet. They came up with a list of requirements and started R&amp;D in few years US came up with a jet which met all of those requirements bar one - super maneuverability. But they decided to change requirements and go ahead with production anyway. Moreover they gone to full production even before the testing was done. Why? because US has insane production capabilities and resources. They can afford to produce stuff, and when they figure out something better they will produce more stuff. If Russia had all designs and documentation on F-22 back when US started to full produce them, Russians would probably build one prototype, study it and shelf it because it doesn't meet all requirements Russia has for 5th gen jet. And that's what Russia did with their own developments. They designed and build prototypes tested it checked technologies and moved on. To design next ones. They studied 5th gen jet concepts on [SU-47](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-47) and [MIG 1.44](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan_Project_1.44) as well as other concepts which didn't made it to public. And only when they thought that they got all they need in PAK-FA they started slow pre-production to make sure that if there are any problems with the design there would be no need for expensive re-development.

It is indeed probably easy to think that Russia is stuck in a stone age when you compare new M4A1 with Russian AK47, but if you do a bit more research you'll see that Russia doesn't use AK-47 for years now, and even AK-74 are only given out to conscripts. So to be fair you should compare M4A1 with AK-100 series, AK-12 or AN-94. And you'll see that there is no gap in any ""tech"". 

Of curse Russia cannot mass produce everything like US does and Russia does have to invest more R&amp;D into improving cost-efficiency, but it doesn't mean that Russia is not on the edge of military R&amp;D the same way US and other countries are.

&gt;The west is just technologically ahead of everyone else, sure the gap is close and perhaps even closing, but for the moment we can outclass everyone else.

So this statement is basically wrong. It seems like you know a lot about western military hardware but apart from AK-47, RPG-7 and T-34 absolutely nothing about Russia's military technology. And if you are interested in military technology you definitely should read up more on Russia. It's quite interesting, they have few quite unique and interesting developments like supercavitating torpedoes, swarming missiles, plasma stealth. It is usually harder to find info on Russian technology as most R&amp;D is done by state companies so they usually don't have a need to publish advertising material, but it could be done if you are interested enough.",0,1398847069,null,0,false,0,ch5tzfp,t3_24424k,t1_ch5tzfp,t1_ch5gfci,null,1433586538,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1
true,Spineward,EURO,European Union,"Okay i'll jump in, although i'm no expert i do work in patent law.

First of all, let me tell you what we currently have now in Europe (in the larger sense).

CURRENTLY 

Currently, the system regarding patent applications is made so that when you file a patent application with the aim of targetting European countries (other than your own), you file it at the EPO (European Patent Office). After the examination process is complete, and your patent is granted by the EPO, you have to choose in which countries you want to ""validate"" your patent application. In other words, in which countries you want your patent to be enforced. This is an extremely costly part of the procedure, as for most countries you have to translate either some parts or the whole patent. On top of that, renewal fees are paid each year in each country in which you validate the European patent application. 

Countries included in the EPO are more numerous than the EU, as Turkey, Norway and Iceland belong to the EPO as well (38 countries in total i believe but feel free to check). 

In each country the patent is validated, you have a separate patent. Meaning if you validate the European patent application in DE, FR and DK, you have three different patents although they are the same in terms of claims (the monopoly granted). 

In turn, this means that if an action in court is taken, a separate action must be done in each country where the European Patent application has been validated. This, again, is an extremely costly procedure as you can imagine.

On top of that, although it depends on European countries, the judges in most countries are non-technician, meaning they do not understand the state of the technology described in the patents.

UNIFIED PATENT AND UNIFIED JURISDICTION

The proposal on which you are voting is aiming to integrate further the different patent laws of the different EU countries. 

The application process will be the same at the EPO, but, once the patent is granted, you will be able to choose a new path : the unified patent. 

The unified patent requires a translation of a small part of the patent application in only one other language (one of the official languages of the EPO, German, French or English). 

The unified patent has its effect in all EU countries (but not the 38 of the EPO due to jurisdiction issues) except Spain and Italy who have opted out for now. As such, the renewal fees to maintain the patent are drastically reduced (should be somewhere between 3-8x the median renewal fee) for a 26-ish country protection.

The Unified Patent Jurisdiction is the last part. When a Unified Patent will be in court, there will only be one action for the whole EU, meaning much less costs for the procedure BUT much more risk that you lose all at once. 

The final (and best, to me at least) part is that in those UP courts, several judges will rule on the cases, with the majority of them being technical experts in the field and not law experts.

I feel i've over simplified but this is the main idea. I hope everything was clear. If not, do ask!

The UPC is a badly designed system for implementing and enforcing a single European patent. Currently when the European Patent Office approves an application, it becomes a bundle of national patents. These national patents are enforced individually and may even be revoked by one nation's courts but not another's.

Having a single European patent is wonderful in principle. We'd be more like the USA, and the translation costs (which are huge) of the current system would be vastly reduced.

The unitary patent system has many flaws, however. Particularly the fact that ""validity"" and ""infringement"" will be judged by different courts. The result that will affect consumers is that if I hold a patent and I think X is copying my patented idea, I can sue for infringement in one court who will grant an injunction (i.e. Stop X selling their goods anywhere in Europe) while that court sends the case to another court to test validity. This can take years. Meanwhile, X is totally shafted across all of Europe, even if my claim that they are infringing my patent turns out to be false.

The system is a ""worst of all positions"" compromise. Given the work being done on machine translation, the big costs it will avoid will become small-costs in a few years anyway. I'd vote against, if my government gave me a choice. The current system works and, despite its flaws, is better than the compromise the EU hammered out. The unitary patent won't replace the old system (thank goodness) so it's just another layer of bureaucracy lying about.

N.B. the European Patent Office is not an EU organisation, and it covers more countries than just the EU.

EDIT: the average citizen will only notice if a product they sell or a product they want is sued by a unitary-patent owner. Then that product may be banned in Europe for years while the courts sort it out. Currently, the same court will decide validity and infringement, so injunctions against selling are much shorter if they happen at all.",0,1398847268,null,0,false,0,ch5u0lu,t3_24co41,t1_ch5u0lu,t3_24co41,null,1433586554,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

&gt;___Manifold: Time___ is a 1999 science fiction novel by [Stephen Baxter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Baxter). It is the first of Baxter's *Manifold* trilogy (the others being *[Manifold: Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold:_Space)* and *[Manifold: Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold:_Origin)*), although the books can be read in any order because the series takes place in a [multiverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universe_(fiction\)).

&gt;The book was nominated for the 2000 [Arthur C. Clarke Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke_Award).

Inoltre, tranne la tribuna, non esiste un solo angolo dello stadio dove la partita si guarda seduti. Poi, se vai in curva, e vuoi cantare un coro non condiviso dal capetto del settore, non puoi. Se quando loro cantano ti girano le palle e non puoi, DEVI cantare con loro. Accampano diritti sulle campagne acquisti, giudicano i calciatori e pretendono di deciderne le sorti.

I don't want to get into too much detail but the point is, before capitalism in the 19th century a lot of people were self employed farmers or shopkeepers and then most people became employees, had no chance to compete.

The idea of be an employee, want a regulated economy vs. be self-employeed and be libertarian is very closely linked everywhere. In the US the Libertarian Party mainly attracts self-employed voters. In the US a very low population density allowed people in the past who were fed up with employement to become homesteader farmers. Over here we have so high pop density that you cannot walk 10 km without hitting a village.

Even when self-employment became rarer in the US, it still stayed a dream.

Here, not so. The whole idea of working class movements, labor movements, socialist movements was based on ""class consciousness"" and that basically meant ""You will NEVER be self-employed, forget it, so just fight for better employment options and welfare.""

Once you have an employement based economy, instead of a self employed one, unemployment is a huge problem.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well, that is not exactly the history of the thing. Basic needs as human rights is a very recent phenomenon and it is kind of a later, human-faced explanation to something that emerged for entirely different reason.

The problem originates in the fact that the rise of capitalism and high population densities (i.e. Europeans could not just go and homestead some land like Americans) made self-employment practically impossible, people had to be employees to survive.

When you have no chance to self employment and think you will have to be an employee forever, that is called ""class consciousness"" and it created all kinds of radical socialist, communist, anarchist movements with really crazy ideas like abolishing all private property (which would lead to violent  chaos) or nationalizing all the stuff (which in the Soviet model was pretty shitty). 

Then two _conservatives_, Bismarck and Disraeli figured that basically to prevent this disaster from happening, you have to make workers happier by redistributing income, consumption, and if you do that then they will accept the structure on the whole i.e. private property structures and being employees of other people. They figured out that workers are less interested in taking over the factory if they can just basically get more of the profits. And they were right - social democracy very succesfully outcompeted socialism, communism and anarchism.

Essential human rights is really an anachronistic explanation. We just call it so today to make it seem like it is just based on all niceness and compassion and everybody totally being a Good Guy Greg. It was actually about preventing yet another Soviet type mess or some even worse anarchist mess. To be perfectly honest - in everyday life people are not really that compassionate and very few people feel they are being all empathic and have that warm glow of moral goodness around the heart when they look at the paycheck with all the tax and social security deductions. Promises of tax cuts are totally a normal part of European politics. Today the whole thing is just an institution that is mostly accepted because it _established_, like a tradition or custom.

I think I know what Zizek means and in this sense I don't believe in these values. I think aristocratic values were better in every possible way.  But there is a problem: it seems we cannot really go back to the aristocratic systems that existed before modernity. Every time we try we basically get fascism instead.

I don't know why. I would prefer aristocratic hierarchies over égaliberté, but obviously I prefer égaliberté over fascism because frankly fascism just the same kind of crass, vulgar mass-man herd movement as égaliberté, except that it is evil and cruel. Basically both fascists and liberal democrats with left-wing social progressive values come from Jacobins. There is only the herd.

So at this point I have no idea who to support really.

I think in the longer run égaliberté will not be sustainable, immigration and xenophobia will tear it apart. I think mainstream European politicians don't understand just how huge is the instict of _ethnic_ nationalism under the surface. The herd always wants its _own_ herd. People are multicultural as long as things go well but instantly become tribal when not. True internationalism is an aristocratic thing (read e.g. Tolstoy, Anna Karenina) and it is not an aristocratic age, precisely because of égaliberté. So I think sooner or later égaliberté is out.  But as a return to aristocratism is not really possible, probably some kind of fascism will take its place and that is fairly terrible. 

I could only recommend one thing. Don't marginalize the extremist right-wing parties, but more like try to negotiate with them. That way when they eventually win, as that seems almost unavoidable in the longer run, they might be less angry, thus more merciful and less cruel.

Opinion polls don't indicate this to be the case. From 2012:

&gt;Nearly seven out of ten Irish people now want the inflow of foreign nationals to be curtailed fearing that further new arrivals will strain the social welfare system. The poll was conducted after it was revealed in the Sunday Independent last week that the number of foreign nationals on the Live Register is now about 80,000 -- or around 20 per cent of the total. Asked: ""Do you think Ireland, in line with most other European countries, should restrict immigrants from new EU accession countries?"" 67 per cent of respondents replied Yes and 33 per cent answered No.

true,Silocon,null,null,"I really enjoy it. It's a desk job and, in engineering/physical sciences, you'll look at 2-10 cases a day. In general in each case there's an invention and prior art (usually earlier patents). You have to study the prior art, understand the invention, and figure out how the new invention is different and inventive. Then you write a letter to the patent office explaining the differences. Then you do the same on the next case, which is probably a totally different invention. E.g. one day last week I dealt with an aircraft engine, antibacterial textiles, and a 4G mobile signalling invention.

There is a lot of law and protocol to learn and it's a career run by deadlines. Some of the law you quickly learn the purpose of, other stuff is just a shitload of procedure about fees, filling requirements, deadlines, etc. That side of the job is significantly different from most engineering jobs, so it takes time and effort to get, but eventually it becomes second-nature. The professional exams are really hard, 50% pass rate on each paper which, remember, every candidate has been studying towards for years. But you can ""bank"" the passed papers and retake the failed ones next year.

The money is good once you've qualified and most trainees, associates and partners only work 40-45 hours/week (not bad for 6 figures once a partner!). The deadlines can be stressful, especially when you're a trainee and so someone else has to sign off all your work, so if they're busy/slow/away, you can get really pushed up against the deadline.

It's quite international, I deal with American, Scandinavian, Chinese, Japanese and Australian clients. That can be frustrating on the language issue :p

Welfare is necessary to avoid a huge divide in income which is the main source of crime. Europeans happen to kill each other less than Americans, it's one of the reasons Americans see a necessity in gun-carry, whilst European oppose it.

Welfare is also a security, for when things go wrong. You're worse off in the US than in Europe if you get involved in an accident.

Welfare is also a security for entrepreneurs,  who can actually fallback when things don't go as planned.

Random selection of people: This is a flawed method. E.g you do it on a tuesday in my local town and thats Soical Welfare day thus the majority of people you come in contact with will be mainly from a select group. Same with Thursday as that is pension day and thus the majority of people you encounter will be OAPs and thus once again are not getting fair rep.


Targeted group of people: Selecting a traget group of people to poll to suit the ""FACT"" you want to prove and thus not getting fair rep.


Fair rep: The best selection as you seek out a fair rep of the population based on already known facts. I.e using the CSO figures to establish how many of person a-z you should ask to make up a full rep of the population. 



Thus any poll can be fudged. Anyway you posted the topic for a discussion and going by your past posts, you are looking for a fight and a platform to get your views aired.

A few quotes from you.

""Wait until you see the problems mass immigration will inevitably cause.""


""You will be lucky if there is an EU in a decade or so. Never mind adding the Turks and the Canucks into the equation.""


""What has the above got to do with the laws in Europe? Take your soapbox back to Canada. I think you just came here to have your opinions justified. A quick trawl through your posts and I find this in response to a chap from Quebec. That's hate speech. You seem confused.""


I can go through your posts too and its not pretty either. Anyway have a nice day and I am very up to date on the science behind polling!

true,quitesnail,earth,,"Hehe, vedendo il tuo menù mattutino ci sarebbero un sacco di cose da dire! Ma non sono qui per fare il predicatore di uno stile di vita sano, quindi mi attengo a quanto richiesto. 

Nonostante io non ne beva per niente, non sono contro un succo di frutta al mattino. Sono contro la tendenza di avere sempre una bibita dolce in tavola, in frigo, nello zaino. 
Molti succhi ormai sono 100% frutta, limitando quello che in passato era il problema 'acqua sporca con zucchero', ma rimane il problema, nella mia personale visione, che creano una specie di dipendenza per i prodotti processati. Sì, 100% ananas, allora perché non mangiarti un pezzo di ananas? L'ananas vera ti ti sazia, è fresca, ha vitamine, in più allena quella che è la percezione del cibo vero, cosa che ultimamente si sta un po' perdendo. E questo si collega anche al discorso economico, perché considerando che si dovrebbero bere 1.5-2 litri di acqua al giorno, ci rendiamo conto come bersi un litro di succo di frutta sia estremamente facile, soprattutto nei bambini ed adolescenti che sono portati a preferirli all'acqua. Questo comporta un consumo maggiore, che trasforma il succo da 'bevanda ricreativa' a 'praticamente risorsa d'acqua' e fa riempire le dispense delle famiglie di questi liquidi zuccherini e colorati. Inoltre sì, è frutta, ma se non mi mangio un kg di ananas in un giorno ci sarà un motivo? Invece un litro di succo d'ananas scende facilmente, e sono 450 kCal di **soli zuccheri**, che sfuggono alla percezione di sazietà, e quindi contribuiscono ad un introito calorico maggiore.

È un discorso probabilmente più interessante e profondo di come l'ho espresso io, e sicuramente non interessa a chi si beve un succo di frutta al mattino per ingranare, ma è rivolto a chi vedo ogni tanto nei grossi supermercati con carrelli pieni di succhi.

So it is just egotism. And the weirdest part is that despite it being individualistic, it just ends up with everybody being the same kind of mass man with slightly different hobbies.

By aristocratic values I mean a general ethic of living to serve higher goals than yourself due to a sense of gratitude and loyalty, and yet being more individuated because as you strive for self-improvement you end up serving those goals probably different than others. 

Knight in English, just like samurai in Japanese, essentially means ""servant"".  

The movie The Last Samurai gets it perfectly. The peasant is largely serving only because he is forced, and otherwise he would live for his own pleasure - égaliberté. The samurai does it willingly, out of an internal sense of duty, and is not uncritical - sometimes he can serve best by actually refusing orders and rebelling against the higher-ups, because his service ethic is bound with a sense of fully being an individual who makes his own choices.

&gt;The years 1948 to 1952 saw the fastest period of growth in European history. Industrial production increased by 35%. Agricultural production substantially surpassed pre-war levels. The poverty and starvation of the immediate postwar years disappeared, and Western Europe embarked upon an unprecedented two decades of growth that saw standards of living increase dramatically. There is some debate among historians over how much this should be credited to the Marshall Plan. Most reject the idea that it alone miraculously revived Europe, as evidence shows that a general recovery was already underway. Most believe that the Marshall Plan sped this recovery, but did not initiate it. The United States worked to direct the Marshall Plan towards children and an increase of nutritional material for all citizens within western Europe so as to shed a positive light on its goals as it worked to effectively defeat communist threats. One effect of the plan was that it subtly ""Americanized"" countries, **especially Austria**, who embraced United States' assistance, through popular culture, such as Hollywood movies and rock n' roll.

Si la France avait ses frontières, on augmenterait la production sur notre territoire (TVA sur l'importation pour équilibrer les différences de salaire dans les secteurs où l'on souhaite plus de sécurité, qui ne peuvent pas être compétitifs, typiquement les secteurs à bas salaire), donc plus d'emploi, ce qui me parait être une bonne chose pour la France.

&gt;Okay. What is wrong with this?

Just about everything? Pretty much every classical philosopher and every religion and even some branches of modern psychology taught that feeding your ego will not make you happy.  This is where wisdom _begins_, by understanding that fulfilling one desire after the other just cannot be the point of life. 

I could give a million quotes here, but I will just stick to psychiatrist Viktor Frankl now:

“Only to the extent that someone is living out this self transcendence of human existence is he truly human or does he become his true self. He becomes so, not by concerning himself with his self's actualization, but by forgetting himself and giving himself, overlooking himself and focusing outward.”

&gt;Why would you want that? 

Because it makes you forget about your own ego and that is the key.

Because if you focus on our own desires we become the kind of people we are today - irritable, petty, indifferent,  etc. et c.

&gt;What are those higher goals?

Anything more important than yourself. Usually a form of service to a group of people - family, dynasty, tribe, ethny, nation, civilization, maybe humankind, although that is a bit too big.

true,Kisolya,EURO,YURP,"&gt; Pretty much every classical philosopher and every religion and even some branches of modern psychology taught that feeding your ego will not make you happy.

I'm not interested in what they theorize, I'm interested in what is proven. People are happier when they have goals to pursue but regardless of what the goal may be, so long as [they consider it meaningful](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dont-delay/200806/goal-progress-and-happiness). Thus it's not tied to this idea of it being ""above oneself"", and other such talk.

&gt; This is where wisdom begins, by understanding that fulfilling one desire after the other just cannot be the point of life. 

You're right, but because there is no point to life, not that we are focusing on the wrong one.

&gt;  Because it makes you forget about your own ego and that is the key.

The key to what exactly?

&gt; Because if you focus on our own desires we become the kind of people we are today - irritable, petty, indifferent, etc. et c.

""We"" are not any such thing. ""I"" certainly am not any of those while I do in fact focus on my own desires. It's not enough to simply make a statement, you have to back it up somehow. You've given me no reason to believe the pursuit of my desires makes me in any particular way.

&gt; Anything more important than yourself. Usually a form of service to a group of people - family, dynasty, tribe, ethny, nation, civilization, maybe humankind, although that is a bit too big.

And exactly why are *those* goals the higher ones? How is this justified?

&gt; That's what happens when?

I mean that you get a ""general ethic of living to serve higher goals"" from a ""sense of gratitude and loyalty"". And what happens when those higher goals end up being something completely different than what you imagined? What happens when they end up being racial supremacy? That can be a higher goal too if you want it to.

true,Pokymonn,MOLD,Moldova,"There is no point in reuniting with Romania. Their Romanian population is slowly, but steadily being replaced by Rroma. Just in the present, the Rroma population is believed to be formed of ~2.8 million people (look at EU statistics and not the one done by their state). It is estimated that by 2050 the population of Romania would represent at around 15 million people, out of whom 30-40% would be Rroma.
Considering that they are a different ethnic/cultural/linguistic group, there isn't any reason for the people of both countries to live in one country.

I used to be a unification supporter, until I started to look into the demographics of Romania.

What is more likely to happen though, is for parts of Romania to vocalise secessionist movements. For instance, the eastern part may try to join Moldova at some point in the future, when the demographic situation could become chaotic in the southern and central parts of the country.

*Il sindacato Sap avvia la distribuzione. Registrerà audio e video durante le manifestazioni*


RIMINI Non sono, e non vogliono essere, novelli James Bond, ma solo utilizzare i mezzi tecnologici più opportuni per provare, se e quando occorre, ed occorre spesso, la loro innocenza in caso di accuse infondate. Al Congresso nazionale del Sap, Sindacato autonomo di polizia, che si concluderà oggi a Rimini, oltre che di spending review e di unificazione delle forze di polizia, si è parlato di Spy-pen, una piccola penna da mettere nel taschino degli agenti di polizia, con incorporata una microscopica telecamera in grado di riprendere ciò che accade durante le manifestazioni di piazza e non solo. In Emilia Romagna il Sap, che dei vari sindacati di polizia è quello più ""movimentista"", ha dotato 800 agenti di Spy-pen. L’intenzione è quella di fornire lo stesso strumento a tutti i loro 1800 iscritti nella regione e contemporaneamente di estenderlo nel Lazio e nelle regioni dove gli scontri che vede protagonista la polizia sono maggiori. Inoltre si sta lavorando per dotare di Spy-pen tutti i poliziotti che fanno ordine pubblico e pronto intervento. Il costo di ogni singola penna varia da 30 a 50 euro. Soldi che spesso provengono dai cittadini. È a loro, infatti, che il Sap, attraverso una capillare distribuzione di volantini, si è rivolto per chiedere un sostegno concreto, puntualmente arrivato. Ma perché la Spy-pen? A spiegarlo è lo stesso sindacato in un vademecum distribuito al congresso con il quale ci si chiede: chi difende i difensori? Accade spesso, infatti, che le persone fermate dalla polizia, perché spacciano o perché sono senza permesso di soggiorno, si procurino ferite da sole. La conseguenza è che l’agente che effettua il fermo viene spesso denunciato e da ""testimone"" si trasforma in imputato di reato connesso. E così chi ha commesso il reato la fa franca e il poliziotto finisce nei guai, oltre che in una spiacevole gogna mediatica. La Spy-pen impedirà che ciò accada, perché ogni intervento della polizia sarà video-fono-registrato. Un «sistema difensivo» che smaschererà le accuse infondate. Come si legge nel loro vademecum, «i poliziotti non chiedono sconti relativamente alle loro responsabilità ma non possono essere condannati per quelle degli altri». Inoltre c’è la consapevolezza che «il sistema Italia non tutela come dovrebbe gli operatori di polizia», e questo porta l’agente a «indugiare» e avere «meno spirito d’iniziativa». Da qui la scelta di «uno strumento di verità e giustizia in grado di provare inequivocabilmente la loro innocenza». Un mezzo tecnologico che «fornirà prove indiscutibili in giudizio al fine di certificare la reale dinamica degli eventi». Uno strumento di cui non si gioveranno solo i poliziotti, ma anche «il circuito mediatico e i cittadini che saranno nelle condizioni di conoscere la verità, e la magistratura, a cui potranno essere forniti elementi preziosi per le loro determinazioni».

Ernsthaft, ich frag mich grade echt was mit dir los ist.

by the way:

&gt;die Menschen dort entsprechende Gesetze erlassen, sich somit frei dafür entschieden haben.

Die Gesetze sind schon älter und kein einziger heute lebender Mensch hat daran das kleinste Wörtchen mitgesprochen. Noch dazu hat an diesen Gesetzen zur  Entstehungszeit wohl auch nur eine kleine ""Elite"" gearbeitet.

Insofern steht also sowieso schonmal die demokratische Legitimierung des Gesetzes zu Debatte, aber das nur nebenbei.

Was nämlich **immer** -auch innergesellschaftlich- zu Debatte steht ist die *ethische* Legitimierung.

No.

Well then you're simply wrong. It is not shocking to me. Perhaps your acquired mind reading abilities are not what they advertised.

&gt; Trying to isolate russia, antagonize it, support change of governement in its sphere of influence. Its not our business.

Isolating Russia both diplomatically and economically has become an issue in the EU after what Russia has done and is doing, because that's what we - as a community - can do to counter Russia's aggressive policies and actions.

BTW, Russia's claimed 'sphere of influence' is very much debatable and it certainly does not exceed sovereign countries to choose their own future nor justify illegally invading and annexing them.

From takeaways and taxis

While some sell the Big Issue

Some kill with knives and axes.

And don't have any wings

They'll welcome you to Britain and

They'll give you lots of things.

The random selection method is flawed: I.e what I said above or another example is calling people on there home phones during the day etc, because the Majority of the people working would be in work and not at home so I know its flawed, I think the whole Poll system is flawed.



So is the targeted group, its using data you know to prove a point by fudging the ""Random"" poll.



Now though the Fair representation: The best selection as you seek out a fair representation of the population based on already known facts. I.e using the CSO figures to establish how many of person a-z you should ask to make up a full rep of the population.

This is what should be used for polling as it takes the whole population as a % of the sample.

So let's say you have 100 people in a country, 40 female and 60 male, and you're looking to see how many like cheese but you only can collect data for 10 as funding is an issue! To get a fair representation you ask 4 females and 6 males and this gives you the fair representation in your poll for the whole populations. Multiply this by 10, 20, 50 or 100 and as long as you are sticking to the facts you already know then the data should be as true as possible. 


This is just an example and the IRL situation is more complex but this is a simple example.

________________________
Außerdem komme Ich immer noch nicht auf deine reduzierte und zu pauschale Logik klar.

Du machst ja grade so, als wären alle Länder basisdemokratische ""Superorganismen"". Dass das falsch ist, ist selbstverständlich.

Es bleibt offen, ob -bzw in welchem Grad- ein staatliches Gesetz Rückhalt in der Bevölkerung hat. Nimm zb die Gesetzeslage bzgl der Geheimdienste. Glaubst du die Bevölkerung deckt das?

Und selbst dann bleibt weiterhin bleibt offen, ob ein majorum zu ""guten"" Ergebnissen kommen kann. Die Geschichte zur Genüge gezeigt, wie sehr sich die Masse der Bevölkerung (ver)irren kann. Und Ich rede nicht nur vom dritten Reich.

Was denkst du, wieso wir (zumindest noch in der heutigen Zeit) nur eine repräsentative Demokratie haben?

Und -jetzt wirds ein wenig philosophisch- je nachdem welchen Ansatz man bzgl Erkenntnistheorie und allgemein ""Wahrheiten"" verfolgt, kann man jetzt schon behaupten, eine Position wäre ""richtiger"" als eine andere - wenn man schon nicht sagt, dass es eine absolut richtige Position zu einem Sachverhalt gibt.

Ich behaupte jedenfalls, dass nach der Diskussion um Todesstrafe im letzten Jahrhundert in Europe die wohl bestmögliche Erkenntnis zu dem Thema durchgedrungen ist. Deshalb ist die Todestrafe in unseren Gefilden weitgehend verschwunden.

Weiterhin behaupte Ich, dass es nur eine Frage der Zeit ist, bis die Todesstrafe vom Rest dieses Globus verbannt ist. Weil sie **objektiv** einfach **falsch**, oder -je nach philosophischen Standpunkt- **eher falsch** ist.

**Edit:**

An der Stelle ist der Einwurf des ursprünglichen Zitats auch wieder ganz interessant: Das ""Wir"" -hab ich je bereits gesagt- zielt auf das menschliche Kollektiv ab.

Auch hab ich bereits gesagt, das Ich nicht finde, dass da ein Eingriff in die Souveränität gefordert ist, sondern so etwas ähnliches wie die Kritik an fehlender menschlicher Vernunft.

Das setzt natürlich vorraus, dass der Kritiker die Todesstrafe als objektiv und universal falsch ansieht. Da kann man jetzt natürlich auch wieder diskutieren, und so weiter...

Absurde et totalement infondé. Les fameux ""banquiers de la City"" se battent bec et ongles pour éviter tout ce qui pourrait ressembler à une mise au pas par la réglementation européenne. Les spéculateurs de Wall Street sont à Manhattan, pas sur le rond-point Schuman. Quant aux fameux ""bureaucrates de Bruxelles"" je me demande bien de qui on parle: le président de la Commission européenne est désigné par les Etats membres et comme les commissaires est approuvé par le Parlement; et les actes législatifs produits par la Commission doivent être adoptés par le Conseil (regroupant les Etats membres) et le Parlement. Le fonctionnement des institutions européennes pourrait bien sûr être amélioré, mais il repose sur les parlementaires élus par les citoyens et les gouvernements nationaux responsables devant les parlements nationaux élus.

Je pense qu'une partie du problème vient de l'attachement viscéral des français à une forme de politique mystique, fantasmée et purement déclarative.

issue?

in what sense? which EU high ranking politician is calling for sanctions? Why pretend all EU nations want to go that way? Why pretend that pipeline somehow tight hands of people on this?

as you said - debatable, especially in the real world where just claiming something is *bad* is moot.

true,quantum-confinement,MOLD,Moldova,"&gt; Moldova is growing faster at the moment just because it's poor and there is room from growth. But just think about it - the more it grows, the slower and slower it gets.

Exactly, this is what I meant by convergence. It is also the reason Moldova is growing faster than Romania at the moment, simply because it is significantly poorer and has much more room to grow. However, Moldova is (slowly) catching up to Romania rather than going in the opposite direction, which you suggested. 

&gt;Do you really think that major banks and huge companies would base themselves in our region ? Definitely not. It's too unstable and precarious. There would be too many risks. 

I absolutely agree. Moldova as an isolated economic entity is an absurdity. This is why I support reunification with Romania and otherwise a stronger integration with the unified European market. 

&gt;The only reason I'm supporting reunification is the well-being of Moldovans themselves. If you guys don't want this and can manage on your own, then I'm fine with it. 

Again, I support unification with Romania, but I don't think Moldova's future perspective even as an independent country is completely hopeless. Moldova's economy reached its low point in the late 90s, but is now at least steadily growing. Of course the economy is still shit and significant structural reforms need to be undertaken in creating a freer and more transparent business climate and reducing corruption, but I am hopeful that Moldova's process of becoming more integrated into the EU will steadily improve this situation. Hopefully such a development will make any future unification that much smoother and mutually advantageous.

Ce n'est pas une idée absurde. L'Allemagne ou la Belgique qui ont fait le choix de soutenir un tissu de PME exportatrices et innovantes ont assez bien résisté à la crise et ont vu leur production repartir rapidement, notamment grâce au chômage partiel qui a épargné des licenciements douloureux en attendant la reprise. La France a par contre choisi de privilégier les grands ""champions nationaux"" pour couvrir tous les domaines de l'industrie d'après-guerre, et découvre aujourd'hui que leur loyauté est acquise aux actionnaires et pas à l'Etat. C'est notamment dû à l'obsession française d'avoir sous contrôle des ""secteurs stratégiques"", et d'avoir notre propre compagnie pétrolière, nos constructeurs automobiles, nos géants agro-alimentaires et pharmaceutiques, nos producteurs d'armement...

&gt; par dumping social, un ouvrier Polonais, Roumain ou même Allemand* travail pour une fraction de ce que gagne un ouvrier Français

C'est une façon de voir les choses. Moi quand je lis ""dumping social"" je comprends ""ils font rien qu'à être plus compétitifs que nous"". C'est juste du butthurt. Donc on fait quoi ? On pleurniche que les polonais, les chinois et les indonésiens refusent d'appliquer notre droit du travail et notre fiscalité, ou on se bouge pour gagner en compétitivité ? 

On peut déplorer que l'Union européenne soit le choix du libre-échange dans une économie sociale de marché. Les alternatives, c'est le libre-échange sans avoir pour soi le poids réglementaire et commercial représenté par l'Union, ou l'Albanie des années Hoxha.

It really depends on the person. Some people are used to an urban environment and feel bored in the countryside, or the opposite. Others are up for anything that's new, exciting, ""exotic"". If this new girl has chosen to travel then she'll probably enjoy it, especially since you seem to care a lot: it sounds like you'll be doing everything you can to make her feel welcomed. Another important factor is her motivation to improve her english. And maybe her ability to fully immerse herself into her new life (instead of spending her time online chatting with her relatives in France for instance). It really boils down to her motivation and maturity I think. 


If you can, try to exchange a few emails before she arrives so that you get to know each other in advance. Then you'll either like each other or not.

Per fare un libro devi mantenere delle foreste di alberi specificatamente coltivati per quello (specie che crescono veloci) e poi devi produrre la carta, che se non è sbiancatissima non è neanche molto inquinante da produrre. E che in ogni caso è riciclabile. L'oggetto risultante inoltre non diventa obsoleto, non è strettamente personale, dura decenni -al minimo-.
Credimi, non sono un luddista, ma tutto questo per cosa esattamente? Forse che adesso che hai gli ereader leggi di più?

Per quanto riguarda la macchina, abito a Milano e sono 5 anni che non ho più un auto. Tutti hanno il diritto di fare quello che vogliono dei propri soldi, e se c'è un'esigenza specifica non sarò certo io a fare la solita sparata becera dell'usare la bicicletta. Non sono un abbracciaalberi del cazzo. Però mi chiedo, ci sono dei comportamenti che, per quanto rietranti -pienamente- nel novero dei miei diritti, tipo possedere cinque auto, non mi classificano come un povero coglione incapace di calarsi nel contesto nel quale vivo ed incapace di avere una visione di insieme maggiormente votata alla collettività? Io credo di si, e le n auto a famiglia sono precisamente uno di questi. Inoltre, i verdi mi staranno anche sul cazzo, ma l'aria la respiro io come loro. Tu cosa respiri invece, idrocaburi?

Al riguardo di televisioni e cellulari, certo, non c'è una legge che ci obbliga a cambiarli. Ma ci sono gli ecosistemi nel quale essi funzionano e una cosa chiamata obsolescenza pianificata. Io posso anche non cambiare il cellulare una volta all'anno (mediamente lo faccio ogni 3 anni), ma se attorno a me tutti usano solo whatsup ed io sono ancora al gsm, a cosa mi serve il cellulare? E se lo cambio e poi la batteria interna non sostituibile crepa dopo un anno, cosa faccio?

Ja. Weil man sie nicht mit sich rumträgt. 

&gt;* Wenn man nicht selbst mit einer Waffe bedroht wird besteht nicht die Notwendigkeit eine zu benutzen (ausnahme vllt der im Artikel genannte Rollstuhlfahrer), die Fäuste sind reichen vollkommen aus.

Nein, nicht deshalb. Der Grundsatz dazu ist ""niemand muss sich auf einen Kampf mit unsicherem Ausgang einlassen"". Ich bin nicht verpflichtet mich mit einem Angreifer zu schlagen, wenn ich seinen Angriff viel ungefährlicher (für mich) mit einem Schuss beenden kann. 


&gt;* Wer eine Waffe bei sich trägt muss zunächst mal erklären warum das so ist. Warum muss ich einen Schlagstock bei mir tragen? Für den Fall das man angegriffen wird reicht als Begründung übrigens nicht aus. Man geht in der Regel davon aus, dass wer eine Waffe bei sich trägt diese auch benutzen will und geht nicht mehr von Notwehr aus.

Also das deckt sich so nicht mit meinen Erfahrungen. Sowas kann man ohnehin nie so pauschal sagen. Frage des Einzelfalls. 

Wenn jemand illegal eine Waffe zu Hause hat, bei ihm  eingebrochen wird und er auf den Einbrecher schießt, dann spricht da erstmal gar nichts gegen Notwehr. Waffenrecht ist eine andere Frage. 

&gt;* Bonusinfo: Als Waffe können auch normale Gegenstände gelten, vorrausgesetzt es gibt keinen anderen Grund diese mitzunehmen und sie werden halt zum Schlagen o.ä. genutzt. Das kommt wohl auf den Fall an.

Nicht ganz. Das sind dann in der Regel sogenannte ""gefährliche Werkzeuge"". Die werden nur gleich behandelt.

There is freedom of religion in the Declaration, including the freedom to *leave* one's religion. Islam absolutely doesn't allow this, in fact the penalty for apostasy is death. That is probably the biggest issue with it from a fundamentalist Islamic point of view. They also disagree with the equality of marriage.

&gt;And surely the contribution at drafting still counts from both?

There was no input from an Islamic state in drafting them to the best of my knowledge. All the Muslim-majority states involved were strongly opposed to Islam interfering with the secular government and so wouldn't have wanted anything to do with Islam in the document.

Indeed, the Lebanese delegate was a Christian philosopher and theologian who explicitly argued the the document should have a Christian basis in the teachings of St Thomas Aquinas.

There were three communist states involved in the drafting but they all abstained from endorsing the result.

&gt;My main point is it wasn't some malicious action by the west creating them

No, sure it wasn't ""malicious"" but it was an attempt to anchor western liberal values as universal throughout the world. I mean I agree with these values myself, but you have to acknowledge where they came from.

It wasn't exclusively Western, the Chinese delegate PC Chang in particular was one of the most prominent delegates and had a significant impact; article 29 emphasises that everyone has not just rights but also duties to the wider community which is a Confucian ideal. But it was primarily Western values. 

&gt;Very little of it seems parametrically opposed to any particular system of government except totalitarian ones 

Which the USSR and many other countries at the time were, and they weren't particularly happy with it, in particular the article 13 that maintained the right to leave one's home country.

It is at this point hard to properly poll UKIP because nobody knows just how sticky their support is.

true,quantum-confinement,MOLD,Moldova,"&gt; Well, to put things into perspective, Romania had a 3.5% GDP growth last year; to have the same level of increase on their GDP, Moldova will need to experience growth around the 12 to 14% mark (2013 estimates put it at 8-9%).
&gt; 
&gt; I do hope they catch up, but I think it will take them a while. 

In some sense it's the ratio of the two sets of GDP per capita, rather than the absolute difference that is the better quantifier of the economic disparity. So say ten years ago Romania's GDP per capita was more than 4 times as big as Moldova's but now the ratio is a bit less than 3.5. 

In any case though, you are absolutely right, it will take a long time for Moldova to catch up. For example, if Romania's real GDP growth were 3% and Moldova's 7%, even then it would take (1.07/1.03)^#years =3.5  =&gt; just over 30 years for Moldova to fully catch up.

Renseigne toi avant de nier l'évidence.

&gt;Quant aux fameux ""bureaucrates de Bruxelles"" je me demande bien de qui on parle

On parle de ceux qui pondent les milliers de pages de règlements européens et autres normes. Ce ne sont pas des élus ni des gens responsables devant le peuple. 

Quand ils en ont l'occasion, les députés doivent se prononcer à un rythme effréné sur des textes qu'ils ne lisent pas (ils n'ont matériellement pas le temps de lire les 20000 pages annuelles de textes législatifs). Tu parles d'une démocratie.

&gt;Je pense qu'une partie du problème vient de l'attachement viscéral des français à une forme de politique mystique, fantasmée et purement déclarative.

C'est la meilleure. 

Tu es en fait en train de décrire l'UE, qui veut absolument tout réglementer, même [les cafetières électriques](http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2011/08/30/bruxelles-veut-reglementer-la-consommation-des-cafetieres-electriques_1565269_3244.html).

Il faut limiter drastiquement les pouvoir des instances européennes, en particulier en ce qui concerne la monnaie et l'économie. 

L'UE doit consister en une solidarité entre voisins, pas un support pour une concurrence sans limite, chose qu'elle est devenue, en particulier avec les travailleurs détachés, l'évasion fiscale, et l'absurde austérité imposée aux pays de l'Europe du Sud, et maintenant à la France.

&gt;Une étude d'un think-tank allemand s'alarme d'ailleurs de cette illusion très française.

En matière politique, l'histoire a montré que l'Allemagne n'avait de leçon à faire à personne, et encore moins un obscur think tank dont l'absence de légitimité devrait plutôt conduire à de l'humilité.

&gt;seuls contre tous

Déjà réfuté ça. Indépendance n'est pas solitude. La Suisse est seule ? L'Islande est seule ? La Norvège est seule ?

Tu es dans la caricature car la réalité te déplaît. Le fait que l'UE ne soit pas indispensable remet en cause les fondements mêmes de ta vision de la politique.

Malheureusement pour toi, les nations se portent très bien sans l'UE vois-tu.

&gt;Seulement, depuis 1956 et l'humiliante issue de l'aventure franco-britannique à Suez, nos dirigeants ont choisi de placer l'avenir de la puissance française au coeur de l'Union européenne

Réécriture ou méconnaissance de l'histoire ?

Les dirigeants de 1956 étaient tellement incapables que la France a pris son destin en main et a porté le général de Gaulle au pouvoir pendant 10 ans.

L'aurais-tu oublié ? D'ailleurs tu me fais penser [à ses cabris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zufecNrhhLs).",0,1398876250,null,0,false,0,ch631cz,t3_249i9q,t1_ch631cz,t1_ch5zoxy,null,1433590870,1,false,france,t5_2qhjz,1

Multiply over 28 different nations across culture, politics, economies, legal systems, history... The EU's one-size-fits-all is ridiculous.

The thing that makes UKIP such a big focal point on this sub and outside of it is that the only way to get their point across is by drawing attention trough the EU.

&gt;*Can anyone explain to me what Eurosceptics plan to do???*

Atm, the EU-sceptic movement has tbh perfectly honest only really just woken up to the increase in powers of the EU. There's been a minor EU-sceptic movement for a long time, but this rise is really the real beginning. So from that pov, a lot of new support for UKIP derives from various connected issues:

* Austerity and failure of the UK government from the last financial crisis.
* Notice that the EZ are deep in the soup and the EU is possibly worse than our own government.
* Notice that the government does not even listen to the electorate
* Notice that the media seems to be a propaganda branch of the government too
* A major indication of this has been ""mass immigration"".
* Combining both of these: The government has lied repeatedly on dealing with immigration and dealing with promises of a referendum; as we're coming up to the landmark year of 2015 which is precisely 40 years since our first and only referendum to remain in the EEC (post-legislative referendum) in 1975.
* Since then anyone &lt;57yo which is &gt;50% of the population of 64m ie &gt;32 million people have never voted on EU membership since it's changed from ESCC -&gt; EEC -&gt; EC -&gt; EU ? -&gt; USE ?

Ok that gets us up to speed. So with recent EU talk of a Federal United States of Europe to cope with the EZ crisis we're seeing the poor GIIPS people suffering much worse than the UK is and the UK is already fed-up itself (at least a lot are), then UKIP have arrived on the scene and they're an alternative, they're a green shoot of new growth and hope that the people can reclaim politics and democracy and that also means sovereignty too as the major parties all appear to be in cahoots to stop the UK leaving the EU trying all the tricks in the book.

So, for a lot of EU-sceptics they're not even to where you are asking yet!!

&gt;*Like what's there master plan ??*

Hence there is no ""master plan"" yet for most EU-sceptics... To explain further once UKIP become a viable option for people to consider then this changes everything if that becomes permanent fixture: The rise of a new party would be historic in British politics and start to set the agenda for all the other parties. Only then... only then... will the discussion on EU-Sceptics turn to the next question which is:

&gt;**What does Brexit look like?**

This has very little exposure despite the recent [IEA Brexit Prize](http://www.iea.org.uk/brexit) (very low key)

&gt;*I mean I know some want there nation to leave the EU but then what ?*

So according to polls:

* majority want a referendum ie a democratic chance to have their say on Eu membership
* However it's balanced on how many want to leave because it's a huge step and scary.
* But people know the Establishment (major parties are all Pro-EU) and that is a sign that people are distrustful of yet they exert a lot of influence controlling the media etc.
* So if EU-sceptics get to this stage they will have to convince everyone that leaving is better for the UK.

All this means however the EU-sceptics need more representation in the UK Parliament ""Westminster"". So it seems likely:

1. UKIP win the EU Elections
2. Become an established force
3. Gain some Ministers for Parliament in the General Election 2015.
4. Atst EU goes for Fiscal/Banking Union and ""federalism""
5. The UK people will hear more about ""Brexit"" (Britain's exit from the EU)
6. Referendum will become inevitable as the pressure grows. Sometime around 2020 possibly.

&gt;*I've heard what UKIPs ideas are but the UK has more options then some other EU nations.*

Because of George Soros and the ERM the UK government could never convince the UK people to join the (doomed) EURO. Hence the UK is in a far stronger position to Brexit than other EZ countries. Secondly as one of the major economies in the EU the UK is powerful enough to exit and confident enough to do so.

However to undo 40 years of ""EU"" membership means any Brexit will need to be very careful. The best option therefore (this is not as widely accepted or known yet as it will be) is called:

**The Norway Option**

Which means joining the EEA. This means some powers returned, and easier negotiation of a standard model that already exists and single market access.

Seeing as in my guest role as the dark lord sith of EU-scepticism on /r/europe I'm possibly ahead of the game than most EU-sceptics are, so that I think the clearest answer you'll get (unless a more powerful dark lord sith appears on the scene to steal my thunder!). Once this option becomes more popularized I think the British will choose it (unless the EU comes up with a superior Associate Membership Status alternative - doubtful it will be better). It brings back:

* Democracy
* Sovereignty
* Self-Determination of our Nation via
* Major Policy Powers returned

Of course the battle is only just begun then both on leaving the EU and on finding a self-government system that is not full of incompetent liars who have betrayed the people like we have atm! ;) For some

Why *should* I boycott EP elections entirely? Do you think I am somehow immoral because I vote UKIP? There are some people who don't vote out of laziness or apathy. It is impossible to distinguish between a boycotted no-vote and an apathy no-vote. And if I didn't vote, I wouldn't get an MEP able to represent me in the way I want.

Those from the continent should not be able to just get on with business if part of the electorate does not want them to do that business. When doing business they need to remember that not everyone wants that business. UKIP MEPs is a good reminder of this.

No, they get the same allowances that all other MEPs get and they also have costs. Also, when you say ""milk the EU"", I think you mean ""milk the EU tax-payer"". EUsceptics are EU tax-payers in the same way as EUphiles are, so have just as much right to ""milk the EU"" as EUphiles do. 

Also, if I don't want my representative to show up to a committee, she shouldn't do that. This does not explain why you think I am immoral.

&gt; But if I had your position (UK out of EU), I would not fuck it up for others to get what I want.

You haven't explained why it fucks it up for others. In what way are others fucked up by the existence of UKIP MEPs? In a democracy, others should have to acknowledge that there are views different from their own. That isn't being fucked up.

&gt; If there was a national campaign to boycott the elections, which UKIP could have led instead of going to the EU and taking MEP paychecks, and there was a discernable drop in voter participation, it would achieve the exact same outcome.

It really would not have had the same outcome. There would have been no way of knowing how many people had boycotted or how many people just had not voted out of apathy.

You need to remember that EU funds and EU time and spots on committees belongs to EUsceptics just as much as they belong to EUphiles. EUsceptics pay into the pot too and with that taxation should come representation and money and time too. You might think that UKIP MEPs is a waste of funds, I might differ. That is why both of us get a vote, so both of our opinions can be represented. 

&gt; Why not just not sign up to be part of the committee in the first place then, instead of guaranteeing worse outcomes for the rest of the EU and wasting EU funds?

You've not shown that it does guarantee a worse outcome for the rest of the EU. And I've already made the point about funds. These are the funds of everyone in the EU, both EUphiles and EUsceptics. It would be unfair if only EUphiles had access to them. The committee spots are for everyone, not just for EUphiles. Excluding part of the electorate from them would be very undemocratic.

So fix that, instead of imposing waste and inefficiency on the rest of the EU to send your message to your national politicians. This is a national problem for the UK, and I know you're a big proponent of subsidiarity everywhere else, so why not here?

[Wikipedia Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_brigades#Nashi_involvement)

&gt;In January 2012 a group that presented itself as the Russian wing of the Anonymous published a massive collection of what they claimed to be e-mails of former and present leaders of the pro-Kremlin youth organization Nashi (including a number of government officials). Journalists who investigated the leaked information discovered numerous references to an army of paid commenters that reportedly operated in the fall of 2011. **According to the e-mails, members of the ""brigades"" were paid 85 rubles (about 3 US dollars) or more per comment, depending on whether the comment received replies; some were presented with iPads.** A number of high-profile bloggers were also mentioned as being paid for promoting Nashi's and government activities. The Federal Youth Agency whose head (and the former leader of Nashi) Vasily Yakemenko was the highest-ranking individual targeted by the leaks refused to comment on authenticity of the e-mails.

Extract from the abstract:

&gt;We tested the effects of these alternative diets and found that halving the consumption of meat, dairy products and eggs in the European Union would achieve a 40% reduction in nitrogen emissions, 25–40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and 23% per capita less use of cropland for food production. In addition, the dietary changes would also lower health risks. The European Union would become a net exporter of cereals, while the use of soymeal would be reduced by 75%. The nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of the food system would increase from the current 18% to between 41% and 47%, depending on choices made regarding land use. As agriculture is the major source of nitrogen pollution, this is expected to result in a significant improvement in both air and water quality in the EU. The resulting 40% reduction in the intake of saturated fat would lead to a reduction in cardiovascular mortality. These diet-led changes in food production patterns would have a large economic impact on livestock farmers and associated supply-chain actors, such as the feed industry and meat-processing sector.",0,1398888237,null,0,false,0,ch68xpt,t3_24e7am,t1_ch68xpt,t3_24e7am,null,1433593718,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

This is probably because many people are now at child bearing age (25 to 35 years old), because they were born back when demographics were still positive. 10 years from now there will be less people between 25 and 35 and more old people. As long as the total fertility rate is under 2 children per woman it's obvious the population is dropping in the long term,

I think that the a/v referendum did not help the move towards p/r. However, it is currently an interesting time in UK politics. We have had the same two political parties for 100 years without many changes. For most of the last century, almost everyone in the UK has voted for one of these parties.

true,Bezbojnicul,ROMA,Internetistan,"&gt;Mate, I live in Mureş county and not one person I know wants autonomy.

I live in Oradea, and I know both Romanians and Hungarians who favor larger autonomy of the region, as well as a lot more people who bitch about excessive centralisation and „decisions made in Bucharest”.

The word „autonomy” has a lot of negative political baggage associated with it given that it's used by ethnic Hungarian and especially Szekler political discourse. But ask Transylvanians if they „favor more decisions made in Transylvania instead of Bucharest/Southerners” and I bet a lot more would be in favor of it than if you ask if they are in favor of „autonomy”.

Also, our experiences aren't an adequate measurement of opinion, because our circle of acquaintances might not be a representative slice of the local population. So for the sake of correctness, please don't make up statistics.

I did study in Stralsund until recently.
Rent is quite high compared to the rest of M-V but not too shocking when you're from ""the west"". 

I had a bigger one room apartment (about 45 m^2 ) about 20 minutes by foot from the FH Stralsund for just below 400 Euros /month. Including water and heating.

Obviously this is quite roomy for a student. An alternative would be the Berufsförderungswerk (BFW) next to the campus.
There you can get an acceptably sized room with own shower/toilet, internet and power for i think about 300 Euros / month. Furniture is included. [german website of the BFW](http://www.bfw-stralsund.de/wohnen-und-freizeit/internat.html) 
This would be much more like a dorm. Long halls, one shared kitchen...
I dont know how to apply exactly but someone at the FH might be able to help you. Just write to them or the BFW.

As to the cost of living I'd say its about equal to the rest of Germany. Basic stuff like water, potatos, noodles and so on are about the same price. The more ""exoctic"" your taste, the more expensive it gets. (For example if you don't like/eat pork)

You replied to another comment that you like to party. I dont have the biggest of experiences regarding this topic, but there seem to be quite limited options in Stralsund. 
Of course there are a few bars but nothing too big or wild. 
Some students i knew were going via train to either Rostock or Greifswald. Both about 45min to 1hr from Stralsund central station.
 
Berlin itself would be about 3h30m via train from Stralsund, which is absolutely acceptable for a weekend trip. Hamburg is quite close as well (if i remember correctly, about 2hr).


Be warned tho. Some parts of M-V, especially on the way from Stralsund to Berlin are quite well known for having quite racist natives.

He then says how we are only represented via the commissioner through the EU.

Magut è stato trasportato subito in ospedale. ""E' uscito con le sue gambe, sta bene ed è già tornato in Kenya"", fanno sapere gli organizzatori. Biasioli, che ha ripresa la scena, afferma che il calvario dell'atleta è iniziato almeno un chilometro prima dall'arrivo: ""Era in lotta per il terzo posto e non voleva mollare - dice - Va tenuto conto anche del fatto che questi atleti guadagnano poco, e la terza piazza vuol dire comunque soldi"". Il premio in denaro per la medaglia di bronzo era 600 euro. Ma sul web non si parla di questo. I navigatori sono divisi tra chi considera Magut un 'eroe' e chi, invece, consiglia a chi si trova in simili condizioni di fermarsi in tempo. Per non rimetterci la pelle.

Subway isn't obligated to operate according to your moral sensibilities.

Yes, they very well should. 

But shit, to be real, I'm against stop &amp; search in general. But I'm also against the War in Drugs in general, so meh. 

Though let me give you an example of where I'm coming from, though it's based on America's legal system so it's different, but I think my point stands: *If I have a kilo of coke in the trunk, and I'm driving down the road, and a cop pulls me over, comes to the door, and tells me he smells weed, and because of that he's going to search my car, even though I don't have any weed nor smoked any...then they arrest me for having a brick of coke......FUCK THEM, they're in the wrong, because they searched me under false pretenses and violated my rights as a individual. And I don't give a damn about the way I dress and my Gucci Mane CD, fuck ya'll, ya'll in the wrong, freedom of expression is a valued ideal in the Western World for a god damn reason.*

And that's what I see all these search-and-frisk laws being at their very essence; a violation of your privacy as a citizen.

The vast majority of people over 65 do not use the internet everyday, if at all. while a supermajority probably exists from 11-14 of daily internet users, certainly no under fives use it daily and I suspect few 6-10 year olds are daily users.

Then of course in the adult section of the population, there are many people such as farmers, travellers, people with little education, etc. who have severely limited options or ability to use the internet daily, or at all.
