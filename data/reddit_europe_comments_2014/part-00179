&gt;My primary concerns are flying, particularly how to book such a trip when my schedule is so wide open? I don't want to be tied to a specific airport on a set date/time. Is it best to book a roundtrip flight from US to Norway over a large period, such as 45 days (friend/host can accommodate travel back to airport for return flight) then book smaller trips from Norway to elsewhere?

Yes. Within Europe look for low-cost flight. Don't overthink stuff and panic. A good place to start is by looking at low-cost airlines and what the prices are on specific dates. You know what  countries you want to see, and now you can get some specific dates.

Very useful link: http://www.whichairline.com/

Only the EZ economies aren't convergent, the tension is growing wider.

This is not over yet, not by a long shot.   

But there's certainly ways to fix it.  They have one which they're capitalising, although I'm personally not too eager to jump on board, but if that's what EZ countries who have already jumped into bed feel they need to do, so be it.

&gt;Most of the UK's trade is with the EU and the British Isles are right next to Europe.

Most of the UK's trade is outside the EU, a geographic proximity is a yesterday ball game.  We send prawn caught in the North Sea to be processed in Asia before shipping them back, for example.

The emerging markets are elsewhere.

&gt;Britain's membership of the European Union boosts its trade in goods by about 30 percent 

And you don't have to be a member to access that market, so there's certainly no reason why the 30 percent will go anywhere if the UK left.   Something that you'll later argue in your own comment when discussing Iceland; not a member but with access to the internal market.

&gt;and there is no evidence it impedes trade with countries outside the 28-nation bloc, a pro-European think tank said in a report on Monday.

Gee, they think?   

Other than the UK can't make its own free trade deals, and the EU is a customs union which typically sets tariffs around the 15 percent mark (which the UK doesn't get), and the UK is somewhat uniquely placed to capitalise.

The German ""r"" sound, I've been told (I've always been able to do both of them without practice, thanks to my mom rolling her ""r""s when I was a baby so I naturally learned how to make the sounds), can be learned by gargling water.

I am working on the EEA now for my job actually. UK should picture this. Say there is a new EU rule about the amount and type of chemicals allowed in car tires. Say that element X is outlawed, and all factories who produce with it have to ditch old tires made with it, and produce new one without it.

The 27 EU member states have agreed on this rule because none of them had sizeable factories/enterprises which produced with it, so there was no opposition. The UK was the one who produced with it. If it was inside the EU, it could have created an alliance with those who had medium and small production with that chemical, and avoided the cost of having it outlawed.

And while I don't exactly think your country's current asylum policy is sustainable, but I don't think that's a controversial position to take either. But I'm also not seeing where in the report you're getting those numbers. Maybe you're thinking of Sanandaji's papers? I'm seeing from the report:

* A conservative fiscal impact estimate of +.2% GDP for Sweden when pensions are included, +.62% when excluded.

* Over half of non-OECD immigrants to Sweden were reporting having a job prior to immigrating in 2008.

* The NEET rates are 30% for foreign-born population in Sweden.

* The risk of long-term (over one year) unemployment for foreign-born in Sweden is four percent.

* The average employment rate is about 65% for foreign-born versus ~75% for native-born in 2012.

* Foreign-born workers account for ~17% of new hires in 2012, the largest plurality of which is in services.

* Most foreign-born hires in 2008 and 2011 for Sweden were high or medium-skilled workers.

* Literature surveys point to Sweden not being the exception to broad trends- immigration results in small net fiscal impacts, while immigrants are overrepresented in social security.

* Average net direct fiscal contributions from foreign-born households is small and positive, while those from foreign households in higher, close to 5K Euro PPP. The 2008 crisis saw an added-worker effect for Sweden with net contributions *increasing* to compensate.

* Social benefits paid out are mostly at parity with those for native-born with the exception of social assistance which is a 10:1 difference.

* Net contribution for migrant households, though significantly lower than for native-born, is 896 Euro PPP per household averaged over 2007-09.

* Differences in employment levels between native and foreign-born for 2009-10 are wider than for the OECD average.

* Accounting for age/education/labor market status, the net contribution difference between natives and foreign-born is just below -4000 Euro PPP per household.

* Although immigrants on average draw less benefits than natives for OECD countries, Sweden is one of the few OECD countries where the opposite is true and pronounced for 2007-09.

* There are high ethnic penalties (inc. estimates of discriminatory effects) in unemployment rates for foreign-born peoples, highest for African men at +9%, low compared to say Turkish men in Belgium, high cf. to fmr-Yugoslavian men in Austria

* Both immigration and net migration were down in 2011 cf. to 2010, main foreign born groups being Polish (5%), Iraqi (5%), and Afghani (4%). Foreign-born constituted 63% of pop increase.

* First-instance approval rate for asylum seekers was 34% in 2011. Application rates for citizenship had an 87% success rate for 2011.

* In January 2012, the Migration Board imposed stricter requirements for workers seeking to hire non-EU workers to prevent abuse.

* The FY 2013 budget reform included provisions targeting employment, schooling and integration esp. with regards to family (as opposed to unaccompanied minor) arrivals

So conclude from that what you will. There's a lot more there. I mean it's a 400+ page document.

&gt;But I never expect much from US immigration reports as they're almost always anti-nativist and pro-immigration partisan.

Well I think you're a little confused there. For example, Borjas is one of the most famous immigration-labor economists, and he's not exactly partisan in that way. He advised the (admittedly really reaching) pro-nativist Richwine paper that Clemens mentioned. However for consensus you'll find macro professors American or otherwise to generally agree that the net gains in productivity from *skilled* immigration outweigh the costs. It's one of the classic examples of something economists agree on from a policy perspective, along with carbon taxes (revenue-neutral or otherwise), the nonsense of going back to gold standards, etc. Now the US admittedly doesn't have *that* distorted a housing market, so from a US perspective it is true that economists here are used to assuming supply will meet demand in that area.

true,[deleted],null,null,"What? No. I am not sure exactly what we are doing differently from the other similar countries, but here are three reasons it is not imaginable:

- Hernádi did his bribing aroudn 2008-2009 when the current opposition (Socialists) were in power. It is pretty much unimaginable that it happened without their knowledge and tacit approval. It's the second biggest firm in the country and partially state owned, and it was something that every nation consider _strategic_ i.e. gaining influence over the energy sector of a neighbor. It is unimaginable that he would dare to pull such a move without a promise from support above. They _must_ have had okayed it.  So it means that both Fidesz/government and Socialists/opposition has reasons to cover his ass.

- As a corollary, Hernádi is probably one of those who have good contacts (read, probably blackmail materials etc.) on _both_ sides of Hungarian politics. Otherwise one government or another would have fired him from his position of leading this company. Surviving many changes of government in one position is a sign of having contacts on both sides, right? This makes sense given that such positions are given out on a contacts / political allegiance / kickbacks basis not ability. Those guys who have contacts on both sides of course get away with everything, see Postabank / Princz Gábor. I mean who would fuck with them, given that everybody with power is allied with one side or another?

- There is no such thing as an independent media or independent opposition in Hungary. Everybody is up the ass of either the Socialists or Fidesz or other political formations. Even when not, they will be accused of being so. It is always ""you are one of us or one of them"". So what if a newspaper raises hell? They will be just seen as ""one of them attacking one of us"". Socialist fans will support it, Fidesz fans will see they are yet another Socialist tools.  People would interpret the issue based on which side they are allied with.

I don't know, maybe this is what Poland does differently, that there kind of independent newspapers or politicians or whoever who are respected by all and everybody considers them independent and honest? Are there people who are not firmly allied with one party or side or another and thus such scandals can change their allegiation?

Our situation is pretty much locked. If any party or politician is accused by any wrongdoing one side will go ""they are attacing one of us again"" and the other one ""ah, yet another example how rotten they all are on that side"", and nobody would really change allegiance based on the issue. It is like one of the locked ethnic or religious fights of the past. Not really like politics. There are two large identities, the ""we are the real Europeans, your attitudes are not Western"" of the Socialists and the ""we are the real Hungarians, you are traitors"" of the Fidesz so it is very locked now. Almost like a religious or ethnic fight.",0,1403598061,null,0,1403598978,0,ciflftp,t3_28vh3z,t1_ciflftp,t1_cif3x7u,null,1434378066,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

* Roundup can have an [adverse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate#Effects_on_fish_and_amphibians) on the environment. Compare those adverse effects to the adverse effects insecticides etc used in non GMO farming have... just saying.
* Bt Corn actually means that the farmer has to use less pesticide since it kills organism eating it and I would expect that to be better for bees etc as well since they don't eat the plant and therefore are not affected by the pesticide. Furthermore BT has been used since about [1920 and is used in organic farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_thuringiensis#Use_of_spores_and_proteins_in_pest_control) - I'd say it's reasonable to call it safe.
* Furthermore some GMO seeds are modified to be [more drought resistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_maize#Drought_resistance).
* There is more than one manufacturer of GMO seeds (eg: syngenta)


There are even more uses for GMOs than that (eg: [insulin production by genetically modified yeast and bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin#Synthesis_2))

Hello? If he's not the stereotype of the tourist wearing cargo bermuda pants with sandals, a backpack and a brand new overpriced Nikon camera then he doesn't need to look grumpy. Looking grumpy is not going to prevent acts of grumpiness from other people. 

The key is to go at the same pace as all people do. There is nothing more infuriating than a flock of tourists being slow as fuck when you're out and about. Even when I'm the tourist, I hate when people are as slow as snails. You don't have to walk at one inch per jour thinking you own the pathway to enjoy the city or whatever place you go to.

&gt;A conservative fiscal impact estimate of +.2% GDP for Sweden when pensions are included, +.62% when excluded.

Table 3.7. Specifically the column of ""Baseline per capita allocation of collectively-accrued items (excluding Defence)"" which puts it at [-0.57 of GDP.](http://www.tino.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/OECD_2013_37.png)

&gt;Over half of non-OECD immigrants to Sweden were reporting having a job prior to immigrating in 2008.

This isn't something I read up on myself in the OECD report but according to Magnus Henreksson, one of our most cited economists and a huge influence on the pro-immigration neoliberals, said [""Sverige har det största sysselsättningsgapet i OECD mellan infödda och invandrare ”vårt kanske största ekonomisk-politiska misslyckande”""](http://magasinetneo.se/artiklar/delar-av-borgerligheten-missforstar-marknadsekonomi/) or translated ""Sweden has the largest employment gap in [the] OECD [report] between natives and immigrants ”our possibly greatest economical-political failing”"". 

&gt;The NEET rates are 30% for foreign-born population in Sweden.

That's including groups like the neighbouring nordics. If you look to specific groups like the Somalis they have a near 70% unemployment (women in general never seeking work and men rarely doing so).

The time for an immigrant to enter the job market here on average is 7 years, including the returning Swedes and other nordics, and non-EU ones don't tend to be able to pay for their state costs even after 20 years in the country.

&gt;Both immigration and net migration were down in 2011 cf. to 2010

They have both gone up significantly since then, there's no point in cherrypicking years.

&gt;In January 2012, the Migration Board imposed stricter requirements for workers seeking to hire non-EU workers to prevent abuse.

That's funny since that's around the time their CEO went out and said they were interested in ""quantity, not quality."" There's also been several insane reforms like allowing illegals free schooling while preventing law enforcement from deporting them over it.

&gt;So conclude from that what you will.

I already have. We see all our leading economists say it's unsustainable, their only difference is the claim in how much it is harming us, no economists are really questioning the notion that it is at this point from what I can see. 

It's why our pro-immigration politicals refuse to discuss numbers now and go for emotional arguments.

&gt;Well I think you're a little confused there.

Not all that confused. I'm sure there are economists among you who question it but it's pretty clear that the papers that are given political and media space, particularly in globalization organizations like the Centre for Global Development, are the ones predominantly in favor of high immigration regardless of consequence.

&gt;Not sure what economists you're referring to in your country though.

To name just a few there's Henreksson, Sanandaiji, Assar Lindbeck, Jan Ekberg and Jan Tullberg who have all either commented on the failing immigration policies huge costs or outright done their own analyses all of which puts it at a higher real cost than the OECD one does. Ekberg for example puts it at around [2x-3x the OECD reports -0.57](http://eso.expertgrupp.se/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2009_3-fr%C3%A5n-webb.pdf) and Tullberg puts it at a whopping [7% of GDP.](http://www.lasningen.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lasningen-Tullberg.pdf)",0,1403598698,null,0,1403599118,0,cifljtr,t3_28v1os,t1_cifljtr,t1_cifl8fe,null,1434378115,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Jeez, well obviously the Euro is not the cause for all deflation in the world.  I wouldn't have thought that needed saying.   

But being in control of your own interest rate means that you can do something specific and fashioned to your needs when it is needed.  The problem the EU has is that it has divergent economies in different places of different cycles.

&gt;Not true.

Yes true.  That statistic does not take into account the Rotterdam-Antwerp Effect, which means that if anything from outside the EU comes to the UK but stopping at an EU port first, or vice versa, it is classed as EU origin trade even though that's not where the trade originates.  

A conservative estimate usually puts non-EU:EU trade at around 60:40, although some speculate it closer to 70:30.   

Your figure doesn't take into effect the Rotterdam-Antwerp Effect because no figure does as it's not recorded, but it exists.  Shipping from the orient regularly use hubs in the Med, and East coast shipping regularly ferries freight to and from Rotterdam-Antwerp where it goes out across the world.   Same applies for road, rail and air freight.

&gt;No it is not. Proximity will always matter.

It's almost as if we're not communicating from different sides of the world instantaneously.  

Of course it will matter in some ever decreasing regard, but technology, services, digital communication, cheap transport, modern logisitics,..., it's a side note issue.  80% of UK business is domestic - that's how proximity is relevant.  It's a relative non-issue to trade.  I want to ship something to Sydney, or from Thailand?  It might as well be Milan or Marseilles.  It's just codes on a screen.  

It's a global economy now, and we don't need custom union protectionism.  It's really last century.

&gt;Iceland has no power over EU policy. The UK does.

LoL, not according to the Poles we don't (or out fantastic 0% record at the Council).  This influence is becoming less and less relevant.  That's not to say that the UK is good and the rEU is bad, or vice versa.  It's just to say that we're not representative or indicative of each other in general.  It's not to say we can't be friends and trade with each other either.  We can.

 Interestingly enough much of the EU regulation comes from international bodies, and the arguments the Norwegians tend to use who as a people/rule generally seem quite happy to remain outside the EU, is that they find they have influence at an earlier stage.  I'd far rather the UK be negotiating for itself with global partners at the WTO than a less representative EU delegation.

&gt;I don't see why the UK needs any more ""sovereignty"" than France or Germany.

I don't see why you put sovereignty in quotation marks, but you've got it the wrong way around.  France and Germany pushing for Federalism have decided they need less sovereignty than the UK.

- Language is a problem. Differences from one state to another are okay in the US because, if you think the grass is greener, you can move to another state very easily. In Europe, doing so is very difficult because chances are that state speaks a different language. And without this true freedom of movement, other economic liberalism becomes somewhat questionable.
- People are still racist / nationalist. Bigotry is still rife across Europe. And the UK is not well liked. There is fear of punishment for being British.

Rassismus heißt für mich immer, dass man andere Menschen versucht einer ""Rasse"" hinzuzuorden und sie in dieser Form beleidigen zu versucht, vergeallmeinert und gleichzeitig seine eigene ""Rasse"" als höherwertig ansieht.

Ist es Rassistisch, weil man annimmt, dass alle Afrikaner eine schwarze Hautfarbe haben?

For a country like Germany it's not about the physical security of the gold, it's that the purpose of having gold reserves is that in the event of a currency crisis you can sell the gold for foreign currency. That's why the German gold that's currently stored in Paris is being moved back to Frankfurt, it doesn't make any sense to store it in France since France uses the same currency now. But the gold stored by the Fed and the Bank of England can still be used for its original purpose.

For this reason it's also not strictly necessary for the gold to actually exist, as long as the Fed sends the appropriate amount of dollars when Germany asks it to sell some of the gold.

 Es beruht sich auf sogenannte Minstrel Shows aus den USA. In den   Shows malten sich Weiße das Blackface auf, und tuen so als ob sie schwarz wären. Was sehr rassisstich war, den die Darstellung war immer sehr dumm, sehr gemein, und hyper sexualisiert.

Das ist der direkteste Grund. 

&gt; Ist es Rassistisch, weil man annimmt, dass alle Afrikaner eine schwarze Hautfarbe haben? 

Überhaubt nicht.

Aber Blackface ging (und geht) sehr oft mit einer dummen, aggresiven, und/oder hyper sexualisierten Darstellung Hand in Hand.

Ein nicht US Beispiel wäre in den Niederlanden, wo der St. Niklaus eine Horde dumme, kindliche Helfer hat, die Blackface und eine krause Perücke tragen. (Die die sagen das Zwarte Piet nicht ein Schwarzer sein soll ignorieren die Geschichte des Zwarten Piet und die Geschichte der Niederlanden, einer der größten (wenn nicht der Größte) Sklavenhändler und Halter seiner Zeit.)

Unbewusste Ausgrenzung oder Stigmatisierung muss auch ein Thema sein, meiner Meinung nach. 

Und warum nicht einfach ein traditionelles Gewandt anziehen wenn man sich als Afrikaner verkleiden will? Es gibt viel mehr was sie ausmacht als ihre Hautfarbe.

true,SimonGray,DENK,Nørrebro,"Countries don't devaluate currencies anymore, that's a fairly pre-1970s idea of macroeconomics. These days, currencies are mostly independent and the price of a currency is at the market equilibrium. Countries usually have an independent central bank in charge of making small stabilising adjustments, usually through market actions (buying and selling national bonds), but they don't devaluate anything. Currencies naturally appreciate and depreciate.

If Greece had its own currency again, it would _not_ be worth as much as Germany's currency, it would be worth much less because the Greek economy and state of finances is pretty bad. The market has already realised this, but the Greek currency is still as expensive as ever (since they use the Euro). This throws Greece out of an economic equilibrium so that many people (those _without_ large investments and savings) cannot even get a job while those with lots of capital and savings are not hit as hard because their investments are valued in the Euro.

Furthermore, since their savings denominated in Euro have not lost any value relative to other EU countries, there is no added incentive to invest in the Greek economy as opposed to the rest of Europe. Actually, there is a disincentive as the economy is in the shitter.

In the ideal case with Greece having its own currency, the Greek economy would suffer more across the board and bounce back more quickly, as the now depreciated Greek currency would direct investment inward (a cheap currency makes outward investment much more expensive).

- Two chambers, one for the whole european construct, one for the regions. The votes in the latter being represented in a similar way to the EP (or the EP will become this second chamber). No commission or bullshit like this - government is accountable to first chamber which is directly elected in whole Europe while the regions vote every x years in their own elections. 

- In germany, one could just drop the national level completely and let the *Länder* be the regions and I'm sure something like this is also possible for other nations.

- Europe already has a constitutional court, a flag and an anthem. So nothing to do here. Regions would have to use or invent their own flags though.

- Capital city is a hard one but I would just stick to Brussels or Strasbourg out of practical reasons (Strasbourg is also a pretty cool symbol coming from hereditary enmity between France and Germany and now hereditary friendship that started the whole EU thing).

But in a United States of Europe, the UK would be ruled from afar and from overseas. Nobody in the UK would be able to just pop in a car and drive over to join in a protest.

I'm sorry. This makes absolutely no sense. How big is the channel? Can't you just use a car ferry to get over or put your car on the train that goes through the tunnel? The people from top gear managed to cross it in an [amphibious car that they made themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTVPPTV-bQM), for fuck's sake.  



Out of all the European capitals, London is one of the absolutely closest to Brussels. Amsterdam, Luxembourg City and Paris are the only ones that are closer... out of in total 28 capital cities. 

The distance between London and Belfast is also larger than the distance between London and Brussels. And you have to cross an equally tiny body of water to get there. 

&gt;Language is a problem. Differences from one state to another are okay in the US because, if you think the grass is greener, you can move to another state very easily. In Europe, doing so is very difficult because chances are that state speaks a different language. And without this true freedom of movement, other economic liberalism becomes somewhat questionable.

I agree that language is a big problem, but it has not really impeded freedom of movement. There are a huge number of people from poor EU countries coming to richer ones. 

&gt;People are still nationalist.

This I completely agree with. And I think it's the reason why we will never, ever see a European federation. The countries and their cultures and histories and languages are too different for it to ever work. 

&gt; And the UK is not well liked. There is fear of punishment for being British.

Bullshit. [The UK is one of the most well-liked countries in Europe.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22624104) Only Germany is more well-liked.

* Do a guided tour around the Cathedral (in august there should be Concerts on the Organ too)  
* Visit a concert at the Philharmonie if you have a knack for classic music (they have free concerts on thursday around noon)  
* The opera house is currently rebuild, so the opera ensemble is doing performances at a couple of other interesting venues (no idea if they play in August however)  

Standard Touristy stuff:  
* Shopping     
* Climb on the Cathedral spire (509 steps, no escalator)  
* standard Braushaustour (Breweries)  
* Take a tour with the funicular over the rhine  
* Take a boat trip   
* Get drunk in the Altstadt area  
* Visit Schloss Augustusburg (couple of minutes by train outside the city)  

Non-standard stuff:  
* Historical Brauhaustour  
* 12 Basilicas tour (thats non-guided, will take you all over the city centre and is well combinable with a couple of pubs. pack shoes you can well walk in)  
* flea markets all around town  
* shopping outside city center (belgian quarter and Ehrefeld. takes some will to walk around and discover things)  
* visit the galleries (where art gets sold, they like visitors coming to watch too)  
* if the weather is good, hit one of the parks or just chill at the rhine promenade  
* visit Melaten Cemetery, smaller than famous pere lachaise at paris, but older and in the same architectural   league  
* check out the nightlife outside the touristy paths.

D'un point de vue général, Dauphine a une excellente réputation en France. Son niveau pour les recruteurs est comparable à Sciences Po (Paris) et certaines excellentes Grandes Écoles. Si tu veux comparer aux Écoles américaines, la réputation de Dauphine en France serait comparable à celle de UC Berkeley aux États-Unis : très bonne école avec une forte réputation, mais il lui manque ce petit quelque chose qui en ferait une Ivy League. 


Sorbonne et Assas sont de très bonne universités, qui auraient la même réputation en France que la réputation de UC San Diego et UC Los Angeles ont aux États-Unis.

Personally, I don't want the EU to make this transformation per se. I do want things like a common foreign policy and a common military though, and if we get that in addition to what the EU currently is, then I think at some point we might just as well start calling it a federation.

- Masculine collectivism: ""we are tough, we kick ass"": European conservatism, right-wing, nationalism. From Bismarck to Salazaar or even Mussolini. Not necessarily fascist though.

- Feminine individualism: ""leave others in peace, be tolerant"" -  pacifist, anti-nationalist liberalism. Most liberals historically, those who opposed WWI, Stefan Zweig, Thomas Mann etc. most European intellectuals. Anti-nationalist, anti-militarist, wishing for unified Europe etc. never a war anymore etc.

- Masculine individualism: ""I am tough, I survive everything"" - American rugged individualism, libertarianism with a gun and a survivor mentality. Self made man. This is not typical in Europe. It is alien.

It's in Europe, America, Canada and pretty much every 1st world country's interest to help shitty places like Africa get better cos it will benefit us all.

It's not like we started out with ""not our continent, not our problem"". We started out with ""lets give them money and offer them education"" Africa took the money, refused the education and they did that over and over and over and over and just like at some point you stop giving your crack-addicted brother money because you know he will just spend it on crack again Europe needs to stop giving money to Africa because there is no fucking point in trying to help Africa until Africa wants to accept our help. And our help is not just money, not just education, our help is also a culture. A culture where people have rights, where kids go to school, not work, where you don't take community property (generators, solar cells, water pumps and filters) and sell it off for scraps just so you are a little more well off for a few weeks.

Once Africa, or a majority of Africans change their minds and embrace human rights, democracy, education, a legal system and so on Europe should go back to helping them. Europe should educate doctors, engineers, teachers, construction workers and all that to help Africa. But Europe can't succeed in helping Africa unless Africa sincerely wants our help and Africans are willing to stand up and fight for democracy. See all those guys on the boat? I'm sure if they wanted a better life for everyone, they could unite, they could build a community, they could work together to make their country better.

true,canteloupy,ZBSuisse,Suisse,"Ce qui est utilisé en génétique des populations dont j'ai parlé plus haut ce sont les haplogroupes.

http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroupe

On peut faire des groupes d'allèles spécifiques à des populations ancestrales et regarder chez qui ils sont présents. Sur le chromosome Y tu peux suivre la ligne paternelle. En plus il n'y a pas de recombinaisons parce qu'il n'y a qu'un seul chromosome Y donc le groupe est assez stable sur la durée. C'est plus dur avec d'autres chromosomes.

Pour la ligne maternelle il y a l'ADN mitochondrial, parce que les spermatozoïdes ont très peu d'ADN mitochondrial, donc le tien viendra de ta mère. Donc on peut aussi regarder les variations de cet ADN et comparer les populations, pour établir des lignées.

Pour identifier une personne, c'est compliqué parce que chaque personne a de nombreux chromosomes et en deux copies, donc pour chaque gène à part ceux là deux allèles (version du gène) de ses deux parents, mais pas forcément un chromosome maternel et un chromosome paternel, parce qu'ils peuvent se mélanger par la recombinaison justement. Donc il y a des puces qui contiennent un ensemble de marqueur et si t'en prends suffisamment t'auras presque jamais deux personnes qui auront les même marqueurs sans être identiques génétiquement.

Pour les populations c'est différent. Tu peux prendre un sous ensemble de ces marqueurs et ils seront beaucoup plus souvent présents dans une population que dans une autre. Mais l'affiliation à un groupe ethnique est de plus en plus culturelle et de moins en moins biologique, de nos jours. Il n'y a qu'à voir aux USA il y a beaucoup de gens qui se déclarent ""noirs"" sans avoir la peau foncée, et les hispaniques se déclarent de plus en plus ""blancs"". Ca change aussi avec le métissage, et là l'ethnie devient de moins en moins une variable intéressante biologiquement. C'est surtout intéressant pour retracer l'évolution humaine, par exemple dans quelle mesure un allèle permettant la digestion du lactose, ou la synthèse de vitamine D, a été sélectionné rapidement dans une sous population, ou combien de migrations successives ont peuplé un territoire. Si tu trouves plusieurs haplogroupes dans une population c'est qu'elle résulte de mélanges. Si tu trouves un haplogroupe mitochondrial de type amérindien et un haplogroupe du chromosome Y de type européen, c'est probablement un pays colonisé par les européens, etc.

Je ne suis pas sûre de comprendre ce que tu veux dire par ""biaisé"". Mais ces marqueurs sont en général utilisés à l'échelle d'une population, donc on aura les mitochondries et le chromosome Y. Pour un individu, c'est à dire si tu envoies ton échantillon à un projet de cartographie ou à 23&amp;me, s'il y avait très peu d'individus avec les même groupes que toi dans leur base de données, ils ne vont juste pas pouvoir te dire grand chose.

Il y a certains marqueurs qu'on sait présents parmi des populations moins ancestrales, surtout lorsqu'il s'agit de populations qui pratiquement peu les inter-mariages avec d'autres, et donc ne se mélangent pas beaucoup. C'est le cas de peuples qui ont eu un bottleneck récent (une isolation territoriale subite par exemple) comme au Québec, ou simplement social, comme les Amish ou les Ashkenazes.

&gt;Oh god, that project sounds horrible. That's probably a good argument against nuclear: private companies can't be trusted to build them and government can't build them at all.

People won't pay more and we need to shut down those coal power plants.

They're not yet enjoying the full potential benefits of mass production, so there's hope. In addition they can be deployed by private persons and small companies, which nuclear can't.

As I said before their economic problems were not caused by the Euro. However by not having control of monetary policy they have lose control of one of the most effective means to spur economic growth.

There are of course other policies that can be pursued to boost growth, these mostly come under Fiscal (infrastructure spending/tax cuts for example) or supply side (de-regulation, making it easier to set up businesses). However a deeply indebted government cannot purse expansionary fiscal policy without running into a debt crisis, nor can an unpopular government pursue supply side as they will be voted out by the interest groups they disadvantage.

Government's like Austria had the freedom to pursue moderate Fiscal policies and were able to continue their admirable investment in education. Countries with strong governments like Poland were able to pass moderate economic supply side reforms. Government's outside the EU, like the UK, were able to use monetary policy.

But there will always be people who are lax with security. That's the real problem. Technically it's possible or at least debatable, but we'll always have to make sure it's foolproof and failproof.

&gt;Nukes in general have the best capacity foctors.

Well, duh. Because they're designed to provide baseload, and the rest of the grid is designed around them.

&gt;That is a collosal difference when compared with renewables ~30%. In short time periods renewables fluctuate wildly between 0% and 100%. It's theirs intrinsic property.

There are various ways to address that, like averaging them out over space by means of the grid, or over time by means of storage. And then there's demand management.

&gt;Is that because nuclear power plants are unreliable in general or is that because Germany is abadoming nuclear power and is for this reason left with older less reliable power plants?

They expected to let them live out until they reached their designed age of obsolescence. It was a political decision to stop that quickly. But right now here in Belgium a few reactors are down for unexpected maintenance too, so it's not like it can't happen.",0,1403605971,null,0,false,0,cifms5b,t3_28cqmh,t1_cifms5b,t1_cibmko3,null,1434378694,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Because driving from London to Brussels is that much difficult than from Lissabon, Warszawa or Zagreb? Yes, you are on an island. But nowadays, DIRECT proximity isn't that important.

There aren't going to mature unless people WANT to shape them. This form of argumentation is a vicious circle and a self-fulfilling prophecy. Saying ""The EU has a democratic deficit!

Nobody is holding anybody back.  That's just a simplistic nonsense that rabid Europhile types peddle to explain why their promised land of a European superstate has not come about, an excuse they can use to conveniently ignore that most of the Continent holds suspicions or downright hostility to the idea of a European superstate, or increased integration along various axes that differ from country to country, not just the British.  Further, I'd like to point out that it was the Netherlands---your own country---that rejected the Constitution for Europe in 2005, a vote the UK and the rest of the Continent never held as a result.  Who really is holding everybody back?

If the rest of Europe really wants to integrate further, and the UK actually is preventing them from doing so, why have we not seen increased use of measures like Enhanced Co-operation to circumvent the UK?  In actual fact, where Enhanced Co-operation has been used, the UK is a signatory to 50% of the measures being pushed through, and in the case of Applicable Divorce Law, where the UK is not a signatory, the Netherlands is also not a signatory, neither!  Further, the likes of Poland and Croatia are signatories to neither bout of Enhanced Co-operation---neither the unified divorce law, nor the unified European patent.  Again, if you're searching for countries holding back further integration, perhaps you are better served looking at the likes of Poland, before accusing the British of being obstinate opponents, no?",1,1403606680,null,0,1403607119,0,cifmwnj,t3_28xkwz,t1_cifmwnj,t1_cifmt5t,null,1434378755,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

In the video package in that link, the ""violence"" and ""police intervention"" portion occupies the last 5 seconds. 

Honestly, here's better coverage of Lille &amp; Roubaix (up to 25 cars reported burnt in Roubaix, for example): 

http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/region/victoire-de-l-algerie-scenes-de-liesse-a-lille-ia19b0n2227461

The thing is, this is a rather intense and complex issue. Boiling it down to ""Get ready for cars to be burnt out"" is rather bullshit, and simultaneously neglects both the traditions of football thuggery in Europe *and* the tragic and violent problems of postcolonial France. So, yeah, I don't buy this as meaningful. 

That's not to say that, say, after an Algerian *win* of the World Cup, things wouldn't escalate dramatically. But I couldn't say that any of the disadvantaged teams wouldn't have their celebrations turn darker with a big win. The US is known for horrific celebrations of meaningless games.

I also find it interesting what media is covering this in what way. Le Monde, for example, doesn't believe the ""riots"" merit coverage, and only presents celebration:

http://www.lemonde.fr/coupe-du-monde/article/2014/06/23/mondial-2014-une-presse-algerienne-aux-anges_4443277_1616627.html?xtmc=algerie&amp;xtcr=8

Likewise with France 24, as far as I have found:

http://www.france24.com/fr/20142306-mondial-coupe-algerie-coree-victoire-joie-alger-paris-porto-alegre-reactions-football/

http://www.france24.com/fr/20140622-direct-algerie-coree-du-sud-live-foot-mondial-2014-coupe-du-monde-porto-alegre-slimani-feghouli/

Here's a decent interview on *why* there is such a predominance of Algerian pride in their football team:

http://www.lefigaro.fr/vox/societe/2014/06/23/31003-20140623ARTFIG00170-pourquoi-de-jeunes-francais-s-identifient-a-l-equipe-d-algerie.php

Now, I'm not whitewashing this situation. I know the history of Algerian football violence a bit (Algeria v Egypt rivalry is among the most horrific and violent; they are known to have a relatively ""violent"" stadium culture in Algeria itself, and are prone to having street ""riots"" after wins of local teams, some of which have been mistaken as political rallies).

&gt;The __Stop-Question-and-Frisk program__ in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City) is a practice of the [New York City Police Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department) by which police officers stop and question hundreds of thousands of pedestrians annually, and frisk them for weapons and other contraband. The rules for stop, question and frisk are found in New York State Criminal Procedure Law section 140.50, and are based on the decision of the [United States Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court) in the case of *[Terry v. Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_v._Ohio)*.   About 684,000 people were stopped in 2011.    The vast majority of these people were [African-American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American) or [Latino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latino).    Some judges have found that these stops are not based on [reasonable suspicion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_suspicion) of criminal activity.

I would like to see our prime ministers accorded the respect that Merkel seems to be, and in fact there have been a few reports that Britain may have a larger economy than Germany in 10 or 20 years - if that is the case then I would expect a much stronger role for the UK in Europe. And with a more important role in Europe I would expect that we would be better able to mould Europe to the UK's interests.

And an economic argument for the EU is that the EU has greater GDP than the US and the EU is still growing (although it has less GDP per head). So the EU has a lot of potential influence on the world.

But, if we rule out closer integration with the EU what other options would you propose? A satellite state of the US doesn't appeal to me - I feel like the EU has world-leading consumer protection which we would lose if we went closer to the US. 

I don't fancy going it alone either because of the demographic reasons I outlined earlier. The idea of resurrecting the commonwealth that was banded about a while ago seems a bit like wishful thinking - although there probably is more that could be done there.

true,IrishPidge,IREL,Ireland,"I understand that view, but that can be difficult in practice, as certain areas tend to spillover from another.

Let's imagine we're in a bare bones trading alliance. France decides that it wants to increase environmental standards on their factories, as their rivers are becoming filthy. Since there are no trading barriers, Poland decides to lower their standards in order to attract French industry. Normally, France could put in place corrective tariffs to deal with this, but they can't under the trade deal. Not wanting an environmental race to the bottom, countries in this trading pact come together and agree some common environmental standards. Now, out of a trading pact, this new alliance has itself an environmental policy.

But coming up with agreement on these trade policies is tough, so a small secretariat is set up to suggest environmental laws which the member states can then agree on. Sweden is also concerned that the Italians are fudging their environmental statistics, and so feel cheated. They then task the secretariat with monitoring member state's compliance with the common rules on trade and the environment. So now the alliance has a Commission.

Latvia decides that it wants to stop importing fruit from a nasty dictatorship on the grounds of principle. Since there's a trading alliance, that would require preventing imports from other countries or some form of collective agreement among the trading partners. So a fully-integrated market requires some degree of commonality. The bare bones trading pact suddenly has to decide on international matters of trade, which means they have to take into account things like geopolitics, foreign affairs, human rights, labour conditions and so on. Before you know it, the trading alliance has itself some elements of a common foreign affairs policy.

This applies to a variety of other policy areas, most of which are the ones where the EU has competence or control over.

But hang on, this alliance is suddenly getting to control quite a bit of policy, and people feel like they've no say in it. Why not remedy that with a pan-trade alliance parliament, directly elected by the people. And this goes on and on.

You can't have a strong stable currency *and* a currency that you adapt to the whims of economic cycles at the same time.

&gt;Oh, not to mention they have sovereign control of their currency/monetary policy through the Bank of England instead of needing to rely on the ECB.

""Sovereign"" is a buzzword that doesn't really add to the sentence. Obviously it's a tradeoff, less regional diversification of interest rates vs. bigger clout of the ECB. But the thing is, the ECB *has tried* to relax the interest rate to grease the economic wheels. It didn't work. Not for lack of willingness to adapt the interest rate, but because the banking system no longer lets credit trickle down. And that's not the fault of the euro, it was a preexisting condition and a result of excessive financialization. We will have to deal with that, but the UK will too.

Well. Like... 70% had the same mother tongue. And that's more than in a lot of European countries today. 


&gt;There were plenty of reasons why it wouldn't work and it wasn't necessarily ethnic tensions that led to its violent break-up.

Well. I think most of the reasons are reproducible in a hypothetical European federation. Maybe not the fall of communism, but nationalism can rise fairly quickly. It has happened many times before, too. Yugoslavia was just the most recent example that I could come up with. Austria-Hungary, the Kalmar Union, the UK, etc. etc. 


&gt;What's more, just because there are two different ethnic groups living in the same region does not automatically mean that war is inevitable; I've yet to see the Flems and the Wallonians have a massive, violent breakdown.

The people in Belgium form different communities, rather than ethnic groups. They all still identify as Belgian. The same is true for the Swiss. They are all ""Eidgenossen"". Despite most of them being ""German"", ""French"" or ""Italian"", they feel like they have a lot more in common with each other than the proper French, Germans and Italians. 

This is not the case in Europe at all. There are different ethnic groups and nationalities that have developed separately from one another for millennia. Most of the people in the UK feel that they share a stronger bond with the rest of the Anglosphere than with any country in Europe.

true,elphieLil84,EURO,European Union,"&gt; One of our closest EU allies, Poland basically hates us.

Oh c'mon, Sikorski is a well known hawk: what he thinks about Cameron is not what he thinks of the UK as an ally. He was mostly speaking about Cameron and his way to handle the EU issue, which in fairness to many seems just a way to bow to populism vs having the best interest of country at heart. Populism here is in the sense of ""give the people what they want"". This does not necessarily means to make the best rational choice. UK people would feel what they feel even if they were told that they would lose millions of jobs and would not count shit anymore for the US,as they won't be the US anchor in the EU anymore, relegating them to very little importance on the international stage. Still, people don't care. If Cameron is convinced that this is not the most rational choice, and he still gives in to ""the will of the people"", in Sikorski's view he's an idiot. Sikorski's position on what should a leader do is shared by many in this world, and we could debate for years on it. However, it does not define what the UK is for Poland.

On the other hand, surely Poland has been tremendously disappointed by UK's behavior during the Ukrainian crisis. They thought that the UK understood the Russian threat, and that they would be stern in their rebuff of Putin's expansionism. They thought that the UK, like the US, was a strong protector of the States in the East against the Russian menace, which they feel so strongly. After all, it was also the UK who badly wanted them in the EU, to strike a point at the end of the Cold War about who won it.

However, they were met with coldness, at best. Many in the UK (and in many other countries) actually were busier trying to spot nazis among the protesters than actually understanding the strategic and long term results of Russian moves for Eastern countries. Poles were disappointed, and won't forget. They were used to see the UK at the front of external relations initiatives of the EU, and now they have been faced with what amounts to isolationism in international relations. Basically a ""we generally stand on your ideological ground, but we don't care enough to engage"". 

&gt; The more that the rest of the EU financially integrates, the more urgent the UK question becomes.

Because North-Western parts of Europe were more developed than South-Eastern parts.

They started the industrial revolution and have grown very much - then South-East never cached up until precisely the Socialists governments - in the 70's the level of life was comparable in Western and Eastern Europe. 

Then the crisis of the 80's came, but the difference wasn't too strong until the late 80's when the communist regimes started to fall and the integration of the economies was broken.

And the integration of economies is no joke, why do you think European Union exists? Imagine it dissolving right tomorrow with no preparation. Will it affect economies of ex-members or what?

The following reforms were very important. Some countries played it smart like Czech Republic (peaceful dissolution with Slovakia, concentration of efforts on growth and **conservation** of existing industry and economic potential), other did it bad like Poland, Russia, Baltic States (given up too much industries, made the change too fast ruining old companies by allowing cheap imports...) but thanks to other aspects managed to keep afloat and later started recovering and growing again. Others went full retard in their intent to be the fastest ""best"" reformer: sell all good companies dirt cheap to foreign ""investors"", keep the ruined ones, sever all ties to other Eastern bloc economies... I'm not going to number them, everyone know which countries are those.

So from 70's comparable (but not equal) level - at least 2 decades were lost. Right now almost 3 decades past since Perestroika - countries have restored from a War in less time.

&gt; JMLP est une pupille de la nation. Il a été marin-pêcheur, mineur de fond, métreur d'appartements, ambulant des PTT, plus jeune député de France, engagé volontaire. Marine est une bourgeoise.
 
 Ah quel Grand Homme alors ton Jean-Marie, alors que la marine elle c'est une bourgeoise.. Le culte de la personnalité au FN a encore de beaux jours visiblement. 

&gt; En quoi JMLP ferait-il parti de l'élite ?

On devrait bien trouver une interview ou il cite le mot ""élite"" non? C'est le critère pertinent visiblement: parles-en au local du FN et tiens moi au courant d'accord?  

&gt; Étude démontée ici et là.

Ah oui, on a pu trouver deux ou trois blogueurs un peu vexés. Eh bien ils n'ont qu'à soumettre une réponse au journal en question, et la publier. 

&gt; OK joli biais de sélection. Les populations étudiées ne constituent pas un groupe représentatif des populations censées être étudiées et ne permettent donc pas de répondre aux questions posées...

 Eh bien, je vois que les éditeurs du journal auraient du te contacter (au local du FN) pour reviewer l'article... je n'arrive pas à comprendre pourquoi ils n'y ont pas pensé ... 

&gt; Avec la même méthode, je te montre qu'il y a une corrélation entre race et capacités cognitives...

 Ah tu vas pouvoir en parler à ton local du FN.. sans doute de quoi contenter l'archi majorité de tes potes ... de franches rigolades en perspective au local. 

&gt; Comment interpréter le vote musulman alors ?

--&gt; Les musulmans ne sont pas masochistes. 

&gt; Que veut dire ""brillant"" ?

 Regarde autour de toi, au local du FN, et dis-toi que c'est l'inverse. 

&gt; D'un point de vue empirique il est évident que tu n'as jamais mis les pieds dans un local du FN. 

 Oulà jamais de la vie! Ce qu'il s'y passe est assez bien décrit [ici](http://www.arretsurimages.net/breves/2014-01-22/Racisme-un-directeur-de-campagne-FN-demissionne-Libe-id16757), et franchement ça donne pas envie.  
Oh mais j'oubliais.. ça vient d'un média aux ordres des pseudo-zélites: i.e. aucune valeur. 

&gt; Et d'ailleurs que tu n'as strictement aucune idée du fonctionnement de la vie politique en France.

 Eh bien, si tu le dis :) 

&gt; Pression médiatique et sociale. Être candidat FN a des conséquences sur ta vie sociale, ta vie va être scrutée par les médias, tes collègues vont mal te regarder, quand il n'y a pas d'autres pressions.
 
 Et voilà le couplet ""victimisation"" qui manquait. Ça devait arriver. Pourtant dans vos têtes vous êtes majoritaires .. les mésaventures dont tu parles devraient s'avérer rares... D'ailleurs la ""pression sociale"" n'incite pas certains colistiers à rendre privées leurs pages FB ou ils étalent leurs photos de croix gammées ou de crampes au bras. Mais bon, c'est vrai que c'est encore la faute à ces vilains médias qui scrutent et qui cherchent la petite bête. Ils exagèrent vraiment.. pas moyen d'être un nazi en paix dans ce pays de pseudo-vraies-élites hein? 

&gt; Quelle est ta définition de populiste ?

 La même que la tienne.. arrête ton sketche, ou alors ouvre un dictionnaire.

Not exactly. There was an active effort to try to bring Croatian, Bosnian and Serbian (which are very similar, I grant you) closer to a Serbo-Croatian language that all three sub-states could speak. Slovenian, Macedonian and Albanian were completely independent of this development.

&gt;most of the reasons are reproducible in a hypothetical European federation

I'm not sure where you get the impression that in a hypothetical European federation there need necessarily be oppression. If anything, it would likely be German economic dominance that would incite hatred in countries that might think themselves to be the victims of German neo-imperialism. There is a giant difference between Austria-Hungary (which was, as a minor point, dismantled by the victors in WW1) or others examples you listed, because a hypothetical European Union would not enforce a de jure lingua franca, most likely it would likely evolve naturally. Likewise, I doubt very highly that Europea would establish a culture that would be deemed more correct or dominant over all others. A better comparison for a federal Europe would probably be India, given that it would mean different cultures uniting under a single banner for reasons other than nationalist fervour. 

&gt;The people in Belgium form different communities, rather than ethnic groups. They all still identify as Belgian.

Ask the Flemish behind the secession movement how 'Belgian' they feel today. And I wager it's perfectly possible that with time, we'll feel isolated enough as people living on this continent that we might identify enough with each other that we will likewise form a common European identity. We have an Eastern neighbour that seems hellbent on wrecking the good relations we in Europe have with each other and with the USA. And likewise, we have the USA which for better or for worse is seen merely as the better of the two evils, but whose influence is seen as being more and more corrosive. 

Furthermore, the relationship of the English and the extra-continental Anglosphere (which I find you're exaggerating) is not only irrelevant, as a federal Europe can exist without the UK, but also demonstrates that language and social institutions influence one's feelings of belonging to a certain cultural sphere far more than ethnic background. For all the talk of how European nations are culturally unique, we do share a lot of the same social norms and institutions: civil law, primarily constitutional democracies, a more socially permissive outlook (how this will clash with the new Eastern members will be interesting to see), a markedly more leftist approach to the economy and so on.",0,1403611329,null,0,false,0,cifnvnt,t3_28y8or,t1_cifnvnt,t1_cifnhlm,null,1434379277,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

&gt; Well, duh. Because they're designed to provide baseload, and the rest of the grid is designed around them.

They are not designed to be a baseload source they are a baseload source. It's their properies which makes them be most efficient when used this way not design. That was my point. You can use any baseload power source to provide all your power without any problems. Unfortunately renewables are not baseload sources. Trying to use them as such is at very least great engeneering challenge. Present day grids are just not nearly good enough to provide capacity and minimalize thermal losses to smooth out say wind power fluctuations if you would want to generate say on average 50% from wind. Weather parerns on average change with hundreds of kilometers which is about the same distance over which present day power grids can conduct eletricity. No matter how you space you windfarms wind would be most likely blowing with the same strenght at all places within the reach of your power grid.

&gt; They expected to let them live out until they reached their designed age of obsolescence.

&gt;Germany was to limit its combined armed forces to no more than 370,000 personnel, no more than 345,000 of whom were to be in the Army and the Air Force. Germany also reaffirmed its renunciation of the manufacture, possession of, and control over nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, and in particular, that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty would continue to apply in full to the unified Germany (the Federal Republic of Germany). No foreign armed forces, nuclear weapons, or the carriers for nuclear weapons would be stationed or deployed in six states (the area of Berlin and the former East Germany), making them a permanent Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. The German Army could deploy conventional weapons systems with nonconventional capabilities, provided that they were equipped and designed for a purely conventional role. Germany also agreed to use military force only in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

Article 11 of the Constitution of Italy reads:

&gt;Italy repudiates war as an instrument of aggression against the freedom of other peoples and as a means for the settlement of international disputes. Italy agrees, on conditions of equality with other States, to the limitations of sovereignty that may be necessary to a world order ensuring peace and justice among the Nations. Italy promotes and encourages international organisations furthering such ends.

This hasn't been changed since 1948, but it didn't prevent Italy from bombing Serbia and sending troops to Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan on ""peace"" missions, while, especially in Afghanistan, troops were involved in actual combat duties.
For the limitations imposed to Italy by the 1947 peace treaty, see articles 55 and following of the treaty (http://www.diecifebbraio.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Treaty-of-Peace-with-Italy.pdf). In short, no nuclear weapons, max. 250,000 soldiers, 200 tanks, no aircraft carriers, no bomber planes, max. 200 fighter planes.

We need *more* CAP. It's, to a large degree, used to let fields fall fallow. The general idea is to give farmers free money to produce less, so that we can keep the capacity to feed ourselves if shit hits the fan, but at the same time not crash the world markets with much too productive agriculture and make people dependent on our exports.

Agriculture in the EU is pure madness: It's one of the most fertile regions of the world, and at the same time the one with the I think second-largest degree of industrialisation, after the US.

Another, very good solution is to push organic even more. (Not even that much) lower yields, yes, but yields are already, taking the big picture into account, too high.

The ones with money (banks and some companies) don't want to take the first step and invest, and neoliberal austerity policy solves problems by squeezing the less wealthy 90% of society so it's not going to come from them either. So either the moneyholders will have to be forced to use it or lose it, or the money will have to be created directly in the hands of the 90%. For the first having clout is necessary (being the largest economic bloc on the planet, for example), for the second it's advisable, because that would be highly unorthodox, and the markets (mostly controlled by financial instutions) will likely punish them or at the very least cautiously withdraw their money.

Patriotismus ist nicht Nostalgie, Patriotismus ist Vision.

Und mit dieser Behauptung ist es unerheblich, was du von Gottlieb Daimler hälst. Vielmehr zählt dein gegenwärtiger und zukünftiger Beitrag zu einer, deiner Meinung nach, lebenswerten Gesellschaft. Hier kannst du dich zu Lebzeiten aktiv einbringen.

Patriotismus hat meiner Meinung nach nichts mit Symbolik zu tun. Patriotismus benötigt nicht eine gemeinsame Flagge, er benötigt nicht die Beethoven-Büste auf dem Piano oder den Mittelklasse-Benz vor dem Eigenheim.

Patriotismus ist meiner Meinung nach nichts anderes als Nächstenliebe. Ein Patriot denkt für den Anderen mit, er arbeitet für den Anderen mit und trägt somit zu einer höheren Lebensqualität in der gesamten Gemeinschaft bei.

So sehe ich mich als Patrioten, obwohl ich jegliche Symbolik ablehne. Symbole verschleiern und vertuschen, und verhelfen Taugenichtsen ohne eigenes Zutun zu einem Status, den sie eigentlich gar nicht inne haben dürften, weil sie häufig nichts zum Gemeinwohl beitragen.

Es ist einfacher sich eine Deutschlandfahne zu kaufen und diese in den Wind zu hängen, als sich in seiner Freizeit ehrenamtlich für das Gemeinwohl zu engagieren.

Und das geht, denke ich, in die Richtung dessen, was du gesagt hast.

The problem is: Rapeseed is a weed, and a rather nasty one, if you don't happen to be growing rapeseed. It also pollinates over the air, and can cross-pollinate with other strains in their family which occur all over the place. Allowing that strain of rapeseed into the environment would mean that we couldn't grow, say, wheat any more: Everything that kills that resistant rapeseed is also kills the wheat.

That's still OK. Keep in mind that your bachelor thesis usually has a larger impact on your final grade and most theses get a rather good grade. 

Most Master programmes require students to have 2,5 or better. 

Another thing to keep in mind that before the Bologna process, the intro lectures (Math, EEng, etc.pp.) were pretty hard and used to weed out bad students. Some of this habits still exist and the lectures in the first semesters usually bring in not so great grades. So you might get better grades in later parts of your programmes. 



A lot of German students are going for a Master, but there are also job available for those with a Bachelor. It really depends on what you want to do and in which field of engineering you are. 

You can also join a Master programme later in life, in case your career stalls. This was not common before the Bologna process in Germany, but things are currently changing a bit.

As someone who has also been learning the language I really enjoy Disney movies dubbed into German. Films like UP! (Oben! in Deutsch) or Wall*E are perfect starting points due to the way they are made.

I also watch dubbed episodes of Big Bang Theory! and other American comedies which I can generally gain contextual clues as well as prior knowledge of the show in English to get my way through most of the episodes.

&gt;I never thought I would live to see a serving European Commissioner suggest that it was ""reckless"" to launch the euro without a lender-of-last resort or fiscal union to back it up.

&gt;Or that EMU policies have led to a vicious cycle and a catastrophic double-dip recession that is entirely due to the dysfunctional character of the project.

&gt;Or that the Greek debt crisis was botched because Germany’s leaders were playing politics with the North-Rhine Westphalia elections.

&gt;Or that that the internal devaluation policies forced on the victim states are cruel and inherently self defeating.

To contrast this a bit: our Bundesbankpräsident, who has a extremely warped interpretation of central bank independence, thinks everything is going fine and France should go for [more austerity.](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/waehrungsunion-europa-darf-den-stabilitaetspakt-nicht-aufweichen-1.2012175) It's quite fascinating that he basically only has to themes a) central bank independence and b) talking about fiscal policy, which is none of his business, at least that would be the case for a central banker who actually cares about central bank independence.

I think you are doing yourself a disfavor if you don't read EAP, who has a very good understanding of what is actually the European desease.

AEP believes (or affects to believe) [a lot of rather crazy things](http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Protected/Articles/000/000/008/899xhgcq.asp) (and that review is from a **right-wing** American magazine: I spare you what left-leaning pundits think of him).

In your own article, this is the damning evidence he quotes against Juncker:

&gt; I vividly remember his speech to the European Parliament in June 2005, closing Luxembourg’s EU presidency. It was a diatribe against Anglo-Saxon villainy, and an infuriating assertion that any country standing in the way of the coming superstate was motivated by petty, squalid, and immoral interests, deaf to historic destiny (here is the French transcript).

I am reasonably confident that I'm more fluent in French than AEP: after all, I live in France and work in French, even though it is not my native tongue. I went through that transcript and I couldn't find any such ""diatribe against Anglo-Saxon villainy"": it is a *very* boring speech summing up the six months of Luxembourg presidency of the Council in the first half of 2005. Maybe Juncker held such a diatribe in AEP's lizard planet, but not on Earth, anyway.

And that is pretty much the problem I have with AEP: I have tried to read his articles, I've really tried, and I'm ready to accept that there may be some nuggets of wisdom buried somewhere in the steaming pile of nonsense he otherwise serves, but I generally give up at the third of fourth line, after going through half a dozen demonstrable falsehoods.

And we have that problem. There is a problem with a north/south divide in this country and like every other way of governing, it's not perfect. Fortunately in the case of England, we share a common history and culture and fortunately in most cases  (Again, north/south divide is a thing), what is good for Manchester is also good for London.

Scotland is also a big issue. They don't feel like they're being represented in government right now (and for good reason, they are much more liberal than the UK) and thats why some of them are looking for independence. If Scotland are having such issues being governed by a country that borders them, how do you think Europe is going to manage?

We don't need federalism for either of those things.

I might do another survey another time with more potential languages, if there is support for such a thing.

true,Evsie,ENGL,♫ I am an Englishman ♫,"I think it ignores a HUGE amount of feeling among the populations of many of the current member states of resentment over the loss of national sovereignty. People like the idea of voting for people who act in their best interests... and the national best interest is not always aligned with the trans-national best interest. 

Economically, as a whole, I can see a great argument for us all being better off as a federalised collective, but the thing we econ/poli nerds often miss is that it's about more than just the economics and politics. 

There are values issues to consider. The British people *overwhelmingly* support having a nationalised health service - would nationalised industries even be allowed under the USE? Scandinavian countries have a vastly different idea of how societies should operate than, say, Eastern European countries. 

The point I suppose I'm making is that we're not a homogeneous mass, and I'm not sure ""one size fits all"" laws are suitable for a collection of nations which are still so different in terms of their economies, their beliefs and their national identities.

Personally I think if we look at the long-run arc of humanity we are going to HAVE to become ""one people"" rather than 190+ nations. At some point on that arc there will be a United Asia, Americas, Europe, Africa (we'll also have to be beyond the religious phase of our species development, have a stable global population and done something about the corporationism that has replaced capitalism)... I'm just not sure we're there yet.

Humans, culture and politics are so change-averse it's ridiculous, but it's what it is.

Would you have asked about an EU military before the 2008 crisis, you'd get a much better response though. Right now, while we would like to gain more independance from the US militarily and geopolitically, the US influence is less of a problem than increased military expenditures in times of austerity and already huge tax burdens would be: that's the disadvantage of our social system; it's rigid and many to almost all changes to it are democratically impossible to implement unless forced like in southern Europe. On top of that, European unity is more questioned today than it was 6 years ago as well as many if not all states acted als selfish individuals in dealing with this crisis. There's much more solidarity among American states than there is among European countries, despite higher intrastate solidarity than in the US.

Die Trillerpfeife ist insofern sinnlos da a) CallCenter-Mitarbeiter nicht einfach so auflegen dürfen, b) falls sie dann doch nach einer Weile, so ein bis zwei Minuten, auflegen, stellen sie - da sie nicht dazu aufgefordert wurden und ihre Chefs ihnen Stress machen, wenn sie einfach so Nummern sperren - keinen Vermerk an, der die Nummer aus dem System entfernt.

Generell gesehen bringt aber auch das nicht viel, da die Nummer nur von dem einen CallCenter gesperrt wird, aber nicht von den zig Tausenden anderen.

On the other hand you handwave away the circumstances surrounding the creation of the English nation state by saying that it doesn't matter whether it was unified by force because it enjoys widespread public support today.
I don't really see how I can't make that very same argument in favour of a creation of Europe except for the fact that you seem to be hostile to the creation of an European state by force, presumably because it doesn't align with what you want. So you deflect by appealing to history as if the continued existence of England is something that is both desirable and irreversible. While you could make an argument for the former, the latter is not at all the case.

Also for the purposes of putting my cards on the table, I have no ethical objection to the creation of an European state by force because the instrument of force has been used as recently as this year to affect a change of boundary, so I'm not so ready to say that forceful change is no longer of this day and age.

The EU operates common economic policies with hundreds of common laws, which enable a single economic market, open internal borders, a common currency and allow for numerous other areas where powers have been transferred and directly applicable laws are made. However, unlike a federation, the EU does not have exclusive powers over foreign affairs, defence and taxation.

The EU right now is both. We could go towards more of a federation or we could go more towards a confederation.

a) Currency (got)      
b) Language (this is kind of happening, most modern apps for example are launched in english and have plenty of cross Europe appeal)     
c) Regulation. If I launch a product in one country it should be fine in ALL the countries in the EU. If I can't trust this, I'll rather just go found my company in the US      

Now this triggers further issues because the currency would ideally be in an Optimum Currency Area (OCA) which has several requirements so it doesn't fuck up your economy. Like:     
* Mobility of the work force (language harmonization and border controls...)     
* Capital mobility and less rigid salary structures. Some union related bargaining would have to move to the EU level etc

Despite reddit comments, that is declining a bit, especially as more WWII veterans die.  My wife's grandfather lead some of the largest bombing raids on Berlin and has all kinds of medals, it's hard not to be proud of him.  But once people like that pass, and it becomes something in a book, it is less ""real."" 

Also passing is in the US is the fear that Germany is this entity that must be controlled.  I remember hearing from my grandparents (my grandfather was general infantry, US army) that Germany tried to take over the world twice, and they would try again.  They even got nervous when Germany reunified.  But I think we can all see that Germany is a rational nation, and it has really put nationalism behind it and truly atoned for everything it did wrong.  Maybe it is harder for people in Europe to accept that?  Or just some people?

As for Japan, they have not put nationalism behind them, and have not atoned.  I'd hardly trust them as much as the Germans.  But I'm not going to stop them from increasing their military.  It makes our position in the pacific stronger.  

&gt;On top of that, European unity is more questioned today than it was 6 years ago as well as many if not all states acted als selfish individuals in dealing with this crisis.

Well, I was trying to gauge this as well.  I'm still not sure if people in this sub are being serious, like when I see a Pole or someone from the Baltics talking about not trusting Germany.  Than how can you be in a union with them?  

Also, when I see that no one is helping Italy with patrols to intercept the migrants, it really makes me question how seriously anyone takes this whole thing.  If you do not care about the territorial integrity of your union, what do you care about?  It isn't like the migrants just stay in Italy anyway, they make problems for everyone.

&gt;There's much more solidarity among American states than there is among European countries, despite higher intrastate solidarity than in the US.

Please don't take this the wrong way, but I find it kind of ironic that a Belgian would talk about intrastate solidarity.  This weekend I met a Luxembourger (though born in Montenegro) who just moved to the US, he speaks 7 language and was an interpreter for the EU in Brussels.  He told me that if you went 10KM outside Brussels and spoke French, people gave you quite dirty looks.  He was under the impression that Walloons and Flemish hate each other, and it is one country in name only.  He lived in Belgium for 10 years, I take his word.  He was very pessimistic about all the separatism and nationalism in Europe as a whole.

What about Spain?  Do they have high intrastate solidarity?  No.  

Ugh, this is making me pessimistic for Europe.

To him, the only hope for a Europe devastated by war was to federate along lines that the Hungarian-born Romanian Aurel Popovici and others had proposed for the by then just dissolved multinational Empire of Austria-Hungary. According to Coudenhove-Kalergi, Pan-Europe would encompass and extend a more flexible and more competitive Austria-Hungary, with English serving as world language, spoken by everyone in addition to his native tongue. He believed that individualism and socialism would learn to cooperate instead of compete, and urged that capitalism and communism cross-fertilize each other just as the Protestant Reformation had spurred the Catholic Church to regenerate itself.[7]

My comment is aimed at this entire discussion as though ""Algerians rioting"" is both unique to that population *and* a predetermined inevitable expression from that community purely due to some set of degenerate efforts. That's really it. The systemic view is ""racism,"" and that's why people called out these comments as being racist (and got downvoted).

So what I'm offering is ""nuance."" A sense of, you know... informed perspective. I'd be happy to link to more. It is probably more valuable than only linking to *one* article that confirms the one perspective of the events. The headline of the article you linked to is ""Violence mars Algerian reaction to events"" - i.e., Algerians are violent and can't celebrate correctly. What I liked to is a group of articles that suggest that maybe the violence was *not* the central story of their celebration to that game, *and* that there's a historical framework at play.

Here's the thing: you want to know why the streets are loud after the match? Because a big-fucking-deal just happened for Algerians, and they're happy. I know it is hard to let them, but there are a number of reasons they're happy. 

&gt; what I am confused about is this :

&gt; &gt;The US is known for horrific celebrations of meaningless games.

&gt; This is the first time I have ever heard anything like that. I’ve never seen cars burnt in America after a match and would like to know where you got that info from.

Are you serious? You've *never* heard of US celebrations getting out of hand...? In fact, this has to be satire. You can't have been overseas long enough to have never seen or heard of them...  (note: Granted, I say ""meaningless"" meaning *every* match is meaningless. Most often, though, riots happen with championship games. I just don't care about them)

Good lord. I'm not even going to link to the many stories of riots in the US in the past 20 years. Yes, the *car burnings* aren't all *that* common in the US, but the street violence is ever present. US rioters are more fond of street fires, window smashings, and the occasional light post toppling.

Topics such as data protection, corporate governance, energy sustainability, and multi-leveled governance have drastically changed the spectrum of political dialogue.

And that's not one time...they've refused Germany to inspect it for decades 

&gt;For decades, German central bankers have contented themselves with written affirmations from their American colleagues that the gold still remains where it is said to be stored. According to the report, the bar list from New York stems from ""1979/1980."" The report also noted that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York refuses to allow the gold's owners to view their own reserves.

Then the following decades in which they weren't allowed to see them

&gt;Finally, in 2007, ""following numerous enquiries,"" Bundesbank staff members were allowed to see the facility, but they reportedly only made it to the anteroom of the German reserves.

&gt;In fact, auditors from the Bundesbank made a second visit in May 2011. This time one of the nine compartments was also opened, in which the German gold bars are densely stacked. A few were pulled out and weighed. But this part of the report has been blacked out -- out of consideration for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

&gt;""I would like more transparency on the issue,"" says Bundesbank board member Thiele. The Americans are very sensitive, though, when it comes to security procedures in their gold storage facilities. **In their second major depository, the legendary Fort Knox, practically no one in recent decades has been allowed to view the gold reserves.**

You might be right. The amount of years they tried to get an audit and were denied could be as benign as bureaucratic procedure. Doubt it though.

&gt;The __demography of Germany__ is monitored by the ""Statistisches Bundesamt"" ([Federal Statistical Office of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Statistical_Office_of_Germany)). According to the first census since the [reunification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification), Germany's population was counted to be 80,219,695 on May 9, 2011,  making it the 16th most populous country in the world. Germany's population is characterized by zero or declining growth,  with an aging population and smaller cohort of youths. The total fertility rate has been rated around 1.4 in 2010   (the highest value since 1990 ) and has recently even been estimated at 1.6 after accounting for the fact that older women contribute more to the number of births than in previous statistic models, and total fertility rates increased in younger generations.  Fertility was closely linked to educational achievement (with the less educated women having more children than the educated ones).  Persons who adhere to no religion have fewer children than Christians, and studies also found that among Christians the more conservative ones had more children than the more liberal ones.   [In vitro fertilisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation) is legal in Germany, with an age limit set at 40.

Ich sehe, du bringst den Dialog wieder in einen von dir gewollten Kontext und reduzierst dabei die Diskussion auf einen einzigen Satz aus dem Duden.

Patriotismus ist die Liebe zum Vaterland. Und das Vaterland ist das Land, in dem eine Person geboren wurde, bzw in dem diese Person verwurzelt ist.

Somit wäre für mich persönlich die Frage nach dem Vaterland geklärt, es ist für mich die Bundesrepublik Deutschland. 

Kann man jemanden als Patrioten bezeichnen, der den höchsten Verdienstorden seines Vaterlandes verliehen bekam?

Ich denke hier an das deutsche Bundesverdienstkreuz.

Dies ist der höchste Orden den mein Vaterland, die Bundesrepublik Deutschland, zu verleihen hat. Man möge annehmen, dass Orden eines Nationalstaates für herausragende Verdienste am Vaterland verliehen werden. Ein Bundesverdienstkreuzträger ist also offiziell anerkannter und ausgezeichneter Patriot. Wenn der nicht Patriot ist, wer dann?

Wenn du dir nun anschaust, für welche Leistungen dieser Orden verliehen wird, kannst du vielleicht auch besser einschätzen, was allgemein und offiziell als patriotisches Handeln angesehen wird. Und soziales Engagement aufgrund von Nächstenliebe wird bei der Vergabe dieses Ordens ganz groß geschrieben.

Dissert: ""Quels sont les effets de l'internationalisation des échanges sur les emplois dans les pays industrialisés?"" 
 
Synthèse + questions:  
1) Montrez que la baisse du taux de syndicalisation résulte en partie de transformations socioéconomiques  
2) L'institutionnalisation des syndicats n'a-t-elle qu'un effet négatif?  
3) Quels facteurs influencent le taux de syndicalisation?  
4) Exposez les transformations significatives que ce graphique met en évidence (Graphique: Evolution des résultats des élections prud'homales sur 30 ans)  
5) En quoi le conseil des prud'hommes illustre-t-il le rôle actuel des syndicats?  
6) Montrez que le champ d'action des syndicats ne se limite pas à la gestion des conflits  
Question finale: Après avoir expliqué les évolutions du syndicalisme, vous montrerez que les syndicats restent des acteurs importants dans l'action collective.

Trouve une citation qui appuie ton point de vue dans ce cas... Je t'attends de pied ferme.

En plus c'est débile, le simple fait qu'il existe au sein du FN et depuis toujours de très nombreuses lignes et une véritable pluralité politique suffit à dézinguer toute accusation de totalitarisme ou même d'extrémisme politique...

&gt;Le FN s'articule sur des axes du fascisme/extremisme

Tiens on va rigoler : quelle est ta définition d'extrémisme et de fascisme ?

&gt;l'idée du retour de la nation face a la multi diversité

Faux dilemme. Ces deux notions ne sont pas incompatibles.

Et rien dans le programme du FN ne remet en cause la diversité de la France. Il n'y a qu'à regarder le programme concernant les DOM pour s'en convaincre.

Ensuite, l'amalgame fasciste et discours sur l'identité nationale et le retour de la nation, c'est complètement débile à moins de qualifier de Gaulle de fasciste et d'extrémiste...

&gt;le discours de la supériorité de la race blanche

Il n'y a jamais eu ce genre de discours au FN. Jamais. C'est un mensonge et tu le sais très bien.

&gt;Et sans parler des origines extremistes du FN (collaborationistes, colonialistes, royalistes, nationalistes et j'en passe)

[Et aussi de nombreux résistants](http://www.prechi-precha.fr/liste-de-quelques-resistants-qui-ont-fait-le-fn/). De plus, ça montre la pluralité des opinions au sein du FN. Tu devrais relire effectivement Hannah Arendt. 

&gt;combat contre des castes prétendues dominantes

C'est du populisme, mais ça n'a rien à voir avec de l'extrémisme ou du fascisme. Le FN n'est pas révolutionnaire et ne veut pas l'avènement d'un homme nouveau. Par contre, il se soucie du peuple, qui est, je dois le rappeler, le souverain.

As to who else was burning cars and smashing bottles debate. Im not interested, to me it was much more than that. 


I wouldn’t go as far as calling a lot of those *bar fights* full on riots (Vancouver excluded). Not saying there weren’t a few instances where it got very pointlessly violent and did turn into a slugfest, because there’s proof but take a place like Duffy’s in Miami, can seat about ~450+ people + 7 boats. If a fight broke out between ~20+ people of course its going to be called a riot by the media. Its in fact a fight. I’m pretty sure that’s what goes on here too. 

I’m not disputing you but the very first article linked mentioned 200 sports-related riots in America over the past 50 years but doesn’t provide another link as to what they may be. Ill have to look them up when I get home and see if any have happened in FL. I remember the Broncos win against the Falcons in 1999 and don’t remember it being too crazy but then again I wasn’t in Denver. Maybe I’m just a shitty fan and don’t look into too much of that (Dolphins/Marlins fan here, we never win) and maybe its just too damn hot for us to riot but I have never personally seen anything like that back home, then again we haven’t won an NCAA since 07.",0,1403623499,null,0,false,0,cifsl4c,t3_28tk78,t1_cifsl4c,t1_cifq8f5,null,1434381499,1,false,paris,t5_2qkoi,1

That is the problem, Ireland ISN'T playing the game. So, by focusing on Ireland, Holland, etc and these loopholes, 'the game' isn't been dealt with at all. It is a genius deflection really if you think about it, but, as you said yourself, those bankers are clever.

This crash was inevitable, especially for the likes of Greece which has had a long standing reputation for financial irresponsibility. It clearly was not ready for the Eurozone, nor vice versa. 

It is undoubtedly not Greece's fault, Germany, Ireland etc. were all behaving irresponsibly and in unsustainable fashions and in the end what we got is the Eurocrisis. We were all using the same set of tools but not marching to the same rhythm. This is an argument for either two things, depending on how you look at it;

Less integration; Dissolve the Eurozone and the Euro, go back to national currencies. This would go a way towards helping to solve this, but would bring back all the problems that lead to the founding of the Euro in the first place - and yes, that was a very political move but it did have its reasons. 

More integration; With a unified fiscal policy we wont be able to fuck eachother over so much in the future and this crisis wont happen again.

Got it.  Solche Artikel enthalten meist so viel verstecke Ironie und Humor, so was muss man einfach lesen. Here we go

&gt;[""SS-Rune"", Pole, Aufmerksamkeit für Rückreise, blablabla ... ]
&gt;Möglicherweise wollte er das tatsächlich.

Ja, aber nur ganz ganz vielleicht. Also eigentlich nicht. Ich find' ja folgendes Szenario viel wahrscheinlicher:
1. Geld für WM-Karte ausgeben, muss definitiv ein Spiel mit Deutschland sein
2. Flug von Polen nach und Unterkunft in Brasilien bezahlen
3. Falsche Telefonnummer und Email-Adresse ausdenken und auf Körper malen. Muss ""44"" enthalten, damit man versteckt die SS-Runen zeigen kann. Wichtig!
4. Mit sehr sehr viel Glück der ganzen Welt für ein paar Sekunden die versteckten SS-Runen im Fernsehen zeigen, weil.... ehm... SS... yey! ... ehm... wat
5. Nach Hause fliegen
6. Stolz den SS-Kameraden in Polen über diesen großartigen Sieg der Slawischen Rasse erzählen... wait a minute

Was für ein Glück, dass der Pole (sind besonders bekannt als Fans der Nazis und Sowjets btw.) das gemacht hat. Sonst hätte man ein noch mehr an den Haaren herbeigezogenen Anfang für den Artikel finden müssen. Vielleicht ein Buddhist mit dem Rad der Lehre als Tattoo, was man dann als Schwarze Sonne interpretieren könnte? Das wär' doch was. 

Als nächstes wird natürlich ein Antifa Blogeintrag verlinkt, der Rassismus auf Twitter gesammelt hat. Na hey, auf geht 's, Antifa und Rassisten, das kann ja nur gut werden.

&gt;Da einige Twitter User ua. wegen dieses Blogsposts Morddrohungen erhalten sind nun alle Screenshots anonymisiert und die Links zu den Tweets entfernt.

Ahahahah.... ich kann nicht mehr. Fängt ja schon mal gut an. Nichts zeugt mehr von einer antifaschistischen Grundeinstellung, also Leuten mit Mord zu drohen die eine andere Meinung als die eigene aufweisen, richtig? 

Zwischen den paar screens von wirklich rassistischen tweets, lerne ich dann: 
1. Wenn man sehr verärgert auf den taunt beim Torjubel anderer reagiert, ist das nicht nur albern, aber man muss zuvor auch die Hautfarbe aller Involvierten kontrollieren. Ist das Ergebnis zu... kontrastreich, ist man wahrscheinlich Rassist
2. Offensichtlicher Sarkasmus ist bemerkenswert, wenn man ein hashtag in den tweet einbaut. #kasperverein
3. Wortspiele die sich auf Hautfarbe beziehen sind Rassismus, denn spielerischer Umgang mit der simplen Realität von unterschiedlichen Hautfarben ist... ehm.. ja... Rassismus. Seid bitte noch mehr verkrampft, danke. Manchmal frag ich mich ob die Leute die immer laut Rassismus schreien, schon mal mehr als 5 Minuten mit Menschen anderer Herkunft verbracht haben. 
4.  Satire über Rassismus ist rassistisch... [wat](http://littlefun.org/uploads/5217a194c856110b13000006_736.jpg)
5. Und deswegen ist das hier offensichtlich auch Rassismus und voll ernst gemeint: [oh cmon...](http://lichterkarussell.net/wp-content/uploads/Bildschirmfoto-2014-06-22-um-10.39.361.jpg)

Und immer dran denken:
&gt;Merke: Deutschland ist scheiße und ihr seid die Beweise!

Diese Antifa-Helden, die die schwere Last auf sich nehmen, in der Scheiße zu leben. Mein tiefster Respekt. Ein besseres Leben könnte man ja z.b. in Ghana führen, aber nein, hier wird tapfer durchgehalten! Das ist ja fast schon deutsch :o

&gt;Aufwertung durch Abwertung, so das Prinzip, das international schnell fremdenfeindliche Züge wie das ""Blackfacing"" annimmt, gegen das die Fifa mittlerweile ermittelt. 
&gt;[put tweet here]
&gt;Dem Alltagsrassismus in sozialen Netzwerken wie Twitter ist schwieriger beizukommen als dem im Stadion. 

Da wird halt ein tweet von so einem amerikanischen ""[Twitteraktivisten](https://twitter.com/jdubblewu)"" dazwischen gepackt, dessen Profil sich beim Überfliegen ein paar Dutzender tweets so zusammenfassen lässt: #white bad, #color good
Da wird halt so was retweeted: https://twitter.com/MochaLisaccino/status/480951192840065024
Jep, richtig, selbst wenn man von sich selbst behauptet dass man Leute mit anderer Hautfarbe nicht unterschiedlich behandelt, man aber weiß ist, ist man immer noch ein Unterdrücker und versucht gerade dadurch Menschen die Kultur zu nehmen. Dabei hab ich doch eben gelernt, dass wenn man Hauptfarbe wahrnimmt, man ein Rassist ist. Ich bin verwirrt, wahrscheinlich weil ich weiß und schuldig bin. Oder, moment... (Alltags-)Rassismus ist es nur, wenn jemand mit heller Hautfarbe was zu jemanden mit dunklerer Hautfarbe sagt, richtig? 
 
In dem Zusammenhang mit der Kultur find' ich auch den re-tweet perfekt:
&gt;Please don't pretend #Ger fans have no idea that blackface is racist. I lived there for years. They're well aware of the meaning.

Yep. Richtig. Jeder auf der Welt muss wissen was blackface in der amerikanischen Kultur bedeutet. Und nur die Interpretation aus dieser amerikanischen Perspektive ist zulässig!

&gt;Der polnische Flitzer wurde am Ende einfach vom Platz eskortiert. Viele der Kommentare auf Twitter und Facebook stehen noch immer.

Schon wieder der arme Pole? Was genau hat den nochmal zum Faschisten gemacht und was hat der nochmal mit Rassismus auf Twitter zu tun? Sorry, hab den Anfang schon wieder vergessen.

&gt;And as a Brit, while I agree with what you say, you government needs to start backing us publicly, in open, if you want us to stay. Wanting us to stay is not going to be enough any more. Britain feels isolated in Europe because countries like The Netherlands do not back us publicly. 

I don't know how British media sees it but in the Netherlands it has come to the point where people are so annoyed with Cameron's public rants that they don't even care anymore. And to be honest: ever since the UK didn't join the Euro people forgot about the European 'triangle' (UK, France, Germany) and focus on the French-German aspect of leadership in the EU. Cameron behaves like a kid who isn't allowed candy and then continually threatens to run away from the house.

In stead of constantly reminder everyone that the UK will leave (seriously, no one cares if you do.) you should create a vision of your own EU (more subsidiarity, letting EU focus on global issues or whatever you want).

I am pretty much a news junkie and I'm interested in politics but I seriously do not know what the fuck Britain wants. You rant against Juncker, but why? Like it mattered if Barosso was the EU commission president or someone else.

The German sollution to our problems seems to be more EU. What is the British solution. Because Britain leaving is only a solution to you. Not to the rest of Europe. So there is no point in publicly back that.

true,Trucidator,UKGB,City of London,"&gt; Yes, but are you sure that you cannot influence because you do not share any interest with any other ally in the EU, or because of the incompetence of the negotiators?

The main problem in my mind is that most Brits just have a very different vision of Europe from most Europeans. All other problems derive from this basic fact. Our vision of an ideal Europe is still just a glorified common market and there are very very few Brits who really believe in a federal Europe in the way that you do.

The consequence of this different vision is that our starting point and our end point in negotiations is different and also that far fewer Brits really want to become negotiators at EU level, especially given that the project is heading in a federal direction. This then means that we get a bad deal in some respects which then increases EUscepticism further. Also, are any young bright British students currently going to want to pursue a career in EU-level negotiations? They just saw UKIP top the poll in May. We likely have a referendum in 2017. We're never joining the euro and the rest of the EU is moving to federalism. The writing is on the wall. :-)

P.S: I actually applied for and accepted an EU job last year in a finacial regulation field, though a legal job not a policy job. I ended up not taking it though :-)

Oh sorry. I do. I meant that the general population, our politicians and media don't. And I think this is the same in other countries. The 'we will leave' is more or less ignored or seen as an empty treath  

&gt;This speech summarises Cameron's vision on the EU. Is this something you back?

I've seen it before. It is a good speech and vision but it is not what is needed. People (average Harry) aren't interested in reading long speeches. They want one-liners and popular statements. The Germans and French (and other supporters of a federal EU) are constantly using one-liners like ""without a banking union the Euro will fail!"", ""more authority to Brussels is needed for a strong EU"", ""we need the EU to not be overrun by China and India!"". 

Of course, none of these statements are true. We never had a banking union and we did fine from 1998 until 2008. Also, it is not the Euro as such that is costing us money. It is countries like the PIIGS who are costing us money. The Euro is seen as reason why we should help these people but it really isn't. The reason we helped Greece was to save our owns banks. The Euro wouldn't have collapsed if Greece went bankrupt, the banking system would. But because these one-liners are repeated in the media constantly people are starting to believe it. And the only one-liner they see from the Brits is: ""Britain will leave if we don't get our way"".

So in stead of constantly reminding everyone to leave you should launch a counter campaign that people can relate to. ""A strong EU is an EU with strong nation states"", ""No to a United States of Europe, yes to cooperation"".

Just keep repeating ""with more authority for Brussels the EU will end up like the USA"". That should get people's blood pumping. Who cares if it isn't 100% the truth. You need to present yourself as the a country that wants to be in Europe but not in an USE, rather than presenting yourself as a troubled kid that will run away from the house if he doesn't get his way.

I kind of agree with you here. If the UK came up with a single sensible policy option that could be summarised in one clear sentence, then that could be acceptable both to a majority of Brits and many Continentals, that might have worked. But I think it is now probably too late.

Also, why is this just the UK's responsibility? The UK believes that the Dutch, the Danes, the Swedes and others are similarly opposed to the idea of a USE: but somehow it seems to be the UK that gets to be the spokesperson. It would be a major help if the Dutch were a little louder at times!

Okay also ich hab mir diese Seite mal angeschaut und ich fand die Idee ganz cool, hab auch schonmal an sowas gedacht und wie gesagt die Grundidee find ich echt klasse.

Was mir aufgefallen ist, ist dass viele Sachen wirklich keine Achievements seihen sollten. Ich meine sowas wie ""Geschirr direkt nach dem Essen gemacht"" oder ""Jemand fremden Gesundheit nach dem Niesen gewünscht"" ist und sollte kein Achievement sein sonder vermutlich eher ""systemvorraussetzungen""

Ausserdem sind viele sachen nicht wirklich ""reallife"", quasi genau das Gegenteil von dem was man heute unter ""reallife"" versteht. ""Retro Computerspiel angemacht"" wäre tatsächlich das Gegenteil von IRL. und manche Sachen sind auch einfach das Gegenteil von Achievement aber wie gesagt ich glaub da bin ich eh zu nitpickig.

Wenn man die Community nach Lust und laune sachen erstellen lässt kann das schnell aus dem Ruder laufen denk ich mal. (Ich gebe zu ich hab mir den Mechanismus noch nicht angeguckt) Nicht dass dann da irgendwann steht ""Monika aus dem Monika-Lierhaus-Gymnasium in Bottrop auf den Po gehauen"", also ein System mit kontrollierten Einreichungen machen (Ratings oder upvotes oder was weiß ich). 

30 Prozent der Achievements haben gefühlt damit zu tun ob man Deutschland auf irgendeine Art und weise angefeuert hat - Ich liebe Fußball aber das ist lame!

Was ich cooler fänd wären mehr ""krassere"" oder aufwendigere Sachen. Also weniger ""7 mal auf Snooze gedrückt"" und ""Einen Energydrink getrunken um wach zu bleiben"" und mehr ""Einen Berg bestiegen der über 5000m hoch ist"". Oder man lässt alle zu und bewertet sie dann mit einer Art Gamerscore: Energy-Drink-Achivement? 10 G; 5000m-Berg? 10000 oder so, Dann hätte man auch gleich mehr Motivation mal solche Sachen machen. und dann die Ganz fetten Dinger nur mit Proof oder so zulassen.

Nothing in financial politics is *natural*. All currencies are imagined constructs. You could say ""Italy artificially devalued its currency for decades"". They are both sentences devoid of real meaning.

The reason they are used is to imply a certain moral judgement. Artificial sounds bad and makes it seem like it's all a cunning plan to destroy southern Europe.

In fact it is the opposite. Loooooooong before the Euro we had something called the Exchange Rate Mechanism. It was meant to reduce currency fluctuations in Europe. Countries could only devalue so much. 

Why did we do this? Because heavily fluctuating currency exchange rates are bad for (1) the common market and (2) the people.

I know most people here are in favour ^^^(please_dont_downvote_because_you_disagree). And I could present you with reasons why it won't work and all. But the most important reason is: my gut. And I say this not because of nationalism, but because I sincerely believe that it would just be too big.

I think that what most people that are in favour of a USE seem to not think about the consequences of having one government for 500 million+ people. 

I don't know how this goes in bigger countries like France or Germany, but in the Netherlands, despite having 17 million inhabitants, has some social control. In Dutch we have the phrase ""maatschappelijke onrust"". Freely translated: ""social commotion"". It is a phrase used when 'the people' don't agree with something. And when this happens you immediately see unions, the media, experts and other actors/stakeholders standing up and trying to influence the policy. This prevents politicians and the government from proposing legislation that companies lobbied for.

There is no such thing in Europe. We don't have European unions or a European media. Every country has its own media that focuses on domestic policy, EU politicians from their own country and EU legislation that affects them.

If you look at the US you can see what happens when you put a government far away from its people. Businesses sweep in to lobby for their own good, politicians don't seem to care about protests and there is no social control. And this last one is the most important for me.

In the EU we are already seeing the kind of lobbying we see in the US. French companies like Veolia, Suez environment and others tried to lobby the EU commission to mandate all nation states to privatize their water supply. And they had the [French EU commissioner for Internal Market] on their side. I'm sure it is merely a coincidence that the companies could provide such services when governments have to outsource it.

You might also remember that the Euro parliament [tried to ban](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/23/olive-oil-producers-rage-european-u-turn) refillable bottles for Olive Oils in restaurants. This was stopped because it happened to gain coverage in national media in multiple countries. But legislation like these, micro-managing the EU from Brussels, are passed on a daily basis.

Or look at the enormous amount of subsidies that the EU gives to farmers. Nearly half of the EU budget goes to farmers. And changing it is impossibly. French farmers will simply drive their tractors into Paris and force the French government to veto any change. And look: [EU becomes world's top food exporter](http://www.dw.de/eu-becomes-worlds-top-food-exporter/a-17730965). Meanwhile the big companies are laughing there ass of: they produce so much food that they can use the subsidies they get to export it for dump-prices. The top 10 of subsidy recievers in France contains multi-nationals like [Doux](http://www.observatoiredessubventions.com/2012/principaux-beneficiaires-de-la-pac/), a huge industrial chicken company. 

And I'm afraid that lobbying efforts like these will continue to grow if we give the EU more power. And then it will become increasingly hard to stop it from happening. Look at the US and net neutrality. The ISPs lobbied the government to install their own head lobbyist as the head of the regulatory agency. And despite pretty much the entire internet and organisations like the EFF protesting; they can't do much. 

So: no, I am not in favour of creating a United States of Europe (in disregard of the poorly chosen name). I like my country the way it is actually and I'm not willing to bet it all. ",0,1403628473,null,0,false,0,cifv61q,t3_28y8or,t1_cifv61q,t3_28y8or,null,1434382781,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,threep03k64,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; The U.S. is also the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world. 

Speaking only for myself I don't see the big deal in living in a 'powerful' country. The US has many things going for it for sure but if you give me the choice between living in a country with the most powerful military, or a country with greater wealth equality and free healthcare I'm going for the latter.

In general I agree with you that the US is a good example of federalization, but I don't think it is one that Europe can follow. You mention that the US has managed to craft a strong American identity (which I think is important in federalisation) but I think the nations of Europe have been separate for too long for that kind of identity to form. The US is most certainly a product of its own circumstances, so a Federal Europe will have to find its own path.

true,McBricks,null,null,"&gt;As for his defence of further integration, why was that anti-British? As far as I know, the British government also signed the Lisbon Treaty, and the British parliament ratified it.

And a majority now want to leave the EU. Guess the British aren't too fond of more integration. 

&gt;And what does this have to do with the Treaty of Lisbon, which only became effective starting 2009?

It has to do with current European policies being a complete and utter failure, based on a warped integration which is not of a fiscal nature, as in there is no EU unemployment insurance, there is no real banking union, no Eurobonds, no federal taxes, and there won't be, since Germany (we call it ""debt union"") doesn't want that, so the EU will be dragging itself along until one or more countries leave the euro. Monetary union without fiscal union is a disaster, which I think I showed with very plausible evidence. So the Lisbon treaty, which was effective before shit really hit the fan in 2010, is flawed, likely beyond repair. The EU does not improve the life of the citizens it actually had a provable detrimentral effect as can be seen in industrial production, unemployment, bank balance sheets, GDP, debt to GDP, growth potential. The last one being the most damning. Greece and Spain will not even be back to 2008 levels before this decade ends.

Oh come on. You know how it goes. Small countries can't afford to start making a public fuzz and going strongly against Germany or France. If we do that we fuck ourselves in other negotiations in the EU. And what would happen if we publicly back you and you decide to leave anyway? 

Then the Netherlands will be in the same position the UK was when it decided to choose the US over France/Germany regarding the Iraq war. It cost you the EU presidency (Blair was a widely support candidate, including by both France and Germany). 

&gt;Also, why is this just the UK's responsibility?

Because you are the only big country that supports this idea. And just like in the UN: big countries strong-arm smaller countries. People in the Netherlands always said 'the traingle' when the big countries would discuss something: UK, France and Germany. Now they started calling it 'Merkozy' or France-Germany. Do you see the difference? 

Because you publicly threaten to leave people stop taking you seriously. Germany and France are not a 100% happy with how the EU is at the moment.

true,GK258,CZEC,Czech Republic,"You can't really ""minimize nationalisms"" by this move. Nationalism - even though personally I do not consider a healthy dose of one bad at all - will take its own course in the minds of people.

The united Europe is very tricky. First, at least here in CZE people do not really realize to what extent the EU is already federalized - EU law has superiority over national one (even constitutional one as per the EU Court's rulings, even though most of national Con. Courts do not respect that) and most of the important policies are already managed by Brussels or jointly. As per the Central Bank, you already have one that has some significant power over the other national banks of Eurozone countries.

What would be great about USE (Except for a diferent name goddamnit, how 'bout something like European Confederation?) is the fact that it would be a freaking superpower of half a billion people with a pretty much unmatched economical power - the EU itself has done quite a lot in the economy field despite some bullshit that can make it look bad, but the free trade zone and stuff are something incredibly great.

Yet, we have to bear in mind that this idea is not very popular among general population I believe, and forcing it on people would be very unwise. This is mostly because the current system and structure of the EU and its work is so damn complicated that many people fail to understand why it is important and what does it really do for us both good and bad. Also, most EU states have 1000+ years of existence, national identity and sometimes a very different culture, and all those factors would have to be respected by the European State. This is why the centralisation would have as low as possible except for some key areas.

The member states would be allowed to keep their constitutions and their system of government as long as they are democratic and respect basic rights - so every MS would have a head of state, government, parliament and judiciary with their own laws.

The Confederation would need a major overhaul to heal the so called ""democratic deficit"". The Parliament could consist of a Senate similar to US one with, say, 10 senators for every state and a lower chamber proportionally representing the population of the Confederation, both chambers having somewhat equal powers without the possibility of overriding one or another.

The executive is where it gets though. The different nationalities would have to be proportionally represented in the confederal government, the Prime Minister would probably be the leader of majority in the lower house and the President could be indirectly elected by the both chambers in a process guaranteeing that the vote will not be revolving around nationalist tendencies. ((I would prefer a presidential system very much. But I can't imagine how could it work here... =( ))

What would such a confederation need to have on a fully federal level would probably be:

* Defence - Key area. EU sucks at this now IMHO as we rely on the NATO and USA to have our ass, the capabilites of EU to wage war as shown in Libya are pretty lame and it may be something we could regret later. Joint European military could be incredibly powerful if EU actually cared about it at all.

* Finance - Eurozone is in a deep shit though and lots of problems of the southern states can be in my opinion attributed to Euro and the lack of monetary policies the states could use. Maybe the confederacy would be better off without common currency.

* Foreign policies - While I would allow the member states to have limited subjectivity in the international law allowing them to make separate treaties etc, unified foreign policy would benefit everyone. Sane foreign policy, though.

* Economy - Carefully. Mostly stuff related to free market protection and generally just keeping the hands off the market and just enforcing the rules. Such a (con)federation would have to be very careful about the differences between, say, Bulgaria and France though. The huge inequality of states would be the biggest threat to such a state and it cannot be solved by just pouring money from A to B.

The rest should be kept to states with the Confederacy's limited power to supervise/assist in certain areas.

Now this is something I have written on the spot with some little knowledge of the EU law/system and some general thoughts on how could it work. Balancing a constitutional system of such a country would be pretty hard, but this may be some good start.",0,1403629264,null,0,false,0,cifvlmc,t3_28y8or,t1_cifvlmc,t3_28y8or,null,1434382986,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

The rest of the world gets even worse of a show, unless it is a commonwealth nation, or somewhere Britain went to war recently (Afghanistan, Iraq, Argentina but not the Balkans). 

On the whole, with the demise of print, and cost pressures on TV news, British newspapers, like others, have cut foreign coverage.

However, the UK does have a great asset in the BBC world-service (sadly the recent subject of huge government cutbacks). That means you tend to pick up some in depth coverage of lesser reported nations (particularly in  sub saharan Africa, which the rest of the media treat as a blindspot). Though, this isn't entirely unique and I often find other news organisations like NPR do it better.

On the whole, foreign coverage is pretty good for the USA and former colonies, but the rest of the world rarely warrants a glance.

European Court can over-rule national courts, and it has for the first time in Italy this year. It was a case about a family wanting to have their child take the mothers name. Italy, and more specifically Rome now has to rewrite the law in accordance with the European Courts decision. 

&gt;Which most people see as a symbol for a federal Europe rather than a symbol for all European people.

Source? That also doesnt change the fact that there is one.

&gt;Yeah, I found that out a few months ago when someone mentioned it on Reddit. Pretty sure 99% of the European people don't know there is one and that 99,99999% don't know what it sounds like.

I dont know what it sounds like, but we still have it =/

&gt;There is also no point in doing this. Look at the UK!

Yea, though i do recall them trying to pass a law, that requires an EU flag being on the uniform of all member states, in additional to the national flag. Not sure the status on that. I know UK representatives lost their shit, and then the Dutch requested to also put their flag on English uniforms as a joke.

Man muss immer unterscheiden ob Inbound oder Outbound und welche Anforderungen da sind. Bei der Telekom und 1&amp;1 z.b. musste ich aktiv das 'neueste' Anbieten, heißt verkaufen, obwohl Kunden nur wegen Rechnungsfragen u.ä. angerufen haben (Entertain bei der Telekom, Handyverträge und DSL Kombipakete bei 1&amp;1). Bei mobilcom-debitel war das ganze im eigenen Ermessen ob ich dem Kunden etwas anbiete, dort war das dann aber eher eine Sache von ""Tarif von vor zig Jahren und total veraltet sowie überteuert, dem schlag ich jetzt persönlich mal einen besseren Tarif vor"".

Outbound ist auch wieder eine andere Sache. Da gibt es Umfragen von z.b. Autowerkstätten zur Kundenzufriedenheit, Anrufe bezügl. Abos von Zeitschrift (bei Bestandskunden), die Telekom ruft gerne an um DSL Verträge anzubieten weil man einmal sich prepaid bei diesen geholt hat.


Zu Kunden die völlig ausflippen: ruhig und sachlich bleiben, nicht auf eine persönliche Ebene gehen. Ich kann den Kunden auch nur die Fakten mitteilen, auch wenn diese meinen es besser zu wissen. Hatte ich bisher aber wenige von welche sich auch recht schnell wieder beruhigen liesen.

true,TheApatheist,BELG,Belgium,"I only have time to reply to the last part about Belgium, which I find completely wrong and I'm saying this as someone who has consistently voted for Flemish parties.

The situation is not anywhere as grave as the Luxemburgian made you believe in my opinion. Are there problems? Of course there are, but we don't hate each other and despite our complicated history, there's just about never been any violence which I would say is quite a unique feat for two constrasting groups within a nation. Never did we see an IRA, ETA or any other sectarian movements and I am proud of Belgium, both the Dutch as the French side, that we've always resolved our issues peacefully.

There are three major issues within Belgium though: 

The first is a rather large difference in political opinion which leads to problems forming coalitions, not because we hate each other, but because we just differ in opinion and must lead together, to which I'd like to add that we've always found common ground so far to form a government. Imagine the US as a federation of 2 states: the North East and the South, a liberal and a very conservative part, and they vote seperately for seperate parties that only have to defend their seats in their constituency so obviously can't give in too much to the needs of the other side or they lose votes in their side. They need to agree on 1 government, with a parity of secretaries/ministers and 1 common president ... it would be very difficult, but so far we succeeded each time and even when it took 550 days, no violence broke out, the country kept running peacefully and nothing noteworthy happened. Some of us take pride in our Belgian ability to overcome differences, be diplomatic/pragmatic and move on.

The second issue is a disparity in income and thus a disparity in taxes and expenses: the North with 60% of the population, 70% of the economy and 80% of the exports not only has to split power in near-parity with the South, there are also quite large transfers of wealth because of the high government income from Flanders and the high expenditures through social security in Wallonia. Annually, it's estimated that between 6 and 13 billion € flow from North to South through various means (including differences in debt repayment/new debt) which amounts to €2000 ($2500) per person per year that we don't see back. If there's an economic crisis, those paying will be less happy to pay because they also have their own financial issues to worry about... but the intranational solidarity hasn't waned so far and is higher than it is in f.i. the US. We would like to pay less and see Wallonia more succesful and some of us regionalists believe

Thirdly, Brussels and languages. It's difficult and it's rooted in centuries of history. Brussels was found as a Dutch speaking village and the French language has encroached upon Brussels slowly making it a Francophone capital that many Dutch speakers don't really feel at home in anymore, which is a weird feeling in your own capital. In the 70s, to end linguistic issues once and for all, Belgium got an official internal linguistic border, determined by a caucus from the 60s, which made Brussels officially a bilingual city but all surrounding villages are officially Dutch speaking cities/villages. The number of French speakers in those villages surrounding Brussels get ever more French speaking though and many of them refuse to learn the Dutch ""minnow language"" ... this leads to irritation, because French keep encroaching on Dutch territory and many Flemings who've lived there feel more and more alienated as wealthy Francophone Brussels, Wallonian or French people move into their Dutch speaking town and refuse to adapt. Of course people who solely speak French will often be seen as people doing this on purpose, belittling the local population's culture in a way. We want the expansion of French into our territories to stop, also because it desintegrates the communities when a growing group of the population doesn't want to take any part of it and even try to uproot the local laws to force French as an official language after we already agreed on the linguistic border decades ago.

Lastly, I will add that Belgium will never split because one side wants to, but only when both sides can't work together for a common government anymore. Now that the Flemish nationalist party put forth a very, very moderate governing proposal, I think we can safely say Belgium won't break, but gradually devolve at most. I am not a pessimist for the country, despite that I vote for the regionalists and dislike Wallonia's politics.

bivouac is not legal, may be tolerated by police but probably not by the förster, especially in the national park. finding camping sites shouldn't be a problem. almost every village has one. [here's ](http://www.heimbacher-campingplatz.de/) one in heimbach for example which took me five seconds to find. 

you can also visit monschau which is quite beautiful (maybe then follow the rur to heimbach ). or the other way around, one of the few wanderwege i know there is the ravelweg leads to aachen. you could also get on it in belgium (it goes by st. vith) leave it at monschau walk through the national park get back on it and follow it to aachen. 

fun fact: it's on the trail of the former vennbahn so while walking on it you're always on belgian soil

here's a map of it. there a quite a few routes like that, but this is the only one i know about.

i don't really a good route to walk to  maastricht since i usually go there by car trying to be fast and sneaky but be warned that from these routes it's a pretty boring way. just a lot of fields, flat land...well...netherlands...

just googled around a bit and it seems like the route is covered by a pilgrim way starting in gulpen which is right behind the border.

 hope that helped a bit. sorry for the messy style but football got me distracted.

une exigence collective et sur l’effort individuel, est le meilleur levier pour assurer l’égalité

seul l’examen national permet l’égalité.
- mise en place des mécanismes de péréquation nécessaires à une vraie égalité entre
les élèves sur le territoire national
- Instauration de cours de français obligatoires pour les parents qui ne maîtrisent pas notre langue

The fellow from Luxembourg was framing this as an issue of social cohesion, not so much a danger to the state.  He did not express that he thought Belgium would dissolve, or anything else like that.  He just thought it was two separate societies that live in the same country, and they do not particularly like each other, nor is there much interaction between the two.  

&gt; Never did we see an IRA, ETA or any other sectarian movements and I am proud of Belgium, both the Dutch as the French side, that we've always resolved our issues peacefully.

Absolutely.  Mr. Luxembourg and I have known many Catalans (I dated one for a long time), and he knew many Basques; these groups have much stronger leaning towards secession, and the ETA of course.  He did not characterize Belgium in this way at all.

&gt;but the intranational solidarity hasn't waned so far and is higher than it is in f.i. the US. 

I'm not sure what this means?  Is f.i. a typo?  I'm not sure what you mean by saying solidarity is higher than in the US.  First off, how would you even  measure that?  Secondly, we all speak the same language, and because there are so many states, we don't think about transfers, and have no clue who gets what money.  I don't know, maybe I'm missing something here.

* These languages are never really neutral, invariably on close inspection you'll find that the phonemes used, the underlying sentence structure etc matches up with the native language of the inventor. 

* Languages without cultural context are a pain in the arse to teach in the classroom. If I decide to learn Swedish I can converse with native Swedish speakers, I can pick up a Swedish newspaper, I can attempt a Swedish recipe. The most effective way to learn a language is to practice its use and for that to be facilitated on a large scale you need a large pool of existing speakers and materials. Sure a dedicated individual can teach themselves Esperanto, but it's not practical to make it part of a school curriculum.   

* They aren't competitive. People gravitate to the languages that are either useful or emotionally significant. An English speaking Irish person might learn Gaelic because that reflects their culture and German because they wish to work in Germany. A Spanish person might learn Catalan because their wife speaks Catalan and English because they want to read Jane Austen. If you expect someone to put in the effort of learning a new language telling them it's 'neutral' simply isn't going to cut it.

We just don't need regional languages, a EU language and a global language. It's just an extra level of complexity, language gets simpler not more complicated.

As I already said: Matter of opinion. You think a pan-European language adds nothing but complexity, some agree with you and other disagree with you. 

Some people like the idea of Europe having it's own language apart from for example the US, because it would make Europe more unique and independent. Other like the idea because they don't want the lingua france of Europe to benefit the UK more than other member states (Since it's your native tongue). Some think that is bullshit. You're more a guy of the latter, I'm more someone of the former.

So there's little point in debating that, because neither of us can say that we're absolutely right. No answer is essentially better over the other.

true,shoryukenist,UNSA,NYC,"&gt; spite similar economic circumstances (total collapse of the dominant industry). I also don't think a single American state pays $2500 per person per annum more to the federal system than it receives (it would amount to a net loss of ~85 billion $ for California to give an idea of the scale)

Actually, each resident of Delaware pays $13,000 to the federal government, and each resident of Mississippi gets $500 from the federal government, for a disparity of $12,500. [Found here.](http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2013/december/taxes-transfers-redistribution-us-federal-government-states/)  Interestingly enough, there is a blurb about the EU.

I actually had no idea what the transfers are, because it literally is not something we think about.  Taxes (supposedly) go to where it is needed in the country, a lot of it is waste of course.  But I'd never sit around and say ""Those damned Southerners takin muh money.""  It just is not on the radar.  I find it funny all the Southern conservative states say ""cut the federal budget!"" when they are by far, the biggest recipients of it, and the ""progressive"" states send them all the money.  So honestly, I'd say we have pretty damn good financial solidarity.    

Your example of Detroit is really a separation of powers issue.  You are talking about a city government, not a state government.  And I can assure you the people of Detroit get a LOT of federal money.  However, the way things work is that people want as much control at the local level as possible, so the federal government does not get involved in city budgets.  For 1 million reasons, the city of Detroit ran itself into the ground over 50 years.  Firstly, the people of Detroit should have done something, but as they didn't the state of Michigan should have stepped in.  In the '70s, NYC was on the verge of bankruptcy, and the NY state came in and took over and restructured all the debt.  It took awhile, but by the 90s, NYC was back to greatness.

Michigan did nothing for Detroit until 2013!!  And then they still went bankrupt, and now it is all being worked out in federal bankruptcy court, and a federal judge is in charge.

So I'd say we have very good financial solidarity, and the best part about it is that it is literally a non-issue.  It is in the fabric of the governance of the nation.  

I know this is a big issue in Spain, and in Italy as well, with the North hating to send money to the South.  I know West Germany sends tons of money to the East, but that is a very different situation, and I don't see Germans complaining.

I do think social cohesiveness plays a part in this because my NYC dollars go to people who speak my language and share my culture (even though they have funny accents and are fat/religious).

For the health insurance, if its the same than for French students, you pay 200€ at the beginning of the year if you have 20 or + this year.
I don't think it is required to sign up to any insurance - i mean i was without any during 6 month last year, nobody told me anything. But, if something happens to you...

There are 2 differents things : 
You have the ""public"" health insurance institution which can be LMDE or SMEREP for students. This is what we call Sécurité Sociale. When you are registered at one of those organism, you have a unique ID and a card. When you go to doctor, buy some drugs, or go to hospital some of the cost is paid back by this organism, but not the whole cost.

Then you can have private insurances, we call them mutuelles, that you pay, and it will cover the missing part depending of the contract, how much you pay etc. Generally the difference is on dentist work because this is expensive.

They also have generic brands which are supposedly of better quality yet still pretty cheap like *Rewe*, *Edeka*, *Starmarke*.

That said Lidl or Netto Marken-Discount offer quite a good range of brand products nowadays and they are usually about 10 cents cheaper than at supermarkets. Even Aldi seems to include more brand products like Coca-Cola these days. Now if you have a good self-control and don't buy stuff impulsively because they are nicely stored at supermarkets, you can buy lots of food for a reasonable price at supermarkets too. 

The problem is fruits and produce: Unless they are on sale they are usually way more expensive at supermarkets, sometimes thrice as expensive as in discounters. The latter often don't have stocked enough of their cheap vegetables so you are left with stuff that doesn't look too good anymore.

Just because you have a Universal Healthcare System doesn't give you this right.

Plus smokers tend to live shorter lives than non-smokers, which saves on pension payments and healthcare costs of age-related diseases.

[And all of this isn't even counting the estimated **€10-17 billion in tax revenue lost every year** as a result of tobacco smuggling.](http://www.dw.de/billions-lost-to-cigarette-smuggling/a-16860124)

It basically covers itself. And you're a fool if you don't think tobacco smuggling is going to shoot through the roof, that organized crime isn't going to get a fuckload of more money and the government isn't going to have a smaller revenue base to tax.

Yes, Quantitative easing, which is not really a new thing, has been used.  The policies is *still* set by an inflation target, but instead of only using interest rates to *indirectly* regulate the amount on money available, this is done somewhat more directly though having quotas for buying financial instruments. This done because you can't lower interest rates more.

Also these policies has been the exact same from BoE and ECB. (they even coordinate before doing stuff like this.)

Racisme? Oui. Après, si il n'a pas pu obtenir de titre de travail, c'est moins à cause d'une discrimination d'Etat envers les Roms que parce que l'Etat verrouille autant que faire se peut les titres de séjour et de travail pour les ressortissants hors-UE, ceci afin de forcer les entreprises à embaucher des Français. (Un jour, je vous raconterai ma bataille pour obtenir un visa de travail pour une de mes employées, thaïlandaise...). Cela devrait changer puisque non seulement la disposition précédente à disparu, mais la Roumanie et la Bulgarie vont devenir membres pleins de l'espace Schengen.

&gt;It also values the UN as the dominant and preferred medium of aid and international volunteerism when many countries like the United States prefer engaging on a bilateral basis outside supranational entities like the UN.

&gt;Then look at this part. 
&gt;Q: Surely some of the behaviours you include have more impact than others. How do you allow for this?

&gt;A: At the moment we don’t, because it’s largely a matter of opinion whether, for example, emitting CO2 does more harm to humanity than invading another country. For this reason, all the data is weighted equally when calculating the final results.

&gt; It seems to value Egypt as the best country contributing to international peace and security because it doesn't get involved in international conflicts and doesn't export arms. Egypt hasn't gotten involved in Israeli affairs because the US pays them hundreds of millions of dollars a year and Egypt doesn't export arms because they don't have a domestic arms industry to export arms from because they're so reliant on US/Russian/Chinese/European weapons. Should Egypt's score be given to the USA and other people who force it to be peaceful? This whole study is bad statistics and bad reasoning.

&gt;it claims to analyze the effects of countries by international measures and says its correcting a bias in the world that looks at countries in an inward manner. It's falling victim to that same bias by (a) weighting all measures equally and (b) valuing each measure independent of the others (example arms exports is not connected to reliance on foreign arms of other countries).

&gt;This means that 1. the aggregate/cumulative/synthesis ranking is meaningless as it weights everything equally and 2. the individual rankings for each measure are meaningless as it fails to account for other factors.

true,IntelligentNickname,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; If Sweden doesn't want Siesta it doesn't have to have it. If Italy wants Siesta, it can have it. Why are you assuming all laws need to be the same?

The problems which will arise is how to make laws for it. If you say ""Sweden can do this and Italy can do that"" then you're already segrigating the two regions, which makes them own countries with their own laws.

&gt; There's free movement between Sweden and Italy, Italians can work in Sweden, Swedish can work in Italy. There are no problems with the siesta now, there won't be problems with it in the future.

You misunderstand. Of course Swedes can work in Italy and the other way around, but how do Swedes do in Sweden if a law is implimented which says siesta can be done? Swedes have no use for siesta, but they have the opportunity to do nothing for 1.5h during the day, a thing which will collapse the society if its done. If a law says siesta is forbidden, how are you supposed to get Italians to work? Siesta is there for a reason, it's too hot to work and people need to relax and wait for a better time to work. The climate of the two regions are terribly different, which makes sense to have seperate laws. If they have seperate laws, then (again) its easier for them two to be their own countries. This is just one problem out of thousands that has to be solved (morgage rates, inflation etc are devastating to implement wrongfully).

Besides, how are Italins going to feel when a lady in Germany says they can't celebrate one of their holidays for instance?

All countries agreed, but France used it's veto, because French was the language of the League of Nations.

From wiki:

&gt; After the Great War, there was a proposal for the League of Nations to accept Esperanto as their working language, following a report by Nitobe Inazō, an official delegate of League of Nations during the 13th World Congress of Esperanto in Prague. Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against, the French delegate, Gabriel Hanotaux. Hanotaux did not like how the French language was losing its position as the international language and saw Esperanto as a threat, effectively wielding his veto power to block the decision.

After the League of Nations was dissolved, many of it's former bodies. The LoN adopting Esperanto could've very well lead to it being the language of the UN.

&gt; I also think learning another language is a significant culture changer whereas EU bureaucracy does little for my day to day interactions, other than helping me get phone chargers and fruit homogenised.

Pour la 100ème fois. On ne parle pas de ""solution"" unique. On parle de mesures qui ont des effets positifs ou négatifs.

&gt;c'est de limiter le nombre d'immigrés ?

Augmenter le nombre d'immigrés pauvres et non qualifiés fait monter la délinquance et la pauvreté. Donc on arrête de faire venir de nouveaux immigrés pauvres et non qualifiés. C'est aussi simple que ça.

&gt;Quitte à inverser notre courbe démographique et subir un papyboom avec des retraites qu'on a déjà du mal a payer ?

Pour payer les retraites, il faut qu'ils travaillent... Or 90% des immigrés  hors UE ne viennent pas pour travailler. [Ils ont un taux de chômage de 20%](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&amp;ref_id=NATnon03346) et [un taux d'emploi de 50%](http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=0&amp;ref_id=NATnon03175).

Comment tu veux que ça fonctionne ? Il faut qu'un immigré paie pour lui, sa femme, ses enfants, les retraités, son logement, les infrastructures qui ont dû être crées pour lui (éducation, santé, transport, énergie etc.) alors même qu'il est pauvre et fragile quant à son emploi.

En plus, on a déjà montré qu'ils ont un coût fiscal de 5 milliards d'euros par an. Ils ne paient pas les retraites, bien au contraire ils aggravent la situation. Enfin, qui paiera les retraites des immigrés ?

&gt;Ou est-ce qu'il faut mieux faciliter l'intégration de ces populations

Il faudrait du travail. Or on a 5 millions de chômeurs et 8 millions de pauvres qui sont prioritaires.

&gt;en payant un peu plus à leur arrivée

Avec quel argent ?

Valls nous fait un plan de rigueur à 50 milliards qui va détruire 250 000 emplois bruts et 60 000 nets, comment tu trouves l'argent ?

&gt;pour avoir un retour sur investissement plus grand ?

Et si on commençait pas s'intéresser au retour sur investissement des Français ? 

Nos jeunes éduqués quittent le pays. 

On a chaque année 150 000 jeunes qui sortent du système scolaire sans aucune qualification. 

Il est illusoire de penser qu'on peut améliorer la situation pour les immigrés si on n'est même pas capables de le faire pour ceux qui sont nés en France.

No, in a federation there can be different laws between regions. Italy and Sweden having different policies about Siesta is no problem in a Federation.

&gt; You misunderstand. Of course Swedes can work in Italy and the other way around, but how do Swedes do in Sweden if a law is implimented which says siesta can be done? Swedes have no use for siesta, but they have the opportunity to do nothing for 1.5h during the day, a thing which will collapse the society if its done. If a law says siesta is forbidden, how are you supposed to get Italians to work?

No, you misunderstand:

&gt; but how do Swedes do in Sweden if a law is implimented which says siesta can be done?

There's no law going to be about that. Your employer decides whether you can take a break. In Southern-Europa it's only common because of the heath. If your employer decides that you can't take Siesta, then you don't take Siesta. In Southern-Europe employers are more likely to allow it, in Northern-Europe they are less likely to allow it. 

I have literally no idea where you see a problem. Sweden and Italy together in a federation will not result in Swedish people massively having Siestas, and as a result crash the economy.

&gt; If they have seperate laws, then (again) its easier for them two to be their own countries.

They have their separate laws: They are in a federation.

&gt; Besides, how are Italins going to feel when a lady in Germany says they can't celebrate one of their holidays for instance? How are businesses going to react when Europe impliments the Swedish parental leave system?

Du machst dich nicht ausschließlich selbst zum Patrioten - unter gewissen Umständen wirst du auch zum Patrioten gemacht, auch gegen deinen Willen.



Ich bin mir aber bewusst, dass soziale, ehrenamtliche Tätigkeiten einen Einfluss auf Kieze, Städte, möglicherweise ganze Regionen haben können. Und obwohl diese sozial engagierten Menschen wahrscheinlich nicht täglich ihrer Arbeit nachgehen in dem Bewusstsein das Vaterland heute wieder ein Stück besser zu machen, sondern sich vornehmlich um ihre Nächsten kümmern wollen, also um die Kids im Fußballklub, um die alleinerziehenden Angestellten im Unternehmen, um die psychisch Kranken in der Gesprächsgruppe, so tragen sie doch etwas zur Verbesserung der Lebensqualität im Land bei - wie klein auch immer der Beitrag sein mag oder wie spät sich die Früchte dieser Arbeit erst ernten lassen.

Also deren Verhalten muss nicht zwangsläufig von Vaterlandsliebe gesteuert sein.

Jetzt gibt es aber mindestens noch einen zweiten Akteur in diesem ""Ehre geben, Ehre nehmen""-Spiel - und das ist das Vaterland. 

Das Vaterland blickt von aussen auf die engagierte soziale Arbeit und stellt fest, dass die Jugendarbeit in einem Ort die Kriminalität gesenkt hat und fast alle Kids einen Schulabschluss und einen Ausbildungsplatz haben seit es diesen Jugendklub gibt.

Und Kriminalität, Bildung und Arbeitslosigkeit sind Themen von nationalem Interesse. Und deshalb kann es passieren, dass das Vaterland den Eindruck gewinnt, hier hat sich jemand um das Land verdient gemacht und den ehren wir jetzt.

Das soll heißen, was für den einen Akteur reine Nächstenliebe war, ist für den anderen Akteur eine Wohltat fürs Land, etwas, das das Vaterland nach vorne gebracht hat, und deshalb ein patriotischer Akt, der als solcher ausgezeichnet werden sollte und Anderen ein Vorbild sein soll.

Für die, die auszeichnen, nämlich das Vaterland, ist der Ausgezeichnete immer ein Patriot, der im Sinne des Landes gehandelt hat, sonst würde er keine nationale Auszeichnung bekommen - zumindest nicht das Verdienstkreuz.

Nicht jeder, der ausgezeichnet wurde, hat sich tatsächlich um das Vaterland verdient gemacht - da hat /u/coolsubmission schon gute Beispiele geliefert. Jedes Jahr sind 30 Verdienstkreuze für Mitglieder des Bundestages reserviert.

Aber auch ohne offizielle Anerkennung kann man sich um das Wohlergehen des eigenen Landes und der darin lebenden Menschen verdient machen, indem man seine eigenen sozialen, politischen, wirtschaftlichen Vorstellungen einbringt und versucht zu verbreiten und umzusetzen.

Ob der Antrieb dafür die Liebe fürs Vaterland oder die Liebe zu den Nächsten ist, ist eine persönliche Entscheidung. 

Liebe zu messen ist nicht trivial. Gemessen werden die Leute deshalb immer noch an ihren Taten, nicht an ihren Worten. Deshalb ist das Singen der Nationalhymne für mich kein patriotischer Akt, eine erfolgreiche Protestaktion gegen die allumfassende Überwachung durch Geheimdienste schon eher.

Dass du Liebe zum Vaterland ganz anders bewertest als ich, liegt vollständig im Bereich des Erwarteten.

So what are federations for? Just same fiscal policies? Perhaps an army or two?

&gt; I have literally no idea where you see a problem. Sweden and Italy together in a federation will not result in Swedish people massively having Siestas, and as a result crash the economy.

Policy differences. Swedes aren't going to tolerate businesses having power over the workers in such a way that they can decide about siestas. Sweden has very strict laws regarding employment and stuff. A lot of unions regulating what is good and what is bad.

The crash comes when people have rights to take siestas. Obvious not all are going to, but a lot of people are going to slowly take their rights to have a siesta and then it'll be trouble, both for companies and the people.

&gt; Let me ask you this: Is this a giant problem now?

Well we aren't in a federation yet.

true,TheByzantineDragon,FRIE,Fryslân (Living in Overijssel),"&gt; So what are federations for? Just same fiscal policies? Perhaps an army or two?

A federation's purpose is to advance the cooperation between regions. In the constitution it is decided how. The Federation will most likely: Adopt a single foreign policy, a single fiscal policy, a single military, a single social policy and a single justice policy.

This whole siesta thing is a social question, so let's look at social policy. The Federal government sets basic worker rights, a possible minimum wage etcetera. The local governments than build upon it. For example: The Federal government says that every employee has the right on breaks. The local government in for example Catalonia would then decide that workers have a 1,5 hour break in the middle of the day and call it Siesta, whilst the local government in Sweden would give the workers smaller but multiple breaks at different times during their shift. A ten minute coffee-break for example whilst a colleague of your's takes over as example.

The Federal government makes basic laws so the countries are more compatible with each other and act more like a unit, but gives enough power to the regions so they can add their own ideas to those basic laws. Take a look at German politics or those of the US, Germany and the US are federations.

&gt; Policy differences. Swedes aren't going to tolerate businesses having power over the workers in such a way that they can decide about siestas. Sweden has very strict laws regarding employment and stuff. A lot of unions regulating what is good and what is bad.

Al right, then those unions will decide whether siesta is possible or not.

&gt; The crash comes when people have rights to take siestas. Obvious not all are going to, but a lot of people are going to slowly take their rights to have a siesta and then it'll be trouble, both for companies and the peope.

&gt; Well we aren't in a federation yet.
If Swedes want the EU to be run in one way, why not just let them have their own country run as they wish? Because in the end the country/region with highest population density is going to decide what are good laws and what are bad laws.

This is so stupid. I can't help but facepalm.

&gt; The crash comes when people have rights to take siestas.

Where does this come from? How does a federation suddenly cause an increase in Swedish people wanting Siesta? If the EU federalises, the amount of people in Sweden wanting to have Siesta will NOT change. It will remain exactly the same as it is now.

&gt; Well we aren't in a federation yet. If Swedes want the EU to be run in one way, why not just let them have their own country run as they wish? Because in the end the country/region with highest population density is going to decide what are good laws and what are bad laws.

These people in my opinion are intelligent and idiotic. They are making the same mistake Poland did before '39. Getting big countries to protect them and then antagonising their neighbouring country.

&gt;Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia have the same standard of living as Poland and they do not require visas. Same with Baltic States which are no different from Poland save for US visa policy either. Even citizens of Chile can travel to US visa-free. There is clearly a lot of bad will in this issue on USA side.

Well I don't know why Poland is the exception. It might have to do with the eastern regions. People from those areas were still arriving in the UK during the recession. ",0,1403646929,null,0,false,0,cig5cgj,t3_28zaz0,t1_cig5cgj,t1_cig3dpd,null,1434387648,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

If you say so. It's not exactly a company or industry known for being truthful.

But if we're cherrypicking statements to suit our viewpoint:

http://www.vodafone.co.uk/campaigns/price-changes/price-change-7/?cid=rdr-14067-07 - ""rising business costs"", look how cheap EU roaming is now, but don't worry, you'll be paying more for out-of-bundle UK usage! I wonder why they decided to have a price rise at the same time as a decrease in EU roaming charges comes in? EU outgoing call rate down 5.8p, UK outgoing call rate up 5p. EU text message rate down 2.2p, UK message rate up 3p. I guess that's not linked at all, right?

&gt; None of this supports your thesis, that these prices rose because of the change in roaming fees. If anything you're doing the opposite. You're describing them as always being on the look for schemes to screw the consumer and increase their profits. 

Um... increasing domestic prices to offset loss of roaming revenue is pretty much ""always being on the look for schemes to screw the consumer and increase their profits."" - so I'm not sure how I'm arguing the opposite. Just like every other stunt the industry has pulled to counteract regulatory pressure.

true,IntelligentNickname,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; This whole siesta thing is a social question, so let's look at social policy. The Federal government sets basic worker rights, a possible minimum wage etcetera. The local governments than build upon it. For example: The Federal government says that every employee has the right on breaks. The local government in for example Catalonia would then decide that workers have a 1,5 hour break in the middle of the day and call it Siesta, whilst the local government in Sweden would give the workers smaller but multiple breaks at different times during their shift. A ten minute coffee-break for example whilst a colleague of your's takes over as example.
The Federal government makes basic laws so the countries are more compatible with each other and act more like a unit, but gives enough power to the regions so they can add their own ideas to those basic laws. Take a look at German politics or those of the US, Germany and the US are federations.

My point is that we're far too different to agree with a common system. Swedes won't ever give up their laws regarding social issues because they consider them to be superior (hence välfärd etc). Swedes discuss every single matter there is, regarding of how trivial or big. Swedes love meetings which Italians hate. Swedes take turns when they speak to eachother so everyone can give their input, which Italians never do.

It's too early to make a federation when we can just cooperate financially and military. In the future when we have integraded more and more we could try, but it's going to take time. For Sweden it's best to join up with Norway, Denmark and Finland, because we have about the same views on things, but it's still difficult to make a union - even considering the similarities. A European federation? Not going to happen.

Also, if we're a federation, does that mean the king will be abolished? That's a thing Swedes would hate.

&gt; Al right, then those unions will decide whether siesta is possible or not.

Yeah right. Unions love to abuse their power as much as possible. 

&gt; Where does this come from? How does a federation suddenly cause an increase in Swedish people wanting Siesta? If the EU federalises, the amount of people in Sweden wanting to have Siesta will NOT change. It will remain exactly the same as it is now.

We have different systems which all countries deem superior. Changing them would require a compromise, which is difficult to make and will probably make it worse for the citizens.

&gt; You're not answering the question. Is the Siesta a big problem in Sweden right now?

No, but if it's a right to have siestas it would be a big problem.

&gt; This is so stupid. I can't help but facepalm.

You're already doing that, you're in the EU. Also a federation will change the Swedish system barely, because as I said: The federation will only make very basic policy, where upon the members can add. You're social laws will be the same.

&gt; Swedes discuss every single matter there is, regarding of how trivial or big. Swedes love meetings which Italians hate. Swedes take turns when they speak to each other so everyone can give their input, which Italians never do.

Again, this bares no problem. You just take two different cultural things and immediately assume they're going to cause problem. There's no reason to think this will cause problems, and you've provided none.

&gt; It's too early to make a federation when we can just cooperate financially and military. In the future when we have integrated more and more we could try, but it's going to take time

No one here is saying we're doing it soon. The most quickest expectations of federalisation are still decades away.

&gt; We have different systems which all countries deem superior. Changing them would require a compromise, which is difficult to make and will probably make it worse for the citizens.

Who's talking about changing your system?

&gt; No, but if it's a right to have siestas it would be a big problem.

Then the solution is simple: The Siesta will not be right in Sweden. Where's the problem?

Brilliant, we're taking back our sovereignty. But looking beyond that, why would you repeal a bill of rights and replace it with another, unless you wanted to *decrease* the rights enshrined in the bill?

In a federation, the federal government provides a sort of general framework for law and order, while the specifics are left up to the lower levels of government. 

&gt; Swedes aren't going to tolerate businesses having power over the workers in such a way that they can decide about siestas. Sweden has very strict laws regarding employment and stuff. A lot of unions regulating what is good and what is bad.

Then Sweden won't have siestas. The federal government will probably set some baseline requirements for what is acceptable workplace safety, and as long as Sweden doesn't go below those standards, then there's no problem. I seriously doubt that siestas would become mandatory; they'd likely be considered a luxury perk, not a mandatory safety requirement. If Italy wants to go above and beyond and have them, that's fine, but Sweden won't be penalized for *not* having them.

&gt; The crash comes when people have rights to take siestas. Obvious not all are going to, but a lot of people are going to slowly take their rights to have a siesta and then it'll be trouble, both for companies and the people.

Ensuite, un État n'a pas à intervenir dans les décisions d'un autre État.

Sur le cas des US, ça commence à bien faire :

- après Guantanamo, on a vu la vision des USA de la torture et de la détention sans jugement et sans avocat
- après Snowden, on a vu une volonté totalitaire d’espionner le monde entier, façon 1984 ;
- après Snowden, le message était donc “N’utilisez plus de matériels ni de services informatiques américains” ;
- après l’Ukraine, on a vu la volonté de refaire la guerre froide pour des choses sans grand intérêt ;
- après l’Ukraine, le message était : “N’utilisez surtout plus les services et plateformes financières américaines type Mastercard ou Swift” ;
- après l’amende BNP (même méritée), le message était : “N’utilisez surtout plus le dollar” ;
- après l’Argentine, le message est : “N’utilisez surtout plus le droit américain pour vos émissions de dette”…

On a des instances internationales (le FMI) en cas de conflit entre États, ce n'est pas aux cours locales de décider.

Je suggère la lecture de [cet article](http://convention-s.fr/decryptages/la-dette-argentine-la-clause-pari-passu-et-la-gestion-des-d%C3%A9fauts-souverains/) et de [celui-ci](http://www.pauljorion.com/blog/?p=56795) sur la dette argentine.

Pour l'affaire BNP, les US imposent leur embargo à une banque étrangère. Encore une fois, ça ne relève pas de la justice américaine mais d'une instance internationale. Cette décision c'est du pur impérialisme, le montant de l'amende est complètement arbitraire quand on sait que [pour Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi](http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-eco/2013/06/20/97002-20130620FILWWW00640-iran-une-banque-japonaise-condamnee.php), avec un montant total de transactions de 100 milliards de dollars vers l'Iran, le Soudan et la Birmanie, l'amende a été de 250 millions de dollars. Pour [Standard Chartered](http://fr.reuters.com/article/frEuroRpt/idFRL5E8NAE1820121210) et le même type de transaction, l'amende était de 327 millions de dollars.

Et un an après, 10 milliards pour BNPP ? Je conseille [cet article](http://institutdeslibertes.org/a-propos-de-l-affaire-bnp-et-de-mes-certitudes/) spécifiquement sur l'affaire BNP.

How is this not going to cause problems? Swedes like to really limit the power of individuals and companies for the benefit of the society as a whole. Very few other countries are willing to do that. USA would laugh at the mere thought.

true,kennyt1001,ROMA,Romania,"FUCK!! I wrote a nice long comment with 'official' romanian definitions to all the three terms and my findings and sources and links, but i accidentally clicked back on the mouse when switching between tabs and my comment got rekt.

I should've saved more often (didn't save at all).

My understanding of the **nationality**, as defined by our dictionary (DEX), is that it's a group of people with a common language and culture, that was formed a given historical region. 

And according to DEX **ethnicity** is a group of people with a common language and traditions formed in time and space. The difference between the two is the historical region part. 

As I understand it, a person born in Hungary is a Hungarian National but can also be ethnically romanian, if romanian is his 'motherly tongue' and practices romanian traditions. 

And **citizenship** is a completely legal term, talking about a person's status (in regards to rights and whatever).

Citizenship and nationality are synonyms, with the mention that they are improperly used as such (in our great synonym dictionary).

As such, I think ethnicity is mostly used for minorities, and nationality for the majority of the people with the same language and culture.

I don't know if you're following me or not, but I learned quite a bit about a subject I had next to no knowledge about when i posted my first comment.

&gt;nationality, also called ethnicity

Nationality and ethnicity being one and the same is a german principle. Some countries follow that principle. (Volkszugehoerigkeit)

But the french say that you cannot be a french national by being born in france alone. You also have to be a resident of france (citizenship).

&gt;According to the French Republic, the French people are those who are in possession of French nationality

[Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_nationality_law#French_Citizenship_and_identity)

The way I interpret this is you can only be a french citizen if you are a french national and vice versa 


I guess that in the end, things aren't quite as simple as they seem.

The Constitutional Convention lasted four months, and in that time the delegates spent almost all of the time arguing over representation, and more importantly the scope of power afforded to the federal government. Early drafts gave the federal government almost unlimited power. 

This didn't last long. States back then had their own *money*, let alone laws, taxes, and regulations. They sure as fuck weren't just going to give all that up.

Please, for the love of fuck, if the EU ever becomes a stronger Union, a federalised Union, learn from our mistakes (ones America will have to live with for a while, since everyone here thinks the Constitution is gospel). The States as individual powers died when our second legislative house stopped getting elected by them, and personally I think its a damn shame (I'd say I'm as leftist as most Americans come, but I believe federalism is the best way to handle large government).
