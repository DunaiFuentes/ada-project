One of the differences I have noticed is that - just like this article here - the pro-immigration media tends to be very generalized and clear-cut like defining everybody an immigrant who was born into a different citizenships. However in everyday life the anti-immigration people are more interested in cultural fits and not so clearly about these broad categories. So an average anti-immigration Austrian would not consider a Czech citizen living there as an immigrant because they fit, but he would consider a second-generation Turk with an Austrian citizenship an immigrant because he is kind of still different.

At any rate the point is that these spontaneous grassroot anti-immigration sentiments are _never_ about all foreigners but usually just about cultures that don't fit so well so these articles do not help at all, because these people would say ""you don't get it, when people from country Y come here that it totally different than when from country Y"".

Article is a bit outdated and not all that accurate so let me fill some blanks for those interested. 

Whole things started on Saturday when *Wprost* weekly released bits of the recordings and informed that rest will be available on Monday. 

Those were parts of 2 conversations recorded in July 2013. First between Minister of Internal Affairs Mr. Sienkiewicz and head of National Bank Mr. Belka. Second was between two ex-minister from the governing party (PO) and deputy finance minister (who since left the government). 

Second conversation looks pretty bad and may indicate some kind of corruption or preferential treatment, but doesn't involve anyone really important. Law enforcement is looking into that, it's hard to tell for sure.

First one seemed very bad at first since it hinted things like banks intervention on secondary bond market in order to invigorate economy before upcoming elections for a price of removal of Finance Minister, but as it turned out on Monday, it was mostly due to tedious choice of fragments released on Saturday. 

The conversation turned out to be quite a long discussion about possible solutions in case of crisis getting deeper and aforementioned topics were just a small part of much longer debate and proposed ""removal of minister"" was simply an option discussed by two parties as a remedy to the fact that he was opposed to ideas those two had. On top of the fact that head of national Bank is completely independent and as far as the law goes he can demand from government whatever he wants.

Two real issues with this conversation are the style it was performed in and how it can affect ability of Mr. Belka to cooperate with other financial bodies he mercilessly mocked, and the fact that it was recorded in the first place. Those are one of the most important people in the country and one of them is responsible for all intelligence and counter-intelligence agencies... 

Apparently some suspects are already in custody but it remains to be seen what light will that put on the whole affair.


As far as stability of government goes it doesn't change a thing. PM hasn't even fired his MIA and coalition party leader stated that opposition's calls for new elections are absurd.

Unless something uglier comes out to light in following days whole debacle won't change much.

I think your assessment of that risk is wrong or your evaluation of it exaggerated, and I also think that you fail to put it into proper perspective to the costs of fossil energy sources if you come out switching off nuclear prior to them.  

This isn't subject to opinion either. Fossil fuels are more harmful, more costly as measured by ecological as well as long term economical impact and even human lives themselves, as well as more prone to accidents. Risk of nuclear disaster can be minimized, and neither Chernobyl nor Fukushima with their 60 year old designs, deliberate disregard for safety measures and their placement on geological fault lines are good examples of nuclear power not being feasible in any form.

I´m glad you acknowledge that there is no clear line to be drawn. That´s my point. But, unless you like in a true anarchy a state has to make rules or in other words draw the line. Norway is not a anarchy, so drawing the line at buying but not at selling can be considered perfectly logical and sensible. It´s kind of like you example of selling rhino horn. The selling of the horn isn´t what harmful and should be legal. Poaching isn´t and shouldn´t be. 


And just to tell you where I want to draw the line. Weed and prostitution is just fine by me, but human hunting and selling organs is not fine.

Cameron is opposing Juncker, not opposing the Office of the Commission President. This is about Juncker.

&gt; Somebody has to be elected.

There is a reason for not proposing alternatives yet. The EP has made clear it will object to everyone but Juncker. For that reason its a bad idea to propose alternatives right now. The most ideal solution is for Cameron and his allies that are also sceptical of or oppose Juncker to cause Juncker to withdraw his candidacy (through a sustained opposition). That means the EP can no longer oppose everyone except Juncker, because Juncker is no longer in the race (if he withdraws).

&gt; By limiting its reaction to a purely spoiling one, the British government is cementing its reputation as petulant obstructionists.

Hyperbole aside, this is a case of when it is best to release your preferred candidate. Cameron et al. very likely have reasons not to release a name yet, and that person also has reasons to not be named yet. That is EP opposition to everything else.

If she went off to Brussels and left their leadership vacant, the chances of a right-wing, Eurosceptic coalition winning next year's general election in Denmark, adding a significant ally for Cameron in the Council, would increase significantly.

You are correct, Germans and Germany is a rather peculiar (if you are referring to the distinct and unique definition) culture. It goes back to the origins of Germany and it's unique development and nature that stems from it's distinction from the other parts of Europe that were conquered by Romans. The vast majority of what constitutes today's Germany and the common cultural realm of Germany towards the east was never subjugated by Romans and have a clearly distinct branch of human development. 

I think the best way to understand is to get a very high level primer on the history of Europe without necessarily delving too deeply into particular eras at first even though there are some notable phases that will stand out if he focuses on the immediate developments that make up today's Germany and slightly east, especially the east Germany, now known as Poland. ;)

Something that might also be rather relevant to in a more tangential and novel manner is the strong connection to the USA and, in particular the growth of Texas. There are strong cultural ties like, e.g., did you know there was a German Colony in Texas. 

When it comes down to it, in the modern era, i.e., post WW first and second act, it's all dominated by anxiety and drift of cultural identity. 

Germans are still sub-consciously and passibly very self-loathing and that adds to their ""peculiar"" nature that is somewhat of an awkward nature because of the insecurity of their culture. In many ways it has come to a head with what we call Gen X, which has a measurable break from German culture in may ways and as a result of post WWII trauma and devastation manifesting itself. 

Anyways, my two cent. Unfortunately, I find it rather difficult, relatively speaking, to easily identify and discover German cultural ""artifacts"" to a certain extent. It feels to me like it's a difference in desire to document and preserve and share and spread. Who knows, maybe that also has to do with the binge of the 1940s that the society is still recovering from; but on the other hand German history is full of holes due to relatively sparse ""documentation"". Germans tend to live in the here and now relative to their continental peers.

In many ways that's even circumspect to your original question. There seem to be far fewer literary attempts at all encompassing narrative relative to, e.g., the USA where there is a book coming out about some historical aspect or person every other week.

true,phys1cs,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt;I'd wager most of these were originally built with plutonium production in mind

No they weren't. The Magnox reactors and Windscale piles in the UK and the similar UNGG reactors in France were capable of plutonium production. The early heavy water moderated reactors in Sweden and similar experimental/research reactors elsewhere, as well as the UNGG/Magnox type reactors in Spain and Italy could probably all have been used for weapons plutonium production, although none of them ultimately were. All of the reactors shown on the map are high burnup, oxide fueled power reactors, the majority being light water reactors. These are all seriously bad at producing the kind of plutonium that's useful for making weapons. It would be many times more difficult to operate one of these power reactors in a way that would allow weapons production than to just build a proper production reactor - as the nuclear weapons states did, or to use a research reactor.

Advanced reactors are great, but the whole 'current nuclear reactors were only built because plutonium' thing is pure BS. First generation British and French reactors were designed to be dual-purpose. They are absolutely nothing like the majority of current power reactors. Commercial LWRs were enabled by the development of enriched uranium fueled submarine propulsion reactors, but that's the only link to weapons. Thorium fuels were used in LWRs before any other reactors (including the only demonstration so far of Th/U233 breeding), but the abundance of uranium meant that there was no urgent need to switch to a more expensive system. That's why we use LWRs with LEU.

true,Rc72,EURO,European Union,"&gt;  The most ideal solution is for Cameron and his allies that are also sceptical of or oppose Juncker to cause Juncker to withdraw his candidacy (through a sustained opposition). That means the EP can no longer oppose everyone except Juncker, because Juncker is no longer in the race (if he withdraws).

So Cameron's theory goes. However, there are three possibilities.

a) Cameron succeeds and Juncker withdraws. Good luck finding a candidate acceptable to both Council and Parliament. The stalemate would last for a very, very long time, and one should not underestimate the European Parliament's own potential in terms of petulant obstructionism (not only in matters related to this election).

b) Cameron manages to get a blocking minority in the Council, but Juncker refuses to step down (it isn't as if he has anything to lose, anyway). Stalemate again.

c) Cameron fails to rally a blocking minority in the Council, which approves Juncker by QMV. Juncker is then confirmed in Parliament by something close to a 3/4 majority. Cameron ends up with plenty of egg on his face, his only meager consolation being that both Milliband and Clegg would also get a fair share of it. Farage would triumph and I wouldn't exclude a Tory leadership challenge too.

The situation is not so much lose-lose as lose-lose-disastrous rout. And so far my bet would be on the third option.

&gt; Hyperbole aside, this is a case of when it is best to release your preferred candidate.

That should have been before the European election, but since the Tories' ECR group has hardly any weight in the European Parliament, they had good reasons not to propose any candidate.

Seriously, the only serious option to stop Juncker without lasting political damage would have been to propose an immensely popular alternative candidate. But Cameron had no interest in that, since that would be just the sort of Comission president he wants to avoid. Which makes his vocal opposition to Juncker all the more puzzling. If Cameron hadn't started throwing toys from the pram, Juncker would have been elected without much ado, and everybody would have forgotten the whole Spitzenkandidaten thing in about 15 minutes. And Juncker, the ultimate pragmatist, and lacking an actual political base, would have been quite accomodating of British demands, I'm sure.

true,Cyg789,EURO,European Union,"I'm German, living in the UK. I'm also a chronic pain patient (migraine &amp; daily headaches) with hypermobility, currently pregnant with twins. I can tell you a few differences between the UK and Germany if you're interested. This is purely from my perspective:

* In Germany, a GP works for himself, in order to make money. That of course leads to a lot of abuse. UK GP's earn a fixed salary, it's in their interest to get you back on the street asap &amp; to not have you come back. 
**Example**: I was suffering from back pain - again - due to a trapped nerve. In Germany, my GP would inject me stuff and have me come back for x sessions of electrotherapy. In the UK, you get codeine for the pain, a recommendation for a massage to untrap the nerve, and one to go see your local physio walk-in centre to show me some back exercise.

* The medication you get prescribed here is usually a cheap copy, and if it's not, it's usually a re-import. Rarely do you see the expensive original - that's changing in Germany as well but as long as pharma representatives can bribe GPs... Here, drugs have to be proven to work and must deliver a certain cost benefit in order to be whitelisted. Which is why you constantly have the debates about the newest cancer drug not getting on the list: An average life extension of 2 years at the cost of 200,000 GBP is considered a waste of money and takes that money away from people who need it more. 

* In the UK, you have everything streamlined. 
**Example**: My sister-in-law had a child in Germany 2 years ago. She had to find a midwife, which was a hassle. She then had to make sure the hospital she chose could actually do emergency c-sections after trying for a natural birth. That was in a city with 2 million people and out of the x hospitals there was one! Here, when I found out I was pregnant, my surgery booked an appointment with the local midwife at my sugery. They have teams all over the city and the team that covers my surgery also does the post natal house visits. Finding out I was having twins started a whole chain of events: My local hospital where I'd had the scan took over and immediately booked me in. I am now in the care of that hospital's twin clinic which has a midwife, an obstetrician, and a sonographer that I see regularly. Everything gets written down in my little pink book and everyone knows what everyone else is doing. I have to do zilch, I get my appointments in the post. 

In Germany, there is still enough opportunity for everyone involved to generate unnecessary costs to benefit themselves. You don't have that here, and doctors don't tend to fight over competences. Also, you do not get to change your GP just because you don't like them anymore or because they won't support your abuse of the system. Yes, you can get a second opinion, but ""doctor hopping"" for your adderall won't work here.
At the moment, I can't imagine being pregnant with identical twins in Germany. Way too much of a hassle!",0,1403022386,null,0,1403023170,0,ci9wil7,t3_28csda,t1_ci9wil7,t1_ci9qyn7,null,1434279528,10,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,10

&gt; But living in the US, I've met Brits and Canadians who hate their systems, seems rather strange to me. One British woman told me ""The NHS? Good lord, no one uses that."" She was the wife of an investment banker, so I suppose there is a class element.

I don't think it's a class element. It's rather that the public healthcare system is often ineffective and has lots of queues. Many employers pay for private healthcare for their employees both as a way to attract good people and to get them to work faster if they become sick. 

There is a lot to be improved in the public healthcare system in Norway. For example have i experienced having to wait over a month for a doctors appointment.

I checked and you're right, however there are details of this case that need pointing out - 1) he was QUESTIONED in connection to a string of robberies, the fact we live in a society that is ""innocent until proven guilty"" and the fact that he was let go may be a sign that maybe, just maybe, he may have been innocent?
2) The crime he allegedly (again the note is allegedly) committed that caused the kidnap was a burglary which is something completely different.

The fact we are assuming that we are all assuming he actually committed these crimes and that the local community didn't just pin the blame on the nearest Roma person they could find is an issue in and of itself.

&gt; If you use force, you have to expect force to be used upon you.
It is somewhat beyond, but it didn't exactly hit an innocent.

You have a right to self-defence when your life is in immediate danger, you do not have the right to track down the person, kidnap them, and then attempt murder.

&gt; If they showed some good will first by stopping to become career criminals, I'm sure all that would happen.
They need to take the first step, because society's first duty is to protect its members and since they prefer to keep outside of it and endanger the members of society...

Okay, and what options do the Roma have? Who will employ them?  Who is going to include them in society? I should point out that the hostility between Europeans and Roma isn't a recent phenomenon, it has being going on since at least the 13th century. When the whole of Europe is already hostile to you and makes all efforts to try and remove you, how many options do you have to become a productive member of society?  I remember reading on Reddit some posts from Roma who note that the only way they were ever able to get by in society was to actively suppress their cultural identity and pretend they weren't Roma - since the slightest admission of them being Roma would lead to them experiencing open hostility.

true,shudders,UKGB,United Kingdom,"&gt; one should not underestimate the European Parliament's own potential in terms of petulant obstructionism

Remember this is the election characterised by Eurosceptic success. The population at large is far less pro-EU than it has been. So although the EP may well object to everything, it has a reputation it could do with not damaging. They may well proceed in objecting to everyone except the withdrawn candidate (who is at that point out of the race and therefore useless), but it may also come at a cost.

&gt; I wouldn't exclude a Tory leadership challenge too

There is zero chance of a Tory leadership challenge as a result of this. With the General Election coming in 2015 that would be utterly disastrous. Of the three major parties (of which only Labour and the Tories stand a chance of having the next PM), Cameron is comfortably the most secure and charismatic leader.

The European Council, to date, has also operated with consensus despite QMV being an option. Of course there's always a first time for everything, though it would establish a very different mood within the Council. Its tough to predict what that would be.

&gt; propose an immensely popular alternative candidate.

There isn't one, otherwise it would have been done already. And if the EP are objecting to everyone else, what's the point.

&gt; And Juncker, the ultimate pragmatist, and lacking an actual political base, would have been quite accomodating of British demands, I'm sure.

On the contrary. With Juncker facing plenty of opposition, what mandate he had is reduced even more. He has more of a reason to compromise as a result of what has happened than if nobody had objected to him.

&gt; Instead, Cameron has turned Juncker into a symbol, and got into a fight for which he is utterly unprepared.

true,ScanianMoose,native-edit,native (Unterfranken),"Food is not really expensive, I would say, also due to the low tax rate of 7%.
Some ways to save money:

*    Travel by bus. The monopoly by the Deutsche Bahn (DB) has now been dissolved, creating competition between private bus companies and resulting in very cheap intercity bus lines.

*    An alternative to buses is travelling with someone else who goes the same direction. Less reliable, but also even less expensive. Look for rides some weeks ahead of your journey at mitfahrgelegenheit.de

*    Since you are probably an exchange student: Many universities offer trips to their exchange students which are cheaper than usual.

*    Buy groceries from supermarkets. Most of them even bake their own bread. Might be cheaper than at the baker's. 

*    The Netto supermarkets might be a bit more expensive since they sell a lot of branded products. 

*    Many supermarkets sell a combination of branded and no-name products. Gut&amp;Günstig is a ""brand"" that is very cheap. They have it at Edeka, for instance. 

*    Go dumpster diving, if you're into that.

*    Don't buy Bio food. Although it certainly is healthier than normal food, it is also more expensive. Germans are obsessed with organic food, just as the Brits are with fair-trade stuff. 

*    If you are too lazy to cook, eat at your university's canteen. The prices are very low for students and you usually get a good meal there.

*    Drink water from the tap. The water quality in Germany is genuine, and especially so in Bavaria.

*    Look out for Facebook groups where you can buy second-hand stuff, such as furniture or clothes. Some people want money, some want to exchange it for e.g. a beer crate, some might offer their stuff for free. Ask a local student. They might know the name of your local group. Fair-Teiler is a group name that is quite common. See for yourself if they have a local ""branch"". 

*    Get cheap clothes at H&amp;M or C&amp;A or at a thrift shop.

*    Buy furniture at IKEA or second-hand shops.

*    Get yourself a ""Semesterticket"". Most universities offer it. It is valid for one university term and usually gives you free rides on public transports within the town you're studying in. Some Semestertickets even allow you to use the train for free in the Bundesland you're in. Or free rides to the next major city and its surroundings. Or discounts on tickets within your Bundesland.

*    A student card will give you discounts at swimming pools, cinemas, etc.

*    Join local student associations for free time activities. Many universities offer free language courses and sports. By ""student associations"", I do NOT mean ""Studentenverbindungen"" (=fraternities). Fraternities in Germany are often traditionalist, require fencing practice (and sometimes even fights) and many of them mingle with far-right groups. You do not want to be associated them.

*    Instead of going to the Oktoberfest in Munich, enjoy a local ""Kirmes/Kirchweih"" where one ""Maß"" (= 1l of beer) doesn't cost 10€. Almost no tourists, more locals, more intimacy.

*    Streaming movies and TV series on the internet is not illegal, i.e. you will not be persecuted or sued for that stuff. As long as you don't download torrents or offer copyrighted content to others, you should be fine.

*    Get familiar with the local bar/nightlife cycle. In the town where I am from, each nightclub had its own day of the week with good deals on drinks. Some nightclubs also offer free entry before e.g. 10 p.m. However, you will also have to put up with 16-to-18-year-olds who are allowed to stay in till midnight.",0,1403023266,null,0,1403032271,0,ci9wyba,t3_28by4p,t1_ci9wyba,t3_28by4p,null,1434279738,4,false,German,t5_2qq51,4

I think I have some of the best care possible, being in the NYC area, with so many highly ranked teaching hospitals around.

Then we have my wife, works in private industry, makes over twice as much as me, and is on the fast track to upper management.  However, he employer offers SHIT insurance, which less doctors accept and higher out of pocket expenses and shitty drug coverage.

I actually turned down a private industry job making more because of the benefits I have, and of course the pension.  My wife is on my plan, we look at it like a private-public partnership.  

This is why people get so mad at government employees here, we get the best health care coverage in the country, and still get pensions.  To private industry folks, they hate that because they are working longer hours, and feel they deserve the best.  And then you have working class folks who work hard, but get no coverage.  If you are impoverished/on disability or are over 65, you get coverage from the government.

Obviously, the worst part of our system is self-employed and working class people who have no coverage.  Obamacare is improving it, but many Southern states (which have by far the most unhealthy people) opted out of a lot of important provisions.

Because that's what the party was founded on, because it is what still most commonly brings people to the streets, because they bring it up at every instance, even going so far as to say that Fukushima is somehow the second Chernobyl of worse than Chernobyl, even though it didn't release anywhere near the same amount of radioactive material.  
Also because I happen to hate their guts for it. It's the single biggest thing turning me away from them, even though I recognize that we need a stronger green movement, not a weaker one. They're the the leader behind shutting down nuclear, their campaign has always been run on emotion/fear, and Chernobyl is the scariest thing they can bring up.

true,Rc72,EURO,European Union,"&gt; Remember this is the election characterised by Eurosceptic success. The population at large is far less pro-EU than it has been. So although the EP may well object to everything, it has a reputation it could do with not damaging.

I think that you are indeed misjudging how the Parliament works. It isn't a monolithic entity, but the sum of 700+ MEPs divided across many national and political lines. And don't overstate the ""Eurosceptic success"" either: while such parties have been relatively successful in some countries (UK, France and Denmark in particular), they also spectacularly failed in others (most notably Holland) and the Eurosceptics and -phobes, even adding the Tories' ECR to the groups around UKIP and the Front National, remain quite minoritary in the EP.

Also, the EP's reputation wouldn't be necessarily damaged. Arguably, it would be far more badly dented by allowing a mockery to be made of the whole Spitzenkandidaten process. You Brits may have just been made aware of it, but voters in other countries, in particular in Germany, did follow the campaign debates. Considering the abstentionism at European elections, the MEPs will prefer to be seen as obstructionistic (especially towards a lacklustre candidate) than as pointless. Certainly Farage hasn't suffered from being seen as an utter pain in the behind.

&gt; There is zero chance of a Tory leadership challenge as a result of this. With the General Election coming in 2015 that would be utterly disastrous.

What if UKIP picks up in the polls even more following the humiliation of Juncker being elected? I can see Tory MPs becoming antsy. Cameron may be more ""secure and charismatic"" than Milliband and Clegg (although that's damning with faint praise indeed), but that won't help Tory MPs in marginal constituencies facing a vote drain towards UKIP. This could be just the situation BoJo (or, don't laugh, Gove) is waiting for.

As I said, unless Cameron comes up with an absolutely brilliant alternative candidate (which, as you point out, is unlikely), the EP won't be blamed for rejecting him or her. The scorn that is being poured now on Juncker in the British media will pale compared to what would be thrown elsewhere at a colourless bureaucrat emerging from a secretive conclave of heads of government. And Cameron has no interest whatsoever in a popular head of the Commission.

&gt; With Juncker facing plenty of opposition, what mandate he had is reduced even more.

Except that Juncker **is not facing plenty of opposition**. Get outside your British bubble: elsewhere, Cameron's opposition has actually consolidated many people behind Juncker who otherwise wouldn't touch him with a bargepole. I'm not speaking about the EP, but the public at large: I've read enough comments in German, Spanish, Belgian or French media affirming ""well, I didn't like Juncker at all, but if that banksters' puppet Cameron is so set against him, he can't be a bad sort"". If Juncker gets past the Council hurdle (and Cameron has also alienated enough fellow European heads of government in the past to make that a distinct possibility), he will be plebiscited in the EP, and Cameron will have created just the last thing he needs: a popular Commission president, with the support of the EP and a personal grudge against him.

I think Serbia has made amazing progress in a decade.  I see you as a brother (or sister, depending) and I don't think that anyone should be held accountable for anything they didn't do.  I cannot pretend to know what the general sentiment in Serbia regarding the wars/crimes is though.

I do like it however when people can come to terms with history, at least to understand objectively whether a person/group's actions in the past were ""good"" or ""bad"" without having to feel personally denigrated by admitting the past ""bad"" actions of a compatriot.  Several Belgians in the past have done fairly evil things, and I've gone out of my way to understand how their crimes came about and how circumstances can be avoided again.

Once you're there, you can either get back on the south branch of RER B (go all the way down to level -2) or take metro line 4 to get to Montparnasse.

Unless your plane gets there several hours before your train leaves, you might not make it to Montparnasse before the scheduled hour. That's fine, though - just get to Montparnasse and board the first train to Rennes. Your ticket will be valid (and it's unlikely that it will be inspected anyway, given the circumstances).

Word of warning: it's likely to be a *deeply* unpleasant experience. Public transit is never nice, but public transit in Paris during a strike with (I'm assuming) heavy luggage will be a nightmare, especially if you're unlucky enough to ride during rush hour (7-9am). Don't hesitate to let a RER train go by if it's too crowded, there will be one every 10-20 minutes or so. Once you get to the Montparnasse station, unless you manage to get on your original train it's very unlikely that you'll be able to sit - the trains will be crammed with people. You're also likely to have to wait a long, long time, so bring a book or three, some music, and pack sandwiches and water.

There's also the European Convention on Human Rights. We can't opt out of it without also leaving the European Union. It's extremely unlikely we'd be given an opt out on this even if the most sympathetic EU Commissioner was in charge, let alone Juncker. A lot of Britons dislike it because it stops us from being able to deport potential terrorists like Abu Qatada (spelling?) because he might be tortured without trial. It's considered totally abhorrent that humans should have rights that cannot be taken away from them, simply by virtue of being human. We'd probably also like a more binding verdict on prisoners getting votes. ATM the European Convention on Human Rights prescribes that everybody of able mind be able to vote, but the UK just ignored that bit of the Convention and doesn't give prisoners the vote anyway (It's not like minority rights should have suffrage, in order to ensure that a good deal between the prosecuted and the rest of society is reached). So far we've not been persecuted by the European Court of Human Rights or the European Court of Justice, but we'd probably like a more formal opt out, just in case.

Sadly anti-immigration is one of the bigger reasons currently. This has been building up for years (decade +), because of the overly PC nature of the UK. Absolutely any questioning of immigration had you branded as a racist, it's only really became acceptable to talk about it in the last couple of years. There has been rapid social changes in the UK along with pressure on public services and housing, and EU migration is currently taking most of the backlash for it - despite the fact that most EU migrants integrate well. Those who haven't integrated tend to be from well outside of the EU.

I don't sit in that crowd. I'm ok with free movement within the EU as long as people integrate &amp; contribute, which most EU citizens do. My beef with the EU is were it's heading.

&gt;According to the assessment of the Reparations Commission of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia from 1945, the full amount of war damages, which Yugoslavia suffered during World War II, totaled USD 46.9 billion from 1938, calculated upon the value at the outbreak of war (exchange rate: USD 1 = 44 dinars). From this sum, the German part is USD 35,858 billion. Through the International Reparation Agency, Yugoslavia was compensated the total sum of USD 35,786,118, which represents the value of the old dismantled German factories and other industrial facilities that were transported to Yugoslavia. In response to the summons of the UN Economic and Social Council, West Germany (FRG) paid for indemnification, from the title of a special agreement with Yugoslavia, totaling 8 million German marks, on behalf of the Yugoslav citizens, who were victims of medical experiments on living people during the war. The amounts that were specified in the other international agreements with Germany from March 10, 1956, including 26 million German marks for insurance claims during and after World War II, were excluded from the reparations and are grounded on the implementation of the London Agreement on German External Debts from 1953.

Je l'avais lu à sa sortie :

Sur la forme : très biens écrit et très bon style, Zemmour n'a pas eu le prix Richelieu pour rien.

Sur le fond le livre est dual :


 * Roman style réaliste basé sur un fait réel.


 * Essai politique : Toute la pensée de Zemmour est dedans pour qui a l'esprit éveillé.

Edit : concernant le passage (qui n'est d’ailleurs pas écrit comme tu le cite même si le sens est le même), c'est une ligne et c'est drôle que ça te choque, as tu lu beaucoup de roman avant ?

By making ""ever closer union"" optional and creating a two tier system, those countries who wish to could futher integrate towards the eventual federal setup (after asking their citizens if thats what they want, I'd hope).

Yep. Genau das war meine Aussage. Sehr gut. Genau wie ""für Nationalmannschaft mitfiebern"" mit Nationalsozialismus gleichsetzen super tolle Kritik an einem Sozialstaat ist. Kommt ja immerhin in beiden das Wort ""National"" drin vor oder so... 

&gt;Der Staat ist in meinen Augen eher eine Art notwendiges Übel.

Natürlich ist er das. Duh! Menschen leben in Kollektiven. Erst war da vielleicht nur die Familie, dann war es der Stamm, dann war es eine Siedlung, dann war man Untertan, dann kam der Staat und bald wird es die Staatenunion. Im großen Maßstab sind wir in der Moderne alle im Kollektiv ""Menschen auf der Erde"". Ich verstehe dass manche Leute sich nicht mit dem Kollektiv ""Staat"" identifizieren können. Manche mögen nur ihre Familie und Freunde, manche mögen nur ihre Stadt, manche mögen nur sich selbst aber manche Menschen mögen halt das Land. 

Ich persönlich kann mich in den letzten Jahren immer mehr mit dem Gedanken anfreunden dass ich Deutscher bin. Ich akzeptiere ganz einfach, dass dieses Kollektiv ""Deutschland"" mir das Leben ermöglicht, was ich derzeit führe und das ich versuchen sollte an dem Kollektiv mitzuwirken. Das heißt aber noch nicht mal ansatzweise, dass ich dieses Kollektiv als perfekt erachte. Als das beste. Als Überlegen. ... Genau wie ich nicht denke, dass ich perfekt bin, das meine Familie und Freunde perfekt sind, das meine Stadt perfekt ist oder das Menschen perfekt sind. Eher das Gegenteil um ehrlich zu sein.

Worauf ich hinaus will (um den Bogen wieder zum ersten Kommentar zu schlagen): So albern es auch erscheinen mag (und vor über 10 Jahren hät' ich das extrem albern gefunden), ich freue mich wenn die Nationalmannschaft gewinnt, ich bin enttäuscht wenn sie verliert. Ich kann aber nicht erkennen, wie genau diese vielleicht auch albern wirkende emotionale Verbundenheit mich jetzt zum Nazi macht. Nur weil ich eine Sache mag, heißt das doch nicht dass ich alles anderen Verabscheue und Haße. ... Duh!

Any Italian whose daily schedule sees him to the local cafe around the corner that has been there for over 100years now is quite obviously an ignorant hick who doesn't recognize greatness when American tourists tell him where it is really at?

Beer in Germany is a *Lebensmittel*. It is in the truest sense of the word a means to nourish you, it is preferred to be local, it doesn't need to be new or fancy, it just has to be good - just the same as local bread (which will be, as I suspect, probably the next thing we will be lectured about once Americans discover it doesn't necessarily have to be sugar sprinkled fluff or the *extremely* overpriced but still very mediocre bread from the boutique bakery).

That is, it is something entirely different than a cocktail or a new washing detergent. I am MUCH happier drinking the same but awesome beer than trying five different kinds over the night. I did that for a while - we Germans call this time period ""puberty"". The only thing that's problematic with German beer is that the big breweries snagged up many of the smaller ones. The southern Germans - especially the Franks - have resisted this development to a point, so that's why so many cities and even just villages have their own, local beer.

So yes, ""the"" Germans should learn a thing or two about beer. Not from the Americans, but from the Franks. 


This being said: Please continue with your blog (seriously). I always enjoy other (articulated) opinions, even if I don't happen to agree with them. 

Edit: I forgot to add: This ""Germans don't like to try new stuff"" is getting pretty old too. This is Europe. I have been to *at least one* foreign country *every year* since *I was born*, I picked up that pace *significantly* since I graduated. I always try all the stuff that's on offer locally. So please, dear American expat (not you personally, but I live in Berlin so I know the type) with your *""I-went-on-Eurorail-not-once-but-twice!!!!""* travel-expertise: You really don't need to lecture me about Belgium. They are our close neighbours, I have been there more times than I can recall. Still not a fan of their beer.

&gt; It's considered totally abhorrent that humans should have rights that cannot be taken away from them, simply by virtue of being human. 

Nobody is saying that the there should be no human rights in the UK at all. The UK has a long tradition of rights. The proposal is that the UK enacts its own Bill of Rights. There is no conceptual reason why rights should be decided at the European level, rather than for example the national level or the global level.

While some points make no sense at all for me (""no one here is ready for a double IPA especially if it comes in a 0,5L bottle!"") or are at least very sensationalised, I think the articles are quite a good overview of the German beer market.

Your description of everyone chosing his very own brand of favourite beer seems just about right to me. 

A problem with the German craft-beer scene is, as far as I know, the Reinheitsgebot itself. You cannot call your produce ""beer"" legally, if it is not within the restrictions of the Reinheitsgebot (at least that's how I remember it). Also there simply was ""no need"" for craft breweries around here. The choice you have is vastly different from region to region or even from town to town. Check http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_aktiver_Brauereien_in_Deutschland  (only in German, but You'll get the drift - It's a list of active breweries in Germany)

Of course the majority of beer you can buy will be one of a few styles - but that does not mean there is no alternative.

For Your observation of ""Germans do not like foreign beers"" - I've had bad experiences with them... the foreign beer you get at ordinary shops are either Guinness or tasteless export water-like mixtures like Fosters, Heineken and so on (For what it's worth: I think German export beers won't be much better elsewhere...). 
While I like to try everything I can at least once (ffs, I would even try Bud Light, if I got the chance - even though that seems so wrong to me) some kinds of imported beer just didnt met my taste.

I really started to like British ales, some IPAs I've tried were interesting to me, but nothing I would order ""just to drink beer"". It's more of an effort to drink those styles of beer. Not Your ""I've had a rough day - let's open a Helles and calm down""-type of drink.

But I don't know if that still counts for people that don't speak 2 languages already (it's obvious that there are a lot of overlapping words if your first language is German, you speak fluent English and your target language is Norwegian as it is in my case). So, Memrise for vocab.

Then you need something for grammar. Duolingo is shit in terms of grammar. Try to find a learner's reference grammar. Wikipedia would work as well (the big 4 for Anglophones (Italian, French, German and Spanish) usually have very good wikipedia articles) but they get really technical. German grammaticalises a lot and in general is more conservative with grammar so having something where you can find explanations for grammatical features would be nice. We get ""why is 'the' translated as 'der', 'die' or 'das'?"" way to often. At least in the old subreddit.

You should also learn IPA. Duolingo only has fake recordings that are horrible sometimes. A podcast or a YouTube video might not cut it in terms of pronunciation. Text books usually provide recordings from a studio environment without any other noises in the background. It might be harder to properly hear the difference in sound if you don't have this sort of material. Especially with letters like ""l"" where both languages are really close but not quite the same. So, learn IPA so you know where German and English sounds differ and then look at the wikipedia pages for English and German phonology. If you're unsure how to pronounce something, those pages will help you the most (don't listen to some dude telling you ""oh, it's like 60% D and 30% L and 10% R"" like some tried to explain me the Japanese R... IPA is precise and on the point. Like Germans!)

Try to listen to as much stuff as possible. Netflix has some German films, podcasts are available, we also have some YouTubers but most of them are games related. There is a German audible site so if you have an email address that is not linked to an amazon account, you might be able to get a free German audio book. You need to get used to the flow of the language. IPA can only tell you how phonemes are being pronounced but not how they're linked. 

And lastly, lang-8.com. Write a journal there. Every day. Even if you just say. ""Today, I learnt the word for 'gay' because I googled schwul instead of schwül. I think umlauts are important or the weather is weird in Germany"" (Heute habe ich das Wort für ""gay"" gelernt, weil ich ""schwul"" und nicht ""schwül"" gegooglet habe. Ich denke Umlaute sind wichtig oder das Wetter in Deutschland ist komisch). How it works is quite interesting. You correct stuff people write in English which will give you points. The more points you gained recently the higher will your posts be and that means that people are more likely to correct your stuff. 

I think that's pretty much it. Like I said, a text book is a much cleaner cut (though, you'd still use lots of the stuff I mentioned. Just not exclusively).

Also, you said you like games. German (apart from French) is the only language that always gets their own servers in many games. So if you like game games and not facebook games (not judgeing just saying), you might want to take a look at that as well. I met many Russians and Chinese people in German servers trying to learn German.",0,1403028909,null,0,false,0,ci9ztpm,t3_28dwas,t1_ci9ztpm,t3_28dwas,null,1434281174,11,false,German,t5_2qq51,11

true,TheEndgame,NORW,Norway,"&gt; PISA testing should not be the #1 indicator about the quality of education. For some reason a lot of people are ignoring a hundred years of pedagogy research in favour of a very particular set of tests.

It doesn't give the whole picture, but it can be used as an indicator. The Norwegian school system is extremely free compared to most countries. While this is preferable to the extremes of Asian countries, a little more disipline wouldn't hurt. Switzerland is a good example.

Also it's far from only the education it self that matters. Things like the quality of books and buildings are also important. Needless to say rotten schools are not an uncommon sight. Somethings that is a shame really.

&gt; Our Universities might not be highly rated, but we are a nation of 5 million, and I believe Universitetet i Oslo is highly enough rated for that. They're also all completely free, which I would take in a heartbeat over a few top ranked universities that cost fortunes to get into.

It depends. Schools like Harvard and MIT are free for students that have parents with lower incomes. While we are a small country, we have huge resources and should have no problem attracting talent. Too bad highly skilled jobs are not paid as good in Norway compared to other countries like the U.K and U.S.

They fired all of the workers and rehired them to lower their wages and worsen their terms. This is probably the definition of wage dumping. Can you even read Swedish?

Don't be stupid. This is hard evidence of wage dumping.

Because the youth unemployment has gone up. This is a problem overall and not just Sweden.

I know some users are a bit harsh some times on the language thing, but I like to think that those people are a vocal minority.  
We are a small community so it's also easy for that vocal minority to stand out.  
As you can see, the two people who commented in your last post about the language both got downvoted, so it's not like that is the general feeling.  
You have to understand that with the current events and all it's kind of reasonable as well for some people to want to put out more 'catalan-ness' and for some to get a bit sensitive with the spanish and stuff.  
In my last post I mentioned that people should try and be a bit nicer to visitors, especially with the Barna-Barça-barca story and it seems that some of them do it in a light-hearted, jokey manner.  

I would also like to see some more original content on this subreddit and I'm trying to post something almost every day. Some times it gets downvoted because people don't like it and it's ok. Some times people like it more and upvote. That's the deal.  
Since you mentioned you are rarely a contributor, I would encourage you to start posting the content you want to see in our subreddit and more users will follow. :)

EDIT: On this:
&gt; Most of the posts get downvoted for no apparent reason unless it is in favor of Cataluña, Catalan language or Catalan independence. 

I would also like to add that the content I have posted in Catalan did worse on average than my other English posts, so personally I didn't feel that the community of this subreddit generally prefers pro-catalan content, at least not to the degree you are describing it.

There is a problem with prejudiced landlords. Unless you are a white Western couple, then being an immigrant can cause a lot of disappointments when trying to rent an apartment. Try calling for an apartment with a heavy accent and name ""Öztürk"". No idea about OP and it's an awful topic anyways. 

If landlords can choose amongst 50 applicants (as they often can these days in the big metro-areas), they filter out in a brute way. 

And there is another issue: If you own an apartment and your tennant trashes it, a longtime German resident has a harder time to evade paying the damages by disappearing compared with someone who only plans to stay for a few years on a job. Such fears might trigger rejection as well for ""global nomads"". 

I agree with your advice to try to hire a Makler and convince him of the difficult situation (language barrier, etc) . It'll likely cost 2.38 monthly rents, but if he makes the recommendation to the landlord, there'll be a better success rate. Makler is looking for good income people mostly (in relation to the rent).

One thing to add to what /u/pheasant-plucker said, the National Insurance contribution is a payroll tax (typically 10% of take-home pay) that is matched by an employer contribution, so your employer pays the same amount as you do. If you earn no money, you don't have to make NI contributions, but you still get NHS treatment as a basic right.

Another important fact is that paying NI contributions for a certain number of years (I think it's 32 right now?) is what makes you eligible to receive a state pension, so in a sense, you kind of get a refund on your NI contributions when you retire, although not entirely, and how much you get back isn't correlated with how much you pay in, since you pay a percentage of your pay to NI and not a flat rate.

true,cbr777,ROMA,Romania,"&gt; Remember this is the election characterised by Eurosceptic success. The population at large is far less pro-EU than it has been. So although the EP may well object to everything, it has a reputation it could do with not damaging. They may well proceed in objecting to everyone except the withdrawn candidate (who is at that point out of the race and therefore useless), but it may also come at a cost.

A perfect example of British ignorance, the Eurosceptic ""success"" is a myth, while yes, in some countries, like the UK, where EU politics are next to toxic,EU sceptics managed to get vote in most countries Eurosceptic parties were a massive flop. Get out of your bubble and smell the roses, almost nobody agrees with you and even those that are inclined to do so think Cameron is out of his fucking mind.

&gt;The European Council, to date, has also operated with consensus despite QMV being an option. Of course there's always a first time for everything, though it would establish a very different mood within the Council. Its tough to predict what that would be.

The EC operates on pragmatism and it's become very clear that the EP will not vote for anyone but Juncker, if the EC tries to push another candidate they will run into a wall in the EP. None of the European leaders, except Cameron want that, something that can be seen from their actions after the election.

I am at thing time 90% sure that Juncker will be nominated, simply because the EC has no option left to nominate somebody else and not be made a joke of by  the EP.

&gt;On the contrary. With Juncker facing plenty of opposition, what mandate he had is reduced even more. He has more of a reason to compromise as a result of what has happened than if nobody had objected to him.

You truly have no clue how politics work do you? You think making enemies of others is a way to get what you want? Delusional.

It's truly shocking how badly Cameron fucked this up, how be painted himself into a corner and guaranteed that other EU leaders couldn't help him even if he wanted to. Not only did he pick the wrong hill to make his stand on, but he made it in such a blackmail way that he guaranteed none of the others, even those that might be willing to listen, be caught dead next to him.

One thing is clear... he should fire his advisers straight away and get new ones.

If we were to take Marx's analysis - which is statistically supported by Piketty(This is excluding Marx's own work which is sufficient in of itself) - yes. Using Marx as an example, he theorizes that Capitalism has a time and place in terms of propelling economic and scientific progress, but will inevitably become detrimental to the population, stagnate and lead to ever increasing inequality, erosion of democracy and, eventually, tyranny.

The evidence of these predictions coming to pass is evident for every informed person to see, regardless of your stance of Marxism or Socialism in general.

And to add, it's argued the, in the same way Capitalism emerged from Feudalism, Socialism will emerge from Capitalism and, some argue, Communism will emerge from Socialism. 

It's a natural process. You will not find many Socialists who will say ""Capitalism has never done anything good"", but you will find that every Socialist will say ""Capitalism is not benefiting the population anymore, it's time we need to move on"", and that stance is very much supported by the facts, and you can see the effects of Capitalism very presently in current events.",1,1403033206,null,0,1403034961,0,cia232i,t3_28di4i,t1_cia232i,t1_ci9z548,null,1434282218,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2
true,pfdwxenon,null,null,"I guuess you have to dig a little deeper into the history of the GDR and the city itself to understand how they ""do live"".

Magdeburg was a strong heavy-industry city in the former GDR - you can see the remains in several parts of the city - mostly deserted. The city was bombed to the ground at WW2 and not much ""pitoresque"" housing was left. What was left did deteriorate in the socialist regime. 

Nowadays there are some very beautiful streets.

So I came from southern western Germany to Magdeburg and even me had to learn a lot to better understand people. There´s still a tendency of young people moving out towards the west because they can´t see a future for them in Magdeburg. 
The university also doesn´t have much history - it´s the youngest in germany (1993?).

One of the first things in MD I wondered was the absolut indifference of anyone doing a ""service-job"". Each waitress had a neverending distaste for her job and clearly showing it to me as a customer. People seem a little bit depressed, just for the reason they ""couldn´t get away"". They also have the strong tendency to think badly about their own city, which btw is one of the greenest cities I ever lived in - and definitely the cheapest. (I saw flats that cost less rent then heating and add. costs).

So from my experience the people in Magdeburg form 2 groups - They either are ""die-hard"" fans of their city (maybe just as a kind of counterpoint) or they wanna leave as soon as possible to somewhee else (West Germany preferred).

As a foreigner you will never be able to be part or sympathize with one of the groups - because if you say ""I would leave too"" you´re automatically against everyone; if you say ""I think it´s beautiful around here"" everyone knows you´re lying ;-)

Some stuff will be repetitive and you will not be able to avoid it, like for example learning irregular verb forms.

**Grammar:** If you are not sure about a certain word, [Duden.de](http://www.Duden.de) and [de.wiktionary.org](http://de.wiktionary.org) are the places to go, I guess. They have meanings, synonyms, declensions and conjugations for most basic words. 

*****

**Pronunciation:** The two aforementioned sites also feature IPA for basic and difficult-to-pronounce words. Duden.de also features a few recordings of pronunciations from the ARD (German television) database.
Since you are going for philosophy, you will encounter many rare, ""artificial"" and complex words. That's why I would recommend [Forvo.com.](http://www.Forvo.com) Forvo features a huge database of pronunciations recorded by native speakers and with 360,000 recordings, the German section is the largest.

**Dictionaries:** Looking for a certain word? [LEO.org](http://www.leo.org) and [dict.cc](http://www.dict.cc) are the biggest crowd-sourced German-English dictionaries based in Germany. They also feature many other languages. Dict supports more languages, LEO has a better community. The way they are organised is also a bit different. Look for yourself which one you like better.

**Newspapers:** 

*    The German edition of [The Local](http://www.thelocal.de) gives a good overview over German news (in English) and also features articles about the German culture. Maybe less interesting for you, but you can still give it a shot.

*    There is an online newspaper for kids in easy German: [news4kids](http://www.news4kids.de/)

**TV:** It is possible to watch parts of the programmes of German public TV channels online, both as live-stream and after the show.

true,balanceofpain,null,null,"&gt; Es gibt so viele Fälle, in denen sich Frau Merkel gegen die Mehrheit entscheidet, trotzdem sagt diese Mehrheit nicht: „Sie bringt uns um unsere Stimme!“

Willkommen im Republikanismus, Herr Willemsen.  Es bedarf schon eines gerüttelten Maßes an Desinteresse, wenn man ein Jahr lang dem Parlament erhöhte Aufmerksamkeit schenkt, und dann trotzdem noch dermaßen eklatante Unkenntnis in solch basalen Dingen offenbart.  Willemsen hat nicht den Bundestag beobachtet, wie es ein denkender und interessierter Mensch getan hätte, sondern wie jemand, der am Ende sagen können möchte, dass er es getan hat, um dann damit ein Buch zu verkaufen.  Man erkennt an Politik bloß vorgeblich Interessierte leicht an ihrer echauffierten Verwunderung darüber, dass im Plenum nur selten wirkliche Argumentationsarbeit geleistet wird, während die Sacharbeit in den Ausschüssen geschieht.  Die Frage, warum dies so ist, stellen sie sich genauso wie die Frage nach einer gangbaren Alternative nie.  Dabei ist der Übergang vom »Plenums-« zum »Ausschussparlament« ein gut untersuchter Aspekt des Parlamentarismus.  Die wirklich Dummen beschweren sich dann noch darüber, dass der Plenarsaal ständig fast leer ist, ohne sich zu fragen, wie die Abgeordneten noch produktiv arbeiten sollen, wenn sie ständig im Plenarsaal hocken, und halten Dinge wie Pairing-Vereinbarungen für ein Symptom politischer Korruption.

An der Qualität der Darbietungen im Bundestag kann man viel kritisieren.  Aber auch hier muss man zuerst die Frage nach den Bedingungen stellen: Wie sollen Abgeordnete, die nach 1970 geboren worden sind, je eine passable Rhetorik ausbilden, wenn Stilistik und Rhetorik nur noch auf humanistischen Gymnasien Eingang in den Unterricht finden?  Einmal im Deutsch-LK eine Rede zu verfassen, reißt es nicht heraus, und Zeit zum Deklamieren werden die Politiker schon am Anfang ihrer Karriere kaum noch finden.  Ergo sind die Darbietungen verglichen mit denen der Altvorderen (Wehner etc.) stümperhaft.

Im Übrigen bleibt zu sagen, dass der 18. Deutsche Bundestag sich schlecht für die Auseinandersetzung mit dem Parlamentsgeschehen eignet. Vier-Fünftel-Mehrheiten müssen gähnende Langeweile zeitigen, weswegen ich meine politische Aufmerksamkeit verstärkt auf die anderen Subsidiaritätsebenen verteile und allen dasselbe anrate.",0,1403033428,null,0,false,0,cia27cu,t3_28dgl1,t1_cia27cu,t3_28dgl1,null,1434282274,18,false,de,t5_22i0,18

Really? This was the most successful election the sceptics have ever had,  including winning the thing in two of the three biggest EU nations. At no point have I said they have a majority, or anything close! It is ignorant to ignore those gains, as you clearly do.

Its a negotiation, one he maybe losing, but a negotiation nonetheless.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"&gt;So the housing shortage

We have plenty of houses - generally speaking. Millions of empty ones. People just don't want to sell them and would rather they lie derelict than have them be used by the poor. It isn't the same in every single country, but especially in places there was a housing boom - like Spain - there are so many houses we could give each individual immigrant to Europe a house in Spain for years before we ran out. So I don't think ""housing shortage"" is an apt name, it's more ""The developers don't want to sell because they think they can make more money"".

&gt;wage dumps

Are not a part of immigration. They're a result of companies moving abroad, and the government laying off on forcing wage increases in order to try and keep companies in their country. This is a product of neoliberal globalization - not immigration.

Wage dumping ~~is~~isn't done to make natives compete with immigrants, it's done to compete with other countries.

&gt;If a bulgarian truck driver take over the job of the Swedish truck driver the Swedish truck driver suddenly has no income or has to compete with the wages the bulgarian truck driver gets, which is around half. There is no way to make a living with such a salary.

You're right, you can't make a living. If a Bulgarian is moving to Sweden and taking a job in a logistics company, he will need a living wage. If a Bulgarian is in Bulgaria and taking a Swede's job, that's just outsourcing and that has nothing to do with immigration, but with neoliberal globalization of the workforce.

We can keep increasing the minimum wage, but all that will lead to in the long run is capital flight to other, poorly regulated countries, as is happening now with manufacturing and resource harvesting in South America, Africa and Asia. 

&gt;All radical solutions are bad, we should make this process slow so these type of wage gaps cannot happen.

This is just the middle ground fallacy. An ""even"" approach isn't necessarily the best one.

It is that same ""even"" approach that has led to this situation, with Social Democratic governments being unable to pay their bills and being unable to keep their population happy and employed.

Not in Sweden. It's difficult to get building permits.

&gt; People just don't want to sell them and would rather they lie derelict than have them be used by the poor.

I think I want to see a source on that claim.

&gt; So I don't think ""housing shortage"" is an apt name, it's more ""The developers don't want to sell because they think they can make more money"".

It is. Spain isn't Sweden.

&gt; Are not a part of immigration.

Immigration is one of the leading contributing factors of wage dumping yes. See the videos I've provided in the other comments.

&gt; They're a result of companies moving abroad, and the government laying off on forcing wage increases in order to try and keep companies in their country.

It's crazy to believe that we should move all factories etc to romania or bulgaria because they work for half the salary. If we did then the Swedes would be out of jobs and out of money.

&gt; This is a product of neoliberal globalization - not immigration.

It's not one or the other. We have regulations against globalization because otherwise people get exploited.

&gt; If a Bulgarian is in Bulgaria and taking a Swede's job, that's just outsourcing and that has nothing to do with immigration, but with neoliberal globalization of the workforce.

It is outsourcing, something that should be regulated more. It's the society's loss.

&gt; We can keep increasing the minimum wage, but all that will lead to in the long run is capital flight to other, poorly regulated countries, as is happening now with manufacturing and resource harvesting in South America, Africa and Asia.

Sweden doesn't have a minimum wage. Also are you claiming that higher wages for the proletarians lead to a worse society?

&gt; This is just the middle ground fallacy. An ""even"" approach isn't necessarily the best one.

So isn't a radical. Tell me, what radical solutions have been good for the societies?

&gt; It is that same ""even"" approach that has led to this situation, with Social Democratic governments being unable to pay their bills and being unable to keep their population happy and employed. One would argue that the only solution would be a radical one.

So you're saying radical solutions are the best because... why? Higher unemployment and more debt and you want to open up borders and let more people come? That's a twisted worldview if you think that'll be a good solution.

Also, the housing shortage isn't something to really debate, it's a fact.

true,IntelligentNickname,SWED,Sweden,"&gt; If we were to take Marx's analysis - which is statistically supported by Piketty(This is excluding Marx's own work which is sufficient in of itself) - yes. Using Marx as an example, he theorizes that Capitalism has a time and place in terms of propelling economic and scientific progress, but will inevitably become detrimental to the population, stagnate and lead to ever increasing inequality, erosion of democracy and, eventually, tyranny.

Ahh, so Marx says his theory is flawless? Gotcha. Besides how can you tell when that is? The economy stagnated during the great depression but quickly rose back up. Does Marx explain what factors will contribute to the fall of society?

&gt; The evidence of these predictions coming to pass is evident for every informed person to see, regardless of your stance of Marxism or Socialism in general.

It reminds me of the 2012 thing with the maya indians.

&gt; And to add, it's argued the, in the same way Capitalism emerged from Feudalism, Socialism will emerge from Capitalism and, some argue, Communism will emerge from Socialism.

If you believe communism is a good choice currently then you're clearly mistaken. Communism has too many flaws to be properly implimented. Firstly you'll need a homogeneous group. Secondly you'll need zero corruption and thirdly you'll need nearly endless of resources.

&gt; It's a natural process. You will not find many Socialists who will say ""Capitalism has never done anything good"", but you will find that every Socialist will say ""Capitalism is not benefiting the population anymore, it's time we need to move on"", and that stance is very much supported by the facts, and you can see the effects of Capitalism very presently in current events.

Move on? To communism? This is stupid talk. Give me any pros with communism over capitalism? Excluding the bullshit of ""everyone will be equal, none will be poor"".

What the question? What I want to do? What I want other people in the world to do? What I want European to do? Or what I want my government to do?

I personally would invest in some green energy to produce energy, as soon as it is a benefit compared to the nuclear energy I can buy in my country.

I don't have a particular problem with nuclear reactors. So I don't mind if people in the world use it.

European and government.. it's different. If they chose the option that cost more, that is to say, green energies today, I would be angry. Because they would render everyone poorer (but the creator of those energies).

&gt; Plus, it's not like we have a comfortable amount of time to wait it out. 

Yes we do. We have a few decades. It's far enough to overdevelop green technologies until it cost nothing. And I don't want the government and Europe to force me to pay more for these energies, because maybe it might cause a big problem sometimes during these few decades.

&gt; To rely on a potential future invention sets you up for failure imo.

Agreed on a personal level. But I don't want to talk for my neighbor that eat cat-food because he can't afford anything else. For them it's already a failure.

&gt; So in your mind you can break down nuclear reactors but not windmills? 

That's another problem but there is far more materials that is used never to be recycled again for green energy than for nuclear energy. Even by taking into account the waste product problem.

The green transition has to be smooth. Because if we overinvest in it to soon, we will lose money on the rest and the result will be a more poorer world.

In fact the debate is always the same: a certain risk (poorer world) versus a potential more deadly risk (Chernobyl even stronger)?

That's up to contention.

&gt;The economy stagnated during the great depression but quickly rose back up.

That's not really relevant on the long term. 

&gt;Does Marx explain what factors will contribute to the fall of society?

Rampant inequality tends to lead to rapid change.

&gt;It reminds me of the 2012 thing with the maya indians.

DAE THINK ECONOMICS THAT'S WELL FOUNDED IN WELL SOURCED STATISTICS BY VARIOUS EXTREMELY PROFICIENT AND REPUTABLE EXPERTS IN THEIR FIELD = STONE CARVED BY NATIVE AMERICANS THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO?

&gt;If you believe communism is a good choice currently then you're clearly mistaken.

Who said anything about me supporting Communism? I'm a staunch Socialist. That doesn't mean I'm a Communist, though in a world where people are taught nothing about Socialism except through Hollywood movies and Right Wing rhetoric, I'm not surprised you think the way you do.

&gt;This is stupid talk.

We've had this conversation before in other threads, and I've consistently felt like I'm talking to a 5 year old. The last time we went through this you told me the USA and Russia are both Communist states and that there is no economic basis for the idea of increasing inequality.

If there's ""stupid talk"" going on - a totally unnecessary insult towards someone who's trying to have a productive conversation with you, by the way - it isn't coming from me.

 &gt;Give me any pros with communism over capitalism?

We've also had this conversation before, and all you could come up with to refute me is the ""human nature"" argument which has no factual basis at all.

&gt; Besides I never hear anyone from Social democrates talking about communism.

That's because Social Democracy has absolutely nothing to do with Communism. It's a bastardization of Socialism that tries to maintain Capitalism while improving people's lives through a welfare state, which is well intentioned but in the long run changes nothing.

&gt; Who said anything about me supporting Communism? I'm a staunch Socialist. That doesn't mean I'm a Communist, though in a world where people are taught nothing about Socialism except through Hollywood movies and Right Wing rhetoric, I'm not surprised you think the way you do.

Coming from the most socialist country in the world I know nothing about socialism except from American propaganda. No but seriously I know full well what socialism is.

&gt; The last time we went through this you told me the USA and Russia are both Communist states and that there is no economic basis for the idea of increasing inequality.

I don't recall saying that USA is a communist state, but Russia is, or recently was. They have a one party rule which is communist.

&gt; If there's ""stupid talk"" going on - a totally unnecessary insult towards someone who's trying to have a productive conversation with you, by the way - it isn't coming from me.

You lack sources for your claims. If you feel offended then I apologize.

I came up with economic, futuristic and humanistic arguments while you're pretending it's raining or something.

&gt; That's because Social Democracy has absolutely nothing to do with Communism.

Why do you then claim ""...you will find that every Socialist will say ""Capitalism is not benefiting the population anymore, it's time we need to move on""""?

&gt; It's a bastardization of Socialism that tries to maintain Capitalism while improving people's lives through a welfare state, which is well intentioned but in the long run changes nothing.

What you're really proposing is a society where everything is free and that everyone can live in peace and harmony. Can you come up with one person who doesn't want to do that (who isn't mentally ill - this includes satanists, religious nutcases or whatever)?

Ukraine was a part of Russia from the time Russia conquered it from the Muslims till 1991 when the west (and Gorbachev - who should be put against the wall and shot as a traitor for his part in the affair) broke up the country. Ukraine is to Russia what Texas is to America. If Texas split off 20 years ago as a result of Soviet machinations, would you have a whole lot of respect for its sovereignty?

In fact, if I remember correctly, America once had a problem with some rebellious provinces. Granted, the Confederacy wasn't backed by NATO so the war was a lot shorter, but that's what this is: war. Russia cannot just stand by and watch the US try to isolate it gradually. The country's large and too trade connected to be isolated entirely, so this risk is worthwhile.

Look at Crimea. Up until it happened I had no idea how much the balance of power has changed since Yeltsin. Russia takes land, and all the US can do is huff and puff! I never thought I'd see the country regain this much strength in my lifetime. 

Rest assured, the moment NATO weakens or the US is no longer able/willing to maintain an imperial presence, Russia is retaking what's theirs.

What's more, is that Russia can afford to play the waiting game, like the Sunnis did in Iraq and the Talibs are doing in Afghanistan. That part of the world is where Russian interests are irrevocably tied to. The US is only there because of imperial overreach, they have no organic interests in Ukraine. Russia doesn't have to take Ukraine tomorrow. Maybe next year, maybe in a decade, and maybe in a century. All I know is that Russia will exert force over eastern Europe for far longer than the US will just by nature of its proximity.

Of course I can, for a price. The only reason why I couldnt do so is because of you damn pseudoenvironmentalists. The reasons are once again political, not technical, and it is people like you who are the problem. Moreover, international collaboration in storing waste will be neccessary in the future anyway, it is not a good permanent solution for every country to have its own storage.

&gt;But you said that ""there are many areas""? Surely you wouldn't just talk shit while having no actual clue? I mean you are basically saying that the 40 years we've been working on this in Germany (and still haven't made any real progress) were inefficient and for you it would be easy: So I'm once more asking to actually provide any citation for your wild claims or to accept that all you do is talk shit (""about pseudoenvironmentalist""). I want facts. You claim it's easily possible, the solution is ""deep geological storage"" and it's not hard or costly, it's just political will: Well you got all the will in the world. Tell me where in Germany it's neither costly nor hard and where it's save. I'm waiting, I want a real answer.

Actually there almost certainly are many areas suitable for storage in Germany. Best is to store it deep in granite rocks which do exist in Germany. I will not point you to a definite area because I am not knowledgeable anough about their geology. But it is trivialy true that there are such places. Which inevitably means that the problems, and the reason behind 40 year delay, is mostly political, not technical. And its not like the waste is going anywhere, so delays are also because in reality nuclear waste is not a particularly pressing issue.

&gt;pardon my tone, I get really annoyed when I meet armchair experts on the internet who refuse to do basic research

true,Asyx,native,native,"In terms of IPA, [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) is a general overview about what it does. You don't need to learn to read IPA fluently. Just what it does and how it works. Don't get scared of the charts. Since it's meant to represent all languages, it looks quite scary.

Now, look at the charts for [English Phonology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_phonology), [German Phonology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_phonology) and the [German IPA help](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_German).

What is important to know is what the words in the chart mean. For consonants, the rows are basically how you produce the sound. It starts with ""nasal"" which are sounds where the air flows through the nose (n and m for example). Then there are stops which means that you block of the air flow completely (p, b. k, g) and so on. Then, the columns are about where the air is affected by your mouth (mostly the tongue). Bilabial are sounds that use both lips (m, p, b). The left one in a cell is always unvoiced (p), the right one voiced (b). Voiced means that your vocal courts vibrate.

Important is, that you realise that sounds might be really close but not the same. The English L is usually with your tongue somewhere behind your teeth. In German, the tongue is at the teeth. That will make you sound a lot more fluent. Also important to know, English R and German R are completely unrelated sounds. So learn how to produce the German R. Basically, it's an easy way to see how to pronounce which sounds. Look at least at the German IPA help page because there are English examples.

Just look for Dota 2 German on YouTube. I don't watch any German YouTubers but I know that nothing but gaming is actually a viable way to make money on YouTube exclusively in German. Also, don't bother with a European Dota 2 server. More than ""me mid you noob lol"" won't be said anyway. RPGs is where it's at in Germany if that's your thing (and I could suggest much more stuff for that as well. At least in terms of podcasts and websites). We even have our very own world of warcraft audio drama! It has like 25 episodes! And some dude that made fun of the classes in wow who is also part of the audio drama. I don't know if you're into that sort of thing but he has a youtube channel as well. [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/SuperGamesTV). He does a bit of everything.

But at least some foreigners) is watching. The whiny attitude, the excuses, the attempt to make anything and everybody just as responsible. Truly pathetic. 

The fact that we don't need another corrupt, broken, run down country which doesn't bring anything worthwhile to the table just adds to it.

Travels when it happened, including extensive stays at most areas where open war broke out.

true,HappyReaper,null,null,"Hi! I had some Erasmus friends over a couple of months ago, and they had a great time without going to traditional museums either. Besides what you already did, you could:

* Go for a walk through the old course of the river in Valencia. After it was redirected, the old course became a park, and it is really nice to walk or ride along with a bike. Actually, Bioparc and Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias are good places to get down there and start walking.

* The old city. It's great for a sightseeing walk, and you probably have seen some of it already in passing. Several big remarkable squares like the City Hall Square, the Queen Square, or the Virgin Square, but also smaller quieter ones where you can chill out for a while. Also many important buildings, like the marketplace (among the biggest in Europe, although it only opens in the morning), la Lonja (medieval building where traders used to meet), two sets of towers (Quart and Serrans) which used to be the doors to the city, and plenty of old churches. If you don't mind narrow staircases, be sure to climb the Micalet in the Queen Square's Cathedral, to get an awesome view of the whole city.

* Some towns near Valencia can be very interesting to spend a day or part of it. We went to Sagunt, which isn't far by train, and has a lot of old Roman ruins. The old castle on the top of the hill is huge, and although it doesn't have ceilings or interiors any more (so bring your water bottles, specially if it's a sunny day) I was amazed at how much of it remains considering how old it is.

* Finally, this can be a little too sudden as usually it's reserved in advance, but there are many places which offer boat rides through l'Albufera (the huge lake south of the city). It can be both relaxing and interesting if you are into nature.

Please stop making it sound like he is the number 1 economist on the planet. He may be, temporarily, the most talked about, since his book has become very popular and therefore sparked discussion, but the majority of experts - by a fair margin - reject his thesis, that capitalism is the downfall of society.

While Capitalism surely has inherent flaws, history has proven again and again that it is the most optimal economic system there is, as long as you assume that a coutry is not following ""pure capitalism"" but rather a social market economy.

Yes, it is absolutely undeniable that Capitalism, in the past, has seen us through great strides in science and technology. But this was due to the State, not private enterprise. Almost every piece of tech we have is a product of US, Soviet or European government research projects(Usually for military use). Cuba, what tried to be a Socialist state, has more doctors per capita than anywhere else and exports them all over the world. These are the kind of things we should be caring about.

These strides could have been done without Capitalism. 

Capitalism has, and continues to, empower the wealthy. It is no surprise that under economic blockade, industrial espionage and military threat, that countries that have attempted Socialism have turned into authoritarian and economically inefficient regimes. 

There is a continuing disparity in inequality, and it is a widening gap. This has been shown long before Piketty came about. While Capitalism may have done great things for us, it's also done [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Savar_building_collapse), [this](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/11/10/article-2060030-0EBC25F400000578-685_468x366.jpg), [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State#Humanitarian_disaster), [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery), and has inflicted many, many other cruelties upon humanity.

As Chaplain said, [dictators empower themselves, but enslave the people](http://youtu.be/QcvjoWOwnn4?t=1m5s)

It is a fundamentally exploitative system, and while it's good at making money(A reality that is becoming less and less apparent, as more and more capital enters the hands of few individuals and wealth stops circulating, a problem we haven't seen since the so-called ""Dark Ages""), it isn't good at improving the lives of the general population, and it's something we should be actively working against.",0,1403046765,null,0,1403047725,0,cia8teb,t3_28di4i,t1_cia8teb,t1_cia8ijd,null,1434285455,0,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,0

It does not explain why it happened.

Tell me why did they kill the innocent? Because they were evil? Is it enough to know that some people killed other group of people just because they were inherently evil? Is that good an answer for you? Not for me. Just think for a minute, why would somebody see random women and children as a threat to their security? There is no justification, or reasoning, no right or wrong, no human rights, or countries to put laws: forget all this, there is you and your life. What do you do? What drives you?

About justification, I refuse to justify any death, or put a meaning to it, because it puts into a trap. There were just people trying to survive fighting anything they say as threat. Just answer me a question how come Ukrainian Polish citizens became on different side of barricades? What about Jewish Polish, Belorussian Polish...? Why would anybody see a person of some ethnicity as a threat to their lives?

Imagine being an oppressed minority for decades, and being killed, starved, where (in modern terms) your state did not provide for your human right for your life, and there comes some other people, who say:
now nobody will kill you, take your food, starve you to death, or take you to war if you do not volunteer, you are in charge now, here is working administration, here are just courts (not seen before) and working healthcare system for all (not available for them before), of course you will support ""your own"" people and regard them as heroes. It is nothing unnatural about that, Poles also do this. Just an adage ""he is a son of a bitch, but he is our son of a bitch"" says a lot.

I am sorry for the rant, it just hurts so deeply to see, that there is still so many artificial divisions and no trying to even understand what happened.

If you just look at history of WWII, you can see bunch of different histories: Ukrainian, Polish, Belorussian, Russian, Jewish, Communist histories, that are all so different, except the fact that they all talk about the same people and happened in the same place. The only common thing that non of them tell any history at all.

I do not know if it will get through to you, but it is immensely sad to see the same mistakes of reasoning, that actually caused all the suffering to be repeated in a discussion here.

You can usually find good places to stay at airbnb.com.  You get a room sometimes for as low as $50 or $60 per night.  Moreover the owners of the room are usually locals and can point you in the right direction.

As for sightseeing there are a few pretty cool places in Bologna.  You'll definitely wanna head over to the city center and the main piazza, called Piazza Maggiore.  There you'll find a huge cathedral which is pretty nice inside, I think they just finished renovating it too.  Depending on how long you be there, you might wanna take the walk to San Luca.  It is a church at the top of one of the hills just outside the city.  The view up there is great, well worth the 45-50 minute walk from center city.  If you happen to be there on a weekend that's even better.  The two main streets in the center of city are shaped like a ""T"".  During the weekends (and holidays) they are closed off to vehicle traffic and people are outside shopping and enjoying the street performers.  Also in the city center there are the Two Towers (le due torre) that are left over from the middle ages.  The tallest one on the right you can actually climb for €3 for a really great view of the city and the hills around it.  Looking at the towers, to the left is Via Zamboni.  This is the university area and where you want to be if you decide to go out at night.  There are several bars on that street like Clauricaune's Irish Pub, English Empire, and a bit further down there is a discopub called Lord Lister's which is always fun.  There are also a few clubs on that street, but I'd recommend the bars.  It is a bit expensive to get in and the drinks will run you about €8 for a cocktail.  A lot of places have university student discounts, tell them you're ""erasmus"" students (the study abroad program that a lot of europeans do) and you'll get a discount most of the time.

You catch the bus to Manzanares el Real (40 minutes from Plaza de Castilla) and hike in from there. If you have a lot of time and want to get a good view of the front half of the park, you can do the circuit of La Pedriza Anterior--in the summer it's best to avoid hiking on the south side of the mountain when there's full sun, so you hike it clockwise along the Manazanares then the ""autopista"" path to the Refugio Giner, follow the arroyo path from there to Collado de la Dehesilla, then climb to the top on the north face of the mountain and go up and over the massive pile of granite past el Yelmo, countless ibexes, and all sorts of other rock formations.

Another nice hike when it's hot enough to get in the water is the Charca Verde hike:

There are other swimming holes even further into the park as you follow the Manzanares to its source:

Für PKW Fahrer gibt es zB keine Vorschriften bezüglich des zu tragenden Schuhwerks beim Führen von Kraftfahrzeugen. Für LKW Fahrer bestehen diese Regeln jedoch. Meine Erfahrung beim LKW fahren: Die Kupplung geht leichter als beim PKW, die Bremse geht leichter als beim PKW. Warum also hier die Pflicht zum Tragen geschlossenen Schuhwerks? Ganz einfach, da der LKW Fahrer eine viel größere Verantwortung trifft als den PKW Fahrer. Die Folgen daraus dass sich ein LKW Fahrer nicht traut voll in die Eisen zu steigen weil er keine Sohle unter den Füßen hat, oder Gott bewahre hohe Schuhe trägt, können u.U. extrem viel weitreichender sein als wenn dem PKW Fahrer selbiges widerfährt, daher die Regulierung.

Eine gute Argumentation die hier bereits von jemandem vertreten wurde war, dass Führer von Mofas im Gegensatz zum Fahrrad nicht selbstangetrieben fahren, was dazu führt dass diese eher zur Selbstgefährdung neigen als Fahrradfahrer (oder Fahrradfahrende, für die SJW da draußen). Allerdings weiß ich nicht ob dieses Argument haltbar ist. Um den Kreis hier aber zu schließen: Die Strafbarkeit vom Drogenbesitz und Konsum ist fast schwerer haltbar (dogmatisch) als die Helmpflicht von Mofafahrern, trotzdem besteht sie. Und das ist so weil es Gesetz ist. Der Unterschied zu so einem Gerichtsurteil ist einfach: Fährste ohne Helm aufm Mofa, gibts Bußgeld (weil Gesetz), fährste Barfuß Auto gibts keins (yaaay!), nur in beiden Fällen hast du bei Schadensersatzansprüchen nach einem Unfall ganz schlechte Karten die volle Summe zu kassieren, was sich auch wieder aus dem Gesetz ergibt, nämlich aus [diesem hier](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__254.html).

EDIT: Shit du hast von Rollerfahrern gesprochen: Dann liegt die Sache auf der Hand, weil Roller 50km/h schnell sein können soweit ich weiß. Bei so einer Geschwindigkeit ist eine Helmpflicht durchaus angebracht um Kopfverletzungen präventiv entgegenzuwirken, die bei diesen hohen Geschwindigkeiten durchaus schneller bei einem Sturz auftreten als bei einem Sturz vom Fahrrad bei 25-30 km/h. Klar sollte der Bürger nicht totreguliert werden, aber man kann die Gesellschaft auch nicht komplett ohne Sicherheitsregulierungen vor die Tür lassen. Langfristig hat diese großflächige Grundrechtsbeschneidung in Sachen Helm und Gurtpflicht eher positive als negative Auswirkungen auf das Individuum gehabt.

Aufgrund der Gurtpflicht hört niemand auf Auto zu fahren. Aufgrund einer Helmpflicht hören viele Menschen auf, Fahrrad zu fahren. Das [wies eine australische Wissenschaftlerin nach](http://www.adfc.de/helme/seite-2-argumente-gegen-die-helmpflicht):

&gt;So belegt eine Studie von Dorothy L. Robinson an der University of New England in Armindale (New South Wales), dass im Bundesstaat New South Wales zwar nach Einführung der Helmpflicht der Anteil der Kinder und Jugendlichen unter 16 Jahren, die einen Helm trugen, von 31 Prozent auf 76 Prozent anstieg.

&gt;Im selben Zeitraum nahm die Zahl der Rad fahrenden Kinder jedoch massiv ab: Gegenüber 1991 waren im Jahr 1992 36 Prozent weniger Kinder mit dem Fahrrad unterwegs, im Jahr 1993 betrug der Rückgang im Vergleich zu 1991 sogar schon 44 Prozent. Die Zahl der Kopfverletzungen sank zwar in absoluten Zahlen, zur Zahl der Radfahrer ins Verhältnis gesetzt nahm sie hingegen zu.

&gt;**Radfahren wurde offenbar für die verbliebene Zahl Rad fahrender Kinder gefährlicher.** (Dorothy L. Robinson, AGBU, University of New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia: Head Injuries and Bicycle Helmet Laws, Accident Analysis and Prevention, volume 28, number 4, pages 463 - 75 (1996) in: ADFC Forschungsdienst Fahrrad Nr. 282.)

&gt;Verschiedene Untersuchungen zeigen, dass bei zunehmendem Radverkehr das individuelle Verletzungs- und Todesrisiko abnimmt. Umgekehrt kann man vermuten, dass bei sinkendem Radverkehr das individuelle Risiko steigt.

&gt;

&gt;

&gt;The __Latin Quarter of Paris__ ([French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): *Quartier latin*, IPA: [kaʁtje latɛ̃]) is an area in the [5th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_arrondissement_of_Paris) and the [6th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6th_arrondissement_of_Paris) [arrondissements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Paris) of [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris). It is situated on the [left bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rive_Gauche) of the [Seine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine), around the [Sorbonne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris).

&gt;Known for its student life, lively atmosphere and [bistros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistro), the Latin Quarter is the home to a number of higher education establishments besides the university itself, such as the [École Normale Supérieure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Normale_Sup%C3%A9rieure), the [École des Mines de Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mines_ParisTech), [Panthéon-Assas University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panth%C3%A9on-Assas_University), the [Schola Cantorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schola_Cantorum), and the [Jussieu university campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jussieu_Campus). Other establishments such as the [École Polytechnique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique) have relocated in recent times to more spacious settings.

&gt;The area gets its name from the [Latin language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin), which was once widely spoken in and around the University since Latin was the international language of learning in the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages).

You may find, too, that as you get more familiar with the language, that you will want to increase your study time.  At least, that has been my experience.

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"&gt;Nobody is saying that the there should be no human rights in the UK at all. The UK has a long tradition of rights. The proposal is that the UK enacts its own Bill of Rights

Whilst we advocates of the repealing of the HRA aren't openly in favour of weaker human rights, they are in practice. For instance,  think it is a true triumph in terms of human rights that it took so long for Abu Qatada to be deported. It hadn't been proven beyond all reasonable doubt that he was a terrorist and even if he was a terrorist he does not deserve to be subject to torture (I don't want to live in a society that promotes the idea of 'an eye for an eye'). However, people who are against this and against the HRA in general, advocate for us 'being able to deport anyone *in the name of* ***national interests or safety.***' It's right there in the wording that they are favouring *national* interests over the interests and rights of the individual. We should not be incorrectly punishing people in the name of 'the greater good', and especially not in situations like with Aba Qatada when there were obviously alternative solutions which did not involve deporting him to Lebanon to be tortured. So I favour devolution of power to a European level on this issue because it provides *greater* protection for human rights, where as in the UK a lot of the querks of the system (e.g. lack of a codified constitution) and of public opinion mean that human rights end up being *incredibly weak*. I also think there's a lot to be said for having *the same minimum human rights* over a large area, but that's a different issue and my main advocation is because it makes our rights so much stronger than in the British system alone.

I highly recommend you getting in contac with the Akademisches Auslandsamt (or whatever the International Office at the Uni of your choice is called) as they will know presicely what is relevant.

Heres what i can tell you: 
When you get your Abitur or Allgemeine Hochschulreife in Germany, it will state a certain number of points, wich you accquired over the last 2 years of school. This score is composed of the grades of every course you've taken and your finals. Those points dertermine your average grade, wich is important if your desired Studiengang has a Numerus Clausus/Zulassungsbeschränkung. These restrictions are in place, if the number of people who want to study the university course exceeds the number of available spots the uni can offer. Biology is a course that almost always will have a NC (Numerus Clausus). 
Sadly determining wich averge grade you will get on you Abitur isnt as easy as just adding all of your grades together and taking the average, as some courses are wheighted more than others. [Here's a handy site, for calculating it for all the different Bundesländer](http://www.abitur-und-studium.de/Abirechner.aspx). Grab a dictionary and try putting in your grades. If you need help, you can PM me.

When you found your Uni of choice and have determined your Abiturdurchschnitt for its Bundesland you can check if the course has an NC(örtliche Zulassungsbeschränkung/Orts-NC). If that is the case you can try to look up if the uni has published the NC-Verfahrensergebnisse (the NC for the last semester) via googlesearch ( ""uni name"" NC-Verfahrensergebnisse).

Thats all i got for you, but i highly recommend getting in contact with the uni in addition to this, because I have no idea if there are any differences for foreign students and if there are any, how they might look like.

You said you don't feel safe using Private Trackers with your own IP.. this pre-formatted response is the one I use for the 100's of people that have said the exact same thing (or similar things) in the past (I've probably had this pre-formatted response for 6+ months) :)

&gt; Even still, you admit that you know a few cases where users of private trackers have been targeted.

I know of ~10 cases in the past 10 years.. each was minor.. they are extremely rare at best :)

&gt; You can avoid all this by just using a seedbox where you don't enter any private information during the registration. Why take any chances whatsoever?

The risks are hardly enough risk to use a seedbox.. Anti-Piracy don't target individual users of Private Trackers (or at least, the # of times they have is so small.. it's basically a non-issue)

true,SlyRatchet,UKGB,pies n gravy,"Economic devastation during WWI, as the Western Front of WWI basically only hurt France and the low countries, but not Germany. So by the time WWII rolled around, France had the serious disadvantage of being once already, then dealing with the Great Depression, where as Germany was only dealing with the Great Depression, but not fiscal devastation. Furthermore, Germany combated these problems by stealing the wealth and resources of nearby countries in order to create an effective army. 

There was military incompetence on the side of France, but even if they had properly defended themselves they would have been destroyed by the Germany war machine at most a year later. So the overall result would have been the same even if they were properly prepared. 

So I really don't think it is fair to blame France for being defeated quickly in WWII. The odds were stacked against them from the very start, and they had one of the most impressive grassroots resistance movements in Europe.

I'm not gonna bash America and say 'conversely, America did even less than the French!' America's roll in particularly the European theatre of WWII was quite important. Maybe less so in WWI, but still significant at the very least. The thing is, America did not ""win"" either war and it is disingenuous and borderline offensive to make such claims, *let alone to be making such claims genuinely on a T-shirt*. All the major actors were *vital* to the result happening the way it did. If one had not played their roll (USSR, USA, UK, Germany; UK, France, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary and probably the USA and Italy), things would surely look very different. To claim that one actor 'won' the war is to disregard the part played by the others which is offensive. I know Europeans generally don't take their own nationalism very seriously, and aren't prone to publicly causing a fuss, but that doesn't mean a lot of people will very quietly be *very* disgruntled should such a claim be made by an American whilst in virtually any European country.

It doesn't take a lot of work to learn how to say 'hello, excuse me, thank you, do you speak English, goodbye' in one or two languages. It'll even make it a lot funner if you revisit these languages at a later date to try and learn them more properly. It doesn't matter if you can't actually pronounce them properly, as some languages have sounds not present in English (e.g. the Ü sound in German and French, pronounce by whistling an 'e' sound) but if you make yourself understandable and apparent that you have tried to pronounce them properly will work wonders. 

One last thing. DO keep in mind that some different dialects of the same language use different greetings or phrases for some of the above said phrases.

Bullshit. They wanted their own country - fair enough. Poles did, too. Doesn't change anything. Doesn't make sense to say ""all crimes are equal"".

 &gt; Just answer me a question how come Ukrainian Polish citizens became on different side of barricades?

Because they were persecuted. Nobody denies that. Also wanted their own country. So what? Right now Poles in Lithuania (whiny bunch as they are) complain about being persecuted by Lithuanians. Some of their complains are justified. Do you think they have right to kill a few tousands of Lithuanians? Because some of them certainly feel threathened by Lithuanians.

It's a very dumb rethoric to say any persecution justifies any response.

Find them and look at their website. Somebody mentioned genossenschaften, depending on your area they are hard to get into, though, and more of a long term deal.

What also helps: when you look at a place, try making a genuine comment to the landlord about something you like about the place. The way I got my last apartment was: being the first one to look at it, recognizing that the kitchen was very nice, even had full wooden doors, and saying as much.

We're talking about one of the key tourist destinations in Europe, so obviously there will be a lot of newcomers who aren't going to stick around and ask inane questions already answered in the wiki.

Mandatory military service would be a better option since if everyone was going there would be no stigmatization and stratification. also the average IQ of the soldiers would be close to that of the society and it would be more of a civic institution.

In exchange, Denmark was occupied under very mild terms, compared to other occupied nations, such as the Netherlands.

Nevertheless, the trauma of non-self-determination echoes today, through Danish EU-skepticism and a general distrust of authority.

One silver lining to the occupation is the things it revealed about Danish national character. I'm careful here, because this is also somewhat a myth that we tell ourselves, but nevertheless the common Dane did not in any way agree with the persecution of Jews and other minorities committed by the Nazi regime. Countless nameless civilians stepped up in aiding the escape of persecuted minorities to unoccupied Sweden, from where many moved on to America, by smuggling them on fishing boats. The resistance movement, which many ordinary citizens supported in various ways, provided crucial tactical information to the British Royal Air Force.

1. Be loud, very loud the Europeans are there to serve you, the liberation of Europe means you have the right to be loud and drunk everywhere outside of the war grave sites. 

2. Europeans piss and shit into holes in the ground, so they don't mind you pissing or shitting in the street

3. If you're struggling to get your point across in English, say it again but louder and slower like you're talking to an idiot. Most of the barmen speak English anyway so you don't need to bother learning their dying languages. 

4. If your feeling homesick, you might be able to soften the blow by heading to an English enclave. Benidorm, magaluf, Malta etc were set up so British people wouldn't have to deal with Johnny foreigner, Americans will be welcomed as brothers and only slightly mocked. 

5. Learn who the good Europeans are; the French, Spanish, Italians, Belgians, Croatians, Romanians,French, Bulgarians, Slovaks, Czechs, Greeks, Germans, French, Dutch, Polish and the French are the bad ones. Everyone else is alright chances are that you won't even have to speak loud or slow to them. 

6. If you find yourself in a bad country and frustrated while the world cup is on, hop into a pub and find someone to start a fight with, if you're in a large group start a riot. French targets are easier to pick on and the world cup will mean they're easily identified.

What shocks me the most here is that Roma or not, if you justify beating a kid into a come for theft you are way beyond any developed Western country idea of the rule of law.

In none of our legal systems in the West there is any hint at valuing property more than human beings, their right to a just and fair trial and to a penalty that corresponds to what the law prescribes for their specific crime.

Rape and pedophilia are some of the worst crimes, but if I see people trying to lynch the ALLEGED perpetrator, I believe they should be put in jail too, and fast. Even you could be the one accused, and you could be lynched. I do not want innocent lynched, ever. And not even the guilty, because I believe it is wrong.

This is fairly logical because the EU largely represents left-wing and liberal ideals: rationalistic planning (like quotas), elite-intellectual leadership, bureaucracy, anti-nationalism, secularism, liberal rights like no capital punishment and so on. So this is exactly what is to be expected.

This was interrupted by two months of guarding the austro-hungerian border against illegal immigrants (I never saw any.) It was cold, boring and tiring.
(They've stopped doing that since, after the Schengen enlargement and trying to milk it for votes for another year)

There was also a week long drill at the training ground Allensteig (the one Hitler made out of his birthplace), but for me that just meant hauling lots of office stuff there and back (including two years worth of archive weighing approximately 200 kgs).

That said, the professional soldiers treated the conscripts reasonably well... in my unit and another one I was aware of at least.

true,weather-pan,null,null,"Titolo dell’Ansa di sei giorni fa: «Sì unanime per progetto Qatar su San Raffaele». Nella sinfonia di violini spiccava l'assolo del sindaco di Olbia, Gianni Giovannelli. «La Sardegna può davvero diventare la Silicon Valley della ricerca sanitaria a livello mondiale», dichiarava entusiasta dopo aver incontrato Faisal Bin Thani Al Thani, cognato dello sceicco Kamim Bin Hamad Al Thani. Probabilmente ignorando che nelle stesse ore quell'investimento da 1,2 miliardi di euro della Qatar Foundation stava già traballando.La storia comincia un paio d'anni fa, quando lo sceicco Hamad Bin Kalifa Al Thani, che nel 2013 avrebbe abdicato in favore del figlio trentatreenne, incontra il presidente della Repubblica Giorgio Napolitano insieme all'allora presidente della Regione Sardegna Ugo Cappellacci. 


Ci sono in ballo investimenti turistici in Costa Smeralda, ma sullo sfondo già si profila la sagoma del San Raffaele di Olbia, una specie di ecomostro mai completato che si affaccia sul mare cristallino, lascito del crac della Fondazione di Don Luigi Verzé. Il 3 febbraio scorso, l'annuncio del premier Enrico Letta da Doha: «C'è un importante investimento del Qatar per l'ospedale di Olbia».Grazie al petrolio il piccolo emirato arabo trabocca di denari. Il che gli ha consentito di avviare una politica di massicci investimenti esteri. Ma non compra soltanto pacchetti azionari in borsa o quote di industrie: spende anche un sacco di soldi nel campo sociale, dell'educazione e della sanità. Gli investimenti nella sola ricerca raggiungono il 2,8 per cento del Prodotto interno lordo: 6 miliardi di dollari. 

Nei piani della Qatar Foundation c'è da tempo, per esempio, la creazione di un centro sanitario di eccellenza mondiale. Potevano andare in Germania, ma hanno scelto Olbia. Perché l'abbiano fatto ha forse a che vedere più con i rapporti diplomatici costruiti in questi due anni che con l'esistenza di un abbozzo di ospedale sulla costa sarda. Anche perché i costi di adattamento al progetto che hanno in mente gli arabi non sono certo irrilevanti. Per capirci, si parla di una cifra intorno ai 400 milioni. Sapendo come funziona la burocrazia italiana si potevano prevedere difficoltà soprattutto su quel versante. Mentre invece i primi siluri sono arrivati da un fronte ben diverso. Che il blocco del potere sanitario regionale, dove si cortocircuitano baronie ospedaliere, burocrazia locale e politica, non avesse fatto salti di gioia apprendendo la notizia, era intuibile. Ma non si potevano certo prevedere le proporzioni della controffensiva.

In ballo ci sono: una struttura ospedaliera orientata alla ricerca da 280 posti letto convenzionata con il servizio sanitario, un migliaio di nuovi posti di lavoro per una Regione dove la disoccupazione giovanile viaggia intorno al 50 per cento, un investimento complessivo di 1,2 miliardi nell’arco di un decennio e l'opportunità per le nostre università di accedere ai finanziamenti del fondo sovrano del Qatar. E la trattativa che va avanti da oltre un anno è arrivata a un punto morto. Motivo? L'assessorato regionale alla Sanità della nuova giunta di centrosinistra guidata da Francesco Pigliaru ha posto una serie di veti che gli investitori arabi considerano inaccettabili, sospettando che servano a mettere alcune rendite di posizione al riparo della concorrenza. 

Il primo veto è al reparto di cardiochirurgia, con la motivazione che è già presente in altre città, come Sassari. Il secondo è a quello di neurochirurgia, di cui dispongono gli ospedali di Sassari e Nuoro. Il terzo è alla terapia intensiva. E il quarto è a una decina di posti letto dedicati alla riabilitazione. Il direttore generale dell'assessorato, Giuseppe Maria Sechi, medico ed ex direttore della Asl di Cagliari, sarebbe irremovibile. Con lui anche l'assessore Luigi Arru, ematologo dell'ospedale San Francesco di Nuoro nonché presidente dell’ordine dei medici di Nuoro (incidentalmente fratello del presidente del Banco di Sardegna Antonio Angelo Arru).A pochi giorni dalla scadenza fissata negli accordi per chiudere la partita, ovvero martedì 24 giugno, non si vede una via d'uscita. 

Anche perché la sanità è materia che dipende dalla Regione, e per di più la Sardegna ha uno statuto che le garantisce larga autonomia. Il governo ha dunque in mano l’unica arma (spuntata) della moral suasion. Resta il fatto che se per il 24 giugno la cosa non dovesse risolversi, lo sceicco del Qatar è deciso ad abbandonare l'operazione di Olbia per andare a investire quel miliardo e 200 milioni in un altro Paese europeo. Con ripercussioni che purtroppo non si fermerebbero alla Sardegna. Perché sarebbe molto complicato per il fondo sovrano dell'emirato, dopo un esito del genere, mettere altri soldi in Italia. Per esempio in una grande impresa in difficoltà qual è l'Ilva, come pure era stato ipotizzato.

A questo punto vorremmo sapere se qualcuno ancora si meraviglia perché nessuno viene a investire qui. Nel 2013, dice il Censis, sono entrati in Italia 12,4 miliardi, con un calo del 58 per cento rispetto al 2007. Una cifra pari all'1,6 per cento di tutti gli investimenti esteri mondiali, contro il 2,8 della Spagna, il 4,8 della Francia, il 5,8 della Gran Bretagna. E al Sud, che ne avrebbe un bisogno disperato, non arrivano che le bricioline: il 5 per cento di quell'1,6 per cento, secondo la Confindustria.

They do not like automatically accumulate interest, this is just weird. Capital is not money, where does this weird idea even come from? Money is simply used to buy capital - capital goods like CNC lathe machines - the same way as it is used to buy a sandwich.

It is a sort of a special case when capital goods are bought from money borrowed and thus must pay an interest rate but this is a different story.

Anyway my problem with the article is that I am all for widespread ownership but on an individual, not collective basis, because collective i.e. democratic management is just ineffective, it  does not line up incentives right.

So for example what I would support is looking for ways how small things can be given out to individuals and families and equalize things this way. Example: give council houses to tenants, give land to small farmers, and find a way to make small business more competitive against big business.

Otherwise it is just the old collective nightmare of corruption and tragedy-of-commons problems.

&gt;In a series of cases, Spanish courts have ruled that file sharing for private use is legal. In 2006, the record industry's attempts to criminalize file sharing were thwarted when Judge Paz Aldecoa declared it legal to download indiscriminately in Spain, if done for private use and without any intent to profit,   and the head of the police's technology squad has publicly said ""No pasa nada. Podéis bajar lo que queráis del eMule. Pero no lo vendáis."" (""It's ok. You can download whatever you want with [eMule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMule). But don't sell it."").  There have been demonstrations where the authorities have been informed that copyrighted material would be downloaded in a public place, the last of which took place on 20 December 2008.  No legal action was taken against the protestors.      In another decision from May 2009,  a judge ruled in favor of a person engaged in the private, non-commercial file-sharing of thousands of movies, even though the copying was done without the consent of the copyright owners.

true,avataRJ,FINL,Finland,"Still a touchy subject in Finland. In general, the military was trying to reform even the decade ago, but the old ""Prussian"" habits do not die fast, including bullying (despite the hard stance officially against it). One way the service can be useful is that for units needing lots of drivers, if you had a driver's license, you could receive some extra training from the army, and provided you had the required quota of practice and then completed the red tape, you could upgrade your civilian license, i.e. from B/passenger car license to BC/passenger cars and trucks, or from BC to BECE/with heavy trailers. (But not from B to BECE.)

The typical propaganda also mentions learning life skills (well, technically everyone gets some first aid training), improving physical fitness (this is mostly true) and for some cases, being the first time some people are separated from their mothers. (There are legends of people who were taught in the army how to tie their shoelaces. While the common uniform is fatigues, for special occasions the proper uniform can be requested. To wear the uniform properly, you need to use a tie. Apparently tying a tie is harder than it looks.)

And then the fact that everyone gets dumped in the same place, some of them selected for leadership (leadership types, more skilled, and then the quota gets filled by some insane troll logic) and this results in a very interesting psychological experiment.

Of course, the other opinion is that it wastes a year from young men's life that'd be better spent studying. Or the fact that in order to keep the trained reserve in a fighting condition, they'd need to be regularly called back. (I've had... um, two days of refresher training during the last decade. At this point, my memory of how to operate the squad radio approaches the level of the retiring first sergeant we had during basic training: (1) Don't hit it with a hammer, (2) Don't throw it in a lake.)

The actual experience on the service varies wildly depending on various factors, including the unit, instructors and conscript leaders. There's always a few conscript NCOs who let the chevrons to get to their heads. The old staff NCOs also used a very strong ""drill sergeant"" stereotype. And then there's people who've been introduced to each other in the army and stay as friends. Due to timing, there's this one sports event and a military exercise arranged the same time. Used to meet my old instructor (good guy) at the gas station when coming back with a team. (By chance, but several years in a row.) Especially if you were selected to the Reserve Officer School (which trains all the conscripts who are to become platoon leaders, one place for the entire country) and considered to be skilled/good guy there, you could get valuable contacts.

&gt;There is every reason to phase out nuclear after fossil fuels, not before.

The problem is that you often hear ""we'll just build more nuclear plants and it'll be business as usual"". There's only so much you can get done in politics, and it wouldn't make sense to campaign in favor of nuclear until all fossils are replaced and then turn around 180° and start to campaign to replace the brand new nuclear plants with renewables. So we need to get it right from the first time. This is especially urgent when funds are alotted: renewables and nuclear often are competitors for the same budget.

Mais l'idéal (et le plus sûr) c'est d'y aller avec un connaisseur, les galeries se ressemblent vraiment beaucoup, et les repères y ont souvent disparu.

Je confirme car c'est comme ça que j'y suis allé. On y est allé avec un pote, on ne connaissait personne dans le milieu mais on avait une carte et on connaissait l'emplacement de la plus grosse entrée. On est partis équipés sans savoir à quoi s'attendre (comme la corde d'escalade en témoignait) mais avec bottes, plein de lampes/bougies, boussoles, casque, téléphones chargés et un commun accord de rebrousser chemin si on trouve que la carte ne correspondait plus.

Dés l'entrée, on est partis du mauvais côté. On a avancé à genoux dans une galerie bien humide alors que 10 m plus loin une galerie parallèle permettait de marcher debout. Au deuxième embranchement on croise un groupe.

""Touriste ?""

""Heu.... oui. Ça se voit ?""

""Ben vu d'où vous sortez oui, allez venez.""

Sans eux, je pense qu'on partait pour une nuit de grosse galère. Ceci dit après une seule sortie guidée, les repères sont très faciles à prendre. Il y a un grand axe à repérer, une porte métallique bien reconnaissable, et c'est assez dur de se perdre. 

Dés la deuxième sortie on pouvait prétendre un peu plus savoir où on allait et on partait en exploration, mais d'une façon beaucoup plus confiante. 

Deux conseils si vous allez dans les catas: 

1. Gérez vos ordures! On est pas dans la nature, il n'y a pas d'écosystème qui fera disparaître votre pisse ou vos trognons. Les déchets les plus acceptables sont ceux qui ne pourrissent pas (et donc peuvent être ramassés facilement même 3 semaines plus tard). Mais pas d'excuses: ayez des sacs et sortez vos ordures **et même quelques unes qui ne sont pas de vous**. Les services de la voirie, c'est vous. Et si vous croisez les flics, ils peuvent être indulgents s'ils voient que vous jouez les éboueurs.

I think this is something that historians can argue about. Personally I don't think the fall of the Berlin Wall was really a big driver towards a deeper Europe. It was definitely a driver to a wider Europe though.

&gt; Of course, in Maastricht the UK decided they'd rather be in than out, not only for economic reasons, but also because they couldn't afford to lose influence on what was probably going to be an emerging power. Was that a mistake? That's for the Brits to decide, but it definitely made sense at the moment (and IMHO still does, because Juncker is what happens when the UK steps back from Europe).

However, Maastricht, by staying out of the single currency, inevitably did mean that the UK lost influence in the EU, in exchange for maintaining control of monetary policy and eventually also economic policy more broadly. Were we right to do this? In my opinion we certainly were.

true,Lazin,DENK,Denmark,"**tl;dr: I don't know how it is to be a conscript, but here are some info about conscription in Denmark.**

I hope a Dane that have actually been a conscript comes along *because I haven't*, but I can still tell a bit about what I think is the general opinion and how the selection process works.

**Who are the conscripts**

It's mandatory for all 18 year old men to go to be checked (this also works great for checking male population general health which is good), however if you're under education and the time they give you does not fit well with exams, you can postpone it. Say you have a time in late May or in June and it's around your exams you simply ask them to give you a new time. It is a gender issue debate that rises every now and again that it's only mandatory for men, though I think the ministry of Defense also sends out invitations to all women when they turn 18 now. They're at least invited to come, but how actively they have to seek it out, I don't know.

**Examination process**

After some 30 minutes light propaganda video, you take something a bit like an IQ test (maths and logic test), and then a 13 question yes/no ""psych evaluation"" with questions like ""Do you like working together with others?"" ""Do you responds well  to authority?"". After these are collected you sit around and wait till one by one, you're taking through a physical check. Hearing, vision, weight/height and then a short consultation with a doctor. During the consultation you might be asked to touch your toes. It used to be that the doctor will cup your groin and ask you to cough, a practice that have been discontinued (it's basically to check for hernias). 

Now after this I remember it as (after some more waiting) you go to a last person who then looks over all your results who will then 99%(exaggeration) of the time declare you're ""for service"". The other 2 options are ""partially fit for service"" and ""not fit for service"".

I'm pretty sure almost all are fit for service unless they have severe chronic illnesses (physical or psychological) that there personal physician can vouch for, minor stuff like bad hearing, vision and fitness is not enough to declare you even partial unfit for service. The main reason is probably be because:

Conscripts cannot be send into war. I think in-case of an invasion on Danish soil they could be pulled in, but never under any circumstance be send out of the country. 

**Who are drafted**

Anyway let us say you have passed the almost non existing criteria, you then take a ticket, like a lottery number ticket. Low number means you're drafted. Medium number means you might be needed. And high number means you're not needed. What is a low, medium and high number depends, as far as I know mainly on: The number of volunteers which make up the most of the conscripts, and on political decisions on how many conscripts are wanted. When I got called low numbers were 1-4000 medium 4000-6000 (I think, possibly 8000) 8000+ (it goes up in to the high 20.000 at least). Basically most get a high ""free"" number. I think it's rare for the medium numbers to get called, though this is again on personal anecdotes from people I know who got medium numbers.

**If you're drafted**

Now even *if* you get a low number, you can declare yourself ""militærnægter"" conscientious objector, in which case you will be paid less than if you were a conscript, and put to do civil service work. My brother got to work with kids as he wanted to, so I think they take into account what kind of work you would like to do, you're not just put to work picking up trash.

From what I've been told by friends who have been conscripted, its mainly marching and excise, team work, some practical skills and little fighting/gun training.

However we also have several different branches you can be in, the most common they told us about were: 

* Army basic training (4 months)
* Navy basic training (4 months)
* Air force basic training (4 months)
* Emergency agency (""Beredskabstyrelsen"") (9 months)

The three first being your standard military training, while the last is sometimes (a bit mockingly) called ""weekend firemen"" since they learn some basics of first aid, firemen training, drivers license for truck (so they could drive a firetruck) and the like, no fighting training involved.

However there are several other ways to serve:

* Royal Guard (8 months and higher restrictions/demands)
* Guard Huzzar regiment (12 months)
* Foreign Aid in developing countries (4-12 months)
* Conscientious objector / civil society work (4-12 months) [though usually 4-6 months]

I think many people thinks it's a bit outdated, but that it's good that people are taught some skills and are put to work if you don't know what else you wanna do, since most people around that age are just finishing their secondary/youth education in Denmark. So it's okay, and a tradition, but if what we really get out of it, is like a forced civil service in 4-12 months of people ages 18-19 then why should it only be mandatory for men? However since you can never be sent to any actual combat, and can always avoid it by doing some more menial civil work for just 4 months, and even that is still paid, it's all paid, there really isn't that much of an objection towards it.

Not so big, really. Merkel has built her whole political persona in Germany as the Woman Who Gets Things Done. A merely perfunctory effort to support Juncker will not cut it with the electorate, especially now that she has openly pledged her support.

Don't overestimate the lengths to which she will go to keep Cameron happy, either. On most issues, the splits in the Council are not North/South or Latins/Nordics. Merkel is certainly closer to Spain's Mariano Rajoy than she is to Cameron. While she may agree with Cameron on, say, trade, they sing from very different choirbooks when it comes to, say, tax harmonisation.

&gt; she can get what she wants without pissing off the public and her coalition partner.

Her coalition partner? Juncker is a Christian Democrat, just as Merkel herself. And that's also a key element: the Christian Democrat alliance in the EU, the European People's Party, is already frayed enough without Merkel dropping and humiliating their candidate for president of the Commission. If Merkel fails to stand for Juncker, the leaders of other sister parties will take notice that Merkel is unreliable, and they'll start looking for alternative allies, like Cameron himself.
