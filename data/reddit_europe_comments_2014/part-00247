&gt;**4. Traces of nano-thermite in the dust collected from the scene.**

&gt;This claim is mostly due to a paper that has been thoroughly debunked.  [This site](http://willyloman.wordpress.com/2009/08/23/more-bad-science-surrounding-the-nano-thermite-red-herring/) does a good (albeit somewhat scientific) explanation, but of particular note is:

&gt;&gt; For the most part there is a a great deal of proof out there that the “red/grey chips” that Jones et al based their paper on, are in fact a rust inhibiting primer paint with a Kaolinite base.

&gt;The site goes on to explain the many ways that the paper was wrong, how many of the people involved with even letting it be published have resigned in protest/disgrace, and how there has been no independent testing done.

&gt;In effect, they basically used connections to sneak a paper in a journal based on faulty science, and then use the fact that it was published as truth.  

&gt;In reality, the material they identified was not actually nano-thermite, the smoke/debris cloud was the wrong look/color for a nano-thermite burn, and it is highly unlikely that it is even possible for nano-thermite to cut through a large beam even if it was attempted.

Btw, wie haben die eigentlich unbemerkt die notwendigerweise übergroßen Schneidvorrichtungen fürs Thermit an die Stahlstützen angebracht? In Chemie haste de Thermitversuch ja mal gesehen, oder? Ich nämlich dreimal. Glaub mir, das wären (-&gt;zu) fette Apparate gewesen, um die Stützen durchzubekommen ;)

true,recreational,UNSA,United States of America,"Where did I get ""basically unrelated to the Greeks""? From the Ancient Greeks, who considered and describe the Macedonians, prior to Phillip II, as non-Greek speaking barbarians. Who barred any Macedonians other than the royal family from participating in the Olympics. The Macedonians certainly saw themselves as being culturally related- that they shared religious elements is almost certainly true, for instance, but we really have no idea to what extent the religions overlapped- but the Attican Greeks themselves certainly did not see the Macedonians as kin. It's certainly a lie to say that they shared the same language and a wild guess to say that their cultures were significantly similar in most of the other respects you speak of, before the reigns of Phillip II and Alexander III.

Alexander III burned down Persepolis, not Babylon, which, just, wow holy fuck does that undermine your credibility. And yes, that was given as a reason under the official biography by Callisthenes for the burning. It also is generally regarded by historians as marking the end of the period in which Alexander saw a use for the pan-Hellenistic propaganda he had been employing and began weening the Greeks out of his forces (more than he already had,) turning Greece under Antipater's regency into just another satrap in his new tri-continental empire. He had an interest in Greek culture, certainly- but the same is true of Egyptian and Persian culture, and in fact he got in quite a lot of trouble with some more Hellenistic-sympathizing members of his army over adoption of more foreign customs. Callisthenes himself did not last very long after questioning the adoption of Persian ceremonial customs.

And no, you are quite right, there was no Macedonian ethnic group by the time of Byzantine rule. But then, there wasn't really a significant Greek ethnic group either. Greece was cultural post-Alexander, not ethnic. At one point Egyptians, Syrians, Jews, Albanians, Scythians, Bulgarians, whoever were all ""Greek."" This was really true from the time of the Hellenistic kingdoms through to the Byzantine era and the downfall of Constantinople.

Even early resistance against Ottoman rule wasn't attempting to rally ""Greeks"" but ""Romans,"" i.e., Christians. It wasn't until the late 18th/early 19th century when the Greek identity was vigorously reasserted/recreated, primarily, honestly, to pump Western European romantics like Lord Byron of their money and lives in support of some fanciful notion of Classical Greece reborn or whatever. The Macedonian identity, in a modern sense, began somewhat later, near the tail end of the 19th century, which is about when most nationalist identities really were being forged- Macedonians don't trail the Italians or Irish by so much, ultimately, and are about co-current with the Palestinians, for instance.

Anyway, I'm not Bulgarian. It's pretty shitty of you to assume I am in fact. As you can see from my tag I'm also American and the history I study is mostly published here or in the UK, not in Skopje. I would suggest that it is you that are the victim of Greek Nationalist propaganda, the same kind that's been pumped out of Athens for the past two hundred years in a sad and desperate attempt to keep a monopoly in the legacy of thousands of years of Greco history and culture that takes place almost entirely outside of the borders of modern-day Greece and by people who were primarily not ethnically Greek.",0,1408828723,null,0,false,0,cjylqtn,t3_2ed1s5,t1_cjylqtn,t1_cjykzzo,null,1427390785,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

true,costan1,null,null,"Siciliano che ha vissuto 15 anni a Milano e adesso da 5 a Roma. Ho girato molte cittá straniere, europee e non.
BOcciata senza speranze.
Milano non sará metropolitana come Roma, ma di metropoli Roma ha solo i difetti.
Se elimini il più grande museo a cielo aperto che é la parte archeologica, quello che resta é solo sciatta piattezza e inefficienza pura, condita da avvolemose bene e furberie a scapito del prossimo.

In 5 anni qui sono passato dall'amare la cittá che il turista di passaggio vede all'odiare qualsiasi manifestazione romana.

Brevi esempi:

- gastronomia, la peggiore del lazio, la peggior pizza d'italia al prezzo piú alto, le ricette tipiche sono rubate ad altre regioni, insulse o assolutamente incommestibili

- traffico/gestione logistica non ne parliamo nemmeno, certo Milano é più piccola, ma Parigi no, e andate a vedere le differenze. Le dimensioni non contano, perché chi gestisce i trasporti a Roma avrebbe problemi anche con la cittá di barbie, perché il suo interesse non é il servizio ma le poltrone

- gente mediamente arraffona come il peggior truffatore del sud, con la faccia tosta del politico di turno ed il fare ammiccante dell'amicone del cugino del vicino di casa. t'inc***no e ti continuano a dire che ti stanno a fare un favore. quelli che non sono cosí disonesti, mediamente sono inaffidabili. l'appuntamento per un romano non esiste, sono tutti ""mezzi i mpegni"" dimenticabili, cancellabili senza preavviso e bucabili a piacere. Cercate di farvi dare un'orario preciso da un romano per vedervi. IMPOSSIBILE. Il traffico, direte voi, no, abita di fronte a casa vostra ma la sua risposta sará sempre ""dai ti chiamo quando sto per arrivare, facciamo per le 6-7"" e poi so presenta alle 9 meno un quarto.

- clima Milano fredda? avete mai provato ad abitare a Roma? i riscaldamenti sono sempre insufficenti, accendono tardi perché c'é quella minchia di ottobrata romana, l'impianto é vecchio, il palazzo pure e gli infissi hanno fatto le guerre puniche. risultato a Milano entri in casa e ti metti in bermuda, fuori 0 gradi dentro 22, a Roma fuori 8 gradi ma grazie al vento hai le visioni del rifugio di montagna e dentro casa ne hai 7 e a volte anche lo stesso vento di fuori.

- costi a Roma tutto é piú caro, ma gli immobili sono davvero la ciliegina sulla torta... e nonostante la crisi i prezzi sono ancora incrostati a cifre imbarazzanti, il mercato dovrebbe essere saturo, ma grazie ad orde di nababbi (probabilmente evasori) che fanno l'investimento a roma (leggasi riciclano denaro)  il mercato é ancora relativamente stabile, con il risultato che tutto costa caro in ogni luogo della cittá vivibile o semplicemente dove non rischi la vita a vivere.

- offerta di servizi da dimenticare.. a Roma c'é tutto, dicono, ma non ti dicono che per usufruirne devi avere l'amico che ci lavora dentro.. troppa gente, troppa gentaglia e troppi amici da far passare prima. anche la coda alla posta sembra l'ingresso del privé del billionarie, se non conosci devi restare fuori ad aspettare un turno che non sai se e quando arriverá.
il successo di un servizio non significa mai che sono attrezzati per farlo, ma solo che aspettarai di piú e piú scomodamente.

- il mare piú brutto di tutta la costa italiana, persino la romagna é meglio.
ammetto di non aver visto tutto il litorale, ma quel che ho visto non é degno neanche di avere questo nome. ho visto le spiaggie di tutta italia (eccetto la sardegna) ma a parte mestre e la laguna di venezia non riesco ad immaginare posto peggiore per fare il bagno o anche solo una passeggiata sul bagnasciuga (ammesso che uno lo trovi fra le migliaia di cafoni che l'affollando da giugno a settembre).

The quote from Athenian statesmen that Makedons were ""barbarians"" was  in his point of view correct as the Makedon culture of War was barbaric to the Athenian way of life which he wanted to keep. 

Most of the NOrthern Greek City-states joined Makedon immediately after Philip organized his army. 

Greek ethnicity has always been based on Mainland Greece, Greek culture was ""exported"" by the Millions of Greeks who traveled to different countries spreading Greek culture such as Egypt and Syria. When Islamic Empire took over these countries they stopped being Greek. When Islamic Empire took over Greece, Greek people/customs still existed but just under a foreign power. 

I like you try to say that Greece was ""invented"" just like FYROM, like Greek people just woke up one day in 1800 because a Brit told them too fight or something! Greek culture/Ethnicity for the last 1,000 years centered around Greek Orthodoxy. When the Ottomans came, the Orthodox church became the only entity in Greece that preserved Greek culture/language so they became the essential aspect of every Greek's life and this has only settled downa bit in the last 20 years. 

The Greek people did not ""build"" an identity leading up or after independence war or invent one like FYROM'ians. The Greek people lived in isolated enclaves around Greece which centered around the local Greek Orthodox Church. THey had no money, power, weapons or anything really until Byron came and helped the Greeks.  When there was a way to gain freedom they took it, not because of an invented identity. Greeks only wanted freedom of religion which is all they ever wanted. 

""Classical Greek"" has only been very recently in the last 30-40 years explored by Modern Greeks as a way to boost tourism. Before/After independence War, the only identity Greeks had was Greek Orthodoxy, and this is because being Greek Orthodox was the only way you could prove you were 100% Greek, as Turks were not allowed to convert to Orthodoxy. Over 1-2 Million Greeks who converted to Islam to gain the Ottomans favor were purged from Greece soon after the Independence War . . .no ""romantic"" bullshit like you claim . . it was alot of Sectarianism and racism.

I was talking more about Russian military ambitions in South America. In terms of warfare, particularly open warfare against between nations on the American continents, the US is the ultimate arbiter. Russia would face the same dilemma the US currently struggles with in Ukraine namely the ability to move troops into the arena faster and resupply them. Sure the US could do a fast intervention in Ukraine leveraging the advance global logistics network at its disposal but it would be expensive, and I'm not sure Russia could leverage such a system to even get to Ecuador in time. Ultimately, since the 1990s, very few South American nations have gone to war against each other. American hegemony in the area has left a stable, albeit uneasy order of nations.  So, does the US have the right to defend its interests in South America? I guess to the extent that it doesn't create broader chaos in the region. It is in the US interests (and frankly the regions interests) to keep nations in the arena from going to war with each other. In that sense, to keep the region from breaking down, the US has latitude to step in between nations and to ensure (possibly coercively) that the conflict doesn't continue to escalate into full blown warfare.",0,1408831323,null,0,1408831524,0,cjymred,t3_2edawu,t1_cjymred,t1_cjylyig,null,1427390311,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I keep seeing this sentiment throughout the thread of distancing Europe from the US, leaving NATO, ""standing on our own feet"", etc. Yet actions speak louder than words and fact is most of Europe has neglected their military forces for decades. Fact is supporting yourself militarily costs money and isn't achievable overnight and almost all of NATO has been perfectly happy to laugh off preparedness for decades due to the umbrella protection of our alliance.

I keep seeing talk of a European or EU alliance thrown around. Who is going to pay for that and who is going to supply the troops/munitions if it becomes necessary to use it? If I were a Frenchman or a Brit I would be seriously wary of becoming to that force what the US is for NATO, the provider of a more or less free ride.

* ING also estimates that the ban could jeopardise 130,000 jobs at a time when the EU is struggling to reduce a high unemployment rate.

* But if the EU’s sluggish economy is ill-prepared for a prolonged trade war, Russia is in even weaker shape to cope.

* Since the start of the year foreign investors have withdrawn around €60 billion from Russia.

true,recreational,UNSA,United States of America,"&gt; You confuse Ancient Greek with Ancient Athenian, they are not the same thing. LIke I said, Athenians viewed themselves as a completely different race/culture to all other Greeks be it Thebans, Spartans or Makedons.

This simply isn't true. The Athenians considered those in Corinth, Sparta, etc., even to some extent Thebes as being Greeks; the Athenians founded and led multiple pan-Hellenistic Leagues in which the Greek identity of those other places was recognized.

And the Athenians didn't control who was admitted to the Olympic Games, which were also based around the Classical Period idea of Greek identity, from which non-Royal Macedonians were excluded.

&gt; The quote from Athenian statesmen that Makedons were ""barbarians"" was in his point of view correct as the Makedon culture of War was barbaric to the Athenian way of life which he wanted to keep.

This is *not* what Ancient Greeks meant by ""barbaric""; it was a term explicitly denoting a foreign, non-Greek (and therefore inferior) status.

Also I don't know what you mean by ""culture of war,"" it's not a culture of war that Athens or any other Greeks objected to.

&gt; Greek ethnicity has always been based on Mainland Greece, Greek culture was ""exported"" by the Millions of Greeks who traveled to different countries spreading Greek culture such as Egypt and Syria. When Islamic Empire took over these countries they stopped being Greek. When Islamic Empire took over Greece, Greek people/customs still existed but just under a foreign power.

Well, no, Greek culture originated in the islands and then was spread around the Agean, including coastal Anatolia. Large parts of the interior Balkan/Attican peninsula, including territory of modern-day Greece, wasn't really regarded as Greek. Epirus, Thrace, etc..

Anyway, a new Hellenistic culture based on the Koine Greek language spread throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, Mesopotamia and Persia during the Macedonian Conquests. It's another anachronism, although one very much supported by Greek nationalist mythology, to view this as simply ""spreading Greek culture"" though. The Hellenistic culture was new and synthetic. Intertwined for a few centuries with Italian/Latin Rome, then carried on for a thousand years under the Byzantines. In retreat before the Arabization of the Muslim conquests, yes, but that doesn't change the nature of the culture that existed, which was still multicultural, from a Greco-base, which was more Hellenistic than Classical, fused with its own Orthodox Christian worldview of course, and a very different creature from the culture of Ancient Greece.

As I noted elsewhere, for the first few centuries of Ottoman rule, it was ""Roman"" and not ""Greek"" culture that the many Christian ethnic groups in the Balkans and Anatolia saw themselves as preserving, even though this was a Greek- and not Latin-speaking culture. It was only in the tail end of the 18th and early 19th centuries that the modern-day conception of Greek nationalism, based on a reconstruction of Ancient Greek culture and kind of hand-waiving all the stuff between, was forged.

Of course, nation building is not invented by people just waking up and deciding to be a thing, but that's true of every nation, whether Greeks, Macedonians, Irish, Italians, Germans, Palestinians, Kurds, Turks, whatever. There is an organic process of myth-making, a cultural conversation about real and symbolic history, that forges national identity. 

But this very much included the appeal to a Western European romance with Classical Greece (tied in to some extent with Republic-era Rome) which created the funding you agree was central to Greece's independence from the Ottomans.

As for most of Greek history outside of Greek borders; I am referring to the history of the Hellenistic Kingdoms, from roughly 320-50 BCE; the Eastern Roman Empire, and then what we now call the Byzantine Empire in its various phases, up until the final collapse, a stretch of almost two thousand years in which variations of Greek were the primary language of the Eastern Mediterranean in a multi-ethnic mix that contributed far more to world history than the couple centuries of Classical, xenophobic Greece.",0,1408832143,null,0,false,0,cjyn3ga,t3_2ed1s5,t1_cjyn3ga,t1_cjymmbw,null,1427390154,-2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-2

true,neutrolgreek,GREE,G.P.R.H Glorious People's Republic of Hellas,"The Greek leagues were formed before Makedon's rise to power. You need to understand that the Makedon's rise to power was SWIFT, think of Hitler's rise to power which took 10-15 years, along those lines. 

Philip learned how to defeat the Spartans in battle, something thought impossible for hundreds of years. He used this knowledge to build his own personal army in his Greek homeland. All the Greek city-states joined Makedon to form the Aechean Hellenic League . . which you somehow forgot?

Philip's rise to power started in the Oracle of Delphi, a place only allowed to Greeks ONLY. He asked the oracle how to gain power and the oracle responsed by saying something along the lines of taking control of Silver weapons. 

Philip then proceeded to capture all the Silver Mines in NOrthern Greece and used this wealth to form an alliance with all the nearby Greek cities against Athens, the last remaning super-power of Greece since Sparta has shattered after the loss against Thebes. 

Now lets talk AFTER Alexanders death, shall we?

The period of Alexanders death to the Fall of Makedon in 148 BC is known as the Hellenic Age. The Makedon royalty formed the Aechean League which was an alliance of all Free Greeks against the Romans in the Four Roman Wars, the Fourth being the defeat at Makedon in 148 BC. 

Makedons, Spartans, Thebans, Athenians, etc every Greek city-state . . CEASED TO EXIST in 148 BC. The next few hundred years saw the birth of the New Greek which was not based on City-State ""purity"" like the SPartans, Athenians, Makedons were obsessed with but instead a ethnic Greek person with no City-State affilliation like their ancestors. 

Now do you understand why I get angry with FYROM people who claim they are 110% Pure Makedons? Something that ceased to exist in 148 BC! 

By 400 AD when Rome fell, the idea of a ""Pure"" Makedon or Spartan would be considered lunacy to Greek people. These new Greeks that formed the power-base of the Byzantine Empire came from across Mainland/Island Greece and were not so racist against each other like in Ancient times were a SPartan and Athenian would kill each other on sight. 

Also this whole idea that Greeks viewed themselves as ""ROman"" is non-sense. The Greek aristocracy in Byzantine Era absolutely viewed themselves as Roman but the common Greek villager did not. They viewed Romans as Heretics for following a different CHristian religion, this is when the Greek identity became intertwined with Greek Orthodoxy and to this very day is the core trait of Greek identity. 

Only in very recent decades has the discovery of Ancient Greek wonders really taken hold of the Modern greeks imagination, and we can finally let go of intense Religious belief with a new identity",0,1408833219,null,0,false,0,cjynj0g,t3_2ed1s5,t1_cjynj0g,t1_cjyn3ga,null,1427389954,4,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,4

Russia just invaded and annexed territory, what are you smoking? Of course Estonia who is 25% Russian is jumpy. It would be stupid not to be. 

And all that money spend on military is so that nobody would ever try to start a war with a NATO member, it has led to 60 years of peace at home. Ukraine downsized its military(because who the hell is going to attack Ukraine? ""We are surrounded by friendly states on all sides, lucky us"") and tried to be friendly with both Russia and the West. That didn't turn out well for them. 8 months ago it was unimaginable that Russians would be fighting Ukrainians.

And the ""Red Menace"" was real, just ask any Central/Eastern European how much they enjoyed their Soviet overlords, they didn't ask for it and I sure am glad that the US and UK got to Denmark before the Soviets did and afterwards were willing to provide protection instead of just letting us hang.

Dude, what? You literally don't have any idea what you're talking about.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leuctra

Phillip II did develop the most formidable army in the ancient world, which is how his son, Alexander, conquered most of the known world. But it had nothing to do with Sparta being some mystically unstoppable force, Spartan power was broken by the time of the Macedonian conquest of Greece. Fuck, Sparta was intentionally kept out of the pan-Hellenistic crusade Alexander cobbled together for propaganda purposes. The captured Persian armor he sent back to Athens was inscribed ""Defeated by Alexander and all the Greek City-States except for Sparta"" or something to the effect, iirc.

&gt; All the Greek city-states joined Makedon to form the Aechean Hellenic League . . which you somehow forgot?

I don't know what you're referring to here. Phillip was made Archon of Thessaly, and Alexander was Hegemon of Greece as part of the crusade against Persia. There's no one arguing that the Macedonians didn't use the Greeks militarily for a time. But Alexander was also Pharaoh of Egypt and the King of Kings of Persia. And by all accounts those were more important titles to him. The Macedonians appreciated Greek culture but did not seem to be wedded in any patriotic sense to Greece.

&gt; Philip's rise to power started in the Oracle of Delphi, a place only allowed to Greeks ONLY. He asked the oracle how to gain power and the oracle responsed by saying something along the lines of taking control of Silver weapons.

Wow, you're just going in circles. We went over this; the ruling dynasty of Macedonia was recognized as Greek, but only the ruling dynasty. Regular Macedonians were not considered Greek.

&gt; Philip then proceeded to capture all the Silver Mines in NOrthern Greece and used this wealth to form an alliance with all the nearby Greek cities against Athens, the last remaning super-power of Greece since Sparta has shattered after the loss against Thebes.

Gold. Also it was an Athenian-Theban alliance. Wait, you knew Thebes had broken Sparta but you still thought that Sparta was unbeatable, do you actually think these things through?

&gt; The period of Alexanders death to the Fall of Makedon in 148 BC is known as the Hellenic Age. The Makedon royalty formed the Aechean League which was an alliance of all Free Greeks against the Romans in the Four Roman Wars, the Fourth being the defeat at Makedon in 148 BC.

For most of the Hellenistic period Greece was just ruled by Macedonian elites the same as the other successor kingdoms, like Ptolemaic Egypt. I don't know what you think ""all Free Greeks"" means, but unless it means, ""Greeks who live in the Peloponnese only"" it wasn't that.

&gt; Makedons, Spartans, Thebans, Athenians, etc every Greek city-state . . CEASED TO EXIST in 148 BC. The next few hundred years saw the birth of the New Greek which was not based on City-State ""purity"" like the SPartans, Athenians, Makedons were obsessed with but instead a ethnic Greek person with no City-State affilliation like their ancestors.

Macedonians weren't obsessed with city-states, that's part of what made them non-Greek, ""Barbaric.""

As for ethnicity, no, that was not a factor. We actually have records of lots of Egyptian elites being given the tax-preferable ""Greek"" status for instance. They spoke Greek and had both Greek and Egyptian names. Greek identity became very fluid around this point.

&gt; Now do you understand why I get angry with FYROM people who claim they are 110% Pure Makedons? Something that ceased to exist in 148 BC!

No Macedonians I'm aware of assert this, it is a fiction you have made up to get angry with.

&gt; By 400 AD when Rome fell

Okay this chronology is pretty wrong but I think you mean ""When the Western Roman Empire fell."" You can *pretend* that ""new Greeks"" ruled the Byzantine empire but you're going to have to ignore pretty much all of Byzantine history to do that. The Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire considered itself Roman through and through, every citizen, whether, Greek, Bulgarian, Slavic, Thracian, Armenian, Syrian, Egyptian, whatever. Hell that's why Justinian tried to reconquered most of the Mediterranean, and briefly succeeded.

&gt; The Greek aristocracy in Byzantine Era absolutely viewed themselves as Roman but the common Greek villager did not.

This is based on what? Constantinople certainly saw itself as Roman and there were no nationalist revolts of note from the Attican peripherary. 

&gt; They viewed Romans as Heretics for following a different CHristian religion, this is when the Greek identity became intertwined with Greek Orthodoxy and to this very day is the core trait of Greek identity.

Dude the Catholic/Orthodox Schism isn't until 1054.

And sure, it's a core tenet of modern Greek Nationalist identity. That's part of how you can tell that it's a reconstruction based only in part on Classical Greek culture which was notably *not* Christian.

&gt; we can finally let go of intense Religious belief with a new identity

So the Greeks get to define themselves based on their history up until the modern day, but Macedonians don't, I guess.

I have never heard anyone arguing that individuals instigating violence should be extent from the law due to belonging to a minority, either. I bet most proponents of multiculturalism would agree with the opposite, actually: everybody should be treated the same no matter their cultural background, so if the law stipulates that an offense (i.e. murder) should be met with a consequence (i.e. prison, or expulsion), that shouldn't change regardless of the person's background or beliefs.

Migration policy is mostly out of the reach of multiculturalism, too (as the latter focuses on cultural divides within the already present population), but I think that it's more difficult than it seems to assess if a person poses a danger to society (again, whatever they name their beliefs, as most backgrounds have both violent and peaceful individuals in them).

Makedons spoke Greek, followed Greek religion, culture, art, warfare technique, heroes, mythology, Oracle of Delphi pilgrimage, Olympic Games, etcx1000 everything to be Greek. 

It does not matter what some Athenian Statesmen though of them, Remember you and FYROM's entire argument that ""Greeks did not view Makedons as Greeks"" is based on a single line spoken by an enemy of Makedon and Athenian Statesman/Ultra-Nationalist. 

Makedons viewed THEMSELVES AS GREEKS, do you not understand that or are you just being thick-headed? Are you going to argue with me now how ""huur makedons did not view themselves as Greek!"" . . They didnt speak Athenian Greek(but they did a Greek dialect) . . and other non-sense?

Get this through your thick head Alexandroski, The Macedonians did not give a fuck what the Athenians thought of them . . the Makedons viewed themselves as Greeks and proved it by creating the Hellenic Age single-handedly, something not even the Athenians could accomplish. 

After Alexander's death and the formation of the Aechean League, the Makedons were not only Greek, but the Supreme Greek leaders. Thessaloniki became incredibly wealthy and Greek culture centered around Makedon. The Macedonians merged with all the other Greeks after the fall of Makedon in 148 BC and the fall of Free Greece to Rome. 

A Macedonian minority NEVER existed, the Greeks became a single people, letting go of their City-State form of ethnic ties. 

Also can you please stop saying Ancient Macedonians did not speak Greek? Did you miss the last time I proved you wrong or are you just avoiding facts and sticking to FYROM talking points?

A more comparable example would be the treatment of the native population in FYROM the Albanians from the Slavic invaders. In the year 2001 Albanians were forced in an armed confict just for the human right to speak their own language in public without getting shot by the police and have the right to teach their children their own language. But their rights were not respected.  After NATO intervention only had the right to teach their children and use their language in public services only where they still remain the majority. Yet the position of the prime minister and president is held unequally to the oppressing slavic majority without special fair representation by both parties.

If we are talking about today, no one is being murdered. So your argument is also being irrelevant, or do you decide what year to start measuring?  And YOU should stop lying. And your argument is -Wikipedia? What, that is not an argument. 

 Look- reports that says that the LEFT are far more dangerous. Can you please link to serious reports that says differently? 
[Link](http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sverige/storsta-hotet-kommer-fran-vanster/), [Link 2](http://lansposten.se/2014/07/vansterextremister-ar-storsta-faran/). I can link to the report if you want. Can you give me serious, credible sources that can prove that SÄPO are wrong, and that you are right. Because they claim, and they probably know way more than you, that the left is a bigger threat. 

&gt;Right wing extremism is a problem as well. Pretending there is nothing but left wing extreme violent is dishonest.

No one has done that, you are making stuff up again. 

And- you forgot to answer all the other questions. Do you support illegal demonstrations? Do you support illegaly cover ones face? Do you think demonstrators should follow the law? Do you think it is OK to throw acid, bombs, stones, ammonia etc at people, horse, and the police?

&gt;Säpö is police organization so they are not perhaps the most adequate to say what is ""serious threat to democracy"". 

That is their job and they are rather separate from the normal police. Besides, researchers says the same as well. And normal police reports from all over the country clearly show that the left are a) far more violent and have more incidents b) are far more focused. They are better at targeting people, in particular politicians, they don't like, and/or their family. They famously beat up a politicans pregnant girlfriend last year for example.

&gt; It is clear that they really don't know that much of politics or of the movements that they could produce a rigorous analysis of the threat to democracy per se.

How on earth is that clear? Have you read the report?

Quand je parle de l'anarchisme, c'est par rapport à l'insulte qui m'a été lancée, ça n'a rien à voir avec Mélanchon (qui est en effet un ""franc-maçon/atlantiste/comédien""). 

Si c'est par rapport au fait que je me retrouve dans beaucoup des idées d'un anarchiste, et pas totalement, c'est justement parce qu'un anarchiste ne défendrait pas la *totalité* des valeurs énoncées (sinon ça ne serait tout simplement plus de ""l'anarchisme"").

true,Igelkotten,SWED,Sweden,"&gt;Come on, now! It is not possible that you don't know the classical dichotomy: socialists/capitalists i.e. marxists/liberals i.e left/RIGHT! It is the most basic stuff that the Left seeks to overcome capitalism and liberal State, while the Right (INCLUDING LIBERALS) seeks to maintain it (maybe with minor reforms).
If you want to introduce a center, it would be the Social Democrats (which are nowadays more liberals than social democrats in the strict sense)

No, Reinfeldts party, which is to the right, is called liberal or center right. [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate_Party). It is hardly right wing. 

&gt;What do you mean by this? By killings, how about Breivik? By injuries, how about the hate crimes done by the Right (that are not necessarily even reported)?

Breivik was Norwegian............ This is in Sweden. The violent left leads in number of supporters, number of attacks, number of incidents etc. There is nothing that indicates that crimes from the right should be more under reported than crimes from the left as far as I know. 


&gt;This is true. I don't like violence either at all, so I'm far more scared by the far-right who can - and do - attack almost anyone anywhere. For me it's more scarier when violence is used randomly towards immigrants, LGBTIQ-people, hippies, humanists whatever they make up...

SÄPO, and Swedish researcher, deems the left as a far bigger threat to democracy since they attack politicians, people who speak out - not just the random guy in the street. So, I will side with the police and the people who research this stuff - the left is more dangerous. 

And I agree- I dislike all violent assholes, but the random ones are scarier. Can't they be like us and hide behind a keyboard :-). 

&gt;Finally, I haven't look on Säpö reports because I'm not particularly interested in Sweden, but I guess they are pretty similar to Europol's.

I haven't read Europols reports, so I can't really comment on that. Are they alike?  You said, *They focus only on the violence, thinking it is the same on both sides, so they analyze the threat to persons or politicians or whatever. It is clear that they really don't know that much of politics or of the movements that they could produce a rigorous analysis of the threat to democracy per se.*.

I don't agree with that statement when it comes to SÄPO's report, but maybe that is how the Europol's reports looks like. SÄPO did bring up how they threatened democracy, how one should counter them etc. 



And, about Breivik, (although he is from Norway). I don't think anyone can protect themselves or their country from one random crazy violent person, although we should try. But, we do have a better chance I believe when they come in groups.

You cannot simply switch it off or on with zero consequence. You can read up on Nazi ideology because it isn't open to interpretation; It's a clear cut set of beliefs. 

When you try to compare that to Islam and its followers, you absolutely cannot equate the two, both in how their ideological framework and in their interpretation/practice. It simply does not make logical sense.

Given that hatred for Islam and its followers is, 99% of the time, born entirely out of hatred for the foreign as opposed to ideological disagreement, it is pretty relevant that you at least know a few of the people you're about to claim follow, as the OP puts it, a ""barbaric and backward"" ideology to see how truly ""barbaric and backward"" it is, as opposed to relying on media designed to gain profit from clicks which rarely ever delves into the actual issues behind any problems.

So, yes, in contrast to normal political ideology, you should at least try and know some people personally that proscribe to it, and failing that you should be extremely well informed on the tenants of the religion and be able to draw distinction between religious actions and political ones.

If I were to use an extreme example; ISIS is not a religious entity. It's a political entity using an extremist interpretation of religion as validation for its existence. Its actions are not religious based, they're politically based. Beheading Foley was a political act, not a religious act. Suicide Bombing is also a mostly political act with religious justification. 

Critiques of Islam, and there are valid criticisms to be made, often flat out *refuse* to make those distinctions because when we get to the meat of *their* argument, they're not based on ideology but on racial prejudice.

And that all ties back in to ""Yes, you should know some Muslims before you claim to have an informed opinion about Muslims"", because that helps remove the ""prejudice against the foreign"" aspect of these discussions. 

I can almost guarantee you that /u/Dan_Cos does not know any Muslims personally. If he lives in the right area in the country he might have seen them around, but that would be about it, and it's because he doesn't know them he has a prejudiced predisposition that comes from a point of ignorance and therefore cannot have an informed stance on the subject as the ideology of religion in practice and the people who follow it are deeply intertwined as well as being mixed with politics.",0,1408846138,null,0,false,0,cjysn1x,t3_2edoy3,t1_cjysn1x,t1_cjyqyfl,null,1427387497,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

""weil"" wird im Umgangston oft wie ""denn"" verwendet, es müsste aber ""weil man irgendwo anfangen *muss*"" heißen. [Hier mehr dazu](http://german.stackexchange.com/questions/5724/difference-between-weil-and-denn).

**Zweiter Fehler, noch schlimmer als wie der Erste**

""Als wie"" ist so gut wie nie korrekt. Für ""as"" verwende ""wie"" (So dumm wie Brot!), für ""than"" verwende ""als"" (Dümmer als die Polizei erlaubt!). Never both.

**Geb mir noch 'nen Fehler!**

Zugegeben, Imperativ auf Englisch ist einfacher. (to) give -&gt; Give! / (to) eat -&gt; Eat!

Auf Deutsch haben einige Wörter eine eigene Befehlsform, z.B. Gib! Nimm! oder Iss! 
Wird in Umgangssprache und IM oft ignoriert, fällt in formaler Schriftsprache aber schon auf.

**Genitiv ist out, wegen dem Dativ**

Fälle ganz allgemein. Genitiv -&gt; Dativ (während ~~dem Regen~~ des Regens) und Dativ - Akkusativ (~~Wen~~ Wem kann ich helfen?) sind besonders beliebt. Hier zählt vor allem Übung; wenn du einen Deutschen auf der Straße fragst, wo man welchen Fall verwendet, bekommst du vermutlich eine Menge Gestammel oder ""It just feels right"".

**Reddit sein Thread**

Japaner hätten mit der Struktur zwar ihre Freude (私^Ich の 本^buch -&gt; Mein Buch), aber im Deutschen steht das Objekt vor dem Besitzer (Auto meines Bruders). Ein Apostroph beim Genitiv-S (~~Mutter's Auto~~ -&gt; Mutters Auto) wird häufig verwendet, ist aber eigentlich falsch^citation ^needed. 

**Und ich so wie: Oh mein Gott! Aber nicht wirklich, Bruder.**

Generell: Englische Phrasen (Not really / OMG / ...like... / cause [word]) nach Möglichkeit nicht eindeutschen. Wird immer häufiger verwendet, klingt aber meist als hätte der Sprecher zu viel Reddit/4chan gelesen und die eigene Sprache verlernt. 

**Das Letzteste**

Jo, absolute Adjektive nicht steigern. Geht aber wirklich um Tipps zum Abschluss:

*Internetsprache ist weird, jo!* Am Besten nichts von Youtube und co lernen. Google Translate hat meist bessere Grammatik. 

Und: Gutes Deutsch muss nicht großväterlich klingen. Gerade Bürosprache (Wir dürfen Sie hochachtungsvoll dazu aufrufen) ist voller Phrasen, die entweder unnütz oder einfach falsch sind. Wir schreiben nicht für preußischen Hochadel, sondern normale Menschen, die wissen wollen, worum es geht und was wir ihnen mitteilen wollen. Ist leider bei vielen Organisationen noch nicht angekommen. Ein gutes Stilbuch ist hier immer ein gelungenes Investment.

J'ai développer une réponse (un peu longue) pour u/Frensoa qui pourrait peut-être mieux expliquer la démonstration. Je vais tout de même copier-coller un extrait du paragraphe en question, tiré de la Somme Théologique (Prima Pars, question 2, article 3). 

* ""Si (...) tout peut ne pas exister, à un moment donné, rien n'a existé. Or, si c'était vrai, maintenant encore rien n'existerait; car ce qui n'existe pas ne commence à exister que par quelque chose qui existe. Donc, s'il n'y a eu aucun être, il a été impossible que rien commençât d'exister, et ainsi, aujourd'hui, il n'y aurait rien, ce qu'on voit être faux."" 

&gt; ...mais tu penses donc que la matière ne peut pas donner naissance à ce que tu appelles l'être ?

Si je t'ai bien compris tu veux dire ""l'être"" par rapport à ""un être en général"" (comme toi ou moi, par exemple) - alors en effet la matière en elle-même ne peut donner naissance à l'être, car nous voyons que la matière à toujours besoin de *forme* pour faire et définir ce que cet être est ([Hylémorphisme](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyl%C3%A9morphisme)). (La forme est le principe substantiel d’un être individuel défini par son essence spécifique, par ce que cette chose *est*) 

La matière de cet être n'existe donc pas *avant* que cet être soit, car nous voyons que tel être est fait de matière *et* de forme ; la matière de cet être ne peut pas être en une sorte de ""suspension"" avant qu'elle ne trouve sa forme (forme qui justement fait que cet être *soit*).

Are you kidding me? The far left is NOT aiming for a democracy, never have. They freely hurt people, and politicians. They are not social democrats, have no problem with killing or hurting people with a different agendan - and, ffs, you have seen the far left regimes now and in last century. Don't you dare defend any of them, or pretend that *these* violent anti democratic leftist are better than the other violent anti democratic leftis we have had in the last 100 years. I don't likethe right either, they are all scum, but at the moment, in my country, the left are the far bigger scum. Might not be like that in 40 years, but now, yes, they are not only bigger scums, but bigger threat.

Frankly, what they are trying to achieve is a communist world. We all know how well that usually ends. I can read from their program, you can't. AND- I'd much, much rather trust researcher at famous universities, the police who does this for a living and other well known sources. Do you have anything scientific to back up what you are saying?

It is also very naive by going just what people say, and I wonder why you do that only with regards to the left. You do not strike me as very naive. ISIS wants to create paradise on earth, they are really nice guys if you just read...I don't understand how *anyone* can overlook what people actually do, and pretend it didn't happen and instead say the other guy, who didnt' do anything is worse. Frankly -that is just wrong what you are saying, I am sad to say. You are allowed of course to you opinion that the left is good guys, but that is plain wrong and you have nothing factual to back that up. And, I as a person, and I as a citizen, most certainly want Sweden to base its politics on facts, not on opinions, while simultaniously overlooking facts.

Ah et règle importe durant leurs rencontre: pas de politique durant les débats. Donc encore une fois que Mélenchon ou qui que ce soit soit franc-maçon... Ça ne change rien.

14-18 et 39-45 n'ont pas été causées par les franc-maçons. Au contraire ils ont été très persécutés, des milliers se sont fait exécuter et embarqués en camps de concentration.

M. est toujours présente, la France n'est pas opprimée géographiquement, nous sommes l'un des pays les plus prolifériques du monde... Franchement il n'y a pas de quoi s'inquiéter.

Sweddit is nothing like Flashback. In fact, they did a poll last week and around 14 % were SD, which is ""normal"" considering Sweddit have a young demographic, mostly men. I also think the left got 13 % and Pirate Party even more. So that is actually an abnormal amount. So no, Sweddit is not like Sweden when the Swedditors vote, but hardly like Flashback. 

And, I also find it a bit absurd, just like many Swedditors when people do start to question the cost, the integration, the amount of people (we have to raise taxes now for that) and it is a question that has been surpressed for years in Sweden, that when one finally start to discuss it like adult countries, that we are all of a sudden racist. I think it is normal to question it, and to for example want an immigration policy more like Canada, or Germany, or just question why we should take the hoghest amount per capita in Western Europe doesn't make you an SD voter. But, unfortunately, all parties apart from SD have the same stance so that is what the pro open border crowd says- That  you are SD if you even questions the immigration policy.

&gt; In 2008 a visit by Hunza Prince was organized in Republic of Macedonia. This Pakistani people were proclaimed as direct descendants of the Alexandrian army and as people who are the most closely related to the Ethnic Macedonians.[63] The Hunza delegation was welcomed at the Skopje Airport by the country's prime minister Nikola Gruevski, the head of the Macedonian Orthodox Church Archbishop Stephen and the then-mayor of Skopje Trifun Kostovski.

This doesn't sound like an exclusive or supremacist claim on Macedonian heritage.

As a historian myself I have much more of a problem with the Greek effort to monopolize Hellenistic and Byzantine culture, which effectively tries to marginalize its massive significance.

And while I will readily acknowledge that this is mostly myth-building, there pretty much undoubtedly *is* blood from the ancient Macedonians in the Macedonian population (even though also there's undoubtedly much more in the Northern Greek population.)

As far as I can tell the nationalism is mostly about snubbing Greek bullying, which seems according to the Wiki to have preceded it.

Unless you're talking about borders drawn in 1913, which is a silly thing to complain about, the instances of truly crazed nationalism, like the bit you quote, seem pretty isolated to me.

Although I have learned a bit today about how much Macedonia's also been bullied by Serbia and Bulgaria.

I don't know. I have more sympathy for a bullied and marginalized people, than for those throwing a huge fit about how bad their history is (even while they themselves are mangling and misrepresenting history constantly.)",0,1408859903,null,0,false,0,cjyxm1v,t3_2ed1s5,t1_cjyxm1v,t1_cjyp4vb,null,1427385177,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Oggi c'è stato un calo drastico del traffico in Italia e quei tavoli non esistono più, i giocatori amatoriali che buttavano soldi nel poker (conosco, studio il mercato e leggo i report degli analisti del settore) si sono buttati su bingo, scommesse, casinò e lotterie, quindi bisogna giocare a livelli più bassi (100 e 200€ per tavolo) con relativa riduzione del guadagno medio mensile. Comunque, raramente è sotto i 2000€/mese. 

&gt;E da quando hai iniziato a oggi il bilancio speso/guadagnato quant'e?

Non lo so di preciso. In realtà ho sempre avuto le mani bucate e se guadagnavo molto spendevo molto in viaggi. Ad un certo punto ho dovuto tirar fuori una cifra intorno ai 25.000€ per la mia famiglia che soffriva di problemi economici nell'attività commerciale. Il bilancio totale se escludiamo le spese è comunque attorno ai 150.000€. 

&gt;Quante ore passi davanti allo schermo o a leggere libri, insomma a fare qualcosa che sia poker-relevant? 

Oggi non studio più, sinceramente. Ho studiato i primi due anni. La media di tempo dedicato al poker è di 25/30 ore settimanali. 

&gt;Sei uno di quelli che gioca su 10 tavoli alla volta?

Il numero di tavoli gestibile contemporaneamente dipende dalla modalità di gioco; se sono sit&amp;go, ad esempio, si può tenerne senza troppi problemi 24. Per il cash game è più complesso, c'è chi ne tiene 24, ma già 16 è un numero più che sufficiente. Ovviamente aumentando il numero di tavoli aumenti il profitto orario, ma devi calcolare che un tavolo in più è un po' di concentrazione in meno, quindi il guadagno medio per tavolo diminuisce. Secondo me il numero ideale di tavoli nella modalità che gioco io (cash game) è 8/10, che è il numero di tavoli che gioco io.

A lot of people died doing exactly this sort of thing, one left to bleed to death in the death strip as West Berliners looked on, unable to help.

This was a daring escape, because as the commentary says, the entire river belonged to East Berlin, so anyone jumping to help would have been at risk (at the very end of the video, one of them says they were astonished the guards didn't shoot. There was another place in Berlin where you had the same thing: the wall built on one side of the river but the river belonging in its entirety to East Berlin (where the East Side Gallery is now). In separate incidents, five children fell into the river on the West Berlin side, and drowned because nobody dared jump in after them, for fear of being shot at. Eventually, an agreement was reached and emergency signals installed: anyone trying to save somebody from drowning would first operate the alarm and the guards promised not to shoot.

Even more curious was the case of the Lenné Triangle. This was a spot near Potsdamer Platz. Although the physical wall went in a straight line from the Brandenburg Gate, the political border had a large kink in it, so a sizeable chunk of land west of the wall actually belonged to East Berlin, and so was out of bounds to West Berlin police.

But West Berlin wanted to build an autobahn through this point, and needed the land. This was in the late 80s, and relations between East and West Berlin were already easing a bit, so a deal was struck to sell the land to West Berlin.

Some West Berliners protested against this new autobahn, and occupied the land while it was still East Berlin territory. All the West Berlin police could do was beseige them and wait for the land swap to come into effect. The moment it did, the protestors scaled the wall and escaped into East Berlin, the only instance I know of any deliberate attempt to escape from West to East Berlin.

I'm sorry to hear that.

Bonn's reputation is one that will confirm all the stereotypes of the German middle classes: fussy, overly correct, sticklers for The Rules, the kind of people who will lecture you on how to hang your washing out in a more aesthetically pleasing manner. On the other hand, Bonn is a university town and so it's not all that bad. Still, if you ask most Germans what word they would use to describe Bonn, it would be ""bourgeois"".

On Germans not liking Americans: this isn't true, although if you loudly proclaim to all who will listen that the You Ess of Ay is the Greatest Country In The World, you won't be invited to many parties. But Germans, although perfectly friendly, are slower to move to familiar first-name terms, are less likely to make a great show of their emotions, and want to get to know you properly before regarding you as a ""friend"". Plus, they're pretty direct, and if they don't approve of something, they'll tactfully let you know. This all contributes to the perception of Germans as ""cold"" and ""unfriendly"".

It helps to imagine how Americans might appear to Germans. When visiting America, Germans are taken aback by the way strangers talk to them as if they were old friends; Americans who work in even the worst and badly-paid jobs -- wait staff, for example -- are always smiling and acting as if meeting you is the best thing that ever happened to them, which Germans know cannot possibly be true -- so from their perspective, all that smiling, effusive bonhomie must be fake, and therefore superficial and dishonest. And Americans are always quick to get excited, to use hyperbole (""This is the greatest thing EVAR!"") and react in ways Germans think can't possibly be genuine. Added to that, Germans maintain eye contact slightly longer than Americans do, so Americans always think Germans are staring while Germans think Americans are being evasive.

But don't worry about it too much. Basically, if you are greeted with a smile and a handshake when you would expect a cry of joy and a hug, it's not because the German is cold and unfriendly; they are genuinely pleased to see you, they just don't see that they need to make a big thing of it.",0,1408868571,null,0,false,0,cjyzm71,t3_2effe4,t1_cjyzm71,t1_cjyz9d4,null,1427384170,17,false,germany,t5_2qi4z,17

Due anni fa molto meno, oggi di più. I primi 6 mesi sarai quasi sicuramente sotto i 500€. Un guadagno intorno ai 1.500€, partendo da zero, è raggiungibile verosimilmente in un anno. Ovviamente il poker è un gioco in cui non si possono fare previsioni ben precise; potresti non guadagnare nulla per 6 mesi come potresti guadagnare 1.500/2000 € già da subito. Il numero di mani giocate mensilmente da un professionista si aggira attorno alle 60/80.000, e in questo campione di mani l'elemento aleatorio è molto influente (diminuisce aumentando il campione). 

&gt;come paghi le tasse?

Sono pagate alla fonte, non devi fare dichiarazione dei redditi. 

&gt;quali sono i migliori siti per info/strategie/studio?

I forum come 2+2 in inglese, continuation bet, assopoker, intellipoker, pokerstrategy in italiano, sono molto istruttivi. In realtà la cosa più istruttiva in assoluto è inserirsi in un team di giocatori, per confrontarsi e migliorare assieme. 

&gt;e per giocare?

Questo cambia mese per mese. Pokerstars è un buon sito dove giocare ma bisogna avere un progetto a lungo termine, cioè pensare di giocarci tutto l'anno per raggiungere status vip che ti permettono di guadagnare bene. 

&gt;ti sei mai messo nel mondo delle scommesse?

So che si può fare guadagno anche lì ma è molto più complicato. Quando sei nel poker online giochi contro altri giocatori, esseri umani, che commettono molti errori. Quando sei su un sito di scommesse giochi contro il bookmaker, contro la quota; anche le quote sono soggette ad errori ma ritengo che il ""margine del banco"" sia troppo a sfavore del giocatore. Conosco il settore molto bene e lo osservo costantemente ma non gioco scommesse sportive. 

&gt;solo poker o anche altri giochi?

Non ho capito bene la domanda. Io gioco tantissimi altri giochi oltre al poker, ad esempio sono un grande appassionato di scacchi. Ma guadagnare giocando a scacchi è troppo complicato, il livello medio dei giocatori è terribilmente più alto del poker e la curva di apprendimento è totalmente diversa. Possono passare molti anni prima che diventi un buon giocatore di scacchi e anche quando lo sei diventato ci saranno dei ragazzini di 8-10 anni più bravi di te in giro per il mondo. Farne una fonte di reddito è impossibile per il 99.9% della popolazione mondiale, nella quale sono compreso. La differenza fondamentale fra poker e scacchi è che negli scacchi vince (quasi) sempre il più bravo; nel poker il migliore giocatore del mondo può perdere, in una singola partita, anche dal più scarso, essendo la componente aleatoria preponderante nel breve periodo.

If you're serious about your beer, be sure to take the time out to go to Düsseldorf (approx an hour away by train) and try the local Altbier, which is a dark, much sweeter variant.

- Most stores are closed after 8pm and on sundays/holidays.
- Actually, no am/pm - 8pm = 20 Uhr. Also, pretty much everything is metrical.
- Price tags in stores include taxes.
- No such thing as free tap water in restaurants.
- In most restaurants you'll seat yourself - just not on tables with a ""Reserviert"" sign. But you can also ask a waiter for a seat/seats.
- Tipping waiters is optional but common. For smaller amounts you usually simply round up to the next full €. More for higher amounts and better service.
- Cash is king. Credit cards won't get you far.
- On unmarked intersections left yields to right. 
- Rechtsfahrgebot: On multi-lane roads (outside of towns) like the Autobahn you keep to the rightmost lane as much as you can to not hinder the flow of traffic. The other lanes are for taking over, not cruising.
- If the part of the sidewalk you're walking on is red, you might get hit by a cyclist.
- Answer the phone with your *sur*name, not just ""ahoy-hoy!"".

Honestly people in Germany just don't like arrogant and overly patriotic people, no matter what country they are from, so as long as you don't only talk about how much better everything is in the states people will not mind your place of birth.


As for what to see, check travel guides but generally there is cologne really close by and Bonn also has some nice old buildings in the inner city if that is your thing.
And as it used to be the capital of Germany we have some pretty nice museums if German history etc, search for ""museumsmeile"".

Finding friends is difficult, look for a sports club or similar where people will want to meet new people.
Also what I learned is that people in Germany will be more sincere with what they are saying. If you meet someone at a party or somewhere else in Germany and they say ""we should meet and visit x location together"" that actually means they want to do that, unlike the US where ""Oh we should totally meet"" does not mean anything concrete in my experience.

This ""sincereness"" translates to other conversations, just imagine all adjectives to mean something stronger.

Dass Fernsehen speziell, und Medien allgemein verblöden und gleichmachen ist auch nicht unbedingt eine krasse Verschwörungstheorie und ist mit gesundem Menschenverstand nicht abwegig.

Ich sehs sicherlich manchmal etwas zu verbissen und könnte mich mit meiner Meinung etwas mäßigen und bewusster ausdrücken. Allerdings weiß ich, dass meine Statements - wenn auch nicht immer perfekt durchdacht und ausgedrückt ist - doch nicht ganz ohne Fundament da stehen.

First of all get some manners, people are trying to have a conversation with you and you're just throwing insults all over the place. According to your logic, every nation is allowed to have a history but Greek history is just generic ""Eastern Mediterranean history"" and monopolising it would mean marginalising it. Well guess what, it is what it is. Some nations have had more impact on world history than others, why does everything need to be PC?


No one is getting bullied and attacked, it's called diplomacy and negotiations. Being from the actual area i can speak from personal experience instead of repeating something i read on the internet. Greece is one of the biggest (if the not THE biggest, i don't wanna pull facts out of my ass here) investors in FYROM, also an estimated number of about a million northern Greeks crossed the border to FYROM in 2013 for shopping and recreation, which is obviously an additional boost to the economy. Both our governments, under the guidance of the UN and the EU, are working on finding a diplomatic solution that's fair for both sides. Do you expect your government to bend over backwards for everyone? Well guess what, neither do we. If you think that the Greek veto is the only thing that's keeping FYROM out of the EU you're mistaken.


There is a common misconception that Greece wants to monopolise the name Macedonia, that's not the case. We just asked for a geographic specification to be added in front of the name, ""upper"" and ""north"" were the most viable suggestions by the UN but FYROM has declined them both. Instead they counter-proposed that Greece use the term ""Upper Macedonia"" for all purposes, while the rest of the world can go on using plain ""Macedonia"", which is more of a joke than a solution. I don't think i have to explain the trouble that 2 geographical entities sharing 1 name causes. Legal issues, commercial interests and plain confusion to name a few.


I'm not gonna go into historical sources because it's mostly going to be arbitrary deciphering of select parts rather than factual proof. For example when you call somebody a bastard in coloquial speech do you literally mean that he was born out of wedlock? The same thing can be said about why the Athenians reffered to the Macedonians as ""barbarians"". We sometimes forget that ancient sources are not always literal, the ancients also had a sense of humour, irony and a tendency towards political slander.


One last thing to wrap this up. Greece, under no circumstances, wants to keep FYROM out of the EU forever. It is in our best interests that the whole Balkan region eventualy joins because it's going to benefit everyone in the wider area. The biggest part of our foreign investment goes in the Balkans.",0,1408873872,null,0,false,0,cjz0i7c,t3_2ed1s5,t1_cjz0i7c,t1_cjync6h,null,1427383755,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

true,ToolParabola,GERM,Germany,"To expand a bit on the post by /u/lehyde, The biggest national holiday in Germany is 3rd October, the Reunification Day (Tag der Deutschen Einheit). It's not when the Berlin Wall fell, but rather when the former DDR (""East Germany""/German Democratic Republic) joined the states (Länder) of the BRD (""West Germany""/Federal Republic) in the form of 7 new states.
That was when the occupation of Germany and especially Berlin by the Allied Forces officially ended and our country became fully sovereign in all affairs.

This day is celebrated with a big fair (Deutschlandfest) that is being held in a different state each year. When the fair was held in my hometown of Bonn a few years back, I went and enjoyed some sausages from Thuringia, some good wine from the Mosel and Pfälzer Saumagen, and good Lyoner mortadella from the Saarland, among others :D

**Note 1:** The 9th November is the day when the Berlin Wall fell and several important events happened on this day throughout the years  ( [Link to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_9_in_German_history) ), but it couldn't be celebrated as a national holiday because of a very dark chapter of German History: On 9th November 1938, the Nazi leadership organized the [Reichspogromnacht](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichspogromnacht), where Jewish shops were destroyed and looted, synagogues were burned and Jews were harassed and murdered.

**Note 2:** From 1953-1990, the National Holiday in Western Germany was 17 June. After the [1953 uprising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uprising_of_1953_in_East_Germany) against the Communist leadership in Eastern Germany was crushed with the help of Soviet tanks, the BRD declared 17 June to be a national holiday. This was supposed to demonstrate the desire of the Germans living in the DDR for reunification and thereby the illigitimacy of the Communist government.

I'm just going to go through the discussions we had at the Finnish subreddit.

- Finding good political weapons for the closing elections has been a bit hard. Against promises to the opposite, economy has continued to slowly wind down. Certain apathy that things could be differently starts to set in. It doesn't really help that Social Democrats and National Coalition (right-wing party) form the government with help of pretty much all the smaller parties, leaving outside only the biggish Centre-party and True Finns (which share the same voting base). So any particular protest-votes would go to these guys, and now True Finns have unveiled their weapon: *The Finnish alcohol monopoly should be broken and alcohol taxation lowered*. Waiting to see how this shows up in the polls. [Source in Finnish](http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2014081718579363_uu.shtml)

- The debate on mining rights continues. We have had several mining related catastrophes during the last five years, but not only have the mining laws not been looked into, companies that have caused accidents can continue their operation even when they have been shown to not follow the law. The ultimate is the Talvivaara corporation that not only poisoned all the waters in the nearby lakes, had failed to follow the (very lax) directives and finally state bumbed more money into the corporation to ensure it wouldn't go bankrupt. *The latest episode is that a researcher claims that the areas given for seeking valuable metals is too high and the government doesn't want to see the risks of operating on extremely sensitive natural areas. The bureau in charge claims that the landowners like the current practice.* [Link in Finnish](http://yle.fi/uutiset/tutkija_ja_tukes_napit_vastakkain_kaivosluvista__tama_on_illuusioiden_maailma/7391178).

- National Coalition (the prime minister party) found a double whammy this week: first *NCP suggested that weekly working hours could be increases from 37.5 hours to 40 hours without increasing salaries* (to help with international competition) ([Link](http://www.hs.fi/politiikka/Kokoomuksen+Satonen+Viikkoty%C3%B6aika+voitaisiin+pident%C3%A4%C3%A4+40+tuntiin/a1408327809598)), then their minister in charge of social welfare and health claims that *very few in Finland earn less than 2100 euros/month and only marginally more than 2600 euros per month* ([Link](http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/kotimaa/laura%20raty%20lapsivahennys-24599)). The answer is ""somewhere between 50%-60% of the population"". The interview was published in NCP's own media, making the whole thing even more ridiculous.

- Elinkeinoelämän valtuuskunta (The lobby-group for rich people and big corporations, close to NCP) published a recommendation that we should arrange our health services like Netherlands, employment markets like Denmark, finance markets like Estonia and Switzerland, cut salaries like Spain and spending like Latvia. ([Link in Finnish](http://yle.fi/uutiset/eva_terveydenhoito_on_huippua_hollannissa_tyomarkkinat_joustavat_fiksuimmin_tanskassa/7420498)). 

- The lobbying group representing copyright owners successfully convinced the ministry of education that *schools need a copyright-licence to use the Internet* and succeeded in selling a licence. The money will be directed to the same people who get the rest of licence money (determined for example based on library lending stats). Any blog-owners etc. have to separately prove that their webpages have been used in schools. This will probably prove to be impossible. ([Link](http://www.tivi.fi/kaikki_uutiset/ministerio+osti+kouluille+luvat+kopioida+verkkosivuja/a1004771))

- Rents in Helsinki have risen so high that people find strange ways to work here. The article illustrates a person who sleeps in the forrest year around, a person who keeps their home on a trailer in a camping site year around, a single mother who rents one room in a large apartment with four other households and a person who comes to Helsinki every day on train from 100 km away. [(Link in Finnish)](http://www.hs.fi/koti/a1408075811074?jako=ee9de0a707aa69266c69557e6e7c8a89&amp;ref=tw-share). Personal experience: a friend of mine lived in a 20 m^2 apartment and paid for it 900 e/m. This was five years ago and the rents have apparently raised steeply since then. To give context: In my home town you can get twice the size for half the price in a similar location. Reason being that people want to live in Helsinki but Helsinki isin't willing to build new apartments.

- The head of Finnish Defence Forces in the 90s, since-retired general Hägglund wrote a book where he tells his opinion on several subjects: he's against NATO (because it would make Finns lazy), Russia is vary of attacking Finland after the last time, NATO will help us even if we aren't members ([Link](http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2014031918138050_uu.shtml)], against women in army (they do their duty by giving birth) ([Link](http://yle.fi/uutiset/hagglund_asevelvollisuus_naisille_jos_miehet_synnyttavat/7423149?ref=reddit)), Russians will be stuck in Ukraine for years and that Ukraine has bad soldiers (based on their competence in Winter War) ([Link](http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/201408210215404_uu.shtml)).

It's my impression that despite the infamous Jantelov and the general tax-heavy social democracy we have going on in Denmark, genuinely successful entrepreneurs are reasonably respected. It depends a lot on their behaviour though. If they are seen to have earned their wealth, as in the case of the Lego Kirks or the late Mærsk, people acknowledge that. If they seem to have hustled their way to wealth, as in various high-profile fraud cases over the past decade, they are duly ridiculed, and that's when a lot of them will invoke the Jantelaw to ""defend"" themselves.

With actual captains of industry like Mærsk, it's only when he gets particularly pretentious and starts building enormous, ugly as sin prestige buildings right across from the royal palace that he catches some flack.

Generally I think it's important that the possibility exists of having huge, overwhelming financial success from something you build, even if you still have to pay most of your earnings back into society.

* A large congress center was finished last year in [South Moravian  village Lednice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lednice). The cost was about 0,5 billion CZK (~19 million euro) and it was financed from EU funds.  The construction was shoddy: waterproofing is insufficient and the plaster is already falling off. Worse, no one has any idea how to attract visitors into a mammoth complex  in a remote location lacking other necessary infrastructure.  The center was a pet project of an influential regional politician.  Another useful project (healing spa in a place w/o water spring) is underway.

I remember couple months ago they said they cannot gather even 1 thousand of local volunteers (and - unlike today - they were kind of winning side at that moment) - I guess their present declaration means RuFed is sending 3 fully equipped military brigades (that's 10-15 thousands soldiers with artillery, tanks, APCs, etc.) into Ukraine - or these brigades are already in Ukraine* and require ""legitimization"" as ""concerned citizens"" with tanks, artillery, AA missiles and infamous ""Buks"";

* after recent spark of ""extremist""/""separatism"" activity in Kaliningrad / Konigsberg (people protested with slogans ""Stop feeding Moscow!"") Kremlin has changed their mind and [decided to cease building of extremely expensive football stadium in this region](http://top.rbc.ru/economics/21/08/2014/944296.shtml#xtor=AL-[internal_traffic]--[rbc.ru]-[main_body]-[main_item]-[title]) for WC-18. Official explanation - it's too expensive - but exactly the same reason can be used for every stadium + 50B expenses were perfectly fine for winter Olympic games in Sochi;

(see below)

* 20yo woman was drugged by a taxi driver (recidivist rapist) yet managed to kill him when he attempted to rape her - [""court"" in RuFed has sentenced her to 7 years](http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/2680296.html). Couple weeks ago I've published news how truck driver got 6 years for 18 people he killed (+40 were injured). What's the difference? Girls is citizen of RuFed, truck driver is from Armenia and Armenian state actively participated in the process while there is no state which could defend Russians against RuFed. All 3 ""judges"" were female and they have declared rape isn't dangerous enough for a person to defend her(him)self. Apparently in RuFed people do not have a right for self-defense - self-defense is more dangerous for society than killing 18 people with a truck.

\* note: next thing I expect to see in Ukrainian conflict are fighter jets piloted by ""concerned citizens"" and explanation how rebels have captured them and quickly figured out how to use military airplanes.

Finns seems to be a mix of native peoples to the Nordic and Baltic countries, while there is slightly more continental genetic heritage in the southern and western parts of the country, which tend to overlap with some parts of Sweden. Because Proto-Finns were hunter gatherers and were thus a linguistic tabula rasa, they started adopting languages from their surroundings. As the sea levels rose and farming found its way to Finland, the coastal areas adopted Norse from their Viking contacts (which developed into various dialects of Swedish) and those farther inland adopted Finnic dialects from relatively small tribes wandering from the east.

true,Cyridius,IREL,/r/SocialistPartyIreland,"&gt;The Quran isn't really open to interpretation.

Like every holy book, the Qur'an is very much open to interpretation and use. Islam has I think 6 separate sects, each sect with as many as a dozen other subdivisions within it. There's no central authority in Islam(One of the great tragedies of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire), and so there's no unified interpretation of the Qur'an. You can have things as wild and crazy as Al Qaeda and ISIS, to whole concepts of progressive ideologies like Islamic Socialism(Which is a thing). 

In the same way how in Catholicism you can have people like Pope Benedict XVI how had grand thrones of gold and very detailed and prestigious clothes and so on, to people like Pope Francis, who has very simple clothes and a throne made of wood. There is not a religion on this planet that has people of wildly different character taking their own meaning/interpretation from the books.

&gt;Of course the Muslims are very different - but it mostly depends on the society they live in.

Bingo. Social conditions are the biggest factor for the behaviour of people. Religion is a factor in that.

That leads to this;

&gt;I have no clue how would you explain politically going from a rich and peaceful country to fucking Syria or Iraq to go to a savage war.

Just because our countries are rich does not mean that everyone in them is rich. Muslims are generally the second or third generation of immigrants, which means they're largely going to be working class people. When you take into account social attitudes and conditions in places like the UK, you can start seeing why it produces so many jihadis; 

There's a strong xenophobic element within the country, which alienates people like Muslims or other foreigners

There's been a strong hit to things like education so that they actually do cost a significant amount of money so quite a few people cannot afford it anymore

There's this feeling of disenfranchisement and alienation amongst the population there

So, you get those things, mix it together, and then all you need is an outlet for the discontent. One of the biggest ones was the London Riots, but nobody really heard that wake-up call. Eventually, those disenfranchised turned to something they hadn't tried before - religion. And when they went, they found extremist wahabbis and salafists there to indoctrinate them and turn them into recruits for ISIS, and these desperate people with the belief that they'd be able to get away from their life into a new and better life where they have a purpose, they go and they fight for an organization we would consider unimaginably barbaric.

So the conditions that create an ISIS fighter are not religious; They're sociopolitical with a religious element. But to admit that the problem is not solely religious, people would have to admit that there are fundamental problems with their country that are not being addressed; But to do so, for many, would go against their prejudices of these people being freeloaders or sponges or inherently violent people, and so they just refuse to look at the sociopolitical conditions and label it as a religious issue.

I haven't heard of any middle class Muslims with a good career or strong future prospects going abroad to fight. ",0,1408879212,null,0,false,0,cjz1djw,t3_2edoy3,t1_cjz1djw,t1_cjz0kqu,null,1427383350,-1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,-1

The tone of the article is a bit strong though. They do *not* saying Hollande is not responsible for this system which has been there for ages, but they do *not* say the opposite either... Off to a good article!

&gt; with France’s economy faltering and the Socialist government desperate to do something to revive its popularity, some experts expect that President François Hollande’s administration may finally take steps to tear down the tangle of rules that keep competition — and many young people — out of so many sectors of the economy.

The usual ""dynamic people all flee to London"" stuff:

&gt; its declining competitiveness and the drain of its young people to London

Or:

&gt; “You are begging to get into the classes. You are getting shouted at by these teachers. It is humiliating.” Mr. Koenig finally got his license in London.

Seriously I have never ever heard of someone going to *England* to get their license. And if your diriving instructor shouts at you then just change school, there are loads of them...

The written test is the most annoying part, that's true, and dusting it wouldn't hurt. Yes, there's always the one trick question out of sixty, sometimes it's about tanks, sometimes about cows, I don't think it's such a huge deal (but France is absurd, right?).

&gt; Under the Ornikar model, students would be able to study for the written test on their own computers. 

There were tools for that when I got my license, and one of the schools next to me has a system that you can choose or not to synch with their database so they can follow your progression. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad people come up with new ways of doing stuff and it's definitely a closed environment where innovation is not welcome, and this needs to change, but don't make it look like it's ""stone age technology"" vs ""creative people who will end up in London because of French socialism"". It's been possible to study for the written test on your own computer for 10 years.

&gt; one of Mr. Koenig’s frustrations: facing a constantly changing crew of instructors who trash the methods of the one before.

That Mr. Koenig apparently had a difficult childhood.

&gt; In France, charging for the test would be seen as giving rich people an unfair advantage, Mr. Koenig said. “Things that seem obvious elsewhere,” he said, “are not here.”

Seriously, Gaspard, what the fuck are you doing?

Anyway, an article that starts with:

They get shit for a reason, because they are a bunch of complete idiots. It's not about being ""trendy."" Saying that is just a way to remove any sort of responsibility for their stupid actions. 

I could say it's ""Trendy"" to hate on on our environmental party on reddit and it is. Or i could realize that the reason they get a lot of shit is because they have stupid fucking policies, just like SD gets shit because of their stupid shit.

&gt;Even if someone casually mentions that they think that immigration to Sweden should be just be lessened a tiny bit, they get shunned as a racist.

Do you have any actual evidence for this? Sure, if you ask the extreme left that's what theyll say. But the extreme right would say that you're trying to kill the white race if you don't. That's why you dont listen to extremists.

It's not an overwhelmign crackdown, when SD can't even go 2 months without some of their politicians making a huge fuckup or idiotic statement. It's not a crackdown when they provide the material.

&gt;a lot of people who share some ideas with SD that just can't come out and say it because they might be assaulted, verbally and physically, for saying it.

Once again, a complete load of bullshit. You have now blatantly lied 3 times in this comment. Maybe if you stopped reading sites like AvPixlat or FiraTider, you would realize that the vast majority of swedes don't like SD, but they tolerate the people who vote for them.

One girl with no friends or social skills whatsoever, one old overweight and uneducated man who have been to hospital 3 times due to heart attacks and surgeries and one third girl who didn't even pass Gymnasiet and who have physically attacked me numerous times (See: Breaking the law).

That's how populist parties work. They offer solutions that sound good, even if it's the wrong one.

Example: SD wants to increase the prison-time for crimes. This despite the fact that every single study ever conducted have proven that increased punishments doesn't actually help. In some scenarios it even makes it worse. The US is a perfect example of how bad it can get with too harsh justice system, While norway is the example of the exact opposite. 

Still SD wants to increase sentences, despite the fact that every single logic and rational thinking opposes it.

However, people like to feel good. And the thought of punishing criminals makes people feel good. So even if it's the stupid choice, people still like it.

&gt;__Vlad III, Prince of Wallachia__ (1431–1476/77), was a member of the [House of Drăculești](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Dr%C4%83cule%C8%99ti), a branch of the [House of Basarab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Basarab), also known, using his [patronymic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic), as __(Vlad) Drăculea__ or __(Vlad) Dracula__. He was posthumously dubbed __Vlad the Impaler__ ([Romanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language): __Vlad Țepeș__, pronounced [ˈvlad ˈt͡sepeʃ]), and was a three-time [Voivode of Wallachia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wallachia), ruling mainly from 1456 to 1462, the period of the [incipient](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/incipient#English) [Ottoman conquest of the Balkans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_conquest_of_the_Balkans). His father, [Vlad II Dracul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_II_Dracul), was a member of the [Order of the Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Dragon), which was founded to protect [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity) in [Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe). Vlad III is revered as a folk hero in [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania) as well as other parts of Europe for his protection of the [Romanian population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_population) both south and north of the [Danube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube). A significant number of Romanian and [Bulgarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria) common folk and remaining [boyars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyar) ([nobles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility)) moved north of the Danube to [Wallachia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallachia), recognized his leadership and settled there following his raids on the [Ottomans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire).

&gt; Do you have any actual evidence for this? Sure, if you ask the extreme left that's what theyll say. But the extreme right would say that you're trying to kill the white race if you don't. That's why you dont listen to extremists.

It's hard to prove this to you like this, but I live in one of the largest cities in Sweden and I know a lot of people who in public say they are voting for M or PP or whatever, but when in private they say that they are voting for SD, because they know what most people will say if they ""out"" themselves. 
I don't like any extremists, but it's the truth that the radical left are more tolerated than the right extremists. I don't support any of them, they should both just go away, but this shows this misconception people have that the left radicals are some sort of heroes. I think the horseshoe theory is applicable here. As soon as there is some justified criticism against the leftist radicals [people loose their shit](http://www.dagensmedia.se/nyheter/tv/article3825353.ece) and when someone from the left actually support extremists [there is no upheaval.] (http://www.unt.se/uppland/uppsala/ung-vanster-i-uppsala-stodjer-rf-och-afa-3155353.aspx)

&gt; Once again: Source? Do you have anything to back your bullshit up with?

[A masked man tried to steal a 3000kr flag](http://www.vf.se/nyheter/karlstad/maskerad-man-forsokte-stjala-sdflagga) from SD after a FI speech, the SD people at the scene detained him and waited for the police, so a couple of people from FI yelled at them to let him go because it was a 'symbolic' gesture.

[Here](http://politologerna.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/ar-det-mindre-allvarligt-att-hota-en-sverigedemokrat-an-en-socialdemokrat/) is a nice read on the issue of it being accepted to harass Sweden Democrats.

&gt;Once again, a complete load of bullshit. You have now blatantly lied 3 times in this comment. Maybe if you stopped reading sites like AvPixlat or FiraTider, you would realize that the vast majority of swedes don't like SD, but they tolerate the people who vote for them.

I have in truth never read AvPixlat and FiraTider, I have heard of them but I dont know what they are about at all. Yes, the vast majority of swedes don't like SD but that is because of the circlejerk of painting them as nazis. I am from Finland and I have told many people that I don't care that much for SD, but they are being harassed for having an opinion, and I don't support the current crackdown on them. 2/3ds of the time people have tried to convince me that ""But you don't come from Sweden either if SD get power they'll deport you!!11!"" There are a lot of uneducated opinions about SD that contributes to this.

&gt;I personally know 3 people who vote for SD. All 3 of them are completely miserable fuckups who equate to nothing in life. One girl with no friends or social skills whatsoever, one old overweight and uneducated man who have been to hospital 3 times due to heart attacks and surgeries and one third girl who didn't even pass Gymnasiet.

Okay, after telling me everything I have said is bullshit you say this? What does it matter if someone have no friends or social skills? That someone has had surgeries? I mean lol wut? I know a group of leftists, one of them I knew since I was young, the guys have dreadlocks and zits and dirty clothes and the girls are chubby, unwashed and do nothing but play guitar all day. There are stereotypes everywhere. But the ones majority aren't like that, neither in the left or right. SD or V. I try to educate myself about every party to have a real understanding of their policies and what I would support if they got my vote. The ones that do this the least are the people who just listen to others who hate other parties and base their opinion on that. That's how the uneducated opinions get out their. Everywhere. But in particularly the ones who dislike SD. P

Why are you so angry by the way? This is what I am talking about. As soon as someone does not agree that SD is pure devil shit you have to get hostile. Pathetic. I am confident this will change, because it looks like SD will get around 10-15% in the election next month.

""Hey man, you're totally cool, but your way of life is a barbaric, backward, intolerant, totalitarian, stone-age death-cult. Not attacking you, just your way of life that you've lived in since you were born.""

Trying to separate the people from the religion in order to justify his bigotry is pointless. Everyone who has seen his posts knows exactly what he means, and even if he's ""just"" criticizing the religion, he's insulting the way of life of 1.6 billion people with absolutely nothing to support his statements. 

And he's done it for months, and I've called him out for months, and he hasn't been able to support his statements for months. He is an indefensible individual. 

&gt;BUT the sharia and wahabism come from the exact interpretation of the quran, that's why one can and should criticise these interpretations.

Have you read the Qur'an? 

Furthermore, what do you know about Sharia Law? Did you know that most laws on the planet are based either on Common Law or the Napoleonic Code, yet vary wildly in their implementation? Are you aware that it is under Sharia Law that the first welfare states were established in the 7th century, using policies that are today considered progressive, such as Basic Income, Disability welfare and unemployment benefits?

The Five Pillars of Islam;

1. *Shahadah*: declaring there is no god except God, and Muhammad is God's Messenger 

2. *Salat*: ritual prayer five times a day

3. *Zakat*: giving 2.5% of one’s savings to the poor and needy

4. *Sawm*: fasting and self-control during the holy month of Ramadan

5. *Hajj*: pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime if one is able

These are the only core tenants of Islam which you must proscribe to, to be a Muslim. Your are meant to be faithful, charitable, disciplined and determined. Murder does not come onto that list. 

Are you aware that the Ottoman Caliphate attempted to suppress the Wahabbists and Salafists in what is now Saudi Arabia, and that they had successfully done so until the British Empire took the territory from them and gave it to the Sauds, despite the Ottomans warning them not to do it?

Yes, the central Islamic authority 100 years ago told Western powers not to give extremists control. It was not the secular states of Europe that fought extremism, it was the Muslims. And it still is. 

So when people tell me that Islam is a ""barbaric, backward, intolerant, totalitarian, stone-age death-cult"", I can only call them bigoted, ignorant shits because it was Muslims, practicing Islam, that have been fighting against those exact things for centuries, and they still do.

Fuck yes please. In Germany airspace maps are created by a state company that is financed with tax money and then sold for horrendous prices. (Airmap atlas of Germany around 700 Euros). No public info on air spaces - which you need if you want to fly RC models and stuff because it's verboten in certain air spaces. 

Also weather data: The Deutsche Wetterdienst GmbH is financed with our taxes. But the publicly available weather data is ridiculously bad. It's the shit you get through TV news. The cool data (live weather radar, etc) is either sold for a lot of money - or isn't available at all to the public. Only fire departments, etc. get that data. And they get really cool data (I had once access through admin credentials the developers of the client software left for testing in the program). [It's stuff like this](http://files.tmt-cms.de/brk-bayreuth.de/files/Plakate/Konrad1.JPG) - exact storm cell locations, velocity, direction, etc.

I can think of a dozen applications for that data that would prevent damages and possibly save people's lives. But no - data not available because they want make money ontop of being financed by the tax payer.

I contacted the German Pirate Party about that - that instead of fighting for shit like free lady-gaga.mp3 they should try to liberate data like that and make it available to the public. But it did fall on deaf ears I guess.

&gt;How fucked is that. So how would we live in one country with those ""humans""? It's just not real.

&gt;There wasn't just one option for what to do with them (and with Donbass in general) — ghettos, barbed wire, fines and punishments for not loving Ukraine. Nothing to think about, you choose.

&gt;What to do with the ones who support that? I'd imprison them all.

&gt;Here is where Grad is needed.

&gt;We need special colonies for them, but I grudge to feed these maggots.

&gt;Carthago must be destroyed.

&gt;Burn.

&gt;Rat poison into their water!!! Bitches!!!

&gt;If we could take patriots from Donbass... then wall off the rest. It is a cast-iron ball on a country's leg...

&gt;Wall them off with napalm? I second that.

&gt;Let's dox them.

&gt;It is only me who wants to level everything there? They cannot be called humans! They must not exist!

&gt;I don't care about civilian casualties from now.

The POW parade is to be condemned, but it is not hard to see wherein the East's resentment stems from when people like OP generalize the rebels as 'Putin's thugs', and when patriotic ukrainians such as those from /r/ukraina act in the very same way that 'russian propaganda' paints them.

That's funny, because i have, as i said, never heard anyone who openly vote for SD have any problem about it. People don't like it, but we don't do anything about it either.

Yes, the radical left is more tolerated. That's of course wrong, but not surprising given the history of the extreme-right when it comes to murders. But that doesn't mean the left are tolerated by a long shot. They are still widely hated and rejected for being a bunch of spoiled brats.

That's Fi. They are exactly the kind of leftist extremist idiots i talked about earlier, as to how their opinions should be ignored. If someone stole a VP flag, i'm sure that SD voters would celebrate.

You say you don't read Avpixlat, yet you just linked me an article from them.  They are 2 websites dedicated to posting crimes and faces of foreigners and foreigners *only.* They are as biased a source as you could possibly ever find.

No, the vast majority of swedes do not paint SD as nazis. You're once again talking out of your ass of misinformation. You seriously need to stop making shit up like this.

It means that the ones voting for SD are so deep in the shitter that they shouldn't be judging anyone. SD complains about how immigrants take welfare, yet that obese man have cost the swedish state more than probably an entire immigrant family. And that uneducated girl will end up on welfare, collecting tax money. But still they judge immigrants. That's the point.

true,OWKuusinen,FINL,Finland,"Several reasons. They all have in common that Helsinki sucks a lot of work from the rest of Finland, meaning that the countryside is emptying and moving to Helsinki.

- The area of Helsinki people work in (and want to live close to) is a relatively small peninsula and a historical area, so you can't just build new houses there. The housing that gets build tends to be for the upper middle class, who want big apartments on good spots. 

- The area immediately west of the peninsula and reachable by bridges is on Espoo's side (another city) which isn't interested in developing the area. This is now being addressed by building a metro past the rich area to the areas where working class people live. Ready in about five years if Siemens doesn't fuck up the train order, as they have few times said publicly they might. 

- To the North large areas of land are unavailable or virtually unusable because some bright people on the sixties decided that there should be a freeway to near the centre of the city. There's also a huge private golf club there rented from the city on a token fee because city wants to help its citizens to have access to multiple sports. Alas, the membership fees just happen to be several thousand euros per year and on top of that sum you have to pay usage fee that's higher than my rent.

- The peninsula to the East of the centre is apparently used as a ""green space"" and thus you can only build limited amount of housing there. Doesn't help that army has a huge base on the area (which includes apartments for officers), and they want to keep it (it doesn't have defensive worth, so the excusions are stuff like ""the area of base has rare plants on it because there aren't people here. If we abandon the base, they will be destroyed, so obviously we should keep it"".

- The land on the other side of the Eastern Peninsula is being developed, but it's far from the centre (and has two bottlenecks in the sea), so it's easier to just drive a car to the centre from the neighbouring cities on the said highways. 

    - And land in there is near the coast as well and pretty dear, so city wants to get the best possible price out of it. Meaning housing for the middle middle class. 
 
 - Doesn't help that there are only so many builders and if too many are employed at the same time, they start to use less-trained workforce (eg. subsubcontracting Baltics who aren't going to protest when the Finnish contractor starts cutting corners in the cement-drying time, using bad-quality parts etc.)

TL:DR; There is only so much available land and you can get a good price on it, so why build housing for lower middle-class or for the working classes?

END RESULT: It's hard to get cleaners (office and home both) in Helsinki because you don't pay the rent on the wages. So the only people who live in the centre are the poor (to whom state pays the rent, no matter how high), the students who rent huge apartments and share it with five or six people (the price per square metre gets lower the bigger the apartment) and the higher middle classes or the outright rich who can pay the cost.

So yeah, of course Ukraine is not a fascist dictatorship, of course they are not involved in ethnic cleansing, but the civilian populations do suffer from what's happening (please don't reply to that by a retarded ""who's fault is it?"") and now those people have more than propaganda to develop their hatred, they have their personal everyday experience. 

Maybe if Ukraine didn't fight alone they could avoid some unnecessary victims, I don't know, but it's an issue that's never even mentioned here because if it implies that something done by Ukraine is not perfect, it's downvoted.

Anyway, this is going to leave much deeper scars than just ruined buildings, and when the conflict is over I don't expect any of the inhabitants of Donetsk to say ""oh, right, it was propaganda all along, I understand now I have changed my mind"".

Obviously, if drugs are legal, then crime rates would go down (less actions would qualify as crimes). But if you take it a step further, and *give drugs* to addicts (through a government program) you could reduce crime even further. Rather than smashing into a car window to steal a few euro for their next fix, addicts could get their drugs for free, from a nurse or doctor who could also counsel them in options to treat their addiction. Think about that - instead of paying police to write up a report, go arrest someone (hah), take that person to court, take that person to jail or some ""treatment"" program that hardly ever works (as they're forced into it, and don't really want to change at that point), you pay your insurance or for the repair of the car or the deductible, etc, etc, instead we just tell the addict go here, get your drugs, take them there, leave behind the needles in a safe drop box, etc, etc. So much cheaper, and you get a chance to connect with the patient rather than pushing them to dealers who don't want them to stop.

true,democritusparadise,EURO,Ireland and USA,"Ireland is an interesting case because we don't have a definite day, but rather a series of dates in a spectrum.

On 18 September 1914 the Home Rule Act was passed which would have devolved a lot of important powers to Dublin from London, but it was postponed until the end of the war. However, it never came into force because on 24 April 1916 a band of hardline republicans declared independence and began the Easter Rising. 

This ended in defeat and had no popular mandate so it can't really be considered independence, but it is the date that many nationalists view as the spiritual independence day, and it can be viewed as the death of constitutional independence and the birth of mainstream militant republicanism.

The next date on the time line is 21 January 1919, when the first elected government, lead by Sinn Fein, unilaterally declared independence from the UK, sparking the Irish War of Independence. If we measured things the Greek way, this would be a strong contender for independence day but we don't...

The strongest single contender for Independence day IMO is 6 December 1922, the day the Anglo-Irish treaty came into force; this made the 26 southern counties into a British dominion with equal status to Canada, Australia and the other dominions. We still had the King as head of state though, which in the eyes of many meant we were not independent.

Two declarations from the UK further increased Irish sovereignty: the Balfour Declaration of 1926 which declared the United Kingdom and the Dominions to be ""autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations"". Just how free would be tested very shorty; and The Statute of Westminster of 11 December 1931, which is a British law that marked the end of the power of Westminster to legislate for the Dominions. This ending of the de jure power to directly control the dominions is an important milestone in Irish independence.

The penultimate step was during the British 1936 constitutional crisis, when the King abdicated. The Irish Free State used this chance to change its constitution (the new constitution coming into effect on 29 December 1937), removing all reference to the King and creating an elected President. While formally still a British dominion, removing all reference to the King and firing the Governor General, removing the right of Irish citizens to appeal to the Privy Council of the House of Lords and having our own Head of State was a de facto declaration of full independence, although the actual change the state underwent was minimal; after this, the only powers the King had in Ireland were signing Letters of Credence accrediting Irish ambassadors to other states and signing international treaties on Ireland's behalf. This was a very grey time in terms of constitutional law, with the strict legality of the move highly questionable; regardless, it happened, and for a time it wasn't entirely clear if Ireland was a republic outside the British Empire or not because it had all the trappings of one but hadn't declared itself one.

The final act was the Republic of Ireland Act, 18 April 1949 which declared Ireland a de jure republic and took us out of the Commonwealth. The reason it hadn't been declared earlier was that the government in power since the Statue Of Westminster was determined to wait to declare the republic until Northern Ireland was united with the south; obviously we'd still be waiting if they had their way. The new government had fewer qualms about that and got the ball rolling.

tl;dr: Important dates on the path to Irish independence:

18 September 1914 (de jure home rule, never implemented)

24 April 1916 (Easter Rising)

21 January 1919 (de jure independence bid, failed)

6 December 1922 (de facto autonomy/mostly independent, de jure dominion)

1926, October-November (de facto autonomy increases)

11 December 1931 (de jure and de facto autonomy increases)

29 December 1937 (de facto Republic, de facto full independence)

C'est vrai que la plupart des auto-école font comme ça, et c'est dommage, mais en même temps, mettre un moniteur pour faire un cours en salle augmenterait le prix du permis au final.

Et non, pas besoin, en même temps personne ne te force à apprendre le code dans une auto-école. Tu peut te rendre à la préfecture, et en plus ça ne te coutera qu'une enveloppe. 


&gt; Obligations légales de changer la voiture ou de la faire réparée ? 

Les deux. 

&gt; Parce que changer la voiture si il n'y a qu'une seule pièce à changer je suis désolé mais on se fout de ma gueule là.

Une pièce ? :D 
Le plus souvent ce sont des locations, donc avant de les rendre, il faut changer l'embrayage, les pneus et retirer le système de double commande, bref remettre la voiture en état. (Tu sais, les enjoliveurs qui touchent le trottoir, les rétros, la carrosserie qui a frottait la moitié des branches de la région etc....) 
Et quand ce sont des voitures achetées, c'est la même chose. Tu racheterais une voiture sérigraphiée auto-école mise en circulation il y a 5 ans toi ? 

&gt; Le fait qu'il utilise la voiture de l'auto école comme voiture personnelle devrait faire baisser le prix car c'est en parti un investissement personnel . 

Bah voyons, on va payer notre voiture de travail. Ca existe nul part ça, on est pas au qatar. 


&gt; Je suis désolé moi je me sens volé et arnaqué peut-être que pour toi 2000€ ce n'est rien 

Pour moi c'est à peu près un mois et 10 jours de travail, avec 25 heures supp placés sur des journées de 11 heures par ci par là. 

&gt; mais pour d'autre personnes dont je fais partie c'est énormément d'argent et moi ça me fait mal de sortir autant d'argent si on réfléchissait bien à la question on réussirait à diminuer le coût du permis.

Pour toi comme pour moi c'est 2000€ que tu vas investir pour l'ensemble de ta vie active, soit à peu près 50€ par an. 

Faire baisser le cout d'accord, des idées, il y en a qui ont déjà était mise en place: La conduite accompagnée, la conduite supervisée etc.
D'autre à l'étude, comme rendre le permis payant (genre 10€) pour embaucher plus d'inspecteurs et donc réduire le délai de re-passage et donc réduire les heures intermédiaire (mais ca sonne politiquement faux donc ca n'arrivera surement pas, dommage).

1. I think you do have to have a French bank account but do not quote me on this. The main reason I needed one was because I was doing it by direct debit per month. Maybe if you pay in a lump sum you do not need it. You will however definitely need a French bank account with an RB (releve d'identite bancaire) anyway so that should be top priority.

2. It took about 3 weeks for my Imagine R to arrive (last year). I have heard people who waited a bit longer. But I think this is largely the norm.

3. Whether you should get the Passe Navigo Decouverte. Depends entirely on how much travel you are doing. There is the ticket carnet which is about 13.70 Euros for 10 tickets which you can use in zones 1-2. If you think in a week you won't use more than that then just keep buying these carnets.Or another option is the velo lib and get bicycle until you get the navigo (however I think you still need a French account for this-actually I was wrong see xmarteo reply below).   

4. For me I couldn't do the navigo online but that was perhaps a problem just from last year maybe they have fixed it. 

My best advice is that so long as you manage to get a bank account open fairly quickly and send off immediately the Imagine R (I just got the form from the metro station) then do not bother with the Passe Navigo Decouverte. If it looks like that might be difficult then depending on the amount of travel you require maybe get it. But honestly with the Carnet of 10 tickets you are also in good stead.

&gt;

&gt;__Santa Maria della Spina__ is a small [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture) church in the [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) city of [Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa). The church, erected in 1230, was originally known as __Santa Maria di Pontenovo__: the new name of *Spina* (""thorn"") derives from the presence of a thorn allegedly part of the crown dressed by Christ on the Cross, brought here in 1333. In 1871 the church was dismantled and rebuilt on a higher level due to dangerous infiltration of water from the [Arno river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_river): the church was slightly altered in the process, however.

Il a eu des discours (notamment dans son premier passage sur On est pas couchés) excellent sur la question du nationalisme.

&gt; WOAH. CHANGE D'ÉTUDES TOUT DE SUITE. La franc-maçonnerie n'est pas une secte ésotérique loin de là. Retourne dans ta compagne. Limite je préfère les campagnards qui votent FN plutôt que des campagnards qui pensent comme ça. J'ai limite l'impression que t'es mythomane.

(Et tu dis que j'écris ""d'un air pétant"" ?) 

""Loin de là"" = Alors, faisons un petit tour sur Wikipédia, une ressource que l'on peut tous deux facilement consulter :

*La franc-maçonnerie [""prodigue un *enseignement ésotérique progressif* à l'aide de symboles et de rituels""](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franc-ma%C3%A7onnerie)*

(...) 

*On peut trouver ""une franc-maçonnerie « ésotérique », mettant l'accent sur le processus initiatique censé faire passer le membre des « ténèbres » extérieures à une « illumination » intérieure. Ce type de franc-maçonnerie se retrouve plutôt sur le continent européen, notamment dans leurs « Hauts grades maçonniques ».*

(...)

*Bien qu'elle ne propose pas à proprement parler une doctrine qui serait cachée aux non-initiés, la franc-maçonnerie est parfois considérée comme ésotérique dans sa pratique, dont certains aspects ne sont généralement pas révélés au public.*

*Plusieurs raisons ont été invoquées pour expliquer ces « secrets » :*

* *La maîtrise des pratiques tenues secrètes (par exemple la maîtrise de certaines gestuelles) sert de moyen de reconnaissance entre les francs-maçons.*
* *La franc-maçonnerie utilise, pour explorer les problèmes éthiques, un système d'initiation par degrés qui ne peut se concevoir qu'au moyen d'un enseignement et d'une révélation progressive.*
* *Elle s'est développée à un moment où le souvenir des guerres de religion et des persécutions religieuses étaient encore très présent dans les mémoires, et où il valait mieux se cacher pour parler librement de sujets sensibles.*

Ou peut-être que tu as aussi ""limite l'impression"" que Wikipédia est ""mythomane"" ? 
__________

&gt; Oui. C'est le regroupement d'intellectuels le plus ancien toujours en vie si je ne me trompe pas et c'est ce qui nous évite d'avoir une société construite avec du n'importe quoi. C'est une très bonne chose. 

Désolé, tu te trompes. Il n'y a en effet pas a beaucoup d'expertise dans ce que tu dis.

&gt; Ça nous permet de prolonger le mérite et le prestige intellectuel de la France, c'est ce qui empêche des gens au FN ou des mecs comme Dieudonné de monter en politique et de faire n'importe quoi.

Je te préviens tout bonnement et simplement - ne manges pas de leur propagande. Tu parles de ""mérite et prestige intellectuel"" - connais-tu alors les courants philosophiques et politiques de la Franc-Maçonnerie ? (C'est une question honnête - je ne souhaite pas te manquer de respect)

Et puis, tu admets même que la franc-maçonnerie empêcherait ""des gens au FN"" ou ""des mecs comme Dieudonné"" de ""monter en politique et de faire n'importe quoi"" - elle sont bien belles la *démocratie* et la *liberté d'expression* ! 

&gt; 14-18 et 39-45 n'ont pas été causées par les franc-maçons.

Je pense que tu m'as mal compris. Je ne dis pas que les franc-maçons ont causer ces guerres. Je dis que la France, depuis qu'Elle est devenue une République franc-maçonne, a été considérablement *affaiblie* et qu'elle est devenue de fait plus vulnérable aux invasions allemandes qui ont éventuellement ravager notre pays à plusieurs reprises ! 

&gt; Au contraire ils ont été très persécutés, des milliers se sont fait exécuter et embarqués en camps de concentration. 

Très persécutés ? Je ne le pense vraiment pas. Mais je ne nierais pas qu'ils aient été quelques fois persécutés. 

&gt; Jean-Luc Mélenchon n'est pas atlantiste. Inquiète toi plutôt sur l'américanisme omniprésent dans le journal de 20h ou dans l'Élysée. Ils sont presque tous atlantistes et franchement un mec de gauche presque communiste qui nous ponds des discours sur la France magnifiques, ça m'étonnerait qu'il veuille sympathiser avec les USA.

Io ho imparato conoscendo persone molto preparate che giocavano e vincevano. Inizialmente ero molto scettico, come penso siano molti di voi. Non avevo mai preso in considerazione che si potesse farne un profitto costante. Osservare persone che ci riuscivano mi ha aiutato molto a cambiare opinione, *se non vedo non credo*!

Welcome to the wonderful world of geopolitics. Why would we get involved in an unimportant country when they are such a wonderful puffer giving us a few days to prepare?

&gt; NATO exists for a reason.

Wrong tense. You was thinking of ""existed"". The reason for NATO ceased to exist in 1992.

&gt; USA wouldn't break an alliance

If you carefully read the North Atlantic Treaty, Article 5 says ""as it deems necessary"". That ambiguity is not by accident. If Poland is invaded, we deem it necessary to publically denounce the invasion as an act of aggression. And we wouldn't have broken the alliance.

That being said, the US has broken alliances left and right post-45. 

&gt; that the rest of the continent would operate the same way. 

They are free to do so. But they also know that any soldier they send to Poland will be missing in their respective state, and their sense of self-preservation is well-honed. They also know that if their little military adventure ends badly, someone got to pay ... and noone wants to pay the ferryman.

&gt; your country can barely keep spending on their military above 1%. 

We can - we just choose not to, because we know it's burnt money for no good results.

&gt; Having a highly trained military that is severely outnumbered is pointless. 

I agree. And as the two main threats to our country - Russia and the US - easily can provide more soldiers than we have citizens, it's a fools errand to train more. 

Smaller units have other advantages, though, as the US should have learned by now in their long series of unsuccessful military engagements post-45.

How many soldiers did the Viet Cong have in comparison the the US? How many Mujaheddin were there in comparison to the Red Army (great job on training them and giving them weaponry, btw. Worked out so wonderfully for you)? Size doesn't necessarily matter.

Bah tu t'attends à quoi ? T'es pas le premier qui nous arrive avec des idées ""révolutionaires"" pareilles... Les gens qui pensent que les politiciens sont des comédiens n'ont rien compris. Sors de ta campagne, ça te fera le plus grand bien.

&gt;Oui, il y a vraiment aucun indice ; et rien ne pourrait nous mettre la puce à l'oreille ! Que son père et son grand-père soient franc-maçons, Mr Mélanchon n'a donc pas de honte à l'admettre. Quant à lui, mais c'est une affaire privée, bon sang ! 

Tu fais de fausses assomptions. Nulle part il se revendique franc-maçon. Il a le droit de se réclamer de leurs idées (il suit la philosophie des Lumières qui fût fortement maniée par la franc-maçonnerie). C'est comme moi, ma famille est juive mais je ne suis pas religieux; j'aime la franc-maçonnerie mais je n'en fais pas partie.

De plus, Le Grand Orient de France est un lieu de conférences. Beaucoup de gens profanes sont venus faire des discours ou donner des conférences (Michel Onfray par exemple). Donc encore une fois, non rien ne prouve que Mélenchon est franc-maçon.

&gt;La ""théorique"" du comédien ? Oui bien sûr, Mr Mélanchon n'est certainement pas connu pour mettre trois couches de nutella sur ses tartines. 

Quel politicien ne fait pas ça... Quand tu es mis quasiment 24 heures sur 24 devant une caméra ou un micro et que ton objectif est de faire accepter tes idées par **tout le monde**, tu en mets des couches. Mais bon il faut être spectateur pour penser que ce sont des comédiens... Tu n'es pas allé de l'autre côté du rideau.

&gt;Oui, je vois bien qu'il réussit à ensorceler ! Et le peuple s'en fiche de son attitude - le peuple veut des solutions pour la crise. Ou peut-être que tu as déjà oublier ses résultats aux européennes ? 

La France, c'est soit le PS soit l'UMP. Aucun autre parti ne fera mieux et c'est pourquoi tous les autres font des résultats médiocres.

Vas-y, cite moi Wikipédia alors que les universités refusent de faire confiance à ce site. Cite moi le truc qui peut être édité par n'importe qui pour faire passer n'importe quel message. Si tu cherchais mieux et si tu lisais autre chose que Wikipédia sur la franc-maçonnerie peut-être que tu saurais de quoi tu parles.

&gt;Est-ce une secte ?

&gt;La Franc-Maçonnerie du Grand Orient de France est le contraire d'une secte :

&gt;Notre obédience est régulée par une constitution et un règlement général qui ont pour objet d'assurer à ses membres la liberté absolue de conscience, le respect total de l'autre et le fonctionnement le plus démocratique de nos structures qui va jusqu'à ne pas autoriser l'exercice d'un pouvoir au delà de trois années consécutives.
Chez nous point de ""gourou"" ou de parole révélée.
N'entre certes pas qui veut, mais tous ceux qui veulent partir le font sans contrainte.

&gt;Qu'est-ce qu'une obédience maçonnique ?Une obédience maçonnique regroupe des francs-maçons autour d'une charte spécifique qui les singularise des autres maçons sur des points tels que la masculinité exclusive de ses membres ou la féminité voire la mixité.
D'autres critères peuvent être énoncés tels l'obligation de croire en un Dieu.

&gt;Pourquoi être ou devenir Franc-Maçon de la GLDF aujourd’hui ? 

&gt;Pour se construire et s’épanouir dans l’existence, à la fois dans la réflexion et l’action.  Vivre c’est réfléchir et agir, concevoir et réaliser, donner et construire un sens à sa vie et contribuer à l’évolution positive du monde qui nous entoure . On peut trouver du sens dans des convictions parfois dogmatiques et des idéologies parfois réductrices. Mais on peut aussi vouloir dépasser les standards et les prêts à penser de toutes sortes et de toutes origines. À ceux qui sont en recherche de conception et de construction de sens, la Grande Loge de France propose une démarche originale : l’initiation. Il s’agit donc par l’initiation :  - de se construire soi-même pour construire le sens de sa vie  **Le but de la Franc-maçonnerie et de la Grande Loge de France est de donner un espace de réflexion et d’action à des hommes qui souhaitent construire un sens à leur vie en complétant sans jamais contredire ce qu’ils édifient par ailleurs dans leur cadre familial, professionnel ou relationnel. - de le faire en exerçant sa liberté de conscience religieuse et citoyenne tout en respectant celle des autres.** Il s’agit d’une démarche d’absolue liberté  de conscience religieuse et de conscience citoyenne : **la Grande Loge n’oblige à la croyance ou à la pratique - ni n’interdit la croyance ou pratique - d’aucune religion, philosophie ou courants de pensée particuliers. De même elle ne se revendique d’aucune position politique particulière.** 

&gt;Elle respecte  donc toutes les sensibilités religieuses ou politiques. **Elle refuse en revanche, en son sein, le prosélytisme religieux de ceux qui voudraient pousser les autres vers leur propre foi** car elle souhaite ne contraindre la conscience d’aucun d’entre eux.  De même elle refuse la pratique d’un prosélytisme antireligieux de ses membres qui contraindrait là aussi leur liberté de conscience. Sur le plan  politique elle accepte l’expression de toutes les idées qui respectent la liberté de conscience citoyenne de ses membres, excluant par nature les extrémismes de tous bords qui sont incompatibles avec ses principes fondamentaux de respect et de dignité des êtres humains, quelles que  soient leur origine ethnique ou culturelle. - de travailler dans un espace ordonné à des valeurs éthiques Elle n’est pas  une école de pensée unique mais un espace de liberté ordonné à des  valeurs humanistes et spirituelles, permettant de rassembler des hommes de toutes origines ethniques et situations sociales, philosophies et religions, en leur apprenant, au travers d’une méthode initiatique originale et spécifique, à se construire, s’améliorer, réfléchir et agir à la fois individuellement et collectivement, dans ses temples et dans la société, dans l’estime, le respect et la tolérance mutuels. 

-Site web de la Grande Loge de France

Alors oui il y a des symboles et des rituels mais cela fait partie de la culture maçonnique. Ça ne fait pas d'elle une secte ou une entité lobotomisante.

Le rite d'initiation d'un membre est tenu secret car sinon ce serait connaître le contenu du cadeau avant de l'avoir ouvert. De plus, ce ne sont pas toutes les loges qui ont des tendances ésotériques. Certaines ont des rituels, sont rattachées au christianisme et aux valeurs et que sais-je des Templiers, d'autres sont tout à fait normales et servent de lieu de discussion, d'échange ou de partage d'activités sociales.

&gt;Désolé, tu te trompes. Il n'y a en effet pas a beaucoup d'expertise dans ce que tu dis.

Preuve ? Même si ce n'est pas le plus ancien, c'est le plus important. Mozart, Napélon, Nietzsche, Marx, les Lumières, etc. Tu ne peux pas nier que la F. M. a apporté une contribution colossale à nôtre société et nous sommes tous heureux de pouvoir marcher dans la rue sans se faire attaquer ou bombarder comme ailleurs. Il n'y a pas de ""théories"" maçonniques puisque c'est un lieu de débats et de réflexions. Comme cité plus haut, la maçonnerie de force personne à adhérer à quelque idée que ce soit (ou presque; il y a des exceptions).

&gt;- elle sont bien belles la démocratie et la liberté d'expression !

Je préfère ça plutôt que d'avoir du bordel monstrueux dans nôtre pays. C'est pas toi qui défendait la loyauté et la sainteté? Tu les suis bien tes contradictions...

Pour ce qui est du contexte et de l'interprétation... Penses-tu que la majorité des musulmans à travers le monde ont accès à une exégèse et une analyse historique solide du Coran ? On répète toujours qu'il faut lire le Coran dans le texte, car traduire c'est trahir, mais là aussi, quelle est la proportion de musulmans qui sont capables de comprendre les subtilités du vieil arabe utilisé dans le Coran ?

Enfin, j'ai tendance à me méfier des intellectuels musulmans bien intentionnés qui te disent que tel verset violent et brutal correspond à un contexte historique précis qui atténue sa violence, ou que tel verset qui incite à battre sa femme est en fait mal compris parce que le mot arabe utilisé ne signifie *pas tout à fait* ""battre""...

Cela part d'une bonne intention, mais souvent l'analyse qu'ils développent peut être très récente et contredire des siècles de tradition juridique et exégétique musulmane. Parfois, ils ne sont d'ailleurs qu'une poignée d'intellectuels à partager cette interprétation ""éclairée"" de l'islam.

- You shouldn't confuse Attican Greek, ethnic history with Mediterranean, Greek-speaking history. Hellenistic and Byzantine history really had comparatively little to do with Attica- in fact during both time periods, the original Greek city-states are pretty much rural backwaters- and certainly modern-day Greece is not entitled to that history. And that's the history that begins with Alexander, who as in fact from a nation not recognized by the Classical Greeks as Greek.

- People *are* being bullied. To Greeks this may be about dick-waving and who can out-historically-revise the other, but to Macedonians there are real long-term economic consequences, and have been since Greece began this campaign of harassment 20+ years ago.

- Well, yes, you do have to explain the trouble that it causes, to an American living in America which is also part of the Americas. Sometimes naming conventions overlap and get confusing- especially when that name is thousands of years old! You might as well require Greece rename itself the Former Ottoman Province of South Attican Greece, since the historical region of Greece has been much larger at times. Or, you could make it The Former Roman Territories of Greece, Thessaly, Thrace and Southern Epirus since Greece has expanded well beyond the Classical Greek boundaries before Phillip II's conquests.

&gt;The racial policy of Nazi Germany was a set of policies and laws implemented by Nazi Germany, asserting the superiority of the ""Aryan race"", and based on a specific racist doctrine which claimed scientific legitimacy. It was combined with a eugenics programme that aimed for racial hygiene by using compulsory sterilizations and extermination of the Untermenschen (or ""sub-humans""), and which eventually culminated in the Holocaust. These policies targeted peoples, in particular Jews, as well as Gypsies, homosexuals and handicapped people, ethnic Poles,[1] Russians[2] who were labeled as ""inferior"" in a racial hierarchy that placed the Herrenvolk (or ""master race"") of the Volksgemeinschaft (or ""national community"") at the top, and ranked Russians, Romani, Serbs, Poles, persons of color and Jews at the bottom.[2][3][4][5]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_policy_of_Nazi_Germany


&gt;Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring (Ger. Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses) or ""Sterilisation Law"" was a statute in Nazi Germany enacted on July 14, 1933, (and made active in January 1934)[1] which allowed the compulsory sterilisation of any citizen who in the opinion of a ""Genetic Health Court"" (Gr. Erbgesundheitsgericht) suffered from a list of alleged genetic disorders - many of which were not, in fact, genetic. The elaborate interpretive commentary on the law was written by three dominant figures in the racial hygiene movement: Ernst Rüdin, Arthur Gütt and the lawyer Falk Ruttke.

Sospettati. Ci sono state rivendicazioni da parte del PKK?

Insomma su, linkami la roba recente e fai meno il chiacchierone. Che ci vuole? Mi faresti anche un favore eh.

&gt;E ti sfugge che il ""cambio"" (dal comunismo al meno comunismo) è del 1999, mentre il cessate il fuoco è dell'anno scorso: ammetterai che non basta questa dichiarazione per renderli all'improvviso della brava gente.
Fai conto che solo nel 2012, che in termini politici è davvero l'altro ieri, sono morte un mezzo migliaio di persone. Tu ti fideresti di gente del genere? Seriamente?

Ci sono stati attacchi interni fra parti, divisioni, scioglimenti. Il discorso non è fidarsi o no, il discorso è che è così e basta. Non c'è mai un punto chiaro nei movimenti di sinistra, ne devi far parte per capire di più, ma è impossibile capirli appieno. La pace si può e si deve raggiungere, sopratutto se la Turchia smette di attaccarli.

Se fino a prima hanno attaccato dei civili, è ovvio che c'era un'idea sbagliata dietro. Ma è troppo facile condannare SOLO il PKK. Oltre agli altri movimenti curdi, anche la Turchia va condannata. Dipendesse da me, sarebbero da giudicare (non mi riferisco ai tribunali statali eh) sia gli esponenti del PKK che hanno ucciso dei civili, sia tutti gli altri. Dimmi tu come fare però, se trovi il modo io ti appoggio.

&gt;Comunque notevole che per te ammazzare gente sia ""fare cazzate"".

Se sono militari non mi scende certo la lacrimuccia, è il loro lavoro e non è che i turchi ci sono andati leggeri coi civili curdi; piuttosto se sono civili mi dispiace eccome.

Mein Name ist George Haller und ich bin halb Schweizer, halb Amerikaner. Ich wurde 1996 in Zürich geboren und bin 17 Jahre alt. In meiner Freizeit treffe ich gerne Freunde, spiele Videospiele und höre Musik. Ich habe 5 Geschwister, von denen ich der Zweitjüngste bin. 

Mein Lieblingsessen ist Italienisch, was ich nicht mag ist scharfes Essen. Ich bin nicht soooo sportlich, fahre aber jeden Tag mit dem Velo von Wädenswil zur Schule, was ich sehr entspannend finde, weil ich dabei gute Musik hören kann und die Einsamkeit auch seinen Reiz hat. Am Wochenende lehne ich mich gerne etwas zurück, gehe in die Badi oder lese ein gutes Buch.

Meine Traumpartnerin sollte ungefähr so alt wie ich, aber etwas kleiner als ich sein. Ich stehe übrigens auf Brünette. Sie sollte lustig, intelligent, nett und ein wenig träumerisch sein. Ich lache gerne und ein guter Witz geht immer. Ich bin ein kleiner Cineast, es wäre also gut, wenn sie auch gerne Filme schaut, Spazieren geht und Velo fährt. Sportlich sein ist mir nicht so wichtig. Ich will nicht zu viel sagen, da man nie weiß, was das Leben für einen bereithält. Ich bin offen für das, was auf mich zukommt.

- Man geht anscheinend *in die Badi*

- In Kontaktanzeigen redet man die Damen eher mit ""du"" an, als mit ihnen in der dritten Person zu kommunizieren - das lässt sich leicht ändern, sag Bescheid.

Remember this a yearly pass so you will have to pay for a complete year (even if this is payed on a monthly basis). As a student you can choose to begin your year on the 1st of September, October, November, December of January. Even if you end up paying for a few months you won't use, this is probably still the cheapest pass you will get.

You won't be compensated for the tickets you use during the 21 days waiting time, but if they take longer than that, you are eligible for a reimbursement (so carefully keep your proofs of payment after those 21 days !).


You can subscribe either with a paper form available in the stations or online at http://www.imagine-r.com/forfait/souscrire.aspx.

I don't know about the French bank account, there is nothing specifically about it on the web site. They have a section about SEPA which could imply that they accept payment from a European Bank account but this is definitely not a guarantee from me.

I've dug the website for you and I've seen there is also the possibility to pay by check. If you choose this method, you will end up paying the total for the year in one check. Still no word about the check being from a French bank account (but we can safely guess it has to be in Euro).

My advice is to subscribe to the website now (with your email address). This should allow you to make a first attempt with the online subscription to the pass for 2014/2015: even if you don't have all papers right away, at least this way you will know what you will need once you arrive in order not to loose too much time with this.

Your university/school should be able to help you with that as all their students deal with this situation. The RATP people in stations are also very friendly and helpful... just make sure to avoid crowded hours if you want quality information.

As /u/fireflylikeslights said, what you will use during the waiting time depends on the frequency and type of travels you will need.

You sound like those social justice warriors who spend their time memorising retorts but don't really understand how to apply them. 

If you were talking about Russia invasion and I retorted, oh but so and so also annexed a country, out of the blue, now that is whataboutism. 

This is completely different. This is an article about precisely about the dynamics between Washington and Russia that based on spheres of influence. It notes that should Washington try to expand its influence over to Ukraine, Russia won't just sit and watch. 

To read that article and isolate Russia in your comment, shows you don't get it. The article is not about Putins view of the world. The article is about the world as it is.

Veramente sì, ma vediamo la [fonte](http://www.voanews.com/content/turkey-iran-to-cooperate-against-kurdish-rebels-132316303/170915.html) di quell'[estratto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers%27_Party):

E niente, non c'è scritto praticamente niente riguardo un attacco, rivendicato, del PKK. Se non questo:

&gt;Turkey launched the offensive against the Kurdish militants after a series of PKK attacks Wednesday killed 24 soldiers.

Niente civili, a quanto dice qui.

&gt;Kurdish rebels have waged a campaign for autonomy in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast since 1984. The fighting has killed more than 40,000 people. Turkey, the United States, and the European Union regard the PKK as a terrorist group.

Dal 1984. In pratica è un riassunto.

&gt;**PKK rebels killed four individuals in bombings in Istanbul on March 31-April 2, 2006.**


&gt;In Istanbul, a bomb placed in a trash can near a bus 
stop on March 31 resulted in one death.  On April 2, a bus 
was attacked by molotov cocktails, resulting in the death of 
a bus passenger as well as two by-standers who were run over 
by the inflamed bus.  That same day, protests in Istanbul's 
Taksim Square turned violent.  Capitalizing on the civil 
unrest, the Kurdish Freedom Falcons (TAK) on April 3 issued a 
statement that said it would attack tourist areas throughout 
the country and warned foreign tourists to stay away.  A 
second TAK statement called on Kurdish youth to volunteer for 
attacks against state institutions and personnel.

Di nuovo sembra che i TAK ne hanno responsabilità.

true,normaltypetrainer,advanced-other,advanced (English / PA Dutch),"Think about the difference between ""he"" and ""him""; they are two forms of the masculine third person plural but the different forms are used to convey certain semantic functions. Now English doesn't have case and the difference between ""he"" and ""him"" (or ""I"" and ""me""; ""she"" and ""her"") isn't exactly the same as say the difference between nom. and akk. but it can help you understand the concept in general b/c it is similar.


We say ""I see **him**"". ""I"" and ""him"" are used to convey the relationship of the words to the verb. Namely that ""I"" is the subject (doing the seeing) and ""him"" is the direct object (being seen). Now in English we often simply use word order to do this ""The man sees the dog."" where the forms ""the man"" and ""the dog"" do not really have separate forms depending on the function#. German differs here as all nouns have different forms (or declensions) that convey information about their semantic function 

*Der Mann sieht den Hund.* ""Der Mann"" is nom. (think ""he"" form) and the dog is akk. (think ""him"" form) thus in this sentence word order isn't important to understanding the meaning: *Den Hund sieht der Mann.* ""The dog sees the man"" literally but the meaning is still ""The man sees the dog."" b/c the dog being in akk. case and the man being in nom. case tells the speaker ""hey the dog is receiving the action and the man is doing the action"". Think about the poetic ""Him, I see"" the word order is unusual but you can easily understand that ""him"" is the one that is being seen (and that ""I"" is the one that is seeing).


However, many people get confused b/c German is sometimes restricted by word order. *Die Frau sieht die Katze.""* if switched around ""Die Katze sieht die Frau"" changes meaning much the same as in English although just because two categories happen to be the same doesn't mean they aren't still there. There is a feminine akk. it's just the same as the nom. and thus word order clarifies (think about English ""you"" vs ""you"" i.e. *I love you, you love me*.)


However case goes beyond this in what it can convey. E.g. the akk. is used for direct time ""Diesen Herbst reise ich nach Deutschland."" And with either/or prepositions it can convey motion, etc.

# Another analogy that might help is the Saxon genitive in English (which technically isn't a noun case but let's forget that for a second). So ""the man"" and ""the dog"" can change form in a way to convey information about their relationship: the man**'s** dog; the dog**'s** owner. Specifically it conveys that one noun possessive the other. The only reason this isn't considered a true genitive case is because it modifies whole noun phrases instead of nouns: ""the girl in the blue car's sunglasses"" not: ""the girl's in the blue car sunglasses""


tl;dr: **Grammatical cases is the declension of nouns into categories that convey information about the relationship between nouns and other words in sentences.**",0,1408909814,null,0,1408910073,0,cjzc2z7,t3_2efnqj,t1_cjzc2z7,t3_2efnqj,null,1427378341,3,false,German,t5_2qq51,3

true,totitiganiisuntgunoi,ROMA,Romania,"What is especially tragic about this debacle is that it appears almost inconceivable that a truly satisfactory solution to this issue will appear in the foreseeable future. The reason is that the way Europe deals with the issue of these migrants is inherently disingenuous and is emblematic of Europe's tension between lofty values and self-serving pragmatism. 

After all, deep down the issue is that a large number of the migrants seeking to cross into Europe can legitimately argue that they are persecuted and in need of asylum. For example, many of the migrants originate from [Eritrea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrea), a quasi-totalitarian African state many of whose citizens are constantly persecuted and who would face even greater hardships if they were forced to return to the country after fleeing it for their own safety and well-being. Now the irony is that while in principle Europe recognizes that these migrants would have a right to asylum in Europe, deep down nobody wants such refugees to reach their borders in large numbers. Although part of the rationale for this hesitation may be rooted in xenophobia, there is also an extremely compelling argument that allowing an unchecked stream of refugees would simply overwhelm the social services of European states and would more broadly be a huge disturbance to the entire social structure.

Because of such considerations, the practical solution European states have come up with is to simply bar the entrance of such migrants into their country, ideally by stopping them from embarking on the dangerous journey to reach European shores in the first place. However, such policies, which usually necessitate the cooperation of the coastal African states from which the migrants usually depart is virtually hopeless in the face of an almost continuous stream of African migrants who know that as soon as they reach European soil they will immediately fall into Europe's protective humanitarian shield and finally have the chance to a better life. 

In some sense European policies while largely rooted in good intentions create the worst possible scenario. On the one hand they offer African asylum seekers few practical legal paths to seek shelter in Europe while they are still in Africa, but then offer them automatic and full protection once they reach Europe, even if they did so illegally. The natural result of such policies is to constantly offer a strong incentive to Africans to attempt the risky illegal journey across the sea, as a result of which thousands die and will continue to die every year.",0,1408909853,null,0,false,0,cjzc3lw,t3_2egkx5,t1_cjzc3lw,t3_2egkx5,null,1427378332,30,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,30

But there was never any statutory limit imposed, or even guidelines for imposing such a limit.  So the promises to the world became completely open-ended.

So American loyalty has limits. Good to know. I wonder how far US involvement in NATO would go if it's ""only Poland"" who would get the pointy end of the stick.

&gt; USSR WAS NOT AN ALLY

Hahahahahahahahahaha, yeah, right. They even were members of a group called ""The Allieds"" as compared to ""The Axis"". 

&gt;  Saddam was not an ally either the second he started invading other countries. 

Hahahaha, yeah, right. You mean countries other than Iran. Countries that the US kinda promised him. Until he no longer was useful.

So US loyalty is dependant on usefulness of the ally. Good to know. 

&gt; Budapest memo? They promised to respect Ukraine.

But that's the fun right? The videos always focus on the accidents since they present the most enjoyable viewing experience and do not necessarily reflect the reality during Touristenfahrten.

You certainly should ask the rental company beforehand (or read the contract very thoroughly which is not advised if your are not a native speaker and know the technical terms). Be aware that you certainly risk your deductible, so you might want to consider to get some additional insurance to lower that to 150€ instead of 3000+€. And please don't get the idea of driving you Sixt-Rental car on the track, use a company that explicitly allows the use on the ring or rent one at the Nürburgring itself (~100€ per round with 2,9k deductible) USeful website: http://www.nurburgring.org.uk/carhire.php

I would also advise using a car you are comfortable driving around... Otherwise your chances of crashing into something when your car to the limit are certainly bigger.

Also ProTip: If you live near the Track just drive over there during Touristenfahrten and ask around if someone is willing to give you a ride around the track.

But practical realities are always nearby.  A prosperous, orderly, and cohesive society rarely happens by accident or coincidence.  They are usually the product of underlying factors which include social stability and social trust.

I have seen enough evidence - theoretical and personal - to understand that the mass-importation of outsiders is generally damaging to the recipient society.  

So the fundamental question returns to something very basic - what is the purpose of a nation in the first place?  I would hope it is to protect the interests and welfare of its own citizens.  Asylum/immigration/migration policy has to be interpreted through that fundamental goal.

If those policies undermine the interests of a nation's citizens, then obviously they should be modified.

This is the way to go if you are still in Germany, OP.  
The cost for this will be roughly ~5-7 Euro (back when I worked at a Sparkasse 2 years ago) and is much cheaper than an international banktransfer outside of the EU bounds.

The BVG has local accounts at the Berliner Sparkasse and Postbank based on a quick search. If you do the Barüberweisung at one of the Sparkasse branches, you are likely to get away with 1/2 of the additional fees, not sure how the Postbank handles this.

true,SteveMcQwark,CANA,Canada,"If the relationship between the ""federated"" members and the central government can be unilaterally altered by the central government, then you have a decentralized unitary state and not a federation. In order to create a federation, you need to create a class of legislation that can only be changed with the consent of the affected members of the federation, so that each member has a say in any changes which affect its relationship with the whole. Such legislation is typically called a constitution, and may also contain further provisions dealing with matters of shared interest between one or more members and the central government, along with legislative procedures appropriate for altering these provisions.

One way to achieve this in the UK would be to make the various national assemblies into Houses of Parliament, and then create a structure of special legislative procedures and devolved parliaments composed of the appropriate Houses of Parliament for handling the ordinary legislation of the central and member governments. Constitutionalism would thus fall naturally out of parliamentary supremacy.

Of course, the simpler approach, which would create something like a federation, if not true federalism, is to continue as is, and simply use rules of construction to ensure central legislation doesn't accidentally infringe on the jurisdictions of devolved governments. This was effective in granting independence to the Dominions, but I'm not sure it would be effective in creating a federal structure within a single state with a tradition of parliamentary supremacy.",0,1408915896,null,0,1408938025,0,cjzeun3,t3_2egelh,t1_cjzeun3,t1_cjzdyto,null,1427377038,6,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,6

Usually there are some marches in bigger cities, people leaving flowers at soldiers graves, nationalists and antifacists are fighting in Warsaw, it usually is raining as well. I mean it is November. 

[Constitution Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_3rd_Constitution_Day) - 3 May. Marches around the country and people having BBQs because it's a long weekend. On the 1st of May we celebrate Labour Day(Although it's not call Labour Day any more, it's *State Holiday* now), and the 2nd of May is a Flag Day, which technically is a normal working day. As it's sunny no one is fighting and it's just much happier holiday.

[Armed Forces Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces_Day) - 15 August. Well it's a public holiday because on that day Catholic Church celebrates the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. As it's Armed Forces Day there's a big army parade in Warsaw. Oh, why do we celebrete our Armed Forces Day on that particular day you ask? Because on that day in 1920 we kicked [Bolshevik/Russian/Soviet asses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920)).

So these are official public holidays, but except that we also ""celebrate"" 4th of June - a day that our first, almost completely democratic elections after the WWII took placed in 1989, officially it's called the Day of Freedom and Civil Rights, but I doubt anyone knows about it. 31st of August - Day of Solidarity and Freedom, set on the anniversary of August Agreement from 1980. if you're interested in more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Poland",0,1408916642,null,0,false,0,cjzf6m1,t3_2efmzv,t1_cjzf6m1,t3_2efmzv,null,1427376883,3,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,3

One part is that Scandinavia doesn't have the same kind of intensely local and varied brewing tradition as places like Belgium or Germany, so I think that, like in the USA, the microbrewers are very ""experimental"", rather than traditional. There are many old breweries, but they mostly produce quite similar lagers, in my opinion not that different from Carlsberg. Exceptions include [hvidtøl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hvidt%C3%B8l#Hvidt.C3.B8l), an ""indigenous"" style (but no longer popular), and [some excellent](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/thisted-limfjords-porter/7357/) Baltic-style porters.

But from the late '90s and especially early 2000s, Danish homebrewers started being active in online microbrew forums (which have lots of Americans on them), exchanging recipes, etc., and tending towards the ""extreme"" styles that are popular among American homebrewers, like ultra-hoppy double IPAs, imperial stouts that pour like crude oil, unusual spice combinations, etc. Some of them then started companies, which also pursue similar styles: IPAs based on [""west coast"" American hops](http://www.nogne-o.com/special-brews/double-hop-ipa.html), [""big"" stouts](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/amager-imperial-stout/78118/), [weird combinations](http://mikkeller.dk/mikkeller-bar/), etc. Some (especially Mikkeller) have also been successful exporting to American ""beer geek"" bars (especially [this beer](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/mikkeller-beer-geek-breakfast/53853/) won awards around 2005–06), which further strengthens the connections.

true,Win5ton67,null,null,"&gt; Avant tout, je tiens à te dire que je vais systématiquement passer outre les phrases que tu prononces qui me semblent utiliser des mots dont la définition est extrêmement vague scientifiquement (« forme », « essence », etc.). Je ne veux pas te manquer de respect, mais j'ai déjà essayé, notamment avec l'un de mes plus proches amis qui est Chrétien, et c'est simplement au-dessus de mes forces. Mais même si l'on ne discute pas des principes métaphysiques qui sous-tendent ton point de vue, je serais intéressé par leurs implications concrètes, si tu veux bien en discuter.

Je te comprends tout à fait et je ne le verrais pas comme un manque de respect ! Je serais tout aussi intéressé d'en discuter (dans la deuxième partie de ce message notamment). Il y a cependant quelques éléments qu'il faudrait avant tout clarifier. Car quand on se penche sur ces questions, et j'espère que ça ne te fâchera pas, on ne peut tout simplement pas échapper à la métaphysique ! Je vais tenter de m'expliquer sans digresser. 

La question de l'origine de l'univers est fascinante; mais elle ne peut tout simplement pas être réglée sur des bases physiques ou chimiques, c'est une question métaphysique. Ce n'est pas une question de ""preuve"" au sens physicaliste, mais du bien-fondé d'un argument logique. Et cet argument n'est pas destiné à être ""prédictif"" (comme dans le sens d'une ""prédiction dynamique""), il n'est pas dépendant d'une expérimentation, mais il est tout à fait *rationnel*. 

Il n'y a en effet rien dans l'univers qui nous expliquerait le ""*à être*"" même de l'univers. C'est précisément pour cela que nous devons passer d'un mode d'analyse scientifique et empirique à la métaphysique. La ""science"" en elle-même ne peut répondre à la question philosophique la plus fondamentale : ""*Pourquoi y a-t-il quelque chose plutôt que rien ?*"" 

(Comment les mathématiques, par exemple, pourraient-elles nous aider à comprendre la nature de la moralité, ce qui fait qu'une œuvre d'art soit belle, ce qui constitue une vraie amitié, etc. ? On ne pourrait tout simplement pas faire un tel réductionnisme.) 

La question fondamentale est donc résolument non-scientifique. C'est pourquoi des personnes comme Aristote (et même plus récemment encore Hegel, Leibniz, Heidegger ou Whitehead) tenait à la métaphysique, à ce qui est littéralement au-delà de la physique. La philosophie pose en effet des questions et répond à des questions qualitativement différentes que celles dont les sciences peuvent s'occuper. 

&gt; Tu parles de Big Bang dans ta réponse à Frensoa : les premiers instants du Big Bang correspondent à peu près à ce que tu appelles « une sorte de ""suspension"" » de matière (plasma quark-gluon mais n'entrons pas dans les détails). Pour toi, Dieu intervient avant mais aussi après le Big Bang pour fournir ce que tu appelles les formes ? En dirigeant l'agencement de la matière par exemple ?

Les formes ne pourraient qu'être ""fournies"" et connues au moment même où elles sont unifiées à la matière, au moment même où tel être *est*. La ""matière"" en soi du chat du voisin n'existait donc tout simplement pas avant - car le chat est justement ce *chat* grâce à sa propre matière et forme qui l'unifie en un *être*. Dans ce sens, si j'ai bien saisi l'intérêt dans ta question, on pourrait dire que Dieu ""intervient"" et ""dirige l'agencement de la matière"", car Il créé alors toute créature et toute chose en tout instant présent. 
________

En fait, il faut d'abord partir du principe ""*ex nihilo nihil fit*"" (il n'y a rien qui vient du rien). Principe métaphysique, où le ""*nihil*"" en question veut dire le ""non-être absolu"". L'univers n'est donc pas venu de rien; il vient de Dieu, qui n'a pas utiliser une matière ou une substance pré-existante pour le créer. C'est dans ce sens que l'univers a été créé ""*ex nihilo*"". 

Les évènements dans ces ""premiers instants du Big Bang"" (où l'on pourrait voir, comme tu le dis, une « une sorte de ""suspension"" » de matière, ""plasma quark-gluon"", etc.), se déroulent dans un ensemble circonscrit de conditions qui les rendent possibles. Ils ont alors une ""cause"" dans le sens classique du terme. La question proprement métaphysique est donc "" Pourquoi y aurait-il (du tout) un tel ensemble de conditions ? "".  

Si les scientifiques ou les cosmologistes peuvent analyser et mesurer des évènements et des objets dans l'univers (le Big Bang inclus), ils ne peuvent pas commencer à expliquer ""l'être"" de l'univers, pourquoi il y a quelque chose plutôt que rien. Ils peuvent décrire comment des évènements se déroulent dans le cosmos; ils ne peuvent expliquer pourquoi il y a quelque chose en premier lieu. 

Certains physiciens d'aujourd'hui parlent alors d'un univers qui serait sorti ""à partir de rien"". Cependant, quand ils parlent de ""rien"", ils veulent signifier un *vide quantique fluctuant*. Alors que les métaphysiciens parlent du ""rien"" comme un ""non-être absolu"". La physique quantique, elle, ne parle pas d'un ""rien"" dans un sens absolu mais plutôt d'un *vide fluctuant*, duquel émerge une mer féconde d'énergie. Les cosmologistes parlent aussi d'un *vide fluctuant* qui est fécond d'une possibilité créative. 

Or tout ce qui fluctue et donne lieu à de nouvelles formes d'êtres est, par définition, une réalité contingente, réalité qui a donc besoin d'être expliquée. Dit autrement, ce *vide quantique fluctuant*, marqué par une énorme fécondité ontologique, est lui-même un état contingent qui nécessite une explication.  

Le Big Bang ne peut alors être une transition du ""non-être"" à ""l'être"", mais il est plutôt la transition d'une singularité à un cosmos en expansion. Il nécessite donc aussi son explication. 
________


Enfin, la contingence de la ""matière"" suit de son infinie malléabilité. Il faut que l'on explique n'importe quel état dans lequel la matière se trouve, car elle pourrait être en une variété infinie d'autres états. Elle pourrait être une certaine couleur, à une certaine vélocité, en une certaine position, mais elle pourrait être une toute autre couleur ou à une toute autre vélocité, ou en une position complètement différente. Le résultat est que son état actuel des choses doit être expliqué en faisant appel à une cause extrinsèque. En un mot, la matière est *contingente*.

(D'ailleurs, la théorie même du Big Bang montre que ""l'espace"" et le ""temps"" sont eux-mêmes contingents, car c'est à ce moment particulier qu'ils ont vu le jour) 

On voit alors que l'on revient toujours à cette question fondamentale qui est aussi métaphysique, philosophique que théologique : ""Pourquoi y a-t-il quelque chose plutôt que rien ?"" 

Et l'on pourrait tout bonnement oublier la question de ""l'univers"" ou de la ""matière"". Il suffit de se demander : ""Pourquoi est-ce que j'existe ?

true,MartelFirst,FRAN,France,"I'm kind of shocked by this though. I never heard of this prejudice, and I always considered that French standards were quite high. Agriculture is viewed as a noble pursuit, with the quality and health of products a constant preoccupation here. I'd even call it one of France's thing. This preoccupation for quality, natural products. Otherwise politically and culturally, France is one of the leading nations against GMOs and pesticide use.

If you take the car through French countrysides, you'll see cows grazing in large fields everywhere, with plenty of space for them to move around. Nothing like the stereotypical cow factory farms I imagine in the US. Also remember that France has a much lower density than countries like Britain, Italy and whatnot. France has quite a lot of room for farmland, and uses it.

My parents live in Normandy so I've seen a lot of the countryside, and when a harvest is bad, farmers burn their entire field down. The reason they do that is because they get financial compensation in exchange, if they decide their harvest is bad enough to be unsellable. Some farmers abuse this, and at the slightest poor harvest they'll just say it's bad and burn it all down. One can criticize the waste of food, but the end result is that a bad harvest, or poor quality harvest, rarely gets sold. Farmers would rather destroy it and start anew next year with a fertilized soil. ",0,1408917470,null,0,false,0,cjzfjq7,t3_2efsqa,t1_cjzfjq7,t1_cjzf43m,null,1427376713,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

I haven't been following the news this week, so this will just be a few select items - and sorry that I couldn't be bothered with links, but I didn't find english sources for most of these stories.

- The Rullepølse scandal is still going on, as even more companies find Listeria in their products.

- The extension on the Copenhagen Metro will be 1,2 Billion kroner more expensive, and will take an additional 7 months to complete.

- The construction site of one of the new metrostations became unstable and a nearby building had to be evacuated due to danger of collapse.

- The waterpark Lalandia has received two bombthreads.

- In what can only be called pre-election ruminations, there is an ongoing discussion about the altered unemployment benefit rules: The new rules where made back in the hay-days right before the crisis, cutting the benefit period from four down to two years. It has affected many more people than initially thought and will probably become a major issue in the upcoming election - that is unless there is a majorities of parties who agree on a reform beforehand.

- A collection of 55 jars containing different species of crustaceans that Darwin had borrowed from the Danish Zoological museum in 1854 was unearthed by museum officials. Along with the collection was a list written in Darwin’s own hand identifying the species. 

- Marmite is now finally legal in Denmark.

- It's been rather cold this week.

*update:*
