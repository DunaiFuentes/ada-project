You can already buy a Nissan Leaf for €24k if you want, which is why it's outselling Tesla's Model S. Now you'll say the Model S is more luxurious and has a wider range, and you'd be right, but consider this:

The price difference between the 60KWh model to the 85kWh one gives us a cost of about €400/kWh for the batteries, which seems about right. By that measure, the Model S is a €40k car with some very expensive batteries. This is comparable to a 5 Series BMW.  
Tesla guarantees 200k km for their 60kWh batteries. At €400/kWh, that's 12 cents per km to pay for the batteries compared to an ICE model. At 0.2375kWh/km (twice as much as the VW e-Golf!) and 20 cent/kWh (average EU consumer prices), that another 4.75 cents/km, so €16.75 per 100km, or almost exactly what you'd pay for a car that needed 10l/100km. Said 5 Series BMW uses less than that.

The established manufacturers could put more batteries into their electric models if they wanted to, they'll just stick to the ""city car"" commuter market until battery prices have come down enough for them to be able to sell such models in volume. Because, most people who want an electric car are fine with a 150-200km range if it saves them €14k for batteries that, on a normal day, only weight down the car.

The Model X is that third generation, and the 25000€ number has been mentioned by Elon in one of the many instances he's been asked questions about it. There's lots of video of him answering questions on YouTube and sometimes also on the Tesla website (shareholder meetings, etc).

Completely different class when it comes to performance and safety. You can also buy a go-cart for less than that if you want.

&gt;Because, most people who want an electric car are fine with a 150-200km range

The point of Tesla is explicitly **not** to build another *electric car*, a car that people buy simply because it is electric. Tesla's goal is to build a generally top notch car that also happens to be fully electric. Tesla's aim is to push car manufacturing and ownership away from fossil fuels, and that doesn't work by simply appealing to a few city dwelling hippies or hipsters. It must be done on a mass scale. They're gradually moving closer to a completely mass market car with every generation, starting with a low volume, high speed, high range ""fun"" car (Roadster), moving on to a higher volume, cheaper and more family focused car (Model S/sedan), to the Model X and what ever may follow it.",0,1403326096,null,0,1403326665,0,cid3shh,t3_28myer,t1_cid3shh,t1_cid3d1v,null,1434334784,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

He doesn't really have an accent or dialect but uses a lot of slang. The episodes are between 5-15min each, so really good if you don't have time for a complete movie. There are about 200 by now, plus some specials where he shows the actual locations where things happened (Hannover). 2-4 new episodes each Wednesday.

AFAIK those two models are distinct, with the Model X supposedly coming next year, and followed by what they refer to as ""third generation"" in 2017, but we'll see.

&gt; Completely different class when it comes to performance and safety.

It drives, which is more than what can be said about the ""third generation"" Tesla so far.

&gt;  moving on to a higher volume, cheaper and more family focused car (Model S/sedan)

Well, at €65k and 30k sold, cheap and high volume is still some way to go. But don't get me wrong, I like that Tesla is using money from a few rich enthusiasts to help to create a market for electric vehicle batteries. That's what is needed to bring it to scale so prices can come down for actual high volume production.

I believe there's a difference between the third generation of car Tesla produces, and the third generation of the chassis. I do think that both the Model S and X are in fact sitting on the same (gen 2) chassis, yeah. And mass production of the Model X is coupled to Elon's Gigafactory, to enable cheaper and better batteries by economies of scale.  
I'm not sure what the €65k number is you're mentioning here. I think Elon frequently brings up much lower numbers for the Model S, if you don't buy the most high end model and include savings from taxes/possible government benefits as well as savings on fuel (which is why I called it gasoline car equivalent earlier).

&gt;It drives, which is more than what can be said about the ""third generation"" Tesla so far.

I'm with Elon on this. Hybrids, fuel cells, short-ranged cars which appeal because they are *electric* are non-existent with regards to his goal. It's his car, not theirs, that's got the highest safety rating ever while maintaining impressive performance, super fast charging, and it's his company that is moving battery production forward in cooperation with Panasonic. The other auto makers only make electric cars to be able to say that they have some of them, but don't take their proliferation seriously. I believe he even stated once that there are some financial benefits to having some electric vehicles in the fleet (alleging that that is part of the reason why they have them at all), though it wasn't something that concerned me a great deal and I haven't dug deeper into it at the time.",0,1403334494,null,0,1403334957,0,cid616p,t3_28myer,t1_cid616p,t1_cid5su0,null,1434335914,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Oh ja, schauen wir es uns an, ja? Gauck wurde ja schon genannt. Seine Verdienste gegen die DDR stammen allesamt aus der Zeit NACH der Wende. Das ist kein Mut, keine aufrechte Gesinnung, das ist einfach nur gute Arbeit, die sicher auch honoriert wurde. Neben den drei genannten Namen stehen auf der Liste der Ehrendoktoren der Uni Rostock aber ja auch noch nen Haufen anderer Namen.. insgesamt 107 findet Wikipedia. Wahllos mal einen rausgegriffen.. Maximilian von Liebeherr. ""Während der Deutschen Revolution wurde von Liebeherr, ein Vertreter der äußersten Rechten.... er wurde Ehrendoktor aller vier Fakultäten (Theologie, Rechtswissenschaft, Philosophie und Medizin)"". Keine weiteren Fragen.

&gt;Was hat Snowden denn für unser Land getan? [...] Diejenigen Bürger, die sich intensiver mit IT und Datenschutz beschäftigen, wissen das, was wir angeblich von Snowden erfahren haben, doch schon lange. 

Falsch. Wir haben es geahnt. Jetzt wissen wir es. Vor allem wissen es jetzt nicht nur die paar Hanseln die sich für sowas interessieren, sondern eigentlich alle Deutschen. Und jetzt wo wir es wissen, könnten wir ja was dagegen tun, oder? Wäre das nicht auch ihre Aufgabe als Innenminister? Kümmern Sie sich doch mal ums Innere, schützen Sie unsere Daten! Aber ich vergaß, ihresgleichen arbeitet ja schon solange ich politisch bewusst bin am Gegenteil. Da versteht man, warum sie von Snowden nicht viel halten.

&gt;Ich bin seit 2006 Innenminister von Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Seit meinem Amtsantritt predige ich, vorsichtig im Umgang mit der Technik zu sein. Wer seinen Rechner einschaltet, muss sich bewusst sein, dass er von dem Moment an nicht mehr allein ist. 

Genau. Ist doch alles kein Problem, lasst eure Rechner aus und niemand hört euch mehr ab. Wäre doch auch ne wunderbare Lösung für ihr Amt, oder? Lösen wir die BRD auf, dann fallen all die schwierigen Probleme eines Innenministers weg und sind quasi gelöst! ..oder falls ihnen das doch zu weit geht: Fangen Sie gefälligst an, ihren Job zu machen! PCs inklusive Internetzugang sind heutzutage schlichtweg notwendig für jedermann, auslassen ist keine Option. Fangen Sie gefälligst an, da für Sicherheit zu sorgen! Übrigens, nachdem Sie das nicht begriffen zu haben scheinen: Das tolle an der aktuellen NSA-Sache ist, dass man sich eben gar nicht vollständig bei Facebook entblößen muss, die NSA kriegt die Daten schon trotzdem.

&gt;Unsere Unis würden ihre Doktortitel allzu häufig verschenken. Ich kann nur davor warnen, den Dr. h. c als Massengut zu betrachten!

Beim Ehrendoktor muss das h.c. soweit ich weiß immer dazugesetzt werden. Es ist also jedem klar, dass dieser Titel keine besonderen akademischen Leistungen anzeigt, sondern aus anderen Gründen verliehen wurde. Wenn Ihnen 107 Verleihungen mittlerweile zu viele sind, dann lassen Sie uns doch einfach mal die Liste durchgehen, ich bin mir einigermaßen sicher wir finden einen (oder auch zehn) denen wir seinen Titel wieder aberkennen können, weil er weniger für uns getan hat als Snowden.

&gt;Die USA, wie auch immer es letztlich um deren Geheimdienstkontrolle bestellt ist, sind die größte freiheitliche Demokratie.

Kam erst vor kurzem eine Studie raus, wonach die USA eine Oligarchie sein müssten, weil wundersamer Weise sich irgendwie die Interessen des Großkapitals nahezu immer durchsetzen.

&gt;Wir brauchen Geheimdienste, um innere und äußere Sicherheit zu gewährleisten. Es kann nicht unser Ziel sein, Hackern die Kontrolle über rechtsstaatliche Verfahren zu überlassen.

Und wozu brauchen wir die Geheimdienste jetzt so genau? Immerhin sind sie offenbar nicht da, um mich vor den Geheimdiensten anderer Länder zu schützen. Im Gegenteil, ich muss mir noch Sorgen machen, dass sie denen dabei helfen, meine Daten zu kriegen. Die ungezählten Geheimdienste der USA haben 9/11, das Marathon-Bombing usw auch nie verhindert. Wann immer die einen Anschlag tatsächlich verhindern konnten, kam hinterher raus, dass der Geheimdienst dem Möchtegern-Bomber erstmal eingeredet hat, dass er das tun könnte und ihm dann auch noch die Sprengsätze besorgt hat. Kurz: Ich sehe absolut keinen ernsten Grund, warum wir einen Geheimdienst brauchen.

&gt;Ich sage es ganz ehrlich – ich bin skeptisch, was den grenzenlosen Jubel für Snowden angeht.

Und im letzten Satz sind wir uns dann wenigstens mal ganz unironisch einig. Snowden hat versucht, seinen Land zu helfen. Dabei hat er ganz nebenbei auch uns geholfen. Dabei hat er einiges geopfert und er wusste auch von Anfang an, dass er diese Opfer bringen muss. Das bringt ihm von mir Respekt ein, die Heldenverehrung überlasse ich anderen. Dennoch, wenn die Uni Rostock ihn so auszeichnen will dann sollte man mal anschauen, wofür in der Vergangenheit so Leute ausgezeichnet wurden.

Piú precisamente, la regola è che un attaccante che non abbia almeno due avversari tra sé e la porta non può prendere parte al gioco.

La differenza è sottile, ma importante: in sostanza, se sei “oltre” il penultimo difensore, “non sei in gioco”, e quindi non puoi prendere parte ad una azione offensiva: se te ne stai buono e tranquillo (non intercetti la palla, non ostacoli difensori etc) che tu sia fuori gioco non ha importanza. La punizione viene fischiata nel caso in cui, ad esempio, ti venga passata la palla, o dalla tua posizione di fuori gioco tu ostacoli un difensore o altro.

Peraltro, la _vera_ rogna del fuorigioco è che la posizione va valutata _nel momento in cui comincia l'azione_. In altre parole, tu _puoi_ fare gol “a porta vuota”, a patto che _quando la palla viene calciata per passartela_ tu abbia almeno due difensori tra te e la porta. (Ovviamente, perché una cosa del genere funzioni devi essere molto piú veloce dei difensori, ed il passaggio deve essere “lungo”).

&gt; Ma quindi se il portiere si trova fuori dai pali e il passaggio avviene con un solo difensore oltre l'ultimo attaccante è comunque fuorigioco?

Un premier problème est que pour contrôler il faut être légitime, et si le gouvernement a plus de légitimité que le contrôleur, cela ne fait pas avancer beaucoup le Shmilblick.


Il y a déjà des regroupement de personnes tirées au sort dans l'indifférence générale pour les questions de Bioethique qui en plus prennent le temps de se pencher sur ces sujets et débattent de manière non partisane. Leur débat sur l'euthanasie était très intéressant, cependant quand ils remettent une recommandation qui n'est pas celle souhaitée par le politique, comme quand ils ont rendu un avis favorable aux OGM, cela passe directement à la trappe. 


Après, si on confie par contre un vrai pouvoir décisionnaire sans possibilité pour l’intéressé d’inférer de la décision, ils ont par définition un pouvoir.


&gt; Tel qu'il en parle je voie le role des assemblé aléatoire comme celui qu'est censé tenir la presse : Un contre pouvoir non corruptible, assurant que les élus font leurs travail, et ont peur des conséquences si il le font mal.

Déjà cela m'étonnerais largement qu'ils soient incorruptibles. Regarde le niveau de confiance qu'on peut avoir dans les gens que l'on croise tous les jours. 


Ensuite, pour la presse, c'est bien ce qu'ils disent ... sauf quand cela tombe sur eux. Quand Caroline Fourest fait un reportage sur l'extrême droite ou que le Petit Journal révèle les manipulations de Mélanchon, voilà ceux qui dénoncent avec le plus de véhémence le manque de niac de la presse se muer en vierges effarouchées par ce journalisme scandale et user de menaces et intimidation.


Bref, oui il faut un plus grand partage de la vie politique, mais je pense qu'il faut d'autres choses pour cela, comme par exemple voir les politiques tous les jours et pas seulement sur les marchés en période d’élection. Si ils avaient un seul mandat ils auraient surement le temps d'être plus au contact des gens non ? Ya d'autres choses, mais il me semble que déjà si ya fin du cumul des mandats (ce qui est pas gagné) ca sera un bon point. Après on peut vouloir des gens ordinaires à la place des communicants ... mais qui a honnêtement envie d'avoir un gros con acerbe et reboutant comme représentant. Non, on veut quand même une personne avec un minimum de charisme et de relationnel. Donc il faut effectivement plus d'ouverture, mais pas forcement du tirage au sort. 


Enfin, il est nécessaire de rester vigilant, quand on propose d’instaurer un nouveau pouvoir sur lequel le suffrage n'aurait pas de prise, car qui contrôle le tirage ? ya t'il des présélection avant ?

Pour le reste :

Le groupe fait de confortables bénéfices. Et un CA de plusieurs dizaines de milliards d'euros. Etant donné que la dette liée aux infrastructures a été externalisée à RFF, ils avaient une bonne marge. Et cela fait des années que les prix sont devenus complètement flous aux yeux de tout le monde.

En fait, pour quelques libéraux (je ne dirai pas ""tous"" ou ""une majorité"", j'en ai aucune idée), il y a pire qu'un monopole public : un monopole privé ou monopole parapublic se comportement comme un monopole privé. 

Avec la SNCF, on se retrouve avec une situation comparable qu'avec Orange/France Telecom : 

* ""Notre service est différent ! Ce n'est pas la même chose !"" =&gt; défense de privilèges qui passent par un anoblissement de l'activité (*pourquoi ces avantages ? Parce que ! C'est très très très important, c'est pas n'importe quoi les enfants.*)

* Terreur face à l'arrivée de concurrents potentiels. Impossibilité d'imaginer que le consommateur veuille éventuellement moins cher. A l'heure actuelle, prendre le train est un truc de classe moyenne, classe moyenne supérieur *a minima*. J'étais surpris de découvrir que l'aviation low-cost m'offrait un niveau de service comparable aux TGV, pour un prix inférieur au kilomètre. Il est plus facile de rejoindre l'Italie ou la Pologne en avion que de se balader en France en train. 

* Lobbying continu pour transformer un monopole public en monopole privé voire oligopole privé avec entente, dans le meilleur des cas. Mise en avant des pertes pour les salariés ayant profité d'un statut particulier pour cela.

* Mépris de la concurrence et mépris d'une idée que le privé puisse faire mieux. Selon Eurostat, le réseau ferré britannique transporte plus de monde, avec moins de collisions et d'accidents désormais. Cocorico ! Et ? C'est juste un contre-argument en avance puisqu'on me balance toujours le rail britannique comme un ""mauvais exemple"" de libéralisation. Alors que c'est l'inverse. 

* Arguments fondés sur le ""service public"". Oui mais non. Une ligne non-rentable ça signifie quoi ? Ça signifie que le voyageur de Paris-Marseille doit payer pour cette ligne, juste parce que... heu, parce que quoi ? Ben, juste pour couvrir des zones non-rentables. Je te propose de construire une ligne directe Vesoul-Moscou. Pas rentable, mais quel service ! :) On va pas s'arrêter à l'utilité d'un service pour les consommateurs : la beauté du geste suffit.

A côté de ça, ce n'est pas parce que c'est *plus cher* que c'est *mieux*. Aux gens de décider s'ils veulent plus ou moins cher, et leur niveau de service. Si je te propose une bagnole à 500 000€ pour laquelle tu devras t'endetter, mais en t'expliquer qu'aucune autre voiture ne l'atteint en qualité de conduite, sécurité, etc. et une bagnole à 5000€ qui te permettra de rouler, même si elle ne paie pas de mine, je devrais t'expliquer en quoi tu es bête de choisir la moins chère ? Attends, là : ""c'est ta voiture, pourquoi ne pas prendre la plus chère ? Tu te rends compte que c'est ce qui va te permettre de sauver ta vie, peut-être ?""

Les gens devraient avoir le choix. Jusqu'à présent, ils ne l'ont pas. Et la qualité de service n'est pas seulement amputée par les retards, mais aussi par les grèves et la défense de corporations.

&gt; Ah oui et puis free et la libéralisation du marché, ça n'a eu que des effets positifs pas vrai ? Il n'y a pas eu de licenciements chez les autres opérateurs et le réseau de free est le meilleur, n'est-ce pas ?

On peut dire que la libéralisation de Free a été une sacrée réussite et un cas d'école en fait. :D

Non seulement la concurrence a permis de faire émerger plus d'emplois (directs et indirects, puisque chacun veut bien plus d'indépendances), il y a eu des gains pour les consommateurs mais aussi l'émergence de nouveaux emplois. Les seuls à avoir ""perdu"" sont ceux qui profitaient de l'ancienne oligopole... qui avait été condamnée, hein. Et qui résultait partiellement de l'ancienne position monopolistique de France Telecom, qui n'avait pas attendu la libéralisation totale pour commencer son dégraissage (à coup de suicides, en partie).

Et ceux qui profitaient de cette oligopole, oui, ce fut horrible, mais il s'agissait d'une partie des salariés des anciennes boîtes, des actionnaires et dirigeants de ces entreprises.

C'est le souci en cas de libéralisation : des corporations ou des forteresses s'effritent et saignent. On peut dire que c'est dommage pour tous ceux qui étaient jusqu'à présent protégés par des oligopoles aux dépends des consommateurs et de l'ensemble de la société. 

Mais personne n'a dit qu'il n'y aurait pas de bouleversement. C'était justement ce qui était recherché, et c'est ce qui a fonctionné. 

&gt; je sais que ça va te paraître incroyable mais ce n'est pas parcequ'un mec s'est mal conduit que ton expérience est représentative : tous les agents de la sncf que j'ai rencontré ont été courtois avec mois.

Héhé. En fait, c'est très simple. Si un mec, dans une boîte réellement privée, se fout de ma gueule parce qu'il constate que j'ai perdu XXX€, loupé un événement familial, etc. je fais remonter l'info. 

Le mec sait qu'il peut se faire virer, et qu'il se fera d'ailleurs sûrement virer s'il abuse trop souvent. Pas à la SNCF. Et pour le coup, c'est peut-être mon environnement social abusé (ah oui, des chômeurs, des cadres, des RSAistes, etc) qui est particulièrement chelou, mais beaucoup de gens se sont déjà retrouvés face à un mur bureaucratique ou de mauvais service à la SNCF. 

Pour info, ce n'est pas ""un mec"". Traîner à la gare Montparnasse est très instructif de voir à quel point *beaucoup* de gens pètent un câble dans cette gare face au service SNCF.

A situation égale, tu te feras généralement mieux servir dans un système privé *et* concurrentiel que monopolistique. Ne serait-ce que par l'effet de la concurrence sur le service : la volonté de se différencier, d'offrir une autre expérience, etc. 

Je ne parle même pas des coûts du transport. Apparemment on ne prend pas les mêmes trains. Personnellement, je constate surtout un service pauvre, complètement délirant en cas de retard (pour le coup, c'est suffisamment fréquent ; voir le site de l'AQST mis en lien plus haut), pour un prix qui permet quasiment de prendre l'avion aujourd'hui.

La SNCF hérite juste de décennies d'une absence totale de logique commerciale. Ils avaient un service public à rendre, et des usagers en face. La noblesse de leur tâche suffisait à se maintenir. Désormais, ni l'entreprise, ni sa direction, ni le gros de ses salariés ne se rend compte du chemin à faire pour offrir de véritables services attendus par les voyageurs.

&gt;Alors, on va privatiser le rail. Et après vous gueulerez sur les entreprises privées du secteur quand même comme vous gueulez sur Ryan air et Air France, comme vous gueulez pour les péages des autoroutes (qu'on a revendu à prix cassées alors qu'elles venaient à peine de devenir rentables !). Comme vous gueulez sur edf et gdf privatisés.

On gueule sur EDF parce qu'ils ont caché des coûts monstrueux (nucléaires &amp; cie) pendant toute la période publique, sous le coup de lobby de pro-nucléaires. On gueule aussi dessus parce qu'il s'agit encore d'un monopole privé *de facto*.

On gueule sur les concessions actuellement parce qu'elles ont été des cadeaux de l'Etat à quelques grandes boîtes, tout simplement. Des monopoles privés, garantis par des ""loyers"" en cas de non-rentabilité.

J'entends pas gueuler contre Ryan Air ou Easy Jet personnellement. Plutôt l'impression que les gens apprécient d'avoir le choix, et prennent massivement l'avion depuis : la fréquentation des aéroports a explosé depuis.

Idem pour les télécom' : tout le monde a l'air plutôt content d'avoir divisé sa facture. Personne ne pleure sur les anciennes boîtes.

La différence, donc ? D'un côté on a accordé des monopoles privés qui donc peuvent abuser tranquillement. De l'autre on a privatisé *et* libéralisé *et* ouvert à la concurrence.

&gt;Oui, les grèves de la sncf fait chier les gens : les grèves dans les transports, y a pas moyen de faire autrement. Mais y a une différence entre les taxis qui faisaient grève pour défendre leur corporatisme et la SNCF qui fait grève pour défendre un modèle du rail qui s'efforce de couvrir tout le territoire, pas juste les zones rentables à fort trafic.

Faut arrêter de prendre les gens pour des jambons. La grève SNCF est là pour défendre des privilèges. On dirait aux salariés SNCF qu'ils peuvent gagner 10% de plus en abandonnant la desserte de ces petites zones, tout en renforçant les syndicats, et ils n'en auraient rien à foutre du reste de la population. Les syndicats défendent leur intérêt (qui n'est d'ailleurs pas nécessairement le même que celui des salariés), c'est tout. Qu'ils aient de beaux arguments (parfois/souvent vrais) ne signifie pas qu'ils défendent autre chose.

J'ai rien contre la défense des intérêts de chacun. Je trouve ça sain. Mais que les cartes sur la table soient franches : à l'heure actuelle les salariés flippent juste de perdre des avantages. Leurs arguments ne portent pas ; ce n'est pas par désinformation, c'est juste parce que beaucoup trouvent ces avantages injustifiés en comparaison du service rendu. Ou parce qu'ils n'en ont rien à foutre, tout simplement.

Donc non, aucune différence entre les taxis (qui te trouveront aussi une centaine d'arguments larmoyants sur la qualité de service, leur rôle important dans la société, l'achat de leur licence, etc) et les salariés SNCF.

I've watched A TON of interviews with Elon Musk and content related to Tesla and SpaceX, so it's possible that I've been confusing something, although I'm not entirely sure that I did.  
Two things. First of all there's a submission there in which people talk about the X ""naturally"" being more expensive than the S, because it is a bigger car, and the link to which that discussion is tacked mentions a price tag of $50k for the X. People were calling the article shit, and I'm a) too tired to make sense of it and b) didn't read the article myself, so take it for what you will. Second, there was also mention of the Model E/Gen 3 (although Elon revealed that they abandoned the name Model E for it since someone else apparently already booked that name and they didn't feel like challenging it), which in turn was mentioned as falling into the $30k range. Now of course the € is somewhat stronger than the $ and I didn't convert the numbers (since I'm hella tired), but I thought it'd be the decent thing to do to raise the possibility of my potentially erroneous blabbering with the person it was discussed with. The price of the X might have changed, or Elon was quoting a *remarkably* low number for it in the instance I remember, or I'm remembering it wrong and he was talking about the next generation of car after the X. I do recall that he kept using the lowest number for which a car would be available, that he included government and tax benefits as well as fuel savings in it and that it was also converted to €, but it's possible that even with all of that it (the X) would still come out far more expensive than I thought I remembered. At this point, I'm not sure anymore (I'd have to watch all of the videos again to find out which number I was actually thinking of). &gt;_&lt;

If shit goes bad I think there's two interesting angles that Putin is worried about.
First, I do believe that Russias abilities would be revealed to the rest of the world and not in the good light. Right now Russia has upper hand from the ""unknown"" factor. Crimea went so well, it left an impression of well run army machine. But in real conflict I have a feeling they would reveal how majority of the troops functions. And that might not be in Putins interests. 
Secondly. If he goes for the east he will have to take it. That means very expensive war for who knows for how long. And even if he gets the east, its still going to be very expensive endeavor. 
I think Putin wanted East to separate from Ukraine but not part of Russia(as it would be very costly to bump up the living standards quickly).

Putin might not be the most humanitarian leader, but he is a strong leader. He can keep Russia in check or at least be able to control it's direction while being open to semi-negotiation. 

If Putin is assassinated, you don't know what the fuck you'll end up with. Russian Ultranationalsits who wish to purge all non-ethnic Russians? The Communist Party again? A military dictatorship perhaps? Maybe a Russian Civil War with nuclear weapons on the line and a border overspilling with violence from East Europe to the border of China? Maybe even somebody *more competent* than Putin and able to carry out something like we're seeing with Ukraine with much more skill?

Hell, it could be somebody with a pure ideological hatred of the West who's emotional enough to actually invade Eastern NATO member-states and bring about a nuclear holocaust.

It's of Jewish-Hungarian origin. Jewish foods are generally known as using every ingredient that is available and this cake is no different, it's very complex and you need lots of ingredients.

The recipe is roughly this: make a usual portion of cake dough and split it into 5 parts. Usually you would split cake dough into two parts (to go on the top and bottom of the cake), but here it's 5 parts so each layer will be very thin. There is no need to bake each layer separately.

So put the first layer of dough in a pan. Take 100g of dried apricots, 100g poppy seeds, some sugar and apricot jam and cook them in a separate dish, add some milk or water if needed. It will turn into a thick paste, spread that on the dough.

Put the second layer of dough on top. The second layer is made of apples, cinnamon and cloves. The third is chocolate and walnuts. The fourth is made of dried prunes cooked in sugary water. Put the final layer of dough on top and bake it in an oven, it will be awesome!

what i don't like about right-wing is their victim-like tone. ;)

&gt;But ruhrbarone is an acceptable and independent source? Every single article I've ever read on that site has that condescending tone I mentioned before. There was an article on there about how a newspaper in my region reported that after a group of asylum-seekers moved into a building in a small town the numbers of shop lifting incidents rose unproportionally. The ruhrbarone guy started his article with basically claiming that everybody here is a dumb and uneducated peasant, unlike the intelligent and sophisticated Ruhr people of course, and that said newspaper is almost a softcore nazi propaganda tool anyway (proofing this by quoting some guy from 20 years ago). Also that they had more shop lifts in the 3 months since the asylum-seekers arrived than normally in an entire year had (of course) absolutely nothing to do with the asylum-seekers.

yeah. ruhrbarone is an acceptable and independent source, in contrast to euractiv

&gt;His colleagues were attacked before, so he was probably scared and on the edge. Add the right-wingers tendency for violence to that and you get that reaction. Also, it says in the article that it was a gas pistol which are only deadly at close range and when aimed at the head. 

Nonetheless you don't pull a gun.

America attacked Iraq, America attacked Libya, destroying both nations, causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people and the displacement of millions and what for?! In both cases it was Putin who was on the right side of history, opposing both invasions. He backed the right side in Syria again, favoring the stability of the Assad regime over making Syria a global magnet for Sunni Jihadists.

And in the case of Ukraine? The aggression comes from the West! If you try to integrate a country bordering Russia into the EU/NATO, giving you the ability to e.g. station rockets right at Russia's front door,  that is a serious threat to Russia's national security. The Americans almost started World War 3 when the Soviets tried to station rockets in Cuba and tried to wipe out that regime throughout the Cold War. Really, that is just basic geopolitics and does not at all show that Putin is like Hitler or something stupid like that.

The West made a very aggressive move against Russia by trying to integrate Ukraine. We should all be thankful that Putin is not some crazy Hitler-like but a reasonable and careful strategist who has no interests in starting a world war. If he were like Hitler, Russian tanks would have rolled into Kiev a long time ago. Instead he is doing the best thing he can do as far as Russia's national interests are concerned, trying to weaken Ukraine before it falls under the NATO umbrella.

Putin is corrupt, linked to organized crime, the man of the oligarchs etc. like Bismarck he is pretty much a scumbag as far as domestic policy is concerned, I would support the opposition if I were Russian, but his foreign policy is exemplary realpolitik and not short-sighted jingoist aggression as displayed by guys like Bush or Hollande.

&gt; **America attacked Libya**

[France and Britain Lead Military Push on Libya](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/world/africa/19europe.html?_r=0)

&gt;PARIS — France and Britain continued to press their hawkish position on Libya on Friday, saying they intend to take the lead in enforcing a no-flight zone.

&gt;*Both countries, the most adamant backers of the United Nations Security Council resolution to authorize military action in Libya*, also pointed to the passage of the measure on Thursday as an important — if rare — example of European resolve.

[Libya, Europe and the future of NATO: Always waiting for the U.S. Cavalry](http://www.economist.com/blogs/charlemagne/2011/06/libya-europe-and-fuure-nato)

&gt;*America was visibly reluctant to get involved*, let alone lead the action. And, having helped to knock out Libya's air defences and conduct some of the initial air-to-ground strikes, it pulled back from the front-line operations. But America's role remains essential, not least in providing air-to-air refuelling, as well as intelligence and reconnaissance for the European allies. 

And you're kinda forgetting the fact that the intervention [was approved &amp; authorized by the United Nations Security Council](http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10200.doc.htm). Now, I don't know if you realize this, but Russia is on the Security Council and didn't veto this resolution. If Putin really &amp; truly opposed it, he would've used his country's veto to deny it. 

-----------------------------------------------------

&gt;**it was Putin who was on the right side of history**

[Second Chechan War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chechen_War)

&gt;Chechnya was devastated, including the almost complete destruction of Grozny, the Chechen capital. Russian artillery and air indiscriminately pounded populated areas. Human rights organizations also documented several massacres of civilians by Russian units. Russian President Vladimir Putin proclaimed Chechnya pacified by Spring 2000. But peace has been elusive for Chechen civilians, victims of a continuing war of attrition. They are plagued by abuses committed by Russian forces – arbitrary arrest, extortion, torture, murder. Chechen civilians also suffer because there have been no sustained efforts to rebuild basic social services, such as public utilities or education. Chechen fighters also commit abuses against civilians, but neither on the same scale nor with the same intensity as Russian forces.

&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------

&gt;The Chechens had become increasingly radicalized. Former Soviet Army officers Dzhokhar Dudayev and Aslan Maskhadov have been succeeded by people who rely more on religious ideology, rather than the nationalistic feelings of the population. While Dudayev and Maskhadov were seeking from Moscow recognition of the independence of the Chechen Republic Ichkeria, other leaders spoke out more about the need to expel Russia from the territory of the whole North Caucasus, an impoverished mountain region inhabited mostly by Muslim, non-Russian ethnic groups.

---------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;**The West made a very aggressive move against Russia by trying to integrate Ukraine.**

Well if you're talking about realpolitik you can't really blame the European Union, can you? Isn't it in their interests to offer Ukraine options? To deny Russia a state within their sphere-of-influence by giving that state a chance to chose it's own destiny? I mean, it's clear what lengths Russia is willing to go, why would it be in the European Union's interests to foster a stronger, more influential Russia? To not allow Ukraine to beef up it's relationship with the EU in comparison to the new Eurasian Union?

Clearly, we need to form a defensive block. Ideally with some of the larger, technologically advanced nations, who are capable of making a difference. Perhaps some sort of a treaty...If only there was such a thing!

&gt;The company’s Falcon 9 rocket lifted off into the cloudy skies over Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 3:25 p.m. ET, sending a robotic Dragon cargo capsule into orbit.

&gt;The Dragon held nearly 5,000 pounds (2,200 kilograms) of supplies and equipment for the station, ranging from the legs for a space robot to a lettuce-growing experiment. This is the third cargo delivery under the terms of SpaceX's 12-flight, $1.6 billion contract with NASA.

&gt;In addition to sending up the Dragon, SpaceX tested a landing system that could make it possible for future Falcons to return autonomously to a landing pad for reuse.

true,CountVonTroll,EURO,European Federation | Germany,"&gt; I've watched A TON of interviews with Elon Musk and content related to Tesla and SpaceX

Yeah... I got that impression... :)

Look, Musk did some great things. SpaceX in particular is a huge achievement. There's a lot of hype around him and Tesla, and that's by design -- he needs to convince people to invest (literally) into his vision. That's a *Good Thing™*. Personally, I'm quite excited about his plans for a battery factory, because bringing battery production to scale is exactly what is needed right now to bring prices for them, and therefore electric vehicles, down. But he's not the Messiah, and I'm getting the impression that too many give in to believing in something they want to believe in, instead of looking at it rationally.

Tesla is a small company, as far as car manufacturers go. This point is crucial, because it means that it operates under a very different prerogative than the established players. Tesla can delay a model by a year or not meet price points it had talked about before, and it's not a big deal. If that happened to Toyota, investors would get very nervous, and managers would lose their jobs. But if Tesla eventually comes through and goes on to sell 30k cars, it's a success. Any potential problems with the battery packs after a few years of real-world use seems like an acceptable risk for a newcomer with nothing to lose, but as a potential for some really bad press for the existing big players. Tesla can take risks that an established brand can't, and they have to, because they're entering an existing market.

What VW spends on R&amp;D each year alone is about two thirds of Tesla's entire market capitalization. For Tesla, a niche market of people who want a long range electric vehicle is a giant opportunity to enter the playing field, for an established brand selling a few thousand cars is something they can test their technology on. Take the BMW i3, for example. It's no coincidence that this is also BMW's first car where they're testing a passenger cell made of carbon fiber enforced polymer as the main structural component.

How big the market for electric vehicles is is directly related to the cost of batteries. Tesla can grow along this curve of battery prices and it'll be doing alright. That the ""third generation"" will be cheaper makes perfect sense when you look at it this way. They *had to* start out with a luxury car because the component with the highest cost was already very expensive and building an average car around it wouldn't have been competitive, even for a niche market of enthusiasts who can afford such a car at current prices. You can't sell cars with the comfort of one that costs only €25k if that's what you have to pay for the batteries (60MWh) alone. You have to aim for the luxury segment to ""dilute"" the cost of the batteries.  
As prices for this main component go down, they can enter progressively cheaper market segments. I have my doubts whether they'll meet this €25k target by 2017 if they put the same kind of battery capacity into it as into the Model S, but we'll see. They'll probably delay it by a year, reduce the range by a bit and then come close to this target after tax rebates and subsidies, and it would still be a success. But this doesn't mean the established players couldn't put more batteries into their electric models if they saw a market for such a car once batteries have gotten cheaper, not least because of Musk's factory and the help Tesla, the Nissan Leaf and all the others provide to get the market to scale.",0,1403356898,null,0,false,0,cid9vqk,t3_28myer,t1_cid9vqk,t1_cid7awp,null,1434337728,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

? I'm not new to the internet, but that's an acronym I don't know. Are you talking about the social justice warrior (according Urban Dictionary)? If so, chemtrails and other conspiracies are very harmful, because even if they are/were true (for eg. NSA), they sound to crazy to attract people. On the contrary, media uses those loons to get people disassociated with a movement that is actually theirs. OWS should have get rid of these people. Not by prohibition, but by explaining what I explained right now, because prohibition will also disassociate people, because *why change one authoritarian regime for another*.  

&gt; They were bound to end eventually

- Protests are never meant to change a government, at least not directly. It's about awareness, informing people, provoking thought. It's also to measure numbers, numbers that show change can be made. You have heard about the impossibility of changing bipartidism, because voting for them is a *lost vote*. When protests are big enough, and through discussion, people realize that's not true ""this time"". See Syriza in Greece, see Podemos in Spain: parties that come out of nothing, suddenly come in as a ""close third"", a possible contender. People realize that and start voting *en masse* for them. From there on, things move, both on the left and the right. This takes time (elections are every so many years), but it's the way to non-violently overthrow a regime, the other one is, you guessed it, violent overthrow. The problem with the last option is that it often leads to civil war, or at least a power-vacuum. It's those two that always lead to a restoration of old powers, but with a new face (French revolution, Napoleon).

&gt; They were bound to end eventually

- No, they're bound to change and go ""underground"". OWS is still alive, very alive, still spreading ideology. We've heard the same about 15M in Spain. Suddenly occupying squares was over. According the media, they disappeared, people got tired of them. But as we can see, there are sudden eruptions, and it's then that you can see that the movement actually grew. You just won't see it on tv. 

&gt; especially in the US and probably to a lesser extent the other Anglophone countries.

That's because in those countries, being poor is your own fault. If you're poor you're a loser. And, for some reason, people actually buy into it. Just look at the amount of people defending capitalism and corporatism, people with debts, people that need three jobs to have three meals. You don't have to head to the streets, just look on reddit, the ""elitist"" and ""smarter"" people of society. It's shocking.

First, in any Russian-American nuclear exchange both countries' first strikes are going to be against their nuclear assets.  The US and Russia both have these placed in the middle of no-where (the Dakotas and the Midwest and Siberia).   Next, there's military targets, and then finally the civilian centers.   Moreover, nukes aren't going to be evenly spread-out across the civilian land-scape.  In the 80's, it was believed it would take roughly 200 warheads to ensure Moscow's destruction based on missile failure rates, Russian interception capabilities, and the strength of Russian bunkers.

If you look at fallout maps, large pieces of the US would remain liveable.   Not to mention in any nuclear exchange shit isn't going to happen in Africa or South America.

Any ensuing nuclear winter would increase food prices dramatically and there would be famine, but hardly would it reduce the population to bare millions.

Yes, that is why I listed Hollande next to Bush. He was way more eager to attack than the Americans indeed but in the end it was America which did most of the work in Libya. I wrote ""America attacked Libya"", the fact that Hollande was pushing for it does not absolve the US of its responsibility. It is not like Hollande was capable of forcing the US to do anything.

&gt;If Putin really &amp; truly opposed it, he would've used his country's veto to deny it. 

A naive statement ignorant of international diplomacy. NATO has a track record of being perfectly willing to attack without UN Security Council legitimization. If Putin had veto'ed it the likely outcome would have been a NATO attack against Russia's explicit veto. Now Putin was not willing to go to war against NATO just to protect Gaddafi of course, so what would have been the practical effect of a Russian veto? Just Russia looking weak and angering other nations without gaining anything. Again his decision was foreign policy textbook material. 

&gt; Chechnya

Wow, that is a complex issue. You may want to read the complete history of conflict in the Caucasus for starters. It is not as simple as you may think but quite frankly this is a completely different topic and I am not even feeling remotely qualified to debate it. I will not claim that he made the right decision there, or that he made the wrong one. I only said that he was on the right side of history as far as Libya, Syria, and Iraq are concerned, whether he was right on Chechnya too or not that is a different question. The point is that his overall track record is pretty damn good.  

&gt;Well if you're talking about realpolitik you can't really blame the European Union, can you?

Yes, I can. There was a stable status quo. Then the West made an attempt to change that status quo in its favor with an aggressive move against Russia. The West is the aggressor and deserves blame for that. Realpolitik and warmongering are two separate issues. Realpolitik just means that you are not driven by ideology (like the American Neocons) but only care about power, resources, security etc. How aggressive you are about that, that is a different question.

&gt;giving that state a chance to chose it's own destiny?

The current Ukrainian state is an artificial construct of Soviet border drawing. The people living there have very different ideas about what ""destiny"" they want. E.g.

It was a conscious decision for me to take Catalan over Spanish to start with - especially given i had the choice of free Spanish lessons too. I struggle with catalan but it is worth it to be able to be part of my kids world for school and friends. 

my kids have been in catalan school for 18 months now. youngest Catalan is stronger than her english at times and has to be reminded that i dont understand everything... 

oldest only started spanish since october and is now sufficent for exams.. very thankful for friends who come and help her understand homework... scary when she is out marking some of the kids in her class who have been doing it since birth O.o Catalan is the same story but she gets extra help with that through the school. 

both chatter away in catalan to friends etc so secret codes are not needed. 

but yes, if we want to integrate and be part of the local community to us, it is better for us to have catalan first and spanish second. but they are forgiving of my butchering. 

Hubby doesnt need any languages as his team is from everywhere.. making for interesting swear word cross overs.

Technically we could have sent the kids to the British or Americana school but made a choice not to because we wanted the kids to have local friends and integrate as much as possible. 

I tell people to start with one for six months and then bring in the other. the catalan is free for basics with a nie so i often suggest it that way as free is always good. both are useful but if you are outside of the tourist areas, catalan will help you earn brownie points with the locals (well depending on your area) but honestly where i live, they are way more friendly to me when i attempt catalan but we are in a very residential and pretty independance-positive area

Unfortunately I'm not right-wing, but I guess that you're sitting so far on the left that everything right of Die Linke appears as the far-right to you. I'm in the middle, with socialist views on some things and conservative views on others. I hate the right-wing as much as every sane person does, however, I've recently started to extend that hate to the left-wing. Left-wing people are almost always incredibly obnoxious and condescending, like they're the only intelligent people on the planet who have it all figured out, no other opinions and viewpoints allowed, and everybody else is just dumb and backwards. [Like these dickheads](http://www.mimikama.at/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/image131.png) who apparently think that having a German flag on your car activates the war-mongering part of the German brain and sooner or later Germans will use these cars to invade Poland again, and only they have the enlightenment to stop it by destroying people's property. Break off the flags to stop WWIII!

&gt;yeah. ruhrbarone is an acceptable and independent source, in contrast to euractiv

I tried to search the web for anything that critizes or discredits euractiv, but I couldn't find it. If you have anything on that, I'll read it. From what I gathered, it's just a news website with a focus on EU politics. However, ruhrbarone is not a news website, it's a blog, and blogs are never a reliable source, because a) they don't have to answer to anyone, so they can write whatever they want, no matter if it's true or not (ruhrbarone is not part of the Presserat so they don't have to follow the Pressekodex), and b) blogs are always subjective, there's no necessity for objectivity like on other news sources, and that's what I expect from a news source: objectivity. 

Let's look at a few examples. [Here's a post](http://www.ruhrbarone.de/presserat-missbilligt-ruhrbarone-berichterstattung-ueber-selbstmord-von-esoterik-lobbyist/80196) regarding an attempt by the Presserat to delete the insulting comment section underneath a post about the suicide of a pro-homeopathy journalist. What does Stefan Laurin, the founder of ruhrbarone, do? He calls the people who complained about it a ""club of flying elephants"". Now, I think homeopathy is a load of humbug, but you wouldn't find something like this on a news website. Then there's [this story](http://www.ruhrbarone.de/tauss-der-kinderschandergucker-der-piraten-ist-verurteilt-zu-recht/11970/comment-page-1#comments) where the author accused Tauss of being a disgusting pervert who masturbates to child pornography (you can read that in the comments since the author had to edit the post afterwards). Did he have any proof for that? Of course he didn't, even the court said that Tauss didn't have child pornography for his own pleasure, but that didn't stop the author from writing it. [This post](http://tantejay.wordpress.com/2010/05/29/schlechter-journalismus-am-beispiel-ruhrbarone/) (by a blogger, so it's an opinion, not a fact) highlights the problems with that story. Or let's look at [this post](http://www.ruhrbarone.de/syrien-ein-kleiner-blick-auf-die-kommenden-tage) where Laurin calls for military action in Syria and essentially calls all peace activists spoiled douchebags.

&gt;Nonetheless you don't pull a gun

It depends on which story you choose to believe. We have two stories from the two sides, one from a random Antifa guy (Antifa guy spits and insults, then leaves the place, the two guys chase him down and suddenly pull a gun for no reason) and one from a right-wing populist (Antifa guy spits and insults, the two guys try to catch him to bring him to justice (that would've been legal btw, §229 BGB states that anybody has the right to arrest a fleeing criminal), Antifa guy tries to resist and attack them, they pull a gun to defend themselves). From where I'm standing both sources seem equally untrustworthy. In story 1 pulling a gun would be illegal, in story 2 it would be legal.

a) multiple invasions against every country bordering them to the west and south (Sweden, Poland, Turkey)

b) the fact that Siberia was almost uninhabited so there was little to no resistance in colonizing it. Siberia was a Russian colony in the same way French or British territories in Africa were ones. The only difference was that it was connected to Russia by land.

&gt;This however does not mean that they should own the territory, allies or puppet states would be enough (like the Warsaw Pact).

How about you fuck yourself? Defending ourselves against Russian imperialism is our foremost national principle since the 17th century. Are you asking us to become their puppet states again?",0,1403360926,null,0,false,0,cidayaq,t3_28pkw7,t1_cidayaq,t1_cid9un8,null,1434338232,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Yes, that is why I listed Hollande next to Bush. He was way more eager to attack than the Americans indeed but in the end it was America which did most of the work in Libya. I wrote ""America attacked Libya"", the fact that Hollande was pushing for it does not absolve the US of its responsibility. It is not like Hollande was capable of forcing the US to do anything.

We were reluctant to get involved, but we did because it was our allies. That goes to say something. And we didn't do most the work because we wanted to, we did most the work because the countries that called for it, initiated it &amp; tried to lead it couldn't do their share of the work. 

We could've let them fall on their face, but we didn't. 

&gt; A naive statement ignorant of international diplomacy. NATO has a track record of being perfectly willing to attack without UN Security Council legitimization. If Putin had veto'ed it the likely outcome would have been a NATO attack against Russia's explicit veto. Now Putin was not willing to go to war against NATO just to protect Gaddafi of course, so what would have been the practical effect of a Russian veto? Just Russia looking weak and angering other nations without gaining anything. Again his decision was foreign policy textbook material.

It's not naive at all.

A veto would have put NATO *(and not really just NATO, Sweden participated as well)* in a awkward position if they did chose to carry out their intervention because than it would'nt have been authorized by the UNSC.

That would've been a easy propaganda win for Putin. Honesly, the reason he didn't, in my opinion, was to leverage a angle against a Western attack on Syria; so he would have something to tell Obama *""I worked with you here, now you work with me here.""* Realpolitik down to the bone. Don't transform this shit about Russia giving two fucks about history or how shit in the Middle East is going to turn out, Russia just gave a fuck about their naval base at Tartus &amp; the continued existance of one of their few remaining ME allies.

I actually opposed it myself, but that's not the point and the my reasons were not Putin's reasons. I think we should've intervened, but when it started and the opposition still had a liberal &amp; secular base. By the time the wheels did get turning, it was too late and there was no point. 

But I do admire how Obama played it. He not only managed to not intervene, but begin the process of getting chemical weapons out of Assad's hands. And I believe that's commendable. 

&gt;Wow, that is a complex issue. You may want to read the complete history of conflict in the Caucasus for starters. It is not as simple as you may think but quite frankly this is a completely different topic and I am not even feeling remotely qualified to debate it. I will not claim that he made the right decision there, or that he made the wrong one. I only said that he was on the right side of history as far as Libya, Syria, and Iraq are concerned, whether he was right on Chechnya too or not that is a different question. The point is that his overall track record is pretty damn good.

You're damn right it's a complicated issue, damn near every war &amp; occupation is. But that doesn't take away from the civilian casualties. Doesn't take away from the fact that Chechnya's infrastructure is in the fucking shitter thanks to years of warfare &amp; occupation. Doesn't change the fact that Russia's actions have radicalized the opposition and resulted in a more unstable situation and continued terrorist attacks against them. All criticisms you leveled against the United States and exonerated Russia of doing, when the exact same god-damn situation is sitting right there for all too see. 

And if Bush was on the wrong-side of history for trying to institute a new regime in authoritarian Iraq....what side of history is Putin on for trying to suppress, control &amp; annex independent Chechnya? And...funny enough...with oil being one of his primary motivations?
 
&gt;Yes, I can. There was a stable status quo. Then the West made an attempt to change that status quo in its favor with an aggressive move against Russia. The West is the aggressor and deserves blame for that. Realpolitik and warmongering are two separate issues. Realpolitik just means that you are not driven by ideology (like the American Neocons) but only care about power, resources, security etc. How aggressive you are about that, that is a different question.

You're right.

The EU exercised soft power &amp; realpolitik, and Russia exercised hard power &amp; realpolitik.

One's a warmongerer, one's not. 

Although honestly, if you really want to get all Bismark and shit, let me ask you this: Everybody knows Russia can't attack NATO &amp; NATO can't attack Russia. It's become clear on a number of issues that Russian &amp; European Union interests are incompatible in many areas, resulting in both nations/supranational unions challenging each other on a number of issues. So, at the end of the day, from a realpolitik perspective like you want to put forth, what is better? A Eurasian Union with Ukraine? Or a  Eurasian Union without Ukraine? A Russia with Ukraine? Or a Russia with only Crimea *(and possibly half-of-Ukraine, but that's yet to be seen)*? Russia being able to exercise free reign over Ukraine? Or Russia embroiled in and distracted by a costly foreign conflict/crisis? Not to mention this is a pretty heavy propaganda loss for Russia, another realpolitik advantage.

&gt;The current Ukrainian state is an artificial construct of Soviet border drawing. The people living there have very different ideas about what ""destiny"" they want. E.g. Crimea has been Russian for a long time, the people there do not want to be ruled by the guys in Kiev.

Crimea has been *""Russian""* for only a little longer than many parts of Ukraine have been *""Russian""* if we want to get technical. And you're ignoring the fact that while the Soviets drew the map, Russia accepted their legacy as the successor state to the Soviet Union.

Russia agreed to and acknowledged that map when they signed the Budapest Memorandum in 1994. Russia recognized and upheld that map when they confirmed the Budapest Memorandum in 2009.

If Russia wasn't so hostile and expansionist that seemingly all their neighbours hate them enough to invade them, would they still need a buffer zone?

&gt; So they could get their buffer zone

But why is Russia somehow so fucking special? Why are they the only nation in the world for which it's somehow *a right and understandable* thing to do to have a buffer zone? If I understood you correctly you mean something like ""Oh yes, yes, maybe they conquered half of the continent enslaving dozens of nations, whatever. But they *needed* that buffer zone because that's just a Russian thing. That's just how they are, and believe me, being the one *special* nation that cannot exist without buffer zone ain't easy.""

Poland was never expansionist in the same way Russia was. Our vast areas in Eastern Europe far from core regions of Poland in Central Europe were inherited from Lithuania. Yes, we invaded Russia once, even took Moscow and enthroned our own puppet Tsar for a short time. And I think it was the only instance in which we actually conquered some territory.

^(And, if you asked me, it was the biggest mistake of our history that we haven't teamed up with Sweden to ultimately destroy Russia then when it still was weak, and instead engaged in pointless and devastating wars with Sweden.

**Chinatown** (1974) Polanski: un capolavoro assoluto. Il neo-noire per eccellenza. Non vederlo è farsi un torto.
Idem per **L'inquilino del terzo piano**, sempre di Polanski, che mea culpa vedo con enorme ritardo pur essendo sempre stato un grande fan di Polanski, e questo è probabilmente il suo picco assoluto. Poi ho visto anche i suoi due ultimi lavori, **Carnage** e **Venus in furs**, entrambi ben fatti, interessanti, ma per me troppo teatrali per non deludermi un po'. 

Qualche cazzatona più leggera: **In Time** e **The Host** di Niccol son flicks decenti per pubblico adolescente. Un po' migliori i due **Hunger Games** e soprattutto **Beatiful Creatures** di LaGravenese che è il più ironico e meno infantile fra tutti, e con gli attori migliori.


Sulla fantascienza consiglio **Pandorum**, **Sunshine** e se vi siete persi **Snowpiercer** recentemente al cinema pentitevene e cercatelo, divertimento di alta qualità.

1. Only the top computer lines from US manufacturers where embargoed

2. West Europe was under a similar embargo

3. The embargo applied only to US products such as Apple and IBM

4. Similar top PC lines where available for Taiwan and other countries

&gt;Commerce [dept.] said its action [of partially lifting the embargo] was justified because models similar to those banned by the United States have been freely sold to the Eastern bloc from other countries, including Taiwan, Singapore, India and Brazil.

Silvione nostro è ai servizi sociali perché segua un procedimento di recupero sociale attraverso questa ""pena alternativa"" alla detenzione. Non si può ignorare che sia stato condannato per questioni di evasione fiscale, non certo per le sue sparate contro la magistratura.

Il passaggio per cui il suo ravvedimento quindi dovrebbe passare anche per un più generico rispetto per le istituzioni dello stato, e la loro autonomia, è un po' un tirare l'elastico, per ragioni più dialettiche che di sostanza (ma è la stessa cosa che hanno fatto i magistrati).

Perché, allargando per allargando, allora anche i magistrati non hanno rispetto per un uomo che, girandoci attorno, rappresenta una istituzione dello stato (una forza politica sopra al 15%) e per la sua autonomia di pensiero e di espressione (che dovrebbe essere tutelata a prescindere).

Poi in queste questioni la magistratura deve avere, e ha, l'ultima parola, ovviamente. Però non ci si può stupire se si considera l'applicazione effettiva di quello che si sperava rimanesse come una minaccia su carta (peraltro ricamata ad hoc per le imminenti elezioni europee, non ci prendiamo in giro) un travalicamento della magistratura. Che secondo me scende su un terreno scivoloso che spalanca, di nuovo, le porte al vittimismo berlusconiano, di nuovo solo e accerchiato contro chi vuole zittirlo.

Quindi, vorrei chiarirlo, non sto dicendo che sia illeggittimo o che non sia scritto nelle carte (c'è, credo proprio nell'ordinanza che hai linkato), sto dicendo che lo ritengo un errore politico dei magistrati che si stanno occupando della vicenda, un accanimento peraltro inutile su un uomo politico finito.",1,1403371294,null,0,false,0,cidel92,t3_28pxsa,t1_cidel92,t1_ciddy9v,null,1434340011,-1,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,-1

Beat the eggs and in the same bowl you beat the eggs you toss the sliced poached potatos and use the whisk you used to beat the eggs to mix the potatos in and also use it to break apart the potatos a bit so they release some of the starch giving the egg more structure, 

That mixture is put in to a deepish frying pan at medium low heat and you let it cook until one side is solid bringing in the edges a bit , you put a plate slightly larger then the frying pan on the frying pan and flip the omelette on to the plate and then slide it back in to the frying pan to turn it around (takes some practice), 

cook at low to medium heat until firm in the center, some people like a gooey center so experiment with cooking times.

You might want to look into *[The Hasting Center](http://www.thehastingscenter.org/Default.aspx)*, before you waste to much time on that report. Big on *ethics*, aren't they.  
   
It's hard to find info on the center that doesn't cite the center as the original source. I did find this on US National Library of [Medicine National Institutes of Health](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11657314):   

""The Hastings Center was founded in 1969 to study ethical problems in medicine and biology... [it] arose from a confluence of three social currents: the increased public scrutiny of medicine and its practices, the concern about the moral problems being generated by technological developments, and the desire of one its founders (Callahan) to make use of his philosophical training in a more applied way""    

Yeah.   

On the board of The Hasting Center is also Richard Payne, Professor of Medicine and Divinity at Duke Divinity School. 
   
Also Blair L Sadler, ""a passionate advocate of the need to build hospitals that encourage healing"". Hospitals that *encourage* healing. That must be a good thing, right?    
 
What a about Frank Trainer, then, a member of the Board of Directors of Cranaleith Spiritual Center.    

and that wiki page. Dude, seriously.   
     
""The popular perception of female genital surgeries is distorted"" - are they, now.   

""While there are many parallels between the practices of female and male circumcision ...

For example in France, the Mont Saint Michel is now a massive tourist attraction. It's still nice but there are only cheap tourist shops there now. In the historic city of Venice, from the 90s to now, the population declined from 120,000 to 60,000, because it's now just a tourist attraction with no life beyond that.

There are NO NATO troops in Russia. I would love to know how do you define ""aggressor""? Because right now all Western-Europe does is ""sanctions"". Exactly not sanctions, but ""sanctions"". Just like they did with Hitler before he shared Poland with his big buddy uncle Stalin.

Invading? Could you list countries that NATO annexed during the last decades? Simlar to what Russia did with Georgia and Ukraine. Name ONE country where something similar was done.

Russia has no buffer nations. Buffer nation label is extremely ignorant and offensive. Do not EVER use it again. We refuse to be buffer nation. We suffered enough.

I was actually there and my job was connected with improving the financial market infrastructure (i.e., preventing some of the capital markets failures that had been happening). My work was in St. Petersburg and Moscow. This brought me into contact with a number of smaller, high-growth companies who had an interest in raising money via the capital markets as well as existing enterprises.

After the devaluation of 1998, it suddenly meant that key western products were suddenly too expensive for many Russians. This was a good thing as it allowed the better placed local companies to come to market with what they had learned about marketing, packaging and quality control to step into that space.

These people wanted to operate legally. Organised crime tended to stay clear of more complex businesses and were becoming less of an issue and the authorities were taking a pragmatic approach to licensing and regulation. Slowly businesses could grow.

Along came Putin. His first mistake was the way of taking Yukos. There are many ways that he could have gone after Khodorkvsky (who had annoyed Puting by broaching the problem of official corruption in public) but by invalidating the sale, he sent the message that shares mean nothing. The backers of Putin started attaching themselves to businesses, appointing themselves as directors and elbowing out the real owners. Licensing became a nightmare. Each official would demand higher and higher bribes and businesses could no longer comply by being ""honest"".

It was all okay for Putin as he gave oil export privileges to his old friend who ran Gunvor. A large part of the company seems to be held very non-transparently and seemingly by the Oligarch in chief, Putin. If you want me to go through the list of Putin's dodgy deals, we can go back to his time serving as head of the Committee for Foreign Economic Relations in St Petersburg where a large sum of money went missing.

There's also the energy costs involved in, as I say, manufacturing and transporting the things. Especially since they are designed to be out of date within five years or less.

And yes, we desparately need fewer cars on the streets. We can talk about how nice it is that we have increased mobility these days, but it comes at a cost, and the cost is the environment. This is what I mean about how we are unwilling to make sacrifices -- this is a perfect case in point.

What you will need (calculate to your needs): 4 potatoes, 6 eggs, salt, and 1/2 large onion (so controversial). It's that simple. trust me. 

Cut the potatoes into small wedges, then cut them in four. It should look somewhat [like this](http://i.imgur.com/cB5IUYO.jpg\)). Fry lightly in olive oil until fully cooked and golden, add the minced onion mid way through. Do not fry in high heat, be patient! Personally, I like to caramelize the onions a bit. Add a generous amount of salt, there's nothing worse than a bland boring tortilla so don't be scared of the salt.

Whisk the eggs in a separate bowl and add a touch of salt. (taste your potatoes though! if they're too salty skip this step or add a minimal amount). Once the potatoes and onion are golden and slightly crispy blot them to get rid of excess oil and add them to the egg bowl. Mix them with the eggs but not too much as it creates unwanted air bubbles.

Choose an appropriate pan to make the tortilla, one with a strong handle and preferably teflon. Add a little bit of olive oil. Heat until high then add the potato and egg mix and lower to medium-high. 3 minutes in each side should do it if you want a slightly soft center. If you want your tortilla fully cooked then it takes 4-5 minutes.

I know this might seem extremely perfectionist and unnecessary but if you successfully pull this off it will reward you. No wonder every spanish person loves their mom's or grandmothers tortilla, makes for years of practice and failed attempts. Anyways, good luck!

- tirer au sort un ""affreux""  
- Quel pouvoir donner a ces gens tirée au sort
- La compétence d'une assemblé tiré au sort

Germany is noticeably more tolerant of anti-Islam rhetoric than the UK too. 

An example of fundamentally different attitudes would be that most of the German left is pro-Israel, in stark contrast to the Swedish left and if those two ever got together they would logically have to attack each other for being racists/anti-Semites ([Zionism is racism in Sweden](http://antisemitism.org.il/article/17314/sweden-mayor-malmo-zionism-racism), anti-Zionism is antisemitism in Germany).

true,Toppo,FINL,Finland,"Juhannus, while christian in name (John the Baptist, as an attempt to Christianize the pagan holiday) still remains largely a pagan holiday in Finland and as said, it is one of the most important holidays, if not the most important. While Christmas is quite commercial nowdays, midsummer remains as a holiday that is actually really festive and fun. For practical reasons the holiday is on the Saturday of the week with the summer solstice, so if the solstice is on Tuesday, the holiday is on Saturday, with the main celebration being on the eve, Friday.

Most of the people attempt to get to countryside on summer cottages. Traditions are:

- A lot of alcohol, barbecue and sauna is involved. And as it is summer, the birches have branches and it is optimal to spank yourself and others in sauna with birch branches. Feels good man.
- Bonfires everywhere. The larger the better. Largest ones are several meters high, built from old boats and other junk.
- Because of the amount of lakes and shoreline, it's common for people, especially men to drown while drunk, with the cliche being the bodies found with the pants zipper open as the men have tried to take a piss while drunk and fall to the water and drown. 
- Pagan magic. Like women picking seven different wild flowers (while naked and silent) and putting them under the pillow and you are supposed to see your future husband in your dreams. Variant of that: run naked seven times around a well and you will see the reflection of your future husband in the well.
- Combining the previous two to a ""magical foresight"": if you stand up on a boat while drunk you will see your future widow on the shoreline.
- There's also a morbid guessing every year: how many people will drown/die in total that midsummer
- Do stuff naked. Fuck, run on the fields in the night mist, swim, sauna, run some more naked in the misty fields, fuck, sauna.
- Remember to be drunk
- Also, remember to be drunk

true,Fuku22us33hima,FINL,Finland,"Very good post! However, calling this ""civil war"" is not right because it is actually Russia (Putin) fighting about control of Ukraine or parts of it with the help of ethnic-Russians, pro-russians etc. in Ukraine. A ""pure"" example of civil war was the American Civil War 1861-65. We've had a civil war also in Finland 1916. 

And Crimea. The seeds of the control were planted when Yanukovych got power. And Putins government has made obvious mistakes when Maidan happened. Was the 89 murdered in Maidan authorized by Yanukovych or Putin? Were is Yanukovych now? Yes, in Russia. 

It's really important that you show what kinda ""leaders"" there is in east-Ukraine. In many pictures, videos etc. I have seen ""titutshki"", criminals, hooligans who fight for money and Yanukovych hired those people to attack ie. in Maidan. Is those people hired by the pro-Russian people? And are they fleeing from the ranks because they are actually cowards? 

It's good to hear that there is pro-Ukraine ""oligarchs"" and it's important to west to understand that we should support the economy of Ukraine. There is rumors that Yanukovych, who stole Billions of Ukraine people money, is funding the separatism from Rostov-Na-Don, Russia.

To call the separatists as terrorists is IMO quite accurate because they are working for a outside power (Russia) and want to break a sovereign Country. And they use terror methods like kidnapping and assassin, executions etc. 

This situation is affecting us also. We are having serious discussions about applying a membership of NATO. And Russia has warned us for that. What is this world after 5 years, who knows. But one thing is sure: Russia has shown its eager face again...

In Russia Putin has managed to gain massive support through economic growth and ""clever"" media (propaganda). And he has been on a power trip after Sochi Olympics and possibly power drunk from the massive wealth he has ""gained"" from Gazprom (estimated 45Billion$'s but some say even 120...). Russia is in reality ruled by a council of Oligarchs, Siloviks. And if we look at the Eurasian Union, all the leaders are oligarch-dictators (Belarus, Kazakhstan etc.). A bunch of mafia bosses.

China brough 60% stake in Piraeus Harbor, invested 300 Million dollars and has already tripled the Containers Shipped in less than 1 year. 

This visit is mainly about buying 60% stake in Thessaloniki Shipping Harbor in Northern Greece and also Greece signed Multi-Billion deals to export Wine/Cheese/Veggies/Fruits and all kinds of other Organic food to China which is a new Market for Greek food. 

Greek Tourism MInister also met with Chinese Prime Minister to boost Chinese tourism to Greece which is also a new Market and has potential for 5-10 Million visitors a year by 2030.

**Natural Gas**

First Greece lowered its Gas Contract with Russia from 500$ to 380$ after improved outlook for Greece in Credit Agencies

3 LNG Terminals will be Built alongside the Pipelines and 3 Gas Fields in Western Greece have started in a Joint Italian/Greek Project alongside this Pipeline Deal

[Greece To supply Bulgaria and Romania with Gas, completely replacing Russian Gas in these countries](http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/06/04/greece-set-to-negotiate-with-algeria-on-lng/)

New Deal will make Greek Energy exporter for 1st time in History as they use new IGB Pipeline, due to be complete by Late 2014/Early 2015 to supply Romania and Bulgaria with Gas.(Note Romania/BUlgaria will also buy this gas to supply smaller countries around them also)

true,LordGravewish,PORT,Portugal,"Because most countries in the EU would actually prefer the EU parliament to have more power than the Council, since the EUParl is a much more open institution (though it should still be improved). A lot of what's wrong with the EU can be traced back to the fact that decisions are taken by few and forced on the many - Germany, France and the UK have way too much power in the Council.

On top of that, blackmailing Merkel publicly (""If you choose Juncker, we'll leave the EU"") when the public opinion in Germany was that Juncker won the vote and thus should have been elected didn't help, it only rallied people to Juncker's cause - if she were ever not to support Juncker now, she'd look weak to her voters and most likely lose the next election (I can imagine the opposition: ""Merkel and the CDU don't care about democracy and German people, they only care about doing what Cameron tells them to!""... She'd be ridiculed nationally for weeks.)  The only other way out would be for Juncker to give up the spot voluntarily, but he's said multiple times he won't.

Ironically, he might have actually succeeded against Juncker had he not publicly blackmailed Merkel. That or he would have come home with many assurances and a high post in the Commission (vice-presidency?) and saved face. Merkel didn't really want Juncker either, actually, but her hand was forced by Cameron's ridiculous blackmailing attempt. Now all he's going to get is a humiliating defeat and a Commission president he doesn't want who now hates his guts after witnessing the UK propaganda campaign against him and his family. He's also given even more ammo to UKIP through his vilification of Juncker than if he'd stayed quiet and done nothing (stuff like ""Cameron can't successfully stand up against the EUSSR!"" and even more calls for a referendum).

**tl;dr:** Public opinion in the EU (those that actually know about this, at least), including in Germany, is mostly on Juncker's side.

Everyone just assumes that it is blackmail and not a warning that the political situation in Britain will swing sharply against the EU. Saying that it is blackmail implies that this is manufactured, but the reality points to Cameron doing his best to beat back the rise of the UKIP against an increasingly skeptical public. This may actually force his hand in bringing forward the date of the referendum in order to maintain stability and prevent the rise of the radical right wing into the establishment politics. He's always been clear that he is favor of Britain staying in the EU. I find it interesting that in the past the UK has deferred to French objections to a nominee that Britain favored. Now when Britain objects they don't get the same deference? Can you see how from outside the EU it looks less like Britain is blackmailing EU member states and more like EU member states are betraying and treating Britain less fairly? I'm not surprised that British people want to leave, the EU seems like it is constantly condescending and spiteful towards them.

You assume that this is blackmail. Alternatively and more likely (and given the rise of the UKIP and Cameron's past defense of the UK's membership in the EU) is that this isn't a manufactured crisis that will cause him to bring forward the referendum but rather an unstable political situation where growing frustration could lead to the rise of a deeply destabilizing radical right wing. This is the inherent problem: Merkel and the rest of the EU sees this as a blackmail attempt, when really it could be Cameron trying to keep a political crisis from happening and the rise of wildcard radical parties that could fundamentally alter British politics. As somebody who has fought for Britain staying in the EU, it is quite remarkable that no one is giving him the benefit of the doubt (especially after the UKIP had the massive victory in the recent election.) It's not hard to see how the hardline course that Merkel and the rest of the European leadership could lead to an even greater destabilization of British politics. Think about it: in the past the UK has deferred to vehement French objections to the nominee, now when Britain has a serious issue the EU treats them with contempt. Not only is that unfair but it reveal a very ugly side of European anti-UK sentiment. From outside the EU it seems pretty clear that Germany and France treat Britain with disdain and contempt which they don't show to any other European power including Russia.

For imported words, there are no rules that I know of, and you actually hear people use different genders for the same words. Sometimes they use the gender of another word that does exist in german and is somehow related or a partial translation. Often, if you don't know for sure, you can fall back to neuter and it still sounds kind of correct.

Few examples:
Blog - masculine or neuter

true,ikannfrancais,null,null,"&gt; For imported words, there are no rules that I know of, and you actually hear people use different genders for the same words. Sometimes they use the gender of another word that does exist in german and is somehow related or a partial translation. Often, if you don't know for sure, you can fall back to neuter and it still sounds kind of correct.

Generally there are two schools of thought for new words:

* The first says foreign-imported words take the neuter. This is true for a lot of words imported from Latin.

* The second says it takes the form of a similar word that already exists in German. So Computer might be masculine (I don't know for certain so don't want to make any declarations, just an example that came to mind), because the German word that already existed for this was ""der Rechner"".

Even with these two considerations though, I think some words just don't make sense and end up with a gender through no real process at all aside from common consensus. I've always been confused about email. I'd have thought it'd be masculine like der Brief, but maybe the first form was interpretted like die E-Mail-[Addresse].

The thing about language is that it's not made by people sitting around deciding on rules. Language evolves and changes over time, and because of the way this happen, it leads to strange effects. Irregularities didn't necessarily start off as irregularities, but they evolved that way.

An example is ""das Weib"", an old word for ""the woman"". Why is it neuter? It's neuter because it evolved from an even older word (that now doesn't exist) that meant ""uterus"".

Why didn't people just start using only one gender and say ""das"" for everything? Well, some people have started doing something like that, only the languages they speak aren't now called ""German""; they are ""English"" and ""Dutch"" (in Dutch, this process is still continuing, so although the three genders still exist, the differences between them are becoming less distinct).
