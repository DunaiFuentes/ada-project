People are bound to disagree: that's the whole point of having freedom of expression. Just because your particular point of view isn't the most popular it doesn't mean that you're being oppressed.

I think you misunderstood me. I fully agree with what you say. I'm simply against opposing or even undemocratic views being ostracized or censored. That's the attitude I've encountered here, too — that those who criticize free speech or democracy have no right to either of those. That's the very attitude I'm against and which I feel is very undemocratic itself.

&gt;Sorry, you're not making any sense. It appears you're confusing things. A democracy only means you have a say on how state affairs are conducted, and consequently that public officials have the obligation of keeping the public informed.

&gt;As you're only mentioning opinions, I suspect that you're referring to freedom of expression.

Freedom of speech is prerequisite for democracy, and I believe that freedom must be applied even to those who criticize both the freedom of speech and democracy itself.

&gt;Even so, although you have the right to express your opinion, you don't have the right to force everyone to agree with you. Others also have the right to express their point of view. You have the right to get on that soap box, but that doesn't mean everyone should enthusiastically applaud your ramblings. If you believe everyone should be forced to agree with you and share your own opinion, no matter how absurd it might be, then you're not advocating freedom of expression as well.

I never said anyone has the right to force everyone to agree with them. I'm saying that those who believe so, however, should be guaranteed the right to express their opinions, too. That is, the freedom of speech should be applied even to those who advocate against it.

&gt;That's the whole point of a democracy: to let the people choose how their state affairs are conducted. You also have the right to freely associate with others. If you believe there should be an organization that is rigidly dedicated to an ideology and shouldn't stray away from it, you are free to set up that organization yourself. People actually do it, and some even get elected to public office right after their organization is set. If you feel you're not represented then why don't you do it yourself?

First of all, I'm not necessarily talking about myself. I'm stating my opinion on why I believe people are voting for fringe parties.

That's right, ""to let the people choose how their state affairs are conducted"". But two or three mainstream parties (who's main goal is to expand the voter base) cannot adequately represent the very diverse opinions of a huge population. They water down their policy so much in the hopes of expanding their voter base, that they actually start appealing to less and less people. The people don't feel like they're adequately represented.

Since very few people have the time and resources to associate into political parties that will represent their views adequately, and since they feel disillusioned with the presented, mainstream political menu, they choos the only option they have left — voting for the fringe parties with which they don't necessarily agree with, but which they still find better then the mainstream options.

&gt;I'm afraid that's not the reason people are voting on right wing politicians. In fact, in France the main reason why Front Nacional is gaining ground is that they're ceased fighting for a certain ideology, started to water down their program and rhetoric to appeal to a even bigger audience, and started to fight to expand their voter base.

Well, there's always the ideal middle ground. People are finding that the mainstream parties don't adequately represent them, because they seem too similar and watered down, but they still didn't want to vote for ""old"" Front National, because they probably considered them too extreme. When they watered down their extremism to a certain, acceptable extent — somewhere in between their previous extremism and watered down policies of the mainstream parties — they got more votes.",0,1411858048,null,0,false,0,cku9l4y,t3_2hlup6,t1_cku9l4y,t1_cktzuml,null,1426792485,2,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,2

I'll make an illustration so I don't write too much:

What if 51% of population of a certain country is *for* abolishing democracy and installing a dictatorship. What if the number is higher? What if it's 100%? Wouldn't it be democratic to abolish democracy, because it's the will of the people to do so? After all, democracy is all about people making the choices.

Prerequisite for democracy is freedom of speech. In an open and free debate, you offer your opinions and people judge them — they either (partially) support them or (partially) don't support. This is important, because it allows people to choose freely on the market of ideas, which helps democracy function properly by letting the people actively shape their future based on their ever changing world view.

If people genuinely would be for abolishing democracy, and, for the sake of democracy, you censor someone from advocating such idea — you would be limiting the freedom of the entire population to freely choose their future. You're limiting their exposure to ideas they could potentially accept, and thus you're limiting their freedom to choose, which is, I believe, very undemocratic.

&gt;I agree that political correctness is a bitch, but I wouldn't go as far as saying its biggest threat. And I find rather confusing why should opposing views be embraced by everybody? If Vaclav Klaus' speech is cancelled due to his … I don't know, lets say anti-gay marriage attitude, does the world obliged to listen to him even if nobody wants to?

I didn't say that opposing view *must* be embraced by everybody. Not at all. But I do think all views *should* be approach critically in a free society, whether you agree or disagree with them. That doesn't mean you should outright accept them or dismiss them. And the more you disagree with them, I believe you have the bigger moral obligation to debate them. If someone comes out into the public sphere with an opinion, he's inviting others to debate him. I think it would be much more beneficial for democracy to respond to their invite and openly debate the issue no matter how fringe the opinion seems, then ostracizing them or, not to mention, censoring them would.

Look at it this way: if you believe a person is very wrong, you should debate him (if he is open for debate; if he wants to impose his world view without debate, ignore him, don't censor him) because he would be a much bigger asset to society if you showed him he's wrong so he could change. If you don't have the arsenal to debate him, you should question your own world view, because you might be wrong.

La majorité des points que tu as soulevés répondent à des propositions qui ne sont pas dans le programme du FN, vu que tu ne l'as pas lu.

&gt;J'ai juste lu ce que les articles disiaent que le FN souhaitait abolir la double nationalité

Sans déconner, la presse déformerait les positions du FN ?

Incroyable, c'est pas comme si elle nous avait diabolisé pendant des décennies et qu'on n'avait que peu de temps pour parler là où les autres ont un accès prépondérant, sans parler du fait qu'ils ont le pouvoir depuis 40 ans...

&gt;dans ses discours publiques elle n'a jamais précisé que se ne serait pas le cas pour les citoyens de l'UE

On n'a pas le temps à la télé. Je te suggère [cette vidéo de Bourdieu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcc6AEpjdcY).

&gt;Non elles n'étaient pas foireuses c'est toi qui a mal chercher et qui a sauté sur des rapport passé et non ceux révisé par la BM .

Non. J'ai pris les rapports de la même source. 

Où vois-tu que le tien a les chiffres révisés et pas les miens ?

Où vois-tu que les ""remittances"" sont dues à une générosité des expatriés ?

Tu prends l'unique source qui t'arrange et comme les autres te contredisent, tu fais mine que les données ne sont pas valables. Le fait est que si les miennes ne sont pas valables, alors les tiennes non plus.

Et de toute façon j'ai déjà montré qu'il n'y avait aucune corrélation avec la double nationalité.

&gt;Tu ne m'a toujours pas montré quel est le lien avec la double nationalité dans tout les 4 messages que tu m'a écrit a part des fait anecdotiques , une conclusion de l'INSEE qui contredit ton point, des statitiques sur la détention des étrangers en baisse et des réponses qui viennent de toi et non de ton parti.

Ça n'a jamais été étudié. Encore une fois c'est un sujet tabou.

&gt;Immigrants coming from countries that have recently allowed dual citizenship are found not only to be more likely to naturalize but also to experience relative employment and earnings gains and to lower their reliance on welfare

Oui donc ton étude montre que les expatriés français gagneront plus et s'assimileront mieux à l'étranger que si la France interdit la double nationalité. Ça ne montre rien du tout sur le fait que les immigrés étrangers en France s’intégreront mieux ou moins bien en France si la France (pays d'accueil) interdit la double nationalité. L'effet sur le pays d'accueil n'est pas le même que sur le pays d'origine. Pour comparer, il aurait fallu comparer avec le cas où les US auraient interdit la double nationalité... Après, pas de données précises sur les naturalisés eux-mêmes, mais seulement sur les ressortissants de pays qui acceptent la double nationalité (ce qui mélange ceux qui ont la double nationalité, ceux qui gardent leur nationalité d'origine et ceux qui l'abandonnent) et avec les naturalisés qui ont abandonné leur nationalité d'origine.

Enfin, on s'en fout un peu vu que l'immigration augmente le chômage et baisse le salaire des natifs. Le programme du FN est de réduire l'immigration à 10 000 entrées par an. La double nationalité compense l'effet négatif produit par l'immigration (une hausse de la proportion d’immigrés d’un point de pourcentage réduit le salaire de 1,2 %), sans parler des effets fiscaux (0,5 point de PIB en France selon l'OCDE).

&gt;ici[2]
Une étude plus récente de 2008

Ce n'est pas une étude. C'est une suite de jugements de valeur sans aucune donnée pour appuyer leurs conclusions... Tu me déçois là.

&gt;On data from the 1990 and 2000 US censuses, immigrants recently granted dual nationality rights are found to be more likely to naturalize relative to immigrants from other Latin American countries. They also experience employment gains and drops in welfare use, suggesting that dual citizenship rights may promote economic assimilation

Fausse cause : ces études suggèrent plutôt que ce sont ceux qui ont les meilleurs revenus et le plus de chances de s'assimiler qui obtiennent une double nationalité.

Tout est résumé ci-dessous :

This result is consistent with the findings of Bloemraad (2004): using a unique feature of the Canadian censuses—which ask respondents to report multiple citizenship—she found that those with higher human capital were more likely to identify themselves as dual citizens. The positive correlation between education and responsiveness to dual citizenship rights might arise from different, not mutually exclusive, reasons. For example, the finding is consistent with the implied benefits of dual citizenship being higher for more-educated immigrants, as would be expected if education were correlated with higher career and income benefits from transnational activities. In addition, higher education might correlate with a greater sense of personal political efficacy. If so, people with more education might perceive a higher implied cost from naturalization when dual citizenship rights are denied.

La politique de double nationalité est encore une fois une politique pour les classes favorisées et non pour les classes populaires. Or ceux qui viennent en France sont majoritairement des classes défavorisées, des gens peu éduqués et pauvres qui ne bénéficie pas de la double nationalité.

Socialists, conservatives, liberals etc all fought for their beliefs because they believed they were right for everyone, and that their opponents were misguided

I don't understand what you're saying exactly. Each of them believed they're right and the other's before them were wrong; the same way you believe to be objectively right, while those before you were wrong?

&gt;nowadays we have more hard data to back our beliefs up.

And everyone before you believed they have the data to back their beliefs up, until new data was brought to light. Doesn't mean your beliefs won't be proven wrong when newer data then the current one is brought to light.

That's why I'm saying that it's important not to ostracize people with what appear to be fringe or undemocratic beliefs. They should be listened to and their ideas countered with solid arguments. It is undemocratic to censor someone because you believe their opinions to be undemocratic, or even if they truly are undemocratic.

&gt;Socialists are always disappointed when they elect a socialist leader who turns out to supposedly 'surrender' to business, but it's simply him finally understanding why socialism doesn't work, and never will.

If a good idea doesn't work because it gets corrupted, we shouldn't dismiss the idea outright. We should strive to improve it and we should address the problems of our society which make it possible for that idea to get corrupted.. Maybe it really isn't possible to implement the idea, but that doesn't mean we should settle for the next best thing, i.e. accept what we have now and ostracize anyone who criticizes it.

&gt;Same with conservative religion-based values - it's not a matter of opinion, or national character, it's just cold hard facts. The world is going to be homogeneously secular, liberal and market-driven bound by strong trans-national laws sooner or later, because all countries that don't follow that ideal are destined to poverty, corruption, violence and a long decline ending in revolution.

They're destined to poverty and violence because of corruption. Not only are globalization and liberalization not the only solutions to corruption, under their guise corruption can even be facilitated.

Still, the same way we shouldn't dismiss the ideas like socialism and communism because it is possible to corrupt them, we shouldn't dismiss globalization and liberalization due to their proneness to be corrupted.

I'm not saying either of these are right, and I'm certainly not saying, as some have misinterpreted my words, that we should allow others to impose their world views on us or the other way round. I'm saying that we should listen to opinions even of those whose beliefs completely oppose ours — even if those beliefs are undemocratic themselves — and certainly not censor them.

Where did you get that impression? I'm just saying that in a democracy, undemocratic beliefs should be allowed to be presented and argued for or against. If someone would rather be ruled by a dictator, it may be a disorder, but he should have the right to express his world view, and that world view should be discussed in an open and free debate, rather than outright dismissed, the person ostracized or, even worse, censored.

Free speech is prerequisite for democracy. And free speech includes the rights of those who are against free speech and against democracy. Furthermore, if you believe the person has a disorder, I believe you even have a moral obligation to show them why they're wrong, for their sake.

&gt;I will take pragmatic politician over ideological every time. What is wrong with trying to appeal to voters? After all parties are their representatives, so they introduce policies that the people want. I have no idea what is your desire, you want hardline parties just for the sake of having heated debates and comedy? I don't really understand this notion that there should be party A and party B and they should fight over every stupid thing, because one is right-wing and other is left-wing. Politics should be boring and pragmatic. It's not a goddamn circus.

Diversity is necessary for society to progress. If a parliament has diverse parties, there can be space for true debate. If the primary goal of political parties is to expand their voter base, they will try to raise as little criticism of and questions about our society and its problems as possible, because of the possibility of offending, and thus losing, a few voters.

And it doesn't mean that I'm supporting those fringe parties, especially not for the sake of circus. I'm just stating my opinion — that those people who vote for them dislike the reality they live in, and who else can they blame than the mainstream political parties. After all, they're the ones that decide on all the issues and establish all the laws, which would mean they're to blame for all the problems. People see that they have no one to vote for, and they vote for fringe parties, simply because they're different from the mainstream parties, in hope that they'll bring change or at least incite the mainstream parties to change out of fear of losing more voters, not necessarily because they agree with the fringe parties themselves.",0,1411859106,null,0,false,0,ckua0cu,t3_2hlup6,t1_ckua0cu,t1_cktxdtw,null,1426792286,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Ah, so very similar to our system. English is mandatory, in grade 7 you get to chose between french or latin (in gymnasium, in our ten years only school you chose between french or economics or something like that, as the second language is not required) and in grade 9 you get to chose from french, spanish or danish. At least in german sonderjylland, usually.

&gt;Languages are a perishable skill and because we use German so little most Danes simply forget. Even worse, because most children see German as an unnecessary chore most Danes don't learn that much German to begin with.

I do kind of understand why it's not popular in Copenhagen, but it bugs me that those from the border to apenrade learn less german than they did before. Seems kinda important for them. I only had two years of danish in school and can still read most danish and understand slowly-for-foreigner-spoken danish somewhat okay. And that's been twenty years ago ...

And, by the way, the reason that the US is doing better in comparison (or why Europe seems farther behind) is *because* it had a stimulus, not because it had better austerity. US austerity--or a falling deficit and cut spending--is only possible because the US has little to no social safety net and active opposition to it, and because it was the penalty for continued gridlock.

false,MauvaisConseil,YAFrance,France,"&gt; Explique moi alors comment tu règles la situation suivante Couple : 1 Français, 1 Brésilienne. La Brésilienne veut divorcer. La Brésilienne ouvre une procédure de divorce au Brésil, le Français, en France. 

Situation qui concerne des bourgeois mais passons.

S'ils résident en France, c'est la loi française qui s'applique. Sinon, ça ne regarde pas la France et je ne vois pas le problème.

&gt;Autre exemple, une française mariée à un maltais. En France reconnaissance du divorce, a Malte, pas de divorce possible. Tu fais quoi ?

Idem. S'ils résident en France, c'est la loi française qui s'applique. Sinon, on s'en fout.

&gt;Ainsi, a Malte, même s'ils ne font pas eux même de divorce, ils reconnaissent qu'il existe un droit international qui va permettre de résoudre le conflit de loi en renvoyant à une des lois des parties. Ils appliqueront les critères du conflit de loi, et s'il aboutit que la loi française est en effet applicable, ou que les jurisdictions française sont compétentes pour décider du divorce, alors celui-ci sera reconnu dans ses conséquences a Malte et on va pouvoir partager les biens et l'autorité parentale. Et le maltais pourra même se remarier vu qu'il est de nouveau célibataire.

C'est le problème de Malte et des Maltais. En France, c'est la loi française qui s'applique, c'est pas compliqué comme principe.

&gt;Le Droit international privé est nécessaire car les nations ne vivent pas en autarcie. A moins d'interdire à tous les français d'avoir ne serait-ce que des interactions, on ne peut que s'obliger à respecter dans certains cas les lois étrangères, pour assurer la sécurité juridique des Français à l'étranger, et des étrangers en France. C'est plus que normal. C'est logique.

On peut avoir des accords bilatéraux oui, mais appliquer la loi française en France fait partie du principe d'égalité : il n'y aucune raison pour que certains soient privilégiés en France parce qu'ils sont étrangers. Un pays n'est pas un hôtel. La loi n'est pas à la carte.

&gt;La PMA n'est pas une question d'ordre public international... car étant autorisée en France (dans certains cas) on ne peut invoquer l'OP. L'OP c'est pour des choses qui sont radicalement interdite en France, pas juste limités à certains cas. 

C'est quoi exactement la nuance ?

Dans le cas du mariage, il était aussi autorisé dans certains cas, ça a entraîné automatiquement la légalisation des couples homosexuels mariés à l'étranger ?

&gt;Ainsi un trouple musulman, qui vit en polygamie, et que le droit français tendra à considérer comme 2 couples, un marié, l'autre en concubinage, peut parfaitement être vu comme un mariage polygame pour certains de ces effets : Exemple, 1 homme marié (légalement à l'étranger) à deux femmes qui décède, si le droit des successions français s'applique (parce qu'ils ont la nationalité française et résident en France par exemple), et bien les deux épouses sont appelé à la succession égalitairement !

Et c'est un véritable scandale d'ailleurs.

Exemple que je transmets immédiatement au groupe de travail du FN qui convient ! Merci :)

&gt;Les exemples sont légion ! Je te conseille de jetter un rapide coup d'oeil à ce mémoire plutôt bien foutu sur la question : http://edoctorale74.univ-lille2.fr/fileadmin/master_recherche/T_l_chargement/memoires/personnes/labbea04.pdf

&gt; Par contre la PMA a l'étranger légale crée un lien de filiation entre une mère et un enfant. Ce lien de filiation est biologique et n'a jamais été remis en question. On va pas faire de l'enfant né par une PMA un orphelin en ne reconnaissant pas sa mère biologique pour des raisons d'OP, 

On est d'accord.

&gt;ce serait contraire à l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant, qui est un intérêt qui prime sur pratiquement tout en droit français.

Pas exactement. On a eu une tradition différente pendant des années (le droit des femmes primait avec l'accouchement sous X par exemple). Mais il y a eu une inflexion depuis 10-15 ans dans ce sens notamment sur pression européenne.

&gt;Or la seule condition légale qui pourrait empêcher une telle adoption c'est la fraude à la loi, et le fait que l'enfant ai une filiation à l'égard d'une autre personne (le donneur de sperme). Mais étant donné qu'il est impossible pour le droit Français de connaître ou même de reconnaitre comme parent le donneur, étant donné que la loi étrangère lui refuse la filiation (faut éviter d'avoir des situations ou une personne est père dans un pays mais pas dans l'autre...). L'enfant est bien dépourvu de toute autre filiation et est donc adoptable par le conjoint de la mère. Il se trouve que ce conjoint est une femme. Est-ce une fraude à la loi ? Et c'est là qu'intervient l'avis de la cass'. Etant donné que la loi française n'interdit pas stricto sensu la PMA, mais la limite seulement à certains cas, on ne peut pas considérer que la fraude à la loi soit manifeste et grave et l'intérêt de l'enfant prime alors sur ses considérations.

OK tu m'as convaincu qu'on ne pouvait faire autrement.

Etre marié à un étranger et vouloir divorcer c'est une situation de bourgeois ? Merveilleux. Merveilleux.

Ok, le lieu de résidence ? Bien sûr, c'est d'ailleurs souvent le critère de rattachement par défaut. Mais donc s'ils résident au Maroc et que le divorce à lieu par répudiation. Le divorce est légal à tes yeux et doit avoir des effets en France ? Ou ptet que le critère de résidence ne suffit pas... Par exemple, un couple de français, mariés en France, résidant a Malte avec des biens à Malte... pas de divorce possible ? Si l'un des deux reviens en France et que l'autre reste à Malte ? On considère que la résidence est ou ? Sans DIP, la décision maltaise ne peut être reconnu en France et la décision Française ne peut être reconnue à Malte. Du coup la femme qui échappe de son mari qui la bat mais qui a des biens à malte doit abandonner tous ses biens à Malte, et refuser d'y reposer les pieds au risque de se retrouver mariée puisque la décision française n'y est pas reconnue... 

Le DIP est un droit complexe qui répond nécessairement de situations complexes. 

Ah mais évidemment, ça ne concerne pas les français de souches qui se marient qu'entre français et vivent en France... Les vrais français, les autres sont des bourgeois que notre système juridique est en droit d'écraser pour satisfaire les aspirations nationalistes et souverainistes d'un groupe d'autarciques. 

Par exemple, mon exemple qui te scandalise : 2 femmes mariées à un homme dans leur droit, leur foi et leur esprit. Elles vivent avec lui en étant égales dans leur famille. Mais là toi, t’arrive et a volonté de sabrer du bourgeois et du différent d'une même baguette magique, bah tu décides de priver l'une de son bien et l'excluant de la succession. Car elle a travaillé toute sa vie à l'accumulation des biens du maris, tout autant que l'autre épouse, et de manière complètement bienveillante de sa part. Mais nan, elle n'a pas le droit, elle peut aller sous un pont, l'autre qui n'a contribué que pour la moitié des biens que les épouses ont apportés à la communauté se trouve exclue. Parce que vive la souveraineté, et le droit du peuple a gouverner le peuple quitte à niquer une autre partie du peuple, surtout si c'est une petite partie du peuple.

2. "". . . With the notable exception of the War of 1812, the United States did not face any significant foreign incursions in the 19th century. It contained the threat from both Canada and Mexico with a minimum of disruption to American life and in so doing ended the risk of local military conflicts with other countries. North America was viewed as a remarkably safe place.

    Even the American Civil War did not disrupt this belief. The massive industrial and demographic imbalance between North and South meant that the war's outcome was never in doubt. The North's population was four times the size of the population of free Southerners while its industrial base was 10 times that of the South. As soon as the North's military strategy started to leverage those advantages the South was crushed. Additionally, most of the settlers of the Midwest and West Coast were from the North (Southern settlers moved into what would become Texas and New Mexico), so the dominant American culture was only strengthened by the limits placed on the South during Reconstruction.

    As a result, life for this dominant 'Northern' culture got measurably better every single year for more than five generations. Americans became convinced that such a state of affairs -- that things can, will and should improve every day -- was normal. Americans came to believe that their wealth and security is a result of a Manifest Destiny that reflects something different about Americans compared to the rest of humanity. The sense is that Americans are somehow better -- destined for greatness -- rather than simply being very lucky to live where they do. It is an unbalanced and inaccurate belief, but it is at the root of American mania and arrogance.

    Many Americans do not understand that the Russian wheat belt is the steppe, which has hotter summers, colder winters and less rain than even the relatively arid Great Plains. There is not a common understanding that the histories of China and Europe are replete with genocidal conflicts because different nationalities were located too close together, or that the African plateaus hinder economic development. Instead there is a general understanding that the United States has been successful for more than two centuries and that the rest of the world has been less so. Americans do not treasure the 'good times' because they see growth and security as the normal state of affairs, and Americans are more than a little puzzled as to why the rest of the world always seems to be struggling. And so what Americans see as normal day-to-day activities the rest of the world sees as American hubris.

    But not everything goes right all the time. What happens when something goes wrong, when the rest of the world reaches out and touches the Americans on something other than America's terms? When one is convinced that things can, will and should continually improve, the shock of negative developments or foreign interaction is palpable. Mania becomes depression and arrogance turns into panic. . . .""

false,MauvaisConseil,YAFrance,France,"&gt; Mais ne viens pas faire semblant qu'il n'y avait pas de légitimité démocratique.

Je ne fais pas semblant. Toute délégation de souveraineté qui n'a pas été validée par référendum n'a pas de légitimité démocratique. Et j'irai même plus loin en considérant qu'il s'agit d'une trahison des représentants.

Sur la Convention, on a déjà la déclaration de 1789. Pas besoin d'une instance supra-nationale pour garantir les droits de l'homme, on a inventé le concept.

&gt;Ces étrangers, non élus (la non élection te gêne ? Les juges français aussi ?), sont les seuls garants dans notre société de droit fondamentaux que notre société estime.

Que l'élite estime. La société ne se réduit pas aux quelques bourgeois qui monopolisent le pouvoir.

&gt;Moi je suis européen, et j'apprécie grandement que notre grande Europe soit la pour défendre mes droits quand l'Etat français en oublie ou en piétine. 

Et moi je suis français, je n'apprécie pas que des étrangers viennent m'imposer des décisions sans l'avis du peuple.

&gt;Et à part le FN, la grande majorité du spectre politique français est d'accord dessus.

La grande majorité du spectre politique français était pour le oui au référendum de 2005. La grande majorité du peuple français n'a aucune confiance dans le spectre politique français (y compris le FN).

&gt;Va expliquer aujourd'hui à un Français que le mariage n'est pas un droit, soumet la question à un vote, et on verra bien le résultat.

C'est exactement ce qu'on demandait pour le mariage et l'adoption homosexuels.

&gt;Qu'importe, c'est notre souveraineté qui a fait du mariage un droit et une liberté fondamentale.

Pas vraiment non, c'est un glissement qui méconnaît les spécificités françaises et l'héritage de la Révolution.

&gt;Dans les mots du Conseil d'Etat

La source est [ici](http://www.conseil-etat.fr/fr/discours-et-interventions/la-nature-de-l-institution-du-mariage.html). Encore une fois nos élites européïstes vont nier la spécificité française pour des raisons idéologiques. Bref, rien de neuf.

&gt;Le Conseil constit la aussi reconnu en 1993

Toujours est-il que dans la Constitution le mariage n'est pas une liberté fondamentale.

&gt;Et il rend cette décision au visa de tout ce qui passe sous sa main et qui peut étayer sa position... sauf la CESDH

Dans ce cas non. Et en général il en tient compte implicitement.

&gt;Tu gueule parce qu'il ne fait pas tout ce qu'il a promis, et tu applaudis parce qu'il fait ce qu'il a promis.

Non. Ton argument de ""promesse"" ou de programme est invalide. C'est tout ce que je dis.

&gt;Tu as lu ce que j'ai écrit ?

Oui. J'ai noté que tu te contredisais.

&gt;Je disais que le problème des sondages c'est quand il sont pris dans des moments de sévère polarisation et médiatisation d'une question. Car l'opinion exprimée n'est plus vraiment celle d'un esprit raisonné, mais d'un positionnement idéologique ou tribal dans un camp qui s'affronte dans la sphère publique.

Et alors ? Ça vaut dans les deux sens. Des gens qui étaient férocement pour à l'époque sont mollement pour voire indifférents aujourd'hui.

Si je reprends ton argument, on constate aujourd'hui que [la moitié des sondés serait favorable à la peine de mort](http://www.lepoint.fr/societe/les-francais-fin-2013-sinistrose-et-forte-droitisation-cevipof-13-01-2014-1779779_23.php). Pourtant on est bien ""hors période de conflit social"".

&gt;Si c'est pour l'adoption, nope, les homosexuels peuvent adopter en tant que célibataires

Encore une fois, l'orientation sexuelle ne rentre pas en compte dans la loi.

&gt;Hors même les hétéros ne peuvent pas adopter en tant que couple sans être mariés.

Un enfant peut avoir deux parents de sexes différents qui ne sont pas mariés et ne l'ont pas été. Ce n'est pas le cas pour les couples de même sexe.

&gt;Tu dis être contre une loi qui ne reconnait pas le statut des beaux parents et celui des familles polygames.

Oui, mais ça n'a rien à voir avec un ""tout ou rien"". La loi Taubira n'est pas une loi sur la famille, c'est une loi communautariste de plus qui ne règle rien, et surtout pas l'égalité. Je suis contre le fait qu'un petit lobby bourgeois supplante la volonté du peuple. Mes trois phrases successives forment un ensemble.

&gt;et la loi sur le mariage gay a au moins réglé une partie du problème

Laquelle ? Les entretiens de familles homosexuelles ont au contraire montré que ça ne réglait rien.

&gt;J'adore le : Fait-pas-ça-et-laisse-moi-le-faire. 

Il n'y a pas de jugement subjectif dans ma proposition : tu parles d'une loi qui bénéficie à quelques milliers de personnes tout au plus. Je parle de mesures qui touchent des dizaines de millions de personnes.

&gt;D'une part ta liste est bien entendu entièrement objective et pas du tout subjective

Ma liste est une liste exhaustive des promesses non tenues à ma connaissance, il y en a surement d'autres, j'ai mis toutes celles que je connaissais.

&gt;D'autre part, le droit des minorité est nécessairement un droit qui ne concerne pas directement la majorité, mais c'est pas pour autant que l'on doit l'ignorer, sinon jamais les minorités n'auraient de droit.

La République ne reconnait pas les minorités. Les minorités n'ont pas de droits spécifiques en France. En particulier il n'y a pas et il n'y avait pas de distinctions entre homosexuels et homosexuels que ce soit avant ou après cette loi.

&gt;Et vu l'engagement que cette question à suscité dans la société française, j'ai du mal a comprendre comment tu peux dire que tout le monde s'en foutait.

Je n'ai pas dit que tout le monde s'en foutait. Simplification classique de l'antiFN moyen... Tu me déçois. J'ai dit ""Ce n'était pas fondamental vu que la majorité s'en foutait royalement et qu'elle ne concerne que quelques milliers d'individus.""

&gt;Moi elle ne me concerne pas directement, mais pourtant je suis très pour, et très heureux qu'elle soit passé.

Tant mieux pour toi mais la majorité de la population a toujours considéré que cette question était secondaire. Prends n'importe quelle enquête d'opinion, y compris au cœur des débats.

&gt;C'est aussi le rôle du gouvernement que de réguler des situations qui ne concernent pas toute la France. Le statut des intermittents concerne une minorité de français, des mesures les concernant doivent être prises.

Et alors ? Ça n'en fait pas une mesure fondamentale pour autant.

&gt;Tu sembles complètement ignorer que c'est une question très importante pour une grande partie de la gauche.

Non, j'affirme que la majorité des Français considère que ce n'est pas une question importante.

&gt;Et heureusement que dans notre société on puisse avoir de l'empathie pour un groupe systématiquement discriminé dans l'histoire

Pff, les homosexuels sont statistiquement plus riches et éduqués que les  hétérosexuels, de la victimisation pour faire pleurer dans les chaumières mais sans aucun élément derrière. Ça fait depuis 1791 que ce n'est plus illégal en France alors bien tenté mais non, ce n'est absolument pas un groupe systématiquement discriminé dans l'histoire.

&gt;Tu sais... parfois protéger une minorité c'est une façon de protéger l'intérêt général.

Tiens ça me rappelle Nietzsche : il faut protéger les forts des faibles...

&gt;Quand à l'aspect privilégié des homosexuels... comme s'ils étaient un groupe uniforme, merci, mais je passe.

Je n'ai pas dit qu'ils étaient un groupe uniforme. Par contre, ils sont plus qualifiés et font plus d'études que les hétérosexuels en moyenne, oui.

false,MauvaisConseil,YAFrance,France,"&gt; Etre marié à un étranger et vouloir divorcer c'est une situation de bourgeois ?

Non, la situation que tu décris entre un Français et une Brésilienne est une situation de bourgeois. Les immigrées brésiliennes en France sont à plus de 80% des catégories privilégiées et à 20% des étudiantes... Mais passons, vraiment, ça me faisait rire que tu prennes cet exemple parmi les centaines d'exemples possibles, c'est tout.

&gt;Ok, le lieu de résidence ? Bien sûr, c'est d'ailleurs souvent le critère de rattachement par défaut. Mais donc s'ils résident au Maroc et que le divorce à lieu par répudiation. Le divorce est légal à tes yeux et doit avoir des effets en France ?

Ce serait quoi exactement les effets en France ? Je croyais que la Brésilienne divorçait au Brésil et le Français en France ?

Ensuite, la répudiation n'est pas reconnue en France. Fin du problème.

Au passage, je l'ai déjà dit ailleurs mais de mon côté je suis pour que les mariages faits à l'étranger ne soient pas reconnus en France sauf accord bilatéral. En particulier des pays qui ne reconnaissent pas l'égalité des époux seraient automatiquement disqualifiés.

&gt;Par exemple, un couple de français, mariés en France, résidant a Malte avec des biens à Malte... pas de divorce possible ? Si l'un des deux reviens en France et que l'autre reste à Malte ? On considère que la résidence est ou ?

Si c'est un couple de Français, la loi française s'applique naturellement, il n'y a pas de question à se poser.

&gt;Sans DIP, la décision maltaise ne peut être reconnu en France et la décision Française ne peut être reconnue à Malte.

Quelle décision maltaise ?

&gt;Ah mais évidemment, ça ne concerne pas les français de souches qui se marient qu'entre français et vivent en France...

Pff, toujours mépriser quand on n'a pas d'argument... Bref, pas au niveau.

&gt;Les vrais français, les autres sont des bourgeois que notre système juridique est en droit d'écraser pour satisfaire les aspirations nationalistes et souverainistes d'un groupe d'autarciques.

Le système juridique devrait effectivement se soucier un peu plus des petits et non des bourgeois, effectivement. J'imagine que c'était ce que tu voulais dire.

&gt;Mais là toi, t’arrive et a volonté de sabrer du bourgeois et du différent d'une même baguette magique, bah tu décides de priver l'une de son bien et l'excluant de la succession.

Ouais, sans aucun problème avec l'interdiction actuelle de la polygamie.  Note que je suis en faveur d'une suppression du mariage et d'une définition de la filiation décorrélée du mariage. Je suis par ailleurs contre l'héritage en général (25% de la fortune par enfant, tout le reste va à l'état).

Mais si elles sont dans une famille polygame il fallait faire un testament en droit français. C'est aussi simple que ça.

&gt;Car elle a travaillé toute sa vie à l'accumulation des biens du maris

Plus probablement car elle a touché les allocs en tant que mère célibataire la plus grande partie de sa vie (cas de 70% des mères maghrébines). Si c'est une Africaine des pays d'Afrique sub-saharienne, il est plus probable que l'argent soit parti au pays et qu'il ne reste rien en France à la mort du mari. Dans les deux cas, leur place est à l'étranger. Elles n'auraient pas du venir en France, elles n'auraient pas du se mettre dans cette situation de polygamie en France. C'est leur faute, elles se démerdent.

&gt;Parce que vive la souveraineté, et le droit du peuple a gouverner le peuple quitte à niquer une autre partie du peuple

Si elles sont polygames elles n'ont pas respecté la loi française. Elles peuvent donc aller se plaindre ailleurs.

After that, yes, you need to get a French license. There is no agreement between California and France, so a California license is not recognized in France, and vice-versa.

There are two tests:

* Theoretical (""code""), much harder than at the California DMV. You must study seriously, or you will fail. You can take the test with a court-certified interpreter.

* Practical aka driving test -- also harder than in CA where you just drive around the block. You need to show up with a specially equipped car that has pedals for the instructor/examiner.

Two options to take the test:

* ""Candidat libre"", i.e. not going through a traffic school. You will have to fill out a special form, which you can get from the préfecture. You will need to wait months to get a slot. You will need to study on your own and to rent one of those special cars.

* Going through a traffic school: you will get priority over ""candidats libres"", but you will still wait a long time to get a slot. They won't let you take the theoretical test until they think you're ready. But they will provide you with plenty of studying resources for said test. After that you can drive for an hour or two with an instructor so they can see you know how to drive, and give you tips for the driving test. Expect to pay hundreds of euros for all this.

The whole thing is crazy. They let you drive for a year with a California license, then all of a sudden you have to start from scratch. Even more maddening is the delay to take the test. French bureaucracy and budget restrictions at their finest.

In spite of all this you don't really have a choice. If you drive without a valid license, you may well lose your insurance coverage. In case of a big accident, this could literally bankrupt you.

Hits a bit too close to home, because a good friend bought their primary (and only) residence from Aristo, has nearly completely paid of the mortgage, but with new Memorandum-mandated law voted by the parliament regarding unsecured loans combined by the fact that they didn't receive a title deed means that the bank will get to foreclose on them in 2015 because Aristo didn't pay up and technically he still owns the houses he sold. The opposition parties trying to introduce an amendment exempting primary residences from foreclosures, but the president vetoed it, so they dropped it.  

* 350 Syrian refugees with a route to Italy encounter bad weather west of Cyprus, send a distress signal, and they were rescued by a Cypriot civilian ship. The majority of the refugees refused to disembark in Cyprus, so the anti-terror squad had to force them off the ship. The people smugglers (4 of the passengers) were put under arrest, the rest will be detained pending until there's a final ruling on their asylum claim.

false,EdGG,null,null,"Catalonia contributes greatly to Spain, and gets usually less than what they give; Madrid, on the other hand, contributes more than Catalonia, and receives way less. So why do they complain? Catalonia's independence is mostly a political tactic to get leverage/funding/voters.

Management of Catalonian's resources at a regional level isn't good at all, so there is definitely no guarantee that they'll be much better without the support of Spain's infrastructures and services, which would very possibly be a new point of negotiation for them. After all, if they choose to stop contributing to maintaining certain things, it seems only fair that their access to them will be limited.

 That being said, it seems pretty short-sighted that they would effectively segregate from Spain. Many companies that don't approve of this segregation might actually move to Spanish territory, so those taxes might be off the table for Catalonians.

 The autonomic/regional system in Spain works this way: every autonomy contributes to the central government a part of what they make. Then, the money is divided and given to each autonomic region according to their needs. This way, the richer regions give more than they receive, and the poorer ones get more than they give.

 To me, this makes perfect sense; growing up, my parents gave me more than I gave them, because they could, and I could not. And if at some point I can provide to my family what they need, even if that means that I won't be able to get what I would if I kept the money for myself, then that sounds fair too. Maybe that's just how I was raised.

 Now, Catalonia (as well as Spain as a whole) wants to segregate because... well, they're struggling economically. So, as a richer ""family member"", it's gotten tired of contributing more so the rest of Spain can survive. It was... kind of okay before, when things went well, but now it sucks for everyone, and I guess the approach to this is one of ""every state for itself"" rather than the previous ""all for one, one for all"".

 Do I understand this mindset? Yes. Do I agree with it? I'm afraid not. I look up to the ones who prefer to struggle as a part of a community, and do not so with the ones that escape the sinking (yet rescuable) ship at and let the rest deal with their own shit.

go to the produce section at Carrefour. Look at the price of, let's say apples. You will notice that once you convert Euros to dollars (x .79) it's ...about the same price! but...wait..in France it's in kilos. here in the US..lbs. You have to multiply by 2.2

In Croatia there is a special law for government workers and if you try to fire them they even have their own ""court"" that decides whether to fire one or not. And let's guess their decisions.

I meant workers - you have to admit that unionised workers are just as capable of abusing the system to demand benefits at the expense of everyone else as big business. Often more likely - a law that benefits one business may hurt another business, meaning that the top 1% don't all benefit from the same legislation. GM and Chrysler can lobby to restrict the growth of Tesla, and vice versa. The point is that this kind of lobbying for benefits and regulation should be greatly restricted down to just pollution and safely laws.

&gt; The only way to ensure corporation care about that is making said abuse illegal. Which means more regulation. Which is exactly what they are trying to undermine.

Abuse of power almost always means preventing competition. They do this by lobbying government for subsidies, or regulation that ensures that only their business is 'up to standard'. Comcast is a good example. The US system is corrupt precisely because the senators from the states that house big corporations insist on protections for those businesses at taxpayer expense to vote on bills.

&gt; Otherwise, if it's not illegal, and if your employer can not pay you just by labelizing it ""unpaid internship"" instead of ""work"" and spend your wage on another car for themselves; they do it (yeah we made unpaid internships illegal in france. But look how the US consider us on our work related laws... ""those insane socialocomunists who prevent work being done"").

They don't want to hire full time workers because government forces them to pay healthcare, or they risk lawsuits, or they have to pay severances if they have to fire them, etc. In Denmark it's easy to fire people, so it's easy to hire people - we just have government backed unemployment insurance and free healthcare. We don't even have a minimum wage, but our wages even for low income jobs are high because government butts out and leaves the negotiations to the representatives of unions and business, which is very effective. The unions have just as much an interest in maintaining high employment as they do good wages and benefits, so negotiations tend to go smoothly, as they are all working off the same economic data.

Nel pensiero comune i danni del fumo appartengono a due categorie principali: il cancro e l'arteriosclerosi/infarto miocardico/ictus.

Il danno polmonare è derubricato a rottura di coglioni, che sparisce entro qualche anno (5, secondo la vulgata) quando si smette.

Tre osservazioni:

* il danno polmonare è cumulativo e solo parzialmente reversibile;
* il danno si avverte poco perché di solito sfruttiamo poco della funzionalità dei nostri polmoni, quindi si può accumulare ignorato;
* il danno polmonare con le sue conseguenze sistemiche (tecnicamente broncopneumopatia cronica ostruttiva, BPCO) è correlato ad un calo della qualità della vita.

TL;DR quando pensi alla lotteria genetica che, forse o forse no, potrebbe portarti ad avere un infarto a 60 anni, ma a te non succederà, potresti perdere di vista il punto che quotidianamente la forza del tuo organismo e la qualità della tua vita - magari di poco, inavvertitamente, ma regolarmente - diminuiscono.

I don't think so - most beliefs are based on feelings and assumptions with very little data to back them up. Communists are usually old people or clueless youngsters precisely because they have no idea what they're talking about. But even then, they are allowed to voice their opinions - the fact that people don't respect their opinions or give them lots of TV air time is no the same as censoring them.

&gt; If a good idea doesn't work because it gets corrupted, we shouldn't dismiss the idea outright. We should strive to improve it and we should address the problems of our society which make it possible for that idea to get corrupted.. Maybe it really isn't possible to implement the idea, but that doesn't mean we should settle for the next best thing, i.e. accept what we have now and ostracize anyone who criticizes it.

Agreed, but the whole lesson should be that we should always be willing to change and adapt to new information, embrace new ideas etc, and that can only be done in a democracy with many political parties and a free press. Business needs to adapt to changing times and new competition if the economy is to succeed, and that can only happen in a low-regulation market economy. In those circumstances, if you needed to promote social values, or increase military spending, or give more money to the poor, or restrict immigration, or whatever other measures that you would normally associate with communism, fascism, anarchism, religious fundamentalism, then it would happen - but those four I just mentioned would never be able to create a functioning state on their own because they refuse to acknowledge new information or debate and dogmatically insist on their own righteousness. 

If someone says 'I think the poor in my country have a rough time, lets look at the data and try to find a solution to that', then that's fine. If they say 'I think the poor have a rough time, *therefore I'm a communist*', he probably doesn't know what he's talking about.

&gt; drunk

Drinking culture in Spain is different than Ireland. Getting drunk is usually not the objective of drinking, the social aspect is a lot more important. You don't see many young adults (say, 25 y.o. and up) overly, or even visibly drunk, but obviously kids might get rowdy during ""botellones"" (basically gatherings in parks drinking store bought alcohol). Drinking 10 pints would be a lot more than an average Spanish person would drink. They, on the other hand, would enjoy alcohol more frequently (a beer for lunch every day is quite normal). If you can manage 10 pints without being a nuisance, it wouldn't be rude, just don't expect many people to keep your pace.

&gt; smoking

There is an indoor smoking ban in Spain, just like Ireland. Outside, on terraces, you're free to smoke, and many people still do. Be aware of your surroundings, try to sit next to other people smoking and not families with babies and small children, and you should be fine.

&gt; talk to strangers

Most Spanish are pretty welcoming towards strangers, especially in smaller cities. Most won't speak English, but appreciate your effort tot try to speak Spanish, and will help you along.


&gt; English

It's not directly rude to only speak English, but you'll miss out on a lot. Definitely prioritize getting up to a basic conversational level as fast as you can. Start using Duolingo or a similar app today to increase your vocabulary a bit further.

In /r/europe when people start to discuss about fiscal transfer, they usually mean permanent transfers and this is a problem. For example in this thread there are many who question Catalonia's stance on just being greedy or selfish, but how many question the Spanish central governments way of handling money or how other parts of Spain handle it. If other parts of Spain have been pumped money decade after decade without any results, then shouldn't there be some changes?

The existence of the EU certainly helps these regionalist movements, as they now consider that within the EU they can all be sovereign and be fine, be protected, and count for something.

But with the current state of the EU, ie not a federation, this balkanization is undesirable to me. If the EU is simply full of small region-states it's not going to weigh much as every region will follow its own interests. Already now we're having difficulties with that, and the only power projection the EU can offer is thanks to the larger economies and countries, mainly Germany for its economy, but also France and the UK (which also have the military to boot). 

Now I rather wish that this drive for closer integration would push countries together, to form larger nations within the EU, within reason and according to cultural and historical factors, instead of separating. I've seen many people here say that the larger EU countries should separate so that the nations will be more equal, as they'd be pulled down to the population and size level of the smaller EU countries. Well, screw you, it's your small countries which should unite if you want to weigh more within the Union.

But lets suppose it is possible. First off, youll want to have a complete overview of basic german grammar. You dont need to know it all by heart, but it will help with reading comprehension. There are several books and internet resources for this. The first product I ever used was Living Language Complete German. I recommend it. It introduces grammar logically, and has good vocab (doesnt just focus on travelers stuff).

After that, start reading. Pick texts at your level. Dont overload yourself. Look up any word you dont know. Learn it. A common mistake learners make is they kinda breeze through books without comprehending everything. In fact, you might even just want to read short stories, so you can read them a second time. Avoid classics. Your in too much of a hurry to deal with 19th century german. If you can get audiobooks, then listen while you read. Repeat out loud. Www.vorleser.net.

At the same time, you should start talking as much as you can. If you know someone irl who can help you, great. If not, hit up a website like www.conversationexchange.com (free) or www.mylanguageexchange.com (cheap). I use both. The people are great. You meet people and skype or email each other. If you live in a big city, you can often find expats through this site too.

Podcasts are a great way to make sure you are constantly hearing German. Search for podcasts by deutsche Welle. They are often designed for learners. Watch the entirety of Jojo sucht das Glück. There are 2seasons. Each episode is like 5-ish minutes. Dont move on until you have understood EVERYTHING. Ask reddit if you need help. When you are done with that try ""langsame gesprochene Nachrichten."" Check the dw.de website for the vocab list for the Nachrichten.

One thing that also does help is RIGHT NOW, go on youtube and find 10 videos in german where you have no clue whats going on. Save the links. Once a week, check one of the links, and youll be surprised in a few weeks to see that these videos that once made no sense are now starting to have meaning. Dont spend a lot of time on this though.

Your brain has to get your lungs, vocal cords, lips, jaws and tongue to coordinate in very precise and exact ways.

When you're having to make sounds that aren't in your native language, you're trying to get your brain to do something it hasn't spent the last 15 or 20 years practicing.

In the case of a word like ""Schauspielerin"", if you're using the standard German pronunciation, you have to raise the back of your tongue against the uvula, and then quickly shoot it forwards in time for the tip of the tongue to meet the alvoelar ridge just behind the upper teeth for the ""n"".

My advice at this stage would be not to worry about it too much. Keep practicing, but try not to worry about the tiny details for now. You need to concentrate on vocab and grammar; there's no point in having a perfect accent if you can't understand what people are saying to you. The chances are you will always have a foreign accent (I was one of the best in my class for pronunciation and have lived in Germany now for 20 years, and people can still detect an accent, although they can't usually put their finger on what my accent is), but that's okay.

Prime sigarette a 14-15 anni, una ogni tanto, scroccate agli amici più grandi ( e a mia sorella ).  Ho cominciato a fumare assiduamente a 20 anni  durante il servizio militare per noia, dopo aver provato qualche marca di sigarette sono passato al tabacco sfuso.  Old Holborn blu (e Rizla corte) per un sacco di anni, poi è uscito l' Old Holborn giallo e sono passato a quello. 

Trovo che rollare aiuti ad evitare il gesto automatico di accendersene una e quindi a tenere sotto controllo il consumo. Io non fumo poco (un pacco da 40g mi dura circa 5 giorni) ma non sono scimmiato come i fumatori di sigarette che conosco.  Se finisco il tabacco non chiedo sigarette in giro (mi disgustano) e non esco apposta per comprarlo.

Negli anni ho affinato anche la rollatura ad hoc. La siga da lavoro è sottile e super compatta, se non tiri si spegne, la puoi poggiare e riprendere quando vuoi o tenerla spenta all'angolo della bocca. La siga del dopocaffè mattutino è sottile e poco pressata, praticamente 4 tiri ed è finita, giusto da mischiare il sapore del fumo con quello del caffè. La siga digestiva dopo pasto è quella pesante, bella cicciotta e a pressatura media.

Non ho mai pensato seriamente a smettere. Forse è il momento di iniziare a farlo, non lo so. Non ho altri vizi, cerco di mangiare decentemente, bevo pochissimo, non mi drogo più. Togliere anche il fumo potrebbe essere la ciliegina sulla torta. Boh, non ho voglia di pensarci ora.

I don't know if you are Catalan but Cataloanis need to stop thinking they were/are the center of government hate in Spain now, or even during Franco. There are shit for everyone and even though Asturias is a poor region right now it is on par in taxes to Catalonia.

Over the next 10 minutes, similar noises were reported by passengers and other crew. At about 01:15, the visor separated in which the ship's bow door opened and the ship immediately took on a heavy starboard list (initial 30 to 40 degrees, but by 01:30, the ship had rolled 90 degrees) as water flooded into the vehicle deck. Estonia was turned to port and slowed before her four engines cut out completely.

At about 01:20 a weak female voice called ""Häire, häire, laeval on häire"", Estonian for ""Alarm, alarm, there is alarm on the ship"", over the public address system, which was followed immediately by an internal alarm for the crew, then one minute later by the general lifeboat alarm. The vessel's rapid lean and the flooding prevented many people in the cabins from ascending to the boat deck. A Mayday was communicated by the ship's crew at 01:22, but did not follow international formats. Estonia directed a call to Silja Europa and only after making contact with her the radio operator uttered the word ""Mayday"". In English, the radio operator on Silja Europa, chief mate Teijo Seppelin replied: ""Estonia, are you calling mayday?"" After that, the voice of Andres Tammes took over on Estonia and the conversation shifted to Finnish. Tammes was able to provide some details about their situation but due to loss of power, he could not give their position, which delayed rescue operations somewhat. Some minutes later power returned (or somebody on the bridge managed to lower himself to the starboard side of the bridge to check the marine GPS which will display the ship's position even in a blackout condition), and the Estonia was able to radio their position to Silja Europa and Mariella. The ship disappeared from the radar screens of other ships at around 01:50, and sank at 59°23′N 21°42′E, about 22 nautical miles (41 km; 25 mi) on bearing 157° from Utö island, Finland, in 74 to 85 metres (243 to 279 ft) of water.*

&gt; Tous les élèves de Polytechnique, ayant le statut d’élèves officiers, sont logés et rémunérés. On estime à 48.000 euros ce coût, que les diplômés doivent rembourser s’ils ne se dirigent pas à la sortie vers le service de l’Etat.

Cela n'est pas correct, d'après [cet article de rue89](http://rue89.nouvelobs.com/rue89-eco/2012/11/20/marc-22-ans-eleve-polytechnique-pour-1-147-euros-par-mois-237114) qui interroge un élève de l'X sur son budget :

&gt; La « pantoufle », c’est la somme que doit rembourser un Polytechnicien s’il interrompt ses études en cours de route. « Rarissime », commente Marc. Les 40 000 euros correspondent aux soldes perçues pendant la scolarité.
Autre cas : la centaine de diplômés qui sort de l’école « dans un grand corps de l’Etat » (les Mines, Ponts et chaussées) doit dix ans de service à l’Etat. S’il part dans le privé avant terme, il paie la pantoufle.

  &gt;  « Par le passé, la pantoufle concernait tout élève ne travaillant pas pour l’Etat à la sortie de l’école. Mais elle ne concerne plus que les “corpsards”, en raison de la baisse des places dans les corps et de la privatisation des entreprises publiques.Polytechnique pourrait toutefois la rétablir pour tous ceux qui partent dans le privé à partir des promotions 2013 ou 2014. Sur le principe, cela ne choque pas grand-monde chez nous, sauf qu’il y a eu un manque de concertation. »


Enfin, un dernier truc qui m'agace dans l'article :

&gt; Est-il normal, dans ces conditions, que Polytechnique, où enseignent près de 1.000 scientifiques, ne figure pas dans les 300 premières universités et écoles mondiales du classement de Shanghaï, alors que l’Ecole Polytechnique de Zurich est 19e ?  Que l'école ne soit que 70e au classement du Times en 2013 (reculant de 8 places par rapport à 2012) ? Hormis Maurice Allais, Nobel d’Economie en 1988, l’X n’a pas formé de Nobels. Gérondeau se demande donc si la composante scientifique de l’X est la bonne aujourd’hui : ""Il faut s’interroger sur la finalité d’une école excessivement centrée depuis son origine ou presque sur les mathématiques abstraites"" ajoutant  que ""beaucoup d’élèves ne comprennent pas la finalité de l’enseignement qui leur est dispensé"".

Le classement de Shangaï, c'est du n'importe quoi et le principe même de classer des universités est douteux du point de vue de la métrique. Si on considère que le nombre de papiers publiés par les chercheurs sans prendre en compte leur qualité par exemple.

Quant aux élèves qui ne comprennent pas la finalité de leurs études, pour être passé par ce genre de système, ce n'est pas une anomalie, c'est quelque chose de voulu.

L'idée, c'est que ""qui peut le plus, peut le moins"". Et si tu es capable d'absorber l'abstraction théorique, tu seras beaucoup plus à même de gérer des problèmes concrets plus simples et si un jour il te faut te plonger dans la théorie pour comprendre un résultat incorrect ou hors paramètres, tu seras plus à même de le faire que quelqu'un qui n'a fait que des exercices d'application.

La formation d'ingénieurs à la française, c'est de ne pas former juste des ""code monkeys"", c'est-à-dire des mecs qui savent juste appuyer des boutons dans un logiciel de calcul mais quelqu'un qui comprend les fondements de l'outil dont il se sert. Et ce qu'on perd en sens pratique est largement compensé par le niveau de compétences ainsi acquis dans les domaines de pointe.

Tous mes camarades qui sont allés étudier en angleterre ou aux Etats-Unis dans le système anglo-saxon n'ont pas été bluffés par le niveau scientifique : ils ont tous dit que les français étaient bien meilleurs sur ce niveau là. La contre partie, c'est que les français avaient moins l'état d'esprit entrepreneuriat et manager, ce qui à mon sens peut s'acquérir avec l'expérience tandis que si tu n'as pas des bases théoriques quand tu commences ta carrière, tu ne les récupéreras jamais.",0,1411897671,null,0,false,0,ckuljnl,t3_2hophm,t1_ckuljnl,t3_2hophm,null,1426786344,15,false,france,t5_2qhjz,15

* 5000 people strong Anti-gay protest was held in Belgrade. Prime Minister openly said he wouldn't come to the gay pride parade. Police officers went on strike because they don't want to be at the gay parade.

* A while ago the most popular political TV show was shut down because of criticism against prime minister. Immediately after that, private pro-government media published stories that the journalist in question (host of the political talk show) had an offer from some other private TV station. The journalist has since then come forward and denied that. She says it is just an attempt to silence the show and that the offer by the private TV station was made up to try and look like the PM was not involved in shutting down (the private TV station that supposedly made an ""offer"" to her is pro-prime-minister). That is just one in a long string of censorship incidents since Vučić has become prime minister. Some have said that the media climate and freedoms are worse than during 90s under Milošević.

* Putin will come to Belgrade

* it was decided that the gay pride parade would be held. police is on strike. police from other parts of the country are instead brought to belgrade. tons of special forces are in belgrade

Once there is such majority and the changes have been proposed, there has to be a referendum across the whole country and people will vote, once the vote ends the cameras s have to resign and there have to be new elections, then the new government process with the changes (if the people voted Yes in the referendum).

I'm pretty sure France wouldn't be prepared for any major concessions, like something on financial contributions or punching any major holes in the single market.

Looks to me like there isn't much for him to renegotiate in the first place. UK has pretty much opted out of anything that could conceivably be given to opt outs already. afaik, if it participates in anything beyond the single market and CAFP, it does so on an opt-in basis or with veto. 

There's precedent for single market states to be exempt from CAP and fisheries, so I can see that happening, but prob at the price of the rebate, which should roughly even most of the fiscal gains out.

Now, if the UK veto were on the negotiating table, I could actually see some interesting deal being possible. But that starts to barely count as membership anymore. 

If they were independent, we'd prob accept any partial comprehensive free trade deal they care to make; its still in everyone's interest to liberalize trade to the extent its liberalizable.

True and I hope they exercise that right. But I don't see why you would take away the ECHR as an additional means of appeal.

As for the quote, it's relevant because the Conservative party, along with the press in the UK, makes a big deal out of continued British membership of the ECHR whenever there is a controversial ruling. My point is that any institution, particularly a Court, is likely to come out with controversial/divisive rulings. 

Also despite the Daily Mail claiming that the UK loses 75% percent of cases against it in the ECHR, the reality is that the UK has one of the lowest rates of defeat before the court and that many cases that come before it are rejected as inadmissible.

If someone advocates openly against freedom of speech and democracy, he's right to do so shouldn't be taken away from him as long as he does it democratically, without force. Even more so if he gets support from people based on that world-view of his.

What I'm saying is basically that if I wanted to create a party whose main goal was openly to dismiss free speech and abolish democracy, and I wanted to run a campaign based on that premise, I shouldn't be disallowed to do so as long as I honor the democratic process.

Those gipsies who have a properly paid job mostly work as musicians or gastronomy. Their music is even considered as a hungaricum, their food I find a bit salty, but otherwise delicious. And those people I met was not your stereotypical ""playing the ghetto though guy"" - instead decent human beings, mostly being nice to you.

Now the racist sounding part: sadly the minority try to work decent. The others just cry and complain that they are poor, the society does not want to accept them and that's why they need to steal or rob other people so they don't starve to death. 

I know a story about an old gipsy man who was working as a carrier at my father-in-law's town. He worked everyday from dusk till dawn and used horse drawn carriages. Now he wasn't very rich, but decided to earn enough to build himself a house and have his kids go to university.

The funny part: that he was hated. No, not by the hungarians. The locals knew he is a fellow lad, and he was respected by them. The other gipsies hated him. They envied that he has everything he needs, and he does work everyday, as the image of ""doing work as a gipsy leads to a decent living"" ruins their ""gipsies are not respected enough, so people will not allow them to work"" opinion.

Not sure how saying that the same thing is happening to response to that comment is stupid or wrong. Parent comment is not talking about various events, when it was first held etc that you're talking about

&gt;held for more than a decade without any incident

Not true. There have been incidents often in the past few years., nothing massive but your comment is misleading and false http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagreb_Pride (english wiki is missing some years)

&gt;the attendance to the gay pride parade was 15,000.

According to the wiki that was only case in 2013, 2014 had around 2000 participants and all previous years never had more than 4k.

&gt;meanwhile, belgrade has not held a gay pride parade without blood.

Nobody is denying that?! And it was not something that is mentioned in the parent comment.

What measures was he contemplating anyhow? Seems Germany are happy to work on the matter (or placate the voters believing there is any significant problem) within the framework of existing EU law.

&gt; if the bent of governance becomes unnaceptable then the single market ceases to weigh on the positive side of the balance sheet, viz our relations with the EU. that does not change the fact ...

yes, yes it does change the facts. the issue is not an abstract ideal of having some kind of a single market, I'm only discussing the actual, existing single market with actual existing states, and its rules. 

Obviously it cannot be setup in a way that says majority rules but the UK has a veto lest a majority forms at any point that pushes through laws unfavorable to it. Either the UK is interested in participating in a single market with the rest of the EU, in which case it will be laws that the supermajority of the EU members wants that will apply to the UK, shitty compromises and all, or it deems the lawmaking course of the rest of the continent fundamentally incompatible with how it wants to run things, and so having a single market is in practice impossible.

Renegotiating its status can't really help if latter is the case. I presumed it simply wants optouts from even more competencies, though I could hardly see which. 

If its just particular laws it wants to review and not as its advertised its relationship with the EU ie constitutional/treaty matters, well great, then this really is just a window-dressing exercise. I don't see why certain Directives, whichever these may be, couldn't be put on the legislative agenda. Then its a matter for the UK to find support in the Council, Commission and Parliament, working under community method and QMV for the most part, for its desires to be taken into further account. 

Nor was this ever difficult for the UK to seek, to deserve a name of ""renegotiation"". Prob it had more of a problem actually convincing its partners and the parliament (not the comission for the last decade at least prob, that one was incredibly weak) of its positions. Ofc difficult to see how majorities could have substantially changed on matters recently decided upon, like financial regulation.

&gt;* Military could intervene in Catalonia, says general 
&gt;* Speech says charter seen as threat to national unity

&gt;A Spanish army general was under house arrest yesterday and awaiting dismissal after saying that the military might step in to halt plans for greater autonomy for the wealthy eastern region of Catalonia.

&gt;Lieutenant General José Mena, the head of Spain's 50,000-strong ground forces, told officers under his command that the country's constitution gave them the right to act if the *""unity of Spain""* was in danger. His comments, made in a public speech, copies of which were distributed to journalists, saw him called in by the defence minister, José Bono, and placed under house arrest until he can be formally dismissed at a cabinet meeting on Friday.

false,rewboss,advanced,advanced,"How long have you been studying German?

Basically, you've encountered at least two fundamental aspects of German grammar: genders and cases.

English doesn't have grammatical genders (it uses natural gender: women are feminine, men are masculine, things are neuter), but German does: and grammatical gender has very little to do with reality. Even non-living things can be masculine, feminine or neuter -- and ""Tag"" (""day"") is no exception: it is masculine, and not neuter. This is indicated by the word for ""the"" and by the endings on the adjectives; you wrote ""das"", but that's for neuter nouns.

German also has a case system, although it's beginning to show signs of dying out (give it another two or three centuries at most). English has almost no cases system at all, but we are still careful to say ""I see him"" and not ""Me see he"". The case tells you what part the word plays in the sentence: ""Me see he"" doesn't work, because ""me"" is an objective pronoun, but it's in the place where you would expect a subject... so you need ""I"", not ""me"". Similarly, ""he"" is subjective, but you need an object, so ""him"" is the correct form.

German extends this principle, so you can also see case in the word for ""the"" and in adjectival endings. German has four cases: nominative, accusative, genitive and dative (this is the order used by most languages with case systems, but Germans usually list them in order nominative, genitive, dative and accusative).

So, the word for ""the"" (or ""a"", if you're using the indefinite article) and the adjectival endings tell you what gender the word is, and what case it's being used in.

If we take the phrase for ""the whole day"", which in German is masculine, it looks like this:

* Nominative: der ganze Tag
* Accusative: den ganzen Tag
* Genitive: des ganzen Tages
* Dative: dem ganzen Tag

So now you can see that the correction you received uses the accusative case: ""den ganzen kalten, kalten, nassen Tag lang"". So why, and why the mysterious ""lang""?

This is where translation becomes an art. When you say ""all that day"", in this context you're talking about a period of time that begins at daybreak and ends at sunset; and you are saying that something was happening for that entire period. What you really mean to say is ""during the whole of the cold, cold, wet day"".

To translate that correctly into German, and to get the sense of time passing, you need to use the postposition ""lang"". (A postposition is like a preposition, except it comes after the thing it is referring to.) And you need to know that ""lang"" takes the accusative case.

So you need the format *period of time in the accusative case + ""lang""*. And that gives you: ""den ganzen kalten, kalten, nassen Tag lang"".

If you keep practicing, you'll eventually get the hang of it. But what you seem to have to have done here is simply to translate each word from English to German and then put them together in the hope that it makes sense. But translation never works like that. There's no alternative: you have to learn the grammar.",0,1411909315,null,0,false,0,ckunl9o,t3_2hoy61,t1_ckunl9o,t3_2hoy61,null,1426785390,7,false,German,t5_2qq51,7

Hegel lässt sich auf viele Weisen auslegen. Nur weil er sich selbst missverstanden hat und im Alter zum Rechten wurde, muss man keinen Bogen um ihn machen. Im Gegenteil: Der ganze Anerkennungs-Diskurs (Emanzipation, Gleichberechtigung, Identität/Differenz) lässt sich auf die Herr-Knecht-Dialektik zurückführen; die postmoderne Dekonstruktion des Subjekts hat in den Beziehungen des Geistes zu sich selbst ihren Vorläufer; die Übersetzung christlichen Denkens in philosophische Strukturen wirkt als atheistische Offenbarung sehr erhellend - um Hegel kommt man nicht herum, finde ich.

Even degree programs that claim to be taught in English have significant amounts of reading in German.  German is also often the de facto language for group work in class.  Even in the US, you have to spend at least two yours of your bachelor's ""in house.""  A European bachelor's is only three years.  There is one student in my department right now who switched universities within Germany, same major and everything, and with the exception of one or two core courses, he was still required to re-take even basic courses.

2) A list of international universities that accept US federal aid is here: https://studentaid.ed.gov/prepare-for-college/choosing-schools/types/international#international-schools  With two exceptions (both private universities), no German public university will accept US financial aid.

There are no teaching assistantships or research assistantships at the master's level here; just work-study sorts of jobs.  TAships and RAships are exclusively for PhD students.  Master's degrees are lumped in with undergrad here, but DAAD and Fulbright at least offer some money to people who have finished their bachelor's.  Outside the university, if you have a residence permit for your studies, aside from university jobs, you can only work 90 full days or 180 half days a year and Germany's minimum wage doesn't work like it does in the US (i.e., in most fields, there isn't one).

I don't mean this in a mean way, but I don't know why you are so focused on going to a country where you don't speak the language and don't qualify for any financial aid.  You also posted that you were in the 11th grade.  I have yet to meet an individual who hasn't changed their mind about their major at least once or twice, and that is something much easier to deal with in the US than in Germany.

Why don't you start to learn German as an undergrad, do a study abroad program there, and see if you really like it there before uprooting your entire life to go someplace where you are a complete outsider?  Adjusting to college life is hard enough without dealing with culture shock and the fact that you don't speak the same language as everyone around you.  I had a whole lot of culture shock here in my first year and I had already finished a degree in German.  

If you really, really, really want to get out of the US ASAP, consider Canada or the UK.  There, things will be different enough and you will still be able to speak the language and use US financial aid almost everywhere.

Che se stiamo parlando di verità processuale (la stessa che ha, a volte, condannato Travaglio), quello che riteniamo o pensiamo ha un valore molto limitato. Soprattutto se vuoi ergerti a difensore della realtà, i fatti e la verità. Non puoi farlo negando la verità processuale, mi dispiace, soprattutto se lo fai in nome di un tuo sentire che credi comune a tutti quelli ""con un cervello"".

Si, se parliamo di verità processuale si, ma non era quello di cui parlavo. Magari mi sono spiegato male. 

Ci sono determinate accuse che, quando rivolte a persone che ricoprono cariche pubbliche, rendono irrilevante la presunzione d'innocenza. 

La logica è semplice, per qualsiasi ordinamento moderno è preferibile un delinquente a piede libero che un innocente in galera. E su questo credo che siamo tutti d'accordo.

Ma quando si parla di cariche pubbliche, **nel dubbio** (dove per dubbio intendiamo che una corte non si sia ancora pronunciata), meglio un eventuale delinquente dimesso che a prendere decisioni per la collettiviltà.

Questo è il concetto che Travaglio cerca di far passare in ogni dove e come, magari eccedendo con i toni, venendo però bollato come forcaiolo.

Ed è lo stesso concetto che esprime nel paragrafo quotato qualche post fa sull'articolo 27. Dato che il 99,9% dei cittadini non può leggere le carte di ogni singolo processo, ed è facile per tutti dire ""eh ma io sono innocente, aspettiamo il primo grado/secondo grado/cassazione.
Per chi abbia la possibilità di documentarsi (o lo faccia di mestiere), è invece possibile esprimere un giudizio.

Per capirci: Hai mai letto [questo](https://infotomb.com/ezg1g.pdf)? Seriamente, ci vuole un genio per capire cosa combinassero? Solo che dato che quel file lo avranno letto in 3 (uno dei quali è Travaglio) Berlusconi poteva tranquillamente andare in giro a dire ""gomblotto gomblotto i giudici fanno politica"".

Lo stesso discorso si può applicare a qualsiasi indagine in cui siano coinvolte cariche pubbliche. As simple as that.

Comunque per approfondire il tema ho creato un [CMV](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2hp0fd/cmv_politicians_shouldnt_resign_when_theyre/) correlato a quello di cui stiamo parlando. Vediamo cosa ne pensano gli anglosassoni, io sono sempre aperto ad ammettere di avere torto.

This constant transfer of wealth to the core has never been dealt with in Europe in a structural way, and no-one wants to face up to the reality that the core HAS to return money to the periphery in some shape or form or they're looking at really difficult political and economic situations in the future.

The US does this by way of the federal government so it kind of works. Depressed states (sadly, mostly in the south) receive more federal dollars than they pay in federal taxes. If the EU does not come to some solution on this problem, we're probably going to see more and more extreme politics on the periphery as the standard of living drops, and possibly a political situation that is really hard to deal with on a EU level due to extreme differences in ideology

Btw, Switzerland and Norway have zero intention and incentive to join the EU, I don't see how you'd imagine they would. Norway is sorted fiscally for decades due to a well managed economy and a better understanding of the joys of monetary independence. Switzerland takes pride in its neutrality and has a very good relationship with the EU that they really don't need to change.

On your point about the EU splitting and the northern states forming a union themselves, I think that's a question they have to ask themselves.

No it's not; it's part of a prepositional phrase, the preposition being ""lang"" (although you can leave out ""lang"", but it's still understood). ""Lang"" takes the accusative case.

Please cite me a few relevant cases then. Because history is riffle with employer abuse but i saw very few employee-led abuse cases.

Well, once again history seems to prove you wrong since the US is full of monopolies above taxes; which seems to benefit them all.

And they certainly do, seeing how many states tried to ban tesla from selling cars in their area

&gt; and vice versa

Tesla isn't big enough (or corrupt enough) to bribe enough senators to do so.

&gt; The point is that this kind of lobbying for benefits and regulation should be greatly restricted down to just pollution and safely laws.

No, the point is if a company offer money to politicians the exec that order so should end up in jail.

That's just made up bullshit. ""they don't want to hire full time workers because then they would have to pay them"".

You have a *de facto* minimal wage thanks to gov backed unions; which don't exist either in the US. The union being codified in laws means it's de facto illegal.

&gt; which is very effective

Only as long as there are unions. If those aren't heavily protected, you end up like in the US.

&gt; but in countries like the US, Mediterranean Europe etc, it's usually government that's fucking everything up.

Europeans should be aware that the Obama Administration got elected by hiding this neoliberal agenda and ALMOST NO AMERICANS KNOW ABOUT THAT NEOLIBERAL AGENDA OR THE THREE PENDING US FTAs AT ALL! (especially TTIP and the ultra-secret  TISA, a very few, a bit more, know about TPP) 

In fact, very few Americans even know the slightest bit about neoliberalism. We were sold the bill of goods that Obama was a ""liberal"" which in the US mean left of center, and Americans are still really in a state of shock that he consistently signals left and turns right, and most of us are just trying to figure it out. Please understand that we Americans are intentionally kept COMPLETELY IGNORANT of trade policy's very existence, by a media that fails to report on anything related to FTAs, at all.

With a media that blots out all news of FTAs, many Americans tend to disbelieve the occasional plea for attention to this issue or information presented to us on its significance. 

So, out of the 350 million of us, perhaps a few thousand, at best, know the fact that the FTAs hijack huge, important policy areas, or that they are working feverishly to superimpose an extreme ideology which nobody would agree with, over all of our laws, using trade policy, for good. 

Anybody who attempts to explain it is attacked by the right. Obama's main allies on trade are on the right, but many leading Dems are also covert neolibs. Corporate money has been controlling US politicians more and more each year. We desperately need campaign finance reform. No doubt, thats why they are trying to use FTAs to render any future electoral reform completely ineffectual to legislate by means of their ""regulatory capture"" - #1 means of doing that is these invisibly created ""rights"" - created by means of ISDS. To use a European analogy, CETA is a bit like the Spanish Civil War and Canada is Guernica. ISDS and similar, and perhaps also a provisional application subterfuge, which lets them leak a sanitized version and then approve a much more aggressive version in secret, might well be testing ground for a corporatism which should be recognized as a threat to the civilized world. The same problem exists with TTIP and the secret TISA (which according to experts, is quite likely to be where the all important services stuff really is, not TTIP!)

I could give countless examples of other really shameless deceptions to hide the FTAs and their implications. So, don't blame us- meaning, we, the American people (I'm American)  We're being lied to by our *politico-industrial complex* too. Its clearly a scheme by a tiny but very powerful group to quash the ability of our democracies to govern, both here and in the EU. Its being crammed through without public knowledge of its implications, even as - here in the US a disinformation campaign is raging to hide the fact that they quash our ability to set healthcare policy.

And as you will notice, these FTAs try to use ""investor-state dispute settlement"" (or ""ISDS""),  ""indirect expropriation"", ""standstill"", ""ratchet"", ""rollback"" and sneaky trojan horse clauses to make democracy impotent to change anything that adversely impacts a corporate investor's profits, which basically makes it so governments cannot do their jobs.

I think the biggest farce this week is that the police will be on ""strike"" the upcoming one. They won't be issuing fines for minor infractions like speeding, using a cellphone behind the wheel etc.
They also had a protest rally, but to be honest I did not notice.
There was a lot of whining about budget cuts and some talk about the F16's we sent to waste money in Iraq and Syria.  
Next week promises to be more interesting, a trial will start against Sharia4Belgium, and the muslims will hold their day sacrifice day on saturday. maybe we can combine both and cut the throats of those 40 POS.

I didn't know degenerate behavior resulting from a [hormone imbalance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_hormones_and_sexual_orientation) in utero was considered 'basic human rights'.

If you claim that sexual orientation is merely a social construct then I invite you to read the Wikipedia article linked above.

&gt;There is evidence of a correlation between sexual orientation and traits that are determined in utero. Williams et al. (2000) found that finger length ratio, a characteristic controlled by prenatal hormones, is different in lesbians than in straight women. However, they found no difference between gay and straight men. Another study by McFadden in 1998 found that auditory systems in the brain, another physical trait influenced by prenatal hormones is different in those of differing orientations; likewise the suprachiasmatic nucleus was found by Swaab and Hofman to be larger in homosexual men than in heterosexual men. The suprachiasmatic nucleus is also known to be larger in men than in women. An analysis of the hypothalamus by Swaab and Hofmann (1990;2007) found that the volume of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in homosexual men was 1.7 times larger than a reference group of male subjects, and contained 2.1 times as many cells. During development, the volume of the SCN and the cell counts reach peak value at approximately 13 to 16 months after birth; at this age, the SCN contains the same number of cells as was found in adult male homosexuals, yet in a reference group of heterosexual males the cell numbers begin to decline to the adult value of 35% of the peak value. These results have yet to be replicated, however; there also has yet to be a meaningful interpretation of these results provided in the context of human sexual orientation. Gay men have also been shown to have higher levels of circulating androgens and larger penises, on average, than hetero men.

We had high levels of unemployment before the EU, so unless you want to blame the EU for the whole crisis, this is a weak argument.

The strikes against austerity are justified; The bad thing is that there are no supranational lobby's or organisations (union-like) (that i know of at least) who can negotiate with the European commision on an equal level. Besides, the majority (centrum-right coalition) thought and thinks that a temporary suffering like this can solve the debtcrisis and restore confidence to companies. So i guess a lack of represantation and the current majority (for which member states voted, might i add) in parliament (and in the commision) are your problem. That's not a fundamental EU-problem, but it needs a fixing

To blame the whole EU for not fixing the crisis is bullshit. Yes, they didn't  succeed with the troika, but apparently a majority in the EU found it not bad enough, because they didn't vote for the left on a massive scale (they didn't vote for the eu-sceptics on a massive scale either). Things like consumer protection and the benefits of the Single Market are often vastly overlooked in sight of their failure. So in light of these things i don't see it legit in wanting to see the EU painted as a bad guy; they were just not good enough to solve a very complex problem.

And the argument that they rather fight over what they have to pay to go on a trip, is also not very good. I agree they live MP's live in luxury and find horrendous in times of crisis, but that's maybe 0,01% of their budget they're spending on their personal (unnecessary) costs.

false,Andreahb,lurker,,"&gt; Si, se parliamo di verità processuale si, ma non era quello di cui parlavo

E allora di che verità parliamo, bisogna che ti metti d'accordo con te stesso. Al netto di divagazioni mirabolanti, uno dei tuoi punti più deboli rimane la tua convinzione che ci siano dei fatti evidenti, delle realtà conclamate, delle cose che sono così perché sono così (è un problema collegato secondo me all'ossessione per ""le fonti"", in quanto tali, a prescindere da tutto. Fonti che se poi ti danno torto derubrichi come inaffidabili. Poi certo che giudichi Facci un giornalista poco affidabile perché ha dei casini aperti con Wikipedia. Perché l'autorevolezza poi la misuri quasi a battute che uno ha su un articolo di una wiki. Non si va molto lontani così).

Se si vuole partire da un punto, su un procedimento concluso, si parte dalla verità processuale, poi da lì ognuno ha i suoi punti di vista, nessuno vero in quanto tale. Io ho un mio parere su quello che succedeva nelle feste di Silvione nostro, ma è dibattibile, e non sarà mai aderente al 100% con quello che è veramente successo.

Mi perplime poi vedere la tua fede cieca in travaglio: ""uno dei tre che le avrà lette"", ma chi te lo dice? Ma sai quanti giornalisti che non conosciamo per nome si fanno un culo così scandagliando documenti ben più pesanti? Peraltro uno dei più grandi scandagliatori di documenti processuali e di report economici è Bechis, un giornalista di destra. Che immagino giudicherai lo stesso inaffidabile e pessimo, ma invece per me vale, anche lui, 20 volte Travaglio.

Sul piano più generale (stiamo di nuovo divagando, si era partito dal fatto che Travaglio spesso piega la realtà per dare forza ai suoi editoriali - lo fa -, siamo finiti a parlare delle cariche pubbliche, ma vabè):

No, non credo che un eletto solo perché indagato, in Italia, debba dimettersi. In Italia la giustizia è un potere che troppo spesso travalica e invade la politica in modo vergognoso, finché le cose stanno così eviterei di dargli altri poteri.

Ritengo invece che sono i partiti a dover avere una cultura di legalità più alta, e avere organi interni che permettano, sotto la minaccia di una perdita di credibilità degli elettori, di allontanare i soggetti che finiscono sotto il radar della magistratura. In modo da mantenere una credibilità come strumento di rappresentanza politica.

Per questo nel mio mondo ideale sogno partiti più forti, e invece mi ritrovo i partiti liquidi da un parte, quelli padronali dall'altra, e grillo dall'altra ancora.

false,Ferimoa,DENK,Denmark,"&gt; Please cite me a few relevant cases then. Because history is riffle with employer abuse but i saw very few employee-led abuse cases.

Greece and Italy are clear present day examples, as are public sector workers everywhere - they create a union, which sponsors a left wing party, which promises to restrict the rights of companies to fire people, to force them to pay pensions, health care, and whatever else the government can't be arsed to do itself, lowers the retirement age etc etc. Then they wonder why there's a colossal hole in the budget that they can't fill because they've promised decades of future growth to greedy workers who got politicians in power who will spend their children's future on themselves. In the US, the car makers went belly up in part because when times were good the unions forced them into making obscene pension commitments that they're still paying out. Cops and firefighters are even worse, as any politician who dares to vote against pay rises is hounded as 'not supporting our heroes'. If you seriously think that corporations are all greedy bloodsuckers and workers are poor suffering oppressed saints just trying to live on an honest wage, you're deluding yourself. A dysfunctional system is one in which powerful interests, including unions, have so much power and influence that they can feather their own nests to the detriment of everyone else.

&gt; No, the point is if a company offer money to politicians the exec that order so should end up in jail.

It's not bribery, it's lobbying. 'My company provides X jobs in your state, this new company in another state threatens us, please regulate to give us an advantage, and we'll contribute to your campaign and remind our workers to vote for you'. Nothing illegal in that. And that's the problem - the government shouldn't be able to regulate like that. There should be no one to lobby to.

&gt; That's just made up bullshit. ""they don't want to hire full time workers because then they would have to pay them"". You mean they don't because they realized they wouldn't have to offer them a normal living and could just pocket it instead and buy themselves another yatch with all the store's stolen wages.

If you have a business, then every investment you make must be weighed against it's return, obviously. If you hire a person, then it's because you would make more money with that person's labour than without. Obviously, the less you have to pay them, the better. The lower the wages, the more people you can hire. Companies don't exist to provide work for the unemployed, they exist for profit. But the people see these businesses have money, so they greedily vote politicians in who can force the companies to give them a bigger share of the income, and pensions, healthcare and other benefits. If they deserved them, then the company would gladly give them so they didn't switch to someone that did provide them; but they don't deserve them, so instead you wind up with a system where a lucky few have cushy well paid jobs with benefits while all the young people work as temps because their parents are sucking up all the money in form of benefits that would have been used to hire those kids. Then the economy tanks and they can't understand it, even though the money they personally get out of the system is far more than the taxes they pay in. If you want a chance to earn your fair share, then you need a system that quickly and effectively matches supply and demand. Government can't do that. Unions can be good, as long as they aren't too powerful, and there is competition among them. 

About abuse: if you're hired at a certain wage, you have a right to that wage. You have the right not to be assaulted, you have the right to quit, and the law probably stipulates a certain standard of working conditions with regards to safety etc.  Other than that, there needs to be people to prevent monopolies forming, and preventing harmful effects to the community like pollution. As long as the employer is living up to that, you're not being abused. If you work for a company where the CEO makes 400 times what you do and treats their employees like shit, then in a functional system that company is going to lose all their good employees to another company that pays more, and that CEO will make less money. 

&gt; Well, once again history seems to prove you wrong since the US is full of monopolies above taxes; which seems to benefit them all.

For every business there's another business who's interests don't align. If one lot get preferential treatment, another lot get stiffed. If you help car makers, train and bus businesses lose. Help oil, and you lose the solar panel makers. Etc etc. They're not conspiring against workers, they're conspiring against each other.

false,lingxs,altro,,"Ciao! Io studio nel campo della linguistica e ti dirò che dipende dai giudizi sociolinguistici che vigono nel periodo attuale. Qualsiasi communità linguistica ha, all'interno della sua cultura, un sistema per classificare quali parole, suoni, forme sintattiche, ecc. siano considerate prestigiosi e quali non lo siano. Questo sistema è presente in ognuno dei locutori e orienta la loro percezione e le ""attitudini linguistiche"" che avranno all'udire una forma o un'altra: se tu senti qualche tratto caratteristico di un dialetto del Sud, magari ti viene in mente l'idea ""folcloristico, piacevole e divertente"" perché dove vivi questo dialetto è sempre stato associato a situazioni che ne facevano risaltare questo carattere. Ad esempio, può darsi che per ragioni storiche ed economiche, nella maggior parte dei film importanti per la tua cultura, i personaggi simpatici hanno sempre avuto un accento meridionale. 

Potrebbe anche essere dovuto al fatto che dove tu vivi, i dialetti sono repressi e lo sai benissimo, il che fa che tu li percepisci come meno degni di dialetti meridionali, sui quali appunto non hai giudizi prescrittivi ereditati dalla tua cultura. 

Ti dò un esempio tratto da un'altra situazione linguistica così che magari ti risulti più chiaro, perché a volte, l'essere inclusi in un contesto X impedisce di guardarlo obiettivamente. Io vivo in Québec (Canada), dove si parla un francese molto diverso da quello di Parigi. Se qualcuno viene qui e parla con l'accento parigino, risulta automaticamente ""snob"" e ""educato"", mentre se uno viene qui con l'accento da Marsiglia viene percepito come ""simpatico"" e ""folcloristico"". Molto di ciò ha a che fare con l'influenza culturale di Parigi: noi del Québec abbiamo costruito uno stereotipo del Parigino che abbiamo poi associato al suo modo di parlare.

Adesso, può darsi benissimo che uno di Parigi consideri i dialetti del Sud come poco prestigiosi (direi che è proprio il caso). Le ""attitudini linguistiche"" non dipendono da una verità obiettiva, bensì da come la tua cultura costruisce le sue percezioni delle altre.

Mi scuso per gli eventuali errori: l'italiano non è la mia madrelingua. Spero di esser stato abbastanza chiaro!

Edit: Aggiungerei che se ho capito bene, l'italiano standard moderno viene soprattutto dal toscano, quindi da un dialetto del nord. È molto probabile che nel Nord industriale, economicamente più potente del Sud, dove forse la scuola pubblica si è organizzata più velocemente, i dialetti siano stati stigmatizzati da molto più tempo che al Sud.

And then we have to still bail a lot of the EU out, to stem the cost of that, again more cuts have been made (together with the seemingly weird one of not buying more repair parts, whihc is the reason that basically non of our helicopters are actually able to fly right now lol).

How I view it is, germany is also paying to assure the security of the EU/West, it is helping against russia, but not through military spending, but through trying to create more stability in the region itself, the easiest way to fall to an enemy is when your own region is in chaos...

As for Italy you are quietly forgetting berlusconi's own mafia government too.

So really, blamming workers when that kind of money is stolen as high level, is just adding insult to injury.

Average wage there was 500€ equivalent; and for his cronies and capos like 10K.)

&gt; It's not bribery, it's lobbying

Giving money to politicians to obtain political favors is bribery by definition. Just to let you know : If you try that one in Europe, *i very much hope you will end up in jail, for several years*.

&gt; Nothing illegal in that.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery

&gt; The lower the wages, the more people you can hire. 

That's definitely a plain old lie. Hiring is not defined by wages but by productivity need. Since a manager does not do the job himself, he needs to hire somebody do execute said contract or manufacture said product he will sell. More product or service to sell ? Since forcing unpaid additionnal hours on employees can land the execs in jail in the EU, You need more employees.

&gt; Obviously, the less you have to pay them, the better

In fact, not. Because if nobody get paid, the system crash, and you end up a hobo too when nobody cares about your green papers anymore and you have no skills in life. That's what we are risking, systemwide crash where a 100$ bill isn't even worth the paper it's printed on. Then you'll look like pretty stupid along with all those who ""forgot"" too to paid their employees.

Maybe this will bring you back a few memories : http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/10/04/world/04germany_600.jpg

Wage is determined by 2 factors : What employeers force down on you, and what the government force them to pay. If there is no minimum and law that say that ""unpaid internship"" are illegal; you get the US job market.

You might want to laugh, but if the mafia there is removed, in a couple years people will flee *from the US* and *to Mexico*.

&gt; If you work for a company where the CEO makes 400 times what you do and treats their employees like shit, then in a functional system that company is going to lose all their good employees to another company that pays more, and that CEO will make less money.

Or, really, in the US, monopoly means there are like 10 companies who all colluded to destroy wages and prevent a real minimal wage or even pegging on inflation.

&gt; For every business there's another business who's interests don't align. 

Except there is one common factor in all the US businesses under the sun or nigh : Make the maximum money by squeezing both the customers and employees out of all their money.

&gt;  If you help car makers, train and bus businesses lose

However they say that doing so prematurely would remove a source of revenue that could hinder their ability to invest in upgrading their networks.


Theeeere we go. ""my cash cow ! my cash cow ! how will i make billons if i can't scam the customer of 500€ of roaming fees for every 10 video read 10km behind the border ?"".

As usual, plain old greed.

Honestly, do you pay a fee if you plug your laptop in such country and such country on a power plug ? Then why do we pay hundreds of euros more for cell data networks that exist everywhere anyway ? That scam needs to end. And no operators certainly won't disappear because there is a need for a network in every EU country anyway.

&gt; the latest text under discussion foresees that users would pay domestic rates for using their mobile phone abroad only for a limited amount of consumption, the so-called 'fair use'. 

""we allow your electric appliances to run for exactly 5h of appliance time in this country for this month. Oh you used 2h charging your laptop and 3 your cell phone ? We therefore cut you power for the month.""

Uh, *i'm sorry ?*

&gt; The daily fair use limits for mobile phones would be calculated on the basis of ""average annual domestic consumption in the EU"".

""Look, they never use more than 5h of electric appliances ! So our 5h cut is fair. See, we told you."" Ahhh good old comcast logic.

&gt; Italy sees the ""fair use"" mechanism as a way to avoid people abusing the system

""We need to pass a law preventing people from using too many power or water at the same time ! Imagine, if they showered more than 10 minutes every day or used all both a computer and a fridge and a vacuum cleaner at the same time the entire system would collapse. We need to make mandatory limitators force cutting them water at exactly 11 minutes of water use or disconnecting them power if they use 2 electric appliance at the same time to prevent that. Oh ok we're feeling generous, it's only one euro per additionnal liter of water you get for the rest of the month""

probabilmente lavoreranno di più, quale sarebbe il problema? conosco parecchi tassisti che sarebbero più che contenti di lavorare di più.

Se ti riferisci a che mancherebbe un equilibrio tra ore lavorate e i soldi guadagnati, se anche fosse vero i tassisti non sono certo le peggiori vittime. Piuttosto hanno tutte le capacita per generare valore aggiunto al servizio e migliorare i profitti e magari fare meno corse.

Pagherei volentieri per un taxi con un wifi dentro per esempio o anche solo una porta usb per ricaricare il cellulare. Sarebbe creare valore aggiunto, migliorare il servizio e far pagare di piu. Pero ovviamente non ci sforziamo troppo perche abbiamo delle licenze e questo ci obbliga a sbraitare come imbecilli quando qualcuno ha una idea più intelligente.

&gt; Il fatto è che la tariffa aumenterà così da farci perdere il cliente nel processo.

non capisco questo punto. 
Ricordati che la percezione del valore di un bene o servizio e' slegata dal suo prezzo reale. Puoi far pagare una corsa il 20% in piu pero offrire una esperienza migliore e non sara' un prezzo ""caro"" per l'utente finale.
Con uber/my taxi il prezzo non e' esageratamente piu basso di un taxi, il punto e' che puoi chiamarne uno dal telefono, puoi lasciare review e feedback e gia solo questo crea valore aggiunto (uber &gt; taxi tradizionale). 

Se i tassisti dessero un servizio migliore potrebbero pure alzare i prezzi e i profitti, pero come sempre hanno vissuto comodi in un simpaticissimo regime di monopolio, non si sono mai sforzati un minimo per migliorare le cose. 

Adesso che qualcuno ha trovato il modo per riscrivere le regole (e qui forse hanno tutto il motivo di imbestialirsi i tassisti, per il semplice fatto che il governo in primo luogo non dovrebbe aver creato un monopolio e lasciato agire player esterni senza nessun controllo, invalidando il sistema delle licenze) tutti a piangere perche non sanno cosa e' un regime di concorrenza e come migliorare la offerta.

&gt; Poi approfondisci il discorso del consumo energetico e la produttività, per favore. Stai valutando dei &gt;servizi in base alla produttività? O che con l'energia si guadagna di più negli anni e non perché risorse &gt;limitate = prezzo maggiore? Non ho ben capito.

""Non ho ben capito"" il tuo commento.

Il discorso della produttivita parte dal tuo concetto che non 'e possibile creare plusvalore perche il capitalismo e' un meccanismo a somma zero, nel quale il guadagno di qualcuno e' la perdita di un altro. Se cosi fosse forse non saremmo neanche qua su reddit a parlarne.

Quel grafico non significa che la produttività aumenta perche aumenta il costo dell'energia... e' un esempio che smonta la teoria di come non sia possibile in un sistema capitalistico una crescita continua. Se si produce di più (e l'indicatore qua non può che essere il gdp ma se vuoi lo cambiamo con i kg di cavoli prodotti in un anno, fa lo stesso) secondo il concetto per il quale non e' possibile crescere perche le risorse sono finite, il mondo sarebbe finito da un pezzo. Ma non e' cosi. La ricchezza in una societa post industriale (chiamala produttivita se vuoi, in numeri assoluti sarebbe lo stesso) non dipende dai costi di produzione o dall'investimento energetico.

 [**Operation Dragoon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation%20Dragoon): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Operation Dragoon__ was the [Allied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) invasion of southern France on 15 August 1944, during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II). The invasion was initiated via a parachute drop by the [1st Airborne Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Airborne_Task_Force), followed by an amphibious assault by elements of the [U.S. Seventh Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Europe), followed a day later by a force made up primarily of the [French First Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Army_(France\)).  The landing caused the German [Army Group G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Group_G) to abandon southern France and to retreat under constant Allied attacks to the [Vosges Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vosges_Mountains). Despite being a large and complex military operation with a well-executed amphibious and airborne component, Operation Dragoon is not well known; it came in the later stages of the war and was overshadowed by the earlier and larger [Operation Overlord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord) that invaded Normandy.

My background is in town planning - educated in the UK, currently working in the US, and am familiar with Canada's trade policies because of reasons that I'd rather not go into in public.

Now bear in mind that my areas of expertise are technical standards and non-tariff trade barriers **in the automotive and construction industries**. I'm not in much of a position to comment on the rest of CETA except for from the classic Reddit armchair perspective of ""I don't trust the investor dispute mechanism"" that is pretty representative of most progressive opposition to the text so far, and fair enough.

So with that being said, let me lay out some background first:

For decades now, Canada and the US have been largely cut off from international trade markets due to a variety of reasons. In my estimation, one of the single largest reasons would be incompatible technical and labelling standards for products. A few months ago, [I wrote a post here on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1u4zet/friends_car_just_did_this/ceepx9f) that explains the current situation with car technical standards in some depth. I'd recommend reading this first as I'm quite ill right now and severely lacking in energy to try and summarise it at the moment.

Long story short, because of US protectionism surrounding Detroit, Ottawa protectionism surrounding Ontario manufacturers, and NAFTA, Canada has been locked out of the international auto market and stuck firmly into America's orbit *exclusively*. It doesn't necessarily have to be this way - Mexico is an example - but for a variety of somewhat complicated reasons, it is. More importantly, it limits consumer choice and inflates prices for Canadian consumers. 

Now having said that, the entirety of the automotive section lists a few facts drawn from CETA followed by a bunch of misinformed analysis. It's the classic Daily Mail trick of ""start an article with a sentence that's true, then turn the rest into a creative writing assignment of *mights, coulds, and maybes*"". **However**, the really egregious material comes in the second half of page 78 of their report. It states:

&gt; ""The most important feature of this agreement is that Canada accepts 17 regulatory standards dealing with vehicle lighting systems, noise standards and bumpers currently listed in a schedule developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE, specified in their schedule WP.2970).""

This is correct, although it's worth noting that this is a situation unique to Canada. Unlike the US, where **no** diversions from FMVSS standards are allowed, Canada actually allows UNECE parts for about 50% of the current conflicting rules as allowable alternatives. This just tidies up the rest of the parts so that, *it would appear*, Canada will now fully allow UNECE parts. I should also note that I'm not entirely sure of the timeline for adoption here - it's been noted several times that Canada intends to wait to see what the results of the EU-US talks are before they take any substantial steps in harmonising the regulations, so speaking about this as if it's a done deal is premature.

&gt; Nominally this is portrayed as a global regulatory benchmark but it
reflects European practices. This is the first time a NAFTA member, or any major global auto-producing jurisdiction outside of Europe, has agreed to accept the European regulations as their own, and it sets a significant precedent regarding regulatory harmonization in other areas. 

Bullshit. Complete and utter bullshit. Like, this actually exceeds the Daily Mail in levels of intentional misdirection and weasel words. ""This is the first time a NAFTA member, or any major global auto-producing jurisdiction outside of Europe, has agreed to accept the European regulations as their own"". Nope. These are not European regulations. They're United Nations regs originally intended for Europe that were then adopted internationally. ""Most countries, even if not formally participating in the 1958 agreement, recognise the UN Regulations and either mirror the UN Regulations' content in their own national requirements, or permit the import, registration, and use of UN type-approved vehicles, or both. The United States and Canada are the two significant exceptions; there UN regulations are generally not recognised and UN-compliant vehicles and equipment are not authorised for import, sale, or use in the US, unless they are tested to be compliant with US car safety laws, or for limited non driving use (E.G. car show displays).""

Trying to paint UNECE as a strictly EU set of standards would be like criticising a country as being an American puppet because they're UN members, and the UN headquarters is in New York City.

Also, the first time a NAFTA country has? Nope. Mexico allows UNECE compliant cars as well as FMVSS/CMVSS cars. Plus, NAFTA has three members. They might as well write, ""This is the first time a country called Canada or the United States has..."". Obviously. That's the entire point of these negotiations.

Now I sympathise *somewhat* with fears that car manufacturing in Canada might be hit a little bit by this, but I think a fair amount is unfounded. Plenty of factories in Europe and China make FMVSS/CMVSS compliant cars for export to North America. Long gone are the days of the 1960s when shipping and labour costs made it cheaper to just set up in North America. Plus, I would somewhat doubt that the US is going to be as amenable to altering FMVSS as Canada has been, so I don't see the market for FMVSS vehicles disappearing, especially when it has created a rift in car model lineups that makes the North American auto industry (and models available) different from the international marketplace. That 'culture' isn't going to shift overnight, certainly not as a result of this agreement. Worst case scenario: Canadians start seeing a few more European models showing up in showrooms, car prices drop slightly or remain the same, and Canada's auto manufacturing output drops a little bit, although still boosted by the 50% reciprocal agreement with the EU.

There are a million more things that they've completely ignored here that are barely even touched on by CETA, which is surprisingly limited in its scope, that involve: why most countries on earth align their technical standards with EU (particularly DIN) or ISO standards instead of American ANSI, how this trade deal is actually bringing Canada in from the cold and uncoupling its complete reliance on the US economy, and a million other things, but my blood pressure is falling rapidly and I desperately need to have a lie down.

Cependant ce genre de raisonnement peut aller très loin. Je n'ai jamais vu d'atomes, donc ils n'existent pas. Je n'ai eu 4 garçons donc la probabilité d'avoir un garçon est de 100%... Je ne connais personne qui a gagné a Euromillion donc c'est pas possible de gagné.ect ect...

Le problème de l'obsolescence programmée est le même que pour la collusion. C'est tellement difficile a prouver que personne n'est jamais (presque) condamné, c'est pour ça ce qui en fait presque un mythe... Ce n'est peut être pas une généralité, mais ça existe.

But southern and wester EU nope!

During the time of reunification, the standard of living in the western and southern european countries got to a waaay higher level than the german one.

In some cases it wasn't even remotely justified too, they were getting a way higher percentage of wage increase compared to their economical growth.

At the same time, germany did not see nearly any wage increases while growing an growing, this was due to money beeing shifted into the newer parts of the BRD, the east german parts.

The second reason for the lower wage increase is that in talks between the industry and the various unions, the deals did not give any wage increase but more security for the workers. (This however only happened too because of reunification, because jobs weren't as safe anymore)

This is the reason, while in recent years, the unions had so many strikes (comparatively for german levels) etc., because after reunification was mostly handled the workers finally wanted to see some more of the money made from the economical success, however then came the EU crisis :(

We also cut a lot of our welfare programs and security nets in order to be able to pay for reunification.

We went through very similiar austerity programs and austerity measures that later then tried to get the rest of the EU to do.

You have to be very ingenous (not to say stupid) to believe that if the Catalan government is doing thing this way (and not the ""legal"" way) is because they ""want to"". If doing things the right way was possible (like it was in the United Kingdom with Scotland), you can bet anything that Mas would be doing them that way. But when the Spanish government refuses to even debate, you run out of options. 

Changing the Constitution, especially the first part, is very, very complicated and requires support from most of the political parties. PP and PSOE, but especially the likes of PP and UPyD will NEVER agree to those changes. If at least they were willing to negotiate a possible modification... but they aren't. They won't even let a discussion take place. The Basque president Ibarretxe tried to do it in 2004, and failed miserably, because Madrid shut the door on his face. There's no other way.

Public employees were paid for 13th and 14th salaries, and the monthly salaries were already above German levels. 22% of the population were on the books at working for the government, far above most countries, and was ranked least efficient in the OECD. Most Greeks lived mortgage-free and wages were high. They just kept voting in governments that would give them pay rises and not tax them, while the governments lied about the finances. Government officials stole, doctors stole from their hospitals, everyone stole. Corrupt people, corrupt government. Ie an example of workers using their democratic right to fuck their own country over. If they'd cut down their public sector and allowed the market to clear for wages, it couldn't have happened, could it?

&gt; Wage is determined by 2 factors : What employeers force down on you, and what the government force them to pay. If there is no minimum and law that say that ""unpaid internship"" are illegal; you get the US job market.

That's bullshit. Employers can only force you to accept low wages if there are lots of unemployed and few jobs. If there are lots of openings and few unemployed, or the employee has rare skills, then the employee has the power. My point is *why are there few jobs*. If Walmart unilaterally decided to double their wages, they would simply get slightly more enthusiastic employees doing exactly the same as they already do with little productivity gain, yet profits would be lower, which means less money to invest in new stores or other businesses, and fewer employed. There are only so many gold-plated limousines a billionaire can buy - most of that is spent on investments that benefit society.  

All your examples of businesses colluding to keep wages low are exactly the sort of thing government is supposed to control. Not wages, not discrimination, not holidays, just ensure competition. Smaller government focused on encouraging competition -&gt; less lobbying, subsidies, regulation, taxes, collusion -&gt; more money spent on investment -&gt; stronger economy -&gt; more jobs -&gt; higher wages. If government measures are indirectly causing low wages and high unemployment, don't blame the employers, and stop thinking that making it even more costly to hire workers will help.

&gt;Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio)

Unsurprising, given that the guy is basically bought by Defense industry. 

&gt;There are no reasons for Russia to treat NATO other than possible adversary, and this is because of NATO itself.

I'm going to have to agree an disagree. I agree that NATO does hold responsibility for the general relations between NATO and Russia - installing itself as a hegemonic *global* power that can act unilaterally, which is counter to Russia's geopolitical interests. This, as well as a whole host of other things. If relations were ever good between NATO and Russia, there would have never been a need for a ""reset"" between the US and Russia to start with... 

On the other hand, Russia shoulders a significant amount of the responsibility as well - it often refused cooperation with NATO, it often actively worked against NATO interests, and its attitude towards neighbouring states which are either NATO or EU members, or prospective NATO or EU members(Which is a problem in of itself in NATO-Russia relations) has also contributed significantly in the rivalry between the two.

- The differential exclusionary model, which accepts immigrants as temporary ""guestworkers"" but is highly restrictive with regard to other forms of immigration and to naturalisation of immigrants. Japan, China, Taiwan, and the countries of the Middle East tend to follow this approach.
- The assimilationist model, which accepts that immigrants obtain citizenship, but on the condition that they give up some or all cultural, linguistic, or social characteristics that differ from those of the majority population. Europe is the primary example of this model, where immigrants are usually required to learn the official language, and cultural traditions such as Islamic dress are often barred in public spaces

J'ai aussi été à l'UDI pendant un an, il y a pas mal de temps. C'est un parti de bourgeois, principalement des cadres sups, assez jeunes, diplômés de grandes écoles entre autre. Ils sont pro-europe à fond, assez écolos, mais avec quand même un peu plus de réalisme (en particulier économique) que chez les Verts. 

Et surtout sans ce mépris du peuple qu'on voit souvent à gauche (les gens de gauche pensent naturellement que les gens pauvres et non éduqués se trompent quand ils ne votent pas pour eux, le fait qu'ils se sentent de gauche devrait suffire, pas besoin de considération ou de mesures, ils sont de gauche, donc ils ont raison...)

Rama Yade est une opportuniste. Elle est à l'UDI car elle s'est fait dégager de l'UMP. C'est aussi simple que ça. Elle n'a, comme la plupart des hauts gradés de tous les partis, aucune opinion politique, mis à part un vague européïsme. Elle va où sont les votes. Quels détails tu veux ?

&gt;Tu me surprends je croyais que la bourgeoisie catho vous soutenait

Pas vraiment non. Les cathos votent moins FN que les autres. Les bourgeois votent moins FN que les pauvres et non éduqués. Il y a plein de sondages d'après vote qui confirment cela.

Le FN n'est plus le groupuscule d'avant, 70% de nos votes viennent de jeunes et de classes défavorisées, principalement hors des grandes agglomérations.

&gt;Pourquoi des partis tels que le PS ou l'UMP qui ont des appuis et du support financier qui semble être gigantesque ne semble pas pouvoir stopper l'avancée du FN?

Parce qu'ils sont pour l'immigration. Parce qu'ils ne font rien pour les personnes qui sont entre les 10% les plus pauvres et les 50% les plus pauvres. Parce qu'ils ont trop menti auparavant. Parce qu'ils se sentent abandonnés, voire méprisés par les autres.

Je te suggère ce rapport d'un think tank du PS en 2012 :

&gt;Aussi selon ton historique tu sembles ne pas apprécier la politique américaine et le FN aussi. Si les ricains ont été capable de créer des révolutions couleurs ou arraché des pays a la sphères russe. Qu-est ce qui ne les empêcheraient pas de nuire au FN.

C'est un risque. Ils l'ont déjà fait en jouant un rôle majeur bien que souterrain en 1968.

Having more layers of control and oversight ensures that if one institution makes a mistake, the others above it can correct it. Having these layers not be interdependent and not subject to the same center of power helps the cause of human rights even more.

Bingo. Except that when an official steal 1 billion, you must be a bit daft to go after the 2k wage employees instead. Or an hypocrit.

&gt; it couldn't have happened, could it?

Yes cutting wages would totally have prevented corrupt officials to steal all the budget money to the point the country crash /s

&gt; and allowed the market to clear for wages,

Except the US market don't pay ""wages"". Tossing 8 peanuts per hour isn't a ""wage"". It's , at best, deserving to get laughed in the face.

&gt; My point is why are there few jobs.

Because they aren't needed to run society anymore when factories can be robotized. Robots don't need sleep, food or retirement. Name me a job i can't automatise apart repairing said machines.

Now i'm just waiting the point where society wake up and realize that if only 10% of the pop need to work and get paid for it, maybe they should get paid even when not working. We call it pensions, unemployment, ... and maybe it's a good thing to not scam everyone earning those out of their income don't you think ? 

But oh no, all the money you can make by stealing it all their income, why should you care ? *Because we are going to pass laws, to make you care*. And if the billionaires libertarians don't agree, at my own level they can just go fuck themselves for all i care.

And US defense spending is a completely different issue since it includes American commitments to East Asia and non-NATO adventures (i.e., Iraq).

Wenn du dir nicht sicher bist was du machen willst und nicht wegen deines Alters oder sonst irgendwas unbedingt direkt zu Uni gehen musst, mach auf jeden Fall erst ein Praktikum, ein FSJ, einen Freiwilligendienst, wenn es finanziell drin ist einen Auslandsaufenthalt. 

Bildung in der Schule und in der Uni sind absolut wichtig, keine Frage, die Stundenpläne und Studiengänge sind aber so ausgelegt, dass mittlerweile gar keine Zeit mehr für einen wichtigen Punkt bleiben: das Bilden einer Persönlichkeit.

Du brauchst Zeit, du brauchst Freiheit, eigene Eindrücke, die Welt aus eigenen Augen erleben und aus möglichst vielen Perspektiven zu sehen, das ist es was in meinen Augen vielen Menschen heute fehlt. 

Schule in 8 Jahren durch, Wehrpflicht oder Zivi brauchen wir nicht mehr, das ist ein verschenktes Jahr, das Vordiplom machen wir zum Bachelor, damit zum vollwertigen Abschluss und die Leute können zwei Jahre eher Arbeiten bis sie umfallen. Wenn sie nicht umfallen umso besser, dann können sie länger arbeiten, am besten direkt bis 67, dann sparen wir in beiden Fällen bei der Rente.

Ist jetzt natürlich etwas überspitzt dargestellt, aber so handelt unsere Politik in letzter Zeit in meinen Augen.

Denk nicht (nur) drüber nach, ob du mit deinen Entscheidungen später mal glücklich wirst, da kann sich Zukunfts-_Pigeon_ drum kümmern.

Sei jetzt glücklich und lebe und lass dir von niemandem einreden, dass deine Lebenszeit ""verschenkt"" wäre, weil du sie für dich nutzt.

You can either acquire the language proficiency in Germany or in your home country. It's usually easier to do it in your home country. To get to Germany (from outside the EU), you need a visa. To get the student visa, you have to be accepted by a university. To do that, you usually need to prove you meet the language requirements. Some universities will provisionally accept you on the understanding that you will acquire the necessary skills within 1-2 semesters. But then you still need to prove to the immigration office that you have the necessary funds to support yourself for your time here. You might also have to pay for your lessons if you university doesn't have a high quality program of its own. That could easily be a lot more than you'd pay in China, since you couldn't go to subsidized courses like immigrants.

You only have to go to a Studienkolleg if your Hochschulzugangsberechtigung is not recognized by Germany. That really depends on where you're from and you'd have to look it up in http://anabin.kmk.org/.

Let me get this clear: Every. Single. Party. Knows independence is bad. That doesn't make me nationalist, that makes me realist. By the way, the fact you're saying Catalonia is a colony makes me think you left the school when you were 10 years old. Aragon joined Castile and formed Spain. If you say Catalonia is a colony, you're saying Madrid is a colony aswell. You just don't understand the meaning of colony.

So if you, hypothetically speaking, elect a party that wishes to behead all gay people, there's nothing at all wrong with beheading gay people because that's democracy? 

&gt; And anyway, they wouldn't be getting rid of human rights, they wouldn't all of a sudden start up concentration camps just because it's unchecked by some people in Strasbourg. You're just putting it like that because it makes self determination sound bad.

That's a straw man argument. Of course they won't be getting RID of human rights. 

They will, however, seize all power over human rights. Now combine that with the fact that it's **the governments** that most commonly infringe on human rights, and it should be clear why this motion is a VERY negative development from a human rights perspective.

Self determination applied to human rights does not SOUND bad, it IS bad. Human rights are - or ideally should be - universal. Every move against that is a step backwards for human rights.

Well, not ONLY the internet. I did take take mandatory English lessons starting in 5th grade and I also was fortunate enough to spend a lot of time with friends who grew up bilingual. And the fact that I just geek out over languages in general definitely was a big help.

Sure - I started out in Boston and went inland, Niagara, Chicago, then south to NO and then back to the East Coat and checked out the most important cities. As well as Baltimore. I was told numerous times I shouldn't have gone there but I enjoyed it. How did it compare... well, many things I knew or suspected stayed true. People approach you a lot more than what I am used to, which is nice, but can be ind of dangerous when you still have to learn to differentiate between friendli-/helpfulness and being creepy. In general, I felt a lot less safe than back home, but more ""connected"", if that makes sense. I'm a pretty outgoing person and I enjoy making acquaintaces in the street, which comes a lot easier and natural over there. 
But there's a lot of little details that I can't even think of right now and would take way too long to type out. You definitely notice the difference, even when you get to know at least one German in every hostel you go to (not kidding).

Veranstalterseitig war die Organisation erstaunlich gut durchdacht. Der Zaun entlang der gesperrten Straße war mit Müllsäcken für den anfallenden Müll präpariert, mehr als ausreichend Ordner vorhanden und die auch recht gut organisiert. Es wurden Taschen kontrolliert und ich wurde sogar abgetastet. Diese strenge Kontrolle war sicherlich für die Deeskalation sinnvoll.

Zur Teilnehmeranzahl: Auch wenn die Organisatoren es nicht wahrhaben wollten: Es waren zum Zeitpunkt meiner Anwesenheit etwa 200 Leute da. Ich fragte einen Ordner, der von 1500 Leuten sprach, einem Freund wurden sogar 2000 Leute genannt. Ich fragte eine Polizeieinheit, die schätzten wohlwollend auf 250-300 Teilnehmer. Ich habe ein Gespräch zwischen Ordnern mitbekommen, die der Meinung waren, die Polizei hätte weitere Straßen abgesperrt, um Leute an der Teilnahme an der Demo zu hindern. Ich habe nichts dergleichen beobachtet. Man wollte anscheinend nicht akzeptieren, dass es sich am PC leichter protestiert, als auf der Straße.

Auf den Fotos von mir und in Facebook etc. sieht es zum Teil nach mehr aus. Das liegt daran, dass die ""Kundgebung"" rund um das blaue Pavillon und den RTW großflächig abgesperrt war und die wenigen Leute um diese Absperrung herum standen.

Viel passiert ist nicht. Die Hundehalter wurden von der Presse interviewt, und gaben schwer verständliche Statements via Megaphon ab. Dann durften auch Demo-Teilnehmer ihre Statements in das Megaphon abgeben. Von ""Tierschutz ist wichtig"" bis ""Polizei komm raus und stell dich"" war alles dabei.

Ich habe bisschen gelauscht und dann das Gespräch mit einer Hundehalterin gesucht. Auch bei ihr war der mein Hinweis, dass es nicht allzu weitsichtig war, die Hunde als ""Alarmanlagenersatz"" zurückzulassen, da sie bei Einbruch dann halt frei sind, eher Randnotiz. Als letztes Glied der Verkettung an unglücklichen Umständen ist die Polizei schuld.

* watched lots of anime with English subs (helped a lot since I depended on the subs) and movies in English
* watched a lot of YouTube videos (especially vlogs - there wasn't much else back then and it was the best source for idiomatic/colloquial English) and Stand-Up comedy
* spent a lot of time reading and later writing comments and talking to myself/my appliances/homework/cat in English

Also music, school and speaking English to other people, although that was definitely the rarest. For each of these things I would look up words I didn't know every time I didn't know them. I still do that. Through using them right away, they stick better. 

Effects:

* I developed a weird accent at around 13, which was a mix of everything and helped me ""file"" until it sounded right
* I could speak both American and British English acceptably well at about 15 (that got more and more refined over the following years, though)
* When I'm by myself, I speak English 80% of the time. I can't help it by now, it's just what feels natural. 

Of course, all of this is sped up a LOT through spending time in a native country, but we all know that.

In case it gives you more hope: My sister is noticably less talented at picking up languages than I am and her English is at a very high level through pretty much the same methods. Practice really does make perfect :) The important thing for all of these methods is a good base, though. I can't use any of these yet with Russian, for example. I'm still at the ""HEY I JUST UNDERSTOOD 5 WORDS IN SUCCESSION!""-stage with that.

You have to be very stupid to think it can't be done because your current government tells you so. It has been done, it can be done, it is legal, it is factible, you just want to cling to a burning nail. It refuses to the referendum on the independence of catalonia, not the constitution change itself. Don't you see it? They're not denying you to vote, they're denying you to do so inconstitutionally! As they should!
Changing the constitution means you can change everything democratically, there's no difference on the requirements to change the first article or the second. ""They aren't, they won't, they don't want to..."" But you NEVER asked them. You're basing that on suppositions and you know it. There's no need all the political parties agree, the only thing that matters is how many ministers and spainards agree. Let's not talk about Ibarretxe and the inconstitutionality of his plan. He didn't try to change the constitution, either, he just tried to change the statute. 
You're both catalonians and basques whining about the government not letting you decide and arguing everything you try to do Madrid just declares it illegal, but NEVER tried to change the constitution itself.
So you're telling me you never studied in a public school? Never went to the hospital? You have to thank your parents and you, but Spain aswell. Not in every country you fall sick and you don't have to pay a shit to get treatment. The *deshauciados* were expulsed from their houses by the banks, not the state. There have been attempts to do something, but that's the thing with democracies, majority has to agree. And by the way, that's not patriotism. Patriotism is not related to society, politics or economy. That's comlpetely other topic.

Mittwoch hatte ich meine mündliche Prüfung nach 2 Jahren Studium. Was soll man sagen, ich habe den Prüfern teilweise die Antworten gegeben, bevor sie fertig mit reden waren. Die logische Konsequenz war eine glatte 1. Das war aber auch einfach, abgefragt wurde Linux (Zugriffsverwaltung etc.) und Programmierung (Java + die Technologie hinter Java). Verbessert meinen Durchschnitt ganz gut, also bin ich zufrieden.

Freitag durfte ich von der Firma aus die InnoTrans in Berlin besuchen. Morgens um 7 also los in Stuttgart und 5,5h ICE gefahren. Was soll man sagen, es sind halt Züge. Weiß nicht, wieso manche das so faszinierend finden. :D    
Abends ging es dann noch in eine Bar und einen Irish Pub und am nächsten Morgen haben einige von uns (waren zu 7.) eine Ibuprofen gebraucht. Dann habe ich noch eine Bekannte besucht und gegen Abend ging es dann mit 70 Minuten Verspätung zurück nach Stuttgart.

Oh, und mein iPhone 5 hat nach einem Jahr (Austauschgerät) den Geist aufgegeben, es lädt einfach nicht mehr bzw. geht nicht mehr an seit der Akku leer ging. Im Apple Store wurde mir erklärt, dass das mein Problem sei, da ich in Berlin war und mein Zug in 1,5h abfuhr, konnte leider nicht mehr sehr deutlich machen, dass das eben nicht mein Problem ist. Morgen werde ich also bei Apple Care anrufen (habe allerdings keinen Protection Plan oder so) und erklären, dass Apple entweder ein neues Gerät schneller sendet als Amazon Prime ein Konkurrenzprodukt oder ich einen Termin im Apple Store bekomme, und zwar nicht wenn es denen passt, sondern wenn es mir passt.

Ich möchte mich noch hiermit bei den Niederländern im Irish Pub entschuldigen, dass in 3 Jahren dort wegen des Klimawandels alles unter Wasser ist, war nur eine Theorie, die mein Kollege mit Hilfe von viel Alkohol aufgestellt hat.

Why not? If it's democratic, and it's your stance that one should never ignore democracy.

Democracy does not override human rights or civil rights. In fact, both are *necessary* for the democracy to works as intended.

&gt; And from a human rights perspective I can recognise your concern, but you should make a better argument to the voters of this country than just saying ""well you aren't allowed to question these things at all, the ECHR is never at fault, if you think they are then you are just wrong and you have no way of changing it. Tough shit."" 

That was never the argument at all.

Understand that the purpose of ECHR is to strive to make a *MINIMUM* degree of rights uniform across Europe. 

Countries are still free and welcome to go *BEYOND* that minimum in providing their citizens additional rights without needing anyone's approval. For example, Finland made internet access a human right. 

What countries are not allowed to do is *RESTRICT* human rights below that minimum. This is the ONLY instance where ECHR can possibly stand in the way of a member state. Therefore, it follows that any political motion that opposes ECHR IS a motion towards restriction of human rights. It serves no other purpose, it has no other point. 

My argument for the voters of UK is therefor that you should not care who provides additional protection and minimal guarantees for your human rights - whether it's your country, the EU, the UN - as long as you GET that extra layer of protection. This is not about your country, this is about you as a person, an individual, and a human being. 

If your country can guarantee you more rights than the ECHR and protect them better, ECHR will NOT stand in the way and you have no reason to care or even notice that it exists. ECHR can only stand in the way if your country wants to undermine the human rights guaranteed by them.

Your government wishes to remove this layer of protection and the guarantees it provides. There can be NO logical argument by which this can possibly be beneficial to any individual. ",0,1411933353,null,0,1411933822,0,ckuxgw3,t3_2ho7jq,t1_ckuxgw3,t1_ckuwqar,null,1426780750,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

We don't need them to want it, we need them to allow us to make a choice and then respect it. That is what self-determination is all about. IU and Podemos both are in favour of allowing referendums asking for independence. They would rather we chose not to be independent, but both have said that they respect our right to decide. That's democracy, not this farce the PP and PSOE have created.

&gt; By the way, the fact you're saying Catalonia is a colony makes me think you left the school when you were 10 years old.

You misinterpreted me, perhaps I wasn't very clear. I didn't mean to say that Catalonia is a colony because it isn't. I meant that other message you have where you claim that the independence of the American colonies was a bad thing.

&gt; because some assholes got into the classrooms and taught an entire generation that what you needed was independence.

You think we are brainwashed, but in reality the only brainwashed people here is you. They don't go around in schools telling children to be separatists. That's what paranoid people who read ABC and La Razón think. We only need to be self-aware to want independence, and we are. We know that our languages and culture can only survive if we protect it, because Spain doesn't give a flying fuck for it. If we have what we have (and I'm talking about the Basque Country) is because we have fought for it. 

&gt;it's about fucking FORTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE up

I failed to see why 47 million people would be fucked up. If Catalonia leaving means Spain gets fucked, then the problem is not with Catalonia but with Spain itself. Why is it so dependant on Catalonia? Grow your fucking industry and stop relying on Brits coming every summer.

&gt;It is possible to change the constitution. It was changed in 1992 and 2011. You just want to think you can't

Yeah, it was changed... with minor things. You know as good as me that to allow a binding referendum the part that needs to be changed lies within the first chapters (Titles) of the Constitution, the ones that say ""the sovereignty of Spain lies in all the Spaniards, etc, etc"". That part is not so easy to change, not like the changes made in 1992 and 2011, that were minor and only required 50%+1 of the Congress. This change would require 2/3rds of approval in both Congress and Senate, then new elections, then the new congress would have to approve the changes by 50%+1 and then all the country would have to vote in a referendum. That's just not going to happen, mainly because the Spanish government will not let it get even to stage one. 

&gt;Just ally with the republicans to demand a referendum

The PP has currently the absolute majority in the Congress. All the nationalist parties together and the Republicans don't reach the 2/3rds, neither in the Congress nor in the Senate.

I did study in a public school and went to the hospital many times.

I'm guessing this has to do with my 19th century comment. It is true. Before that, what existed was the Monarchy of Spain, not Spain as a nation. The national feeling was born in the early 19th century, along with all the nationalisms, yes, including the Basque and Catalan ones. Ever read the 1812 Constitution? Its title is not ""Constitution of Spain"", but ""Constitution of the Monarchy of Spain"". The state had zero effect on the population beyond taxes and drafting. Do you think a peasant living in La Mancha in 1750 gave a shit about Spain? They didn't. They only started to do so in the 19th century.

Different universities offer different courses. For example some offer courses starting from A1 and some from B1 and in the seconda case he will need a proof that he is at B1. Usually the sprachenzentrum at the university offers these so you can easily find out by googling. I did my course in  Duisburg-Essen and they had A1 courses but that was 5 years ago thing might have changed. Another requirment is usually that you are already accepted at the university so he has to apply for whatever he wants to study and additionally ask for a prep course. 
&gt;Also I have heard (and this is what puzzles me) that most students also have to go through a Studienkolleg because Germany does not recognize foreign High School Diplomas. Is that correct?

this depends on his high school, country. Given that he alread has a bachelor degree it is very unlikely that he will need studienkolleg. Check on the [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/deutschland/nach-deutschland/voraussetzungen/de/6017-der-richtige-schulabschluss/) site to be sure.

1. in Russia there are no more homophoby than in other countries. In Sochi during the Olympic games there was a gay club working all the time. Please compare this to Saudi Arabia where gays are simply executed. And Saudi Aravia is No1 friend of USA in Middle East. You still believe its about gay rights?

2. So called ""russian opposition"" is extremely corrupted ex-government party from the 90s. Their leaders are ALL from highly corrupted Eltsin's circle: ex vice-prime minister Nemtsov, ex prime-minister Kasyanov, daugther of ex-prime minister Gaidar, criminal olygarch Chodorkovsky accused in stealing and his people accused in murder of a mayor who tried to force him to pay the taxes, and his lawer Navalny, accused in fraud, caught being lying about his hidden business in Europe, all these best sons of Russian nation are visiting US Embassy each time before the elections. 
These are the people Russians should vote for, as our western friends suggest. Its not the face of our future, it is a face of our past. And we really regret our past was like this. Unfortunately there are no real opposition in Russia. Yes, thats bad :(

3. Putin is supported by 60% of population and after the Crym his chances are even higher. There is absolutely no need for him to fabricate the elections, persecute opposition leaders or close opposition newspapers. Just think of one simple fact: No1 radio station of opposition ""Echo Moskvy"" (Echo of Moscow) is a property of government controlled Gazprom! Putin can easily and legally close this radio but his is afraid people will consider this not-democratic. Does this really resembles you the old good KGB guys?

4. The economy of Russia is still ok. There is a very low unemployment ratio, salaries are in the middle of other East-European countries, in big cities like Moscow there are more good cars than in European capitals. Birth rate is one of the highest in Europe, life expectancy is the highest for all the time of measurements in Russia. We are rebuilding the aircraft industry with SuperJet, manufacturing Nuclear Plants for half of the world, building our own microprocessors for military needs, using our own social networks and search engines, controlling great share of grain market, raising a share of oil products in our exports instead of crude oil. Yes, there are still a lot of problems in Russia, but its getting better.

And of course, there are some countries which would prefer seeing Russia weak, poor and controlled by drunk president..

Most of the agreement was leaked a month ago, and it shows that we're all legally bound by its investor rights and other provisions before it's ratified, and **even if we don't ratify it**.

t's done through the magic of ""Provisional Application.""

UNESCO Glossary: [Provisional Application](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/international-migration/glossary/provisional-application/)

&gt; ""The growing use of provisional application clauses in treaties is a consequence of the need felt to give effect to treaty obligations prior to a state’s formal ratification of / accession to a treaty....""

Europe's 1994 Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) included investor rights provisions.  When Germany recently decided to phase out nuclear power stations - reducing Swedish company Vattenfall's future profits - Vattenfall used the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism to claim €3.7 billion.  This is why the German press is so sensitive to investor rights provisions in treaties today.

Meanwhile, Russia, Belarus, Iceland, Norway and Australia signed the ECT, but have never ratified it.  In 2009 Russia announced its decision to not become a Contracting Party to it and officially withdrew from the ECT.  Those countries are still bound by their ECT commitments.  Article 45 (3) (b) states that ""In the event that a signatory terminates provisional application…any Investments made in its Area during such provisional application by Investors of other signatories shall nevertheless remain in effect with respect to those Investments for twenty years following the effective date of termination.""

In 2004 the Russian government stole/nationalized the Yukos Oil Company, which had foreign investors.  In 2014 the ECT dispute arbitration tribunal ordered the Russian Federation to pay damages in excess of USD 50 Billion (with a B) to Yukos shareholders.  Plus USD 60 million in legal fees and EUR 4.2 million in arbitration costs.  It was the largest arbitration award in history.

Remember, this is for a treaty that Russia did not ratify.  ([citation](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140801/05242228082/corporate-sovereignty-tribunal-makes-50-billion-award-against-russia.shtml))

The leaked CETA final secret draft page 498 (page 500 of the leaked PDF) has a similar clause:

&gt; ""4. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, if the provisional application of this Agreement is terminated and it does not enter into force, a claim may be submitted pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, regarding any matter arising during the period of the provisional application of this Agreement, pursuant to the rules and procedures established in this Agreement, and provided no more than **three (3) years** have elapsed since the date of termination of the provisional application.""

""Provisional application"" refers to the time between when we agree to the treaty and when we ratify it.  (See the UNESCO explanation above.) Once we DO ratify it, according to a clause on the same page...

&gt; ""2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, in the event that the present Agreement is terminated, the provisions of [Chapter X Investment] shall continue to be effective for a further period of 20 years from that date in respect of investments made before the date of termination of the present Agreement. This paragraph shall not apply in the case of the provisional application of this Agreement.""

So once ratified, should we terminate the agreement, we're bound for a further 20 years after termination.

But suppose we don't ratify it.  Suppose that once CETA is made public for ratification, many are opposed to it and it's not ratified.  We're still bound by it for three years.  Governments - that is, the taxpayers - can still be sued if we pass or enforce any law in that time that harms investors.

No. Because there is more to life than [hedonism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism) and I repudiate the notion that ""if it *feels* good, then it *is* good"". Is that the only way to objectively judge an action, by whether or not the parties consented? Homosexuals do not deserve the same rights enjoyed by heterosexual couples because the acts in which they partake have different consequences. Hetro sex often ends in pregnancy. Homo sex does not. Why should homosexuals be awarded the same benefits of heterosexuals when they bear none of the burden?

The Wikipedia page on the [Equal Protection Clause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause#Gender.2C_disability.2C_and_sexual_orientation) offers some interesting tid bits.

&gt;In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the Court struck down a Texas statute prohibiting homosexual sodomy on substantive due process grounds. In Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion concurring in the judgment, however, she argued that by prohibiting only homosexual sodomy, and not heterosexual sodomy as well, Texas's statute did not meet rational-basis review under the Equal Protection Clause; her opinion prominently cited City of Cleburne, and also relied in part on Romer. Notably, O'Connor's opinion did not claim to apply a higher level of scrutiny than mere rational basis, and the Court has not extended suspect-class status to sexual orientation.

&gt;While the courts have applied rational-basis scrutiny to classifications based on sexual orientation, it has been argued that discrimination based on gender should be interpreted to include discrimination based on sexual orientation, in which case intermediate scrutiny could apply to gay rights cases. Other scholars disagree, arguing that ""homophobia"" is distinct from sexism, in a sociological sense, and so treating it as such would be an unacceptable judicial shortcut.

&gt;In 2013, the Court struck down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, in United States v. Windsor. No state statute was in question, and therefore the Equal Protection Clause did not apply. The Court did employ similar principles, however, in combination with federalism principles. The Court did not purport to use any level of scrutiny more demanding than rational basis review, according to law professor Erwin Chemerinsky. The four dissenting justices argued that the authors of the statute were rational.

So far the Supreme Court had not ""extended suspect-class status to sexual orientation"" and ""Other scholars disagree, arguing that ""homophobia"" is distinct from sexism, in a sociological sense, and so treating it as such would be an unacceptable judicial shortcut"".

Wondering out loud if [suspect classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspect_classification) is correct for homosexuality, let's look some criteria used to classify suspect classification of groups.

&gt;Some of the criteria that have been cited include:

&gt;    -The group has historically been discriminated against, and/or have been subject to prejudice, hostility, and/or stigma, perhaps due, at least in part, to stereotypes.

&gt;    -They possess an immutable and/or highly visible trait.

&gt;    -They are powerless to protect themselves via the political process. (The group is a ""discrete"" and ""insular"" minority.)

&gt;    -The group's distinguishing characteristic does not inhibit it from contributing meaningfully to society.

After reviewing the list I still feel that it is wrong to give special status to homosexuals. Have they ""historically been discriminated against""? Yes. Is sexual orientation ""immutable"" or ""highly visible""? Yes and no. Sexual orientation for the most part is unchanging but there is a notable level of plasticity to it. If it is 100% hard coded then why the new addition of Q for 'questioning' to LBGTQ? 'Questioning' implies that there is some sort of decision to be made. Conversely, sexual orientation is not a highly visible trait by any means. Are homosexuals ""powerless to protect themselves via the political process""? No they are not powerless as evidenced by gay governors, legislators, and straight-gay-alliance legislators. ""The group's distinguishing characteristic does not inhibit it from contributing meaningfully to society."". The last point is debatable but I feel is mainly a slippery slope. The same can be said of proponents of polygamy. I suppose it depends on what the definition of ""contributing meaningfully to society"" is.


Something that gets lost in the conversation is the will of the people. Let's not forget that the US Government is (or supposed to be anyway...) ""of the people, for the people, and by the people"". Meaning that the 'people' get to decide the laws of the country based on their will. I do not take that to mean that laws must conform to some idea of universal objectivity. Rather, laws should reflect the subjective will of the people.

Proponents of ""marriage equality"" equate it with some sort of universal objective outlook, when in reality its still based on subjective feelings. Proponents like you usually say something like ""...between two consenting adults..."". I want to know where they get this magical 'two' number. If the question is merely what consenting adults decide then that opens the door to polygamy being legal.

You see, here in Italy English is not considered a really important subject, especially during the earliest years of school (if I'm not mistaken, and I might be, you're not even required to have a degree in English to teach it in primary schools).
But I'm going out of topic...
Apart from school, actually, an average Italian guy doesn't have many English stimuli: yes, we do have commercials and so on, but they're usually in a very basic English. Everyone could understand them.
The point is, I think, that most of the people who speak a good English are people who read in English, watch movies and series in English, take English courses, et cetera et cetera.
Oh, the music, yes. We do listen to a lot of international music and it's very useful, but it's not really the way we learn the language.
So, I think that most of the job is done by youngsters who decide to have a personal culture and not by school or external stimuli. 
Well, to be fair we have a type of high school where you learn foreign languages: I actually don't know how much English you study there, but it's certainly more than in other schools (I'm attending a ""liceo classico"" (classic high school (?), don't really know how to say) and we have only 3 hours of English a week, versus the 4 of Ancient Greek and 4 of Latin).
To get back in topic, yes: Italians are likely to learn English because of the amount of English-language culture creeping in through the Internet and music and so on, but there are not many people who do that.

Yes we do, and I will tell you why. 

The primary case is the anti-war argument, which is true - the EU has kept peace in Western Europe for decades now. By knitting the member nations together economically, culturally and mentally you are will make a pan-European war such as the Napoleon Wars and World Wars infeasible. 

Secondary case is the economic aspect, the European Union has seen trade rise up in Europe like never before, created worker mobility on an unprecedented scale and granted a huge export market for companies in all of Europe.

Tertiary case is the political argument. With juggernauts such as China, USA, Rusia, India, etc. on the world stage the Europeans need a political body that can compete with their sheer economic power or else we will as many nations have before, in history, fall into becoming puppet nations or colonies. At the end of the day we stand together or become partitioned like Poland was to Austria, Russia and Prussia, or Germany between France, UK, Russia and the USA. Such a development would be inevitable without a powerful political force to stop it. Right now the EU cannot live up to this exact case, but that is rather an argument for further integration.

It was established on 1 January 1994 following an agreement between the member states and the [European Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Communities), which later became the EU.

If the thing happening is terrible, it will be too late to rely on education to fix it.

&gt; you neglect to see that you are also implying that they can't be trusted to vote on their own issues and control their own country as we are living in a democracy

No, I am implying that elected politicians are not to be trusted. I believe at least LibDem and most Labour voters will agree in a heartbeat. I know most of Scotland will agree given the recent developments. I don't think anyone would outright disagree.

I would like to see someone try to make a coherent argument why people should give up benefits of an institution that **guarantees** human rights in favor of being able to ""vote on it"". Bearing in mind that you can already vote to extend and expand the scope of human rights, you are only barred from restricting them.

&gt; Your reply that they should be grateful they get protection from the EU will just be met by people saying they don't think the people they elected are idiots who are trying to destroy their human rights.

Oh, I doubt many people are going to say that.

To those that do, I would say - why take that risk in the first place? It is the kind of risk where you literally have nothing to gain and everything to lose. 

&gt; Human rights isn't even a big issue in politics at the moment in the UK, the EU and what is seen as foreign intervention is a very big issue in politics right now

And it is that political atmosphere that is being abused by the current government to abolish the supranational institutions that clearly work **in favor** of the UK citizens, and can not possibly hurt UK citizens in any way. 

The fact that Tories want to do this indicates that human rights WILL be an issue. It is a clear statement that your (current) government does not wish to guarantee your human rights as extensively as ECHR does.

* Napolitano, the President (an institutional role above that of the Prime Minister, but not involved in government) is being called as witness in a trial about State-Mafia negotiations in the 90s. The charge is that after the Mafia killed two high profile judges, the government and police came with some agreement with the Mafia. Napolitano has been refusing to witness so far, and succeeded in having recordings of his telephone conversations at the time deleted.

Just to put this in a European non-NATO context, in terms of flat expenditure Ireland spends more than;

Belarus, Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Georgia, Cyprus, Armenia, Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia, Slovakia, Bosnia, Latvia,  and Bulgaria. Sometimes more than several of these countries combined. 

And all of them spend a higher % of their GDP towards their military than Ireland does, and if most people were to be asked ""Who would win in a war"", in quite a few of those cases I'd doubt people would say Ireland. 

The point I'm making here is that while % of GDP is a relevant factor, what's also relevant is simply raw expenditure in relation to size, the allocation of resources(Are you going to blow it on trivial things that are not needed or on updating your infantry arsenal?) and all the rest of that. You can have a very well equipped and reasonably strong military without meeting the 2% marker. 

Of course, if you do meet the 2% marker, you *can* always find something to spend it on, the military is a black hole of expenditure that way. But I don't believe, and I don't think I'm alone in this regard, that you require an extremely well fit-for-purpose military with a 2% GDP spend.

[Modern Healthcare: Underinsured ACA Enrollees Strain Community Health Centers](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140925/NEWS/309259947/underinsured-aca-enrollees-strain-community-health-centers)

Obamacare enrollees are straining the finances of community health centers around the country, some health center leaders say. The issue is that many lower-income patients with insurance coverage through the federal and state exchanges bought bronze-tier plans with lower premiums but high deductibles, coinsurance and copayments and no federal cost-sharing subsidies. When these patients face high out-of-pocket costs for care that falls below the deductible, they can't afford it.  So the centers are subsidizing that care by offering them means-tested sliding-scale fees. When the centers, which are not allowed to turn away patients for inability to pay, try to get the insurers to pay, the claims are usually denied, and the centers have to write it off as uncompensated care (Dickson, 9/25).

health ""plans"" for the poor  - *THAT DON'T COVER HOSPITALIZATIONS AT ALL*?

[Kaiser Health News: Debate Grows Over Employer Plans With No Hospital Benefits](http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/September/26/employee-insurance-hospitalization-coverage.aspx)

As companies prepare to offer medical coverage for 2015, debate has grown over government software that critics say can trap workers in inadequate plans while barring them from subsidies to buy fuller coverage on their own. At the center of contention is the calculator -- an online spreadsheet to certify whether plans meet the Affordable Care Act’s toughest standard for large employers, the ‘minimum value’ test for adequate benefits (Hancock, 9/26).

La première, on est en trek en Argentine, on vient de se taper 7h de montée, on se repose au refuge devant une bière, mes deux potes français, et un écossais rencontré là bas. L'un de mes deux companeros ne parle pas d'autre langue que le français ou alors très mal (un accent à la Slobodan Milosevic en espagnol c'est assez dépaysant). Bref, il entame une conversation avec son accent et son bagout avec un couple de chilien à notre grande tablée. Et on commence à entendre deux gars qui en anglais se foutent de sa gueule. Plutôt ouvertement et pas vraiment friendly.
Notre pote écossais, 45 ans, un croisement improbable entre Mel Gibson et Thor se lève et leur a tenu à peu près ce discours : ""mais qui vous êtes pour juger de l'accent d'un mec vous qui ne parlez qu'une langue, ne faîtes jamais d'effort pour apprendre ne serait-ce qu'à dire bonjour dans la langue du pays où vous séjournez, connards d'américains"". 
Citer le nombre de pays dans lesquels j'ai pu constaté que les américains ne font aucun effort pour pratiquer la langue ou un semblant me prendrait la nuit.
J'aime beaucoup ces gens, mais je ne peux me résoudre à ne pas voir là l'un de leur problème majeur : un egocentrisme de merde. 

La seconde, c'est celle d'une américaine croisée elle aussi en voyage. Version courte, elle étudie le néerlandais. Pourquoi ? Pour émigrer aux Pays Bas. Je lui pose la question pourquoi pas la GB, la Suisse, l'Italie ou la France ? Le monceau de connerie qu'elle a pu me déverser sur mon pays... (notre pays). Sûre de son fait, sûre de sa connerie. Et pourtant éduquée, bon job etc. 

Bref, j'ai pas d'explication à fournir en dehors de celles déjà citées. Mais il faut aussi se souvenir que le sentiment anti français était très très fort chez les Russes au milieu des années 90 quand nous avions bombardé la Serbie, notre allié historique, celui que nous voulions protéger en 14 (entendu plusieurs fois dans la partie russe de la famille). 

Enfin, Reddit est peuplé de connards ; mais où n'en trouve-t'on pas sur les internets ?

I just corrected the strictly grammatical mistakes, as you didn't want an ""in-depth analysis"". Just a few remarks: 
* ""Sache"" might not be your word of choice, I'd opt for ""Ding"" (if you want to keep the colloquial tone) or maybe ""Gegenstand"" (more formal, think ""item"" in English). 

* I don't know how formal or colloquial this is supposed to sound (who is telling this to whom?). If you intended it to sound even a little bit formal, you could think of losing the ""Na"" and replace the ""komisch"" (""einen komischen Unterschied"") with ""seltsam"" (""einen seltsamen Unterschied"").

* ""verhindert Sehkraft für dem Träger"" - it should be ""verhinder**n**"" becaue you're talking about multiple items (Bälle und Spiralfedern), also ""de**n** Träger"", not ""dem"". Causes suck, I know. But most importantly, ""Sehkraft"" and ""verhindern"" don't really go together. ""Verhindern"" suggests stopping an action or a process from happening, while ""Sehkraft"" is something static, if you catch my drift. Alternative suggestion:

""Die Bälle und Spiralfedern hängen schlapp herunter und verhindern, dass der Träger etwas sieht.""

now here comes the best part:
a couple of aquaintances in kiev tell me they know jack shit too. people can chose between the official announcements of the ukraine government or the official russian side. apparently they usually dont, as both sides are filled with shit to the brim.

from a geostrategic perspective, its even pretty easy. 
its cuba crisis reloaded, this time inverted however. russia doesnt want the nato to fuck around an important chocking point of their power projection doctrine. not surprising after the nato membership of the baltic states and the completely unnecessary polish abm drama.

people in power on both sides and everything in between are basically good old cold warriors, too stupid to act in a world thats not black/white.
all of them, from our beloved champion in naked bear wrestling to the turd in the ginormous white marble crapper in D.C., including our very own super glue fetishist chancellor and that raving mad danish former nato secretary; pretty much all of them grew up in the reagan/kuznetsov era, with the resulting heavy brain damage.

If anything, OP will probably read this.

Americans don't hate French people. It's as simple as that. People say stupid shit on the internet - it's a fact. No matter what country is discussed, there will be a circlejerk of comments trash-talking that country. You only notice the French-bashing because you're French. 

I grew up in the midwest in one of the most conservative families possible (think FoxNews on the TV 24/7) and nobody has anything bad to say about France. I tell people I'm living in Lyon and the most common response is just ""that's nice"" and if the person really wants to include a stereotype they'll say something like ""I hope you like wine!"". Never do they ever say anything negative and I can assure you, this isn't just my experience.

Besides to tell you not to worry about French-bashing, I want to comment that I read posts like these all the time on /r/France that just evolve into American-bashing. The post is about being positive and level-headed, so when you start linking things like /r/shitamericanssay it just contributes to the circlejerk attitude that you are trying to prevent.

Peccato che tu non abbia un'apertura mentale tale da consentirti di ascoltare opinioni diverse dalle tue.

Ti riporto comunque qualche passaggio interessante emerso dal CMV, su cui sicuramente non converrai perché sono cose da ""giustizialisti"":

&gt; Ideally, prosecutors would have the high integrity to only bring forward criminal cases/ corruption cases against politicians after enough evidence had been gathered that the case was open and shut. That's how it generally works with the FBI in the US. Likewise, politicians would have the high integrity to resign once they were indicted. **Once this system breaks down and politicians think they're being targeted for political reasons, and prosecutors think politicians are sleazy hacks who don't care about the dignity of their office, then you break down into a worse, more cynical kind of system where prosecutors are bringing cases left and right and politicians are all rumored to be crooks.** 
___
&gt; There is a concept that is applied to civil servants and elected officials - it's not enough to just not break laws, but you have a responsibility to avoid the ""appearance of impropriety"".
___
**Finally, the burden of proof in a criminal case is high. ""not guilty""&lt;&gt;""innocent"". Just because they were unable to build enough evidence to convict doesn't mean that there weren't laws broken.** If it's something your opponents can use against you, again, you might be better off taking a break.
___
So to preserve the integrity of the politicial system, insulate their party from damage, and leave a job they can no longer do effectively, it is often better for a politician accused of a crime to resign immediately.

First one is fairly famous: [Alexander Lehmann](https://www.youtube.com/user/alexanderlehmann/videos). He did some animation work for Extra3, a satirical show on NDR. Most of his relevant work is a bit dated and very political, he has not been as active as a few years ago. ""Du bist Terrorist"" and ""RetteDeineFreiheit.de"" are the ones worth watching.

Another one I found through Reddit is Kurzgesagt. They maintain two channels, an [English](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt) and a [German](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwRH985XgMYXQ6NxXDo8npw) one. An interesting variety of videos focussed on thought-provoking science-y material in the style of Minute Physics and Vsauce. Lovely visual style.

Last one is [Klaus Kauker/MusikTraining](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAXAtQN3WqV9Tir_xlgGIyw). Despite the name, he is focussed on deep analysis and explanation of musical concepts, phenomenons and trivia. He seems very professional and presents the content in an enjoyable manner, even for absolute amateurs like me. Sadly, he has not been very active in the last half year.

That is basically everything I can find in my sub list, as sad as that is. Out of 120 subscriptions, only 5 or so are German.

For example, compare US spending and total European spending. OK, the US spends several times more, but that should make the Europeans only a few times less effective right? So they should totally be able to manage one war like Iraq or Afghanistan if they really tried, because the US army is way too powerful anyway so the European army should be just right. 

**Wrong**. The Europeans are much worse than their total spending would have you believe, and in a war against Russia (without US help), I'm placing my bets on Russia. Indeed in any war, the Europeans have so far proved totally useless and always had NATO save their ass. This is because whilst US and Russian armies are unified, and spending is effectively allocated (e.g spend 10 monies on tanks, 20 monies on drones, 5 monies on equipment, then check the state of the army), in Europe there are literally dozens of small armies, each with its own equipment, weapons, ammunition, special teams, intelligence units, and logistics. A nightmare for any economist, because funds are spent by each state on little useless units instead of paying for one large badass army. At the same time, the nation states try to save as much money as possible because their armies are not in immediate danger, so for example in my own Czech Republic soldiers have to buy their own equipment! Just imagine that mess if each soldier, from 28 different states, had to do that. Compared to the US or Russian armies, we look like barbarians: under equipped, divided, and certainly not ready for combat.

 In Iraq, the US generals had to use like 5 phones when they wanted to talk to the Europeans. Similarly, you can't just pick up your mate's weapon if he's from a different state because you won't have ammo nor know how to use it. Finally, the little bureaucracies and officers of each state also swallow a lot of money.

What Europe needs right now is to either make one large army, or better yet, unify its armies under a preexisting organisation like NATO. That way funds will be allocated much more effectively.

You know how much Spaniards like to talk and how taking a leak is by no means a reason to stop doing it. They're no doors, just stupid acoustic barriers.

Joknes aside. As a Spaniard with German education I must say that the Spanish culture is more about open-doorness than about the rather fierce defence of privacy and bounds of Germans. Many will leave their dorm doors also half open at night (given there's nothing disturbing their sleep going on outside), which by the way ensures some nice chilly airflow during the hot summers. They obviously don't expect you to or will be eavesdropping themselves through the crack nor is this any sort of invitation to come in. 

The appropriate protocol if one were to engage any kind of communication through such a door is to do it from a safe distance, knock and make sure that your body language does by no means imply you're looking into the room. 

That being said, if it really makes you uncomfortable or if they're taking deuces with an open door (which is an absolute no-no even for Spaniards), talk to them frankly. They're probably not aware it's that big of an issue to you and may be *open* to change that behaviour.

Edit: just noticed that I was assuming this was taking place in Spain.
