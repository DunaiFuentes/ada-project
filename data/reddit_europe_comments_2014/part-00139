It should however specifically house members of Al Qaeda who are distinct because they are an outside force seeking to enter and attack US territory.

Ora prova a intervistare uno dei tuoi allievi genitori, forse sa cosa è facebook ma dubito che sappia cos'è snapchat e del potenziale pericolo che rappresenta (tipo scambiarsi foto zozze che nonostante tutto rimarranno in rete per sempre).


Quindi oltre al pedofilo online esistono altri pericoli di cui è difficile anche solo farsi un'idea, a meno di non tenersi costantemente aggiornati.

European NATO members are spending more than adequately to provide for their defense and the defense of other NATO members should it be needed.

The problem here is that NATO has been turned from an organization concerned with the **defense** of its member states into a military alliance that's taken on a world police \ power projection role that it was never designed to have.

NATO was designed to defend Western Europe and North America from aggression from the Communist block. Even today, it is very capable of doing its job in this regard.

NATO was not designed to intervene in other countries to stop civil wars or genocides, it was not designed with the capability to launch air campaigns in Northern Africa to oust dictators, it was not designed as a tool of proactive foreign policy. And it shouldn't be used as such.

Also, let's for a second dispel the myth that Europe is under ""the American defense umbrella"". Europe doesn't need US help to defend itself. The EU has 1.5 million men in arms, a 200 billion defense budget (1.55% of GDP), two countries with an independent nuclear arsenal with first and second strike capability. Our only likely opponent, Russia, has 766 000 active personel, a 100 billion defense budget (4.4% of GDP) and the same nuclear capability as us. If tensions arose, we could easily reach 4x the defense budget of Russia while still spending less of a share of GDP than they are currently spending.

You raise an interesting point here. When 9/11 happened (which was done by saudis and orchestrated by a saudi man) NATO declared it an ""act of war"" (which is an internationally legally recognised term)  which meant europeans were sent out to Afghanistan as per their obligations. 

Under that context they really should be called a military identity - which makes the black site CIA prisons all the worst because ""Prisoners of War"" (a [defined and internationally recognised legal term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war) should be treated by the geneva convention which does not allow torture. 

I don't care how upset you are by 9/11 - international law says it is illegal and in theory it should be brought before the ICC under

&gt;outrages upon human dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment; 

Whether you like it or not the Geneva convention is international law. 

Now George Bush got around this by saying that Al Qaeda weren't POW's because they weren't in military uniform - yet NATO declared 9/11 an ""act of war"" (you understand only sovereign countries can declare acts of war).

Torture has been able to persist because of this legal grey area and the US was ale to invade Afghanistan because it was an ""act of war"" - which only sovereign countries can do. 

In reality the ICC is a weak US institution that will only ever prosecute weak african countries - the US/China/UK/Russia won't be hauled before the ICC because with US decline the world is reverting back to ""strong countries rule"". 

I'm a big believer in the rule of law and human dignity and therefore very much against US/UK/EU involvement in illegal rendition programs. 

Execute them if you must but they deserve a trial - as does every human.

Was in dem Zusammenhang auch interessant ist; Viele wissen gar nicht, dass das Morgenland (Naher Osten) dem Abendland (Westliche Welt) jahrhundertelang in der Kunst, der Wissenschaft und vielen weiteren Bereichen einiges voraus hatte. Während die westliche Welt von den Errungenschaften des Morgenlandes profitiere, daraus lernte und durch eigene Erkenntnisse weiterentwickelte, konnten im Morgenland die religiösen Fundamentalisten ihren Einfluss derart ausbauen, dass sie damit begannen, alles, was sie als gotteslästerlich empfanden, zu bekämpfen bzw. zu zerstören, was dort zu einem größeren Wissensverlust führte. Zudem hatte ihr Fokus auf das Studium des Korans zur Folge, dass im Allgemeinen der forscherische Ehrgeiz nachließ bzw. unterdrückt wurde, was einer Stagnation auf wissenschaftlicher (und auch kultureller) Ebene gleichkam. 

Deshalb bin ich auch der Meinung, dass sich die Menscheit in der Gesamtheit erst weiterentwickeln kann, wenn sie die Religion hinter sich gelassen hat.

I guess it goes full circle then. Al Qaeda never allowed Nick Berg to have  dignity when they cut off his head. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed never allowed journalist Daniel Pearl to have dignity when he cut off his head. All the thousands of people some of whom were on that call audio clip died in a very undignified terror. Should we be as bad as them? No, we aren't beheading them on video or burning them alive on national television. But do they have the right to the utmost dignity and respect? Not in my mind. It probably comes across as religious this belief that they should suffer. It isn't in fact I don't believe in all that, I'm a firm believer that we have one ride in this life and once it is over we are extinguished forever. In that sense, since it is such a precious and finite resource, if you willingly take it away from someone for the purpose of terrorizing a population and do so in a terrifying and degrading manner then I do not believe their finite resource should be spent with them in comfort. There is a sort of cosmic unfairness to that. They can just wipe thousands of people out for the sake of terrorizing a population, people who were going in to work and that these people no longer get to experience life, but we should provide their killers with infinite patience. Its not fair. It's not fair that those people were killed and are extinguished from existence forever but that we should be so concerned for the rights of their tormentors and ultimately killers.

But is that actually needed to keep us safe? No, it just isn't. European nations spend as much on their military as they think is necessary to be prepared against realistic threats. The only remotely realistic threat is Russia and we outspend them already. Also, both they and we have nuclear second strike capability, so any protracted major war is out of the question in the first place.

This leads me to conclude that what americans (and the US government) actually mean is that they want Europe to take a bigger part in enforcing western hegemony on the rest of the world. Americans seem to believe that this is the only way to be safe. From that point of view it is logical for americans to ask europeans to ""pick up some slack"". The US military budget is getting thinner, the US Navy is almost at a point where they can not guarantee total global hegemony anymore.

In particular, he should have employed the calm before the storm to cut our debt to a managable level and put our spending on a reliable revenue stream. What he did was do nothing about our debt and cut taxes (in ways that mostly benefited the rich), creating a huge revenue problem that his successors had to deal with (for comparison, the previous Prodi government had exploited the relative economic prosperity of the 2006-2008 period to rein in the debt and put our finances in order).

Heutzutage ist aber eher so, dass die Wirtschaftsgiganten besonders starke Lobbies haben und andere Bereiche (beispielsweise soziale Arbeit, Arbeitnehmervertretungen) eher schwächere.

The way institution are distributed, the way powers (legislature, judiciary, executive) are shared and separated varies greatly between the different kind of Republic. But in the end they're all Republic.

And, well, in fact, even the ""monarchies"" are Republic. A republic and a monarchy can have exactly the same institution, the same repartition of the differents powers, with only the names changing. 

Talking about ""monarchies"" when neither the monarch, who happens to be the head of state, nor the historical ""aristocracy"" (if it actually still exist, depends on the country) held any kind of power and when the member of the executive and the legislature are both elected through universal suffrage doesn't make any sens.

Nobody talk about ""monarchy"" or ""republic"" in political science or constitutional law today. 

Typology of regime goes by the kind of relation between legislature and executive. Ex : america is a presidential regime with a strict, or rigid, separation of powers, i.e. all the power of the executiv is between the hand of the POTUS, and the POTUS and the american parliament don't really have constitutionals tools to influence each other. Thus, America isn't a parliamentarian regime.
Other exemple : France is a semi-presidential regime, where the government (i.e. the executive) can be removed by the parliament, so France is a parliamentarian regime, BUT the head of State is a President, elected through universal suffrage, and share the executive power with the government. Etc. you can do it with every country.

In the end, the country being a monarchy or a republic will be completely irrelevant. The regime are more or less the same, i.e. democratic and parliamentarian. 

You could **literally** legally abolish the British monarchy tomorrow without even touching to the rest of the british institutions and call Britain a Republic, and absolutely nothing would change.

So if you actually believe that monarchy is linked to some kind of stability or success, you're kinda stupid.

And that's also why monarchists or republicans movements in western democracy are absolutely pointless : if they ever happen to succeed, the only thing that would change is to put on paper ""There is a monarch"" or ""There isn't a monarch anymore"", without anything else changing.",0,1400243581,null,0,1400243790,0,chjgcbq,t3_25owj9,t1_chjgcbq,t3_25owj9,null,1433821914,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

1. Im Originalton ist einfach von *same-sex attraction* die Rede, in den deutschen Untertiteln wird der Zusatz '**unerwünschte** homosexuelle Anziehung' hinzugefügt. Das erscheint mir als der Versuch, der Sache ein wenig die Spitze zu nehmen - als ginge es nicht um die Konvertierung aller Homosexuellen, sondern nur um die Behandlung all derer, die nicht mehr homosexuell sein wollen.

2. Als von den Ursachen von homosexueller Anziehung die Rede war, schien sie mir als Symptom einer größeren Pathologie dargestellt worden zu sein, namentlich dem langsamen Dahinscheiden traditioneller Geschlechterrollen. Väter, die nicht versuchen, ihre Kinder zu Kopien ihrer selbst zu erziehen (einer der Betroffenen sprach davon, dass sein Vater andere Interessen hatte als er) und Mütter, die sich ihren Männern nicht unterordnen (auch wenn sie gewalttätige Alkoholiker sind) sind an Homosexualität schuld. Dann hat man noch *bullying* als zusätzliche Komponente eingefügt. Das mag so aussehen, als stünde es nicht in Verbindung mit der obrigen Ursache, aber: Einer der Betroffenen rechtfertigte das Hänseln als *banter* - so kommunizieren Jungs untereinander einfach, und er war einfach zu empfindlich (*sensitive*), um das zu verstehen.

Que le han pegado 4 tiros a una pepera

La policía anda buscando a la culpable
Porque se lo mandan los de arriba
Pero yo creo que en el fondo los cabrones
Están rebosantes de alegría

Una justiciera a la que admiro
Por su pulso y puntería
Que ha dejado a España con un poco menos
De porquería

Se ha disparado la venta
De chalecos antibalas
Y los peperos ahora tienen miedo

Están todos cagados

De suicidios de recortes

Solo pido que dios exista
Y que por consiguiente
Exista el infierno

Para que cuando llegues
Para purgar tus pecados
Te vuelvan a matar de nuevo...

Increased consumption of caffeine is a horrible thing for developing children as it induces many negative effects like headaches, increased heart rate/blood pressure and problems sleeping/concentrating. That's why it's a good thing to regulate the sale of these products by putting these restrictions on stores et cetera. It has nothing to do with bad parenting, it's just that if you don't want to monitor your children 24/7, they can easily go to a store and buy a few cans of energy drinks, regardless of the fact you told them not to. 

This has nothing to do with the ""state controlling the kids"", this a law like every other, to prevent citizens from doing harm to themselves or others. Your reasoning is the same as saying ""Making murder illegal is controlling citizens! We should teach ourselves not to kill and have no laws!"". Well guess fucking what, some people don't care about what others tell them and generally disregard social conventions/advice, so a law is the proper way to set a standard that applies to everyone while still teaching kids about the dangers of caffeine consumption or have them wait to develop fully mentally in order to be able to (ideally) make educated decision.

- The second, are the many players on the international stage that used the Berlusconi's lack of credibility (caused by sexual scandals) to push us over the edge of the cliff. the rapid surge of the btp-bund spread, that nearly brought the country to default, was forced by many independent entities that had much to gain from it:  the conservative economic press and politicians wanting to push their agenda in Europe, speculators having much to gain from low prices on features from a ""too big to fail country"", Merkel wanting to push austerity, investors hoping in the privatizations of major italian state-owned enterprises, and so on.  
If you remember, Tremonti (minister of economy) was already listening to europe's demands and working on reforms. We all wanted Berlusconi to go, but  we suffered and are still suffering more that we should have, from those attacks.  
And if you notice, the same players are now using Hollande's lack of popular consensus to interfere with France's economic agenda.  
 Berlusconi was a danger, but Europe should really work on strengthening his internal cohesion, protecting his weaker links from external attacks (even stronger countries will benefit from that).

Se il problema fosse solo quello ci sarebbero pochi dubbi: politica monetaria espansiva per alzare l'inflazione e ridurre il peso del debito, incremento di spesa (a debito) nei canali con il massimo moltiplicatore per rilanciare l'economia.

Purtroppo il problema non è solo quello: la politica monetaria non è controllata dall'Italia, quindi questo genere di decisioni non le possiamo prendere per conto nostro se non in modo molto limitato. Per questo è importante votare per chiunque voglia invertire le politiche di austerità a livello europeo. 

Il meglio sarebbe eleggere qualcuno che oltre a invertire l'austerità voglia anche iniziare dei seri programmi di investimento pubblico a livello continentale, finanziati da strumenti tipo gli Eurobond, ma purtroppo in Italia l'unica lista con queste idee ha chance bassissime di eleggere qualcuno quindi ci si accontenta.",0,1400246078,null,0,false,0,chjh3c9,t3_25pe3t,t1_chjh3c9,t1_chjgucn,null,1433822267,7,false,italy,t5_2qkhk,7

But they are seeking compensation based on the actions of individuals, nations weren't enslaved by other nations. Slave owners were private individuals who were legally allowed to carry out the private act of slavery and without this there would be no ground for a suit. The infrastructure of the Caribbean nations is rudimentary compared to modern Western Europe but they are Westernised. The native Carribs nor the African slaves had electricity or paved roads or hospitals before exposure to Western Imperialism these aren't as good as in Europe but they do exist in the Caribbean.

It's using the plight of dead people to extract benefits for their descendants from the citizens of another nation who are descended from the people who were the fellow citizens of private individuals who had slaves. 

Does the Caribbean need investment? Yes. Would Western investment be a humanitarian act, just about but it's insulting to the current state of Caribbean nations really. Is using the past of slavery a suitable justification to demand investment and wipe out debt (effectively demanding money) instead of say investment loans. Not in my book.

true,Whitejade,LITH,Lithuania,"I drank coffee regularly since my teenage years as well as an occasional energy drink so while my views may be biased, I also researched caffeine quite a lot and couldn't find a single good reason to quit altogether, nor for coffee and energy drinks to be banned completely.

I feel that the decision was made simply because of the bad stigma that surrounds energy drinks in Lithuania as well as everywhere else, since it's a relatively new product with it's own new myths (which sensationalist media does a very good job of spreading), often sold in opaque bottles which look like they contain poison, etc. Just yesterday I had a friend tell me that energy drinks are directly responsible for causing erectile dysfunction in men, but I guess what he really meant is that excess consumption of caffeine and sugar can cause heart issues as well as highlight or even cause mental problems. Still, he seemed fixated on the idea that energy drinks are to blame, and that’s what I don’t get. My parents, part of a much older generation, also like to remind me that energy drinks are toxic (especially when I have one before a long drive to not crash into things), but when I tell them it’s just coffee or tea that tastes different, they want to hear none of it – energy drinks are just too easy to blame for everything wrong with younger generations.

Granted, energy drinks can be dangerous without proper knowledge of what’s in them – even small amounts of caffeine can mess up person’s sleep cycle, and sleep is vital to young adults. Sugar, too, can cause issues, therefore we certainly can do away with that extra sugar from drinks.

But let’s say that parents in general do the right thing and educate their children to consume coffee and energy drinks in moderation and well before sleep – everyone's happy and children can decide for themselves whether or not it's beneficial to them. After all, caffeine is only mildly addictive and has almost no withdrawal effects (at worst it's headaches the next few days after quitting cold turkey), so no harm would be done in letting children have it from time to time. Yet education is the part that no one wants to deal with, since it’s much easier to ban the product outright. If I were to point fingers, soft drinks are a MUCH bigger problem, mostly because they’re perceived nowhere near as badly as energy drinks, but work in much the same way – loads of sugar and caffeine.

And WHY did WE decide to ban these drinks? Definitely not because of my aforelisted reasons.

*“Kranauskas said the high levels of caffeine in energy drinks can stimulate hyperactivity and dangerous behaviors in children.  He also warned against the addictive nature of caffeine and warned it could be a gateway to other drugs.”*

This is indeed what my country sees in energy drinks – dangerous behavior and a gateway to harder drugs, which is what I meant by a bad stigma. Even if it is not completely evil, it is a decision born of ignorance and nothing good will come of it, because teenagers will still be able to abuse sugar and caffeine, only without anyone else questioning them.

**TL;DR - We're banning the wrong things for all the wrong reasons.**

true,CaptainLargo,FRAN,France,"Well, the monarchy really returned and was opposed to the Bonaparte. During the Restauration (1814-1815-1830), with the Bourbons (Louis XVIII, Charles X) and the July Monarchy (1830-1848), with Louis-Philippe d'Orléans. Louis-Napoléon (nephew of Napoleon I) was elected President of the Republic in 1848, organized a coup in 1851 and proclaimed himself Emperor. In 1870 he is defeated and captured during the war against Prussia. In Paris the Republicans MP take power and create a new republic. Everyone is good with that because Napoléon III was not very popular (context of defeat). Republicans obviously want to end the Empire, and Monarchists (very numerous) want to organize the return of the Kings.

Elections are organized in 1871 : large victory of the Conservatives (Monarchists, and a part of the Bourgeoisie) who opposed the pursuit of the war. The Monarchists are sure that French did not only vote for them to end the war, but also to reinstall the monarchy. So, they chose a weak President and organize the return of the King.

Problem : the Monarchists are divided in two factions. Legitimists, who support the Bourbon heir (and a strong monarchy) and Orleanist, who support the d'Orléans heir, and a more liberal monarchy. They finally make a compromise : the Bourbon will become king, and, as he had no child, the d'Orléans would become the new king after his death.

New problem : the Bourbon heir, Henri d'Artois, is very intransigeant. He opposed the ""drapeau (flag) tricolore"" of the Revolution and Empire, and wants to use the white and gold lys flag of the Monarchy. Huge opposition of other politicians and Henri d'Artois cannot become King, as long as he would oppose the tricolore flag.

Next problem : The Monarchists are pissed but think that they only have to wait for Henri d'Artois death, and then would reinstall the D'Orléans, who didn't give a shit about the flag. But the opinion has shifted, the majority of the French now wants a true Republic. In the next election the Republicans won the majority in the House, the Monarchists became weaker and weaker, and so dit the hypothetical return of a king.

TL;DR : France would have become a monarchy again if the potential king had accepted the flag of the Revolution. He didn't, public opinion changed, and the Republicans won.",0,1400254296,null,0,1400255228,0,chjkdds,t3_25owj9,t1_chjkdds,t1_chjfa6x,null,1433823998,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

Murder affects another person, in fact, it ends their status as a person. When you harm others, the government needs to legislate to address that. 

Drinking red bull doesn't affect anyone but yourself. Of course I recognize that minors aren't always capable of making that decision, so if parents feel their kids shouldn't be drinking energy drinks, I can totally see their reasoning. But the previous arguments like ""parents can't control the actions of their offspring 24/7"" are somewhat silly. You don't need constant observation to maintain some sense of mutual respect and set some ground rules. 

Just incredibly pointless. Also, linking to studies that energy drinks are harmful to mental/physical development of children are not a reason for there to be a law.

Fun fact, your country was also involved in many coups, including the ones you blame solely on the US like Iran.

France and Canada were even brazen enough to hold a meeting about the future governance of Haiti without inviting a single delegate from Haiti.

true,skgoa,GERM,Germany,"Hey, I can totally understand the american point of view. The US has been using NATO in their foreign policy for many decades, which has benefited europeans greatly. The US government spends a huge amount of money on keeping troops and entire fleets deployed in certain areas it has an interest in. With budgetary reality being what it is right now, the US government would like more european contribution to this, instead of being a drain of ressources. Europe is pretty much a stable and safe now and even without NATO it seems likely that european nations would stay more or less aligned with America. Focusing the US military's ressources on a new defensive alliance against China might actually be the best course of action for America. You gotta make priorities and Europe isn't or at least probably shouldn't be a priority for US foreign policy. If europeans weigh the alliance down by dragging their feed, it's best to cut them loose and only keep those allies who pull their own weight. E.g. why exactly is my own country (Germany) allowed to have less oceangoing escorts (i.e. frigattes) in our navy than the treaties we signed say we have to? That's just not how proper allies should behave.

But would you actually disband NATO? I don't think so. Having NATO and being the alliance's leader still brings too many benefits. An independent Europe could become incredibly problematic. At the moment it's broadly US+EU against Russia+China, US against Russia+China+EU would be trouble. Disbanding NATO would be a huge gamble and probably politically impossible for any president who would prefer to not be impeached. That's why european nations can reduce their defense spending to the level they deem appropriate for self-defense. 

At the basic level, IMO it's a difference in what different countries and their governments see as the role of NATO. Europe generally sees it as a strictly defensive alliance. We helped against Afghanistan and we help in the Global War of Terror. But we don't generally see power projection as the point of NATO, which is why almost none of us helped against Iraq. (NATO has officially decided a couple pf years ago that it is also about ""out of area"" operations that secure ressources or lines of commerce but european populations weren't happy about that.) We will continue to see the exact same messages from the US government regarding Europe not spending enough until either something changes to make europeans want to spend more on defense or americans finally say ""enough is enough"" and cut us loose. From all the talk refering to the threat Iran, Russia or China pose to Europe, it seems the US government is still hoping for the former but I just don't see it happening. 

tl;dr: We would very much like you to reduce your military spending to our self-defense level. You would very much like us to increase our military spending to your power-projection level. Neither is gonna happen in the foresseable future.

Monarchies earn a ton of money for their countries. No elected representative can do that because it's based on history and culture.

*Illegal* immigrants. Criminals. 

&gt;access to asylum  

They are free to apply at their local consulate, or any other consulate outside of Europe for that. They do not. They instead try to get here illegally.

&gt;the basic philosophy of EU migration policy can be expressed simply: to keep them out, make life as unpleasant as possible for those who do arrive, get rid of them quickly if you can, and if you can’t, then detain them for as long as possible. 

Because they are a drain on our social systems.  
They do not speak the local language, they do not have a proper education, they do not have any money to care for themselves, and they have a very different culture.   
So the state has to care for them, teach them the basics so they can at least get a shitty job, and then it has to teach them our culture and values, and respect for our laws as well.   

That's a lot of money. Money that we won't see again for another few generations, when their kids have grown up and gained better jobs. If they don't decide to move somewhere else of course.

&gt;summary returns, in some cases violent

Something tells me that most of those ""violent"" returns simply needed more force because the illegal immigrants refused to comply with police orders.

&gt;Greece built a fence, which EU border guards help to patrol, making its land border with Turkey much harder to cross

What, are we meant to *help* illegal immigrants now with crossing our borders? Maybe we should replace the fence with welcome mats and a nice buffet?

These illegal immigrants are a threat to our prosperity.

true,Dogmatiker,null,null,"There is no law on keeping pets, it usually is regulated through the contract you sign, but as always the clauses therein are highly controversial in terms of judicial review. But since German courts dont follow a ""stare decisis"", there is conflicting decisions whether a cat qualifies as a ""small animal"", i.e. ""Kleintier"" or not. If you have already rented an appartmente, you should either should consult Google or ask a lawyer specialized in ""tenancy law"", i.e. Mietrecht, if you need to know the limits of your tenancy contract. If you havent which I assume you do, the answer is: it depends. Most people arent really opposed to pets but are rather wary, the damage done by them, e.g. a cat ruining the wood floors, wont be payed for. Having pet insurance might sway a potential landlord when he raises that objection. Considering your pet of choice is a cat, there might be an issue brought up if you want to keep your cat indoors only as to the noise she might make. This is rather tricky, since its difficult for a landlord to rescind their permission to keep a cat afterwards, but you should argue that you would get rid of it, if it would be to noisy, maybe they will fall for that. And yes I know, cats usually are much more quite than dogs. I would strongly advise you against bringing a pet into your flat without having obtained permission before, since - at the worst case scenario - you could face eviction after having been sued, although that would be very rare occurence. But it is defininetly possible to keep a cat without permission, if your house is large enough, so that no one will notice, but, again, I would advise against it. All in all, you may be rejected for having a cat a few times, but as long as you arent moving to a area where an affordable place to stay is a scarcity, you wont have any problems. Even then,  have a lawyer look over your contract and maybe you can bring in your cat in anyway.

Because it was... It was a very destabilising process. You will never understand this as a Westerner.

Don't get me wrong, Putin is a shady man, but I don't think this particular quote proves anything. To a Westerner, USSR was only about Stalin's terrors, that's it basically. That's like judging 20th century Germany on Hitler alone.

The USSR may have had many problems, but it represented the heyday of Russia in just about every possible category, whether it is the quality of life, economic power, political power, etc. Westerners used to higher living standards don't understand this with their jaundiced eyes. Putin brought the living standards back up and even beyond the USSR mark, but the equal distribution of income has not kept up, so people still look back at the USSR fondly.

As far as I know in the U.S. most waiters are paid a very low amount and the tips are calculated into the wage itself and if not a certian amount is met the employer has to pay the rest for minimum wage. So if one knows that you are somewhat ""forced"" into tipping, because otherwise the waiter may not make enough money this month.

However in Germany the tip is not part of the wage and is completley tax free. In Germany there is not even an assumed entitlement, because the person may not have enough money to live without it. Heck I think if that were the case tips wouldn't be tax free anymore. So no guiltripping or anything. A tip in Germany is because you thought the service was good and if you don't want to tip don't do it without feeling guilty.

Also I hear sometimes that restaurants in the U.S. put a tipping fee onto the receipt, that the guest has to pay. I don't know any case here in Germany, but that does not mean there are none, but in general restaurants don't do it, because then tax has to be paid for it. So it would mean less for the waiter and eventuelly more costs for the employer, because the waiter gets into another tax group and stuff like that.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; The problem is that direct democracy assumes the general populace is mostly composed of informed citizens

This is the usual objection raised against direct democracy (note that I am not advocating direct democracy, as no nation, not even mine has that - but partial direct democracy).  And you know what?  **You're absolutely right!**

However, it is not a ""problem"", but a ""challenge"".  It should not be viewed as a reason to NOT have popular voting, but as something to be considered and solved so you CAN have popular voting.  It is governments' responsibility to inform their constituents, period.  There is no excuse for not having a fair, impartial, easily understood evaluation and communication mechanism that is transparent and subject to tremendous oversight - I mean, _we_ manage to do it, and we usually fuck things like that up, so why can't bigger countries with more extensive bureaucracies?

When I vote, several times a year, I receive a booklet that contains the text of any proposed law, an impartial explanation with callouts for particular, salient points, by an electoral commission that I thoroughly trust for its impartiality (and I'm a snarky, cynical bastard).  It also includes points from the major pro and con parties - i.e. usually the government and the referendum committees.  It's concise and clear, and available in multiple formats, including online, and comes in a handy-dandy pocket format with every ballot.

I also benefit from a strong educational system, which has given me a solid understanding of my rights and responsibilities as an engaged citizen, and of the workings of my democracy (and of its responsibilities towards me!)

If you don't believe that I, as a voter, cannot be trusted to make my decision based on that, then you should not believe that I can be trusted with _any_ decision, including election of representatives (whose electoral campaigns, let's be honest, are usually about the absolute worst examples of informing your citizenry of current events.)",0,1400269188,null,0,false,0,chjrdqr,t3_25p64e,t1_chjrdqr,t1_chjjl4r,null,1433827430,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

It's pretty simple in both countries. German service staff gets 'enough' money from their employer which he geht's back from the customer by increased prizes. So you basically give them a little extra money.

You are not really obligated to do it, because they wouldn't starve without your money, but it isn't exactly the best paid job and if the service is good you give something.

In the US most employers in the service business don't *really* pay their staff. To me it looks like they just bring the tables, kitchen + 2-3 bucks and the staff's real wages get paid by the customer. The food is cheaper though.

So in Germany, the employer is the one who pays the waitresses bills. In the US it is the customer.

It's a waste if it's not accessible, and I don't really see the point in paying the electricity bill for a box that is of no use but being hooked up to another box with which I can actually do the things I want.

&gt; And having a say in something if they wish is not actual power?

Yes. He is immune of charges for one. He could basically grab a sword and stab the statsminister without any consequences. He can discuss matters which concerns him but he never involves in politics because he is politically neutral. If the king would involve himself in politics too much the population would get pretty mad and that is one reason why he doesn't (he learns from history).

&gt; What history? What for example is Carl XVI's contribution to history that he couldn't have made not being a monarch?

For one. Another is historical events. Birth of kings and queens wouldn't be birth of kings and queens anymore if we abolished the monarchy. Weddings etc aswell.

&gt; How does a monarchy promote culture? Do you have any basis for claiming that it promotes tourism? (In the UK maybe, but Sweden?)

true,greatestname,null,null,"&gt; What the hell is the point of me paying the Makler when the person who's putting up the apartment for rent is having the Makler do all the work.

The landlord hires the Makler to get him a new tenant, do all the paperwork etc. For that work, how much or not much at all it is, the Makler gets paid if and only if he finds a tenant.

The law allows the payment to come from the landlord or the tenant. Which side pays is really up to the market conditions and market power. If the demand is high, the landlord can make the tenant pay the Makler and he will find tenants who accept this. If demand is low (e.g. certain parts of eastern Germany, selling houses in the countryside), landlords have to pay the Makler to make the offer more attractive to potential tenants.

&gt; why the hell is the Makler double dipping by charging both us and them.

They do not.

It used to be called ""Staatsexamen für Lehramt"", but I'm fairly sure it was changed to bachelor and master plus referandarzeit (if incorrect, someone please correct).

Les légitimistes n'ont pas à ma connaissance de parti politique structuré.

L'alliance royale ne prend pas position :

&gt; Non, nous estimons que ce sont de telles divisions qui ont maintenu les royalistes dans l'inexistence politique malgré une forte sympathie de beaucoup de nos concitoyens. Nous proposons donc un parti unitaire, réunissant tous les royalistes, et tous les Français fidèles à leur Histoire. Le choix dynastique se réglera le moment venu.

And, no, fibre generally doesn't need modems, fibre links are usually Ethernet, just like your local network connection, just over, well, fibre instead of twisted-pair copper. The actual tranciever, that is, the thing shooting photons down the fibre, comes as a module which you plug into an [SFP slot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_form-factor_pluggable_transceiver). Usual routers don't have such a thing, the MikroTik I linked does.

There's, in principle, two other ways to get 1gbps to your outlet: First, standard copper gigabit ethernet, over twisted pair cables, but that would mean that you need good copper (telephone wires aren't near enough), which makes no sense to lay down to your outlet when you could equally well lay down fibre, which will be able to carry even greater speeds in the future. Secondly, the maximum length of a 1000BASE-T link is 100m, assuming CAT5 cables or better. 

The whole thing would maybe make sense in a multi-appartment building, where the provider could collect, say, 10 one-gigabit links into a single 10GBASE fibre link in the basement, but even then you'd probably want to lay down fibre to the individual appartments right next to the copper, so that you can upgrade in the future. Copper won't get faster than 10gbit/s, the physical limit has been reached. 1gbit/s copper *is* cheaper than fibre, so it might be cheaper to install both cables, right now.

The other solution would be coaxial cable, but that has more or less the same problems.

Technologies where you would need a modem -- ADSL or VDSL -- aren't nearly fast enough. Other technologies exist, but don't make sense in this context.

You need to get a German passport. To get that you have to do what the German embassy says. Ask tghem waht you have to do in order to keep your US citizenship, too.

&gt; Also my second question is the only jobs I am finding in Germany are au pairs, IT work and computer science work. I'm not finding any teaching positions in Germany which would be ideal for my fiance and I to start work in. Are there any teaching jobs in Germany?

Yes, but it depends on the Bundesland. Public schools usually don't offer jobs but you have to apply at some central agency. 

[Bildungsserver: Lehrerbedarf und Lehrpersonalentwicklung in den Bundesländern](http://www.bildungsserver.de/Lehrerbedarf-und-Lehrpersonalentwicklung-in-den-Bundeslaendern-5530.html) (in German) has some information about the situation in different Bundeländern.


&gt; My third question is if anyone else has experience teaching in Germany, what other certifications, if any, are necessary to hold a teaching position there?

Are we talking about basic emergency food/medical aid?  (N.b.:  not long-term sustained aid as that can be counterproductive and undermine local economies).  That may be a good investment as it can help alleviate the more serious effects of famines and disasters, and thus forestall or limit refugee streams which end up costing more.

Or political / economic development aid to foreign governments?  Here you're stabilizing local institutions and helping build markets for your country's products.  

Maybe direct aid to specific projects abroad, say, providing cash and expertise to police or urban services in another country?  You could be helping the influence of extremist groups or organized crime which either take over or otherwise participate in such services.  That will save you money in the long run.

I'm not arguing ""foreign aid is good"".

We're kind of depending on this. What has happened is as the noose has closed around UKIP their hard core has become more enthused and registered their vote. There is a good 30% who'll support them through just about any crisis.

However they've been losing the fight for the middle ground for months now and this will probably put an end to it. Particularly Farage builds his credibility on being able to answer a straight question. He couldn't answer why he preferred Germans to Romanians because the answer was simple racism.

I think a lot of the moderates will begin to see that this mentality is precisely racism.

Once the actual choice to leave came though, the EU would probably choose to cut all of the benefits that the UK receives from being in the EU, but no more. They want leaving to be painful, but it's important that the EU has an image of maturity. They need to take the moral highroad to look legitimate, so they'll still work with Britain, but now it will be more expensive for the British to participate. Maybe they go as far as to give extra concessions to Ireland and Scotland (assuming Scotland becomes independent and joins the EU), just to make London jealous. 

It would probably be in the EU's best interest to keep the relationship cordial though. They might even negotiate a fast-track back into the EU if opinion changed in the UK. Letting a country leave looks back, but it will look simply *amazing* if the most skeptical country in the bloc admitted that it was wrong and wanted to come back in. But this possibility goes away if they insult the UK too harshly, so they should try to make the transition as smooth as possible, without too much pomp and circumstance. 

Of course, if it turns out that the UK actually does *better* without being in the EU (which I think is unlikely, but who knows?) that would be a problem.

true,ggow,SCOT,Scotland,"Granted he misunderstood the process by which Croatia's accession was ratified but that doesn't mean that there has to be a referendum for Scotland. 

In any case, and I think I've said this a million times on here, it doesn't make sense to talk about possibilities without also considering the probabilities. Your entire (well, not all of it but most) spiel above is predicated on the assumption that it's possible France might have to have a referendum. The thing is, I see no reason to believe that. 

Why would the French people demand a referendum? There would be little political pressure for one to be granted when, in essence, it represented no difference to the French people. There would have to be a loud enough number of people in France who wanted to see Scotland ejected from the EU(de jure, of course, that's not what would be happening but it's de facto what the vote would be on). Where would that drive come from? The answer is 'nowhere'. 

So then, in the absence of political demand for the referendum (where a no vote would, oddly, represent a change from the status quo) it falls to the French Parliament. Now, Croatia's accession treaties were ratified through a different procedure (possibly, I've not confirmed it) but it actually met all the criteria that would otherwise be necessary. In fact, the vote in the NA was unanimous. 

Unless you can substantiate why Croatia would receive a unanimous vote but Scotland would struggle to secure a supermajority in the Parliament, considering that Scotland is already a wealthy, net contributing, constituent part of the EU now, and an affirmative vote would be to retain that, then it seems highly unlikely that a) a referendum would be required and b) that it would fail in the French Parliament. 

Given that, on examining the probabilities, the possibilities your diatribe are built upon seem remote. 

As to the possibilities of England dumping Wales and Northern Ireland, as if! You also seem to be overestimating the extent to which England is a cash cow for the other three nations. Scotland supports itself, admittedly with a high deficit but not one above average. The truth is, England's financial condition is terrible. It rides high on London's coat tails but, beyond the South East, the areas struggle to keep themselves. There are myriad reasons for that, that I wont' go in to, except to say, the need for England to balance its books would still exists and losing the other three constituent countries would not have a colossal impact on that.

How's that bullshit? Poland is already dependent enough on Russian gas, and Russia frequently uses it as a leverage.

That wasn't a problem when Russia was a semi-dependable and predictable country, but now it would be just plain stupid. Russia could destabilize Poland's energy sector on a whim, and with what's going on in Ukraine right now, nobody's going to question their decision. 

Energy independence from Russia is one of the long term goals of Poland, right now with all the sanctions being imposed is an ideal time to deny Russia the license. Poland will secure the energy sector a bit more, sanction a Russian oligarch, gain some goodwill and prestige with anti Russian countries and decrease Russian influence in their country while still being seen as a just, good for investment nation that's imposing sanctions on bad Russia.

Actually all of this only exist because google does. You need that kind of cash flow to make that kind of R&amp;D since none of the other big corps nor any government is willing to put any form of effort into it beyond bullshit to get re elected dropped 2 months later. cf obama's promises on the net neutrality.

&gt; That doesn't mean the use or selling of those products is going to be forbidden or that Germany would size assets or something like that. That's ridiculous.

If you break up google, all those project will insta tank disappear because nobody else will dare funding them. say adios to autopiloted cars and unlimited emails and all the magitech stuff in their labs they prolly don't talk about. That would set back the IT sector probably 50y overtime, at best. that's it if we don""t kiss goodby to the net to see it destroyed by unchecked petty comcast slowlan and caps project in the us then the rest (dear Mr Cameron, how's that firewall in UK ?).

&gt; It does give a shit when Google effectively controls a media section and e mail and mobillity. 

Google controles those media because all the concurents are either still paper newspaper/tv/radio who refuse to adapt to modern technologies or just outright steal all the gov r&amp;d money to produce nothing. To put it nicely, Google is in monopole because there aren't a single concurrent that isn't corrupt or greedy braindead retards for our era.

&gt;  It's a matter of national independence.

then maybe it would be a better idea to attract them in europe and make them more european instead of potentially destroying the company who brings you technology of the future ? 

Let me remind you that before them you had to *buy* software like copernic and *search results volume* to get anything vaguely related to what you were looking for at a professionnal level. Then Google went in and brought us things like free and pertinent search, free email, and gps-like maps for everyone that isn't a millionaire or business owner.

So, i'm not exactly going to agree when some self interested asshole want to sacrifice the one group who will potentially make us jump a good century technologically speaking just for a few more votes; and because he was scared of the power of stuff he didn't understand like the net and therefore prefer destroying it like every single fucking luddite around.

1°) no they weren't before the google car. vague talks only.

2°) mercedes lab tech sucked, badly, from what i heard. as in ""10y from being ready, constant accidents risks""

3°) while google's technology, unlike's mercedes ""projects for one day, maybe""; is already technologically ready, being pushed in the us.

It's waiting for only two things : legal approval, and sorting the insurance issue in-case-of-accident-still (because while it's times less risky than humans , the impossible-to-crash-zero-risk don't exist and they have to consider the eventuality no matter what. ie more legal issues).

basically, it's another case where google alone successfully develloped a working product. That's how they are in monopoly. *by delivering workin shit, instead of empty promises in 20y like their concurrents*.

&gt; Are you serious? Every other ISP or webcompany in Germany offers unlimited emails. For free.

they started doing it once gmail caught. before it didn't exist.

&gt; could somehow destroy the international corporation that is google. That's nonsense. 

true they can't alone, but they could pressure others into helping them isolate what is basically the single ultra-productive and driving force in the entire it sector. and even admitting they can't, talk about suggesting shooting our own feets with a bazooka, even if they cant.

&gt; No it's about foreign intelligence services knowing every detail about every citizen at any time.

the current guys at the NSA probably invented half the computer hardware in the world. they'll find their way in no matter what :) it's merely a challenge to them, and i doubt merkel's non-smartphone phone had any non-german bits running on it. 

if it's about data we better bring it back agreed, but there's a way to do it, that doesn't involve attacking the one group that helped made the current internet what it was and which is probably the key to a better future.

&gt; Yes. And now that that is established we have open sourced and or free and or sometimes better alternatives. Your point?

better ? which are ? remember, customers do vote with their wallet on the best stuff in their own pov. and the net denizens are most aware of the tech aspects of what they use. but somehow they keep voting google. that might have to do, again, with their ability to deliver stuff *that just works* without blatant catch.",1,1400312913,null,0,1400313279,0,chk6k44,t3_25rmnk,t1_chk6k44,t1_chk6b7n,null,1433834725,1,false,europe,t5_2qh4j,1

because google *keep pushing* technological progress, which is a vitale component if you want a better future and not another 50-100y of corporate-run statu-quo.

What else could they come up with ?

&gt; Well if you put a priority on it, they don't phone home as much.

that's both a curse and a blessing. google vast amount of info means the system can actually understand properly what you are looking for and give you the opening hours of that starbucks near me. unlike most concurrents. but as for the ""phone the us home"", it can be arranged, by moving some of the DC here and some proper laws. 

As for the NSA, if you want to keep 'em out, the only real solution is prolly like the russians currently do : typewritters, ban on scanners, and be prepared to send human courriers for important deliveries.

&gt; Why do you lock your doors? Burglars will get in anyway. Why do you need rights? Noones is going to hurt you, right?

zero risk dont exist. sorry to put it that way but deal with it. all we can is reduce it like by ""asking nicely"" big corps to bring their datacenters in europe, at arm's length. but destroying the internet or our future because you can't entirely controle it is just outright luddisme.

In short: S.Arabia is considering sanctions because of insults made by Wilders against islam and the country. A while ago Wilders had stickers made which depicted the S.Arabian flag that said ""The islam is a lie. Muhammed is a crook. The Quran is poison."" instead of the islamic creed.

Wilders is not impressed by the threat and states that The Netherlands should have boycotted this ""horrible"" country years ago.

Quindi mi confermi che ti danno un IP pubblico senza troppe storie? Quando avevo l'ADSL, anni fa, di storie ne facevano parecchie. Se poi ogni tanto mi cambia non e' un problema.

&gt; Per quanto riguarda ""il rame"": IMHO se con Fastweb non riuscirai ad arrivare ai 100/10 per via dell'infrastruttura, dubito che con gli altri potrai fare meglio, a meno che non abbiano intenzione di usare un doppino diverso.

Giustissimo. Mi sono orientato su Fastweb solo perche' e' l'unica che promette ""fino"" a 100 Mbit e per l'ottima esperienza passata. Pero' il rame e' di Telecom.

&gt; Mi ero informato per un familiare e mi pare di ricordare comunque che con la configurazione usata da Fastweb per VDSL2 è tecnicamente difficile scendere sotto i 40 Mbps, quindi sarebbe in ogni caso più veloce, ma non sono un tecnico della ditta, quindi non te lo posso assicurare. :-P

In effetti anche passare da 15 a 40 Mbit non mi farebbe schifo. Soprattutto senza dover pagare migliaia di euro e senza dover sventrare mezzo appartamento per il cablaggio in fibra fino a casa.

&gt; Ovviamente molto importante è quanto sei distante dall'armadio in strada.

Questa e' un'incognita. Ho visto che a 200 metri, in fondo alla via, c'e' un nuovo POP Telecom ma non ho idea di dove sia quello Fastweb. Sapendo come lavoriamo noi in azienda, forse il POP e' condiviso per entrambi.

When I ask someone on the street ""Do you know where can I find the ... here?"", should I add my opinion too?

In this case you have to.. You are not trying to find a bakery or a mathematical fact. You are trying to figure out a hypothetical development: *what will happen with the future of Europe if Russia cuts gas exports*. These are not logically the same( where is the bakery, and what does the future hold if ), you see.

The passive-aggressiveness you allude to might be your recognition that someone hurt you. I didn't spare you at all in my reply, I was straight-out aggressive. By *aggressive* I mean, I aggressively took your reply and stated my opinion of it clearly (poor form) and pushed you to *spill the beans*. And your feelings might be passive as you try to hide in a coherent and urbane manner the fact that you have no good argumentation and somebody took advantage of it. Whichever, you try to argue with me based on your emotional state accusing me of my emotional state rather than submitting logical argumentation. Again poor form.

Finally, you succumb and you present your opinion (if you were so offended, why do it?). 

The reason to ask someone's opinion, falconberger, (and you'd do good if do so) is to gauge their depth of thought, their manner of thinking, their political inclinations, their personalities. This is done as there is hardly ever a clear side to any issue. People's opinions on broad subject matters are the best way to find out what type of person you are dealing with. This works because as people are given enough freedom to talk about what they think (a broad topic, like *what will happen to europe*) they will inevitably share some of their inclinations and hidden preconceptions, subsuming these to be facts, while they are only personal preconceptions, ideological inclination, etc.

I can't even begin to wonder what you mean by this line. How is Android different from iOS or Symbian? Sure, you can do some stuff with it that you couldn't with the other two, but the same goes to other direction as well.

&gt; would you ban it (iPhone) for monopoly ? 

Monopoly doesn't lead into a ""ban"". What you get is that as ""monopoly"" mostly means that the product is no longer on the whims of the market (because there is no alternative to which customers might jump to) the state strives to provide similar level of control.


&gt;Then google passed by, did better, opened, independant from an US apple web serveur controling everything and opensource 

Symbian was first developed in tandem by several companies and later open sourced with some closed packages. This isn't much different what Google does with Android (with-holding certain programs and services from user-installed distros). 

Sure, Android surpassed Symbian which was really old software (dating back to mid-90s) and didn't really suit modern mobiles. But as said, Symbian was owned by several companies and later open-sourced: Android on the other hand is very much in the control of one company.

&gt;And you wonder how google ended up in monopoly..

Nobody is wondering that. 

&gt;but of coursee let's break the company and destroy it's project.

Google could well spin-off Android into it's own company and then sell half the stock. Or they could accept state oversight that they aren't using the monopoly to take inroads that aren't possible for smaller companies. Or they could be forced to open up some of their systems to make it easier to competitors to make better products, thus making the competition harder.

None of these would lead into ""destroying the project"".

&gt;how dare you did give access to everyone to smartphone.

You are confusing something that would have happened anyway (the ever-lowering cost of building mobile phones) with the company that best succeeded in taking advantage of it. If it hadn't been Android, it would have been Symbian, Windows Phone or some young upstart.

The Italian government, even under Monti, barely complied with Brussels' austerity demands. Italians can't really blame the outside for their decline.

But, if you are as responsible for Italy's economic failings as Berlusconi, and the PDL/Lega Nord governments were, it's convenient to shift the blame.

Most of the cuts to social spending and infrastructure that have come down as of late, have been mandated by rightwing-led regional governments. Piemonte has witnessed savage cuts, for example - led by the Lega.

That's like saying ""Can I use linux on windows"". It's just dumb, these are competing services offered by different websites.

Hahahahahaha  
Don't waste any time reading this, it's just a bunch of insinuations sold as facts. *Marco Travaglio style*.    
Who, by the way, is a populist attention whore, not europe's greatest journalist: A right wing man, his mentor was the director of the Berlusconi's family newspaper. In a time when anti-berlusconism gave work and fame to many, he became the most fervent one. He made himself a career on a popular political talk-show, where every week he read long and harsh opinion pieces, made by stitching together quotes from judicial documents and mere insinuations (A has been seen talking with B, enemy of A, so A is clearly working for B).  
He founded a newspaper, ""the daily fact"" (because everything that comes from his mouth or pen is supposed to be a fact, despite his many lost trials for defamation), focused on politics with highly sensationalistic and populist tones.  
Then Berlusconi fell, but don't fear for poor Marco, the loss of his biggest target didn't hurt him at all:  over the years he never forgot his right-wing soul and never lost a chance to paint the left wing party as ""as bad as Silvio"", ""the ones that let him being Silvio"" and so on. Over the years he also built a strong alliance with Beppe Grillo. Grillo gave him a space in his blog, his media agency published his books, and while Travaglio was cultivating the hatred against the political class (no one excluded) on his newspaper, Grillo started offering populist solutions with his shows in theaters and piazzas. The rest is history, Travaglio further moved his newspaper into anti-politicians and pro-grillo positions, leading to the resignation of his co-funder, and the Democratic Party became the designated enemy in their shared ""revolution"" (not Berlusconi, of course, who by the way gained a lot of consensus when, before the elections, destroyed Travaglio on their first ever face-off on television).

Deshalb ist Israel darauf angewiesen, Atom-U-Boote an der Küste zu haben, die damit wenigstens halbwegs sicher (=nicht schnell erreichbar) sind. Damit hat Israel in jedem Fall ein Druckmittel um einen Rückzug/Waffenstillstand zu erzwingen.

Man kann zwar mehr oder weniger die außenpolitische Reaktion auf die angestrebte EU-Erweiterung beim Ukrainekonflikt ""verstehen"", das rechtfertigt Russlands aggressiven Militäteinsatz trotzdem nicht. Was die sich dort in einem souveränen Nachbarland leisten ist unter aller Sau.

Man beachte in der Beziehung die Aussagen die aus dem Kreml kamen und kommen. Was die für eine Sauerei treiben ist unglaublich....Wiedergeburt des russischen Nationalismus....na da kann sich die Montagsdemo-Friedensbewegung doch mal einen drauf wedeln.

Russland hatte grundsätzlich kein Recht in die Ukraine einzugreifen, genausowenig wie Deutschland das Recht hat, Preußen wieder zu besetzen. Sollen also endlich abhauen da unten und die UN ein ordentliches  Referendum  abhalten lassen, auch wenn die Krim  wahrscheinlich mit knapp mehr als 50% für den Anschluss stimmen wird.

Es ist für mich unverständlich, wie man als freiheitsliebender Bürger nur um hip und antimainstream zu sein zu einem (ich drück mich jetzt mal so aus) ""Putinversteher"" mutieren kann. Es gibt da draußen ernsthaft Leutn, die Russlands Vorgehen **gutheißen**. Ich komm da echt nicht drauf klar.

Der Brief formuliert nun natürlich eine denkbar zugespitzeste Situation. Wahrscheinlich etwas übertrieben in den Grundzügen aber goldrichtig.

Putin muss endlich weg und die freiheitlich-demokratische Kultur in Russland wieder etabliert und geschützt werden, bevor dieser Dreckskerl das ganze Land vergiftet.

Leider -und das bedenkt der Artikel nicht- kann der Westen das nicht wirklich realisiern, da muss die Opposition in Russland ran. Im Zweifelsfall würde Sanktionen Russland also nur noch mehr isolieren und gewaltbereiter machen als jetzt schon.

Also was tun? Ich wüsste es nicht. Da muss ein internationaler Aktionsplan her. Insofern: ""Hallo, Kalter Krieg #2!""

Most who say it isn't don't know anything about history and Russia's historical interaction with the rest of Europe.

Russia being ""big"" and stretching over Asia is very recent. For most of its history, Russia wasn't reaching to Vladivostok and it was evolving in (and still is) in its westernmost parts...

&gt;Russia isn't culturally European

It isn't culturally *Western* European. One part of Europe doesn't have the exclusive right to decide what's European and what isn't.
